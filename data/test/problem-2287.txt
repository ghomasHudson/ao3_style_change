"You're hired," Matt says straight off the bat. "Pretty foregone conclusion, judging from the crowd. Rocky start, but I reckon it was just nerves. Draco told me that you said you didn't bring your references, but... it was your first time stripping, wasn't it?"
Jealousy bubbles up within him. Harry growls and balls his fists, breaking into a run.
And that's when Harry starts to suck him like a goddamn lollipop.
, but even before the letters have fully dissolved, another word has already formed, completing Draco's sentence.
They fight because they can't wait another second without touching each other.
Harry can almost
Draco props his upper body up on the table and opens his legs wider.
"I can never love her the way she loves me." Malfoy draws in a deep, trembling breath. "Not the way that I…" he peters off, turning to Harry. With mounting adrenaline, Harry tracks Malfoy's eyes as he trails a hot-blooded gaze all over Harry, as if this is his last chance to look at him. "The piercings, the attitude, my rebellion in eighth year, I got over all of that. But you… You," Malfoy whispers, his halting words emerging in a voice pitched husky and low.
"Slowing down in your old age, Potter?" Draco mocks, softening his words with a coquettish wink.
cock.
"Draco?" Harry asks, frowning.
Back at Grimmauld, more of Draco’s things appear — a toothbrush, an extra set of clothes, his favourite chocolates and ice-cream, his song-writing notebook and one of his guitars. Harry paints in his studio, while Draco writes his songs in the gallery beside him. When Harry asks him why he likes writing there, Draco looks up from his guitar, smiles and gestures to the artwork around him, saying that Harry’s paintings give him inspiration for his songs.
A burst of heat emanates from the hearth, and Harry turns. With a fiery breath, Pork Chop has stoked the waning fire, the crackling and warmth lending a toasty and cosy atmosphere to the hut. Charlie is at the sink, washing out two mugs. Harry flicks his wand, and a box of their usual Earl Grey floats from the rack to the kettle.
Malfoy makes a strange, wheezing sound and yanks it away from him. He tosses it into the cupboard, shoves Harry away and slams the cupboard shut. He presses his back against the doors, his cheeks still tinged with a rosy blush.
Malfoy refuses to meet his eyes, but he's still holding Harry's hands. "I tried to forget you over the years. It's hard."
Draco snickers. "Of course not. Only want you to give me a ride."
Draco doesn't have time to dodge Potter's fist when it flies towards his face.
Harry slowly looks up from the paper.
Potter looks down at his croissant. "That's what Ron and Hermione say, but it's..." He shakes his head dismissively. "No. My job... it's comfortable. Stable." He licks a strip of sugar off his pastry. "And that's what I want right now." Despite his words, Potter looks pensive for a moment, before the grim line sealing his lips is replaced by a grin that's too bright and wide to be genuine. He grabs the phone to order their takeout, and Draco munches thoughtfully on his pastry.
He promptly unleashes a heartbreaker smile.
"Real. Not leaving tonight," Harry promises, his body tensing. "Or tomorrow morning. Draco."
"Only if there's someone for me to come home to," Harry says at once.
"W-W-
Thank you for reading, and I hope that you felt for Harry and Draco as much as I did while I was writing this <3
"No, it's not for me. It's pork chops, for my pet," Harry explains, holding up the bag.
Merlin, he'll be pulling petals off flowers next.
Harry always cooked pasta whenever Draco was sick or upset. Eating his spaghetti was like coming home, no, Harry
Harry closed the file on the potion ring case and dropped it onto his desk.
Draco gazed back at him a moment with raised eyebrows. “Joke’s on you,” he said, and left the kitchen.
Harry wanted to strangle Malfoy, just a little. But Malfoy was smiling at him, surrounded by pink roses, and all he could do was stare.
“Yes. Okay. Hermione, you’re making this worse.”
While Edward was absorbed in surveying the blackberry bramble, Draco inched along the pathway, his gaze set on the little patch of laurel leaves where he spied the white plume of a furred tail. The leaves rustled gently, and the tail slipped from sight. Draco narrowed his eyes.
“A true sixth sense,” he said. “Sixth sense” was one of the many muggle phrases he’d learned after moving to the area. The concept amused him, as did superstitions like bad luck for breaking mirrors. Muggles might not have had true magic, but they had some ideas that came surprisingly close to the truth—and some that were laughingly off-kilter.
The redacted information. Harry’s request to enforce Section III. Malfoy’s insane house wards. (Harry swears Hermione smiles into her teacup at this part of the story.) He tells her about Malfoy’s defensiveness at receiving the FORCE form and the scores of document requests from the Ministry. The following uncomfortable conversation with Robards and the way Robards rushed a hearing with Malfoy, trying to close this case quickly. Malfoy’s piles of books. His manuscript. The byproducts that—supposedly—produce squibs. Malfoy’s squeaky clean record. Seeing the CEO of Poesy Potions in the Ministry atrium.
“Well?” Malfoy said.
Harry doesn’t know the law well, but he’s pretty sure personal correspondence doesn’t count as public information, even if written on university parchment. And the request for dozens of academic documents strikes him as extreme—not to mention absurd. The request fills over three pages.
Ron’s hands squeeze Harry’s. That’s something Harry appreciates about Ron; especially during Harry’s time in hospital, Ron was one to offer physical reassurance. The Weasleys have always shared physical affection easily, and they include Harry in this. Ron spent a lot of time at Harry’s bedside in the aftermath of the curse, holding his hand, squeezing his shoulder, ruffling his hair. As Harry got well enough to sit up, Ron would drape an arm around his shoulders. He seemed to sense when Harry needed it most. The distress in Harry now eases at Ron’s presence.
Malfoy didn’t comment on Harry’s lack of attention or his hopelessness with non-combat charms, only enunciated the incantation for him and then lifted his wand to sketch the movement in the air.
Harry wrinkled his nose. “She can have at it.”
“This is an editorial…for the
The pale cheeks flush. “Is that an official accusation, Potter? Are you speaking for the Ministry?”
“Yes, please. Thank you.”
“Oh. Okay.”
Of course he is.
And thinking about it makes Harry’s chest constrict a little, almost like it does when his magical core pulls on his lungs, and he’s worried for a moment that it’s an attack. But it’s not. It’s just an emotion he can’t name, coming from a source within him he’d forgotten existed.
Footsteps behind him. Malfoy grabbed his arm. Harry shook it hard, but the grip tightened.
“Hey,” Harry said, a little sheepishly. He stepped closer. The Thestrals turned their white eyes to him but appeared unconcerned. “They, er, seem to like you?”
A flurry of plates and utensils and vegetables swirl around the kitchen. Draco stands in the center of the storm, hair tousled, eyes wild. It takes him a minute to notice Harry leaning in the doorway with his mouth turned up in a lopsided grin.
Harry braces himself against the weight of disappointment, and gives her a smile, though he knows it falls flat. “I understand. Thank you, Healer.”
“You’re ridiculous.” Malfoy went back to looking at the sky. Then, a few beats later, he said, “Binns.”
Malfoy flicked him a look, eyes guarded. “What business is it of yours? And how would you know?”
coffee, rich and almost chocolatey. Harry would have to stand a little closer to cast the Fitting Charm. He hoped Malfoy would say no. He wanted Malfoy to say yes.
“Is this what I was missing by sitting at the Slytherin table?” Malfoy murmured.
“Heather? Grab syrup from the back, would you?” Malfoy said, dumping coffee grounds from a machine.
“You’re getting engaged?” Harry says.
“Harry Potter and his sense of righteousness. You can’t stand to have something weighing on your conscience. Well, you’ll have to live with this one, won’t you?”
Some time later, after the connection dissipated, Harry realized something else. “You didn’t use a glamour or polyjuice.”
Draco lifted an eyebrow and settled his chin on his clasped hands. “And yet I distinctly remember you mentioning a curse a moment ago, but maybe my hearing is going along with my sanity. Please, elucidate.”
talk during sex.
Malfoy’s expression shifted. His eyes gleamed. He nodded.
Harry isn’t. But Ron looks like death warmed over, and he’s off to work. And what he needs isn’t a pain potion or water. What he needs is to talk to Hermione.
It was in that moment, as Harry had just relaxed, when Malfoy put his
He let the creature eat for half a minute before walking across the garden with it.
There was also the fact that he was sober. They’d had dinner at a fancy little seafood place, and they’d each had a glass of wine, but only one. Enough to feel comfortably warm on the way to the hotel, but now he was distressingly sober.
Harry, who didn’t know one hat from the next, waved a hand at the shelves of hats. “Have at it.”
“You know exactly what I mean.”
apparent weakness he’s focused on. Maybe it wasn’t as obvious as he thought. Maybe Harry only noticed because he knows what to watch for.
He’s here, then. In St. Mungo’s. And not in the Janus Thickey ward.
“That’s it. I’m not sending you through the floo like this. You’d just pitch onto your head on the other side. You’d fall down your own stairs. For Merlin’s sake, you’d go into your kitchen for a cup of tea and set the whole place on fire. Who knows.”
Malfoy’s cock stood up to greet him. He shot a smug look at Malfoy, who stared back with glazed eyes.
“Bloody
“Potter.”
what to do with me.”
Harry might have made a retort to that, but he was arrested by the sound of her voice. He couldn’t put his finger on what was different about it.
But Malfoy doesn’t rise to the bait, only scrutinizes Harry. Harry gazes back, raising an eyebrow and ignoring the quickening beat of his heart.
“Harry?”
Ginny spoke around a bite of her burger. “This is true. A very good business.”
“So you said you didn’t like the baking?”
Robards continues: “Possible counts of conspiracy to incite riots. The trace on his home has given us letters to friends, calls to family, and garden catalogue purchases.”
“It’s not an imposition.”
“I take back what I said earlier about you being a good person.”
“Oh. You’re both drinking something without alcohol. Are Malfoy and I the only ones drinking?”
Malfoy scrutinizes him.
He looked down at the stomach in question. “Yeah, I guess it is. Unfortunately.” He gave it a pat, and decided that it probably deserved something in it, and peeled open the bar.
“Is it?”
“True. I don’t.” He waved a hand. “Window seat?”
“Hey, Malfoy.”
Past-Malfoy asks past-Harry, “Why did you come back that day? Why did you really come?”
Those two words were so completely American, the crisp vowels Harry expected to hear lengthened, the sharp consonants softened, they sounded like someone else spoke them. He glanced at the board again. “Ham sandwich?”
Harry smiled. He kept half an eye on the menu and half on Malfoy and the way he occasionally reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes or fidget with his water glass. The fact of the matter was, he’d found Malfoy’s ranting in the car incredibly amusing, and a little bit of a turn on. Harry had wanted to lean over and kiss Malfoy’s frowning mouth more than once, which very well
“I told you,” Ron said, leaning toward the screen. “When Mum heard about what you plan with Grimmauld, she was ready to head over right then. Had her mop and everything.”
After a while, Harry lost track of the number of beers he’d had. He ordered a porter on his next go around, which elicited an impressed expression from Malfoy. With more beer, the burn of attraction became more bearable. Almost pleasant. He forgot why he’d been trying not to watch Malfoy. He liked watching Malfoy. He’d always liked watching Malfoy, hadn’t he? He’d just never noticed before how captivating it was to see Malfoy’s lips on a drink glass, his throat bobbing as he swallowed.
Frowning, eyes narrowed, Draco cast one, anyway. But when he opened the book and ran his finger along the bottom of the first page, it wasn’t a blowjob, or the startled faces of a muggle couple in a posh bed-and-breakfast room, or an old man walking by with his terrier just as Draco began to shout and shatter on the soft grass in the park. The rough little paper cutouts popped up, and they were Draco and Harry, sneering at each other across the Great Hall as owls swooped by overhead, delivering their post.
Reluctantly, Harry holds it out. He watches Malfoy’s eyes scan the page, watches the expression harden. Malfoy hands it back to him with a sneer. “Are you arresting me, Potter?”
. We’ll be happy to pick you up. You are still coming back on Saturday, right? Let us know if you plan to reschedule. You have up to 48 hours to call without a penalty charge. Ron’s been keeping an eye on Grimmauld, so you don’t have to worry about it. Molly’s even offered to start cleaning before you get back. Just basic things.”
That was it. Harry was drunk.
Harry scowled. “Of course I’ve made bread.” He didn’t add that it had been literally twenty years since he had last made any. Petunia had taught him so she could use him to help her make loaves for visits from the stuffy businessmen and their wives who Vernon was trying to impress.
Halfway through the anecdote, Malfoy reached across the table to swap his and Harry’s plate. He cut a piece of the steak without breaking the thread of his story. Harry scooped up a bite of the ham omelet Malfoy had ordered. It was good.
They sat at the bottom of the garden and drank straight from the bottles, even Malfoy, though Harry had remembered to bring a glass for him.
“You know,” Ron said casually, stabbing up a bit of chow mein. “Bill’s wrapped up in a project for the next couple of weeks. I’m sure he’ll be happy to come over after that.”
The sympathy and amusement quickly dry up, however.
Luna gave him a smile, pushed between one extravagant fur coat and an orange knit jumper, and disappeared inside. A moment later, her voice drifted out to him, muffled and as if from a distance: “Come on, Harry. It’s like Platform 9 & 3/4.”
Malfoy turned, drying his hands in a towel. “Have Ginny and Luna shown you around any more of the city yet?”
Malfoy sneered. “Yes, you did.” Then he raised his wand, stabbed it towards Harry. “
Minister Shacklebolt recovers first. “Mr. Potter. What fortunate timing you have. Please sit. This does concern you.”
“Let’s see,” Draco murmured, and Harry couldn’t be sure if he said it out loud or in his mind.

“Would seem like.”
“That’s enough, I think,” she said when they met up near the greenhouse at the far edge of the clearing. “We’re running low on Sleeping Draught.”
“Er—”
] for being my sensitivity reader. Friend, I so adore and appreciate you.)
“Good.”
She dropped her bag onto the table. Harry blanched as she pulled several potion bottles from inside and plonked them down.
“Writing quills for trolls.”
Malfoy bit his lip. Suddenly, he seemed so fragile there beneath Harry. Harry leaned down on one arm, pressed a kiss to Malfoy’s mouth, and slid his other hand down to tease around Malfoy’s hole the way Malfoy had done to him—circling, circling, brushing over his entrance. He had the urge to taste Malfoy down there, but it wasn’t what Malfoy had asked for, so he traced his finger around and watched Malfoy’s eyes flutter closed.
“Behold,” Malfoy said, opening a thick metal door. “My walk-in fridge.”
One of the smaller Thestrals curved its neck to preen one leathery wing.
Ginny casually chewed on her thumbnail. “You were there awful late.”
— Don’t touch those,” Draco snapped, and then quieted his voice. “They’re poisonous. Terrible rash.”
“All right.”
“Must—must be.”
Malfoy’s mouth tightens. “Potter. To what do I owe this pleasure?”
surprised.” She stepped forward to take Harry’s hand, and—like earlier—threaded her fingers between his. He looked down at their hands.
“So,” Harry said. “I’d like to say I’m surprised.”
when I’m stressed. I blame it on you.”
Malfoy. He was nearly successful—he felt the other man’s grasp weaken—then Malfoy turned liquid and rippled around him, came together again, slippery as an eel.
Potter stared stonily back. “This is difficult enough as it is, Malfoy.”
Malfoy gave him a suspicious look. “Typically, yes.”
“No. Merlin. Dammit.” Harry smothers his face with his hands. “I’m just— I was given an incomplete file on you, Malfoy. And don’t ask me why I’m even telling you this, except that I feel like I got landed in a tank of shit without a wand, and I hate being used, even if it
“Thank you, Potter.”
“Yes! We have to show you the local breweries. We need to get started if we’re going to try all of them while you’re here.”
A blink. “No.” Malfoy began to close the door, but Harry took Ginny’s advice and jammed his foot in the way.
“Well?” Luna said.
“Sure,” he says, trying to ignore the way the hairs on the nape of his neck stand up as Malfoy leans forward again to look at the mirror, an elegant slender form in the corner of his vision. He shakes with a sudden shiver, and grey eyes break from the surface of the mirror to appraise Harry.
Harry goes a little boneless. He leans against the table, letting it take his weight.
Harry holds up two fingers.
“Don’t—ah. I wouldn’t let Teddy read those till he’s out of Hogwarts.”
“Thanks.” He accepts the mirror from her. “Remember the case file on Malfoy I was waiting for clearance on? Yeah. That. It finally arrived in my inbox.”
But Malfoy was already measuring a new set of ingredients.
I wasn’t obliviated. Who would do that to me? Malfoy just said he didn’t successfully cast a spell on me. Malfoy, did
He moved around the kitchen, preparing soup and a slice of cheese from the wheel Heather had given him earlier. When he reached for bread to go with the cheese, he remembered he was out and grimaced.
Malfoy pinched his lips, narrowed his eyes.
Harry blinked. “Huh?”
His pulse races. He pushes a hand through his hair. “Has there been a hearing yet? Or has he just talked to the aurors?”
He turned, though he knew he was already too late. He stumbled on the uneven surface, and suddenly the sharp rocks were rising toward him. Shouts went up behind him. He braced himself for impact, but then—a foot from the barnacle-crusted ground—he was caught as if by a giant invisible hand. Then Malfoy was hauling him up by the scruff of his shirt.
“Come on, then. We’ll get you fed.”
“I thought I’d find you in here,” Draco says.
Harry was nearly crying from pleasure. He couldn’t control the sounds. Malfoy moaned in wicked imitation of him and dug his nails in, bright points of pain-pleasure against Harry’s arse.
“Uh-oh,” Junior Auror Diana said, stopping at the threshold of his cubicle. “I don’t like that expression.”
“Yeah. Fine,” Harry says, pouring himself another glass. He catches Hermione eyeing the glass, so he only fills it a third of the way before setting the bottle back down. Alcohol doesn’t set the thing off, he’s told her. But Hermione…is Hermione, and it’s easier to limit his alcohol consumption than wage silent war with her all night. Anyway, he really
“All right.” He knew Draco didn’t mean it, but there was a flutter of anxiety in his stomach, anyway, because—he’d thought it was cute at the time, but maybe it was stupid, after all. Gifts like these were all right for kids, which Draco wasn’t. But Harry thought—
So Harry kept his memories and his knowledge, though he wasn’t allowed to share this information with the rest of his team. Which frustrated him, because it was important for the investigation; he’d be continuing with his legs hobbled. He hated the lies.
Draco grins. “You mean other than you having your hand on my back, and glowering fiercely at her for treating me like she did?” He shrugs. “It isn’t as if I didn’t expect this to be how I would be treated here. People have a hard time forgiving, and seeing me walk free is not easy for many.”
How could he fix this? Or was it too late?
“Yes Miss Parkinson, and no you will not be able to switch partners. You will learn to dance with the person the hat deems the best fit for you. I will also ask you to pick a song and perform this at the end of the year fest, it does not have to be longer than 3 minutes, but it will be your choice and I will help you with the choreography. The first classes will focus on basic steps, but we will start on your individual projects after Christmas break. So now let’s start with the assignment. Why don’t you step up, Miss Parkinson.”
"Hello, Harry, I wanted to let you know how the replacement wand is working so far."
“Not only dances, it looks like they are flying without brooms.”
“So that means I don’t have to sleep on the sofa tonight? Because I will.”
Harry took a deep breath. "I know I messed up, I am not used to being loved for myself and my instinctive reaction was to draw back, to question everything because I don't have luck in love. And..."
Andromeda had just looked at him, and that had been the end of it. By now he spends almost the entirety of his time in Andromeda’s cottage, working on the estate and his correspondence course. Playing with Teddy when he is awake and putting him to bed when he is getting tired.
He kept walking for a bit further when a subtle smell filled his nostrils. Woodsy, and a bit of fresh cut grass, it was the smell he always associated with Harry, who loved to be outside. He missed Potter and maybe it was time to reach out. When he finally reached his favourite picnic spot, the sight that greeted him, caught him between laughter and incredulity.
"I am glad you think so. I am to understand, that you have become friends with my son?" Narcissa Malfoy had never been someone to beat around the bush, when it suited her interest.
It’s easy for her to say that reaching out to Andromeda would be the best thing. But how does one go about approaching a relative that one has never seen before? Her name had not even been spoken before the war.
"Well I do have a job, you know?" Draco answered. "So you plan on coming by at Maman Valerie's place every day?"
“Andy?” he calls out cautiously.
Draco carefully took a wand out of its holster and Harry held his breath. He knew the wand, knew it well and the vibes he felt were all kinds of wrong, there was no other way to describe it.
"Yes, Tibby showed me the book. It is so strange, if my wand were made not from Holly it might not even have come to this!"
A soft prodding reminds me, that Lucy still demands attention and I continue the soothing motion. Truth be told I don't have a clue how long I sit and pet this friendly dog, but after a while my cheeks feel wet. I don't even try to wipe the tears away, instead allowing myself the luxury of grief without being judged. Every time I halt the stroking motion, Lucy turns towards me and whines softly or nudges my hand.
“Hm, I was stubborn, but I knew that she was right, so after five days of stewing in my room, I hiked up into the mountains and screamed until I was hoarse.” Draco blinked and turned towards Harry. “After that I felt dead inside as well. As if all of that anger had just drained away and all of a sudden there was nothing left.”
“It was all me?” he finally whispers.
“Just leave me alone for a bit. I can’t talk to you right now.” With that he is out of the door, and Draco is left alone feeling empty and lost.
Harry's world falls apart on a Thursday afternoon. He has just finished the last reports for Kingsley, about the magical outbursts occurring in England, when the Patronus appears in his house.
"Yes, it reacts very sluggish. Sometimes not at all." It was barely a whisper coming out of his mouth. In his mind he hears his father's voice telling him to 'speak up, for heaven sake'.
"Draco I never said, we had to go all the way!" Harry was horrified. "I would like to be with you, yes, but I would never force you to do something you are not ready for!"
“Nobody ever?” It is a whisper and there is something so sad in these two words that Harry just holds up his hand to stop Draco from talking, because who is he kidding, after this night Draco knows too much to ever be just Malfoy again. But if he encounters pity, he will not be able to finish what he is trying to say, and he needs to get it out.
"Don't push it. Keep talking." But Draco's thumb stroked over the back of his hand, belying his short answer.
“Hey, Potter.” Draco breathes deeply as he approaches Harry in the common room that night.
"Give me a second Pig." He gave the little owl a couple of treats, which were gobbled up happily. Then he took some parchment and started to write.
Pansy has been crying. She tries to hide it, but the soft sheen over her eyes and the slight redness of her upturned nose, are giving her away. When he steps up to her, she averts her face from him.
Draco looked at the distraught man, and felt a rush of protectiveness. "Trust me, Harry, you are anything but an Idiot."
"No." The clear grey eyes focused fully on him again. "No she didn't. She listened and let me cry. I hadn't been able to mourn before. I realised when she asked me if I wanted to stay for a while and learn how to make Cari, and other foods from her, that I had found a place where I could just be me and not be judged by the past. As I said before I have French roots so I speak the language and money has never been an issue. With mom gone and father in Azkaban, I had no one to come home to, so I stayed and worked through the pain."
"You have never been to
“Well, why not?” Harry turns towards him fully “I missed you, I know you don’t want to hear it, but when you just disappeared…” he trails off, not wanting to put even more pressure on the other man. He doesn’t say that he loved Draco back then, because what good would it do to open the wounds. And he is over it, at least he keeps telling himself that.
* Healing *
“I am so sorry! You must think me terribly rude. What did you ask me?” His face feels aflame and she laughs freely.
"The wands are still loyal to their previous owners. But Harry, why additional components?"
Just when Draco has come to accept that life for him will never be truly warm again, something changes.
I am angry at myself for the outburst, but when I feel her arms around me for the first time in ages, I dare not to breathe. Too afraid am I that she will let go again.
Coming back to Hogwarts should have felt safe. But when the carriages bring them back to the castle and he realises just how many of the young children can see the thestrals, how many of them have seen death, he only feels sorrow and bitterness.
In the morning he finds that he has slept deeply that night.
So, he tried to let her go gently, feeling overwhelmed by her tears, and he tried to explain it as best as he could. But she didn’t understand the chill that had settled into his very core.
“Well I will try and take the Owl Course for NEWTs that the Ministry is offering. Rumour has it that Potter is never going back to Hogwarts either.”
Instead of a verbal answer Harry presses his lips to Draco's and even though he would later deny it, Draco moans softly at the sensations that assault him.
A long pause. "Yes," Malfoy says. And then he rubs the back of his neck in the same way when he lied to Harry in the Room of Requirement, claiming that their first time meant nothing to him.
Fuck, he might've underestimated Potter's size.
"Based on what you told me about his conversation with the blond man, he's got a reason to help you, doesn't he?" Bacon points out, cutting through Harry's confused thoughts.
"I would call this
With that, he had promptly stepped over the hole and returned to his office, leaving a flabbergasted Malfoy in his wake.
Grey eyes sharpen, chasing away the afterglow of sex.
“Oh?” Malfoy shifts from his kneeling position and lays down on his side beside Harry. His hand glides up and down Harry’s chest, the back of his fingers trailing across his chest hair, and his fingertips rubbing his nipples in a maddeningly slow touch. His hand slides to Harry’s abdomen, before returning to his chest, driving Harry’s anticipation to fever pitch. His heart is beating so fast that he won’t be surprised if Malfoy can feel every thud of his heartbeat under his wandering fingers.
George inches away from Harry (the drizzle falling on Harry is getting heavier) and clears his throat.
Malfoy shrugged casually — a little bit too casually — "
Potter glances at the table, at a rather crumpled book titled
"He could just ask me!"
"Glad for a change, I reckon," Draco says, settling on a more neutral reply.
"Well, he's got good taste then," Draco says, preening. He looks at the snake, whose head is flicking back and forth between the both of them as if trying to follow the conversation. "But why? He barely knows anything about me."
Harry closes his eyes briefly, fighting a wave of emotion as he recalls his words penned on paper.
, and I hope that you've enjoyed it!
Malfoy drops his head in the crook of Harry's neck and licks a strip of skin from collarbone to ear. "Say it again," he growls, eliciting a full-body shudder from Harry. "I've always wanted to hear you say it like that. Not like this, but I'll take whatever I can get. Say it!"
"It's our first date, so I thought flowers would be nice. Just don't expect this next time," he teases, bumping his shoulder against Draco's.
Draco's body trembles as he sobs, his tears soaking Harry's shoulder.
"Your desserts remind me of home," Malfoy says as he fiddles with the edges of a menu, both of them resolutely not looking at each other. "Of my childhood. Of bright blue skies and summer sunshine, of afternoon tea-times in the Manor pavilions with my father and of entire days spent baking with my mother," he whispers, smiling sadly.
Draco emerges from the shower, and as he dresses, he eyes the drawer where the mag is waiting for him. He’ll indulge in a nice, slow wank with it before bed tonight, and try his best to ignore the fact that the object of his affections is a mere fifteen minute walk away.
At Hermione's blunt words, Draco's eyes widen, before he looks away from her. On guard, he puts his cutlery down and dabs his lips with his napkin, thinking fast. His gaze flickers towards a rather fit blond bloke at the next table, and he indicates the stranger with his chin.
"Well, if that's the case, I'll spend the week finishing my orders and close the shop until then."
“I thought we were going for your birthday dinner? If you told me you were going to have a date with a pile of cut vegetables and fruits, I think Harry would be sorely disappointed,” Hermione says.
, as hard as the thumping bassline blasting from the speakers.
He saves the bar for his last stop — God, even the bartender is fit as hell here. Someone calls out the bartender's name and orders a drink. Harry shamelessly checks out
Hermione blinks in surprise. "Thank you."
And a part of Harry loved it.
Malfoy shivers at the promise in Harry's voice, and he raises an arm, tucking his hand underneath his head as he watches Harry roll the tube of lube between his palms, warming it. "Go slow."
"I daresay he wants you as much as you want him. And he's got such a kink for our language. Did you see?" she asks, and Harry nods.
"No, we've got too much time to make up for," Draco says, shaking his head. "So you'd better start thinking of places you want to go to." He leans forward to kiss Harry on the forehead, but Harry captures his lips in a demanding kiss instead.
"Thank you. Roses like these deserve to be shown off." Draco smiles, rubbing a smooth, damp petal between his fingertips. The scent of the flowers is fresh and earthy, and he wonders where Potter got them. When he makes no move to shrink them, Potter's grin grows.
It's Christmas.
As the weeks pass, Potter showers Draco with thoughtful gifts such as a box of his favourite tea, quills with special ink-erasing feathers and his favourite caramel nougats from Honeydukes. The small presents matched none of the showiness of the roses that started it all, except for…
No one's ever touched Draco like this before — his previous lovers have all ignored those scars, and by extension — Draco's past.
threaten to tumble from Draco's lips. He finds himself daydreaming more about Harry when his mind idles.
“Oh,” Harry says, feigning surprise, as he isn’t supposed to know about this, if not for Marjorie’s slip of tongue. “D’you write your own music?”
I'm especially grateful to Mollie, who did such a brilliant job as my beta-reader. She was also the one who provided the prompt that inspired this piece.
"To the happy couple!" they shout and clink their glasses, dissolving into a raucous chorus of cheers and whoops. Firewhiskey sloshes over the rim of Harry's pint, and he looks at everyone crowding the booth in the Leaky—all the Gryffindors in their year, along with some Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws. It's brilliant seeing everyone together. The last time Harry saw some of them was when he was still at Hogwarts. He returned from Istanbul two days ago, and he'll be leaving for Berlin two days after the wedding.
At Malfoy's stricken expression, Harry freezes. He's no doubt thinking about the Auror training when they practised their Patronus Charms, and Malfoy was the only one who failed. He stormed out, humiliated and distraught.
"What?" Malfoy and Ron squawk in unison.
When they’re under a street lamp, Harry sneaks a glance at Malfoy’s hair, which is an unsurprisingly unnatural inky black. Harry has dark hair too, but his hair has shades of brown, especially under lights. Malfoy’s hair is short, like sixth year of Hogwarts, and once again, it's bloody disconcerting seeing Malfoy as a brunet. Harry tugs absently on his own messy hair — he has kept it longer, like his fourth year.
Draco expects Potter to ask him about it, but instead, he looks away, busying himself with paddling around in the water. Minutes tick by, and Draco’s hands clench on the seat of the tub, before relaxing. He exhales, swiping away the cobweb of secrets within him with a jittery hand, and lugs out the truth.
They filled the days doing loads of things: feeding and playing with Charlie’s animals and Pork Chop in the Forest (Harry took great joy in re-enacting Malfoy screaming and running away during their detention in first year); exploring the castle and her many secrets; playing Quidditch and football (he will always remember the sight of a dishevelled Malfoy trying to kick a football, but instead falling on his bum); and introducing Malfoy to new things. It was brilliant, watching his wariness turn into surprised wonder at his first bite of butter chicken from
A silence, thick with expectation, crackles in the air.
Harry's hands clench on his beer.
“Not half, not two-thirds. Every single inch of that big, hard, thick cock all in me, yes?” Draco says, punctuating each word with a sharp roll of his hips, rubbing said cock along his cleft.
Next Saturday can't come fast enough.
They’ve danced around the line in the sand, toeing it and tempting fate, but tonight, they’ve finally crossed it.
Draco beams with affection at the memory and returns his attention to the recorder. Harry is such a sappy git; no doubt it's filled with the sweet nothings he loves to say and Draco pretends to dislike. Still smiling, Draco dims the lights, fluffs up his pillows and tucks himself in bed, his chest against the sheets and left cheek pressed on his pillow. He presses the play button, rests the recorder on the pillow and closes his eyes.
“Yes. Thank you.” Malfoy slings his guitar across his back.
"Someone's sick, alright, but it's not anyone back home." Charlie summons a letter with a Romanian stamp. "I'm leaving straight for the sanctuary tonight. Gotta pack up, instruct the house elves to feed my animals for hols, and then Portkey out. Lucky I've no classes tomorrow."
“The boys lost their collective minds, as you can imagine. I sent her straight out to change, but she didn’t want to, so… long story short, I confiscated her clothes. Although I should throw it out, eh, a bit strange to keep bras around the place.” Harry gestures to the wardrobe. “Sometimes kids lose interest, but they don’t know what to do with the clothes. If they don’t want them anymore, I keep it for others. I think this would be most suitable.” He withdraws a set of grey long-sleeved sweatshirt and sweatpants — clothes that show the least skin — and a pair of running shoes.
Along with scores of tourists, he took Tram 28 to the São Jorge Castle. He stumbled on
"I have a surprise for you," Malfoy teases, rustling the paper bag just out of his reach. Harry makes a grab for it, but Malfoy steps away just in time. Harry heaves his shoulders in disappointment and sexual frustration.
"I shall see you this time next year, then," Draco says. This is their first meeting at Draco's office in Hogwarts, just before the start-of-term feast.
Pleasantly surprised, Draco grins. He quickly types a reply, but Potter sends another text.
Ron stops dancing and stares at Harry. "Mate, I wouldn't call him charming or handsome. That's all you."
In return, Potter puts his hand on top of Draco's, and squeezes back.
Pansy Parkinson sent Harry an owl yesterday, containing her name and only three words.
A breeze rustles the leaves above. The weather is brilliant for late September — cheerful puffball clouds scudding in the azure blue skies. Golden shards of sunlight sifts through the spreading branches overhead, casting shifting shadows on the grass.
Harry has never been this pale before.
And then Draco Malfoy had appeared, fingernail tapping against the glass of his favourite green drink, lips stained with cherry glaze and his eyebrow arched in query while his gaze raked Harry up and down.
Instead, he’s been on his toes the entire night for the perfect opening — a comment from Malfoy about the cold weather, to which Harry had said rather shyly, "Come back to mine? I can keep you warm if you'd like."
That was the night when Draco stopped dreaming in
He turns around and looks at Grimmauld Place, his breaths short and shallow, his nerves bristling with every second he remains in this stifling house.
For a long time, that was Draco's last memory of Harry — standing opposite him in the Tower in the middle of the night, his eyes midnight with sadness, shoulders slumped in resignation and clutching something behind his back.
Draco's gaze falls on a familiar penknife on the counter. He has seen Potter use it before, and it came up in conversation once.
and Draco has never felt anything like this, this pushing-pulling thrusting
Malfoy's eating a chocolate fairy cake — it had taken Harry a bloody long time to tweak that particular pastry to perfection. Instead of filling it with milk chocolate, he had replaced it with white chocolate, giving it a rather striking contrast to the dark chocolate exterior of the fairy cake, a contrast like the chocolate smeared all over Malfoy's pale chin and the skin around his mouth. This is the most unkempt that Harry's ever seen him, but he doesn't really mind it that much, especially when... bloody hell... Malfoy starts sucking on a finger.
Hermione smiles. "See what I mean? He's still getting used to having you around. You were gone for a year, Harry, you can't expect things to pick up just like how you left it. He's confused about how to act around you, curious about what happened to you—"
Draco exhales heavily. “Stupid thing to fixate on. A bloody traffic light.”
Zabini merely arches an eyebrow and drums his fingertips against the table, his family ring glittering as it catches the light.
Malfoy's wearing nothing but his shirt with the hem twisted around his hips; long, long legs spread apart invitingly on the rumpled bedsheets, toes clenched in pleasure, hand pumping up and down on that delicious cock, Harry wants to shove that hand away and take Malfoy in his mouth-
That’s the way Draco always wants it to be.
on his jersey. "Yeah, Potter. I'll go out with you this Saturday."
He doesn’t know whether to punch a wall or dissolve into tears of frustration.
Harry’s hands squeeze Malfoy’s arse as he sucks, the weight of Malfoy’s heavy cock gliding along his tongue, hitting the back of his throat. The air is filled with slurping sounds and strangled moans, and soon, Harry’s neck and jaw starts to ache, but he doesn’t stop, too eager to give Malfoy the first sixty-nine of his life.
New York City is a sprawl of dazzling lights and flashy skyscrapers, the sparkling continuity of the lights stretching as far as the eye can see, interrupted only by the Hudson River and East River framed at the edges of the breath-taking scene. There’s the Chrysler Building, and another building with a glowing red “H&M” on it. Harry inches closer to the safety barricade, gazing down. Although it’s almost midnight, there’s still a steady flow of traffic. Every car on the street, every light in each building represents people going about their daily lives, and it’s strange how that realisation makes Harry feel alive, yet small and insignificant at the same time. Right now, he’s not the Saviour, nor is he the Boy-Who-Lived.
— can be the only one to pleasure Potter.
"I've been wanting to fuck you for so long, too long. Trust me, when I've gotten you all ready and waiting, that's the last thing you gotta worry 'bout," Potter growls, a low, thoroughly
Not tonight.
For some reason, Hermione's pulled out her wallet, and Ron's got a shit-eating grin on his face.
An electric smile breaks out on Draco's face, and Harry kisses that gorgeous smile all over again, starbursts of happiness radiating in him when he realises that in Draco's quietly devoted way, he's carved Harry's name in blueberry kisses all over his own heart.
, Potter's lips slightly chapped against his. Draco wastes no time in deepening the kiss, pouring all his desperation, sexual attraction and worry into the kiss. Potter smiles, and it's utter perfection, almost as fiery as the sudden surge of heat on Draco's right—
Draco cries out with need. With his heart pounding, he realises what Harry's going to do and he's suddenly so desperate for it-
“Oh,” Potter says, gulping.
"Yeah?” Harry says. A corner of his lips hike up into the beginnings of a smirk, but before he can say anything else, the arrival of Hedwig stops him short. She whistles at Harry and tilts her head towards the direction of the other owls.
"Wow," Harry says in awe and wonder, his eyes glued to the ring. He turns it this way and that, smiling when the gems sparkle.
Malfoy's gaze drop to Harry's eyes. "It doesn't matter what colour your eyes are, you've always had that intense stare, like how you look like when we're fighting. When you eat, your drink's always on your left — doesn't matter whether it's wine or pumpkin juice — and your main meal in the middle and dessert —
Now, Draco can’t stop.
Harry divides his attention equally between his arse and cock, faltering only when Malfoy’s arms begin to tremble and his gasps become increasingly high-pitched, more swears spilling from his posh mouth. Harry then focuses on Malfoy's prick, engulfing it in his mouth, relaxing his throat to take him deep. Malfoy's legs fall to the bed when Harry swirls his tongue around the shaft and sucks hard, just the way he likes it.
"No, don't stop, please! It'll be fine, just... don't stop!" Potter demands. Draco continues, but he's studying Potter's features. Potter's cheeks are flushed a lovely pink, his eyes are closed and he's breathing in short, sharp pants, but he doesn't seem to be in pain.
He took Charlie’s advice to spend some time and space away from Malfoy and the castle, and this only shows that yes, he really fancies Malfoy. Like a man on a mission, Harry returns to his room, his jaw tightening in determination and his steps sure and brisk.
Potter looks up from the pan and smiles at Draco — just like how he had smiled at him last night — Draco's heart starts beating in double-quick time.
“It will. It has to,” Harry says desperately, opening his legs to grant Malfoy more space to kneel between them. This isn’t a dream. It’s really happening, right here, right now. He’s seconds away from having his cock sucked by Malfoy. “Please. Don’t make me wait. Been so long.”
Draco cries out when Harry's cock hardens even more in him. He's not gonna stop this punishing pace and, fuck, he's going at it so hard and fast, fucking Draco to oblivion. "Bit more, please don't stop, Harry, please!"
care," Bacon replies sulkily.
"You're healthy. She's healthy. That's all that matters," he says, clasping her hand.
Pansy... well... she had thoroughly enjoyed herself. "Yeah, Potter, do it like that. That's how he likes it," she had growled under her breath as she watched Potter reach with both hands to grab Draco's arse.
Potter comes with a wail.
He’d give Draco a part of his own rainbow just to be with him forever.
Harry hears Pink Floyd’s music — his own album that Malfoy's supposed to return — and he greedily soaks in the sight of Malfoy in his crisp white uniform; streaks of flour all the way up to his elbows with his fingers sunken into a ball of dough. Again, he finds his eyes hooked to Malfoy's fancy uniform, reminding Harry of his stupid posh French school, which leads to images of black-haired lovers feeding him cheese and peeled grapes and chocolate, romancing him in French and probably... fanning him in bed with gigantic palm fans or something equally over-the-top. He's jealous of anyone who's ever laid hands on Malfoy, possessive about Malfoy's summer laughs and secret smiles.
Potter laughs, a short, scoffing laugh. He opens his mouth to say something, but appears to change tack. He gestures to the hotel suite.
Harry wonders why he can't look away from Malfoy's throat.
Bloody hell, that was the most depressing pep talk that Harry's ever heard.
"Please..." Potter murmurs and moves his hips so that Draco's palm is directly over his erection. A lightning-bolt of urgent lust judders through Draco when he cups Potter's cock. He snarls, undoing the button of Potter's jeans and tugging the zipper down with deft fingers. He snakes his hand inside Potter's jeans and strokes his length. Grey eyes light up with gratification when Potter moans and begins to thrust into his hand.
Harry arches a brow and accepts it. "Where did you get this? Is it one of your products in your Potions mail-order business?"
at the finishing line, where Potter declared himself the winner by sketching a rough doodle of two stick figures. One figure has a lightning-bolt scar and spiky hair shaded black with ink, its arms raised in triumph and standing on a pile of treacle tarts, while the other figure is freckled and scowling.
Draco catapults up to a sitting position on the bed, with a growing sense of unease.
Scene 1 “Harry roots”: HOME
“Oh,” Malfoy murmurs, startled, when they pause at a spot that Harry is familiar with — when the weather is pleasant, he goes for a swim and stops here, where he would launch into his exercises. If he doesn’t have an early class, he’ll finish with a run.
He takes the dive.
look good together, you mean," Harry says, grinning.
Harry takes a deep breath. "When I was in Osaka, I learnt about the legend of the red thread of fate. It mentions an invisible red string that starts from our heart and goes all the way to our finger." He glances at Malfoy's last finger. "It stretches beyond our bodies, finally intertwining with someone else's red thread. Someone important, bound to you by fate. Someone who has a heartfelt effect on your life.”
"Oh." Harry grabs a pillow and fiddles with the corners. "I left at eight." Despite himself, there's a thread of hope winding around his heart. Silence settles between them. He continues toying with the pillow, while Malfoy looks around the guest room, his hands clenched on his knees in apparent tension. Harry asks after his father.
"Melbourne," Harry says.
“Heh.” Harry glows at the praise. “I could say the same about you.”
This is the first thing Harry sees every morning when he wakes up.
When the music hits its climax, Harry runs towards the end of the stage, drops down to his knees, brings his hands up to the top of his white singlet, holds on tight and...
The night sky is mottled black and blue like a bruise. It reminds Draco of sadness, a sort of wide, all-encompassing sadness — as if a piece of inky gossamer silk had been hung over the heavens. A thin, filmy smog of a cloud shifts, exposing a full moon. Shards of moonlight glimmer on a spare pair of Harry's glasses resting on Draco's palm.
There’s a lull of expectation in the air.
Whenever Harry needs a holiday, Ron is always his go-to person to look after the bakery. The next best person is Hermione, but if she's busy, then well, the point of the matter is that Harry has no shortage of friends he can turn to.
This is one of the memories that Harry keeps particularly close to him, because that was the day that he fell hopelessly, irrevocably and madly in love with Draco. For Draco to quote from that day...
Malfoy's cheeks bloom with colour, and he lowers his arms behind his back, hiding the tart. "Nothing, that wasn't anything."
The lines of tension on Potter's shoulders ease at once, and his face relaxes into an open smile.
He’ll never go back to
“Here we are,” Potter repeats, his gaze catching onto a single raindrop trickling down the side of Draco’s face.
"What the hell is your problem, Malfoy? I've done nothing to deserve this shit attitude from you." A familiar fiery gleam enters narrowed green eyes, and Draco's heartbeat ramps up.
Harry grins at Draco, and there's a mischievous glint in his eye that Draco knows very well.
, even better than Draco's dozens of fantasies 'cos this is real and he can feel the heat radiating off Potter's body and Potter sounds… he sounds amazing, all soft breathy moans and gasps-
Harry grabs another ball, throws it up into the air and catches it. "I kinda got over you eventually and saw other people, but none of them worked out." He pauses in tossing the ball and looks at Draco. "And then you re-appeared again, and it felt just like old times. Like… like you belonged in my life, y'know?"
"Fuck, Harry, don't do this to me again, fuckin' hell, move!"
It's fucking surreal, like he'd missed a step going down the stairs.
— after tonight, he simply can't.
Pork Chop lifts her head up from his chest briefly, before plonking back down in a show of exasperation. "You've got it wrong, you great big knob."
"Yes, she said it's all very hush-hush. According to Pansy, there has to be at least two people applying at the same time, so she told me to ask the staff if two of us could join."
And lust.
"I've eaten Canary Creams before, so it's alright." Potter frowns. "Hey, why does this taste so—"
Even though Draco loves Quidditch, he's keen to explore other types of journalism, especially International, and he’s hoping that his next posting will allow him to delve deeper into this new field. Journalism suits him, and he enjoys meeting people and building useful connections during events, interviews and networking meetings, but there’s something that makes it difficult for him sometimes—his Dark Mark.
"Tell it to someone who cares."
"I…" Malfoy trails off, looking equally rattled. "I'm unsure if you are aware, but I'm working at Slug and Jiggers, Potions research and development." He pauses, eyes darting behind Harry, before he continues in a hurry, as if there’s a time limit to their conversation. "We supply potions and healing salves to the Ministry. We're hoping to partner with the Spanish Ministry too, so my boss received an invitation for tonight. He fell sick yesterday, so I took a last-minute Portkey to replace him."
"Don't you turn it around on me," Harry snarls, his muscles going rigid and a familiar heat flushing through his body. "You didn't chase her. Instead, you smiled at me and stayed with me. With me," he says, touching his own chest. "If you really wanted to patch things up with her, you'd be with her now, not wallowing alone like this!"
"Let me have her, dear," Molly says. Draco stands up to deposit Rose in her grandmother's arms and turns back to Hermione.
The tip of Harry's quill scratches through the parchment.
He’s popping a stiffy, and his shorts won’t conceal anything. Panic mounting, Harry casually rests his wrist against his groin, hoping to cover it, while he brisk-walks back to the front. He bends over and stretches his right calf.
“Your father just stood there and watched as I ran for my life with Cedric’s… Cedric’s body and I… I watched him die! Oh my God, I watched him die,” Harry’s voice is nothing but a mere croak. He turns away from Draco and squeezes the sides of the bridge so hard that his hands tremble and his knuckles turn white.
Potter jogs over to him. “Hey.”
Harry’s breath hitches. "What did Smith want?"
"Hell, if people wanted to know how their old school-mates were doing, an owl would've been enough, not having him up your arse in your first meeting in years. You never did things by halves." He polishes off his apple and chucks the core in the bin. There's an amused twinkle in Oliver's eyes. Harry cards his fingers through his hair.
Harry knows that he's not talking about the Horntail.
Harry nods, putting Malfoy out of his mind. "Just exam stress."
Malfoy is the man for him.
They take a few moments to pull themselves together.
"I obtained it from your secretary. I told her there was a problem with the Galleons deducted from my vaults. I lied, obviously, I just wanted to come and see you," he replies. His words are sleek and rehearsed, as if he's said these exact words out loud a few times.
"She loves travelling by train; she likes the view, and the vibrations make her sleepy," Potter says, a fond smile on his face as he gazes affectionately at the Ashwinder.
"Yes, I've... noticed." Malfoy takes a step closer, looking at him with concern. "Are you sure you're alright?"
Potter was at the height of his flying career; young and fit, he could've earned more riches and fame by playing for better-paying clubs and supporting endorsements. Instead, what did he do?
it's the recorder... while Draco's mouth is busy sucking Harry off like his cock is a goddamn Honeydukes lollipop, the recorder is detailing everything that he's doing.
He glances at Ron and Hermione dancing. Despite his wanderlust, the thought of leaving Britain again, of leaving them, is more difficult than he'd expected.
while doing it-
Potter immediately blushes.
He lets the message loop as he casts a distant stare at the East River through the mesh.
He wishes he was holding his hand instead.
He casts a lingering gaze at the padlocks, and then gives Draco a meaningful look.
“Fuck yes,” Harry hisses, stroking Malfoy’s hole with a finger while his other hand resumes squeezing his arse. God, to ease himself into this tight warmth, his prick disappearing into Malfoy’s body… It’s Malfoy on top of him, Malfoy’s lips wrapped around him, Malfoy’s lush arse cupped in his greedy hands and his clenching hole just begging to be fucked—
They look at each other gleefully, before collapsing into a fit of raucous giggles.
She nods. Although there's a shimmer of tears at the corners of her eyes, she's smiling.
But he has so many more reasons to stay.
"It's alright. Everyone, except Dean, was surprised when I enrolled into art school after Hogwarts, so really, no offence taken," Harry says. He wonders how much he should tell Malfoy. Sighing, he presses his palms flat on the bench, and gazes at the flurry of traffic and pedestrians below them, and at the construction works on the street. The gardens are a welcome respite from the jarring rush of crowds, cars and concrete. He closes his eyes, turning his face to the sun.
Fuck, he'll do anything Potter wants.
Their eyes meet, and once again, that same unanswered question hangs in the air between them.
"Good. Because I was hoping that
Draco picks one ring from the air, leaving the other floating. He rests it on his palm. The rings are customisable, in both band design, gem type, and width. He's crafted a suitable pattern for Harry: a simple sterling silver ring studded with the gems lying next to each other.
Startled, Draco blinks. "A no to what?" The minute the words come out, he gets it, a second too late.
“I’m tired of fighting,” Potter says.
Malfoy cards his fingers through his messy hair in an attempt to tidy it. He runs a hand over his stubble, fingertips skimming over the dark circles under his eyes.
"Draco."
“Yes, so hot, need you, oh fuck,” Malfoy gasps when Harry’s palm glides smoothly up his prick, before he twists his wrist at the head, exactly how he likes it. Merlin, it’s a fucking treat seeing Malfoy like this, an out-of-control, begging mess beneath him, turned on beyond belief. Harry kisses behind Malfoy’s ear and prepares to seduce him in Parseltongue—
Harry advances towards Draco, his shoulders squared, green eyes blazing and his focus centred entirely on Draco. He makes a sweeping motion with a hand, and Draco’s bag flies out of his grasp and crashes to the other side of the room.
Sighing, Draco rubs his face. He shouldn’t have come out to the field tonight; even though it’s one of the warmer evenings, it’s still too cold for flying. He’s just about to descend when an Illuminated Golden Snitch darts across his vision.
This is probably the perfect time for Harry to be all subtle and seductive by shimmying over to Malfoy and whispering breathy things, but fuck it.
"You always are," Draco says, looking away from her at his memories of their Hogwarts days. "Always have been.”
And for now, that is more than enough.
Damn, Malfoy's as smooth as his chocolate.
Draco looks at Humphrey, who's happily chomping on his treats.
Harry whispers Draco's name. When he turns, Harry pulls him into a dreamy kiss that ignites his senses into a slow burn. He tastes a tinge of hot chocolate on Draco's tongue, he feels the soft caress of Draco's lips — slightly chapped from the winter cold — against his own. When Draco's lips turn up into a smile halfway into the kiss, Harry shifts on the park bench to pull him closer.
"What? Out in the sun? You grumbled like hell whenever we went for Care of Magical Creatures!"
They've never spent the night together before. "Okay," Harry says. He goes to his flat to change into his sleeping things and brush his teeth, ignoring the mess — he'll pack tomorrow morning.
“What is the first thing you do when you start work?” Hermione says.
When he returned home after that fateful night at Skinshifters a week ago, Pansy was clearly waiting for him, judging by how she tossed her magazine away at once, turned around and glanced at his left arm the minute he stepped inside.
After a while, Potter lowers his equipment and considers his handiwork. He cradles Draco's arm with his palms and tips his head to the side to regard the tattoo from a fresh angle. He passes an alcohol wipe over Draco's skin, pops open a bottle and spreads a clear ointment on Draco’s arm. Next, he unrolls a transparent protective dressing over the fresh tattoo. He thrusts two vials of potion into Draco's hands, launching into aftercare instructions, but his words fade as Draco stares at his Mark with brand new eyes.
The first thing that Draco notices is the flock of owls gathered near the row of owl stands. He’s not familiar with most of them, but he recognises Harry’s snowy owl, and of course, Humphrey hovering at the edge of the group looking rather intimidated.
Harry smiles, his fingers tightening around hers. "I'd come back from the ends of the world for this."
He shuts himself up by gulping down some hot tea.
"Say it properly," Malfoy commands. He pulls his fingers out and begins to lube his prick, his eyes never leaving Harry's face.
Disgrace and guilt, magnified at the knowledge of Potter seeing him at his lowest and most despicable, storms through Draco. Driven by rage and self-disgust, he shoves Potter away and descends the stairs, ignoring his plaintive cry. Draco hurries out of the Tower, schooling his expression when he runs into students. He walks, fast and edgy, towards the dungeons, breathing heavily and biting hard on his lower lip to control his emotions.
Draco snarls and yanks open the drawer of the coffee table so hard that it rattles. He retrieves a bottle of lube, uncorks it with his teeth and drizzles a generous amount of lube all over his fingers.
Draco almost expects Potter to cry out and push him away, but he doesn't. Instead, his arms are locked around the back of his thighs and trembling with strain. It takes every ounce of Draco's self-control to not shove his entire length inside, but he will not hurt Potter. Just remembering how Potter had kissed his scars triggers a well of emotion in Draco.
"Where's your bedroom?" Harry huffs.
A few moments tick by before Harry can catch his breath and think coherently. It starts off with "that's fucking hot, but that's not how my cock looks like," — "I just wanked to Malfoy and loved it," — "Malfoy?
Malfoy's eyes sharpen at his words, as if looking out for some hidden meaning or jibe, but he relaxes when it’s clear Harry meant nothing of that sort. Harry finishes his slice and wipes his fingers on a napkin. “You don’t mind, d’you?”
That day, the castle is a right arse about things; messing up staircases (he was twenty minutes late for lunch), extinguishing the fire in his office’s grate (he resorted to warming charms, which faded after every ten minutes) and spelling his parchment and quills to hop out of his hands (his students were very amused. He wasn’t).
"Look, I just want my tart," he says, trying to keep his tone even; it's not a good idea to hex the bloody git.
"Why are you dressed like that?" Draco hissed under his breath, darting another look at Father in jeans, for Salazar's sake-
Malfoy rests his hand on top of Harry’s, and Harry slows down until he’s simply buried inside Malfoy, filling him up completely. They stare at each other in a loaded silence. Malfoy gazes at their joined hands. "Harry, I…" He lifts his eyes to Harry’s face, his voice brittle. "It's only you, always you. You know that."
"Get on," Potter orders, his voice rough. Draco eagerly obeys, his slinky and sexy act thrown to the winds because he'll do anything,
"I'm not going out again."
Potter's grin dimmed, and Longbottom hushed Finnigan, who fell silent at once.
The fact that it is Potter, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, that covered over his Dark Mark, doesn't escape Draco.
Harry's ice-cream dripped all over the railing during the conversation, so he cleans it up, stepping back afterwards. He spots the numerous engraved love locks clinging onto the metal mesh below the railing.
Potter slicks lube up his hardening prick and fingers, and Draco begs for him to hurry up, his toes curling in anticipation because in seconds, just seconds he'll be having sex with Potter, his favourite fantasy of
At Hermione's words, he turns away from Parkinson. His friends are staring at him, some with concern and confusion, but Ron and Hermione simply look resigned. He glances down; his elbow is indeed in his plate of spag bol. He mutters his thanks and casts a Cleaning Charm on his jumper.
They eat in silence, and Draco realises belatedly that Hermione must have had a reason for broaching the topic.
"Jealous, are we?" Malfoy mocks.
Harry turns and gives the crowd a good look at his shoulders, well-toned back and arse as he swirls his hips and swings his arms to the music. Since he's facing the back of the stage, Harry sees the snake coming — a boomslang with green scales that shimmer when the light catches them the right way. Needless to say, the boomslang is a highly venomous snake and Harry's dancing falters when he sees the harsh black serial numbers magicked across the snake's neck.
"It's Christmas! I have to be with him—"
"Have you ever danced in the rain before?" Harry asks.
Malfoy's mouth is parted slightly in shock and he's put a hand on his chest. Harry would've made some quip about him being overly dramatic, but that would ruin the moment, and he doesn't want to do that.
"For all the fuss you make about us not spending enough time together—“
He loves how Harry crowded him against his office table, his hands stumbling on Draco's belt and trousers while Draco kicked off his shoes and socks. He wanted so desperately to be naked, along with Harry, but when he reached up to undo his shirt, Harry stilled his hands on his buttons and mumbled, "Love how prim and proper you are at work but how you're such a wild little fuck in bed, keep that on while I fuck you, yeah-"
"We'll make it work. Trust me," he reassures, his grin sunny with hope and optimism. "I'm gonna be an Auror, you're gonna start your apprenticeship in Potions, and we're gonna get a flat in London together, maybe not too far from Ron and Hermione.”
Potter shrugs a shoulder and gets into position, letting Draco guide his hands to where they should be. Draco walks and talks him through a basic waltz, and it takes a few tries before Potter gets it well enough to be able to dance for a few counts without stepping on Draco’s toes or tripping over his own feet.
Malfoy must have known how that sounds, because he immediately blushes a bright red.
Just thinking about that is enough to make him sick to the stomach. He wants to march into the Great Hall tomorrow, grab Malfoy's hand and hold it up for the entire world, to declare that they’re together. Harry knows what he felt tonight, but if Malfoy himself refuses to acknowledge it, then…
"Because… I trust you," Draco whispers.
motion in him as his orgasm thunders through him-
Harry can't take his eyes off Malfoy's lips. "I'm not... surprised," Harry hedges, ducking his head slightly and rubbing the back of his neck. "I should've known you're a man of many talents."
Draco rolls his eyes and promptly pulls Potter into his arms and resumes their positions. He frowns when Potter’s head immediately bows to look at their feet. Sighing, he slides a finger under Potter’s chin and tilts his head up. “Look at me. I’ll guide you.”
Scene 5 “Lisbon, Portugal”: RM & V - 4 O'Clock
It's a cheerful and cosy place — walls painted a sunshine-yellow; a large blackboard menu behind the counter with prices and today's specials written in colourful chalk; a large glass display case containing the day's desserts: tarts studded with berries; crumbly buttermilk scones; rich vanilla pound cake and roly-polys oozing with glistening jam.
Draco knows — it's as clear as day — that he would very much like to be Harry's husband someday.
"Brilliant. Thanks." George nods at Malfoy, waves to Harry and returns to his office. He spends some time perusing Malfoy’s sketches, and is pleased to note that all of his requests have been incorporated into the new designs, along with a handful of refreshing ideas. George closes the file and taps his fingers on it, his eyes snagging on Malfoy’s name printed on the cover.
“Come along, that’s a good boy,” Draco taunts.
"Let's go to Paris now," Harry says.
"I didn't ask you to tell-" Jealousy zips across grey eyes like quicksilver, before Malfoy frowns. "You were having sex in a park?!"
There's many things to do, now that Harry has the key-code. He looks at his watch. Parvati and the others would be sleeping at this hour, but they can't wait any longer. Harry mentally runs through the list of people he has to notify at once, they'll have to raid the club as soon as possible to free the snakes and grab as much evidence as they can, before going after the people right at the top.
“I’m sorry for tearing the tickets,” Draco mumbles after a long pause.
He perches on a rickety chair at Potter's kitchen counter, nursing a cup of chamomile tea. Grey eyes track Potter as he finishes up the kitchen by checking expiry dates.
There’s no use running from Potter anymore.
"You called, Malfoy?"
Oh God,
"It's the History of Magic textbook for Hogwarts seventh years," Potter says with a wintry smile. "I hate how they described me."
It was a sodding mess that afternoon, the soup splashing all over, soaking Potter's shirt and getting on Weasley's shoes. A very apologetic Potter had cleaned everything up, of course, but Draco noticed his wet shirt clinging to his taut stomach, and when Potter untucked the hem of his shirt from his trousers, Draco caught a tantalising peek of dark hair leading down to his—
Draco gasps.
“Oh no. This isn’t some quick shag in the back of a club,” Malfoy says, with a throaty laugh. He undoes each button as slow as possible. When he’s finally finished, Harry moves to shrug his shirt off, but Malfoy wants him to keep it on. “Look at you,” he murmurs in awe. Grey eyes glimmer as they sweep Harry’s body — Harry’s hair is messy, his lips parted, chest heaving as he pants eagerly in short and shallow breaths. His legs are splayed open, his cock so hard that it rests on his belly. When a breeze gusts across them, his nipples harden, and Malfoy grazes them with a finger.
He messaged Harry that night, asking him out — "only if you'd like, I know it's terribly late." A pause, and then another chime, "If this woke you up, I apologise. Please ignore this and go back to bed." Turns out that Marjorie asked Malfoy to cover for a band’s last set. Harry was indeed dozing off in front of the telly, but upon seeing the message, he popped into the shower and went to Mona's.
It starts from the back of her neck; a sprinkling of snowflakes (it’s a magical tattoo so it's slightly brighter than normal) spiralling down to the top of her right shoulder blade. The winding snowflakes land on a tattoo of the Parkinson estate, its large windows stained with cobwebs and the grounds of the estate fading away into dense, vertical tree roots, a homage to the Parkinson legacy and history.
Harry spins around at the lazy drawl. Malfoy's right in front of him, a bit too close for comfort and holding an umbrella that covers Harry entirely while half of Malfoy's body is drenched. This is the first time in recent years that Harry's seen Malfoy up close — they've only shouted at each other across the road. The soft blond hair at the nape of Malfoy's neck is rapidly darkening with rain. His lips, currently quirked up in amusement, are a rich strawberry pink.
He sits on the edge of the bed, swinging his legs as he waits, fingers tapping out a rhythm to ease the pent-up energy rattling in him.
Potter turns around, sagging against the counter. Draco lifts his hand to his lips, his tongue sliding up and down between his fingers, grazing the web of skin between thumb and index finger. "Delicious," he declares, licking his lips in an explicit show of desire.
Draco closes his eyes and lets out a bubbly sigh of bliss.
"Hey," Potter greets. "Need a pick-me-up?" He offers the coffee to Draco. "Hope this'll help with your writing."
This isn't like any gay club he's visited — Harry's all too used to the dizzying technicolour strobe lights illuminating the bumping and grinding of half-naked bodies on the dance floor; glitter raining down on the heaving masses that twirl on linoleum floors stained, sticky and sweet because of spilt alcohol — but
The distance between Harry and Draco is so wide that it feels like Harry's never left Underground.
Eventually, they pull apart, and Potter looks bloody brilliant — hair even messier, lips kiss-swollen and pupils dilated, his chest heaving and part of his jumper tugged off his shoulder.
"Depends on what you mean by here.”
“Sorry,” Harry says to Malfoy, and then turns to her. “
Silence falls when McGonagall clears her throat. She ends her speech by wishing the students a fruitful term ahead, and when she claps her hands, food appears on their plates. She steps down from the lectern and returns to her seat at the middle of the table, raising her eyebrows at Harry on the way there.
"Wow," Harry says on an exhale. He moves to a good spot where the light of the waning sun catches the view just right, and he tips his head to the side, imagining it framed in a painting. He snaps a picture with his camera, and hurries to another area, eager to get another perspective.
They will recite their vows, slip rings on each other’s fingers, promise the rest of their lives to each other—
that it's me, and he's bluffing. So I
She breaks into a small, pleased smile.
“Yeah,” Harry admits, putting his fork down. “I’ve thought about that, ever since I met you again. I know the Ministry seized whatever they could in your vaults for reparations, although they left the Manor intact.” He pauses, before adding quietly, “And I know from Pansy that you left Britain the same day you buried your parents in the family crypt.”
"No."
"Good game, lads! Off to the showers and I'll see you next week for practice!" Oliver hollers at the troop of grumbling teenagers stomping up the stairs.
"No," Harry lies.
Malfoy’s gaze darts to Harry’s mouth. “I’m not surprised. Too overrated and noisy, too touristy.” He cuts a piece of waffle and pairs it with a slice of strawberry. “A lot of people say that about New York, and I could spend the next hour or so listing out all the grievances of the locals — too expensive, too many tourists.” He arches a brow at Harry, who grins sheepishly before Malfoy continues. “Along with the protests lining the streets every so often — but it’s been my home for the past four years.” He eats the waffle and swallows.
In one way or another, Harry’s always tempting Draco with his flights of fancies and adventure.
"I can't dance!" Harry protests, and it's true. Even though he does frequent clubs, he never tries to dance, knowing that he'll probably look like a floppy wet fish. "Just give me something else. How about a... a book-keeper?!"
The name conjures a memory of a tall redhead in Gryffindor robes, scowling in concentration as he advances towards Draco, his wand snapping in the air and incantations rolling off his tongue as he deflects a volley of N.E.W.T-level curses during Draco’s Duelling Club session.
Draco flings an arm out on the bed to fumble around for his phone. He opens his messages; the last text from Potter was sent when Draco was still in London. Draco taps his fingertip on the side of his phone, hesitating. Eventually, he types a message, aiming for something casual and breezy. Before he sends it, he reconsiders. Potter might be asleep, so perhaps he should text tomorrow morning? Yes, that's a better idea. He's about to close the message screen, when his phone buzzes with a text.
He must've shown his discomfort, because the Healer — he's still not exactly sure, because her uniform might be one of a Healer’s, but it's missing the sign of a bone and a wand — adjusts something beyond his field of vision. The pain fades to a dull throb, and he raises a limp hand in thanks. He stays still as the Healer casts diagnostic spells over his body.
"No!"
, but the thing is he's
"I've got a lot to learn," Harry says, grinning at Jacob when he returns with a fresh pint.
"We don't know what's happening, he hasn't done anything wrong, but they took him anyway!" Parkinson shouts, advancing towards Harry.
Draco traces the flowers on his skin, and then closes his eyes, summoning their kiss at Skinshifters—of Potter's lingering touch, dreamy green eyes, his urgent tug on Draco’s clothes and the pressure of his lips on Draco’s—memories that Draco keeps squirrelled away in the jewel box of his heart.
Bacon shakes his large triangular head. "I cannot pretend to be one of them. You rescued me before they could brand me with a number" — another set of serial numbers pressed on pale skin flashes in Harry's mind — "so they'll know that I didn't enter by the official channels. Even if I let them catch me, they might ship me off to somewhere else instead."
-tastic. Draco splays his left palm on the base of Potter's spine and pushes his hips even lower. He wets his tongue and starts to lick Potter's balls, dragging his tongue up and down and in circles, or mouthing at them. His left hand wraps around Potter's cock, jerking him slow and steady, his thumb teasing at his slit every so often.
"What in Salazar’s name are you doing, Potter? I certainly don’t recall sending you an invitation," he snaps through clenched teeth. He sends a vicious glare towards Harry, shaking a trembling fist at him. “How dare you—”
Harry grins. "C'mon, I dedicated an entire show to you. I should be the embarrassed one.” He moves closer to Draco, his voice low and husky. "I can spend the rest of my life listening to you sing."
Harry throws his hands up in surrender.
“Get up,” he demands. “I’m going to suck your cock at the table where you and Weasley eat your lunch every day.”
"I reached the plaza at eight fifteen." Malfoy indicates the empty space beside Harry. "May I?"
The back of Draco's legs hit the side of the bed, and they collapse in a heap on top of it. Potter looks fucking good: his healthy tanned glow, his flushed cheeks and inky scrawls of black hair a wonderful contrast to the white sheets. Potter flings an arm out and Draco crawls up, nestling into the crook of his shoulder.
Draco nods.
Until now.
“More fucking, less talking,” Malfoy orders. Harry is more than happy to comply. He fucks him in earnest, his strokes long, deep and sure. He’s close, he’s embarrassingly close, he has to last, Christ, he’s not eighteen anymore,
"I figured out I was gay that year too, and you were the first bloke I wanked to, although you're not the only one. Merlin, I can't believe you're still so damn hopeless about this. Just makes me want you even
His hands limp and his knees weak, Harry crumples to the ground, his eyes glazing over at the unfamiliar lock shared between Brittany and Adam that has replaced
“Yeah, at least twice a week, if things aren’t mad busy. Ron and I live a few blocks away, so it’s really convenient, especially if we end up getting sloshed.”
He must've heard Harry's screams during his nightmares.
Harry goes to the loo and splashes cold water on his face, trying to steady his thumping heart. He's here on Auror business, Harry reminds himself sternly, chasing all Inappropriate Malfoy Thoughts away. No matter how good Malfoy looks on the dance floor, Malfoy is still a suspect under investigation.
The last time Draco had ignored Humphrey's warning signs of an impending tantrum, he had refused to deliver Draco's mail for an entire week.
while Harry packs his essentials into his backpack and leaves his school things in his trunk, with Ron promising to bring it to the Burrow after Hogwarts.
Harry goes very still.
Harry stops fidgeting at once. His eyes are half-lidded when Draco closes in. Their lips meet, and the tension in Draco's body melts away when Harry kisses back. It starts a little bit clumsy, with their noses and front teeth bumping, but it eventually smoothens out into a slow and luxurious kiss, one as gentle as a summer's day.
having inappropriately sexy thoughts about
Harry thinks, — "Besides, wouldn't you be glad to have him out of the way?!" She staggers into a chair and dissolves into a fresh bout of tears. "We d-d-don't even know where he is, they could have thrown him back to Azkaban. We tried all we could, but how could we..."
Draco lets out a low, gravelly laugh.
Bacon sniffs. "Of course I can! This Draco is much better than anyone you've brought home-"
Harry’s cheeks heat up at the stray thought
"Then I must be selfish too, because I want you all to myself. What if you don't return to Hogwarts next year? What if you find someone out there, in the city who is more interesting than me?"
Their smiles fade as they look at each other. Potter rubs the back of his neck, a sign that he doesn’t know what to say. Draco shifts his weight from foot to foot. An awkward silence stretches. They rarely spend much time alone; their friends are usually around to keep the conversation going and the mood light.
“You’re mine, Harry. You’re
“I’m sorry,
Harry laughs, low and gravelly. "Jealous? I don't see any of them doing this to you. I don't see you riding their thigh like how you're doing to mine." For Harry had jammed his thigh between Malfoy's legs, letting the other man rub his prick against him as hard and as fast as he wants.
It's something that invites hesitant questions and wary looks. Draco hides it for work, but he can't keep wearing long-sleeved shirts and it’s a daily hassle to use concealer and Glamours. The Mark also brings with it a whirlwind of memories and swellings of guilt and sorrow, emotions that are a constant reminder.
With his heart beating like a frantic creature trying to run away, Harry shambles out of the room, mounts the steps, up the stage, towards the crowd, who greet him with whoops and wolf-whistles louder than they'd given any of the other strippers.
Well, wouldn’t he be surprised, then?
Harry slows down, his eyes lingering on the man's blond hair, earrings and pale skin.
Malfoy scowls.
“Oh god, I’m doing Draco Malfoy. I’m doing you,” Harry croaks, his strokes deeper and faster as the realisation finally sinks in, that he’s not in some wet dream. This is real, he’s
"I need time," Malfoy repeats, more to himself than to Harry.
, at the angel bakery! I saw an angel in the kitchen the other day, Mum! I wanna eat chocolate made by an angel! And the lady there is very nice," the girl protests, pointing across the road.
Malfoy stares at the pants, and then at Harry.
After the craze and novelty of visiting the Saviour’s bakery had worn off, Harry had fallen into a steady, comforting routine — his friends visit during lunch or tea; Andromeda drops Teddy off during weekends, and sometimes he'll ask Ron or Hermione to tend to the place while he takes Teddy out to the nearby park. Hermione often arrives with her arms full of Healer textbooks on weekends and in between classes while Ron sometimes brings his Auror files after work. They'll help themselves to tea and pastries while Harry putters about in the kitchen, preparing for the next day's work or an order for a wedding or birthday party. They'll ring for take-away and laugh and eat and chat. Harry loves it when it's just the three of them; it's like Hogwarts all over again.
They share a look. "Harry, he…" Ron's voice drops to a whisper. "He never stopped."
How did everything end up like this? He doesn't have anything to remember Malfoy by, except for the mind-blowing sex, his splintering heart and Malfoy's vanilla scent soaked into his skin.
Two weeks have passed since their first tidying session, and Draco would be lying if he said he didn't enjoy their time together. As expected, Potter is a handful, but things progressed relatively smoothly once Draco made it clear that for once, they're working together for the same goal. They usually ended each session with a meal, and with every warm smile, soft whisper and heated gaze, Draco grows increasingly smitten for Potter.
"Bloody hell, Malfoy," Harry sighs. It seems as though the other blokes usually take Malfoy home after pub nights, so it would make sense that a key would be hidden somewhere... Harry tries a Summoning charm, but comes up empty. He looks around for possible hiding places before spotting a snake earring nestled behind a potted plant. Harry pulls it out and taps his wand on it to uncover the concealment charm, revealing a key.
Redemption.
They peer through the kitchen window just in time to see Harry toss his head back and let out a frustrated roar.
," Potter seems to have lost the ability to speak in full sentences.
reserved ten pages in his honour? Sighing, Harry tosses the mag aside and stretches on his bed. It’s the day before second term officially reopens, and the teachers are returning from their holidays.
"Are you working this Saturday night? Because I... I would like to take you out for dinner," Harry says.
of the stereotypes that boxed us in? Certainly, most of us were close-minded and prejudiced against Muggle-borns and Muggles, but we were raised to subscribe to that doctrine. Would it not be more rewarding to nurture us, to show us that we could be successful without resorting to the Dark Arts?
Harry's eyes soften. He leans forward, his gaze heart-stoppingly intense.
He notices the warmer disposition of the Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors towards Malfoy, going by the grins and small waves directed at him as they leave.
"Harry, I wish you were here. I wish you were here with me," he says, snowflakes covering his words and his eyelashes. His eyes are drawn to the moon hanging high up in the velvet sky. He's sent up Gryffindor-gold wishes
unruffled by last night.
"Rough game?" Harry asks, drying himself off.
Theo snickers. "Yes, and I've got a book club meeting," he says, the lie tripping smoothly from his tongue. "Looks like it's just you and Draco, then."
T-shirt that’s definitely too tight.
And therein lies the problem.
His face engulfed in a hot blush of embarrassment, Draco shakes Harry's arm away. "We've got a house together and a joint Gringotts account, for Salazar's sake! Where did you think this was going?!" He pushes his hair out of his eyes, injecting some semblance of anger into his glare. "Imagine if it were you that found the ring, would you not have come to the same conclusion as I did?"
"Look at you, my God," Potter whispers with a note of reverence as he stares with wide eyes at Draco's erection. Draco's face grows warm. Cock stiffening even more, he straightens up and covers Potter's body with his own, kissing him so passionately and desperately that Potter's chest rumbles with every deep moan.
George would’ve found the entire thing hilarious...
you, I've got better things to do with my time," Bacon sniffs. "It's not my fault that you sound like a wounded Hippogriff when you're touching yourself!"
A mother seated beside Draco wheels her pram back and forth, hushing her whimpering baby. The baby peers up at him with wide blue eyes and gurgles, raising her small fists towards him. Harry leans over to coo and wave at her, while Draco ignores her, looking straight ahead.
— but because he doesn’t know how to approach it.
Harry chuckles. "That's a bloody brilliant pick-up line."
Everything will change.
“No, you won’t!” he grunts. Draco struggles in his grip, his fingers scrabbling on the edge of the bed. An idea strikes him, and he fakes a cry of pain. “Ow, my arse, you inelegant buffoon!”
“You like how I handle the meat?” Malfoy says with a smirk, lifting his eyes up to Harry, who blinks at the double entendre. Malfoy puts the fish away and washes his hands. “Perhaps you’ve got some meat that needs handling?”
Suddenly, Astoria Greengrass’ words echo in Harry’s head—
"Yes, I was worried when Parkinson told me they took you away! I come right down to see you having a cup of tea with Andrew! She lied to me!"
"Harry, no!" Hermione calls out.
Malfoy smiles tersely — a smile chained behind gritted teeth and sealed lips.
Harry buries his head in his hands and wonders why the world has suddenly gone out of colour.
He's never really known Malfoy.
Harry trembles under Malfoy's questing tongue, his toes curling and back arching with pleasure. No one's touched him like this before, with so much patience and skill, turning Harry's entire body into one helpless erogenous zone-
"I think he
When Malfoy smiles and accepts, Harry's heart shouldn't have skipped a beat. It shouldn't have then clattered madly in his chest in double-quick time. There's absolutely no reason for that to happen; they're just two old school-mates sharing a meal together.
. You don't spend majority of your teens in a boarding school without catching glimpses of other boys' pricks in the showers, and hell, Malfoy had a really big dick — even when soft. Harry's eyes had widened when he caught sight of it years ago, but that was about it.
When he suddenly hears the flare of the Floo and Harry’s voice calling out his name, Draco scrambles to replace the ring back to its original position in Harry’s drawer. As Harry’s footsteps trudge closer, he looks around the room with wild eyes and settles for draping himself sexily across their bed.
"Pansy helped me to purchase tickets online, and she tells me it's really not as bad as it sounds" — Draco's voice goes a little high-pitched — "sitting in a metal death-trap powered by Muggle engineering that I know absolutely nothing about." He drops his gaze to the duvet and fiddles with the edge of it. "I... didn't know if this was something you would fancy; it's our first trip abroad as a couple and I didn't consult you about anything." He lifts his head and meets Harry's astonished eyes with a gaze half-hopeful, half-shy.
to Potter when Patil's back was turned. She had glimpsed Potter's expression and sighed, "I know you've got issues, Harry, but we're not in school anymore. You've got to get over it."
It was tough, but worth it when he saw how delighted Harry was at seeing everyone together in their house. And it hadn't been an absolute disaster that Draco had envisioned it to be. Of course, there were tense moments between Father and Arthur Weasley during dinner, but that was alleviated when their wives made appropriate soothing noises, with Mother refreshing Father's wine and placing a calming hand on his thigh under the table.
Draco tucks a finger under Potter's chin, forcing Potter to meet his eyes. He wants to say something to erase Potter's regret and sadness, to tell him that it's okay
At least not now.
"Of course. I reckon you can at least give me that." With a flick of her wand, Pansy sends their dishes away to the kitchen. She gathers some paper, and with a pencil at the ready, she fixes Draco with a level look. "What do you have in mind?"
“When Pansy called me, telling me you needed help, I knew that I would do everything in my power to get this pregnancy to term for you and your lover. I initally thought you had found love and even though it hurt, I was not going to let that pain keep me from doing my best. Because you deserve to be happy.”
He had no idea what was going on, only the fundamental knowledge that he had to hold on to his wand. The light grew unbearably bright where it met the oily curse. He sank to his knees, and still held on.
The back held the workshop, where jar upon jar of odd ingredients were stacked, precariously balanced on every available surface. Hermione had more than once predicted that one day she would find Harry suffocated or crushed under a mountain of jabberwocky feathers or Ashwinder Eggshells. So far he had evaded that prediction and was happily adding to his collection of interesting wand cores, infusions and repair materials.
“Ok, yes, I was the receiving party, we were not strict about who did what. About the protective measures...Uhm we did cast spells for health…” Her face falls at that, and he realises that she is not happy to hear what he says. ”But that is not what you are asking. Right?”
“I am afraid, Lord Malfoy that this knowledge is only available to your son.”
"I know. She is safe, one of your emergency portkeys brought her to St Mungos, but why didn't you go with her?"
Bill strode over and prepared himself a cup of coffee, while he brewed a cup of tea and listened to the little huffs of breath that escaped Draco while he was working on the research.
Her colleague fidgeted. “Well, I do believe that the two gentlemen had the intention to make their comrades smile, and you do have to admit that there is something funny about the situation.”
“How are you holding up?” She holds onto him a bit longer than usual.
Harry steps back into position, and experiences the same strange thing. Wanting to let go because Malfoy is so very warm and the voices that tell him how very very wrong he is for even feeling this way.
"Are you asking me out?" Draco asked bluntly back.
He half considers to just turn back into his cat form, since that would be so much easier, but then again he doesn't want Draco to just love the cat. The month apart and the dreadful nights alone, his constant turning towards someone who is no longer there, have made one thing very clear to him. He needs to know if Draco would consider him as a partner, else he might go completely crazy.
With a decisive motion she opened the drawn shutters, and light flooded the room.
Filius looked chastised. “But the flooding started later?”
Draco startles badly at the pop of house-elf Apparition. How long has he been alone then? After a short breakfast of tea he had wandered off to fix the old suite that Greyback had inhabited. Only to realise, once he got to it, that the stink of the beast had settled too deeply into the furniture. Even the Scouring Charms did not do the job properly. He has been Vanishing layer upon layer of grime for most of the morning and feels a bone-deep exhaustion.
He was so focused on not failing that he missed the worried looks that Bill kept throwing his way, the frowns when he forced a basic diagnostic spell to work through pure will.
By now Harry has gotten up and began to dress himself.
“Please, let’s step into my office. We won’t disturb the patient there.” The Healer is professional and kind. Draco is relieved not to encounter hostility here.
For within this book the family records every bond made by its members. It does so even when they are not aware of having entered a bond. Sometimes such thing is a curse, sometimes it proves itself to be a blessing. For a bond written down in this book can only be broken by the family member who has made it.
The lingering smell was that of rot, and decay and the very walls had soaked up the darkness of its former inhabitants. One did not touch anything without protection. This house was a nightmare.
Draco laughed at that. "Sorry. I couldn't resist."
“Yes we are.” Draco grinned.”The French define eating outside as a picnic. Even though we sit at a table. But I made all of the food and I do not always like sitting on the floor. There are lots of spots on the island where you can sit outside and eat. They have trash cans and everything. So a bit different from Picnic at home, but not that much.”
“What I am trying to tell you, Mr Malfoy is, that the contract you are trying to finalize cannot be certified, because it won’t take.”
"Sleep well, Harry." He Apparated with a smile.
“Shut up, my non-existent lovelife is not up for discussion right now.” She scolds gently. “So, Ron mentioned that Harry is not used to touch, maybe every time you get into position, he is reminded of that.”
"So you don't pack your bags and start moving on the moment you feel your grief catching up with you?" Draco raised his eyebrow, but there was nothing mocking in the gesture, just a deep sadness. "Trust me Harry I know what you are doing. I have done it myself, I know how it feels when you move from place to place restless, hoping that one day you will find the one destination that your pain can't catch up to. But that destination doesn't exist. You carry all of that inside of you, and you can bury it for a while under new and exciting expressions. And then it comes back up and you need to find a new place and new impressions to cover it up for a while."
"And have you tried to talk to him? Or did you expect him to fall all over you?" she grinned
After all he seemed to overlook Harry at every turn. After their initial encounter, Harry tried for two weeks, to get anything from Draco beyond a friendly good morning, but nothing. Draco was professional, but not an iota more. And it drove Harry crazy.
“Mr Potter, shouldn’t you be in class?”
He is startled from his musings when Harry speaks up.
Despite his misgivings Harry found himself fascinated by the growing of the rare plants. The smell of the dried pods was overwhelming and he resolved to buy some of the sticks. They wandered through the forest, and Harry listened to the tour-guide who explained about the process of growing the Vanilla Orchids and the complicated process of pollinating them by hand a method that had been developed in La Reunion. Harry felt Draco's hand brush his back several times and he truly liked the soft flirting that was happening between them.
“Make love to me.” The words were out before Harry could have thought about them. Draco had been open with him and he wanted that openness, wanted no more barriers between them.
“Do you ever think that she might not get through this?” His voice shakes slightly and he doesn’t try to mask his fear.
“Ok.”
"Feel better?"
"You never have time for me. It is always work or your friends." Draco didn't scream at him, he never did. But his voice was like ice and it froze Harry on the inside.
The certainty of it causes his heart to clench.
That someone was so disgusted by the Manor that he'd rather wait in the draughty atrium, saddened him, but he didn't want to have the Curse Breaker thinking that he was deliberately taking his time in welcoming him.
"These are
“You wanted me to find this?” he asks no one in particular, as he pulls a small box out of the bassinet. It is dusty, but when he wipes it of he finds it intricately painted, with tiny snitches and brooms. The light blue surface shimmers softly under his hand and he turns the box over, under the bottom he sees a coat of arms. It definitely is not the Malfoy Crest, but it looks familiar. As he keeps turning the box, the lid slips open and a soft lullaby fills the room. Draco feels his eyes grow moist. The melody touches his heart, and he wishes that he could talk about the emotions this evokes within himself, with anyone really. But he is alone and for the first time in months he longs for someone to just be there for him.
"And I thought she was upset with me."
He wonders if his imagination is now really running so wild. However he has nothing to lose. Nobody's there to witness this crazy hunt for what he doesn’t know, and Mipsy just looks at him fondly whenever he has done something particularly stupid in his mind, like talking out loud to the portraits, or repairing a child's bed, just big enough for a house-elf to sleep in comfortably.
He clears his throat, and Harry whirls around to face him. Before he can get a word out Harry pounces at him.
“Well maybe, you should start looking into the family, and less into the magical properties of this thing.” He hands the box back. “At least that is what I would do.”
She sits down across from me and I look anywhere but at her. She grasps my chin gently and forces me to met her eyes though,
"Then why would you do it for me?" Draco can feel his eyebrows climbing towards his hairline.
“Yeah I’ll just put him down and you can sit with him. I’ll put the kettle on.” Draco won’t say that he thinks that Harry needs some time with his godson to calm down. It is clear that the Auror thing weighs heavily on him. Teddy’s cute little sounds always eases Draco’s whirling thoughts though.
"Hey kid." Bill’s voice tore him from his musings. "I worded that wrong. Did you like working with the material? Or was it made worse, because it was something you would never do out of your own volition?"
“I never said that.” Potter looks at him strangely. “I wish I could start over with you.”
Harry loved the monthly Sunday lunches at the Burrow. Being with the Weasley clan made him feel like part of a family, and so he tried to take part in them as often as possible.
Harry reached out for Draco's hand, marvelling at the calloused fingers. "You saved my life as well during the war, you could have easily given me away when the snatchers brought us in and you refused to identify us. That took so much courage."
“I want him to suffer. I want him to feel the pain and despair that he has brought into this school!”
So I only nod, and when I can trust my voice again I quip. "I just have to realize that I need to grow up."
He breathes a bit easier and something must show on his face because Potter pipes up again, “Nobody who looks at a sleeping baby like this can be entirely evil.”
"I think, we are already more than friends, but I can wait."
"I cannot take this choice away from him." I look at her and she draws a sharp breath "Lets speak hypothetically, if I am truly in love with Harry, how can I take his choice to marry someone he loves away from him? I might have been in love with him for ever." And boy that admission hurts, but it is time to stop fooling myself. "But he is one of my best friends and he does not want me. So I have to set him free. I cannot do this to him."
“Mr Potter, I mean you no harm! Why are you so adamant that this is going to hurt you?” She sounds old and weary, and Harry feels like crap about imposing even more worries on a woman old enough to retire, but who can’t because no one else is left to do the job. “Please just give this a chance. We hope that through the lessons you will all find something more light hearted to do. And as you are aware in your social situation, dancing will come up again and again, so why not learn it now in a safe environment.”
"Did you fall?"
“I am sure that the artefact influenced you. Why else would you spend voluntarily time with me.” Draco turns away.
"Do you really need to ask?" Draco smiles. "We have been in each other's live for how long now?"
"I try. I want him to have a wonderful childhood. But it is not always easy for me" Harry sighed.
"Oh, its you Draco." Her hands are shaking but the soft wet nose nudging against her, visibly soothes her.
“Hm. Well, right now I am happy with fixing the Manor. The walls don’t throw accusations at me.” At least he doesn’t think so. Sometimes there are whispers in his ears, but with walls that old, it is to be expected that some echo of spells cast long ago might linger.
“Are you sure?” Harry looks concerned, but Draco is sure. He might not have done it this way before but with Harry it just feels right. Not that he will tell him outright, but he nods.
They conjure a stretcher and hold out their wands. But the level is different and not the Knight Bus but a white car appears in front of the cottage.
“You did what you needed to do to protect your mother. And when it came to being evil - you sucked.”
As Harry’s hands linger on the supple black leather for a bit longer than needed, Draco makes an impulsive decision and adds the gloves to the bill with a small gesture. Thank Merlin his money is still good enough so the clerk does as he indicates without commenting.
-------------------------
"Hey." A rare smile cracks my face, I can feel the muscles complain, but my hand starts to pet the friendly golden dog that looks at me inquisitively. "Aren't you beautiful?"
Draco grinned. The dramatic wording showed that Harry understood him, and his temperament.
"Penny for your thoughts?"
“Yeah, I never thought I would see the day when I agree with you.” Potter shrugged helplessly.
What he had not anticipated was Bill pulling him aside just as soon as he had stepped out of the floo.
"I thought you would never ask."
"Hello Mother." I try to keep my voice calm, not wanting to frighten her further and hating myself for having disturbed her.
"You don't understand."
“Can you move?” He asks, and Harry complies, picking up speed. When he changes the angle slightly he jabs into Draco's prostate again, wrenching a strangled moan from him.
Fatigue had become his second nature. No amount of magical concealer could hide the blue shadows underneath his eyes, but he was too tired to care. Nothing mattered beyond getting woken by his mother at seven, drinking strong tea for breakfast to get him going, moving to the cluttered office that Bill had rented, and reading through the tomes on obscure curses and how to counter them. It probably should have worried him that Bill refrained from having him cast further spells but he was glad for the respite.
Draco is silent for a long time after that question, and Harry feels that he has overstepped a boundary.
That night was the last for the next two months where he had a chance to talk to Ron and Hermione. And he intended to use it.
I wonder why Tora is still so relaxed, usually she would have clawed her way out of the situation already, but there she is, sitting on Potters lap. Her slitted eyes are watching me, keenly and I am rooted to the spot. Just when I gather my nerve to get up and ask for my cat back, I feel warm bodies settle left and right of me. They are snuggled so close that I feel their heartbeats, I don't dare to move too fast, fearing that it will earn me a nip to the leg. Crups have never liked me, so why should they start to now? Potter smiles at me.
"Yes, a Detachment Curse to be precise. It didn’t work on my limb, as it was intended, but I couldn’t deflect it fully either." He felt somewhat detached himself as he repeated the horrific experience, as if he was standing by as a spectator, and had not lived through the situation himself.
Draco finds himself laughing out loud.
'I will not give up, I am not going to sacrifice my friend. Please don't leave me hanging.' He begged his wand silently, pouring every ounce of strength into the shield that kept Bill hidden from the malicious curse. His wand grew almost impossibly hot and began to glow. Draco made a pained sound but held on, the skin on his palm blistering. He closed his eyes against the bright light erupting from the tip of his wand.
I sit in the park, staring unseeing - at what - I don't know, until a wet nose touches my hand and soft fur jolts me back to the present.
"That was stupid." He got out before collapsing unceremoniously on the floor.
Draco wonders how to approach the issue that they had been talking about in Diagon, but he hesitates. What if Harry thinks he is overstepping the boundaries of their acquaintance? He is torn from his thoughts when Harry begins to talk suddenly.
"It was that or have Bill die. And that was certainly not an option!" Draco felt tired again. "My crazy, gladly deceased aunt had rigged the salon doors, in Lestrange Manor. She had hidden a combination of
"But you said you had to claim me as your own." Draco replied hotly.
Silence reigns in the courtroom, as if the public cannot believe what they just heard. Haven't they understood that he will pay willingly for his sins?
They walked for a bit in silence, but it was a comfortable one. The sun shone with its last strength before winter would come and paint wonderful reflexes into Harry's hair. Draco looked at the other man and the warm feeling in his stomach intensified at the look of joy in Harry's eyes.
In the end, it was easy. He had not been there often enough, and he had hidden behind his work and friends. No wonder that Draco who had been used to being put first by his parents, and who just wanted to be loved and cherished couldn't put up with his antics. Instead of opening up about his fears and insecurities he had driven the one good thing in his life away.
She smiles at the thought of seeing Draco Malfoy brought to his knees, and by a friend no less.
Warm arms encircle him and Draco pulls him close. “I think it is a very good thing then, that I don’t ever want to let go of you, if I can help it.”
He raises the glass and takes a sip of his drink. His first thought is that the beer must be spoiled and for a split second he considers spitting it back into his glass. But he forces himself to swallow, in the hope that nobody noticed his disgust.
So now he was up and heading towards Draco's home. As Draco got into the car, Harry handed him a pain au chocolat and was rewarded with a brilliant smile.
“As soon as the charm hit him, I heard the screams from the dungeons,” Draco whispered. “I think I never ran as fast as then. I was scared someone was really hurt.”
“How is she?” Draco whispers, instinctively trying not to wake Andromeda.
Draco refused to break the bond that was written down for him, the accidental betrothal bond to one Harry Potter-Malfoy.
“Ok.” He is at a loss for words and it must show on his face.
There are days when he is still closed of to the world, but they are further apart each week and I dread the day that he might not need me any longer. But then his fingers curl around mine and he leans against me drawing comfort from me as much as from my crups and I hope that with patience and love, we can explore this little thing between us.
"It must be difficult." Harry conceded. "But I admit, most of my encounters were with Muggles as well. My attempts at dating wizards have been disastrous. People still treat me like a hero, when I am just ordinary Harry."
"Because I don't need his help. If Mother needs him, that is fine, but I don't particularly want to spent time with him." I sound frosty, and Tora butts my chin.
“Pansy you are scaring me.” And he is not easily scared “Am I dying?” He thought it was just a bug, a magical one yes, because he does feel like a lorry ran him over, but a bug nonetheless.
He blurts his thoughts out before they are fully formed. “I believe the Manor wanted her gone, she left so abruptly for Europe. But she told me all about you, and that you would be kind.”
He smiled when he read the chicken scratch that was Harry's handwriting.
How could he have been so naive? To think that any artefact from his ancestors would be harmless and simply for himself.
"You mean the
The effect is instantaneous. Mother freezes, her eyes scanning the room in the panicky way that I have come to associate with unexpected changes in her environment.
“Harry, I expected better of you.”
"Nothing. And that is the strangest thing you know? Draco has never been one to hold back when it came to voicing his opinion, but ever since you started helping him with this issue, he has withdrawn quite a bit. He is fantastic at researching curses and doing the preliminary work on the premises but I need him out in the field with me. I miss his snark and if you have done something to upset him…" Bill trailed off and Harry looked at him, the subtle threat clear in the blue eyes.
Draco thought about it for a while. "Well, there the beach at
Blaise listens intently and only when he has talked himself tired he stretches the hand out.
"Your usual?" He makes to get up, but she declines. He cannot understand what exactly she says to Draco, but it must be hurtful to him since he turns away and there is a raw pain in his face.  That makes him furious all of a sudden, for some reason he doesn't want Draco hurt. When she moves towards him, he swipes his paw at her hand, intent on paying her back. But finds himself thwarted.
“You look like shit, if you don’t mind the blunt words.” Pansy quips, as she turns to hug him. But the worried frown tells him, that he really doesn’t look well.
“I will show you something when we get back, but trust me, it will get better. It takes time, but then many things in life do.” Draco reached out and gently touched Harry's cheek.
"Are you an animagus?" Draco whispers and Harry hates how afraid he suddenly sounds, he nods nonetheless. Draco makes a step back. "Go on then, change back. I promise I am wandless and I won't curse you."
After a couple minutes they are called into Andromeda’s room. She is indeed awake, and Draco takes her frail hand in his, glad to feel the feeble flutter of pulse underneath his fingertips.
“And?”
"I am glad that the wand works so well." Harry smiled, tucking a stray strand of hair behind Draco's ear.
"Fuck"
-------------
Draco was so going to kill him.
Harry moves of his body to get more room, and Draco mewls in protest. “Shush, I am going to take  care of you.” So he sinks back into the sheets and lets his tights fall open.
"The Draco I knew in school, is probably a completely different person, than the one you know. But I would like to get to know him." He laughs "It also helps that he is bloody attractive, but you won't let him in on that little secret right?"
Harry scrubbed his face, "I didn’t even think that far. I mean we have only just begun to date…"
"Don't do this Harry." Her hand touches my arm, and I focus back on her.
Draco makes her coffee and asks her to keep him company. It seems that he has to revise the opinion he has formed about her. They continue to talk softly and Draco feeds him scraps of ham. He listens closely to their conversation. But it is at a certain point that his interest is piqued specifically.
"I am here." Draco whispers into his ear. "And I will never leave you."
Yes, he should want to die from embarrassment, but Draco is simply beautiful when he laughs so openly.
Draco coughed and flushed a little. "Well, I was thinking of taking you to the place where one of my favourite spice is grown. The
"They had not managed to protect Theo either." Draco points out softly and Harry is forced to think back on the first case he had worked on.
"You mean malfunctions that appear only from time to time?"
“Oh Mr Potter, of course I didn’t mean you.” She all but falls over herself to make sure that he is not leaving.
Getting married - to Harry Potter. They had only just begun to date!
“What’s wrong? Is he ill? Do we need to call a Healer?” The questions just fell from his lips.
“Thank you for having me Aunt Andromeda,” he finally addresses her, as formal as he thinks is appropriate. As he glances at her fully, he is a bit surprised how much she resembles Bellatrix. Well, the Bellatrix that she must have been before madness and Azkaban robbed her of her beauty. But then she smiles again and he sees his mother's smile in the slant of her mouth and the subtle twinkle in her blue eyes. His shoulders relax a fraction at that thought.
"Mrs Malfoy, I think I don't know Draco well enough, to be honest, but I think he loves you very much and is deeply worried right now. And if I interpreted his reaction right, he feels that he should have done more. I believe that the only person he is angry at is himself."
"Yes, and since it is different from your original wand, it should give you better results, than the last replacement wand." He handed Draco a wand, shorter than the one he had before.
“So, not everybody likes dancing,” he bites out when the professor has finished the dance with Malfoy.
“I will not frequent stores that refuse you service. Or anybody else who has been acquitted. I have to believe that our jurisdiction is worth something, and nobody on the street should put their decisions in question! Well, unless they are blatantly wrong. Which they were not in your case. Merlin help me, your trial is on public record! And they just think they can judge. I wonder what they would have done, faced with impossible choices!”
Draco swallows reflexively again, and then begins to pull Harry's clothes off first. Harry helps him, and divests Draco of his clothes. Once they are down to their pants, Harry pulls him towards the bed and they sink onto the sheets. They feel glorious on his heated skin and Draco moans. Harry's hands are everywhere and the sensations are overwhelming. But before Draco loses his mind completely, he needs to tell Harry what he wants.
"You wanted to speak to me?" Draco stood in the office doorway, hands buried deeply in his pockets.
“And how do we solve the problem then?”
Harry shakes his head. "I came home, because I missed you, and now that I know just how well you fuck. Do you really think I will let you go?"
“What? She is okay with you being with me?” Draco is completely baffled.
and was still single?"
"Well, look that it does not become a habit." The department lead nodded. "And because you missed the morning announcements, let me introduce you to our new Office Manager."
Harry, who missed the covert glances Draco threw him when he wasn't looking and the happy smile that Draco hid behind the reports, when he walked back into the office each day without injury or the tired face that he had sported on that first day.
“Hmm” the guttural sounds Draco wrought from him, would have embarrassed Harry, had he not felt the answering hardness that pressed into his backside.
Harry has always been special, even though Draco has tried to convince himself for most of his teens and early twenties, that he would not ever helplessly fall in love, he has his doubts about Harry. The man who has taken it upon himself to make Draco laugh, and puts up with his many antics.
"What she fails to tell you Potter, is that they want to make an example of you. But luckily you have me to thwart their harebrained schemes"
“Hi.” He can’t get his voice to cooperate and ask all of the important questions. But Draco is here and hopefully can help him, with whatever is wrong with him and the baby.
"Glad to be of service. Then let's go!"
Draco thinks of his mother, alone on the continent and he reaches out again. “Maybe, only if you want of course, my mother…”
The stranger said with barely concealed amusement in his voice, but there also was an element of disdain in the tone, which made him all too aware of whom he had just ogled so blatantly.
Draco pulled his wand and cast a few spells.
He can't make heads or tails out of Draco Malfoy. The man looks right at home in this Muggle cafe. But why has he left everything behind? The trials have not stipulated anything more than a year of housearrest, after which Draco Malfoy had simply disappeared. Narcissa Malfoy had searched for her son for a while but stopped the regular visits to the Auror Office after two years.
"This here feels comfortable, though." Harry smiled. "And I really would like to see you again."
As all of his shopping is deducted directly from the vault and the parcels will be delivered via owl he has managed to by Harry a Yule gift right under his nose. The thought makes him smile.
"I understand, but Potter - I meant it when I said my wand saved my life." Draco swallowed and took the wand to set it down carefully. Harry took a deep breath when he saw the burn scars on Draco's palm.
Before he could think too hard about this Draco Apparated. The last thing he saw was Harry's perplexed face.
Harry felt himself blush to the roots of his unruly hair. He knew that voice, of course he did. But he had not seen the man in so long that he had forgotten how tall and bloody fit its owner was.
“Well we all are scarred in one way or another.” Harry reaches out and grasps his forearm, absently touching the ugly scars that Greyback left on him.
"You got hit with a severing curse?" It is more of a statement than a question.
Potter just pulls a wand from his pocket and turns it over towards him handle first. "This is yours. Thank you for letting me use it."
The owl cocked its head inquisitively.
“Potter, I hate to repeat myself - Slytherin’s Dungeons are flooded and frozen, Gryffindor Tower is caught in a perpetual tropical storm. We have nowhere to put the Children apart from the Room of Requirement. Or do you have another idea Headmistress?”
"What is it, Draco?" Fleur asked, her eyes focused on him.
"Master Harry shouldn't be frowning. That gives Master Harry wrinkles, and that is not good for courtship." Tibby popped up just when he made up his mind to floo Bill and ask him.
Harry thought a little and threw out "Last Weekend."
"I did. But I couldn't even treat him right when he loved me, so how am I supposed to make this right again, now that he hates me again?"
“However, I definitely seem to need help and I guess that Pansy knew that you are the healer here.”
"You forced an Apparition into my shop even though you are magically exhausted. Were you trying to get yourself killed?" Harry sounded upset.
"Thank you." Harry was baffled, that Draco had paid such close attention, but dug into the food without further comment. They sat in silence for a while, both eating and enjoying the mild breeze that caressed their skin.
"Where did you find the little guy? And what happened to him?" Vicky switches immediately to a professional mode and leads me to the kitchen where the light is brighter, and she has enough space. She places a sterile cloth over the table and I gently place the cat in the middle of the table.
She nodded and turned towards the back, hollering. "Lucien, i'll est anglais! Il prends un cari!" She motioned for him to sit down, and placed a serviette onto his lap.
“I think part of me, has always been yours. Even when we were at odds, I turned towards you, because you... well, you are just you. You made me work for your attention, and you made me want to be a better person. When we came back in eight year, I loved to make you smile. So, maybe I did love you back then.”
Andromeda has just gone to put Teddy to bed. Draco works on a potions essay and Harry is reading through a book on transfiguration. She remains absent for much longer than usual, but they don’t think much about it. Until Teddy begins to cry like a banshee and nothing happens.
The last fight had not even been a loud one. Draco had simply given up.
And even though there still is work to be done on the robe, Draco forgoes that for the moment in favour of thoroughly kissing his lover.
Of course it will help that Harry will be going with him, if just so he can avoid being spit on.
He forced his eyes open. But the bright lights forced him to close them again. His head felt as if he had collided with a mountain troll, and the taste in his mouth was unpleasant.
Draco stood there, heart racing, silent for a long time.
He forcibly pulls himself together, focusing on the words of the painting.
-----------------------
"Sorry to have made you wait!" When he stepped out into the space behind the counter he could not see the customer clearly, as he stood with his back turned. But what he could see he liked. The man was tall, slim with nice broad shoulders and long legs. Harry smiled. It had been a long time since he had allowed his eyes to wander. But he could appreciate the fine specimen he had in his shop.
"Why?" It seems that right now only one word sentences are possible, but they are better than silence. A tiny twitch around the corner of Draco's mouth makes it easier, to focus, he is married to this man and he has a right to go a little crazy at this moment. He won't break, but a tiny bit crazy here within the protected walls of his home, that is ok.
“No, I like it,” Harry says quickly, without really thinking. “It’s very...sexy.”
Harry took a defiant sip of his tea, which was now at least twenty-five percent sugar. It tasted fantastic if you asked him.
"Haven't got anything else to do," he says simply. He knows he would rather work the eight-til-three shift than do boring things like read the reports that were calling him from his desk at Auror office or help Kreacher tidy his perpetually dusty house. "Besides, sometimes its good to get your hands dirty and mix with the riffraff."
“Fine. Yes, I think you’re...
“Case-in-point,” Ron muttered.
Harry laughed, to Draco’s renewed incredulity. He used his broom to nudge Draco in the side playfully and the latter scowled even deeper.
“Maybe not,” Hermione replied, “but I have Harry as a friend and I learnt to live with his questionable choices long ago.”
Draco looked up and smirked, face centimetres away from Harry’s skin. “Do you really want me to talk about my feelings?” he asked, “or do you want me to put my mouth to good use?”
, was in his shop!” Ron interjects on Harry’s behalf. “Harry told him that he
“Charming, Potter,” Draco had remarked when Harry had led him onto the street front facing number 12 Grimmauld Place. “Forgive me, but it doesn’t feel very
They walked down to the small shed at the back of the garden and Harry rifled through the brooms as quickly as he could to avoid Hermione and Draco having to make stilted conversation with each other. He was desperately trying to eavesdrop as he pushed aside three ancient Cleansweep Sevens which went clattering to the ground.
“So he bequeathed his most despised possession to you?”
“Will it make it any less true if you do?” Harry countered, biting his lip.
,” he said, a little sadly. “You’re Harry Potter.”
Harry narrowed his eyes and turned to face the blonde. “Well do you think I’m good looking?”
To Harry’s complete shock, Malfoy laughs and says, “Bruce Wayne is a hero, Potter. I hardly think we are alike.”
“What would you like to talk about?” Harry asked innocently, accidentally-on-purpose stretching a leg out under the desk to brush against Draco’s.
“Don’t be a tease, Malfoy,” Harry muttered with frustration, as Draco drew his face slightly out of reach.
boy, worthy of stepping foot in this illustrious manor of unfathomable history. The living descendant of the noble line of Black, coming home to-”
She groaned slightly as she sat back on the couch herself, struggling under the weight of her protruding stomach. “Ron, do me a favour and check that Rose is still sleeping?”
“Actually, my strike rate is very good with everyone except you,” Harry said, anticipating the response, “which is why you were my recommendation for this role.” He dropped the paperweight back onto the desk with a flourish.
“You have to admit that
Harry absolutely forgets about his Draco Malfoy-induced anxiety as soon as the Christmas party begins. The buzz of friendly faces, mead, wine and music is making Harry feel unseasonably warm, satiated and comfortable in a way that is unquestionably rare for him.
“After work,” she replies, a smile tugging at her lips. “I invited him to our Christmas party.”
Table twenty-one is tucked behind an overflowing pot of heart-leaf philodendron which hangs in tendrils from a long shelf which runs the length of the exposed brick wall. Harry potted a lot of the plants himself, and this corner was particularly full of greenery to make up for the lack of a window. Harry can see the appeal of it, being tucked away in a dark corner but having the benefit of seeing everyone else.
Harry was stunned. The thought of destroying an old mansion which had probably been the home of Malfoy's for centuries was, in his mind, completely reasonable. But he had to admit, from a pureblood perspective it was highly unusual.
“Thanks,” Harry responded listlessly.
“Wait, Draco-” he pleaded again as his entire lower half of clothing was swiftly removed.
“Anything in particular?” Harry presses.
“I’m not letting you leave here without me,” he says, sticking his chin out defiantly. “As her employer, I have a duty of care-”
Harry coughs loudly. “In what world does inviting Draco Malfoy anywhere constitute being
“I’ll take you in a minute,” Draco muttered and raised another pillow overhead, menacingly.
“I wonder-” Harry began, thinking aloud. “I wonder if there are certain enchantments on this house which prevent anyone other than a lineal descendant accessing it.”
Instantly, he felt himself relax as the familiar touch and scent and taste of Draco enveloped him and pushed him roughly up against the opposite wall.
“So I saw someone suspicious at the cafe on Saturday,” he begins, trying to coax Ron out of his impending bad mood.
“She’s really been diversifying since she left the Harpies,” Ginny says nonchalantly, “maybe I should start a perfume line.”
“Okay, if you want-”Harry said hurriedly, eyes wide and head nodding compliantly.
“Home at
“I think you were just getting to that part,” Draco replied.
Why did Malfoy, of all people, have to be a customer at Harry’s shop? Surely he was far too ridiculously snobby to want to hang about in a muggle-inspired cafe. Ron is right, it is suspicious.
Resting his head on his hands he wonders how long Ron is going to take getting ready. He has work tomorrow, and if he doesn't get to bed before eleven, he might just have to call in sick.
Secondly, it was worth Harry’s time convincing the Department otherwise because instead of sitting on his rooftop, eating a kebab and enjoying the benefits of a warming charm with a subordinate, Harry was now sitting on a rooftop doing such things with a colleague. A subtle, but important difference in the eyes of the Ministry’s ethics committees at least.
It was so
“What do you mean?” Harry asked in what he hoped was an innocent tone. He fought down Auror-Harry’s inclination to start a full blown interrogation.
He has half a mind in the morning to turn up on Malfoy’s front doorstep and ask him if he wants coffee and a hangover potion, but he thinks that could be a bit weird and full on for someone you just tried to make friends with.
“Did you arrange this gorgeous decor, Potter?” Draco taunted as they scaled another staircase adorned by the mummified heads of house elves.
Later, Harry tried to write a letter of condolence to send to the Manor by owl. Unfortunately, despite the fact that he had seen far too many people die in the last ten years of his life, Harry really had no clue how to convey his feelings toward loss. Much less the loss of Lucius Malfoy who, in Harry’s honest opinion, wasn’t much of a loss at all.
He didn't go looking for Potter, he swore to himself. Potter found him, as he usually did, although it was somewhat strange that it was Draco's feet moving, and Potter's that were stationary. To Draco, it seemed that Potter was forever
“Not hard to keep a close watch on someone that’s always hanging around,” Harry replied, and before he could take stock of what was happening, Draco had spun around again on the first floor landing and bailed him up against a wall again.
Harry grinned at her as she lead them through the small cottage to the back door which opened onto a wide, expansive garden. It looked manicured to perfection, but Harry knew that was a testament to Hermione’s brilliant charms work. In fact, the garden beds were hiding a gnome infestation of gargantuan proportions.
“Ah,” said Draco, now seeing the burn-mark present on the tapestry. “That’s rather vitriolic.”
“It’s a muggle thing,” she says flippantly, “Mum and Dad became obsessed with them in Australia. Terrible for your teeth, apparently.”
Harry’s face softened. “Great. Good. I mean, okay.”
“This and that,” Malfoy says, infuriatingly.
“And what’s wrong with Malfoy being in your shop, anyway?” Hermione asks, “it’s a free country.”
"Christmas has got to be the worst time of year," she sighs, scrougifying the foam wand. "Meldrid came in again today you know, and I think this time she only sent her coffee back twice."
“Feel free to borrow it anytime,” Harry said, gesturing towards the quickly discarded book.
“How did you open it?” Harry persisted, still astonished that his ongoing battle with the house had been so easily won by Malfoy.
The fact was, Draco had stewed about this issue for the better part of two years. Unlike Harry Potter, Draco was, even in 2008, surprisingly self-introspective. That also meant he was prone to suppressing his feelings. The problem was, he’d never felt as awfully out of control as he did in that moment.
“Mm?”
“Well I suppose I am somewhat unattractive compared to them,” he sighed, now staring judgementally at Harry who had summoned the sugar bowl and was lifting multiple spoonfuls of the granules into his tea.
Harry’s legs carried him forward, sort of their own volition. Running on instinct, he cupped Draco’s jaw in his hand and lifted his head upwards until the blue-grey and slightly bleary eyes were staring into his own green ones.
Malfoy chokes slightly on his pint but somehow turns it into a respectable cough.
"You must have made a good one," Harry says smirking. The old lady who frequents his cafe always had a thing or two to say about the quality of her coffee, despite asking for a quarter shot cappuccino with milk so hot it needs to be burnt twice over.
His conscious mind prickles at the thought that the revelation that he actually owns nothing
Ron looked stunned. “You managed to avoid seeing the front page of the
“You promised me a tour of the bedrooms, Harry Potter,” Draco said quietly, hand pushing Harry’s t-shirt upwards to expose his skin to Draco’s touch. Harry shivered with anticipation in response as Draco leant down over him again, “and I intend to collect.”
Harry frowned but Hermione actually laughed. Maybe this was okay, after all, Harry thought.
He tried to think of the most un-arousing thing he could. His brain, inexplicably, landed on Gregory Goyle flavoured polyjuice potion. It worked.
Harry raises his eyebrows at her.
doing this weekend,” he complained, stretching his other leg to sit comfortably against Harry’s thigh.
“In a minute,” Draco said, “you can keep telling me how ridiculously good looking I am first.”
, let alone
“Sorry, I was thinking about...work,” Harry said, unconvincingly, leaning back slightly in his chair. “To what do I owe the pleasure, Malfoy?”
“Lack of tasteful execution Potter, as usual,” Draco replied. “Five points from Gryffindor.”
I’m an Auror, if you must know. I thought I already told you I have two jobs, the first time I saw you at the cafe?”
“For Merlin’s sake Potter,” Draco interrupted him. “I’m a Malfoy, I don’t bloody beg.”
“It’s not my job to give the Daily Prophet any ideas for it’s questionable articles, Malfoy” Harry snapped, “it’s only my job to stop you from endangering people’s lives.”
Katie, with the unwilling indenture of her brothers, has transformed the space from casual coffee shop into a Christmas-themed castle, complete with some really complex spellwork which has made the ceiling look like the black starry-sky of the north pole and plastic reindeer which have been charmed to throw their heads and paw at the ground at random intervals. She’s even managed to hang a humongous banner over the tables which reads “The Annual St. Drogo Christmas Bash,” in sparkly green and red letters.
“What on earth is a lemon, lime and bitters?” Harry asks Hermione when he gets back from the bar, juggling two pints and a strange, cordial-like drink.
“Okay, you’re right,” Harry hears Ron say, and knows the bickering is almost at an end. Hermione eyes him suspiciously over the rim of her tall glass and takes a sip.
Ten minutes later, Malfoy descends from the flat and slides back into the car.
The words were innocent enough, Draco reasoned. But the tone was suggestive, and his irritation prickled, irrationally hot over his skin.
Draco leant his head back against the brickwork, eyes looking skyward when they eventually came up for air. Harry couldn’t cope with having to face the reality that Draco might not have enjoyed the experience as much as he did, so he leant his face down and placed light kisses along Draco’s neck instead.
He desperately wished Ron and Hermione hadn’t declined the invitation for tonight. Attending a Healer appointment for their soon-to-be-born second child was probably a decent excuse, Harry reasoned, however it complicated things. Harry had reached such an advanced level of best-friendship with Hermione and Ron that they could literally never feel uncomfortable in each others’ presence. Ron could always be relied upon to make the small-talk more bearable and Hermione, well, Harry
Harry wondered in that moment whether, after all these years, he finally had developed a death wish. He initially fought fate but there just simply wasn’t another way to make Draco Malfoy
Harry picked up one of Draco’s hands and held it, looking as deeply into the pale grey eyes as he could.
“But it is
"A double shot evil with a side of snob," she says, sarcasm rich in her voice. When Harry doesn't reply, she says "an Ethiopian blend soy latte. Whats it to you?"
Hermione’s frown deepened. “I don’t think I want to know,” she said. “Thanks for the offer but I prefer to avoid the risk of falling from a great height.”
The thought came to him as he smiled, a little forcefully at a waiter as he accepted a full champagne flute from a silver-gilded tray and turned to face the remainder of the room. His eyes, almost immediately (and wholly involuntarily, Harry thought) found the back of a pale blonde and meticulously groomed head. Equal parts aristocratic and impressive, with just the slightest hint of obsessive-compulsive.
“It’s always been my specialty,” Malfoy retorts, but there’s no malice in his tone. He looks at Harry appraisingly. “Why are you talking to me?”
It was after seven thirty by the time they actually sat down to eat their mildly warm noodles. Rose had a tantrum over bath time and then it had taken Ron a solid thirty minutes to convince Molly that she didn’t need to be both their full time babysitter and personal chef. She protested and used Harry as an example by saying that he looked far too thin, but was eventually persuaded by Ron’s argument that Harry wasn’t in fact their child and actually, Harry never said that Molly couldn’t be
"Would you like me to leave?"
the sheets to within an inch of their life on Draco’s insistence, but cleaning so thoroughly that it might have reduced the thread count evidently hadn’t been enough to convince him.
Harry ignores her statement. "Why is Malfoy in my shop?" He blurts out, against his better judgment.
Malfoy,” he finishes, then immediately frowns as he realises his parents appear to have followed similar naming conventions.
“This is a gratitude drink, Potter,” Malfoy retorts, “not the Inquisition.”
Harry balks, then he realises he’s still sitting in Malfoy’s car when he could be outside getting himself home.
In this new world, there is no Chosen One, no secret connection into the enemy's mind, and thankfully, no personal threat to Harry's life.
"Right. Thanks," he mutters appreciatively. He knows Luciana is only looking out for him, but her strict mothering reminds him of a dangerous combination of Molly Weasley and Minerva McGonagall, and he isn't sure he could spend much more than the ten to twelve hours a day he already does with her at the office. He was warned that being an Auror was a difficult job and involved perfecting the art of reading people. This is something Harry has found exceptionally hard, having a range of emotional intelligence only slightly superior to Ron's. However, he never anticipated the other challenges which accompanied having one's own secretary. A secretary who prefers to act simultaneously as his surrogate mother.
“Draco.”
He takes a sip of his beer. It’s cool on his tongue and simultaneously warms his insides as it makes its way down his throat. Maybe he does have an alcohol problem, he thinks, looking down at himself. The beer definitely isn’t doing anything to improve his physique. Temporarily being stuck in the office isn't either. He makes a mental note to research an exercise routine on the new computer he purchased for himself for his last birthday. The internet is a wild place, he thinks.
Draco appraised him again.
“No!” Harry exclaimed, a little too quickly.
Harry bit his lip. “That’s not consent, Draco.”
“What?! That’s misuse of your powers, Harry!”
Now Draco sat on his bed, shirtless again and as beautiful as he had ever been, but looking uncertain as he picked at the sheets between his fingers.
“Well, I’m an Auror,” he says with what he hopes is conviction but what sounds sort of like an excuse. “I’m going through wizarding records all day.”
Harry opens and closes his mouth like a trout. At some point he manages to splutter at her, “I’m not gay!”
While Hermione and Ron launch into a bickering session that could last until they are all deceased, Harry scans the crowd at the Cornish Arms. They choose the muggle pub routinely because the muggle paraphernalia and exclusively muggle drinks would likely overwhelm any witch or wizard. It is also full of weirdly dressed, young types which help them blend in.
“It’s not like I tried to, believe me. But it’s just that I like talking to you and looking at you and being with you, and conjuring up questions I can to ask you at work that I secretly already know the answer to. Or finding you at these god-awful Ministry events because I feel comfortable with you in a way I don’t feel with anyone else. Or inviting you to my rooftop in the middle of winter to eat a kebab and divulge my persistent, unrequited feelings because I just can’t help but want to spend more of my time with you, even if it makes absolutely no fucking sense.”
It was painful.
“Help me,” he groans. “I need coffee.”
“It’s like hearing about one of my family snogging!” Ron protested. “Like Ginny snogging somebody!”
The stack of paper looks forlorn and limp but Harry resists the urge to pick them up and pushes them roughly to the side of the desk. Future Harry's problem, he decides. He isn't sticking around today to do them. If Luciana is ever right about anything, it is that a tea-related disaster might occur if he tries to push his exhausted mind any farther.
“I’m not asking you to marry me, Draco,” he joked, but somewhere inside him lurched a little at that thought. “I just needed to tell you. For my own sanity.”
“Well, I know you’ve got that weird thing where you need to know where he is all the time, but after last night…” Ron trailed off, looking at Harry as though he was a tyrannical workaholic. Given how little Harry had professionally achieved that day, nothing could have been further from the truth.
“I just told him I worked there.”
"Merlin, she's a pain!" Katie hisses, on her fourth Meldrid-inspired coffee. The spiralling, muggle coffee grinder whirls as Katie taps out the excess in the pan into the bin, a little harder than is strictly necessary.
“I do apologise for interrupting,” Draco said, completely unapologetically, over the mumble that spilled out of Potter's mouth. Potter turned slightly to face him, as if to question his authority to speak over the boy-that-lived, but really, at what point in time had Draco Malfoy ever cared about Harry Potter's authority? Perhaps only once, and that was beneficial in getting himself a pardon from Azkaban.
“That’s very sugary sweet, Potter,” Draco said, his trademark smirk plastered on his face.
The thought that he could have enjoyed more than three months of an extremely normal, clandestine, quasi-relationship with his former-school-enemy-turned-passionate-lover was really too much to ask of the universe.
“Where. Have. You. Been,” Draco demanded, words punctuated by rough kisses down Harry’s neck. Harry temporarily failed to respond as Draco attacked the soft flesh where his neck and shoulder met and he sighed in contentment.
After numerous interruptions, Harry had managed to get Mr Grange to owl the printing department to pull the story. It wasn’t without pain and suffering, however. Mr Grange had insisted that Harry explain to the relevant reporter why his maiden exposé had been scrapped.
Capitalising on Walburga’s momentary shock he grasped the curtain and wrenched it closed, just as Walburga had begun screeching “Abomination! Shame!” Her words carried off and dissolved into the air as the curtains hung still.
“But your father was an only child?”
“I quite like being burned into your memory,” Harry replied, happily turning a loop-the-loop and feeling the wind rush through his hair.
“Even for a terribly antisocial person, this is outrageous, Potter,” Malfoy said as Harry flopped down on the synthetic grass covering his rooftop terrace. Given his slightly intoxicated state and his giddiness from the delicious feeling of the warming charm, his drying attempt had only partially worked. He frowned and tried again, willing the plastic to dry out enough for him to avoid getting his only nice suit wet.
"I work here," Harry says. He's not sure why he didn't say something impressive like "I own this place," which would be true and would also make him look like less of an idiot, but the moment has passed and he just lingers.
“The Kelley brothers?!” Ron barks suddenly.
“You could be more conciliatory, you know,” Katie argues, as they pack up the cafe together an hour later. Malfoy had left the shop not ten minutes ago and Katie is, for some inexplicable reason, throwing down the gauntlet for a former Death Eater.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh at Draco’s dark expression. The pale grey eyes had turned stormy, framed by perfect, blonde eyebrows that had distorted themselves into a deep frown.
“Yes, but literally every other witch and wizard reads it mate,” Ron said, exasperation lacing his tone, “including the hundred odd people who would have walked through the atrium with you this morning, then the ten or so in the lift. Jenkins, in the office down the hall always has it open on his desk when you walk into the headquarters-”
“Don’t have a crisis, Harry,” she says, with bemused satisfaction. “No one is asking you to snog anyone.”
the back of the cabinet under the machine. “We invited regulars last year! I thought you wanted a repeat of my incredible organisational feat.”
"How many jobs does someone like yourself need?" Malfoy retorts, then adds, "surely people are falling over each other to give you their first born child, let alone anything else you may need."
“I’m just saying, from an impartial point of view-”
Harry pauses for a moment in mock consideration.
“You should learn to sleep more,” she says, prodding his cheek with her finger as he collapses his head onto his hands on the counter top.
. His secretary was a muggleborn for Merlin’s sake and Draco had
“I think for the sake of both of your sanities, we need to get out of here,” Ron surmised.
“Right,” Harry said as if he understood. It was terribly unconvincing.
“Is your driving that bad?” he quips, and he sees the corner of Malfoy’s lips turn up slightly.
“Perhaps I should work here,” Draco Malfoy says, as Harry puts the soy latte down and slides into the booth opposite him. “It seems to have a relaxed policy towards actually working. Very
In usual Harry fashion, his brain leaps to fifty different conclusions, most of them arousing various levels of suspicion. He isn't sure why he's suddenly so nervous about this turn of events. Maybe, he thinks somewhere in his racing mind, its the after effect of having not seen this particular person in over six years. Not since the battle of Hogwarts. Not since Harry had, quite literally, saved his life. Harry had testified at the trials of course, but he had been called to testify during the amalgamated sentencing hearings, before any of the defendants had actually been presented to face their fate.
“I haven’t actually said anything to him yet,” he said, trying very hard not to look at Hermione.
“Harry it’s not my fault you enjoy drinking the extract of beans,” Ron says, waving his hand.
,” Ron countered, although it was barely audible due to the quantum of dumplings which were occupying Ron’s mouth. Hermione looked mildly disgusted.
Draco reached his free hand over to press part of it down. Predictably, it sprang right back up. He cocked his head slightly, as if trying to comprehend it.
Draco’s eyes glimmered dangerously. “Well, for some inexplicable reason,” he murmured, leaning across the table slightly as if to tell Harry a dark secret, “I have this
Harry quirked an eyebrow, moving backwards to sit on the couch opposite the tapestry. He motioned for Draco to sit beside him. “Try me.”
“No, thank you,” he said, smiling benignly at the dark-haired waitress.
“This is...nice,” Harry says, uncertainly.
a situation, Harry assumed that it meant he was being sent back to the field. Unfortunately for Harry, it actually meant quickly and quietly stopping the Daily Prophet from printing a story. A story that would have simultaneously alerted the smugglers to the operation, and named three of his undercover operatives.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t realise,” Harry whispered into Draco’s lips as he captured Harry’s with his again and pulled him in for a searing kiss.
“You’re hardly in the way,” she replies, gesturing around them. “Do you like being in Siberia all the time or will you come out to be amongst the people one day?”
He doesn't.
“This is terribly uncouth, Potter,” he drawled, picking at the top of his kebab with his long fingers and sniffing it delicately.
“It’s not like that, Hermione!” he insisted, running his free hand through the birds’ nest mop that habituated itself on his head.
He picks up the set anyway, ignores the pointed stares from people around him and shouts the cashier down about insisting on paying.
“Christ, I-” he said, voice an octave or so too high.
“Oh hello, Potter,” Malfoy says as an afterthought after seeing Harry propped up on the stool behind the counter. “Working hard, I see,” he smirks.
a regular, Harry. He comes here every Saturday without fail.”
Strange as it might have been, entering into the workforce an assumed expert was very overwhelming, however he thankfully hadn't been the only one struggling in that surreal situation. When Ron had suggested moving towards specialising in tactic and strategy, Harry had been wary, as his natural inclination had been towards investigation and field work. He still feels a little lost without his best friend constantly by his side in the field, but at the same time, he supposes this isn't like school, or hunting horcruxes. He isn't the assumed leader and there is no real difference in skill or power between them.
The alcohol has made him warm and fuzzy and he doesn’t feel the cold of the snowflakes falling on his cheeks. Only that they’re slightly wet and run down his face a bit. He wonders if he’s actually sober enough not to splinch himself on the apparition home.
“Ron’s not home, just so you know” she said, as if Ron would have been thrilled to see Draco Malfoy there, in the flesh.
Ron raised an eyebrow. “Christ, Harry, you’re wound up tighter than a werewolf at full moon. What did you put in your breakfast this morning?”
Harry has to agree with her, the old bat has been demanding as ever today, and the shop had only just started to ease up after the mid-morning Saturday rush. He's cleared sixteen tables in the last twenty-five minutes, which is a miracle considering that every single customer, particularly the old ladies, want to stand and have a conversation with him. It's like he's a magnet for people who want to tell him about their garden gnome infestation or ask if the Auror Office has done anything about their neighbour who they believe to be breeding dangerous chimeras but whom Harry knows is really just setting off a set of muggle fireworks.
Harry felt Draco stiffen halfway up the stairs as he led the way to the first floor. Probably at the elf heads, Harry thought, although Draco’s reaction was far more muted than the outright horror most people displayed. Harry wondered whether the Malfoy Manor had a collection of elf heads. He couldn’t recall seeing any, but then again, during his first and only visit to the Manor he had been largely preoccupied with not getting killed.
When his predecessor had requested that he
“-and Narcissa, beautiful Narcissa, has produced a
One thing they don’t talk about is Hogwarts, which is a relief because the Hogwarts-Malfoy that Harry remembers is a merciless bully and an absolute prat and this Malfoy doesn’t seem at all like that. In fact, Harry has to admit that he sort of
Harry chalks the last one up to his curiosity. It’s just like at Hogwarts, he rationalises. He needs to have one eye on Malfoy at all times for security purposes. Malfoy has always been a threat (albeit a mild one). Harry is right to be curious about it all.
“Right. Cool,” he says, willing his breathing to go back to normal but recognising the uncomfortable feeling of anxiety wrapping itself around his stomach.
“Oh yeah,” Harry mumbles, trying to find the right parting words to your former arch-nemesis who has actually turned out to be a half decent human being. “Well, thanks for tonight, and um...I’ll see you soon?”
“Rebuilt?” he asked, tentatively.
"I'm leaving," says a familiar voice at around five in the evening. Harry looks up into stern green eyes, adorned by greying, wispy hair.
She wiggles an eyebrow. Harry frowns at her.
Harry’s hands ball into fists at his sides, the spark of indignation well and truly lit. If there is one thing Draco Malfoy does very well, his subconscious reasons, it is hitting all of Harry’s buttons until one of them breaks.
“Who likes losing?” Draco shot back, incredulously. “Especially to
Ginny and Katie each arch an eyebrow in unison. It’s a bit creepy, if he’s being honest.
“You’ve got an awfully social job for an anti-social being, Potter,” Draco retorted.
Ron shrugs. “You might have been a nefarious character.”
To add insult to injury Harry thinks, Luciana wasn’t even able to turn up anything on Malfoy’s employment search. The location search indicated that Malfoy was no longer living in Salisbury, Wiltshire (which Harry envisages is probably the location of the Malfoy Manor), but in Bayswater, London. It is hardly going to be a housing downgrade in Bayswater Harry considers, but he has to admit he is surprised in Malfoy’s choice of suburb. Bayswater is very
“Not a very good one,” he says, frowning.
This is what life is now, Harry supposes as he runs his hands through his hair under the comforting jet of hot water. At least during his years of being in mortal peril he could do something about the near-constant anxiety and fear. Now he just dreams about those times with no ability to make the seemingly endless loop of memories stop. There’s next to nothing he can do about the nightmares and the sleep deprivation, but they’re things that he has unwillingly accepted are likely to accompany him to the grave.
Christmas party,” Harry says pointedly.
“Not if I’m allergic to the colour green,” Harry muttered darkly. Draco, predictably, ignored him.
“An interesting thought,” Harry mused, for the first time wondering whether or not his succession of the house by Sirius had been successful. Draco was, after all, a living male in the lineage of the house of Black. The Order had assumed that because Draco only had grounds to inherit it through his mother (much like Teddy), that the chain of inheritance had been broken. The house had, so far, been pliant with Harry’s ownership, including his ability to give orders to Kreacher. However, Draco had been unaware of the existence of number 12 Grimmauld Place until this very moment.  Harry wondered whether or not that made a difference.
remember what happened last time you came up with a wild theory on Malfoy.”
“Something like that,” Harry said, smiling in spite of himself. He plucked the folded piece of parchment out from the inner pocket and levitated it across to Malfoy’s left hand with a non-verbal incantation.
Harry rolled his eyes and commenced drawing patterns on Draco’s inner thigh instead.  “If it makes a difference, Draco, you’re not the last Black.”
“Point taken,” Ron said, flopping into the opposite armchair.
He tells Levi that they’re closed for tomorrow and can deal with the mess in the morning, or afternoon, or whenever they get over their hangovers and shoos him out as well despite his mild protestations. Then he goes to look for Katie.
Utterly intoxicated by the closeness and the intimacy, Harry breathed in the familiar scent of sandalwood and citrus, and pressed a small kiss into the back of Draco’s neck. His nose felt the soft tickle of the tendrils of blonde hair that lay haphazardly across the pillow. Draco sighed softly, evidently still asleep, and wriggled back into Harry’s arms.
Harry smiled in spite of himself. “You didn’t know this apartment had lighting?” he asked, playfully.
The stress of effectively having two full time jobs is another thing entirely. Despite almost never actually working at the cafe, he is always finding himself making the short trudge from the workers exit at the Ministry to Diagon Alley. Mostly, he does various and somewhat pointless tasks such as rearranging the tables (much to Katie's dismay), or potting new plants to hang off the baskets and shelves he has around the place.
He isn’t sure why he makes the decision to partake in that unusual form of self-flagellation, but surprisingly he actually does feel better for it after he takes a second shower, eats a relatively healthy breakfast (which doesn’t include four sausages and white bread slathered with butter
“So your father’s cousins?”
And then the hooded person pushes back the hood and Harry sees a shocking mop of white blond hair and he
“Why?” he whispered, looking down at his hands.
Harry has to concede that he does not. He hasn’t, in recent memory, ever bothered to exchange his galleons for pounds, because he has no reason to. He lives almost exclusively in wizarding England, and for some reason, Malfoy doesn’t seem to be doing the same.
“How on earth are we going to tell if Harry Potter looks like a blast-ended skrewt in things if you look like someone else?” Ginny asks. Her tone is slightly incredulous but her mouth twitches like it always does when she’s trying not to laugh.
As it turns out, Harry is very happy with his choice of shopping assistant, despite the lump that is beginning to form on the back of his head. He’s forgotten completely about the quarter-life crisis he was enduring not two hours ago and is instead trying to coax Christmas present ideas out of her.
“The house I own is at number 12 Grimmauld Place, London.”
“Then I won’t do it.”
Harry laughed. This was surprisingly easy. It had definitely helped that Draco didn’t seem to want to apparate away from him, or recommend he book himself in for a stay at St. Mungos. He had even let Harry
Harry prayed that this wasn’t, in fact, a terrible idea.
“Hmm,” Ron says, apparently unperplexed. “Sorry Harry, this case has really got me. I can’t think of anyone else right now.”
“You weren’t at work today, though,” Harry said, reaching out to brush imaginary lint from Draco’s cashmere-clad shoulder as if he couldn’t bear to break contact, “and I sort of assumed that-”
“I’ll go get the firewhisky,” muttered Ron.
“Are you always this annoying?” Harry says, frowning again.
Harry shook his head. “Also untrue. Your other Aunt is still alive, Andromeda. As is her grandson.”
Malfoy raised both eyebrows in restrained surprise. “Something about keeping your enemies close?”
“What can I get for you, Sir?” The waitress replied, her smooth voice tinged with annoyance.
“Fine. But your mother was a muggleborn so-”
Draco moaned a profanity into his lips as Harry’s hips moved against his, craving the contact. Draco pushed back and redoubled the urgency of his kisses, now trailing a line down Harry’s neck again and igniting little fires on Harry’s skin as he went. He reciprocated by lowering his hand on Draco’s lower back and pushing their bodies closer still, the heat and the hardness now painfully evident through their clothes.
“And?” Harry asks, still not quite grasping the point.
“He’s probably keeping tabs on you for something,” Ron says, directing his attention at Harry and ignoring Hermione who is having a minor meltdown. “We should see if he’s there this Saturday.”
“Please,” he continued, feeling a bit pathetic. “If I’m horrible to sleep next to, you never have to stay again.”
Draco’s eyes widened, panic momentarily rendering him lost for words.
Not least by Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy who, Harry guessed, probably hadn’t been informed that their son had engaged in precisely six storage-cupboard trysts with him that week.
Harry didn’t even bother to weigh in. He was just happy with the company.
“Easy Potter,” she laughs, “you’re too easy to rile up.”
Harry looks down at his lapel and sighs. It is becoming a regular occurrence. He decides to push on with his request. “Luciana could you do an employment and location check for me?” he asks, trying to shift the attention towards work and wondering how he can make this request sound as professional as possible.
Harry groaned. Hermione flopped herself down on the couch next to him and flung her arms around his neck.
“I don’t actually care what those people think,” he said, crossing his arms at the table.
Draco swallowed visibly and shut The Quibbler on his lap. “Nothing you do is truly
“How on earth are we supposed to answer that for you, Harry?” Hermione asked, exasperated.
Draco sighed. “I know you don’t, because you’re the Chosen One and you can do whatever you like.”
“Can we relocate?” he asked, tugging Harry’s arm softly and leading him out of the kitchen.
Harry stuck his head around the portrait, interrupting Walburga’s dreary oration. “Actually, he’s come here to shag me.”
“I’m not, you know, shagging anyone else.”
Another question, Harry muses as he pores over the report without really reading it, is why he feels so
“You ate all of yours too!”
“That’s unfortunate,” she quips, pouring the latte. “Here, this could elevate you back to a three.”
“Enough with the questioning about Malfoy!” Harry exclaimed. “We
Draco rolled his eyes.
"Pleasure's all mine," she replies, tossing the tea towel on the bench and scrugifying it, "but I'm still working the coffee, so you can do till and floor."
Harry laughed. “If you wanted to clean an old house with me so badly, Draco, you could have just asked.”
He totally forgets about the restless anticipation he had been experiencing as he got dressed in his new, properly fitting black jeans, white shirt and emerald cashmere sweater that Ginny forced him to spend too many galleons on. This is his comfortable place and he’s having the most fun he’s probably had since this time last year.
He paused as he lifted the sheets and the duvet up to slide under it and looked across at Harry.
“What about Malfoy,” Harry snapped, whipping his head up to face Hermione. He wasn’t in the mood to be berated about his Malfoy problem on a day that was already a complete mess.
“Do you always drink soy?” He asks, trying to steer the conversation towards something relatively non-controversial.
“Whose idea was the kebabs?”
“Is he?” Harry asked, genuinely curious. He wasn’t sure how one established relationships in the post-war adult world where your would-be significant other was a war criminal and you were a war hero and so logically, you didn’t tell many people about it.
"Yes boss," he smiles. "You okay to open tomorrow? Ron's going to floo in soon, so I can close this up."
He ignores her pointed look.
“Why don’t you talk to him then, instead of forcing me to,” Harry grumbles as he scribbles down the takings for the day.
“Mm?”
Harry nestles Katie’s head back against his shoulder and shoots a furtive look at Malfoy.
to one-up them?”
“You didn’t come to hide amongst the curtains to avoid waiters then, Potter?” Draco countered, smirking. “You can thank me later.”
"Of course," he says with an air of forced nonchalance. "I've already looked at a few."
Harry grinned involuntarily. “My rooftop, my rules, Malfoy,” he said, “sit yourself down you snobby prat and eat your kebab.”
He can’t see her face, but he knows she’s rolling her eyes.
“Because he’s a regular and that’s what my mandated invite list includes!” Katie says, with exasperation.
you?”
Potter nodded and stared at his glass for a moment longer. Then he rounded on Draco Malfoy, glassy, green eyes piercing under the mop of perpetually messy hair. Draco’s stomach lurched. He wondered whether he really was allergic to caviar.
Harry’s stomach flips and he feels slightly ill. He wonders why he feels so
Harry scoffed. “I’d love to see your interpretation of tasteful, Malfoy.” He could feel Draco’s smirk permeating the back of his neck.
this new Malfoy with his weird knowledge of muggle pop culture which is admittedly far better than Harry’s.
Harry smiled and gestured towards the stairs. “Lead the way.”
One huge benefit to living in a rural wizarding village and not in the middle of London, Harry thought as he kicked off the ground and felt the familiar rush, was that you could just get on a broomstick whenever you pleased. You didn’t need to stash your broomstick at your best friend’s house and apparate there to use it.
Draco looked down at his hands. “Yes, well it’s lucky you didn’t. Who else would have been insane enough to wait for you for hours in your pitch black kitchen?”
"Drinking coffee," Malfoy says, simply, raising a blond eyebrow. "And you are?"
Draco stared at him for a second. He swallowed.
He scours the shelves for a good two minutes before he remembers he can actually do magic, and accio-ing the Mauritian and Ethiopian blend, he grabs both black packets and hurries back out to the front of house.
“You should quit,” she says, in a matter-of-fact way. “Find a new job with better work-life balance. I’ll hire you.”
So Harry does what Harry does best, and says something that later, he will attempt to kick himself in the face for.
She narrows her eyes in response. Clearly, Harry thinks, Luciana rates herself more highly than Ron in matters of observation.
“Surely someone like you can afford chairs, Potter,” Malfoy sniffed disdainfully, looking down at him.
“How many espresso martinis, Katie?” he asks, grabbing her arm and pulling her up like a rag doll. She immediately sinks her head back onto Malfoy’s shoulder and looks blearily at Harry.
“I hardly think you should be,” he said, “I wouldn’t deserve it.”
, anyway. To be fair, Draco had never had a friend close enough to impart one’s darkest secrets to. It wasn’t a very Slytherin trait to speak with such candour.
"You know," Harry says, as a quill gets squashed underneath another mountain of levitated books, "I think they say parenting is a full time job, too."
Draco, obedient for once, looked up at him, his head resting on Harry’s stomach. “What’s so important?” he whispered, lowering his lips to Harry’s stomach again but somehow maintaining eye contact.
Harry’s face flushed at the insult. Those “facts” were barely true, at best. He had a sneaking suspicion Draco Malfoy had been writing them for years. It would certainly explain how half of Wizarding England believed he had a nipple piercing.
His immediate thought was that Draco was going to ask him to do something on the weekend. Like a
Malfoy smirks. “You don’t like the Gallardo, Potter?”
“I might have been Kinglsey Shacklebolt,” Harry says drily, pointing to the large stack of unread reports which now sit innocently on one side of Ron’s desk.
“So Harry, I know you’re upset about Lucius-” she began.
Harry snorts. “Yeah, we can call it e
“Ron!” Harry exclaimed. “A brief synopsis, if you will?”
“You have, haven’t you,” she continues. “I can see it on your robes.”
"Alright there butter fingers?" he hears Katie say, but he only half registers it. He definitely doesn't turn to reply. He has no time to think about anything else because in that moment his heart leaps to his chest in a moment of panic as he recognises the back of the head of someone he never, in a million years would have thought would enter his muggle-inspired cafe.
Malfoy’s eyes go hard again and Harry’s heart skips a little in anticipation. “It’s your Ministry, Potter, why can’t you ask them?”
