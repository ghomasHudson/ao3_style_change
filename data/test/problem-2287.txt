With those words, he opened his arms wide, offering Draco an embrace. Draco, without the slightest hesitation, fell forward and curled into Harry’s arms, allowing him to engulf him completely. He closed his eyes and allowed his emotions to take over. They consumed him and feeling safe and secure in Harry’s arms, he let them. Harry held him tight and soothingly stroked his back. He was vaguely aware of the fact that Harry was also removing the rope harness from around his torso but made no move to protest. Instead, he shifted gently, making it a little easier for Harry to loosen the rope.
, he reminded himself firmly, then huffed out a hollow laugh. As Director of the Department for Magical Law Enforcement, he had more than enough experience in that particular area, though he wasn’t entirely sure whether those skills were good enough to talk Draco off a ledge.
Harry dragged him over to a door that let out of his office but not out onto the corridor, and although Draco didn’t want to follow him, although he tried to resist, he could do nothing but helplessly stumble along. Harry unlocked the door with the help of a magic spell, and opening it, he pushed him inside.
, an animated musical that had just started on one of the kids’ channels. He shuffled on the sofa and moving closer to Draco, he curled up beside him, boldly claiming Draco’s thigh as his pillow, and using the large blanket to cover the rest of him.
It didn’t that Harry had been forced to adjust the wards on their home and restrict the delivery of their mail to the Ministry’s post room.
“Some would,” she said, “but you know that it’s impossible to please everyone. There will always be a few people who envy you for how you’ve turned your life around and the achievements you made along the way.”
After a while, he gradually came to a halt in front of the thick iron bars, and slowly reaching out, he wrapped his fingers around the cold iron. It pulsed with magic, and for a second, curiosity pushed him towards stupidity, and Draco found himself considering casting a wandless spell. He wanted to see whether Harry had told the truth, and dithered for the longest time, but instead of eventually giving in to the temptation, he contented himself with the thrumming feeling beneath his fingers and tapped his fingers lightly against the thick bars that presently kept him confined.
He let his thumb linger for another few moments, then pulled away but reached for Draco’s hand and lacing their fingers together, he squeezed gently.
Harry stroked him through his orgasm, gently milking him until he had nothing left to give, then let go and used magic to clean his hand.
The thought rang in his mind, and this time, Draco couldn’t quite keep the sob inside. Hot tears spilt over the rims of his eyes, and he cried, quietly, flushing with embarrassment but not feeling strong enough to pull away from Harry and hide underneath the covers.
“Unless we opt for the daybed or the back of that new and fancy sofa, I don’t see how that’s possible. I’m too old for carpet burns.”
“Oh, I’m sorry for that terrible experience, that’s got to have been a proper pain and not really what you want when you’re decorating a new home. Are you two lovelies married?”
He watched as Harry waved his hand, and the room instantly felt warmer. The soft tendrils of Harry’s wandless, non-verbal warming charm flowed over Draco’s naked body, and he shuddered, not because he was cold, but because the way Harry cared for him, and made his comfort a priority, turned him on. It made him feel loved and treasured like he was Harry’s most prized possession, and Draco savoured the feeling.
“I think five of your favourite chocolates should do the trick, don’t you? And after that, if you decide that you want to be a good boy and talk to me again, we can negotiate about adding to the deal. I can think of a few things to sweeten it even further.”
“I just want to make sure that it’s going to work. Harry’s pretty smart, and if I’m frank, I’m rubbish at lying to him. He has this uncanny ability to make me want to spill the truth…”
Pandora’s Box frowned upon rule breakers and those who didn’t respect the community and its people. That was why it was one of Britain’s most exclusive BDSM Dungeons and notoriously difficult to get into. The vetting process was strict and even an excellent and reliable recommendation from an upstanding member of the community only improved things marginally.
All but the dark-brown one, the cheekiest of them all, wriggled out of his embrace but stayed close by. The curious cub was quite content to curl up in his arms and promptly went to sleep there. Harry, enamoured by the sheer love and thoroughly excited over the fact that his friend had introduced him to her babies, lay down in the warm sunshine, rolled onto his side and curling up beside Accalia, he held the dark cub against his chest and closed his eyes, ready to doze off at a moment’s notice. Accalia’s cubs, however, didn’t share his desire to bathe in the warm sunshine and pestered him until he reluctantly gave up on the idea of having a nap and resumed playing with them, rolling about the thick grass and letting them hug their short legs around his arms and legs to convey their love. Occasionally, the cubs tried to bite him, but their teeth barely left a mark on his skin. Harry couldn’t help but wonder whether they were too young to use actual force or smart enough to tell the difference between a human playmate and food.
He tried his hardest to pretend that the playful notes of lavender, honeydew melon, pink pepper, and pineapple leaf―the foundation of the ridiculously expensive fragrance he’d bought for Harry for Christmas―weren't getting to him. The unique blend of smells teamed with patchouli leaves and produced an intense yet distinctive scent that Draco wasn’t entirely immune against. It was daring and bold, the very embodiment of Harry’s character. Inhaling deeply, Draco shuffled a little closer. Even though it reverberated in the small space between Harry’s lips and the side of his neck, he resolutely ignored Harry’s warm chuckle and watched as Harry pulled out his phone. It was encased in a magic-repelling protective cover that still allowed Harry to use the phone without having to fear that the remnant magic lingering inside the room was going to mess with the phone’s mild electric currents.
Even though a part of him wanted to snap at Potter and tell him to take his uncontrollable outburst and go to hell, he perfectly understood why Potter struggled to keep his emotions in check, especially now. It wasn’t so much actual anger that fuelled his rage but frustration, desperation, and sadness. He felt lost, hopeless, and he most definitely missed his job, that much was clear to Draco. Potter hadn’t outright said so, but Draco was convinced that he felt rather useless. He’d tried to get Potter to help him with his charity and thought of other ways to keep him busy. In the end, leaving him to travel to Hogwarts, shift and chase but not kill innocent rabbits through the Forbidden Forest until he’d managed to exhaust himself seemed like the most reasonable solution. Strangely enough, it was something that kept Potter sane.
“Would you mind? Just focus on the design and leave the parenting to me, if it’s all the same to you.”
“I could always try and guess but judging by the colour of your cheeks, you’ll accidentally use your magic to force the ground to open up and swallow you alive, and while that spell is entirely reversible, it requires a high level of concentration and given this afternoon’s engagement, I just don’t think I’m in the right headspace to disentangle Britain’s Golden Boy from the stubborn vines of ancient French soil.”
Draco watched him take one look at them both, and his first response was to raise an eyebrow questioningly.
, darling, but not to worry, I love you no matter what. And I won’t forget, I’ll get you that bottle of red on Friday.”
Instead of allowing the memory of Harry’s naked, ripped body turn into his undoing, Draco amused himself with an anecdote from earlier this morning. Harry had been unable to decide between wearing a burgundy button-up shirt and a more Slytherin-themed one.
“None. I read them all, but I’ve not responded to any of them. I’ve no desire to uproot Scorpius and move abroad. I’m quite happy here in good ole’ England, you know?”
They sat in comfortable silence for a bit, each one of them lost in their own thoughts, and just as Harry had decided to eat several pancakes, Draco rose to his feet and walked around the large round table. He wordlessly wrapped his arms around Harry, who, without a moment’s hesitation, reciprocated the unexpected but not unwelcome embrace. They shared a slow kiss, and once Draco pulled away, he rested his forehead against Harry’s, who kept his eyes closed and delighted in the faint tingle of feeling Draco’s warm breath against his lips.
Its crack sounded a lot more menacing than the Cattleman’s Crack, which was kind of playful, and Draco jumped a little. Charlie quickly distracted him with another type of crack ― a casual flick behind his back.
Draco huffed out a breath of warm laughter and delighted in the visible tremor that surged through Potter.
He deliberately remained quiet for another minute or two and paid close attention to Draco’s facial expressions. He looked mildly uncomfortable but not wholly terrified, and Charlie took that as a good sign. He was about to continue with his story when Draco opened his mouth and asked him a question.
Draco didn’t want to blush, but he couldn’t help it. He could feel the heat in his cheeks and coughing, he inspected the remaining half of his biscuit and silently counted all the raisins.
Harry finished steeping the tea and after he’d carried the steaming teapot and the two non-matching mugs over to the table, Draco, who’d walked over to the table as well, took an oddly-wrapped gift box out of his black leather satchel and placed it in front of Harry.
Slipping into a pair of plain black boxer briefs, Harry adjusted the waistband until it sat perfectly, then stepped into a pair of charcoal tracksuit bottoms and pulled a loose black long-sleeved shirt over his head.
“Kink, raising a child together, our respective careers, my desire to spent more time with men, our marriage. In the end, something had to give, Harry.”
To Draco’s absolute horror, Potter remained thoroughly unfazed and merely roared with laughter in response to his rant. Even though Draco rather liked the sound of Potter’s unrestrained hysterics―there was something warm and rich about it―and found them mildly infectious even, he most stubbornly kept a straight face and swallowed the urge to throw the contents of his water glass into Potter’s face.
birthday, which had coincided with the announcement of him taking over the Deputy Department Head position for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, an extension of his duties as Head Auror. What it essentially meant was that instead of being able to focus on training his Aurors and dealing with a daily avalanche of paperwork, that was already overwhelming, he now spent an insane amount of his time in boring meetings. Ninety-nine per cent of the time they did not require his presence or input.
“Because I’m interested in how you managed to solve the puzzle that is my wolf and me, but I’d also like to devote some time to properly snogging your face off, and since you insist on having dinner first, you leave me with no choice but to take you on a date someplace fancy.”
“Just a bit longer, my precious little prince,” Harry whispered. “You’re my good boy; you’re so good for me, you’re doing so well.”
“Admittedly, I do, however, that won’t stop me from directing a stinging hex into the general direction of your buttocks.”
Feeling privileged, Charlie treasured the chance to see Draco without all of his masks, and he rather liked this completely unguarded version of Draco. He was full of warmth and trust, and his willingness to be absolutely and completely honest was right there. It was precious.
Charlie took a few deep breaths to rid himself of the queasiness that lingered and insisted on causing his stomach to churn, then slipped the pebble into the pocket of his blue jeans, and stepped out into the open.
“Hey, if you thought that was kinky, then it was kinky. To me, it's being a bit adventurous in a vanilla relationship, but that’s my own personal opinion, and I’m not going to invalidate yours. That would be rude of me.”
“I’m beyond happy. Speaking of happiness, you’re probably going to try and kill me for this, but do you and Harry have any plans to make things official?”
A blurry dishevelled mop of sparkling turquoise hair followed the high-pitched and decidedly overexcited screech that rang in Harry’s ears. He was vaguely aware of the fact that Draco pulled his hand away and had just about enough time to spread his arms wide before Teddy collided into him.
Pausing mid-step, Draco felt his jaw drop in response, and it took him several seconds before he was able to shake off the state of stupefaction. He felt a strange sort of shudder trickle down his spine, and drinking a bit more of his coffee, he slowly swallowed the hot milky liquid.
Harry took a moment to fill his lungs with as much oxygen as he possibly could, then smiled softly. He ran his fingers through Draco’s hair and resting his hand at the nape of Draco’s neck, he positioned his index finger along the outline of Draco’s spine, then dragged his fingernail down the entire length.
Even from where he was stood, Draco could tell that Potter was trying to hide the fact that his hand trembled. He decided to pretend that he hadn’t noticed.
His eyes twinkled with pure mischief and a low and warm chuckle that had a certain kind of sexiness to it filled Harry’s ears, causing them to burn with heat. An almost overwhelming wave of arousal flooded through him, and swallowing hard, he fervently tried to think of something to say. Malfoy beat him to it.
“I don’t beg,” he said, trying his hardest to keep his voice even and neutral instead of gravelly and with a needy undertone.
He licked his lips in silent anticipation, and when Draco approached him, he widened the gap between his thighs and motioned for Draco to stand between his legs.
Harry observed Draco’s reaction to his words carefully. His first response was a small gasp, his second was his eyes widening, and his third was a bout of mild trepidation appearing all over his face. Harry continued to caress Draco’s cheek softly and gave him a few seconds to consider his request.
“I thought about inviting you over a couple of times,” he said, his voice low and quiet, muffled by the fact that he was practically speaking into his tea.
Draco’s wellbeing was his main concern, and he wanted his little prince to know that he was safe, loved, and cared for ― always and without exception.
“Hm, well, petty thief, tough copper. Or in wizarding terms, dealer of illegal wizarding artefacts versus Director Potter.”
Pushing his musings about Harry and their relationship to the back of his mind, Draco reached behind him to undo his apron and taking it off, he walked out from behind the counter, leaving it on a small hook by the wall next to the door to the backroom. As he passed Claire, Draco patted her on the shoulder.
Harry’s habit of repeatedly circling his thumb over his pulse point always helped him to calm down and relax, especially when he was nervous or worried about something or other.
“No, you were smarter than me, I can only commend you for that. I thought about getting in touch with either Charlie or Caleb, but some weirdly depressive voice in my head kept telling me not to bother them with this. I shouldn’t have listened, could have saved us both a few days of trouble.”
Harry didn’t look at all convinced, but when he didn’t immediately question his answer, Draco relaxed and stepping into the room, he closed the door behind him and leant back against it. He indulged in giving Harry a slow once-over, silently appreciating every single curve of Harry’s toned and muscular body. He loved the way those muscles flexed. Harry had incredibly powerful leg muscles, and his upper arms were a force to be reckoned with.
It was one of the many reasons why they worked. Besides their solid foundation, they simply enjoyed spending time together, and no matter how busy life got, Harry found ways and means to arrange playtime, time for romance, family time, and time for each of them to do whatever they needed to do to recharge their own batteries.
After much back and forth, and several rather heated arguments, they’d finally agreed to recreate a scene from an old case, one they’d closed quite a few years ago. It hadn’t been a high-profile case, and as such, the international press hadn’t written much, or anything, about it, but it had been a case that had baffled them both for weeks. They’d chased down lead after lead only for them all to lead to nothing. About three months into the investigation, when the trails had started to run ice-cold, they’d suddenly received an anonymous tip; the answer to all their prayers.
For a moment, Draco was tempted to ask Scorpius whether he wasn’t a bit too old for that sort of nonsense, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to utter those words.
Narcissa smiled, but Harry could tell that she only did it to cover up some of her ever-present worry about her son. He didn’t begrudge her that feeling. She loved him with all her heart, and the fact that he was all grown up and engaged to be married wasn’t going to deter her from showing her concern.
“It’s not getting up on stage in front of a bunch of people that I mind. I mean, I’m not a fan of sharing my private affairs with others, but I can see the allure and the educational value of it. It’s also fun.”
It reminded Harry a little bit of Butterbeer, although when it came to flavour and texture, the two drinks had absolutely nothing in common.
Once Rose and Hugo have rinsed all the soap off their hands, Harry reminds them to use a towel to dry their hands, then idly wonders whether anyone is hungry and would like to join him in the kitchen for a scrumptious breakfast for champions.
There was, of course, his engagement ring, but it wasn’t the same. The ring was a symbol of their love and their relationship in its entirety. It represented the fact that they’d both committed to spending the rest of their natural lives together. For this very reason, Draco had a hard time to think of the ring as a representation of what the D/s part of their relationship meant to him. While the two elements of their relationship were indeed tightly interwoven, there were some dissimilarities that really only stood out whenever they played. It didn’t matter whether it was just a scene or an entire weekend of dominance and submission, the rules were completely different then.
“One day,” Draco affirmed, then closed his eyes and buried his face deep in the crook of Harry’s neck.
Hastily focusing his attention elsewhere, Harry glanced at the three rows of sturdy wooden benches, facing the judges’ bench, in front of the dock. Warrenforth’s defence barrister sat in the first row, in the row behind her sat her clerks, and Warrenforth’s solicitor had temporarily taken up residence in the last row and was currently busy scribbling notes into a file.
In the space of several seconds, he’d somehow managed to replace the derision in his voice with slight boredom. It wasn’t the kind of bored drawl that expressed annoyance, but the sort of lack of enthusiasm that was, strangely enough, more endearing than irksome.
The reason for Draco’s inner turmoil was rather simple. He’d had asked for something and then realised that he’d bitten off far more than he could chew.
“All that romance around the engagement messed with your head, didn’t it? Anyway, I might as well tell you about Calida, or Kelly, which is what I used to call her while we were married. She wasn’t my first girlfriend, but she certainly turned my head in a way nobody else had before―”
“And I you, Harry Potter. I’m yours always. Don’t you ever forget that. I pledge my body to you; it’s yours to do with as you please. Remember, I trust you, and I’ve put my life in your hands more than once. I’ll do it again in a heartbeat. I’m not afraid of what we do, I love it, and I love you. You’ve done me no harm, not ever.”
It had taken Draco every ounce of self-restraint not to give in and fight with Harry, and after exercising complete self-control and deciding not to indulge Harry, he’d made up some haphazard excuse about needing to check a lawbook or three. He’d then, rather pathetically so, hidden away in his study until after Harry had gone to bed.
“Although, I’d start you on a cattleman’s crack first. Something straightforward to get you going. There’s a show at the club in a couple of months, and I can usually persuade Harry to show some of his skills off, but this year I’d like to talk you into it. If you want to be talked into it that is.”
He’d meticulously planned the whole scene, and even though he knew that he could have kept things simpler, he had no regrets about the extravagant setup and the lengths, he’d gone to, to ensure that everything was perfect. He’d thoroughly enjoyed ‘abducting’ Draco from the Ministry’s Atrium and bringing him back to Grimmauld Place and although being able to do that had turned him on massively, what had really aroused him this time around had been Draco’s sass and the way he’d attempted to bribe him without batting an eyelid.
Afterwards, Draco had felt somewhat anxious. He’d been worried that he’d bored him half to death with his wild and lengthy passionate speech about the changes he hoped to be involved in making. It had taken quite a bit of reassurance from Harry to convince Draco that his concerns were entirely unfounded and that he was interested and cared about Draco’s work, but Harry was sure that it had brought them closer together.
Time after time the Ministry had shown him the door, and time after time he’d returned, bringing more evidence, demonstrating that his updated recipes worked. He’d even gone as far as outright monopolising the press to get the Ministry to listen.
For some inexplicable reason, Harry had managed to finish all of his essential paperwork for the week well before five o’clock, which was something that happened once every blue moon. He’d, therefore, decided to take Caleb up on his offer to meet for a couple of post-work drinks to celebrate the start of the weekend.
Harry smiled at his adopted mother, then frowned slightly when he noted something about the look in her eyes. It wasn’t pronounced, but Harry had known Molly Weasley for about two decades, and he fancied himself rather apt at being able to foretell her moods. Knowing when or when not to approach Molly Weasley helped a lot when one wasn’t especially keen on getting an earful about something or other one had done.
“That’s good. So far, it feels incredible. Now, be a good boy and show me your skills. I’m not just going to blindly let you have a go at it. I want to know it’s going to be good.”
His stainless-steel eternity collar rested snuggly against his neck and for a moment, Draco, entirely unable to tear his eyes away, simply stared at the brightly sparkling sapphire embedded into it.
I hope things will start to settle down soon. In the meantime, please stay safe and sensible, everyone. These are strange and dark times and knowing that my wonderful and amazing readers are well would be such a great gift to me.
Since he’d given Draco the potion, Harry wasn’t in any rush to make Draco eat something, but if push came to shove, he could always summon the packet of biscuits or the bar of chocolate he kept in his nightstand for such occasions.
Harry instantly abandoned the idea of dragging the duvet back, climbing into bed and pulling the thick, heavy covers up to his nose.
For Harry, he wanted to be a part of the family that had adopted the love of his life and included him in their lives, showering him with unconditional love and affection.
It was slow and tender, but it had a strange sort of domineering and subtly coercive style to it; it was yet another leaf Draco had taken out of the playtime rulebook.
It hurled through the air, and Draco, looking thoroughly bored while doing so, lifted his arm and moving his index finger, he redirected the ball with a precisely-cast wandless and nonverbal spell, exercising only the tiniest amount of energy. Without breaking eye contact, Harry let his arm shot up and caught the rubber band ball mid-flight, closing his fist around it tightly to halt its momentum.
“The press finding out. They’ll bring up my past, and they’ll try their best to give you a hard time, just like they did when it first become public knowledge that we’re a couple. There’s a difference in us being together and us being engaged to be married.”
Harry paused, then a series of blows rained down on Draco’s arse, and he lost himself in the sensations, cherished each one.
“Honestly, Potter, you have my utmost respect, I don’t know how you cope with that level of sass,” he said.
“I didn’t know what you might feel like, so I asked the head kitchen elf to prepare a bit of everything.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed considerably, and he glared at him through tiny slits. His emerald-green eyes flashed angrily, and he demanded, for the second time in as many minutes, that Draco let go of him.
Within seconds, the Harry Potter Draco knew, was gone. In his place was the biggest, most menacing-looking jet-black wolf Draco had ever seen. He’d asked Potter, and not just once, to reveal his wolf form to him, but so far, Potter had always refused. Today, it had been unavoidable.
“Always. You’re mine. And I promise I’ll whirl you around a dancefloor when we’re eighty, and our bones ache and crack with every spin we take.”
Despite their history, despite the way, the public sometimes still perceived him and his name, and despite his father’s heinous crimes, Potter had offered him something Draco hadn’t been able to refuse.
“Home to Harry,” he mumbled to himself and pressed the tip of his thumb against his engagement ring, and gently rubbed the smooth and shiny metal. It was warm to the touch, and Draco relished in the feeling of rightness that flowed through him.
The words hit Draco with such force that he felt just a little dizzy. He widened his stance by an inch or two, and unlocking his knees, he bent them slowly and gracefully sank to the floor. He did so without utilising his arms to keep his balance, and once he was firmly settled on the ground, he sat back on his haunches, then straightened his back to lengthen it. He also set his shoulders and adjusted the position of his arms slightly, making sure they stayed precisely as he wanted them. Instead of lowering his gaze, and even though he was tempted to do so, he kept his eyes firmly fixed on Harry, looking up at his face and watching his every move.
Harry’s praise caused Draco to float somewhere between reality and fantasy, and it took several minutes before he managed to regain any sense of control over himself, but he didn’t manage to keep it for very long. Harry let his hands run down his arms, grabbed his wrists and pulled them behind his back. Draco automatically let himself fall forward a bit, and Harry dragged his wrists up, restraining them at an angle that Draco could feel the burn. It was uncomfortable and it hurt but it was perfect and Draco wanted the feeling to never stop.
He made sure to keep his voice low and soft since he didn’t really mind Draco’s reaction to the cold but enjoyed being able to exert his power and tease Draco a bit here and there.
He brushed his thumb over Draco’s cheek, running it along the outline of his sharp cheekbone and drew him close for a kiss.
Harry took a moment to consider his options. He had no idea what message Draco had left for his mother to explain their sudden arrival. Narcissa wasn’t the type of woman who minded when they turned up unexpectedly. While it was true that they usually arranged to stop by for afternoon tea, she loved it just as much when they descended upon the place without as much as a warning. She’d made it perfectly clear that they were more than welcome to come over and stay whenever they wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of London.
He’d told Draco that he could expect sensation play and temperature play during today’s scene, but apart from promising to cover Draco in wax, he hadn’t divulged any specifics and Draco had been okay with that ― another silent testament of his level of trust in Harry.
The familiar feel of apparition tugged on his navel, and as Harry apparated them away, Draco smiled.
Potter took a moment to digest the words, then slowly turned around and with his eyes narrowed, he glowered at Draco and once again crossed his arms over his chest.
It was just the sort of encouragement; Harry was looking for, and he proceeded to use his hands to torment Draco in the best possible way. He simply used them to caress every inch of him, although from this moment on Harry avoided touching Draco’s nipples and he never once went anywhere near his cock or his balls. The closest Harry came to touching it was when he repeatedly dragged his nails over the inside of Draco’s thighs. He left distinctive red marks behind, and when he told Draco how beautiful he looked like this, Draco moaned, shuddered and arched his back, silently begging for
Before the start of the class, Harry collected a bunch of them and transfigured them to look like ordinary wizarding money. On top of that, he cast a jinx on each of the fake coins. It’s a very mild stinging hex. Harry is absolutely confident that the curse won’t do much more than teach those students, who decide to ignore his warnings and immediately reach inside the box, a little lesson.
Draco’s knees buckled slightly, and he briefly pressed his lips together, then, took a deep breath and looked up at Harry.
They had both invested a great deal of trust into their relationship, and while it was a continuous work in progress, Harry felt that he’d found the person he wanted to grow old with. With the ring, he’d placed on Draco’s finger, he’d promised his little prince as much.
“I’ll be busy working, darling, it’ll be no fun for you. But I promise you, I’ll take you for a weekend. We can have some proper fun together. In the meantime, I really need you to be good for Nan, she’s been missing you, you know. It’s been a while since we visited.”
He shook his head, and with a soft chuckle, he pulled his robes a little tighter around and began his short walk back into his village.
Draco’s silvery-grey eyes sparkled with mischief, and it made it rather difficult to stop the fit of giggles that had overcome him, but after a moment or two, he managed to calm down enough to offer up his opinion.
“You’re such a good boy, such a good and obedient little pet. Do it then, my little prince, come for me. Show my cock how it feels when you do as I tell you and come for me.”
“Potter, you look utterly ridiculous trying to pull off this poppycock act of moral excellence. What time is it anyway?”
Draco knew that his son hadn’t understood anything of what he’d just said. While Scorpius knew who Harry Potter was, had even met Potter on several occasions, he wasn’t privy to the ins and outs of Potter’s fondness of ignoring what was sensible and diving headfirst into trouble instead. In Draco’s humble opinion, Scorpius adored Potter a little too much. But―and Draco thanked his lucky stars for that―he’d yet to discover the finer points of Potter’s past, especially the parts of it that concerned Potter’s blatant disregard for authority and his love of doing precisely the opposite of what he’d been told.
His flush had faded a little, but he was nervously clasping and twisting his hands together, then pulling them apart again. Despite his outward tension, Draco’s gaze was steady, and his silvery-grey eyes were bright.
“Harry’s up in Glasgow for the day, he left before dawn this morning. Leave Teddy with me, I’ll look after him,” he said without having to think twice about his words.
Potter turned his head sideways, but instead of shifting so that he could properly turn around, he averted his eyes and stared down at the empty coffee mug in front of him.
Harry connected the tie to the bamboo, and giving it a quick check to make sure it was secure, he added tension and locked it into place. He briefly checked on the other two ties, adjusted one of them ever so slightly, then ran his fingers through Draco’s hair.
Ron would soon receive a surprise parcel per Owl delivery and Draco, well Draco needed to give him consent first, but Harry had no doubt that his little prince wouldn’t hesitate to do so.
This time, it was Draco’s turn to laugh. He leant in and placed another kiss on his mother’s cheek, then shooed her away. She gave him a pointed look, but turned and crossed the room. At the door of the library, with her hand already on the handle, she turned and looked at him.
“I know,” he mumbled. “I thought we could do it as a family project of sorts. The three of us, you know. What do you think?”
Draco smiled. It was a somewhat shy smile, not because he actually felt shy, but because he felt a bit overwhelmed.
He even threw his head back, and Harry had to press his lips tightly together, not to let it affect him. He stiffened his shoulders, squeezed that blasted rubber band ball, and resisted the niggling thought to throw a stinging hex in Draco’s general direction.
He also told Draco to look at him, and when Draco’s forced his eyes to open fully, an incredible and intense jolt zapped through Harry, pulling a long groan from the depths of his belly. He gripped Draco’s leg hard enough to bruise, and thrust into him, claiming all of that tight and narrow passage for himself.
Compared to the things they did now and the level of submission Draco was comfortable with, it felt like those silken ties had been nothing more but vanilla with a bit of zest. Still, Harry cherished the memory and didn’t regret taking things slow. Draco had needed those baby steps. It had helped him to acclimatise and discover whether being submissive was for him or whether he just enjoyed being a bit adventurous in bed.
Taking his Auror robes off, Harry stood up, walked over to Draco’s desk and poured him a glass of water. He cast a mild warming charm on it to raise its temperature, then returned to Draco’s side and helping him to sit up a little, he offered him the warm water.
Harry continued to let his fingertips travel over Draco’s skin, teasing it, arousing him, slowly but surely turning him into a needy wreck. There was nothing sexual about his touch, it was just an intimate caress, but it was enough to drive Draco wild, to make him beg for more. Harry held out on him for the longest time but eventually twisted his nipples, pulling on them, causing exquisite pain.
While he chewed on a large chunk of his biscuit and washed the soft cake down with a couple of sips of hot chocolate, Molly continued their conversation.
Draco chuckled softly and buried his face in Harry’s chest. He could feel and hear Harry’s heartbeat and inhaling deeply, he breathed in Harry’s familiar scent.
Caleb approached them from the bar, grinning broadly. Stefan trailed behind him but smiled just as enthusiastically.
For a moment, Draco’s eyes glazed over, and he swallowed hard, then licked his lips and bit his bottom lip. A delightful flush rose into his cheeks, and Harry’s groin pulsed with desire.
A few seconds passed, and Draco felt Harry’s nimble fingers work to undo his trousers. They popped the top button and dragged the zipper down, then tugged the snug-fitting slacks down his legs. Draco waited for the material to pool at his ankles, then elegantly, and without losing his balance, stepped out of them, allowing Harry to remove his socks while he was at it. He felt the tips of Harry’s fingers run up the entire length of his legs and shivered, anticipating Harry to grasp his hips firmly.
By the time, Ira had considered himself worthy of once again offering his services to Tom, Harry had gone and vanquished him. Naturally, that had filled Zaytsev with such intense rage that his delusions had once again driven him to convince himself that it was his duty to kill Harry to avenge Voldemort’s death. Surprisingly though, and despite his nonsensical way of thinking, Ira Zaytsev was a patient man.
His fingers travelled across Draco’s chest and sought out the new tattoo. Although he couldn’t see it, Harry was convinced that he could feel the wolf chase after his fingertips. It almost felt like the wolf was trying to nip at his fingers. Amused, he chuckled softly.
“I know. You can have tough if that’s what you really want. I can certainly tighten the reins a bit over the next two weeks, but I don’t think to go all the way and giving up all control would make you happy, my love. I don’t even need to let you try to know you’ll be miserable less than half a day into the game.”
Draco couldn’t help but look at Harry, who smiled at him. Feeling his heart flutter with excitement, Draco glanced around. He hadn’t set foot into Ysabeau’s rose garden in years and couldn’t deny that the blooming display of over five-hundred varieties of blooming roses was, truly, an extraordinary sight. They were surrounded by sumptuous pale pink bourbon roses, inspired by the Empress Josephine’s famous garden, and delicate Chinese tea roses in shades of cream, pink and red. Light-crimson and deeply-scented shrubs of Rosa gallica officinalis from Persia, and other prehistoric hybrids made a deliberate and pretentious display of their stunning beauty.
Instead, he drew his wand and with a flourishing swish, he cast an industrial-strength silencing charm to seal the office.
His wolfish side had taught him to always pay attention to everything that was in his peripheral vision, and over the years, it had become an instinct, second nature even.
Where wax play was concerned and given Draco’s unfavourable history with Fiendfyre and his subsequent struggle with pyrophobia, Harry didn’t like taking chances.
“A little bit of crudeness keeps the spark alive, my little prince. Now, and on an entirely different note, want to know what Molly said to me earlier?”
What he’d genuinely appreciated the most though was that she hadn’t fussed about his past, or held any of his bad decisions against him. Her complete acceptance of Harry’s and his relationship and the love they felt for each other had helped Draco to warm up to the idea of regular dinners at the Burrow.
Since he didn’t want to damage Draco’s circulation, Harry refrained from actually pulling the rope tight, but left it reasonably loose. It wasn’t loose enough for Draco to wriggle his way out of it or for the tie to fall apart, but there was room to ensure continuous blood flow.
Eventually, Draco settled on both ends of the spectrum. He wanted it all; the elation, and the terror, because despite this being a roleplay and Harry holding all the cards, he trusted Harry not to take it too far.
Draco snuggled into his embrace and Harry drew a series of intricate knotting patterns onto his back, coaxing him into the land of dreams. A mumbled
Harry pushed his finger further into Draco’s hole, twisted it, then angled it just right and pressed against Draco’s prostate. He rubbed the tip of his finger over the walnut-sized pleasure point, teased and tormented Draco, mercilessly edging him, then stopped again.
Draco had kindly offered to prepare them both some sandwiches and Harry had gratefully accepted the offer. He didn’t think he had the energy to walk downstairs, let alone muster the concentration it took to apparate within the walls of Grimmauld Place.
“I still vividly remember the day Sir finally sat me down and told me the whole truth. He’d been testing the waters, allowing me to dip my toes into submission, yet making sure that I was, at all times, in complete control of the situation. He introduced me to the concept of a safeword long before he confessed his love of kink to me. He always put my safety first and never did anything without my consent, and so when he finally told me, or rather showed me, I was nothing but intrigued. He spent months piquing my curiosity and so when it came down to it, all I could think about was that I’m safe with him and happily gave him precisely what he wanted.
“That depends entirely on whether you’ve ratted me out to our common enemy or not,” he said, trying his best to appear thoroughly nonchalant.
Harry’s other thumb continued to circle over his pulse point, and Draco slowly breathed in and out. His earlier nervousness was gone, and he felt calmer, but knowing that he was about to receive several rather firm lashes the leather belt, Harry had been wearing earlier, didn’t remove the feeling of trepidation that had taken up residence in the pit of his stomach.
“Caleb would have put me in a corner or left me restrained to the bed in a timeout or something. You know I enjoy impact play a lot, so I never get pain as punishment, although I can tell you, Caleb knows exactly how to hit me, so it’s not in the least bit enjoyable. Even my masochistic little heart can’t take that.”
“It’s Harry’s mantra. He always says that and it makes me feel so safe. I know he’d never cross any boundaries. He does love to test my limits, but deep down, I know he’d never push me too far. I don’t just know it; I can feel it whenever I’m with him.”
Draco, in the middle of reaching for his sandwich, paused and their eyes locked. Unable to look away, Harry swallowed hard and before he could stop himself, to words slipped past his lips.”
For a punishment / the discipline to be effective, the submissive / slave must always know why they are being disciplined. The "crime" must be discussed before and after. While letting some time pass (like in the chapter, Harry and Draco had to get home first before Harry could punish Draco) is perfectly acceptable, allowing too much time to pass is not. Punishing a submissive / slave for a "crime" they committed several days ago is not acceptable, not ever.
Harry didn’t break the kiss for the longest time, but by the time he did, Draco was a breathless, panting mess. His cheeks were flushed, and his eyes were dark with desire. His lips were swollen and wet, and although all they’d done had been to share a passionate snog, Harry couldn’t help but think that Draco looked positively debauched.
I decided to give you a little bit more of a peek into Draco's head, and I hope you'll enjoy the chance to get to know him even more.
Sunday finds Harry in Romania, enjoying a spot of easy camaraderie with Charlie Weasley as they walk alongside each other. Harry has zero regrets about the extra galleons, he spent to cover the same-day-Portkey return fee, because spending a bit of quality time with Charlie, far away from the madness of the hustle and bustle of London, is absolutely worth it. They hike through one of Romania’s famed virgin forests at the foot of the Transylvanian Alps, an impressive range of mountains the southern part of the country.
“A phrase you often hear when a person that’s very new to the lifestyle becomes very excited and proceeds with minimal caution, self-concern, compromised emotions and impaired judgement in an attempt to make up for lost time. I felt just like that, a child in a sweetshop. The more I read, the more intrigued, and at times terrified, I got. Now that I knew what the lifestyle meant to Sir, I so very desperately wanted to make him proud and show him that I could be exactly what he wanted me to be. It took several very long conversations for me to realise that I was what he wanted, kink or no kink and that pushing myself past my limits wasn’t going to melt his kinky heart. Instead, he made sure that I read, asked questions, went to Munches, and gradually learnt about my wants, desires, needs, and limits.
Draco reached for his coffee and taking a few sips, he took one of Teddy’s colour pencils, a black one, and doodled a broomstick and a flying Snitch in one of the corners of the parchment. The broomstick flew around the castle, and the Golden Snitch whizzed around Peeves’ head. The poltergeist tried catching the flying ball but ended up stumbling over his own feet instead.
Harry’s embrace and his gentle words only made Draco cry harder, and despite his hot arse, he scrambled to crawl into Harry’s arms and buried his face in Harry’s lap.
, Harry thinks―sitting in the centre of his crumpled duvet, which is nothing more but a heap on the smooth wooden flooring that runs throughout Harry’s spacious Diagon Alley flat above Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. Harry is convinced that Walter is smirking, it’s a dirty smirk, entirely mischievous, and for just a split-second, Harry feels the urge to throw a stinging hex in Walter’s general direction. But instead of actually doing so, he merely glares at his crup. Throwing his legs over the edge of the bed, he puts his slippers on and gets up.
For a split-second, Draco felt tempted to ask the boy who’d instructed him to come and find him at The Fountain of Magical Brethren, but after hesitating for a moment or two, he dismissed any of his unfounded suspicions that anything untoward was going on.
“Yes, naturally, we do, dear, but the heir of the Malfoy line deserves to have his mother fawning over him, don’t you think, darling?”
Gathering up his courage, Draco swallowed his apprehension and slowly lifting his head, he looked at Harry and smiled. He was aiming for a polite smile, but given his current level of excitement and the lingering sense of anxiety, that filled him, he had no idea whether his smile had the desired effect or whether it was making him look like a complete lunatic.
Knowing that Draco didn’t have the energy to stand on his own two feet so soon after a suspension performance, Harry lowered the bamboo rod. As he worked to released Draco, he also supported him, taking some of his weight. Crouching down on the ground, Harry wrapped both arms around his little prince and hugged him tightly, flooding him with the feeling of safety and the knowledge that he was loved. Harry worked to remove almost every bit of rope, pushing it all away from him. In the end, only the rope that kept Draco’s hands securely tied behind his back remained, and for this next part of the show, Harry made sure that Draco was mainly hidden from view.
Draco’s words pierced the arousal-filled bubble in the pit of his groin, and Harry groaned. It was right around then that he decided to turn his brain off and simply feel. There was no need for anything else. Draco had it all under control, and Harry trusted him explicitly. It was time to enjoy the best kind of birthday present, the kind only Draco could give him: an incredible rush, a high powerful enough to knock him out.
“I’ve a critical job for you today, Rose Weasley,” he says, trying his best to sound all authoritative and important.
Since it’s the weekend and not even eight o’clock yet, the cobbled wizarding street is pretty much deserted. Shops open late on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays. The usual opening hours are somewhere between nine and ten, which really just means ten o’clock but this is Britain and putting a definite time stamp on things has never worked, and Harry knows from experience, it isn’t ever going to work. He doesn’t mean that in a bad way, this is just the way that things work in this country. Approximate times are enough, most of the time, and if they aren’t, well, then they aren’t.
He didn’t break away until they both struggled to breathe properly, and even then, it was a grudging and forced separation.
He didn’t want to push Harry into anything he wasn’t ready for, and he most definitely wasn’t planning on taking advantage of the rose garden’s magic, but he simply couldn’t resist that voice; he just didn’t know how to do so. Or maybe he did but simply couldn’t summon the necessary resolve to stop it from unravelling him. He felt his face flush and his heart race. His mind quieted down and all he could focus on was the sound of Harry’s breathing.
didn’t generally read tabloids or cheap celebrity magazines, and Draco took great pride in the fact that most of his customers enjoyed stimulating conversations and inspiring debates.
Draco lifted his head off his chest and looked at him. He didn’t appear to be offended or in the mood to mock him for his little brotherly dig, and Charlie took that as both, a good sign and a confirmation of the solidity of their friendship.
As he thought back to that moment, Draco realised that he could still feel the spell’s magic. Two weeks had passed since he’d signed the damn agreement, but now that he thought about it, the pads of his fingers tingled with the memory of it all. Draco couldn’t help but wonder whether he’d finally lost his marbles completely. What was it about Potter that made it so impossible to resist him?
Charlie just raised his arms in mock surrender, and Harry felt sorely tempted to toss a wandless stinging hex at his arse.
Besides, at this point in time, he wasn’t especially worried. Draco seemed neither depressed nor overly preoccupied. Yes, he was a little distracted, and he was acting a little strange, much like he was trying his hardest to keep a secret.
He still didn’t look like he was entirely at ease, but Harry chose not to question his behaviour in front of their friends. Instead, he pretended like he hadn’t noticed that Draco deliberately dithered in the doorway for a few seconds before stepping across the threshold.
Draco’s softly spoken response was music to Harry’s ears, and he ran his fingers along the tight hemp rope that presently ran across Draco’s chest. The vibrations of Harry’s light and deliberately teasing touch caused Draco to shudder. He whimpered softly and smiling, Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s neck to tempt him a little further.
While flying back to the reserve, Harry hadn’t been able to resist the temptation to pull a few gravity-defying, heart-stopping Seeker stunts. Apparently, the fact that he was now the Director of the Auror Department had done nothing to impair his flying skills. He was just as apt as he’d always been.
Sure-footed, and trusting his instincts completely, Harry pounded the uneven ground beneath his feet. Small twigs snapped under him, and he could feel the smoothness of scattered stones through the soles of his running shoes. Unperturbed by the forest’s dark and mysterious edges, Harry, driven by the primal urge to become one with the forest, sprinted directly towards it. The closer he got, the harder it became to ignore the beast inside of him and submitting further to its power, Harry let it take over entirely. Just as he disappeared into the forest, narrowly avoiding a thick tree trunk barricading his path, he felt his body lengthen and expand in all directions.
“Yes,” he said, “it’s nice to have someone who will fuss. I like to imagine my mother would have fussed. Perhaps not quite in the same way but in some way.”
“Have a wonderful day, my love,” Draco called after him, giving his voice a nauseatingly sweet edge.
His voice travelled through the microphone and Muggle technology amplified it with the same intensity of a Sonorus charm, effortlessly carrying his words through the room. The thick hushed silence told him that everyone was waiting for him to start sharing his story.
His vision was somewhat blurred, but it wasn’t muddy enough for him not to notice the large curse stain that zig-zagged square across the centre of his office ceiling. It had been there ever since he’d, following his promotion to Head of the Auror Department, moved into this particular office. He seldom noticed the remnants of whatever duel had, at some point, clearly taken place inside these four walls, but occasionally, and especially whenever he took a moment to look up, Harry couldn’t help but wonder how the curse mark had come to be there and why nobody had ever bothered to do something about removing it.
Harry teasingly moved the ice cube back to Draco’s hole and pressed it against the ring of muscles around his hole.
For a moment, he struggled to distract himself from the allure of reminiscing how his life had changed, but he managed to get a grip on it. Another sip of coffee certainly helped.
She knelt on the floor, and putting her son down; she showed him the beautiful, hand-sewn dragon costume, Dobby had helped her to acquire.
-bandwagon, but this is ridiculous. Draco isn’t that long a name. It absolutely does not warrant being shortened to the fourth letter of the Roman Alphabet. You don’t hear me calling you “S” now, do you?”
He encouraged Draco one more time, and that was all the incentive, Draco needed. He came on a guttural groan and he spilt rope after rope of his come between them. Harry felt most of it splash against his abdomen, and smiling, he sank his cock all the way into Draco, buried his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, and allowed his orgasm to rob the last bit of his sanity.
“Yes and no. It depends. She can be a lot of fun too. If you want, I’ll take you to meet her one of these days, and you can find out for yourself.”
A moment later, however, the teasing touch was gone, and Harry stepped away. Draco pressed his lips together to stop himself from letting out a low sigh. Instead, he watched as Harry finally shrugged out of his own jacket. He folded it neatly and placed it over the armrest of the broad leather sofa across from Draco. It, too, was covered with a large, black satin sheet.
Harry’s voice was husky, low, and warm, and opening his eyes again, Draco blinked a few times. The corners of his eyes prickled with tears, and he sighed.
They’d more than jumped over their own shadows. They’d made the impossible happen and shown the whole of Britain that it was entirely possible for two people who’d fought on opposites sides of a war to work through their differences and become not only the best of friends but two people who trusted each other with their lives.
They danced cheek to cheek and a minute or so into the dance, Draco slowly closed his eyes and felt his grasp on reality slip slightly into the background. He trusted Harry enough to follow his lead without worrying about tripping up. As the music, amplified with the help of a Sonorus charm, continued to wash over him, Draco grew entirely oblivious to the fact that at least two-hundred Ministry employees, including his Head of Department, and the Minister for Magic himself, as well as another two-hundred important and highly influential attachés of the Ministry currently surrounded them.
Draco had mostly definitely thoroughly sparked his curiosity to the degree that he was somewhat unwilling to control himself.
It had taken him until now, a whole day later, to find a bit of time to sample the beans. Bringing the cup up and closer to his lips, Draco took another deep breath through his nose, allowing the coffee’s exquisite palette of flavours to assault all of his senses.
A solid five minutes passed before Draco’s sobs finally subsided, and he opened his bloodshot puffy red eyes. Charlie smiled down at him and used his thumb to wipe some of the tears away.
He reached for the rope, slowly moved behind Draco, and squeezed Draco’s forearm. His fingertips pressed into the Dark Mark, and he gave the arm a tiny tug, a gentle invitation for Draco to surrender to him.
Potter had tugged his shirt further up and his jeans and briefs further down and there on his hip it was―already healed but somewhat ugly nonetheless―the sharp reminder of a severely deep bite.
Instead, he kept his arms crossed and defiantly locked eyes with Caleb, engaging in a staring contest, he knew he was bound to win.
They kissed for the longest time, and until they were both thoroughly breathless. His burning lungs were the only reason why Harry eventually broke away and awed by the intensity and ferocity of their heated battle of tongues, Harry took several moments to regulate his breathing and even longer to find the will to speak.
The navy grasscloth accent wall was most definitely giving him the blues. It wasn’t the sad kind, but the making-a-statement colourful type. While it set the tone for the space of the room, added texture, and had caught his eye as soon as Harry had pushed the bedroom door open for him, it also filled Draco with the strong desire to draw his wand and cast an
“Yes, she did. Very much so. Unfortunately, I did not. I mean, in the heat of moment I got swept away, but afterwards it was a completely different story. It was an intense scene, completely different from anything we’d ever done before. With all our other scenes, we always started slow and gradually build up intensity, but with this particular scene it was just ‘
Ron spells the words, slowly and with long breaks in-between each letter because even he isn’t stupid enough to talk about a gruesome murder in front of his own children. Besides, Hermione would have his head if she ever found out, though Harry doesn’t think that it makes much of a difference because Rose, much like her mother, is wise beyond her years and Harry is quite sure that she’s listening at least a little bit. As for Hugo, well, Harry isn’t worried about him at all, because when Hugo is reading from his books and animatedly sharing his stories, he forgets about the rest of the world.
Pleased with his tie, Harry smiled devilishly and placed his hands over Draco’s bound ones, ensuring that, despite the public setting, his impromptu Shibari rope play remained private. It was their little secret.
“I wouldn’t be so sure of that, my little prince. I think you have it in you, it’s just that you don’t really want to be devious.”
That propelled Harry right over the edge and from here on there was absolutely no turning back. His orgasm, the one pleasure he’d resisted chasing after all this time, overpowered him and flooded through his groin. It exploded right in the centre, and despite the extreme tightness around his cock, he felt it pulse and vibrate as rope after rope of his come shot through it and filled Draco. He somehow managed a few more shaky thrusts to draw out his own orgasm and remembered to wrap his hand around Draco’s cock to help him along. He didn’t need to do much though; Draco was so close that it only took a few strokes before Draco followed him over the edge and exploded all over his hand.
After lunch, and a brief catchup with several of the other staff members, Harry makes his way to the inner courtyard to find Teddy, who has a free period and is eager to spend a bit of time with him. They sit in the sun, backs propped up against the cool stones of a low wall, and chat about Teddy’s studies.
Once he’d swallowed the last bit, he casually leant back against the kitchen island behind him and crossed his right ankle over his left one.
Taking the lube, Draco flicked the lid off, and trying his best to neither focus on his red thrumming arse, or his throbbing cock, he poured a generous amount of the thick clear liquid into the palm of his hand. It felt and looked like ordinary lube, except that it was comfortably warm instead of cold, and Draco frowned lightly. He had no idea whether Harry was fucking with his mind again, but he decided to remain cautious, and slowly moving his hands, he used one to spread his arse cheeks open, and the other to smear a decent amount of lube all around his tight hole. It fluttered at the pleasant warmth and feeling himself relax, Draco circled a single finger around the furrowed skin, loosening the muscles up even further.
Scorpius poked him in the chest, then placed his hands on either side of his face and pressed his lips together. Draco was less than impressed but didn’t stop Scorpius either. Scorpius usually got away with almost anything. Draco suspected that the fact that his son was his pride and joy had something to do with him generally letting Scorpius get away with all manner of mischief. While he was a very different person at work, with Scorpius he was laid back, easy-going and entirely unfazed about Scorpius’ daily attempts to find out exactly how far he could push him.
Draco shifted in an attempt to cover up a small but pronounced shiver, but Harry noticed it anyway. He’d spent too many years watching Draco not to notice absolutely everything about the man.
The look in his eyes was one of pure deviousness, and Draco couldn’t help but wonder whether his decision to remind Harry of that afternoon and the epic way he’d managed to embarrass himself, had been a good idea.
Teddy was due to start his magical education at Hogwarts next year, and Draco knew for a fact that Harry hated the idea of accompanying his godson to King’s Cross and putting him onto the Hogwarts Express. Teddy living with his grandmother and visiting every other weekend was one thing, Teddy spending most of the year up in Scotland roaming about the corridors of a medieval castle and learning how to wield a wand was a different thing altogether.
The string of curses that fell from the unsub’s wand was almost inevitable, only this time, Harry didn’t use a protective shield to hide behind.
Of course, he’s not petty enough to have stopped believing that there might be someone special out there for him, but he just really can’t be bothered to make an effort to look for the person that’s just right for him. Charlie absolutely knows that, but that still doesn’t stop him from trying to set Harry up. Because he means well, Harry usually humours him. He goes on a date with whoever Charlie introduces him to, then makes it very clear that he’s just looking for a friend and isn’t interested in a romantic relationship.
Apart from his duelling skills, Harry’s ability to weave magic into their play was indeed one of a kind, and Draco couldn’t help but feel in awe ― whatever book about magical BDSM, Harry had meticulously studied, Draco desperately wanted to get his hands on it. He sometimes thought of asking Harry about it, and while a large part of him was sure that Harry wouldn’t deny it, a small, but compelling part of his mind, prevented Draco from giving in to his curiosity. He wanted to remain in the dark about whatever magic Harry used. It positively thrilled him that, apart from his natural inclination to dominate, Harry possessed a kind of magic he was entirely defenceless against.
He smirked, and as he winked at Draco from across the room, he couldn’t help but wonder which it would be today. Would Draco make it easy for him or would he fight him tooth and nail?
They first settled on the incredibly gorgeous man currently fast asleep upstairs in their bed, then moved on to their earlier play.
The last time they’d spent a night here had been before Harry had asked Draco to move in with him, but since Draco loved Notting Hill, he hadn’t sold it, and Harry didn’t want him to. When Draco had asked him for a reason, the flat’s beautiful location hadn’t been the first thing that had come to Harry’s mind. Instead, he’d cited all the firsts, recounting them one by one. Their first kiss, their first home-cooked meal, the first time they’d danced together, the first time they’d slept together, the first time they’d talked about kink, the first time Draco had submitted to him, their first big argument.
It was a careful gesture. Harry knew, from experience, that Draco didn't actually agree with him. He was merely acknowledging him, letting him know that he had been heard and that he, to an extent at least, made sense.
“You know, I highly doubt that. While you might think that me bending you over my knee and smacking your behind a few times is going to make you feel better, I can guarantee you that you’ll feel worse tomorrow morning, and it won’t be because you’ll have to spend the day sitting on two thrumming and throbbing arse cheeks.”
Sighing softly, Draco briefly abandoned his apple and aimlessly toying with it, he decided that if he waited any longer for Stefan to make the first move, everything would be ready and they’d be on their way back upstairs.
“Most definitely being cheeky. Be careful, now, I may just decide that your final birthday surprise is a sound spanking.”
“That purple bruise on your arse looked rather sexy, although I still regret that it wasn’t me who put it there.”
Draco made a purposefully incomprehensible remark and stubbornly continued to ignore Harry and all of his amusing attempts to get him to break his silence and talk to him.
He looked a little uncomfortable, and for a moment, his hair turned a strange mixture of both, platinum-blond and jet-black.
Right this very moment, Draco’s entire world revolved around Harry; he was the only thing that mattered.
Draco was quite right. Aftercare wasn’t just something that helped a sub through the craziness of subspace. Dominants could benefit from it as well.
He deliberately lowered his voice to a seductive drawl, and Draco shuddered, then chanced his luck and moving swiftly, he flipped Harry onto his back, straddled him, and pinned his arms to the mattress.
“You’re always mine, my love, whether you’re a good boy or not. But we both know that you like being my good boy. Being good reaps rewards, doesn’t it? Being bad, well, not so much.”
Draco arched his back, thrust against his hand and writhing on top of the piano, he breathlessly begged for more. Harry silenced him with a deep kiss and continuing to tease him mercilessly, he extended one hand, and summoned a phial of lube, Draco had made himself. It was all-natural, silky smooth, thick, and lasted for hours. Exactly what they needed for all their sexual endeavours.
Harry broke off, and for a moment, he grew silent. He took Draco’s left hand into his own and toyed with the ring, twisting it around Draco’s fingers. The very first time he’d touched the ring, just after Hira had put the final touches to it, the metal had been cold, and the ring had felt lifeless. It had been just that, a ring, waiting for its rightful owner.
“Let’s just say a very sore arse will most definitely be involved. Perhaps a toy or two. And restraints.”
, Draco thought, and with an exasperated shake of his head, he returned to the front room and sat on the sofa.
“I don’t think your father wore the trousers in that marriage,” he said, “if you ask me, I think you inherited your proclivity for dominance from your mother.”
Harry was always open about his emotions. He shared his feelings, and he wasn’t ashamed of being overcome by them. Draco felt that he was still learning that particular lesson. To him, freely showing his own emotions wasn’t the most natural thing in the world but when it was just Harry and him, he, somehow, didn’t mind.
Harry watched him tug at his restraints and decided to take his sweet time, wanting to gradually build up the momentum and drive Draco wanton as he impatiently waited for him to land the first blow.
Over the last week, Draco’s desire to submit every inch of him to Harry had increased tenfold, and he couldn’t see that thrill decrease any time soon. It never really did anyway.
It was a warm smile, one that held an unspoken promise of love, and Draco allowed himself to hope that Harry might just―
Harry reciprocated and reducing the amount of pressure against Draco’s pulse point, he returned to drawing slow and steady circles. His touch worked its magic and the tension that had been threatening to take over, flowed away, allowing Draco to relax and focus.
Draco, who stood by the window sill, back ramrod straight yet seemingly entirely at ease and not in the least bit tense, turned his attention away from looking through the window glass at the enchanted landscape outside and staring straight at him, he arched an eyebrow. It said far more than words ever could and deep down, Harry appreciated that Draco’s ability to speak without ever saying a word. Out in the field, it served them well, but even in the privacy of his office, it was one of the qualities of his and Draco’s long-standing partnership which he genuinely appreciated.
The sound of Potter’s rich and sonorous voice reverberated through the narrow Ministry corridor, and instinctively straightening up a little, Draco tightened his grip on the smooth leather handle of his black satchel, picked a non-existent bit of fluff off the arm sleeve of his dress robes, and slowly turned around. He feigned a smile and inclined his head about half an inch to silently greet Potter, who was dressed in his fitted Auror uniform, with his jacket undone and his scarlet robes casually folded over his arm. Draco’s appreciative once-over was all but a well-practised sweeping glance and, in his head, he cursed the day he’d noticed Potter’s good looks for the very first time. He firmly ignored his lingering desire to strip Potter naked and resolutely pushed any further inappropriate thoughts into a dark corner of his mind, one he generally kept under lock and key.
For a moment, he recalled that fateful night in the forest, when, after reassuring her that Draco was alive and safe, Narcissa Malfoy had lied to Voldemort and therefore put her life on the line to save his. During that brief exchange, she had, in his eyes, redeemed herself wholly and thoroughly, and that was precisely what he’d told Kingsley and the Wizengamot during a private hearing.
Tilting his head back, he looked up at Harry, who smiled, then leant down and captured his lips in a slow and lazy kiss.
“I am. I’m not entirely sure yet what exactly happened, but I’m on my way to Harry’s place. I’m just around the corner, actually. Draco called me in tears earlier. I’ve no idea why he broke down before he could tell me.”
By nine o’clock Rose and Hugo are both fast asleep, and Harry carries them to bed, tucks them in and presses a tender kiss to their foreheads, then returns to the living room to turn the zap through a few TV channels. He doesn’t find anything that captivates him and quickly losing interest in the visual entertainment, he chats with Walter, who lifts his head off his thigh and listens attentively, occasionally barking quietly in agreement or snorting to express his disapproval.
He had no idea whether it was charmed to disappear or not, but he fervently hoped Harry would let him keep the note as a sort of sentimental souvenir. It was exceptional, and Draco wanted to read it another ten-thousand times, at least.
Minutes passed, and Draco struggled to resist the urge to beg. His arse thrummed and throbbed. He wanted the pain so badly that he could barely think straight. A thick sort of haze seeped into his mind and settled around his thoughts, and whimpering softly, he felt his eyes fill with tears. The salty liquid stung and Draco’s eyelashes grew wet, but he stubbornly refused to give in and cry.
Draco’s tiny face was the only part of his body that was still visible; everything else was hidden by the costume. Narcissa reached out and tugged on his little tail, and Draco squealed and spun around. His dragon wings flapped, and he grinned from ear to ear.
A soft sob escaped Draco’s slightly parted lips, and Harry moved one of his hands away from Draco’s nipples. He summoned a bottle of lube from the nightstand and somehow managed to flick the lid open and squirt some of it onto his hand without stopping to play with Draco’s left nipple. Coating most of his palm and his fingers with the slightly chilly and clear thick liquid, he closed his fingers around Draco’s erection and stroked it ever so lightly.
With everybody’s mouths occupied, Harry makes himself a sandwich and sits down at the kitchen table to eat it and drink his coffee.
Harry had, without the use of magic, quite expertly whipped both ends of the rope to ensure it wouldn’t fall apart, and Draco dug the fingernail of his index finger into the inconspicuous black whipping.
Just as Harry finished reciting the spell, an intense jolt of forceful magic surged through him and melted into his own magical core. Draco’s eyes shot open, and he stared at the bracelet. It burnt hot under Harry’s touch, and his skin prickled, yet he instinctively knew that the charm wouldn’t leave a single mark.
Hermione had planned the entire event, organising and order the catering, the flowers, the marquee, and the round tables and matching chairs.
Draco suppressed the smirk that threatened to curl around the edges of his lips and refused to think about the reasons why he enjoyed it when Potter came back for more. There were many, and this morning’s incident had all but amplified them, but he refused to give in to their teasing pull and preferred to remain focused on the present.
One look at Harry told him that Harry seemed to feel much the same and for a moment Draco considered the possibility of them both making tender love on the soft grass beneath their feet but abandoned the idea for something else entirely.
At first, he focused on the already familiar smell of Draco’s hair, and it’s citrusy and tangy qualities. Harry associated it with life and a strong and steady heartbeat that tirelessly pumped oxygen-enriched blood into every corner of Draco’s body, providing him with the most basic kind of sustenance he needed to survive.
Draco arched a single eyebrow, and every single part of him wanted to tell Potter to get on with it and put all of his cards on the table, but instead of doing so, he chose to sit back down in his office chair and throw one leg over the other. He casually rested his hands in his lap and waited for Potter to get started, though his impatience was nearly enough to kill him.
“Considering that I believe honest communication to be such an important part of our dynamic, it, embarrassingly enough, never actually occurred to me to tell you the history behind the wrist thing, as you call it.”
Ian continued to howl with laughter, and for a moment, Draco seriously considered hexing him, but, for Scorpius benefit, he decided against such measures. That wasn’t the sort of reaction he wanted to teach to Scorpius, lest his son, once he started Hogwarts, thought it was the best way to go about resolving conflicts.
“I thought so. Total power exchange means you surrender all control, Draco. Everything. You know I don’t play without a safeword, so you’d keep that, and I’d respect your limits too, but you’d find them pushed a lot more often. The submission you give me now is so much sweeter than anything the two of us could ever negotiate in terms of you giving it all up.”
― quite on the contrary, it thrilled him in ways he sometimes struggled to find the right words for ― but it was merely a case of him needing to chase a couple of demons away before he could truly feel comfortable in his Dominant skin.
However, instead of giving in to that particular desire, Harry settled for letting his hand rest low on Draco’s hip. He moved further to the edge of his barstool and squeezed Draco’s hip hard enough to pull a hiss from him.
Draco bit his tongue and hesitated for a moment, suddenly unsure whether Scorpius was old or mature enough for that sort of conversation. After about thirty seconds of an internal back and forth, he decided to throw caution into the wind. This was his son, and despite his young age, Scorpius was the brightest, most tolerant, and most understanding person in the entire world. Some days, Draco struggled to fathom how he’d been blessed with such a miracle.
It is sometime around nine o’clock that he finally forces himself to find one last ounce of energy. Getting up, he leaves the room and ensuring that the nightlight by the door is switched on, he closes the door and heads straight into the bathroom for a long and relaxing shower. Afterwards, dressed in a fresh pair of boxer briefs and his favourite fluffy bathrobe, he settles in front of the television but doesn’t actually bother to switch it on. Instead, he reaches for a book, reads about two pages, then falls asleep right there and then.
Draco’s question didn’t even remotely surprise him. Neither did his mild sarcastic undertone and even though he knew that Draco would most definitely reprimand him for thinking that he owed him an apology, Harry shared his feelings anyway.
Potter merely growled in response, turned his head away and continued to, presumably, stare a hole into the ceiling of their office, not that he was going to be successful in his endeavour. Then again, Draco didn’t feel the need to point that out to Potter. Somehow, he had the feeling it would only unnecessarily infuriate his partner.
Harry wasn’t talking to him, appeared to be getting more and more depressed, and Draco could make neither heads nor tails out of it.
Draco hummed and casually toyed with his hand, inspecting a scar. Charlie still remembered where and when he’d had gotten it. It had happened a few years ago while trying to appease a somewhat wilful dragon. Everything had gone smoothly until the very last moment when he’d gone too far and thought he might be able to get away with petting the young dragon. It hadn’t wanted any of that kind of attention and had promptly lashed out, leaving a deep scratch on the back of his hand with one of its razor-sharp talons.
The question surprised Draco somewhat, and opening his eyes, he looked up at Harry and blinked. He wanted to ask what Harry meant but couldn’t respond.
At some point, the two of them excused themselves and went for a short walk around the grounds before it was time for dinner and Draco invited both Teddy and him to join him in the ballroom. As they entered, Draco drew his wand and flicked it at the extravagant chandeliers above their head.
Pushing the empty whisky tumbler towards Andrew, the bartender who’d patiently kept him company for the last hour or so, Harry wordlessly, and with half-hearted enthusiasm, motioned for a refill. He slid off his barstool and casually leaning against the bar, he watched as Andrew indulged him.
Harry paused and accio’ing a chair, he pointedly sat down, threw one leg over the other and got comfortable.
Charlie’s whip teased around his knees, his thighs, his hips, his waist, his chest and eventually, after a bit of advice from Liam on how to position his arms, his wrists. The touch immediately reminded Draco of all those times when Harry pressed his thumb against his pulse point and circled over it to calm him, and he inhaled sharply. He was vaguely aware of the fact that Harry was moving closer to him and then felt two strong arms sneak around his waist. Closing his eyes, Draco simply melted into the embrace, buried his face against Harry’s neck and sighed. Harry hugged him tightly and ran the flat of his hand gently up and down along his spine. Draco felt the familiar tug of apparition in the pit of his stomach, and the world around him descended into a spinning blur.
Once done and happy with his rigging, Harry reached for yet another coil of rope. After unfurling it, he connected it to the ankle part of the futomomo, ran it over the bamboo, added a bit of tension, and fastened it with a locking knot. He turned his attention back to Draco’s peach tie, and unlocking the rope that connected the tie with the suspension rod, Harry pulled it tight.
Pleased with Draco’s honest response, Harry inclined his head in approval. He’d taken his time with the creation of the harness, wanting to make sure he got it absolutely right, but Harry wasn’t the one wearing it, and as such he relied on Draco’s feedback to let him know how he felt.
“Don’t you think I don’t know that already? I’m OK with pretending though. Happy to keep doing it until you’re OK with not pretending anymore. Merlin knows I’ve got experience.”
The palm of Harry’s hand itched, and he curled his fingers, digging his nails deep into his skin. He wanted nothing more than to cast that hex, but his sense of professionalism, even when in the presence of one infuriating Draco Malfoy, kept him from it. That and, of course, the knowledge that it was pointless to try and go against a highly-skilled cursebreaker, even if said cursebreaker was a complete pain in his backside.
She responded in fluent English with just the lightest Romanian accent, then reached for a Portkey Authorisation form, filled it out, and offered the document to him.
Whenever Draco couldn’t quite help but compare Lily to her long-deceased grandmother, he struggled a lot to stop those thoughts from tearing at his heartstrings. It was in those moments that he always fought hard not to think much about the fact that a megalomaniac’s idiocy had led to Harry never having had the opportunity to grow up alongside his own mother. Draco knew better than to share those particular thoughts with his husband, but somehow, he could never quite shake the feeling that, perhaps, Harry knew. Potter was more perceptive than most people, Draco included, gave him credit for.
Abandoning the idea of attempting to do magic completely, he closed his eyes and rested his forehead lightly against the cold metal bar in front of him.
“Go on then, I’d love to see you try and slither out of the trouble you’ve got yourself in, sneaky little snake that you are.”
“If I get passionate morning sex, I’ll kneel, kiss your feet, and thank you for fucking me, Potter.”
“You see, Malfoy, Harry isn’t the only one who knows how to play dirty. I’ve got a couple of tricks up my sleeve as well.”
Draco lifted his head, turned it slowly, and focusing on him, he held his gaze for a few moments, then averted his eyes and looked down at their linked hands.
Harry’s brain threatened to short-circuit and shaking his head ever so slightly, he tried to pull himself into the present. He thoughts reluctantly allowed him to take control of his mind and he was about to quietly disappear, when he, to his horror, realised that he was no longer staring at Draco’s back but his face.
He tightened his hold on his whisky tumbler and sucking in a sharp breath, he held it firmly inside his belly for several seconds, then, and only because his lungs began to protest a little, he grudgingly exhaled. Opening his eyes once more, he blinked, then brought the glass of Firewhisky up to his lips and downed the remainder of his drink. It burnt down his throat, and for a moment, his eyes threatened to water. The sensation subsided shortly after, and as the fiery drink travelled down his oesophagus and filled his stomach, he felt Malfoy’s hand slowly travel up the inside of his thigh.
A part of Harry wanted to see whether he could seduce Draco into begging for it, and he used every single trick he knew to try and make that happen. He taunted Draco’s arms, teased the tresses over his shoulders, his back, his firm arse and his perfect thighs. Draco was fit and in excellent shape, and not even a bout of the flu had managed to change that. His metabolism was stronger than his sweet tooth, although Harry suspected that Draco’s magical core had something to do with it.
It looked exactly like Harry’s office at the Ministry and frowning, he narrowed his eyes and tried to find something that looked different.
He summoned a lavender-scented bubble bath solution and pouring a generous amount into the tub, he used a spell to mix it all up thoroughly.
“I mean it, Draco, don’t you play the hero just because you’re up on that stage telling your story to the kinky world. Your safety is paramount, and for this reason, I will tell Charlie and Caleb that you’re wearing a rope harness. That’s non-negotiable. Safety first.”
Harry squeezed his hip, welcoming his closeness. Draco turned his head and mumbled his next words directly into his neck.
He swallowed and put his knife down. Reaching across the table, Harry placed his hand on top of Draco’s; he squeezed it firmly.
“Ian, my tattooist is a true master. He designed the tree, infused it with its magical properties and although he thought I was insane when I first told him about the sigil idea, he rolled with it.”
Harry silently commended him for not swearing and moving his hand, he let a few more icy drops of water splash onto Draco’s skin.
Draco made a conscious effort to pull himself out of his musings before he descended too deeply into his own head, and rubbed the tips of his index and middle finger over the rope that sat snuggly at the back of his neck. His touch travelled down the entire length of the rope, sending pleasant vibrations through his torso, and for a moment it felt like Harry had wrapped his arms and legs around him and was hugging him tightly, refusing to let him go.
“Potter, you don’t stand a chance, no matter what rabbit you pull out of the proverbial Muggle magician’s hat.”
He was about to respond when the door to his mother’s private parlour opened and Harry entered the room and closed the door behind him. He’d left earlier to make a quick firecall, although since he’d been gone for the better part of an hour, whatever had needed resolving had taken much longer than Harry had initially anticipated.
Teddy nodded enthusiastically and bolted towards the door, skidding on the smooth wood beneath his feet. The second his godson was out of sight, Harry pulled Draco into his arms and kissed him hard, possessively claiming his mouth. He parted Draco’s willing lips with his own, and slithering his tongue into Draco’s mouth, he wrapped it around its twin, deepening the kiss.
He kissed Liam’s forehead, then broke away from their embrace, and turning on his heel, he left the living room.
“Friends get each other coffee all the time. We’ve dined out countless times, never once made me believe that you might be in love with me.”
“That’s me taking control. Did you notice how easy that was? How willingly you submitted to me and gave up your words for me? You’re such a good boy yet sometimes you don’t even realise it. You hide behind that mask of sass, but we both know there’s only one thing on your mind and that’s submitting to me, isn’t that so, my sweet little prince?”
The warmth increased, and letting his eyes fall closed, Draco slowly fucked himself with the toy. The little nob placed just the right amount of pleasure on his prostate and wave after wave of arousal surged through him.
Harry’s voice was low and husky, and he sounded just assertive enough for the pit of Draco’s stomach to fill with a mild bout of trepidation. It was the kind of fear that was fuelled by the intensely exciting prospect of the unknown and the knowledge that no matter what Harry was about to do, Draco was bound to enjoy it. He trusted Harry explicitly. He trusted him to stop or change his course of action when told
At Draco’s invitation, Harry’s stomach rumbled again, and he hastily took his seat, silently admiring the bowl of fresh shredded lettuce with salsa next to his plate.
“Want you, want to wreck you, want to make you mine, want to take you apart, want you, want you, want you so bad,” he murmured.
“One more, my little prince. I know you can be good for me. Just one more and I’ll give you what you need.”
“Full of excitement and anticipation, my perfect little prince. You are truly wonderful and so perfect for me this afternoon.”
Draco slowly opened his eyes and looked at him through their reflection in the floor-length mirror of their bedroom. His silvery-grey eyes gleamed, and there was a spark of pure joy in his eyes, yet at the same time, Draco also looked incredibly vulnerable. It ignited something fierce inside of Harry and his desire to protect and cherish Draco overruled all others.
Draco suspected it hailed from the years they’d spent trying to get a rise out of each other. Despite being friends with a successful working relationship under their belt, there were just some things neither one of them entirely managed to let go of. Taunting each other repeatedly was one of those things. In a way, it was childish and given the importance of both their jobs somewhat immature, but Draco had long since stopped questioning that part of their relationship. Instead, he took it for what it was.
Their contract stipulated that the only time Draco had to rein his sass in was when they were inside the playroom. That was the only room inside the entire house where Harry expected complete obedience and Draco always gave it willingly.
Ron had that uncanny ability to dig his nails in and demand that they talk about things―undoubtedly a trait he’d learnt from Hermione―and Harry wasn’t in the mood to talk.
Harry took a step forward. He went to wrap his arm around Draco’s shoulders, but Draco sidestepped him at the last moment.
Harry seldom wore his full uniform, not even at work, and only for special occasions, but today he’d made every effort to put on his entire uniform.
“Blab about what exactly? Our weekly luncheons and your strong preference for animal-based proteins? The fact that you seem to have entirely too much time on your hands which leads me to believe that you’re either not qualified to lead the Auror force or that the job isn’t taxing enough? Or, if whatever you’re so terrified of sharing with me, is of a more personal nature, and you’re tired of being Britain’s most eligible bachelor, let me just tell you, there are much easier ways to get the press interested in your probably non-existent love life.”
The comfort that radiated from Harry’s body wasn’t the kind one could gain from spending an afternoon in the sun, but rather an indestructible protective blanket made up of a mixture of unconditional love, mutual and unbroken trust and an indescribable kind of understanding of each other’s needs, wants and desires. Harry’s warmth provided safety. It was a kind of homeliness and Draco had grown so accustomed to it that the mere idea of losing the powerful bond, Harry and he shared, filled Draco with absolute terror.
“What kind of question is that? I expect to be escorted to the door, show me some of those impeccable aristocratic manners.”
Draco hummed, mumbled some sort of gibberish, and with a smile, Harry drew his wand, swished it, and conjured his Patronus. A swirl of silvery mist erupted from the tip of his wand, and a moment later, an impressive corporal stag appeared beside the bed and pawed the ground with his right forehoof, then tilted his head to the side in a silent question.
His arse felt hot, and every inch of it buzzed with a dull sort of pain that was simply delicious. When Harry grabbed and squeezed the back of his neck and pushed him forwards, he didn’t even attempt to resist.
Harry smirked and sank his teeth into Draco’s exposed neck, sucking the flesh right above one of the most important blood vessels in Draco’s body.
, Draco thought with a dirty smirk plastered square across his face as he headed down Diagon Alley straight towards Number 93: Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.
Draco yanked at the restraints and opened his mouth with the very intention to let out a plethora of foul langue, but when he felt someone poking a pointed object into his back, he stood perfectly still, and the words ‘
Draco had drafted the application for a sizeable wizarding gathering and Harry had rushed it through the relevant Ministry departments, getting it approved in no time. He didn’t often use his fame or his position as Department Head to get what he wanted, but if it was for a good cause, he did occasionally make the one or other exception.
Rather proud of his achievement, Draco glanced at the elaborate safety sigil with its crown and angel’s wings-like properties. As always, he’d used an ordinary Muggle felt marker to draw the completed design onto a thick, cream-coloured parchment. It had taken him nearly a month to finalise the sketch, and now that it was ready, Draco couldn’t wait to carve it into the stone in his hand.
He pulled his hands away and dropped them into his lap. He had yet to put his barriers back up and continued to look forlorn and lost.
At nearly fifteen, Lily was slowly turning into a fine young woman, and Draco couldn’t help but notice, yet again, how much she resembled Harry’s mother. He’d thought it obvious when he’d first seen her photograph next to an old magical picture of Harry’s beloved mother, but throughout the last few years, the likeness between the two had firmly cemented itself in Draco’s mind.
“I might live and work with my best friend, but that doesn’t automatically mean I’m also romantically involved with him!”
They collapsed in a heaped mess in the centre of the ballroom, and laughing freely and without restraint, Harry pulled Draco close and pressed a lingering kiss to his lips.
After what felt like the most prolonged slow torture session, Harry removed the dildo and pounded into him like there was no tomorrow.
Draco lifted his fingers away from the frame, hesitated for a split-second, then curled them against his palm to form a loose fist, and with a firm
This morning, Harry feels entirely overtaxed with keeping an eye on Rose and listening to both Hugo and Ron prattling into his ears about two entirely different subjects.
Potter?” Draco asked, putting particular emphasis on his title. “Or is that just your hero complex kicking in? Salazar knows you’ve got a massive problem with that.”
“Over the last month, I’ve received no less than twenty-nine offers, trying to poach me away from the department. They all arrived the week after you sat down with Barnabas Cuffe for that exclusive chat about what happened at the convention. It was a brilliant move, by the way.”
He crossed his arms in front of his chest and adjusting his stance, he squared his shoulder a bit to convey confidence along with his words.
Leaning back against the backrest of the tattered and well-worn leather armchair, Harry favoured whenever he and Draco visited their coffee shop, he wrapped his hands around his second mug of coffee. He brought it up to his lips but didn’t actually take a sip. Instead, he glanced over the cup’s rim and caught Draco’s gaze.
Before Draco had the chance to properly prepare himself, Harry stopped swinging, picked him up and got to his feet. He yelped in protest and thumped Harry’s shoulders repeatedly, but Harry paid him no heed.
“I want you to come too, my sweet little prince, just not yet. I want to keep you on edge for just a little bit longer. You’re so beautiful like this, it’s truly breath-taking. Those flushed cheeks, so stunning. Hm, and just look at those lips. My love, your lips are sinfully beautiful. I can’t decide whether I want to kiss them or bite them, maybe both.”
“I knew that when we were eleven. Took you a bit longer to figure it out, didn’t it? Oh well, we can’t all be Slytherins, can we? Some of us end up being Gryffindorks.”
Draco couldn’t help but somewhat admire Brenda’s professionalism, and he decided to ignore her earlier prying question. He erased it from his memory, smiled more sincerely and prepared to answer her question.
He squeezed Draco’s hands lightly, using physical affirmations rather than verbal ones to continuously reassure Draco.
“You know Malfoy, I do like a bit of a show, and I enjoy watching a fit bloke pleasuring himself, working on getting himself off, except I’m entirely disinclined to let you come any time soon. That hard prick of yours is making you perfectly obedient, and I just know you won’t dare to talk back because if you do, you can forget about your own release. I’ll leave you hanging and desperate, and I won’t lose any sleep over you not getting to orgasm.”
A quite mischievous smirk hugged the edges of his mouth, and his eyes sparkled with an endearing sort of deviousness. It was the kind of sly Slytherin wickedness, the type that had attracted him to Draco from the very beginning.
He ate about half of his second clementine, offered a carpel to Draco, then placed his hand back on top of Draco’s and squeezed it lightly.
Harry doesn’t need to summon his glasses from the nightstand beside his bed to work out that a series of harmless, miniature indoor fireworks have just exploded above his head. But the
“I would like to amend my offer from a few days ago,” he said, “so, instead of denying you completely for two weeks, I would like to offer you the option of an orgasm at some point during those two weeks, but you will have to be a really good boy in order for me say yes, and let you come.”
Harry lifted his hand and Draco felt the pressure of his thumb, stopping him from worrying his lower lip before he could even get that far.
“We made out the other day, but when I tried to take things further and especially when I tried to submit, he just froze and stopped. But even while we were kissing and touching it felt like he was doing it to do me a favour rather than because he really wanted it.”
Draco’s consent and his submission were powerful enough to bring Harry to his knees and drive him to the brink of madness in the most perfect way imaginable. He was utterly defenceless against the effects they had on him, and he cherished Draco’s gifts to him more than anything in the world.
He caught his mother’s roguish smile and knew that it would be up to him to confess his sins to Harry.
It had been a long day, and while tonight’s conversation had been exhausting, he was glad that Draco had given up on the notion of punishing himself.
Instead, he’d concluded that he rather enjoyed the challenge of trying to guess Potter’s current mood or the puzzle of what whatever was going on in his mind, what captured his attention, what distracted him time and time again, and what left him entirely unfazed.
“Potter, I bet you all the contents of every single Malfoy vault that this boy is not going to end up in Gryffindor.”
There was even a French press filled to the brim with piping hot, black coffee. Harry walked over to the dining table, removed the glass dome that covered the food, and reached for a chicken sandwich. He bit into it, and as the zesty juicy flavours of marinated, cooked chicken, exploded in his mouth, he reached for the French press and poured a generous amount of coffee into his favourite bright-red Gryffindor mug.
Originally, I'd had a very different plan for this chapter and how it was supposed to go, but after writing this version, I must conclude that Harry's and Draco's idea for dealing with their relationship problems as a lot better than mine.
In just a few minutes, they were due to showcase their teamworking skills, and because Harry had been distracted and perpetually lost in his own world ever since this morning, Draco found it hard to get into the zone.
Intense relief washed over Draco and he finally allowed himself to entirely give in to the sensations of the orgasm he hadn’t been allowed to have for the last week. His cock twitched and his arse clenched around Harry’s fingers. His prostate throbbed, and wave after wave of hotness rolled through and over him.
“Just like you keep telling yourself that you’re not obsessed with him? I never did understand what attracted you to him, but you never could resist his pull. Not back then and most definitely not now.”
Draco’s gasp didn’t go unnoticed, but instead of reacting to it, Harry simply picked up the transfigured rope. He found its bight with the practised ease of a skilled rigger used to handling rope―someone who felt rope rather than saw it―and cheekily slipped the rope around Draco’s index finger. Pulling tight, but not tight enough to cause injury or block the flow of blood, Harry tugged his little prince’s hand across the table, gently forcing him to move to the edge of his seat.
He turned his head sideways and looked at Draco, who winked conspicuously. A rather prominent smirk danced around the corners of his mouth.
Harry smiled and wordlessly pulled Draco into another hug, then kissed him with a fiery passion which he allowed to bubble up from the depths of his stomach.
“As for that note,” Potter motioned towards the parchment with a casual hand gesture, “what I’d like to talk to you about requires your utmost discretion. Whether you choose to believe me or not, I trust that you won’t share my secrets with the press. It wouldn’t be in your best interest to do so. However, trusting you and trusting others are two entirely different matters. Should anyone get wind of what I’d like to share with you, they will try absolutely anything and everything to get you to reveal my secret. As you can see, I’ve already signed the paper. Take it as a token of my willingness to confide in you. If you sign, yes, trying to share my secret will cause you terrible distress, but, and you know that as well as I do, any charms or potions designed to entice you to talk will be rendered entirely useless.”
. You nearly got it right once there, see that you don’t forget or I’ll make you remember. I’m rather fond of my title, and if you want me to listen to your pathetic attempts of talking yourself out of trouble, you’d better make sure not to forget.”
“Sweet little prince, fuck yourself for me, let me watch just how much you missed this, how much you need this, show me, my love.”
Draco’s cheeks coloured a little in response to the compliment. They always did whenever Harry used his pet name. With it came a certain kind of intimacy that they both found irresistible.
“You wouldn’t. Being Director Potter keeps you busy enough, there’s no way I’ll consent to you loaning your skills to the Met.”
Draco wound his little arms around her neck, and when he gave her a slobbery kiss, Narcissa welled up but swallowed past the lump in her throat and instead of allowing herself to get overly emotional, she hugged her precious boy a little tighter and ruffled his soft, blond hair.
Before reaching for a second ice cube, Harry cast a mild warming charm and let it tingle over Draco’s skin. It wasn’t warm enough to melt the wax, but it certainly removed some of the lingering aftereffects of the ice. He then reached for that second ice cube and once again starting at the small of Draco’s back, he guided the frozen water sphere in a slow zig-zag motion over Draco’s left butt cheek and along the back of his thigh, then up again.
Teddy opened his mouth in an attempt to protest, but Harry simply placed a single finger over his godson’s lips and silenced him that way and Draco watched and smiled to himself.
“As if you’re not excited about the fact that I’m confident we’ll still be hot for each other in forty years.”
Draco felt him hook a finger around the tight rope running along the back of his neck. Harry tugged on it, and letting out a slight moan, Draco, for a moment, struggled to keep his balance. Harry’s words had filled him with intense anticipation, and although he was dying to know what Harry’s plans were, he knew better than to ask. It was of no use. Harry was excellent at keeping secrets and never gave himself away, except when he did it on purpose. For this very reason, Draco resigned himself to the fact that he had to wait to discover whatever surprise Harry had prepared for him. Still, he couldn’t quite resist the temptation to push a little.
Draco’s arms finally gave in and falling forward into the strangest yoga pose of all time, one that was neither one nor the other, he let himself be fucked.
Draco laughed right into his ear, and Harry tried his hardest not to let Draco’s warm breath distract him. It tickled and teased the shell of his ear, and he had to fight to fend off the avalanche of emotions that threatened to rain down on him. Harry took a deep breath, forced his feelings to the back of his mind, and rooted himself firmly in the here and now.
The moment Draco turned his head, his breath caught in his throat and any rational thought, he’d ever had, fled from his brain. His mouth fell open, and it didn’t matter how hard he tried; he couldn’t stop himself from staring.
“Nope, didn’t even go in. Coordinated from the outside with my lieutenants. A perk of being a battalion chief.”
Draco let the words wash over him and allowed himself a moment to blissfully float, indulging in the sensations that flowed through him.
Charlie’s chest constricted and his heart struggled to beat properly, but he stoically kept all of his emotions to himself, smiled, and fervently hoped his false positivity would trickle down and show in his voice.
Whenever he brought along, she melted and turned into a complete pile of goo. Somehow, in the years he and Liam had been in a relationship, his boy had managed to wrap his mother-in-law completely around his little finger. She practically was putty in his hands. It was almost as bad as whenever his mother got her hands on one Harry Potter, whom she adored to the ends of the universe and back.
It was a bit of a direct and rather private question, but given Draco’s level of upset, he didn’t want to rule out sub drop. However, to know for sure, he needed more information. Before he had all the facts, he couldn’t possibly come to any definite conclusion.
Judging by the hungry and pleading look on his face, he was clearly unable to take much more of Harry’s teasing, and Harry smirked.
“Harry James Potter, please don’t turn into the infuriating idiot you were back at Hogwarts, OK? And don’t even think about giving me some ridiculous speech about how you should always keep it together and be strong and all that because you’re the Dominant in this D/s relationship. You’re human, and that makes you perfectly imperfect. I’m not mad that you found it impossible to let me in, or that you struggled to accept my submission when I offered it to you a few days ago. A bout of Dom drop is never going to make me respect you any less when we play. You are my Sir and showing me a bit of weakness isn’t going to stop me from wanting to fall at your feet when you give me
“If you’ve already established that neither one of you is going anywhere that doesn’t include the other, you may as well just make things official, Harry.”
It wasn’t weakness that drove Draco towards letting go, and it wasn’t a thirst for power that drove Harry towards controlling him. To Draco, submission meant freedom, and to Harry, it meant being allowed to take care of him.
Granted, they bickered most of the time, and also managed to think of a thousand different ways to rile each other up, but somehow the truce held, and they got on with each other. Sometimes it felt a bit like Ron had taken Harry’s place when it came to exchanging sassy insults and riling each other up until they exchange resulted in a friendly trade of abuses, as they squabbled back and forth over a game of chess or a couple of drinks.
It doesn’t really matter that Charlie hasn’t actually said anything of the sort. Harry is still convinced that he and all the other members of the Weasley family―Ron, despite being his best mate, included― are secretly judging him for leaving the Aurors and his up-and-coming career at the DMLE. He doesn’t think that they understand why he chooses to work in a joke shop and helps to raise two children that don’t even belong to him.
The kids wake up some ten minutes later and are indeed ravenous, but shortly after brushing their teeth and getting into their pyjamas, they crawl into their beds and are fast asleep within seconds. Harry makes sure to tuck them in, and sits with them for a few minutes, for no other reason than that he finds their company comforting. Walter joins him and curls up on his lap. Harry ruffles him behind the ears and smiles to himself. He yawns a few times but doesn’t manage to find the energy to clamber to his feet.
“Potter, you have too much of a fondness for reckless behaviour and stupid bouts of bravery, you wouldn’t have lasted a day in the dungeons,” he said.
Only the fact that Draco hadn’t been able to stop himself from staring and had practically drooled all over his Auror uniform had distracted him enough to stop him from spanking Draco in his office in the middle of their workday. The way Draco had licked his lips and silently devoured him with those silvery-grey eyes had him imagining every possible position in which he could fuck Draco without removing his uniform. He knew exactly what was on Draco’s mind. Their roleplay scene, and the way Harry had taken him apart, slow and steady, and until he’d reduced Draco down to an incoherent babbling boneless mess.
Harry corked the phial once more and slipped it back into his shirt’s chest pocket. He then got up and sliding one arm underneath Draco’s neck and the other underneath his knees, he lifted Draco off the metal bed and straight into his arms.
He could feel the tears prick at the corners of his eyes and blinking furiously, he tried to discourage them from falling but failed, and they promptly ran down his cheeks.
Harry parted his lips and licked them, and Draco captured them in a cheeky kiss. It was a deep and sloppy kiss and by the time he pulled away his lips tingled with energy, felt full and swollen and were wet.
Well, after such an intense scene, aftercare is absolutely essential and as such, I didn't want to leave it too long until the next chapter.
Upon pulling away, Harry murmured the words against Draco’s lips and felt them curl upwards and into a content smile.
He and Charlie continue to talk about dragons. Today, the main topic is the curious fact that the hatching of a single Antipodean Opaleye has rendered an entire team of highly-trained Dragonologists utterly incapable of performing their assigned duties on time.
Draco dithered for a few moments, then shuffled on the bed beside Harry. His hesitation didn’t stem from the fact that he was unsure how to handle the situation, but rather because he felt just a little overwhelmed. Without exerting any effort at all, Harry had twisted his mind and made it, so Draco found it impossible to resist his utterly devious demand.
, Harry thinks and decides that he most definitely needs more coffee to cope with how this day is already not going well at all.
He’s grateful when Walter interrupts his train of thought just as he’s about to turn onto Horizont Alley and head towards Carkitt Market. Harry stops for a moment and casts a longing glance at the closed doors of The Hideout, his favourite coffee shop, and the one place he can usually be found when he isn’t helping George to run the joke shop or is busy minding Rose and Hugo. It’s his preferred place to sit and people-watch whilst he consumes an extraordinary amount of coffee and treacle tart. He remembers Ron’s playful dig, teasing him over the fact that he’s single-handedly responsible for The Hideout’s booming business and smiles. Some days, Harry secretly agrees with his best friend, but he has no plans to tell Ron that he’s right.
“No, my little prince, I’m not. We both know that if you abuse it and turn Grimmauld Place into a sort of Slytherin shrine, I’ll spank your gorgeous behind until it’s Gryffindor-red and you won’t be able to sit comfortably for a day or two.”
The burn deep inside of him slowly subsided and each time he lifted himself off Harry’s hard and throbbing cock and sank back down on it, taking it all inside of him, a wave of intense pleasure spread through him. He alternated between lifting himself up and quietly rocking his hips and with his prostate so utterly sensitive, he couldn’t help but arch his back and moan.
“Well, I will admit that there’s something exquisitely hot about having you wrap yourself all around me and hold me tight before I fall asleep, but as you can very well see, I haven’t died nor have I suffered mentally or emotionally. We’re all allowed to feel a bit off, Harry, you know that. In fact, you taught me that. You also know that I’m not mad or hold a grudge over your lack of interest being physically intimate, although I’m happy to repeat those words as many times as it takes for the message to sink in properly. Yes, I’ve missed it, but being able to share a bed with you all through the night is just as special. So is waking up next to you every morning, by the way. It’s a different kind of special, but it’s still special, it’s a privilege I absolutely cherish.”
“Talking about intervention, Director Potter, Sir, when did you decide that Auror Rowan and his partner could benefit from your knowledge?”
Draco grunted and twisted beneath him, and Harry bit his shoulder harder, silently forcing him to still his movements.
He glanced at his wristwatch and gauging the time, he estimated that a little over five minutes had passed, and since he didn’t want to leave Draco any longer, he made his way upstairs. The carpet that covered the stairs which led up to Draco’s old bedroom was soft beneath his feet and for a few moments, Harry remembered that time when Draco had surprised him with silken ties, asking him to spice things between them up as they gradually delved into the world of kink, slowly incorporating the lifestyle and a more pronounced D/s dynamic into their relationship.
Harry didn’t think he needed to open the card to understand why Draco was so agitated and furious. He stuffed the card back inside the envelope and turning on the heel of his boot; he faced Molly.
Draco shook his head but shifted so that his shoulder fitted snuggly underneath Harry’s, wordlessly seeking more body contact. He felt Harry move his arm from the sofa’s backrest and wrap it around his shoulders, pulling him further into a protective embrace. Biting the inside of his bottom lip, Draco swallowed a tiny sigh and pushed past the light bout of the blues that persistently attempted to settle all around him and drag him under.
Draco felt Harry’s thumb press against his pulse point, felt it circle over and around it, and latched on to the intensely familiar touch, let it wash over him.
Combined with succulent pieces of freshly-baked fish folded into creamy blankets of white sauce and crispy-topped, buttery mash, chenin blanc was the kind of wine that turned fish pie into a dish one might order at a Michelin three-star restaurant; an exceptional meal worth a special journey. According to Harry, it wasn’t the wine that made the fish pie special, but all the effort Draco had put into getting everything just right. He’d prepared everything from scratch, refusing to use anything that had been made in advance. To a certain extent, it had stopped him from fretting about tonight’s dinner. Although, the moment he’d placed the pie inside the oven, all that had changed and he’d come very close to sinking into a state of complete hysteria.
Every single one of Draco’s emotional states had its own little tell, and over the past two years, Harry had tried his best to keep a close eye on Draco to identify and learn them all.
and it instantly made Harry grin widely. His amused reaction only furthered Draco’s annoyance although, and Harry was sure of that, most of it was simply carefully executed pretence.
Inhaling deeply, Draco briefly closed his eyes to savour the intoxicating uniqueness of delicate floral notes blended with a very characteristic freshness of tea leaves and bergamot along with warm aromas of sandalwood and amber. The lime juice, he’d drizzled into the tea, added a pleasant zest, and taking a few small sips, Draco nodded in approval.
“I’ll meet you halfway, my little prince. A verbal reprimand is all you’re going to get. Listen carefully.”
A zap of excitement jolted down his spine and pooled low in his groin, then spread outward, consuming him. A wave of white-hot warmth washed over him, and he sighed softly, contently.
He groaned, felt Harry pound into him, and heard Harry moan loudly. He came a second time that night and somehow, as he shot rope after rope of white-hot come into his arse, Harry managed to stroke him to completion as well, and Draco came on a loud sob, actually passing out from the force of his orgasm and the intensity of Harry’s and his play.
As if on cue, the two mugs dropped onto the wooden floor beneath Harry’s feet and shattered into several pieces.
Harry followed his gaze and watched and listened as Tifereth welcomed her submissive, for the evening, which she introduced as Eirwen, a name that complimented the fair-skinned, dark-haired woman beautifully.
He wasn’t entirely sure whether Draco would be able to discern what he was trying to say, but he didn’t dwell on that. Instead, he focused on pouring everything he had to give in to the kiss and relished in the way Draco wrapped his arms around him and pulled him close.
“I was going to say they bicker like an old married couple, but they actually are an old married couple,” Draco drawled.
“Just so you know, Potter, I am fully aware that Aurors are exempt from the Anti-Apparition Wards, the Ministry has in place,” Draco hissed, once Potter was within earshot.
He kept his voice low and soft and injected a bit of silky persuasiveness into it, making it reasonably impossible for Draco to resist his words.
At first, he’d tried to fight it in every imaginable and conceivable way, but tiredness and the stress of a brand-new work week looming over his head had made it extremely difficult to resist the dark thoughts that threatened to take over, and at some point, even magic had stopped working. Apparently, it was impossible to use Occlumency to shield one’s own mind from the destructive forces of one’s own thoughts.
Harry stood, motionless, in the middle of all those shards and Draco instinctively straightened up and uncrossed his hands. He waved his wand hand and wandlessly repaired the two mugs, then carefully levitated them over to the counter and placed them right next to the teapot. Once he’d done so, he turned his head and met Harry’s gaze. Harry’s emerald green eyes were mesmerising, and for a few seconds, Draco lost himself in their seemingly impenetrable depth.
Draco huffed out the word, and Harry claimed his arse with a harsh thrust, burying himself balls-deep inside of Draco.
Harry swallowed past the large lump that had suddenly taken up residence in his throat and keeping his eyes firmly closed, he took another deep breath. This time, he focused entirely on the one smell that was Draco in his purest form and savoured every tiny nuance of it. It was a smell you simply couldn’t reproduce. There was nothing in nature that could replicate it. It was Draco’s very essence, and it awoke something fierce inside of Harry. Not only did it compel him to protect Draco, and to keep him safe from harm, it also made it entirely impossible to resist him. Ignoring that scent simply wasn’t an option. It was powerful enough to awaken something truly primal inside of Harry, something he hadn’t been able to feel before his bite. It was as if his wolf had unlocked a part of him the average human being no longer had access to.
A quick flick of his wand―and Harry only uses it to cast the spell instead of doing it wandlessly because he’s holding it and the holly feels so perfectly lovely in his hand, at home and like it belongs―and a mumbled
He murmured the words against Draco’s perspired, salty-tasting skin and nipping at it, he teasing sank his teeth into the pale flesh, forcing a yelp to rise through Draco’s chest and escape through his parted lips. Harry chuckled, fully aware that the sound, somewhat muffled by Draco’s bare leg, sent pleasant vibrations through Draco. On a mission to drive Draco mad, Harry continued to tease him until a breathless ‘
Draco quietly chuckled to himself and taking a few more sips of coffee, he let a few memories of his and Harry’s life together flash past. Things had turned out quite well between them.
Teddy, who’d long since abandoned his shoes, skidded over the smooth parquet floor and when Draco flicked his wand again, and soft, classical music drifted through the air, Harry at once felt the urge to dance with his little prince.
“Best get you home, huh? Sitting in my office while I work isn’t going to help you get better. Just give me a couple of minutes to gather a few things, and we’ll be on our way.”
“Come on then, S, I’ll teach you how to make a proper coffee. Master Potter here has some rather peculiar tastes.”
Potter said nothing, didn’t even react to his blatant bait, and Draco briefly wondered whether, on top of having lost his marbles, he was now also losing his touch. He’d always managed to get a rise out of Potter and the fact that he hadn’t managed to achieve that goal just now thoroughly irked him.
Harry whipped his sticky hand on the bed, and even though he was floating in a post-orgasmic trance, he reached out and touched Draco’s leather restraints. He found the panic snap and the cuffs fell open.
“Weasley,” Draco said, turning his head slightly to look at Charlie, “I am not of such anserine stupidity, as to let myself be dragged into a duel with that dunce over there, even if the mere fact that he exists is presently grating on my nerves. Besides, all Potter here ever does is cast
Instead, Draco casually rested a hand on Harry’s thigh, just above the knee, and Harry felt the body heat seep from the palm of Draco’s hand, through the thick fabric of his jeans, and directly into his skin. Draco didn’t squeeze or apply any other form of pressure, but Harry felt him relax into his proprietorial embrace, content with letting him have this moment, allowing him to be in control.
Harry glanced at the small, star-shaped container, Draco had pushed across the table and over to him and grimaced ― he didn’t have to ask to know what was inside. Star Grass salve was a dark-green medicinal healing balm for soothing sores and wounds, and while the salve Draco made himself was incredibly potent, Harry simply couldn’t stand the smell of it. The stench made him feel sick up to the point where he felt like regurgitating the contents of his stomach, though the last time he’d told Draco, he’d ended up with a sore backside. Draco hadn’t taken kindly to the criticism and had, without any warning or notice, hexed him.
Something in Harry’s voice instantly made Draco take a step closer towards Harry and reaching out, he slowly closed his long fingers around the rough old rope, and stood between Harry’s parted legs.
Sometimes, after an intense scene with Harry or an extended period of continuous submission, Draco felt reborn, refreshed, reinvigorated. He felt like someone had cast the Reviving Spell on him, and like he’d been handed a potion that energised him. Draco imagined that Harry felt much the same way. Losing himself in his Dominant role meant letting go of all the responsibility he had at work and all the pressure that came along with it. Instead of having to focus on cases and meetings, he could concentrate on the one person he loved and cared for.
So far, the evening had been a complete success. Roísín had arrived a few minutes before dinner was ready and after formally introducing her to Harry, they’d settled around the dining table and engaged in a bit of small talk. Since Roísín felt a bit shy in Harry’s presence, Draco had let the conversation to try and distract her a little.
Harry grinned and hugging Draco that little bit tighter, he yawned, pulled the duvet a little tighter around Draco and himself and wandlessly dimmed the lights, dipping his and Draco’s bedroom into darkness.
“If you want to know whether I fancy you or not, who the fuck doesn’t? Have you seen yourself lately?”
Draco casually leant against the wooden worktop behind the counter and picking up his favourite white ceramic mug with his initials on the side, filled nearly to the brim with a freshly-brewed steaming 2020 vintage blend, he inhaled deeply and smiled contently. A stroke of good fortune had let him to unearth this particular blend of three rare types of coffee, and he was thoroughly excited to finally have found the time to brew himself some of it.
With a smile, Harry combed his fingers through Draco’s damp hair and placed a gentle kiss on his cheek.
He genuinely enjoyed Draco’s scathing sass. It was hot. He also remembered the conversation during which Draco had confessed to him that he’d fancied him long before they’d put their differences aside. During that very conversation, the look on Draco’s face had made it several things quite clear ― he’d most definitely had had a crush on him back then.
“Fucking hell, Potter, it’s a bit early for those shenanigans,” Draco reprimanded him but rose to his feet, walked over to him and firmly patted him on the back.
Every now and then, he paused to read something, right up until he found a loose parchment between the pages of the book. The paper, thick and creamy-white in nature, wasn’t part of a book but contained a sigil, Draco had created the other day. He’d taken the inspiration for it from another grimoire, the Ars Notoria, the oldest book in the Lesser of the Keys grimoire, a book filled with prayers said to strengthen and focus one’s mental powers.
Pressing his thumb against Draco’s pulse point was Harry’s way of silently reminding him that he would always stand by him; that he had his back and that Draco wasn’t alone.
“You know, I do occasionally regret convincing the old hat that I definitely didn’t want him to sort me into Slytherin. Just imagine, the crush you had on me during the Triwizard Tournament might have had a different outcome altogether.”
Once he’d ordered all the clothes, Harry turned back to face him, and with a genuinely devious smirk, he dragged a small three-legged table from behind the heavy floor-length curtain beside the sofa. From what Draco could tell, it was made of high-quality polished ebony. Harry lifted the piece of furniture, Draco had never seen before, off the ground and carried it over. He placed it in front of Draco, whose eyes were immediately drawn to the flat, square, black velvet-covered jewellery box in its centre.
Even with a decade and a half of practice under his belt, Harry was no stranger to the steady thrum of nerves that preceded the start of every tie he’d ever done. His excitement grew steadily, and each rhythmic thump of his heart sent a new wave of it rushing through every fibre of his body.
Harry’s interjection cut Draco off, and he couldn’t help but laugh heartily. Laughter bubbled up from deep inside of him, and it was infectious enough for the crowd to chuckle along.
Draco gave him the sweetest smile and something fierce clenched around Harry’s heart, holding it in a vice-grip.
He rose from his chair and wordlessly enveloped his mother in a tight embrace. Draco was much taller and stronger than her, and at first, she squeaked in surprise, but then she relaxed into his impromptu embrace. She wrapped her arms around his waist and snuggled into him. They stood like this for a minute or two, then Draco pulled back and smiled at his mother.
He turned 180 degrees, and the new ropes at the back of the peach tie and the chest harness now supported his weight. Harry removed the other ropes, dropping them onto the ground as soon as they were free. He then dressed the tension, adjusting the ropes so that Draco’s upper body and his hips were firmly held in place, and he flooded, suspended off the ground, in mid-air.
“My fierce little dragon,” she whispered and shed a few silent tears. “Mummy loves you very much, my precious boy.”
The nervous energy from earlier had spilt forth from his gut and mingled with his magic. He could feel it thrum through his veins to the steady beat of his heart. It made his skin tingle and heightened his level of excitement. Draco pressed his lips together, briefly closed his eyes and inhaled deeply through his nose. He held the air inside of him for several seconds, then exhaled slowly through his mouth, relaxing a tiny bit. It wasn’t enough to settle him, but it was a start.
So, instead, he settled for feigning an apology and prayed to all four founders of Hogwarts that Harry bought his little white lie.
Draco’s skin was fair, but these days, and especially right now, it had a sickly grey hue to it, one Harry didn’t like, not even one bit, mainly because it reminded him of death and even though the war was over, and had been for the last twenty-two years, he’d seen enough death to last him a lifetime, and even a hint of it made him uncomfortable. Draco pressed his lips together and pulled them into a tight line. There wasn’t even a hint of a smile on his face.
He snuggled close again and caressing Draco’s cheek, the side of his neck, and his shoulder, Harry pressed a gentle kiss to Draco’s forehead.
Potter―now dressed in a tight-fitting pair of black jeans and a tailored burgundy button-up shirt―was already there, idly waiting for him as though having lunch together was an activity they engaged in regularly.
Lily, on the other hand, was the perfect Daybreak Morning blend; a light roast mixture of beans from the Americas and East Africa. She was bright with a smooth finish that supplied a subtle fruity sweetness with distinct cherry blossom overtones and a mild caramel finish. Described in coffee flavours, she was sunshine in one’s mouth, with tangy citrus flavours and an endless array of floral notes. She was genuinely unpretentious and sweet.
Instead, he waited for Draco to hand it to him, and unlocking his arms again, he made sure to brush his fingertips against the back of Draco’s hand, where he lingered for a moment longer than entirely necessary and simultaneously held Draco’s gaze.
Draco moaned, thrust up to entice him to go further and Harry sucked one of Draco’s balls into his mouth and showed it some love. He could feel Draco’s cock pulse against the side of his face and taking another deep breath, Harry continued to tease Draco’s hole, playing with it until it flexed beneath his fingertips, trying to invite him in. The muscle gradually relaxed ever so slightly, and Harry pushed a single finger into Draco, allowing the intense heat and tightness to envelop him. Draco practically screamed in delight and Harry finger-fucked him slowly. He’d done this often enough to be able to effortlessly find the walnut-sized nub that when stimulated sent bolts of lightning through Draco and adding a little more lube, Harry prepared to insert a second finger. It made it so much easier to tease Draco’s prostate.
She squeals with excitement, and she cuddles the miniature Puffskein, gently running her fingers through its furry coat. Her eyes sparkle brightly and ruffling Rose’s hair, Harry crouches down in front of her and places his hands on her shoulders, squeezing gently.
Harry lifted his free hand and snapping his fingers, he waved them into the general direction of the hallway’s main light source. As they climbed the stairs all the way up to the fourth floor, the light on the third floor continued to illuminate the corridor that led to the large en-suite bedroom, Draco had shared with Harry for the past two years. Harry’s and his bedroom had become an anchor to him, a place he called home. Inside it, Draco felt like he truly belonged. He felt loved, secure, understood, valued, and cherished.
A nagging little voice tried telling him that he’d pay bitterly for his cheek, but he couldn’t bring himself to stop.
Harry briefly contemplated cracking a silly joke to lighten the mood but decided against it when Draco looked at him with wide, disbelieving eyes. His lashes fluttered, then he closed his eyes and let out an anguished wail.
Draco lowered his gaze a little and pulling his left hand out of Harry’s loose grasp, he pressed it against Harry’s heart, letting it linger there.
For the longest time, they both sat in comfortable silence and unable to resist the temptation of these exquisite biscuits, Draco treated himself to one of them after all. As a precautionary measure, however, he moved his chair further back and kept his mug―still half-full of tea―as far away from the grimoire as he possibly could.
Before Harry could answer, Draco laughed beside him and pulling one arm out from behind his back, he wrapped it around Teddy.
He was quite aware that he’d gone a bit over the top with the number of items, he’d chosen, but he’d lost himself in the moment ― shopping occasionally did that to him.
Ordinarily, that kind of reaction made Draco threaten him with a stinging hex, or at the very least frown, but tonight, he smiled.
In-between Draco’s pants and his steadily incoherent pleas for more, he somehow managed to ask for permission to come and Harry took his sweet time to answer him.
Shutting his mind off, Draco let his thoughts be thoughts, and instead of dwelling on ideas, problems, and plans, he simply settled in the here and now.
He was vaguely aware of the fact that someone had adjusted the spotlight and blinking he glanced around the room but couldn’t see much more than a sea of shadows, which suited him just fine.
“It was after our bruncheon from the other day. We had a lazy evening at home that day, but when I went to put a film on, he asked if we could go for a walk instead, so we made a trip down to the Westminster end of Victoria Embankment and went for a lovely evening stroll.”
A small part of Harry continued to urge him to take control, but he didn’t act on it; his desire to do so wasn’t quite strong enough just yet.
“I don’t recommend it but if you insist on finding out how far you can go until I punish you, go right ahead.”
George was very busy whispering something into his wife’s ear, and Ron had the are-you-fucking-mental-expression painted all over his face.
Instead, he took his time to look at Draco, really look at him. He imagined slowly running his fingers through Draco’s hair and what it might feel like. The tips of his fingers tingled with anticipation and the memory of the last time he’d played with Draco’s hair. Those platinum-blond locks were incredibly soft to the touch, and Harry itched to twist his fingers into it and give it a bit of a playful tug. Not enough to hurt, he didn’t want that, but just enough to get Draco to tilt his head upward so that Harry could kiss him, really kiss him.
He had no intention of spending all evening with a raging hard-on, although realistically and given the fact that Draco would be wearing his ropes concealed underneath his clothes, chances of not getting aroused were slim.
reveals that it is only five-thirty in the morning. Harry can’t help but grumble about the wretchedness of having been forced awake at such an absurd time. He ends the spell just as swiftly as he’s cast it and squeezes his eyes firmly shut. Mainly, because he knows that if he keeps looking at the time, he’s going to be a miserable grump for the rest of the day ― and there simply isn’t enough coffee in the world to cure him of that sort of mood, at least not once it has got its claws into him.
It was a little game Draco had taken great pleasure in, well, at least up until the point where he’d realised that Potter’s interest in him wasn’t purely professional in nature. Upon his discovery of the true nature of Harry’s feelings for him, he’d changed his tactic ever so slightly. He hadn’t taken offence nor had the realisation that Potter found him attractive made him want to quit working with Potter, but, at the same time, he found most of Harry’s actions genuinely confounding.
He succumbed to the sensations, and by the time Harry had eased half of his cock into him, Draco found himself begging for more. Harry obliged and pushed all of his thick hard cock into him while pushing the toy inside too. He gave Draco an adequate amount of time to relax and adjust, then slowly pulled almost all the way out, only to push right back inside.
Tremor after tremor surged through him and pulling away from the kiss, he locked eyes with Draco, who did his best to keep his own open as he nearest his climax.
In response to the question, Draco dragged his bottom lip into his mouth and chewed on it; however, despite his hesitation and silence, the way he squirmed in his chair and the dreamy look in his eyes told Charlie everything he needed to know. He didn’t need to know any of the details of Draco’s and Harry’s play to work out that whatever Harry had cooked up inside his devious little brain, Draco had thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.
Harry bit his shoulder and moved his finger inside of him, pulling it out and pushing it back inside. He teased and tormented Draco for several long minutes, then reached for the last ice cube and taunted Draco’s hole with it. He dragged the ice over and around Draco’s tight hole and eventually pushed it inside.
Draco looked down, and to his left he spotted a midnight-blue bottle of lube and a black dildo. It resembled Harry’s cock but was slightly thinner and had a little nob especially suitable for prostate stimulation.
“A representation of balance and harmony, a semi-physical doorway, a reflection of my magical core, ever-changing, always renewing, never the same, yet always a trusted and faithful companion to guide me through the ages.”
He sounded slightly breathless, and smirking, Harry slipped into his coat and wrapped his scarf around his neck while watching Draco do the same.
He chats with the kids, and Rose tells him about a dream she had earlier this morning, then asks what he thinks it might mean. Harry ponders for a while, then makes up a fantastic interpretation that has Rose happily grinning from ear to ear. Harry delights in the fact that, despite being the smartest almost-six-year-old he knows, Rose still loves it when he tells her fanciful stories about unicorns, dragons, and centaurs. She knows that those creatures are all real, but usually get caught up in the moment, and Harry hopes she’ll keep that childish innocence of hers for a couple more years.
Draco mewled softly and kissing his cheek, Harry moved off the bed and walked the short distance over to the spacious en-suite bathroom that was part of the playroom. He pulled the door open and retrieved a small ceramic bowl, which he’d covered with a Stasis Charm, from the marble top beside the sink.
From there, Draco had, after some thought, drawn his inspiration from the Ars Goetia, one of five antique and anonymous grimoires compiled in the mid-17
Harry doubted he would be successful but highly commended Draco for his efforts to try and control himself.
Feeling devious, Harry made Draco wait for another few moments, then he slowly moved his hand and positioned the steadily melting frozen water sphere so that a few drops of ice-cold water fell onto Draco’s heated skin.
To make matters even worse, Draco had then―quite deliberately―tortured him with a detailed explanation about the merits of offset coils which didn’t squeak. These coils also formed an hourglass-like shape, but notably, the tops and bottoms had flattened edges which created a hinging effect that conformed quite perfectly to the shape of one’s body, resulting in sturdiness, durability, and quiet support.
Draco let him control the speed, and after a while, Harry pulled away from the kiss and inhaled deeply. He pressed his forehead against Draco’s, exhaled slowly and let the sensations of Draco’s strokes travel up the length of his cock into the pit of his groin. From there, they gradually spread into the rest of his body, and he shuddered, trembled and pulled Draco that little bit closer against his body.
At his question, Draco’s jaw dropped, and his silvery-grey eyes sparkled with unshed tears. He gulped and stared, and Harry counted the seconds. He got to ten before he heard Draco’s response.
Harry felt a soft shudder slide down the length of his spine, and taking the coffee mug from Draco, he wrapped his hands around it, brought it up to his lips, inhaled deeply, and gently blowing on it, he took a few small sips and smiled quite contentedly.
Harry chuckled softly to himself, and when Draco raised his eyebrow in a silent question, he merely shrugged and shook his head. Draco rolled his eyes and gave him a judgemental Slytherin look that ignited a faint itch in the centre of Harry’s palm, though he paid it no heed.
Harry himself begins to gather up his own things, makes sure to lock the door to the classroom behind him, and then takes a detour through the castle’s familiar corridors. He stops here and there to exchange a few pleasantries with a some of the paintings, then makes his way to the Great Hall and joins Minerva at the staff table. They amicably chat over lunch, and she makes him an offer, subtly invites him to join the staff and take up a permanent teaching position. Her slyness makes Harry smile into his goblet.
Of course, things were different when Harry tied him up to force him to feel the burn of the ropes as they restrained him and took away his ability to move around freely.
Sure, there were spells that kept sleeves rolled up and collars upright, but the perfection with which Draco’s suits complimented his every move, well, there was no magic for that. This, Harry concluded, was solely down to the utterly incredible skills of Draco’s tailor, no doubt the best one in Britain, France, or perhaps even the entire world.
was regularly visited by a throng of coffee lovers from the local community as well as other districts of London.
At the mention of his favourite chocolates, Draco felt his mouth water, and he hastily swallowed hard. Harry slowly withdrew his hand and produced a small inconspicuous-looking white box. He removed the lid and removed a piece of chocolate, carefully holding between his wet thumb and index finger.
Harry shook his head, and dipping his spoon into the custard, he treated himself to a full mouthful of the delicious creamy dessert, then washed it down with a sip of coffee while Draco finally ate a tiny bit of his chocolate pudding.
Potter’s smug expression was positively irritating and for a moment, Draco seriously contemplated walking away. He even shuffled his feet and made to turn away, but in the end, his curiosity won out, and he couldn’t quite bring himself to do it. He wanted to know why Potter had sought him out and―
The sensation only lasted for several seconds, then it died off, and as Harry pulled his hand away, the bracelet sat snuggly around his wrist. The clasp was gone and, in its place, the precious metal was smooth and shiny. Draco touched it gently with his other hand. As before, the bracelet was warm to the touch. It thrived on his own body heat and the protective charms, Liam had cast upon it, drew their strength from him, negating the need to have them renewed at regular intervals.
Strangely enough, neither Granger nor Harry ever intervened and stopped them from having a go at each other. Although, Harry had promised him, threatening a harsh spanking with a wooden paddle, that drawing wands and challenging each other to a Wizarding Duel would be taking their petty quarrels one step too far. Harry’s guarantee that he would most definitely not enjoy said spanking but cry bitter tears was enough of an incentive for Draco to control himself to the best of his abilities. He couldn’t help but wonder whether Granger had, perhaps, given Ron similar motivation.
Since he rather enjoyed watching Draco, naked or otherwise, it took a fair bit of effort, but he managed to concentrate on the evening that lay ahead instead of fantasising about Draco putting on the clothes Harry had chosen for him.
Draco could think of a few things that piqued his interest more than a photograph of him and Harry dancing together.
As the charm worked its magic, Harry returned to the third floor, and slipping back inside his and Draco’s bedroom, he headed straight for the bathroom, closed the door behind him, and absent-mindedly waved his hand to throw a silencing charm at the door.
Harry let his eyes trail over Draco’s naked torso, drinking in the side of him, then hooked a single finger into one of the belt loops of Draco’s trousers, and pulled him closer. Draco came willingly, responding beautifully to his silent command, and Harry popping the top button, Harry slowly dragged the zipper down.
Without removing his fingers from underneath Draco’s chin, Harry smiled softly, hoping to reassure Draco.
Narrowing his eyes, Harry didn’t even bother to warn Draco, and wandlessly threw a disarming charm against him.
“Malfoy, I can be quite persuasive when I want to be and I will make sure that my wife will not take no for an answer, though how I plan to secure that she’s going to nag Harry until he says yes is something I’d rather keep to myself, if you don’t mind.”
Harry held his gaze for the longest time, then finally threw his head back, and twisting all ten fingers tightly into Draco’s hair, he let his orgasm wash over him and came down Draco’s throat. The swell of come made Draco gag a little, but he bravely swallowed it all down and suckled on Harry’s cock until it began to soften.
The bathroom’s light grey walls and an abundance of natural light, streaming in through the large floor-length windows, created a calming vibe and although he wasn’t on edge, Draco allowed the room to influence him. The oversized freestanding tub―it comfortably fitted four―intrigued him, and taking a step towards the open door, Draco took a closer look and smiled. The shower was positively gigantic and featured two rain showerheads and playful blue penny floor tiles. A large round mirror and linear sconces tied in with the modern elements of the room and provided the perfect place for getting ready in the morning. The wood front of the vanity, which had two basins built into it, along with the wooden stool by the tub brought a kind of warmth to the room that contrasted nicely with the cooler tones in the space.
Right, I'm now going to get off this soapbox and let you get on with this new chapter while I drop dead until tomorrow morning. I'm utterly exhausted.
Eirwen is a Welsh name composed of the elements "Eira" (snow) and "Gwen" (fair, holy, white) hence "Snow White". I found the name fitting, given the description I gave of the woman.
“Absolutely not, Walter. It’s not even six o’clock, you brute. If you’d at least made me some coffee or nipped down to the bakery across the road to get me some fresh croissants, well, I might be more inclined to let you have your way then, but not like that.”
They stood like this for several seconds, then Potter leant closer still, and Draco felt his warm breath ghost over his ear and shivered as a tingle of excitement trickled down his spine.
Racking his fingers through his messy hair, Harry growled into the empty winter garden, and staring at a small and upcoming palm tree, he dropped his arms to his sides and sighed. This endless vortex of emotions was driving him around the bend, and he wished they would just disappear already. They seemed determined to bring him down and although he was trying his hardest not to let him, continuously having to fight them off was exhausting.
Harry followed, and they chased each other around the Manor’s spacious entrance hall, until Draco veered off to the left, pushed a massive set of double doors open and leapt through the narrow gap into the ballroom.
Harry paused for a moment and took another deep breath to handle the onslaught of memories that filled his head, all reminders of the enormous amount of strength Draco had shown and how incredibly supportive he’d been. His chest flooded with a stupendous amount of love for the man he’d asked to marry him and he let it consume him. It flowed freely, coursing through his body with every single beat of his heart. He swallowed past the lump of emotions firmly lodged inside his throat and cleared it with a quiet harrumph.
“Your scruffiness is unbelievably sexy; do you know that, Potter? I love that this five o’clock shadow is slowly turning into this rugged beard. It makes you even more handsome than you already are. I’m fairly certain you know exactly what this facial hair doing to my sanity because you always do, but just in case you didn’t, let me tell you. Every time I look at you, I really just want to drop to my knees and do whatever it is you desire from me. For you, I’d crawl around the house, and I’d curl up at your feet. You make me weak, Potter, so absolutely weak. We both know that you know that, but you should also know that it’s the best feeling in the world. It never takes more than a glance or a subtle touch from you. You really do know how to play the game, you play it so damn well that you own me, mind, body, and soul. I would like to remind you that I am completely and utterly in love with you. I am smitten, and I have been for the longest time. I want to be yours forever, in every way imaginable.”
None of what Caleb had just said made any sense to him. He knew nothing about Muggle pop music, but he rather liked the idea Caleb being jealous over Stefan’s obsession with some famous celebrity. He also liked the thought of Caleb’s teenage daughter being best friends with her father’s boyfriend. It had a certain charm to it and reminded him of his own mother, who was absolutely besotted with Liam.
He was mostly happy and thoroughly satisfied. He just struggled to express that adequately at the moment.
Scorp and Al now shared a room, not only at Hogwarts but also at home. They’d been the driving force behind Draco sitting Harry down to discuss the possibility of all of them moving in together. Right from the start, whenever the kids were at Hogwarts, he and Harry had practically spent as much time together as they possibly could. From there, actually moving in together had been the most sensible choice. Of course, it had taken a while to finalise the logistics, but eventually, Scorp and Al had gotten their wish.
One whispered word was all it took for Harry to fall apart again and lifting his head a little, he looked down at Draco and held his gaze for the longest time.
To date, the foundation was one of his most successful ventures, and he was immensely proud of what he’d achieved. It had taken years of hard work, and he’d managed to do a lot of good, but he was far from done. His goal was to be involved in the drafting of a new law that made Wolfbane Potion available to everyone who needed it. Being part of the Wizengamot’s Potions Committee improved his chances of realising that dream.
“As you wish, but if you’re going to make demands, Malfoy, so will I. Stop bloody moving, or I’ll accidentally tattoo you the Chinese character for ‘silly’ into your tree. Trust me, it’s almost as elaborate as that sigil of yours.”
Draco made another futile attempt at arguing his case, but Harry simply placed a single finger across his lips and silenced him.
Even though he’d tried to be open and carefree, it had been hard and sometimes damn near impossible to accomplish. Still, he didn’t remember Malcolm ever pressuring him to change or to share more about his past. He’d always accepted him for who he was, and ultimately the only thing that had driven a wedge between them had been the fact that Malcolm was married to his job and worked twenty-four hours, seven days a week.
Meanwhile, Harry solicited the help of one of the Court Aurors, and together they accompanied Draco out of the courtroom and back to his office, where Harry thanked the Court Auror for his help, then insisted that Draco lie down on the leather sofa on the far side of his office.
He managed to make out Draco’s very blurry silhouette and instinctively reaching out, Harry felt for his glasses, dragged them off his nightstand and shoved them onto his face.
Meanwhile, I'm off to find a pillow to protect a certain part of myself. It'll be of fuck-all use but I've at least got to try.
Draco’s groans remained continuous but grew muffled as he turned his head and pressed his face into the soft, crisp sheets beneath him. His breathing became heavier, then began to fluctuate as his body convulsed.
However, Draco had informed him that they were just, reasonable, open-minded, and without any bias. All three judges also took their responsibilities seriously and weren’t the sort to be fooled by any attempts to delay trial proceedings. Harry thought that Kingsley had chosen the right people for the job, and he hoped they would ensure that the defence didn’t unnecessarily waste his time.
Draco smiled happily, and when Harry dried him off and offered to carry him out of the bathroom and into bed, he did not object.
Ron set his own tray down as well, then slumped into the armchair across from his wife and stretched his legs out.
Draco hummed his response and placing the half-finished origami swan on the coffee table next to him, he stretched his legs out, then abruptly got to his feet.
He took a few sips from his coffee and watched Ron hand Hermione her plate with chocolate pudding, and it was only after she’d accepted it, that Ron reached for his own.
“Since she was used to me picking her up and throwing her onto the bed or sofa, she didn’t mind when I did it then, except, that time I didn’t throw her onto the bed, I pulled her across my lap, yanked her panties down and spanked her so hard she cried bitter tears. Her arse was gleaming red by the time I was done, and even though we talked about it after, and she reassured me that she’d enjoyed it, that she’d wanted that kind of pain, I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror. All I saw was a monster, someone who’d smacked his wife around and enjoyed it too. I didn’t have a name for it then, but I dropped so fucking bad. I wanted to bloody well end it all. I was a young recruit with the fire brigade, running into burning buildings daily, and a few times I just found myself standing amidst the flames with the structure creaking around me and all I wanted to do was to tear my mask off, breathe in all that poison and die.”
There were bacon rashers and perfectly golden-brown hash browns that looked delightfully crispy ― Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d eaten either one of them. There were lightly sautéed mushrooms, breakfast sausages, baked beans in a sweet-savoury tomato sauce, fried eggs, scrambled eggs, hard-boiled eggs, fresh tomato slices and perfectly-diced cucumber cubes. There was also toast, brown bread, soda bread, whole-wheat bread and a basket with an assortment of bread rolls, croissants and various other pastries, some sweet and some savoury. Next to all the baked goods was a plate with a pile of golden pancakes, and small bowls filled with chocolate spread, and various jams, and marmalade. A cheese platter with an unbelievably rich variety of cheeses, decorated with fresh basil leaves, took up an ample space beside the plate of pancakes.
Harry kept his voice soft and low, prompting Draco to open his eyes. He watched as Draco blinked, struggled to cut through the thick haze in his mind, but eventually found the strength to look at him. His expression was dazed, and Harry could tell that Draco had no idea how much time had gone by since they’d started to play.
“I’m afraid I’ve got to head back to the Ministry, but I’ll speak to Draco tonight, and I’ll let you know what he decides. I’m going to leave the decision up to him; whatever he wants to do, I’ll have his back.”
Shifting his attention back to his coffee, Harry closes his eyes, and brings his nose as close as possible to the steaming hot beverage inside his mug, then inhales deeply. The deep earthy and pungent aroma of dry cinnamon, cardamom, raisins and faint notes of tobacco as well as rich chocolate tones fills his nostrils and smiling contently, Harry finally takes his first sip of coffee. He savours it with the gusto of an avid coffee drinker, which he most definitely is. He slowly opens his eyes to find that Walter has decided to make the kitchen table his new home. He’s wagging his forked tail in excitement, and there’s a bright yellow tennis ball in his mouth.
“Later, Potter, I promise. We’ve got a long weekend coming up, and I intend to use up an entire pot of lube shagging you six ways to Sunday.”
Roísín hesitated for a moment or two, and a slight flush appeared on her cheeks. Draco wasn’t entirely sure whether that was because she was genuinely embarrassed or because the wine was starting to have a bit of effect on her.
so much for all your love and support. You are all absolutely freaking amazing and I don't know what I've done to deserve so much love. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Welcoming the touch, Draco tilted his head slightly to the side and huffed out a breath of air. He felt Harry’s finger slide underneath the rope, that lay exposed at the back of his neck, and curl around it.
The door stood wide open, and Draco respectfully waited for Harry to take the first step over the threshold before he followed him into the room.
Naturally, Draco had shared his feelings with Harry, both in the journal, he kept, and in a private face-to-face conversation. When it came to their relationship, Draco wasn’t in the habit of keeping secrets, and while it hadn’t been the easiest thing to do, he’d taken a deep breath and told Harry how much he wanted to wear his collar. He craved something tangible, something he could see and feel; a piece of jewellery that was a direct representation of the BDSM aspects of their relationship and the fact that he belonged to Harry.
Despite his slow and measured pace, Draco reached the room in no time and raising his hand up; he let his fingers trail over the dark and smooth polished wood of the doorframe and drew out the inevitable for just a moment longer. He was on edge, but he wasn’t afraid, or perhaps he was, but not enough to turn around and run. The fear he felt drew him towards Harry, lured him into his lair, made him crave the absolution Harry could offer him.
The moment he did, two elegantly slanted words, written in red ink, appeared in the centre of the paper:
“These are brilliant. I think I shall leave the sweet shopping up to Scorpius from now on, my son appears to have a knack for that sort of thing.”
The moment Draco felt the elderly man’s wrinkly hand take hold of his, he sensed a sort of intense and almost overwhelming melancholy. Upon lifting his gaze to look at the shop’s owner, Draco noted a kind of deep sadness in his bespectacled chocolate-brown eyes, though it wasn’t sorrow born from a recent trauma but rather something he’d long since acquainted himself with.
a stag?” Draco asked. “One’s animagus form doesn’t change. Not ever. It’s not something that we wizards can control. Our personality and various other inner traits are the deciding factors of that transformation. Though they do say that if you do manage to master the art of transforming yourself into an animal, you’re very likely to take the form of your corporal Patronus.”
