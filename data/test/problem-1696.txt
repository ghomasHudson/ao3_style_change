Blaise was right though because if he wasn't over reacting, clearly someone would say something. He couldn't just up and go and snap at them. They were her family and who was he to judge how they behaved with each other.
Harry must have because apparently it seemed that Harry was utterly mad for him. But there had to be other ways to express love. Why did Harry always have to be so reckless?
Draco opens his mouth and then closes it.
He shot up and screamed "Blinky Slinky." He would request them to stay with them. He would need there help and this time, he would ask Draco's parents and Severus and Remus to visit Draco as well.
"Sorry." Harry replied and looked at his hands. When Draco did not say anything, he looked up to find Draco's stunned eyes on him. "What?"
Scorpius stands up and Albus does too but with a deep sigh. Scorpius wonders if Albus will try again but he doesn't. In fact, he is out of the room before Scorpius has taken even two steps.
Harry sucked his lower lip and whispered "I love you too. And Welcome back."
He looks exactly like his father. Yet the difference between the father and son leaves Harry astounded. Scorpius settles down across from him and places his hand on Harry's. It's warm and comforting.
This being said, she places her hands behind her head and stares at him. This is the moment when he knows that he needs to push himself. He knows that he is on the edge. He has never wanted anyone except this girl in his entire life.
"I do. I understand now. I really want to move on. I want closure. I can not forget everything but I want revenge Harry. I want them punished. I - I want them destroyed. I want them to beg for death. I want to hurt them so much Harry." Draco spoke and his eyes flashed angrily as he looked somewhere beyond Harry's face. Harry just stared. How could a man change so much in the matter of a couple of hours. "- I want to return to Britain. I think it's time I found them and punished them for what they did to me. They took advantage of my helplessness Harry. HOW DARE THEY?" The last three words were hissed and Harry kissed Draco hard.
"She did love you." Says Snape, his eyes kind for once, "She forgave you. Harry is right. She told me."
Draco's breath hitched and he tried to push Harry away. Harry didn't move and held Draco's hands on his. "It is scarred... It is dirty." He spoke and Harry's heart clenched.
"Are you mad at me, uncle Severus? I read that book you gave to me." Harry asks, his face tilted up and his small hand still wrapped around Severus's larger one.
Harry pulls his hair as if frustrated and Draco stands quietly, waiting for his answer.
"What's going on?" Harry asks, attempting to interrupt them.
Draco chooses Potter's dimly lit study for the meeting. Potter has a will of a saint. He makes her feel special. Draco is no longer wary of him. She has started trusted him. She also knows that she can longer spend her time sulking and brooding over what happened. Had it effected only her, it would have been fine but she knows that Potter can't tolerate it. The way he claimed to want to burn the house alongwith them was as frightening as it was beautiful. That someone would care so much for her- she had never imagined to have that someone.
Petunia freezes when a small voice reaches her ears.
and so she wasn't required to comply with him. Not that she had any plans to do so. But she won't back off if she had a chance to kill Lucius even if she had to go through Draco Malfoy to do so.
"Will we go, uncle Severus?" Asks little Harry and this time his wraps his little fingers around Severus's. Severus's staring resolutely at Sirius. He loves the little boy and Sirius loves Severus for his forgiveness. Harry looks a lot like James whom Severus had despised with a passion.
Draco doesn't know what makes her do it but she lays down on Potter's lap. He still doesn't touch her. She wonders if he will hate her once he realizes exactly what she has done.
She wondered why Vernon hadn't called her yet. Usually, by now, he would shout for breakfast. That man had no patience.
It was good that Hermione and Ron had ultimately decided to return. They missed home and they missed Harry. Hermione could teach Dudley and Tessa basics in handling a wand and magic. They would be able to learn more as they mingle with others. Harry explained usage of floo to them. He had told them their floo address and then taken their leave.
"Aurors are ready. I am sending them to the site." Harry nods and apparates to the Burrow, which is of course, 'the site'. Ron and Hermione have somehow convinced Ginny to bring Draco there so that they can terrify him into divorcing Harry and get her married to Harry instead.
She had hurriedly prescribed the medicines and tried to gather as many things as she could get. The scene that greeted her as soon as she apparated inside Harry and Draco's kitchen will haunt her forever. Draco was sitting with Harry's head in his lap, just staring at the her best friend. They were sitting in the pool of blood which was streaming from Harry's wrist. It was apparent that Draco was in shock because he did not look at her when she appeared. He just continued staring at Harry's face. The cuts that were on Draco's wrist did not escape her attention.
Please review
"I mean- you have been so depressed for the past one and a half week. You won't even talk to me. A time came when I just wanted to set this house on fire and kill both of us. Maybe that would bring peace to your soul. If you don't want to live- just tell me. I anyways have no family. Sirius is always busy with Snape and Ron and Hermione have each other. I will set the house on fire and make it look like an accident. Just- just stop this now. I can't bear to see you living as if you are already dead." He is panting and he is desperately trying to calm down.
"I am so disappointed in you Ginny." Ron murmurs and the rest of her family starts expressing their disappointment as well.
"I will if all of you just shut up. "
"But-" Harry starts and Severus shakes his head before saying, "No."
Slowly and cautiously, she heads towards him. A bead of sweat trickles down her cheeks as she stops at a bit of distance from him.
He cast a spell very discreetly to keep their conversation away from prying ears and could not help himself from mumbling very softly "I wish that you would not be so angry Draco."
She stood at her doorway and looked around. There was another door. It was closed and it was between the door of the sitting room and the kitchen. She frowned. Was it another sitting room?
"I'll survive," she simple says, shrugging and it's the truth, "I'll not come back until Ariana has a mate."
"Where is that boy?" She asked cautiously, "Why isn't he here? Why did you cook?"
He stood between them, facing Severus. He couldn't even look at father yet.
He had wasted too much time and now Draco was gone.
Harry simply shrugged and looked into his eyes "You know that I don't like taking help from others."
"Password," the gargoyles said in a robotic voice, making Harriet wonder if they were just robots in disguise. Harriet removed her cloak.
"I would never fight with you again. I hate fighting with you. I would rather make love with you." Harry spoke softly and Draco averted his face away from the git, red.
A second later, he felt Harry beside him, pouring cold water on him. Harry poured buckets and buckets of cold water on him and Draco screamed and shouted and begged him to end Draco but the water did not stop. What felt like hours later, two vials were pressed on his lips and he felt Harry carrying him in his arms. Draco wanted to tell Harry. He wanted to apologise but he couldn't. Before he knew what was even happening, he fell asleep.
Her eyes became very blank for a moment and she licked her lips. He narrowed his eyes. She was definitely hiding something from him.
"Mal- Malfoy, please."
"Hermione
"I am not a virgin anymore. No bloody sheets in the morning." She mutters bluntly, her body still turned away from him. He closes his eyes to control his temper. It won't do to lose his temper in front of her. She isn't well and will take it otherwise.
"Harry, he's our son. You-"
"Go away. You're a freak like your mother. Go away!" She hisses. Of course Snape comes to the child rescue. His eyes flash and he takes a step towards her.
He stands up, having already given up. Black has rubbed off on her. She has suddenly made it her goal to annoy Severus as much as possible for her.
"Okay. Move aside. I'll come over." Snape murmurs and Harry backs off. He blames Malfoy for what he does next. He's on the edge and needs to feed. The moment Snape gets up and dusts the soot off his robes, Harry pushes him against the wall with sure and strong hands. Snape's hands reach automatically for his shoulders. Harry snarls at him, his fangs bared. Harry's hands are on either sides of Snape's shoulders and his eyes are guarded as they gaze into Harry's.
"Of course you would support him. You always did. That was one of the reasons I have never told you anything at all. " Draco said angrily and bitterly and Harry stared.
The weather was pleasant today - neither very hot nor very cold - pleasant enough to keep his windows open. He had already taken his breakfast and Albus was playing outside. Mr Robinson was scheduled to come later today afternoon to start transfiguration with him. It was a normal day and Harry was happy. He was humming a song softly while reading the Aidley file. Later today evening, Mr Aidley would come with Mrs Ainsley to collect it. All in all, Harry was content and was smiling right before someone knocked on his door. Right then, a crow cawed loudly outside his window and very suddenly, it started raining. He stood up, frowning and closed the window.
Harry can't help but wonder if he would have had Malfoy as his partner too is the war hadn't thrown them on opposite sides. However, it's futile to even ponder over it. Malfoy is married and from what Ron said, she doesn't socialize. He will just help Scorpia and continue staying away from the wizarding world. It was that simple and there was no need to complicate it.
"How is it possible Hermione?" He says.
"Say, Malfoy, who is the best among your various trysts?" Asks Flint.
Severus sighs in response and the old habit of his godfather irks Draco. Why can't he just answer?
He did not sleep until much later when he was sure that no nightmares were disturbing Draco.
Rose is training under Draco and so is Teddy. There are a couple of others too. Albus is not on talking terms with them though. He spends half of his time staring at Draco anyways. The other half he spends brewing or taking notes from Rose.
It took four days to wind everything up. Four days which they spent peacefully. Draco was smiling and talking to others and Harry had thought that Draco was finally healing, that perhaps everything would finally be fine and he they would be able to live happily.
She sighs and squeezes his fingers to comfort him before dropping her hand to her side. Her warm eyes meet his, urging him to say something, to do something. The fact that she loves him is not a secret. Harry doesn't love her but he does feel at peace with her. She means stability and security for Harry. Harry trusts her but he'll never be able to love her the way he loves Draco.
"Harry. You are zoning out. You don't have to keep it all inside you and you don't have to return to your home. Just live at ours." She spoke softly and he shook his head "Leave me be, Hermione."
He apparated before she could utter another word.
"I missed you so much Draco. Please come back. Please. I need you so badly. Everything is just so-" Harry's voice broke and Draco felt a lump in his throat. Why was love so strange? Harry's pain hurt him so much "-so empty with you. Everything is over. My duelling career, my life. I don't want anybody except you. I don't desire anything but your presence Draco. Please come back. What is the point of earning money if I don't have you with me?  I am sorry for being immature. I am sorry for not understanding you. I am sorry for not caring enough."
He entered the room and closed the door behind him.
Petunia hiccups and nods.
"How do you know so much about his mind Draco?" The headmaster in question asks her, "Also was it you who had sent that potion to me. It removed the curse from my hand. I always thought that it was Severus."
"Uncle Draco." Tessa's soft voice brought him out of his tortured musings and his eyes shot wide open. Belatedly, he realized that his hands were trembling and were clenched hard enough to bruise his palms. His teeth were gritting and Tessa continued "I did not let him. Magic always helped. Pansy used to encourage him and I hated her so much. She wanted to bind my magic and hurt me. I never understood why."
"I'll not let her take me away from you." Harry says very abruptly. His cheeks turn red subsequently and he lowers his head to stare at his hands, "I heard you talking to uncle Sirius. I'm sorry."
"You don't." Harry replied and his voice broke at the end, though his eyes were completely dry when he looked at Draco. "And I do not know what to do to gain your trust, Draco. I have been trying."
He knows that this is not just going to make everything normal. She is not normal by any standards. Darkness is still lurking in the depth of her eyes. She needs to vent out.
"Maybe, we can do this later. I have some work," Potter said politely and this was the moment Draco reached the door of the great hall. He stood there and watched as Fred laughed before looking at Potter with a smile, "Awww, please, Harriet, let the poor bloke take the pictures."
"Yes, I think so too. I'll stop staring at her," Draco said, noticing that Granger's fist became even tighter.
In the darkness, tears stream down his own eyes as he walks towards his room. As he closes the door and walks towards his bed, he sniffs, not even trying to control the tears now. He wanted to protect her. He wanted her to be happy.
"Draco. Calm down. Calm down. Please Draco." Harry murmured and he kept his voice soft so as not to evoke Draco's fury. But Draco froze very suddenly and spun around, shoving his chest hard. His eyes were furious and utterly tortured and Harry's heart ached but he stood there waiting for Draco to explain. From the corner of his eye, he noticed Ron open his mouth and shook his head to stop him. Ron closed it again.
His eyes- Draco blinks when he stares into those green eyes. Draco remembers that Potter's eyes used to be the most captivating feature of his idiotic self. But now, those eyes are emotionless and face is utterly blank.
"What area is affected?" Granger asked professionally and Draco's cheeks tinged red. Harry answered for him "His hips, inner thighs and legs."
"I am not doing this for you. Just leave me alone." Severus mutters blandly and Black stands up.
Avoiding Harry's eyes, he got up and walked towards the table to have water.
He would have to die. He needed to die so that Harry would move on. He had no right to destroy Harry's life along with his. Harry would be happier with someone who was not so insecure, who could embrace happiness and keep Harry happy as well.
" I want to dwaw a pwictur of both of you." She mumbles and settles down on the floor.
He would mingle with others, starting with Granger and Weasley.
Harry listened to Draco's rant quietly. Draco was right. In the past, he might have shouted back at Draco but he did not say anything, choosing to accept his mistake instead.
His hand fell on his side and he studied the kid. Potter spent the next few moments wiping his eyes although he wasn't making any noise. Voldemort wondered why. Children were generally noisy and whiny. The moment the Potters' car arrived, the kid sniffed and when Lily got out of the car, he smiled widely. He ran towards his mother and got inside the car. The car left after a few moments. Voldemort did not understand.
"The first time, those couple of hulks came in, I had tried to free myself but I couldn't. I had begged them to stop but they didn't. They were too strong and I couldn't throw them off and all the subsequent clients had forced themselves on me. I had always protested. I had wanted them to leave and told them that I would rather die of hunger but they wouldn't leave Harry and would show me money and I was so hungry at times that I couldn't deny but by the end, I protested and begged them to stop, to not fuck me but they did it anyways."
Seated on a plastic chair in a huge reception room, Draco's gaze is alternating between her watch and the door to James Potter's office. Potter's Magic Pin productions is one of the top production houses in wizarding Britain. She loathes his son but from what she has heard, the elder Potter is a good man and Draco is a good actress.
But Harry did not get up. Draco murmured " He is angry with me and will not talk to anyone except me right now. "
"Bloody Hell, Ron. Can I rest in peace for a few hours at least." Harry snaps at the red-head and he glares at Harry, "All right. Suit yourself. I am sure that you don't want to know about the fact that Lucius Malfoy is standing in your sitting room with his wife and Snape."
His voice broke off again when Harry knelt on his knees and started licking the whip marks on his stomach and legs with his tongue.
"Letter after FUCKING LETTER. I asked her not to send any letters but the bloody persistent bitch does not know when to stop." Draco continued in a dangerous voice.
Cool breeze swept in through the gigantic windows and Harriet stirred. She blinked a couple of times before opening her eyes and yawning. It was still dark outside. She still had some time before her classes. She closed her eyes again and turned to the other side.
Harry asked "What do you want?"
"I am thinking-" Harry starts but a scream pauses him. His legs move on their own and he starts walking towards the room the scream came from. After opening the door, he walks in. She is still wearing the robe he had provided to her.
"What is this Draco?" He asks and she walks towards him.
"See if I touch you again Draco." The words escaped Harry's mouth as he stared at the ceiling, laid down on the bed. Draco was on the entryway of the bathroom when he spoke and the blonde froze before replying, "I apologise. You have to understand Harry that I have-"
She waited for Malfoy and Parkinson to go inside. Malfoy, of course, paused and looked at her before heading towards her parents whereas Parkinson only mumbled, "Perverts - the lot of them. I hope Blaise gives them a taste of their own medicine."
"You are not ready yet and it is not a crime Draco. You have just accepted the truth after ten years. You have just told everything to me. You need time and you are my husband, not a sex machine. I love you so much." He whispered, kissing Draco's neck softly and Draco mumbled "I am sorry for –"
"Please, I just want to apologise. Please, can we-"
As odd as it seemed, Harriet was starting to believe Luna. What she didn't understand though was that why Hogwarts was angry.
Draco's trousers tightened uncomfortably when he heard the desire in Harry's voice. He moaned when Harry teased his nipple with the tip of his tongue.
"No Harry. He is right. Ginny would never do so. She loved you, after all." Hermione snapped at them sharply.
His apology broke Harry's heart. His eyes stung and he wiped them but the tears gathered again and then Draco continued, "I will try to do better. I promise. Just- just don't fight with me. I can't handle separation again."
Harry looked at him and shoved his chest "DON'T BLAME HER. I AM YOUR DAMN HUSBAND. NO POWER ON THIS WHOLE EARTH CAN STOP ME FROM ENTERING YOUR PREMISES."
"Oh! So he is yours. You are so presumptuous as to think that my godson will want to belong to someone like you Potter."
But she swallows the lump that is gathering in her throat and serves soup for herself. It's mixed vegetable soup and it's delicious.
But that is not acceptable because it's not just rescuing that Harry wants because as long as Voldemort is alive, he will not stop hurting people Harry loves. Earlier it was his parents and then he tried to kill Sirius and now he has Draco and Harry knows that while they are talking that bastard is... it's unspeakable. He can't bear to think of it.
She glares at Ron and then at Harry and then she purses her lips in a way that tells him that the discussion isn't over. He doesn't understand what she wants to achieve by forcing him to talk to Draco. There is nothing to talk about. Draco is made of lies and Harry doesn't want to have anything to do with him.
He wondered if he had imagined the slight tremor in Draco's hands.
"Let's go." Harry whispered and stood up. Draco smiled and Harry grinned at him, his hand going to ruffle through his untamed hair and then they walked to the sitting room where everyone else had gathered.
"I am your husband. I-" Harry started and Draco cut him off "No. It was a mistake Harry. I should have trusted you. You loved me and would never have cheated. I am-"
It was so sad really. She sacrificed almost her entire childhood as well as youth in the name of saving them and this was what she had in the name of family. A bunch of perverts who were exploiting her or were watching her get exploited.
Draco stared at him, disappointed. Potter was breathing evenly. As if he had felt Draco staring at him, his face turned towards him and their eyes met. Draco had expected - well, he hadn't expected Potter to stare at him as if they were strangers, as if Potter was meeting him for the first time. Draco kept on staring into Potter's green eyes, waiting for something, some kind of reaction. The man had always hated Draco's guts, always challenged him in every field, be it quidditch or duelling. But, there was nothing.
But it came as a blow to him because he should have been there for him when Draco needed him. Instead he had wasted so much time drinking and wallowing in his own misery.
Draco stayed quiet and let Harry pant breathlessly.
Draco laughing with him...
"I want one picture with the twins," he said.
Harry stood inside the kitchen and could imagine Draco preparing his favourite treacle tart so as to make him happy. He had been so careless, he thought as he walked towards his sitting room.
"Sourthern Street, No. 7 Hall 2. Why?" Came Draco's reply and Harry looked into Draco's eyes while he muttered "I have a meeting with a property dealer over there. I am coming with you."
Scorpius literally chokes and gapes at the other man.
"We're in muggle Britain."
. I can't believe it," Harry Potter snorted and then laughed loudly, "What are you - five? I am not going to let you live it down."
Hermione had been prescribing medicines to a patient when Draco's patronus arrived.
"Start now. That will be all. Thank you." Draco murmured kindly and the elves vanished.
"I'll get some tea and snacks for everyone. Let's sit in the living room."
"Hmmm." Harry murmured and for a moment Draco just looked at his sleeping face. He wanted to take the man in his arms and suddenly his arms felt empty but he knew that he couldn't show false dreams to Harry. It would be wrong so he settled for stroking Harry's hair occasionally.
"Save him." These were the only words he whispered. The fact that he trusted her so much formed a lump in her throat because Harry had lost too much blood. The survival chances were very low and she was very much sure that Draco would lose his insanity if Harry died.
"Mr. Potter, I-" The boy starts calmly. He stops and clears his throat before continuing, "I wanted to say that - that sometimes people change with time. Sometimes, you need to take a leap of faith to actually believe that they have changed."
Draco tries to nudge Harry but he won't move. He is glaring daggers at Black and if looks could kill, Black would drop dead.
"Yes, he did, Hermione and I think that Ron and you should be there to listen it." Harry said and Hermione looked at him and then at Draco before turning back to casting the spell on Draco's effected areas and noting something down.
a veela."
"I spoiled Dudley and he treated you as a punching bag and I never bought new things for you Harry and I am so helpless because I can't bring that time back. I see a fear in Tessa's eyes and I had never known why until Vernon spat it out in a fit of arrogance. He told me that he had told Tessa about everything we did to you. I see her eyes burn with shame and anger when she looks at me and when she looks at Dudley as well."
"We have a lot of time. You-" Harry had tried to be brave for Draco but his voice broke in between because he wanted children. Draco spoke softly "I am sorry. I know that you want kids Harry and I am so sorry for not being ready."
"Why are you getting angry at me? Of course I trust you. I - I am sorry. " Draco murmured and Harry tried to control his breathe.
Draco's next words chilled Harry.
Severus's throat feels tight. He blinks his eyes to keep the traitorous tears from falling.
He will bake for kids and have a nice dinner and not think about Draco Malfoy and her beautiful eyes.
He wants to stop thinking rationally. His body wants what it wants. He loves her with his heart and soul. He has wanted her for a long time. But then again, this is only the body of the girl he fell in love with. He wonders if Draco is even alive inside this body. Maybe Riddle took Draco's soul with him. Maybe Harry lost after all, for this victory, in which he doesn't have Draco with him, is empty.
"Professa. Professa. Professa. That's exactly what I am saying Professa Snape."
Harry closed his eyes and an image of Dudley pinning him to the wall and punching him while shouting "Faggot" in front of his friends came behind his eyes and he curled in a ball again.
Sunlight streams inside her room and she opens her eyes, yawning loudly. She had a restless sleep last night. More than once, she felt Potter enter her room and check upon her. She leans against her headboard and presses her knees on her chest before staring out of the window.
between the two and was looking extremely uncomfortable. He stared as Fred leaned forward, said something to the group, laughed and wrapped an arm around Potter's waist and pressed her closer to him before kissing her cheeks. She was dressed in an elegant off-shoulder green gown today. It had a plunging neck line. Her hair was tied in a bun on her head.
Harry was about to speak but Neville beat him to it "Malfoy, look, you should not create a scene over here. We can talk at your place."
"After bathing you, I will return to my lab. They will need some samples to take back so that they can test the potion. I will levitate you to the ground floor and I have got all the rooms cleaned so you can just sleep in one of them if you want." Draco murmured and Harry nodded "Thank you." Before returning to his breakfast.
"Okay." Harry muttered in a heartbeat and then continued "My relatives hated me, you know."
He freezes on the spot when this happens as if she interrupted his train of thought. His eyes flash as he stares at the scars that her body has and his mouth opens as if he is going to snarl. She doesn't cover herself. This moment ... she will never forget this moment.
After all these years, Remus has still not returned.
Harry doesn't know what to do. He can't leave her alone and he can't call anyone over. She won't even meet her godfather or Sirius. Narcissa is out of question.
"Why did you drop my expensive bottle of Vodka?" Harry fumed and stomped towards him.
"Harry." Remus's soft voice reached his ears. Harry knew that he was worried but he couldn't bring himself to care. All he cared about was Draco. A day had passed and Draco had gotten a bit better. But he had not woken up and Harry missed him so much.
She answers his unasked question. Both Dean and Seamus knew. Yet they didn't come forward to tell Harry.
" Locomotor Mortis" Harry cast and Draco screamed   "Protego. Harry stop."
Somehow, he managed to detach his mouth from Draco's and when Draco pressed closer, he shook his head firmly. Draco's eyes were desperate but not from desire or lust. They were desperately terrified.
He kissed the scar and moved on to the faded whip marks that were on Draco's stomach and traced them.
Harry unzipped Draco's trousers and Draco placed his hand on Harry's shoulders. Harry could clearly hear his raging heart beats.
"You don't love me. You are just making excuses. You have lost your love for me." Harry hiccupped even as he said this and Draco clenched his eyes shut as tears leaked them and fell on Harry's shoulders "Of course, I do. I love you enough to let you go." Draco stopped because he couldn't say anything else. His throat was blocked and his heart was heavy and merlin it was impossible to do this, He found strength from somewhere to continue "Go Harry and find someone who is not broken, someone who does not need to suffocate you."
She doesn't know that he would literally do anything she wants. He could spend his life kissing her. He nuzzles her soft cheeks and inhales again.
Sirius nodded and leaned back, his shoulders relaxed. He tried hard to hide his relief but his eyes betrayed him. Draco chose to ignore it though.
Suddenly, they heard sharp and loud barks and Draco blinked on finding that several dogs were running towards them. They were really huge and blood thirsty.
Draco narrowed his eyes, "I still don't need anyone-"
"It's not the first time and I am sure it won't be the last." Draco snapped at the man and crossed his arms.
Petunia's eyes flicker towards Snape who is staring at her with stunned eyes. Belatedly, Petunia realizes that she's crying. Tears are falling from her eyes. She hasn't cried even once since she saw Lily's dead body.
This was the third time when Draco just stared at Harry in utter shock, standing in the middle of the room with the invitation in his hands. It was not Harry's fault because Draco did insult Harry by spying on him. Not even once, did Harry say so. He looked at him with apologetic eyes and Draco finally snapped at him "I am sorry for spying on you. Why are you not asking me to apologise too."
His hands crawled inside Draco's shirt and found the skin of Draco's back. Draco hissed a bit and Harry had to pull back at that. Draco's lips followed him and he chuckled. Draco looked cross for a moment and then his cheeks coloured.
He hands over a bracelet to her. It's a simple bracelet. She puts it on her wrists and stares at him expectantly.
Draco wanted to kill Weasley. He wanted to finish him off so that he would never be able to destroy him again, so that he can never snatch Harry away from him.
"Harry." Black said and Potter's eyes turned towards his godfather.
"What happened?" He asks but she keeps on looking at him.
She shook her head and her eyes welled at that "I am sacred of him."
"Who else knows about this?" Scorpius asks seriously.
Severus rubs his temple and wonders if he will suffer from a constant headache until Harriet has accomplished what he wishes to. Draco could have made all this much simpler by simply using his mind and refusing to get marked. But no, the brat had to make it difficult and Harriet Potter, of all people, had to be the one to fall in love with his godson. Harriet Potter who thinks like a gryffindor and doesn't care about the fact that Draco could very well betray her.
Sirius was almost sure that they had put an act for his benefit but there was no point of speaking it out. the woman had gone mad. Nott had been smart to have backed off at the right time.
Snape, Ron and -"
"Draco, let him go." Severus who had reached him and was standing beside him spoke in a very stern voice. Draco would have snarled at anyone else but one look into Severus's eyes and he knew that Severus would not tolerate no for an answer. Very reluctantly, he pulled back and scowled while the veela took a couple of deep breaths.
The small figure ran towards the room of the master of the house to warn them.
"Draco, we'll be late for our class.
"I am sorry to interrupt all of you but I would like to talk to my son, The great Potions Master, Draco Malfoy." Their was pause after which he continued "It feels great to say it, doesn't it Narcissa?" Draco was shocked and his eyes turned towards Harry who was smiling at him. "Yes it does. I am so proud of him." Mother spoke. Father had never paid due respect to mum and Draco had always disliked this fact. Father must have changed a lot if he was involving mum in his speech like this.
"Harry, wake up. We'll be late. You know Hermione. She'll have our heads."
"Then I shall call Scorpius inside too. I'll wait for you in the sitting room, mom." Albus murmurs and heads towards the door. He doesn't like Blaise Zabini much but then Albus doesn't really like anyone that much. He finds Scorpius seated on the driver's seat, his hands behind his head and his eyes closed.
Finally Harry couldn't take Draco's silence anymore. So he decided to break it by telling a little about his own childhood.
His health had also improved. Draco decided the meals and his diet. His home did not seem empty anymore and he couldn't bear to live without the other man now.
He breathed hard, trying  to ignore Draco's presence behind him. He shrugged off his trousers and left the boxers on.
He nods and she murmurs, "I would go back to my room but I really do have nightmares. They don't let me sleep."
So when he heard Severus's pleased voice, he looked up.
"But Fudge - he was against me and- I thought someone had bribed him and-"
'. Albus pours the contents in the pensieve with a sigh and inserts his head inside the silver memories.
"I overreacted Draco. I didn't mean it. I love you and will wait as long as you want. I know the wounds might take years to heal that is why I suggested visiting Neville." Harry whispered. Draco had still not removed Harry's hand but he was not looking at Harry at all.
Silence followed Draco's statement. Harry sat in front of him with his legs crossed and his hands on his knees. Draco looked at him steadily.
"I do like him." He says quietly.
"Okay. We'll leave then and we'll take James and Lily with us tonight. Talk to her and then tell us. We will figure something out." She says and Harry lets himself smile a little.
"With those eyes of yours, it's not bloody likely and we will have to hide your scar too." Black snaps. Her body is entirely too stiff. Her fingers are tapping almost constantly on the table and her hair are curly today.
"I hate him," Ariana was saying. Harriet frowned, wondering whom Ariana was talking about.
"She is married." He blurts out and looks at the fireplace. Okay maybe, he has had a tiny crush over her ever since Hogwarts and maybe he didn't pursue it because by the time everything settled, she was already engaged to Nott.
Petunia replies, "I'll talk to him. I could never apologize. I was very sorry for what I said to-"
"Ron. Just leave my premises immediately. I want you out. Leave us alone." Harry almost snarled and Draco sighed, relief coursing throughout his body because this meant that Harry loved Draco the most and that was all he needed. He needed Harry's love like air. He couldn't survive without it. He held Harry desperately, trying to get rid of the images Weasley's arrival always brought. He had tried so hard to stay away from his past.
"I think that this is not required," Potter muttered, forcing a smile on her face.
Weasley grunts in reply, "Yeah. It's pretty quiet and secluded."
A few seconds later, he feels someone's presence on the door and looks up to see a sobbing Hermione in Ron's arms. The boy is looking at them, his eyes pained. They are standing at the entryway. Draco's eyes are closed. Her body is shaking with sobs.
"I- I am ready. You are just making excuses. You do not want to touch me because I disgust you, because you know that I was a slut." Draco whispered and Harry looked at him with soft eyes.
"I pushed you yes but then I slept with you and you were hard and you controlled yourself. You didn't even attempt to do anything. You didn't assault me Harry. You didn't know that I was putting upon an act. It was a natural reaction." He whispered and tried to hold his hands but Harry pulled away, muttering, "Don't defend me. What's wrong is wrong."
"Harry please. You deserve better. " Draco spoke and Harry stood up to look inside Draco's eyes. It was clearly written in them that he needed Harry to do this.
"Petunia," he said and she turned her face back towards him.
"You-" she started but he didn't let her.
Having taken three rounds, he stopped and took a sip of water and bent down with his hands on his knees to take deep breaths. After a break of five minutes, he started again but Severus's voice stopped him in his tracks, "I want to talk to you about something."
"You knew?" He asked and Remus sighed heavily, his eyes guilty. "Yes, I did. Your scent was all over him."
"I am not a coward." Draco gritted his teeth angrily and narrowed his eyes and Harry continued bluntly "The Draco asshole Malfoy I had known in Hogwarts would have stopped at nothing to destroy them. You have been hiding here for the past decade like a coward."
Draco placed his hand on Harry's arse and bit Harry's throat. Harry moaned loudly even as Draco apparated them with a murmured "Good night Sirius."
Sub-consciously, he walked towards Draco and Draco walked towards him, his stride hurried. They met in between and Draco suddenly stumbled down on his knees.
"Go and get your ingredients." Draco says and Albus swallows silently before heading towards the closet. All the while he feels Draco eyes burn on his skull.
There it was. This was what Harry had been missing. Draco's eyes burned with fury and he hands clenched into fists.
"Traitors. I will not let anyone live in peace." She snarls
He applies all his strength yet the presence doesn't budge.
"All right then. I forgive you." Draco muttered and Harry stared.
After what felt like hours but were only a few minutes, Draco stopped sobbing and pulled back to look at Harry. Their eyes met and held. Draco's eyes were red rimmed and his lips were trembling a bit and their were a few scars of burn here and there but he was still the most the most beautiful and important man of Harry's life and before he knew, he was leaning forwards to kiss Draco.
"I - I am so sorry Harry. I am so sorry." The voice belonged to his aunt and this time his cup did fall from his hands. He was utterly shocked. As far as he remembered, his aunt never apologised.
"Hello Harry. So all set." Kingsley asks, on his feet the instant Harry stands up.
Draco's skin had healed a lot now. The scars were still there and would go with time but the skin had reformed and it was not red anymore. Harry hoped that Draco's scars would vanish in about a couple of months with the help of Draco's potions and Hermione's ointments though he knew that it might take a long period of time. Hermione had asked him not to give Draco numbing potion anymore. It was not required. He just had to apply burn soothing ointment and coconut oil on Draco's skin and he did it daily.
Draco nodded and Harry averted his eyes, closing them. As Draco hummed, a peace fell upon Harry's mind. He felt Draco covering his body with a blanket and opening his mouth to force a potion. The pain in his leg reduced and he burrowed inside the blanket.
He looked at the ceiling and blinked hard. His eyes were rapidly getting wet and he knew that he must not shed tears, not in front of anyone except Harry. No one should be allowed to see him vulnerable. It was a shock that father or mum had not uttered a word till now.
It had been out of question really. Harry would never let what happened to him happen to another child. He would never be so cruel. Tessa had been quite matured till now but her body was trembling when he hugged her. He wondered why and so still at the entryway, he pulled back, asking softly "What happened? Why are you crying?" Tears were streaming down her eyes and she shook her head quietly.
These things always amazed Harry. Draco was so caring and thoughtful and Harry loved him. He hugged him close to his heart and murmured "I love you."
Mr. Zabini leans back and stares at Albus before starting,"Last I heard, you were dating Scorpius."
Weasley nodded, "And a detective. There are only two detectives. Me and Harry. But we're aurors as well."
"Hermione." Draco whispered and Hermione's wand pointed at him as she snarled, "I am sure you have fed all this crap to him. He would never think so about Ginny."
Presently, they were sitting in the dining room of their house, tired and quiet. It was like the first few days all over again when Draco had not spoken to him at all except for the fact that Draco was nodding and still answering in monosyllables.
Harry knew that he will have to encroach the subject again and wondered how to do it as he walked towards the kitchen when Draco mumbled "I know you want to talk. I am fine now. You can say whatever you wish."
"I think you should ask Lucius about the rest of the tale. He's the right person." Sirius mutters and presses his lips together to suppress his grin. He'll never forget that day.
"So Albus, you wanted to know what happened after Potter caught Draco with Flint and Finnigan. Now that I have sated your curiosity, will you answer
"Are you angry with me?"
"Five."
Snape comes in with the elder Malfoys and addresses Ron, "Leave us alone for a bit."
Father and mother had also arrived and so had Sirius and Remus but he had not spoken to anyone.
Harry stands up and schools his features. He'll have to call Snape to heal Malfoy and take him away. The man's scent is enough to bring Harry to brink of loosing control and Harry knows that Malfoy will either drive him mad or be the reason of his own early demise. He leans against the wall and his fangs come out. He'll have to feed after Snape takes the man away although he had fed just day before yesterday. Damn Malfoy for coming out of nowhere and disturbing his life. Maybe he can convince Snape to let him feed.
Albus looks at her in confusion. How could anyone have known that he would look into dad's memories.
Another five minutes and Albus finds himself standing in front of the Malfoy Manor. It's fortunate that Scorpius is an auror trainee. Things would have been awkward if Scorpius was pursuing his internship under Draco too.
"Okay." she said and tears slipped down her cheeks as she traced random patterns on the table with her first finger. Her shoulders shook as she sobbed and Draco's heart went out to her. He got up and gathered her in his arms. She wrapped her arms around his neck and he stroked her hair. He sighed deeply to control his fury before he apparated in front of the Dursley house.
"Malfoy." He murmurs and her lips tilt upwards in a small smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes. A second passes and then another and then she averts her eyes before apparating, leaving a very startled and confused Harry Potter in her wake. He doesn't remember Malfoy being so stunning in school.
Harry cleared his throat and he realized that Harry was looking at him, his proud cock facing Draco and Draco wanted Harry to- to. It was difficult to express what he wanted from Harry because it was not just sex.
Draco's memories. Now that he has seen a glimpse of Draco's younger self in dad's memories, he wants to know more about him. He wants to see more of him. So he blames his desperation for trying yet again. Of course, the wall throws him out but this time he feels someone enter his own mind. Draco's presence is gentle and soft and Albus's heart beats rapidly because Albus doesn't want Draco to leave. However, Albus can't have the blonde know about his true feelings. Draco has not stopped speaking and he is not even looking at Albus. Albus tries to push him out.
"Yes, I know that you leglimised me while I was asleep. I'm not a fool."
Something akin to fear flashed in Lucius's eyes and he looked at them and spoke in a curt voice, "Do not pull away from him because of me Draco. I do not see James in your husband. He has a lot of Lily in him. Severus is enough to tell you that. I want you to promise me that you won't distance yourself from him to suit anyone else, be that me or your mother."
Whatever Granger said went unheard because Draco's whole world was falling apart around him. What was the use of money when Harry would not be alive to enjoy it with him? In his shock, he forgot that he had decided to let Harry go. He had not known that Harry had been serious when he had spoken of dying.
Harry shuts his mouth and Ron rolls his eyes.
They were happy until Snape appeared out of thin air and told Lily about that freak school.
"You forgot to hide it." Albus replies honestly because it's impossible to lie to dad. Dad always knows when you're lying and he hates being lied to.
"Harry." He whispered. Harry had not spoken to him at all throughout the day.
Harry rolls his eyes before muttering, "I am twenty two dad not ten. I didn't hate her then and I don't hate her now."
"As if it needs to be said. I know that you won't. Okay I will sleep in your room. Just wake me up if you need help." Draco crossed his arms and Harry nodded "Thank you." Before lying on the bed to sleep again "I am sleeping. Good night."
"Do you know what
Harry couldn't let him get away with blaming Harry for everything.
"Think about it Harry." Hermione says and she is completely serious. Her thoughtful eyes are gazing at him and he can't help but wonder if he can do that. He shakes his head to get the thought out and averts his eyes. This is not the first time they are asking this of him.
She shook her head and continued "No, magic helped me. Sometimes when I bathed, he would try to enter, attempting to catch me off-guard. I lived in constant fear that once day I won't be able to protect myself and that he would-"
He had buried his past somewhere deep inside his mind and had not wanted to relive it ever again. But now the memories were escaping bit by bit. He should never have returned to Britain. It was a wrong decision. There was no need to find the culprits. He had lived for the past decade and could live for the next as well. Why had he returned to the place which tortured him?
"You said that-"
"Let's go out for dinner today. " Harry said. They were sitting at the dining table having lunch. Draco had decided to give them another chance and had decided not to leave again. He had started operating from home itself. It was big and spacious enough.
"You did?" Black whispers back, staring at Severus in surprise. Severus stares heavenward, wondering what pranks the child has in store for him.
"Now, Harry.. Just close your eyes and try to sleep." Dudley says and Harry breathes which sends another jolt of pain through his body.
"Do you love him enough to go against your own godfather, to trust him over everyone else, no matter who they are?" Came the question and Harry's eyebrows rose in surprise.
Lucius wonders, appalled to realize that he can't refuse this child.
One could call it anything, good luck or co incidence. Had he been a minute late, he would have lost the only person who kept him sane.
Before Harry could do anything unforgivable, Draco whispered softly "I am tired of fighting." And no his voice did not break and he was not crying. He was NOT raped.
"I would go mad and probably end up in St. Mungos." Harry replied and Draco kissed his nose, murmuring "Well, then it's good because I am never going to leave you."
"Hello, Harry" Fred muttered and as usual George continued "How are you?" while Neville muttered "I think that we must talk. We are already having this discussion ten years late."
She turned to look at Vernon who was reading the newspaper quietly. He was wearing his pyjamas and a shirt and he looked old. His hair was white and his eyes were fixed on the newspaper as if he hadn't even noticed her yet. She knew better, though. His fingers were clutching the newspaper tightly. He knew about her presence. Dudley was sitting across him with a small glass of milk and a plate that had a very small piece of pancake. Petunia stared - it was close to what she gave to Harry for breakfast. Why would Dudley have so little? A plate of pancakes was kept on the table but no-one was having them.
Albus tunes him out and concentrates on his eyes. They are sharp and deep.
"No." The answer came in a quivering voice, "She was fine. The bleeding stopped and her temperature came back to normal."
This was the very first time Harry had lost his patience with Draco. It was not because Draco rejected his advances. More than a decade had passed since Harry took Draco away from that hell and even though they had been separated for a long while, at-least Draco should be comfortable with Harry's kisses, at-least he should be comfortable enough not to hit Harry like this.
Surprised , Lucius nodded. The girl continued " I am completely fine only because of him. I couldn't do magic and I couldn't walk or dance or jump or do anything and the healers said that they did know how to heal me. Dad flooed Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Malfoy told him that he is angry with Britain that Britain hurt him and he can't return back and he will check me up if dad brings me to France. He created a potion and now I am completely fine and normal. "
She stares at him, tears streaming from her eyes again. He wants to cry too but he knows that he has to be strong, that he can't change the past. He knows that he can only help her get over this incident.
"You really think that Ron and Hermione led him there to be raped Harry." Fred spoke, his eyebrows rose and Harry looked at him sharply "I know nothing except what Draco has told me."
"Thank you, father."
He heard a gasp and spun around to find Lucius still standing at the door, staring at Draco's chest. His eyes were so pained that Harry had to avert his eyes. Narcissa applied the ointment gently on Draco's chest and Harry was astonished. Her eyes were wet but her fingers did not stop, not even for a minute. They did not shake or tremble, like he had expected them to.
Ginny hissed at him angrily, "Oh, yeah? Suddenly you are feeling mercy for them or perhaps you want to reconcile with Harry, eh?"
"Potter, you're supposed to be dead." Draco's mouth seems to have a mind of its own.
Sirius turned around and started walking.
Draco nods and stands up, wondering for the hundredth time if she is looking good. She straightens her skirt and runs her trembling fingers through her hair. Only when she is sure that she would not stumble out of sheer nervousness, does she start walking towards the office.
Severus glares at her, "Get out you insolent child and return with your godmother. I have things to do."
"Harry, do you want to change in your night suit. It must be uncomfortable. But none of your clothes are clean. Wear my night suit for tonight. Okay?" He asked and Harry refused saying "I don't like hand me downs. I will sleep in my boxers."
"No- Not sex. But he was living in the manor. He was saving it for the last I guess. Maybe he knew what you felt for me." She completes her sentence.
Severus, Sirius and Remus took his leave and left the party. Others dispersed as well, leaving him alone with Hermione and Ron. Draco had cast a bubble of privacy around them and Harry took a soft drink and sipped it. He had quit alcohol and he was glad that he had.
"No. I want to get it out of my system and there is something else, I want to discuss as well." Draco murmured before sighing "Okay, so I will start now. After the trial..." He started after placing his head on Harry's left thigh and looking at the fireplace.
Harry shakes his head, "Don't. Just go to sleep and don't tell him."
Merlin! This was so difficult. Harry's eyes closed in despair. He wanted children too. He had always wanted them and now Draco had invented a potion years back to make Male pregnancy possible and Harry yearned for kids.
"No. In fact, the first thing we should do is paying a visit to Vernon Dursley. He needs to be thrown in prison." Draco answered and Harry turned to look at him.
"Please enlighten us then as to how can a person be two different people." The girl hisses right back. Draco swallows. She had expected to be offended by Granger's sharp tone. Instead, she is happy that she is not being treated like a bloody damaged person.
"Honestly, shut it. We have to go before he turns Severus mad with his ranting."
"Hey, Malfoy. Wait." Scorpius looks towards his side to find James Potter heading in his direction. He his dressed in dark blue denims and a white shirt and his hair is as messy as Mr. Potter's. Most of the people say that Albus is the one who resembles Mr. Potter the most. However, Scorpius thinks otherwise. James Potter is more like his father then Albus. He's just a bit misunderstood.
"We are done." Harry says, takes a deep breath and continues in a hoarse voice, "You still have my protection but we're done."
"I am leaving. Cool down you bloody bitch."
"Did you have a row yesterday?" Blaise asks quietly, "Something is not right."
This thought just increased his rage.
"You apologised and you never apologise. You always become defensive." Draco replied and Harry shrugged "You were always right. I took you for granted and i would have helped you clean the house, had I been able to."
Mother settles down beside her, on the edge of the bed and Severus settles down on the chair in front of her bed.
So Harry simply hums and bites his tongue to stop the urge to just ask questions. James and Lily open their mouths and it's good that Albus's eyes are turned towards the entryway because Harry shakes his head. They shut their mouths and nod.
"Honestly, Draco, one would think that you were still in sixth year. Stop staring at her," it was Pansy who had said this. He sighed, feeling very unsettled. Maybe he was just over reacting and imagining the look of immense discomfort on Potter's face. It was strange to be back in Hogwarts. The castle was no more cooperative - it sounded so strange to word it like this but this was the truth - than it had been forteen years ago. But, the blast had wiped off half of the wizarding Britain and there was no where else they could live.
He did not look at her while he replied, "No. But I had a feeling. He is still obsessed. I saw something flash in his eyes when I rejected him. He did not say anything but his eyes revealed many things."
"No, Harry, we're not going to visit her." He says sternly. Sirius snickers at him. Severus glares at his husband. Atleast Severus's trying to be stern. If there's anyone Severus has hated more than James Potter, it's Petunia. After Lily's demise, he literally lived in terror that that woman would snatch the child away from him. Sirius's repeated assurances that he's Harry's godfather and that no-one can take Harry's custody from him did nothing to ease his mind.
Why did none of his clients stop to think that he was a human being, that he needed help, that he did not want to sell his body. Why did they never see that he was not submitting himself because it was his work. He was surrendering because he did not have any other option.
Ron teases him, his eyes sparkling mischievously, "Harry people are still terrified of you. But they like you and respect you as well. You should run for minister, you know."
"Yes, Mr. Weasley."
The green eyed menace scowls at him and whirls around.
Lucius stares at Black. They are supposed to be rivals. They are not supposed to have a secret child. They have despised each other for as long as Lucius has known.
Something had shaken Draco up and the man was trying to hide it. No matter what Harry said, Draco won't agree. He would just postpone whatever he planned so Harry decided to tread very carefully. Draco wanted him out of the house for whatever he had planned and so Harry nodded "Okay. Perhaps I will do some shopping. Do you want me to bring something from the grocery."
"I'm sorry." Harry says and students start milling in the corridor, heading towards their classrooms. The first person Harry sees is Draco. His stride is graceful and his face is blank. He looks the epitome of elegance and grace. It's close to impossible to know what he's really thinking.
Then suddenly, she pushes her face in his flat stomach. He stares at her in utter shock, unable to understand what happened so very suddenly.
"Letter. Give it to me." He asked and kreacher shook his head even though he was walking towards him. "It's okay. I will not overreact."
Draco wanted to slap himself. How had he forgotten that Harry would need help? "Wait, I will help you."
"They just got ready. I just brought them over," Vernon said, finally looking at her. His eyes were bloodshot. She stared speechlessly at him. Vernon did not know how to cook.
"Of course not." Petunia answers him because she's not missing her freak of a sister. She's not missing her little tricks and she's not missing the pizza that Lily baked for her and she's most certainly not missing her smile.
Draco looked at him, trying to read him and he knew that his eyes were hard and usually, people flinched from his gaze. He expected Dudley to flinch as well but the man didn't. He looked at Draco with fury in the depths of his eyes and Draco nodded curtly.
Harriet didn't have time to celebrate her godmother's and mentor's marriage. Mom had stopped sobbing. She turned around and walked towards her.
"You – we should have seen a healer. I am such a stupid git. I should have asked you." Harry mumbled, alarmed when he finally noticed the damage. He had removed the concealing charms from his legs too and yes their were scars on his inner thighs as well. It was horrifying, infuriating and saddening that Harry had never bothered to ask Draco about the scars and he had never felt so very guilty in his life.
"Have I told you lately that I love you the most in this whole world?" Harry asked, wrapping his arms around Draco's chest and Draco sighed on Harry's shoulders "No."
He cleared his throat and held Draco's shoulder when he tried to stand "Forgive him please."
"Of course," Draco gave a harsh, derisive laugh, "Why would he come on time? He probably thinks that he's the only one whose time is important."
"Yes, we will. " Lucius murmured and held his wife's hands, his eyes searching for his son.
"I know that you check upon me." Draco mumbled and Harry nodded "I wouldn't expect anything less of you."
"I have not been able to contact him. Even I am wondering about his whereabouts. He is not at his home in France." Remus replied after clearing his throat.
He directs them towards the fireplace. They take a complete minute to notice Scorpia and when they do, they freeze but it lasts only for a minute.
"It's your fault. Admit it." He snarled, struggling to pull out of Draco's hold. Draco looked into his eyes for a few minutes after which he whispered "I admit it. "
However, Severus doesn't answer, not even when Draco huffs. He's not a very patient man.
When dad only crosses his arms and continues staring at him, Albus whispers, "I wanted to know more about Draco."
Ten minutes later, he crawled out of the bed tiredly and apparated to his place.
Father takes a sudden and long breath and so does Albus Dumbledore.
Had he been so self-centred? Why had he never spoken to Draco about it? It was obvious that Draco needed to speak to someone. Burying the memories won't get rid of them. Draco would have to talk about them eventually. Harry knew nothing at all.
The wounds were drying but the skin was burnt off at many places. Most of the skin of Draco's thighs, forearms, complete back was peeling off. Fortunately, his face was safe. Harry knew that Draco won't have been able to bear it if his face had burnt. He must have shielded it and his tummy and chest area. There were burns on those places too, though the skin was not peeling off.
"We would be honoured. Thank You Mr. Weasley." Father finally said and continued, "We would take our leave now. Please owl us if you need any help."
Draco's blood turned cold and he almost dropped the letter on the floor.
"I am sorry. I apologise." Harry said but Draco shook his head. The flicks of his wand that cleaned Harry's house did not go unnoticed and he said "Thank you."
Harry replied easily, "Yes. I do."
"Please have a seat and I will return in a couple of minutes after speaking to my husband." Draco answered and dragged Harry by his hand out of the room.
Sirius looked at both of them in turns, a fake smile grazing his face and lust in his eyes.
"So- some eggs. Baby corn, broccoli, bread. That- that's it." Draco said, a bead of sweat on forehead and Harry noticed that Draco did not ask for coffee. It had finished and Draco had coffee once daily. But he said nothing and just nodded. He would give Draco time to do whatever he wished. What could it be? Perhaps Draco wanted to be alone to mourn or breakdown.
Draco pulled back and with a frown, stood up. He walked towards the open window and stared outside. It was a nice, sunny day outside. With a sigh, he turned around and leaned against the wall beside the window and pushed his hands inside his pockets before looking at Black.
"So, we have to-"
"The other day, Dudley told me that he turned a frog into a flower. He-"
Very slowly Lucius turned around lifted his right hand and placed it in display of everyone. Surprisingly, Harry noticed that he was not wearing any rings at all, not even the Malfoy signet.
"I always lived in a fear. Could never let my guard down. Could never sleep in peace. Could not even bathe in peace. Even at the dining table, he eyed me disturbingly. I want to punish him so much Draco. I hate him. He tried to violate me when I was a baby. Had I been a muggle, he would have succeeded. "
She eyes the vial carefully.
"Harry, I want to go to that ministry function with you. It is day after tomorrow." Draco blurted and Merlin only knew why those words slipped his mouth but they did and Harry yawned "Okay. We are going shopping tomorrow after I have set everything in the duelling academy I want to start. I have no robes at all. I borrowed from Ron whenever I needed them."
"Everything. You are everything, my life, my heart, my everything. You are all I have. You are the one I wake up for and you are the one I want to sleep in the arms of. I would die without you. You think that I would move on, that, that I would forget you. I would go mad and I was on the verge of going mad. I- I am so ashamed of myself, Draco. I am so sorry." Harry's voice broke and his eyes were shining.
"Why would I do that?"
"How did you fall, Harry?" Draco asked again and Harry turned away from the blonde facing the other side and did not answer. "Harry." Draco insisted and he replied softly "I was drunk and stumbled."
"He's right, Ms Brown," Dumbledore said calmly, as if they weren't trapped in the castle, "I would like to request all of you to keep a watch on your kids and stay inside the castle. At this point, I cannot guarantee that you would be able to return to Hogwarts if you go out since I do not know if our stay in this dimension is temporary or permanent."
Harry could not control himself from hugging Draco tightly and wrapping his legs around Draco's waist.
"Okay. If you don't know the address, take it from Severus." Draco murmured and without listening another word the man said, he walked away although he couldn't help but hear a softly whispered, "Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. Thank you so-"
Draco saying that Harry was enough for him to live...
Harry smiles on seeing Draco's smile. He has waited long for it.
"I did- I didn't even touch her. I didn't enter her room except to give her food. Take her away from my home. She keeps on wreaking havoc all over. Take the menace away. That's all I want." She whimpers pathetically and Severus storms inside, heading straight towards Harriet's room. He will have to get accustomed to call her by her first name if he must raise her.
She wishes she could comfort him but she can't.
"You have two minutes." He says and she nods before casting a privacy charm on his door. It surprises him and he raises his eyebrows, his hands folded in front of him.
"Say something Albus." Mr. Zabini leans forward and joins his hands before muttering.
Lucius froze and he noticed Remus freeze and turn his face to look at Lucius as well.
"The nest." He almost shouted and flooed over. Without waiting for a second longer, he shouted "DRACO. ARE YOU HOME?"
"Why?" Draco asks as Severus settles down on the edge starts dressing Draco's wounds. Something's wrong. Draco knows that it is. Why'll Potter stay away from his family, his kid and his best friends, not to mention his godfather.
Harry hugged him tightly and he went willingly in his arms. That was the moment when he heard a strong voice murmur "Draco, I know that you still feel that we are ashamed of you. We know that it is the reason that you can not even look at us." The voice belonged to his father. Mother continued "Draco, my child, we love you and we know what you are going through. We are proud of you."
He hears Lily's and James's dramatic gasps of surprise and feels proud of them. He hears Albus squeak when they tease him relentlessly. He was unable to get rid of Voldemort on time which cost people their loved ones. But atleast he raised his children well.
His eyes were very stern as he said, "You'll come back once you have freed James. You
"HOW DARE YOU JUST BURST IN MY MEETING LIKE THIS?" He shouted and glared at the green eyed man "WHY DID EMILY ALLOW YOU TO ENTER WHEN I HAD SPECIFICALLY ORDERED HER NOT TO DISTURB ME." He looked at the door and shouted at the top of his voice " EMILY. EMILY."
Harry stands quietly and looks at Draco, his arms crossed and his eyes sad. A few minutes later when Draco has finally gotten over the shock, he gets up from the bed too and stands in front of Harry.
"I - I am lost," Draco stammered and cursed himself because Malfoys don't stammer.
Harry sighed in relief and smiled, turning back to look at Draco, who had out on his shirt now "Okay." He blew a kiss and enjoyed it when Draco's cheeks tinged pink. Draco glared weakly at him murmuring "Stupid Potter."
"Oh," The man said, "And you are?"
"Yes, he came inside my room and the bucket full of water fell on his head. He was wet and startled and cute. It was so funny."
Resisting the urge to slam his head in the wall because how was he supposed to live in this castle with Potter for an indefinite future without going utterly mad. She was utterly infuriating. He washed his hands and walked out of the bathroom and found himself standing in front of a bespectacled man with a scar on his forehead and brilliant green eyes. It was so obvious that he was a Potter but that was impossible because Potters had a daughter and she had replaced her glasses with contacts just before her marriage.
It was Voldemort's turn to frown.
"Does it burn?" Harry asked and Draco whimpered. Harry could swear he did. A minute later, a soft reply came "Yes. Sometimes, it does." And Harry kissed it softly.
How were they innocent? Why did they not deserve to be thrown behind bars? Was it not - not- not-
"Where. Is. Harry?" she asked slowly, looking deep into her son's eyes.
"You will stay in the Prince Manor. Black and I will live with you and I'll tell you that I am your deceased mother's friend. If we ever venture out of the manor together, I will disillusion myself. I have chosen Prince Manor because it's near Wiltshire and no-one knows about it except myself. You will stay with the Dursleys for three days atmost. I'll come to pick you up. That will give you more than two weeks to convince Draco."
"He looks so terrified and I am so worried for him Professor." Harry spoke and Severus shook his head, placing his hands on the table "He is not scared of anyone. Call me Severus by the way. On another note let me tell you that Draco is not scared. Draco has become very short tempered with years. You have not seen it because he had been at home for the past few weeks. Soon enough he will get an invitation from a business house or French ministry or perhaps some rich entrepreneur wanting to sell his potions and then you will know."
Lucius smiled and asked "Yes. Serene how are you?"
He had never felt so guilty in his life. How was he any different from those men who had violated Draco?
Draco stared at him and just stared "I need to go for a meeting with the coven of Werewolfs from Canada. I have been trying brew a potion which might help them keep their human bodies during the full moon, if they so desire. I have to discuss whether they are interested." He spoke in a rush.
"Put her down Lucius." The vicious growl that escapes Severus's mouth stuns him. He stares at his friend in shock.
"But Harry, it could be a mistake." Hermione whispered, his voice trembling and Draco sympathised with them. He was wondering how Harry could stay so controlled. It was difficult for Draco to digest the truth because Sirius was a Black and technically is his extended family. Harry should be devastated. Sirius was his godfather after all and most likely, there suspicions were correct.
Black chuckled and met his eyes.
Everything around him was spinning and he felt everything slipping from his hands.
Hermione was alarmed and so was Ron and he knew that they were waiting. Finally, Hermione's patience wore thin and she asked softly "We can just leave if you need time Draco. You must not force yourself." Ron agreed with her murmuring "Draco, we can meet them after a few days. They just wish you well. They would hate it if you hurt yourself any more." Hermione held Harry's hand and Harry's thundering heart calmed down a bit.
"He doesn't-"
Now, if it had been a junior trainee or a junior auror, Draco would have accepted his words but it was Potter who had been fighting dark wizards ever since he was eleven. Potter and Weasley were senior aurors.
"I can not even HAVE SEX WITH YOU. I AM BROKEN AND-"
It is going to be a difficult day and he wishes that they come unscathed at the end of it and that they can finally get them imprisoned.
"Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger and Ginevra Weasley." He answered and the silence was deafening. It happened too fast.
"Hand- me- what? I am your husband. My clothes are not hand me downs." Draco answered, totally stunned. He wondered about the reason of such a strong reaction from Harry. He also wondered why he felt so good when he called Harry his husband. He had wanted to end their marriage after all and it would be better for Harry if he found someone else.
"I'll never understand why
"It's potions master Malfoy for you, Albus." That someone else is Scorpius who is looking very disheveled right now. With his piercing silver eyes, a good height and lean, strong body, he looks like a carbon copy of Draco.
"Okay, my lady." One of the guards whispered and after another low bow, they marched off towards her brothers's rooms. She hurried towards the hall. The castle was huge and the great hall was on the ground floor. There were anti-apparition wards inside so of course, she had to walk. With quick steps, she descended the stairs. Lamps were lit all over and there was no-one around except the guards and a few maids.
She had her hands on her face now, sobbing uncontrollably and Harry did not know why he felt mercy in his heart for this woman. She had never loved him. She had ridiculed him, starved him, given him chores, repressed his magic, scolded him. She had never spoken softly to him. She had never hugged him when he had a nightmare. Why, then he knelt in front of her took her sobbing, trembling body in his arms?
"But-" Hermione started and Ron dismissed her "Forget it. I am going to Harry's place."
"They paid me before going. I was not raped." He mumbled and Granger sobbed. Harry did not sob but his face was resting on Draco's shoulders and Draco's shirt was wet so he was crying too. "I was not raped. They did not rape me." He repeated in a small voice. He was not crying and he was not raped.
Albus swallows nervously and feels awkward. Mr. Zabini is Scorpius's godfather.
Draco is amazed when father breaks the wand while looking into the dark lord's eyes.
"Well, I can't. I need you to protect me. I am afraid that this person would abduct me. Are you saying that you don't want to protect me? Say it bluntly." Harry spoke, trying to sound genuine. Of course Draco saw through him and spoke "You are lying. You do not need my protection at all. You just want to protect me."
With a sigh, he entered his room and sat on his bed, looking at Draco's face blankly. His eyes were closed and his lips were dry. Harry picked up the water bottle and placed it on Draco's lips and then he stroked Draco's throat a bit. After that he went back to staring at Draco, his head resting on his pillow. He had done nothing to search for properties for his academy. He could always retrieve money from the vaults if he wanted money. The duelling and potions academy would open only when Draco would participate in it. There was no point of earning money if Draco was not there to spend it.
"They led you to that hotel and you were raped. I want to punish them. " Harry whispered and it was like there was no one except them. Draco sat looking on his lap and whispered very softly "I was not raped. I wasn't" His throat burned and his eyes burned and now the twins and Longbottom were sitting in front of him but he vehemently denied "I was not raped. I provided them a service and they paid."
"Hermione, leave him alone, all right." Ron mutters in a low voice, "Stop nagging him."
"Bloody hell Draco, will you listen to yourself? Why do you keep on implying that Sex is the only thing you are good at? Why can't you see that you do not need to resort to sex to keep me happy? In the past I might have ignored it so as not to scare you off but I can see that we need to talk about this. If you don't trust me yet, it's completely fine. YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE SEX WITH ME TO KEEP ME WITH YOU. I am completely happy without it. I am living with you because I love you, your soul and heart not just your body. " Harry said and Draco was looking so small that his heart clenched " Whatever you are hiding is eating you up. Just tell me. I am not going to judge you or be angry at you. And why do you start crying? It's like you are terrified, Draco and I hate it. I hate seeing you weak. I hate it that you have to seduce me to please me. I hate it that you have an inferiority complex. I love you so much and I hate to see you in pain, pain that you hide from me."
"Shut up." Draco repeated and Harry mocked him again "Make me."
Snape pulls back and Harry breathes deeply before looking at his godfather and then at Snape, "We can do this, can't we?"
But they still have a long way to go.
The first thing he would do will be seeing a healer with Draco. Rest would come afterwards.
Black chuckle and it was my no means a happy laugh. It was bitter and sad.
He had not realized that he was crying until the bitter tears slipped inside his mouth. Was this what he had needed? A closure. An acceptance from the only blood relatives he had.
Everything came back and the memories compelled him to puke or to just die so that they would stop. In his time as a prostitute, he had met several other prostitutes as well. Some of them did it willingly and some of the others did it unwillingly but had expected their fate. They took a client willingly but Draco had never accepted it.
Draco shook his head and Harry said the only thing that came in his mind "I will drink again. Remember to take out a little time from your busy schedule to attend my funeral."
"Why?" Albus asks before he can stop himself and it's a mistake because dad's eyes snap at him and they are shining with rage.
"All right." Albus snaps, "I'll go alone then."
He had been prepared for this but nothing could prepare him for this- this need to make love to Draco and he had not realized that he had closed his eyes.
Severus leans back against the chair, looking quietly at her. He eyes are pained, worried. She still looks at him like she's carrying a burden on her shoulders. He wonders if that will ever change or if she is destined to always fight. He would blame fate for making Draco her mate if he didn't know that fate was not to be blamed in this case.
Currently, they were sitting in the dining room, having lunch silently. Harry broke the silence between them "I was thinking that perhaps we could go and look at the properties around for the academy and you can perhaps set up the shop near it. It would become easy for you."
It's Sunday and Lucius deserves a holiday and one child is quite enough, thank you very much so when he opens the door and finds Severus and Black standing in front of him with blank faces and little Harry's green eyes peaking at him from behind Severus's legs, he sighs.
"Let's go." James murmurs and Scorpius smiles at the nervous man. James runs a hand through his hair and messes them even more than they already were.
" Harry, you have made us late. Must you be so lazy all the time. " He heard his son snap at Potter in the voice he had often used at Hogwarts with the greed eyed boy and he felt his lips upturn in a smile. He did not seem as haunted as he was earlier.  "I am sorry, you great git. But it was you who wanted me to look perfect. " " You always look perfect. "
"It is not about sex. Just because we are not sleeping together, it doesn't mean that I don't love you or I am going to leave you. There is absolutely no way to make you believe that I love you Draco, not after what I did yesterday."
No. Was he interfering in her life. No. He was minding his own business. He was being decent and leaving her to own devices and had expected her to do the same. He whirled around and stopped, crossing his arms on his chest. The sound of her footsteps stopped.
He had not been able to walk and Draco had woken up in the middle of the night to take him to loo or give him water or apply ointment on his swollen ankles.
He had said all that bullshit in the heat of the moment.
So here he was at The International Apparition station in Britain. They had arrived five minutes back and Draco was nervous. The crowd had automatically rushed to meet him and Harry had been pushed at a distance from him
"I want you to make love to me and I want children, Harry, our children." Draco whispered, looking with anxious eyes at him. Harry was so shocked that his jaw fell open and his eyes shot wide open at Draco's statement. He could do nothing except open and close his mouth like a fish for a couple of minutes.
"You see, little Malfoy, I blackmailed Shacklebolt who was a judge at that time to banish you out of this country. But then Harry just had to follow you." She mocks, settling down a chair, her legs stretched in front of her.
Skeeter stares at him, her eyes wide with disbelief before whispering, "So you're saying that you deflected from you-know-who's cause because little Harry Potter is fond of the white peacocks and gardens of the Malfoy manor?"
"Talking about it will-"
"You hid it from me - from us - your ability to do magic," Vernon said sharply. He had lost a lot of weight and would look handsome if his face wasn't as pale and sick looking as Dudley's.
He approaches her slowly so that she can back off if she wants. Very gently, he cups her cheeks. He moves closer to her face and takes in her delicious scent.
His arms and thighs are muscled and his stomach is flat. His robes are placed on a small chair in the corner of the room and he is dressed in a white shirt and black trousers. He's still and his eyes are fixed on Draco.
If it weren't for Draco, he would be lost in this large castle full of strange faces and unending noise. He doesn't want to stay here. He is staying because he wants to create a world in which Draco is free and Harry can perhaps live happily with the only person he has ever loved.
"I am also sorry for what dad did and what grandfather-. Although grandfather is still bad, my daddy has changed a lot. He hates violence and he is sorry." Harry's eyes turned towards little Tessa. She was looking at him warmly and perhaps her innocent eyes did the trick. He hugged the girl and murmured "I forgive your daddy and I will never punish you for what he did."
That catches Harry's attention. His eyebrows rise in surprise before he asks, "Why would you do that?"
He had never felt so frustrated in his life.
Draco muttered, "If this turns into a huge disaster, I'm blaming you."
Harry did not retaliate even once. He was busy staring in Draco's eyes. They were not angry. They were full of pain that Harry did not understand.
"She's calling Blaise." Albus replies politely.
"What gave you the idea that you
"Professor-"
He wanted to kill all these people.
Harry stopped at that and Draco just stared, his hands clenched and his heart in his throat. Harry crawled out of the bed and looked blankly at the ceiling before looking at him again, his eyes unreadable, "You just don't care about me. I do not even know you anymore, Draco."
"Life is long and you are too young to claim that you'll never be well. One day this will be a distant memory and we'll be happy." He murmurs sadly at her. It's odd how her pain causes pain to him too.
Harry stared at him "What are you-" He never got complete his sentence because Draco punched him straight on his nose.
"You can't." This voice was much smaller. It belonged to William, her little brother. She turned around and he ran towards her. Jameson followed him with gritted teeth and angry eyes.
Harry stood up and so did Draco. They pressed a kiss on her head and her cheeks tinged pink before she smiled beautifully at them.
"What is it?" Harry asked and was astonished when she sat down beside Draco and took the burn soothing ointment from his bed side. It was time for applying it and Harry had decided to do it after Lucius and Narcissa would leave. She removed the blanket from Draco's chest and closed her eyes, murmuring "Sweet Merlin, Draco. You must be in so much pain."
"Have you started donating blood too, Draco? Is that why she is bent as if trying to bite your wrist." He sneered and Draco glared at him angrily "Get out Potter before I make you. I am having a meeting and it's much more important than your useless tantrums."
If this bastard thought that he would go unpunished then he was sorely mistaken. He clenched his fist and glared at the fireplace angrily.
"Ron runs a chain of bakeries now and Harry has changed a lot. " The man said and leaned back on his chair, "Actually, Harry meets your requirements."
"It's no fun without you." Harry muttered.
It took only five minutes to reach the park. It was beautiful and quite large with jogging grounds and swings for children and ample of space for working out. After doing a few stretching exercises, he started jogging and while he jogged, he looked back on the past. If there was one good decision that father took, it was making Severus his godfather. After leaving
He received no response to that and yelled again "I am sure you don't need my protection now that you are angry with me."
However, Mr. Zabini starts pushing Albus towards the door while muttering, "Ask him then. Don't ask me. I refuse to do this again and I'll have a word with Pansy as well. Don't visit her. She is not as forgiving as I am."
Albus shifts the photo towards left and unlocks the door with a simple alohomora. He enters inside. The room is untouched and dust has settled on the furniture. It seems that dad hasn't cleaned it for a long time. The memories are arranged date wise on the shelves. There are a very few vials and other than the memories, there are some ancient tomes that dad must have wanted to keep away from Albus and his siblings. He picks up the memory of the day following the night dad caught Draco red-handed.
Blinky popped out of nowhere and murmured, "Blinky will check the door, Masters." and then disappeared again.
When he had been little, he had dreamt that his relatives will be proud of him someday and it was as if a dream had come true.
Draco would have laughed aloud but all of a sudden, he was feeling an urge to clean his body thoroughly. He was feeling filth and grime all over himself and he answered bitterly "Just mind your own business, will you?"
Soon enough, they will return and she will destroy Malfoy all over again.
"I have been trying to gain your trust. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to write in my blood that I love you, that I won't leave you, no matter what happens." Harry continued and Draco blinked hard.
Severus wonders if the father is one of the Weasley brothers. Potter is still on talking terms with Granger and Weasley. However, their friendship is not even close to what it was then. No-one knows who the father of Potter's kids is. She had left Britain shortly after the war and then had returned a few years later with three kids.
"I don't care about Pansy and Tessa is a little girl and we need to protect her." Draco lied because he did care. She was his friend.
"He will, once he realizes what I can offer to him." Harry cuts Hermione.
"Hey, give it here." Harry glared at Blaise who only raised an eyebrow in response.
"Yourhandsdontfeeldisgusting." She mumbles incoherently and Harry closes his mouth. This is nice and if he can help her in any way, then he is glad.
Presently, Harry was in the library reading some books on duelling and Draco was in his room napping before lunch. He was glad that Harry had decided to open his own Duelling academy.
Harry couldn't control himself from hissing, "It's natural to know instantly that you need distance. It's not natural to pounce upon you when you are vulnerable and want me to understand. It's most certainly not natural to blame you of all those horrible things. Marriage is not about sex and just because we are married, I don't own you. Engrave these words in your mind. Why don't you bloody understand? "
"How can I help you?" The man -father said, his eyes narrowed sharply. Of course, he was noticing their resemblance now. After all, Draco looked a lot like his father.
It's Potter's turn to laugh as the dark Lord stares at him, his eyes holding fear.
"I won't have you imprisoned for-"
He looked towards Draco and asked softly "Why are you not saying anything?" He asked and Draco whispered "I do not want revenge. I do not want any of you to take any such step. I want Fred George and Longbottom to return to Britain and behave as if they do not know anything. I do not want anything investigated."
"I don't want you to go." Mom whispered, "I can't ask you to do this."
Harry just nodded. He couldn't speak yet. He couldn't cry until Hermione left. He couldn't. He was not weak. She left and closed the door behind her and Harry stared at Draco's unconscious body.
Everyone froze and he glared at Granger spitefully "You want to talk to me about Potter. Let us talk in the 'boy who lived to be the bane of my existence's' presence, eh? Perhaps that would force you to stop interfering in my life."
The dark lord snarls, "You traitors. You will regret this. the dark lord will show no mercy. I-"
"This is an invisibility cloak. Keep it. In case you are stuck somewhere, use it." He says and continues after looking towards the door, "I will end it today Draco. I will kill him and you will be avenged. The war has broken out. There are death eaters and aurors all over this manor. The war has broken out at Hogwarts too so don't go over there yet. Don't try to help anyone."
"You're the boss. Whatever you say." Potter said blankly, "I'm an auror. You're supposed to give us orders, not ask for our opinions."
Ron kneels down beside Harry's bed and places his hands on Harry's shoulders.
"I will call a couple of house elves from The Malfoy Manor to clean the washrooms. I could call them to clean the complete house if you like." Draco spoke and Harry denied "No. I would rather we do it ourselves so that we can throw the useless things away and so that we can change the furniture that we do not like. They can do the bathrooms though."
"Where's he?" He says. Petunia finds herself at a loss of words. She stares speechlessly at little Harry Potter.
"Up Up" The tiny girl mumbles and Lucius stares at her. Never in his life has any child except Draco asked him to pick them up.
He placed the tray on the table and sat beside him. This surprised Draco. In the past, Harry used to sit across him.
Ten minutes later, Harry found himself sitting cross legged on a couch with Draco's head on his lap. Lucius was sitting with Narcissa across them. Narcissa was lost in her thoughts and Lucius was staring at the fire, pointedly looking away from them. Remus, Severus, Hermione and Ron were also sitting on different couches in the room.
"I can't let father die." Harriet said, "I'll bring him back. I have to do this."
Experimentally, he stroked Draco's hips from his pyjamas and Draco's breathe hitched.
Mr. Zabini gapes at Albus. His jaw hangs open in shock. His eyes are wide and his entire frame has frozen.
"I thought that I would just ignore him and I tried but you would bring them to our house. I did not want to tell you. I thought – thought that you would leave me. Then we broke up and when I came back, you were - are a changed man. You are a changed man and now they are interfering again. YESSSSS." Harry jumped in surprise because it seemed that Draco had just spoken parsle tongue. He did not have any time to ask because Draco spun around and walked towards Ron, looking wild and mad. Before Harry could do anything, he had his hands around Ron's neck and he was shouting at the top of his voice "I will kill him and finish it, once for all. I won't let him destroy my life again. "
"Ron, please." Hermione snaps impatiently at her husband who rolls his eyes before walking towards a sofa and sitting on it.
"Enjoy the party."
"It is what it is. I can't live without you. I am going to tell you my secret. This is something that i did not tell anyone. Not even Hermione and Ron. " Harry's eyez were distant as he continued "Their is a reason I don't like anyone entering the shower when I am inside, not even you. At hogwarts, I used to bathe early morning. I was seven and had started bathing by myself but I kept the door unlocked so that I could call someone if needed. One day I was taking bath when Vernon entered inside. I asked him the reason but he simply smiled and said that he wanted to help me bathe. I agreed since I was small and wanted my relatives to love me. He started rubbing soap on my chest and pinched my nipples. I- I thought it was by mistake and did not object. He bent and kissed both of them.  I still did not object though I was alarmed.  Then the bastard started rubbing soap on my hips and reached between them. He started applying the soap on my anus, rubbing hard and I asked him why was he rubbing hard but he said that he was cleaning me. I was afraid but thought that perhaps I was overeacting but then he inserted a finger inside it. I-"
He buried his nose in the crook of his neck and started sniffing and Harry still did not understand the reason of this action.
"Why, Potter, of course, despite being scrawny. Although Wood certainly rivals him."
Harry replied in a soft voice "Do I need a reason to take my husband out?"
"She refused to wear anything else... asked me to go away and just let her sleep once I was done checking her."
When she finishes she shows a picture of two figures to them who most certainly don't resemble them. Yet the picture seems so beautiful that Severus pins it on the bulletin board in his drawing room, feeling oddly proud of the beaming five year old. Meanwhile Black stares at her goddaughter with damp eyes. Severus understands and knows that there are no words to sooth the woman's guilt or pain.
He nodded, grinning "Yes. I think you must move from here. I think she does not like living here." and Dudley agreed "Yes. I am sure."
"He is," Harry said, feeling almost petulant.
Harry looks into Snape's eyes and murmurs, "You have to understand. I can't lose another second. I don't have even a single minute to waste."
He doesn't have to turn around to see that the soft gasp belongs to Scorpia. Maybe Hermione will make some sense out of this. He wonders why they never told him about this. He turns towards the fireplace and throws the floo powder in the fire.
Three days had passed and Harry had done nothing except bathe, eat and look at Draco's unconscious face. He barely slept now and there were bags under his eyes. The elfs forced him to eat and so he did it. Everything seemed a chore. He wandered in his house alone. Multiple times, he found himself wishing for portraits to talk to. His silent house was eating him up and he found himself missing the banter he used to have with Draco back at Hogwarts when he would mock Draco and Draco would mock him back.
At once he gravitates towards her swollen lips but she murmurs, "I would be lying to you if I say that it helped. One good thing this kiss did was to ensure me that you love me. I won't stop you if you continue, for I was the one who provoked you but I won't enjoy any of it, not even a bit."
He pulls back and Sirius's hands fall from his shoulders.
Albus is doing his internship under Draco. Maybe he should try legilimency on Draco as well. He did it with dad and dad didn't even notice. Granted dad was asleep when Albus sneaked inside dad's mind and he is not an expert in occlumency. It's worth a try.
"Please, don't go." William whispered and Harriet hugged him tightly, "I need to go but I'll be back. Don't worry."
Potter crashes into him with an ooof. Draco wraps his hands around the girl's forearm to prevent himself from falling on the ground.
He mustered all the strength he could to shout "EXPECTO PATRONUM" and the his lion patronus growled at him before running away to intimate Granger about it.
"There's no point of asking you to stay away from Malfoy, is there." Mom says and it's not really a question. It's a statement.
Draco asking him if they could adopt a child...
"That's none of your business." He snaps because it really is not.
"I did, god damnit. I searched everywhere and by the time I succeeded, Potter had found him and they seemed happy." Severus's voice was furious and Draco had never seen him so angry.
"What are you doing Harry?"
"Right pocket." Harry muttered and leaned against the wall so that he won't fall down.
"Go and consume this- this poison, for all I care. Go to fucking hell. Just leave me fucking alone and keep your fucking minions on a fucking leash." Draco yelled at him and Harry sneered back "They are my friends. I won't ask them to stay away."
"Hello, mini Draco." Zabini grumbles. Scorpius stares at him. This is the first time Zabini has spoken directly with him. Zabini always avoids talking to Scorpius.
"Should I bring breakfast here?" Draco asked, changing the topic completely and Harry spoke "I have to bathe."
Draco's eyes narrowed. What was Black trying to tell him. Potter shouldn't be told about this. He should be asked whether he wanted to work with Draco. He most certainly would throw a tantrum on finding out that Draco was his new partner. But Draco didn't say any of this.
He had fallen in love with the way Draco crawled in his arms when he thought that Harry was asleep or kissed him after Harry closed his eyes. Sometimes, Harry faked sleeping to get that sweet goodnight kiss.
Fred backed off, raising his hands in surrender, murmuring, "Sorry. Sorry. It was a friendly kiss only, dear sis-in-law."
Harry cuts him off. "But removing memories won't help me forget it."
Draco returned a few minutes later and scent of his shampoo was all around Harry. The urge to take him in his arms and breath in his neck was so strong that Harry had turn his back towards Draco and clench his hands into fists.
She shook her head with a softly muttered, "I can't ask this of them. They just got engaged and have already set a date for their marriage."
"Where are we?" Corner asks Weasley.
In the matter of seconds Harry finds himself picked up in huge arms and taken inside the car. The speed at which Uncle Vernon drives off is practically startling. Harry is in so much pain that he can't understand even his words.
He had always hated hospitals and did not feel any change in his feelings.
He must have been quiet for long because Harry looked at him and said "Say something."
The black haired irritating slytherin woman sitting on the couch muttered "If we get caught, they will not leave us alive. Together, they are a force to be reckoned with."
Harry came out of his shocked stupor when Draco walked forward to strangle Ron. He hurried towards the blonde and wrapped his arms around his waist to pull him back.
For a few moments, she doesn't speak anything. She stares at him, as if waiting for something. He sighs and moves closer to her. She wants a kiss. He will give her what she wants although he is afraid that he won't be able to stop once he gets started.
"He is alive. Breathe. Please." She whispered and he breathed deeply.
"Where were you Albus?" Teddy asks.
She picks Potter's hand and places it on her head before starting, "So, I will tell you about the diary now...
"There're two ways of removing memories. The one we usually use is not really used to remove those memories. We extract them and make a copy of those memories and store them elsewhere. The second way that I will use is to remove those memories from your mind so that you don't remember them at all. You can get them restored whenever you want to." Snape explains slowly.
She takes a deep breath and replies, "I like acting. I love films."
He won't commit the same mistake again. He won't ignore Draco's depression.
They look at Harry.
"I asked how is everything?" Draco said quietly.
"He had left a letter for you. We did not open it but we think you must read it." Ron said and Harry nodded "Okay."
"The kids have school," she said after a pause.
"Harry." Draco whispered again and Harry repeated "Yes."
"I mean it Draco. Just stay out of Potter's way and go to sleep. You need rest." This being said, Severus stands up and heads back towards the door.
"I hate wheelchairs." Harry said and Draco had already known this fact so he sighed before muttering "We do not have any alternative yet."
"Leave me. Please leave me." The voice belongs to Pansy who was trying to flee. Aurors bind her in thick ropes. She stares at Draco, her eyes pained.
He just shook his head. His eyes were so sad and her heart went for him.
"Now. We have to up early morning and I have to complete setting up my duelling Academy. I am thinking of a day for inauguration." Harry said excitedly. His erection had not waned completely but Draco's healing was much more important than it so he concentrated on the excitement in Draco's voice when he whispered "We would hold a party and start the school in a week. You can hold evening classes so that students who are going to Beauxbattens can attend it as well..."
She was breathing hard and he was not faring well himself. On the one hand, he was angry at Vernon Dursley and on the other hand, his own past was haunting him. So many times, he had been caught off guard. Some of his regular clients used to just barge inside his room sometimes and he had no other option other than entertaining them. He couldn't throw them out and risk losing his clients.
"To the hell with you. I know Harry's anger and anyways I am not interested in Draco now. He has been fucked over and over and I have no intention in doing this anymore."
"Yes." He murmurs because he doesn't wish to lie to her.
"Yes, our dear sister is waiting." Fred murmurs and as usual, his twin continues, "Yes. yes. The show must go on. Let's go."
"She's right." Zabini says, "Ask them and-"
"We received a letter. The writer had written their name in the opposite order." He spoke and Draco stared at Harry before muttering, "Why did you not tell me about your suspicions earlier?"
Harry's sudden entrance breaks through Draco's musings and Draco resumes her rocking. She has put on a black mid-thigh length frock. It has white stripes and is quite comfortable. It's also muggle and father can go to hell for all she cares. She will wear whatever she feels like.
"What happened? Why are you crying?" Harry realizes that his eyes are burning and there are dry tear tracks on his cheeks.
Severus's dark eyes widen in alarm before they meet Sirius's and then the man kneels in front of a five year old Harry Potter.
"I am sorry."
." Blaise hisses beside him and Draco grits his teeth in annoyance. Why can't Blaise stay out of it? Potter still doesn't say anything. What's up with him today?
Harry stands up after Ron closes the door and then sits on the edge of the bed, unsure.
Harry looked into his eyes and it was as if his eyes softened "Yes. We must but Pansy was your friend. She might be- and you do not want to find them."
agree. She nods, her eyes sad.
"D-d-da-dad." Albus stammers, "You - you said that you won't be back until next week." He has never been so terrified in his entire life. Dad is glaring at him. His eyes are flashing menacingly. Albus looks at dad and shivers because this is the man who defeated the most dangerous wizard of all time. He's the head auror and people
"I WON'T." Harry shouted again, his anger spiking and Draco ordered loudly "SIGN THEM, POTTER. SIGN THEM IMMEDIATELY."
Everyone except Sirius had decided to return. Lucius, Narcissa, Remus and Severus were returning a day before them. Severus and Remus had decided to live at Spinners end and teach at Hogwarts. Hermione and Ron had decided to return after a while. Lucius and Narcissa had decided to live at the Manor.
"Hmmm. Love you too. Goodnight. Don't forget your promise." Harry whispered and placed his face on Draco's shoulders.
Of course, Draco stopped to investigate. He was the head auror after all and Creevy needed to be stopped if he was harassing civilians.
Without even turning back, he snarled at the veela, "I'll kill you today and do this entire world a favour."
But it would take time and he couldn't bear to see Draco in so much pain. Time was something he didn't have.
" you won't " Harry warned him and Draco replied "I will. He deserves to be punished."
Were Blaise and Pansy lost too? Pansy had gone to her office. It was close to the ministry. Blaise had - damn - Blaise was an unspeakable. Draco should have checked. He was about to apparate back in front of the ministry because god knew what the unspeakables were doing to Blaise. But, then, he heard two consecutive POPs and breathed in relief when he realised Pansy and Blaise had come back.
Draco disappointed in him for not taking him out...
He stared at the door, standing dumbly and father and mother sat down on the chairs in front of his bed.
"HOW COULD YOU, YOU – YOU BLOODY COWARD? HOW COULD YOU JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?" He shouted hoarsely, to no avail. Draco lay there on the bed, still with eyes closed.
Harry laughed bitterly at his words, "I can't forgive myself so quickly and I can't forget this."
She continues tracing patterns on the bed sheet hesitantly.
Here goes nothing. She thinks and drinks the potion in one gulp. Smiling to herself, she closes her eyes and lets the darkness engulf her.
In the years they had been together, this technique had worked and Harry had always backed off, hurt and furious and Draco expected the same from Harry. What happened was completely unexpected.
He had refused to accept her invitation to stay at her home. Though he had not told her the reason, he had hoped that Draco would stay with him.
No matter how much he tried, he had never been able to escape it, never, because it was the only way to earn his bread and butter.
How could he have forgotten that nothing was simple with Malfoy.
"I am going. I am going. Don't talk about him like that. Come on Dudley."
The glass did fall from his hands when Draco threw Hermione towards him. He opened his arms and Hermione fell in them, sobbing frantically.
"I know, my son, that many a time in the past, I accused of being weak and I take my words back. You are the strongest person I have known, stronger than Albus Dumbledore himself. Dumbledore lost his sister and you tried to keep us alive and we know that it was the only reason you accepted the mark. You suffered those couple of years because of our sins, Draco. We were weak and could not see the true face of the dark lord. You saw it and bent your principles for our sake. Britain did not treat you like a human being and you are still serving them even if from a distance. A girl came to thank you today because your potions treated her magic and limping. A couple thanked us for giving birth to you. They say that your potion enabled them to have a child. Everyone is saying that I am lucky to have you as my son and I am lucky Draco. I am so lucky. Don't think that I do not know who is paying rent to our landlord or who is paying for our luxuries so that we can live in peace."
"Please, answer, Mr. Malfoy-Potter-"
Draco stared, stunned " How come it's my fault." and Harry continued "YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT ME. I HAD BURRIED EVERYTHING IN MY HEART. THESE NIGHTMARES STARTED WHEN YOU LEFT."
Weasley stopped in front of him and bend down to take deep breaths. Draco would have teased him about not having stamina but he was stunned speechless.
A sound catches her attention and she turns her head. The door is opening and she wants to hide somewhere. She wants to end her life. She wants to flee away.
Sirius had levitated James's body and placed it near Lily's and had sat beside the corpses with Harry in his arms. Severus had come few moments later and together they had buried Harry's parents and raised Harry. Remus had disappeared soon after the funeral. He had said that he couldn't look at Harry and not remember James and Lily.
"Okay." He whispers and they leave. Draco's mouth is open in a silent scream. He places a gentle hand on her forehead and murmurs, "Draco, it's me Harry Potter and the dark lord is dead. Please wake up."
"What did you think I would do after looking at these photos and reading the letter, Draco? Leave you alone, shout at you or god forbid, perhaps you thought that I would beat you up. What compelled you to commit suicide? You took such a big step. You decided for me as well. There must having been some reason. Tell me." Harry continued, his voice unreadable and Draco spoke in a small voice "I thought that you would despise me."
"Harry, you are being rude. She would be-" Draco started and Hermione cut off "Sorry for interfering but I understand. It's all right. I am under the healer's oath. I cannot hurt you. Do not worry please." She was being surprisingly understanding and Harry wondered if she had deduced some things that he hadn't. Hermione had always been perceptive.
The door opens and Harry's mouth falls open in shock because in comes Draco. She is wearing just a thin white shirt, his shirt, to be specific.
Harry opens his mouth to ask another question but an urgent knock interrupts him and he calls quickly, "Come in."
When Lucius falls on his knees in front of Harry, Harry jumps in surprise because come on, this is Lucius Malfoy and now he is sure that this is somehow related to Draco.
The words never came. With a wave of her hand, the papers and books rearranged themselves and she levitated them to the floor beside her chair. Draco sat down across her and Pansy and Blaise sat adjacent to him. Draco took some fresh fruits and curd and then stared at Granger's bent head.
"Please, stop drinking now." She said and sat on a chair beside his bed with her head in her hands. "I've sent so many letters to Draco. He doesn't reply. Even Ron tried to talk to him. He simply ignores us. "
Draco's love for Harry had just increased after this.
He would do anything to see Draco's eyes unclouded and happy for once. He would do anything to get rid of Draco's demons, to heal Draco but healing was a long and slow process and he would be patient with Draco. He repeated again "I do. I love you. I just want you to share with me. Tell me. What happened? Tell me everything. I just want you to relieve yourself off those demons. You know that I love you, don't you?"
He sniffs once and then looks at her, smiling softly, "Go to sleep. My room is the next one. Feel free to call me if you need anything."
"Dumbledore would definitely know something," Draco said, not saying anything about the fact that they were in some other dimension. Maybe, Draco was wrong and Dumbledore would have answers.
"But you are my husband and you have a right to-" Draco whispered, his eyes on Harry's and Harry couldn't control a lone tear from slipping from his eye now. How should he tell Draco that he had to be cautious of the only man he loved, the only man he trusted.
"She tries to keep us at a distance. She always has," Ariana continued, her voice trembling, whether from rage or pain, Harriet didn't know, "But, she loves us. We never wanted for anything and she-"
A loud sound of the foot hitting wood startled her and she started walking towards the cupboard where Harry's corpse was supposed to be rotting for a decade. It almost felt like there were ghosts in the house. It was smelling so much. She wanted to cry. She wanted to scream. She wanted to close her eyes. But, she did nothing of the sort. She only kept walking. She was not a witch and couldn't turn a cupboard into a wall. She couldn't because she wasn't magical and if being magical entailed becoming a murderer then she didn't want magic at all.
"I had promised that I would take care of you. I failed. I don't deserve you. I failed, Draco. I couldn't take care of you. I made you cry. I increased your depression. I compelled you to leave." Harry spoke, his eyes sad and still fixed on Draco.
Hermione has a tray and Ron has some plates and bowls in his hands. They settle down and wait for Draco to calm down.
"Potter, he is only trying to help," said Pansy.
Harry's eyes widened and he realized that his feeling had been right.
Harry walked towards Draco and kissed his nose softly before smiling "I understand." Draco just stared at him silently, his eyes shocked. "I am going to shower now. Don't forget that it's my turn to prepare breakfast. I will be down in ten minutes."
"Yes," Neville answered, his brows creased in a frown and Luna, being Luna murmured quietly, "Hogwarts is angry."
Scorpius only rolls his silver eyes and turns them away from Albus, "I don't want to meet your mother."
She looked startled for a moment but recovered quite quickly "Daddy said he was bad to you when you were a baby so you might not like me. Daddy is sorry-"
With a jerk, he slipped out of the tub. Merlin, his skin was burning and it was bound to leave rashes. It was paining so much.
"Thank you and All right. I will tell you." Harry replied, his eyes narrowed "You know me too well. I can not even hide anything from you."
"Draco." Fingers touched the back of his hand lightly and Draco almost gasped in surprise. For a moment, he had forgotten that he was in the head auror's office.
For instance, when he entered the kitchen, Draco's crestfallen face appeared to the forefront of his mind ...
"I thought you had called Kreacher for this purpose." Harry asked and Draco turned towards him "I like cooking so I will cook when I can and ask Kreacher to prepare meals if I am in some meeting or my lab."
She knocks the door before opening it.
He sighs on realizing that it's after curfew. The castle is huge and devoid of the only person Harry is still attending this school for. Were it not for Draco, he would have fled away from this mess, this unending war between right and wrong. His parents died long back and took Harry's childhood with them. He never knew them and he will never know them. The people he does know don't care enough for him. Sirius prioritized revenge over Harry. Remus didn't care enough to come out of his shell and look for Harry and Snape decided to believe what he wanted to.
Harry takes a deep breath before looking towards James and Lily who are alarmed.
This being said, Dumbledore stood up and exited the room, his hands joined. She noticed that his socks were still mismatched. Slowly and gradually, everyone left until only she was left. Bill was busy talking to Fleur as he left and rest of the Weasleys were too upset to notice that she was still there. She stood up and the first thing she did was to transfigure the gown into a green tank top and black denims.
Slowly, she juts her lower lip out. Belatedly, he realizes that she is pouting. It was strange to see such a sudden change in her mood.
Potter has Severus pinned against the wall, his hands on either side of Severus's face. Potter is saying something but Draco can't hear it. Draco's heart-beats accelerate and he climbs the stairs back and retreats to the guest room as quickly as possible.
"Tessa. May I have the pleasure to take you to Honey dukes. It has the most delicious candies I have ever eaten." Draco spoke and Harry said "I will be here and talk to Dudley for a bit. You can take her to Hogsmeade and show her the shops over there. She will like them."
He decided to do what Hermione had told him once.
Harry had his own demons, still has and Draco was in depression. They needed time to get to know each other and they ran into marriage without even trusting each other with their respective pasts.
"I am sorry." Draco murmured and Hermione spoke softly "I just told you that we are your family and you can let your pain out in any way you want. Their is no need to be sorry. You must visit people, your parents, Snape, Remus, Sirius. It has been a long time since you visited any of them or even owled them. Harry must reconcile with his godfathers too."
"No. I want to finish this today." Harry mutters and he means each and every word.
Unable to stand anymore, she slumped on her chair, staring at Ron. Had she been so wrong? She is a healer, for god's sake?
"You know I hate being held suddenly. You know that." Draco said bitterly and paused before continuing "Once again, you were too engrossed to remember what I need. As usual."
"So you see, that's what this potion does. It will decrease your thirst, if not quench it. It will make it bearable for you and will not compel you to drink from the nearest human being.
Albus stares at the man silently. Before Albus can answer, Mr. Zabini continues, "Oh my! Now I remember. How could I forget it. I would ask you to stay away from this but I know that you won't. I will have you know Albus that what you are doing is going to have consequences."
"Oh!" Harry exclaimed. He couldn't leave Malfoy alone, no matter how much he wanted to. That Malfoy would be here, in Godric's Hollow, clearly obliviated and that too with his child indicated that something was very very wrong. Who obliviated him and why? After all, Malfoy had not taken the dark mark and there had absolutely been no evidence of Malfoy being a death eater or involved in their activities in any way.
"No.”
Potter only smiles.
Harry sighs deeply before starting in a soft voice, "Just remember that I'm sorry."
He continued softly, "Rape is rape Draco, no matter whether it's your husband or a stranger."
They had helped Dudley to find a list of buyers for there existing property. They had also helped him in renting an apartment in Hogsmeade.
After kissing him for several seconds, Harry pulled back and looked into his eyes.
Harry simply stared at Draco speechlessly for a couple of minutes. What had he done? He was the only one Draco trusted. What the fucking hell had he done?
Draco yelled at him "I don't care about him."
He screams in pain and then something very surprising happens. A car - uncle Vernon's car comes speeding towards him which causes the trio to back off. Harry wonders if Uncle Vernon is just going to do him a favor and kill him off but that doesn't happen.
Draco wondered if Harry's decision would change once he realizes who was actually responsible, rather, who were responsible for Draco's fate.
But, was he following her?
" He will never forgive me. " Lucius spoke and Narcissa shook her head " Mark my words. He is not angry with you. He is not meeting us because he is ashamed of himself. "
"You're looking like your mother," he says and is not surprised that his voice is hoarse, "she was a veela."
"Harry," she whispered, surprised that her voice was soft. She had locked him inside just yesterday night. She had wanted to torture him - not kill him and as this thought crossed her mind, she realized that she was disgusted with herself. She was torturing just because he was Lily's son and had magic unlike her.
"You are kidding. Aren't you, Potter?" Draco asks, bewildered when the man doesn't.
"Tell me." She murmured. Half an hour had elapsed since he had left for Harry's house. What could go wrong in half an hour? Finally Ron started, his hand on her's.
"Yes," She said blandly, her eyes cold and hard as she gazed at Blaise and then at Draco. She did not look at Pansy who was ignoring the entire conversation. This was something she did because she did not want to get involved with anything related to the golden trio. She said that they just attracted trouble.
Harry gasps and stops in his tracks. They are at a bit of distance. He can finally afford to take a few seconds to breath. His body trembles as he bends and places his hands on his knees before taking huge erratic breaths.
Silence ensued until Harry reached the door of the bath. Draco asked in a small voice "Are you not angry?"
He hissed in parsletongue, unknowingly.
Sirius considers denying. Malfoy won't take kindly to the intrusion. But Harry's eyes become really huge and his lower lip trembles and Sirius realizes that he simply can't deny his godson. Severus would glare at him if he were but he isn't because he can't resist giving in to Harry's request.
"At what time should I return?" Harry asked and Draco whispered "In the evening. Eat dinner at Severus's".
"Draco, shall we go tomorrow to look out for properties?" Harry asked and sipped his tea. Draco looked at his empty plate and nodded, "yes. Sure."
Draco backed off and sat back on his seat across from Harry again, looking terrified and devastated and bloody Merlin, his eyes were shining.
Their peace was disturbed by a soft tapping on the window and Draco yawned "Open the window, Harry."
Harry looked at Draco quietly. In the past week, their relationship had grown and he had started understanding Draco a bit. He had shared some things of his own past with Draco, though his secret stayed hidden.
Harry noticed that Draco had changed in this aspect. His anger was not at all in his control. His hands were clenching and unclenching and Harry cleared his throat "Please leave Hermione."
The girl looked at him when Narcissa stood up and spoke "Is potions master Draco Malfoy your son.?"
Harry woke up before Draco the following day and blinked a couple of times before wiping his eyes with the back of his hand. After a couple of minutes, he opened his eyes and sat up. With a jolt, he reminisced everything that had happened the previous night. Instantly, shame overcame him and he stared at the opposite wall.
Harry's throat was closing. He could not speak anymore. His best friends could have untied themselves, it was not a difficult task for them but he saw understanding in their eyes. He untied them because he did not have the energy to even hold his wand anymore.
"See Hermione I told you. You should have spoken to her." Ron snaps at Hermione. Harry stares at him. His brown eyes are irritated as he regards an equally annoyed Hermione Granger.
Draco had thought that he was overreacting a bit or perhaps being overdramatic.
He nodded and Blaise dragged him out of the club and apparated him to his house- empty house with empty rooms but a very nice bar where he could drink to his heart's content.
"Let's eat." James says and together they walk inside the restaurant.
One misstep and he would lose Draco. He had to tread carefully. He tried again "Draco." Draco looked at him hesitantly and their eyes locked. Draco was searching something in his eyes and must have found it because he muttered "Harry."
"Do you have an office?" Weasley asked.
He understood why when Percy and Penelope joined her. Percy stood between them and pulled Potter close to him, close enough that their sides were touching completely and his hand was literally spread on her belly.
"Potter what's wrong with you?" Draco's voice is louder than before.
"I have no words." Severus whispers and finally Lucius looks at him before whispering, "He threatened to kill our entire family including you if I don't take her to him."
But, castles did not glare, did they?
"I forgive you. It's okay." Draco whispered, his arms around Harry's waist.
Sweet Merlin, how could be so stupid.
"I won't. Goodnight." Draco mumble, already knowing that the truth would devastate Harry. But there was no other alternative. Draco was confused with Weasley's reaction. He wondered if their was in fact some conspiracy going on it could be someone polyjuced as Weasley. Why had escaped it notice before?
The sight that met his eyes when he opened the door took his breath away.
- after all, she had married Weasley fourteen years ago and they had three children together.
When Albus brings Scorpia over, she is calm and her eyes are blank. She is wearing a polite mask.
"You are mad." He muttered and she laughed "So are you both."
Potter didn't answer. He shrugged and turned back to look at the wall. He ignored Draco completely and it irked him. He hated being ignored, especially by Potter.
"What are you hiding, headmaster?" Harriet asked quietly, getting straight to the point, "I need to get out of this castle."
" Will you stop taking in riddles? " Harry glared at him. This was another change. Harry had controlled his temper.
"Ah! Yes. I would certainly like to share the tale with everyone. This happened a month ago. It was a Sunday morning...
"Ah! That would explain why she did not answer me." Harry whispered, continuing "Perhaps she thinks that I would not help her."
"Okay, I'll do it." Draco sighs decisively.
After five minutes, he heard a mumbled "I hear voices and feel hands all over me sometimes." And he froze. It was so difficult to control his urge to take Draco in his arms and to never let him go. This was crucial because Draco had never shared this with him. He needed Draco to trust him so he nodded "When do you feel them?" He ensured that his voice was blank. Draco would react very negatively to sympathy or pity or to anything akin to it.
Draco didn't answer him. There were two chairs across from Black. He pulled the left one and sat on it. He lifted his right ankle over his left knee and leaned back in his chair before drawling dismissively, "You can rest assured that if I leave the country, it won't be because I got cold feet."
"I was so worried Draco. I heard you were injured and I was so bloody worried. Came as soon as I could. Initially I thought that Harry won't like it but then I remembered that Harry asked me to stay in touch so I thought that I would reconcile with him."
"I didn't have a crush on her." He says.
"I'm afraid I don't have an answer yet," Dumbledore said, his face completely blank. Harriet wondered if he was lying. It won't be the first time. She turned her face to look at the twins. Fred was quite red, his both hands under the table whereas George's face was very white. His right hand was under the table. They looked at her and their eyes grew really furious before they became wide and they pinched their lips together. Zabini's face was so blank that anyone else would think that the twins were just not feeling well. Harriet turned back towards Dumbledore, knowing that this would not really stop them from harassing her. But, it was amusing as well as satisfying to see them suffer.
