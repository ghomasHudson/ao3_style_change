“Yeah,” Harry responded, looking straight ahead towards the barrier as they continued on, “it’s just so loud.”
When he finally told Draco about Sirius’s revelation, he was met with a frown. “I had no clue my mum had that ability,” he said, feeling put out.
When he next awoke, his head felt explosive and his arm felt like it was in need of severing. He groaned in pain, alerting Jack that he had finally come to. He felt a cool glass pressed against his lips and he gratefully drank, the scene feeling altogether too familiar. When he finally opened his eyes, he was met with Jack’s kind gaze, forehead wrinkled in concern. “How am I even here? I have to get back—Blaise is in trouble.” He tried sitting up, but Jack just gently pushed him back into the pillows.
The two sat in comfortable silence together for awhile as Draco sipped his tea slowly. He was beginning to really get used to having Remus around and it made him nervous. He didn't want to become to attached to any adult figure – he already missed his mother more than words could say. The thought of Narcissa made his heart clench – he wondered if she was alright. Finally, Remus said, "I spoke to Fenrir this morning about your condition."
"Draco requested asylum and it was granted by Dumbledore." Ron scoffed in disbelief, Hermione's eyes narrowed in suspicion, and Harry just looked on, silent for once. "You are to treat him, and each other, with the respect that young wizards should be exhibiting, and cease this nonsense."
“You just told me Voldemort scratched your arms up, of course you are. It’s fine, it’s just stress. Madam Pomfrey will sort you out.”
Draco sat up at that, eyes wide. “I think I was.” Draco shook himself. “I’m sorry. With the moon this close I want to hide you away. The notion of Voldemort having access to you has my brain all fuzzy.”
Draco nodded. “I know that. But at least the side I’m on isn’t calling people animals. Or murdering for fun. I understand wanting to preserve Pureblood traditions. I just don’t think that excluding others from experiencing those traditions is the way. Blood purity isn’t even a real thing. We have creature blood for chrissakes.”
Sirius hummed in confirmation. “Dreadfully boring, the Garden,” he commented. “Though, it was nice to spend some time with James and Regulus. Azkaban really did a number on my head: completely forgot about the place until I ended up there. I lost so much time with them.” Molly just smiled kindly at him as he babbled on. He eyed her suspiciously. “Why are you being so nice to me?”
Remus frowned. “Not when it counted apparently. When Sirius was convicted I did nothing. Everyone thought I was the spy because of Fenrir. After all of the secrecy and eggshell walking around me for months, I felt betrayed that he’d actually be what his family was when I finally saw the paper. It was a mess. I never visited or requested a proper trial. I essentially let him rot there, too trapped in my own misery to see reason. Harry wouldn’t have had to be at the Dursleys if I demanded justice. Anyone could see it was Peter now.”
Once out on the street, Harry leaned against the brick wall. “That was close wasn’t it?” he laughed.
Draco jumped at the sudden intrusion and looked up. It was Blaise. “Don’t scare me like that!” Draco replied. “I thought you were one of the others.”
“It’s him, isn’t it? It’s always been him.” The First Years started whispering more excitedly. Blaise turned to them. “Oy, you lot, out.” They grumbled at Blaise but didn’t dare cross an upperclassmen, leaving the room.
People were beginning to look over at them to see the commotion. Draco didn’t even care. “I know you more than you want me to. This isn’t healthy.”
Harry raised an eyebrow at his surname. He must have cut Snape with that remark. “You delivered him to certain death. How could you?”
“Don’t,” he responded, unwilling to deal with another round of Muggleborn ideas of what is and isn’t fair.
Harry looked up at this in surprise. He assumed Draco was just primping, knowing how vain the ex Malfoy Heir could be. He hadn’t considered insecurity was the reason behind Draco’s scrutiny. “You don’t look much different to me,” Harry offered in response, standing to join him by the mirror.
Draco took the news pretty well. He had a sneaking suspicion Dumbledore was doing this to protect him, fully aware of what being disowned would do to his reputation with the Slytherins. At least he wouldn’t need to come up with a bogus excuse as to why he was avoiding the dorms.
Harry looked at him in surprise, green eyes bright with disbelief. "I wouldn't peg you as being into Muggle literature."
Sirius sighed in relief. “He’s a bit jumpy after everything, sorry about that.” He ran his hand through his wild locks, never having put his hair back up after his quick shower interim back home. “I honestly thought the wandless magic was common knowledge at least on his medical sheet. So, he’s got a dampner? He must be pissed.”
The Healer nodded. “I want you to take this tonight. First, you need some rest and this might help. Second, if the dead are truly speaking to you, the Dreamless Sleep will not affect your ability to reach them.”
with his kin—he could not possibly understand why Remus would ever give this up. It was exhilarating. When the morning came, the only soreness he felt was from running all night—his body reacted kindly to Fenrir’s fix.
As everyone settled into the celebration, Draco pulled Harry into a darkened corner, overwhelmed with his magical prowess. It was truly intoxicating and Draco was losing a battle of his senses to it. “You did amazing,” he said. Harry’s eyes were aglow with his magic as he pulled Draco into a searing kiss, onlookers be damned. This only increased Draco’s frenzied response to Harry’s magic, and suddenly he had the urge to Mark him right then and there. Harry’s hands were roaming all over his body, also drunk off of the magic so heavy in the air. Draco began kissing his neck, ravishing him with his tongue and Harry let out a little moan in response, hardening against the blonde’s leg. Draco felt his body begin to shift as Harry pushed him against the courtyard wall, his teeth suddenly feeling too large for his mouth. He froze in panic, causing Harry to begin to kiss Draco’s neck with as much fervor as the blonde was previously administering.
“I really think you should stay in Prefects quarters this year. I know Nott has it in for you,” he heard Blaise say, concern sparkling in his eyes.
Harry eyed the knife block on the counter while he made his way next to Sirius. It alarmed both Draco and Remus for a moment until he asked, “Can someone cut my hair? I need it out of my face.”
Draco nodded curtly, looking at the ground. “We can’t do it though, not without Bill’s help and he’s at Shell Cottage with Fleur. The vampire genes will attack me again, I’m sure of it.”
“Obviously don’t send it—that would be daft. Write a letter and get your feelings out. Up to you what you do with it. I used to do it all the time when I was stuck in Grimmauld and threw them in the fire when I was finished. I swear it’ll make you feel better.”
Ron grabbed Harry’s hands away from each other. “Stop that. You already have enough scarring on your hand from Umbridge.”
“Oh, double date with the son: love it,” James exclaimed happily and Harry flushed again. He really wasn’t used to having a love life, or any life, really. “I can ask Draco his intentions,” he grinned wickedly, wiggling his eyebrows.
Blaise reached out and squeezed Draco’s hand. “You should say whatever you need to in order to heal. He’s upended your life in so many ways. You deserve closure.”
Draco sighed, leaning back into the chair. “It’s always the Golden Trio isn’t it? Everyone just has to try and fit in around them.”
Draco pulled his hand away and rubbed his face in frustration and embarrassment. “You were so drunk I didn’t want to take advantage of you,” he explained. “Weasley has been pestering me for weeks about my feelings. I wouldn’t have been able to heal you the way I did if I didn’t have feelings for you.” He glanced at Harry when he didn’t say anything. “I’m sorry, I should’ve kept it to my—”. But Draco was cut off by Harry’s lips crashing into his.
Of course, he still had those times of intense sadness as he pondered all of the loss he had suffered as of late, but without all of that darkness inside of him he felt so much lighter. Confessing his feelings to Draco helped as well, he was sure.
Remus bustled in before Draco can respond. “We’re getting someone new today,” he said, “Kingsley just sent a Patronus.” Well
“Sixteen is a special age for wizards and witches – you come into your full heritage and powers,” Remus explained further.
Ron snorted. “You wish.” The two shuffled into the room, pulling chairs closer to his bed. Draco let the surrealness of it all wash over him. Never in his wildest dreams would he imagine Remus, Ron, and Hermione visiting him in the hospital in any context. Now, it was just normal. They’ve come a long way since the summer.
The elder wolf shook his head. “No. Honestly, I need to rest and I’m not sure if Harry will be allowed visitors. Sirius is going to let me know how it goes as soon as he can.”
Draco tried to sit up and grunted in pain. “Draco you need to stop doing that,” Remus chided, gently helping him into a more comfortable position. “They let you out to visit, then?” Remus asked the two newcomers.
“I suppose being dragged out to nightclubs in the middle of the night was not on Draco’s summer agenda.”
Remus rubbed his temples as a migraine began to form. The Confundus was lifting and it was painful. He was getting glimpses of a cuddled up James, Sirius, and newborn Harry in his mind, and suddenly lots of crying and sadness. “It didn’t work, though: he was still targeted.”
“It’s all my fault you even got to that point. I shouldn’t have shut you out. I should have kept a closer eye. You were obviously in need of help anyone could see it. I’m so sorry.” Draco was crying now, fully overwhelmed by the guilt that was consuming him. He was also furious at Dumbledore for brushing it off as well. Did he
Draco nodded. “It’s definitely an uncomfortable feeling but I’ll be okay. I’m more worried about Harry and Ron—they’re a bit more sensitive to the malaise, it seems.”
“Nothing? He’s not your problem even if he’s a tit,” Harry replied, sitting in the chair next to him.
Harry had been in the foulest of moods since Remus had pulled the plug on his nightly ventures. He would either be hiding out in his and Draco’s shared room or causing a scene in the kitchen or living room. Rarely, he would give an answer to how he was feeling—if anything, it made him more irate. There was no talk of any attempted kissing; in fact, Draco thought Harry was probably too drunk to remember. Draco wasn’t willing to divulge that information either, lest he become Harry’s next object of derision.
Draco scrubbed his face tiredly at that. “These past few fulls have been terrible,” he commented. “I honestly think being a demi-werewolf is worse than the whole thing. To still be in a human body while all that is rolling through…” he shuddered. “I’m not sure how much more I can take.”
James grinned. “Cheers, mate. I’ll let you get back to it with Remus. If you see Harry, tell him we say hi.”
I spent some time there before Gringotts as well. I might have some valuable information for you." Bill felt Draco's head and tsked. "And let's not kid ourselves about how ill you've been in correlation with how ill other werewolves feel. You look ready to fall over and the moon is four days away."
Sirius was leaning against none other than James Potter who had his arm wrapped around the dog Animagus, the two looked thick as thieves, mid-laughter.
Bill then began running a multitude of diagnostic spells on Draco, muttering to himself all the while. After what seemed like hours of tingling sensations and Remus staring at him worriedly, Bill was done. "Alright, Draco. I think I've gotten to the root of it."
“He’s going to get through it but it’s definitely going to be a rough road. He’s still mourning and this just makes it worse.”
James grimaced, knowing the stigma and the struggle. “Have to check: hell, Remus still checks me half the time.”
“You can’t use your healing magic on yourself? Seems like you could use a Cheering Charm,” Sirius commented.
Draco rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “I wasn’t sure when you died. I’m a little older than him is all.”
“He’s—well, inherited your depression, I’m afraid. With James’s anxiety to boot. Always been there under the surface, I suspect. He was always pretty quiet and having a Dark Lord after you since birth doesn’t help. He’s been a bit of a mess, really.”
Lunch was less eventful, but it was nice to spend time with his Dads, Remus, and Draco all at once. It was like the end of summer all over again. If people in the Three Broomsticks thought the group was odd, none of them cared very much about it, chatting away about hopes for the upcoming school year.
Draco frowned at the cognitive dissonance within him. “We’ll always be friends. I just can’t be with you like that with a war going on and you trying to protect your family.” He thought about Remus and the colony. “I’m not putting you in a position to have to choose between me and your family again.”
McGonagall scoffed at Dumbledore. “Albus this seems to be well-beyond schoolboy antics: he’s coping with grief in a very destructive way. We should get a Mind Healer in to see him.”
“Brilliant, you can stand in line behind Harry. If we get enough members we plan to fuck off to France.”
“Have you been confiding in anyone about what you’re going through? I haven’t really seen you in a few weeks outside of class.”
else commit that atrocity? He was feeling very conflicted: Snape had told him to keep his head down and stay on the light, but why would he then kill Draco’s only form of protection? It didn’t add up. Nevertheless, the school was left with a Dark Mark in the sky and feelings of profound mourning—more so than when Diggory was murdered.
It all tumbled out of him then. The dreams, the visits from the dead, even Voldemort disturbing his nights once more. Sirius was the whitest shade of pale Harry had seen him in awhile by the end of it.
Harry was suddenly crying openly, unable to keep his emotions in check. He never dreamed that he would be able to speak to James, let alone hug him. It made him ache for Lily, even if he thought she had tricked him.
“Only twice per week?” Sirius asked in disbelief. “He’s having the worst time with sleep, can’t he take it more often?”
Draco folded the parchment and tucked it in his desk drawer. “Nothing to worry about. Maybe there’s a foreign Patronus that will take you to see the Loch Ness Monster.”
The Healers couldn’t tell him anything because he wasn’t family, which felt like a slight to him. His family was still in Italy trying to get home to him—does nobody get to help Blaise along or know what’s happening with him? Remus and Sirius seemed to have information on Blaise—why was he barred from knowing the details?
Draco scrunched his face up in thought. Ancestral healing magic? Before he could ask anymore questions, his father came back with a Healer.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “Or, perhaps Potter,” he began in a haughty tone, making Harry flinch at the surname, “I really do need to rest and I can’t support your drinking habits any longer when my health is in jeopardy.” How easy it was to click into old habits, he thought. It made him uncomfortable but he had enough with Harry for one night. By now they were making quite the scene and Draco couldn’t care less. Ron was even craning his neck out of his doorway.
As he felt himself fading he heard screaming. He saw James’s face, then Regulus’s, then some he couldn’t place. James was gripping his arms tightly and yelling out. Harry felt like it was all too dramatic—he’d be with him in the Garden after all—it couldn’t be so bad. He tried to tell him, but no sound would come out.
Draco squeezed his hand tight; Harry gripped back even harder. “Breathe,” Draco encouraged, “you’re working yourself into a panic attack.”
He swallowed thickly, not sure if he actually was ready for a crowd. But he reminded himself that these were friends and supporters—not crowds in Diagon Alley or in the halls of Hogwarts looking to get a piece of him. He nodded. “As ready as I’ll ever be.”
"Why did that man put this in your head?" Remus agonized, mostly to himself. "You're not poisoning your wolf. It makes it easier to ignore base instincts when you transform – the wolf is still all there, it just makes sure you're all there with him. Besides, this will lessen the ill feelings before and after transforming and most likely save your life. There's not much to debate here, Draco."
“He looks so small,” Lucius said brokenly. It was obvious that seeing his son in such a state was destroying the man’s resolve.
He thought about Remus a lot and the guilt the older werewolf was carrying inside of him for not trusting Sirius in the beginning. He also considered Harry and his constant state of mourning he seemed to be in. He was sure Harry was worried about the upcoming war as well and keeping everyone safe. He just wanted to help them, a new feeling he had acquired seeing as he never really felt the need to help anyone before. He chalked it up to the wolf enhancing his emotions.
“Ugh,” Harry ran a hand down his face in frustration, “Draco. I was going to leave him hanging out to dry again.”
“Of course. You should definitely get a say in how the world you saved gets shaped, if you’re willing.”
The days at Black Manor were also quiet, with Remus or Sirius frequently whispering in corners of the building. It was just Draco, Harry, and the two elders in the house and Draco hadn’t felt such loneliness in a while. His transformation in the Manor was even lonelier, with Sirius and Remus roaming the house in their canine forms while Draco was stuck feral in a human body, regardless of wolfsbane. Harry had sat with him throughout the night, not saying anything but wiping his brow every so often. He looked broken at the sight of Draco struggling, watching him with a haunted look to him. Draco almost wished he was still a full werewolf—it would be better than this halfling life.
"Great," Draco replied sarcastically in between enthusiastic bites. "Just what I need: more mother henning."
Harry stepped in. The bun was still in place—he wondered if Sirius refused to cut it for him. “It’s your house, too.” He glanced at the parchment. “What’s that?”
“That must have been very trying for you, my dear boy.” Draco had to suppress rolling his eyes at that one. “Does your father know of your intentions?”
“You show remorse and sense for someone known for stealing children,” Draco couldn’t help but blurt out. His chances were ruined now, weren’t they?
Draco clasped his hand over his mouth, feeling drained. “Is he going to be okay?” he finally got out.
“Should we be trusting Dumbledore with all of this? He was happy to let you march to your death, after all.”
Draco nodded. “I know. He seems alright even though it’s only been a couple of weeks.” Draco ignored the reality that it only felt like a few days for him as he was in a coma for the beginning of the healing process and continuously in and out of sleep since then. He reached for the paper. “I guess it couldn’t hurt. I’m here indefinitely anyway.”
Oh. “I’m past Hogwarts age now, I’m afraid,” Draco replied with a frown. He hadn’t quite worked out the details on how he would finish his schooling—he couldn’t imagine not sitting for his NEWTs, all things considering. He tried not to look put out by the fact that he may be destined for professions without schooling as a necessity, like shopkeeping and the like.
Draco found his voice again and nodded. “This house is the only one with access. It’s not like someone was hiding out there. I wanted to show Harry the Garden; do you know of it?”
Harry rubbed his face tiredly, showing off his forearm scar as he lifted his arm. “I need to sit with that man for a few hours. Why does he explain this to everyone but me?” He rolled off of Draco’s bed to make some coffee.
Then he was gone. Draco, relieved that he finally had physical proof that Harry was alive even if he was still a bit worse for wear, took the opportunity to rest before his family came back. They’d deal with this horcrux nonsense when they got out of here. They were in good hands.
Harry pulled his hand away. “Absolutely not—your eye is already clouded over. You’re taxed out—don’t poke around my body and hurt yourself more.”
Draco glared at the ceiling. “My father is a murderer. He shouldn’t even be allowed here.” He squeezed Remus’s hand tightly as a wave of pain rolled through him. “Fuck.”
Sirius allowed Remus to envelop him in a soul-crushing hug, not knowing what he did to deserve the werewolf’s grace. They would make it right together.
“Nice to see you leaving the cave. I was starting to worry you’d become so pale you’d disappear,” he joked. Draco grimaced in return. “How is the arm doing?”
So much self disclosure at once was making Draco's head spin. Soon, though, Remus came to see him. "You're looking much better," he noted, feeling his head. "The fever has tapered off. Excellent."
“At least come down to dinner. We’re not going to be upset with you – whatever it is,” Ron pressed. “I meant it when I said we can handle your darkness.”
“Really?” Draco asked. Pansy and Blaise looked at each other in mild surprise as well. “Isn’t that a bit too much in the Old Ways for your sensibilities?”
“And what am I supposed to do in the meantime with him?” Draco crossed his arms. “I can’t keep coddling him.”
Harry nodded, eyes growing thoughtful and far away. “Me too, I think. I dunno what I want to do now.”
Students were beginning to put the pieces together as to who he was. He stuck by Hermione and Ron throughout the day, which was most likely the first tip off. Instead of confirming or denying their accusations, he just felt himself sinking further into the depths as he remained silent.
Harry nodded, uncurling to sit up with his father. “I know that. Walburga is always screaming about you.” Sirius grimaced at that. “Is that why?”
Draco did smile at that. He had been practicing healing magic more frequently now that he knew he wasn’t returning to school any time soon: he split most of his time between defensive and offensive battle spells and healing magic. Any time an Order member came back bruised and bloody, it gave him an opportunity to practice on actual people. It was quite the highlight of his day when he was able to help in this way. “I’ve moved past cuts and bruises and have been able to foray into metal health and brain chemistry. It’s kind of cool.”
Remus looked nonplussed at the greeting, amber eyes narrowed, lips forming a thin line. “I was okay with you guys blowing off steam – I’ve been 16 contrary to popular belief. But fighting in a Muggle club? Really?”
“And who said narcissism was a female trait?” Harry quipped, smiling jokingly at his father. It was as though they didn’t miss months of time together. It made Draco ache for his mother once more, wondering how they would interact when they met again.
"And growing fangs once a month," Draco replied sarcastically, but he was already feeling better. "Thanks, professor."
“It’s okay,” he heard Remus say as he kneeled next to him, “I’m going to transform with you. It’ll be alright, Draco. Just breathe.”
Turner looked down at his maroon garb and back up. “Fieldwork uniform—makes it easier to get around and treat—those robes are difficult to do anything in, honestly. If you were awake for your last venture, you’d find that your Healers were in blue scrubs—emergency unit garb. We’ve been petitioning to do away with the robes for ages,” he responded.
The blonde frowned, remembering those dark times. He shuddered a little at the thought. “He was pretty weak,” he supplied.
As the potion began to subside some of the pain, Draco sighed in relief as he said affectionately, “Fuck off, Potter.”
“That would be great,” Harry replied enthusiastically. “I’ve always felt more connected with magic around me rather than channeling it through a wand—I think learning some of the Old Ways could help me hone those skills more.”
The next morning Draco was feeling even worse if it were possible. He curled himself into a ball early on and hadn't moved all morning. Nobody bothered him until about midday, probably thinking he was just trying to sleep in before school resumed. He felt a hand on his forehead and blearily opened his eyes to see Remus unsurprisingly, looking very concerned. "He's been like this all morning," he heard from somewhere in the room- it was Potter. Of course. He closed his eyes again, too weak to protest.
“Looks to be the case. Not sure if Harry realizes that, though. Harry’s going to be upset for me telling you but you need to know.”
a werewolf. And Theo is a Death Eater: isn’t that right, Theo?” Theo glared daggers at him in response, standing. “Now, shall we continue to address each other by demarcations outside of our control or are you going to grow the fuck up?”
When he re-entered the room, Healer Turner looked thoughtful, his eyes looked like there were a thousand gears shifting in his head.
Draco sighed, thinking about his conversation with Remus all of those weeks ago. “I know. I forgive you for that. I would probably do the same.”
Draco woke up to the brightest white his eyes could take. It resulted in a splitting headache. “Ugh,” he groaned, voice sounding like he hadn’t used it in ages, closing his eyes. He felt someone stir beside him. Maybe he wasn’t dead?
Draco nodded and closed his eyes. “Me too.” The magic felt so strong that he could feel his wolf pushing to the forefront of his mind. He concentrated on pushing it down: now was not the time.
Harry continued to primarily speak to James about this, remaining silent to the living. He’d bounce the most ridiculous ideas off of him about how he could best protect Draco in the event of the Killing Curse or overexerting himself, coming up with little. He was modeling Hermione, spending copious amounts of time in the Black library, even going so far as to go into werewolf clan magic, which the library had several books on to Harry’s surprise. The silence was beginning to really worry Remus and Sirius. Draco seemed to be okay with Harry’s muteness, taking it as a form of grief more than anything. He didn’t suspect that the quiet was due to something potentially happening to Draco.
“The diary.” The man was more cunning than Draco anticipated, his muddy eyes gleaming in glee. Draco, however, didn’t really care about the repercussions of giving away a diary his father was seemingly obsessed by.
“I’m here to see Harry.” Draco bit his lip and stared at the older woman hoping she wouldn’t ask any awkward questions. From the beginning of the school year, almost everyone knew Draco and Harry were sworn enemies, and ever since that one quidditch match they certainly played the part for real.
“And why, Salamander’s blood?” At this, Draco did not seem to have the answer. Hermione’s arm was still in the air.
“Lucius and I haven’t spoken properly in months.” She replied softly. Over the months as she discovered Draco’s secret, Lucius had been given something of dire importance to the Dark Lord. He was consumed by it, and he had explicitly told Narcissa in one of his lucid moments that she must not tell him anything, nor associate him. She couldn't quite figure out if he was under an
everything in a school full of magic,” Ron said again, thinking about what Draco had said that morning. Harry nodded in agreement as they entered the Great Hall, gaze intently searching for Draco, who seemed to be in the middle of an animated conversation with Vincent Crabbe and Blaise Zabini. He felt a little jealous at the sight but sat next to Ron at the Gryffindor table.
He glanced at the bedside table and was surprised to find no water or tea. Come to think of it, the bedside table didn’t look like his bedside table at all. What on earth was he doing in one of the guest rooms?
The last present was the smallest and had a note that said Open when you’re alone. Draco pocketed it, despite his mother giving him a severe look. He realized too late that she recognized the scrawl. They were the same as the name etched on his ribs.
“He’s perfect, the chap.” A new voice declared, having entered the room after the baby’s birth. Abraxas Malfoy regarded his grandson with pride and joy. The continuity of the Malfoy line. Narcissa definitely agreed with her father-in-law as she stared down at her son. The baby was indeed perfect. She knew immediately there wasn't anything she wouldn't do for her son, who had a tuft of familiar ice blonde hair atop his tiny pink head.
The four met, huddled in an alcove before lunch. Draco hugged Harry immediately, not having seen him for a while, but it certainly seemed as if the three were bursting to tell Draco something.
Hello, this fic is slowly being revised and edited. At the moment, there aren't any major plot changes happening during the revisions, but please bear with me as I work on making this a bit better!
His mother picked up the book with a smile on her face and added it to the pile of his presents. The next present, which he guessed was Ron’s from how messily it was wrapped, was a huge box of Bertie botts every flavor beans. He popped a red one in his mouth and smiled when he realized it was a cherry.
“I’d think you would at least remember the potion, Mr Potter, considering the fact that you drank it just last year to reach a
“Are you a muggle?” It was a word Hagrid had used to describe the Dursely's and Harry had an inkling that word meant that they were ordinary people and not wizards.
“That’s twelve.” He grinned at Blaise, who was still on his third but was clearly struggling with it as he picked up another.
“Five points from Slytherin, each.” Snape looked as if it pained him physically to say so as Draco and Blaise shuffled in.
Checking to ensure that no students were around, she sat down next to her. “Why has reading about blood purity made you so upset, miss Granger?” She was only concerned for the state of her book, she told herself in her mind, not of the student.
“D’you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?” Harry asked after explaining to Draco what the professors had said in Lockhart’s office
“I haven’t spoken to Dobby in a while. I’ve been angry at him since I found out he intercepted your letters, Harry.” Harry’s eyes widened first in anger then curiosity.
“I hope so, Marcus.” Draco took a bite of his lamb chop. “I’ve been practising all summer, and I’ll be in my best shape for Friday. Only time will tell I guess?” Marcus smiled at Draco in almost a brotherly fashion.
“I’ll go in. It’s Percy so he’ll wonder why you’re here.” Draco nodded and tried to look as conspicuous as possible, hanging out in front of the Gryffindor prefect’s cabin. Hermione didn’t take long, and she came out looking a little less worried.
Potions was a miserable class, and Ron was fuming by the end of it. It wasn’t because of Snape’s general displeasure of Gryffindors, but his particular dislike towards Hermione Granger. Before Ron could catch up to Hermione, who with glassy eyes, simply fled the class as soon as Snape deemed the lesson over.
He suddenly heard tiny footsteps and sat up in bed. Through a gap in his bed curtains, Harry could see that Ron was fast asleep in his own bed, and reached for his wand under the pillow. Before he could do anything, a piece of parchment floated onto his lap, and he immediately knew it wasn’t an invader in their dorm, but Dobby.
‘HARRY POTTER!’ His heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running towards them. He got to his feet, trembling. ‘Never – in all my time at Hogwarts –’ Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously,’ – how dare you – might have broken your neck –’ Harry immediately knew his and Draco’s banter and swinging the Remembrall around had gotten too far.
Draco was waiting by the corridor that led to the portrait of the fat lady, eyes wide when Harry Ron and Hermione made their way there. Harry took one look at Draco and knew that they had to talk, whatever differences or breaks he and Draco were going through.
Draco sat at the foot of his Christmas tree with his mother and grandfather. His father was not at home, but that was usual. Lucius Malfoy was never at home for Christmas. He got the promised Nimbus 2001 from his parents, although he was sure his father didn’t even know his mother had bought it. His mother had gotten him several new robes, all rich shades of navy, purple velvet, and green silk. He secretly wanted to make Harry try the silk robe, knowing it would bring out his eyes beautifully.
“Five points from Gryffindor, each.” Snape snarled at the trio, eyes darting from one to another. “Dumbledore may believe you to be innocent, but I don’t believe you, Potter. To your dorms, now.” Harry was hurrying away, invisibility coat in hand when he heard Snape deduct five points from Slytherin as well before dragging Draco away.
. Draco was about to say something when Dobby popped up amongst them for the first time, large eyes fearful.
“She’s always all over Ron Weasley.” Pansy continued with a smirk. Draco still hadn’t bit into the thirteenth tart. Blaise was still chewing on his tenth. “And Harry Potter.” Her voice became lower, still. Draco glared down at the tart.
“Done,” Said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. “Come, Draco-“Harry stood there in the dark for a while, angry at himself he hadn’t been more worried.
“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street looking at wands," said the boy. “Then I’m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first-years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.” Harry didn’t quite get half of what the boy was saying, but he liked how fast the boy could talk. It almost comforted him. The boy went on, rambling about something called quidditch, only stopping to ask Harry small questions about if he’s played it or who his favorite team is. Harry could barely say no before the boy started to ramble again. Harry just smiled and listened. He talked about houses and said he wanted to be picked to be in Slytherin. The two barely noticed the measuring tape whizzing about taking their measurements.
Harry loved Hagrid’s flute and blew on it a little before unwrapping the fifty pence the Dursley’s had sent. Ron was absolutely fascinated by the piece of muggle money.
“It’ll be a problem when it becomes a problem. For now, we need to protect Harry from you-know-who.” Sirius muttered. “Mooney, maybe we could have another butterbeer before we go.” He stared at his soulmate with big, innocent eyes, who sighed in response.
“The Slytherin quidditch team is crap, I agree. I’m not making excuses for them, but it’s because our head of house encourages us to be that way, not calling us out when we do anything against the rules. It’s more of, ‘win by any means necessary’, which is terrible.” Ron had gathered up all the pixies and shut them in the cage. He walked over to sit next to Hermione, looking somber.
“Milli! He’s a sixth year! Is he your soulmate?” Millicent went a little red but didn’t say anything. Pansy didn’t question the girl further but turned her attention to Draco and Blaise.
“Don’t be silly Sirius. Who else would it be but you?” Sirius wanted to say more but, the doorbell rang and Lilly stood up to go answer it.
“You’re so lucky. I barely knew about magic until a month ago.” As much as Draco wanted to interject and disagree with Harry, he didn’t. He supposed he
“If you practice hard enough, I certainly don’t see why not.” Abraxas chuckled as he seated himself by the fireplace. “Animagi are usually common in certain bloodlines, and I must say that the Malfoy one is not particularly known for it.”
“Excuse me,” Harry tried his best to sound confident, and something about the woman made him feel comfortable. She recognized him as a Hogwarts student almost immediately. How he didn’t quite know.
Terence was too far away to even realize he had caught it when he finally did. He could hear the cheers from his housemates when he landed on the ground, snitch in hand.
“I want to be one of them. I am one of them.” Sirius gestured to James, who was now pretending to bite Harry’s chubby little legs as Harry attempted to free himself by screaming at the top of his lungs. Lilly wondered if Mary and Marlene could get there a little sooner, the Marauders were difficult enough to handle by themselves, but it seemed that Harry was an exact replica of their ways. The baby adored Sirius, and if she wasn't careful, Harry would turn out to be just as bad.
“Was?” Sirius asked, sitting back down. “Off to fight any battles I don’t know about, kid?” The tone was light, but his father’s eyes were tight with concern, anticipating what might be said next.
The rest of Christmas morning was uneventful. Molly and Sirius seemed to be getting on well and good, most likely because they weren’t discussing things like Harry’s involvement in “adult wizard affairs.” Everyone spent the majority of the morning and early afternoon opening gifts.
Draco’s eyebrows disappeared into his hairline, an easier feat now that it fell lazily over his forehead in waves rather than being glued to the top of his head. He never pegged Granger for wit, though he supposed he never paid much attention to her. “Fair enough,” he responded, not wanting to add more tension to the environment. “Unfortunately, I’ll have an X on my back no matter what House I belong to. I’m also a Prefect: I can’t just abandon my House.”
“And that attitude is why it will make it a difficult sell to allow you to apprentice here one day.” It was Healer Markus from the doorway.
“She hasn’t really given me the time of day since we got back.” Another lie. “Anyway, I thought this was about you. You can talk to me, you know. We’re sort of friends now, right?” Draco tried to push down insecure feelings stemming from First Year rejections.
“Yes, but it’s obvious you’re younger and not him,” Draco pressed.  “It’s clear to anyone that there is a relation but right now nobody knows what that could be. The only Black tapestries are here and Black Manor, which is unoccupied.”
Fenrir was pleased by this, giving him a grin when he noticed he was alright. Jack looked well-pleased too, clapping him on the shoulder for a night well-spent.
Harry frowned. “He is a bit of an egomaniac isn’t he? Surprise on him, I’m a Pureblood. Bully that.”
TW/CW: suicide attempt mention/depiction--nothing too visual but still important to note in case you're feeling uncomfy about it!
Harry felt warm having an adult actually care about his well being instead of shoving him wherever the authorities deemed necessary. He winced as Markus went into action, setting his arm with a crack and wrapping it tightly, noting that he’d need to have someone check on it in a few days. He also fixed up his sprained ankle, which thankfully hurt less, and went on his way.
That seemed to be that. Harry begrudgingly stomped along with them to Diagon Alley. He found himself stopping in his tracks right before the Muggle/Wizard divide, however, unable to bring himself to continue on. Ron, following behind, bumped into him, obviously not paying attention. “Alright, mate?” he asked, noticing his frozen friend. The carefully disguised Auror guard began to look back, not initially catching the stop.
Harry huffed. “What other choice do we have, Hermione?” he asked, beginning to pick at his hands, his new anxious habit that seemed to keep rearing its head. “If we don’t destroy them he’ll always have a way to come back. We need to get rid of
“You did just create a storm in the hallway,” Draco remarked, but didn’t let it go. “The magic incidents have been occurring frequently and you know that. I’m worried about you.”
He closed his eyes and whispered, “Sorry, Dad,” feeling as though he may lose his nerve, but he carried on all the same, just like the day in the bathroom.
“I’m happy for the opportunity it gives me. Sirius doesn’t have to die thinking I hate him. I get to see you and have this rather cheerful conversation.” He nudged Harry, who grimaced. “I feel connected to the living in some way—I can help destroy a madman from the comfort of the Garden. But I can’t go inside the manor. I can’t enjoy a morning tea with Sirius even if I can sit with him while he drinks. I can’t go to Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley or France or London. I can’t have a relationship with anyone. I can’t become whoever I was meant to be. It could feel stifling in that way—no real future when there’s no time.”
“Auror training,” James grinned at him. “No really, he’s okay. Remus has him. It’s not safe to see him right now, I’m afraid. He’s sprouted fur.”
“Harry, no. It’s not solely on your shoulders.” Draco reached up, pulling Harry’s chin to face him. “Fuck the prophecy. You didn’t start this war. You weren’t the one flinging Unforgiveables left and right. Dumbledore grooming you to be a war machine ends here. Focus on healing. We’re going to help you pick up the pieces, I promise. Don’t worry about some bloody war that our parents started years ago.”
Draco just nodded numbly, looking straight ahead. “It was like the wolf was attacking my mind—I’d come to vomiting and disoriented every time. I didn’t think it was killing me, though.”
“Nonsense, he’s always rattling on about how bored he is: he’ll be happy for a lot of visitors. Let’s do this. Remus are you coming?”
Remus only nodded in response. “You just need to avoid him during the fulls, Draco. Which is what you already do in coming here.”
With that, Sirius was gone and he was left alone with his father. As the water warmed, Draco spared a glance at his father, who was now seated at his table. He looked exhausted, dark circles marring his usually smooth skin. He wasn’t even in robes, which Draco found odd. Instead, he was in a simple button down and slacks, much like the last time Draco was in St. Mungo’s.
“I’m not in turmoil—I’m in waiting. Completely different things. But I feel at peace nine times out of ten. The afterlife is the afterlife—it’s an eventuality we all face. We’re not meant to be on the living plane forever. It’s not sustainable. It’s
Draco sat at a bench, suddenly unable to support himself in the shock of it all. “You said the Healers think you died briefly, yeah?” he asked.
Thanks so much for reading--I know you didn't get too much Drarry focus, but the sequel will have much more of that in store.
Draco sat up quickly and cursed when he felt the tear in his chest. He didn’t care, though. “What are you saying?”
Gaining his senses, Draco tried to pull away. “I’m not dying,” he explained, “I’m basically a halfling—healing accident. Let me go, I have to make sure Blaise is alright!” Draco tried to see around Greyback to where Blaise was, feeling the overwhelming urge that time was running out. He felt the healing magic push to his fingers as he struggled in Fenrir’s grip.
James had brought them to the station this year, drawing all the attention to their group. Draco wasn’t really fond of the limelight and knew he was in for a year of stares, glares, and press. He glanced at the third difference, Frances Woolworth, their publicist. She was fantastic at keeping the crowds away from them with small shield spells and sometimes an Auror or two, depending on the situation.
“You’re going to be alright, I promise. We’re going to get you through tonight and Bill is going to take care of you. Don’t give up on me – promise?”
Draco would periodically check in on him, bringing food – Harry assumed Remus was running interference for him, knowing how hard of a time he was having. By dinner, though, everyone had enough of the birthday boy hiding himself away. Ron and Hermione entered the room to retrieve him, sitting on the edge of his bed.
At first. he was shocked to see Zabini there after his initial arrival. The Slytherin had steered clear of Harry the first few days he was back, not wanting to step on any toes. He remembered the anger (and subsequent magical outbursts) the Gryffindor was capable of and wasn’t sure he’d take too kindly to being hunkered down with Draco for so long “unsupervised.”
Bill conjured his Patronus, an Egyptian Mau, and sent out word that Harry was safe. “Do you want to go to the Great Hall? Everyone is gathered there,” he asked.
Dumbledore then explained to Harry how Slughorn had taught Voldemort at school and was the person he confided in about horcruxes in the first place. He told him that Horace had a memory that he was hoarding about the fateful night he told Voldemort about the horcrux, Dumbledore believing that he had told his professor the number of horcruxes he wanted to make. Dumbledore even showed Harry the tampered memory. Harry found himself angry at Slughorn for tampering with something so crucial to the fate of the wizarding world.
“I’m sure she had good reason to keep it from you,” Harry replied. “This channeling business is terrifying, honestly. Maybe she didn’t want to open you up to it.”
Bill shut his eyes for a moment, looking like he was at war with himself. When he opened them again, his eyes were a little duller. “We’re doing alright, considering.” He smiled sadly at Draco. “George has obviously been taking it very hard. I’m just trying my best to be there for him through it all.”
Remus nodded. “We all have one now. So, if you do need to talk someone or if you’re bored out of your skull here, you can just say one of our names into the mirror and we can talk to you, Harry included.”
Draco was not a fighter unless it was for his own gain. Grown in the comfortable habitus of bourgeois life, Draco never fancied himself a follower. Even at Hogwarts, fellow classmates tended toward following him around, willing to fall in line behind him as he orchestrated childhood pranks and taunt against his favorite green-eyed target. The thought of giving up his independence and leadership qualities, like his father seemed to be crumbling towards, was not appealing to the Malfoy Heir.
“I’m sure you don’t.” Draco gave him a warning glare, noticing the flirtation in his tone. “I’m Blaise, and yourself?” he held out a hand for Harry to shake.
Harry frowned. “I spent all of that time with the Dursleys for nothing.” All of that abuse for nothing, Harry thought bitterly. So much for family magic.
Draco, however, was not so fortunate on the lycanthrope side of things. He felt like he was going out of his mind during the full moon, running primarily on emotional response and not being able to speak (unless you counted grunts and growls, in which case, sure). He was in his head enough to know that he shouldn’t roam around unless he wanted to cause further damage to himself, but it only served to make him even more restless. He had slept the entire day after, worrying Remus quite a bit.
He hoped that Draco wouldn’t object to returning home so quickly after a full moon. He knew he would be weary, but he was needed by his misfit family to help pick the pieces back up. The dog Animagus couldn’t help but feel that if Draco were home he would have caught the cheering charms and they wouldn’t be in this mess. It wasn’t fair to himself, but the guilt didn’t seem to relent.
Harry shuddered a little as he remembered the exchange he was about to unpack. “She saw we had the sword of Gryffindor. She must have a fake in her vault because she lost it.”
Harry had been allowed to visit every so often and they’d talk about innocuous things: Quidditch scores, what they were planning on getting everyone for Christmas if they were released in time, Draco’s latest read, if Harry was ever going to finish the Odyssey. They carefully avoided horcrux talk or the bandages still firmly wrapped around Harry’s arms. They most definitely avoided talk about how Draco sacrificed himself for Harry and what that meant. Draco was sure the subject would eventually come up, but not here. Not where there wasn’t really an escape from one another if feelings got too complicated.
“And me, don’t forget me!” James added with a laugh. He wouldn’t be teaching, but spouses were allowed to stay on campus—Harry was extra glad for that.
Harry frowned. “I can’t keep anything down—not even nutrient potions. At first they thought it was anxiety but now they’re running tests to see if they missed anything in the original scan. I’m eating whatever I can but the majority of it keeps coming up—it all tastes like ash to me.” He looked down. “I know I don’t look well.”
Harry nodded in understanding. “No, it’s good. I’d still have Him inside me if I didn’t do what I did.” He squeezed Draco’s hand. “Thanks for this.”
” It didn’t appear as though he had a choice because suddenly he was sprouting fur everywhere and his mouth had turned into a muzzle. Everything was beginning to feel hazy around him as the magic began to take over.
“You’re going to have to deal with the fact that you’re part of the brood now,” Harry commented. “No longer prissy Malfoy and all that.”
Molly looked up from her knitting and offered a forced sort of smile. “We did a bit more cleaning and found it. Do you not like it?”
“It’s alright,” Remus said. “You didn’t. You grabbed hold of your higher senses enough to stop it.” Draco set the mug down and put his head in his hands. “It was just Samhain—it’s going to be okay.”
“Anyway, we didn’t know he was a Halfblood and thought he’d want a Pureblood so we did the most logical thing we could think of.”
“Honey, you aren’t in the Hospital Wing. You’re at St. Mungo’s.” Lucius brushed Draco’s hair back gently. Draco wanted to swipe his hand away but felt too weak.
Remus scratched the back of his neck awkwardly, silently cursing the Dark Lord for leaving him alone to explain something so personal. “So in the 70s there were multiple wars going on, with the Muggles and us. There was a lot of fear associated with that – everyone was feeling like there wasn’t much time. For some of us, like Lily and James, and now Sirius, that was true.” Harry looked very forlorn at that, it was odd to see Sirius’s face twist in that kind of way – he had been taught to school his features from a young age. Remus shook himself again. “Nobody wanted to leave anything behind if they died, especially love. Polyamory was pretty common.”
The misery inside of Harry seemed to be overtaking him. He hated any surface that gave off any sort of reflection—the glossy table they were sat around on the Hogwarts Express was mocking him with Sirius’s face. It was driving him mad.
Sirius sat himself at the edge of the bed, giving Harry’s hand a light squeeze. “Well you can get to know him all you want now.” Harry just nodded tightly at that, not wanting to speak further. “What triggered your anxiety attack, do you know?” Sirius chanced.
Everything was fine until Draco, Ron, and Hermione needed to leave for the Prefects meeting. “Do you guys really have to go?” Harry asked.
Once he finished, he laid flat on his back, staring at the ceiling, letting the moonlight bathe him from the open window. Healer Turner was right, he realized, rubbing his still sore arms. Draco sat next to them and gasped when he looked down. Harry looked to see he had scratch marks and nail prints dug into his forearms. “Peeves?” he guessed, trying to explain how Harry’s arms were suddenly slashed to bits in the middle of the night.
Draco nodded. “It’s weird. I know Harry is down the hall somewhere but I’m not allowed to see him. It feels like I have a detached limb or something.”
Harry, realizing Remus was genuinely upset with him, quieted down. “Sorry,” he said. “I wanted to show Draco my scars and we fell asleep.”
Lucius let out a breathy laugh at that. “You can’t have tea yet. I paged the Healer, though so we’ll see.” He then got serious. “I don’t hate you. The hospital got in contact with us and came as soon as we could. Your mum just stepped out for some food. I’m so glad you’re alright.”
“Am I only good in the summer, then?” Harry was suddenly angry, balling up his fists. The water sitting on Draco’s bedside table began to rattle. Draco was a bit frightened at that: he knew what the Black Heir’s unchecked magic could unleash and it hadn’t been set free in awhile. “You said you’d be here for me, or did you forget?”
As they approached the door, Draco's face was scrunched in confusion. "How could Potter gift the house to the Order? Not exactly related is he?"
Draco glared at Harry. “You’re telling me you wouldn’t feel the same way? Wasn’t long ago you were angry with Blaise for sending me a cloak, was it?”
“What of the Auror guard constantly keeping tabs?” They had become a fixture to the pathways out of the castle, making sure nobody got in or out that wasn’t supposed to.
“It’s okay,” Harry tried to reassure them. “It’s out of me. Apparently destroying the vessel is the only way to get rid of a horcrux. I might have actually died for a few moments it seems. It did the trick though.”
“Add it to your list of apologies,” Sirius quipped. Harry winced. “I’m joking—he’s not going to be cross with you. He’ll be happy you’re getting the help you need.”
The blonde shuffled uncomfortably at that. “I don’t want to make things hard for you. Attaching yourself to a Malfoy isn’t quite in vogue these days.”
“Is Draco okay?” Harry suddenly remembered not seeing him anywhere after the battle had been won. The room began to shake slightly at his realization that Draco might not have made it and he willed himself to remain calm.
“That’s not what I mean, Harry.” Draco said calmly, trying to regain the situation. He tried to switch gears. “Look, the moon is a few days away and I need all of the rest I can get. I don’t fancy getting sick again.”
Harry gave a small smile, thank Merlin. “Yeah, I guess we are, aren’t we? I was afraid to ruin anything for you here.”
Draco frowned. “Shouldn’t I be asking that to you, seeing as you have a new face and all?” he replied. Ron and Hermione looked on warily, probably thinking Draco was poking a bear.
There were murmurs of thanks and they all broke off, ready to explore their new digs. Harry hugged his father tightly goodbye and turned to Draco. “I’m going to check on Ron. See you later?” he asked.
“What are you going to do with his release forms, Malfoy? It’s not like he’ll be spending the holidays with you.”
Hermione started next to him, not expecting to make much conversation during their rounds. “Yes, Malfoy?” she returned, brown eyes wide in anticipation.
Harry blanched, suddenly realizing that he shouldn’t have that much of the gene present if he wasn’t donated a core. “Uh…” he said lamely.
“Better than you, I’m assuming,” Draco replied, sipping at his coffee. “I knocked for five minutes before I realized you had already left.”
The community really resembled city life. They resided in a vast paved clearing with stable buildings and multiple housing developments. In addition, the center of the clearing served as a marketplace and social area of sorts, where the werewolves congregated to shop, socialize, and play games. “It’s really not so different,” muttered Draco. He felt a hand clap on his shoulder and he looked up to see Fenrir grinning down at him.
Harry insisted on following Draco to their room, despite Draco's assertions that he was not made of glass. Once he was safely in bed he expected Harry to leave. Instead, he also decided to rest. "Don't you have friends to yell at, Potter?" Draco drawled.
“We won’t need a guard where we’re going. Technically we won’t be stepping foot outside of Black property.”
“You need to be in father mode, Sirius,” Remus began once they had settled on the back patio, away from prying eyes.
Draco pushed past his godfather who obviously didn’t know what to do with the situation and pulled Harry into his arms and off of the sill. He refused to admit to himself how nice it felt after a few weeks of little to no contact with the Black Heir and focused on calming him down instead. “Hey, it’s okay. I’m here. It’s alright.” Harry, terrified and wild, dissolved into sobs as he buried his face into the crook of Draco’s neck, the flames growing larger. “I got you,” Draco murmured against unruly hair, rubbing circles into Harry’s back. He looked at Snape. “What did you do?”
“It’s going to be okay. I had a vision. I was alive and healthy. It’s just hard waiting when you’re in the thick of it.”
“Good morning 8th years!” Sirius announced loudly, causing McGonagall to flinch. “You may have noticed that you have the mornings free on your schedules: all afternoon classes.”
Harry shook his head. “Not really, no. But I realized that home doesn’t need to be a place. It can rest with a person.” He took a deep breath. “I think you’re my Ithaca, Draco.”
Harry snorted in response. "Oh I dunno, Malfoy. The entirety of our school years together? The countless times you made fun of my friends and I? When you tried to get Hagrid fired? Any of this ringing a bell?"
After approximately five hours and three very strong coffees hand delivered to his person, he finally heard the blissful call of his name. “Sirius Black?” the mediwitch called out. People looked around wildly, realizing an ex-convict was in the room with him and he bit back a sneer as he stood to greet the Healer. Some rumours and scandals were difficult to break away from.
After a long moment, Harry broke eye contact, effectively breaking the momentary spell. “Well, I’m glad you’re here. It’s been boring.”
The next morning, Draco began to show small signs of progress. He was able to sit up without much pain but was unfortunately still bed-ridden and in need of pain potions. He really needed to get out for the holidays if he was going to show Harry the Garden. He knew without a doubt that the Black heir would benefit greatly from being able to speak to his parents after all of this. He should have told him about it. Maybe it would have kept him from trying to reach the other side.
He watched that blonde head disappear for a few minutes before he realized he still didn’t know how to get to his own dorm. Harry had to race to catch up with the first years, still bewildered at the exchange. He listened to Ron rave a little about Hermione being in the same house as them but Harry knew Ron was grateful she was. It made him think back about begging the sorting hat not to sort him into Slytherin. At the time, he had done that because he didn’t want to be anywhere near Draco Malfoy, and sure, he had been influenced by what everyone around him had been saying since he had gotten on the train, but now he wondered if he had been on Slytherin he could have seen his soulmate more often.
“Is Granger your soulmate then?” She followed up, voice lower. He glared at her more vehemently still.
He raced to the owlery the moment it was dawn, aware that he was also pissing off Hedwig by not using her to send his letter, but he knew she would be recognized.
Draco had just finished supper with his mother and was heading up the stairs when he felt a sudden bout of pain in his middle. He bent over on the old oak stairs and almost fell over, grasping onto the railing until his knuckles turned white. His father was locked up in his study, his grandfather had retired to bed early, and he knew mother wouldn’t leave the parlour until midnight; where she stayed as late as possible to avoid any encounters with his father.
Harry also noticed that a few of Draco’s friends were with the team as well. Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini and Millicent Balustrade were backing Draco up, and although neither Millicent nor Blaise looked threatening, Pansy seemed to be glaring right at Hermione, almost willing her to say something.
The air outside was crisp, and Draco felt a strange sense of déjà vu as he stood at the edge of the great lake that morning. Draco had asked Professor Snape what he had meant when he said he did not believe Harry, but the professor had been stone-cold silent as he escorted Draco down to the dungeons.
“Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said Ginny. It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy.
“What about you boys?” She glanced nonchalantly at the Gryffindor table, where, Draco realized, harry wasn’t present. “Care to share your soulmates?” She smiled in what seemed like an uncaring way, but Draco knew that Pansy wanted to know very badly.
“Harry!” he had finally been cornered in the Gryffindor common room after all their classes for the day had been finished. He had paired up with Neville in almost every single one, dodging out of sight in the hallways whenever Ron or Hermione called for him. Harry sighed and turned to face his two best friends.
When Harry Potter was born, his young parents gazed at the beautiful form of their precious baby boy with all the love and adoration in the world. Lily, still sweaty and exhausted from the birth, nestled into the pillows behind her with her son in her arms.
Harry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice:
“Guess she likes the golden boy more than she likes you, Draco.” Draco didn’t realize he had been clutching his wand tightly until Blaise’s hand was on top of his own.
She knew, however, if she did inflict any real damage, it would be traced back to her, and everything she had worked so hard to conceal and protect, especially her son, would be destroyed. So, she walked away, boiling in rage.
“Hi, Ron.” She felt a little guilty she had offered her soulmate no explanation as to why she had been talking to Draco, but it wasn’t like she and Draco had been conspiring on abandoning Harry and Ron and running away together.
on it before tip-toeing to Draco’s side. He climbed into bed quietly, and laid next to Draco, staring out the window into the depths of the great lake.
“Write to me and keep me updated then.” Hermione was also not going to be at Hogwarts for Christmas. She was going to France with her parents. Before Draco could reply, the morning bell rang, and they rushed back towards the castle. They all had Potions together and ran all the way to the dungeons.
Draco shook his head. “It’s not grace. I’m just too exhausted to hold onto any strong emotions right now. We’ve done enough fighting for a lifetime, I think. As long as you’re true to your word and are going to work on atoning, we can try this. Please don’t make me regret this.”
to tell Sirius about this one—of course if he was allowed. “I forgot you worked with Lily at some point.”
Sirius smiled and squeezed Draco’s shoulder. “Absolutely. I’ll take you to see Harry? He’s allowed visitors today.”
Harry laughed. “For what? Saving my life? We’ve been over this, Draco.” He reached over and squeezed the werewolf’s hand.
She handed him a water bottle, which he took gratefully. He would have to remember to bring one next time. “Potter: just the person I wanted to see,” she said with a smile. “Or do you go by Black now?”
“Ah,” said James, “I was wondering when the Unspeakables would arrive. You’re not here to cart me away, are you?”
He felt awkward with his Healer-mandated walking stick: it wasn’t nearly as cool as his father’s and he was much too young to be sporting it but he wasn’t all the way up to snuff yet. They had told him that he should get plenty of rest still, not wanting his core to become damaged again. Remus must have passed it along to Molly because as soon as he was through the door he was immediately led to the large chaise lounge in the sitting room, the matriarch kicking Ron out of his seat.
It was a spot of joy, however, to see the new First Years sorted. Time was moving on from May and old traditions were anew again. Despite Draco’s stress that his house would die out with the bigotry upholding it, there were some Slytherin’s added to the brood, many of which Draco could not determine blood lineage for. It looked like the houses would be changing as well, this time for the better.
Draco had whipped his head back to Blaise during the commotion, suddenly alert. “What are you talking about?”
Ron shook his head. “No, actually.” He made eye contact with Harry, who also looked as though he wanted to jump out of his skin. “I don’t think I can go in.” Harry walked forward and pulled Ron into a tight hug. The war made them all a bit touchy-feely as of late and it helped to be able to have physical touch to remind each other that they were still there together. Ron held him just as fiercely, gripping onto him like a lifeline. “I just know I’m going to see where it happened and I just—I just can’t,” he murmured into Harry’s neck.
Harry wasn’t buying it. He pulled Draco into his arms, standing on his tip toes to properly envelop him.
“Well that’s reassuring, professor. Thanks so much,” Draco replied bitingly. Remus stared at him as if he saw a ghost. Fenrir barked out a laugh.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “How would you even know I want to apprentice here?” he asked, already annoyed with the prickly Healer.
James pulled him into a hug and Harry melted into the warmth. He’d never get over his Dad existing with him again. It was so surreal and he would never take for granted his time with him. “Didn’t you say you were staying with Draco last night?” he asked. Harry blushed furiously at that to which the stag Animagus laughed. “I wasn’t insinuating! I just know he grounds you. I’m surprised you still had a nightmare is all.”
Blaise let out a joyous laugh; it sounded like bells to Harry. He took notice of how a genuine smile on the boy’s face changed his features, making him look less posh and more human. “Not all evil, are we?”
Home. It warmed Draco’s heart that Black Manor was considered his home now, even if the world was still burning around him. Hopefully, when he got back the world wouldn’t be so shaken that the tentative bond he had forged in the lion’s den would still hold—only time would tell.
The Black family tapestry went deeper and was larger than the Malfoy tree. Draco had many lessons on his Black heritage, but was not as intimately familiar with the various shades of character that each member possessed. He was not the Heir – it was not his responsibility. Though, he supposed, he was no longer an Heir of anything. He gripped his Malfoy ring in between his fingers, running over the smooth emerald at the center. Why hadn’t it burned up? he wondered. He searched for his name and face on the vast tapestry, finding it attached to both of his parents. The branch connecting Draco to his father was blackened, but it was not severed. He wondered what that meant. If he were completely disowned, there would be no branch. He had never heard of or seen a blackened branch before. He glanced at the space where Sirius’s name was located. It, too, held a blackened branch. Looking back at his place, he noticed his last name was still on the tapestry. He scrunched his face in confusion. “How is this possible?”
Ron frowned. “I know, but it isn’t fair to either of us. I’m rarely getting a full night’s rest and with the full moon you don’t get any reprieve.” Draco flinched at the mention of the moon. He was okay with Harry talking about it but confirmation from other people was still touchy. Ron seemed to notice and grimaced. “Sorry, but you know I’m right. I know you’re loads better than the summer but magical exhaustion can still get you if you aren’t careful. Bill told me to look out after you.”
“Haz!” he exclaimed as they neared. Harry winced, waiting for more fallout from the incident to arrive, but none came. “We’re going to have to add necromancer to your awe-inspiring list of magical talents. The Boy Who Lived
He handed Harry the potion, who took it and sighed in immediate relief, his injured arm losing some tension. “Thanks.”
Harry just shook his head and smiled. “Nah, it’s alright. I’d rather him have friends, you know? I just don’t want you messing with his head is all—it’s already pretty crazy in there without confusing gifts.”
Draco nodded. “You’re right.” He looked completely distraught still and Harry couldn’t help but pull him into another hug. “This feels like a role-reversal,” Draco commented.
Sirius stood, helping him to an armchair. Remus smiled at him gratefully. “Heard the ruckus?” Sirius asked.
His old schoolmate grinned at him, her brown eyes crinkled with glee. “Could say the same for yourself, James,” she replied.
Draco thought but couldn’t help but feel comfort in the embrace. “How are you feeling? Any eye pain?” he asked pulling back.
Harry didn’t need to be told twice. The water burned his throat as it went down, but it made him feel less disoriented. He looked up at the redhead with sudden remorse. “I’m sorry about—” but Bill just held up a hand.
Draco laughed and slung an arm around her. “Despite you trying to get Haz murdered, I missed you too, Pans.”
Draco laughed into his drink. “I recall you were the one to break it off, Blaise.” His eyes darted over to check on Harry, glad he ditched the glasses for the night so as not to give anything away.
Remus frowned. “He tried to take his life about a month ago.” Sirius gasped involuntarily at that. Remus looked up at his friend in disdain. “He was drinking a lot and it got entirely out of hand. His grades were suffering, he was on probation from Quidditch, and his magic was going haywire. It was out of control. Professor McGonagall cut off his supply when she found out even though Dumbledore didn’t seem concerned. He played perfect student after that.”
Professor McGonagall preached unity, but the distinct lack of Slytherin upper years made the speech lose some of its intention. Blaise, Draco, and Nott were the only three of their year to return, and it looked like Nott was having a hard time simply existing, shunned to the end of the table.
Severus hadn’t ever seen this level of power coming from a newly of-age wizard before. This was out of his hands and it was frightening. “Just breathe, Harry. Push it away. I apologize for feeding into it.”
The Black Heir laughed in response. Draco loved that laugh. “You need to spend less time with Ron. You’ve become obsessed with food.”
“I know. You’re going to have to see a Healer. I know just the one. Get cleaned up, you’re coming with me.”
Draco squeezed his hand in reassurance. “Of course. Now, help me locate the sugar quills that Ginevra tasked me with purchasing. Why she couldn’t send Blaise is beyond me.”
Harry was saved from further embarrassment by a knock at the door. “Ah, that’ll be Eric.” Sirius stood. “We’ll let him in and leave you to it.”
Sirius’s fanatical excuses knew no bounds in trying to keep Harry safe. At first it was, “you need to get your strength up—you’re so thin.” Next, it was, “I already got the cup—there’s no sense going out there with no leads.” This week, it was “this isn’t your war—why do you feel so compelled to end it?” Of course, Harry, growing tired of hiding, frustratingly accused Sirius of being a self-preserving Slytherin in Gryffindor clothing, perhaps even a Hufflepuff when it got down to it, resulting in a never-ending glaring match between father and son.
Sirius nodded. “If it makes you feel any better,” James piped up, “he doesn’t shut up about you, so it’ll be a nice reunion when you do see him.”
“I can’t help it if his constant attention on you is draining for you—not everyone can be an extrovert.”
The Black Heir shrugged. “I can’t keep going on the way it is right now, so I suppose so.” He stared blankly ahead as he said it, face impassive.
Ron laughed. “Mate, if Harry fights Blaise over a cloak we’ll have to personally ship him back to St. Mungo’s.” Draco was silent at that. Ron nudged him with his shoulder. “He’s been doing good. Let him figure it out, yeah?”
Harry grimaced. “I don’t think he had time to fill me in, what with the panic attack and Christmas festivities. It’s been a very long day. So everyone tricked me? That’s not great.” But Harry wasn’t angry, he was surprised to realize. He had finally reached acceptance about his true heritage: he was more confused about the reasoning than anything.
“Sirius told me that in order to get him settled and immersed in his program Healer Turner is only allowing visits once per week,” Remus replied and Draco frowned. He needed to make sure he was still
“I’m sorry,” he said again in earnest. “I thought I’d be back before you even woke, but Madam Hooch stopped me.” He told them about the Quidditch scouts and that he would be helping with open practices to prepare.
The blonde just nodded, feeling a bit helpless. The anxiety suddenly rolled back in waves, crashing over his prior calm. He had to know everything, now. “What else? Who else?
“I know it seems insane to you, growing up with Muggles. Very powerful wizards can become pregnant. Your father was essentially unmatched in magic, except for maybe Sirius. They came from strong, old families. Male pregnancy is common for them.”
He ran to Sirius, Remus, and James’s quarters, praying that Remus wasn’t still at the feast. Sirius was down at the Samhain celebration, but he hoped Remus was home. He began pounding on the door as his body continued to vibrate—was he sprouting fur?
Draco had to physically pull Harry back at that comment, who had suddenly seen red and had leapt in the former Death Eater’s direction. “Harry it’s fine. I
Draco worried his bottom lip, a habit he picked up from Harry. “Not sure, honestly,” he responded, trying to pluck up the courage to step forward.
Sirius walked over and gave him a once over, frowning. “No, no I guess you aren’t, are you? You’re not shiny around the edges like him.” Draco noticed that Sirius wasn’t exactly shiny around the edges either but didn’t question it. “Who are you, then?”
“Are you being safe I hope? You look a little strange” Blaise was one of the only people Draco confided in when weighing asylum. He was decidedly happy when Draco admitted he was going turncoat, Blaise never being one for Muggle hating violent endeavors.
"Stop being so nice to me," Draco bit back. He felt foolish immediately after when he saw Harry recoil a little. "Sorry, it's just messing with my head."
Bill threw his hands up in surrender. “I’m not saying you’re cursed. I also don’t like the harmful rhetoric surrounding werewolf talk. I’m just saying as a curse breaker, I specialize in cases like yours. Now I work in ancient tombs in Egypt, but I did do many clinical hours in the curse damage unit at St. Mungo’s during my studies,
The source of the crash was a man with long hair, currently making a pained wailing sound—there was blood everywhere. “Shite,” Draco realized, jumping to action. “He’s splinched himself.”
Regulus laughed at the name. It sounded identical to Sirius’s bark. “Weird hearing someone around my age call me uncle.” He looked towards Remus. “You can see me, Lupin?”
“You look exhausted,” Sirius remarked when he finally got eyes on Healer Turner. The normally youthful Mind Healer’s eyes were sunken in, his dark hair just as disheveled as it was when he came to the manor a few weeks prior. He was in his Healer’s robes this time, looking quite official.
“I’m going to have to tell Dumbledore about this so we can figure out what to do about the upcoming school year,” Remus interjected, shaking Harry from his spiraling thoughts about Heirdom.
“Thanks for telling me. I wish I could have been here to help.” Sirius pinched the bridge of his nose. “What an awful idea we had, splitting up everyone. Turned out disastrously.”
Draco nodded, closing his eyes once more, succumbing to his weariness. When he next woke he was feeling a bit better and decided he could sit up a little. The fever potion must have done its job well. He saw Harry sitting in an armchair by his bed, quietly reading. "Have you been here all day?" He asked in disbelief.
“Have you considered any post-school prospects yet?” she asked, motioning for him to sit on a bench next to her.
Draco could kick the stone statue of a hippogriff in front of him in frustration. Why wasn’t this working? “Regulus!” he cried out once more.
He couldn’t keep it inside. It just bubbled out of him in rage. Harry’s tone got nastier as he said, “Like I don’t see you pining after my boyfriend day in and day out. You fucked up, not me. You lost him, get over it and stop poking your nose into others’ business.” Blaise looked at Harry in shock and anger. A vase shattered, startling Harry out of his demeanor, but the damage was done.
Harry cut him off. “I’m fine. Everything is fine, I promise. I’ll tell Healer Turner tomorrow at our session and we’ll brainstorm a solution.” He squeezed his father’s hands reassuredly. “The summer program was helpful and I promise it’s not a spiral. I think it’s just being back that’s throwing me off.”
Harry found himself waking up retching yet again from another nightmare. He was beginning to feel bad agreeing to stay with Draco because he would just continue to disturb his sleep. If the blonde was annoyed, though, he didn’t make any indication, just pushed his hair out of his eyes as he sicked up over the side of the four poster.
“Anyway. I’m not sure how he found it in him to forgive me before he died. I’m not sure if he ever did. I wouldn’t blame him. I fell on family association rather than who he was.”
That realization stung for Draco. His father was right—Severus sold him out to keep his place within the Dark Lord’s ranks. Did it really matter, though? “You disowned me.”
Voldemort finally lifted the Cruciatus Curse to focus his full attention on the Malfoy Heir. As he neared Draco, he felt his blood run cold. “Your father does not feel remorse from the normal gamut of punishment, Draco. He is simply too privileged and unaffected to correct his behavior from a simple Cruciatus. For him to get the message, something irreplaceable must be damaged. And I’m sorry to see such pure blood be destroyed by this, but actions must be taken.”
His mother sighed and smiled apologetically at her son. “I suppose it never came up. I try my best to avoid practicing often.”
Harry sighed and laid down beside Draco on the bed, fitting easily between the space between the edge and Draco. He kept his eyes to the ceiling as he said, “I know. I read the letters.”
Draco could not believe he was returning to Hogwarts alongside the other students who had made it out of the war alive. It was a miracle, really, after all they had been through that he, Harry, Blaise, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were quietly sharing a carriage ride approaching the castle. They all were a little worse for wear, with Harry still so thin from the rotting curse placed upon him in the final battle, Hermione’s scarred arm courtesy of Draco’s aunt, Blaise with his walking stick, trying to get back up to par after a core splitting hex, Draco and his two-toned eyes, and Ron and Ginny bearing the crushing weight of sibling loss, but they had made it out the other side and were ready to move on.
“They’ve been moved to a safe house,” Remus supplied. “They weren’t happy about it but they’ve gone into hiding with some of the Order.”
Narcissa nodded knowingly. “It’s difficult to manage at first. With time you’ll be able to block it out when you need to. I must say, though, it is nice being able to commune with those who have passed. Have you been able to speak with Lily?”
“Do you think Professor McGonagall will go for it?” Draco asked. He needed a green light as soon as possible with so much to prepare.
After a few extremely painful minutes where Draco tried to fight his magic despite Remus trying to calm him, a white wolf stood in his place. He sniffed the air. He could smell his mate. He ran at the door, but was headed off by a larger gray wolf. His packmate. Remus, he remembered. Draco huffed at him in annoyance. Didn’t he know he needed to find his mate? His magic was calling out to him. He wanted him to find him. He made to push towards the door again and Remus gave him a warning growl. Draco immediately fell into rank, letting out a low whine and prostrating himself, turning his head to the side in a show of deference to the more alpha wolf. Remus sniffed his neck carefully and then licked his muzzle, letting him know it was alright. He looked towards the door again but Remus gave him another growl. He sighed and curled up. At least it was warm and safe here. It smelled like his pack. Remus curled around him and they soon fell asleep.
“Well.” Potter settled back down in his chair, looking at Draco. Draco forced himself to meet his gaze, forced his face into an implacable mask against the shiver that Potter’s vivid green eyes sent down his spine.
“No-no,” Teddy repeated, wagging his finger in Draco’s face with deep concentration. The bed dipped in his direction as Harry sat down behind him.
The bowl was warm to the touch, and heat emanated off the soup in a pleasant manner. Draco eyed it warily. It looked edible enough, even enjoyable, but… “Is it poisoned?”
Really, Draco only had himself to blame for this rude awakening. He had only himself to blame for his chronic lack of sleep. Merlin, Draco regretted encouraging his mother to talk to Aunt Andromeda so,
It hadn’t occurred to Draco that Potter might be just as lonely as he, rattling around this small cottage.
Potter set the bowl down on the wobbly bedside table, and settled into the chair beside it without waiting for so much as an invitation. Draco was tempted to be petty and force him out, but his stomach grumbled, chasing whatever scathing insults he was going to use out of his head.
“What,” Draco sneered. His elbow hurt, and his muscles were beginning to cramp from staying in the same position for so long. Not that he could move; the box, in addition to cutting off all feeling from his limb, was impossible to move without a wand – which Draco didn’t have.
The soup was delicious. Divine, on par with the delights the house elves would prepare at home. Draco ate it warily, waiting for Potter to cough, or to broach the subject of what he wanted from Draco.
“Draco!” the intruder yipped, poking him right between the shoulder-blades with a bony finger. “Up!”
Draco had cycled through five different safe houses, heavily sedated with Muggle drugs. All he remembered was that one moment, his mother was letting cousin Sirius through one of Malfoy Manor’s many secret passageways; the next, he was blearily waking up, his arm pinned to the bed by the weight of a metal box meant to nullify his Dark Mark.
“Harry, you agreed that you’re a liability in the field – if You Know Who killed you morale would –”
Potter rolled his eyes, holding out a spoon. It wasn’t a soup spoon, Draco noted, but he took it all the same. “I wouldn’t do that,” Potter reassured him. “Not after we’ve gone to all this trouble to keep you alive.”
“I’m bored as hell, Potter,” Draco said, doing his best to sound as snooty as he could, drawing on the seventeen years prior to his forced escape that he had been the Malfoy scion. He pointedly looked at his left forearm. “And I’d prefer not to be trapped laying down again.”
If Draco hadn’t encouraged his mum to talk to Aunt Andromeda, he might not have met Teddy. If he hadn’t ever met Teddy, he never would have had a chance to re-meet Harry.
Draco’s eyes shot open, and Teddy cheered. He looked straight past the brightly-colored Metamorphagus in front of him, focusing on the man in the doorway.
He didn’t look at Potter, instead gazing down at his milky reflection in the thin film of soup left in the bowl. “Or you could stay,” he said, a muttered suggestion.
“A hit, a palpable hit!” Harry cried, as if he knew what he was referencing. “Well, there’s only one way to end this…”
“What?” Draco snapped bitterly. He hated everything about this, except for the lack of Crucios and blind panic and fear… fine, he hated
“Yeah.” Draco eyed the metal contraption around his left forearm with barely concealed distaste. “Thanks, I guess.”
Potter flushed, his cheeks blooming into rosy colour in the way Draco knew many of his pureblooded girlfriends practiced in the mirror. “Oh. Here, let me…” He drew his wand, whispering,
Potter hadn’t truly looked at Draco in some time. Draco had forgotten how exhilarating it was, to have his full attention.
It was a bullshit argument — Draco knew that, Harry knew that, hell, even Teddy probably knew that — so there wasn’t much weight to Potter’s words. But when Harry cupped Draco’s chin in his hand, leaning in for a kiss, Draco couldn’t help melting.
“I brought…” Potter lifted the bowl in his hands, an ugly ceramic thing that was probably a castoff of the Weasleys’. Merlin. What had Draco’s life come to?
“... have to stop fighting the real war, because the adults decided they wanted their jobs back, and now I’m stuck with
He was so immersed in his wallowing that he didn’t realize the argument in the other room had ended, and the Wonder Twins had left, until there was a sharp knock at the door. He jumped, hissing when the tender inside of his elbow clipped the metal. “Come in.”
“Draco!” the toddler who had thoroughly conquered his life whined. “Up!” The poking had turned into pinching, and Draco knew that his blankets would be stolen next.
Neither Aunt Andromeda nor Draco’s mother had attempted to intervene. Rather, they sat on the patio, sipping tea and watching with a great deal of amusement. Teddy had stayed on Aunt Andromeda’s lap, watching with wide eyes, until it had gone on far too long to satisfy his short attention span. He had slipped off of his grandmother’s lap, and toddled over to Potter and Draco, his hair flashing through black, blue, and purple before finally settling on Draco’s white-blond. When he looked up, his eyes had been bright green, and Draco had felt –
“Yes, Harry?” They were quite alone in the entire compartment, save for a few people who purposely stayed as far away from Hagrid as possible.
“You’re lucky almost everyone’s gone home for the holidays.” Draco sighed. “Just let me know beforehand so we don’t get caught, okay?”
“Aren’t you a smart one, then.” The woman said kindly. “Don’t stop and don’t be scared or you’ll crash into it. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.” But Harry didn’t feel nervous at all, just a little excited.
"Marlene!" He heard her squeal happily just as Remus came back out of the kitchen with a butterbeer.
“Lady Malfoy is in the garden, Sire.” Dobby disappeared before Lucius could inquire more. The garden, ofcourse. Narcissa spent more time in there than anywhere else. He smiled fondly to himself as he got up to get dressed. He still remembered brining her to the Malfoy mansion for the first time, the way she had glared at all the hedges and flowerless gardens and told him she was going to grow roses in them.
“The dark lord has told me of the importance of having more pureblood children in the world today.” Lucius offered as an explanation. He stood up and circled her, and she felt none of the romance nor anticipation she used to with him. Only cold dead fear.
“Yes. He even had a bite on his leg. AND he tried to kill Harry at the quidditch match.” Ron glared at the fire.
“Lily, I shouldn’t be your secret keeper.” Sirius hurriedly whispered as Mooney disappeared. His voice was drowned by Harry’s squealing, so James didn't hear either. Lily looked startled as she tore her gaze away from her husband and son. The secret keeper talk had only just begun, not even in serious motion yet.
“It’s going to kill someone!” he shouted, and ignoring everyone’s bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps —
“It’s been alright. I have way too much homework to do.” Harry scrunched up his face when he thought of his first transfiguration essay due the next week. “Did professor McGonagall give you guys an essay too?”
“You know, it rings a sort of bell,” said Ron slowly. “I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once . . . might’ve been Bill. . . .”
Ginny didn’t know what she was doing. She didn’t know why Tom was being so persistent. Her head felt full and her limbs felt like logs as she stood in the girl’s lavatories on the second floor. She watched without really seeing as the sinks moved apart to open the chasm below. She watched without seeing with the diary clutched in her hands as something big slithered up.
“No. She wasn’t at lunch either.” The two boys situated themselves towards the back as they watched students filter in through the doors. Ron looked away when Hermione came in as well. “A note came for you during lunch by the way.” Ron handed Harry a folded piece of parchment that contained Hagrid’s invitation to tea.
Sirius had told him not to worry about it, kissing the top of his head gently as Remus toted him, Draco, and the rest of the kids off to King’s Cross with a fleet of Aurors. Sirius, for obvious reasons, did not join them. Nobody really knew he was alive and although there had been proof submitted to the Ministry of his innocence, the process was slow-going. It was best to lie low. He rubbed his face tiredly as he saw them off, wishing he had more time with Harry.
Draco let out a breathy laugh. “Me too. Let’s wait until we’re both stitched back together to try that again, yeah?”
Blaise set his own tome down. “I mean, you’re exhausted. You need to rest up before going back out there and he’s attached at the hip. Anyone can see you’re completely spent.”
James was caked in Harry’s blood as he ran through the manor, screaming Sirius’s name. Sirius, finally hearing him, came bounding down the stairs in dog form, quickly shifting back when he saw the scene.
“He’s alive.” Draco sagged with relief. So he lived without his aid. Harry would be smug about that one. “He’s in the hospital under a stasis charm while they make repairs. He got hit with a core severing hex.” Draco flinched, his hand immediately going to his chest. He knew how badly that hurt.
Harry sniffed, wiping the tears from his face as he mentally told himself to get a grip. This was supposed to be a happy moment. “It’s kind of a long story.”
Harry frowned. “I hope so.” He looked at his uncle, perpetually stuck at 17 years old and his heart ached. He was always in bright spirits despite his circumstances. He never bemoaned the Garden. “Are you happy here?”
Sirius held his hands up in mock surrender. “I’m not here to yell at you, Haz,” he said, sitting on the sofa next to him.
Bill squeezed his shoulder in comfort and Harry latched on to the feeling, trying to stop the panic bubbling out of him. “He’s there to help with his transformation issue he’s been having. Fenrir said the halfling status was slowly killing him so he had to reopen the bite—he’s alright, he’s with Jack. He’s safe.”
Draco folded into himself at this, feeling small and alone suddenly. He was going to die around strangers and family enemies, he realized. What had he done? What had his father done to him? "I think we can fix it though." Bill smiled and gripped Draco's arm reassuringly. Draco looked up in surprise. "I've actually worked on a similar case before. If we make the vampire gene a little stronger, your body will stop attacking itself."
“Bill’s on the case.” Draco changed the subject quickly, not wanting to think about the dark magic lingering in his body. “Thanks for the mirror—happy to be able to annoy any of you at any time now.”
” Draco ground out as Fenrir pierced the exact spot he bit all that time ago, his mind exploding in searing pain. His arm was burning white hot, the reopening of an old wound, and Draco couldn’t imagine how Fenrir believed this was
They gave Lucius a bunch of forms to look through. Draco bit back a comment about him not needing them, seeing as he was disowned and all. He just watched Lucius nod and ask a bunch of questions, tuning most of it out. He looked bad. His eyes were sunken in and his hair was a mess. He wasn’t even wearing a robe (something Draco never saw); instead he was in simple black slacks and a dark green button down. He wondered what was happening back at the Manor. He wanted to see his mum desperately, trying to fight sleep so he could say hello. This was to no avail, he realized as he closed his eyes and tuned out the world again.
That gave some comfort to Draco—Blaise was right. Voldemort wouldn’t be able to contain his glee if Harry had been defeated. “I suppose. I just wish I could help somehow.”
“I’d rather not chance it in a time of immobility.”  He looked over at James with a wry smile. “Besides, I wouldn’t want Remus to have to psychologically deal with turning someone—I think he’d lose it.”
“Please, Draco, don’t be so dramatic. It’s only an official disownment. You’ll still have your inheritance, of course.”
“Draco, don’t—” Remus warned but it was too late, Draco was already digging his fingers into the man’s shoulder blade where the severing occurred. He was able to stitch him up nicely but it totally drained him of energy. He sat back on the chair, exhausted.
“I’m so glad you’re okay,” James said. “It was utterly terrifying to watch it unfold and not be able to help.”
Remus shook his head. “No but I think it’s because they’re Animagi and the wolf recognizes their counterparts as part of the pack. Harry isn’t an Animagus and he has werewolf blood. Your wolf wants to help him along: make him a part of your family.”
She nodded at him curtly in response, not meeting his eyes. The two have never made amends, to which Draco was at fault. He’d have to find a way to ignore his pride and apologize to her at some point.
“I think it would be obvious if I wasn’t with the moon so close, don’t you think?” Draco responded curtly.
The two settled into bed together, Draco sidling up to the furthest corner, with little success. Harry hesitantly curled up against him, sending chills up the werewolf’s spine. “Thanks, Draco,” he whispered.
Sirius just laughed. The Garden had healed him quite nicely, Draco noticed. He looked so young: shoulder length hair falling easily around him, tip-top physique, no prison markings in sight. It was like he was reverted back to his pre-war photographs. “You look so young,” Draco blurted out, unable to keep his thoughts in check.
Harry sighed. “It’s really complicated. Ron left, upset that we weren’t making enough progress, so Hermione and I moved camp. There was a Patronus of a doe and I followed it. It led me to the sword.”
It was James’s turn to shrug. “Odd. Starving. I suddenly have a pulse and am compelled to inhale and exhale after 17 years of that not being an issue.”
“I kind of like it like that,” Sirius commented, finally coming to life after seeing Harry cleaned up and safe.
Regulus smiled wryly at his nephew. “He’ll try his best, I assure you. Seer is quite protective when he wants to be.”
“Wonderful. I’ve also requested you as my next mentee beginning next week, so you’ll be helping prepare the sessions with me. I hope that’s alright.”
At that, Remus grabbed a piece of toast off the table and sat down, ignoring the teens. Draco looked around at the shocked faces and shrugged, joining Remus at the table. Harry,
“It’s not my fault you’re so enthralled with your own visage. Why don’t you just marry yourself?” Harry plopped down on his bed, propping open his beaten up copy of the Odyssey.
Now it was Blaise’s turn to be done. Of course, there was some pent up bitterness between the two—how could they be so naïve? “Fuck off, Potter. Draco is my best friend—you abandoned him to play hero. You weren’t here for the endless nights of tears and self doubt, yet he still loves you and welcomes you with open arms. You hurt him—any wedge driving is by your doing alone, not by me just trying to help you rest so you can kill the maniac that ruined all of our lives.” How could he be so stupid to think things would ever be alright between himself and Potter? He was sending bloody courting gifts to his boyfriend for Merlin’s sake. Blaise stood, ready to stalk out of the room when Harry surprised him.
Harry flinched at the term as Draco delivered a warning glare to Blaise. “Fear of death doesn’t mean you should roll over to evil.”
Remus frowned. “I dunno, maybe sometime. I think I’d be devastated for it not to work. I’ll just wait until Christmas.”
Harry shook his head in protest. “No, he was sprouting fangs. Something is really wrong with him,” Harry insisted, pushing at his father. “Merlin, you’re strong.”
“Oh good. So you can speak it to the living, then?” Draco replied with a wry smile and Harry’s cheeks reddened.
“Many students manage to sneak beverages into the castle, Minerva. Mostly schoolboy antics, wouldn’t you think? I recall his fathers doing the same.”
They were all silent for a few moments after that, understanding the gravity of what Remus was saying. Harry was beginning to feel ire towards his Headmaster: there was always some sort of twist or speedbump that had been hidden from him. It was becoming increasingly obvious that he was more of a pawn to Dumbledore than a person. He couldn’t stand it.
James walked into the room as Draco cried out again—it felt like his insides were at war. “What’s going on—oh shite. Got it—I’ll let Pads know too. Good luck!” he bolted out the door and cast a series of locking and protection spells before taking off to stop Harry from bursting in.
Fenrir’s humor died as he looked on in concern. “You weren’t going to survive the next moon—I could feel
Harry kept taking glances at the doors of the Great Hall, half expecting Ron to return to the scene and wishing that he had just gone with him. The tension throughout the feast was palpable, with only the new First Years unaware of the ugliness that this room once held.
He turned to the newly minted Black, trying to see Harry’s old face through it. He chose to focus on his eyes which were exactly the same as before. “I’m sorry. The wolf doesn’t let me control my emotions the way I used to. I’m still learning.”
Draco nodded. “My aunt would probably go spare knowing that her Ancient and Noble House was being utilized as a safehouse for the Light.”
Remus frowned. “Scratching his hands?” The Healers had warned him to watch out for new tics—this seemed to be one of them.
Harry sighed, releasing Draco to rub his face tiredly with his hands. “Are you sure you want to know? Trust me, it’s not that fun hearing a prophecy about yourself.”
Draco downed it begrudgingly, side eyeing the werewolf all the while. “I’m not a martyr,” he said stubbornly.
Harry nodded. “Good. I really don’t fancy hearing about my cheering charm mishaps in the Prophet.” Then he suddenly realized: “How am I to attend the trials and funerals if I’m stuck here?”
Sirius nodded knowingly, taking the vials and placing them in the First Year cupboard. “You’re quite inseparable lately. Ah, young love.”
But Greyback only shook his head: “No, I can smell it—you’re not going to last much longer. I can fix it.” Greyback then opened his mouth wide, jaw almost unhinged, leaning close to Draco as his canines descended.
"You aren't going to be a vampire, Draco. We're just going to up the genetics a little. You wouldn't even let me explain without dramatically trying to flee."
So, Harry waited until the full moon began to rise to quietly make his exit. Sirius was upstairs with Remus and he wouldn’t be the wiser. It might be weeks before he figured out what had happened and by then he would be so used to seeing Harry in the Garden it wouldn’t even matter anymore. Anything to make the nightmares stop and the emptiness feel more like calm.
“He’s okay but I haven’t seen him yet. I came home to get changed and go back. I hate to ask you this but is there any way you can get Draco today? They’re holding Harry in a long stay after he gets out of the trauma ward. He needs help. Draco grounds him better than anyone else.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Whatever. Just don’t make me have to give my boyfriend detention later, okay?”
“What’s happened to me?” he groaned. “Is Harry okay?” There was so much blood that night it was hard to believe he was somehow alive.
“Haz!” Remus exclaimed, pulling him into a hug as Harry walked into the room, waving someone off from outside. “Didn’t expect to run into you today.”
Instead of leaving, Harry stepped fully into the room, observing the situation. "If you're ailing with a fever all night it becomes my problem to worry about," he quipped, stepping closer. Draco really wanted him to leave.
“Sort of. He’s a bit older than me. He was already a teenager when I showed up, making him more quasi uncle to be honest.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed at the mention of the magic suppressant. “I know it’s for the best, but I feel vulnerable. There are still followers out there looking to take me out. It makes me nauseous to think that I won’t be able to protect myself.”
Harry’s eyes flashed dangerously. “You’d be surprised. Just back off, okay? I thought Slytherins knew when to back down from a threat.”
“I’m holding open practice sessions to help interested Seventh and Eighth Years prepare for the scout visit. Tuesday and Thursday nights: are you interested?”
would have a field day with this as soon as word got out—they would have to prepare for an incoming media storm.
Sirius frowned but nodded, eyes still scanning the treatment page—it was quite extensive. He looked up. “Have you discussed any of this with him yet? You should know that he doesn’t like being left out of the loop—he’s dealt with that too much in his life, already.”
“Wow,” was all Harry said. All of that guilt and pain and it didn’t even matter. Sirius was going to come home. Harry was so happy he didn’t even care about the past seven months. “I can’t believe this.”
“I just know it’s tough watching your kid go back to school,” she said honestly. Sirius smiled gratefully at her.
Sirius looked down. “I understand—but it’s different when you’re on the other side of this—your parents were right to try and keep us out.”
“Draco isn’t here, I’m afraid,” Harry joked back. Sirius’s eyes lit up a little at the levity of the conversation. It had been a tense time and any bit of humour helped.
Sirius shrugged. “I was planning on keeping a fire, maybe light a few candles. Nothing major.” He turned to the only Slytherin in the room. “Were you thinking a traditional moonlight ceremony, Draco? Or did you want to have it in the Common Room?”
“Speaking of Chosen Ones, ours locked himself in the bathroom and won’t get out,” Draco blurted, not one for subtlety this early in the morning. The older werewolf shot up at that, instantly alert. “Care to help me pry open the door?”
“Do I tell him about knowing? I don’t think they told him what’s going on: violates patient-Healer privileges doesn’t it?”
“We love Healer Turner,” Sirius interrupted. “Harry has been wanting to visit our garden. He’s getting a bit restless stuck in bed all day. Would that be alright?”
Sirius nodded. “It’s a family story, passed down from generation to generation. It’s like the Beedle and Bard stories, but a little more personalized. In the story, the Lord loses his daughter in a horrible accident, and she is fated to spend eternity in the Garden of Souls as a young girl. The Lord cannot accept this, and in his grief goes into the Garden and slits his wrists.” Harry winced at the similarities of how he tried to leave the living plane. “He bleeds out into the Garden and dies, but his sacrifice so moves Mother Magik that she blesses the family with the return of the young daughter to the other side of the Veil.
Blaise gave an uncharacteristic eyeroll. “Draco is queerer than a silver galleon, he was never your boyfriend—ow.” Pansy had kicked him from under the table, a smile in her eyes. Blaise stood. “Let’s get away from the crazy, shall we?” He held out his arm to Harry, who reluctantly took it.
Quick warning about the chapter and the way the plot is going to go: very rollercoaster like with ups and downs and alcohol. It will get worse before we get to the garden. The next chapter will be pretty intense.
When he met Draco for their Hogsmeade date, he didn’t speak of the possibility that he was not only a Seer but a Medium as well. He would rather not worry the Slytherin until it was confirmed. He did tell him he would try Dreamless Sleep again tonight, though.
As the night wore on, Harry’s cheering charm wore off, making him feel winded and empty. He nursed his whiskey glass, happy nobody was going to take his vice for the night, and when they came back home, he crashed hard.
Another difference. Harry’s hand firmly interlocked with his own, the Black-Potter Heir maintaining a tight grip as they navigated the station as if he were afraid of letting go. His hair was newly cropped much to Sirius’s disdain and he was still on the thinner side as he continued to recover from the rotting curse placed on him, but he was still unmistakable, turning heads and causing whispers as they made their way to the platform.
“I can take them up,” Sirius said. “It’s no trouble and you need to stay here for the ceremony, Headmistress.”
They didn’t have much time to chat as Sirius approached them as soon as he entered the Hall. “Lo’, Dad,” Harry said.
When they entered the meeting room, the sudden silence took Harry aback. They were all seated at a large table, staring up at him, conversations ended abruptly. He scanned the room seeing the Weasleys, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Kingsley, and others just gazing at him.
As Harry concentrated on filing the reams of paper in the Gryffindor Common Room into neatly labeled cabinets, the chaos in the room began to die down. Over several minutes of deep breathing and concentration, with Sirius interjecting with encouraging words, the objects slowly found their resting places, as did Sirius and Harry as they reached the ground. Harry opened his eyes, finally, looking up into his father’s, who still had some height on him despite the growth spurt. It was quiet in his mind once again. He let out a sigh of relief. “How’d you do that?” Harry asked, laying back onto the bed in pure exhaustion.
Harry had spent much of his time in the garden, choosing to speak to the dead rather than those alive and around him. The first time he re-entered the garden, he sat down with James, calling out a weak “Dad,” as his voice wasn’t used to sounding. James was at his side immediately, enveloping him in a tight embrace.
” he yelled, immediately alerting others as to where he was. Suddenly, wands were pointed at him. “Fuck,” Draco ground out as he began casting hex after hex,
When Draco arrived at Grimmauld Place, everyone was already there to greet him. Hogwarts had let out a few days prior to his release from St. Mungo’s, but Draco was looking forward to having the rest of the month off of class to catch up on reading and enjoying a non-hospital bed.
Draco couldn’t answer and that was all Blaise needed for confirmation. He hugged Draco tightly. “It’ll be alright. Let me know if you need to snog out your frustrations.” Draco gave a chuckle at that.
Draco awoke after about an hour, tucked in his bed with a glass of water awaiting him on his night stand. As he reached for it, he wondered if he had lunar fever and that he had hallucinated the return of Harry. It would make sense—the full moons as of late had kept him out of head entirely yet fully awake. It would justly follow that he’d eventually go mad.
Ron sighed. “My parents wanted us to integrate with the more secular traditions but they still keep an altar. I want to pay respects to Fred but I need some help. Will you take part with me?” Ron asked again.
Harry. He’s perfectly fine sans a weakened arm for the time being. Fenrir is overly-cautious but I’m sure Draco can only benefit from being with the pack.”
Remus rubbed his face in his hands, clearly at some sort of mental breaking point. “Because I’m so tired of the universe rewarding you and Haz for reckless behaviour, even if I’m glad for the outcome each time. I just want one normal day where nobody I love goes charging into something insane, but I’m beginning to believe that’s too much to ask.”
Bill frowned. “I’m sorry that you can’t see him just yet. Remus is going to collect him when he can. Seamus is going to get a Healer to come in and check you out.” He nodded at Seamus who left to find someone available.
“Are the Dursleys safe?” Harry asked instead. He seemed suddenly determined after weeks of being lost.
Remus could see where Sirius was coming from. He had to look past the young face to see the 36 year old underneath. He knew he wanted to help. “You need to approach him carefully, okay? He could be manic right now.”
Another laugh and then back to business. “So other than the fact that you haven’t had a decent steak in 17 years, you’re feeling pretty normal?”
“Yes, love,” Draco replied in almost a bored tone. They have had this conversation six times already this week. “You should stay with your Dads tomorrow night to keep an eye on you in case you suddenly wolf out."
Healer Jacobs was clearly a seasoned professional, especially considering she worked in the Anomalies wing where only the rarest cases showed up. However, even she was somewhat wide eyed as she ran James through a gamut of exams, having him drink strange potions, and provide her with historical facts about his family and the events surrounding his death.
The bed rest was terrible the second time around, Draco had decided. He wanted to be working towards recovery and once again he was forced to “get lots of rest” and “take it easy”. Ever since turning all Draco ever was was ill, it seemed. He couldn’t stand it.
Hemione had a firm grip on his hand. Ginny was leaning on Blaise—a new development post-war. It was nice they found each other, Draco mused. He supposed they did spend quite a bit of time cooped up together before last year, and Ginny was more Slytherin than Gryffindor when it came down to it. He was happy Blaise was happy, and even gladder still that he was alive.
Before his resolve could crack he gave the fireplace a good wrap with his wand, muttering the spell “
Harry laughed and wrapped his arms around Draco. “You think they’ll be mad if I’m out of bed tonight?”
Harry’s face scrunched up in anguish. “I know that, I really do—I just know you all have burdens on your plate too. I didn’t want to add to it—we’re all tired after this…I just, I dunno, I wanted peace, I guess. I couldn’t sleep and it was killing me—I figured why not just help it along. I didn’t want to worry you or Remus or anyone.”
Night soon fell and Draco was sleeping while his parents watched over him. Remus ducked his head in to check on him. “Was he in terrible pain?” he asked.
“Tell me about it,” Draco sighed, thinking back to his mother’s letter. “So I have to see him again?”
He woke up to arguing the next time. He didn’t open his eyes or make any motion that he was awake again, even though his limbs were crying out in agony. His pain potions must have worn off. His father and what sounded like Remus seemed to be having it out.
People were beginning to catch on to their relationship as well. It wasn’t like they were exactly hiding it, with Harry spending more time in the Prefects wing than the Gryffindor Common Room, but Draco almost missed the secrecy surrounding the two—the what ifs overshadowing the reality of the situation: he had become romantically involved with his father’s mortal enemy. All of the bravery about the situation seemed to remain in his room at St. Mungo’s, leaving Draco feeling vulnerable and exposed.
sorry. I can’t believe I didn’t catch on. I knew you were hurting but I thought we had a handle on it.”
“You haven’t lost it. You’ve just been holding a lot in.” Draco nudged him gently with his shoulder. “It’s a lot to take on.”
“Barely,” Draco sniffed, but he was smiling. “I’m sorry I’ve been on top of you constantly—I just missed you.”
Remus looked at Draco in realization. “I think you’re on to something. I’m going to have to check if there are any journals left behind. For now, though, we have to carry on.”
“Tomorrow,” Healer Markus provided. “If everything goes smoothly, we’ll have you out of the hospital in about a week.”
“You’ll notice,” Sirius announced, drawing silence from the group, “that there are five archways, each with their own symbol. The archway with the Hogwarts crest leads you to your rooms. This is the old Prefects wing and you will each have your own sleeping space, I’m sure you’re happy to learn.” There was a flurry of excited chatter at that. Draco wondered if they would give him his old room back. He also wondered if this was to help with his transformations, or if he would go somewhere with Remus for them. “Your names will be on the doors and your trunks have already been delivered to your room. The remaining archways, each with a symbol representing a House, will take you to your House Common Rooms.” Draco remembered this from his time here in Sixth Year. “Only House members will be allowed to use the archway to their respective Common Room and only Eighth Years have access to the archways. The only other way to obtain access to both this dorm and the House dorms is through invitation. Do
“I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,” snapped Mr. Malfoy.
Harry woke up on Wednesday feeling miserable and empty. He glanced over at Ron’s bed almost instinctively and sighed when he noticed that the curtains were drawn tightly around Ron’s bed. He stared out at the school grounds for a while before groggily getting out of bed. No one in the boy’s dormitory was up yet, and Harry made no sound as he went about getting ready for the day, pulling on a knitted Gryffindor sweater over his school shirt because he felt a bit chilly.
the entire Slytherin team was holding. He felt angry, he felt like Draco had bought his way into the team, but he knew how well Draco had played quidditch when they used to fly together, and he knew Draco was capable of holding his own in the pitch.
“I will tell you something about myself, miss Granger.” She did not wait for the girl to respond. “I was raised by my mother, who was as muggle as they come. She was a Professor, though.” That caught Hermione’s attention, which pleased Irma. “Yes, she was a professor at a very well esteemed muggle university, and our house was always overflowing with books.” Hermione Granger had now stopped crying and was listening with rapt attention. “My mother was also from a very well-educated muggle family that regarded knowledge above anything else.” She smiled when she thought of her mother and their old house in London.
“I also heard Sirius is testifying for you. Wonder how you managed to do that after what you did to him a little over two decades ago—that was fun to find out, by the way. My father: bigot
"Enough." Ron was cut off and he swallowed uncomfortably. "You are all probably driving Molly spare with the endless bickering. If Harry wants to be alone, give him space." Harry grinned triumphantly at that. "And if Ron and Hermione want to ask how you are, don't respond with insults and anger. They just care about you. Be happy for who you have."
“It’s not so much Remus I’m worried about as his other friend,” Draco replied carefully, not wanting to divulge too much without Harry’s opinion.
“Merlin,” Sirius breathed, suddenly standing. “That’s Regulus. R.A.B.: Regulus Arcturus Black.” He let out a breathy laugh. “That insane child. That impossibly ridiculous child.”
“I’m just glad you found him, mate,” Ron said. “I don’t have any freaky healing magic that would have helped him.”
“I’m not sure she acted alone. When James found out he was having you Lily insisted we couple off for protection. The Dark Lord couldn’t get to all of us if we were spread out. James took a leave with the Aurors and went into hiding with her. When you were born everyone was so happy; Sirius and I were happy to even be considered quasi uncles. We never questioned it – which strikes me as odd.” Remus was now frowning as well.
Narcissa made a quick exit too, muttering something about food and that she would return soon, kissing Draco on the forehead and leaving with Remus.
Harry laughed. “Madam Hooch, this is the most excited I’ve been all term. Thank you for thinking of me.”
Remus dropped the Prophet on his lap one morning as he handed him some tea. “I don’t really fancy the news, right now, Remus. Aren’t I already in enough pain?”
Draco willed the magic away from his fingertips that jumped into action at the mention of his friend being hurt. “Can I help?”
Quick reminder that this story isn't a how-to book on dealing with friends/family members who are struggling with depression/anxiety/suicidal thoughts/alcoholism. My characterizations are far from perfect and I am in no way advocating you getting angry with people who are obviously crying out for help. This is a story--perfect behavior on the part of friends would 1) make this unrealistic as nobody is perfect and this stuff is generally messy, especially if you are a teen and 2) would not advance the plot in the way I envisioned. If everyone was perfect, Harry would never have been sent to unloving relatives and wouldn't be involved in a war since 11 in the first place.
“Thank Merlin,” Jack said in relief. He squeezed Draco’s shoulder affectionately. “I have to get back but I’m so glad we finally got this solved. I hope we’ll see you soon.” Draco smiled at him in thanks.
The manor was eerily quiet. If Draco concentrated (which was difficult considering his splitting headache), he could hear the sound of the kettle in the kitchen, someone (Blaise, he thought) pacing back and forth a few rooms down, and a shower running down the hall in Harry’s room.
Draco was getting nervous as he led him through the large French doors and into the garden. How would Harry react to all of this, he wondered. He knew it would eventually be a good surprise but he knew how fragile the dark-haired teen was. He didn’t want to stir anything back up.
Sirius was the first to shake himself from shock. “Ron and Hermione are at the Burrow: it’s not safe there for you to be there right now and I’m not taking any chances,” he replied nonchalantly, though he was not surprised to hear Harry suddenly speak after weeks of self-imposed silence. Draco jumped at Harry’s voice as though he heard a ghost.
Sirius squeezed Harry’s hand gently. “Oh, but you did, and were way too young to be doing so. You were willing to throw everything away for the sake of protecting the magical community. You were fated to complete an ugly task and you did so with flying colours. You bled into the Garden, and while I wish you hadn’t, your father has returned and for that I cannot be sad or angry. You both get to live now—She has deemed it so.”
Harry laughed in response. “Your parents saved my life on at least three occasions. Despite Lucius’s long list of faults I do think he’s changed or at least changing.” He placed a soft kiss to Draco’s temple. “Plus, they made you. Can’t be all bad.
"Ah," the blonde responded, "now you're speaking Slytherin." Harry's eyes snapped open and they settled on Draco with a glare. He raised his hands in defense. "I'm not saying that's a bad thing, Potter. Snake in residence here, remember? It's okay to be selfish with your feelings sometime. You just lost someone – really lost someone. It's okay to not be okay. Nobody should force you into not owning that." Harry's glare turned into something more of confusion. Draco realized he just genuinely gave Saint Potter advice and shook his head to snap out of it. "I'm going to go eat before this gets any weirder," he said, leaving the room and the puzzled Boy Who Lived behind.
The blonde interrupted him. “I know. I can’t put you through the malaise. Besides, we need Bill.” Draco looked down. “I’ll manage,” he sighed.
Dumbledore settled into his seat with his own cup of tea, observing Draco behind his half-moon spectacles. “Why do you feel the need for asylum, Draco?” he probed.
He gently lifted Draco’s arm, who whimpered in pain but otherwise made no protest. Fenrir lifted the bandages slightly and winced. “How bad is it?”
The blonde’s heartrate picked up as Harry explained what was going on. How could the initial scans have missed this? Would this be permanent? Would Harry just fade away without anyone able to do anything about it? It was maddening. “A rotting curse?” he finally managed to ask, gripping on the mirror’s handle for dear life. He desperately wished he knew where Harry’s room was.
He reached out and asked “Can I?” At Draco’s nod, Harry let his fingers roam softly over the crescent shape. Draco closed his eyes as Harry’s fingers lingered over the bite, his cool skin feeling nice against his arm. “Is it bad that I feel a little better that you have a mark too?” Harry asked.
Draco nodded in recognition. “I know—they used to use those for their defense club. It’s how we found out where they met. Hermione’s brilliant to have thought to give you one.”
Draco leaned back into his pillows. His life was beginning to feel like a constant holding patten and he was beginning to tire of it. “Fine. Are you going to run tests today?”
It was nearly 5 PM. He had really slept the day away. To be fair, there wasn't much else he could do with the eldest Weasley son prescribing him bed rest while he waited out the moon. Nevertheless, his mother would never let him sleep all day. He wondered if Severus could pass her a message without getting caught. Where was he lately, anyway?
Harry sighed a little brokenly. “There’s just so much evil in the world and it weighs on my chest constantly. I need to end it. It has to be me.”
Fenrir sat opposite of Draco at the dining room table where he was currently whining. “Leaving won’t change who you are now.” Draco’s eyes began to well up as full realization took hold. “I don’t want to keep you from leaving if you want to go. I worry what your first moon will bring if you don’t stay.” At Draco’s silence, Fenrir continued. “My pack lives well. We don’t want for much that we can’t achieve by ourselves through our connections and wherewithal. You will not suffer here. You can still go to school – Dumbledore has a deal with our pack.”
The Great Hall looked like it had never seen a day in battle, but the energy from that day was still palpable and filled Draco with dread. However, the malaise would not stop him from helping his friend.
Harry huffed out a breathless laugh. “Me too. They put a dampner on me though and it’s making me feel like I’m walking through water. My magic is really volatile, they said, and I can’t get better if my magic keeps creating barriers for me.”
Draco wasn’t so sure. He was sure, however, that he was not looking forward to his Sixth Year in the slightest. Too bad it was just around the corner.
“Yes, let’s move on,” Remus replied, the other three attempting to stave their laughter. Ron was wiping a tear from his eye rather dramatically while Hermione had the decency to look ashamed. “Harry,” Remus began again, changing the subject, “your sixteenth birthday is in a few days, are you excited?”
The days filled with near unbearable classes coupled with the whispers and stares surrounding him at all times has caused his nights to be reserved for scrounging for alcohol, potions, or other vices that would allow him to forget himself for awhile. He’d wake impossibly hungover and irritable, taking way too long in the showers, and was generally late to breakfast if he showed up at all.
Draco’s fists clenched. He felt like Harry on a bad day and needed to bring his nerves down. He knew that if he said yes, he would have a terrible reunion with his father and might blow up at him right before he has to face judgement. He also knew if he said no, despite all of the horrors he had to endure via his father and his decisions, that he would feel guilty about not allowing him to try to make amends. He really had no choice for peace of mind. “This isn’t fair,” he said.
He wiped at his face and when he pulled his hand back, he saw it was covered in blood. He stared at it in confusion—where did that come from? He was beginning to feel a more lightheaded at the sight of the blood and shook his head in an attempt to stay with it. He looked up to see himself surrounded by Healers, eyes wide and staring down at him. “Don’t worry, he’s fine,” he said, before promptly passing out.
"You're still a child," Remus chided and then softened. "But yes, you can very well die if it gets too severe. Genetic complications like this have been known to kill those afflicted after too many transformations. Lucky for you, however, we aren't living in the dark ages and we have the capacity to protect you. Wolfsbane will keep your wolf from killing you if you stay on it," Remus began to explain, causing Draco to stand up abruptly.
Harry hugged James suddenly, overwhelmed with the sadness of all the time they lost. “You’re around,” he said. “We’re moving here and I’ll be able to see you every single day.”
Blaise looked small in the sterile hospital bed, surrounding by so much white it was blinding. His dark hair was pushed away from his face, arms at his sides with one hand hooked up to wires and tubes. Muggle tech, just like Draco had when his core tore in two.
“We’re having an Order meeting, would you like to join?” Sirius poked his head through the door of Harry’s room, startling him from his book. Sirius glanced at the cover. “The Odyssey again? You know there’s an entire library with other literature, right?”
He thought for a moment. He didn’t want to speak to Sirius—he felt that to be a sort of invasion. He’d settle for his brother though. He cleared his throat once more as he called “Regulus? Regulus Arcturus Black?” Nothing.
It hit Harry suddenly that the loss of Lily was fresh to James, as he had spent years with her before crossing back over. James was always so upbeat it was difficult to picture him mourning at all. He must have been, though, from the way he held the redhead in his arms. “I’ll let you two catch up,” Harry said, leaving them to their reunion.
Sirius was looking over at Harry in concern, noting the piece of toast being nursed in his grasp. Harry nodded. “I’m fine. Had a rough night but nothing that an afternoon nap can’t fix.”
“Could be the vampire genetics kicking in, too,” Remus mused, “seeing as Draco donated some of his core you’re probably with more of it than you used to.”
Sirius nodded, happy to finally check on Harry. “Great—thanks so much, Eric. I’m so glad Haz trusts you and is willing to work.”
Harry and Ginny looked at each other knowingly but didn’t say anything. “I’m going up to bed,” Ginny said instead. “Night, you two.” She disappeared up the steps, leaving Draco and Harry alone.
Sirius sat with his head in his hands waiting for not only Harry to be released into the long stay wing, but also for James to be checked out by the St. Mungo’s Anomalies staff. It was a good sign that the previously dead man was able to utilize the Floo with no problem, and he didn’t suddenly dematerialize once they left the manor boundary, but Sirius still could not shake the anxiety surrounding the idea that James might just disappear at any moment. He also just knew that the
When they did arrive, they broke away quickly, most likely to save Draco enough face as he could. He couldn’t help feeling naked without the Gryffindors: danger seemed to be everywhere. He mentally shook himself. This was Hogwarts. It was supposed to be the safest place in Britain. He needed to get a grip.
“What school is that, then?” How was he being so smooth and simultaneously so drunk, Draco wondered. If he had as much to drink as Harry, he would have given up the ghost pretty quickly.
“I thought we agreed we wouldn’t have conversations directly concerning my life without me, Professor,” Draco interrupted, alerting the three of his and Harry’s presence. Ron, Hermione, and Remus jumped in response.
Draco slid into bed next to him, placing a kiss to the side of his head. “Night, Haz. Sweet dreamless sleep.”
Draco sighed. Did he really have to think through everything for the Boy Who Lived? “I’m sure there are some left over clothes from yester-year of his you can rummage through. Did you try the wardrobe?” he suggested.
“Fenrir,” Draco finally said, finding his voice and some Gryffindor courage, “I have to get to Blaise—he’s really hurt.” As he tried to push past him, he felt Greyback’s grip on him and he was suddenly transported back to that fateful moment over a year ago in his family dungeons. Overwhelmed with the terror of his turning, he halted his struggle against his sire, frozen in abject horror.
“The room looks exactly the same, Weasley. Just like you left it,” he said, opting to sit on the floor cross-legged, resting his back against Harry’s legs.
Draco let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding, but there was still tension of the unknowns. “Blaise?” he chanced.
“It’s not, though. I’m just waiting for my friends to join me, you know?” He leaned back into the bench, eyes closing in contemplation. “When I no longer have skin in the game, I’ll feel at ease. It’s hard not to feel nostalgic for life when your nephew is sitting next to you and you’re the same age as him
Harry frowned. “I don’t mind—don’t be so jealous, Zabini,” he tried to joke, but Blaise would not be so easily fooled.
Draco knew Remus was giving him a wry smile but couldn’t bring himself to look up to him. “I wish mum was here,” he sighed.
“Just come off it, okay Blaise?” Draco said, not really wanting to interact at all, still stinging from their last conversation.
It has been...awhile. The beginning of the school year always takes some adjusting time and I thank you for your patience! Thanks for continuing to read!
Harry’s cheeks flushed at the title. “Why did they call you, though? Wouldn’t they have called the school?”
Draco, Hermione, Ron, and Harry all congregated in the same compartment once they boarded the train. The Auror guard hadn’t quite left the unlikely quad, disguised as students strolling the compartments. Draco couldn’t decide whether he should remain with the Golden Trio—he might attract a myriad of suspicion from his fellow Slytherins if they saw him with them. Hermione, perhaps intuitively understanding his concerns (or perhaps realizing Harry wouldn’t want people looking at
His parents hadn’t been able to visit since Voldemort had returned. He wondered if his father knew about the horcruxes and how many there were. He doubted he could weasel the information out of him.
When Remus returned Draco had already fallen back asleep. "No you don't," laughed Remus as he gently shook the former Heir.
Blaise frowned at that. “He’s more sensitive than he lets on. I didn’t think my rationale would hurt him like that.”
Harry’s eyes darkened at the thought of it, rather liking that idea. Suddenly his worries were forgotten as the two tangled up in each other for the rest of the night, Dark Lords be damned.
Sirius’s eyes narrowed in suspicion but he didn’t press any further. “I don’t think the Garden knew when to stop. I got thrown into Azkaban at 22. I think it reverse-aged me a bit.”
Harry brushed off his father’s hands at that. “It wasn’t just me. There were a ton of others, yourself included.”
Draco looked up in confusion. “Are we reciting classes, now? Do I have a memory issue nobody’s told me about?”
“It was only meant to be temporary. James was really upset. He didn’t want to do it: he didn’t want to relegate me to less than a parent. I was willing to do anything to protect them and coaxed him into agreeing. I think we had about two days as parents together before we were Confunded. It was really hard.”
Draco nodded, becoming suddenly sullen at the thought. “That’s what I actually came here to speak to you about.”
“Well that’s very nice. I wish the same to you,” Draco replied dreamily, only to begin screaming horribly as the now wolf clamped down on him. He blacked out, feeling no more.
Harry gave a lopsided grin in response, leaning against the doorframe. “Please, only your extra-sensitive hearing could’ve heard that.”
Draco felt warm at that. Never would he imagine that coming out of Harry Potter’s mouth. “I’m your Ithaca?” he repeated lamely.
“I visited Blaise and decided to help his healing along. Your vision was right, I suppose—I took it too far.”
Harry couldn’t help but feel guilty thinking about Regulus lying in wait for the rest of his family to join him. He’ll be waiting for centuries at this rate. “I think I’m in shock—I feel numb.”
When the night finally came, it was worse than Draco could imagine. A fever had broken out early in the morning, leaving him shaking and vomiting. “I need to put you in stasis,” Fenrir had told him about midday when his fever refused to break. “If you don’t rest beforehand, you can be destroyed.” Too ill to respond, Draco passively allowed Fenrir to force sleep upon him. As he woke mid-transformation, the pain was worse than he could have imagined. He didn’t know if the people around him were experiencing the same turmoil, his screams overshadowed everything else.
“Hopefully in the next few days. I’m itching to get out of here—I can’t imagine how you’re feeling.”
Jack nodded in realization. “You’ll look a bit healthier if you take care of yourself. Our prey is unfortunately people, so we look a little more attractive than the average wizard.
In the months between 4th and 5th Year, Malfoy Manor had been occupied by a very unexpected visitor. Although he didn’t see him very much, Draco felt instantaneously unwelcome and uncomfortable in his home while the Dark Lord occupied it, and there seemed to be no end in sight. His father, whom Draco thought would be gleeful about Voldemort’s return, seemed as though the wind were knocked out of his sails – in fact, Draco found his father to be more frightened and skittish than anything, continually sneaking glances at him in concern whenever he got the chance. His mother, too, seemed worried. All of the glorious stories told to him as a child about the time before Harry Potter defeated Voldemort seemed to have lost their luster as his return became a reality creaking up and down the stairs at night. Draco wanted no part of it.
Draco tried to catch his attention on the way out. Just because he screwed up doesn’t mean Harry deserved the cold shoulder. “You okay?” he asked as they headed towards Transfiguration.
It was all Harry could do not to crumble right then and there. “I’m not used to this—having a Dad—a family.” He looked around at everyone in the room. Of course, he always had Ron and Hermione, but he always felt like an intruder in their relationship. This was something special.
“I’m not going to make a scene about your identity, you know. My excitement had more to do with solving the puzzle of the summer rather than drawing attention to you.”
Sirius nodded. “I’ll be fine—it’s just going to be a long night.” They rounded the corner to meet the rest of the group. Ron was leaning against the wall, looking quite grey.
Sirius opened the door when he knocked. “You’re early, Haz. Everything alright?” His eyes crinkled in concern looking over his son’s small frame after pulling him into a tight hug.
“You created a barrier between yourself, Mr. Zabini, and everyone else. Nobody could intervene if we tried. Under control is not how I would describe the situation.”
Sirius frowned, looking ahead towards the door rather than at his son. “I was betrothed to Draco’s dad when I was younger. He hated everything that made me me and was content with trying to beat it out of me. He hit me a lot.”
He was moving around again and gaining strength back when Harry left a few days later. He felt deeply saddened by his departure. On the one hand, Draco was glad that they cleared him to leave on the condition of weekly Mind Healer sessions. On the other, Draco was fearful of what their relationship would become outside of the walls of St. Mungo’s. Would they have to hide away from the world? Would his parents be in danger? It made his head spin. Harry had just kissed him goodbye and told him not to worry about it: that it would be fine.
The blonde tried moving his arm, now wrapped in layers of gauze and resting in a sling, and winced. It was like being turned all over again. “How am I even here? How could I have possibly left the grounds?
.” He looked down, though, in apparent shame. “I did what I had to do,” he muttered, just above a whisper.
“Still, Harry,” Dumbledore replied, “you may be able to get into his good graces yet.” Dumbledore explained how Harry could get into Slughorn’s good graces again in order to get this very important memory. Harry found himself agreeing to help. It was odd, thought Harry, that he was so angry with the headmaster for so long but once given some semblance of a choice he was willing to help the man with this. He chalked it up to the fate of the world being on his shoulders than anything else. He would help him if just to get to the bottom of the horcrux mystery himself.
Draco handed him his glasses and some water. “I know what you mean. Do you want me to go into the city with you? Maybe we can grab lunch after your appointment.”
Remus bowed his head in thanks, eyes a little darker. “Yes he was. I wish I could’ve been home to mourn but there is little time for that these days.” He then turned to Draco. “I heard what happened to you. I’m so sorry about it. We’re going to get it sorted out, I promise,” he smiled reassuringly at Draco.
Harry nodded. “I’ve never had to fake it with you. You’ve never asked me to hide the darker parts of myself. You’re home; you’re Ithaca.”
Sirius told him to shower up and go right to bed until Healer Turner made it to the Manor, which Harry felt in no position to argue. He glanced out at the Garden but couldn’t bring himself to face his father after such a long fight. He just wanted to rest.
“I think they need to have more sessions with him to figure out the best course of treatment. Right now, we just need to help him.”
Harry took it, marveling at the tanned skin in a way that only an unbelievably drunk person could get away with. “Nice to meet you. I’m Antares Black,” he lied easily. Draco blinked at the name.
Draco found his excitement at the prospect of immortality to be very short lived after his first full moon.
“Writing Potter a letter to let him know how pissed off I am for him leaving me and how he should’ve thought twice about it,” Draco replied. Ginny let out a laugh at that.
He looked at the tray, which consisted of some lighter fare: toast, an apple, some orange juice, and his nutritional potion. They quickly learned that Harry really couldn’t keep much down lately.
She replaced a bag that Draco just noticed was attached to him. He looked at his free hand and saw a needle inserted. “What’s with the Muggle tech?”
“You know Odysseus returns home, right? He gets peace.” Sirius sat at the edge of Harry’s bed, taking the book out of his hands and flipping through.
“Hits him?” Sirius asked when Harry couldn’t go on. Harry just nodded tightly. “I don’t think so. I’m sure he’s moved on to more sophisticated means of torment.”
Draco snorted and crossed his arms. On the inside, he felt bad; he could smell the angst coming off of Harry and he knew that ever since the school found out his true identity he was having a rough go of it. However, he knew that the enabling cycle had to end and it had to end tonight. He wasn’t going to let Ron down on this one. Or Harry. Remus thought the antics would stave off at school: how wrong he was.
Harry laughed at the thought. “Being cordial with two Slytherins would have him committing me to St. Mungo’s.”
Draco shrugged the shoulder of his dressing gown to the side to show Harry his Fenrir bite around his bicep, still a light red shade that most likely would never whiten up. Harry had never seen it before, Draco wearing long sleeves throughout the summer, and was shocked by how large the bite actually was.
He didn’t have very much time to consider what was happening until he found himself in front of Lord Voldemort himself. It was all he could do not to pass out, trembling greatly after a whiplash of an afternoon. Where was Severus? Why wasn’t he faster? He couldn’t help but feel that all was lost. There were no other followers present but his father. A private punishment was rare- he wondered what Lucius had done do garner such an appointment.
Harry’s eyes widened as he reached for his glasses, almost side-swiping Draco in the process. “Sorry,” Harry grimaced, “I forget how long my arms are sometimes.” He put his glasses on and the world came into focus. “How are we getting away without a guard?”
“I gave him the password for the Prefects’ quarters in case he needs anything. I have a feeling he’d knock on your door before mine.”
He sat back on his heels, trying to process what just happened and hoping that Sirius got there in time.
“Didn’t I tell you to piss off?” Suddenly, Draco was back, Hermione in tow. It wasn’t the first time Harry found himself thankful for the blonde. It was unsettling.
Draco was fiddling with his blanket as he listened to the former professor. "I don't want to go through that pain again," he mumbled, feeling very small. "Maybe next time, I won't survive long enough to feel that pain." He hated being pitied and he could smell it rolling off of Remus. It was all too much. He felt the older wolf place his hand on Draco's shoulder comfortingly, reminding him of his mother again. He blinked back the tears threatening to fall – now was not the time.
Draco nodded. “I think that’s why Regulus told me to wait until the winter holiday to bring Harry: he must have known that Sirius was alive.”
James shrugged. “Is he alive?” He felt Sirius’s head nod in affirmation. “Thank Merlin.” James sagged in relief. All of the anxious energy suddenly left him, leaving him feeling exhausted for the first time in years. He rubbed his face tiredly with his hands and let them drop. Sirius took the hand closest to him and squeezed it. It felt warmer than it usually did for James, which concerned him. “You couldn’t hear me from the Garden—Harry was so far in there. I just hauled him up and ran.”
Draco turned away from the blood pops, a new favorite of Harry’s thanks to his enhanced vampire genetics, and faced the Black Heir. His eyes were dark with either passion or longing, Harry couldn’t tell which, but it went straight to his groin. “Is that something you desire?” he asked in a low voice, clearly egging Harry on now that he was sure they were alone.
Draco calmed at the mention of his vision but he still felt like everything was hanging by a thread. “I want to see you.”
Bill smiled softly, looking far away. “Despite always getting into trouble, Fred was a great man. I’m just glad we’re all together.”
“As if Snivellus is a trustworthy source,” James commented as he ran past them with Harry on his shoulders. Harry was squealing in absolute delight.
Potions was Draco’s favorite class, but he grew increasingly upset as Professor Snape kept making unkind jabs at Harry and his friends, taking points away from Gryffindor for no reason. He wondered if he could complain about Snape to his father, but knew Lucius couldn’t care any less.
“Fire Dwelling Salamanders have healing and rejuvenating properties, professor. By using its blood in a fire protection spell, any burns encountered will be healed instantly.”
Harry could barely sleep that night, he was too excited by the news of becoming seeker, and he knew by tomorrow morning, the whole school would know too.
“She isn’t.” His response would have been more believable if a note from Hermione, shaped like a bird, hadn’t floated up to him right at that moment.
“Hullo,” said the boy, having noticed Harry. “Hogwarts too?” He had a posh sort of accent, and Harry immediately knew he was rich, compared to the Surrey accents he was used to.
“Young master looks sad,” Dobby said once the dorm was empty and Draco was sliding into his school robes.
“I- what-“ Harry felt himself sputter out, his gaze moving from Ron to Hermione, to Neville, who all looked very worried.
“No,” said Ron, without hesitation. “Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the Wizarding world.” Draco nodded in agreement.
“No need for all that, Dobby. Fetch me some water, will you? And where is Lady Malfoy this er-“ he glanced at the clock, “evening?”
When she had first married Lucius and moved into his home, she had been terribly lonely in the giant mansion, especially with Lucius gone for extended periods of time doing the Dark Lord's bidding. The solarium in the eastern wing of the mansion, closest to her rooms, was one of the places she had spent the most time in, furthest away from where Lucius' death eater friends would gather, showing her the entire night sky without obstruction. She hadn't had much of an interest in Astronomy when she had been at Hogwarts, despite being named after a constellation herself, but after more than a few nights spent gazing at the night sky alone, her interests had been reawakened.
“Draco.” Narcissa had bent down to his level and was hugging him fiercely. He felt a few tears leak out. “Son, I’m sorry I forbade you from seeking out your soulmate. I realize it is an impossible feat.” They just hugged for a long period of time.
“How are you?” Draco asked, standing at the foot of Harry’s bed. Was this the same boy who had been his best friend for most of the year? Was this the same boy who had been so angry at him for no reason after that quidditch match.
“You’d have to have tons of money for that!” Harry interjected as Ron made another move that resulted in nothing happening to either of their pieces.
Narcissa Malfoy had an easy birth, surrounded by all the people she loved and several of the best healers Britain had to offer, should something have gone wrong. Her husband held her hand as a healer cut the umbilical cord of the squirming baby that came out of her and assessed the health of the baby. She smiled up at Lucius, his name on her wrist was blooming beautiful pink roses around it, the letters glowing emerald. The baby's eyes weren't open yet when the healer wrapped the baby up in a velvet deep green blanket and handed him over to Narcissa. He stopped crying almost immediately now that he was closer to his mother and made grabby hands at her chest.
“Unless you get out, right now,” Harry replied, finally having gotten over the shock of what Draco had said. Draco chuckled and pulled his two friends away.
“It was after a quidditch match. Harry basically said all Slytherins are bad.” Draco leaned against a desk inconspicuously. Hermione glanced at Harry, indicating that it was his turn to speak.
with him. It had pictures of men on brooms, whizzing by each other. “I thought we could read it, so you know more about quidditch before you play.” Harry felt his heart warm.
“Harry, whatever petrified Mrs. Norris is still loose in school!” Hermione whispered fearfully, looking from Harry to Draco to Ron. Ron was nodding in agreement almost immediately.
He got his reply during breakfast as he and Ron were discussing what the three-headed dog may have been guarding under the trap door. Neither Neville nor Hermione seemed to be interested, and Hermione was refusing to talk to them again.
“Why? What happened?” Draco didn’t respond. They were reaching the staircase that led up to the main floor.
I find it frustrating that there is a giant three-headed dog inside this castle. A school for children, a lot of them who wouldn’t know how to protect themselves if the dog had been set loose.
“Though if his grades don’t pick up,” said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, “that may indeed be all he is fit for —” Lucius continued on, and Harry felt that this observation was unfair. He was pretty sure the only person who had better grades than Draco was-
She was never the kind of woman to beat around the bush, and although he didn't rememebr his first conversation with her regarding his soulmark (probably because it was less of a conversation and more of her telling him never to utter those words a loud, ever), he knew it was a secret that he should guard, always. Draco's mother had told him everything about this Harry Potter, how and why he was famous, and why Draco couldn't be together ith him because of his father's alliances.
“I got lost on my way back.” Both boys knew it was a lie, but Ron didn’t say anything more. Harry was thankful the boy didn’t.
The fat lady bode him good morning as he strode down to the great hall, which only had a scattered few fifth years studying for their OWLs. They paid Harry no attention as he grabbed himself some toast and hightailed out of there, straight to the library.
For most of his life, Harry Potter had been alone, ignored by his aunt and uncle and bullied by his cousin and his schoolmates. When Harry came to Hogwarts, he had thought everything was too good to be true, two amazing best friends, a soulmate who, Harry realized, was perfect, people who were just like him, people who accepted him and
