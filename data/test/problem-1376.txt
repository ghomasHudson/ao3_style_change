, Potter ignores the plume of smoke that rises from the vial and throws the contents down his throat, shuddering slightly as he face crumples and he grabs the edge of the table, Draco looking on rather helplessly.
In the bedroom, Ginny was shovelling clothes into their trunks, the children’s trunks split into three compartments; Harry and Ginny would share one, they simply couldn’t lug around more than two trunks, shrunken or not.
“Answer me.”
“We’re adults now. Bloody parents.”
This was the worst possible idea. Oh god, why did I agree to this?

tight channel giving way, opening up, as his wildly twitching cock ploughs in. Harry doesn’t even have to pull out and start thrusting before he’s spilling into Malfoy, gasping out his climax into the neck he’d bruised a few minutes ago.
“Ugh.” Harry barely had a second to open his mouth before she was unceremoniously dumping the contents of the vial into it. Harry swallowed hurriedly, the potion burning its way down his oesophagus, and spluttered out a series of coughs as he half-sat up and leaned his weight on his left arm – it hurt a little to move his right – and accepted the proffered goblet.
Draco sucks idly around the sweet. “Did Potter tell you he bought Honeydukes?” Draco asks Granger who looks even more amused. “He bought me about twenty-five kilos of chocolate, Granger.”
Gently setting Lily back down, Harry cleaned his glasses; wiped his eyes.
!” Draco exclaims, whole face burning bright pink. “Will you stop it?!”
A gravelly chuckle: “You always have been witty, Malfoy; how ‘bout dinner, eh?”
“Probably not...?”
“Remus Lupin’s son,” Draco mutters awkwardly, handing the photo back. “Lupin’s wife was a Metamorphmagus, wasn’t she?”
him, Potter. Merlin.”
me,” Draco chokes out, “I’d have confirmed it.”
And then Malfoy is turning and drawing his wand in the same move, turning around while slashing it through viciously the air, sending Harry flying back and crashing against the wall behind, his head swimming from how hard it hits the wall, his glasses flung off from the force of his landing. He slumps down, eyes crossing momentarily, before he shakes the shock off vigorously, clutching the back of his head with one hand and desperately feeling around the floor for his specs. Kreacher turns up out of nowhere and hurriedly presses Harry’s glasses into his scrabbling hands.
“Are you going to pretend not having overheard what my sons and I spoke of last night?”

There is none. Malfoy is so quiet and for so long that Harry automatically starts rubbing his stomach in slow circles in what he hopes is an apologetic fashion.
“Is it Harry Potter, Father?”
Potter grins happily and it really shouldn’t have the effect it does on Draco. “Really?” Potter asks eagerly. “I dunno, it was just something Hermione suggested. And I,” he scratches his neck, “I thought you might like the dragon, I dunno.”
“What the hell did

“How d’you know I

Draco, standing on his front step, had stared at him expectantly, a drumroll of sorts playing in his head. “Would you

of it!
Hermione and Tristan laugh while Draco throws a handful of potato peels at Ron.
He wasn’t looking directly at Malfoy as he spoke – instead he stared at his navel that was visible where his shirt rode up, round and shallow, with a line of downy blond hair leading down from it – but from the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Malfoy smile swiftly.
After Potter leaves, Draco stands just stands there, his insides still surging with a rather hysterical swarm of butterflies, Potter’s expression of calm surety as he’d kissed his hand still bright in Draco’s mind.
Four hours later, I bang one fist into Draco’s front door in a relentless, aggravating beat until I hear an irascibly bellowed, “Who the

“Well?” Ron leans forward excitedly, chair creaking under him. “How’d it go?”
So why in the name of Merlin’s leathery left bollock does it bother me so much that Draco is sat pressed up against Tristan – pressed up against his
It’s another ten minutes before Draco’s able to coax him to undress and get in the shower, stripping and climbing into the tub after him so he can gently scrub the blood and grime off his skin.
“Er, no,” Zabini complies, grinning at me and ignoring Draco’s enraged expression. “You’re sozzled enough as is. And coming back - when do we get to meet the fellow?”
“Potter,” is Draco’s daft reply.
It’ll go away, he’d said to himself on loop, and he’d wanked.
“Oh, I am so
They collapse abruptly into a pile of wool and fervent kisses, Draco’s still gloved hands cradling Harry’s cheeks, Harry’s hands drawing tantalising patterns across the scars slashing across Draco’s heaving chest. Their mouths move together in a slick, easy dance of blissful familiarity, until Draco pulls away, gasping for breath through his mouth, his blocked nose emitting high, wheezing sounds as he pushes Harry’s face away.

“Yes.”
Another glance around the stone courtyard revealed that, other than on the Cloak, there was nowhere comfortable he could set her down. He looked at Malfoy who sat with his eyes closed.
(Harry had fucked him so hard that night, Draco was fairly certain he was still bruised from it). And so when Harry gnawed a proprietary line of mottled red marks starting below his ear all the way down to his shoulder, Draco pushed a hand into the raven hair and bit his lip over a weak moan, because fuck, but Harry’s unabashed displays of possessiveness drove him into a frenzy like nothing else did.
“Please!” Harry cries out at once. “Fuck—baby, just let me—
“Give him something for that, please,” Harry says gruffly, frowning at the floor as they both turn to regard him. “He’s literally growing another human, he needs to eat,” he says, stiffly.
“Thank you,” he said. He had mud on his glasses and tears in his eyes.
“Me too.”

“It’s hard not to watch your groupies make fools of themselves,” Draco says airily but his ears are still warm; the familiar humiliation at being bested is creeping in, and the need to vehemently reject Potter’s offer, purely out of spite, is on the very tip of his tongue.
, Potter!” Malfoy panted. “I was using a Sticking Charm to mount my phone onto the wall. Now give me a second while I put you on speaker and put up a Silencing Charm.”
“Even though you're not allowed to play Quidditch this year, you're still bloody fit. How do you do it?” Blaise murmured.
rivalry between all the Houses, but we will also be hosting more activities to promote unity. I will explain more in the days to come. But today is a time to celebrate another Sorting Ceremony and Opening Feast.”
When he turned to face Malfoy for the first time since the trial began, Malfoy was staring at him with such an uncharacteristically vulnerable look that Harry had to hold onto the table to steady himself. It had only lasted a moment before Malfoy’s face drew neutral once again, but Harry had been unable to stop thinking about it.
Draco let out a small laugh too, despite his brain short circling on him. "I should probably get home."
“Draco did a strip tease.”
“You’re looking right fit, Harry. You free tonight?” He asked with his classic grin.
Harry smiled back and made his way towards him. He jumped around with the three of them to the loud bass of the new track. Without really thinking, Harry snatched the golden crown off the top of Draco's head and placed it on his own with a laugh. Grinning, Draco reached for it a few times but eventually compiled as Harry evaded him.
Harry didn't know what was up with him, but it was like Sixth Year Harry had resurfaced. He couldn't keep his mind, or his eyes for that matter, off of Malfoy. He watched as Draco danced with Pansy and Padma just a few people away with a smile. He turned his head to his left and his smile grew even wider when he spotted Harry's eyes on him.
“I'll go get Luna.” Ginny said after they had settled in. “She's been owling me like crazy about the new issue of the Quibbler. Did you know a new species of Wrackspurt was just discovered?” Ginny raised her eyebrows and let out a small laugh before leaving.
Malfoy found his name, glanced at Harry, and sat down with a huff. Harry stared forward intensely. As long as he didn't look at Malfoy, it would be like he wasn't there. Right?
“Believe me, you would have.” Blaise said with a laugh. And just like that, the tension in the room was gone.
Harry matched his expression. “Ron and Hermione. You?”
“Nott’s actually not so bad. He doesn't say much, so me and Neville just went to bed early.” Ron mused and he wrapped an arm around Hermione’s waist. They both turned to Harry, waiting for his answer.
Blaise went to the bathroom next, and then Harry followed when he left. Obviously he could have gone in while Blaise was in there, but he figured everyone could use a little privacy on their first day back.
The overall strangeness of the situation hadn't disappeared but Draco was at least able to kiss back this time. He let himself respond to the shift of pressure on his lips and the movement of a hand on his back. He let his own hand stroke the side of Harry's jaw softly. He was suddenly extremely aware of the smell of Harry's hair, his clothes, his skin. Draco couldn't ignore the fact that he was
Of course, the first memory to come up was Ron abandoning him and Hermione in the forest.
The man thanked him, turning and giving Draco a small smile before leaving.
“Shall we head out, boys?” Pansy asked, innocent smile spread across her lips.
“What’d you need Harry?” Ron asked as he stirred his potion, the water having just boiled.
But that was inconsequential. Draco could say he was attractive the same way he could say Blaise was attractive.
“Thank you.” he whispered and Draco gave him a soft smile. He wanted to say more, wanted to let Malfoy know how much it truly meant to him to have someone there tonight, to have someone know he
Harry called out his own strained good night.
“Bloody hell Potter, you look like shit.” Blaise said once Harry stood up. Harry gave him a thumbs up and grabbed his toothbrush and a towel and walked over to the bathroom. When he opened the door, one of the showers was already running. Maybe if he took a long enough shower, he wouldn't see Malfoy when he got out.
Harry nodded and the four walked to the Great Hall together in a content silence. When they walked in, a few heads turned and watched as they made their way to the Eight Year table. Pansy and Millicent went to the left, to sit next to Malfoy and Blaise, while Harry and Ron went to the right to sit with Hermione and Neville.
Harry looked up to see half the group staring at him. He tried his best to keep his face neutral, not wanting to cause a problem the first night back.
Malfoy looked up sharply when Nott was called and looked as if he was going to say something but stopped himself.
Harry was already at his bed gathering his things. “Yeah, we’ve got that History of Magic test first thing too.” He dropped his toothbrush onto the ground and then his hairbrush fell out of his grasp.
Harry wanted to ask what his type was- to keep the conversation going- but the words would not come out. Instead he just nodded in response and took a big sip of his drink.
“Not tonight, I’m afraid.” Harry said with a smile. He looked at Draco and then added, “We wanted a more private dinner tonight.”
“I thought you believed that too,” Potter says snidely, before tweaking one of Draco’s nipples.
Draco eyes slammed shut as a little yip of pleasure sounded in his throat, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed hurriedly. Harry painted wide, wet strokes over his hole, pressing the flat of his tongue
It was Seamus’ birthday and Harry hadn’t been able to refuse, nor been able to wriggle out of there well before he’d gotten truly shitfaced, and so at eleven thirty PM he found himself hazily watching Seamus add a tiny golden pill of something to his enth drink. Seamus had grinned widely, handing him the glass with a loud, “
Malfoy is silent save for whimpered little mewls of overwhelmed pleasure, his nails tearing down Harry’s chest from time to time when Harry thrusts in and
“Did you even lose this?” Malfoy wonders out loud, shifting his leg in a slow rub against Harry’s cock. When Harry doesn’t answer, Malfoy smirks, rolling them over and slithering down to inspect it more closely.
“Big surprise,” Malfoy mutters darkly under his breath without looking away.
“Er.” Harry watched as Malfoy’s eyes came open, one eyebrow hooking up. “Sorry, but would you mind terribly if I handed Lily to you for a moment?”
Draco is immediately sitting up. “Oh, I’m definitely in. Honestly, I need to move my arse before I grow roots here and Mrs. W brings out more food.”
“Woah! You okay there?”
Potter carefully avoids Draco’s eye, biting his lip and scratching his neck. Draco wants very much to kiss him.
Stand aside, you silly boy.

Twisting his face into the best sneer he could muster, given the circumstances, Draco calmly flipped him off, making Potter burst out into a delighted chuckle, and then turned around and walked away determinedly, grinning foolishly to himself once he was a safe distance away.
When he finally did open his eyes, it was Draco Malfoy he saw.
Malfoy keens softly, grinding into Harry’s hand, gasping with each little mark he’s bitten, crying out sharply when Harry’s mouth closes eagerly around one, tightly peaked nipple. He’s wracked with shudders then, his body undulating under Harry’s relentless mouth, his hands pushing and pulling at Harry’s head all at once. When Harry lifts off the swollen bud, Malfoy sobs softly, only to cry out again when Harry simply moves over to nibble at the other one.
When I’d cautiously asked Draco if it had been him, he had lowered one corner of his newspaper to look at me impassively, calmly denied having had anything to do with it, and had gone right back to reading. And that was that.
Potter grins at him, eyes sparkling. “Yeah, I suppose it is, isn’t it?”
“He seems fine, doesn’t he? You can probably tell.”
Working his hips to thrust into the tight circle of Draco’s fist, Harry focused on nothing but kissing and nipping his way down Draco’s front, nibbling on his collar bones, pulling his nipples up into tight little buds and leaving deep indentations with his teeth along Draco’s sides. Draco was hard and dripping already and could barely contain the gasps that were teased out of him.
.” He shoves at me roughly. I wrap my fingers around one bony wrist.
.” Malfoy glared, his bound hands resting awkwardly in his lap as he mentally stabbed Harry in the neck. “What the fuck, Potter? Is this some new form of bullying?”
And then Harry was right behind him, his arms slipping around Draco’s waist, his cock pressing against Draco’s lower back, rubbing gently.
“Not nearly,” Draco says impatiently. “What do you
“Why not?”
“Are you saying I have a pointy arse, Potter?!” he chokes out, voice shrill.
Potter huffs a laugh but nods. “You won’t go hide in your room tonight, right?” he asks.
James’ breath fogged in front of his face. Harry stared at it for a second.
I snort. “Fancy.”
“What’re you
Instead, “I
“P--” Malfoy started to say (probably, his name), but Harry pressed back in, Malfoy growling in frustration as he was cut off. When they next broke for air, Malfoy didn’t gasp out his name but, “
“Are you joking? I
Potter looks up now and Draco’s belly plummets as their eyes meet. He smiles at Draco, soft and friendly, and gets to his feet, strolling up to him through the sludge.
“Took your time, didn’t you?” Harry says mildly. He doesn’t look angry or irritated that Draco had made him wait. In fact, his serene, calm smile siphons out some of Draco’s nervousness. “Come on, then,” he adds, patting his lap.
the Locking Charm and pushes the door open.
,” Malfoy says stiffly, glaring at the floor with his jaw tightly clenched.
“So, you haven’t eaten dinner yet?” Potter interrupts, a tiny flare of hope in his expression.
“I need to know what your problem is,” he says calmly. “I’m not going to ask again.”
the other father of your baby?” Harry retorts, nodding towards Draco’s midriff, hidden behind tightly crossed arms. “Isn’t that what you’re claiming, Malfoy?”
Ron shakes his head as he clutches at a barstool for support, still wheezing with laughter as he points at a surly-faced Draco.
“You’re running low on beer,” I inform him, taking a swig as I walk into his bedroom.
But James was wrenching his hand free and flinging the Cloak off himself.

“What’re you talking about, Malfoy?” Potter asks wearily. “Mungo’s provides government approved--”

“You’re not my lover,” Draco informs him at once, even as his heart leaps in his chest. He’s suddenly very aware of how
Harry looked at the little boy, his heart melting a bit more. “Scorpius. I assure you this: there is nobody – nobody in the world – who would

Malfoy’s got him by the hair, both hands fisted in Harry’s mane, and he’s kissing Harry with the same fervent desperation that Harry’s insides are bubbling with. He still has a leg around Harry’s waist, and he’s grinding their cocks together almost unconsciously as he shoves and slides his tongue against Harry’s, nipping and biting ruthlessly at Harry’s mouth.
I go,” Harry says immediately. “I haven’t decided yet.”
“Do you trust me, Potter?” Draco asks softly, stomach clenched in anticipation.
For one heart-stopping instant, Harry braces himself for Malfoy to simply blurt it out. They hadn’t spoken about this – about telling Malfoy’s parents about them, about the baby – what with the sudden turn of events since Ron’s Floo call and Malfoy’s complete refusal to talk afterwards. Harry has no idea suddenly of how Malfoy intends to do this, and while he has nothing to fear, not really, he finds himself holding his breath as he looks from Lucius’ hyper-suspicious glare to Narcissa’s keen, slightly confused expression.
“Mr. Potter!”
, Potter?!” He sounded petrified.
“Harry, I’m sorry for everything you’ve been through, I am, but none of that is even pertinent to you finding someone to fall in love with,” Hermione says flatly all in one breath. “I know this hex has left you in a mess, but you can’t just sit here feeling hopeless and sorry for yourself. Of course you’re not going to find someone perfectly suited for you just after...what, you’ve been on three dates so far? I’m sorry none of those men were it for you, but I’m also pretty sure you didn’t
“Don’t be a nosy parker,” Draco chides gently, elbowing my chest.
“D’you want to take a vial of Dreamless?” Draco murmurs against his scar. Harry shakes his head with a little sigh, wrapping burly arms around his waist and keeling over sideways so Draco thumps down into bed with him, their legs entangling as their mouths seek each other blindly.
“Do I make you happy?” enquires Harry.
I make a sharp sound of disbelief and disdain.

“We had a

,” the senior Healer had finally proclaimed after fifteen minutes of droning on and on about the hex Harry had been hit with, nodding solemnly as he stared morosely at Harry’s cock tenting the sheets that were drawn up to his waist. “Terribly unfortunate, Auror Potter. Our deepest sympathies.”
Hermione smiles, eyes twinkling. “That’s your baby,” she tells them, pointing once more.
They don’t pull away when they break apart, staying pressed close and breathing each other’s air as they pant, brows pressed together. Potter’s eyes are shut and Draco’s are slightly crossed as he peers at him, watching the way his lashes flutter. They’re both hard, Potter’s need an insistent press against Draco’s hip, Draco’s cock twitching a damp spot in his pyjamas.
He’d eventually tried to simply distract himself; he’d Floo’d over to Ron and Hermione’s, and assembled an infuriatingly complicated crib for Rosie; Ron had been grateful that
“Try not to instigate me on a full moon night, please?” Harry requests exasperatedly. Malfoy snorts and shifts against him, both of them hissing at the sharp tug between them.
“Potter, you don’t have to buy me things all the time.” Draco had tried to sound snappish but it came out sounding more consoling and rather wearily fond. “I’m not completely broke yet, you know?”
“You were watching?”
“There could be a wedding, sure,” he says with a shrug and when Malfoy snorts, he rolls his eyes. “I mean, I’m sure we’ll talk about it eventually, if we haven’t murdered each other by then. I’m afraid it might not be possible before this one is born, though,” he adds, grazing a knuckle gently over Malfoy’s stomach, his heart fluttering in time with the movements from within. “Maybe before the next one!” he says brightly, rearing back a bit at the sudden dangerous glower Malfoy instantly shoots him.
Draco cannot stop staring at him.
“I thought we’d agreed to try and be civil to one another,” he growls through grit teeth, glaring hotly at Malfoy.
Draco splutters loudly and squeezes his eyes shut. “For fuck’s
Malfoy blinks up at him a moment before getting up, rolling his eyes, and walking over to the armchair, sitting down and immediately drawing his legs up, curling up primly and holding his mug on his knees. Harry stands there a moment, staring down at him; the mildly sweet, but somehow shockingly exotic scent of Malfoy had assaulted his senses the second he’d walked into the ramshackle old building, but it’s not until just now, when Malfoy had brushed past him that Harry properly registers it again.
“Upset that you didn’t get to fuck him?” Draco bites out before he can think or come up with a less something not quite so transparently jealous, but the anger seeping through him now is blistering and
The moon is already high when Draco lets himself into Grimmauld Place. Pausing at the foot of the stairs, he calls quietly for Kreacher.

to him – but he’s still not prepared when he looks up from his champagne to see Harry standing there, expression a tad impassive, but his gaze soft and warm.
Something snaps inside my head. “Will you shut your face?” I bite out, not looking at him. “Seriously, just
“I don’t know,” Harry’s voice breaks against Draco’s temple, “I don’t
The old man shrinks back at Draco’s raised voice, blinking rapidly as a deep, blotchy blush rises on his wrinkled face. He stumbles back another step as Draco pointedly wipes his wrist on his robes. “Terribly sorry,” he mumbles. “Kindly forgive me--”
I’d known he was lying. He’d known I’d known.
, give me a second, you fucker,” Draco gasps.
And then Harry reached out and grabbed Draco’s bum, filling his hand with one round cheek and squeezing it. Yelping in startlement, Draco turned around and raised a hand to slap his arm but Harry had already slipped away, chortling through a mouthful of toothpaste, the lines of the tattoo across the muscles of his broad back glowing golden in the sunlight.
“I’m not a prude!” I flare up at once only for him to snort and throw me a look of incredulity.  “Full English,” I hurriedly place my order before the idiot can start again about his night.
“Sure,” Draco drawled. “May I go back now?” he asked sarcastically, half turning away.
Malfoy huffs and perches on the stool beside his. “You hate this place; you think it’s too posh. I knew you’d be in the last place I’d think to check.”
Startlingly enough, Malfoy snorts, lowering his wand and wiping his nose with the hand still holding it. “I’ll take a lot more than just your
wide, and Potter lunges between them, lifting Draco’s arse off the bed as he pounds him loose, his cock smacking into his belly between them, sending strings of precome flying about. Draco clenches around him, fierce and deliberate, and fuck, but he genuinely believes that he can feel every ridge and fold of Potter’s cock inside him, fucking through the tightness, carelessly burning its way past any resistance Draco might be stupid enough to put up.
Malfoy, for his part, never looks away, never protests – not when Harry strips him bare, not when Harry puts his mouth on him, not when Harry boldly nudges his legs open and not even when Harry presses into him on a long, slick slide.
“We could come up with a plan so you don’t have to be
doing this.
“I haven’t loved him in many, many months now, Potter.”
“But?!” Draco snarls when he doesn’t continue.
“Clearly.”
“Stories!” Scorpius screeches, sitting up and leaping to his feet.
“Having been inside it several times, I can safely say that I am well aware of that fact,” Harry consents, nodding sombrely. Then he’s suddenly shoved onto his back with an unceremonious hand to the chest.
Potter buries his face in Draco’s napkin with a small burp, shaking his head. “No, then I end up skipping breakfast altogether,” he croaks, eyes watering slightly. “And then
He tastes Malfoy’s cock, pulling the slender, rosy length into his mouth and sucking until it juts out stiff and wet, as hard and desperate as Harry’s own still rampant erection. He caresses Malfoy’s arsehole, gleaming wet and winking up at him as he conjures and carefully fingers lube into him.
“Are you
He looked around. James was stood just behind him and was staring at Malfoy with a mixture of suspicion and confusion.

“Please don’t,” he sighs. “The whole point of going to the party was to—”
Resisting the impulse, he drains his mug and dumps it in the sink, and returns Lyra to her chair before carefully edging the slabs of chocolate out of Scorpius’ reach. “What else are we serving?” he asks, pulling over the cookbook and skimming through the recipe.
Draco goes scarlet right to the roots of his hair and tips of his ears. The rigid line of his mouth quivers a bit and then he bites the corner of his lip.
Potter darts him a look and then just shrugs. “Had a few whiskeys at the Leaky, rode the tube for a couple of hours.” he smiles sheepishly. “It helps to just...stay on the move; keep doing something.”
“Wouldn’t know, we haven’t fucked yet.”
Harry pulls back just long enough to cup the back of Malfoy’s head and bring their mouths together.
“Oh, I can always come back later for the details,” Malfoy retorts airily. “Potter doesn’t seem to mind giving those out. Four hours straight, Potter?” And then with a snigger, “Are you on stamina potions of some sort?”
“Wait, what?” Potter asks incredulously. “
“...Yeah?” Harry prompts, confused.
Harry picked up Lily – her little body was quaking. Ginny took Albus’ hand, and James grabbed Ginny’s cloak.

“You going to come for me?” he breathes against Malfoy’s flushed, sweat streaked cheek.

Harry reaches down and twists his palm over the weeping slit and Malfoy

“Oh, very true.”
Harry drew the curtains and stepped back.
“Hello, Scorpius,” said Harry, smiling. “Did you sleep all right?” When Scorpius nodded, Harry added, “How do you like your porridge? My kids like treacle in it. Lily likes raisins mixed into hers.” As he talked he pulled out another bowl and a small packet of raisins.
“Keep your hands here, hm?” Draco cajoles, finally releasing his wrist, and Harry blinks, a tiny crease appearing between his bushy eyebrows, the slight haze of intoxication still evident in his eyes despite the shower, but keeps his hands, palms up, on either side of his head. Draco smiles softly, nuzzling his jaw before gnawing his way up, stubble scratching his lips and tongue, and running the tip of his nose around the curve of Harry’s ear. “Sometimes you’re not in control, Harry. And that’s okay.” He pulls back and notes the way Harry’s gaze has sharpened a bit, understanding slowly blotting through the stark emerald; Draco smiles wider, grey eyes warm and besotted. “I’d like you save you too, from time to time.”

They were both fighting for breath by the time they pulled apart with a wet smack of swollen lips, and Draco waded through the slight dizziness to whisper, “Risk this.” He rested their brows together and pressed his hand flat over Harry’s chest, right over his heart which he could feel thundering under his touch. “I don’t want to risk losing this.” His voice shook and for once, he didn’t give a fuck. “I

Malfoy came with a low, debauched cry, the material of his bandages rubbing into Harry’s shoulders as Malfoy held him tightly, wrenching away his mouth to press his face into the side of Harry’s neck, his body shaking violently in Harry’s grasp.

the island, clanging a steel whisk around an empty bowl as Lyra drools happily in her high chair. There are two bags of flour, one of sugar, a crate of eggs, three giant slabs of chocolate, a new box of cocoa powder and about eight different cake tins, all laid out haphazardly, and Harry’s hair is already sticking out like it does when he’s a bit harassed. As Draco watches, he scrapes a hand through it again, looking up with a sigh to gently pry the whisk out of their son’s hand.
in the crowd even if he tried to, but could probably take in the entirety of the pitch from that excellent vantage.
Harry doesn’t remember Summoning the lube but when the tube smacks into his face, knocking his glasses off, he straightens up at once, squeezing out an unholy amount straight onto his cock and lining it up against Malfoy’s glinting arsehole, watching it fall open easily as he presses the tip in. He can hear his own panting, torn and rumbling out of his chest, and the sight of Malfoy trembling in front of him, with his pale, round arse raised in wanton offering, soft, pink hole greedily sucking Harry in, sends his mind hurtling through a void where there’s no careful control, no self-restraint; just Malfoy and his perfect, stunning arse and Harry’s indomitable need to simply
“No, actually, I think I spotted him head into the gents’ with two half-dressed birds,” Ron informs us. “Bastard barely waved back,” he adds hotly.
When Harry looked across the street he saw the bloodless face of Mrs. Muller at her own kitchen window. Her gaze was on Harry, not the sky. When their eyes met, she mouthed the word ‘please’ at Harry, her hand pressed flat to the glass.
just such perfectly lovely company,” Malfoy says tightly, lip curling again.
Potter, the enormous prat, had choked back tears again and Draco had been quick to take the mickey simply because it helped staunch Draco’s own horrifying rush of some more of those
“Are you worried?” Draco asks and Potter snorts.

“Nooo,” Hermione draws out the word slightly. “He’s jealous of

you’ll say it was my fault--” Malfoy started.

Complain about it because – well, he’s
Draco sighs, rolling his eyes as he works his gloves on. “I'm
When he goes out into the bedroom, he finds Harry waiting for him, shirtless and sitting up against the headboard. There’s a bottle of wine and two glasses on his nightstand. The lights have been dimmed and the air smells pleasantly of sandalwood and roses, Draco’s favourite air-freshening charm.
“Malfoy!” he almost shouted, and when Draco winced he looked a bit flustered. “Er ...” His blue eyes flitted sideways in a vaguely nervous manner. “Harry!” he abruptly screamed and thumped Potter on the back hard enough to knock him forward. Potter, scarlet-faced and furiously gulping at his beer, choked and sprayed beer all over the gleaming bar before hacking violently, slapping himself on the chest repeatedly. Draco had the overwhelming urge to laugh until he pissed himself but he refrained, biting his lip and casually looking up at the ceiling. “Look! It’s Malfoy!” Weasley said loudly, ignoring the fact that Potter now had tears streaming down his face. Granger, lips pursed, handed Potter a napkin and Potter, mopping his face fervently, turned slightly to offer Draco a watery smile.
“You’re going to pay for that.”
His eyebrows slide up slowly as Harry starts to grind them together, barely doing more than rubbing their half-hard cocks together through their clothes. Still, he brings his arms up to rest on Harry’s shoulders and starts to move in time with the music again, their gazes saying firmly locked, their cocks going completely hard within seconds.
“Yes, Ron.”
“Still feel those drinks, Malfoy?” Harry asks after his cock has stopped throbbing, dragging in lungfuls of citrusy air with his face pressed into Malfoy’s hair.
Draco has to takes several steadying breaths and forcibly wrench his gaze off Potter’s tightly muscled, bare chest. “When you
Harry slowly pushed the elastic of his boxers down. “Yeah.” His voice was rather hoarse. “Yeah, I sort of do...”
want it to happen again?” Harry’s heart sunk a little.
Harry had barely set foot out the Floo when his landline began to ring like a loud, whinging
Ron’s mouth is a straight line as he meets Harry’s eyes. “Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy,” he says grimly. “They were holed up in an old, unregistered mansion in Valencia, shit loads of Pureblood warding around the place.”
“And this,” Granger gestures to the sparkly contents of the bowl, “You’ve mixed in powdered silver with chopped--”
“I don’t have long, baby,” he whispers, shutting his eyes and tossing his head back. “
“I get off in an hour, would you shut up until then?” Zabini replies exasperatedly, wiping up the mess he’d made. “And get one of the waitresses to take your orders until then, stop annoying me. It’s fucking mad in here tonight.” He slouches away muttering darkly under his breath about Friday nights and Muggles with drinking problems as I pick up my beer and follow Draco back to our table. I watch as Draco places one mug before Ron following it with a sharp slap to the back of his neck.
It would’ve been funny – the man is straight and has seven grandchildren – but Draco
Potter,” he adds in a sing-song, mock-grandiose tone, head tilting from side to side.
“He doesn’t like it, you know,” Malfoy says casually, as though continuing a conversation they’d just been having. “Theo. He hates smelling these on me.”
“Hey, you take care tonight,” Ginny says softly, reaching out and cupping his cheek before gently wiping off the streak of dirt she’d smeared. “Don’t land up drunk in a ditch somewhere, yeah?”
Draco reminds Potter not to turn him into a werewolf at least once a day. And it never fails to tickle Potter. Sure enough, Potter snorts against Draco’s neck, wheezing with silent laughter as he lifts his head and brings his mouth down to Draco’s again, kissing him slow and thorough until Draco is turning away simply to catch his breath.
“Yes.”
“There’s nothing wrong with appreciating the finer things.”
Hermionie laughed "awww Harry you had a crush"
Hermionie jumped up in surprised and joy and quickly grabbed her dressing gown. She was met outside with Draco wearing an oversized grey T-shirt and silk pyjama bottoms.
Draco came into view and stared at Harry before saying
Draco startled and pulled a face. Potter was staring at him from two tables across from him. The eye contact was held intensely for a few seconds before Draco forced a half smile unsure of what exactly to do or what the staring meant.
"Yeah...see you around Granger" Draco replied giving a smile.
Hermionie smiled "Well thank you...look it's late we should go get some rest."
Draco gave one last sour look before turning his full attention to the class. Hermionie sighed and chewed the inside of her lip; Malfoy was her last option thus far. Then a piece of ripped parchment got slid onto her page of notes as the class were dismissed. It read.  I'll think about it.
"What do you want"
Harry returned to his seat, looking down at his hand expecting to see the red blistering burn scowling there but it was perfectly healthy but shaking. He brought his shaking fingers into tight fists and feeling almost as if he wasn’t even there.
And yes. I absolutely was. I'm almost convinced that I've always been obsessed about Malfoy.
Hope I Portrayed this okay! I will update this when I get time. In the meantime tell me if you like this and what I could add!
Thinking to Potter, Draco couldn't help but think back to a time where rumour was that Potter always suffered from nightmares, and if so...couldn't that be Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Maybe there's more to Potter than he is letting on.
Harry sat and looked at his sheet of paper with the black outlines of a bodies. Now he thought about it he felt stressed an awful lot but it was a strange feeling in his chest like a tightness. So he coloured the chest area in and back. He thought about the tightness he got in his chest and frowned, it wasn't like it was occasional and most of the time he could feel his heart beat in his chest as well. It is just stress, everyone feels that way, grow up. His inner voice told him.
“Is it true you lived with muggles most of your life?”
Voldemort appeared and killed me. Then I woke up and Malfoy was there and he. I think I kissed him??? Malfoy said he. Then Ron came in on a giant rat who killed my parents.
"You're incredible" I whispered, turning my head to look at him. He was on his side looking quite spent but very very smug.
Harry thought about how Ron could probably taste everything he ate at lunch (which was a lot).
That's how he ended up long, lean body warm on mine, his legs sitting warm and strong either side of my hips.
"I had a really nice time" Draco mummered, looking directly into Harry's eyes before trailing down his face, resting on his lips for a second and then meeting Harry's eyes again. Harry smiled and sneaked a arm around Draco's waist pulling him even closer so now their faces were mere inches apart.
“You’re burning my eggs!! You’re useless!”
against it, his scratchy jaw instantly inflaming the sensitive skin along the insides of his arse cheeks. Draco could feel the way Harry’s whole torso moved with him, with the way he was throwing himself into eating Draco out, with every last iota of his nearly boundless energy. He didn’t bother easing his tongue in by fractions, instead simply forcing the wiggling muscle through the stubbornly tight ring of Draco’s arsehole until he’d breached him completely.
Ruthlessly resisting the temptation to find friction against his own erection, Harry lets Malfoy hold his head in place and fuck his face, keeping up steady suction throughout. He teases the sensitive crown each time he pulls off, sucking hard on the slit and running the tip of his tongue under the ridge of the rosy head. One hand he keeps curled around the base of his cock, ignoring the way Malfoy desperately claws at it from time to time. With his other hand, he strokes the incredible softness of Malfoy’s sac, thumbing the delicate, silken skin and rolling around his tightening balls with gentle little tugs.
, pray, are those two related?”
“I’d be perfectly alright, Potter, it’s not as if you’ll lose
“’bout half an hour ago,” Harry says distractedly, waiting until there’s a familiar jerk against his hand. He beams at Malfoy who simply shakes his head, rolling his eyes with a reluctant, beautiful little smile that makes Harry
Draco had needed a lot of beer and dizzyweed to calm down and enjoy himself that evening. But when he woke up the next morning, his dragonhide loafers had been full of dried ferret poop.
If sparks shot out his eyes I wouldn’t have been surprised. “
Harry gently presses a wide smile to Malfoy’s shoulder. “
What started off as miffed sniping between Ron and Malfoy as they left Honeydukes, had turned into a full blown shouting match by the time they reached The Three Broomsticks. Hermione nearly toppled over backwards as Ron stepped up and bellowed right into Malfoy’s face, while Malfoy stared back through half-lidded eyes, lip curled in derision, expression one of pained boredom.
“He was kinkier than even that Japanese-American bloke from last month, and that one was

“I didn’t like it,” Harry says shortly.
“He’s eating right now with the others.”
But Draco misses him. Even while they’re in the same room together, even as Harry brings him off, Draco

from the number of dry orgasms he’d thrashed through. His palm felt rough and calloused against the oversensitive shaft and he’d had to put on a wrist brace after a point for how painful and creaky the joint got. Cold showers did nothing but clog up his sinuses, and sleep mostly evaded him because the fucking tent-pole between his legs meant he could
He was strolling along behind that long, stiff-backed, pale form he’d become so accustomed to that he’d started to dream of Malfoy frequently – chasing after him, Malfoy floaty and oddly amorphous, always just out of reach, disappearing before Harry could get to him.
about him, so just
Harry barely heard the angry threat with which Hermione shut Ron up; he was already halfway across to Malfoy’s table.
Neither of them said a word as Harry lifted his hand and slid the ring onto his finger. The silence stretched on as they both simply continued to stare down at the ring, twinkling prettily.
“Potter, Muggles have the most atrocious sense of fashion,” he declares tightly, looking out into the street.
!” Potter holds him by the hair and bucks when Draco squeezes the glans with his throat; gagging softly, Draco lifts off an inch or two. “Sorry! I’m so sorry,” he gasps, loosening his fist a bit and patting Draco’s head clumsily before shuddering at the way Draco just takes him back down his throat. “Christ.”
Today was just what Harry needed. Time away from the- though well meaning -overbearing nature of Ron and Hermione. Ginny didn't keep giving him sympathetic looks or imply that he should talk about his feelings. She didn't tip toe around him even though the anniversary was just around the corner. He knew
Again, Harry didn’t give a real answer, just nodded his head. It was still odd for him, having a Slytherin talk to him like they were friends. Which, Harry assumed, is what he agreed to on the train so he shouldn’t be that put off. Instead of standing there any longer, Harry excused himself and went back to the dormitory.
Ron interrupted Harry again, “Malfoy’s afraid of changing in front of people? He probably has a small dick.”
"Alright?" Harry asked, looking at Draco and not paying any mind to the man in front of him. He placed Draco's wreath back on his head.
Draco nodded, “Kissing, hand holding, all that type of stuff. Since we are supposed to have been dating for the past six months, we have to seem comfortable with at least a basic level of intimacy. I’m not saying we need to snog in front of the entire wedding party, but perhaps holding hands wouldn’t be unheard of.”
“You know, she's taken to the whole friendship thing much better than you lot.” Millicent added.
seem convinced. Draco would even go as far as to say relieved, for what reason he wasn't sure.
He stared at them for a moment but didn't question it. He accepted the money and waved them further into the club.
They spent the next few hours coming up with a detailed background to their relationship, going as far as to come up with reasonable weekly date nights (Thursdays, when Draco and Harry were the last ones in their respective shops.)
“No curfew, no worries!” Millicent called out and another cheer went around the table.
-=-=-=-
“And make sure no one tries to buy it. I'll have Fenrir Greyback come by to ensure your cooperation.”
Draco didn’t even turn around, just flipped Blaise off and continued on his potion.
“Ok then, we agree too.”
"We're really here!" Pansy squealed. She waved her lightsaber and it glowed green in front of her.
"Just a reminder," the man who had been collecting the money earlier came up to the stage, "our annual costume contest will begin in an hour. If anyone still wants to sign up, last chance!"
But why was this on the forefront of Malfoy’s mind?
That in itself brought even more despair to Harry. He had no memories of his own of them. All he had at this point were these photos and stories from Sirius and the Order.
“You're kidding right?” Millicent said, rolling her eyes. “We know you know all these secret passages to get around the school. And we know you have the Cloak.”
It was wishful thinking. It actually hurt more than it healed and yet Harry couldn't help himself but to dream of it. If he only had one more chance to see them, to thank them, to tell them how much he missed them.
Harry grinned at the unexpected callback. “You wish.”
“Mr. Potter, do I have to change your seat already? Or will you let Mr. Malfoy learn in peace?”
That statement had left several shocked gasps in the room, and Harry felt like he was the one on trial.
Harry didn't answer and instead grabbed his toothbrush to go wash up. He stopped short, however, when Blaise called out, “So
“No. Sort of.” Harry answered. He still wasn't sure what just happened.
“I can’t tell if they like me or are just taking the piss.” Hermione started, looking around before continuing, “Last night, Pansy asked if she could braid my hair. I was half expecting her to cut it all off.”
Draco reached out instinctively, placing one hand on Harry's waist and the other on his shoulder.
“I thought you’d want to visit them today.” he said quietly.
Draco had been here before, only twice. Unlike Draco, whose house was secluded from any neighbors, Harry lived on a fairly busy street. He still had his own yard but his neighbors were only a stone's throw away.
"That was…" Harry started.
different. His school boy crush didn’t matter, he was over it and this whole thing was solely to help him not appear so embarrassingly single. It was fine.
Harry watched him for a moment, Malfoy letting his hand travel to just below his heart before he felt Harry’s eyes on him. When he did, he dropped his hand immediately and looked away.
He wrapped a hand around himself without thinking and pumped once, twice, three times, then stopped. What was he doing? Was he really about to jerk off to this?
“Very. Fishnets, short shorts, crop top, the works.” Justin explained. Wolf whistles left the crowd and Blaise basked in the attention.
At the end of class, Harry and Ron went to the library while Hermione made her way to Arithmancy.
Harry’s eyes widened and he said, “It's the first class of the year, we can't be late!”
“Smells delicious, thank you.” he said before digging in.
Pansy nodded in regret. Of course he had to go.
“I just wanted to see if you would follow me.” Malfoy laughed breathlessly.
-=-=-=-
Harry sighed. He wasn't the only one who noticed then.
Once Harry’s head stopped spinning, he took in where they were.
Malfoy's eyes narrowed and then he dropped the shirt he had still been holding onto the ground.
“Now sit down, it's my turn.” Malfoy said instead of letting Harry speak again.
An uncomfortable silence fell over the Hall. Harry watched as dozens of heads drifted to the Slytherin table, and he himself looked too. The whole table looked uneasy, as if they were being put in direct spotlight.
“The boys and I,” Justin motioned to Terry, Anthony, and Michael, “are already going as the Ghostbusters but everyone else can draw a name from the hat to get a costume!”
“Hi, Potter!” Pansy called, waving and blowing him kisses.
“Class, quiet down, we can have fun after the brewing is done!” Slughorn reminded but he still had that cheery smile on his face.
Having already agreed, and having another free period, the boys nodded and began their walk to Hogsmeade.
The way Ron’s eyes widened and his mouth flew open would have been almost comical, if Harry didn't have the same exact reaction.
“I’d love some, thanks.”
“They do?”
Harry was looking at him waiting for him to continue.
“That's why we're paired together, Potter.” Draco said with a quirk in his lip.
"Should we…"
Murmurs began to fill the Hall and students were all looking around at their friends in confusion.
Why was Draco able to talk about giving Theodore Nott a blowjob like it was no big deal but when talking about a boy he fancied back in Fourth Year he got so worked up?
Daphne and Theo came over to them then, pulling Draco and Harry back to the dance floor.
Speaking of Hermione, her costume was undoubtedly sexy. Her dress hugged every curve and the dark velvet material made the costume that much more attractive. Her thick curly hair cascaded around her shoulders, the ringlets falling beautifully down her back. Theo too looked incredibly suave in his Gomez costume. His usual wavy hair had been gelled back and he was sporting a fake mustache to complete the look.
Her face fell however, when Ron and Harry stared at her in confusion.
"What've you brought today?" Harry asked now facing Draco.
Draco felt his cheeks begin to color. He took a deep breath and said, “Yes well, this is different. That was a childhood crush. This is...just a convenience.”
“I wanted a sexy one." she pouted but then stopped. "I’ll make it work.”
Seamus and Hannah looked beyond adorable in their Peter Pan and Tinkerbell looks. Dean kept peppering Seamus' face with kisses as they got ready. Harry wasn't sure whether to be surprised or not at all surprised when Pansy managed to make her Luke Skywalker costume sexy.
"Remember when we used to hide behind those antique couches? Now
Harry just continued to laugh beside him as he scanned the club for a table. It was filling up with people now but luckily he spotted a large corner booth that was vacant. He signaled to his friends on line where they were going and then he and Malfoy made their way over.
“Sorry, Professor.” Harry mumbled.
is where you go to get the best tea. I’ve been saying it for years! Daph and I go every time, no place better.” Theo said excitedly, Daphne smiling softly and nodding in agreement. She reached over and raked her hands through the slight curls on the back of his head.
They were staring firmly at their plates. They were all tense, obviously unsure of what to do. The only one not staring at their plate was Draco.
“Alright, great work today everybody. The final team list will be up by Monday, thanks again for coming today.” Ginny said and everyone gave their own goodbyes and thank yous.
“Buzzing.” Harry answered. He couldn’t wait to get out there.
“Blaise went to second base with Daphne! In front of her
“So, shall we get started?” Harry asked as their other classmates began practicing the newly learned spells.
Harry felt Malfoy’s own stomach drop and he stilled before turning around and throwing a silent spell at Harry.
Harry shook his head with a grin, “I never would have guessed. And Daphne?”
Harry could see McGonagall’s disapproving look from where he flew.
“Over here!” Neville called as they got closer. They all sped up, excited to see their friend after so long.
“Yes, exactly. We don't need your answer right now but do think it over.”
Ginny pursed her lips as to not smile but said, “That’s who I was leaning towards too. She’s almost as good as you.”
Draco stared at him, watching as Harry grew increasingly more...
he still fancied him. But he didn’t! Of course, he wasn’t going to deny Potter was attractive, he was extremely attractive.
Raising her arms in defense, Pansy calmly stated, “Hey, I still think it is a great idea. You and Potter are going to make a great couple.”
"Oh! I uh, are you going to?" Harry asked nonchalantly.
As the class washed off their hands, Pansy and Millicent strode up to Ron and Harry.
To his credit, Malfoy just walked over to Harry and stood beside him. Harry stayed silent too.
Of course this would happen to him.
“Draco, I was just telling Potter about all the fun we used to have back in our dorm rooms.”
It was under control.
Although he would never say it outloud, Draco thought as he sipped his tea, he knew how Harry took his too.
Right when he opened it, he was met with Blaise Zabini down on one knee in front of the door.
“We should. I’ll write a list.” he answered. Harry laughed. Draco smiled.
McGonagall looked up and seemed just as shocked as they were to see them still standing.
Draco grinned, "That muggle bloke wanted to shag me."
“Probably weren’t a reliable source then.”
Other people chimed in, causing Ron to raise his hands in defense and bite a piece of toast to prove he wasn't talking.
The tension in the room was so thick Harry didn't know what to do except agree.
option."
Harry was right, of course. Everyone loved Hermione and Justin’s idea and wanted to choose their costumes immediately and learn who their partners were.
“Er...sorry? Just washing up.” Harry mumbled and he went to the sink to brush his teeth.
Just as people were finishing up in the Common Room the two boys downstairs strolled in. Blaise was first and when he came fully into view all the Eighth Years went wild. He had on the smallest pair of shorts known to man that just barely covered his ass. His shirt was cropped, revealing his stomach and the trace of his happy trail. The fishnets showed off his legs and the drawn on tattoos Draco had done.
Despite having been in bed for over an hour and feeling so tired, Harry was still awake. It happened nightly, but Harry had hoped it would stop once he was back in Hogwarts. Now he wasn’t sure if it was helping or hindering him.
Ron just nodded meekly and stuck his hands into his pockets.
Miraculously, Draco did not burst into flames.
Dean shrugged before seeing Harry and grinning.
“You three will be leading the brigade this year. Along with me o’course.” Hagrid laughed.
He heard Millie sigh from beside him, “That’s what I’m worried about Draco. You were kind of...obsessed with Potter for like three years.”
Malfoy must have thought they were both already asleep. He would never let someone see him this vulnerable, let alone
Harry walked over and sat quickly. Both of his morning classes he was stuck with Malfoy, he thought to himself. It was going to be a
Harry placed a hand on the small of Draco's back and pulled him in closer.
Harry let out a breath as the lesson was revealed. However, a new question came to Harry's mind.
The same reasons, that only months prior at Malfoy’s trial, Harry had said didn't define him. That Malfoy had only been doing what any person would do when the death of their loved ones loomed overhead. Actions that even he, Harry Potter, would have taken, if their roles had been reversed.
“Should we,” Harry said almost nervously, “practice? Or something.”
“Don’t worry, I know. I barely spend any time here. I basically just sleep here. I knew I had to move out of the Burrow once Ron did, and Grimlaud isn’t exactly a place I want to be.”
The best way to go about being around Potter would be going straight into detail mode. No reason to get caught up in small talk if they didn't have to.
, my god! Absolutely sinful Harry, just
His brain would not stop picturing Malfoy and Nott. Sitting in the Slytherin dorms. Snogging. Their bodies pressed together tightly, clothes beginning to peel away. Harry could feel his cock begin to swell.
happens again.” McGonagall paused to let her words sink in.
At least Millie seemed to be over the hilarity of the situation, “Are you sure he’s the best choice? You know, considering...everything.”
identify him. The disbelief he felt when Draco said he couldn't be sure if Ron and Hermione stood in front of him.
Malfoy gave him a curt nod as Harry sat down and before Harry could think of something to say, Dreada started talking.
The rest of the group caught up as the family walked away smiling.
It was then he realized Harry had never been to his home before.
When he could see the Ravenclaw captain begin his descent towards the Pitch he flew towards Ginny and let her know.
Harry only nodded in response. The two walked through the gate and into the cemetery.
“Excuse me, Potter. I’ve made the first move plenty of times. I’m the one who kissed Nolan on New Years, I asked him to be my boyfriend a few weeks later, I made the first move with Nott, technically I’m the reason Pansy and-”
"Yeah." Draco answered. He paused for only a moment before continuing, "Actually Nott and I used to...help each other out when we were younger. Before he was with Daphne obviously."
Harry tried to glare at him but was unable to keep a smile from forming.
As McGonagall went to retrieve something for the lesson, Harry leaned closer to Malfoy and whispered, “What class do you have next?”
(See the end of the chapter for
. Draco didn't add, but Harry was a smart man, he would understand.
Harry sped up and reached the table. He cut the daisy stem in half before dropping it in. He looked at Malfoy’s, whose potion was a creamy white color already.
“She has a point.” Hermione said as she spread jam onto her toast. She lowered her voice slightly so just her friends could hear, “I mean, already it seems the Slytherins are trying to show who they truly are.”
The song they listened to at Harry's was Songbird by Fleetwood Mac BUT I always listen to the Glee version for Santana and Brittany.
Draco stuck his tongue out at her retreating form and then walked over to his couch. He groaned silently to himself once again, knowing exactly what she meant. Pureblood weddings were a four day affair. The first night was a dinner party, celebrating the couple. The next day was an all day event where guests came together, usually in some extravagant and expensive place, to be waited upon and tended to by the staff. The third day was the rehearsal dinner and final guest arrivals. And finally the last day was the ceremony and following wedding party.
“Justin, we cannot win without you as Chaser.”
"Look at you two, an illegal portkey." Blaise teased. Hermione smirked but just shrugged in response. Harry locked eyes with Ron at that and grinned. So much had changed from the rule abiding First Year they had known.
“What,” Harry finally managed, “what are you doing here?”
Draco’s eyes narrowed slightly at that, “If there was someone else, I would have asked them. Believe me.”
“Ok, I like that. Now, who made the first move. What happened?” Draco said.
The more they talked the more both felt increasingly exposed. Draco was shocked at how much Harry knew about him just from observation alone. And he was surprised at how much he himself knew about the other man despite doing his best these past two years to distance them.
The rest of the week went by both fast and slow. The two teams had practices whenever they could fit it in-which was really only two times- with short drills in the Common Room every night. By Thursday night, they were teeming with anticipation.
Those who hadn't been paying much attention suddenly looked up in interest.
“No.” a full truth. Draco had no desire to be with Nolan, no desire to play the perfect Pureblood husband. And frankly, no desire to have Nolan in his life.
“Ownes and Blanche were good, but Miller is what you want. Give her some more practice and she’ll be winning your games for you.”
“Sorry I just, I'll see you around right?” Harry asked. He didn't know why he'd asked, and he didn't know why his heart was thumping so loud.
Malfoy scoffed and stood up, keeping a hand on the back of his chair to steady himself.
“I-I can assure you that won't be necessary.”
Another pang in his chest. Sirius. He Harry did remember and he too Harry missed dearly. Harry flipped back to the wedding photo. Lily, James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter laughed happily at the photographer. They were fresh faced, no idea of what their lives would become.
Despite Malfoy being excused by his trial and by Harry himself, Ron still held quite a bit of animosity towards him. Not that Harry blamed him, since Malfoy hadn't proved to be the most angelic over the years, but Harry was determined to give everyone a second chance.
“I don't know how I'll cope, I'll miss you too much.” Harry said, making a kissy face at Ron, who shoved him away with a laugh. He would talk to Hermione and Ron about their room assignments later, away from listening ears.
Blaise grinned and said, “Yes, well, I had a very
The two sat like that for a long time, snow settling around them, as Harry cried and Draco comforted him.
Harry had gone to Gringotts for them and exchanged some money for Muggle money. That way everyone would be able to buy drinks at the bar. This led to an impromptu lesson on Muggle money. One Galleon was about five pounds though this led to grumbling about how improbable paper money was.
“Uh, Professor?” Harry murmured.
Draco sighed to himself, packing a crate of
Harry grabbed his arm without thinking, and Malfoy stilled and turned slowly.
“Sectumsempra!” and a pain like Harry had never experienced flew into him.
. There was absolutely no lack of chemistry between the two of them in those moments. All of their frustrations with one another were let out in the most illicit ways.
As the Hall cleared of its occupants McGonagall walked over to the Eighth Years smiling.
“So basically all of our friends are going to know it’s not real.” Draco said.
“Potter,
“Trust us,” Justin said, “it is.”
Draco blinked rapidly for a moment, letting the feeling of apparating dissipate. His quaint bungalow was in front of him, the large garden and small pond just a few steps away.
“Attention friends! I am here to
Getting back to his normal nightly routine, Harry woke up in a cold sweat, his nightmare already fading from his mind. However, it wasn’t one of his nightly horrors, instead the Hogwarts bathroom floated through his mind, with a specific Slytherin boy bleeding out on the ground.
“I just want to grab this.” He said, not really sure why, and he grabbed the broom cleaner Malfoy had just been holding.
Hermione’s hand flew up, as did Padma’s, Terry’s, and Anthony’s.
"Well if we cock up one of you will help us, right?" Theo asked. Nods of affirmation left the group trying to teach them.
“Ah, my favorite students!” Slughorn exclaimed as the Eighth Years walked in.
Once they walked out of the restaurant he whispered through his teeth, “What was that about?”
This was not happening, it just wasn’t.
Daphne, Sue, and Susan were refusing to leave one another's sides as the Powerpuff Girl trio helped the others with finishing touches.
Ron snickered and began plucking the petals off his flower.
“Don’t mind her, she’s a cuddly drunk.” Theo said, surprising the Gryfindors by talking.
Harry leant down and grabbed his own pyjamas and stripped out of his clothes. Blaise let out a low whistle and Harry’s face burned with embarrassment.
“I see. Have a great night you two.” she said with a wink as she handed them their food.
It was true. He felt exhausted and wanted to just shower and sleep.
It was quick, just a brush of his lips against Draco's own. Over almost quicker than it had happened.
However when the three of them walked into class, Harry realised that wasn’t going to be the case. He had gone to sit next to Ron when Blaise swooped in beside him.
hell...” he said, rubbing his cheek gingerly.
Pansy made a face and grumbled, “But that's so
McGonagall continued addressing the Eighth Years.
Blaise looked at Malfoy and winked. Harry heard Malfoy inhale sharply.
“You’re wearing
Harry climbed into the other one and began washing his hair as he tried not to think about seeing Malfoy today. What was he supposed to do? He had spent the whole night listening to him cry, but he couldn’t act like he had. But everything in Harry was telling him to make sure Malfoy was alright, even if it was, well, Malfoy.
Once the chatter died down a little, Hermione drew last, getting Morticia and joining Theo.
“You can help us. Rumor has it you've got a certain
face.
was he really doing this?
Despite everything in Harry telling him to comfort Malfoy, he knew that would only lead to something terrible.
“The new Firebolt is amazing.” Ginny whispered in awe, her face pressed against the glass.
Blaise had this excited energy about him again, and he said, “You know, all our games of truth or dare,
Everyone nodded and so she dumped the names into the hat and Justin shook it up before holding it out for the first person to take.
"Piss off, Pans. My mother would never do something so tactless."
Draco quickly cleaned the mess and continued working, but now he had a scowl on his face and was turning red.
“Technically only ten days but yes.” Draco’s eyes went wide, “Wait, you’ll do it?”
“Now I didn't want to pair both of you together, so Mr. Nott and Ms. Pavarti Patil, here.” McGonagall said, talking to the Patils.
“We were just talking last night and I accidentally mentioned it.” Hermione said softly.
Harry shrugged but felt his face start to heat up. “I don't know, he looked right at you, I just assumed-”
is a quid, Potter?" Malfoy hissed as they stepped away from the table. Harry laughed.
Harry shrugged and glanced at Malfoy, who's face had a prominent pink tint to it.
Harry wasn't sure whether it was the fire whiskey or just him feeling bold, but he asked quietly, "Why did you do it?"
Throughout the Ceremony and Feast, Draco and Harry shared more secret glances. There was no hate behind them. There was
Thank you so so much to everyone who has commented and left kudos so far! It truly means so much to me to hear your guys' thoughts!
Upon hearing her voice, Malfoy froze. Something seemed to dawn on him and he scowled before placing the broom cleaner back on the shelf and turning around.
The others murmured agreements so McGonagall turned to lead them to their new dormitory.
Harry sighed to himself. He wouldn't be rooming with Ron his final year, but at least Ron had Neville. Harry started feeling a little worried as he got towards the end. There weren't many people left, and he had a sinking feeling he knew who his roommates were.
The trio walked over to the Gryffindor table but were stopped by Ginny.
he had missed this.
"Where do you usually put your hands?" Harry asked quietly.
Their first class of the day was History of Magic, and Harry silently thanked Professor Binns for never assigning seats. It’s not that he had a problem sitting next to Malfoy, he’d just rather give Malfoy some space before they inevitably wanted to tear each other’s throats out.
Malfoy was slipping on his shirt as Harry walked into the bathroom. For a split second, Harry caught a glimpse of Malfoy’s chest, and a ripple like white line just below his left shoulder.

“I think to keep this seeming as real as possible, we shouldn’t tell anyone about it being fake.” Harry said.
gossip column.” Harry said after a while.
The whole room exploded into cheers, Harry even saw Sue Li laughing along with everyone.
The reason they even stayed together for so long, Draco was sure, was that the sex was

Ron gave an understanding nod, “I’ll drink to that.” and a cheer went around the table as they each took a drink.
can assure you it is. And you are not to tell anyone else about this, not even my mother.”
He dragged a hand down his face and rolled over in bed.
"Blimey, Muggles really like it dark." Ron said, eyes darting around the club.
“All right then? Tomorrow we'll go to Weasley’s shop.” Millicent said once they made it back to the school.
late for Charms.” Malfoy said.
Harry turned around again once the kettle began to hiss. Before Draco had a chance to explain to Harry how he liked his tea, he watched as Harry put one scoop of sugar into one of the mugs and then squeezed a slice of lemon he had cut before dropping the entire slice into the mug. The other mug all he added was a splash of milk.
“It’s getting pretty late now. Do you want to come over to my place tomorrow, we can go over some more things. Like things we should know about each other after six months of dating.” Harry said as he stood up and stretched.
Harry went next, drawing “Greek god.” with a pleased smile.
Blaise grinned wider at that. “I am so glad you asked, Granger.
“‘Mione! Come
"Did you ever-"
Harry raised his eyebrows and answered, “Haven't you noticed we've been paired up again?”
Harry realized suddenly that people were beginning to leave the Great Hall. Had he been thinking of Malfoy the entire time? Before he could pay that thought any more mind, he registered what Hermione had asked.
“From Batman. Sick costume, it’s gonna look great mate.” Justin said excitedly.
“Oh wonderful savior, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, how may we simple Slytherins help you.”
“Alright, fine. But to everyone else, we’re incredibly attracted to each other and madly in love.” Draco added.
“Purebloods are very strict on tradition.” Draco started instead. He was deflecting, he knew of course, but still. How does someone even ask what he was about to do?
Everyone continued talking over one another, trying to one up the last story with their own. It was quite something listening to their stories as they each tried to embarrass each other.
Enjoy this chapter!
“Pansy already knows. So Millie almost definitely knows. And I’ll have to tell Blaise.”
-=-=-=-
at getting around the school quickly and silently.” Millicent said with a knowing look.
Harry had to tilt his head slightly now to meet Draco's eyes.
Draco and Harry both turned around, as did a few other students. Blaise held up his daisy and began plucking the petals off, one by one.
"It's just another name for the money." He answered through his laughter.
Once everyone was outside the castle they travelled down towards the Forbidden Forest. They reached the end of the grounds where Hermione and Justin had a portkey waiting for them.
Seamus walked up and over exaggeratedly rifled through the names before reading out, “Peter Pan!”
But still. That did not mean he was asking him to be his fake boyfriend. Especially not for four days straight.
Of course they knew the obvious things. Parents names, where they grew up, birthdays, previous relationships. Things got a little more specific, but still not terribly unusual to know: favorite class at Hogwarts, favorite type of music, preferred drink at a bar, how they take their tea. Then things got weird. Harry knew Draco always wore long sleeves when he was working the front of the shop so he could hide his dark mark, just as Draco knew Harry walked around Muggle London to feel normal. Draco knew Harry was having a bad day if he left the Kettle before closing, much like Harry knew Draco was upset if he kept quiet on their nights out. They both knew the other avoided large open flames, and they both knew why.
“I suppose you two are first picks on their teams?” Seamus said, pointing at Ron and Blaise then to Harry and Draco.
To their surprise, the person who opened their door was not a First or Second Year. It was Blaise Zabini.
"Good morning everyone, I hope this weekend was restful for us all and we're ready to get back to work. Now, I have the pleasure to announce our special Unity event this Friday."
Harry didn't answer, unsure of what to say.
“Did he say something?”
Harry picked up one of the samples, looking the vial over. He placed it to the side before taking out the rest of the ready to sell products. Draco stood there awkwardly watching him as he did so. The silence surrounding them now made Draco want to crawl out of his skin.
“Have you, have you done this before?”
Of course, there were things they did learn. Harry preferred to shower at night, Draco in the morning. Draco had once wished to be Potions Master at Hogwarts and Harry thought about becoming an Auror. Neither of them actually enjoyed Pansy’s “signature” drink (quite literally just vodka, lemonade, and practically an entire salt lick on the rim) yet neither refuse when she brings one to the table.
Neither of them were as affected this time, but Malfoy was staring at Harry with an unreadable expression. Harry looked down at his hands silently. After a moment Draco said, “Who's spying on who now?”
"We love your costumes!" Susan said warmly. The three little girls giggled and their parents looked on happily.
Harry stood at the appropriate distance, raised his wand and, after giving Malfoy a final look of confirmation, cast the spell and felt himself be sucked into Malfoy’s brain.
Ginny said her own goodbye and Draco waved. The day those two finally got together would be a blessing on everyone. But until then, lunch “not dates” would have to do.
“Why would I know, Potter?” Malfoy sneered.
Nobody answered as they gazed around the room. It seemed everyone was too scared to break whatever spell they were under. Harry too was in awe of the room. Large couches surrounded the fireplace, reminiscent of Gryffindor. There was a comfortable study nook in one of the high windows and a few high tables about for studying or hanging out. Plants of various nature hung about the space. Stools and pillows were scattered around the room and multiple rugs covered the stone floor.
“Tea?” Harry asked, not bothering to wait for a response and instead walking to the kitchen with Draco right behind him.
Changing the subject, Harry asked about their roommate situations as they headed for the Great Hall.
Neville walked over before they could continue their debating.
Harry heard Ginny’s scream of anguish for the second time, but he felt Malfoy’s despair for the first.
did he have so many?
His entire face was flush and his cheeks were ablaze. His lips were the same bright red and his hair was tousled. He held the edge of his sink and could feel the tangle of Harry's hair between his fingers.
This time, it was Blaise who’s eyes narrowed before a smirk enveloped his face. Harry realized Blaise was not going to back down, and he knew from experience Malfoy wouldn’t either.
“Good morning class. I'm sure you were all expecting Professor Niehaus, but I spoke to her privately and she has agreed to allow me to teach you.”
him. Or more accurately, his emotions. A stream of nervousness that was not Harry’s own ran through his body.
at Occlumency. I wonder why today he struggled with shutting you out?”
“No clue.” and Harry took a sip. It was a sweet fruity flavor that burned pleasantly going down.
They left the bathroom together, and Blaise wolf whistled when they came back into the room. Malfoy flipped him off, and Blaise blew him a kiss before going to the bathroom himself.
It's not even that he wanted to make him jealous. Far from it actually. The year he and Nolan were together was...intense.
Harry looked at him with confusion, “If you want people to think we’re dating, don’t you think we should make
“Alright then, don’t just stand there, pull up a seat.” Blaise said, already standing from the circular table and dragging a chair in between himself and Draco, gesturing for Harry to sit.
Once the air returned to normal they started discussing simple facts about themselves. It was odd though. They already knew a lot about each other, more than either one was expecting.
“No, you didn’t.” He said calmly. “I guess I could have timed that a bit better, but I honestly am knackered all of sudden.”
“Alright you two,” Madame Hooch began, “Let’s have a friendly, good match. Have fun out there.”
-=-=-=-
Even without his glasses, Harry could see Malfoy’s arm, right above his heart. It struck Harry as odd that Malfoy was always rubbing at that spot. Then realization hit.
I've ever seen. You've greatly improved since I've last taught you.” Slughorn exclaimed.
The man eyed their costumes and nodded to himself.
Remembering what Blaise had said to him earlier, Draco spoke again, “Actually there is one more thing we really need to talk about. How...intimate we want to get.”
"Oh look!" Daphne pointed excitedly. Just a few places ahead was a group of adults with three little children. The children were dressed the same as Daphne, Sue, and Susan.
It felt as if someone had stabbed Harry in the gut and then twisted it cruelly before ripping it back out. Before Harry could look for Malfoy again the ground beneath him gave way and he was sliding into another memory.
Harry shrugged, “Not if we were careful.”
Harry wasn't sure what to say either. He and Malfoy had never had an actual conversation. Or at least not one where they weren't ridiculing one another.
The room was pretty dark, save flashing multicolored lights. The bar opposite the dance floor had a bit more lighting but the overall atmosphere was rather hard to see in.
Harry looked over at the blurry figure across from him. Malfoy seemed to be sleeping fine tonight, aside from the occasional movement.
“You lot are sitting up there now.” she said and motioned to a new table placed in front of the Professors table. Sitting there already were the other Eighth Years, all chatting together happily.
More people drew names, Susan Bones got Bubbles and Sue Li got Buttercup, while Hannah Abbott joined Seamus by drawing Tinkerbell.
Harry recalled Dudley watching that once before Vernon quickly turned it off exclaiming “that's not for boys!”.
They continued talking until the bell rang out once again.
Hermione sat next to Blaise, and Ron next to Dean.
Their friend group had been going to Cara’s for months now, and damn if he wasn’t hungry. They walked the few blocks in a mostly casual silence. Draco hoped Harry couldn’t see the tension in his body, hoped he was presenting as somewhat normal. In reality, he was freaking the fuck out.
“I understand House loyalty is a big part of your Hogwarts experience. I am not telling you to not think of yourselves as Ravenclaws and Gryffindors, rather I'm asking you to remember our House Unity.”
“I’m not going easy on you.” Harry said with a smirk.
They were still pressed against each other from a moment ago. Draco shifted his hand from Harry's shoulder to his neck, letting his thumb curl up to cup his jaw.
He snuck a glance at Malfoy, who was staring straight ahead. Blaise leaned over the tables to whisper something in Malfoy’s ear, causing him to clench his jaw and his cheeks to redden. Blaise snickered and sat back into his chair.
“Shall we?” Draco said stiffly, motioning to the carriage door with a slight tilt of his head.
He raised his eyebrows and continued, “I only meant so we felt more comfortable than if we kissed for the first time in front of people.”
His friends were silent around him now. Even Blaise had stopped laughing.
“Those of you worried about the House Cup needn't fear. There will still be a
Of course, Draco was not going to say that out loud, “We need to make a proper plan before we start telling people all about it.”
“Of course Potter would get a god.” Blaise said from where he stood. Harry shrugged and smiled bigger as the group laughed.
Harry looked at who else had returned, seeing both the Patil twins and Sue Li, Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Michael Corner and his friends Terry Boot and Anthony Goldstein.
Then the man reached out and grabbed at the cape aspect of Draco's costume and held it out. Draco laughed again. Harry moved against his own accord and was next to Malfoy a moment later.
"Whenever you're ready to come back make sure you have a partner and just Apparate back." Hermione reminded them. Everyone nodded. The anticipation was making everyone giddy. People kept giggling and bouncing up and down. The Purebloods seemed most antsy, most never have been to Muggle London before.
McGonagall waited for the laughter to quiet down again before saying, “To our Eighth Years, it is our pleasure to have you back. You will all, I'm sure, be studying just as hard as you would have last year for your NEWTS.”
“What, you let her?” Ron asked, sounding almost taken aback.
Both girls smiled and said, “Mione told us.”
He was staring directly at Harry.
“Blaise not back yet?” she continued casually.
Harry relaxed slightly and said sheepishly, “I was kind of rubbish at it.”
Harry thought for a moment before saying, “Well I figure I would have made the first move. Unless…?”
“So, I was thinking what else we needed to go over. And I think we need to really think about this deeper than we realize. Like, which side of the bed do you sleep on? Whose house do we spend more time at?” Harry said as he moved around his kitchen.
Once they reached the table, Neville quickly moved over so they could sit.
Blaise looked at Draco for confirmation, who nodded in response. “I’m ready. Fucking starving. See you in an hour, mate.” Blaise called out.
The trio walked over, stopping at the bar to say hello to the bartender Dolan, and order their butterbeers. When they made it to the group of Slytherins’ Pansy wrapped Hermione into a hug, mumbling “it’s been so long” and “haven’t seen you all day”.
“Daffodils symbolize eternal life, Gladiolus’ symbolize remembrance, Lisianthus’ represent gratitude, and Carnations, love.” he explained in a small rush, gently handing Harry the bouquet.
“Wow Malfoy, this place is beautiful.”
Draco thought it over. May did make sense. It gave them half a year of dating, so they would have to know quite a bit of the more domestic side of one another, but this could actually work. It put more stake in it to say half a year rather than four months.
Draco bit back his automatic comment that of course they knew who he was.
“Alright, I’ve waited long enough.” Pansy said and ran up. She reached her hand in and frowned as she read her name. “Luke?”
Malfoy looked shocked for a split second before replacing it with a scowl. “Not everyone would want to follow you around and spy on you, Potter. And for you to think that I would ever waste my time-”
Malfoy was coming in from the other side, both almost equal distanced from the Snitch. A perfectly shot Bludger came zooming towards Malfoy, causing him to pull back to avoid it.
Hermionie looked at him and sighed.
Hermionie and Ron stepped outside and waited, still uneasy weather Draco would do something to him.
"That's great, it's really needed I mean look at these. PTSD, Anxiety, Depression, OCD. And some people don't get help for it"
"Oh honestly you two! I don't think this is any good" Hermionie frowned and then she noticed a small peice of parchment peeking out, curious she took and then started to read.
Although Harry had a bit of a problem breathing in for seven seconds, if felt like.his chest was tight and he could only breathe in so much. And now he was paying attention to everything he noticed his heart beating loudly in his chest. And the more he noticed this the faster his heart started to beat.
“Um yes Sir”
"Um...Draco would you...want to go to Hogsmede with me?" Harry asked quietly, his voice getting higher in pitch as he finished the question.
"You still here?" Draco heard a voice ask, he looked up to find Granger standing beside his table with a stack of books in her hands.
"You don't have to know Harry, you don't have to label yourself just follow your heart. It's nearly breakfast time are you going to come?"
But there was no sign of him that evening...or the next. Ron had done a great job of tracking where he went during class but after he left the classroom he seemed to turn to a mist and disappear. So, they tried to find him - Harry's trunk had been taken the pervious night so they couldn't get the Muarders map - and they really didn't want to wait any longer.
Harry took a deep breath in and tried to pick out any smells.
"Mmm this stuff is fascinating... terrifying but fascinating" Draco replied.
He then linked our hands together and shoved my hands to either side of my head and leaned forward more, effectively trapping my arms. He tilted his head and changed the angle and I felt my mind going all fuzzy.
Because of the importance of this talk a few rooms were made up especially for the talks, they was painted a light blue colour and had big fluffy cushions laid out on the floor. There were some cubicles in the rooms with curtains and a small sofa bed inside with more of the fluffy cushions on top. These were for alone time and being alone with their thoughts. There was a red button on the wall if the person using the cubicle needed assistance.
The second, was someone who smelt really good.
Draco starts to question his sexuality and Harry has a traumatic flashback in class.
"Are you okay with this?" He has asked, a dangerous glint in his eyes.
"It's Malfoy he said he would do it" he whispered.
What is Harry going to do when he finds out who he was kissed by?
He smiled at that and pulled me into another gentle kiss.
They both laughed and then turned the corner to go into the great hall for dinner. It was just after Quiddich practise and after showering and sharing tips they had walked happily to dinner excited for the feast. As soon as they entered the Hall Harry felt a strange sensation running down his spine, then he felt his eyelids shutting on their own accord.
Harry managed a "I'm fine" and then Malfoy left but not before winking at Harry.
"This next exercise we are going to do is an exercise where if you are having a panic or anxiety attack and you need something to ground you. The first thing you do is look and five things you can see around the room. Then after that four things you can feel. Then three things you can smell. Two things you can hear and one thing you can taste. This brings you into the present moment and helps you to come back to the moment. Okay let's give it a try."
"And whenever you're done, try to focus on two things you can hear"
"You know you should ask him out"
So it was time for the first session and the eighth years were standing outside the room in curious anticipation. Draco looked down the row of people and saw Potter leaning against the wall and fiddling with his fingers and looking at the floor with distracted interest. They were going to Mr Blamy first and speaking of Mr Blamy, he had now opened the door and beckoned the class in.
Harry peaked a look out from behind the cushion to see Draco standing there with his head tilted slightly and a grin on his face.
"I thought she might be with you lot. By the way Potter are you feeling any better? It looks like you might have a fever, your face is very red"
The third however was hard to find or focus on.
Harry reluctantly stood up and followed Hermionie into the great hall preparing for the stares. And there were stares, everyone seemed to turn into fish and hawks all at the same time and he felt extremely watched. He sat down and then the questions started. 'What was wrong?' 'Are you okay?' 'Were you cursed?' He awnsered them as best he could but felt stupidly confused. Malfoy? I mean he is cute...wait I did not just say that.... Oh bugger.
Two butterbeers later and Harry found himself positively elated, they had laughed, joked and had well the most successful date Harry had ever had. They were walking back now, their tummies warm and their faces smiling. It had been hours since their departure and the sun was peeking through the clouds. Draco took Harry's hand and then walked backwards leading Harry somewhere off the beaten track. Harry raised an eyebrow at him but let himself be pulled to what seemed like a tree?
Then he did just that without a second to spare. Draco kissed like he fought. It was oh so intense and fierce. I couldn't help but recouporate and a pit of arousal lit up inside me. My hands flew up to rest on his chest, the smoothness of it was refreshing in a way.
‘Why do you care so much?’ It said ‘You must like him to put this much effort in’
"I think I really like you Draco, and I'd like that"
"I have a plan"
"Cursed? Is the alright?" The hinting of worried in his tone surprised Hermionie but she continued.
Okay now hold it for five seconds. Then breathe out through your nose for eight seconds and hold it for five."
"Wow I could say the same about you"
Draco looked around, the first thing he saw was the white ceiling that had been bewitched with soft blue swirls. The second thing he saw was the carpet, which was soft and plump - like it was brand new. The third thing he saw was the wallpaper on the walls, it was a calming baby blue colour and had simple patterns that faded in and out of view. The fourth thing he noticed was Potter, he noticed how curly and insestintley messy it always was. And the last thing he noticed was Potter's hands which were nervously picking at a stray thread on his robes. Then Draco went to look up at Harry's hair again (for no particular reason - "I'm bored") and was met by none other than Potter's dazzling green eyes.
"I'm worried about Potter. You see he doesn't eat, he barley sleeps and he does that thing where he shakes. And I haven't seen him smile once since he's been back" It all came out quite quickly and Draco shouldn't be worried because why would a Malfoy but he had left that life behind...or was trying to.
Don't get me wrong I've done this before. A fair few times actually. But this was so different already, normally I was the one giving, but this felt so intimate.
"Me too, and I think that would be a great idea" Harry said, his breath goasting Draco's lips.
"That's a bit creepy..."
Then he broke it off and I heard myself whine slightly. My cheeks flushed. Why am I so turned off with just a kiss?
He gripped and turned the dial listening to it click and smelling the lost familiar smell of gas, then pressing the button the create the spark. The flame appeared fiery red and hot with a crackle. The pupils watching looked very interested and impressed with how he had managed to do this well…magic.
"I'm free on Wednesday. I might bring a little something just to see what you really like" He said, eyes looking dangerous and sharp.
Okay, is fresh air a smell? Yeah I'll go with that.
He reached for the egg carton box, flipping it open and taking one out. He cracked it onto the counter and cracked it open with ease, landing in the pan.
"I don't know...I think we should research it and maybe get someone to have a class on it"
"Yeah but no one's got a chance against Krum!"
"You know I don't bite" Draco reassured.
“uh, just wanted to see where you go every night?” Draco replied quietly.
We were just lying there, talking about nothing when he started asking questions about what sort of things I was into.
“Give me your hand boy”
"I...believe what Mr. Potter has gotten himself into is the...Sleeping Beauty curse"
"Harry...maybe the anger you have for each other sort of hid that you liked him" Hermionie tried.
So without any further thought he walked further into the damp forest but Potter had gone. After an hour of searching he gave up and returned to his dorm room. He fell asleep that night unsure of whether he would be able to become friends with the invisible and real Harry Potter.
"Hi Draco" Hermione said quietly while notes. She could see Draco stare at her in her peripheral vision but continued on like all was well.
At dinnertime Draco kept a very keen eye on the top of Harry's head, watching as he moved food around his plate and then standing up and walking out of the great hall.  Draco quickly stood up and followed, unaware of Hermione’s confused side look.
I didn't reply. Malfoy is sitting on me. Oh my. His soft hair was dangling as he bored his eyes into mine.
Draco flashed a brilliant smile before leaning in and kissing Harry on the cheek. "I'll see you on Saturday at 11am. Don't be late"
Ron raised his eyebrows "You want to kiss him again don't you?"
(See the end of the chapter for
I mean potter did have a rough life with his parents dying, him nearly dying countless times, his friends dying, well..now to think of it Potter had a life that a book character would have, tragic and upsetting. He is bound to have some kind of trauma after all that.
Harry froze and then groaned loudly into the cushion before curling up into a ball and wishing he could just disappear.
"Ugh Ron I don't think Malfoy's going to help us" Hermionie said miserably in the common room that night.
"Hey Draco do you actually care about him? It's a bit strange that you were worried about him all of a sudden"
"Yeah but some people might not want to tell anyone they have a problem...but I'm glad McGonagall is taking it seriously" Hermionie said giving a small smile.
The second thing he noticed was how tired Potter looked, he stayed up late and always seemed to be awake early in the morning.
It was simple... Well not really, just get Malfoy to kiss Harry. She should had seen this coming: The constant talk about him, the obsession in sixth year and the looks they gave each other.
I didn't have time to reply before he sucked a lobe into his warm mouth. I squirmed, shocks raked my body. Then he gently bit further up and I'm not sure what happened but I moaned. Quite loudly.
Hermionie gave Draco a thumbs up from across the table and he smiled before settling his attention back on Potter who was poking at his toast.
I'll keep an eye on him, Draco decided finally, and if needs be I might even help him. Who would have thought?
The first session is taking place, what will Harry discover about himself?
Hermionie kept an eye out for Draco the rest of the day, trying yo catch his eye but he did a very good job of pretending he didn't notice this.
"Welcome class, to the first session of mental health awareness day, my name is Mr. Blamy and before you ask I am Blamy!" There was a pause where the students laughed. "However some of you might not be. This is why we are having this day, many people don't even know it or know how to deal with it. Before we start we have some ground rules for this. Number 1. No judging. This topic may be very sensitive to some people so do not judge someone in this room or out of this room if something does come up for them. Number 2. Listen, listen listen. Don't talk over anybody and I'm sure by now you all know to raise your hand to answer any questions. But mostly listen to yourself. Listen to what you're feeling and thinking. Number 3. Get me out of here! If you can't manage then leave. If you just need the loo then give me a thumbs up and if something's come up then just leave and go the small room next door with the cubicles in them, I won't come find you unless you press the red button and need someone to talk to. Number 4. Confidential is important, don't go slabbering to someone that 'oh Jessica started crying today when Mr Barely or whatever started taking about anxiety'." He took a breath and looked at the students. "Last of all be truthful in what you say. This is an honest environment and there is no need to be ashamed or embarrassed. Now sit down, we have a lot to talk about!"
It was arithmetic and Hermionie purposely (and with reluctance) came in late so she could get the back seat beside Draco Malfoy. He visibly tensed but didn't say a word. He had changed in more ways than one: his hair now fell in soft locks around his face making him seem to soften up, he was quieter and he was taller. She could see why Harry would crush on him.
Draco aims to get Potter alone for a talk, it doesn't go well.
Harry scoffed "and say what? Thanks for the kiss it really was a wake up call. Mind if we try that again? He's been avoiding me anyways"
I could hear myself saying "How do you know this stuff"
"Are you flustered or is that a fever?" Ron teased.
"Hey. You look amazing" came a voice to Harry left which Harry suddenly turned his head towards and wow. Draco was the one that looked amazing. He had whitewashed jeans, a dark grey t-shirt and wait...yes that was definelty some eyeliner but damn did it look good.
For a moment Draco froze, and both of them stared for a good few seconds before Draco flushed and looked away. Harry's stare was intense and Draco almost felt as though he would burn up if Potter stared any longer. (But not because he was blushing, oh my Malfoys never blush)

Hermionie sighed and rested her head on Ron's shoulder, she looked around the nearly deserted common room and saw the red fire flicker, which gave the room a warm, cozy feel but she wished more than ever to be hearing the rubbish quiddich talk from Harry again and the laugh when Ron told one of his ridiculous jokes.
It wasn't too long before I was close. My pulse beating fast against my chest. He didn't even touch me. He groaned in time with me and gracefully collapsed beside me.
"Mm what would?" Draco asked with a smirk and light humour.
"Shh ... I'm going to keep doing this until you don't even know what to do with yourself"
Draco took a breath in, some part of his brain said to be stubborn. Take the no as a yes and not stop. The rest of the class had seemed to be preoccupied in their own mess and somehow Harry Potter, the boy who lived twice. Harry Potter who was probably the most famous 18-year-old had turned invisible to everyone around him.
This really was causing a scene and it was starting to worry Ron. Now, he knew that Harry had passed out once because of Dementors and You-Know-Who but this seemed completely different; first off he looked peaceful which wouldn't happen if You-Know-Who was in his head again. Second off there weren't any dementors around.
Draco scoffed "No. You know while you're at it why don't you get everyone in this school to go and kiss him"
The dark lord was dead. Everyone was celebrating despite all the loss that hung thickly in the air...well most everyone. It was the first day back at Hogwarts and people, who couldn't complete their education because of the war, had arrived back. Now, the tension still hung in the air especially when Draco Malfoy with silver blond hair hanging loose around his face, entered the great hall and sat down. Everyone looked shocked, well most everyone except Harry Potter who just looked disinterested. Now a week into the first term Draco Malfoy could tell something was up with Potter and he was concerned.
Harry buried his face again and then a second later found Draco not only sitting down on the couch he was on but sitting right beside him.
Draco flashed Harry a grin and then motioned to outside. "Shall we go?"
"So you're telling me that Malfoy is my true love? Hermionie that's ridiculous! We hate each other!" Harry exclaimed throwing his arms in the air.
Harry grabbed a pillow and buried his face into it.
Omg I love this so much, the next chapter is going to be the date and Harry you'd better kiss him.
Harry and Draco go on their first date. With it be a catastrophe or a success?
"Attention everyone!" McGonagall announced at breakfast the next day while Draco was nursing a cup of black coffee.
"Well yes and no. The thing is the curse makes the victim fall into an unbreakable sleep until kissed by true loves kiss" She held her breath and Draco processed this.
All of the year groups were split up to go see different professionals at different times and among those Professionals were: Mr. Blamy, Miss Blake, Mrs. Trixie and Mr. Smith.
“As you know this lesson is about muggle cooking, would you be able to give a demonstration showing how this fry pan works?”
"Ah weasly, do you know where Granger is? She checked out a book I need" Draco said, shifting his eyes to Harry for a second. Harry felt his face heat up and he stared hard at his abandoned chicken.
But focusing on one taste was hard, if anything his mouth just tasted like his mouth...somehow it just tasted like well there's no real way to explain it.
"For what?" She asked.
With bleary eyes and a yawn Harry sat up and sat at the window looking up to the stars. A fancy looking owl swooped down from the night sky and hovered outside the glass staring at Harry. Harry opened the window latch wincing as cold air rushed in. The white and brown spotted owl landed on Harry's knee and looked up at him with round brown eyes, with an indignant huff he stuck his leg out holding out a letter. Harry rolled his eyes and took it gently. He unrolled the parchment and read the following sentence three times and then once more just to be sure.
Miss Blake was a Professor in Obsessive Compulsive Disorders and Post Traumatic Stress Disorders. After her wife had arrived back from an Afghanistan war she saw her wife's constant nightmares. Miss Blake at the time didn't know the symptoms until she came home from work and found the note. It was then she had lost her wife and she went on courses to help people deal with it.
Friends? Maybe a friend wouldn’t be too bad. He’ll think about it. With that thought in his mind Harry returned to bed and fell asleep surprisingly well all things considered.
Harry barely paid attention to the introduction of the class until the class was quiet and the Professor was calling his name. Harry blinked, sat up straight and looked at the teacher.
Hermionie lead the way to the Hospital Wing and carefully creaked open the door to the room Harry was staying in. The moonlight hit his face and you could see his dark lashes and his curly hair. He looked utterly peaceful, breathing soft breaths.
"So your telling me Harry has to get a kiss from a true love or he'll never wake up? Bugger...but I've heard it can take years to find a true love!"
"Okay before we go into the different types of anxiety and symptoms of anxiety I have these pages. I want you, if you're comfortable, to colour in what part of your body you feel stress the most. I have some muggle colouring pencils that you can use"
The question threw me I'm not going to lie, I told him I liked making other people feel good. He rolled his eyes at that and held my eyes in a curious gaze.
Ron laughed "Sure..."
She shook her head sadly "He says he doesn't know what we're worried about and that he's fine."
ote there is implied self harm, if this is triggering avoid the last few chapters. DIssociation is also mentioned, I've tried to make it as accurate as I have awareness of. But yeah apologies for abandoning this work but I am back!
Okay, first smell was definetly sweaty feet, but Harry was used to that after living in those dorm rooms.
"If your mind is racing then think of something you love, or something calming. For example I would think of a precious moment i had with my partner, but it could be anything for you. We're going to keep breathing for a few more minutes"
"Okay so you need to breathe in though your mouth for seven seconds, breathe with me.....
"You know we should both go to my room" Harry suggested.
"I'm positive that Harry didn't dream about spoons fighting with a fork."
Her shoulders were being shaken, that was the first thing Hermionie woke up to. She opened to eyes to find Ron standing there in his cannons Pyjamas.
"Potter? Is this to do with the fainting? He really needs to stop doing that" Draco replied.
Harry would have glared but he was too busy trying to melt into the table.
Harry’s hand flinched and he dropped the pan handle making a metallic clang onto the stove below. He was in a classroom. Someone was talking to him. He blinked the world coming back into focus, he looked at the source of the voice to be met by the concerned kind eyes of his professor.
"Yeah well I'll go look in the library...Good job Granger by the way" Draco said as he moved to the door.
Hermionie smiled and shook her head in amusement.
"You know Potter, I have a feeling that you have a sensitive neck. Shame I'll have to experiment"
Okay, maybe he was too early but it did take 25 minutes to get to the front enterence...or sort of anyway.
"Oh you little" Harry started but stopped as he felt the light touch of Draco's lips upon his. Harry shut his eyes, cupping Draco's cheek and kissed back. They pulled apart for a second before Harry tugged Draco's mouth back to his. They kissed softly and slowling, Draco's hands now tangling up in Harry's locks. When they pulled apart (finally) Draco's cheeks were tinged pink and he was grinning like an idiot but that was fine because Harry was grinning like and idiot himself.
"There's a man in green suit and yellow tie, he'll be at the bar. There's a blonde woman in red dress, she'll be sitting with red martini on the couches, they are undercovers. Few policemen are at all the exits, and there's a hidden van of two men in the woods. Take care of them. I bet you've taken care of the police car already outside and the rest of the men." When Ron gave a sharp nod, Draco grimaced. "Then get out and take care of the rest of the stuff." Ron hurried out. Draco turned to Harry. "This is the last time." When Harry raised a brow, he repeated with detail. "This is the last time I'm helping you from the cops. And this is also the last time we're fucking. We can't do it again. I'm police, you're mafia. It's unethical. Do you understand? We can't fuck." Harry gave him a long look then gave a slow nod. "Now, since my ride is all gone, you're dropping me home."
"Nope, that was all her." Harry paid at the counter and nodded at Ron before apparating to a dark alleyway. He had to walk a bit before reaching Malfoy's shop. It was evening and the sun hit directly at the glass windows of the shops. He could make out a comfortable looking café and a few cakes presented at the sills, there were very few people and Harry had the sudden need to visit this place with Malfoy. He knew the other man would be a regular customer of their area, and he just wanted to see him in his comfort zone, so that Malfoy would loosen a bit
“Harry.” I groan out, sleepy again. He kisses my skin, his green eyes looking at me. “Who is Voldemort? And Lucius?” he always chuckles, never answers. Just sucks harder till I bruise.
"How are you here?"
"Father I know I did a wrong deed. But I was just angry at the time."
"Yet here you are. Having a gun in you like you deserve the fucking thing." Harry pulled the gun out before pushing it again in a slow motion. He continued prodding in and out until Draco's moans grew louder with heated gasps. He then halted his motion, but Draco pushed himself back and forth, faltering when he realised that the prodding had stopped. "if you stop fucking yourself on my gun, I swear I'll shoot it in you and I'll make sure the bullet comes out of your brain." Draco groaned before pushing himself at a faster rate than before. He knees were hurting and his thighs ached but he couldn't stop himself from moving from both fear and arousal. His hair was grabbed in a vice like grip and his face was tilted up to see his reflection on the floor length window. His mouth was open in a wet silent scream. "Look at yourself." His eyes grazed up  to meet tinted-through-window green eyes which looked at him darkly. "you look like a fucking alley slut! Just jumping and fucking on a gun." His movements faltered, slowing his speed, but then he yelped when he felt the sharp thrust of the end of the pistol in him. "Don't stop!" He sped up his hips, his arms giving under him and his arse the only thing in the air, he didn't stop moving though. He could only hear his heavy pants and a  deep chuckle behind him.
It was a Friday night and Mathew and Draco had planned to watch a horror movie. Draco was clearly disgusted by what was happening on the screen, like who opens up a person's intestines for fun. He slipped his feet under the woollen blanket which both of them shared. His fingers played with a loose end, fiddling it violently as he saw the man on the screen scream with utmost pain. He jumped in his seat when he heard the doorbell. That's one thing he didn't like about Mathew's house, the doorbell was too loud. He looked at Mathew who looked lazily at him. "Get it please, Dan." Draco pouted as he got up. "and could you grab that bottle of water?" Draco sighed as he grabbed hold of the glass bottle on the table as he passed by it to get to the door. He flinged it open and the bottle dropped from his hand into many pieces and a large puddle of water.
Harry didn't understand at first, but then she glanced at the weeping quim and her eyes widened. "Wait- what? You're telling me that- Fuck!" She pressed at the bridge of her nose. Draco tried to shut her legs, even though they were stretched open and the movement was impeded by Harry's whole self. Harry didn't let her to, she held her grip on the knees tight.  "I didn't mean that, Draco, not in a bad way. It just came as a shock. You're just so beautiful." As if to make a point she leaned down to kiss her leaking, wet lower lips making Draco fall back hard onto the pillow with a groan. "How could Astor just not? Let's forget him." She gave a strong swirl of tongue at the labia. "Not even your fingers." Draco shook her head side to side, her blonde hair entangling terribly. "Why not?"
"You imbecile! You told me to disrobe infront of everyone!" And Harry immediately regretted that decision, no one should see Prince Draco in such a way, except him. Harry almost choked on that thought.
We and a few trainee aurors got out of the shed. I tell them to caste a disillusionment charm through out the alleyway. "Even if he was Muggle, there should be a trace of him as he carried the potion."
"Please..." Harry melted. She placed her hands on thin shoulders and pressed herself to the other; this felt much more intimate than what they did not ten minutes ago. "Please don't say that, Harry." She winced when she felt hot tears on the skin of her shoulder where she had laid Draco's head with her hand on the mane of blonde hair.
When she calmed down and I had repaired the couch, a bit messy, to sit on for all of us, Louis gave us both a stern look. "I know this all can be repaired, but seriously it's illegal to break into someone's house. Especially a police officer's." Pansy and I rolled our eyes.
He lined his head on the opening and sliding in inch by inch. Draco moaned at the intrusion. His toes curled in and his fingers dug in the broad back which he was sure left deep crescents on the skin. He felt the whole of the thick length in him when his arse cheeks touch the heavy balls. He opened his eyes and saw Harry look at him intensely. A moment passed and then two, he didn't get a proper warning when Harry started moving in and out of him at a face pace. "oh fuck lord!" Draco moaned, his walls clenched and contracted at a non rhythmic tempo and he scratched at the back. He saw green eyes screw tight and that's when he spun them around.
"I love you desperately as well, Harry."
"You're lying!" She yelled in her screeching tone.
"Oh you do, don't you?" Draco whimpered on top of him, when he brushed against the prostate once and then going back to scissoring again.
Harry leaned down to kiss his neck wetly before leaving a long lick to his ear. "Then come, Draco." He whispered in his ear.
showed it to you?"
"Would you please find out how my mother is faring? Only owls can reach her, posts can't. I don't know how she is and it's been more than two years. Would you please? It would mean a lot to me. I know we weren't best of friends in school, not even friends. But if you feel even a bit of emotion for me, may you do this for me."
"You bastard!" Draco shouted. His words echoed in the hall.
"I heard the rumours. That you could do wandless magic."
"The attorney forms ready? Yes. The documents are good to go, they just need your seal." He held out the forms to him and Harry signed through without giving any second thought or look. "I have to ask something of you."
"Utter disgrace!" The man, Blaise, next to Draco exclaims. Pansy joins him too. "This is nonsense what you ask for. It's a shameful act!"
"Yeah." He smiled. "my friend is coming. He'll probably arrive any minute now." Harry smiled and let himself out. He stood by the entrance of the building for a hour and saw a tall brunette enter. He walked a few steps towards the nearby tree and saw the man enter Draco's flat. He whispered under his breath, wandless magic tingling through his fingers and his green eyes shone with 'imperius'.
"My Father- let him be." Draco gritted out. "Let go of my Uncle and Pansy as well." His silver eyes were set in a furious gaze.
Malfoy turned visibly red. "Of course not." Harry gave him a small smile as he watched the blond shuffle with the papers around. He came forward to his table and slipped him a letter. "This needs your signature in full name and your magical seal." Harry just read the title 'Werewolf and other canine companions' and signed it immediately. He couldn't help but wonder when he found Malfoy an year ago sitting in the waiting room, along with few other candidates for his secretary. It was Ron's idea to get one, he ranked just below him and the amount of paperwork and documents which went through him was just outrageous, along with the regular authorized representative he had be of a sites in the field. Balancing both was pretty hard, so he had let out a flyer in Quibbler's aspiring employee sections, credits to Luna.
"What's that supposed to-"
"But in the Gryffindor camp. It's a short distance from here." She felt a tumble of chills pass down her back, when Draco glared at her with utmost hatred.
you do. Admit it! Admit to it, right now itself that you have filthy thoughts about me. That you are a
"Is with Zabinis, isn't he?" When she got an affirmative Harry continued. "He'll be alright and safe. I'll make sure of it. Stay here for tonight though." Harry could see the flicker of grey eyes between her and the bed. "Just for Tonight."
But the Professor shouted then, pulling out his own long but thick, twisted wand and pointed it at the running man. "Voldemort! I curse you to Avada Kedavera!" Then there was an explosion, all black and green. The people surrounding him fell back. Harry supported Draco's fall with his arm. It was smoke and fogged all around them, heavy air going into their lungs and soon they were coughing. There was a pinning sound in the air. Draco had too see that the Professor was well, he was an old man per say, but to his surprise Professor was standing even in the smoke and noise his face stiff and stern.
I sighed before replying. "He's cheating." Her eyes widened. "It's been more than three months now."
Blank grey eyes looked at him impassively. They looked so much less silver and more of matte opaque. "I don't recall as to why you're creating such a fuss. I'm merely leaning into the comfort of my lover." Harry seethed.
The next few days went in a quick little blur for Draco. He had given potion to James and the old man was recovering at a fast rate. He was able to walk around the banks with Draco and the blond made sure to have a casual conversation with him, usually diverting from any talks about of the impeding war. He faced the morning sickness a too few many times which didn't last only in morning but at random times of day and night as well;  and Molly had a hard time getting to realise as to what would suit his pallette of taste. She had tried everything from apples to sheep meat, even going far as to get the rare fruits of Hufflepuff. Draco would just turn his head on all of them. He did pity her, Molly was quite onto a mission of her own. He managed to take the vitamin potions and supplements through, most of which were sent to him by his uncle from all the way to Slytherin. He would always write a very short to Draco saying to him to take care of his own health and how he was trying his very best to improve Lucius' condition. Draco had cried himself to sleep the previous night. He had taken to sleep in separate chambers than his husband. He couldn't handle looking at Harry. There was unusual ups and downs of emotions happening inside of him and he didn't want to face anything which spoilt his mood. He was sent a bouquet of cherries and honeyed toast every morning, which was the only thing he was able to take in and he had a huge doubt that this was Harry's doing, because along with it came a note of
My jaw clenched looking at his audacity. "what do you want to explain. That 'Draco, I slipped and fell into a cunt with my dick first. And now I do it every day' ?"
"Husband..."
He flashed me a careful smile. "A dragon tamer."
, Draco did that. All the important things he needed to remember, he would recall them while we got kinky. He said it helped him remember them better and clearer.
Draco slapped his hand away. "Don't call me your Dove. You filthy, son of a bitch! You have no right to." The Dark Lord tutted at him.
"What?" Red eyes widened at such manner that they looked animated.
"Magic?" I asked. Pansy shook her head and picked up the golf stick mounted on the wall. She took another one out of the case and threw it to me.
"I do." He says sternly. "I want you to promise, that at least for five years from now, you'd stay loyal to me."
"Who's there!" He said sternly, only then to drop his gun down. "Pansy?"
"Pansy I don't think a wizard turned Muggle would have anything worth that much in his house."
made sense.
I give a quick glance at the wet bodies, laid all straight, All of their skin greying and scalding with large burns. Fucking Xellophilus and it's producer. "Where's Auror Weasley?"
"Don't lie, dear. You might have consequences to face. My magic tells me you went down to the dungeons."
Pansy spent the night with Louis and I spent the night at Pansy's. I missed the breakfast Harry made every morning but I ignored the feeling and made myself a strong coffee and head out to St Mungo's. There was a huge line of regular check ups for creature orphans and that had tired me by the end of the day. I took the leave at my normal time exactly, and I wanted to have a long bath in my bathroom. I didn't expect Harry to be there in the bedroom though, it wasn't even his normal time to be at home. "what happened?" I asked as I removed my clothes and wrapped a bathrobe around me.
Malfoy sighed. "It was as if he had a stick stuck up his arse. All he did was talk about politics and culture and traditions. I felt as if I were talking to one of my father’s mates. And he's such a coward!"
"He feeds on power."
"That's our Rose." I said warmly. "She'd be a great sister."
"I know Draco, but-"
Draco tasted oh-so-bittersweet, just like how Harry had always imagined and even better. She grabbed at the thighs in a bruising grip when fingers came to wind and tug at her own unruly, black hair. "Oh, Merlin, Potter!" Draco's legs flew upwards and Harry immediately caught the pink knees to place them on her shoulders. Harry blew into the core before flicking her tongue over the swollen clit, her fingers joined to massage the opening mounds. She loved the way Draco kept on crying her name out; she had longed this for ages, a decade almost, and now she was getting everything she ever wanted in a platter. She was on a right path now, she knew that, the blonde's thighs were shaking and she was quivering and moreover, a stream of slick kept on pouring out from her opening. Harry lapped it all up like a thirsty lioness in a cold desert.
"Who are you?" Draco asked sharply, his grey eyes narrowing.
"Yeah, it feels ... Good. What a layman way to present this situation, Potter." Harry shut her up with a deep kiss swallowing all the whimperings which she let out.
Alas, he didn't. Rowan just talked politics, just like his father did, talked about papers and old customs. He had to stop himself from rolling his eyes. It reminded him why he had even considered coming here in the first place. Pansy was to blame, with her sticky words and arse, telling him always 'Coco honey, you need to start dating', 'You're making yourself unavailable, guys wouldn't date you' and the last time when he snapped at her to shut up she had just said 'when was the last time you got laid?' That explained to why he was sitting information of the man opposite of him and deafly hearing his rants about cabinet ministers. When the time of desert arrived, Draco shushed the waiter away. That of course made Rowan raise his brows, it was important to have desert in  pureblooded dinner manners, but he relied when Draco said, "I'm tired. Why don't you walk me home?"
Victor let out his hand. "The reputed Potter! I've heard so much about you." Every living  wizard in England has heard about me. I managed not to roll my eyes and shook his hand in a too stiff and hard manner with a smile and said 'Me too'. His shake was hard too, it seemed he wasn't affected by it. He let it go to put the same hand around Draco's shoulders, though I could make out it was put lightly to not put any pressure on his bones. "Draco says you would be running for the Head Auror position soon."
Draco moved swiftly a step back. Even now he was regretting the hasty decision he had made. Harry had told him a quick 'no' when he had declared he would go to Ravenclaw. He was given a thousand reasons as to why he should stay in the Gryffindor; but recklessness ran in his blood. From his fast marriage and quick pregnancy, to the night before - when he had escaped from the rooms and ran to the stables to get his mare, while Harry had gone to the court with Hermione. He had ridden way too hurriedly with just a loaf of bread, he had snatched from the kitchens. His thighs were chaffed and his neck and cheeks still burnt with sweat. He hadn't even knocked on the doors of Ravenclaw: as if his exact time of arrival was known, the doors opened the moment his mare's hoofs were  a metre away from the gates. People looked at him with wide eyes, the soldiers with a glance and ministers with a blank look- Draco knew they were conquered over. Even now the courtiers sitting around him were dead by the brain, looking at him as if he were but a mere deer. Though there were a few who were grinning and smirking in a way too sinister manner than acceptable anywhere but upon the mouths of monsters in fairy tales.
"You've come to the right place then." She plucked out a cut bread from the basket and spread a huge amount of butter on it, and handed it to him. "it's all fresh." Draco took a small bite and his stomach thanked him. "Oh Harry ! Glad you're here." Draco looked back quickly to see the mentioned man on the doorway. He had a smile on his face.
"Excuse me?" Grey eyes fired up and her voice was snappy.
"Yes!"
White light blinded him as soon as he opened his eyes- and he shut them up immediately, red and yellow danced behind his lids. He moaned then- not because of the harsh rays of overhead source, but something prodded at his lower half. He didn’t know what was happening. He tried to move his arms and legs but they were too heavy for him to even curl a degree. He whimpered and then let out a low gasp. He couldn’t open his eyes. Something blew against his small opening and he felt his heartbeat quicken.
Draco couldn't see the eyes, as they were covered by some white screen, but he could feel a strong gaze on him. "Is that so?" He then looked back at the scruffy man and kicked him on his ribs, Draco heard a crunch. "Get out of here!" He then looked at the young boy. "You too. You don't want detention, for being so late. Mcgonall isn't that forgiving." The boy managed a low 'how did you?' before he ran away when the loud clock chimed to ten.  The man in the black cape held out his hand and a sleek black broom hit his palm. Draco had never seen such a model before, it looked quite advanced. It had more bristles and was longer- much longer than any had he ever seen. The man jumped on the broom and was about to leave when Draco called out.
I turned around to face him with a grin. "We are not.
, which of course meant ordered him, to come to the court. He had found some special guests from Gryffindor. Draco's heart pounded hard in his ribcage. He took deep breathes and reminded himself that he had a plan to follow through.
"Only for the best." Charmond grinned at me and my heart almost fluttered. I cleared my throat and stepped back.
"And?"
It was dawn when Rose came to him. She was quiet, way unlike her usual self, she would have chattered about what she had just learnt. Malfoy came to her as well. "Well Rose, would you like to tell me what have you learnt." She surprisingly shook her head, Harry was shocked. But then Malfoy just chuckled. "I know. I want you to think about it and next time when you come in I want you to tell me whatever you could make out from it. Is that alright?" She nodded her head in a daze. Malfoy smiled sheepishly when he looked back at Harry. "I would like to say- she would be in a haze for a couple of hours. Please let her be, she is just going through whatever she had taken in right now."
"Just put it in me!" He snapped at him. "Please!"
I turned around to face him. "Chapstick, Harry. My lips should look wet, like I just swallowed, won't that look nice?" His eyes twitched. He was controlling himself from narrowing his eyes. And he knew perfectly what I was implying.
"Why not?" Harry murmured against the round skin, making the pale prince turn red with both arouse and embarrassment.
"I can see that." I hold the tentacle in my hands, pulling at the tip slightly. I didn't have the time to react, when the thing wrapped around my waist and pulled me onto the lap of Mr Flemming, my arms falling on his shoulders.
“Oh but I already did, he loved it when I played with his cock. Didn’t you, my Darling?” George said with mirth. George.
Harry took some time to recover himself in the washrooms. He stared into the same mirror in which Malfoy would have been staring into and talking animatedly to himself. Now that he considered, last he saw Malfoy was during his trials. His parents were already given their sentences and Harry didn't even want to go to his hearing. Malfoy had sat on the hard, uncomfortable chair, all thin and narrow and dirty, not saying anything, not even looking up when it was decided that Malfoy Manor and all vaults would be ceased immediately for war repercussions. He looked dead, Harry thought he was, only an Auror came and pulled the boy up and Malfoy did stand on his two feet and didn't fall down in a heap, and proved him wrong as he walked out of the courtroom. Harry had felt like he should have spoken something to him at that time, but he didn't. He felt like being selfish and so he became one. And he felt at the time that whatever decision Wingzemot took was right and Malfoy should be thankful that he wasn't put in Azkaban instead of mere poverty.
Draco grabbed at his collars, and it was only then he took in the look properly. Potter looked fit like this, wearing an off-white crisp shirt and dark grey trousers. He smelled divine as well, something like a mixture mint and liquorice. "We both know you're Padfoot." He whisper-yelled and brought his face close to his.
"You know, Louis. Pansy won't be able to repair all this properly. There's a special shop which does the repairing work efficiently although a bit too pricey. I can make someone pay it for you."
It wasn't the fact that Harry took time coming back home, aurors have a hefty bit of work and that includes overtime. It also wasn't that Harry always slept right away after coming from home and dined quietly in the kitchen on his own. It also wasn't the fact that he smelt like roses when he should be smelling like sweat and apple spice parfum which was put on every morning and it would last longer than required on his clothes. And it was never the fact that we stopped having sex, I mean I don't expect everyday. But when we did it would be quick and fast.
He had to force himself to not gape at Malfoy. His hair looked golden in the bright yellow lighting and his silver grey eyes seemed to glow like amber. Even though he didn't gape, it seemed Malfoy couldn't stop himself from doing that, but he quickly composed himself to form it into a deep sneer which truly didn't suit him. "Potter." That was the only greeting he was going to get from Malfoy, he knew that and nothing else more. Harry took in his attire and was sort of surprised to find him in a comparatively simple garb. He wore a light pair of trousers, with cream shirt and an over coat of lighter shade- the outfit looked expensive and cheap at the same time, but Malfoy looked much put together than Harry did. Malfoy looked at him with narrowed and pushed his ungelled hair behind his ear, and shifted slightly. He realised he was not letting Malfoy out of the washrooms, but then he realised that somehow he didn't want to.
"Of blood? Of cum?" Harry provided but Draco shook his head.
"Yeah- yeah, and you wanna kiss Malfoy's arse. It would be
Harry was floored when he saw Malfoy again. Malfoy was dressed like a Muggle to say, but he still managed to look to proper and aristocratic in a sense. A part of blond hair was tied back with a black leather band and rest were left to his nape. He wore a light blue shirt and white trousers, they were pressed so crisp and right, there wasn't a thread out of place. Harry had to look at his own faded jumper and jeans, and felt inferior. He was brought back to sense when Rose tugged at his hand impatiently.
Draco managed to rasp out. “What’s it to you?”
"You should listen to your friend." The scruffy man held the other man with his collar and pointed his wand at the man's head. "If you both don't leave us, I will curse this lad and then both of you."
“I won’t repeat myself.”
He thought he was alone. That's why he jumped when someone called behind him. "Prince Draco." He huffed and turned around to see a very old man, his beard white as was his hair and he wore rimless glasses on his nose. Draco looked into those twinkling eyes of the man.
After having a proper six hour sleep at Ron and Hermione's, and getting a bouquet of lavender and white orchids, I was, the next morning, knocking on the door of Parkinson Palace. "Pansy!" I know my smile was blinding because she scrunched her face and groaned out. Only Pansy Parkinson could wear a white see through baby doll and dark red lipstick, sipping on a cup of hot lemon infusion and greet me with a bird already flipped out, at nine in the morning. "You look lovely!"
"How much?" He gave two fast jabs, as he sucked.
"Potter." Draco said to him around half an hour into his work. "could you scourgify-?" Harry nodded his head. "I'll be in the washroom then." Draco left him at that. He performed the spell on the door, before performing one on the device and attached the frame. He then prodded at the ends with a screwdriver. There was a click of door, he turned his head to see and saw Draco in a white towel, which was wrapped dangerously low around his waist. One pull and it would drop. He seemed quite comfortable with his condition, did he also appear in towels when there were visitors in his house? Did he also placed himself almost into somebody's lap if they even touched him a little? Did everyone fantasise about him like he did? To see that face of his, which he made two years ago? His grip on the screwdriver tightened and Harry was sure he would break the plastic if he didn't loosen his hold. He gulped.
Draco, with utmost care, places his hand on his chest and pushes him slightly back. "I have to say something to you. You need to promise something to me, my Prince."
"Nothing is going to happen to her!" Malfoy said quickly. "It's a painter's mind. She is developing it." Harry nodded again, he noticed how fidgety Malfoy was now. He tried to hide it well, but he kept on pulling at his fingers and blinked rapidly.
The moans and groans couldn’t be held back and his eyes rolled back when another incantation muttered and he felt so hollow, from inside and out and right on and at his skin, “When you told me you didn't need me anymore.”
Then he says things when he’s very close, and his thrusts get erratic, I never understand them. “Voldemort just missed this. He could never see your beauty , you know- I knew though, I knew you’re meant to be mine. From the day you said that you didn’t know me.”
"Yes, Potter." Draco glared down at him, holding the gun at his nose.  "I thought you had a bit of mind to know that already, to ask of it. Wonder how to manage such a big mob of goon, when your brain is at a level of a five year- ah! Oh my god!" Draco interrupted himself with a loud moan as Harry thrusted upwards, hitting him directly at his prostate which he purposely missed before. And he didn't stop at just one thrust, instead jabbed in the warm cannal repeatedly and quick at the same point. Draco drop one of his hand on the toned chest to support himself. His eyes rolled back and he squeezed them shut, short moans and gasps leaving his mouth. "oh god! Potter, please don't..." Draco almost prayed to him and he tightness his thighs and widened his hip bones. He heard a loud clang, but he chose to ignore it (it was possibly something outside), he had something other on his head now. He mewled when he felt large warm hands on his hips, rocking him along with the thrusts and his head fell back, his grip on his gun loosening and falling beside them. He dropped the other hand on the chest as well, as he pushed to jump on the length as much harder as he could.
Luna led Draco to the bank of the river. He didn't need the lights to see where he was being lead, the moon was bright enough for that. "sit down here" Luna whispers to him, and he saw a broad back in the river as it went down under the water. She sits him on the grass and kisses his cheek before she leaves him there. Draco gulps as the figure in the river was now standing completely, he seemed to be searching for something and then he turns around. Draco could feel his throat grow dry when the man approaches him in his naked glory. He closes his eyes and felt his cheeks heat up. "you're here." He says.
Roberts' frown deepened. "Tone, Malfoy." He reminded him before walking out of the room. "And get along well." He told them both, as he closed the door, but Draco knew the last statement was for him, and
He fell back cupping his cheek as he glared at the standing man. "why the fuck did you slap me?" He sneered at him.
Draco swallowed and tilted the vials into his mouth. "Please don't say that, ...my majesty." James chuckled, before drifting off.
"Where are we going?" He asked. His voiced echoed back and Draco winced at that. It was a wonder how the old man's voice didn't echo.
A few minutes might have passed when Draco turned her head and said slowly. "Is this all to it?" Harry frowned, not really understanding what Draco meant. But then movement turned to sticky from wet, Harry stopped herself and ran the hand which was on Draco's thigh to her fold to find it completely dry. Her whole spine went stiff and her breaths came out empty. Was she so into pleasuring herself that she forgot about Draco, the woman she was pinning after since so long? Her whole motive, when she kissed Draco, was to give her the night of her life. But instead the blonde was dry as draught.
"What?" I snapped at him.
"Yes. Am I looking okay? It's not too sober for club, right?" And that, wizards and witches, was a hard jab to his gut. He shook his head with a tight smile. "Great!" I turned to look at the antique Muggle mirror on the wall. "Should I put some stick on my lips?"
Harry squat infront of him, trying to look at the expression he was making. "I agree." Draco raises his head to meet his eyes. "but what about your Father?"
"You like to cuddle after sex?"
Fate was a bitch though, she didn’t let Draco protect himself and his senses for too long.
The next morning early on, Harry was crowned officially. He took the pledge and the oath to serve his Kingdom. Draco was crowned the queen despite him being a male. But a king deserved a queen, and it wasn't as if such didn't happen in history before. Harry didn't show much of emotion and remained quiet throughout the brunch which took place, having all of the officials in the crowd. His father's health wasn't improving and he was probably going to die. Draco did try to cheer him up by leaving chaste kisses on his cheek and gentle caresses, but he remained stern. As soon as it was over he strode to the library to meet Hermione, resuming what he was doing since past week. She was over a huge tome by the time he entered, and looked through small parchments.
"How do you know?"
"Nothing special."
I stood up from my chair. "How did- Now?"
"No, you're not." I lean down to kiss him and he moaned in my mouth. I never understood as to how he made every moan of his filthy, wanton and graceful, all at the same time. He then fell onto his knees and looked at me with smug eyes before taking my length in his mouth. I didn't even last five minutes, he drank all of the release like a thirsty man. "I need to get the Vite Grous Potion today." He said as he lapped  up remaining cum and I rolled my eyes.
Harry gave him a small smile, before walking towards him, holding the pale thigh in a vice grip. "you're anything but 'not appealing'. If it was in my control, I would have my way with you anytime, anywhere." He rubbed his finger on the puckered entrance before sliding it in, making Draco gasp. "looks like the potion prepares you quite thoroughly. It's all but slick in here." He slides in another finger and then another; breaching him with three fingers and moving them in a way that made Draco arch his back on the bed again and again. "wow! If I could, I would put in whole of my fist inside of you. Should I?" Draco let out a loud mewl, his whole body shivering with arousal. His legs would have shut close, if it wasn't for Harry's strong hand on them. He leant down and Draco's eyes rolled backwards when a warm mouth engulfed his length.
Draco shook her head. "I don't know. But I did say I want to try something." Harry frowned when Draco shrugged her shoulders and the red towel dropped to the floor. Long fingers then came up and placed themselves under the thin straps of the nightgown, pushing them down the bony shoulders making the satin slither down, next to coarse looking towel. Harry gasped aloud, unable to look away from Draco Malfoy standing naked in her hallway.
Draco yelled and screamed, pulling at his hands. Harry casted a binding spell, the legs were pulled taut and a rope wound around the ankles to somewhere Draco couldn't see, spreading his thighs in the motion. "now, Baby. Don't move your hands, okay? You know what Salazar will do if you do so." Harry moved back to stand, admiring the work he just created. He removed his belt and then unzipped his trousers, taking out his hard length. He stroked it a couple of times before he sat in middle of spreaded, naked, pale thighs.
"And why such sudden change of mood, Draco? Not that I mind but feel suspicious." The man grinned down at him and Draco suddenly realised the height difference between them, as he looked up.
"Fine. I just wanted to give you these." I realised he didn't know what I was talking about so I provided. "These, flowers. I got you orchids and some lavender stems. I know you love them. I know these aren't enough for an apology, but it's a starting, right?" He didn't say anything. "I'm just going to put them here and go. Okay, Draco?" He didn't reply, no assent, nor dissent. I put the flowers just at the side of the doors and left the place. I nodded at Pansy as I left, who was sitting on a chair of the dine table.
Harry couldn't bare to see the silver eyes he loved turn teary. "Draco, please-"
"I don't think he'll be unprepared. He has magic with him." Harry said grimly.
Since there was no point lying, I shook my head.
In middle of the night, almost close to two; I woke up feeling cold and stiff, I was sure I had put on the covers well on me and Draco sticked to me while he slept, his limbs around me like a giant octopus. I wavered my hand on the bed before opening my eyes to a blurry vision and put on my glasses, my hand met with a strong back. I furrowed my brows and casted a very low Lumos. Draco had his back to me, what caught my eyes was a sight way too adorable. Teddy was snuggled to his chest, his hair greyish brown (which reminded me of Professor Lupin) his arms around the man's torso and Draco cradling his head close to him. I felt a wide smile come onto my face when I saw that they both had stolen the blanket. I adjust the covers as I wrap my arms around both of them, kissing the nape of my husband.
"Now four things you can feel" Mr Balmy guided.
"Okay so we're going to go through some exercises that can help calm anxiety." Mr Balmy said calmly.
Suddenly Harry was ten years old, standing on his tip toes barely able to see into the pan with the sound of Dudley screaming about his tv behind him. He could feel his Uncle standing behind him, almost smelling his sweat before he heard the heavy thudding footsteps.
“Go have a seat Potter” The teacher said calmly.
For now I'll just give a basic overview. Generalised anxiety is exccessively worrying about issues in life, or disasters. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is when someone may go through certain rituals due to anxiety. Panic phobia is getting panic attacks due to certain triggers or even out of the blue. Social phobia is getting anxiety attacks or feeling anxious in social situations. Post tramatic Stress disorder is caused by a tramatic event, it can take the form of nightmares."
I felt my face heat up a bit, I wasn't too sure. Come to think of it Ginny had never really kissed anywhere apart from my lips. I admitted it softly and Draco looked almost...offended.
Draco’s shoes sounded harsh against the cold stone bricks, his shadow trailing after him under the flickering torches. He speed up to catch up to Potter who was walking outside, he could see Harry’s dark outline and saw his frosty breath ice up as he stepped outside the castle and started down the dimly lit hill into the forest.
"You don't think I should... Please tell me that is not why you are here."
"But...but I like girls!"
After being silent, Draco quirked an eyebrow.
"You know, Harry, I would love to go on a date with you but seeing as you're trying to disparate into that pillow I would have to wait till you asked me" Draco continued stepping close to the couch.
"So comfortably on your cushions and relax your shoulders. This exercise is a breathing exercise. You can close your eyes if it helps"
Draco's brow furrowed and then he turned around to stare at Hermione with disbelief.
"What no. That was for...he was up to something!" Harry said trying to defend the constant stalking and talking about Draco that he used to do.
"Harry. Just be yourself, besides Draco's been watching you since forever he knows what your normal behaviour is"
Suddenly Draco found himself pressed flush against against the rough bark of a damp tree with a wand pressed into the tip of his throat. Glaring deep green eyes and black shaggy hair met him.
"It can't be..."
Okay relax, deep breaths, everything's going to be fine.
It wasn't long before Harry had been transported to the Hospital Wing and Madam Pomfery was fussing over him and waving her wand near Harry's head. Then abruptly she straitened up and rushed to a book cabinet.
"Yeah okay but what do you like when other people are on top?"
Harry tried to concentrate, he could feel his heart beating strongly in his chest, it wasn't as fast as before but still as forceful. He could feel his shoelaces which felt frayed and stretched in between his fingers.  He could feel....the soft cushion he was sitting on. And he could feel the material of his jeans under his robes. And for some reason he could feel someone staring. It was probably Malfoy.
"Or maybe you're in a tiff with your lover."
"And it is my responsibility!" Harry and Hermione got into a heated argue with Ron siding in with both of them at few statements. But they stopped when Draco stood up and groaned, his face was green and his eyes watered. "Draco are you-" Draco's eyes widened, when sick pushes out of his mouth onto the floor, on top of their shoes.
A blonde boy, tiny fellow of three and quarters, splashed a rock into the pond. He watched in glee as the fish swam away. "They will never like you if you do that." A gentle but sharp voice said and the blonde boy looked up to see his father's advisor. His hair was grey and short, his skin was paste white and his eyes were red, but he still looked good to be considered. The boy stood up quickly from the edge of the pond and gave the man a quick bow. "But I like when they swim." "Weren't they doing it before?" The boy shook his head. He bent to pick another small rock and was about to throw it in too, towards a school of spotted goldfish, when a strong grip held his hand. The man paced and came behind him and placed his face on the boy's small shoulder. The rock was pried away from the little hand. "Why don't we do this?" "What?" The little prince asked haughtily. A growl of chuckle was blown into his pink ear. The man held his hand and pushed it out forward towards the pond. There was mutter in his ear and a bolt of lightning shot out of his hand and to the water. The splashes came onto his clothes and he was sure he would be getting a good sounding from the maids. "Look now." The fish were swimming haphazardly in the water, some gaping and some blinking. The blonde boy giggled and then erupted into laughter when the man dug his large face to his neck and licked at his neck. "Stop! It tickles!" But the man didn't, his large hands moved on his chest, as if pressing his wet shirt close to him. The boy blinked open his eyes and cried out. There was a fish floating atop the water now, and the boy could make out that it was dead. "You killed it!" He screamed and the man fell back. "You killed the fish! You're so bad!" The boy pushed at the large chest and ran away. The man just cursed behind before letting out a grin.
I actually did write the first chapter because I wanted this chapter to take place. But I couldn't just write this out of nowhere now, could I?
"Oh god Harry, you have become thinner."
"Let's get you changed." He shook his head, bouncing on his knees on either side of my thighs. "Draco." I call out to him strictly. "I'll remove your shirt now, okay?"
"Oh Merlin!" He didn't know what happened, he saw white behind the lids of his eyes and his back arched in a curve which he didn't know he could position himself into. He spurted over their chests and wetting the hand which was around his length. He could feel himself shiver and his insides clenching. He exclaimed when the length inside of him throbbed before splurging inside. "oh lord!"
"No." Harry shivered when he felt nimble fingers making nonsensical patterns on his skin. "it was my idea. We were going to send an actual whore. She's good at that. But then you had  called for a boy." He dragged his hand down to squeeze roughly at the pale arse. "I didn't know Padfoot was you, Potter!"
"It's Harry. C'mon say 'Harry, fuck me hard." Draco didn't reply, only thrusting backward. Potter pinched at his waist, going slow for a moment. "Draco." He said sternly. "Say it!"
"Yes! Yes sir! I fancy you so much. So much- so long! Oh my god please! Oh my-!" Draco screamed out loud when his cock released with a strong jerk, white staining his stomach. His walls clenched as well and his whole body shivered wildly. Harry came just a moment later, the tightening walls sucking him in. Draco whimpered feeling his insides fill up with hotness and some even managed to spill out when Harry softened in him. He gasped when Harry pulled out abruptly, he couldn't even manage to move and laid limp with exhaustion. He still shivered in intervals. Harry lifted himself and fell to side, on his back. He panted heavily relishing the post orgasm. He didn't have too much me-time when Draco leaned to him closer and wrapped his arms around him, his head situating on his chest.
Draco held his head close to him, tugging slightly at the black hair. He could feel himself harden again, and his legs spread apart, as he grinded himself upwards. He pulled at the belt and slid it from the hoops around Harry's waist before attacking the button. He slid his hand in the trousers, wrapping his fingers around the heavy length. He tugged slightly. Harry gripped at his wrist, stopping him. "If you continue, it won't be good for you." Draco swallowed before removing his hand.
The speed at which he was pumping at the lengths increased and Harry could hear himself groan as well. He was close and the way Draco was stiffening from time to time, made him realise that he was close as well. His cock throbbed and he was coming in long spurts. Draco shivered wildly as well and soon he too found his release. Harry opened his eyes and saw the closed eyes of his husband, he picked up the nearby bedsheet and cleaned their spent from their bodies. Draco rolled off of him.
I deepen the peck and squeeze his arse. "You still look amazing." We get a cry of excitement from inside the kitchen. "I'll go change."
"I'll handle this Blaise. Keep an eye on these miscreants while I'm gone."
"But Harry-"
"You're just imagining stuff, Malfoy." She managed to huff out.
"Yeah?" I thrusted in a bit harder than before, and then randomly jabbed at his bundle of nerves.
"So you liked the movie?" I brushed at his fringe.
"Yup. I go over there every six months or so."
"Mr Potter, so good to see you!"
"Then who did?!" She looked scary but Louis didn't look scared at all.
He was replied with a hissed form of chuckle. "There's no harm done to them. Your Father sits in Slytherin right now, your Uncle cleans my potion chambers with his wrists in shackles. But about your handmaiden- it's tough to say. She is quite pretty to not be touched by my men."
"None of your concern!" Draco snapped. At the very next moment a servant walked in with a tumbler of juice. Hermione motioned him towards the bed and picked up the the vessel, handing it out to the resting man.
"Let me help you." I almost spat out my drink.
Even though he couldn't see his eyes, Harry could feel him looking at the people around them. Draco's arms trembled in nervousness or heat. "I'd prefer to talk to you, alone."
"Is it dead?" Ron asked.
"Yes." He looked at me. Soft light flickered in his stern eyes. "He did."
"I was on my way to-"
"Ron?"
"Salazar! I said the same thing."
"Fuck you, Potter!" Draco spat at him, the spittle landing on his cheek. Harry smiled in return, leaning down to kiss him deeply. He swallowed the whimpers and cries, moaning in return. His tongue was nipped sharply and he dragged it out, not before biting the smaller tongue. Draco whimpered in pain.
.” Draco shivered when Potter called him by his first name, for the first time ever. His legs shook, and if it wasn’t for Potter holding him upright with a bruising grip on his neck he would have fallen arse first on to the floor. Potter noticed this too and he took a proper benefit out of it. “Draco,” he whispered in his ear. “Tell me.”
"Fucked you pretty good." Harry picked up the shirt from the floor which was fallen by the table and placed it on the pale shoulders. He pulled out the cloth from breast pocket and wiped at the bitten and bruised chest of the cum. "You should get dressed." He stood up before tucking himself in. He strode towards the table and picked up the gun, while Draco tried to gain his senses. "I'll be keeping this. You have a pretty bad habit of thrusting this onto my face." Harry slid it into the back of his trousers.
"What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you ,Draco? You're acting like ... A git! You're clubbing and chatting up to other men and making me spend my own money on your boy toys."
I sneered. "Yes, honey, you. We wanted to congratulate you. I heard that you were expecting." Her eyes widened and her already pink cheeks turned an ugly red with large blotches.
"Heavens! You scared me!" Draco said, etching a smooth smile on his face. He made sure his hips swayed as he walked closer to the bed and turned on the table light next to the bed. The pale white skin looked so much translucent and wrinkly. "Why are you in dark?"
"I'm not going to use it, you spawn of Devil." Draco sighed when Harry had wound his hand in his. "I had wanted to say that you're nothing but a wisp of darkness over this world and it would be so much greater without you in it."
"Yeah, through which I can see your tits."
"The first week, she can come and see if she would like to continue. You can start paying after that." Harry smiled at him and was about to say a word of thanks, when something fell atop him. It was fuzzy and black and it was clawed at his face making his glasses fall down to the floor. He could hear the crack of the glass. The thing pulled at his hair and screeched wildly, Harry had his wand out in reflex and was about to hex the damn thing off, but then it was pried off of him. His fingers met cool texture of glass and he looked at the side to see blurry figure of Rose handing him his glasses. When he put them on he saw her snickering, and Malfoy held a fat, black cat in his arms. The creature hissed at him, and its owner hissed too. "Potter! Wand!" Harry quickly slipped back his wand in his sleeve, looking a bit abash at what he was doing- waving around his wand in an open Muggle area. He felt his face and winced where he felt the scratch. It wasn't deep, it didn't even hurt, but it sure it bleed. Malfoy might have noticed it too. "Oh Merlin!" He took a step forward, but then stopped himself. "He has scratched you. Does it hurt?"
"Okay now three things you can smell."
"I'm not going to ask bloody Draco Malfoy out"
"Do you want me to.." I started, feeling guilty that he wasn't getting equal attention.
The professor opened the door and Harry almost ran into the room, sitting as far away from Draco as possible.
This is very long overdue, anyways hope you enjoy. I wrote this due to my own personal experiences and working through difficult times.
Hermionie looked up and then had her thinking face on, she got up wordlessly and started pacing.
The first thing he noticed was that Potter didn't eat much, if any at all and would excuse himself to go for a walk before dinner ended.
"Really? And stalking him in sixth year wasn't?" Hermionie asked teasingly.
"Then why on earth are you talking to me? Go get the weaslete I'm sure he'll wake up in no time"  Draco snapped and then reverted his attention back to the black board.
“Yes Professor?”
"Come on before I change my mind Granger" Draco snapped.
Truth be told Harry felt lonely, he couldn’t sleep. He felt just shit. Yeah just shit. Maybe he had that anxiety thing that professor was talking about. Who even cared, not like anything could make it any better. With his mind whirling he turned over yet again, closing his eyes he saw the dead faces of all the students who died because of him flash before him.
Harry sighed in exasperation and then checked his watch for the thousanth time. It was time.
"Do you like guys as well? Sexuality is such a broad spectrum it's not just straight and gay. You can like both genders. You can only like one. You could like someone based on personality and not gender." Hermionie explained.
As the next week passed others seemed to notice this too and questioned him but they only got a one word awnser at best and an excuse to go do homework. It wasn't until Draco noticed Potters leg jumping one day under his desk that Draco tried in earnest to read Potter's body language. He was sitting upright, so paying attention? No. He must just be tense. He was fiddling so must be thinking about something or just uneasy. His eyes were set on a corner of the desk so definetly distracted. He was worrying his bottom lip in his teeth and so he must be worried about something but what? The dark lord was dead for heaven sake! But...suppose that left a scar mentally as most everyone had a scar or two in their minds because of the war.
Mr. Smith is an expert in brain bio- chemistry and researched in great deal how the brain chemistry changes due to mental illness and stress. He had lost a family member close to him due to suicide and works to help others overcome their mental illness.
"Okay whenever you're ready open your eyes, were going to do another exercise."
Draco Malfoy is on top of me. And he's warm, Merlin so warm and I almost can't breathe. And he's looking at me with such a heated intensity, it's impossible to look away.
And after it was all done I lay and stared at the ceiling. Holy Merlin. I was still fiarly breathless.
Harry had held it out with wide scared eyes and almost not registering that it got pushed roughly directly onto the surface of the hot pan. The hot pain followed too sudden for him to cry out, he simply stood there and felt and smelt his hand burning.
Then a voice from the enterence spoke
"You should talk to him" Ron suggested at lunch.
It didn’t feel like a question. Suddenly all the attention was back on him and it felt very uncomfortable. He stood up and walked over to the front of the class standing in front of the cooking station, it was a typical gas stove. There was some food items sitting on the counter surface.
The question caught him off guard, he cleared his throat which suddenly felt tight.
"I hate him! I hate his gorgeous face and soft hair and beautiful eyes! Ugh why can't he be a toad? I wish he was a toad so I didn't have to blush every time he looks at me! You know what he did yesterday? He bloody put his hand around my waist. Like no keep your magical hands to yourself! Ugh!" Harry ranted and then flopped onto the couch. Hermionie and Ron shared a glance and then Hermione spoke.
Potter did not look up at him again, and he was poking at his food, taking a bite of toast before excusing himself and leaving the great hall. Draco let him go this time, he would follow him again tonight.
"I'm sure everyone has felt anxious for an exam or test. You get those butterflies in your stomach but I'm here to talk to you about anxiety. Some common symptoms of anxiety are shaking, feeling very cold or very hot, a rapid heart beat and feeling nauseous. Before I get into the details of this I want you to know just what anxiety is. Anxiety is the body's natural response to danger. It generally comes about when you feel stressed, under pressure or threatened. But for some people this doesn't leave. That's what anxiety is essentially."
Harry nodded and both of them went on their way. Conversation was easy, which surprised Harry, it almost didn't feel as daunting now. And when Draco slipped his hand into Harry's, he found it the most natural thing.
He paused and took a deep breath before walking to a desk behind him and getting sheets of paper.
"Ummm yeah what is it?" She asked tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear.
"Okay, that was one method you can use to help ground yourself, to become aware of the present instead of the future and the past, now we'll move on to other exercises"
Concentrating, Harry listened, and picked out the sound of someone breathing loudly. Diverting away from that he could hear the gently breeze as it blew in through a partially open window.
"The kissing or the date? I'm fine with both"
"I know, I've seen it all too he just keeps himself cut off and I don't know how to help him"
Draco looked up and replied "oh...well I guess I do. During the war I went through an incredibly dark time and I don't want Potter to go through that because he knows he's got people who care he just needs some help going through whatever he's going through"
