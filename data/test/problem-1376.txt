Sighing, she leant over and showed him the trackpad. ‘Here. He has loads of stupid videos. You just use this square to move the little pointer on the screen. And see those videos on the side? You select them by pressing down on the square. Got it?’
Draco resented the fact that his heartrate had quickened, simply from Harry’s sudden proximity. He was too old for that sort of response. That ship had sailed long ago.
, he thought fondly, as he tuned out the sound of Professor Binns droning on about the vampire revolt of 1238.
Harry searched for the right thing to say, but he hadn’t a clue. This was getting awkward, but clearly something was the matter even if Malfoy’s wasn’t saying so.
But Draco would’ve died. And, perhaps selfishly, Harry was glad that Draco hadn’t done something overly-brave and foolish to endanger himself. Harry thought he understood Draco’s feelings though, as he’d certainly agonised over all the times he’d been unable to save someone—and in those moments he had
Draco stood for a moment, just staring at the spot Harry'd just occupied. Swallowing, he felt the heaviness in his limbs—more evident now that Harry wasn't distracting him.
He reached over to the nightstand to pick up his glasses, and put them on. Dream-Draco's image became sharper.
Besides, Harry’d thought they were going to ignore all that past fantasy business—forget it ever happened.
Harry blinked a bit. 'Oh. Okay. Well I didn't think we were necessarily going to go straight to that today. That is to say, there's no rush or anything—I don't have any expectations out of tonight. I'm just happy to be with you, even if it's just lying down … lying down and actually sleeping … yeah, that's brilliant in itself.'
After they were sufficiently dry, they wrapped the towels around their waists and went back into the bedroom.
“Uh—” he began, scrambling to the foot of his bed to get a closer look, and then he searched around the room for a spellcaster. “Is someone there?”
“Of course you did,” Harry said, smiling cheekily. He pushed off of Draco, and moved to grab his pants from the floor.
Hermione looked annoyed, but also a bit like she were trying not to laugh. “Ron … she meant peanuts.”
He grit his teeth, and found himself moving towards the circle, though he didn’t really want to. He couldn’t stop himself, though.
Malfoy was staring at him. ‘I … I have an inheritance from my maternal grandmother. You would’ve liked her, she was kind, kind
Astoria looked at his cock, and hesitated for a beat, then she licked it. A small lick, just a flick of her tongue, really. He held back another flinch. Salazar, he was so tense—every muscle seemed to be bracing for something bad to happen.
‘Well, I’m so glad you have each other, Harry. We all need someone we can trust, someone we can depend on, and open up to, who won’t judge us harshly for our secrets.’
'Draco,' Harry whined out, as the pleasure built and built and built. Fucking hell. 'Draco, I think—' His orgasm surprised him, rippling out his body, shooting in white hot bursts against Draco's hand and the shower wall.
A smile grew on Hermione’s mouth, as she shook her head, like she couldn’t quite believe he’d done it. “Well, how was it?”
Maybe Harry should’ve been better after the Mind Healer visit. Draco had been upset about something, and Harry hadn’t even tried to ask him about it. He’d just gone along with things, watched a film and then fallen asleep
'Ah,' Draco said, with a slight smile, as if Harry'd answered a question about the weather. He moved to lift up his nightshirt.
Harry seemed to come back into himself. 'Oh. Nothing. Yeah, you've just about covered the requirements, I think.'
-I have been to Pisa, Italy, but, like Draco, it's been a while. So if I've gotten any of the details wrong, I'm sorry, and feel free to let me know. Same goes for the Italian and Spanish words. My Italian is very basic, and my Spanish is worse.
He could already hear odd, breathy music coming from the house, and the front door was decorated in a variety of ghoul-shaped green and red blinking lights.
Then Luna’s hand was softly pressed against Harry’s thigh, and her hair brushing over his arm. She was whispering in his ear, kindly, gently. ‘It’s your turn to spin, Harry.’
Oh. Of course. The wedding had already happened, so of course he was too late in getting what they needed. Oh well. It’d been a thought, anyway.
Sat in a paisley-patterned armchair, Draco’s head was bowed, and he had his hands folded in his lap.
He got up to go fetch a piece of parchment, so that he could send a reply to Harry’s last note, and send along the socks.
They wandered around the room together, sipping their drinks, nodding or saying a quick hello to a stranger. Maroon was pretty good, Harry decided. Weird to have something the consistency of wine with the flavour of eggnog, but … still quite decent. Could be worse.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. ‘No? I suppose it wouldn’t be very Gryffindor of you to off me in a hospital bed. Wouldn’t be very
The painted symbol in the air grew bigger and bigger, coming closer and closer to their faces—starting to fill the width of the circle.
So, while Harry worked on grinding the spices together with mortar and pestle, Draco brought his knitting bag over to the kitchen table.
it with him. Had it. He didn’t want to look at that sodding face any more. Harry shoved him back against the wall and spun to storm off, but his foot caught on something, kicking it.
‘”I’m sorry for the things I’ve done,”’ Neville quoted, tilting his head pensively. ‘Has someone wronged you, Harry? Then sailed off to Africa?’
Merlin, did he? Would he say ‘like’? His imagination conjured the memory of Malfoy tucking a strand of hair behind his ear, speaking softly to a First Year in his classroom.
A simpler question in wording, but much more complex to answer, would be: did Harry want to kiss Malfoy?
In another life, in another body, he’d relish the opportunity to do something as simple as swim with Harry Potter. To sit in a hot tub together. And to sit in a hot sauna together, with steam wrapping around them like a blanket, the strong scent of warm cedar... and, fuck, aren’t people nude in those sometimes?
Draco lay himself down properly, with his head on the pillow. So Harry followed suit, not quite knowing where this was going—but interested nonetheless. They looked up at the yellow canopy above them.
‘All right—you don’t even have to tell him how you feel, or that you went to Ibiza for him. Plenty of people vacation there. Maybe it could be happenstance, you showing up. Like, wow, what a surprise! And hey, now that you’re here, let’s grab a drink!’ She grinned. ‘Then you just see what happens. Who knows, maybe you’ll get along.’
Turning, he saw Harry lying on his stomach there—edged onto Draco's side of the bed—and still fast asleep even after that awful alarm. His hair was in absolute disarray, and his lips parted. He looked exceptionally relaxed with face half covered by the pillow.
They reached the front doors, and Malfoy pushed them open, holding the door for Harry to pass through.
This was a man who'd run off to find himself. And he had … on an island in the Balearic sea. Making music for dancing, music for joy. This was the man who swims naked, who lays on his back and looks up at the stars.
At first Draco tried to match Potter’s movements, but they seemed so random that it was hard to keep up. Draco laughed at himself, trying to imitate a hip gyration that Potter was doing. Merlin.
He sighed, marking the page with a green silk bookmark. “Yes?” he called out from the comfort of his bed.
. They grow and harvest it themselves, it’s so fresh and robust. He is going to give me a tin. I’ll ask him to give one to you, too.’
When Harry closed his eyes and let himself imagine the writer who belonged to this particular hand-writing, he thought of a man with long, thin fingers—a nice palm-size to finger-length ratio. Someone wearing a thick maroon cardigan, in a study lined with tall bookshelves with a grand piano in a corner, and a window behind him that looked out onto dense snowy forest.
“Come here, sweetheart,” said Hermione, placing Malfoy’s hate mail on the table. “Let’s go wash our hands for dinner.”
“So. Do you want to talk about your miserable love life, then?” Draco asked, pouring some maroon into Harry’s nearly empty cup.
Soon enough they kicked off, with their borrowed brooms. Harry flew high up into the bright blue sky, looking down to watch the canopies, tables, people and trees shrink below him. A cool summer breeze ruffled his hair, and the world felt still, felt silent—save for the distant sounds of Muggle electronic dance music. Draco followed him, with white-blond hair whipping behind himself. Harry turned to face him. It had been so long since they could do this—it felt rather nostalgic and exciting to be in the air opposite Draco.
'Salazar.' Draco shook his head, and swiped a palm over his face. 'Just forget about it. Life seldom turns out how one would wish. We became … friends, and only friends.'
Harry didn’t know what to say to that. Snarky, bratty, 11-year-old Draco Malfoy, holding his hand out to shake his, came into Harry’s mind.
He ran into Neville unexpectedly. Harry had one last important message to give him: ‘Kill Nagini, kill the snake.’
—so good, so bloody incredible, to have Draco's fingers both places at once. Harry tilted his head to capture Draco's lips into an open-mouthed kiss. Draco pushed into him, leaning him up against the shower wall, as his finger eased in and out of him, and his other hand pumped at his cock.
The dining room was well-lit, with large windows that looked out onto a garden. Since it was autumn, though, there wasn’t much to see besides dry, barren bushes and red-leaved trees out there.
Draco smoothed the lubricant over his cock. Harry leaned up on an elbow to watch Draco’s hand movements—watch the pink, hard shaft come to shine with the slippery substance.
The sound of gum cracking was following him. Draco suppressed a wince, and instead tried to focus on the monstrosities he was looking at. Giant colourful things, with different texturing, different bits sticking out. Alien penises. That would be how he’d describe them. Like something out of a Muggle science fiction film.
Harry grinned, despite his low mood over the weekend that hadn’t left. “No, it definitely wasn’t as fun.” Ginny and him had been happy, then. All their friends were there—they’d laughed all night, and
Draco chewed and swallowed his mouthful. ‘We should save the flirting for after we eat. I know how you are with skipping meals.’ He smirked a little, and returned to his Pad Thai.
Hermione saw it, mulled it over in an instant, and began to nod. “It wasn’t just a kiss for you,” she said quietly.
The surrealism of the situation struck Harry, seemingly out of nowhere. Draco Malfoy, son of Lucius Malfoy, was in the dirt, at
Draco pinched his mouth closed, and shook his head slightly. Harry could tell Draco was holding himself stiffly, like he was afraid of Harry's reaction to this.
‘Ah ... well, I suppose …' He was disappointed, yes. But it did make sense—he couldn’t spend all day, every day, watching Harry Potter’s videos at Pansy’s house. It was … unrealistic. Possibly somewhat unhealthy. Okay … definitely unhealthy.
Harry smiled at him, and led them down the sidewalk over to a cosy little beige restaurant with tables set out front. They were all arranged underneath a long awning, sheltering the few patrons there from the bright morning sun.
Draco sat on the edge of his bed, as Harry went over to rifle through his bag. “I s’pose you’ll want to swim today? That’s likely the only activity you can do, on account of the rain.”
Thick snowflakes fell from the sky, diverted by wards to make it look like an ever-moving veil of snow on all sides. White chairs were set up for the guests, with light blue ribbons and delicate wildflowers tied to the back of each one. They all faced an intricately carved ice archway, wrapped with its own ribbons and tiny flowers.
He especially noted the part about Draco not being ready for romance … If he’d been pretty sure he should rein in his feelings before, he was even more certain now.
Draco narrowed his eyes, and seemed to be mulling that over. “So, you’re telling me ... if I’d left you alone, you might’ve turned up in Slytherin. Is that what you’re saying to me?”
His heartrate sped up. What had started out as a relaxed evening, seemed to be quickly turning into something that could ruin... well, ruin a lot.
have salt and pepper,’ Harry echoed, aghast, turning to Draco whom was looking decidedly displeased. ‘You aren’t sure?’
“What’s gotten your mood?” Astoria asked finally, looking exasperated at him, while he was gazing out of the living room window despondently.
Harry uncrossed his arms, and hugged Draco around his middle. He was wearing that same fuzzy dressing robe from the night he’d snuck into Gryffindor Tower. So soft, and warm. (And Draco smelled good, still like something fresh and citrusy.)
Harry tried again, swiping a hand along her back. Yeah, admittedly she was soft. Candelabra leaned into him, purring like a little machine. Okay, she might be cute.
People laughed. Harry smiled weakly, and made his way back to his spot beside Luna. He was quite determined to avoid looking at that arsehole Malfoy again.
In response, the flickering figure of a girl appeared, cross-legged at the end of his bed. Her head was tilted, like she was trying to figure him out.
"You've got it all wrong—" he said again. It felt like she was taking this conversation so far away ... so far out of his control ... that it felt like she was driving the boat and he was hanging on, by a rope, nearly drowning in the water behind her.
Harry sighed. Guess it was time to admit it. “I’ve asked Malfoy out.” He winced, anticipating a negative reaction.
It’d just sort of come out. He wanted to know the answer though, quite badly, because … he couldn’t fathom why his ex-rival would ever even have thought to.
They settled into the bench, and Draco caught a weird moment of seeing Granger staring at Pansy from underneath her eyelashes. And it wasn’t a stare of disdain or disgust. It almost seemed... like she was checking Pansy out. Interesting.
Harry's eyes dropped down from the camera, smiling like he had a secret, and sucked his bottom lip into his mouth.
'I don't know.' He ran his fingers over the plastic keys in front of him, avoiding Morgan's eye. Not because he was emotional or anything, but … well, he wasn't sure he wanted to talk about it much. 'It was enjoyable. They have very nice beaches.' He eyed her, to check if she were going to drop it.
Harry looked around wide-eyed at the décor—Draco'd painted the walls and ceiling in a muted purple, with little dabs of yellow paint all over to resemble stars. And from the ceiling hung several criss-crossing strands of fairy lights. The bed itself was a queen—draped with a fluffy white comforter like a cloud, and dotted with many multi-coloured pillows. He also had a somewhat-disappointingly-normal wooden nightstand and matching wardrobe, plus a white-curtained window.
Harry thought all of a sudden. And it shocked him. He felt guilty the moment he thought it—nauseous from it, the feeling twisted around in his gut. He tried to squash the thought immediately, but it wouldn’t squash.
“Harry!” called Luna cheerfully, dressed from head-to-toe spandex as a red-striped candy cane. “Oh do come in!”
Well, Draco liked this one—liked this one a lot. It was a fun song. He remembered the words, even. He’d certainly watched the video enough times, since it was one of the few with Potter’s voice.
The young-ish people were rounded up. Ginny and George were designated team captains and picked their teams. Hermione, Neville, and Luna even joined in. Harry was picked for Seeker by Ginny, and Draco picked by George for the same.
. He leaned forward. “How so?” Merlin, he was showing too much interest, he just couldn’t help himself.
He didn’t know why he wrote that. He just didn’t want it to be Terry Boot, because Terry Boot was the absolute worst.
Harry licked at his bottom lip, and found himself unable to meet Malfoy’s eyes in that moment. “You know what you look like.”
Draco took deep breaths and closed his eyes, holding on to the towel rack to ground himself. He was fine, he was safe now.
Draco carried on. Class was fine. Lunch was fine. Class was fine. Dinner was fine. Studying was fine.
. He sat up in bed, feeling his pulse quicken already. Maybe they were going to do it again—essentially wank together, help each other get off. He was … definitely interested in the prospect.
‘Oh. Yeah. His family was from Bombay,’ Harry said, grabbing a pack of boneless, skinless chicken breast.
Harry realised his mouth was open—and promptly closed it. He was staring at the space Malfoy’s back disappeared from. His heart was racing.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's sated and spent body, holding him close. 'You're fucking amazing.'
‘Well, I know what Albus would do. A clever speech, some rallying words.’ McGonagall sighed, turning to Dumbledore’s currently empty portrait on the wall. ‘How we do miss him.’
A lump formed in Draco’s throat, and the backs of his eyes began to sting. He blinked rapidly, and clenched and unclenched his hands, willing himself to be rational about this—and failing.
Malfoy paused; his fingertips touched the table top, waiting. He was obviously ready to flee, and Harry could so easily let him.
Malfoy inhaled sharply. ‘Semblance of normalcy.’ His hands found Harry’s bare torso—mapping its contours, its lines, its scars, his nipples, and his navel with the pads of his fingertips.
She turned to him, eyes a bit wide, but looking like she were trying to suppress her awe at his generosity (or whatever you might call it—his blatant disregard for responsible spending, perhaps). “All right sir, shall we have it shipped to the couple?”
“Ghosts can’t write letters, Harry …" Hermione repeated. “Sometimes they can move physical objects, but its erratic at best. Simple objects, like … shifting a mug a bit. Holding a quill up to a piece of parchment, well—that's much too sophisticated.”
He turned around and noticed his unmade bed next to Potter’s made one. It seemed a depressing sight, a symbol of his solitude, so he made up his own bed, even though he knew he didn’t have to. Housekeepers came around every day to tidy up, he’d been told.
She smiled back, with love in her eyes. Merlin, he was lucky to have her—to have all his friends, really.
Draco watched him, watched him toss the t-shirt aside onto the floor, and then push down his pyjama bottoms and pants from underneath the blanket.
She'd changed her hair again. No longer bright green and styled up like fire. Now, it was white, and smoothed back. It was elegant this way, but he had rather liked the cheerful green better.
“Oh.” Draco’s eyebrows went up, and he pinched his mouth closed. “Oh,” he said again. “Right. Sorry.” A pause, and then he tapped his palm awkwardly against Harry’s arm.
And they’d talked way more already than they had all year. And it’d felt … almost natural. Almost easy.
. The man whose ‘Potter Stinks’ badge you’ve kept in your trunk all these years for some reason.” Hermione sighed. “Oh my God, Harry. You’ve fancied him longer than you’ve realised, haven’t you?” she asked dryly.
Harry turned, and caught Draco mid-yawn, padding into the kitchen. Harry straightened and shut the fridge door.
Harry handed back his empty glass, taking the third clear one and drinking a big gulp. He swallowed and met Draco’s eyes. ‘Water. Maybe not a bad idea. Want some?’
Draco raised an eyebrow. He wasn’t sure he liked where this was going. Unless it was a sexual thing, because in that case it’d be a definite ‘yes’ from him.
and they were all forced to wear Muggle clothing (Pansy had picked out his clothes for him—assuring him they were the height of Muggle fashion—ha! As if flannel and blue ‘jeans’ could be described as ‘fashion’ in any circle). What was worse: they weren’t allowed any magic. They weren’t even allowed to bring their
Harry blinked back at him, evidently stunned out of his downward-spiralling monologue. His eyes were so bright... and his face seemed so very
Harry shook his head, and smiled a little—still watching the other dancers with a far-away, unfocussed look. ‘I annoyed my friends, talking about you.’
A warm paper package was dropped into Draco's hand. he brought it up to his mouth, and tore it open with his teeth. It smelled great. He took a big bite.
Harry walked to his kitchen, feeling off about the whole situation already. He hadn’t thought sex was an issue until now. Though: he was pretty sure there was a lot more to it than just sex.
‘Hmm, I could clean my apartment an eleventh time, read a Potion Ingredient Reference from beginning to end. Or … I could have sex with Harry Potter, and have him make Scotch pancakes for me.’
“You’re making it quite clear that you don’t want to bother trying.” It was Malfoy’s choice, and he didn’t need to keep rubbing it in.
Draco raised his eyebrows, and, before he could respond with anything, he had Potter’s cup shoved into his hands.
anything. And I think I’ve been lonely, and bitter about it … without even realising it.’ Harry rubbed his forehead, not daring to meet Draco’s eyes yet. ‘What I’m trying to say is … I’m glad I was stupid and risky and daring today … it reminded me of who I am—or who I used to be.’
In the end, the letter had more of a teasing tone to it, and, if he didn’t know Malfoy better, he might even think it was a bit flirtatious. But that was a preposterous thought, since Malfoy had only just gotten married—and was definitely not flirting. He wouldn't ... not ever, certainly never with Harry, married or not.
Potter touched Draco’s forearm, so Draco turned to him. Potter’s expression was bright, his face a bit sweaty, as he combed the fingers of his other hand through his curls. ‘I like a swim after a night of dancing.’
“Someone’s got a thing for you now, huh? Well, congratulations,” she said with a teasing smile. “They’re quite a … wordsmith.” She snickered into her hand.
Taken aback, Harry stopped in his tracks; he’d thought everything was good between them. ‘I need to speak to you …’ He licked his lips. ‘I have news.’
“It’s fine, darling. I’m allowed to speak to him, aren’t I? And don’t you know I’d never jeopardise your chances?”
Once again, they wound through the vehicles in the parking lot, and found the entrance to the path that would take them to the little private clearing.
Draco tore his eyes from the screen, and turned to face Harry—who looked back at him so earnestly and warmly, with eyes bright. Draco pressed what was meant to be a quick kiss against Harry’s mouth, but Harry took hold of the sides of his face, and kept him there, swiping his tongue against Draco’s.
But the lift certainly did feel like it was going down. It chimed open at level ‘B’, and a bunch of wet children in bathing suits and towels scrambled on. Suppressing a shudder, Draco hunched into the corner, and kept his chin held high. The children chattered very noisily, and one of them mashed the ‘4’ button repeatedly, but thankfully they all paid him no mind.
He thought about it for a moment—thought about why he was single. “Maybe I’m single because everyone’s only interested in me because of what I did at seventeen, and I feel so far removed from that version of me that when people treat me like some larger-than-life hero, my instinct is to shrink away and retreat. They’re only bound to be disappointed in the real me.”
Madam Pomfrey put her hands on her hips. ‘Now, Mr Malfoy, I know you’ve been through quite an ordeal, and I’m quite glad that you and Mr Potter have
Friend? Suppose Harry couldn't say former nemesis turned somewhat-amiable acquaintance. Still, it sounded nice, really quite nice, to hear.
Despite how excited he felt, he took the box to his kitchen, sat it down on his new oak table, and put the kettle on. Harry was going to savour this. He took out a mug, and a tea bag, and waited for the water to boil—all while leaning back against the counter starring at the box with a goofy, embarrassing smile on his face.
That had been ... abrupt. They hadn’t said ‘I love you’, they hadn’t even said good night. Or talked about their night. (When was the last time they’d said ‘I love you’ to each other?).
Harry kissed back. God, he hadn’t kissed anyone in ages. He absolutely loved kissing. And Malfoy was good at it. He buried his fingers in Malfoy’s silky hair.
Well, that was a relief, at least. That meant she’d had some discretion, thus far. Hadn’t yet announced ‘From Draco’ in her windy voice to a group of laughing Gryffindors.
Ron frowned, but nodded. “I think I get it ... I’d be miserable if I couldn’t come home to Hermione every day.”
Harry was beginning to feel almost claustrophobic. Not quite, just … he could use some air. He’d been so used to camping in the Forest of Dean, the silence there, the open spaces, that he was finding the Burrow difficult to bear at the moment.
It wasn’t quite enough, Harry pushed into it, trying to get Draco to keep his mouth flush against his. Harry swiped his tongue against Draco’s bottom lip—which Draco met a fraction of a second later with his own tongue.
They pushed through the doors of waiting room ‘B’, as Harry held his breath. He believed Draco, he did. He trusted him. Still … there was always a part of him that was going to fear the worst.
He couldn’t even play the c.d. within Hogwarts, of course, since Muggle technology didn’t work within the castle walls.
Harry smiled, all-too-amused, and shrugged. “You can take it off and go barefoot. Or, I don’t know, want to borrow one of mine?”
Then he twisted around for a moment, and returned with conditioner in his palm. Draco repeated the same movements, massaging Harry's scalp.
He exchanged a look with Hermione, like they were telepathically pitying each other, and, wishing each other luck. He sighed. Then, he gathered up his things to bring them over to Malfoy’s table. As he passed Parkinson, she narrowed her eyes at him—which, seemed quite uncalled for, on account of her being the one who wanted to give him away to Voldemort and not the other way around.
'Hello,' Draco answered, fumbling to take off his coat with one hand, because the other was holding a box. He managed to hang it up, and stepped deeper into his flat. 'Sorry it took longer than I thought.'
He should really fill the window box with flowers, Harry thought. As it stood, it held soil with a few limp weeds that’d managed to make it a home.
Memories flashed by of a tinier Draco trying to distract him, trying to get Harry to react and notice him …
“I … God I hope so. I hope you can.” She searched the ghosts face, pawing at not-really-there shoulders.
“Ah.” It didn’t make sense. Draco looked down at his lap, at his clasped hands there. He was going to need to think about this. “Can I... do you mind if I get dressed now?”
? You’ve never talked about anyone besides Cho, or Ginny, so I’m just asking. You’re awfully not-calm for someone I thought yesterday was straight.”
That snapped Draco out of his straight-faced Buddhist monk look. He turned to Harry with interest evident. “What?”
Draco looked up from his plate with bright eyes. He looked at Harry—and for a moment it felt like they were both acknowledging what happened. That they were having a secret moment.
Draco blinked over at him, realising—after a delay—that there was a small paperback in Harry’s hand. “A book?” he echoed.
Astoria had gone off to her book club meeting with friends, and Draco had been a bit bored sitting around the flat all by himself. So, before long, he ventured out into the cold, snowy streets in search of something to entertain himself.
But, that was easier said than done, because it was becoming quite clear throughout the day that Draco was avoiding him. And was a very fast walker. He’d keep disappearing around corners with black robes fluttering behind himself.
The question caused Draco to falter, and narrowly miss stepping on his foot. What exactly was Harry asking? ‘I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.’ Draco furrowed his brow, and resumed dancing in time to the beat. He tried to read something in Harry’s expression—but couldn’t find answers there. Harry couldn’t have asked what Draco thought he was asking.
Potter wanted Draco’s stupid poem. It gave him a little thrill—and Draco almost considered giving it back to him, so that he could see his face as he read Draco’s silly, idiotic, yet undeniably truthful, thoughts.
“Sorry, I couldn’t wait even a moment longer.” Potter turned on the tap next to him and washed his hands. “What are you doing?”
Draco hesitated, and then bumped Weasley’s shoulder lightly with his fist. “And, you know, ditto the obligatory don’t-hurt-my-friend-or-else. About Blaise. He’s a good man.”
Draco rubbed absently at his chin, as he looked out into the distance. “I’d always thought you were the perfect couple.”
A Friday evening Floo-call surprised Draco, right in the middle of one of such solo dance sessions. He shut off the Wireless and sat cross-legged in front of the hearth.
‘The Mark doesn’t make a difference in whether or not you get helped … For the record ... I don’t believe you accepted it willingly.’
After the three of them finished eating, Professor Flitwick came over with a clipboard and had them sign up for
He just needed to brush his teeth and to dry his hair. There was one of those... hair dryer things. It was purple and plastic and a bit odd, attached to the wall near the sink. He unhinged it to examine it.
‘Well … at least that what Pansy said,’ Harry said. Merlin, he’d made it awkward. ‘And Charlotte. I realise
, granted, generally the spells I researched were intended for lovers to communicate across distances. And,
'Excellent. Let's go have an Ibizan breakfast, yeah?' He slowed the car to a stop behind another un-moving one, and adjusted the nob in between their seats.
Malfoy’s eyes were dilated, as he licked his bottom lip. “Gladly.” He pushed Harry’s legs apart, and felt with his fingers to make sure his spell had worked.
‘Okay. Great,’ Harry said, licking at his bottom lip, and moving into the kitchen to get it started.
Draco carefully arranged himself, lying down beside Harry flat onto his back, and Harry scrambled to sit up and look the length of Draco’s lean body—the long expanses of pale skin, the ready and twitching pink cock. Harry leaned over to plant hard kisses on Draco’s lips—on his jaw, and swung a leg over him to straddle his hips. Then, Harry moved a hand behind himself to grip Draco’s slippery cock—intending to try to guide it in.
Angelina laughed with a hand over her mouth, and George smirked, saying, ‘Yeah you guys aren’t subtle.’
Draco watched the muddy ground carefully as he walked, looking out for any more particularly muddy bits, when Harry stopped abruptly. Had he lost his shoe too? Draco looked, and, no...
So... so Draco slid his hands in that space between Harry’s elbows and his torso, over his waist. Harry wasted no time in wrapping his arms around Draco’s shoulders, pulling him in quickly, flush against Harry. Harry buried his head in the crook of Draco’s neck, breathing in.
Immediately, the fluorescent lighting assaulted his senses. He didn't know why he thought it'd be darker, but it had all the ambience of a corner shop. Shelves and displays cluttered the place, and Draco had to stand still for a moment, just to acclimatize. Everything seemed to be flavoured condoms, pornography, and dildos in brightly-coloured packaging lining the shelves. Wonderful. He tried not to scrunch up his nose.
The hot drink was delicious—chocolatey and minty—and he savoured it slowly as he let his mind wander.
Draco hummed noncommittally, and caught eye contact with his son across the dancefloor. Scorpius grinned at him, so Draco raised his hand in a little wave to say, “Hi. I see you. I love you.” Scorpius raised an eyebrow, and shifted his gaze pointedly towards Harry. Draco rolled his eyes, and shook his head a fraction—but he couldn’t help but smile.
She clicked through the photos of Dalt Vila, to the photo of Draco looking scandalised with the wood cock bottle opener inserted in his hand.
Or, maybe he’d be better off writing that Potter needs to forget it. Forget about his mystery admirer, because the person on the other end is never the one you’re hoping for. Potter likely hoped a cute girl was sending him notes, and not his bitter—very
‘It’s not you, it’s the Dark Lord. Who else would it be?’ Malfoy said, looking up at him, expression guarded.
Draco twisted, and reached for something on the rack behind himself. He turned back around with a hand full of shampoo, and brought it up to Harry's head. They made eye contact then, and Draco smiled, as he began massaging the shampoo into Harry's wet curls.
‘No,’ Harry said. Draco looked up at him then, with a carefully neutral expression. ‘It doesn’t work that way … I don’t need, like, maximum two best friends.’ He wanted to say more, but didn’t know how to.
Harry stepped past Draco to toe off his shoes onto the mat. He shrugged off his heavy tweed coat and hung it up on one Draco's wall hooks.
Draco visibly flinched. Oh, Merlin. He turned slowly, to see a bored-looking teenager eyeing him, making her bubble-gum snap in her mouth. Draco had to resist narrowing his eyes. The girl had a nametag on her t-shirt, so, evidently, she did work there and wasn't just some oddball.
He found Hermione in the common room, sitting in an armchair by the fire. “I did it,” he said breathlessly, not able to keep a goofy grin off his face. “I gave him the poem you helped me with.”
From some distant place, Harry could feel the shift of Malfoy’s body, as he’d raise the wine glass to his lips. And felt his body shift again as he lowered the glass to rest again on his lap.
It was going to be all Christmas stuff, wasn’t it? He flipped through a couple channels—and yeah, it was all “Charlie Brown” this, and “Rudolph” that. So, Harry dragged himself up in order to put in his Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind DVD. This'd kill a couple hours, he thought.
'My loneliness is killing me ... I must confess, I still believe …' Draco mouthed along, squeezing his eyes shut. 'When I'm not with you, I lose my mind … give me a si-i-i-ign.'
Draco raised his eyebrows. “Nothing. Honestly, it’s fine. It’s in the past.” He’d rather Potter just drop it, and, get out of the sodding bathroom, really. He’d had enough of being exposed.
Draco laughed again, rubbing his face. (To hide it?) ‘Yes, it would’ve been. Perhaps I have a flair for the dramatic, and enjoyed it far more than I should have.’ His gaze dropped to the floor, and he bit at his bottom lip again. ‘Truthfully I think I just needed to work up the courage for that big reveal in the end.’
Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter graduated from Hogwarts, moved in together, and Draco regularly saw a Mind Healer for his trauma and self-esteem issues.
Ginny tossed Draco's notes down on his kitchen table, and walked out. He heard the Floo a moment later.
He looked at her then, taken aback. She just looked back at him in quiet non-judgment. Merlin, had he married an angel? He swallowed. Astoria was implying he may be asexual.
Wordlessly, Draco carried his pile of clothing over to the bathroom, locking the door behind him. Only then did he really hug the hoodie, burying his nose in the hood part.
There it was, the dreaded question. A question he’d been asked hundreds of times by now. He flashed her his best polite smile, suppressing a grimace. “Not sure. We haven’t figured that out yet.” He hoped she’d just drop it.
Okay, he was feeling a little down. Upset. It could have something to do with the alcohol; it’s a depressant after all.
‘And my parents got their memories back,’ Hermione added, rolling her eyes in a teasing way as she sat beside her boyfriend.
what matters. We don’t abuse each other. We fought in the past, yes, but we’re not going to fight anymore, not like that.’
“I thought not.” Malfoy took both of Harry’s hands in his. “Gra—Hermione’s going to be fine, I promise you.” He squeezed Harry’s hands, just once.
Harry and Malfoy looked at each other. Malfoy bit his lip, and through that whole exchange hadn’t even made an attempt to get off of Harry.
He Floo-called Draco’s flat, and his heartrate sped up. In a good way. Not in a frightened way … more of a … hopeful way. Excited way.
‘Fuck, yes.’ Malfoy traced the outline of Harry’s locket scar with his finger. ‘But I’ll need my things.’
Potter exhaled hard, like it pained him. “Or, I would’ve been killed. And what good would that’ve been?”
physically dangerous." Minerva cleared her throat. "But I would advise against picking up any mysterious items, without first knowing what they may do, in the future.” She looked at him pointedly, and interlaced her fingers on the desk. “It is a rare magical pearl from Hyderabad,” she added, frowning down at the sphere wrapped in cloth sat on her desk. “A city in South India.”
“Never mind, let me … just—” She pushed him off of her and scrambled to her feet, biting her lip and grinning at him, as she made quick work out of unzipping herself on the side of her dress, and stepping out of the garment.
A pit dropped in Harry’s stomach. Just … just the last time had been hard enough. He didn’t want to—
“I wrote them. I didn’t send them. The ghost,” he nodded to the space Ellie had just disappeared from, “she delivered them to you.”
Maybe Draco had realised he’d made a mistake. That they could never get along, they could never make a friendship work. They were too different.
“Very,” Harry said emphatically, smiling at Draco—either oblivious or wilfully ignoring Pansy’s smug attitude.
‘I mean it,’ she continued. ‘I thought that … I thought it was the right thing to do, to save everyone else. But I was wrong.’
Pansy took his hand and squeezed it, staring at their entwined fingers. She looked up suddenly, with a startlingly warm expression. ‘How long have you felt this way about him?’
Sighing, Draco hurried along to catch up, and reached for Harry’s hand. Harry tossed him a glance, still smiling.
Then he noticed the little lacquered signs on each display, announcing their reasonable prices under a familiar store logo. Marks and Spencer, Harry was inside Marks and Spencer.
‘Oh, ah, well, I guess tomorrow.’ He’d done everything he’d originally planned, and more. Plus, he’d already bothered Potter enough.
. ‘They were saying someone slipped you a love potion, and you didn’t act any differently? Because, you already … love me?’
“So,” Hermione said, extending a hand to lay it on his arm. “You don’t usually drop in. Is something the matter?”
Draco responded with a step closer, and an open-mouthed kiss. His grip tightened on Harry's cock, and then it moved—slowly at first.
“I don’t know. Maybe.” But Harry Potter had always hated him. Why had he fooled himself into thinking they may be becoming friends? No … the truth had revealed itself, again. Harry Potter was never meant to be friends with Draco Malfoy.
“Um …” Harry said, after a bit. “Don’t you think it’s strange that we’re … I don’t know, getting along?”
They seemed to have fallen into a silence again. And still, Harry wanted to say more, wanted to give Draco something more.
Taking a deep breath, Draco selected a video. Blue shorts. They were quite small. Draco swallowed, and watched.
Draco tried to wrestle out of Harry's death grip, but he was quite strong. Island life hadn't softened him, not in the least.
He spun round and entered into the crowd again, searching for the two blokes. He passed all the sweaty, gyrating bodies, knocking around the drinks some more, and finally pushed out into the bar area. Dimitri and Ruben were ordering more drinks, leaning against the bar and happily chatting.
‘And everything I was going through, all those conflicting emotions—some of which I tried desperately to bury—combined into something very ugly … and that was Fifth year for me. Ugly anger. Resentment. Jealousy.’ He gathered pebbles into his palm and shifted them around. ‘And the summer after Fifth year, I found myself on a crash course towards … well. There seemed to be no getting out of it. I'm sorry, you probably don’t want to hear about—’
‘Luna.’ He wrapped her up in a warm hug. He’d missed her. She looked the same as ever—long blond hair in a messy plait, fiddlehead earrings, and a summery purple cotton dress.
He could only see him in profile—lit by blue light, with big headphones on his ears. He was looking down at his moving hands, pressing buttons, turning dials and things, as his head shook slowly in time to the beat.
Draco seemed to be stunned into silence. He looked out in the distance, wide-eyed. After a moment, he mumbled, “We would’ve been in the same dorm room.”
Harry pulled back and just looked at her. The pretty freckles on her face, her kind eyes. He planted a smacking kiss on her cheek.
He felt good. He hadn’t wanked like that in a long while. Hadn’t had much of a sex drive at all, really.
Draco pulled back to get a look at him, rubbing the pads of his thumbs over Harry’s wet cheeks. ‘Do you like it?’
Thank you so much for reading ❤️ feedback is welcome (especially since no one reads this over besides me)
'Excellent,' said Angelpreet. 'Now let's add our first friend. See the search bar at the top of the webpage? Start typing a name of someone you know, and options should begin to pop up. Now make sure you know it's the right person—as many people could share the same name. The profile photo is a clue, as well as their location.'
He smiled, and walked with it out to his desk in the living room. Robespierre was out there, eyeing him warily.
It was like being a zoo animal. For the first time in his life, he was sympathetic toward zoo animals. He was one of them now. He was a zebra longing for the Serengeti, and Potter was a child in a baseball cap munching on peanuts staring at him without blinking. It was
When he was finished, he wrapped a thick, fluffy white towel around his waist and felt exceptionally relaxed.
‘Nice,’ Harry commented, letting his eye wander over them all. Shrugging, he chose a spiky green-leaved one, marked “faucaria felina.”
Harry looked back down at the diary in his lap, and decided to tuck away those thoughts for later, though he felt a pit in his stomach. Something like guilt. He kept reading.
Draco opened his eyes—Harry seemed to be staring up at the slow-moving clouds. Draco buried his head more comfortably in his arms, and kept observing him. He hoped he was truly all right.
Malfoy nodded. ‘Thank you, for telling me. I hadn’t heard from my mother in days, I was beginning to worry. This is … a relief.’
Draco pulled back. ‘Yes,’ he said breathlessly. His eyes—looking deep into Harry’s—they looked like … like raw affection.
Harry turned, in time, to see Professor Vector grabbing for a pile of letters left at Malfoy’s plate. Now, Harry had Seeker reflexes too, so he snatched the letters up, a split second before she could.
Exhaling heavily, he bit back a sharp retort, because … he didn't really want be there, did he? 'Fine.'
Harry just ... well, he was hoping that Draco was different now. That he wasn't that same boy he'd been at Hogwarts anymore. Was it intuition? Or a near-pathological (and naive) desire to believe the best in people? Just because they were chatting amicably now?
He settled back into his chair beside Astoria, and looked at the letter in his hand. It was addressed to him, in … Harry Potter’s handwriting. He smiled, and felt his heartrate pick up speed. Just a bit.
Harry nodded at him, so Draco tossed him one more smile before he wandered off, and greeted guest after guest, thanking them for coming.
‘Well, good enough, I suppose,’ he muttered waving his hand at his cleaning job, surveying the room again.
Snatching a bar of soap from the rack, he scrubbed hard against his skin, fingernails and soap together. The hot steam and the smell of soap overpowered his senses. He made the mistake of looking down, seeing ribbons of red circling the drain. Blood. Malfoy’s blood. His head buzzed with white noise.
He tried not to cry. There’d be time for that—later. When Molly didn’t have to see it. He didn’t want to make her cry.
Or … or maybe Draco had figured out Harry’s attraction to him, and it probably made him uncomfortable because he fancied someone in Ravenclaw (probably Terry Boot) and it was just awkward having a new friend fawning over you and trying to hold your hand when you don't like them that way.
And one of the issues here was that Harry would prefer to get Draco alone so they could speak privately, but Draco was always talking to somebody whenever Harry could even spot him. They didn’t have any classes together that day … so that meant just meals and the halls.
Harry hadn’t gone down with his classmates—he wasn’t hungry—just the thought of food would turn his stomach, if he were to think of it.
“Do you want to borrow a hoodie again?” Harry asked, like it were no big deal. “The one from last night might smell like campfire, Firewhisky, and who knows what.”
Draco slumped down on the bed, onto his back, and threw an arm over his eyes. Everything he’d said had been
Draco nodded, and stepped into the room to rummage around in his dresser. Harry watched, feeling uncertain, himself.
They’d had all those nice letter chats, but that didn’t mean they could carry it over well into real life, did it? And certainly it wouldn’t be easy when Harry felt like … this. (Miserable, uncomfortable, already wanting to leave.)
“Well that’s bollocks.” Malfoy’s face snapped up to stare at him. “I’ve seen you with the students,” Harry explained. “You’re so patient with them, so calm—”
They did have leftover onion and garlic that hadn't gone into the vindaloo. Plus 5 eggs left, since the naan had only required one. And milk. Omelettes?
It’d be better than the alternative: continuing to live a life he’d already ruined. He had no future prospects, really. Who would ever hire a former Death Eater? Who would ever
Harry nodded, though Malfoy couldn’t see him. Well, Malfoy had achieved it. His flat was about as different from the Manor as Harry could imagine. He cleared his throat. ‘So what’s on the agenda for the day?’ Harry asked, to keep himself from thinking about the table again.
‘Well, that’s what I think. And I’d swear on my life that your family would be protected,’ he said, hoping that he truly could follow through with that promise.
'No,' Harry cut in. 'Keep it on.' The nightshirt was fucking sexy on him, and there was something about being fully naked while Draco was fully-clothed …
Draco arranged his three glasses between his knees, and twisted around to hold Harry closer, closer to himself.
Onwards then, he approached Potter. Holding two cups. He probably looked pathetically desperate—no. It was just a cup of Firewhisky. Perfectly normal.
Harry couldn’t concentrate on anything else … he couldn’t garden, he couldn’t tidy up around the house, he couldn’t even watch a show on the telly without his thoughts straying to Draco bloody Malfoy.
Pansy, from beside Draco, said, ‘Good morning, Harry.’ She wore a knowing smirk on her green-lipsticked mouth.
A glass or two later, Draco booted up his home computer. (Yes, he’d gone through the immense hassle of purchasing one from the Muggles, and setting up an internet connection.)
Then Harry forced himself to focus on that Potions essay, and nothing else. He was not thinking about Malfoy kissing Hermione rather than him, nor Malfoy bloody plaiting a Hufflepuff’s
‘Seriously? Salazar, Draco. I can’t believe you’re still hung up on Harry Potter after all these years.’ She groaned, throwing her head back. ‘Get over it, he’s gone. He’s on a fucking island in the Mediterranean Sea or whatever. For Circe’s sake.’
on Dumbledore before he had died. Dumbledore had planned it all ... he'd helped Harry immeasurably, even in death.
Potter extended his hand down towards the water’s surface. He let his fingertips just graze the water, and several fish took notice. Draco watched, with bated breath. One of the big ones, a hand-sized one, swam up to nibble on the finger. Potter giggled, and retracted his hand quickly. That sound did something to Draco’s chest.
Potter stared at Draco, seemingly at a loss. He licked his lips, then said, “So, you’re saying you prefer to be alone, then.”
And, he thought of Malfoy eyeing his hair with a lifted eyebrow, saying, “Nice hair, Potter.” And how Harry would mutter a dry, “Thanks,” and then spend the rest of the day thinking about it, trying to pat it down in the bathroom mirror.
Just as the action really got going, Potter fell asleep. His breath slowed down and softened, and his body leaned closer and closer towards Draco. Draco spotted the inching out of the corner of his eye, warily. His heartrate sped up. Before long, Potter was leaning right on him. His head rolled, and settled on Draco’s shoulder. He could feel Potter’s soft curls against his jaw. Potter let out a tiny satisfied sound, it sounded nice. Potter shifted, and his leg ended up pressed snugly against Draco’s.
Malfoy slowly finished slinging his bag over his shoulder, and looked Harry straight in the eye. “Breaking up with me already?”
'What—' Harry began, and then he felt it. The tip of Draco's penis trailed a line across Harry's abdomen. Harry pushed the blanket down Draco's shoulders so he could watch Draco's soft cock travel across Harry's skin. 'Fuck, Draco, why is that so hot?'
Hermione smiled. ‘You always have our support, Harry. Now … when will you get to see each other again?’
Harry silently agreed, he wanted everything to go back to normal. Wanted to be the good guy, with Malfoy as the bad guy he had to keep his eye on. The way it’d been for over 5 years. The past 24 hours had been too confusing. Harry was supposed to be good, not a near-murderer. And Draco Malfoy was supposed to be bad. Not a crying, vulnerable boy whose only confidant was a ghost.
They were through the door … and then, near the bed. Harry pushed Malfoy onto it, and then worked on undoing his own flies. Malfoy leant up on his elbows to watch.
Harry stopped listening to Slughorn and eyed Parkinson warily, as she stood and shot him a glare. If he’s switching with her, then—
Harry was going to get Ron and Hermione and leave the hall. It had been the three of them for so long. They had endured so much together.
simple. Merlin, you two are a pair. Love poems sent by a ghost …" She shook her head. “Just talk to each other! You’re eighteen!”
Malfoy was there too, bent over a table, with nose in a book. Harry would recognise that near-white hair anywhere. It was like a beacon.
‘Did you know that the Muggle Queen owns the swans in the UK?’ Harry mused. He’d read that somewhere. Or maybe Hermione had told him.
had a first kiss. So, instead of suggesting they wank each other off, he said, ‘So you’ll be my boyfriend, then?’
The wind tousled Malfoy’s hair. He looked so serious. And stoic. He tossed the stones into the lake, causing plop-sounds and ripples to appear in the lake’s surface. Harry watched the ripples get wider and wider until they disappeared altogether.
Potter shifted and his hair brushed up against the back of Draco’s hand. Draco involuntarily closed his eyes and clenched his hands into fists—for a wild moment he imagined raking his fingers through those curls.
Ginny had popped over to Grimmauld Place, a few weeks after the war. She’d been kind, but had asked up-front if she should wait for him, asked if he saw a future there. He’d told her the truth—that he wasn’t sure, that he needed time, but she didn’t have to wait for him or anything. Honestly, he didn't know if they'd ever get back together. Harry did love her, he thought, in some capacity, but … but he wasn’t sure about them. Wasn’t sure they were right for, like, forever—forever was an awfully long time after all, and he was only eighteen. (And traumatised.)
‘What are you doing here?’ Potter seemed shocked himself—disbelieving, really—along with suspicious and wary. (Naturally.) He frowned and gave Draco a once over.
Harry looked at Draco’s face in awe. This was so much better than he’d dared to hope. ‘Can I kiss you now?’
‘Well … alright.’ Draco rubbed at his forehead, and looked around. ‘There isn’t much room in here, maybe if I move the bed a little closer to the wall …'
He plopped down onto the end of the bed, his bare legs outstretched and not touching the floor. This was... nice.
Hermione shot him a questioning glance, as if the answer were so obvious, he needn’t have asked. “So that we discover the truth, Harry. So that we—and perhaps she—get closure on this.”
He didn’t think that was fair. He didn’t derive any happiness out of hunting Voldemort. It just felt like … duty. Harry got up, turned his back on Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore’s tomb, and the lot of them. He set off to walk around the lake. To clear his head.
Merlin, was this strange. Harry wanted to talk to Draco, wanted to ask him everything. But between bites of delicious food was probably not the time. The silence started to feel oppressive as they ate—maybe Harry could ask something neutral, to start.
‘Harry,’ she said fondly, as she swivelled around in her desk chair to face him, wearing a soft smile on her friendly face. She still dressed all in purple, Harry noted. Today it was an eggplant-purple pantsuit.
Draco fished around his pile of clothes, and found his pants, pulling them on. And then he joined Potter, lying back beside him.
‘Well. Then it didn’t. Kill me, that is. And … er, Seventh year was not …’ He exhaled. ‘Saying “not good” is a bit of an understatement. But I accepted something about myself that year though, finally.’ Draco winced again. He wasn’t sure this was coming out right. ‘How I … feel about you.’
He squinted an eye open, and he blearily adjusted to the darkness. It almost seemed like Draco Malfoy was sitting on the edge of his bed. But Harry was dreaming, most likely. He grumbled and turned over.
Astoria strode over to him, snatching the card out of his hands, and raked her eyes over the text. Looking more and more confused. “Is he … mocking us?”
Robespierre, Draco’s owl, rapped at their bedroom window. Yawning, Draco had to unwrap himself from Astoria (she liked to be held as she fell asleep), and gingerly climbed out of bed. Astoria lay undisturbed—she was proving to be a heavy sleeper.
He heard Pansy and Blaise giggling about something, but he tuned that out, like he tuned out just about everything. Except studying. Except Potter’s head (sometimes).
They clambered up out of their seats, and Draco swayed a bit on his feet before he could get his bearings. But he was good. He was brilliant, actually. He was with Harry Potter in Ibiza—was anything better?
3. This fic uses a work skin to make the journal entries separate colours, so if you use a skin that overrides mine, you might get confused as to who’s writing
Harry shook his head. No, Harry could not picture Draco Malfoy in Las Vegas. Amongst slot machines and flashing lights.
of Draco Malfoy. This was stupid. He was getting tired of it—tired of being off-kilter. Hermione’s words
Draco tilted it towards his breakfast. Sure, it was missing a couple bites, but it was still beautiful. Draco paused, and adjusted his mug to the side, then moved the cutlery to the left a bit.
‘Hey, what spices do you have, anyway? I should’ve looked before we left,’ Harry asked as his eyes scanned the bottles for cumin seeds. He practically felt Draco sigh.
Harry bumped his shoulder against hers. “Hey, if anyone’s good at letting someone down easy, I’m sure it’s Luna. She’ll be your friend no matter what. I truly believe that. So, I don’t think there’s anything to lose, really.”
‘Mm, I think I know the reason for those. For your mum,’ Harry said, letting his fingers idly stroke Draco’s fingers. Evidently he was feeling a bit looser and relaxed with Draco—maybe more daring.
Harry laughed wetly against Draco’s shoulder. “Sorry,” he blubbered, and then pushed off. Draco smiled crookedly at him. Harry bit at his lip.
She showed him several options from behind the desk. It didn’t really matter which one … he arbitrarily picked one with two lovebirds kissing, with a tiny red heart above their beaks. Since it was a wedding gift, after all.
He looked around in awe—it looked a bit Gryffindor-ish, in maroon and gold furnishings. But it was small, and like Harry said: cosy. And it smelled pleasant—like lavender. There was a large television set up on the wall, and a big, plush maroon sofa with sparkling gold pillows across from it, along with a coffee table adorned with bowls of popcorn, candy, and other various snacks. And that was it, so, definitely small.
,” she answered, through clenched teeth, “Why would he burn letters, hmm? If not to conceal Death Eater correspondence? There may be plans afoot,
Afterwards, they paid their bills at the desk with Brenda. Draco was a bit quiet again, though not to nearly the same degree as their last therapy session.
Draco exhaled slowly. ‘No you aren’t. Are we really going to have to talk with a toilet stall door between us?’
The snake was done now—dark green with a yellow collar and friendly-looking. Next the tattoo artist began drawing narcissus flowers around the snake.
They moved so slowly, seemingly to savour it. Terry moaned against Malfoy’s mouth. He fucking moaned.
Potter grabbed onto both of Draco’s biceps. “Who hurt you?” Potter demanded softly, searching Draco’s eyes. Merlin’s beard did he look earnest.
'Do you like tomatoes?' Harry asked, turning the wheel by crossing one hand over the other—and repeating the movement.
Harry smiled. ‘Yeah, that’s pretty much it, I think. He was a good friend. A good anonymous friend. Then … he wasn’t anonymous anymore … and we figured out how to keep it going.’
And Malfoy had been great to chat with in the journal ... he was witty, intelligent, insightful. Kind of dry and biting and sarcastic at times, but Harry kind of liked that. And Malfoy helped him through an anxiety attack. He’d invited him into his home. Yeah, they were proper friends.
Fondly, Harry looked down at the bright orange dragon with jagged teeth and huge bat-like wings. “This is beautiful, Rose.”
Licking her lip, Morgan backed out, and smacked at the door frame with her palm. She looked as if she was considering saying something, but Draco did not have the energy to prod her, so he turned to his computer instead.
This was the boy with taped-up glasses and over-sized hand-me-down clothes to Madam Malkin's, the boy who then refused to shake his hand, refused his friendship, on the train. This is the one who fainted from Dementors, the one who nearly killed Draco in a bathroom. And who saved his life on the back of a broom in a burning room.
Harry felt his face grow hot. 'Er … do you really want to know?' He looked at Hermione and Ron's faces.
There he was—just washing his hands. Harry’s eyes met Draco’s in the mirror, and he smiled. Draco came up behind him, wrapping his arms around Harry's waist, and pressing his cheek to Harry’s shoulder blade.
Harry waved his wand above Draco's exposed skin, like he was conjuring an invisible sticky gel-like substance in the air. He then lowered his wand, and Draco felt it fall on him—clingy, but cooling.
But the lip-smacking was a bit distracting when a book is asking you to take inventory of your relationships. It served to highlight what he didn’t have … someone to lip-smack with. Not that he needed that or anything, at this stage in life. But … it might’ve been nice.
Draco sat up, and crossed his legs. He worried his bottom lip, and looked down at Potter lying beside him—arms folded back behind his head, a wet curl plastered to his forehead, and a contented smile, closed eyes. ‘I need to come clean.’ He exhaled slow. ‘I feel like a complete creep, I don’t know what I was thinking—’
They glanced at each other at the same time. Potter’s eyes shined bright and he wore a small smile on his face, evidently pleased with that answer. Draco looked away quickly.
‘Different circumstances, of course. I struggled with my own identity because I was told I was a Wizard one minute, and the sodding “Boy Who Lived” the next. And every single year at school had me risking my life, fighting a war,
Draco laughed; the question had caught him by surprise. His eyes searched the stars. ‘I find it hard to believe there wouldn’t be. Statistically, anyway … with the vast size of the universe.’
to Neville, to let him know to release Draco from the spell … once Harry had left. And to keep Draco from coming after him.
Inhaling slowly, Draco settled into a soft smile in return. 'Well we've thoroughly addressed it now, I think. I'm fine, and I'm not sorry it happened. You've apologised, and I've forgiven.'
Dave laughed. 'Sure, honey.' Then he turned back to Draco, grinning, evidently not ready to give up. His teeth were very white. 'What else?'
Draco dropped it—letting Harry do as he felt necessary—and found himself next to a jewellery display full of lovely gold and gemstone pieces. Draco chose a bracelet for Pansy with multiple strands, some containing golden cube-shaped beads, others jasper spherical beads. He grabbed an herbal liqueur for Morgan, and a few more bottles of salt, then met Harry by the register.
Harry slipped out of bed, and toed on his brown slippers. He thought of fishing out his Invisibility Cloak for a moment, before remembering that he was 18, and was actually allowed to go where he liked now. Harry smiled wistfully for a moment—thinking of all the late-night adventures with Hermione and Ron, all huddled under the Cloak, going out in secret, trying to save the world.
Harry leaned in to kiss Draco’s mouth, as his hand moved up Draco’s inner thigh. Slowly. Too slowly. It passed over the fabric of his boxers, before shifting course and lightly grazing over the fabric over Draco’s bollocks. Draco sucked in a breath.
Malfoy shot him another look. ‘You keep asking if I’m fine. I suppose if you won’t believe me, I’ll have to show you. Then perhaps you will finally leave me alone,’ he said, heavily enunciating the words
Malfoy mirrored the tentative smile. “Well … I survived it thanks to you,” Malfoy said quietly. He exhaled slow. “So, we’ve done the ‘I’m sorry’, and now I should thank you.” He searched Harry’s eyes. “You saved my life.”
Thank you so much for reading ! ❤️ Feedback, concrit, or just straight-up crit if you want, is welcome 😊
The man caught it, in shaky fingers. Looking from the note, then back up to Draco with a furrowed brow, he uttered, “What?”
The girl’s friends came to comfort her, hug her, whisper comforting words, as Draco looked on—baffled. With a terrible, terrible ache in his chest, and wetness in his eyes.
She grumbled, but sauntered off in the direction of the drink table. Or maybe Draco should’ve offered to take her—
Draco turned to look at the unoccupied bed, before slowly nodding. ‘Okay. I suppose I can sleep there.’
'Sure, but I didn't know the Catalan word for "youth" at the time. It's "joventut", by the way. I just saw the rainbow flag and went in.'
‘Accio lube,’ Harry called, holding his hand out. A little container flew from Harry’s bedroom into his hand.
Draco smiled, and leaned in. He brushed his lips against Harry’s. So softly. There was a faint taste of bubble-gum, but more than that was the natural taste of Draco’s mouth, the breath-taking feel of soft lips against Harry’s own, and Draco’s warm breath puffing out onto Harry’s face.
She exhaled hard, shooting him a cross look. “Took you long enough. Hermione’s gone into early labour. She’s at St Mungo’s.”
Harry blinked at the two bottles, one had a blue label and one a red. He definitely did not know what was being asked.
Then, Draco was grabbing Harry’s hips to help him move for a beat, before changing his mind and grabbing at his arse.
‘Look at the Owl Post checkpoints,’ Neville said, pointing at the ink marks on the brown paper with his stubby fingers. Harry peered closer to see where Neville was indicating. ‘It’s come from London; then Paris before that; then Athens, Cairo, Cape Town, and, finally: Harare, Zimbabwe.’ Neville’s eyes widened as he turned to Harry. ‘Who do you know in Zimbabwe, Harry?’
past, Draco supposed. He’d had years to come to terms with it. Draco was going to have to take some time to process it though.
The water felt lovely, lapping at his ankles and cooling his skin off from lying in the sun for so long.
Shivering, his mind tried to inform him—nudging at him—saying that he was cold. Blinking slowly, he looked down to realise he was still dressed in his school uniform, soaked through with water and blood.
She frowned slightly. “Afraid not, Harry. One of the Aurors touched it by accident for only a moment, and there was a very lengthy rendition of something I would rather not repeat.”
Er … that was cute. Harry smiled, a little wistfully. “Well, I suppose you’re free to get a cat now, now that you aren’t living with your parents.”
‘Do we have to break up?’ Harry asked into Draco’s chest, and his whole upper body clenched inwards at the thought. They needed to talk about this, though, even though it was painful. This was important.
Draco's eyes seemed quite dilated, practically all black, as they wandered down Harry's neck, his chest, his stomach. 'No, I meant for everything off.'
Ah … Harry could sigh—happy sigh. It was like having held his breath for too long, and now he could release it—could release all the tension he held. It was like coming back to something he could’ve lost. But he didn’t want to lose it … he wanted it. Wanted. It.
Once dressed in clean pyjamas, they went out into the living room together. Their slightly bent Christmas tree sparkled with the lights they'd enchanted onto it, illuminating the many second-hand ornaments they'd picked out together. (Harry's favourite was the knock-off Oscar-the-Grouch figurine holding a banner that read "one man's trash is another man's treasure".) He reached out and squeezed Draco's hand.
But, despite all this—despite everything—Harry believed it was good that he’d come back, even if it was very hard. He didn’t regret his decision or anything. (And he’d known it was going to be hard, especially at first.)
, why he couldn’t enjoy himself like his friends did. But he remembered what his Mind Healer said … that nothing was inherently wrong with him. That he’d gone through terrible things, even before he knew about Voldemort … all the years of neglect and emotional abuse that he’d never had time to process. Fuck … it was boring being so damaged.
He turned, and found Harry behind him, lowering his camera slowly, wearing a soft smile on his face. 'Harry—'
Dave laughed. 'A jock?’ He held a hand over his heart. ‘Well I'd never guess. What was it, then, soccer? Or what's that other game you Englishmen play …' Dave scrunched his face up, looking up. 'Cricket?'
'Evan belongs to no one but himself—what era are you living in?’ Draco scoffed. ‘Besides, I think he is quite well-equipped to choose his own partners, and—
Draco resisted the instinct to roll his eyes, to downplay it or make a joke about it to save face, to pretend it’d all been for a laugh, acting in all the ways he normally would. Cowardly ways.
Harry felt his friends' eyes on him as he approached the Hufflepuff table. Draco was there, with his head supported by a fist, while the other hand pushed scrambled eggs around his plate. Harry slipped in across from him, in between Charlotte and Pansy’s girlfriend Becca.
In a flash Malfoy was in front of him again, taking Harry’s face in his hands—leaning in to kiss him.
‘I like your music mixes too,’ he said. ‘And … I wanted to see for myself if you were all right. That’s all, I promise.’ He raised his hands to signal he came in peace. It was all true. He just left out the inconvenient, long-standing, unrequited crush part, which was likely for the best.
Apologising again, Draco thought, as he leant back in his desk chair to get a proper look at Harry. He was wearing another suit—this one charcoal grey with a black button-down. London-businessman. Draco frowned. And Harry's hair was a bit flat, his skin peaky, and dark under his eyes. He might not've slept either.
Harry blinked. ‘Oh. You haven’t heard of them?’ Draco’s mouth pinched. ‘Muggles use them to communicate. You can call each other, sort of like a Floo-call, or you can text—which … hmm, I suppose is like what we do with our journals. Except mobiles are a little more portable, and they don’t run out pages.’
Everyone was expecting things of him—great things. They always had. Harry’d had enormous expectations put on him—since birth really, since the prophecy.
Malfoy’s answer simultaneously sparked joy, terror, and raw determination in Harry. He hoped to all the gods that he could pull it off.
'Nah, mate, I'll just see you next week … Mmhmm, yeah, bye.' Harry lowered the thing and clicked something again before shoving it into his pocket. 'Sorry,' he said again, 'Just a mate.'
Ron exhaled hard out his mouth. “Well, we were meant to be having fun tonight, weren’t we? Let’s get to drinking and we can tell you about how Victoire royally embarrassed herself at the dinner table yesterday.”
‘Silence!’ McGonagall called. ‘The Slytherin belongings are going to be transferred to Hufflepuff House today. And after everything is cleared out, the Slytherin dorms are closed. Hufflepuff will be rearranged so that each dorm room fits two Slytherin students with two Hufflepuff students. I don’t want to hear any complaints until you’ve slept at least one night with these new arrangements. That is all.’
Fuck—he slumped back against the counter and stared at the pile of letters strewn about the table. He hadn’t mean for it all to blow up that way—he'd thought they could have a proper conversation. Though, he realised they hadn’t been very good at those for a long time.
Harry scrambled to sit up. It was as if a meadow of flowers had blossomed in his chest—as incredibly cheesy as that probably sounded. He just felt … warm, at the same time as his heartrate sped up rapidly with uncertainty, all along with a healthy dose of feeling a possible impending doom approaching—knowing that Draco might at any moment break his heart, rather than explain it’d all been a big misunderstanding.
Potter smiled at Draco, like the two of them were sharing a secret, and they disappeared with a pop.
A black squirrel standing upside down on a tree trunk made eye contact with him. Draco paused, and they contemplated each other for a moment, before the squirrel turned, and scurried up the tree.
And evidently, they’d heard him, because the two of them broke apart like they’d been caught out (which, they had) and looked back. Weasley seemed absolutely horrified to’ve been caught by Draco and Harry—his face turned a very unflattering shade of scarlet, a colour that clashed with his bright orange hair. Blaise, on the other hand, looked very suave and pleased with himself, smiling over at Draco.
Professor McGonagall sat across from him at Dumbledore’s old desk, looking stern and stoic, with palms pressed together and held against her chin. 'How are you?'
Harry lowered himself onto the head of Draco’s cock. Fuck, it was bigger than fingers, but he wanted it—inside him … so fucking badly. The head breached through Harry’s arsehole, and Harry felt like he might be being torn open. In a painful but absolutely brilliant way.
“Um …" Harry started, turning back to Malfoy who looked a bit more tense than he had a moment ago. “Sorry, we have to …"
Draco leant his head back, to re-wet his hair. Thinking. The Milky Way sparkled up there. He blinked at it, then righted himself to add, ‘If the soul can be separated from the body and live on with magic intact, does this mean that magic is part of the soul? And what is a soul, really?’
Harry snorted out a breath, and returned his focus on the television. 'Is there any sort of film you wouldn't like?'
'Thank you for being a friend,' Harry said into Draco's shoulder. 'Next time I wouldn't cry on you, I promise.'
Potter just waited patiently clinging to Draco’s sleeve and saying nothing, while Draco struggled with temporary blindness to guide them away from the bonfire.
His heartrate picked up—that traitor (his heart, that is). It was only a card from Harry Potter. He swallowed, and thumbed at the paper edge absently.
Hermione and Harry made eye contact, she smiled at him—a smile that said she’d kept his secret. He tried to smile his appreciation back.
But Harry watched Malfoy’s eyes widen, and the laughter slip from his expression. The smile he’d shared with his friends faded into a slack-mouthed look of awe, the rippling effect of his bottom lip quivering more and more as the seconds passed before he sucked it in his mouth to still it. Harry watched his blinking speed up its pace. A hand brought to cover his mouth, as his eyes—tearing up—stared outwards, on one slowly moving point.
Draco tried to manoeuvre his way closer to the stage, but just the sheer number of people … He only managed to get a couple dozen heads back from the stage before everything was just too tightly-packed for him.
Draco chanced a glance at Potter through strands of hair. The man was just looking straight up at the clouds. Potter
Harry nodded at the other guests as he walked past, shooting them little waves. Being awkward. Most of them didn't even look up at him.
'Hello Harry Potter,' said Morgan, with candy-pink curls bouncing as she extended a hand. 'I'm Morgan Beauregard, Draco's assistant.'
Those words sent a cold shiver up Harry’s spine—and startled him in place. So much for that, then. Giving up on stretching his legs, Harry mumbled some non-words at the boys, and rushed back to his compartment. Back to make-out-central, then, he thought, swallowing hard.
they be sex-less ones? Considering she’d had the misfortune of falling in love with a … a man who did not prefer women.
‘I could’ve easily died, and I would’ve died … with you thinking that I always hated you. Which … isn’t true.’
“—it’s fun. You can get up close to the islands. But you need to watch for rocks under the water's surface. We even saw an eagle’s nest!”
she did. But …" He ran a hand through his hair, and promptly realised he’d probably messed it up, and started to pat at it, while Malfoy looked on with a small smile. “But I was in the mood for Italian, since we never seem to have it at Hogwarts. And, everyone likes Italian, right? Can’t go wrong. So, well, Ron's co-worker said this restaurant had been her favourite ...”
Draco must've felt Harry filling out, because he gasped into Harry's mouth and pulled back, wide-eyed. 'Can we …' he started.
Grateful for the distraction, he read until his eyelids got too heavy. Then he closed his book, turned off the lamp, and slipped easily into a peaceful sleep.
Draco’s heartrate sped up, if that was even possible. “Is that so?” he managed. “And what is... the truth?” Merlin, the Firewhisky had loosened his tongue.
He scrubbed at his face with his hands, and then looked up at her. “Alright, just promise me you won’t do anything else to interfere with me and... and Potter. No more
He exhaled a breath. She was always getting him to think. And reflect. ‘Well … honestly, I think allowing myself to safely experience the things I wanted to avoid was helpful. I’m glad I went back to school. I needed to … face it.’
‘You can probably come back now,’ Harry called out, as he put a pan over the range and set it to low heat. Harry added half a cup of oil and the chopped onions.
No. Malfoy’s just … paler than the others. His paleness draws Harry’s eye. “It’s not like that. I don’t think he’s up to something anymore.”
The path wound around massive trees, and started to tilt downhill. Roots from the trees were raised above the ground, so Draco had to mind where he stepped, careful not to trip.
Harry suppressed a shiver at feeling Draco’s breath on his ear. Lord, was he just sensitive now that he was single? Or had it really been so long since he’d had sex with Ginny that even sodding Draco Malfoy did funny things to him? He shouldn't be thinking like this. It was only a whisper, a bit of breath. “Comforting,” he said dryly. But, he poured himself a healthy amount of the maroon anyhow.
Though, come to think of it, Potter had hated him even before all of his poor choices. Potter hated him when they’d first met, when they were eleven years old, and all Draco had done was offer to be his friend. It doesn’t get much clearer than that. Harry Potter was never going to like Draco Malfoy.
When they all clambered into Hufflepuff, Harry found that it was not as garish yellow as he thought it would be. It was actually pretty comfortable looking. Warm light from the fireplace and several candles reflected off the shiny hard-wood floors. The combination of cushions and couches, and the surplus of hanging plants, gave it all a homey, cosy feel. And it smelled of cinnamon. It reminded Harry of the Burrow, just with much more open space.
Draco's automatic answer was a nod. Then he seemed to consider it. 'I've never slept with someone before.' A blotchy blush rose to his cheeks.
Hermione took the quill out of her mouth, and pushed her reading glasses to the top of her head—smiling at them as she rose slowly to her feet, using the table for leverage. “Well, this is a surprise.” She waddled over to Harry and Rose and hugged them into her arms.
'Mmhmm, mmhmm. The only thing is, most people make that a social thing, you know. Like drinks with friends and a club.'
Draco began to guide them in a slow-moving circle. ‘Too true. I remember your atrocious dancing at the Yule Ball. Do I need to worry about my toes?’
Harry relaxed into it, letting his body fall, letting himself splay naked overtop an equally naked Malfoy. With cocks digging into stomachs and hips.
Draco had his own glass of wine in hand, that he swirled around leisurely, looking back at Harry with relaxation and contentment written all over his face.
Harry nodded, squinting out at the grounds. The grass sparkled with dew underneath blue skies, with only a couple fluffy white clouds in the distance. And Harry was quite aware he was being irritating, but it was a fun change of pace.
Harry'd found the tea bags, the mugs, all on his own. He'd added milk to Draco's, remembering how he liked it.
Draco pressed his eyes closed tight. Granted—sure—he could put in a little more effort. “How’d you find me?”
Harry helped pull Draco to his feet, and quickly dropped his hand once they were both vertical. He turned away a bit awkwardly, and Draco trailed after him as they approached the dancefloor. This was probably ill-advised.
‘Did she? I’m grateful.’ Draco realised belatedly where he’d been staring, so he looked for Ginny in the crowd, feigning neutrality. He found her dancing with her new husband: Graham, if Draco remembered correctly. Seemed a nice man. The quiet sort, unassuming. Draco made eye contact with her on accident, and she smiled warmly back over to him.
Harry blinked at that. 'I'm sure you would be.' He cleared his throat, and took out his mobile, staring at it. 'You really want to?'
Malfoy worried his bottom lip again, still looking at Harry’s mouth. “I still think you deserve better.”
Coincidently, or not, there was one last package for Harry. At least, any more mail would have to find its way to Grimmauld Place, or wait for him at Hogwarts until autumn.
Astoria fondled his bollocks, she kneaded the skin on his thigh, she reached up and pinched his nipple as she sucked gently—and it wasn’t working.
Also, if he didn’t go back to Hogwarts now, when all his friends were going back, he never would. And Hogwarts would become this place of fear and death, and did he want that? Well … "no" had been his answer, in the end. Hogwarts had been his first home. He sort of owed it to the school to face it, Harry figured, and make amends with it, in a sense. To make new happy memories.
Draco hadn’t replied in the morning either. Maybe he didn’t check the journal anymore, since by now they were getting used to speaking in person. Just … it already felt like a long time since they’d talked. Even though it hadn’t yet been 24 hours. Still …
'Vacation without a camera? Well … I brought one.' He pulled a little palm-sized device out of his pocket.
Draco scanned the whole ridiculous plastic thing until he found the funny symbol. He suppressed a sigh. This was not going to be easy.
Sighing again, in defeat this time, Pansy said, ‘Come over. I’ll let you watch your videos. But I’ve got a 3:00 meeting with Esmeralda, and a 4:30 tea with my mother. You’ll be on your own.’
‘Oh,’ Malfoy said breathily. Staring at him with those unreadable stormy grey eyes. He blinked once. ‘Yeah, alright.’
Next he stirred it all together slowly, mixing gradually. He went over to the sink to grab a bit of water to soften the dough, and when he turned back around, Draco had his back resting up against the kitchen island, facing Harry.
“Wanted. To see you.” The ghost smiled with love in her eyes. Draco felt tears forming in his own eyes,
Or reversed: Malfoy on his knees in front of Harry, Harry’s hand tugging on those loose white-blond strands. Malfoy’s finger in his arse. Malfoy’s foul, mean mouth around Harry’s cock.
“I’m really glad we got to properly talk on this trip. And I'm glad we got to know each other better. You really... you really opened up to me and I know that couldn’t have been easy. So, I’m grateful and I... I really like spending time with you. And I really... I really like you a lot.”
“What?” Draco hadn’t actually read it yet. He snatched the card back, to read it properly, this time.
A soft smile formed on Potter’s lips. “That sounds... good.” He laughed a little breathily at his repetition of the word.
He smiled sheepishly at the same time as Malfoy began to stretch like a cat, his foot pressing harder into Harry’s leg.
He threw on his Invisibility cloak and walked through the Hogwarts halls, for the very last time. It was deserted; everyone was crowded in the Great Hall, drinking and crying and mourning the dead, alongside the dead.
Harry used his own bowl to whisk together the egg mixture for the naan dough. He felt Draco staring at his arms. He looked up—and yeah, Draco was eyeing his work. ‘I feel like I’m on a cooking show right now.’
Harry exhaled slowly, looking at Neville with trepidation written all over his face. Then, nodding, he pushed his chair back and walked slowly out of the Great Hall and towards his room, hugging the book tight to his chest.
So Harry moved to match it, moving his tongue against Draco's, gripping onto Draco's now fully-hard cock, pumping it from base to tip, trying to match Draco's heavenly rhythm.
So, Harry leaned in—as Draco’s eyelids fluttered shut—and pressed his lips to Draco’s. It was a chaste kiss—just to get a feel for what Draco’s lips felt like, against his own.
Harry blinked at Draco. ‘No! No, I mean, sorry, just … to pick up a cutting board. A salt and pepper shaker. My rice cooker. Maybe a good knife.’
‘It’s fine, okay?’ Harry tried to protest. ‘I’ve spoken to Dumbledore, I’ve told him everything. There’s a plan.’
Neville sighed. “Yeah. I’m just … putting it off for a bit.” He shot Harry a smile, a not-to-worry smile. “Do you think that sphere knew what I’ve been worrying about?”
So, Harry busied himself with making pancakes for the both of them, as Malfoy did a bit more cleaning.
At the castle, Harry heard wails and screams of ‘NO!’s and ‘HARRY!’s. Then Neville Longbottom confronted Voldemort. Harry peered out from behind his eyelashes to watch. There were so many people. His friends, his teachers, his classmates. Professor Flitwick, Dean, Hermione, Ron … And then he saw Draco, weeping into his hands; Luna Lovegood had her arms around his waist to hold him up.
Harry decided to try again. ‘Should we go somewhere? Or get take-away? Do you feel like anything in particular?’
Draco pulled away a fraction, eyes raking over Harry. “I like you so much, Harry. And I’m sorry about what I said. For the record, I very much like your face.”
And Harry shouldn’t feel guilty—it was just Malfoy. Malfoy who was definitely up to something nefarious. And was almost certainly a Death Eater.
. Caught staring, Harry rushed to look at Neville, to try to focus on whatever plant-related thing he was saying.
Harry didn’t want to let go. After so much danger, so much uncertainty, so many months of searching and not knowing how he was going to survive—he was finally now feeling safe. Feeling free. But one glance over at the Weasleys, who were crying and holding each other, reminded him that it wasn’t really over. Fred Weasley was dead, along with so many others. There would be funerals, there would be mourning. It was going to be hard.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut. He heard Dean piss. It was all-too-loud, and terribly awkward for everyone involved, probably. Maybe not for Draco, though. Since he seemed determined to stand in that spot forever.
He’d never taken a Muggle lift before, and had only taken the Ministry one with his father (and hadn’t paid much attention to it at the time). But these things were probably straight-forward. The upwards-pointing triangle made sense, so he pressed that one. It lit up in red. He hoped that was a good thing, but had a niggling suspicion it was not. He knew Muggle traffic lights, after all, and red usually meant ‘stop’.
He washed his hands, and his face a bit, before grabbing his book to go and... walk into the lion’s den, so to speak.
‘I suppose you’ll be off on some death-defying hero’s mission shortly.’ Malfoy said, worrying his bottom lip with his teeth.
Dave returned with a tray of drinks, passing them all around with a big smile. Draco liked him, he decided. He was friendly.
The morning post arrived. Bringing with it the normal sounds of beating wings and packages thumping onto tables.
home—presumably. And in the background: large windows revealed a setting sun and orange and purple-streaked sky as Potter’s bare feet dashed across dark, hardwood floors. There was a bookshelf but Draco couldn't make out any of the titles, and a fern in a planter in the corner—but apart from all that, it was rather barren. Just … just Potter launching his body around the room in time to the music.
‘Goodnight,’ Harry echoed. Wishing he could say more, wishing he could say something, but not knowing what.
The summer night was growing cool, and a soft breeze ruffled Draco's hair, as Harry Potter sank into the free seat next to him—with a half-drunk cocktail glass in hand, and a loosened black tie hanging from his neck.
As fragments of conversations in languages he did not understand passed by his attention, all Harry wanted to look at was Draco, sitting across from him. They sat at a wrought-iron table in a busy outdoor square surrounded by fellow tourists chattering happily.
‘Oh,’ Hermione said, and Harry could sense her blush without having to look. ‘I suppose it’s possible.’
After he was finished, he opened up that mini fridge. He didn’t recognise any of the drinks—they had that loopy middle eastern writing on them. (He didn’t know if Afghans had their own language, or, would it be Arabic? He really should’ve done at least a little research before dropping everything to come to a country 5,000 kilometres away).
A laughing girl with a blonde ponytail bumped hard into his side. ‘Ah, je m’excuse,’ she said tossing him a passing side-glance. ‘I’m sorry,’ she added in thick French accent.
She was right. She’d guessed his thoughts, and she was right. He had been just about to regurgitate his father’s views again. Because … because that was what he’d always known, what had been drilled into him from birth. “You’re right. I don’t.” He’d chosen to go against his father, based on what he’d learned, what he’d lived through. But sometimes … sometimes the old thoughts were just … automatic.
Harry twitched his own fingers, feeling them brush up against Draco’s. A soft sleepy sound escaped Draco’s mouth—something tiny, something he wasn’t even aware of. And Draco’s hand smoothed over Harry’s—the pads of his fingertips grazing over Harry’s knuckles.
, after all. They hadn't been shy like this, not since they'd gotten together. Usually it felt like they could talk about anything and everything.
Draco walked carefully, minding where he stepped, while pressing his palms against tree trunks for support, feeling the rough bark against his skin. Branches grazed his sleeves and trousers, but he didn’t mind—he was listening to the rustling of leaves in the wind, the chirping of birds. He was noticing how the sunlight fell through the trees in glittering patches. He breathed the air deep into his lungs.
At dinner, Pansy let out a huge gasp. She covered her mouth, and looked right at Draco with wide-eyes. Then she whispered excitedly in Blaise’s ear. Blaise let out a guffaw of a laugh. Draco sighed. He felt left out, but the thing was, he
The walk back was decidedly less relaxing. Possibly due to one Ronald Weasley. Though Draco couldn’t fault him for any of it. They all had every right to hate him.
Potter grabbed onto Draco’s forearm before he could storm off. Draco finally looked down at Harry’s face. He … looked like he was about ready to cry.
Draco paused, and shot Harry a look. ‘There is this French restaurant I’ve been missing, Le Café du Marché—'
It was Harry’s turn to blink too much. “Er, ah … sure. I mean, yeah. You’re … well, anyone would say you’re …"
“Did you have any plans for the day?” Harry asked. Draco could hear him shuffling around over there. Possibly nude.
The music changed over to a new song—something softer and sweeter—and everyone stretched their necks to peer over their shoulders. At the bride, presumably.
Harry found it fascinating to watch, like having live entertainment during meals. For example, there was Pansy Parkinson, looking mean and saying something with a sour twist to her mouth, and then the two Hufflepuff girls on either side of her were bursting out into giggles. Pansy would smile with satisfaction, though the smile was tiny and easy to miss.
Draco bit his lip and nodded at them, suppressing a full-body shiver at the sound of his given name coming from Potter’s mouth.
He deflated. “Ah.” Turning to Draco, he added, “This might be in The Prophet tomorrow. That’s another drawback of being Harry Potter’s boyfriend.”
He pulled out the journal, and opened it up, squinting blearily at the page, waiting for his eyes to adjust. Thanks to the sliver of moonlight coming in from the window, he was able to make out:
Harry looked down at his plate, miserably, and continued eating. Purple tasted like hamburger, for some reason.
“Professor Vector will no longer be teaching at Hogwarts,” Minerva said, as they settled in chairs around her desk. “Dismissed on grounds of harassing a fellow professor with a magical object, and attempting to physically assault a second professor.”
“Yeah,” Potter agreed, climbing to his feet and launching himself into his bed, burrowing under the covers. Then, as an afterthought, he pulled off his glasses and tossed them onto the bedside table. Then he nuzzled himself deeper into the bed.
Groaning, Draco crawled his way up Harry's body and collapsed over half of him, with his face pressed up against Harry's cheek.
‘He’s joining our side … I don’t think he wants to be a Death Eater. I offered to … help him,’ Harry added.
Ron shrugged. “It’s alright. We have wards to alert us if there are any scoundrels around,” he said, grinning.
Harry smiled, and crinkled his eyes when he did. He unlocked the thing with a beep-beep noise triggered by some device pinched between his fingers. Harry opened the passenger door for Draco.
Maybe he should’ve tried to thank her and her friends. It’d been a lot of fun dancing along with them.
Harry wanted to groan, but he didn’t. He tore his eyes away from the square below, and looked at Draco head-on. “Yes, and I still eat, shit, and sleep like every other human being. I fuck up, I make every mistake. I thought you knew that … I thought you saw me differently, saw the real me—saw past The Prophet and the rumours and the hero-worship.” Fuck. He honestly really had thought Malfoy was different. Harry ran a hand over his face, and exhaled slow, before continuing, “The only goddamn reason I’m seen as a hero is because of all the people who had to die so I could survive to be the one to face Voldemort. Do you think that feels good?” He was so tired. So fucking tired of being Harry Potter. “My parents, my godfather, my mentors, my friends … even my owl. They were all murdered, because of
'No,' Harry said quickly, swiping a hand through his hair and looking off towards an empty brown chair across the room.
Harry let out a shaky breath. He didn’t know what to say, what to think. He just knew that an ache had manifested itself in his chest.
Draco cleared his throat, shutting his eyes at the touch—he was getting goose bumps up the back of his arms. 'I can work from anywhere with a computer. And travel by Portkey when necessary.'
Harry leant down and kissed Draco again. Salazar, it was wonderful to be kissed so much. Harry broke away to say, “We should go to your bench on the hiking trail one more time.”
The broken north wall Harry’d been repairing went forgotten, and levitating bricks clambered to the ground.
? Potter seemed upset, actually upset about it. Draco blinked, not comprehending this sudden outburst. “Er, we can do things.”
Harry went back to his empty flat after work, and stood in the kitchen, looking out the window. It was dark so early these days, but the light layer of snow on the ground reflected the street lights. It seemed so still out there. Not a lot of people wanting to brave the snow tonight, he figured.
Draco exhaled and slumped back in his chair, rubbing at his face with one hand. (Should Harry not have asked?)
Friends. Of course. Harry released a breath he didn’t realise he’d been holding. Draco’s response filled his head like words circling round a drain. When they sunk in, he gave a little shake to his head, and swallowed. ‘Ah. Like a mobile phone.’
'Would you chase after a tornado?' Draco asked under his breath. Of course Harry and his people would.
Draco frowned. 'Suppose not.' It's just … he missed beachwear Harry, because that’d been the Harry that
'Aren't you planning to eat breakfast, Harry?' Hermione asked, smiling. She knew exactly what was going on, as usual.
“It was bloody embarrassing, mate,” Ron said, giving Harry’s shoulders a squeeze, and guiding him out back into the living room.
Draco paid by Muggle credit card. (Credit cards were so much easier than trying to fumble around with coins and notes, all while getting stared at by the cashier for being some kind of imbecile that hadn’t memorized which coin or rectangle of paper meant what).
But why on earth would Draco Malfoy send chocolates, send flowers, send poetry about love, along with cryptic messages ... only to cap all those lovely gifts off with a hateful diary?
He changed in the bathroom, while Draco changed in the bedroom. The clothes fit well—a little tight in the chest, perhaps. It made Harry wonder, though: how many times had Draco worn that very shirt to bed? Over how many years? Fifteen?
And Malfoy nodded back, offering a sympathetic twitch of his mouth, like he understood. He reached for Harry’s hand, and brought it to hold on his own lap, cradling it in both hands.
Draco sighed. “I suppose you want to collect this one too? Well, alright. But you’re wasting your time, because these are all seriously awful. If you like poetry, you should go to the library and check out Keats or something.”
'Had the right pamphlet, did he?' Draco laughed under his breath. 'Anyway, I'm sorry I interrupted.'
‘Thanks,’ Malfoy muttered, without looking him in the eye. He raised his cup in a gesture of cheers, and turned to leave.
‘Oh,’ Harry rubbed at his neck. ‘Er, yeah. That all started when we were eleven. An old habit, I suppose.’
After one more normal-sized fruity drink, and a round of office gossip about Jerry and Tim in accounting, a buzz was starting to brew within Draco. He wasn't too worried about what his employees thought about him anymore. He began swaying to the music, just stood at the bar.
The sound had come from the sphere. And it’d been in Malfoy’s own voice. But it was softer—it didn’t sound like an insult.
Harry leaned forward a little, with eyes locked onto Draco’s face all twisted up with pleasure, he carefully moved his hands from Draco’s chest to either side of Draco’s head. ‘Oh!’ The change of angle felt
Harry was, admittedly, aware that he might be trying to lie to himself. Nonetheless, he was just … not ready to go there yet.
Draco looked around the living room. Sofa, table, and wireless were all in their proper places. He still had papers from work strewn about the table, along with an empty mug he’d forgotten to wash before he left.
He turned and smacked his hands against the surface, making a beautiful arc of spray in Harry's direction.
Next he'd prepare the remaining ingredients while he waited for the meat to be ready. Unfortunately, that included onion chopping.
His smile fell slightly. That wasn't something he'd ever write in a love letter to someone else, he'd say something better than "decent". Harry needed to try harder. He thought of his appearance, what he actually liked about it.
Draco blinked and pivoted so that he faced Potter now, and his back was to the wall. “Nothing,” he answered quickly. He hadn't ogled.
'Welcome everyone,' the instructor started. 'My name is Angelpreet, and I'm happy to teach you all computer skills for the next ten weeks.'
Ron clapped a hand on Harry’s back. ‘Yeah, we’ll make more of an effort. Can’t have you resorting to
It was only a mark. And yet, Harry’s feet froze to the floor as he stared at the darkened, gouged stonework.
“Great, thanks,” Malfoy said, tugging Harry along with him as he went where the nurse had indicated.
Draco smiled, maybe a little wistfully, and turned his head to the side to look at Harry. ‘Scorpius couldn’t stop talking about Albus. Every summer, he’d come back full of stories, and I’d have to hear them all fifty times over.’
He was able to fit the mattress snug to the allotted space … but the mattress had the hardness of plastic, when Harry tested it out with a hand. And it was a bit warped—with one corner lifted in the air. They’d pretty much ruined it.
This seemed like a different person altogether. And it was just as fascinating as it made Harry uneasy.
Harry’s short note had bothered Draco, clearly it had. And he’d brought up the topic with an air of hesitation, like he might be afraid of what Harry would say.
If truth were told, really, Draco was having a hard time. His entire identity had been shattered from the war. He didn’t know who he even
Draco bit at his lip and eyed the vehicle again. He wasn’t exactly a fan. But he trusted Harry. (If you couldn't trust Harry Potter, who could you trust?) ‘Okay. Let’s do it.’
She ignored him. ‘But nothing happened, right? So Blaise and I thought the potion was faulty, or you didn’t drink enough of it … But we’d used the whole bottle, and it was from a reputable source! Kind of expensive, really. So, I thought and I thought, and then I realised it—the only explanation.’
‘To coming here.’ Draco seemed to be suppressing an eyeroll, which only made Harry want to smile. ‘To actually agreeing to this weekend.’ Draco looked as if he were trying to appear very focussed on his naan, but his postured had tensed slightly.
A familiar beat started. Draco glanced at Potter because it was Potter’s song—from one of his DJ set videos.
'I know …' His heart gave a sudden jolt. 'Wait, I wasn't supposed to tell anyone.' If people found out where Harry was …
“I want you too,” Harry blurted. “I want you, back. I don’t want to fuck it up either. Let’s not … let’s not fuck it up.”
Potter sank down so that his lips were underwater, but his eyes were glued to Draco’s face as he listened.
Ah. Harry lowered himself to sit cross-legged beside Malfoy. He stared at the symbols, wondering what they meant.
Draco bit back a laugh, because he could make a stupid quip about those words. Instead, though, he did what Harry told him.
Then Harry slumped down at his desk, and placed the book in front of him. Maybe it wasn’t a big deal. Another collection of poems, perhaps.
She let out a little sigh. 'Your father is a stubborn man. But he has no say in this, do you understand? I will deal with him.'
Harry attacked the sandwiches with gusto, Malfoy nibbled away at one, shooting Harry side-eyed glances of mild disgust.
Harry deflated a bit, looking down at his mug in his hands. ‘He’ll be here in six weeks. It feels like ages away.’
They found an empty classroom, and Hermione sat at a desk. When Harry and Ron kept standing, she shot them both a look, and gestured to the two desks across from her. Reluctantly, the two of them slid into the chairs.
Harry whirled around, to find Malfoy watching him from the doorway to his bedroom, leaning against the doorframe. He had on a light blue button-down, a medium-blue tie, grey trousers, and was currently buttoning up a matching grey waistcoat. It was the warm kind of grey, like … less blue than other greys. And Merlin was the outfit tailored to him.
Harry loved the holidays. He had since he was eleven—since he’d had people to celebrate with, and get to show his love to. The whole season just felt romantic to him, somehow. Like everything was just a bit more infused with love—like wonderful things were bound to happen.
Harry stopped and swung Draco into him, taking his other hand. Laughing, Draco once again allowed himself to pulled into a ballroom dance that would've been more appropriate at the Hogwarts' Yule Ball.
He pulled his hand from under hers and rubbed his eyes under his glasses. ‘He just didn’t want to. It’s not a big deal.’
He Accio’d another mug. And waited. Sipped the tea. Tried to keep any unwanted feelings from creeping up. He was
Draco rummaged around in the drawer for his letter opener. Finding it, he sliced the envelope open. He pulled the card out as he walked over to his armchair, frowning at it. It had silly little cartoon birds on it. His mother would never send something so juvenile.
Harry shrugged. “I guess they’ve stayed friends after Hogwarts.” Apparently they'd somehow bonded from Luna being imprisoned in Malfoy Manor, but Harry thought better than to mention that out loud.
Oh, that’d be his neighbour, then. Harry turned his head to find a rather wide-eyed Draco Malfoy staring at him from the balcony next door, dressed in a blue button-down tucked into grey trousers.
Astoria kissed him again, deeply, while reaching behind herself and unhooking her bra. She released his mouth, and leaned back, making it impossible to avoid looking at her chest.
George put one of Fred’s LPs on the turntable, and something that Harry could only guess was 1980s American hip-hop started to play.
“What—” started McGonagall, out of breath, appearing in the doorway behind the ghost. Evidently the noise had reached her even from a flight below. She glared sternly through the white wispy body to them. “Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy, banish this ghost. We can’t have it frightening the First Years once class starts. Mr Finnigan, I need you down here for a tricky cursed chair.” She turned to disappear down the stairs, muttering under her breath, “We are traumatised enough as it is, can’t have
'Neither side. I've only ever had a twin bed my entire life. So, er, wherever you want me to sleep is fine. Makes no difference to me.'
Draco meandered deeper into the store. Lots of handmade things—woven purses and clothing and candles and such.
know.’ He pinched his mouth closed, then relented to add, ‘You looked fit in your robes and absolutely miserable with that Patil woman. I’d imagined myself cutting in, showing you how it’s done—' Draco cut himself off, his cheeks becoming pink.
Unfortunately he caught the exact moment that Seamus Finnegan was excitedly telling Harry Potter something. And Draco was pretty sure he knew what that something was. Great. Draco was a laughing stock. He knew he should look away from Potter’s face, because Potter laughing at him was something that he wouldn’t be able to bear. He knew it would haunt him for the rest of his life. Draco Malfoy in love with Harry Potter—what a joke. As if Draco thought he’d ever stand a chance … A cowardly Death Eater with the Saviour of the Wizarding World. It was pathetic. It was worse than pathetic. It was shameful.
Harry smiled, and said softly, ‘Thank you.’ He folded the paper up, and shoved it into his jean pocket.
Harry was pulled back into consciousness at the sound of Draco’s voice. He smiled. ‘You were funny.’
That Friday, the day of the date, was nothing but nervous energy for Harry. All morning, and all afternoon long. He couldn’t eat much. He was mostly convinced he was going to bollocks it up. His palms were sweaty—he kept having to rub them on his trousers, and hope that no one wanted to shake his hand.
Ron nodded his agreement with Hermione, but Harry could tell he was very opposed to the idea of Harry being friendly with Malfoy. And Harry couldn’t really fault him for it.
‘Also … I’ve gotten a letter from Professor McGonagall,’ Hermione began, Harry’s ears perked up. ‘They’re working on repairs later this summer, and we’re invited to come help. Only if we want to or can, of course.’
Harry sucked at the head gently, and felt as Draco's cock rapidly filled up all the way. It tasted of skin and musk and a little bitterness. And Harry fucking loved it.
He nodded. ‘Thank you …' He wanted to thank her properly, but wasn’t sure of the correct words. ‘You’ve really helped me ... more than I can say.’
After a while, Draco tugged on Potter’s arm. He wanted to talk more. They both righted themselves. Draco opened his mouth to speak, then closed it. What had he wanted to say? ‘Ah, do you come here a lot?’
A middle-aged South Asian woman with a black bob and a blue pantsuit stood behind a large desk at one end of the room—the instructor presumably. She eyed him with thinly-veiled surprise. 'This is a beginner's class, for computers,' she said.
It was simply too hot, there were too many people around, and it was far too loud. Dozens of Hogwarts students were inside the shop with him, shoving each other, bumping into book displays, and chattering excitedly about yet another year at school.
“Hmm. It does, yes, but … only certain people refer to Voldemort as ‘Dark Lord’, don’t they? Death Eaters, certain Slytherins, people on
Harry cleared his throat, and distracted himself by stepping farther into the room and looking around instead. “You have time,” Harry reminded him, as he stared at a bookshelf, overflowing with books. They looked to all be about Potions theory and references for ingredients, of course. He cast a quick Tempus.
Okay, he was probably properly blushing, then. He caught Pansy’s eye, and she was grinning at him. Well, might as well join in on the fun. ‘Oh you
His gaze floated over to his own marshmallow, which was getting nicely browned on all sides. He pulled it out, clearing his throat. “See, Potter. This is a proper toasted marshmallow.”
“Hello!” Rose rushed over and flailed herself over Harry’s knees in order to hug his legs awkwardly.
Harry looked at Draco, his mouth pink and wet with saliva, his hair mussed up, and his eyes: bare, open, sparkling. Harry swiped a hand through Draco’s hair to smooth it. ‘Imagine if it were your cock in my arse.’
‘Right, noted.’ Harry sighed again. He didn’t know what he’d expected out of this, but it certainly wasn’t to feel like the world’s biggest fool in front of Draco Malfoy.
Harry ran fingers through his hair, inadvertently ruffling it up worse. Malfoy seemed to notice, but didn’t comment.
,’ Harry argued. ‘I’ve just … I don’t know. You don’t need to change anything, and I’m glad to see you both so happy. And you deserve this easy time together, you know, after … the last several years.’
Harry looked at Candelabra, flipped back up on her feet now, rubbing up against Draco again. “Okay, I’m going to pet her.”
Draco’s eyes fell to Harry’s mouth, looking a bit startled to see Harry smiling at him. He cleared his throat politely, and quipped, “Good taste in men, surely.”
“Mi dispiace,” Malfoy nearly whispered, and leant down to kiss Harry’s mouth, which Harry met with vigour.  They kissed—open-mouthed, wet, with tongues wild and desperate and unsynchronised. They kissed with eyes open, with Malfoy’s cock pushed deep inside of Harry, and rhythm slowed.
They finished up getting the last few things and headed back to Draco’s flat with heaps of bags in hand.
There was a pause. Harry heard a small thud. Something against the stall door? Draco’s hand? His forehead? ‘See what?’ Draco asked, in barely more than a whisper.
Pansy slumped, and her eyes raked over his face. A sad smile formed on her lips. “I want you there.”
“A gift,” she said cheekily, her dimples were so prominent when she smiled like that. “From the farm.”
Mei nodded; her eyes unfocussed as she smiled softly. “She liked helping. Especially fellow LGBTQ members.”
Malfoy laughed, then, speaking out of the side of his mouth at Harry, “I think they’re meant to be hamsters.”
He went back inside, and poured out a couple fingers. When he returned, Malfoy stood in the same spot, eyeing him oddly.
Draco didn’t answer right away. He stared off, long enough that Harry wondered if he’d heard him. ‘It might make you see me differently.’
“What are you going to do with that thing, anyway?” Harry asked, eyeing it, as everyone loitered around waiting for Flitwick to be done checking them all out at the front desk.
Essentially, he’d said Draco looked awful, and insulted his stupid Muggle clothing. So Draco looked like a hangover and Potter thought he was hideous.
They landed on a silent stretch of beach, lit well-enough by a gibbous moon. A gentle breeze passed over them, and Potter dropped Draco’s hands to spin around and look out at the water.
“Sign here, if you’re satisfied that there aren’t any scratches or damage.” The man handed Draco the clipboard, and a biro.
God … they’d moved so fast. How did they get from not talking, to a date, to a mutual confession of feelings, to snogging, to having amazing sex, and, finally, to holding hands in a hospital waiting room?
Malfoy glanced away towards the bar. “I worried we wouldn’t know what to talk about. Or we’d find something to argue about, since … well, that was what we always did.”
‘Er, yeah.’ He winced. It was an embarrassing thing to admit. Well … all of it was. ‘And this trip started as Pansy’s idea … she thought I had nothing to lose. And I suppose that’s true. But … I wasn’t thinking how intrusive it was to just … show up. You’d come here to leave the UK behind and have a new life and I had no right to barge in. After your show today, I’d decided to go back to my hotel, and then leave in the morning. I’d said a goodbye, in a way. It was closure enough. And then, afterwards, there you were … But I lied to you, when I should’ve said the truth from the start.’ He inhaled sharp. He’d gotten a bit out of breath after all that.
Luna giggled beside Harry. She grabbed his arm and led him to sit in the large circle forming on the floor in the middle of the common room. Er, he wasn’t too sure about this—
Thankfully he knew this hall, and a bathroom was just around the corner. He beelined for it, with all his remaining willpower and a hand on the wall for balance. Harry then rushed into a toilet stall, locked it, and sank to the floor. He wrapped his arms tight around his shins, with face pressed into his knees.
Draco finally met Harry’s eyes, Draco’s shined grey and stormy, and hard to read. ‘Here,’ he said, as he held up a plate with a pink faded linear design on it, and, a fork.
Draco padded over to the window to look out. He could see the lake, misty and dream-like at this time of day. All the trees that surrounded it were red, orange, and golden yellow. It looked like it was going to be a nice day.
'You dozed off, there,' Harry said, tilting his head over Draco's line of sight, blocking the sunlight.
“Right,” said Malfoy. “Right …” He paused to mull it over. “Ah … yeah, sure. Fuck it, right? Why not. Let’s go to fucking Spain.”
She ignored his raised eyebrow, and produced the form in question. Draco grabbed it from her, and brought it over to the table he'd shoved up against the wall.
They ate in silence, sipping at their espressos and looking down off the terrace, as their sides of the tiramisu got closer and closer to the other’s side. Then it was a thin strip, and they just went for it—finishing off the rest in equal bites.
He stared at the hand-writing. It was in cursive—very loopy. He couldn’t tell if it were more masculine or feminine. Though, judging gender based on writing wasn’t exactly a reliable science anyhow. Luna’s writing was elegant and round, riddled with doodles of creatures resembling things like panda bears and tree sprites. Ginny’s, on the other hand, was barely legible scratches, not so different from Harry’s, come to think of it. So he’d been a bit rash to accuse her of writing it in the first place—though he’d never had a reason to doubt she’d sent him the first one, until now.
He groaned into his hands. He was almost pissed off. He didn’t want to creep on Potter, and the very idea of Pansy thinking he would... He bit back a sharp retort. She... she meant well, he had to remind himself. Well enough, anyway.
Ginny laughed at something Morgana said, throwing her head back. It was more of a guffaw, and Harry nearly winced. His immediate thought was:
Stepping out of the shower, Draco towelled off. Then he realised that he hadn’t brought in a change of clothes. Ugh—Of course.
He should ... he should promise, shouldn't he? Draco wasn't worth more to him than his relationship with Ginny, right? It'd only been a few letters. And, yeah, they'd been nice and surprisingly fun, but they weren't going to last forever. It had all been a bit of catch-up. Soon they'd run out of things to say, and it'd fizzle out organically. So why not say it, then? To Ginny? He could promise her ... promise her there's nothing there, that he'll stop ...
When he arrived to the Headmistress’s office, he saw two stiff backs facing him. The backs belonged to Professors Vector and Malfoy, and they were sat across from a rather cross-looking Minerva.
Draco stepped down, and joined the crowd. He beelined for Mrs and Mr Creevey, who waited to greet him with warm, albeit sad, smiles. Draco extended a hand, to shake both of theirs.
Grinning, Harry fiddled with a remote that’d been on the coffee table, and then fished around the floor for their discarded cushions, putting them all back into place.
Harry didn’t say anything in response, so Draco kept going. “They’re just scars, all of it is just marks, like on a parchment.” He furrowed his brow as an idea came to him. “I’d never really thought of this before, but... the scars mean that I survived. That my body took care of me and healed the wounds, stitching me back together... The scars mean that I’m still here.” He looked down at his folded hands over his lap, and smiled. That... that felt nice to realise.
“Um. Maybe we can do that again sometime.” They made eye contact. Salazar he was so close, his eyes … so
Feeling like a scolded puppy following his master, Harry trailed in after Draco, through the room he’d entered earlier as Draco mumbled to himself. Things like: Jesus, fuck, and
“Well... I’m going to...” Potter swiped a hand through his hair. “I’m off to Seamus and Dean’s room,” he said.
'Anyway, I got the pamphlet from Dave, and the handful of condoms. And Nils called me, and we kept on.' Harry took a breath. 'I bought a house, and he soon sort of moved in.'
Draco smiled politely, and took the hand. 'And you.' He had a gentle handshake, for such a strong-looking man.
Potter blinked some more, as if he couldn’t quite comprehend what Draco was asking. “I asked if you had a boyfriend?”
Draco bent to the side to pick up his wand from the nightstand. Harry watched the movement, the way Draco’s muscles contracted and shifted in his torso. His chest—
Why would Harry strike out hand? Hand would’ve worked fine. The filter between thoughts and hand. Yes, that worked. Unless …
After the chicken had been marinating in the sauce for a good while, Harry decided to start chopping the onion.
“Why aren’t you … with your family?” Harry asked tentatively, searching his memory for clues. Nothing had happened to Draco’s parents, had they? He avoided the Prophet like the plague, but, someone would’ve mentioned it if something had happened to Draco’s parents, probably.
Draco eyed the names carved into stone. ‘It’s very nice to meet you both. I’ll … I will do my best to take care of your son.’
. 'Thank you, for showing me around, for being such a great host.' Draco suppressed a wince—it all sounded so formal. The truth was … the truth was he didn't want to leave ... But that wouldn't be helpful to either of them.
Okay, there was no way Potter wrote that. No way. “May your love grow and grow with each passing day, may you lean on each other in times of trouble. May you feel nothing but blessed happiness in each other’s arms. All my love, Harry Potter.”
