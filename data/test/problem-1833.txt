uglier. (It was a childhood dream of Draco’s that one day Potter would grow into the toad that he so obviously was.)
With the amount of raw magic circling around the Ministry, the Muggle device was bound to malfunction. Perhaps exploding was a rather exorbitant malfunction — but what did they expect, really. Muggle devices have never properly functioned amongst magic.
And that’s when a gigantic grey carriage burst through an opening in the foliage. A pompous looking pig of a man jumped out and ran (or rather, waddled) towards Draco and Potter.
“Sit down, Gra—Hermione.” Granger looked at Draco suspiciously. “Fine then, stand. You’re not allowed to sit ever again.”
Someone whose name Draco had never bothered to learn turned to Draco from Potter’s side, “as if Harry would ever do anything like that with a former death eater.”
The group of shame-faced Aurors glanced at each other in mild panic. It was just now occurring to them how incredibly stupid their actions had been. Draco exchanged a look with Astoria and swallowed a laugh.
world?” Potter nodded. “And I’m the main heroine of the said fairytale?” Potter nodded. “And you’re both the abusive and ugly stepsisters.” Draco glared at Potter — Potter’s nod faltered.
Draco wasn’t sure what irritated him more — the fact that Potter was going around recommending him to people, or the fact that this arrogant slug had very obviously approached
fault, Potter. If you’d bloody listened to what Robards was trying to tell you, instead of running forward like the ninny that you are—”
“Stop talking to yourself,” Draco muttered, pulling himself off the grass. It was then that he realised — with rather disconcerting apathy — that he was wearing a dress.
“THE RAID WAS VERY EVENTFUL!” Potter interrupted, his eyes wide. “Tell me more about the office — did you finish all the paperwork?”
“You too, Draco, Harry, dear,” said the man-pig, in a much kinder tone than what he’d used with Granger.
And so Draco stood, in abject horror, staring at the mass of red hair standing on the raised dais above the ballroom.
angry, but it was anger at himself — a deep, visceral thing that never really went away. Despite everything, he was above externalising that anger on undeserving subjects. It was pathetically crass to do so, after all.
“All I can remember from Hogwarts is your sanctimonious arse skipping through the hallway holding hands with Granger and Weasel,”
“Wouldn’t you rather spend time with me?” Draco asked, smirking slightly, and putting as much charm as possible into his demeanour.
Draco grit his teeth, “congratulations, Potter. You have eyes. Now, if you’d use them properly, you’d notice that you’re
"Oh, none of that." Hermione waved the idea off angrily. "They have to. It wasn't your bloody fault."
Speaking of said company, the tosser was trudging across the grass after Harry, lifting his robes up at the hems. Harry whipped off his robes, grateful as the cool winter chill hit him. Heaving a deep sigh of contentment, he tossed his robes to the side and plopped on the ground. He closed his eyes for a few moments, waiting for Malfoy to catch up.
Ron rubbed the back of his neck, looking flushed, “Thanks, Hermione.” He threw a meaningful glance at Harry which Harry returned with a mouthed,
Draco shivered, and quickly packed up his stuff to go back to the Common Room where a couch by the fireplace had his name on it. He had much to think about.
"You will all be competing for the title as Triwizard Champion through a series of obstacles and tests placed around this labyrinth! The first to navigate and find the cup will be crowned! On you marks, gentlemen…"
“Maybe you could even actively go against me somehow,” Harry continued, “That’d really cement your position.”
"D…Dad." Dudley said weakly, garnering the attention of his father once more. "It's true…I saw the light…"
Draco woke up the next morning to Blaise sitting patiently at the end of his bed, smirking like the bloody idiot he was. When he saw Draco had awoken, his mouth curled from a smirk in to a full out malicious grin.
" Harry quickly jolted to action, Malfoy following suit by keeping their hands clasped on one side and holding Harry's shoulder on the other.  Harry, scouring through his memory of McGonagall's dance lesson, just managed to keep up with Malfoy as they begun to dance. The git, of course, had to look like he was bloody
. I could tell he's been lying to me for a while but I was too ignorant to do anything about it. He never spoke to me about his 'business' dealings, what he did all the time."
"And now I'm thinking, when was he planning to involve me? When the Dark Lord came back? When our family was in the midst of a war again? I know for sure my father won't just stand aside if he came back, not with how much he idolises the Lord. Will he make me join them too? I don't bloody
Draco snorted, remembering the day before when half of the Defense class had rioted against Umbridge’s idealised curriculum. It would have been more amusing if Harry hadn’t landed himself in detention. That boy right there was another problem in and of itself.
"Shut it." Harry aimed a foot in the direction of Draco's legs, and was pleased to find they hit some sort of mark.
Draco felt his cheeks burn, and could tell he was flushing horribly. "I didn't really- It was just I got captured-"
, want anybody dead for it. Please believe that, Potter." Malfoy finished. Harry laughed humourlessly and looked at Malfoy incredulously, "You're more naïve than I thought. Merlin, you've been sheltered. I haven't even been in the Wizarding World more than four years and I know more about reality than you."
Umbridge stared at him for a few moments, arms coiled around herself. She was looking at him as if she really did believe he was crazy and Harry was starting to wonder the same thing.
He repressed a shudder. His father, whom had been at the graveyard that night. Who had watched Voldemort's resurrection, and answered the call for his followers. All at once, the fact that his father was a Death Eater hit him like a bludger to the head. He was a
Harry smiled and let go of his hand. Malfoy grimaced at his dirt patched robes and begun patting them down irritably.
Draco snorted, "When don't you? Be glad there was no Potions. Snape can probably smell mental weakness and you'd have been reeking of more of it than usual."
Draco blanched. That wasn't what he had expected. Why would Harry be talking about an escaped convict all of a sudden?
A lot of children weren’t talking to him as much as they were with Pansy, as a result. That was, besides one.
He turned his head to the side to the side, where the curtain surrounding him obscured his view of Draco in the next bed, whom had been sleeping when he came in.
Draco's mouth curled involuntarily in to a smile. "Well the spell requires a bonder, and I know just the person who can bond us right now."
“And I’m sure that there would have indeed been some….occurrences at the Ministry lately, in response to such rumours. It’s only natural, of course. Changes are bound to happen…”
“...and so after you sign a form that legally hands over the item to the Ministry, submissions are critically processed by our archive specialists and assigned a number…”
"Indeed. Now it wasn't until Ron said to me one day-" She pauses and looks at him, "Would you like to tell Harry what it was you said to me?"
"Harry!" The woman rushed to him and wrapped him in a bone-crushing hug that had Draco leaning away in order to not get bumped over. Harry hugged her deeply, eyes closed and a single tear rolling down his face.
"I'm sure you did." There was a teasing lilt to Blaise's tone that Draco didn't like at all. He turned his head to the side where Blaise was busy imparting on his personal space, scowling. "Does it have something to do with what happened at the end of Fourth Year, maybe?"
Harry tried reaching over towards Draco, grabbing his arm or making a connection of some sort but Draco flinched away.
They made their way down the oak stairs, the cold wood chilling his toes. Harry ran straight for the kitchen, quick to put on a pot of coffee while Draco lit the fireplace with a flick of his wand. He quickly placed the envelope underneath the makeshift Christmas tree they assembled last night (it was actually just a large monstera plant that they found in the kitchen and moved next to the fireplace) and took a seat on one of the fluffier couches in the living room as he waited for Harry to return with their mugs.
“That’s so fucked up Draco, are you ok?” Aaron seemed like he could be on the brink of tears, he was always the more sensitive one out of the two.
The effect settled in not minutes after they walked inside, Draco’s muscles began to feel heavy and solid, his body feeling consumed by the couch. His eyes shifted around the room, his brain processing information just a split second later than his usual. They watched movies for the rest of the night, laughing at jokes he usually wouldn’t find funny. Draco felt effortlessly happy, besides random waves of anxiety he was feeling light, glancing over at Harry through heavy eyelids.
It was on the brink of summer, and the hot stuffy air was emanating into the bistro, not even the blasting air conditioning having the ability to cool off his body. He decided to blame the sweat in his palms to the weather. He ordered an iced tea from the waitress, bouncing his foot up and down while analyzing the salt and pepper shakers on the table for entertainment.
They lounged on the front porch of the house, bundled up in blankets and layers in order to stay warm while enjoying nature, switching between reading their respective books and chatting casually.
Aaron and Draco walked through the front door of his apartment, Draco still felt rather uncomfortable from his encounter with Potter. He didn’t know why he grabbed Aaron’s hand like that, it's not like Harry cared who he was dating, but given from his stares, it sort of felt like he might’ve. The thought popped out of his head nearly as fast as it popped in, he highly doubts Potter has given him as much as a second thought since Hogwarts.
He joined Ron in his boisterous yelling and jumping around the path to the town, yelling out random profanities and laughing like it was the funniest thing in the world. He caught glimpses of Draco rolling his eyes and saying something to Hermione.
“For your job?! YOUR JOB? The job that you can’t stand! That’s more important to you?” Draco yelled out, his voice breaking occasionally.
They bid each other farewell, Harry watching as the couple walked off down the street, Ron opening his jacket for Hermione to cuddle into.
He lifted his hands and ran them through Harry’s hair, the soft curls feeling wondrous under his touch. He brought his other hand to Harry’s chin, grabbing and pulling his face closer to his, desperate to close the space between them.
Draco nodded. He looked over at Harry, only now realizing how good he looked tonight. His hair was messy but well managed, he had a navy suit that fit him incredibly well, hugging his legs and thighs in all the right places.
“I was not jealous! I was simply… curious. Is all.” Harry tried to defend himself, the flush in his cheeks obviously giving him away.
Harry rubbed his hands over Draco’s head, keeping the tight pressure around his body as Draco continued to sob. He cried until he felt he had nothing left inside of him, until he was drained. His red, swollen eyes, lifted. He rubbed the palm of his hand into his eyes in an attempt to hide the redness of his face, a feeble attempt considering Harry had already seen it.
“I did mean it by the way. What I said last night? It wasn’t just cause I was really drunk or anything.” Harry said, his hand tugging at his hair lightly.
Draco had been sitting at the Ministry waiting for Harry for nearly 2 hours, the building was almost entirely cleared out as even the employees had already gone home. He agreed that if Harry wasn’t going to arrive within the next 15 minutes, he was going to simply leave and spend the night at Aarons, if his safety was so important to the Ministry, he wouldn’t be sitting here alone.
By no surprise, he had landed in front of Draco’s apartment building, staring up at the dark red brick of the structure. He had been here only once before, stopping by after the raid to look for evidence with Casper. Now, nearly 6 months later, he was seeing it in a completely new light.
They walked mostly in silence to a bistro, Marie periodically chatting about her life at work. Although Draco hadn’t so much as brought up Harry since her and Oliver had come over for dinner, he had a lingering feeling that this lunch was about to be centered around that.
Harry was still grateful for their friendship, and how positively they reacted when he came out, Hermione in particular; whereas Ron took a little longer to warm up, but that was only because Harry had to break up with Ginny in the process, leaving her heartbroken. Harry still remained part of the family despite this, still spending every holiday with the Weasley’s, him and Ginny now good friends.
“It’s no worry, I wasn’t really the best boyfriend so it's understandable. I wanted to apologize for that, by the way, you deserved better.” Harry said genuinely, his face serious and his eyebrows furrowed. “I was an idiot, probably still am.”
As Harry walked into the kitchen, he looked at Draco with such pity. Who wouldn’t, Draco thought, aware of his appearance. He was hunched over a bottle of scotch, his eyes red and face pale, an aura of depression covering him like a cloud.
When it came to Harry, Draco didn’t have many doubts. They had lived without each other for nearly 10 years, and despite becoming friends in the few months that they were forced to live harmoniously by the Ministry, Draco knew that he was not dependent on Harry for his emotional wellbeing. Not to say that he was on Aaron, but their years of friendship made it significantly harder to abandon.
Draco met Harry’s face and placed a kiss on his lips, his mouth already open and desperate to get to the bedroom.
“What do you say we take the day off of work, I’m sure I can make something up to Greg about how my aunt died and I need you there for emotional support or something. We can grab a pint, talk about this Noah bastard of yours?” Aaron asked with a warm smile. Draco nodded, grateful he didn’t have to actually use his brain to do work today.
There wasn’t much noise this early in the morning, only the song of birds outside and the subtle drip of the coffee machine, this kind of serenity was incredibly rare in Harry’s life.
“I don’t even know, Marie. Merlin, when did life get this complicated.” He said with a groan, his eyes beginning to burn with the rise of tears, he blinked them away quickly.
“Oh please, you haven’t seen anything yet” Harry replied smugly, grasping the back of Draco’s neck to pull him into a kiss.
Draco rose from bed after a night of turning in his sleep, unable to stay still or get any bit of rest. This always happened the night before an event that he was anxious for, the night before he was directed to kill Dumbledore, he hadn’t even managed to get a single ounce of sleep. Although this was less extreme, his chest was still heavy and his mind racing. It was the morning of the wedding and his brain had gone through nearly every possible scenario that could occur, as if that would make him any more prepared. He didn’t have to be at the venue until around 4 pm, so he still had the whole day to overthink and get more and more anxious as the time drew closer. It was 7 in the morning, far too early for Malfoy but knowing himself, he knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep any longer. He decided on working on a potion for work in the meantime, hoping to drown himself in his work so as to avoid any confrontation with his own thoughts.
His bags were packed and set at the front door not 15 minutes later, his mind empty and focused on only one thing; getting out of Italy and as far away from Harry as he could. Perhaps he was being rash in his decisions, but he knew himself well enough to know that this was not something he could forgive. He had placed his trust in Harry, opened himself up to another person for the first time in years, and was greeted by only pain.
After their lunch they had been awkwardly chatting on the couches, the white soft leather of the couches wrinkling as he sat down. It was hard to catch up on their lives especially with their kidnapping dooming over their heads, the metaphorical elephant in the room. He debated telling her about Harry, he knew that she was aware of his sexuality but it was never a topic of conversation between the two of them; especially since his father had been adamantly against talking about it - insisting that his sex life was something private for only himself.
Draco had visited the Manor soon after Narcissa had gotten home from the infirmary, she had minimal injuries, his dad taking most of the torture. His mother was battered and clearly traumatized, barely speaking a word the majority of the time he was over.
The music began to play a little louder as a group of auror’s that he assumed worked with Ron began to dance in the middle of the room, their voices getting louder as they swayed to the song. Harry looked at Draco with a knowing glance, urging him to go dance.
Draco’s eyebrows softened before returning to his cold exterior, Harry thought he was going to slam the door in his face, telling him to never show his face around him again. But to his surprise, Draco opened the door to let him in, grabbing his forearm and leading him to the couch.
He groaned into his pillow, cursing himself for being stupid enough to sleep with him while they were still living together.
Draco was enjoying the banter they participated in over dinner, taking sips of his wine that left him feeling looser and more comfortable, the stress from earlier in the evening fading away. It was nice to see Harry bonding with Marie and Oliver, he was concerned when he first offered that he stay that it would be awkward, none of them finding anything in common. He should have known that the Boy Who Lived could get along with nearly anyone, Draco included.
Draco’s mind trailed off to a weekend in September, him and Harry had been watching an endless amount of television, their minds going numb from the stuff. It was Draco that suggested it, assuring Harry that he had the number of a guy on his phone and they could meet him in probably under 30 minutes. Harry wasn’t one to protest, making Draco promise not to tell Hermione or else she would have his head on a stick.
It was Friday in the late afternoon, the weather was grey and gloomy, a perfect scenery for Draco’s depressive slump. Harry was about to get home soon, his shifts at work seemed shorter than usual this week, Draco considered this might have been because of him but he knew better. Although they were friends now, he doubted Harry would go as far as cutting work shifts short for his well being.
He decided against pondering on the subject, he was making himself angry once again just thinking about it. He paid off his bill and exited the club, taking the long and worn out path home. The woods were silent and brisk, with only the occasional hoot of an owl or a tree branch breaking. The pine trees crowded his peripheral vision and he breathed in the cool fresh air, his nostrils expanding.
“Why am I not surprised that this is what you would act like on Christmas?” Harry asked, his mouth pulling upwards into a grin, his body finally complying with getting out of bed.
“Alright, I guess I’ll be the first to break the silence.” Draco said, Harry’s cold stare rested on him.
Draco flopped down next to Nick on the bed, grabbing a towel from the bedside table and passing it to the man next to him.
Sweat began to form on his forehead and Draco took that as his cue to go back to the kitchen, feeling a need to drink more. He left Harry as he danced with Neville, and walked away from the group, grabbing the bottle of Firewhiskey off of the counter and pouring himself a glass.
“I tried the whole auror thing, wasn’t for me, a bit too suffocating to be fighting evil all the time. Why don’t you just quit?”
“That’s the most twisted thing I think I’ve heard you say yet. Do you not hear how backwards that sounds? Bullying me to show me you liked me?” He responded, his mouth slightly agape to show his bafflement.
“We should probably go soon as I don’t have any groceries in the house and I’m quite hungry.” Draco said, his stomach grumbling in response.
Tonight, however, he was determined to prove his own hypothesis wrong. To show himself that Draco had no hold over him, he could still go around sleeping with whoever and not be compelled to remember their hookup.
He knew he shouldn’t victimize himself, he was the one that placed the distance between them in the first place. Despite telling himself that being just friends with Draco would be possible, he found himself unable to hold back from touching him, wanting to feel the blonde’s skin against his. This made it incredibly difficult to maintain any semblance of a platonic relationship in between them, so instead of facing his feelings, he withdrew from him completely. Choosing to do what he knew best; avoid.
Having his three favourite people in the world all together over the span of the holidays was a euphoria for Harry. The days leading up to New Years were all more than perfect, surrounded by joy and mundane bliss as they maneuvered around the Italian cottage with ease. Looking back at it now, where he was sitting outside of the house in the cold, his face stained with his tears, he wished he had taken in those moments and held on to them for longer. Merlin only knows he wouldn’t come across days like those for a long time.
They had decided to go to muggle stores to find the suit for Draco, the wizarding world was great for many things but clothing was sadly not one of them. They had been shopping for what felt like ages, especially considering they were both overheating and getting progressively more irritable. So far nothing had taken Draco’s interest, they were all too mundane or too flashy and he wanted to land in an effortless middle. They made their way into one last store, Draco getting ready to swear off going shopping and just chose some random suit from his closet. The only reason he had chosen to even give this store a chance was because there was a particular suit in the window that seemed like it could be promising. It was a tan colour which Draco felt would compliment him well, he wasn’t one for drastic contrasts. They entered the store and he slipped into a changing room to try on the suit, eager to get the situation over with and to get home as soon as he could. He pulled on the pants, turning around to take a glimpse of how his ass would look in them, the pants hugged him well, accentuating all the right places. He put on the rest of the suit, in awe that he actually found one that gave him exactly what he was looking for, it fit his shoulders perfectly, making him look structured and put together. Draco stepped out of the changing room, doing a tiny twirl for Aaron, smiling from ear to ear.
Nick reached across the bed towards the bedside table, squirting a generous amount of lube into his hand before returning to continue. This time, with the extra slip that the lube gave him, Nick slid his index finger deep into Draco, who’s moans were becoming louder, he was never one to be quiet in the bedroom. He felt more fingers at his entrance, each one stretching him further, his cock leaking with precum.
“You were scared. What a lovely excuse.” Draco couldn’t believe he was giving this conversation the time of day. He thought that he valued himself more than to be with people who cheated on him.
“Oh. No, that’s alright. I don’t really drink anymore.” Draco said, tucking a stray blonde hair behind his ear. He was a grown man, now into his 30s, and Harry still had some sort of giddying effect on him.
Once he arrived at the Ministry, he got some wide-eyed glances, probably just alarmed that an ex death eater was in their presence but Draco has long since dropped that title so the ignorant glances of others didn’t bother him as much anymore. As he approached the door of the office, he felt at ease, sure that this would be just another routine checkup to make sure that he and Harry weren’t killing each other. He was trying to decide if he would mention that they were honestly doing the opposite.
“Woah, you should know better than to apparate while drunk dipshit. Let’s go, we’re walking.” Aaron said as he snatched Draco’s wand from his hand, shoving it into his pocket. Draco grunted in disagreement but knew it was wiser.
Draco slyly stood up from his hiding spot, brushing off his shirt from dust, and giving Harry a warm smile.
“Sorry, I’m just heading out now, I won’t bother you guys.” He called out, making his way to the front door. Feelings of embarrassment all of a sudden rose in Draco, he was kicking Potter out of his own apartment to host friends. If his mother had ever known about this, she would never let him hear the end of it, going on about how disrespectful and ill mannered his behaviour was.
“Why don’t you join us?” Draco asked, switching between looking at Harry and back at the pot on the stove, making sure it didn’t burn.
“Starving. Barely ate today.” he responded. Draco nodded in agreement and stood up from the couch. His hand outstretched to Harry, inviting him to take it. Harry stared at it for a few seconds before clasping his warm hands around Draco’s, allowing him to pull him off of the couch.
He continued to slide closer to Harry, who was now aware of what Draco was doing and was eyeing him with a smirk, taking the last drags of his cigarette before putting it out.
“Hi Draco” A soft voice spoke behind him. He turned around to see Luna, one of the only people who he felt he could get along with at this party. They had gotten friendly in his last year of Hogwarts, she had given him the forgiveness that everyone else refused to grant him. Although it was an unlikely pairing, he was grateful for her company.
Even now, as Harry was walking into his office at work on a Saturday morning, his mind was riddled with images of the man he was desperately trying to avoid. Not even an hour ago he had ensured Draco that this was a one time occurrence, and although Draco looked convinced, Harry was still trying to push down any feelings that shouldn’t be present after a one night stand.
“Yeah, I remember. I’ll be there.” Harry replied, walking off backwards awkwardly and stumbling into a few racks on the way, before turning around and walking out the door of the shop.
“Alright, I think we’ve got everyone in the room, can we all quiet down please” Marvin spoke, his voice echoing through the room. All the hushed side conversations came to an end, and the full attention of the space was focused on Marvin.
“We had… a moment of sorts.” he sighed, meeting Aaron’s eyes for the first time. He continued to explain how he was in a deep depressive episode when Harry came home, leading to both of them getting drunker than necessary and nearly kissed on the balcony. He chose to leave out the part about him jacking off in the shower thinking about Potter, and more specifically while Potter was waiting outside of the door. He figured that would make him seem a little more interested than he actually was. He was just desperate for a shag. That’s all.
Although he had avoided his parents, he had never meant to make his mother feel like he had any vendetta against her, she was a bright presence in his generally morbid life but his fathers occupancy had left his mental health in shambles. And unfortunately, he couldn’t cut off communication with one and not the other. So when he was met by her soft gaze once again, he nearly broke down in tears. He hadn’t realized how deeply he had missed his mother.
“Unfortunately, it is in this exact state that I am able to be the most honest. I can’t be nearly as brave when I’m sober, not to be this honest anyway.”
Sometimes, Draco would rest his hand atop of Harry’s, just for a few seconds, playing it off as a friendly embrace while they laughed. They would have lingering moments like these that always ended too soon, both of them aware of the deeper meaning behind these touches, but neither of them willing to acknowledge it. Draco would stay up thinking about his feelings towards Harry. They weren’t solely romantic or sexual, their bond felt like one that transcended the earthly senses. He would never be able to understand it and would go to bed frustrated at the thought. He liked to think that Harry was in bed attempting to make sense of their relationship himself, that they had a bond that stayed with them even when they were apart.
“I never took you for the breathing exercises type.” said a scruffy voice, Draco opened his eyes, and sure enough, Harry Potter stood in front of him.
They had been on the couch for a while, chatting about mindless topics like Quidditch and what their plans for the rest of the weekend were, both sitting on either ends of the sofa, cuddled into their own corners. Avoiding each other’s bodies in fear of what would happen if they didn’t. Draco was baffled at Harry’s ability to go on with their lives as per usual, their soft bickering returning quickly. It’s not like he expected Harry to suddenly bend down at Draco’s feet, but the nonchalance was making him feel like their hookup really did mean nothing to Harry. That this was something he did often, sleep with his friends then go back to friendly banter the next day.
By the time Marie and Oliver had arrived, Harry and Draco had set the dinner table, finished cooking, and had several bottles of wine aerating and ready to be drank. Draco greeted them warmly at the front door, bringing them both into wide embraces. Harry stood awkwardly behind Draco, looking like a significant other meeting his boyfriend’s parents for the first time. As the night progressed however, he warmed up, beginning to make his usual sly remarks and bonding with Oliver over their positions as aurors.
Dinner was served, accompanied by an implicit undertone of flirtation. A foot riding up Harry’s calf, hiking up his pants slightly. A hand placed casually on Draco’s thigh, sliding itself up higher towards his hip unknowingly.
“I did not have a crush on Draco! Were you not there as we literally despised each other through all of school?” Harry said, feeling himself getting defensive.
If it hadn’t been for Casper, Harry wouldn’t have even given a second thought to staying an auror, but working alongside him had been too rewarding the last few years. They were able to harvest a strong friendship from work, one he hadn’t felt since his school years with Ron and Hermione. The three of them had still remained close, however it was difficult to maintain their relationship with all of them working full time jobs. After they got married, they moved outside of London, drawing their proximity to Harry further. Although they still saw each other at the Ministry, it wasn’t the same as before.
“Draco dear, how are you? You look so handsome in that suit” Marie grinned, inspecting the suit closer, and feeling the texture on her hands.
“Wow. No, I think that covers practically everything.” He replied, still processing the plethora of information that was shot at him.
Draco looked over his shoulder as he saw Harry awkwardly change into the clothes that he had given him, he was swallowed by the sweater and the pants were slightly baggy around his waist. The slight height difference in between the two men was showing itself through the fabric.
The words punctured through his chest like a bullet, what should have been so painfully obvious was now for the first time coming to Draco’s mind. Yet in spite of this rationalization, regardless of him knowing the recklessness that he dove towards Harry with, he couldn’t pull himself away.
“Just brilliant personally, how’s the boy who lived going about his life?” Draco said, hearing the poison in his own voice. Force of habit he supposes. Harry stared into Draco, making him feel so exposed he might as well have been naked in the middle of the street. Harry broke his gaze before responding.
“Can’t say that I have. Although I did try and shag you nearly every time so that’s gotta count for something. But, thinking back to last night, you tried to do the same thing so we’re even once again” Draco wasn’t sure where this newfound openness was coming from but watching as Harry dumped his face in his hands at this, his face turning red while he groaned into his palms, made it worth it.
Harry knew there was a part of him that was lying to himself, afraid to reveal any tiny essence of affection - or even love - for Draco, his stubborn character refusing to give him the satisfaction. And although they had become friends, quiet close friends actually, there was still an underlying sense of competition, as if admitting any feelings for Draco would mean he had lost.
They walked into the apartment, the familiar smell of Harry’s sandalwood cologne slightly fragrant in the air. He’s only been gone for less than 24 hours, this morning being the first he spent at his apartment and he’s already back, it feels more like home than anywhere he’s ever been.
“Look, Draco.. I wanted to talk to you about something, I already mentioned it to Marie and Oliver and they were supportive and I hope that you will be too”
“That’s what was taking you so long to spit out? An apology? You really are an arrogant bastard” Draco joked, shoving Harry lovingly.
Draco opened the balcony door. Summer was drawing to an end and the cool autumn breeze was beginning to creep in during the evening. The scents of his cooking filled the air, the scent lingering through the hallway of the apartment complex. He played music as he cooked, a soft concerto playfully serenading the room. Harry stepped out of his room, noticing Draco in the kitchen,
He would always have love for Harry, but he was sure in his decisions that he had made. He wasn’t a child anymore, he had been broken too many times and his life was now a place of comfort and stability, something that Harry had never offered.
Harry fumbled with the keys, struggling to fit them into the lock. As he entered the apartment, the smell of fresh herbs and vegetables filled his nose, he never came home to the scent of homemade food. After having to cook so often for the Dursleys, it became an activity that Harry could rarely take pleasure in. He stepped into the front hallway, taking off his winter coat and placing down his work bag. He walked into the kitchen to Draco humming along to a song through his headphones, eyes closed, and head lightly nodding along to the rhythm. He must’ve not noticed Harry come in as he stayed swaying and cooking with his eyes closed for several seconds. Harry, feeling calmer and happier from the light buzz of the alcohol, came up behind Draco and patted him on the shoulder, laughing as Draco jumped slightly, letting out a yelp. Harry bent over his knees, barely containing his laughter of a startled Malfoy.
The night unfolded in a way that Draco simply hadn’t expected. While he realized that he and Harry were in the biggest fight they had thus far, he still didn’t think that would mean he would spend most of New Years night alone. He was sitting at the bar of the club, drinking a soda, surprisingly not in the mood to swallow his troubles with alcohol.
“Perfect. Thank you Marvin.” Draco turned his head at the sound of Harry’s voice. He wasn’t sure if he was being polite or if he was genuinely glad to be rid of him.
Draco sat up in the bed, trying to get to the shower but feeling his feet weighed down by bricks, feeling as if he was stuck in his own body unable to move. He sat in silence for a moment, getting up slowly, using his muscles for the first time in hours. He stayed in the shower for longer than necessary, letting the water hit his shoulders and run down his body, eyes closed and head leaning back. Once he finished, he had felt better. Draco knew that a shower was always beneficial in episodes like this but getting himself to actually go was brutally hard. He slowly began to get ready. Blow drying and putting product in his hair, shaving, and slowly starting to get dressed. He went to get his phone off his dresser, in the midst of his day, he had avoided going on his phone entirely, partly because of his physical inability to, but also because he didn’t want to talk to anyone. He opened his phone to several missed texts from Aaron, asking him if he was okay and if he wanted to talk. Although he appreciated the concern, at times like these, he felt that Aaron was overbearing, he didn’t want to talk and didn’t feel like being vulnerable at all really. He decided to leave his phone at home, not answering Aarons texts. He took a final look at himself in the mirror, surprised he was able to get himself so put together after a day of slumming in bed, and apparated to the venue.
“You know, I’ve had my struggles right? Never been that bad. I was a relatively happy child. But recently, those depressive episodes just keep on kicking you know?” Harry was caught off guard. He didn’t take Draco for one to be struggling with similar issues to Harry, that must have been why his room was so unkept. Harry was terrible at consoling people, he felt like he never had the right words to say. He just stayed quiet.
“Hello? Harry?” said Marvin’s voice through a staticy filter of the phone. He never did understand why the Ministry insisted they begin to carry around this muggle device.
They stumbled back and forth as they mumbled slightly incorrect enchantments, resulting in a killer glare from Hermione that made Ron immediately insist they stop the game and go and join the others on the couch.
Just as was promised, they sat on the same couch 30 minutes later, Draco with a joint in hand. They decided on stepping out onto the balcony to smoke, each taking turns breathing in the smoke. He remembered how Harry had lit the joint, it was in the early evening and the sun was golden against his skin, highlighting his cheekbones making him look sharp and angular, accentuated by the sucking motion as he pulled at the smoke. The tint of the sun still kept a warm feel to his face, he probably stared at his face for far too long, Harry was probably aware of this but neither of them said anything. They looked out over his balcony as they smoked, watching the sun cascade onto the stone buildings, creating sharp lights and darks in the skyline. Draco would wonder about how many different lives were being lived and how minuscule he felt, watching couples walk hand in hand, dogs wagging their tails as their owners took them on walks.
“You have no idea” Draco sighed, gulping down the rest of his drink and setting the glass on the floor beside him. He watched Harry, inching over closer to where he was standing. He knew he was far drunker than he was, taking comfort in knowing that even if he did something he would later regret he could always blame it on the alcohol.
By the time they got to the end of their meal they both couldn’t get their hands off each other, constantly touching. Whether it be through their feet connecting or a hand casually placed on the others arm. What would seem as inconspicuous from the outside was their own signals of desire.
“It’s not really all that deep though is it? I mean we only really shagged like a couple times really, and it didn’t really mean anything” Draco couldn’t tell whether to laugh or throw a fit. Did he really feel that way about the situation? He knew that they hadn’t talked about it but he always felt that there was a connection that they shared, he didn’t know until today that it was one sided.
“Oh cmon, I’m only a little bit late, I doubt a couple minutes took that much out of your precious time.” Harry spoke as he giggled to himself lightly, Draco understood now that no matter what half civil conversations they were able to hold before, living with him would be just like being back at Hogwarts all over again.
He was able to admit all of this to himself, able to say that he would beg on his knees for his love if it were ever to be taken away, but yet he still sat here, inches away from the mess of blonde hair reading a book in front of the burning fireplace, and was at a loss for words.
“It got cancelled actually. The client ran out of funding, back to just the regular stuff now.” Aaron responded, thanking the waitress as she set down their lunches in front of them.
Draco nodded in agreement but couldn’t help but feel hurt. He realized he had misread the situation just as he had with Noah a few months before.
“Considering my slight alcohol abuse problem and overall lack of emotional stability, I would say it was often.” Draco said, getting a giggle from Harry in return.
“I’m pretty sure I’m entitled to know why I have to be stuck with bloody Potter for the next month! This is ridiculous!” Draco could feel his fathers temper coming through in him, he should calm himself down before he said anything else that sounded so snobbish.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest, glaring at Harry. "I like you better when you've had more sleep."
, Mr. Potter." She said glancing between them warily. Harry didn't blame her if she was checking for signs of Polyjuice on either of them in that moment.
Sirius didn't even bother to register what Draco said, already pinching the bridge of his nose and closing his eyes as if begging for strength. "The things I could do with that…" He said almost painfully, "If his father hadn't given it to him I'd have taken it for myself. He can do a
Harry said nothing behind him except a small amused huff. The kettle begun to sing, and Draco took it off before it could get too loud and poured steaming water in to two cups.
Draco smirked smugly, twiddling his fork around. “That’s for me to know and for you to find out, I guess.”
He near growled in frustration. "You lot, move." He snapped at them, and they turned to look at him, eyes wide. They hesitated in place, and that only made him more irritated. Something old in him clicked in to place. "
"Off you go, lad." She prompted sweetly, and with another attempt at a smile he climbed up the stairs feeling her gaze on his back. He didn't know what it was he did, but the woman had a intense focus on him he didn't understand.
"Uh, yeah. Essentially. I guess I just saw Ronald and his brothers being cared for so carefreely, and I realised I didn't have that. Mind you, I was a brat-"
"Don't be jealous, Pansy. It doesn't look good on a woman." Draco said mock-seriously, and just managed to dodge the elbow she threw his way. "So violent! What will your husband say?" He laughed.
"Uh…I said you could have some. The croissants? Was it offensive?" He explained cautiously, gesturing to the food between them. And to demonstrate they weren't poisoned or otherwise ill-intended, Draco swiped one up and took a bite. Potter just stared at him intensely, his eyes roving over Draco's face like he was trying to figure something out.
Lancaster was biting a new one into his lips, looking slightly agitated. It was probably just the serum working against him, but he also had a resentful, bitter glint in his eyes that was completely his own.  “Level Two is where they keep the stuff that’s meant to be
Draco worked on cleaning the house in silence the rest of the day, pensive and high-strung as the hours ticked by and Harry had yet to return. He knew that court hearings weren't the shortest engagements, but it didn't chip away at his impatience and apprehension any easier.
After what felt like years, the meal was over and students were being taken to the Hogwarts Express. Ron and his other dorm mates had helped Harry pack his things before he returned to their dormitory, and he smiled gratefully at all of them. It helped that he didn't really have many belongings to begin with, having only acquired a few more chocolate frogs and the miniature Hungarian Horntail from the tournament over the course of the year. It blew a billow of angry flames when he picked it up off his bedside table, finally settling when he pet it on the head with a huff of smoke out of it's nostrils. Harry almost smiled at it when it did, then put it in to his trunk at the very bottom and hoped nothing crushed it. He wasn't quite sure if it was really alive or not.
"Nothing makes me think that." Draco waved him off. "But what are they going to do? Kick me out? I know their Headquarters location
Something lodged itself in his throat, his heart dropping as he thought about the mindset he had had back then.
As much as he'd have liked to shower and collapse in to bed, his father dutifully let him go just before seven in the evening, and so he went for tea with his mother. They'd dueled for hours, Draco having gone in to that ballroom at nine that morning and never leaving except for a quick lunch. Even when he was tired, told his father he was too exhausted to even cast properly, he was just answered with another spell in his face. Damn idiot.
Potter turned to her, “we’ve done nothing, Hermione — I really am Harry, but, uh, it’s complicated,” Potter shot Draco a look.
Draco snarled at Potter and vowed to tear the wings of the faerie-bastard who had imprisoned them in this crazy, twisted world.
And that is the story of how Robards had to floo both Draco and Potter to St. Mungo’s for exacerbated internal bleeding.
“Harry! Draco! Where’ve you both been?!” The man-pig looked Draco and Potter up and down, “the state of your
intelligent man. Throughout a majority of his Hogwarts education he’d come second to only Granger herself (excluding sixth and seventh year, in which his life was consumed by a fucking psychopath.)
“Do you ever hear yourself speak? Of course I want you to be scared of sucking me — I don’t want you to suck me. You just said that you’re
Draco scoffed, “Potter, you uncultured swine — the Granger in this reality doesn’t know what a Twelvie is,”
approached Granger. Granger blushed prettily (for someone so very intelligent, she had truly horrendous taste in men.)
“As I was saying, Potter panicked, began tugging at the cloth and accidentally elbowed someone in the face.”
Draco massaged his temples. He wished, briefly, that this was a nightmare. Then, he glanced surreptitiously at Potter. The Potter in Draco’s nightmares looked
But avoiding people? That wasn’t crass at all. That was an ingenious manipulation of the delicate social spider-web of politics and human relationships. Draco was, much to his pride (and Potter’s occasional fear), quite a competent manipulator.
Granger entered the room with a suspicious look on her face. Draco walked behind her and slammed the door shut, casting a privacy charm and
(To elaborate briefly, ‘dislike’ suggests rather passive antipathy. ‘Despise,’ on the other hand, suggests complete and utter disdain.)
Because he could. (And one of the pillars of Wizarding Britain was the right to free will, damn it.)
Draco watched with satisfaction as all of Potter’s fur-like hair — or perhaps hair-like fur was the more accurate description — fell off his body.
Undies grinned, “we made a bet — the first one to end up in Mungo’s has to give Robards a lap-dance.”
When he's done for the day, he asks to miss Friday's detention in favour of Quidditch keeper tryouts (she ofc says no. nasty bitch)
"Then those you share it with will become Secondary-Keepers. Secondary-Keepers can't share the secret at all, even if they wanted to. It's only you- why are you
"And here I thought you were here for my thrilling conversation." Draco said with a wry smile, eyes scanning his parchment.
"I do remember not seeing you both for a while after that - no, you two actually just disappeared outright after the dance. Merlin, I didn't think it was because you were
"I don't give a damn, Malfoy." Harry shot back, causing something uncomfortable to sift in Draco's chest. "If I'm such a problem - If I piss you off so much, then do something about it! Not like anybody here would give a shit!"
"What's wrong?" Malfoy said, sounding cautious and looking at him as if he may well break. Harry only laughed, although he didn't know why.
"They went to Hogsmeade." Draco answered after he stopped laughing, "I wanted to stay and get some work done."
"No, for God's sake." She said angrily at once, her tone making him look around at her quickly. "If we're going to be working together, it's not going to be like this, so apologise."
Other than that, I thank you for your patience. I'm still trying to figure out the line of what people expectations are and how much of it affects my work ethic (if you can call writing fanfiction such a thing). i find I overthink about every little thing, which I should really work on not doing. I really appreciate everyone that reads this fic and leaves such nice comments (which i do read!! i read every single one of them and sometimes reread them again when I'm feeling down). Forgive me if I don't reply or anything, I don't know the etiquette on ao3. I'm just really shy, unfortunately.
It was outrageous, as only a few people really knew Sirius was an animagus, let alone his exact form. The only way the information could have been passed on was through Pettigrew, who had undoubtedly spilt the beans to the other side, but as far as anyone knew, he wasn’t there that day. The harrowing thought that it had been Draco’s own father, being the only other known Death Eater by the Order at the station that day, to recognise Sirius settled uncomfortably into the forefront of his mind the rest of his breakfast, rendering him unable to finish his plate of food and gain a few odd looks from his friends.
He felt a stab of anger when he saw a group of Ravenclaws hurry to form a tighter group when they saw him, as though frightened he might attack stragglers. Shrugging it off with an irritated sigh, he made his way to the Gryffindor table, turning his head to look at the Slytherins. He still hadn’t had a chance to speak to Draco yet, but it seemed the boy wasn’t sitting with his friends like usual. Harry frowned at the empty seat between Parkinson and Blase, but looked away quickly when he spotted the latter smirking at him, as if he knew something Harry didn’t. Creep.
The idea of using a 'spot' in dueling was another outdated, traditional technique. It was done by having your eyes fixed on the middle of the target, and allowing your focus to blur just slightly so you could take in information from you periphery as well as your normal line of sight.
And Draco knew he had maybe said too much. He thought he should keep some of the stuff Potter told him a secret. For some reason, they felt extremely fragile and important. He decided not to tell Blaise about the piece of the Dark Lord's soul in the diary.
"Someone needs a nap." Draco muttered, just loud enough for Harry to hear. Without waiting for a reaction, he threw the napkin on his lap on to the table and took their empty plates to the sink. Making sure not to spare a backwards glance, he left the room. After waiting a moment, he popped his head back in to the kitchen with a frown.
"A Malfoy has no time for a heart." His father would say to him in contrast. He'd once found Draco crying about something he couldn't recall anymore, and his father had crouched next to him, taking him the by the shoulders and continuing icily, "In time, the absence of it will be replaced with iron-will." He leant in, cold blue eyes like a splash of cold water over Draco's body, "Now
"He told me things…about my father." Draco studied the lines on his palms, deliberately trying not to look at Blaise's face. "Things I didn't know before."
A roaring flame of indignation raged inside of him. Without thinking further, he pushed himself off his chair, making it screech loudly in the quieted Library. A few feet away, Madam Pince shot them a sharp, warning glare.
"They all learned to become Animagi because of…something - unregistered, of course. Pettigrew's Animagus form was a rat, and he'd spent the years as - and please know I'm telling the truth - Ron's pet rat Scabbers."
Soon, the feast began to come to a close and it was time for students to return to their dormitories for the evening.
Walking up the familiar path, he blinked out the light from his wand and let his eyes adjust to the darkness. Luckily for him, Draco was paler than fresh parchment and was easy to pick out. Harry snickered to himself at the thought.
Slumping back on to his bed, he faced the side-table and stared his wand. His arm lay outstretched next to him, hanging off the bed as if beckoning it towards him. He sighed deeply, and his heart rate slowed marginally.
"Why not the Weasleys?" Draco couldn't believe he would be vouching for them to the Headmaster in his lifetime. "I'm sure they can protect him."
Umbridge nodded dumbly and Harry felt as if he were the teacher and now she was the student. It fulfilled some part deep inside himself that fed on the control. He wondered where it came from...
“Oh-” Harry started to apologise, slightly hoping it wasn’t Cho again, when he looked up and saw Seamus looking at him, eyes wide.
Harry turned around to face him, dropping Draco's hand back to his side and his eyes suddenly alight with curiosity as he looked up at Draco.
It was a large atrium, not unlike the one on the main floor of the Ministry. They seemed to be on some sort of balcony, and reaching the railings they both gasped at the large expanse of magically moving shelves and sections throughout the hall below them. There were rows and rows of the shelves, some moving and shifting around as new items were sectioned in and others were levitated out. It seemed that the Ministry had foregone as much physical manpower for these floors particularly, as he saw almost no one else in the room.
Unfortunately, the day passed quickly and Harry’s nausea never let up. He’d never hated himself more, apart from the time after Cedric’s death. Throughout the day, he would be struck with the momentary incredulous realisations that
There was also the news about the Ministry break-in, which had looked insignificant at first before he’d received a letter from Hermione detailing how Sturgis Podmore, the man caught breaking in, was the same man who had missed escort duty for Harry the day the Hogwarts Express had departed from King’s Cross.
"Is that a proper goodbye for you?" Draco's voice sounded beside him. Harry rubbed his side with a huff and saw a layer of the room peel back as Draco's head revealed itself. The git still looked tiffed off, but Harry could spot a small twitch in the corner of his mouth.
Draco quite honestly didn't know what the appropriate response to such a blunt statement was. He decided to settle for a slight smirk and smug tone as he said, "That's very good to hear."
Harry sighed, rubbing a hand over his face and displacing his glasses in the process. "I…yeah, I think. I'm done yelling."
“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?” said Dean. “If we’re going to be attacked, it won’t be risk-free-”
" Sirius objected warningly. "Remember what I said earlier." He hissed, immediately making Draco's eyes retract their venom slightly. Harry looked between the two, sensing some sort of unspoken agreement he wasn't apart of. He didn't press it further, just glad it got Draco off his back.
Harry readjusted his position then took a deep breath. He looked at Draco, "Remember Sirius Black?" He asked as if he were asking about the weather.
“Right…” Harry stared at his friend a moment longer before looking away. It wasn’t something he had the energy to think too much about at the moment, so he let it go.
"Is that why you're being moody, then?" Pansy asked incredulously. She gave Blaise a knowing look which he returned, "Should have known."
The Phoenix began to shiver slightly, its red feathers fading into grey and now falling in even quicker successions. Its skin was sunken and its bones were collapsing into itself as if it would simply disappear into thin air.
"I'm just worried it may come back to bite either of you." Hermione said, her voice hoarse as if she might begin crying, but Harry could see her eyes were dry. "There is never getting around these things."
At five o’clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge’s office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, was told to enter and did so. The blank parchment lay ready for him on the lace-covered table, the pointed black-maroon quill beside it.
“Problem, Malfoy?” Harry called out, glancing furtively between him and the girl, who Draco could now recognise as the Ravenclaw seeker from the year before, Cho Chang. He also remembered her and Cedric being involved, which must have been utterly dreadful for her when he’d been killed.
The voice raised some more as if coming closer to them, and the door swung open on it's hinges loudly. In sight was now Draco, one hand on the door handle while his body was still turned to the other gaping occupants of the room.
"How are you?" Harry asked, still sitting propped up on an elbow. Draco snorted, eyes crinkling as he smiled.
At that moment, pain seared through him, not through his head but through the scar on his forehead. At the same time, he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff. He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at her.
After freshening himself up in a terrifying bathroom and changing his clothes in to something more warm (It seemed like it was impossible to get rid of the cold in Grimmauld place, similar to the Manor), he made his way quietly downstairs to the kitchen.
"Come on! Just for a little! I've missed it." Draco was saying, already sliding the compartment door open.
From time to time, only ever in a maximum of intervals of at least a few months, Draco would become obsessed with something. Some lasted longer than others, but he would find an idea or a thing or even a person, and latch onto it in every corner and crevice of his mind.
Draco glanced at Harry, who still looked at ease. "Just wanted to help you make breakfast, Mrs. Weasley." Harry said politely, getting up and brushing off his trousers. Draco looked back at her and saw her face break in to a warm smile.
"Albus Dumbledore says that the Dark Lord has returned." He tried to make his tone hopeful, nonchalant. "And it was him who killed Diggory."
"Find another fucking spot, already. Your presence is annoying and bad for quality sleep." Draco called out to Harry, the dredges of sleep claiming him quickly. He blamed it on the easy warmth that settled around the late-afternoon weather.
Immediately, thoughts of the Ball sent his stomach down to his feet as a steadily rising anxiety churned in his chest. Harry was used to fucking up, but usually the end result was dying, or torture. He would have gladly taken death or torture at this moment. He squeezed his eyes shut.
Potter laughed more strongly this time, "Exactly what I thought. That's why I haven't tried yet. He might just be trying to make a fool of me."
“Cool.” Harry nodded, the both of them lapsing into silence while still staring out the window. “Is she the one that sends you all those sweets?”
"The Order needs you to keep an eye on Dolores as she keeps an eye on us - or should I say me. You're a model student, both academically and through her eyes. Work closely with her, and find out whatever's important throughout the year."
His neck felt awfully exposed, and he shut his eyes in anticipation of any sudden movement. Something in his chest burned at the position he was in. It was embarrassing. Malfoys didn't bow like that. It felt wrong. Vulnerable.
Draco immediately turned his body to block the minor jinx his father sent his away. It bounced off just in time, and his father nodded approvingly.
"Er, yeah, Professor. He's with me." Harry said, trying to look as if it was the most normal thing in the world. McGonagall's eyes widened at the two of them for a moment before she spoke,
Harry set down the parchment slowly. The sounds of singing birds outside finally registered in his mind, having been absorbed completely in the letter.
"You are dismissed for the day." His father said, and Draco held his sigh of relief in until he left the room with the door closed behind him.
He quickly took the time to grab his glasses and put them on, before pounding footsteps suddenly sounded on the thin floorboards outside his door. They were coming from- Shit. Uncle Vernon's room. The stag immediately blinked out, and the room was dark once again.
Umbridge’s nostrils flared, eyes flicking to his hand. Upon the sight of the ugly scarring, her eyes widened harshly.
"I know. It's all just extremely suspicious. Do you think this has to do with all the possible Death Eater plots?" He looked at Harry suddenly. "Do you think it was you who was meant to be attacked instead?"
"Well, well. Didn't see this coming." He said with a wry grin. Within a moment, the two popped out of sight and reappeared next to Draco, inciting an embarrassing yelp from him.
Harry thought for a moment, remembering first year, then his recurrent dreams, even his scar hurting time to time.
Harry shot him a questioning look, and Ron reiterated, “She looked like she wanted to talk to you alone….Do you like her?”
"Because you're my best mate, and I know you, Harry." Ron nudged him with a shoulder playfully, "And you seem better after you talk to him. Even before the task, when you were close to murder over every bloody little thing, sometimes you'd come back from a 'walk' less twitchy and riled up. I don't notice a lot, but I know that was because of him." He scrunched up his nose distastefully, "I won't pretend I understand it, but if it works for you, it works for me."
"Nothing, Viktor." She said curtly without taking her glare off Harry. "As soon as this dance is over, Harry Potter, you will
Dean was sitting on the arm of Seamus's chair and Harry decided to spectate Seamus's failure since he missed it the last few times. He got up and sidled on to the arm next to Ron, whom barely acknowledged him as he ordered a castle across the board and smashed a bishop in to small ceramic pieces that almost went flying into Harry's eyes. He was instantly thrown back to First Year, but put away the thought immediately.
Harry nodded even though Malfoy wouldn't have been able to see it. It was more to himself than anything.
Harry doodled a bit on a hangman drawing from a previous round, thinking for a moment. “She was with Cedric…” He muttered. “Bit weird now, innit?”
In the mirror, his eyes, the one’s that matched his mother’s and one of the only things he really had left of her, turned from green to a deep and bloody crimson.
Lancaster, for the first time that morning, seemed to realise that the information he was giving them was a bit overboard. “Well…” he trailed off, eyebrows falling.
"You'll be back." Draco said slowly, getting up as well and trying his best to fold the Cloak as best one folding invisible material could.
Harry blew out the flame and the room was spelled in to darkness. He just barely touched the doorknob before his very eyes, the long corridor he'd been dreaming about constantly appeared in his vision. His scar flared with pain, and he cried out.
Malfoy took a step back and whipped his body to the Lake. Harry calmed his breathing, his pulse going rapid-fire around his body. The only sounds were the lapping of the water and the heavy breathing from both boys. Malfoy looked angry, and even a bit lost.
"See you then, Malfoy"  As soon as Harry turned his back to Malfoy, a look of complete pain ran across his face.
"What's that spell you keep using?" Draco pushed himself up to stand, wincing as he felt his knee crack with a twinge of pain on his way. "The one you just used."
Malfoy grew a wry smile over his face, staring off somewhere in to the horizon. The act threw Harry off balance for a moment, and put him back over that same bone-chillingly icy Lake as during the Yule Ball.  He shook himself out of it quickly, an involuntary shudder running through him. Luckily, Malfoy didn't seem to notice.
“He’s only in charge of Level Two and that’s it,” Lancaster explained, put out. “I’m the Head of this department, and yet he’s completely set aside with Level Two…”
From the look on Sirius's face at Dumbledore's name, Harry could tell the man wasn't very pleased with the Headmaster, and he felt a surge of affection for his Godfather for it.
"It's just…I'm…" Draco went on, not knowing how to explain his apprehension. "Anything could happen tomorrow." He kept his eyes on the Lake.
"I'd rather hold hands with a bunch of thorny rose stems." Draco bowed once more the Buckbeak, then turned away to start towards the door.
Potter put a lid on his snorting and said, "I did help him for the first task, so it's only really fair if you look at it." He smiled lazily, and Draco felt something in him jump that the boy seemed alright again.
“No thanks.” Draco said quickly, memories of the ferret incident rousing from the depths of his mind.
Before he knew it, he was walking up to the teacher's stand itself, hands clenched at his sides and breath coming unevenly.
“Exactly.” Dumbledore smiled slightly, “She is nothing without the Ministry. On her own, I believe she poses little threat to the school and the students.”
"I'm not sure." Harry said honestly, "I have a head start along with Cedric, but everyone there's tough competition, you know? And they're older than me."
Harry looked at him, eyes wide with worry. His hair was thick and wild, as always, and his t-shirt seemed a size much bigger than him that it almost could have hung off one shoulder.
Harry enters and usual shitty Umbridge tactics ensue. She gives him the quill and makes him do lines with it.
"And outside of this group, no one will know about this Vow." Remus said to everyone, tone grave. "You haven't told the Order, right?'
“I wonder how Defense will be.” Hermione mused as they all walked to their first lesson. People seemed to be veering around them at an equal radius on all sides, which Harry just took as a blessing in the busy halls leading to class.
"I swear it was a cursed object." Draco said defensively to Ron as soon as they passed it. "I must have been put under some sort of cursed…sleep!"
He settled in to eat, blocking out the murmurings of his house around him. It worked for a while, before the voice of the very bane of his existence (besides Potter) began to speak.
"I had a go at him too, when we first spoke. You're not in the wrong for saying what you wanted to. Not after what he's done in the past."
He watched his father get in to the stance as well, then moved his eyes to the same spot on the other man's robes. In the corner of his vision, he saw quick, sharp arc of his father casting a spell, and immediately braced himself.
"Yes, and I trust I was told the truth?" Draco said, wiping his face roughly to rid himself of the probably tear stains.
The morning of his final detention, Harry unwrapped the bandage Ron had applied for him to see that, just like the day before, the wounds shaped in the blasted line he had to keep writing were now completely healed. It seemed that while not efficiently, the residual healing magic instilled in the quill still lingered and worked to close up the cuts overnight.
"Hermione!" Draco called out to the girl, whom was stood at the back off the room, leant against the wall in the shadows with her arms crossed pensively. "Stop them! It's insane!"
"Splendid." Dumbledore checked his watch. "My, a little late aren't we?" The old man got up and nodded at Snape. "See you next week, Severus. When is little Draco due back?"
What was interesting, however, was that people indeed seemed to scorn Harry for whatever reason that applied. The Daily Prophet had really dug its heels into the story about him and Dumbledore over the summer, and the fruits of that labour were being consumed wholefully now as whispers rippled through the students almost the entire meal, almost as if at Harry’s every movement. Draco had heard bits here and there as he ate, dutifully keeping his head down in his plate of food and eavesdropping.
The volume in the room had decreased as everyone focused on their potions respectively. Harry added some of the remaining ingredients, hoping they didn't blow up the whole Potion.
And Harry begun to excitedly explain the egg starting to sing underneath the water, how it was probably the voices of merpeople underneath the Lake and reciting what it had said.
"Dumbledore never really specified what made it so, but he did say that he explicitly trusted you, and at some point after Harry was captured and escaped on the night of the final task, you'd saved his life."
He closed the window, and climbed in to bed feeling both lifted and added of a weight on his chest that followed him in to sleep.
he said back to the voice. He almost even believed it. The voice replied with something that he blocked out immediately, making it nothing more than a muffled string of words that as much as he rejected with his every being, sent fear running through him all the way to his bones.
"Harry and I noticed that except for the other Bill and Arthur Weasley, extremely trusted members, there were no Ministry employees inside that room." suggested Hermione.
Blaise nodded, still gazing out at the archives. “Low-class files. Things open to any member of the Ministry and any civilian with the proper permission.”
Hermione rolled her eyes at Ron and ignored him, "I was wondering how you managed to do that, Harry. You were never good at cutting charms."
"Alright. Sorry." And after a few moments, "I had asked Cho to the Ball before…well you, I suppose."
Pulling on his uniform so he wouldn't have to come back and change, he crept out past his sleeping dorm mates with his bag slung over his shoulder. He left through the Common Room, where he was pretty sure he spooked three different house elves whom were dusting the furniture inside on the way out. One of them looked vaguely familiar somehow, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it. It didn't matter though, because the elf disapparated with a yelp as soon as it saw Draco. Weird creatures, they were.
But Harry wasn't listening. He felt a small uncomfortable niggle of shame in the pit of his stomach.
"You look different." Dean said, narrowing his eyes. Harry cringed, but that didn't stop attention being drawn to him immediately.
"See you." Draco said, inspecting a broken nub on one of his quills as Harry turned away. Harry threw up a wave without looking back and disappeared across the grounds.
“Could it have something to do with that thing that Remus and Sirius talked about, then? The weapon?”
“The Ministry?” Umbridge asked. She was near hovering over her desk by how much she was leaning forward to hear him speak. She was hooked on his words now. Good.
The next day, he was let out of the Hospital Wing. The entire school was due to go back home as well, so the timing was infuriatingly perfect in that he was forced to sit through the final meal in the Great Hall with everyone else before embarking that afternoon.
That night, he hurriedly entered his room after sneaking in to the house and threw his trunk open. He rustled through it, sifting through textbooks and scrap pieces of used parchment, even the still very much alive Hungarian Horntail, until he found a blank parchment and quill.
Draco stopped moving and hoped Blaise would think he fell back to sleep, but the bastard went on, "But, by Merlin, that boy in his robes! Who knew Potter was so fit?" He asked incredulously. "I almost wished it was his hand on
Immediately, all the Weasley children started awkwardly clearing their throats at once, turning their heads away as Hermione laughed at them. The smile dropped from Draco's face, and he collapsed in to his arms again. Bloody Weasley's.
He heard a muttered spell from Malfoy and braced for the worst, squeezing his eyes shut. After a moment of nothing happening, Harry opened them, feeling something falling from the top of his head.
Draco swore under his breath, "Fuck. I'm fine, Potter's fine. We're all fine! Nothing wrong with us! And he's not a loon, Pansy. You'd know if you could recognise genuine journalism for once." He spat.
Draco nodded matter-of-factly, "He works there, or throws Gold at them time to time. I always mix it up. Think it’s the same thing."
"Not at all. It was just convenient for me to stay where I was." His voice sounded misdirected, as if he hadn't turned around to face Harry.
"Shit." Draco muttered, going up to the door and trying to unlock it with his wand to no avail. It must have been a dark arts spell. He was locked in.
They all continued with their respective tasks in silence, until he heard Ron ask Draco, "When do you leave again?"
“Witherby. He could have been the one referred to because he’d let my father have those files - off the record. There might not have been a sender address because they didn’t want to get traced back to referring to some clerk who let Lucius Malfoy into the Magical Archives in case he was caught.”
The Purebloods and their children. Most of them might even be sympathisers for Voldemort's cause. Not just some, Draco thought, glancing at them. Probably all.
Draco opened the door to reveal an impatient Snape waiting for him, tapping his foot on the floor. The man barely waited a moment before spinning on his heel and marching back down the steps of Grimmauld place. Remus flashed him a wince, and Draco returned it. Levitating his trunk, he made to follow Snape before the man left without him.
McGonagall summoned the letter from Harry’s hand, sitting back in her desk chair while Draco and Harry took the seats across from her. She deftly opened it and began to read. Draco took the time to look around the office, noting it was comfortable and covered in fabric surfaces of any kind. He wondered if she had a cat or some other pet, as much of the fabrics seemed to be scratched up.
"Don't move. You're hurt." Harry whispered to him. Draco's head looked up, eyes shining on his tear streaked face.
Warmth flashed in her eyes, and her grip finally loosened. He dropped his arm to his side quickly, resisting the urge to rub the sore area where her fingers dug in. She smiled at him, but it didn't match the upper part of her face where her eyes still looked hesitant, like a caged animal eyeing an open door.
were flipped through front and back. Library sections from A to H were confirmed to be completely useless in the Potions, Charms and Transfigurations sides of the Library.
Hermione pushed them into Binns’ class, and he lost the train of thought. Harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye.
"Like Severus here." He said, gesturing to Snape next to him. "I understand you also have some doubts about his loyalty, but I can assure you they are well placed. Please put your trust in him from now on if you need anything." He turned to Snape, completely ignoring Draco's incoherent sputters of disagreement, "Severus, I'm sure you can look after the boy if necessary?" Snape nodded, and Dumbledore continued, "And if any emergency or need shall arise, the address is number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London."
He slipped out of the compartment, looking down both ways and was relieved to see no on there. He then begun to stalk down to one side where he knew the Slytherins sat. Trying his best not to look too ominous, he glanced in to each compartment as he passed, earning himself more than a few scathing looks.
"You will wake him, Draco." Snape said finally, glancing to the side where Harry was. "I mean absolutely no harm to Potter, let alone you. Just calm yourself. I am no threat. I was with Dumbledore at the time, as a pledge to my allegiance to his side." He explained, and Draco noticed the bandages wrapped around his left arm, now visible with his sleeves hitched up. "And understand I am deeply sorry for what transpired after I left you-"
"I made sure to have the elves pack you extra of everything, and slipped in some calming draughts, because I know you fret during exams-"
"No unfortunately, no hexing." Draco said leaning back against his headboard. He sat thoughtfully for a moment, thinking about the evening before and trying to remember what happened before him and Potter parted ways and went to their respective dorms. They had danced, Draco remembered bitterly, then they went outside at Potter's request - but why had Draco trusted himself to be led outside like a bloody fool? He could have been attacked! Or hexed! Or seriously maimed!
"The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. Welcome." Sirius said, spreading his arms out in fake grandeur.
Both Harry and Ron ushered her upstairs quickly, leaving to their own dorms in an embarrassed silence. Even before blowing out the candles next to their beds, Harry could still spot the flush on his best friend’s face as he climbed into bed.
"IT WAS ME WHO SAW HIM! ME WHO FOUGHT HIM! I'M THE ONE WHO'S BLOOD HE TOOK. I HAVE THE SCARS. HE'S HERE BECAUSE OF ME!"
." He shook his head ruefully. "Because otherwise they'd end up like me right now. I'm sorry." He said, not looking at Malfoy.
"You would know about that, wouldn't you Harry." Ron said, clearly establishing whose side he was on.
"What did you say?" Potter said next to him. It sounded almost accusing, and Draco wondered what on earth he could have said that could have offended the boy. He looked at Potter, who quite honestly looked no better than the day before.
His stomach turned in on itself again as he stared down at his plate of food. He really did want to eat it but feared he might just end up throwing it up right after anyway. Hermione spared him some analytical glances throughout the meal over her knitting needles. Luckily, Ron also seemed to be snoozing into a plate of eggs, so her attention was divided.
to the Yule Ball. Knowing Potter, his Gryffindor idiocy probably made him take the stupidest, most brash option as a means to achieve something. At the moment, Draco had no idea what the boy was planning to do except possibly just try to gain control over the situation. Yes, that was it. Potter wanted control. He wanted to
He heard a snort from where Draco was. He didn't look, but something warm settled in his stomach at the sound.
"D'you want to fly with her?" Harry said softly, and Draco barely registered what he'd said as he stared at him.
these days, don’t you think?” Her tone dropped almost comically low and menacing at the mention of external influences, almost as if the very thought caused her discomfort.
Malfoy cocked his head to the side at Harry, a bit of heat in his gaze, "How would you know?" He asked accusingly.
“So that’s it?” Harry asked, feeling slightly put out, “It’s just a few notes about your father not being able to get something. Not only do we not know what he wanted, but Umbridge knows about it too, now.”
"I'll die of the Cruciatus before I recognise his breed as mine." Draco sneered, sounding nasally as if he'd been crying. What had happened while he'd been gone? Why was Draco even here?
"Nothing good will come about if you die before you kill You-know-who." He muttered after a pause, resting his chin on his arms.
Quidditch practise went swimmingly for Draco and the other Slytherins that afternoon, and they were indeed packed and off the pitch by the time Harry, Ron and the rest of his Gryffindors arrived for their practice.
“Morning, Harry.” Hermione greeted when they got to the Gryffindor Table. She glanced at Ron and the boy stiffened for a moment before she added appraisingly, “Ron.” It seemed that she was still slightly vexed at him for the day earlier. Ron deflated, and he sat down next to Harry so they were both facing her.
Harry stood at a window on the wall opposite the door, looking how with his hands stuffed in his pockets. Hearing Draco step in and close the door, he looked over his eyebrows furrowed and the same pissed off expression he'd had earlier.
After a moment, a flicker of something flashed in his mother's eyes. He might have thought it was something like recognition if it wasn't masked so quickly. Fear begun to coil in his stomach at the thought of what she might be seeing on his face. His parents, for obvious reasons, had not been informed of fake-Moody's attack on him or his involvement at all in the events of the Triwizard Finals. His sudden absence that night and the following morning were explained as a sudden stomach bug, landing him in the hospital wing. When so was told to Pansy and Blaise, however, neither looked very convinced.
He checked his watch, a cracked, faded thing he'd found under the bed in Dudley's second bedroom in Second Year.
Harry wakes up revved up to think of something to help get Umbridge off of Draco's ass so he can actually do his job. Despite wracking his brain, he can't find anything and feels useless and shitty.
Harry shrugged. "I'm in a good mood." He said with a small wink, before turning to Ronald to ask him something, the two walking away to talk to the rest of the rejoicing Weasley children, all of whom were chanting "He got off! He got off! He got off!" to the very frustration of Molly. All that was left was Hermione, who had a curious eyebrow raised at him. He didn't like the look she was giving him. At all.
Harry walked to where the rest of the champions were gathered, all being hugged and gushed over by their families. Amos Diggory nodded at him briefly as he spoke to Cedric, a comforting hand on his son's shoulder.
There was a chorus of gasps around the room, Slytherin side included. Draco was even stunned, as it was the first time he’d heard Harry verbally acknowledge Cedric’s death at all since it had happened. He itched to race out of his chair and shake Harry out of his rage. The boy definitely wasn’t doing himself any favours, especially to someone like Umbridge, who Draco still had no idea was capable of.
"-or he's feeding everyone different information, and seeing what gets to the Ministry." Draco said, realisation dawning on him. "But if that's true-"
“These are only my suspicions, but I fear there may be a connection between Harry and Lord Voldemort. Either emotional or magical. I’m not sure.”
The summer before Fourth Year, Draco's father was much busier than usual, so he rarely saw him. His mother left him alone mostly, so he was left to his own devices to hang around the Manor grounds by himself as the days passed. It should have been lonely, but it didn't feel like it. He would often go deep in to the woods at the very edge of the grounds, just exploring because he'd never done it before and realised no one was there who could stop him. He would pace with even steps through the woods, counting different species of potions ingredients he saw on the way on his fingers and stopping only when he reached ten, then starting again. It was incredibly peaceful, and he would often be out there from morning after breakfast, until dusk when a House Elf would summon him. It gave him a lot of time to think for himself, and something deep in his chest cracked in to place just slightly during that summer beneath the July sun.
Umbridge gaped at him before taking his hand. He was too busy to savour her expression because he was focused within, remembering the time during summer holiday, back in the Dursleys house. The rev of energy, the prickle of magic through his arm...God, he really hoped he didn't mess it up….
, let alone aloud." Draco snapped. "I wasn't calling you the wanker, but now I'm reconsidering." He reached to put another weird book in the
It wasn't before a tall, dark-skinned boy walked in whistling and caught him with tears on his face did he manage to compose himself. He didn't look quite as phased as he should have been to see someone like Draco crying to themselves in the bathroom, but since he was also starting Hogwarts that day and needed to make a good impression, he offered Draco his friendship in that very bathroom (Draco willingly accepted despite the tear stains on his face that he'd desperately tried to wipe away moments before). Draco never really revealed why he had been crying in the bathroom to the boy, whom introduced himself as Blaise Zabini, but was pretty sure Blaise had figured it out eventually to his own amusement.
Harry swallowed, the way Malfoy's voice sounded almost unrecognisable, and clattered around with alarm bells in his head. It felt wrong, but also right.
Granger narrowed her eyes then took a deep breath, collecting herself. "I wanted to apologise for shouting at you earlier."
"Where's Ginny when you need her." George muttered, but silenced when Mrs. Weasley scowled at him. The two gave each other wry smiles, then whipped out their wands to start levitating food as Mrs. Weasley busied herself with the remaining food.
"Yes." Draco threw his mind back to what it said about the spell in the book he had found it in, "A Fidelius Charm is an extremely difficult, multifaceted and potent charm that can be used to conceal a secret inside an individual's soul." Harry's eyebrows drew up in surprise, and Draco continued, "The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find — unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it."
"Right." Draco fumbled with the Cloak, trying his best to fold it despite it's…invisibility. "Sorry again. Here." He handed it to Harry with both hands, eyes averted. Harry took it from him, slinging a bit over his shoulder.
She gasped, as if cooing over a baby’s first words. “My! How polite! Just like when you were a little one. Such a little
His father was trying to access something beneath Level 2 as well, he vaguely remembered. This was a good opening for him, it seemed. Lancaster had looked a little spineless; it wouldn’t take much for Draco to get him to agree to something-
He cringed internally, hoping the woman wouldn’t pay his vague statement any mind. To his surprise, however, she only looked more pleased.
Just then, Snape cried out and clutched his left arm to his chest. Draco stepped forward but Snape turned his body away from him. The man hissed through his teeth, pulling up his left sleeve but obscuring his arm from view just before Draco could see. He stood there with his back to him, breathing heavily. Slowly, Snape's head looked up from his arm.
"Er…Yes, sir." Draco was confused; He thought his father knew all of this already. He barely managed to not roll his eyes.
“We’ll be seeing you later, then, ma’am.” Draco bowed slightly, trying to lay it on thick which indeed earned him a gasp. “And if there is anything you need assistance with, for whatever reason, please don’t hesitate to ask either myself or Pansy.”
.” Draco hissed as he spotted some of the people around them giving the three some curious looks. “You’ll start rumours about me!”
"Then why am I here?" Harry said hotly, his patience wearing thin. He felt the last of his fraying nerves burn out from the whole day, his body almost entirely wrung with tension. He started to get up.
"You've grown taller." His mother remarked beside him with a polite yet curt tone. He felt himself stiffen even more, and that just made his heart race even faster.
Harry stared down at his palms in his lap, focusing on them rather than the turmoil of emotions in his head. “I don’t know.” He said so quietly, it could have been a whisper. “I probably proved them right. I am a nutcase.”
Draco leaned back, nodding firmly. "I will, but I don't think he needs more people to watch him more than to just listen to what he was to say when he needs to say it. But still, I'll do my best."
“What’s with the broom?” Harry asked swiftly, changing the subject. He glanced over to the Cleansweep in the corner.
"Don’t worry,” Sirius said. Harry looked up and realized that Sirius had been watching him closely. “I’m sure they’re going to clear you, there’s definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life.”
His father disappeared in to a room nearby, as if unaware that Draco were about to depart to King's Cross an they were about to be horrendously late. Draco knew he knew, but why he continued to act otherwise was apart of the mass enigma that was his father. Bloody dramatic.
Malfoy caught his look and glared, "One word of this outside this conversation and I'll set Lolligo on you."
"Wha - I - What do you mean…I mean there's nothing wrong with Cedric. And me. There's nothing wrong with me and Cedric-"
“Like about Dumbledore and I being crazy? Being liars?” Harry couldn’t stop his voice from growing in intensity, his fists clenching at his sides. He broke out into a cold sweat, breath starting to come out fast. He was sick of it; sick of being singled out like this all the time. Being stared at and having judgement passed on him without having any say in it by people who didn’t even know him-
"You want to put that to test? I can tell him to say hello during the Task tomorrow!" Malfoy yelled. At the mention of the task, Harry felt his face crumple in to his hands. He tried to push down the broiling emotions that steeped all the way to his gut, but for some reason his mind didn't allow such things by the Lake. It would have been easier if he was in the Great Hall, around other people, or while talking to Ron and Hermione when it was so easy to push down his feelings for them. Now, he felt awfully bare and it made him draw up his knees and bow his head between them and his chest. The small ensconced space was dark, but it felt safe. There was silence for a long time after that. Neither boy said anything.
"She called the Order, and they brought me here." He could hear Harry speaking through gritted teeth. "That's all it took. They had eyes on me the whole time-"
Not only that, but Podmore had been allegedly trying to break into a ‘top security door’, which scarily aligned very well with Draco’s own tormenting thoughts. The fact only spurred him on more, which made him wonder if this is what went through Harry’s head before every decision he made. It’s what finally led him, two weeks later on a Friday morning, to be waiting in Snape’s office for a Portkey to the Ministry.
Harry shrugged again, trying to come off as casual, “I’ll ask her at detention tomorrow. Maybe I can do an extra few days so I can miss Friday’s. Angelina will have my head if I don’t-”
He got his answer when Umbridge widened her eyes as big as the plates mounted on her wall. Her breathing hitched and she seemed to hold it. He let the spell maintain for a moment, burning his gaze into hers as her hand weakened in his. He kept their grip, then after another second, whispered
"He should have killed you." Moody said, "But never mind that now. I will finish to task my Lord sought out to complete." He pointed his wand at Harry, hand shaking in anger.
“Yeah, no problem,” said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him. “Take her!”
Draco stared at him for a few moments more before nodding silently and leaving, the compartment door sliding until it was shut. Harry gathered up his Cloak and draped it around himself, stepping out a few minutes after Draco and breezing his way down the hall.
"Right. We can expect some sort of dark magic to make him stronger. For now, what that ritual is, who's in charge of it and when it's going to happen is unknown. I don't think my father's involved, so it will be difficult to know for sure."
He nodded without thinking about it, and she smiled politely again. His movements feeling sluggish, he gestured for her to walk first in to the house. His mind buzzed when the idea of walking in to his father's office caught up with him.
“Oh, but not with our system.” Lancaster took his tea and blew into it a bit before taking a considerable sip. “We’ve perfected our ways of discerning and confirming the location of every unit in our care.”
"Professor Dumbledore. I need-" But it was difficult to say anything when he was trying to get past Snape.
?" Sirius had roared upon the news, "That man is a Death Eater, Harry, and I bet my life his son will be just like him! Now is not the time to be…
"And this is Headquarters?" Draco asked distastefully, and Granger nodded grimly. "Merlin." He muttered.
"George! Fred!" Molly barked from where she was holding out a bag for the rest to drop incapacitated Doxies in to, "Get to work!"
“Sorry.” Harry chuckled, not sounding very sorry at all. He had his arms crossed over his chest, hands tucked underneath each other casually. “Sending something?”
It seemed that he wasn’t the only one with the idea to send an early morning post, as when he arrived at the Owlery, sunlight now well streaming through the glassless windows littered around the tower, he spotted none other than Harry stroking his snowy Owl, whom was perched on his arm.
"Every year since you've come to this school, you've caused some sort of scene - and it wasn't all solely because of You-Know-Who so don't give me that look." Draco said warningly. "None of that this year, alright? No scheming, no funny business. I don't even want to
Draining his cup, he quickly glanced at Potter and saw him talking heatedly to the Weasel. Turning to find his friends, he collided with a mass of black robes and a grunt of irritation that could only belong to one person.
“Oh! That also reminds me, then.” Hermione added excitedly, “I could knit you two some gloves for practice. It’s getting colder out…” She dug through her bookbag and the two boys exchanged glances.
something supplied in his brain, which he cut off immediately. He’d gone over this already, before the final task. Harry had survived then and he’ll keep surviving again and again after that. He was fine. Harry would be fine.
"He said it?" Ron asked, not even glancing at Harry. Hermione nodded and Ron rubbed his face. "Blimey."
Harry gritted his teeth. “I haven’t a clue what you want me to do, Professor. If you can’t already tell, I’m bleeding and I have better things to be doing right now.”
He entered the Hall with a flurry of other students, making a beeline for Pansy and a brooding Blaise. Draco hoped he'd calmed down already, he felt to wound up to deal with the boy's wounded temper at the moment.
The bell rang for the end of the lesson. Outside came the bustling sounds of students rushing to the Great Hall from their classes for lunch.
"Yeah, sure. Tell me Malfoy, as you so graciously always remind me, my parents are dead, are they not?"
Draco thought for a moment, tapping his finger erratically on his leg. "Well, Dumbledore seems to think I'm some sort of…mole, for him." He admitted.
Draco readjusted his position, turning to sit fully facing Harry with a tentative look on his face. Harry leant back, slightly taken aback by the other boy’s shift in resolve. Before this, he’d been resigned and worried, but now the air coming from him was determined and sure of himself.
Peace. Draco felt complete, utter peace for a few moments. It scared him, because then he had to think about what he was without it all this time.
Harry looked down at the food for a moment, and saw some of it was already in small pieces. Seeing as it was presented just like last time,  he let himself pick one up and start to eat. Malfoy didn't react when he did.
“Just sit down.” She finally said through gritted teeth, but there was an undertone of fear in her eyes. “And do your work.”
"Right. Voldemort works secretly, did so in the first war. He tricks, jinxes, and blackmails who he wants, not going around knocking on doors. He’s well-practiced at operating in secrecy. It's possibly why Harry was attacked by a Dementor in the middle of a Muggle neighbourhood."
"D'you think we made some sort of mistake?" Hermione whispered in to Harry's ear as Draco and Ron continued to bicker behind them.
"You could have just asked her instead of being all jealous. One would think there was at least one cell up in that thick head of yo- Ow!" Harry made sure to step on the same foot he did earlier. "Shut up, Malfoy." He wanted to say, but it just came out as a whisper as he kept his eyes glued on Ron and Hermione. Hermione's eyes narrowed as she looked from Ron to Harry and Malfoy,
"I don't like it either, Ron" Harry said, trying to quell the boy's anger, but it seemed to only make him angrier.
Umbridge, for the first time that evening, faltered at his sudden shift in mood. Her face shuttered with something indiscernible for a moment, like a brief window of her true feelings, before regaining her same neutral smile.
, he thought. Something in his stomach churned...nausea filled him as the image in his mind didn’t go away even though his eyes were back to their original colour. The image of those eyes. Those red eyes...staring back at him…
"Here where?" He asked, trying his best to keep his voice level so as to not break the spell they were in. He needed to know what Malfoy was thinking. Was it just him, or did he feel it too? The moment of crushing realisation of something. He prayed to anything that would listen, prayed that Malfoy would give him any indication of what he knew, what he was thinking. Harry felt like Malfoy knew something, but he didn't know what.
So the house was under a Fidelius Charm. He'd never seen one in real life before - but then again that was kind of the point. Over the summer he couldn't help but look in to the charm a bit more while he'd been meant to be learning Latin. The spell was never actually specified to be cast to hide a house or location, but it was the most common and sensical choice so the two became synonymous over time. The only actual parameters of the spell were to hide a secret within one's soul, which worked out just fine for Draco. If only that idiot Harry would agree to do the spell…
"So many things…" Draco muttered to himself, then continued to Harry, "Will you be okay without any Witches or Wizards this summer? Around your muggle family, to be specific. They may not…understand what happened this year, right? What you've been through?"
Draco deflated slightly, relieved from a tension he didn’t know he was carrying. If Umbridge was truly harmless in that way, then Harry should be alright. Draco feared she might have it in for him especially, or try to expel him throughout the year. He didn’t let himself rule out such possibilities completely, however. In the back of his mind still lingered the past memories of his hours spent in tutoring with the woman in his childhood, and the viscous aura of malice that he would feel seeping out of her.
"Gillyweed in liquid form is used for potions, but in it's pure plant - or weed- form, it can have certain…effects on a person if they consumed the stuff."
"Let's stop talking about you dying, then, alright?" Draco yelled. "Let's change the subject. You're insufferable."
They apparated swiftly, melting in to the hoards of muggles trying to get to their trains. His parents both turned their noses up at them, but Draco just ignored them.
Nudging Ron awake, he quickly immersed himself in their potion without looking at Draco for the rest of the lesson.
“Anything is legal if the Board deems it necessary.” Dumbledore sighed, the first sign of frustration at the situation being shown. “But of course, those are just my thoughts. Best not to let them burden you too much, Mr Malfoy.”
"And thus, he's been a pain in the arse since, cooped up here." Remus said. "Dumbledore hasn't really felt Sirius has anything to do for the Order, either…"
a liar. He is a Gryffindor, mind you. He has no reason to lie, and is definitely not smart enough to - especially to
"And the next task?" Draco asked, having wondered about it since the last one ended. Harry shrugged vaguely, as if he wasn't almost going in to shock from the idea of the last task.
.”, she continued in a tone that seemed casual but told him she was much more curious than she let on. “How is your father, by the way, Draco? I can call you that, yes? Draco?”
Harry arrived at the Great Hall eventually, flushed and panting, but arrived nonetheless. Even the food hadn’t disappeared yet, and it seemed he had time to spare.
"And Ron." Harry sighed, letting go of his sleeve and Draco let go of his wrist. He brushed past Draco to the door, and Draco waved his wand to dispel the silencing charm over the room behind his back.
"Oh my god! My hair!" Flashbacks of Aunt Petunia giving him the worst haircut of his life as a child sent Harry in to an even more panicked state than usual. He instinctively went to grab his wand from his pockets, aiming to hex the living daylights out the Slytherin, before whirling around to see Malfoy already holding a conjured mirror out for him.
"Draco." A voice called. He looked around to see Bill popping his head out the kitchen door. "Meeting today. Dumbledore will be here soon."
. Almost tripping with the ingredients held to his chest possessively, Harry nodded curtly to him and reached his table. He begun heating up his cauldron with the alkali base and started with throwing in the crushed Occamy Shells. Ron read out the instructions to him and sliced the ingredients as he went.
"You didn't even notice." Ron piped up, "You also always looked more…relaxed at odd times when you did finally show up. I thought you were going barmy from the Tournament, to be quite honest…" Ron said, rubbing his neck sheepishly at Harry. Harry stared between his two friends, not knowing what to say and wanting to ask a million question all at once.
Remus glanced at Sirius, something secret passing between them. They both looked back at the three of them, uncertainty lurking in their eyes.
"Yeah…" Harry said, not really knowing himself where he was going with this. "It was weird. Last time I'd seen him was in that Graveyard." He swallowed heavily, anxiety rising in his throat.
"What? Why am I just sitting here waiting for you guys?" Harry cried, rushing up and starting to run towards the Portrait. "See you guys later!" He checked his watch, cursing when he saw he had only a few minutes left before the food disappeared.
"I know that, Ron!" Harry replied defensively, all the while running through ways he would have to break it to Parvati. Oh, God. She's going to hate him. Harry cursed the day the killing curse hadn't worked. Stupid scar, stupid Ball, stupid
Malfoy shrugged and said, "You're really not, but…I can't really tell anyone else. People in Slytherin are…"
“We’ll talk about everything tomorrow, no worries, mate.” Harry led Ron out of the bathroom quickly, arms full of both of their stuff. “I need a damn break, anyway.”
McGonagall didn't stop staring at them for a few painful moments before stalking away, her eyes still wide. Harry sighed at the floor and turned to Malfoy. He immediately regretted doing so as he saw the boy staring at the top of his head with a sneer.
"But…Why?" Draco asked, ready to believe the two were either stupider or creepier than he originally thought.
"Potter. Weasley. Another zero. Abysmal." Snape sneered when he walked by their cauldron. Harry barely heard, his pulse seeming way too loud for it to be heard as blood rushing in his ears.
" 'We cannot sing above the ground' is quite obvious. I agree that it's probably merpeople." Draco confirmed after Harry finished, "And there are merpeople in the Lake. They sometimes show up on the first few days of school to spook the First Years in the Common Room. Sadistic buggers, the lot of them."
It was a moment before he felt Harry's heaving chest, and heard the small sobs coming from the boy. He immediately tightened his grasp on the boy, voicing soothing hushed sounds to him every so often.
“I read that levels Three to One are all restricted,” Draco explained. “They’re all kept elsewhere more securely. There’s so little information about whatever’s in Level One, though.”
"Going for a walk." He mumbled, not waiting for Ron or Hermione to respond. He walked out the Hall without looking up, focusing on his shoes and not caring if he bumped in to few people on the way. Before he knew it, he was sitting on his usual spot by the Lake in silence and staring blankly at the water.
Draco wasn’t always like this. Cold, aloof. He was actually a very happy young child and if it was not for his parents impending expectations on him, he might have actually been a decent lad. Of course this isn’t something that anyone else understood - or cared to listen to even - particularly because of his role in the war that he begrudgingly took place in.
He wasn’t sure why he was asking, he had been stuck on Draco for the last 5 years, beating himself up over the mistake that had lost him the love of his life. The last thing he needed was to pretend to be friendly and casual when he desperately longed to be in his life again.
He glanced into Harry’s eyes and smiled, unable to believe that the man he spent his childhood pining over is standing in front of him.
“Enough with the attitude, you and I both know you don’t have another option other than staying with me, so I’d rather skip the dramatics.” Harry said sternly, looking into Draco’s eyes for some sort of sign that he agreed with what he was saying. Draco nodded lightly and he let go of his arm.
Once dinner was over, everyone had made their way onto the dance floor, Marie was clearly drunk and trying to throw it back on Oliver while he laughed and kissed her. Draco was the only one left sitting at his table, he was sipping on his drink and feeling like his head was spinning, but in a good way. He liked how it made him feel light and nonexistent, like if he wanted to, he could fly away and be rid of the issues he had when sober. He saw Noah walking towards him from across the room, looking apologetic and like he had a million things to say, none of which would make this situation any less awkward. Draco did not want to deal with Noah’s speech on how he was sorry and hoped that he wasn’t hurt and how he felt so bad. It was all so disingenuous and Draco wanted no part of it. He stood up from his chair, making his way to the dance floor, watching Noah stop and eye him, Draco was annoyed. Annoyed that he was all of a sudden acting a saint, on his wedding day out of all days. So he grabbed the first gay looking lad that he saw and started dancing on him. Grinding his hips on him to the rhythm of his music. He was sick of seeing Noah’s puppy dog eyes looking at him with pity so he closed his eyes and continued to dance, turning around and wrapping his arms around the other guy's neck.
“Is this… a good idea?” He asked, grabbing Harry’s face and pulling him deeper into the kiss. Despite how much he was loving this feeling, he couldn’t help but wonder what this would mean for them. Harry pressed his mouth against Draco’s ear,
He was currently at the Ministry, he had a meeting scheduled with Marvin and was hoping it would be quick, any Ministry business made Draco feel anxious.
If Draco didn’t know better he would have thought that the expression on Harry’s face was concern. Even though they were friends, it was difficult to imagine Harry caring about his emotions or state of mind after he had basically rejected any romantic future for them.
“You are a proper asshole sometimes, you know that?” Casper said, his face showing half amusement and half disappointment.
“I don’t know why you’re always second guessing yourself, Aaron” Draco stated, confused as to why he was always undervaluing whatever work he did. Whether it was at the office, or even with something as simple as his dinner.
They chatted about their childhoods, which left a little awkward tensions, so they moved onto their jobs. It turned out that Ron was far more invested in his auror work than Harry or Draco had ever been, he was truly involved and excited about the work he was doing. This left Draco, who hated every second of auror training, to have a spark of inspiration about the occupation.
His recent disinterest in hookup culture was beginning to worry him, every man he has tried to sleep with since that fateful night in October was only ranked in comparison to Draco; and the more they looked, acted, and fucked like he did, the higher on the list they were. Draco had become his gold standard, ruining the pleasure of variety for him.
