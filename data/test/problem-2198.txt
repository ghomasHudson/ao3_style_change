Teddy nods his head and then gently moves off the bed. “Love you, daddy,” he says as he walks out of the room.
We have a plan. Malfoy is going to teach me some spells that will help me defend myself when they attack me again and some spells I can use to get back at them. I’m not sure about attacking them, but Malfoy says I need to show them that I will stick up for myself, that it is the only way to make them stop. And maybe he’s right, so I will learn the jinxes and see if I’ll use them when the time is there.
Pansy puts her glass of wine down on the table. Her hands wring together on her lap. “I don’t know how to tell you. But Blaise and Ginny were right. I can’t keep hiding this from you.”
By the time Professor Lupin came back, I was sitting in Draco’s lap and we were both eating the chocolate he gave us. It really did help, it made me feel warm again. Greg, Blaise, Hermione, Luna and Daphne had joined us in the new compartment. None of them had fainted like I had and I felt a little ashamed. They had seen the Dementor and also felt horrible, but none of them felt as sick as I was feeling at that moment.
It was after his father got arrested that Draco got his wish. The Dark Lord offered him a place at his table, marked him as one of his own and gave him a special mission. Draco was to kill Dumbledore, the most powerful wizard alive.
Remus stands up and then pulls Harry in a weird sideways hug. “Harry. I might be your teacher now, I’m also still your uncle. You can always come to me when you need help.”
Hermione shakes her head. “Your father is involved with everything at the Ministry, Ron,” she says. “He’s too curious for his own good. You’ve heard Shacklebolt at Harry’s and Neville’s birthday party. Your father always stops by at the Auror office to find out the latest news.”
Harry takes one last look at Draco. He smiles that private little smile that he only used to do around Harry. But now it’s directed at Greengrass. Harry swallows and runs out of the Great Hall. Footsteps follow him, but Harry doesn’t stop. He runs out of the school, past the hedges and onto the path towards the Quidditch field.
But me losing points didn’t go well with my Slytherin classmates. They shoved me into the wall when we were walking to our next class. Malfoy said that he would hex me in my sleep if I manage to lose even more points for our house.
‘Yes, I will,’ Malfoy writes. ‘When you‘ve finished the first four chapters of the potions book I just gave you.’
“Maybe you should keep your opinions to yourself,” someone else says. Draco takes his eyes from Harry to find out who it is. It’s one of the two men that came in a couple of minutes after Draco and Harry had arrived. The one that is pretty far along, seeing the size of his belly.
When I left the platform Uncle Vernon, who is still purple-faced with that ugly moustache of his, was waiting for me, with a terrified-looking aunt Petunia and Dudley standing behind him. They hurried me out of the station and we drove back home. As soon as we got home, uncle Vernon locked all my schoolbooks, my wand, robes, cauldron and all other school supplies in the cupboard under the stairs. I have no idea how I’m going to make my homework this way.
I was surprised to hear Hermione take the blame for it all, saying that she went out to look for the troll and that we had all come to save her. I had never heard her tell a lie in all the time I had known her. And then professor McGonagall took five points from Gryffindor, but she awarded the rest of us each five points for defeating the troll. I was proud that I had finally won my house some points. And then she told us to go to our dormitories, where the rest of the students were finishing their feast. It was hard walking to the dungeons by myself, knowing my friends were going up together to the Gryffindor common room to celebrate.
When Harry walks out of the closet he catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror. His hair is a mess, standing up in all directions. His eyes are puffy and his glasses are crooked on his face. Harry smiles at himself and shakes his head. Maybe it’s for the best that Draco isn’t here anymore to yell at him for being a disaster. For the first time in years, Harry doesn’t have to pretend to care about how he leaves his house.
But now Draco hardly signs. He just looks around and doesn’t interfere. Everyone signs, just as always, as it’s the only way Sirius can understand them. But the signs go quickly and Harry is sure that Draco only catches small amounts of what is being said. He’s not used to having three people speak at the same time, or fly over each other to get their point across. Harry hasn’t signed this quickly in weeks, always slowing down his movements so Draco can see them properly. He hadn’t even noticed he did this until now, when Sirius told Harry he’d become slow.
The rest of the day I spend with Ron, Fred and George. Christmas dinner was amazing. There were a hundred fat, roast turkeys, mountains of roast and boiled potatoes, platters of chipolatas, tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. The crackers were really cool; they went off with big blasts and colourful smoke. I got a pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit and my own set of wizard chess from the crackers.
After another while, I decided that since I would already get expelled I would just use some more magic to bewitch the trunk to make it feather-light. That way I could tie it to my broomstick, cover myself with the invisibility cloak and then fly to London to get my money from Gringotts and start my life as an outcast. I opened my trunk to look for the cloak when I felt like someone was watching me. I looked at the black alleyway behind me, even used a Lumos to see it better. And that is when I saw it, a hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes. It scared me to death. I stepped backwards, I hit my trunk and tripped. My wand slipped out of my hand and then there was this massive bang sound and I was surrounded by blinding lights.
A noise comes from the baby monitor and Draco closes his eyes for a second. It’s his turn to get out of bed and feed Nathan. The only problem is that Draco doesn’t know if he will make it to Nathan’s room without spilling his dinner from last night all over the floor.
Draco and I fell asleep again, and when we woke up this morning, the hospital wing was crowded with our friends. Hermione, Blaise, Luna, Greg, Daphne, Millicent, Ron and Neville were all there. They had overheard headmaster Dumbledore fight with the minister about the return of Voldemort. I knew I couldn’t lie to them, so I told them the truth, that he was back.
Remus doesn’t say anything. Harry knows Remus still feels guilty for not being there that night. Not that anyone ever blamed him. He was at St Mungo's to support his husband. It was a bad time. And Lily and James survived, Lestrange got caught and Harry wasn’t harmed. It could have been so much worse. Harry could have become an orphan just like Neville. But now that the Dementor is gone Harry can appreciate how amazing his life has been up to now. He’s a lucky boy and he will never forget it again.
“I’ll do it,” Draco says. He’s crazy for believing that this means more than it does, but what does he have to lose? And the smile Granger sends his way right now is promising.
“Harry James Potter, you are charged for murdering Pansy Parkinson. How do you plea?” Hermione says.
After we did all our shopping we went to get some ice-cream at Florean Fortescue’s. Draco’s mom and Mrs Tonks went to sit at their own table, to chat and catch up. Draco is still surprised about that. He never really knew Mrs Tonks, who’s his aunt, because she was cast out of the family after she married a Muggle-born wizard. I like that somehow my little misdemeanour caused them reconnecting. Florean himself brought us our ice-creams and asked us about the coming school year. Hermione mentioned our essay about medieval witch burnings and she and Florean got into a discussion about that, giving me and Draco some time to just stare at each other and smile a lot. I don’t think I’ve ever smiled this much before in my life. I like it.
But that’s not even the best part. Fred and George showed me the seven secret passages into Hogsmeade. Filch knows about four of them, one is caved in and one has it’s entrance below the Whomping Willow. But there is one in the third-floor corridor that goes straight into the cellar of Honeydukes. So after Fred and George had left I wasted no time to get to the third floor and find this secret passage.
“I’m going to cancel the dinner for tonight,” Harry says. He turns towards the hearth. Moments later, Draco hears Ron’s voice.
Hagrid found me like that and took me to his little house. He carried me all the way and sat me down on his small couch. He was making me tea when Professor Snape showed up. He and Hagrid stared at each other for a while, and then Hagrid let the professor in.
The Dark Lord puts his fork down and looks around the table. His eyes linger on Draco. Draco looks away. He can’t stand the calculated red eyes on him.
Harry pushes the note back to Malfoy with a small smile. If Malfoy could just understand that Harry wants to help him. He’s not here to make fun of him. Or make everything worse. He wants Malfoy to be happy.
“Just come along,” Hermione says in that tone that forces you to comply. Ron sighs, but he turns to follow Hermione.
Ginny is okay now, George told me she is just sad that I don’t fancy her, but that she will get over it. I hope she does, I never mend to hurt her. He and Fred also assured me that Ron will come around, probably very quickly because my new broom is scheduled to arrive tomorrow. I’m glad the twins don’t treat me any differently than before. They are asleep now, it’s already very late, but I just can’t sleep. I keep thinking about how Draco didn’t say one word to me. I want him to talk to me. I don’t want to have to share a dorm room with him this year and not be able to fall down on his bed to complain about Hermione her study schedules. Or not get his help with Potions, he’s been the only one who has been able to make that subject make sense for me. And I want to see him smile at me, I want him to hold my hand during breakfast and dinner. And I want to hear him complain about headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall and how they always seem to favour Gryffindor students. But it looks like I won’t have all that this year and now I don’t know if I want to go back to Hogwarts. Because it’s just going to hurt, seeing him without being able to hang out with him. I’m afraid it’s going to be worse than just missing him.
On a happier note, there’s good news on the Quidditch. Training is going really well, even with the stupid Shooting Star I’m using. I’m getting faster and faster at catching the snitch and Marcus is really happy with how well our team works. And Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end of November. We can still win the cup this year!
I’ve missed the sorting, but was in time for the Headmasters warning about the Dementors, he said they won’t be fooled by tricks, disguises or even Invisibility Cloaks. So I won’t be sneaking out of the grounds any time soon, not that I want to, but I don’t want to be near those creatures ever again.
Draco wants to tell Harry that he shouldn’t, that he’s an idiot for loving him. But instead, he just drops his head and keeps silent. Harry won’t hear him, he never has and he never will when it comes to this.
At that moment Headmaster Dumbledore walked in and Draco started to beg him to bring him his wand. But the headmaster also didn’t listen to him and he just ordered professor Snape, the Minister and even madam Pomfrey to leave. He wanted to have a word with me and Hermione. I tried to explain to him that Black was innocent but he just hold up his hand and I stopped talking. He said we could still save Sirius tonight, that our word wouldn’t be enough, but that we could save him if we just had a little more time and that three turns should be enough. Hermione nodded like she understood what Dumbledore was talking about. He wanted to say more but Draco interrupted him, saying there was more than just our words to support that Black is innocent. The headmaster asked Draco what this was and Draco explains how he started a recording spell with his wand. That the entire conversation with Peter Pettigrew is stored on his wand.
The Dark Lord chuckles and Draco turns his head so he can see the man. He twirls his wand in his hand. His tongue licks over his upper lip. The right side of his mouth is lifted in a grin and his eyes twinkle as if he’s just got a new toy from Santa.
“It will help,” Harry says. “We’ve tried it with the tests. It doesn’t do anything except take away the joy we find in each other. I want to make love to you again, Draco. I want you to enjoy our time together. I miss watching you come apart from my touch. Man, I miss you. I truly miss you.”
Harry doesn’t stop. Doesn’t even reply to Oliver’s shouts. He needs to find Neville and stop him. He can’t lose his brother. Neville is the fucking ‘Boy Who Lived’, and Harry is going to make sure it stays that way. Nobody is killing Neville today. And especially not that rat Pettigrew.
The kiss lasts forever and, at the same time, it’s over much too quickly. Draco and Harry smile at each other for some time. Then Harry climbs on Draco’s bed and sits down next to Draco. He pulls his legs under his butt and places another kiss on Draco’s lips.
Ron, Draco and Harry pull Neville back to the table. Neville plants his hands on the surface and refuses to sit down.
“He’s fine,” she tells James. “I’ll have the house-elves bring him some dinner and then he can go back to his dorm. No need for him to stay here all night. I’m sure his friends want to hear all about his fall from the sky.”
Draco did it. He’s in the house team. I knew he could do it. Is it stupid that I’m happy for him, even though he ignores me all the time? I feel stupid about it. I should hate him by now, shouldn’t I? Ron and Neville have made up their minds about him, saying he’s a lowlife. Ron said that his parents were right that there could never come anything good from the Malfoy family. Hermione is a little more tactful, not really saying she thinks he’s an idiot, but I know she thinks it. Ron thinks Draco is only on the team because his father had bought new brooms for the entire team. But I know better. Draco was one of the better players to try out for the opened up Chaser position. Only no-one believes me when I say that. Hermione just gives me sad looks whenever I do.
Draco showed me the passage in a book about the Basilisk and it all made sense. Hagrid had said something had been killing roosters, and the crowing of the rooster is fatal to a Basilisk. We only took some time to figure out how the Basilisk got around the castle. But after some brainstorming we knew, it was using the pipes. The voice I heard was inside the walls.
Draco looks confused, unaware of the terror raising inside Harry. He blinks but doesn’t say a word. Harry wants to slap him, wants to hurt him for doing this to them. He said he would never take them again.
Harry’s eyes scan all the places they put down detection charms, only Pettigrew is nowhere near them. He sighs and wants to crumble up the map and throw it away. He doesn’t of course, the thing is too valuable to destroy. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to destroy it. It’s useless.
A massive smile breaks out on Harry’s face. He leans in and kisses Draco again. “I’ll make sure he knows how important it is that we safe her,” he promises. Draco lets him take his hand and guide him out of the room towards Dumbledore’s office.
It’s crazy, but Harry is disappointed when he doesn’t get a gift during breakfast the next Monday. He knows he asked Malfoy to stop, and that he should be happy, but somehow it just doesn’t sit right. Harry looks over to the Slytherin table, only to discover that Malfoy isn’t there. Zabini and Parkinson sit alone, apparently in a heated discussion by the looks of it. Parkinson looks up and stares straight at Harry. Harry looks away and pretends to listen to Luna who is excited about the upcoming Care for Magical Creatures class.
After the Halloween feast, which was great and a lot of fun, I just wanted to crawl into bed with Draco and kiss all my worries away. But we had hardly brushed our teeth when we were all ordered to go back to the Great Hall. When we arrived there, Hermione made her way over to us and told us that The Fat Lady, the portrait that guarded the Gryffindor dormitories had vanished and that her portrait had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor. According to Peeves it had been Sirius Black trying to get into Gryffindor Tower.
And the silence. Harry never thought he would love silence. But it’s one of the things he likes the most when he’s with Draco. There’s no need to talk or to do anything at all. They can just sit and do nothing. Well, Harry does nothing. Draco reads or works on some essays they have to do during the summer break. Harry will get to them when he feels like it. Exams are done. Now is the time to relax. Not the time to think about more things he needs to do for school. Only Draco, Hermione and Iris are sad the year is over. Neville likes to tease Harry that he found himself a male Hermione. Not that Harry minds. He knows how different Hermione and Draco are. Just because they both like to study, doesn’t make them the same person.
“Fuck,” Neville says. Harry looks at the library on the map and his breathing stops. There is one other name in the library. He sits in his usual spot. A spot Harry used to share with him. Draco’s name is clear on the map. Harry can’t think. Draco is in danger.
“Harry,” Draco says when his tears have died down. He lifts his head and looks Harry in the eyes. “You do realise that I’m about to give up everything my parents have ever thought to me?”
It sounds as if they are all here. Harry wants to hex them all. Wasn’t he clear this morning when he told them he was going on a date with Draco and that they should stay away?
“I told Hermione and Ron to stay away,” Neville says. “Thought you didn’t want too many eyes around while you cry.”
This Tuesday we went over to the family Tonks so we could take a very early Port-key to the Quidditch World Cup. Sirius had gotten tickets from the Ministry for his wrongful imprisonment. We were all very excited to go. We had six tickets and we went together with Draco, Tonks, Remus and Mr Tonks. Mrs Tonks made us an amazing dinner the night before and promised to wake us all up in time. It felt like she woke us up way too early. Draco was even cranky, and he’s the morning person of both of us. I was just glad she didn’t say anything about the fact that Draco hadn’t slept in the bed she made for him but instead had again crawled into mine.
Dinner was good and we were all in a happy mood until Headmaster Dumbledore gave the direst news of the evening. There will be no Quidditch Cup this year! No flying on brooms and practice twice a week with our team members. We looked at Adrian and Miles and they looked just as shocked as us, unable to believe that we won’t be continuing our winning streak this year. I was looking forward to it, seeing how well Draco would do as our new captain now that Marcus had left.
Ron snores as usual. He’s fast asleep. Just as Neville, Seamus and Dean. Only Harry lays awake in his bed. He’s had a nightmare. It started as a good dream. Harry was in the library with Draco. They were doing their homework. Their knees were touching and they kept smiling at each other. But then it all changed. Pettigrew was suddenly there. There was nothing Harry could do. Green light flashed around them. Harry looked at Draco. His head lay on the table, his eyes still open, but he was dead.
“Harry, please don’t. He’s not worth it,” Draco says. He doesn’t say that he agrees with the man. Draco is getting precisely what he deserves. He had always known his happiness couldn’t last.
Afterwards, her head just fell forward onto her chest until it snapped up suddenly. She spoke to me as nothing had happened. It really freaked me out. Did she mean that Sirius Black would rejoin Voldemort tonight and that he will come back? Will he come after me and really kill me this time? I just went back to the dungeon without paying any attention to the people around me. I looked for Draco in the common room, but he wasn’t there. He also isn’t in our dormitory, so that’s why I’m writing to you first. I’m sure he’ll be back soon, and when not I’ll go find him in the owlery. I’m sure he went there to send his letter to his mother.
Headmaster Dumbledore arrived at that point and I was glad to see him. He would never think I would be able to murder a cat. The headmaster detached the cat and asked Filch, Hermione and me to follow him. Lockhart told us we could use his office and off we went. Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall followed as well, being the heads of our houses. In the office headmaster Dumbledore examined the cat and told us she was not dead but petrified and that no second year would be able to do that, because it was the most advanced Dark Magic.
Hi everyone, this coming month the updates will be a bit more than usual because I'm using this story as one of the main projects for NaNo. But this also means that the editing will be limited on the coming updates. I'll go over them again in December and fix any grammar and spelling mistakes.
Headmaster Dumbledore asked me if there was anything I wanted to tell him, and for a moment I thought about telling him about the voice I had heard saying it wanted to kill. But I remember that Hermione had said that hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, so I decided not to tell him. And maybe I should have asked him if he knew if I was somehow related to Salazar Slytherin. Or told him that the children and even some professors at the school are consciously avoiding me, afraid I’ll go after them next. But I said that there was nothing and after that, I was allowed to leave.
The topic of conversation switches back to Ron’s holiday to Egypt after that. Wood stops by at some point to tell Harry Quidditch practice starts this Saturday at eleven since their first game will be against Slytherin. There will be no time to relax into the season, and Harry is fine with that. The amount of Quidditch he gets to play is the best part of being at school.
That was the only good thing about being in the papers though. Draco’s father has sent an angry letter to Draco, about how he’s disgracing the Malfoy name and how he wished he had a better son, one that would behave like a real man instead of the girl he’s stuck with now. Draco cried that night. He pretends he doesn’t care that his father hates him in front of everyone else, but he can’t lie to me. I can see how upset he was and I wish I could make this easier for him. All he ever wanted was his father to be proud of him and the fact that he knows that will never happen hurts.
The other players move to the showers and Draco takes his leave. His stride is fast when he walks to the castle. The grounds are empty and quiet as if it knows that the world is going to change now. It scares Draco. With Harry gone there will only be one man standing in the way of the Dark Lord. How long will crazy Dumbledore be able to keep him at bay? How long before this world will be the Dark Lord’s domain? How long before nobody will remember what it was like to feel safe? How long before Draco will forget the bliss the last couple of weeks have been? Away from the Manor where the Dark Lord plans his rise to power, away from his father that wants Draco to be just like him, only better. He will forget about the weeks where he’d confided in Harry about his fears, the nights they spend on top of the astronomy tower, getting to know each other for real. And he will forget about that one kiss before the game today for good luck. Draco’s first and only kiss. Nobody else will ever touch his lips again. Draco is sure there will never be anyone else for him. Nobody will get to know him as Harry knew him. With all his flaws laid bare and out in the open.
“How long before Harry comes home?” Teddy asks. It snaps Draco out of his thoughts. He looks up and hopes he doesn’t have tears in his eyes. The last thing he wants to do is upset Teddy.
I went back to the mirror the next night. I hadn’t been able to stop thinking about it all day. Ron asked me what was wrong, but I couldn’t tell him. This was my secret, my family, my cloak. And I had been afraid I wouldn’t be able to find the room again. I wandered around for what felt like hours before I found the suit of armour outside of the classroom with the mirror. And you were still there, beaming at me.
“You’re an idiot,” Draco tells him. “You can fuck me when we fall in our bed sometime this morning, pissed out of our minds.”
They left after a while, leaving me tied to the tree. I struggled to get lose, but nothing worked. My eyes were watery and that hurt, because the tears started to freeze a little. After a while I just let my head hang and hoped it would all be over soon. I must have passed out at some point because the next thing I know I woke up in the hospital wing with some warm blankets on top of me. Madam Pomfrey made me stay there for three whole days, only releasing me in time to go celebrate New Year’s Eve. Not that I had anyone to celebrate it with. I stayed up together with Myrtle, looking at the fireworks through her bathroom window.
“My sweet boy, if I’d know, I would have made sure you never set another foot in this house,” Narcissa says. Draco swallows the lump in his throat. This he hadn’t expected. His mother might have said that she had no problem with Draco being bent, but his happiness hadn’t been more important than his duty. And now, somehow his mother understands that Draco wasn’t supposed to be here. That he had chosen a different path.
“Then don’t,” Neville says. “Maybe it will all turn out for the better. But for now, you need to keep your mind busy with something else. So go figure out how we can find Pettigrew, and then we can get rid of the rat once and for all.”
I went up to the hospital wing during my lunch break and see how Ron’s new friend Longbottom was doing. Ron said Neville was going to be fine. I told him I was going to visit Hagrid and asked him to come along. Ron agreed, so after a double lesson of Transfiguration, we made our way across the grounds to Hagrid’s small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. Hagrid asked how my first week had been. I said it had been fine, but Ron then told Hagrid that Malfoy and his friend had been bullying me all week. Hagrid told me I should try to stand up to them, let them know that I will not be messed with. I nodded, but I’m not sure how I’m supposed to stand up to them. Hagrid then changed the subject to Ron’s brother Charlie, like he knew that I didn’t really want to talk about Malfoy and his friends. I didn’t really listen, because I saw a small cutting from the Daily Prophet about the break-in of Gringotts that Ron told me about on the train ride to Hogwarts. The robbery was on the same date as Hagrid and I had been at the bank. And when I asked Hagrid about it he grunted and offered me another rock cake. Which are horrible by the way, but I didn’t want to be impolite so I took one and stuffed it in my pocket. But what was most interesting was that the vault had been emptied earlier that day and that Hagrid had taken something from a vault that day, emptying it. I think Hagrid had collected the package just in time. But where is it now?
Harry puts his quill down. The final exam of the year is done. Harry has no idea if it will be enough to keep his grades at a passable point, but there is nothing more he can do about it. He tried his best in the last week before exams to catch up on the work he missed (or as Hermione likes to put it, the work he ignored). Hermione even helped him after he apologised for his horrible behaviour.
The Easter holiday didn’t feel like a holiday at all. We had so much homework we spend most of our time in the library studying. And when we weren’t studying, Draco and I had Quidditch practise. Hermione seemed to live in the library. She was always already there when Draco and I would finally get out of bed. And she never left before us. I think she was close to tears most of the time. I tried talking to her about her workload, but she just snapped at me and told me to leave her alone.
After that Madam Pomfrey ordered the headmaster and professor Snape to leave and told us all to go to sleep. Draco and I slept in the same bed. Madam Pomfrey shook her head when she saw us laying down in the same bed, but she didn’t say anything. And now it’s the next morning. Draco is still in bed next to me. Hermione and Ron are both still asleep and I think everything is going to be perfect this summer. With me going to live with Sirius. Draco isn’t so sure, he’s still afraid Sirius will be difficult about us, but I’m sure that once Sirius sees how different Draco is from his dad everything will be fine.
The next obstacle was some kind of enchanted mist. This is when Fleur screamed. I could feel that Draco was worried about me so I chanted that I was fine, that all was okay. And reading his letter to you from yesterday, I guess it did help him a little.
Only Fawkes had another plan. He had landed next to us and was pushing Draco away from me. Draco fought it at first and then he was gone. Only his hand stayed entwined with mine. He said everything was going to be okay and I believed him. The pain was leaving me and I could open my eyes again. The world was coming back into focus and I could see Draco sitting next to me, a smile on his face. Fawkes had his head still on my arm and a pearly patch of tears was shining all around my wound, only there was no wound anymore. And then headmaster Dumbledore’s words came back to me, phoenix tears have healing powers. I wasn’t going to die. I was so happy that I leapt at Draco and found his lips again and this time I kissed him back with all my strength. We laughed and kissed and it was perfect. We were both going to be okay and Voldemort and the Basilisks were death.
Harry smiles at him. He can always count on Ron to help in situations like this. It’s bad enough that everyone is staring at Neville again, as if he somehow is involved with Pettigrew’s escape from Azkaban. Don’t they understand that Neville would be the last person that wants that man on the loose? If it hadn’t been for Pettigrew switching sides and giving away the Longbottom’s location, his parents might not have died.
Hermione sighs and looks at all of them for a long time. “I’ll guess I’ll help too,” she says. “Just to make sure you don’t get killed.”
The curtains open and Harry’s bed dips. Someone sits down on the edge. A soft hand rubs over Harry’s back.
Harry closes his eyes. He can see the smile he woke up to for the last fifteen years. The smile that was stolen from him not that long ago. “I’m sorry,” he whispers. Then he opens his eyes and looks at Shacklebolt. “I don’t need an attorney,” he says.
Harry doesn’t think. He walks up to Draco, takes his face in his hands and places a kiss on Draco’s lips.
Harry sighs. “What is wrong with you all?” he says. “What if mum and dad had just decided to do nothing when Uncle Sirius lost his hearing?”
So you will believe that I was relieved when Riddle continued his little speech and revealed that Draco had no memory of doing any of it. He hadn’t known that he was being used. It sickened me when Riddle bragged about how interesting it had been to read about how worried Draco had been, how he had questioned if he might be responsible for any of it. And how fun it had been to convince him otherwise. Until Draco had said he wouldn’t write to Tom again after an argument. But I had been so kind to almost kill myself, upsetting Draco so much that he started writing to him again.
“Go, both of you. I’ll call when it calms down,” Ron says. “If I could, I would come with you. I think my mother wants to kill me for not calling her sooner.”
“He’s not listening,” Neville says beside him. He must mean Harry, but Harry’s eyes are fixed on the Slytherin table. Draco sits there, with a smile on his face. Greengrass sits opposite of him. Her hands fly around as she signs something. Draco laughs and signs back. He looks happy. He looks fine. How can he be fine? Doesn’t it hurt at all that he’s lost his best friend? Has he replaced Harry this easily?
"He's not using again, is he?" Blaise asks. Harry looks up at him. He didn't notice Blaise move towards them, or even re-enter the room.
“Don’t be. I know you’ve tried. I’ll just have to get used to the fact that my best friend hates me and wants nothing to do with me anymore,” Pansy says matter of factly.
“Don’t,” Draco says. “Don’t lie to me. You need to go. You need to find a man that can give you your family. I’m not worth giving up your dream.”
“Yeah, I get that,” Ginny says. “Fucking pure-bloods and their stupid ideas about what is normal and acceptable.”
The Astronomy Tower is empty. Draco sits down at the edge. The one where he found Harry on that first night back after the summer holidays. He lays his hand on the spot where Harry would normally sit down beside him. Draco closes his eyes and thinks back to all the times when Harry would bend his head so it would rest on Draco’s shoulder. All the times their fingers lingered next to each other, both too afraid to take hold. Those nights had been perfect. Even the ones where they screamed at each other for all the hurt they conflicted on each other over the years, the ones where they were too scared to admit that the Dark Lord had returned and would always stand in between them, and the ones where they shared their tears.
“Oh, that’s okay, Molly. I was wondering if you had made any lemonade. I would love two glasses if so,” Draco says.
“Ron assures me they never did it on our dining table, so please can we keep it?” Harry whispers in Draco’s ear.
As soon as the teachers had left the Broomstick, both Hermione and Draco popped their heads under the table. I was already crying and Draco took my arm and guided me outside, along the road until we reached a small park. He walked me in and sat me down on a little bench. He pulled a coat over me and a scarf around my neck and then just pulled me close to him. He kept telling me that it was okay, that everything will be okay. I think he even said other things, but I had a hard time listening to him. My mind was spinning. Why had nobody ever told me? Why had Hagrid, the headmaster, Mr and Mrs Tonks, Draco’s mother or even the minister never told me that you had died because your best friend had betrayed you?
Next, we had Defence Against the Dark Arts. I had really been looking forward to this class, but the lesson was a bit of a joke. The classroom smelled strongly of garlic and Professor Quirrell didn’t really tell anything interesting. The only good thing about the lesson was that nobody paid attention to me.
‘I’ve never known them, so I don’t miss them,’ Malfoy writes. He bites on his bottom lip again. Harry finds it cute when Malfoy does that. It causes all these weird feelings inside Harry’s stomach that Harry doesn’t know what to do with.
“It’s a start,” Harry says before Hermione can complain. It won’t solve all Malfoy’s problems, but at least he will know what has been said in class this way.
I know this chapter is way overdue, I'm sorry for making you all wait this long. I promise I had a good reason, but I can't really say much about that right now. I promise to try to finish this year at Hogwarts in the next couple of weeks and then start on reading the fifth book to see what is going to happen next in this story.
I need to tell you all about the night after the first task. My arm healed pretty quick and by the time I went to bed that night, it was fine. I was glad Draco was able to write to you to tell you I was fine. He also wrote a letter to Sirius for me, just to make sure he wouldn’t show up at the school the next day to make sure I was still alive. He wrote back to tell me he was proud of me.
That was the end of our conversation and Draco and I left to go get dinner at the great hall. Everyone wanted to know if I was fine, as they all had heard I had fallen down screaming during Divination. I told them all that I was fine and we agreed to meet up later at a private spot to discuss what had happened.
On the last day that the Durmstrang students were at the school, Viktor came to talk to me. He wanted to apologise for what happened in the maze. He remembers attacking Cedric, and he hates that Cedric died thinking he wanted to win so badly that he used an unforgivable curse on Cedric. I didn’t know what to tell him. Both Cedric and I had no idea that Viktor was under the Imperius curse. I only learnt about this when Barty Crouch Jr told me about it. The only thing I could do was tell Viktor that I knew it wasn’t him and that I still consider him a friend. This cheered him up a little. He said he would write, said we should stay in touch. I got a letter from him yesterday, and he’s doing okay. He says he also has nightmares about what happened in the maze. It’s nice to have someone to write to that understand a little better what it was like to be in that tournament.
Harry looks at Malfoy who has put down his coffee. His hands rest on his desk and his mouth has become a thin line.
Nott, Crabbe and Goyle laugh. “Don’t worry, Professor Lupin,” Nott says. “Malfoy is a bit of a drama queen and he will get over himself soon enough.”
Wednesday was a little better. I woke up early again and went outside to fly my broom a little. It was nice to fly, even though it makes me miss Draco even more than I already do. It’s weird to see his drapes open at night, his bed perfectly made up. I miss the sounds he makes at night. I even miss his crying. Isn’t that pathetic of me? He doesn’t want to do anything to do with me and I still miss him now that he’s not here. After I was done flying around I landed on the other side of the lake and just sat there looking at the frozen water. I don’t know how long I sat there, but I was freezing when I made my way back to the castle. When I got to the dungeon Nott and Crabbe were nowhere to be seen, so I changed a quick shower to warm up. That was a big mistake. They came back while I was under the shower and they stole my clothes and my towel from the bathroom and had to walk back to our dormitory naked. Pansy thought it was very funny. I don’t know what they did with my clothes, I haven’t gotten them back or found them anywhere and that makes me sad because it was the sweater Mrs Weasley had made for me last year. It was so comfy and Draco also liked it. He said it looked good on me. Probably because it was one of the only clothes I possess that fit me. All my other clothes are old clothes of Dudley and they are too big for me.
Voldemort went by the circle, mentioned names of people missing, and mentioned names of the people there. I hated knowing that my friends' fathers were among them. Greg and Milicent will be so ashamed knowing their fathers are back in the service of Voldemort. Nott and Greg’s fathers were also present. I’m sure they will like that, even brag about it when it comes to it.
Hermione gets up from the table and tells Harry to follow her. It isn’t until they reach the library that she says what she means.
“It’s okay, Ron. We’re glad you invited us over to make sure we didn’t hear from someone else. And I’m looking forward to becoming a godfather again.” Harry turns to look at Draco. He wipes a tear from Draco’s cheek and smiles at Draco. Draco tries to smile back at him, but the corners of his mouth don’t want to rise to form a smile. Ron and Hermione were supposed to be the godparents by now, and Harry and Draco the parents, not the other way around.
Draco stares at Harry. Sometimes he’s a mystery to Draco. Even after all this time they’ve spent together, getting to know each other more and more each day. A beautiful, wonderful mystery. But nonetheless a mystery.
And then after lunch, at the start of our Herbology class, Professor Lockhart hold me back to have a word with me. He gave me a speech about how I shouldn’t let the thirst for fame go to my head or something. He thought I flew the car to school to get attention and publicity and that it was all his fault because he helped me make front page news with his book signing. I tried to correct him, but he wouldn’t listen.
But back to the maze. The TriWizard Cup will be placed in the centre of the maze and whoever gets there first will receive full marks. And of course, the maze will be filled with obstacles, like creatures and spells. Cedric is allowed to go in first, together with me, as we have the most points at this moment. Viktor will follow ten minutes later and finally, Fleur will be allowed to enter. I’ve told Hermione and Draco about the tasks and they’ve made this impressive list of jinxes, curses, spells and charms I should learn to get through the maze. I don’t think I can learn them all in time, but Draco is positive and keeps telling me that he’ll help me and will reward me for every spell I master. And I can say, I love the rewards he gives me late at night when our roommates are asleep.
“You’re staying here?” Hermione asks. Neville signs the words before Draco has to turn to Harry again.
The afternoon goes by quickly. Harry takes the potions book with him and reads two more chapters that evening. Now Malfoy will have to go talk to Professor Flitwick about casting wordlessly. Hermione shakes her head when she sees him with his nose in a book but doesn’t say a word. She just sits down with a book while Neville and Ron play a game of chess. The next day Harry slides down next to Malfoy during Potions. Malfoy doesn’t mind and together they manage to make a decent Shrinking Solution. It’s the start of a habit. In all the classes they share, Harry and Malfoy end up next to each other. Ron complains a couple of times when he arrives late to History of Magic and finds that he has to sit alone because his friends have grouped up already. But otherwise, none of Harry’s friends say anything about this new and blooming friendship.
“We need a distraction,” Neville says. “We can’t be sitting around feeling sorry for ourselves, just because Draco and Ginny don’t get how amazing we are.”
It helps a little to hear Harry say the words; it only doesn’t take the pain away. After some time they sit down on the shower floor, and Harry pulls Draco on his lap and holds him while Draco cries. The pain becomes worse with every cramp. Small tickles of blood flow from Draco, and he hopes that it will be over soon. He’s so tempted to go for the pain potions to relieve his pain, no matter the consequences. This pain is too much, too unbearable. It’s then that the first little jelly-like tissue leaves Draco’s body. For a moment Draco wonders if that is all, but the cramps don’t die down and he’s afraid it’s not over yet.
So now the ward is silent. Madam Pomfrey is in her office. Neville is still unconscious. And Draco stares at Harry. Harry can’t help but to stare back. They should talk. Harry still hasn’t got the chance to thank Draco for saving his life. Or to apologise about the fact that Draco got mixed up in all this. That even now when they don’t speak anymore, aren’t friends anymore, Harry still gets him in trouble.
Professor Lupin was a bit surprised when he saw that Draco was with me during this lesson. He chuckled a little and mumbled something about it being a miracle that Snape was right for once. And then we got down to business. Professor Lupin had brought a Boggart, sure it would turn in a Dementor because that is what I fear the most. He told Draco to stay behind me at all times, that there is no need for the Boggart to turn into his biggest fear again. And I completely agree with that, it’s no fun to see your own dead body on the floor. I still haven’t forgotten the last time and how upset Draco was for days after.
“Dad is going to kill us,” Neville says. He places his arm over his head. “And my head is killing me.”
Draco took me to see the post office and pretended to check the price of sending an owl to America. After that, we visited Zonko’s. We didn’t stay long. The place was so crowded it was hard to move around with the invisibility cloak on. Once we were outside again we decided to find a more secluded spot. Draco kept complaining that it was silly he couldn’t hold my hand. We walked up a slope to visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted place in Britain. It stands a little way above the rest of the village and even in the daylight it’s slightly creepy.
And maybe I shouldn’t have gotten upset, because now I kind of ruined Draco’s birthday. He was crying in his bed when I came back to the dormitory. So I sat down on the side of his bed and said I was sorry, that I hadn’t meant to ruin anything or make it all about me instead of him. And I told him that he was right, we did have bigger things to worry about. Draco sat up next to me and rested his head on my shoulder. He forgave me and told me I could do something nice for his birthday next year. We talked a little after that, about the presents Draco had gotten. He said he missed the amazing birthday cake one of the house elves at home used to make for him for his birthday. And that it was weird not celebrating with his mother and father. I told Draco I never really had a birthday feast or anything, that my aunt and uncle always forgot my birthday. Draco said he would see if I could come over to his house on my birthday, so I could have a cake and everything. I think that’s really nice of him. After that, we talked about how nervous we both were for our exams. Draco’s dad expects him to be top of the class and Draco is sure his father is going to be upset when he finds out that a mudblood witch is doing better than him. I responded with that he would still beat the famous Harry Potter with his grades and that made him laugh.
“Hermione, stay out of this,” Harry says. “You don’t understand. You didn’t grow up with the scars that man caused.”
“I’m right where I’m supposed to be,” Harry tells them. “Breakfast is better here, more food to pick from because you all are always on a diet.”
“Uncle Harry kissed you and then placed his hand on your belly,” Teddy says without any doubt, not taking his eyes of Dragon who is flying above the table. Teddy’s hair has turned the same dark green as the stuffed animal. Andromeda says that Tonks was the same around this age, constantly changing her hair colour without even realising it. It’s a good thing; it means that Teddy is more like his mother than his father. It will make full moons so much easier down the line. Harry had been worried about it once he read about young werewolf children having to go through that change every couple of weeks and how they would get locked up alone to make sure they wouldn’t hurt anyone. Harry said he would never leave Teddy to go through something like that alone. So when Teddy changed his hair colour to platinum about a year ago, when Draco was comforting him after he fell from his little broom, Draco had cried in relief. He wouldn’t have to fear for his lover's life every couple of weeks because he would go and lock himself in with a baby werewolf.
Harry leans against him to comfort him and James puts his arms around both of them. “I know, kiddo. I know. It’s okay. We’ll find him and put him back behind bars, I promise. Just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid and break Lily and Iris’ hearts by dying on us.”
“It might. Maybe there is a simple cause to why we are struggling. And if they can find that and fix it. Isn’t it worth a shot?”
Harry blinks and then spots some Hufflepuff students at the end of the hallway. Justin Finch-Fletchley and Hannah Abbott are among them. They all grin at the scene in front of them. A scene that horrifies Harry. How can they laugh at it? But wait a second. Did Justin just say that Draco stopped Neville?
The house is amazing. There is a clock in the kitchen that doesn’t show the time, but has words written on it like ‘time to make tea’ and ‘You’re late’. And there are Gnomes in the garden that I helped remove on my first day here. Also, the mirrors talk to you. And everyone thinks it’s normal that you can hear small explosions coming from Fred and George room all the time.
When we caught up with Ron and Hermione, Ron had recaptured Scabbers. He was pushing the rat into his pocket while we tried to catch or breath. Not that we really had the change. Neville pulled on my robe and pointed at something big that was bounding towards us. I reached for my wand, but it was too late. An enormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog had pushed me to the ground and for a second I thought I would get ripped apart by the dog. But the dog had leapt to forcefully and had rolled off me. It felt like my ribs were broken and I didn’t think I could get up. Draco was by my side, asking me if I was okay, while Ron, Neville and Hermione all had their wands out and circled around us.
Harry doesn’t pay her any attention. He scans the article on the front page. Pettigrew has been spotted again. This time it was close to Remus and Sirius’ home in Hogsmeade. Harry recognises the street name. This settles it, Pettigrew is on the hunt to hurt the people who put him away. And Harry and Neville have no choice. They need to stop the rat before he hurts any of them.
“Yes, we can try,” Draco says. His voice sounds hollow. It’s just going to be another reminder of how hopeless this whole situation is. But if Harry wants to try, then Draco will do it. Whatever it takes to keep Harry with him as long as possible.
And it was a nightmare, from start to finish. First, she said that if I had been dropped on her doorstep she would have sent me straight to an orphanage. Then Uncle Vernon made me pretend that they use the cane at St. Brutus to please Aunt Marge, who assumed straight away that I probably got beaten all the time. The next couple of days Aunt Marge made sure I stayed close so she could compare me to Dudley and to boom out suggestions for my improvement.
“You know I do,” Hermione says. Sometimes Harry hates her honesty. He doesn’t want to hear that his plan is stupid. It’s the best they could come up with. If this doesn’t work, Harry doesn’t know what else to do.
Stop hijacking my notebook you sophisticated person and let me barbarian in peace. I know Slytherin green isn’t called green, you’ve told me a million times already!
“Maybe, but I won’t let you live if you hurt any of them,” Neville says. “And you know you can’t win. You’ll have to choose. Kill me, or kill Draco? You won’t have time to kill us both.”
Harry pushes his hand through his hair. Neville has a point. Harry is hardly ever alone. He’s always been a people person who likes to have others around. But lately, it has been different. Harry is never alone because Draco is always there. In class, after class, during dinner. They spend all their time together. This time it’s Harry who blushes. He can’t help it. He likes being around Draco.
Draco swallows and nods. He can’t hold back his tears. They stream over his face. “I’m sorry,” he utters. Maybe Granger and Weasley will understand one day. But right now, Draco can’t deal with them. He can’t hear how this is all his fault. How he is the one that killed Harry.
Talking about Quidditch. You remember me telling you that Draco was fighting with his hair the entire match. Well, Daphne showed me how to make a French Braid around the sides of his head so the shorter hairs won’t pull out of the ponytail so easily. And ever since then I’ve been braiding Draco’s hair every morning. First, it was just to practice, so it will be perfect by the time we have to play our next match. But now it’s more because I like doing it, and Draco loves it when I touch his hair and brush my fingers lightly over his head. Daphne says it’s sweet and Greg just thinks it’s a weird gay thing he will never understand.
I went down to listen again, but Draco stayed above the surface. When I got up again I was wondering out loud who wouldn’t be able to use their voices above the ground. Draco and Myrtle both laughed at me. I looked at Draco and he pointed towards the painting on the wall that showed a mermaid sleeping on a rock. And then it all made sense, the song was made by the merpeople. Some times we could see one swimming in the lake through the windows of the common room. And then I turned as white as Myrtle. I hardly know how to swim, let alone be able to breathe underwater for an hour to look for something they took from me. Draco reassured me that we would find a way, that Hermione could help, that she would love the challenge to find a way. He didn’t seem all that worried, he was already guessing what they would steal from me, what it was I would have to retrieve.
“I’m sorry, my Lord. I saw an opportunity and I took it,” Draco answers. He stands up straight and concentrates on his Occlumency. He needs to keep his mind closed. He won’t show the Dark Lord what truly happened, or how he feels about it all. Mother is beside him. She will be the first to die if the Dark Lord finds out. And the Dark Lord tries. There is a knock on Draco’s mind, an attempt to enter and see what happened that day on the Quidditch pitch.
And as you might understand, that was my biggest mistake of the year. Never tell Hermione she needs to teach people. She’s started to put together a plan to show our friends that house-elves are mistreated and that thinks need to change.
Not long after that, a house-elf pops up with some dinner for Harry and James takes his leave, saying he should check in on Iris and Neville and then report back to the big boss (aka mum). He hugs Harry one more time and then he’s off, leaving Harry alone with his thoughts.
Hermione’s teeth are smaller now then they were before Nott made them grow with his stupid spell. She said that madam Pomfrey gave her a mirror when she shrunk Hermione’s teeth and that she told Hermione to tell her when they were back to there normal size. And Hermione just let them become a little less long then they used to be. I know she had been trying to convince her parents for ages to have them shrunk a little, and I’m glad she finally got what she wanted. She’s just a little upset that Ron hasn’t noticed yet. But Draco saved the day for him, by saying that it’s a good thing, that it means that Ron always thought that Hermione was beautiful.
On the evening before the task, we still hadn’t found a way for me to breath underwater. Hermione, Draco and I were buried between books that all seemed useless. And even if we would find a spell, I would still need to learn it overnight. If it wasn’t for the fact that I had no choice but to go into that water I would have given up. Especial when Greg and Daphne stopped by, saying that Professor Snape wanted to see Draco in his office. Draco kissed me and told me to take as many books with me to the dormitory, that we would look the entire night if have to. And then he left, leaving just me and Hermione. Until Fred and George Weasley told Hermione that Professor McGonagall wanted to see her. I kept looking until Madam Pince kicked me out of the library. I took as many books with me that I could carry and settled at a table in the common room to try and find an answer to the most pressing question of the day.
Myrtle wanted to know why I wasn’t dead and I told her we would discuss that some other time. She got upset about that and snapped at me ‘Than what do you want this time’. I asked her where she had seen the pair of great, big, yellow eyes when she died. Myrtle pointed vaguely toward the sink in front of her toilet and Ron and I hurried over to it to investigate. It looked like an ordinary sink; the only thing standing out was a tiny snake on one of the copper taps. Myrtle said the tap has never worked when I turned it. Ron suggested saying something in Parseltongue. I didn’t know if I could since I only managed to do it when faced with a real snake and I’ve never tried otherwise. But after a couple of tries, I managed to say ‘Open up’ in Parseltongue.
