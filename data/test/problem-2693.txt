He figures that Potter had been expecting the same old. A classic Draco smirk with a perfectly practiced amount of disgust and patronization. But that wasn’t his intention, and he’d ventured something more understated. Cordial, even. The innocent bystander might just assume they were vaguely acquainted classmates, and it was in the subtlety that Draco hit his mark.
“It was Draco’s idea, actually.”
“How can you be sure?” Hermione asks.
“Sorry to bother you,” he says, his accent not as heavy as Gabrielle’s. “I’ve been chosen as the liaison for Beauxbatons during our time at Hogwarts, and your headmistress has informed me that you are...what did she call it? Head of the boys?”
“That’s all right, don’t worry about it,” Harry says, but Bill waves him off. “Don’t be ridiculous, sit down, relax! I’ll do yours, at least. Late sleepers face the consequences.” He winks and disappears, leaving Harry alone with Molly.
He splutters for a second. “No, I—it’s just, they didn’t have to do all this just for me.”
“Why do you reckon the Beauxbatons lot are even here?” Ron asks as they wait for dessert, sitting back with his eyes mostly closed.
“No, not yet.”
Hermione interrupts, her tone shot through with horror. “But now, even if the claims Lucius has made against him are false, it’s possible that the crimes he
Right. There it is again, the panic that’s been gently nipping at his nerves for three months, the overwhelming, crushing feeling that closes in from all sides without warning.
“On the most basic level, our blood mixed, which means
“Alright, we’ve made it,” Hermione says, a little breathlessly. “Blindfold’s coming off now.”
“Alright, you can go back to the Owlery now,” he finally says. Artemis doesn’t move and continues to look at him. “I don’t have a response, alright? I need some time.”
, not who he, you know,
“Ah,” she says and smiles, self-conscious. “We will have to learn how to be again, I’m realizing.”
“Fine,” Ginny answers tersely.
Draco startles when there’s a loud pounding at his door. There are frantic voices from the other side, but he only recognizes one. McGonagall.
He then wonders where it is that he’s being housed if not the Hospital Wing. There’s a window in the room, but the way he’s angled only allows him to see open, blue sky, so he can’t even surmise his location based on what’s outside.
Ginny avoids Harry’s eye as she drops off her piece of paper, instead focusing on the conversation she’s having with Luna. Harry sighs, not really sure how he’s feeling about
“Yes, me. Now, tell me what’s happened so we can remedy it.”
“Besides, I think you can agree that socially speaking, wizards are a bit more liberal than Muggles. A lot more forward-thinking. I mean, look at how racial difference is treated by wizards versus Muggles. Sure, it’s occasionally a point of contention for wizards, but Muggles are downright evil when it comes to race a lot of the time.”
“All right,” Hermione repeats, still slightly patronizing. “We’ll be under that big tree, as long as it isn’t already taken.”
just bear with me. Please,” he begs.
No. Not explicitly, anyway. There’s a chance that Harry know something is up, but then again, might there be something going on with Harry as well?
male or female. Maybe he’s just Harry Potter-sexual. Or maybe it’s all an elaborate prank to get back at him for years of torment. No. Harry has never seemed much like the vengeful type, but Draco has changed plenty since the end of the war. Is it possible that Harry has, too?
Harry gives him a look, because how could they not tell her everything?
“Which you
“No promises,” Harry says, and they’re off.
There had been no destination in mind when he Apparated, so the fact that he’s made it anywhere with all of his extremities is something of a victory.
“Did you think I was some kind of monster?” she asks, and her lips are still curled slightly upward. “I have always wondered if you were different, Draco. We never spoke of romance together, so I certainly had an idea.”
Well. Hold on. Draco works through the timeline. Harry’s last lesson with the fifth and sixth years would have been the previous Thursday, if Draco is remembering his schedule correctly. That was the morning when Draco had convinced Harry to come down into the dungeons with him. Shit. Was it true, and, even worse, was it his fault?
Harry?”
“No, stop, that’s not the point. I’m dealing with that on my own and all that. But I’m guessing you’ve sort of been wondering how I’ve been after…everything.”
Leon nods. “She’s clearly going through something. Think about this scenario from her perspective. In the last fifteen minutes, you’ve told her you’re gay, told her you have a boyfriend, and then asked her to be his date to a school function. That’s a lot to process all at once.”
can,” Hermione chimes in, trying to help diffuse the tension as she looks up from a textbook she’s already started to read.
They enter together and the door swings shut and the Room of Hidden Things stretches out before them, myriad in its size and contents.
“I risk sounding like mum when I say it, but do you
“I need to go,” she says more firmly, but he shakes his head.
we break up? What if I’m suddenly single again? After you asked me to that dance, it forced me to see what I was trying so hard to block out.”
“Yeah. Me too,” she says quietly, picking at one of her nails as she looks down.
“I think I may have technically soiled your status as a Pureblood,” he says, the smile fleeing. Potter’s eyes are glued to the floor. “You know, because I had to have so much of our blood mix for the spell to work. I know in terms of bloodline in doesn’t make a difference, but I know there are some cases where something minor like that actually makes a difference…”
“It is indeed so. I think I should have a talk with myself about self-sabotage. The point is, I’m realizing now that a lot of that excitement was only born out of the fact that it was the first real relationship I’ve ever had with another bloke, you know? And something about that fact alone felt so right. It probably could’ve been anybody and I would’ve felt the same.”
“DON’T ANY OF YOU CARE THAT HARRY POTTER HAS BEEN PLACED IN CHARGE OF US?!”
Harry narrows his eyes at him, about to open his mouth.
“I know, I’m…not…sorry?”
“Damn,” Draco mutters. “But what does it matter if they know I’m at Hogwarts? If I play my cards right, I can be there and gone before the Ministry even realizes I’m there.”
It looks like a serpent. The form is hazy around the body, but the head is serpentine: fangs, slits for nostrils, unblinking eyes. The room is silent and Draco wonders if he’s left his body, but then he realizes everyone is staring at him.
Draco scrambles out of the squashy chair as fast as he can and bolts into the hallway, whipping his head in the direction of the commotion. He doesn’t see her at first; she’s up against the wall, writhing and lashing her limbs. As he gets closer, he realizes there are black vines wrapped around her midsection and neck. They’re something between solid and liquid, by the looks of them. Another vine bursts from the wall and wraps itself around her mouth, and when Draco sprints up to her and her eyes widen as her head shakes.
“Ron’s weird focus on your relationship aside,” Hermione says, narrowing her eyes at him in disbelief, “unfortunately I think your best option is to wait for it to blow over. Now can we go downstairs? I haven’t eaten since breakfast,” she says, breezing out of the room.
“Oh, please, you’d be dead already. Hold still,” she commands.
“Did things not go well?”
“I—what?” Harry says, his next thought derailed by Draco’s question. “Am I?”
He continues to try to pull his legs upward, leaning against the wall next to him for support. Before he can react, the wall follows suit, living stone grasping his wrist. He gasps in pain as it rubs against the bones in his slim wrist, quickly grabbing his wand with his other hand before it’s consumed as well.
Damn it. “I already promised Ron I would spend the afternoon with him. Maybe after dinner?”
Draco blinks at him. “She most definitely is not.”
Harry nods, feeling oddly appreciative of that. He thinks for a second. “Leon,” he starts and takes a deep breath, “we’ve all had to do things,
“Harry,” Draco says.
Harry watches as Leon makes his way up the staircase of the boys’ tower, still marveling at his surroundings. He then collapses into an armchair next to the dying fire, his mouth dry and his eyes heavy. He makes a futile attempt to sift through all of his emotions, but gives up as his eyes start to fight their open status and trudges up the stairs himself.
“BLOODY ACTING PREFECT? IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE?!”
“We’ve talked about this already. I don’t want to get into the past and all of that bullshit. If you think I have some kind of ulterior motive—”
Draco smiles and releases a shaky breath. His pulse starts to relax now that she has. Before he can begin, a small group of Gryffindor girls crosses through the courtyard. One of them notices Hermione and rushes over. She gives Draco a disapproving but fleeting look.
“Just trust me!”
Leon laughs, shaking his head. “I can, but
“I guess we’re even,” Draco says.
is not aware of the relevant details from recent events.”
“It seems Hogwarts is fighting back. Something in the castle doesn’t want us here.”
“Oh, and Draco?” Harry says as he opens the door to leave. “Please, just call me Harry. You say my last name like it’s a bloody unforgivable curse, and I’ve heard enough of those for a lifetime.” The door swings shut and Draco’s head collapses back onto the pillow. He’s going to need an appointment with Mari.
FINALLY, just an exciting life update, a couple weeks ago I committed to a grad program!!!!!! I'll be going for an MFA in creative writing and I am BEYOND beyond excited about it. Like, this is what I'm doing with my life? Absolutely unreal. That being said, I'm going to try to work on this fic as much as I can over the summer, as I'm not sure what kind of time I'll be able to dedicate come fall. Regardless, I hope my return after a multi-month hiatus shows that I'm really committed to finishing this. Your comments also really help motivate me and remind me why I love doing this so much, so please leave one if you're enjoying this!!! OK, enough from me. Be well everyone :) <3
feel normal. Harry stands at the head of the room, watching students his age file into the room and situate themselves in the rows of desks that face him. It’s both a comfort and a nerve-chewer to see so many familiar faces, and a good amount of former DA members are present. Hermione’s words of advice echo in his mind:
“Fine,” Harry says and flashes his teeth. “Couldn’t sleep,” he explains. “Been thinking about…things.”
“Right, to defend myself from Dementors, but that’s beside the point. If I was able to come out the other side with Fudge and Umbridge running the show, I think we’ll manage with Kingsley Shacklebolt.”
Harry smiles as he steps forward, giving Ron a hopeful nod and facing the crowd. He can hear Hermione screeching from the stands.
Mari beams up at him. “Draco! I wasn’t expecting you, was I?”
is a reopening of Wizard Wheezes), Arthur is off at work, of course, and Percy and Charlie have long since moved out. Still, something about their vacancy this morning weighs heavily. Of course there’s one in particular, which Harry still tries not to think of much.
“Hi,” Leon says.
She scoffs. “Do you even hear yourself? You’re
“Sure, Harry,” Hermione says with a little smile. “We’ll keep guard. If something happens, we’re coming in, through. And we’ll give you ten minutes until we follow either way.”
She purses her lips, nodding. “Duly noted. Good work.”
When things have settled, Draco takes a deep breath, trying to stop his head from spinning. He’s grateful to still be in bed, as he feels faint, and quite feels like crying himself for some reason. His throat is sore from the effort of not allowing himself too. That would be foolish. Everything is fine now.
Harry takes another step forward and jabs his finger into Draco’s chest. “Why were you following him?”
When he tries to continue and take a step forward, he frowns when there’s a strange resistance from beneath him. Not enough to prevent motion, but definitely enough that he notices. He takes a step forward. Turns around. Lowers his lit wand to the ground. Frowns.
“Hermione taught me that I have to compartmentalize things,” Harry says. “I guess I did that too well?”
McGonagall lays a hand on his upper arm. “That’s quite all right,” she says, even though it isn’t. “You did what had to be done. Just like you always do.”
“Gentlemen, as I’m sure you can imagine, we don’t have time to chat,” Rowan says, and something in Harry latches onto the flicker of worry in his eyes as they dart toward the Great Hall. Rowan’s voice remains even, cold, but there’s trepidation beneath the icy surface. “Harry, if you would set down your wand and come join us.”
“How do you mean?”
“Well, alright then. It’s just a bit out of the blue, you know? Not only do you like blokes, but you’re actually going
She blinks. “Bit of a change of topic, but, honestly, Harry? I think he’ll be absolutely fine with it. He respects you so much, and he’s your

“We’re still in the way.”
“It’s been rather odd, not hearing from

“We have to do something.”
“But wizards make up for
“Ready?” comes Hermione’s voice from next to him as her arm loops into his.
Luna’s fault, Ginny. I asked her not to tell anybody.”
It’s a little outlandish, yes. After all, this is someone Draco’s age, someone who purports himself to be close to Harry, to
Her wand jumps out of her hand. Leon catches it. His lips come unsealed with a
Draco exhales. “Just a couple of minutes. How are you doing?”
Draco’s skin practically separates itself from his body when the headmistress calls out, “Excuse me, I have an update!” The crowd goes dead silent. “The student has been found. She is in need of medical attention but will be fine once she is tended to.” She stops, licks her lips. “No attacker was located, but we will continue looking for the time being. I apologize for disrupting your afternoon. I hope you’re still able to enjoy your time in Hogsmeade.”
Harry nods, impressed. Leon utters a quiet “Ohh,” of realization next to him.
his gaze, really; it was just by pure luck that their eyes had met across the station. Three years prior, there would’ve been a petty glaring tournament. And only one year ago…
“Ginny, I’m gay.”
“Yes!”
. He would really put it in the past, just like that. Draco’s been working himself into a fit about how he’s going to start convincing the world he isn’t still trying to end it, and Harry Potter had been at the top of that list. Or, maybe the bottom. It depends what the list is. Harry would be at the top of the list of people Draco
Harry hasn’t even been back at the Burrow for twenty-four hours, and now he’s about to initiate a conversation that could ruin years of his relationship with Molly Weasley, all before breakfast.
Harry gulps and nods. “I guess you could say that. I don’t want to think about it yet, though. Let’s just eat now.”
He wonders how Harry does it. Quidditch, Dumbledore’s Army, teaching Defense classes… He manages to be firm and taken seriously, but he also has a warmth to him. A brightness, a welcoming quality that makes people
Should he follow? Should he go warn McGonagall? He’s aware that she’s likely busy with organizing the Hogsmeade trip; it’s required a bit of extra attention given the parental backlash following the news of Hogwarts’ slow self-destruction. It’s only the day after her official announcement, but concerned parents are somehow able to get their owls to fly faster, it seems.
The sound of a thousand whip cracks ignites the air but Harry still doesn’t understand because his eyes are ironed shut and his lungs can’t fill with air because it’s all rushing forth from his mouth in wails until a pair of arms wrap around the tremors that he calls shoulders and a chin nests in the space between collarbone and jaw.
Harry gulps, because
She makes a noise in the back of her throat and chews at one of her thumbnails. “Nothing concrete. I thought I knew so much about this castle, but clearly I’ve only scratched the surface.”
Leon shakes his head, sniffling. “I tried to think that way at first, but it’s just too hard. I can’t keep going on expecting to see her again. So I...my parents are already mourning her, like she’s
an apology.”
“I…” Draco hasn’t had time to consider this yet. “Not long, I don’t think. I don’t know what kind of investigation might still be going on, and I don’t want to risk being there if someone does show up.”
“Please, sit, sit! Make yourselves at home!”
Things take an exciting turn when Hermione lets out a shriek, causing Harry to drop half a piece of toast into a glass of orange juice. She jumps out of her chair and runs to the window, pointing at the sky.
Mari shifts on the edge of her desk. The room is full of Monday morning sunlight and the smell of the grounds of Hogwarts pours in through open windows.
Ron sits up again, his brow knit slightly. “It’s not serious, is it?”
Harry ignores her. “The point is, I think both of you could and would get dates if you wanted to. This is not about that. I’m asking, as your friend, if you’d be willing to help us out.”
He’s unsure if anybody is even around to hear; nobody had come when Mari screamed the first time, after all. Draco takes a deep breath, tries to fill his body with false positivity as he screams “
Again, a bit of a shock, but a pleasant one.
“Don’t have access to any of those, either,” he says with much less levity in his voice. He turns and shoots Draco a glance imperceptible to anybody else. Draco merely nods in response.
Draco chuckles in agreement, not taking his eyes off Potter as he approaches McGonagall and says something to her subtly. “I suppose he’s just accustomed to privilege,” he responds.
McGonagall finishes: “Thank you for your attention. Enjoy your dessert,” and before she’s even returned to her seat the Hall erupts into chatter.
“My suggestion is take what you would’ve taken if being an Auror were still your goal. There’s a lot of overlap for what most professions will want to see in terms of N.E.W.T.s, and if you decide you want to do something and you haven’t taken a necessary class, there are ways we can work around it. A lot of the eighth years are in the same position, so the Ministry has asked that employers be a bit more flexible as well.”
,” she whispers, and suddenly her dreamy voice is filling the common room and couples are pulling away from each other with red lips and wide eyes.
“I…” Draco says, unable to form words. His voice sounds far off, like an echo of a whisper, rebounding off the barren walls of Harry’s insides.
Harry
The aspect of his father’s disappearance that makes it so gut-twisting is the secrecy of it all. The Ministry had, in fact, come in search of Lucius shortly after his hasty departure. Not feeling much loyalty to him after making some realizations and having time to reflect on the past few years, Draco had cooperated as much as he could, giving the Aurors all the information he had. He’d even volunteered to do it under Veritaserum.
Harry rolls his eyes, grabbing his broom. “I wasn’t lying to you, Ron. I just don’t see her that way anymore.”
, Pansy. We chose a side in that war, and it was the wrong bloody one,” he says, refusing to break eye contact. “Owning up to that feels like leaving behind everything we ever stood for, because it is. As I have already mentioned, the whole world practically changed overnight. I’m done with all of this petty, baseless hatred. Yes, I’m going to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts from the person who single-handedly defeated the Dark Lord, the very same Dark Lord
“Whatever this is, we can’t see it through without you,” he says, tears gushing from his eyes. “Just. Make it back. Please.”
Harry smiles, his heart fluttering strangely. “Well, thanks. I still haven’t made a decision, but I’m definitely considering it.”
you. Merlin, even
“Somebody entered your house for the first time in years. I assumed it was you because of the way the enchantments work, but I had to be sure. What did you learn there?”
“Not really. Every time I close my eyes, I just see the Great Hall…”
Ron leans forward to talk around Harry. “Anybody specific we should be on the lookout for?”
Another pause. “In all likelihood, we won’t be back in session until next September.”
an option?”
“I just don’t understand
“Okay, not quite. I have an ex who was a really good listener but was never able to respond with such insight as yours.”
“I think that’s enough practice for today,” Harry finally says. His voice is tight and a notch higher than usual, as if he can feel the same level of pressure that’s nested between Draco’s lungs.
“All right, so she saw that you had moved on and decided that it was better not to fight it and accept that things weren’t going to be the way they were before.”
“First off, a lot of it was luck. I was in the right place at the right time, and I did the right thing. The fact that the Hogwarts way is to blow every piece of news well out of proportion happened to work in my favor. But really, things started changing when I decided I wanted them to, Pansy. I’ve started seeing a therapist.”
He wants to smack himself in the forehead. Must he be so transparent?
Before either of them can change their mind, Harry turns on the spot and pulls Draco into darkness, both of them rushed together, squeezed, pressed, and then a moment later there’s a feeling of expansion and Draco is on his feet again, hand clenching Harry’s tightly.
“But that was my fault.”
“No, it’s…it’s Pansy, actually,” Blaise says, suddenly fascinated by his own hands in his lap.
“Are you sure everything is fine? I won’t push you anymore, but you seem distracted.”
The problem is, he can’t stop thinking about the conversation he’d had with…Harry. Right, Harry. It’s still odd thinking of him that way. For years, they’d been on a strict and vicious last-name basis, and he’d just come in and blown that to bits.
Two others have joined the group in the center: Luna Lovegood and Ginny Weasley. Draco tries to make eye contact with them but their eyes are locked on Harry and Hermione, concern painted across their lips. Draco wants to feel something but when he turns inward there’s only white noise that echoes and echoes, so he flips on the rational side of his brain and steps toward the others.
“I’ve been told.”
“Well, perfect. Very happy to have you on board, Mister Malfoy. Hopefully people’s attitudes will adjust over the next few weeks. There isn’t much I can do in terms of public address at the moment, but I think this new appointment will be enough to make the appropriate waves.”
He’ll write to her, at the very least. He’s suddenly been given an incredible gift: insurmountable free time. If she’s okay with it, he’ll gladly visit. The old Draco might not have bothered. But then again, the old Draco never would have agreed to see a mind healer in the first place, let alone a more classical therapist.
Draco swallows hard. Of course nobody wants to be in Slytherin. He’s already thought about it, about how exposed the returning Slytherins would be this year. Though he certainly hadn’t anticipated the number being quite this thin. It feels like treading in open water, sharks gathering around an open wound. Would the overall anti-Slytherin attitude actually prevent anybody from being sorted in? What if it truly is a dying House?
to be, maybe. The world has never looked more right than in this moment, with this boy looking up at him with stars in his eyes, seeming fragile but actually strong in ways nobody else even knows.
“But your mother—“
Harry inhales deeply again, and Leon must sense his nerves because his hand is squeezing Harry’s knee.
Hermione laughs, a real laugh, and it’s a sound Draco once detested but has now been dyed a different color by the golden light of the afternoon. “You’re quite funny,” she says. He’s grateful she doesn’t sound
Once everybody has their wand back, they go through two more rounds of disarming each other, some students feeling bold and attempting to catch their opponents’ wands. A few are successful, including Ginny and Luna, who are partnered up. Ron gets close but nearly pokes his eye out with Hermione’s wand, which bounces off his forehead.
Leon takes a breath in, then huffs. “I don’t really want to talk about what happened in the beginning. I think we were both hurting in different ways. Maybe my pain was only because of yours, sure. But something I’ve been thinking about is that life is too short to let something like that stop us. You’ve come round. I see how genuinely apologetic you are about everything. Plus, I can see where you were coming from. You already have the eyes of the entire wizarding public on you at all times, and coming down off such a time of turmoil and instability, another big shift in your life was scary. I really do sympathize with that, just like I mentioned in my letter. Before, I wasn’t putting all of the pieces together, Which is why I’ve decided to forgive you. However, you’ll have to understand if I want to remain cautious. Because I don’t want to get hurt again.”
“Are you saying you have a plan?”
“Well then when? Because I’m not an idiot, and you’ve been avoiding me all—”
Harry laughs quietly. “That’s fine, people will be willing to steer you in the right direction if you get lost. Do you know what room you’re in?”
Harry scoffs, faux offense splashed on his face. “I’ll give you three centimeters,
thinking, and not enough deciding? It’s hard to tell. Lately, it seems like emotions have been bubbling to the surface of his mind, threatening to spill over and stain his status quo. It isn’t until he’s leaving the room that things start to click. He bumps into another student and mutters a quick “sorry” before allowing her to pass by, and it’s this one word that makes his heart sink like a bezoar dropped down a well.
“Sure. You have work to do, if I remember correctly?”
But he realizes at this moment that no matter what, as hard as he tries, he can’t deny this new, jarring reality. Harry Potter likes men.
“Sure! Great!” Harry says. He hopes he doesn’t sound as astounded as he feels.
“Why would I be angry? Whatever you did, it saved me. I’m still here, aren’t I? Unless I
“What?” he says automatically. “Absolutely not.”
“It’s all just very strange and new, isn’t it? I’m…gay.” He shivers. “It’s going to take a lot of time to properly grow into it, I think.”
Draco laughs again, the sound seeping into the walls. Harry Potter, ever the optimist. “How do you do it? Stay so hopeful about everything?”
Even the hypothetical makes his chest ache. “Sure,” Harry says, “something like that.”
“Have you heard the latest news? The Whomping Willow is destroying itself.”
Leon finally pulls on his shirt, then closes the gap between them. “Never,” he says, then kisses Harry. It’s chaste and it’s light and it says
“Is that all that happened?”
“You’ll be captain, I hope?”
have fallen regardless of this echo chamber of emotion that’s shelled around them, now that this is their reality, is it realistic to go into a relationship knowing there are no secrets, no hiding anything? And isn’t the joy of being with someone the differences, the ways you can ultimately unite fundamental, inherent discrepancies? It just doesn’t seem sustainable to Harry. But, like all things, it’s possible the link’s influence will dwindle over time. Still, he has to consider that proceeding with utmost caution will be crucial, especially since Draco isn’t even aware of what’s going on.
Draco’s heart skips a beat, maybe it’s two, and he splutters an answer. “I—well, yes, but I can’t prove anything yet. Why, do you think the same thing?”
Another nod. “Keep the hair tie,” she says.
“Harry has a point,” Hermione says as she bites at the tines of her fork. “Magic is unpredictable. And normal isn’t really in Harry’s wheelhouse, or ours, by extension. Plus, with Beauxbatons being here, things haven’t been normal to being with. No offense,” she says.
Draco hums. “Could be. I’m romantically attracted to you, aren’t I?”
“All I’m saying is that only people who’re Muggle-born would be naive enough to let themselves be sorted into Slytherin. And even then, the train ride is plenty of time for the other Houses to put ideas in their heads.”
“Are you alright?” she asks after a few moments.
Call it wishful thinking, but as Hermione gives him one last smile and leaves him alone in an empty corridor, Draco could swear that there’s encouragement in her eyes.
“I figured you weren’t simply glad to see me.”
ANYWAY please enjoy and again I am sorry for such a gap between chapters <333
Harry feels a seed of guilt starting to sprout. “Leon, are you sure you’re alright with keeping this a secret for a bit? I know that keeping something like this—whatever it is—a secret can be really detrimental. Especially because you’re already more or less out. It introduces a whole set of issues that I hadn’t even really thought about until just now.”
“Harry! So proud of you!” Hermione says, bounding up to him and kissing him on the cheek.
“Oh?” Leon says, his brows coming together in confusion.
“No, no, thank you Harry. You did very well, today, you know? Handled all of that with a lot of grace. Actually, now that I think of it, would you mind escorting Mister Malfoy here back into the real world?”
Leon smiles at him, his eyes twinkling. “I don’t blame you. There are so many twists and turns. And those moving staircases?” He laughs, shaking his head. “I can’t even imagine how easy it is to lose yourself here.”
He leans forward and laughs, forehead gently knocking against Harry’s. “Oh so formal, Mister Potter. But I think we can arrange for that. Speaking of, how will I know when you’ll be coming around next?” Draco asks this as if they’re just a couple of old friends checking in on each other, and not like he’s a wanted criminal hiding from the authorities.
Draco clears his throat. “We still need to wait for first years to get sorted,” he says to her evenly.
“You just undermined yourself in front of the whole class regarding the very lesson you’re teaching.”
. It’s a very Slytherin move of her, Harry feels. Because suddenly his friends are gone and he’s left alone with Leon in the middle of the Quidditch pitch.
“So you’re
Draco isn’t sure why he’s shocked. Despite her eccentric and at times even flighty demeanor, she
Ginny rolls her eyes. “Not possible. Team members have to span at least three Houses, and they haven’t specified whether or not that also includes Beauxbatons.”
“Is back to normal. That was a temporary enchantment, meant to eventually be broken when you returned. It was designed to maintain and preserve the house as it was.
Harry shrugs. “I’m, er, just glad we cleared it up.”
“It would be such a shame to have to end his life after how useful he’s been, wouldn’t it? His blood isn’t pure, but I’d consider making an exception. A reward for my tool, my extension.”
of horrible things. I’ve put you and the people you love in danger countless times. I harped on your blood status because I was stupid and uneducated and threatened by you, and I can’t imagine how much pain and suffering you’ve endured because of my actions alone. I really do regret all of it. I know I can never really make up for everything, but I hope you believe that I would if I could. And the fact that you’re even allowing me to sit in front of you and say all of this is really gracious of you. So. Thank you. And I’m sorry.”
“Listen to me,” Harry says gently and takes Draco’s face in his hands. “The Ministry has much more to worry about than jailing the kids of war criminals, whatever their past might hold. And in proving that you had nothing to do with your father’s disappearance, we’ll also be showing how much you’ve changed as a person, even in the short time since everything ended. I know it isn’t easy, but your father doesn’t have power over you anymore, Draco. The right people are in charge, and the law will protect you.”
“Of course! By no means am I trying to
“And he knows?”
Leon giggles. “I’m just good at managing my time, that’s all.”
“Maybe so, but there’s something so rewarding about a bit of sweaty, hands-on work.”
“My thinking is that I should do some reconnaissance and confirm his sexuality by talking to somebody close to him. I figure my chances of a successful proposition increase if he actually likes men.”
So inordinate is an exaggeration, sure. But it’s much more work than Harry feels he should have as an eighth year. Perhaps having to focus on lesson plans adds more to his load than he’d anticipated, but even with that aside, their professors have not been lenient as was expected.
The six of them stare at Harry Potter as he awkwardly half-leans into the compartment, clearly thrown off by the sight of its occupants.
Harry forces himself to move forward, gripping the door frame as he peers into what’s left of the room. Even if he had survived the Curse itself, it feels like a miracle he also survived the apparently explosive aftermath. Of course, now he knows the full implications of that night and understands that it was no miracle that kept him alive, but a fraction of the very soul that tried to destroy his own.
“But…you and Ginny…”
“So what is it that you wanted to talk about, Harry?” Hermione asks, turning over her shoulder.
“Just…” Harry starts, purposely bringing his voice down, “stay away from me. I don’t want you in my life anymore. Not right now. What you just did…” Harry shakes his head and turns away, bringing a hand to his eyes. Draco’s heart drops when he sees that Harry is crying now, too.
“Hello, you two. Sorry to be blunt, but Luna, would you happen to have a date for the ball?”
Anyway, if he does happen to be discovered skulking around, his plan is to claim that he’s on official Prefect business. Most people are instantly turned off by that, he’s already found.
“Er, Professor,” Draco says. “I don’t think she’s in any condition to be taking the Gryffindors upstairs. I can drop off the Hufflepuffs and then take them.”
“So! We’ll go back and forth just trying to get
Somebody shifts on the other side of the room and all four of them turn to see if they’ve been listened too. Once it’s clear that no eavesdropping has occurred, Ginny inhales to speak.
“Good! You deserve to feel good, that was the most fun I’ve ever had in a Defense Against the Dark Arts class.” Something in his voice tells Harry that he means it. “Harry, would you mind going on a quick walk with me once you’re all done here? I just have some things that I wanted to talk to you about.”
“And Marcus and I—Marcus...is my friend—we somehow managed to capture another Death Eater. We had our wands up against his throat, and I can't believe I actually did that but... What else were we supposed to do? I tried to bargain with the first one, I told him, ‘You give me back my sister, and we’ll let your friend go.’ He just...he laughed, and he said that he didn’t care what happened to his friend. I couldn’t tell if he was bluffing or not, but I wasn’t in my right mind, so I…”
Another massive crunch behind them; Harry realizes he’s up to his ankles in bloody water, freezing cold and flowing down the corridor. It parts around Rowan and Pamela and comes back together as it passes. The smell is metallic, rotten, like something ancient bleeding out. Harry spares the quickest of glances over his shoulder and sees that liquid is oozing from between the cracks in stones, in gaps of rubble, not just red but pitch black, bubbling.
to damage, to cut. “That’s a lie. I do, I know you, Harry,” Draco says. His voice is heavy, like something is stuck in his throat. “You can admit it or not, but I see who you are, maybe better than he ever will. You’re strong, and you’re clever, and you’re maybe a little too trusting, and you love too hard, and that’s why you’re in this situation—”
Draco nods, sold by that logic. Hermione starts to hum to herself. Draco cranes his neck and watches as she conjures a few things behind him: scissors, a comb, a spray bottle, and a sort of smock.
“Harry,” she says. Things are still a bit rocky. It’s fair, given the last time they’d really spoken Harry had not been particularly tactful. And what he and Draco had done was stupid; he knew it when it happened, and he sees it even more now.
“Certainly not,” McGonagall agrees. “But this proposes other problems. Any Hogwarts student who may have been on the wrong side of the war—for whatever reason, that’s not the point—was given a sort of pass from the Minister. It was already such a task to round up and try all of the adults involved, so Kingsley decided to consider any young people absolved of their crimes. He instructed me to keep a special eye on them, but in any case, they wouldn’t be in any official legal trouble with the Ministry. Of course, Draco was one such student.”
“And you think I’m indebted to you or something?”
Harry scans the classroom, only a few stragglers remaining. He watches Malfoy as everybody else finishes up, wondering what could possibly be taking him so long. He’s not fully clear on the blond’s work ethic, especially when it comes to a Potter-taught Defense class. Sure enough Malfoy is eventually the last person in the room.
Ginny screams, “
“The headmistress told me what happened and I got here as soon as I could. I…” She isn’t able to finish as she finally gets a good look at Draco, her legs refusing to hold her up any longer as she collapses into the chair that Potter—Harry—had been sitting in earlier. He isn’t sure if there’s any damage to his face, but he
Draco cringes at this, already awaiting the reactions. There’s surprisingly nothing verbal, but Pansy makes a sort of half-choking noise and Blaise looks up from his book for the first time since Draco entered the compartment. And then the door is closed, and Pansy Parkinson explodes.
“But you’ve heard about the…all of the things I’ve done?”
. Well—kisses, plural, really. His lips tingle at the thought, that at any given moment he could lean in and do it again. And again. Again.
Madam Pomfrey rolls her eyes as she changes the sheets on the nearest bed, which has been recently relinquished. “She’ll be fine, boy. Go enjoy your afternoon. I think I’ve seen enough of you this term, haven’t I?”
“You have no idea what you’re talking about, do you?”
He chuckles again, a giddy feeling bubbling up inside him. “That’s the question, isn’t it?”
Harry nods. “More than anyone, honestly.”
“Yes, everything’s fine.”
“I know I’ve said and done some horrible things.”
“A bit,” he says with a grin. “Might be best to wash up before class starts.”
“What Harry
“What do you mean?”
“I’ve had plenty of practice pretending to be asleep,” Potter says, not at all angry about it, oddly enough.
“When did you even have time to present this to McGonagall?” Harry asks.
“Alright.”
to believe that, you have to believe that he did it all for a reason and that he wouldn’t change a thing, even if he could.”
“Huh,” Harry says, his brow furrowed. He stares at the tiled floor as he moves away from the wall and pulls out a chair of his own from the kitchen table. He sits, his shoulders hunched. “Blimey. You might be right.”
“Brilliant,” Harry says, scratching the back of his neck. “I, er, appreciate it. And I’m sorry that you’re still hurting about things.” The words don’t feel like they mean anything, but it does feel like the right thing to say.
“Good. I’m fresh out of fight at the moment,” Ron says, causing them all to laugh. “We agreed on Exploding Snap later, don’t forget,” he says as Harry and Hermione separate.
Harry grins. “It really did. Those other teams aren’t gonna know what hit them.”
He raises an eyebrow. “You know who I am, right? Who my family is?”
“Brilliant,” Draco says, turning and looking down the table at her. “So, where were we?”
“There’s a Slytherin compartment down near the end,” she says, ignoring his response.
“Everybody write five reasons or scenarios in which nonverbal casting would be more beneficial than verbal.” He pauses. “
Potter’s little half smile melts away. “Quite truthfully, it’s all I’ve heard about all bloody morning. I would love to avoid talking about it.”
Hermione shushes him, both of them looking over their shoulders to see Malfoy still working on his parchment. He shows no indication of hearing their conversation, though, so Ron continues quietly.
“Oi, there he is, coming in now,” Ron says and points toward the Hall’s entrance.
Harry nods, his brain spinning in a whirlpool in his skull. He shakes himself out of his stupor and jumps up. “I have to go right away. I have to see him.”
“I’m just…so scared that somehow you’ll slip away,” Harry whispers. It hits Draco like a hex in the gut, his throat sore from the effort of not crying. “We’ve come so far, and what if it’s all for nothing?”
“What?” Hermione asks.
“Be right here,” Draco responds.
“There’s something else as well.”
. I’m just the instrument through which you can comprehend the happenings of your own life.”
“How the hell did you get in here?”
Draco rolls his eyes, going back to his eggs. He’d never known Blaise to buy into conspiracies—especially ones started by first years.
His heart drops into his gut. He’d forgotten. A bright white scar lays gently across his palm, fully healed. Permanent.
“Mother,” he says, throat dry.
“A silly little club that saved the lives of many of your classmates, Potter.”
He reaches the top, facing a gaping hole. His room had been right at the top of the stairs.
“Come to gloat?” Draco says on instinct.
had that was free of animosity, though he reckons it might just be because Potter had been so flustered. Draco wouldn’t blame him if he still hated him; after everything he’d done it actually felt a bit strange that Potter would be willing to talk to him at all.
I’m cleared…I have no idea what happens next.”
As expected, his Patronus refuses to take form, but he manages to conjure a silver ball that shoots down the hallway.
the one who demanded that a kiss be part of the negotiation. I agree that it would really help sell things, but it’s still a bizarre request.”
The door to Madam Pomfrey’s room flies open and the world bursts into chaos. Madam Pomfrey herself is there, carefully ushering in a younger looking student who is obviously the source of the screaming. His entire body is covered in black flames, and he can barely walk. He collapses onto the ground as soon as he enters.
“We need to talk.”
Part of him wants to be. Might it not be easier, not to feel it all anymore? To just surrender, let them take what they want? This thought is almost warming, almost cuts through the bone-chill that has every one of his hairs standing up. He could be done. He wouldn’t have to worry about what people think anymore, who he hurts along the way. It could all just be…over.
Draco takes a deep breath and allows the knot that had formed in his chest to unfurl. Novel emotions are not a rare occurrence these days. It doesn’t make them any less off-putting.
“But now it just looks like he’s guilty of
“I know,” Draco says, hugging his knees tighter. “I forgive you. I’m sorry, too.”
of whatever evil bullshit could be down there? Tell. Me.”
But Harry smiles, because he understands completely. Across the table he meets Hermione’s eye; there’s a flash of something there, but she doesn’t say anything to him. He quickly looks away, clearing his throat.
The other boy Draco noticed is approaching Potter now, shaking his hand cheerfully. Potter’s gaze briefly travels in the direction of the Slytherin table and Draco looks away quickly.
“Apologize?”
“Was I here?” he asks slyly.
Pansy returns eventually, looking more placid but still ruffled. She makes a point to sit as far away from Draco as she can when she enters the compartment. He simply quirks an eyebrow at her and chuckles through his nose, wondering how she can possibly be so childish. The ride is painfully quiet, save for the occasional frantic whispering between Joetta and David.
“There are other areas of the castle that are still badly damaged and will be off limits. These are well-marked and protected by enchantments, and I must ask that you respect this and attempt to find other ways to navigate until we can return the castle to her former glory.”
She pauses, pursing her lips slightly. “This will come as a disappointment to many of you, but we will not be competing for a House Cup this year.”
Draco shifts in his seat to see who it is. Harry Potter pokes his head in the door. “I know I’m a bit early, so I hope I’m not—Oh! Hello, Draco.”
“I don’t understand,” he says.
“I understand your concern,” Harry says slowly and looks up to the castle, “and I do share that concern. But it’s like I told you. I don’t think it was ever really Leon I wanted to be with.” He senses, rather than sees, Hermione and Ron exchange a look. “I’m just.” He licks his lips, tries to find the words. “I’m trying to turn this into something that’s not tainted from the beginning. Maybe it’ll blow up in my face, and it might just end up with both of us getting hurt, but if something
Draco flops face-first onto his bed. He wants to hex himself. That was the moment, surely, no? Not that Harry seems the type to pull such a classic I’m-going-to-come-up-behind-you move (although, Draco is starting to question his view of Harry altogether), but that’s exactly what it had been, wasn’t it?
“Do we think this is it?”
“And I, her,” Draco says.
“Healing isn’t ever something I’d considered. My parents…”
for you. And I thought…maybe you felt the same way.”
McGonagall turns to them, terse and terrified. The room is silent for a moment—save for a spitting fire—and she says, “Lucius Malfoy has been captured.”
“How was he able to enter your house when it’s protected by wards that even I would have trouble bypassing? I think you know. Think back to what happened on your eighteenth birthday.”
,” dousing the boy and extinguishing the flames completely. Oddly, his clothes are untouched, but his skin is red and blistered everywhere. Madam Pomfrey calls for someone to bring one of the cots into the room for him as McGonagall casts some lightweight drying charms.
There’s a knock at the door and Ginny enters before anybody answers. She glances between the three of them, looking confused.
He doesn’t remember mirroring Draco’s arm placement but he’s suddenly aware of the mutual embrace, warm and comforting despite the cold cruelty of the uneven stones beneath them. Their breathing has synchronized, and when he feels tears drip onto the skin of his neck from the other boy’s face he finally enters himself once more.
“Today’s lesson will be Patronuses!”
From that moment on, Harry actually has a lovely time. For the first time at a Hogwarts dance he doesn’t feel so self conscious; even Ron stays on the dance floor with Hermione for most of the night, and when he’s not it’s just because he’s eating. Leon, Luna, and Harry have formed a sort of triangle, which Ginny never does join. About halfway through the night Ron pats his pockets and frowns, asks everybody if they’ve seen his flask, but Harry feigns ignorance. If Ginny was right about one thing, it’s that she needs it much more than he does. Of course, this also earns Ron a chewing out from Hermione, who told him that that flask was a special gift and was not to be used to get drunk at school events.
“How am I supposed to do that when every damned person in this castle either avoids me entirely or takes every opportunity to let me know just how much they hate me?!” Draco looks at her, eyes blazing, breath catching in his throat when he sees disappointment on her face. He takes a deep breath, squeezing his eyes shut. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have yelled. I’m not mad at you, I’m just…”
Eva laughs. “
Draco reaches for his second biscuit, his fingers trembling slightly. She’s right, of course. The actual amount of responsibility would be light, but walking around with a Prefect badge would give him the credibility of being connected to the headmistress. But then…The fact that she heard about him threatening Harry in front of a crowd and is willing to not only excuse it, but
“Last I checked, I’m the only person who’s even willing to speak to you at the moment. And if you hadn’t noticed, I never believed for a
“Professor—” Harry starts, but McGonagall grasps his arm and starts to drag him in the opposite direction.
Harry snickers as Ron’s face goes slightly red, which nicely compliments Ron's expression of dopey pride. “You’ve heard about me?”
While everyone starts getting ready to go their separate ways, Harry pulls Bella aside.
“As a matter of fact, it is, yes.”
“Yeah, um. Fine. She’s...McGonagall’s asked if I’ll be Head Boy,” he says, suddenly feeling guilty. It had been Ron and Hermione who had been made Prefects during their fifth year, and he wonders if that position might’ve gone to Ron had Harry not just saved the entire Wizarding world. He remembers just how mad he’d been when he found out he wasn’t made a Prefect himself, and now Head Boy is right in front of him and it just feels wrong. There’s a brief silence, one of mixed emotion. Harry grimaces when Hermione gives him a weak smile and he looks down. “Luna’s been chosen as Head Girl,” he mutters, the guilt doubling.
, and I wasn’t the problem. I have no idea what’s happened to you between then and now. And I’m not completely ready to put myself on the line again. But I think this is a start.”
“That’s the only explanation I can currently muster. The dungeons were sealed by highly trained Aurors, so the likelihood of danger escaping on its own would be near impossible. How any student would’ve been able to bypass the defenses is another question entirely.”
And Harry would know.
“I suppose you’re right.” He turns to the portrait of the Fat Lady, who has already fallen asleep. He clears his throat loudly and she wakes up, disgruntled, then bursts into tears as soon as she sees who disturbed her slumber. She blubbers for a minute about being eternally grateful to Harry for saving the castle, her only home, and then swings forward without asking for the password. Harry gestures for Leon to climb through the portrait hole and follows suit, shaking his head.
“And you know, the French have a bit of a different philosophy when it comes to kissing.”
“Huh. I suppose that’s fair.”
He manages a dry laugh. “Just make sure it’s someone not on our team.”
Harry eyes Hermione suspiciously as she leaves the room, giving Ron one last warning to get dressed and come downstairs. He decides that this just must be a side effect of the new developments in their relationship and grabs a comb, heading to the bathroom to see if he can do anything about his hair. He wets the comb but finds that his hair is
Harry sighs. “But right now, peace is the last thing she’s feeling.”
Wait.
. I just…suppose I didn’t consider that this wouldn’t be a big deal for you.”
Draco finds it unfair that this is a native feeling, as he’d been hoping to come back to Hogwarts in order to
“Can’t today,” he manages to say.
“Well, you remember that day I sort of stumbled past you near the lake?”
“I don’t know,” Harry huffs, the question heavy on his lungs. “I think knowing the truth might soil the emotion for me. Especially if I start to feel doubt, there’s no way to hide it from him.”
what I called you here to discuss, but I’m glad to hear you’re feeling more sure of that.”
Draco blinks at him. “You don’t? You can’t be serious.”
Luna gives him a sympathetic look. “She’s having a really hard time with this. I’m not sure if she’s going to come out of her room, honestly.”
French feels almost as good on his lips as Leon does.
Things are pretty much the same at Hogwarts. My name is still all over the place, as I’m so accustomed to. During my lower level Defense class earlier today, I sort of failed miserably in front of everybody. Couldn’t get my damn Patronus to form. I guess I just had a lot of other things on my mind, and now it’s all anybody is talking about. Luckily Quidditch practices start next week, so focuses will hopefully shift a little bit.
“Exactly.”
Draco runs a hand through his messy hair and fights to pull in air. In his head he can already see how the press will spin this against him, knows all too well the almost impressive leaps in logic they’ll employ. Even though he’d been the one to stop the Dementor attack, they’ll somehow blame him for the attack in the first place, they’ll say it was a red herring.
this, even though things have taken a bit of a turn. I’ve never felt more sure about anything in my life.”
Harry narrows his eyes for a second, then flicks Draco in the arm. “Don’t get a big head about it. Git.” But he’s smiling, perfect teeth gleaming. “Leon was incredibly important to me.
“My sister, Harry. Ariana. I just got a letter from my parents. They found her.
“Nothing serious,” he says, perhaps too quickly. “We just had a run-in with a boggart that’s had me shaken up all day.”
Hello readers!! It's been some time since I updated this, which I attribute to school for sure. However, I got a job basically just writing on campus all summer, so I will have plenty of time to work on this and hopefully update more frequently!! This chapter is one that has sort of been planned from the beginning but in writing it I changed a lot of things that now feel like they make more sense and propel the story in the direction I need it to go, so yay for that! OK, enough of me rambling. Enjoy, and please leave a comment if you can! :)
“It really is an honor to even be considered. I think I just need a bit of time to think it over.”
“I do,” she says. “Against all odds, you have some of the most powerful and good-intentioned people on your side.”
. He’s about five minutes away from finding something sharp and going at it.
“You could be an excellent Auror. I just worry that your heart isn’t in it anymore, and I would rather you take some more time to figure things out then commit to a profession you don’t want to pursue. Am I wrong to assume that?”
I am. I love you, and I consider you a son, but who am I to tell
“No buts! She’s just been through something traumatic, and her family should be showing up any minute now.”
“But you
“Hermione, I don’t—”
“I realize you’re perfectly capable. You know, I don’t just walk around looking for people to save.” The words in another context or in a different tone would be arrogant. Draco just snorts.
He would be lying if he said it didn’t still hurt. There’s a human-shaped hole somewhere in him, one that was carved out so suddenly, so violently, that Harry isn’t sure he would’ve survived it had there not been something else to rush in and fill the vacuum. It feels unjust to Leon’s memory how things worked out, but with the world shattering and stringing itself back together all around him, it’s all he can do not to drop to his knees and wail. So, yes. He might be suppressing something that will ultimately come back to nip at his heels, dogging him with every step. The world has formed him into a sort of shark; if he stops moving forward, his heart will stop beating, every organ will fail.
Sirius Black.
“I have to ask,” she says, laughing a bit at herself, “what about Ginny?”
“Great. Awesome. Let’s get to some drills, then!”
“I’m very appreciative, Narcissa,” Kingsley says. “You’ve been an admirable host given the circumstances.”
Harry turns on the spot and disappears with a pop, leaving just Draco and the lingering aroma of charred bacon.
. Hair mussed, no glasses, still blinking sleep out of his eyes.
“Fuck you,” Draco spits. He wipes away a tear and smears his own blood across his face, deep red highlight on high cheekbone.
“There’s always next year,” Ron says, Harry and Hermione both laughing. “What?”
“Do it,” he says, and it doesn’t come out like a command, or a plea, but a surrender.
“I surprised myself, too,” Harry says.
The air outside the room is much cooler, hitting Harry harder due to the thin layer of sweat glistening on his forehead.
She smiles and shakes her head. “I am, actually.”
“Er. Okay. For what?”
“I’m just guessing here, but did you tell her how you were feeling before she got to tell you?”
Harry smiles at this and brushes a tear away. “I think you just said exactly the thing I needed to hear.”
Ron goes from pale to green and he leans over, head in hands.
“She said it was bad, but Draco…”
Leon takes a deep breath. “Well, there was a lot of chaos that night. So many people were separated from their friends, their loved ones... I thought I was doing the right thing at the time, and I think that means that it
“Why don’t you ask him yourself?” Draco says with a smile and looks toward the doorway.
Harry’s problem, then, is that Leon is much more like Hermione when it comes to schoolwork. He’d been the one who suggested this joint study time, and then he’d shown up with little work that actually needed to be completed.
Draco scowls and raises his arm again, focusing his energy there.
“Yes, and I think you do too, deep down. I still haven’t really come to terms with it, but that’s the truth. Everybody had a choice. Give in to the fear, or rise up against it. We gave in, Pansy. That’s on us when all is said and done. But what’s important is that it’s passed now. All we can do is make the next right choice, and then the next right choice after that, and so on.”
“So the thing is…I have to see him on a sort of regular basis. What do I do?”
“Of course,” Draco says and evens out his tone. “We’ll be on our way.”
give a lecture if they lost. He doesn’t want to be seen as the cold legal compass of the team.
The world is in Leon’s eyes. Harry sees love and he sees family and he sees lazy afternoons and winters by the fire and play fighting and real arguments and special sweets on birthdays. He sees expectations and plans being made and reunions anticipated. He sees happiness. He sees openness, and the need to share, and the primal human desire for someone,
“Pamela,” Draco says. Standing in Leon’s place is a familiar face, one Harry had seen only the night before in the Hospital Wing, one of the few Slytherins at Hogwarts.
good and she’d been demonstrating constraint. Perhaps it was a warning shot. He doesn’t really have time to analyze her play style, though, as there’s a flash of gold in his periphery.
“You’ll come with me?”
He frowns, thrown even further. “Who?”
him?”
Harry sighs, then stands. He takes his glasses off and rubs at his eyes. For a moment, Draco is afraid he’s going to yell. Everything about him looks like a seam that’s about to burst.
“We never found her body, Harry. She could still be out there somewhere. Anywhere. And Marcus...he died trying to help me save her, and it was all for
“I expect you’ll be running this plan by Ron and Hermione?”
Harry looks at him for a second, two, three, then shakes his head and sighs, disgusted, disappointed. “Let’s go.”
The next two days are two of the blandest days in Draco’s life. Madam Pomfrey denies him leave from bed, even though he’ll never be able to get up and walk again if he doesn’t give it a damn try. She insists that his bones are still too fragile.
Harry shrugs. In all honesty, it’s not that Leon is confusing at all.
“Bad selection at breakfast?” he asks, only mildly intrigued by the outburst.
, Draco thinks, “something about that moment made me re-contextualize everything I thought I knew.”
“Mm,” Harry says with a nod. “I, uh, I told Molly about us.”
A moment of silence passes. The torch on the wall opposite them crackles. Draco winces when he thinks about David Winslow, still recovering at St. Mungo’s.
“Of course I am. He may have done some horrible things during the war, but he was under his father’s thumb,
“Right. Good.”
“Alright then, so on to the more difficult question.”
He’s made almost three full laps around the lake, his body trying to work out what his brain had refused to earlier. He wouldn’t call it cognitive dissonance necessarily, but he was suddenly assaulted by an invitation to dig deep and expose himself. Simply put, he hadn’t been ready. But he’s not sure how he could ever prepare himself to deal with some of the things he’s seen. The things he’s done.
Leon scoffs. “I mean, we don’t have to tell people that’s what’s happening. But yes, I think it would be nice if we could
He’s going to find Ron. Only his best friend can drag him out of this despondent mire. Plus, he has some news that he’s been meaning to share.
“We’re really glad to have you back, though!” Neville pipes up from the other side of the table. “Things felt so wrong without you three here.”
“I’ve got time.”
“Maybe the issue is in your
Draco finds himself out on the grounds of Hogwarts, the early September sun warming the cool streaks where tears had been moments prior. Something strange had come over him in that room, something he can’t and doesn’t want to explain. He feels frustrated and trapped, still just
“Fuck you,” she says.
Far off, he hears Potter scream for help, even though Draco’s head is right next to his. He thinks maybe lights come on. Perhaps there’s other screaming, as well. It’s hard to tell, because he’s slipping away and his eyes are closing despite how hard he tries to keep them open, and then everything is cool and black and there’s no light, just everything pressing in on him from every side and the feeling that he is over.
He reads the letter again, then re-reads it. It’s like his whole body is vibrating, every nerve standing on end in anticipation.
Resentment surges up in Draco, green and hot, and in a moment of weakness he says, “He’s a liar.”
And now, all of that is completely unnecessary. Granted, Harry is just one person. But if
“Wait until he sees it in the snow,” Ron mutters to Harry at one point.
“Doesn’t make a difference to me. But don’t think I’ll be bringing you food or work or messages from the outside world.”
Their conversation plays on loop in his head during his third day of bed rest, distracting him from the essay he’s trying to write on the burn salve he’d concocted during his last attended class. Not at all like his usual work ethic. Then again, he’s not usually writing his essays from an isolated room tucked behind the Hospital Wing.
“I’m not sure that’s true. Has Ron actually asked his family yet?”
“When?” Harry says, his voice a high-strung whisper.
“I see you’ve caught up, Weasley. Yes, that’s correct. And if I’m lucky, I won’t see you until then.”
Harry grunts and gives up. “‘Spose not.” He turns to face Draco again.
“Do you really believe that there won’t be any kind of side effects?”
“Exactly!” says Hermione proudly. “Even though...I do think Ron is technically right, you could walk in anywhere right now and they’d hire you on the spot. But I also think there’s a lot of merit in earning it the old fashioned way. But really, after everything we did? How bad could one more year at Hogwarts really be?”
“Harry, what’s going on?” Hermione asks. The caution in her voice is so contrary to how he feels that it makes Harry laugh.
“Something happened earlier today that I think you should know.”
Harry gives those words a moment to seep into his brain. The world around them is so forgiving and cheerful. The grass is green and lush, some of the leaves on the trees are already starting to brown, still a week shy of October. The grounds are fairly empty. Most students are already starting to feel their knees buckle under the stress of assignments and exams and social lives and extracurricular activities.
“Has something happened?”
There’s a pause, then Hermione and Harry both guess, “His own?”
He shakes his head. “I’m fine. Just stressed about the first class later.”
“—alleged criminal—” Harry corrects.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry comes back to Ron when he nudges him in the ribs, then glances downward pointedly. In Ron’s outstretched hand is a flask. Harry chuckles but pushes it back towards him.
“Don’t be fresh,” she says, but she’s smiling. “Back in a jiff.” She hops off the desk and exits the room, leaving Draco with the dilemma simmering, thick and sickly green, in the cauldron that is his brain.
Draco eyes him strangely.
His eyes widen slightly and he looks frantically around him, clutching the letter closer and continuing.
“Of course she is. And it’s taken every fiber not to find a way to reach out to her, but I don’t want to involve her in this if I can help it. She’s gone through far too much, she deserves some peace.”
Harry shrugs. “As great as
Finally, “Look, Draco, about earlier—”
“And are you interested in going?”
Harry raises an eyebrow in question and Hermione just exhales happily. “It’s nothing. Leon made a joke about ancient runes. You wouldn’t get it.” She’s right, and Harry finds he doesn’t even feel left out. “You know, I really,
He frowns. “I didn’t, actually. I sort of just…showed up? And hoped you would be here?”
It’s in this moment that things reconnect in Harry’s mind. Yes, he knows rationally that what he had seen was the work of a squadron of boggarts, but he hasn’t seen Hermione since before that chilling moment. Her arms, the tickle on Harry’s face from her curly hair, it’s a real and physical confirmation that she is very much alive and—
Harry takes a deep breath and turns to her. “Ginny, Leon and I are…together.”
“Oh,” he says for a third time. “I’m so sorry, Harry. I didn’t mean to come here, I just panicked and Disapparated and somehow ended up—”
Harry is a very good support, and Draco finds that he’s glad he has Harry’s help. He’d always considered the other boy sort of scrawny and insignificant, but with his arm around Harry’s shoulders, he feels a sturdiness that he hadn’t been expecting.
Granted, their first practice and the offer were only yesterday. But he’d assumed Ron would jump at the opportunity from the very little he knows about him.
“How did you manage it?” Ginny asks.
Draco sits bolt upright in bed. Recalls the last time Harry had been in his room. “Come in,” he repeats, trying to ignore how dry his mouth is.
I knew, hoping that…hoping that
Leon nods. “I just heard.” It sounds like all the breath has been suctioned out of him, leaving him wheezing.
“What the hell were you doing anyway? Trying to play hero?”
“No.”
His heart almost stops entirely when he hears that Leon is choked up.
A comfortable silence develops. Draco does wish Harry would stop fidgeting in his seat and looking at the door, though. It’s fraying his nerves. Seconds turn into minutes and Draco starts to consider leaving despite their instructions. At one point his stomach grumbles and when Harry indicates the tray of biscuits with his eyes Draco can’t help but roll his own. He takes another biscuit anyway. On multiple occasions it seems like Harry is about to say something but can’t get the words out. Not very Gryffindor of him.
. Harry would have to be an idiot to miss the giant flashing sign hanging in the air between them. So he takes note of it, then ignores it.
“Up until very recently, I…sort of…had feelings for you still.”
“Hermione, did you ask him about it?”
me when you asked me to do this for you. I’ve been trying really hard to move on, but clearly that’s not been going well. I love you, Harry, and it’s so complicated because you’re like a member of my family but we were also together and I’ve never felt about anybody the way I do about you. The fact that you’re gay doesn’t change the way I feel.” At this, Harry glances around, makes sure nobody’s listening. Ginny’s too wrapped up in her speech to even notice, or care. “I wish it could, I really do. And,” she pauses, takes a sip of her drink, “it doesn’t seem like you’re torn up at
Harry shrugs. “I can figure something out. It’s possible it won’t even come up until after we’ve cleared your name.”
"I suppose that’s all we can ask for,” she says with a sigh. She’s clinging to the podium, her knuckles white. Harry grabs a chair from the closest table and places it behind her, motioning for her to sit.
Draco swings his legs out of bed, cautiously getting to his feet. His muscles are stiff and sore, and suddenly having to support his weight puts even more strain on them. He grimaces as his knees start to buckle. Harry lurches forward, catching him under his arms and pulling him back up.
She smiles and shrugs. “Just a suggestion. So much of this teen angst can be avoided if you communicate properly.”
“I didn’t mean to lead him on the way I did.”
Ron mutters something in his sleep and turns over, his face scrunched up. Harry wonders if he’s having a nightmare. They’ve all been having them, ever since the war. Rarely do they talk about their contents, but every morning all summer the three of them exchange knowing looks, the dark circles gradually lessening as the tragedy trudges further and further into the past.
“Then how did you steal it?”
“I appreciate that,” he says, standing up. “Was there anything else you wanted to discuss?”
Hermione hums and takes a sip of water. “Right, last year…”
“I’m not joking,” he says quietly.
And when he looks up, he sees Draco, his chest heaving and his eyes wild but bright, and his full corporeal Patronus, gigantic, looming over the Hall—not a snake.
“Draco, what the fuck is going on?”
“Yes, father.”
She looks a little hurt. He does feel bad that he isn’t telling her the whole truth.
”Regardless, I am concerned but impressed with your knowledge on the subject. Am I to assume that Miss Granger may also be involved?”
“It wasn’t obvious, if that’s what you’re worried about” says McGonagall, which at least allows Harry to finally breathe in again, “but…Let’s just say, I’m familiar with what it is you’re doing here.”
“Would you like me to handle this, Harry? So you can get along to your meeting?”
a joke?”
He stares at her, trying to soak in all of her points.
Leon chuckles. “I know. But she’ll believe it when she sees it.”
The wand rolls out of his hand and where the bloody water had once parted, it all flows together. Leon hits the ground with a
“I...I’m not sure. Do you still think I would do be a good Auror?”
“I’m an evil person.”
“Where’s the fun in that?” she asks as she drapes the smock around his shoulders. “Why didn’t
“Do it,” Rowan says, victory parading out on his voice. “
“Start wherever feels right. Wherever you need to.”
“Was it that obvious that I was conflicted?” Draco asked with a surprised laugh.
Harry smiles and shrugs. Like he doesn’t even know what to do with the apology. “Whenever you’re ready,” he says.
“Leon, listen—”
“Hey, I’m not going anywhere, okay? This is real,” he adds, sensing that Harry may be holding onto hurts from the way Leon was manipulated, from the way he was so suddenly wrenched away. Erased from Harry’s life altogether “All of it is
Leon follows his gaze and sets his jaw. “Right. Please don’t be too long?”
Draco has a flash of memory: a snap judgement, a healing salve as a flame-impeding consumable.
that the Ministry hasn’t been able to find you?”
Leon laughs, shaking his head. “It’s alright, Madame Maxime just informed me that I’ll be staying with the Gryffindors, so you can just show me the way once we’ve finished!”
Harry can’t help but smile as each pair gets into position, a look of intense concentration painted on every face. Something comes over him when he teaches: a fierce desire to see each person succeed.
“Oh, I don’t doubt your ability to captain our team. I don’t doubt your Seeker capabilities either.”
The force of the suction is so strong that he launches past the center of the hole, uses the momentum to cut through the air on the right side of the room. When he lands next to Ginny, the blood pooled around her head makes his eyes fuzz over for a moment, but he can see that she’s still breathing.
And now he’s asking for private tutoring? Harry is all for the idea conceptually, but the thought of Draco being the subject makes him sweat. Fuck, fuck, fuck. This is
Hermione’s worry tapers off. “Oh, good. And how did it go? The talking, I mean,” she clarifies.
“The problem,” Harry says as he circles Draco, “is in your wrist, I think. Your elbow seems to lock in nicely, but your wrist is weaker.”
“Fine,” Draco says with a curt nod.
“Different?”
“Like I said, the actual practice was alright. It’s gonna take us some time to get to know each other, but everybody is decent enough. But get this. After we finish, Malfoy pulls me aside. And he
He opens his mouth to defend himself, but it’s pointless. The rational Hermione is gone at the moment, and he can’t blame her.
Ron rolls his eyes and kisses her on the cheek. “Fine, Hermione’s still the star student, no surprise there. That Leon guy’s not too shabby, either. Did you see the look on—”
Seizing the momentum of the conversation, Harry decides to broach the final subject. “I was actually wondering if he might come stay here eventually.” He says the words like they’re red-hot, tumbling out of his mouth like cinders. “Once all of this has passed, obviously,” he continues hastily. “I know that there are…issues from the past,” he starts to say, but Molly lays a hand on his arm.
“Yes,” he answers anyway. “I…I think so?”
“It’s kind of thrilling to sneak around like this, isn’t it?”
“Alright, on to our last team. Our last captain will be Slytherin’s Draco Malfoy!”
“Right, we didn’t think so either,” Michael says, lowering his voice. “But I’m sure you’ve heard about that first year that got clobbered. Barely had time to make enemies, but she’s still lying in the Hospital Wing, isn’t she?”
“Having you here helps. Plus, if I know anything, it’s that Hermione Granger is probably devouring a stack of legal tomes at this very moment. If not for me, than for you.”
bad a person. He did save the wizarding world, after all,” he says, not sure where the words emerge from.
Slughorn pauses and looks over his shoulder. “No, no, I suppose now will do. Just give me a moment,” he says and closes the door. There’s a faint
“Might as well be. What are you doing in here anyway?”
“I know, it’s not ideal, but the other option is being potentially found out, so.”
his answer.
“The idea that

“Brilliant!” says Ginny. “Well deserved, that.”
you are.”
“You’re up to it, yeah?” she asks Draco, just to be sure.
Draco turns to Harry. “You think staying the night is wise?”
Draco can’t help but chuckle to himself as he steps onto the train, Potter’s dumbfounded expression replaying in his brain. He hadn’t
“Honestly, mate, how could you ever think that anybody at this school would think you're boring?”
McGonagall follows his gaze. Nods. “Right. Draco, if you would escort the Hufflepuffs to their dormitory. Miss Lovegood? Miss Weasley?”
“Right, can you get this off my face now?” Harry asks almost immediately, the two arms in his tightening their grip slightly.
“What was that for?” he asks once she pulls away.
Potter lets out a sort of half-laugh and shakes his head. Draco is surprised he isn’t reveling in his power, all this attention that’s on him.
, for the love of Morgana!”
“Then how did he manage it?”
Harry looks between Ron and Hermione, then back to Draco with a resigned nod. “We were, yeah.”
She glares at him. “Are you really going to bring him up right now?” she asks as they make their way to the door, squabbling all the way. Draco isn’t really paying attention as Ron pulls out other examples of poor ideas; he’s too busy studying Harry’s face, wondering what’s going on in his head.
Harry’s whole body vibrates with rage, waves of shuddering anxiety rolling over him, a sea of broken glass. This can’t be happening, not after what he’s been through, everything he’s already given.
“I’m worried about you,” she says, badly attempting to conceal her anger under the guise of concern.
“I’m going to go third wheel with Ron and Hermione for a bit,” Leon says as he stands. “Will you come join us?”
“What about this Defense professor rubbish?” Ginny asks. “Don’t you think they should’ve sorted that out before term started?”
“We've kept rather quiet about it. Many are still in denial, especially those who have lost people. Most of us thought that we wouldn’t be able to finish our education up until a little over a month ago.”
“Fine. You’re welcome,” he says as he continues to walk.
So again, he counts down. Instead of a slew of shouts, he’s met with a solid wall of silence.
“I went right after the feast finished,” she says with a shrug. “As soon as she said we didn’t have a Defense professor the idea popped into my head.”
She frowns. “Of course it will,” she says with certainty, again looking back and forth between them.
He doesn’t know how he got to his knees, just knows that it’s so cold, he’s trembling violently, and another Dementor makes a pass right over his head and he feels something depart, ripped out from him unceremoniously. Wails sound from somewhere far away, like the muffled sound of a stab victim, and suddenly Hermione is crouched next to him with her wand out, stammering over the incantation but unable to bring it to fruition through her sobs. She alternates, failing the spell, then screaming his name and trying to drag him away.
“It is?” Harry asks. Of course Harry thinks so, but he’s confused by Bill’s overwhelmingly positive reaction.
Finally, I will just put myself out there and beg for comments as I always do. Especially on a chapter like this where I feel I've put a lot of myself and my own experience into it, it's just nice to see a response to that. Ok I'm done babbling now. Enjoy a slightly more angsty but ultimately hopeful chapter!! <3
“I agree with Blaise. Your priorities these days are unfortunate, Pansy,” he says coolly as he sits. Pansy splutters, trying to think of something to say, but Draco interrupts her. “In case you hadn’t noticed, the world has changed a lot over the last few months. You can either accept it, or be left behind. Your choice.” This shuts her up immediately, her cheeks going pink.
“That’s how you ended up holding my hand, I suppose.”
Damn, another cliffhanger?? I'm kinda evil, huh? Also, I would like to dedicate this chapter to my lovely friend Thunderbird587, as I just found out it's her birthday!! What are the odds I would finish a chapter at the exact right time?? If you haven't read her fic, you are missing out on some utterly incredible Drarry content, so i would highly recommend checking her out (although I think our audiences may already overlap a good bit, in which case make sure you wish her a happy birthday!!)
Blaise scoffs. “Draco, he’s still your father,”
Mari shakes her head. “No. It’s not quite that simple. In some cases, words aren’t enough. They can be a good start, or a meaningful punctuation maybe. Really, I think what you need to do is show people you’ve changed. Let them see that the past is the past, and that you’re working on making amends and rebuilding yourself.”
He clears his throat. While his plan of attack isn’t entirely direct, he’s aware how transparent it is. Still worth a shot, but odds are he’s exposing himself in the end anyway.
“What’s this all about?”
She laughs. “I do, would you like me to get some?”
Leon says nothing, just smiles. Kisses Harry’s forehead. Shuffles backward. “I’m going to put my shirt on now.”
“I’m sorry I brought it up,” Leon says, his voice intensely apologetic.
. Not now.
Leon laughs. “This is exactly what I mean! You don’t have to downplay your triumphs. You’re allowed to be proud of yourself.”
“Together? What do you mean?”
“That wasn’t a no, yeah? I have things I need to do, but please just do me this one favor. You wouldn’t want me abusing my Slytherin Prefect status, would you?”
“Mister Malfoy, is everything okay?” she asks, her tone alarmed.
, Draco. What evidence does your father actually have against you? His word against Minerva McGonagall’s alone will be enough to shut it down, I predict. She made you Prefect, remember? Why would she do that if she had any doubts about your affiliation? The Aurors arresting you was probably more of a formality than anything.”
“Okay. It’s not that different, after all. It’s just a body.”
Harry approaches their little group again to take his turn assuring Mrs. Weasley that they’ll finally have a calm year and that they’ll write often, but he can’t help but glance over his shoulder a few times toward where Malfoy had stepped onto the scarlet locomotive, his gentle grin still playing in Harry’s mind. He thought things might start to feel normal again soon, but he realizes now that this is only the beginning of the truly abnormal.
“There can be,” the blond replies. He licks his lips. “But. I have something to say first.”
I think this chapter introduces sort of the final facet of the plot that needs to be folded in, which is very exciting. Not much left to reveal, just development and fluff and love :,) Enjoy!!
“I know, Mother,” he says. “I…heard some of it.”
“Er…”
“Are you saying we’ll never have privacy again?”
After he’s made sure no pumpkin juice has made its way into his lungs, Harry turns around to see Leon standing behind him. His usual glow is absent, which Harry finds odd. Bags sit prominently under his eyes and his hair is only
“Regardless, it seems to me that Potions is something that will be in your future in one way or another, and you might just think about how more specifically. I’m not saying you should join the Healing Corps and work with the sickest of the sick in the bowels of St. Mungo’s, either. The developmental side of things is more removed and methodical, and I happen to think you would excel there.”
need to do something about your hair!”
Draco eyes him with suspicion but nods.
Draco swallows the lump in his throat. “Yes, I suppose he does. He has a way of doing that, doesn’t he?”
There’s a pause, during which Draco is sure his mother’s head is going to fly off her body. Then, she exhales through her nose and sits back. “Is that all?”
The door opens and Harry clutches his sheets, sucks in a breath through his teeth. Professor McGonagall pokes her head in. She makes eye contact with Harry and the terse expression on her face melts away, worry flowing out of her with a sigh of relief.
“It does sound that way,” she says. “This isn’t exactly my area of expertise, I’ll admit. I’ve never worked with anybody who had questions about sexuality.”
“Already on top of things, I see. It’s good to have you on board. Both of you,” she adds, turning to Luna.
“First of all, I would just like to put out a reminder of the upcoming Autumn Ball. It will be held exactly a week from today, in this room. A date is mandatory, and it is highly encouraged that said date be a member of a different House or school, if at all possible. There will be refreshments,” she says with a twinkling smile. The refreshments at an event like this are sure to be special, and Harry knows she’s well aware that some people may be coming with food high on their list of priorities. Or their whole list of priorities.
“That first Defense class…” Draco starts stupidly, regretting the words as soon as they fill the empty air. No choice but to keep talking. “I stayed after the way I did because…Well, because I was going to try to apologize. And I figured not even you would be so thick as to not realize that something was going on, which is why I’m confirming that now,” he says, trying to keep his tone light. “But I…don’t know what to do now.”
“Fine. No use in being humble and denying that, I suppose.” He has no idea where all of this confidence is coming from. There’s a warmth spreading through his chest and his head is so clear. He hasn’t felt this great since he took Felix Felicis during sixth year. “My point is, I fear that for some of you, the respect borders on fear. Or maybe awe. Or some kind of combination. And that just won’t do for me. When I accepted this position, I did so under the pretense that I could still be a normal teenager, you know, and finish my education here like the rest of you. And if a dramatic silence befalls the room every time I enter it…It just doesn’t feel right.”
“So you and
“I don’t think I’ve ever received a love letter,” she says thoughtfully.
“Last year was a shite-show,” comes Seamus Finnigan’s voice from Harry’s left. “We heard a lousy speech about assimilation and the importance of adhering to the rules, and Slytherin was the only table with food for the first ten minutes.”
Fighting the pink that blooms in his cheeks, Harry follows him back to Ginny and Luna, who are sitting in silence. Luna picks at the edge of her skirt while Ginny stares into the fire.
,” Draco mouths back.
That said, I do enjoy people analyzing what I'm writing, and if I ever do something like SERIOUSLY problematic please point it out!! And aside from that, any comment is a good comment. They all make me smile :) I just love engaging with people who are reading my work!!! SO enjoy <33
The smell of bacon fills the room, smoky and enticing. It’s just about done, but Draco prefers to let it get a bit charred. It’s extra crispy that way.
“Thanks, M—Professor.”
“Sounds like a yes to me.”
Molly nods, her eyes slightly narrowed and lips pressed into a sliver. It’s clear she’s trying to hear him out, not jump into panic mode, but Harry can feel it churning just below the surface.
“Er, you, too.”
“Ravenclaws and Slytherins will be fine with me,” Luna says. “I’ll bring Ginny with me, too. I don’t think she should be alone right now.”
They both laugh, the sound filling the room like bells. Once it dies down, Harry speaks again. “I can’t really explain it, but I think I could…feel it. If you were doing something wrong. Physically.”
“All eighth year students will be required a meeting with their Head of House in order to ensure you are all on the right track to pass the necessary N.E.W.T.s and graduate without complications. For other students, courses will continue similarly to the way we’ve always conducted them, so no need to worry about that.
His whole body goes weak when he sees it. The post arrived in his absence, and the headline of the
*taps mic* is this thing on?
“You see, it’s come to my attention that you already have some experience in teaching this particular subject.”
“Seeing each other, I suppose. Romantically.”
Draco sits up abruptly, his head spinning for a moment. Not again.
She returns a half smile, eyes flitting up to his from her book. “You’re just lucky I was here,” she says, not looking up, her smile betraying her indifferent tone.
They stop play fighting and look at her. She glares back and forth; Harry and Ron burst into a fit of laughter in tandem, which causes Hermione’s stern visage to break.
Where once the enormous doors leading into the hall sat is now a gaping hole, the doors reduced to piles of debris and dust in the entrance hall. A gigantic crack runs from the front end of the hall to where Draco and Harry stand, petrified. Draco doesn’t have the capacity to acknowledge the pools of blood around the floor, the bodies littered like seeds throughout the room.
Harry’s face flushes. “So you think I’m cute?” he manages to say.
“Fine. My point is, it’s all pretty sudden. That’s all.”
“I think the level of drama is perfectly warranted.”
No, it’s just a letter. He sighs and opens the window, allowing her to hop into his room.
Pansy nods and wipes her eyes. She glances around and exhales when she’s sure they’re alone.
“I am
“Well—” he starts defensively.
Is that why he’s oddly drawn to Potter’s Defense class? He’d immediately thought it was ridiculous, but that hadn’t stopped him from going to Slughorn for the sole reason of asking for admittance. The idea of being on a different side for once—the winning side—definitely holds merit, but there’s something else. He can’t block out the image of his father, still out in the world somewhere, eluding justice. There are plenty others like him, and, given what Draco has learned about the nature of humanity, there will always be more. Always. Maybe if he’d learned a bit more, if he’d been more involved with the actual concrete and defensive aspects of his studies, maybe he would’ve been able to stand up for himself. If only he’d developed the spine for it…
It seems Hermione really has come back around after she found out about the blood magic. It’s another weight off Harry’s shoulders he hadn’t realized was there. And neither of his friends had asked any questions about his afternoon whereabouts.
“I outrank you hear. I’m Madam Pomfrey’s senior apprentice.”
When it comes down to it, he can’t seem to avoid the utterly bizarre wish that he was…Harry Potter’s friend.
, I had to go back, I
Harry widens his eyes and jerks his head toward the door. “
Draco laughs. “I believe my brush with death has brought about some new perspective for me, Potter.”
“Maybe you should stick with just calling me cute.”
“Nothing. Well, something, but I can’t tell you.”
“The headmistress.”
“Suppose it came from beyond and caused the ceiling to fall.”
“But this entire week has been implausible,” Harry contends.
“Would I have asked if I didn’t want the honest answer?”
“That’s…not really how blood works though. Is it?”
—Draco can move on to the next priority: Leon. Because he’d been watching closely all evening. That was his job, was it not? The boy who’s already aroused so much suspicion in him seemed a worthwhile target for surveillance, and Draco would be an idiot to ignore the fact that Leon ran out of the hall in tears and minutes later, a swarm of Dementors arrived.
“Typically, yes. But I’m fresh out of Dementors at the moment.”
“You know, being in your class is one of the reasons I changed my tune so quickly.”
“But if you keep avoiding it—”
Harry takes a deep breath. “It was because Leon had just told me something very personal, and we had a lovely moment where we…you know, shared some mutual trauma, as you do when you’ve survived the same war. And I just sort of held him and it was a very open and trusting space. Which was confusing, but I rolled with it because I could see that he needed it, and…perhaps I needed it, as well. But then on the way back to the castle, he tried to hold my hand, and I don’t know… I just sort of panicked.”
"What?"
"Er, will our safety be ensured?" Draco asked.
"Oh God, what happened?" Ginny asked. But he ignored her as well, continuing to walk down the hallway, making his way down to the kitchens.
There was something off about this whole thing. She wouldn't leave without saying goodbye. It wasn't like her.
"And there was this beautiful flower chick." She carefully did not react as Fred and George interrupted Ron. They signed in unison as they described her. "She danced like a tulip in the wind, but only twice did she grace the dance floor. And not with either of us dishy men."
"You already are," she said softly. Draco looked at the offending hand that clasped on the girl's wrist, and realizing that it brought forth a pleasant warmth, he yanked his hand away. The force spilled the vanilla over her shirt, and dripped down to the parchment of her book.
"Last time we flew out on a pheonix". Ginny said.
"Alright, I'm going to add the hornet's stinger in," Draco said, "so I'd back away from the cauldron if I were you." Harmony lifted her head and followed Draco's hands as he carefully placed in the stinger. A cloud of smoke emptied from the sides, and Harmony remembered when he had held her hands the night they went flying.
“Ple-ease,” Draco chokes out, voice hoarse from the lust building steadily in his veins.
Seven days from now, Draco Malfoy will be dead.
“Is this okay?” he asks Draco. He’s not sure he wants to hear the answer.
Draco crosses the room to sit on Harry’s bed, raising an eyebrow. “Don’t tell me this wasn’t what you were thinking when you invited me over to stay the night.”
Draco
Draco scowls as his prick twitches in Harry’s hand—brief images of last night flitter through his mind, Harry underneath him, legs spread wide, letting Draco press inside the slick heat of his arse. “That’s unfair,” Draco grumbles, shuddering as Harry starts to wank him faster.
Draco stills.
“Low blow, Potter,” Malfoy says.
He’s already so fucking hard. Merlin, he’d
“Course,” Harry says, kissing him on the temple, and it’s dumb and sickeningly sweet but Draco
Mother doesn’t seem surprised. “I thought as much.” Silence, for several moments, and then, “But you care for him.”
Potter to hate him.
Draco does roll his eyes this time. “There’s nothing that can be done, Potter.”
It’s half curiosity and half that damned longing that has Harry nodding and saying, “Yeah. Tonight.”
Harry doesn’t need to be asked twice. He shudders and kisses Draco once more. Then he pushes Draco to the bed, casting a spell to enlarge it, and climbs on, pressing Draco to the mattress and kissing him until he gasps.
And then Hermione coaxes him up so she can wrap him in a hug, and he cries for the second time that day.
“It’s just—even the Muggles haven’t devised a way to change genes in already-developed humans. And the magical chromosome has never been mapped out because half of the Healers out there don’t even know it exists—it’s just. It’s hopeless,” Hermione says, staring at the floor.
“If that’s the case,” Harry says, “then why can’t you call me Harry now?”
Draco loves him.
Then came that time in the corridor, where he’d felt so, so alone, crouched down and sobbing where he thought no one could hear him—but Potter had found him, and that was his tipping point into oblivion.
“Really?” Ginny raised a sandy eyebrow. “Huh, I rather thought you might be. Guess I was wrong?”
It’s honestly more than he’d expected, to be able to look Malfoy in the eyes, to reach over and link their fingers together without Malfoy protesting.
that Harry thinks he’d rather die than say aloud. But if the small smile on Malfoy’s face is any indication, he understands exactly what Harry means.
Harry laughs. “Just thinking, I guess. Wondering where the rest of us have gotten to.”
Harry swallows a lump of emotion. “Malfoy?”
Then he drops his head and sighs.
“No, it’s not that,” Draco snaps, pinching at the bridge of his nose. He shuts his eyes, but the moment he does so, images of a naked Potter beneath him flash across his vision, and he has to open them again in a hurry. He shakes his head. “I had sex,” he says abruptly. He withholds the part about the Amortentia—that, he’ll keep to himself.
“What...?”
And then he starts.
Harry’s eyebrows raise. “No, I didn’t even think of that, actually.” He pauses for a second. “But, er. Would that work?”
the one that will miss Malfoy when this is over.
“Good, Harry. I think your dueling skills are officially up to par.”
For a terrifying moment, Harry almost thinks he might throw off the clutches of the spell, but then Malfoy thinks, ‘
’. He and Draco never really broke up, did they?
He doesn’t want to argue, so he kisses Draco, trying to hold on for as long as he can.
He hates him.
Rubbing his fingers against the pulsing in his head, Harry lets out a long sigh. Fine. Malfoy’s here, and obviously Harry can’t do anything about it. All he can do is attempt to make this the least painful it can be for the both of them, and interrogate Malfoy for clues on what’s going on with the war while he’s at it—his updates from the Order are far less than satisfactory.
“I don’t want to lie to you again,” Potter tells him firmly. “I do want you to trust me, you know.”
But Salazar help him, he’s also feeling morbidly curious as well as the slightest bit vindictive. And Potter offered, didn’t he?
—how could he have forgotten how much he
, staring through the wall at Draco, who is suddenly extremely aware of his partial state of undress.
He’s… he’s
Harry sighs out a breath as he pulls away, smiling at Draco, heart fluttering in his chest (still, after all this time) when Draco smiles back. “I’m glad we’re not like that anymore—fighting every day, literally at each other’s throats whenever we got the chance.”
Making as little movement as possible, he turns his head and looks around the room, grateful to see his clothes in a heap on a chair over by the wall. His clothes aren’t the only ones lying around—there’s a couple sets of Unspeakable robes in the floor, looking like they’ve just been stepped out of, as well as a pile of jumpers on the dresser. He wrinkles his nose at a pair of socks lying crumpled on the nightstand.
Harry smiles at him, heart fluttering like the wings of a pixie in his chest. “It’s nothing, really.”
, especially because every now and then Draco’s eyes meet his and—and there are sparks, warm and happy, all across Harry’s skin.
Potter shifts as Draco reaches down to stroke his own cock, moving forward, and then Potter’s next thrust hits Draco’s prostate—“
And then Potter leans in and says, “I’ve wanted to do this for bloody
“Just tell me why, and I’ll let it go,” Harry says. Because more than anything—more than thoughts of future kisses or even just friendship—Harry just wants to know what he’d done wrong.
want him.”
,’ but doesn’t do that either.
Draco is right. He sighs and says, “I won’t.”
Harry groaned internally, stopping mid-stride and turning around. He had been so close to turning the far corner of the hallway when he first saw her, but he’d apparently been too late. This was the second person in as many days that he had run into late at night while wandering the corridors. Damn it, he knew he should have brought the invisibility cloak, but he had forgotten to pack it. He was sure it was sitting smugly in his wardrobe, laughing at him for not remembering.
“Hi,” he says, motioning for Malfoy to be quiet as he shuts the door behind him and leads Malfoy up to his room. Once there, he casts a Muffliato just to be safe, and then he exhales a breath of relief.
—stupid Gryffindors with their stupid, easy feelings. “And you cared about me, tonight, didn’t you? We’re friends, after all.”
,” Harry groans out. He’s going light-headed, he thinks, and all he can feel is pleasure, hot in his body as he tries to focus on stroking himself. Then Draco moans against his neck, suckling again in a way that stings sharply, and all of a sudden Harry’s gone—he comes hard, body spasming beneath the press of Draco’s hips, his body, his mouth. “Draco, Draco,” he cries out, the only word he can think as he goes so light-headed he sees stars.
“No. I wouldn’t do that,” Malfoy says, frowning at him. “I do try my best not to be a terrible person nowadays, Potter.”
Ginny rolled her eyes, though her face was amused. “Fine, I’m sure you’ll tell me later… Come on, let’s keep walking! I have exciting news.”
Harry shakes his head, heaving a sigh.
They’re both tired, he thinks. Maybe that’s why this is happening, that and the couple of months of having their bodies pressed close together while they sleep, of Draco reveling in as much of Potter’s touch as he could get. Still, Draco’s terrified and blown away all at once when Potter sits up to pull his own shirt off, when Potter lies down again and starts kissing Draco’s neck and collarbones and Draco can’t hold back his gasps.
“We’re together literally all the time,” Potter says, and then sighs. “Anyway, I know you. Or—knew you, at least.”
“That’s fantastic, Granger,” Draco says, a smile gracing his face as he stands from the bed. “I should say that I have some news as well—I’m sure Hermione has gleamed this from our Owls back and forth, but I’m very close to perfecting a more robust potion for core regeneration.”
Draco lets out a soft sigh. “Okay,” he says, and rolls away again, closing his eyes. Harry resumes stroking his hair, and he hums softly.
“I wouldn’t have thought you wanted to,” Draco says, and his voice threatens to crack, making him feel hideously vulnerable all of a sudden.
“Still want to go to lunch?” Draco asks, jolting Harry out of his thoughts and waggling his eyebrows. “We could go to mine instead…”
“Not yet,” Malfoy says, but thankfully he seems to take the hint anyway and slips his hand down to pull at the drawstring of Harry’s pajama bottoms. Harry’s heart races. “Could take these off?”
He decides to do it.
They sit in silence.
“Potter...” Draco says, furrowing his brow.
Then at last, they break apart.
“Draco, then,” Harry decides, pleased, and Draco groans and flops back onto the bed. He doesn’t let go of Harry’s hand.
—at least, not about anything beyond work, and that barely counts.
And then they sit at his kitchen table and Malfoy pulls out the vial of Amortentia, setting it between them. Harry stares it down like it’s an adversary in Wizarding chess, ready to knock him out at the slightest provocation. He clenches his teeth.
Potter’s eyes widen a bit. “Oh, I—sure!”
“Oh,” Harry says, and even though he understands, his heart still pangs in distress at the fact that Draco’s leaving.
And then he lets it slide out of his fingers and fall to the floor.
“You can,” Harry says, and now Malfoy is the one trembling in his arms, until Harry opens his mouth and adds, “But that doesn’t mean I want you to.”
—” And then he remembers, conveniently, that he can now Apparate.
They stand there for another moment, and then Malfoy holds out his hand. “Well,” he says, and Harry reaches up to shake it, looking confused. “That’s that, then,” Malfoy says, his eyes slowly growing guarded. “I suppose I won’t need your help anymore.”
“Still basking in the glow of your little fans, aren’t you, Potter?” Malfoy sneers as he strides past.
“I don’t know what to ask,” Draco says, the smile sliding off his face. “We’ve already gone through everything interesting.”
But she
“Nothing,” Four says quickly. “And anyway, you’ll see soon enough, won't you? After we pass our exams?”
and he thinks that’d be far too embarrassing.
He walks over to the fountain, and for a brief moment, he smells Astoria’s scent so strongly he whips around, thinking she’s there behind him.
Sure, he goes to the Diagon Gentlewizard’s club on occasion at Astoria’s behest. But even then Astoria usually comes along with him, despite not having interest in such things. So the point stands that he
They kiss and kiss, and if he thinks about it hard enough, he can almost smell chlorine.
“Okay,” Potter says, and he slides an arm around Draco, covering Draco’s hand with his own, moving it over Draco’s cock. Draco’s breath hitches—fuck—and he watches as Potter’s fingers intertwine with his own, perfectly in time with the way he’s stroking himself.
Harry’s face twists and he nods, pulling away and looking down at his lap. Draco’s had a harder time than anyone else has, earning respect on the team. It’s part of the reason Harry started hanging out with him more—it made him angry, to see the rest of the department shunning him, when in Harry’s opinion Draco had barely done anything wrong since halfway through the war.
“The windows are charmed,” Malfoy tells him, leaning against the counter with his own glass in a casual way that Harry grudgingly thinks is hot. “There’s no real sunlight coming in the shop unless the door is open, so the danger is minimal. I brew the potions we need at night, and then I have assistants that help me with delivering orders and picking up supplies and the like.”
But Potter’s already saved him once, sheltering him from the heat of the Fiendfyre. He can’t burden Potter again.
“Sure,” Draco says, turning to face her.
Draco can’t believe he
“Hullo,” Potter says.
“…surely we won’t receive the highest quality education possible if there are two of us,” Malfoys says. “I mean, part of the advantage of the Unspeakable curriculum is the one-to-one interaction with more experienced—”
“Just making absolutely sure,” he says, and then quietly, he adds, “I won’t let you down. I promise.”
“I like this,” Potter says, startling Draco, making him feel warm all over.
next to him. Draco could reach out and touch him if he really wanted to, but where would that get him? A look of disgust, probably.
,” Draco gasps, because it’s not just warm, it’s tingling, and at that point Potter seems to have found his prostate because he has to cry out at how good it feels.
“We could be,” Potter says.
“Maybe,” Malfoy says, and Harry’s not sure if he’s imagining it but his face seems closer.
“That’s good to hear,” Harry says. But it doesn’t make him feel much better, if at all. He’s still worried about Draco, and Ron, too.
“What?” Harry asks, as Malfoy’s body slowly stills.
“I’d like that,” Potter says. “If you, er, wouldn’t mind me ruining your fun? I mean. You probably want to go alone…”
“Merlin,” Potter groans out, forehead against Draco’s cheek. “That was—fuck.”
It goes to show how weary Draco is that this doesn’t even surprise him.
Draco won’t.
Harry, indeed, hadn’t noticed it, but he thinks it would probably be more embarrassing to admit that than to just let Malfoy think he’s just a shit undercover Auror. This whole thing is a lost cause.
“Just… lay there, and sleep right in front of me. I’m your enemy!” Malfoy scowled, crossing his arms.
“I’ll be worse,” Harry says, voice cracking. “You’re going to hate me so much.”
He has only seconds to orient himself before Malfoy comes around the corner, an empty glass in hand. His dress shirt has thin black stripes on it this time, and the cuffs are rolled up to his elbows, exposing his forearms. Harry’s eyes catch immediately on his Dark Mark, faded but still visible, and when he looks back at Malfoy’s face he knows Malfoy’s noticed.
“I—” Draco’s words are becoming shakier now. “When I suck you off—I would let you come on my face. If you wanted.”
Malfoy’s mouth twitches, a barely-there twist of emotion, and he nods once. “Okay,” he says, and lifts his wand. “
He stumbles mid-step, staring at his wand, and Harry stops three steps ahead of him, immediately alarmed. “Draco?”
Harry groaned internally as he pushed his plate away, full to bursting from the rich food that the Ministry had provided. Sure, he loved feasts as much as the next person, but feasting every meal for an entire week was not nearly as appealing as it sounded.
“Then why?” Potter asks, eyebrows furrowing. “Why do you lie to me?”
Well, two’s company, as it was said. If Malfoy was scared, then Harry supposed the least he could do would be to admit the same. Anything to say to stop Malfoy from leaving—and the realization that he didn’t, in fact, want Malfoy to leave was more telling than anything.
Harry looks down at his stew and shrugs. He’s not sure, not sure at all. Then he thinks of Malfoy’s pale hands and red lips and really, really wishes he
“I’m glad we talked,” Potter says. “And I really am sorry.”
He’s not
“You know what? You’re right,” says Ron. “They can cover it. I’ll Owl Robards now.”
Harry storms into the small living room later that night, not even caring that the only thing he’s wearing is a haphazardly wrapped towel. All he’d wanted was to take a nice, relaxing shower, maybe with a lazy wank involved, and then Malfoy had to go and use
“Well? What now?” Malfoy asks, sounding amused.
“Holy fucking
Draco suddenly feeling guilty for snapping at her. “I’m sorry,” he says, and she waves off his apology. “No, really. But—but I’ve been doing more research on your condition lately, did I tell you? Maybe I’ll be able to find something soon, something that’ll make it easier for you to go out.”
But fuck, does Draco want him anyway.
“Oh?” Harry says, raising his eyebrows. “Do tell.”
Potter’s grin lights up the room, and Draco’s heart flutters madly as Potter reaches out to stroke a hand down his face. “I—I was worried you regretted it,” Potter tells him.
“No, no,” Malfoy says. “Like
“Yeah, probably,” Potter says, nudging his arm, making Draco look at him. “But so are you.”
“Yeah, okay,” Malfoy says, bottoming out and stilling, making a face as he adjusts.
“Well, I’m being honest with you now, okay?” Harry shoots back. “Look. I want you. I want you a lot. Okay? And maybe we can ignore it, and it’ll go away, and if that’s what you want then fine, I’ll deal with it. But if that’s not what you want...” He takes a deep breath, startled to realize that he’s nearly on the edge of tears. “But if there’s any chance you
know you. Everything about you. And I… I want to be there for you.”
“Look, Harry!” Hermione whispers, nudging his elbow, and he’s jolted back to the present—a present where he’s sitting in the middle of a crowded Great Hall, starry sky twinkling above and murmuring students surrounding him like a never-ending ocean. “The first years are lining up.” Hermione tilts her head toward the door.
He resists the urge to step any closer, because he wants to touch Malfoy so much it hurts, and he knows that if he gives in and does it he’ll lose all motivation to confront him. “If you—” he starts, then has to miserably clear his throat. “If you don’t want me, then just say so, all right?” he forces out, chest heaving.
want this,” the mirror says, in Potter’s voice.
“I don’t… want to,” Draco says, his mouth trembling. “Harry—”
The potion is urging him to say things, even with his thoughts all jumbled, and oh, he
Draco wants to punch something. But this time it’s not Potter. “I’m so
“Then why are you staring at me like I’m causing you pain?” Draco asks, crossing his arms but at the same time looking so vulnerable that Harry’s heart stutters.
Hermione wrinkles her nose. “Technically it’s my day off. I went in anyway, but I told myself I could take an extra-long lunch break today. Speaking of which,” she says, sliding the fourth generation of her beaded purse off of her shoulder and pulling out a couple of sandwiches. “Here.”
“I think it’s stupid,” Draco mutters immediately, and fuck if he’s being selfish but he doesn’t want Potter to
Instead of either of those things, Potter merely snorts. “I-I’ve got dinner at the Burrow—er, Ron’s family’s house—on Sunday. Other than that…” He shrugs, shoulder moving against Draco. “Kind of pitiful, h-huh?”
“Is it cold?” he asks.
“What? What is it?” Draco asks, looking concerned.
“That’s fine,” Harry says, smoothing his hand up and down Draco’s leg.
,’ Malfoy thinks, a whisper of worry coating his words.
They know him too well.
“Probably,” Malfoy says, a flicker of amusement in his expression. “Anyway, what I’m saying is—shall we make some sort of truce? For gatherings like this, at least. I don’t fancy having to be on my toes the whole time I’m out with Pansy, and well… she’s been spending most of her time with you lot, so. If we could agree not to hex each other, that would be grand.”
He knows it was the potion. Really, he does. But it
“You mean you’d make sweet, tender love to me—”
me in the first place?”
He makes his way off the dance floor, glancing every so often at Malfoy, who’s walked confidently up to the other man—now they’re exchanging words, now they’re dancing, now Malfoy’s wrapping his arms possessively around him the same way he’d done with Harry. Harry means to leave, he really does, but instead he finds himself lingering until the two of them start making their way to the door.
“It’s not Muggle science,” Draco mumbles, and really, it’s honestly easy to pick up on Potter’s tea drinking habits, seeing as he drinks several cups a day every morning at the office.
His hand tightens around his wand. “Fine,” he says, and his voice doesn’t shake but it wants to. “What do you have to tell me?”
Harry nods. “Sorry,” he says, hoping Malfoy isn’t angry.
He’s having trouble moving because it’s so cold in the house. The heating charms seem to have broken. “I don’t know what’s happening,” Harry shivers against Draco as they lay in bed.
He finds him in the classroom they did their painting sessions in, the torches low. Malfoy is sitting in one of the chairs, head hanging low, and all of a sudden Harry knows what’s happened.
“Hey Gin,” Hermione says, giving her a one-armed hug.
What…? What’s happening?
It takes him a long time to figure out the right wording, and not long after he sends it, he starts wishing he could call the owl back and burn the damned thing. But the owl is probably halfway to France by now. All he can do is wait.
Harry aims a small smile at Draco, and Draco sees it, snorting softly. “Sap,” he mutters under his breath.
Slowly, he sighs. “This was important to me,” he says. “And I’m really... I appreciate it. A lot. But the things that you want—that you need—those are important to me too, y’know?”
“She said I show a lot of promise,” Malfoy says. And then, all in a rush, he adds, “You could come with me.”
.’ Even though he has no way of knowing that, not really. “Sorry,” he says instead.
Harry hangs his head.
that he was sitting right next to Potter, even as the night dragged on and more people pulled chairs up to the table, shoving them closer and closer together.
“Draco,” Harry says, as if he’s just trying it out, and Draco can’t keep the smile from his own face even as he feels Harry’s palms spreading him open.
And it was as warm and comforting as it’s ever been on the Amortentia.
Malfoy doesn’t, of course. Instead he starts pressing his finger inside, so slowly Harry wants to cry, and Harry lets his head fall back, closing his eyes.
Malfoy doesn’t deign to address it, and Harry’s relieved. “Good, you’re here,” Malfoy says instead. Then he turns and beckons for Harry to follow him, so Harry does, trailing after him into the small kitchen. “Want a drink?”
Draco cooks dinner, a simple fry up that takes nothing more than a few flicks of his wand, and then he eats on the sofa as he’s done for years just because he knows his father would abhor it.
Harry laughs and shoves him back. Except then somehow they’re making out again, slower this time, Harry’s lips soft against his own.
Unfortunately, that hasn’t stopped Harry from accidentally staring at him more than once.
“Hmm?”
Slowly, Draco looks between Harry and the mirror.
Not even with him.
Harry swallows. He wants to invite Draco to stay over, but.
Draco sighed, shifting against the couch. “Yes, but… I’m not too eager to go out and have everyone call me a Death Eater, either.”
Shuddering a sob, Draco leans into him. “
But unfortunately for her, Harry’s not sure he even knows the answer to that. He shakes his head, standing and picking up his wand so that he can Summon all of the coins back into the pouch. “Dunno. Malfoy’s just… odd, I guess.”
Except Draco wants him here.
“What I mean is… hmm. It’ll be easier to show you, I think.” She digs around in the purse on her shoulder for a piece of parchment and a quill, scribbling down an address and handing it to Harry.
“I used to think so too,” Harry says. “It took a lot of practice, and I couldn’t have done it without George’s help, either. He knows a ton more about charms theory than I do.”
“You don’t have to give in,” Harry says, brows knitting together. “You don’t have to do that for me—”
“Wait, Malfoy! You don’t even know—”
The tiniest part of him wishes he could have stayed.
“Of course you didn’t,” Malfoy says, a half-smile on his lips. “I went out of my way to be an arse to you for most of our time at Hogwarts.”
“It isn’t?” Harry says—but then he thinks back to both of the times they’ve kissed and frowns. “Wait. It hasn’t been hurting you, has it? God, I’m sorry, I didn’t know—”
He takes a deep breath and says, “I don’t think you’re scum of the earth.”
“Then why this?” Harry asks, frowning. “Why come to my shop and bring me pastries and—and
“None of your business,” Malfoy tries to mutter.
“I could have.”
“Just get it over with,” Harry mumbles, trying to act uninterested, but it’s mostly because he
But this is the only way he can get rid of his growing feelings for Malfoy. This is for the better. He has to push him out before Malfoy consumes him like he’s done so many times before, except in a way so much more dangerous because the moment Malfoy turns on him again, Harry knows it will break him.
A month passes.
After a moment, Harry tries again. “Draco?”
“Not anything in particular. But that would be conceding to you.”
He hates not being able to tell her anything—Hermione and Ron both. His dinners with them lately have been mostly the two of them talking rather than Harry, and he doesn’t at all mind sitting and listening to their tales from work, but he wishes he could at least tell them
And then Malfoy
“Yeah,” Harry says, leaning into Draco’s side. “I reckon we are.”
“What is it, Harry?” Hermione pushed a few strands of hair behind her ear, sliding her other hand into Ron’s.
“Sap,” Draco mutters, a small smile on his lips nonetheless.
Draco stares dejectedly at the slim piece of wood, his companion for seven years, and thinks of when he was young—when he hadn’t yet used this wand to hurt anyone.
“I love you,” Harry says, pressing their foreheads together and closing his eyes.
“Potter,” Malfoy says, his mouth going slack. Then he shakes his head, his eyes going all sad. “Potter, no.”
“Oh,” Potter says, looking at him, seeming just the slightest bit unsteady. “…Yeah. Okay.”
There was a night where he spent most of the night watching Draco sit in the corner, nursing a drink and barely speaking, just like Harry was. The night was almost over when, in a snap decision, Harry got up and went to sit beside him.
“He was bollocks at it at first,” Harry reveals, barely biting back a laugh as Malfoy kicks him under the table.
Malfoy grimaces. “I suspect we only have a few minutes.”
“Fine,” Draco snaps.
He takes a breath and hates that he almost feels hopeful right now. “Are you going to come in or not?”
“Yes. If I’m not pulling at the club instead.”
that,” Harry complains, flushing. “Just because we’ve made out doesn’t mean I’m afraid to hex you.”
Harry stares at him, suddenly disappointed. “Really?”
“What won’t work?” Harry asks, suddenly annoyed—“Just bloody ignoring it like we have been?”
“That’s all right,” Harry says. Then he grins. “You kissed me, so I suppose we’re even.”
Malfoy didn’t even bother turning around. “You have no idea, Potter,” Harry just barely caught the answer. But Malfoy doesn’t continue his sentence, so Harry never finds out what he ought to have an idea of.

“Stupid, isn’t it?” Draco says, shaking his head. Why did he ever
“Thank fuck,” Draco says, relaxing, and Ron lets out a sigh of relief.
His stomach churns as he realizes he’ll have to break the news to Ron at some point.
“Potter,” Draco says, “Please don’t. It’s—it’s too much.”
Harry tenses. “I told you not to say that.”
He has a

, Draco.”
me to have my way with you again—”
“I can’t sleep like this.”
“Tell me,” Draco says, terrified, staring straight at him, at those green eyes he adores so much—“Tell me the truth.”
For a second, Harry says nothing, and Draco’s lungs seize in terror—but then Harry pushes at Draco’s hip, turning him over and climbing on top of him, and Draco can see that he’s smiling.
Harry feels like a ghost.
“Aye aye, sir,” Esther says cheekily, grinning as she bends down to count the till.
“She’ll be okay,” Draco says, although there’s worry lining his face. “She’s a strong woman.”
Draco finally forces the words out. “I… I can Obliviate you if you really want me to.”
He fights down the panic that threatens to rise in his chest. More than anything, he doesn’t want to let anyone down, least of all Hermione and Ron, and they both think he’s going into the Aurors after school. Hence the books Hermione gave him with so much hope in her eyes.
“You know what, fuck you,” Draco blurts out, suddenly incensed—and here it is. They’re fighting again.
Harry is out shopping when he feels a light tap on his shoulder, turning to see a slight woman with dark hair and pretty eyes. She’s holding a basket containing only a baguette and a block of cheese. “Er,” he says, “Sorry, was I in the way?”
It’s only right, Draco supposes, that he’s leaning up against the mirror, hands gripping at its edges when Potter first presses a slick finger inside him. “
Draco nodded along with Harry’s words. “And it’s not like I can talk about it, because I deserve everything I’ve gotten…”
Fuck it.
“Draco—“ Harry paused at the sound of footsteps, but the guard passed by their hall without even looking, repelled by the full-strength Notice-Me-Not charms. “You don’t understand, Draco. You’re being ridiculous.”
,” Hermione starts again. “The only way out of this isn’t something I would recommend, nor do I think it’s going to be something you two want to do, either.”
, is what he wanted to say. But he’s slowly realizing that to some extent, it
Harry stares at him.
Potter’s type and that’s probably not even true—
Harry chokes out a gasp.
Harry frowns at him. “No, that’s not—that’s not true. I’d notice if you were gone, and—and I wouldn’t be glad.”
Anymore.
Harry does the same, heart hurting, haphazardly slinging his pants and trousers on and wondering with a pang where they went wrong.
It feels so nice it almost hurts.
Astoria gives him a look that says she doesn’t fully believe him, but sighs, shrugging. “Well, even if you hate him… that’s better than nothing, isn’t it?”
But when he rounds the corner and walks into her hospital room, he finds it empty, the bed stripped of its sheets.
Draco swats his arse, breath heavy on Harry’s skin. “Don’t—don’t relax just yet. I’m not done with you.”
He’s been spending more and more of his time there lately, even though imposing his presence on them so often is a habit he tried to kick years ago, and mostly succeeded at. They’re married now, and truly, he wants to give them their space. Still, whenever he’s lonely or scared or hurt, they’re the ones he turns to, and he’s grateful that they still welcome him in with open arms.
“Fucking
at him.
“A good question for once,” Malfoy says, expression schooled blank as he sets his glass of whiskey down on the table. His eyes narrow. “Give me one reason why I should sleep with you.”
“Okay, fine,” Draco says, rolling his eyes. “I feel a bit better, I suppose.”
“Oh, er—I just thought that you must be feeling a bit better, if you were making fun of me,” Potter says.
Potter covers his face with his hands. “Yes.”
“Oh, this is mostly for fun,” Harry says, shrugging as he picks up the clock. “I’ve never been able to figure out how to charm electrical things—they always glitch halfway through. So I’m just fiddling, really. I can take a break.”
But being able to time it is helpful, at least.
So he doesn’t.
He walked for a while, but stress still ebbed at his mood. He wished that the event was over already, so he could get back to his normal past-time of doing absolutely nothing.
,” he gasps.
“By the way,” Hermione says. “Would you all mind if I recorded your genetic information? Just to test my methods on, so if there really are big differences between Pureblood and non-Pureblood DNA, I’ll be able to pick them up by comparing the samples.”
“I’m not going to hurt you,” Harry felt the need to say. He supposed he could understand why Malfoy was so guarded against him, but it still stung a bit.
look at him, and Harry has to will away the thrum of lust that hits him when he locks eyes with Malfoy—no, no, absolutely not. He
It was inevitable, wasn’t it?
Malfoy huffs. “You’re going to make me say it, aren’t you?”
“Oh,” Potter murmurs, his gaze heavy but fond as his eyes meet Draco’s own. “You said—”
“What… oh,” Harry says. Fuck. And now he’s the one flushing, hurriedly rescuing his towel from where it’d started slipping down as he turns and flees back to the bathroom. Then he breathes a sigh of relief as he steps back into the warm shower, thankful that Malfoy didn’t end up seeing anything of consequence.
“We could try it.”
Harry shrugs, looking down at their hands, Malfoy’s pale against Harry’s skin. “Dunno,” he says. “Is this okay?”
Malfoy bites his lip. Then he flips them over, and after a moment of tangled limbs, Harry is on top of him, straddling his thighs. “Okay,” he says, helping Harry position himself. “Do it.” ‘
“You’re brilliant,” he says, barely thinking about it, gasping as Draco twists his hand just right.
But then Malfoy tilts his head down and starts mouthing at Harry’s neck, and oh,
Potter’s lets out a laugh. “Yeah, I s’pose you’re right,” he says, and chuckles again. “Although you’ve a bit of bite in you too, you know. Considering,” he adds, his eyes flicking down to where his fingers are pumping in and out of Draco’s arse.
“I don’t think that’s because of Allure,” Harry says, and as the words come out of his mouth, he knows instinctively that they’re true. He remembers what the Allure feels like from that first day in the shop. What he’s feeling now—it’s something different entirely. “I think I just—am really attracted to you,” he admits softly.
“Take these off,” Draco says, pinching at Harry’s trousers, and Harry complies, even though his nervousness is only growing. Then they’re both half-naked, lying side by side and kissing again, and Harry thinks to himself that this is very nearly everything he’s wanted these past few weeks.
Fuck.
“Never asked what?” Harry says.
Potter grins at him easily, and it’s
Harry's body flashes cold as he realizes that if he really wants to do this, he needs to stop hiding.
“Nngh, yes, all right,” Malfoy gasps, and then he’s Scourgifying his hand and climbing over to Harry, on top of him, settling back on his hands so that Harry’s between his legs. Harry slides down so he’s lying flat on the couch, grabbing at Malfoy’s thighs, his arse, to help position him—
He thinks of the closed off parts of the Manor, then thinks too of the closed off parts of himself—even to this day, he won’t go to Diagon alone, as the snide words and hexes hurled behind his back make him want to scream. So he stays in and gets their groceries through owl order—to save more time for research on Astoria, he tells himself—and… oh.
Except then he feels a strange sort of urge to keep going, to walk over and smile at Draco, maybe to impress him with some sort of magic display—
And Potter’s eyes are fucking sparkling.
Draco shakes his head, already pulling his robes on. “Sorry, erm. The suppressants are wearing off. I didn’t even think about it—I usually don’t need to take them again until the morning, but—”  He cuts off, looking nervous. “I don’t want to accidentally use my Allure on you. I think that might end quite badly.”
. And more than that, they’ve only been not-enemies for so long. “I need some time to think about it, maybe.”
And Potter
“Potter,” Draco says, wiping at his own face, squeezing his eyes shut. “Please don’t let her be alone,” he chokes out, even though this is a ridiculous thing to ask.
And really, is it so far from the truth in this moment?
“Fire,” Malfoy said after a while. A multitude of memories flashed through Harry’s mind: the Room of Requirement, hands clutching at his back, the acrid smell of smoke.
Looking down, Hermione licks her lips. “I just have a feeling that there’s more to this than he’s told you,” she says quietly. “I won’t tell you my suspicions, just in case I’m wrong, but. I think you should go see him.”
Not to mention that his year spent doing nothing had taught him that the Aurors were neither his top career choice, nor the most trustworthy people. Yes, there were those who valued justice and fairness, but when Death Eaters were involved it became an entirely different story. He’d heard whispers of forged documents and Confunded eyewitnesses involved in the capture of more than a few Voldemort sympathizers. Everyone had. And he’d turned a blind eye. They had deserved it… right?
Harry wrinkles his nose. “Honestly, Esther, you don’t have to call me ‘sir’. I’m not a Hogwarts Professor, you know.” Not to mention that it reminds him of Snape, which is something he’d rather not think about.
Draco opens his eyes to make a face at him. “Isn’t that a little strange?”
One could easily become addicted to standing here, staring at the pearly sheen of the fountain, wondering at its depths. He forces himself to turn away. This room will be a comfort in the coming days, he thinks, because while he’s done being a Trainee, specialty rotations aren’t supposed to be easy either.
“You don’t realize a lot of things, Potter,” Draco grumbles, and then sighs. “Surprised you’ve even noticed this.”
“Then I guess you don’t want me that badly after all,” Harry says, shrugging.
“I didn’t realize,” Potter says. “I thought you were just being aloof to spite me.”
God. He’s so fucked.
me, and obviously for good reason. I was—” He stops, seeming shaky, and then his eyes flare and he reaches over and yanks up his own sleeve, baring his faded Mark. “I had this fucking thing.”
“Absolutely,” Harry agrees, even though he’s having a difficult time thinking about anything except the way Draco’s body is pressed all up against him. Briefly he wonders if they’re going to fight about this eventually, because that’s how it always seems to be between them, even now. Then he wonders if maybe after they fight, they’ll end up finally fucking in a fit of passion, and the idea is so hot that he can’t help lifting his hips at the thought of it.
He sucks in a ragged breath. “Six months ago,” he says, voice hoarse. “In the corridor at work.”
. It’s stupid to ask what happened though, probably—Malfoy will just give him another ‘it’s none of your business,’ just as he usually does.
’,” he mimics cruelly.
Slowly, he removes his hands from around Malfoy’s back, swallowing thickly—because Malfoy, too, is still hard inside of him. “You won’t keep going,” he goads.
Draco gives an exasperated sigh and flashes a two-fingered salute to the lot of them. “What’s your point?” he snaps at Blaise.
He fights the urge to close his eyes, to pretend Potter’s not
Harry wants to protest, but he holds his tongue. After all, it’s not like Draco will want to spend the night or anything, as much as Harry might want him to.
He walks to the door, looking over his shoulder at Draco, and catches a glimpse of Seb standing at the top of the stairs with an expression that mirrors Esther’s. Harry grins then, gesturing to Draco. “Coming?”
,” Malfoy complains, and Harry wonders if he’s using his surname on purpose. Whatever it is, it’s kind of hot.
“You don’t seem so dignified when we’re fucking.”
Then he positions his cock and pushes slowly inside him, and Harry loses all ability to speak, clutching at Draco’s sides and squeezing his eyes shut. Fuck, Draco is inside him, oh God—“Fuck,” he says aloud, nearly a whimper. “You feel good.”
Harry’s heart pounds in his chest. “I do too,” he admits. “But… I’ll take whatever you can give me. Even just this. I… I like it. A lot.”
“Yes,” Potter says, a spark of something in his eyes, and Draco’s longing for him roars to life stronger than it’s ever been, scrabbling at his chest until he’s seconds away from doing something awful like touching him.
Malfoy opens his mouth, but clicks it closed and looks away. “It’s fine. I was already awake.”
Later, after Hermione and Ron have gone to bed since they both head to work early in the morning, Harry finally finishes his book and sets it down on the coffee table along with his scroll of notes. “Merlin, I feel like I’m cramming for the NEWTS again,” he mumbles, leaning back against the sofa.
“I’m not, honest,” Harry shook his head. “Really. Something happened, but it’s not… it’s not like that. And it’s completely unrelated to Malfoy,” he tacked on, hoping she would believe him.
“I fucked you because I wanted to,” Potter says. “I wanted
And yet, Potter’s been thinking about it too, hasn’t he? He has to have at least somewhat, if that’s the lie he’s been telling.
. He has no need to feel embarrassed.
Harry stares at her, trying desperately to ignore the two men tangled together on the bed, which is difficult because just then Malfoy lets out a low moan and Harry
“I did, just now, they’re on their way—Merlin, this is all my fault—”
Harry stands shakily, chest heaving with sobs that ache to escape. But he won’t cry. Not now.
Draco fucks him, in their cold and colorless room where the leak in the ceiling has only gotten worse. It’s a last breath of happiness, a last memory of what could have been. Harry knows it’s ending.
“You all right, mate?” the man with his hands on Draco says, the first man Draco’s tried to do this with since the last time on Amortentia. Draco’s already forgotten his name.
“Okay,” Potter says. He closes his eyes briefly, and when he opens them, he looks subdued. “In the beginning… well, I suppose I didn’t want to turn you down. I’m bad at saying no when people… when people need help.”
“Okay,” Draco says, suddenly nervous, even as Potter helps him out of the rest of his clothes, even as Potter spreads him out on top of the sheets, on his hands and knees, face pressed into the pillow. Potter murmurs a lubrication spell, and it occurs to Draco that he’s never done this with someone else before—and maybe he should tell Potter that, but then Potter’s fingers are slick at his arse and he can’t speak.
Potter licks over his hole again, now messy and tender and slick with spit and lube, and raises an eyebrow. “Hmm?”
“Really?” Harry asks, but then Draco stretches up to kiss him and he forgets the question.
Harry snorts. Then he takes a chance and says something brazen. “Think it’d piss him off if we fucked and got caught?”
Harry bites his lip. He’s sweating now, from the effort of holding himself up and holding back his cries, the ones he would normally make when Malfoy’s thrusting his finger inside of him. “Yeah, well you’re an absolute git,” he mutters.
And then... nothing.
“Hullo,” Harry says. “Where did the Weasleys go? And Pansy?”
“You’re utterly ridiculous,” Draco mumbles, sliding his arm around Harry’s shoulders.
Shame rises in his throat then, and he wants to laugh. He and Potter will never be close enough for Draco’s tastes—Potter is golden, and Draco can never touch him.
“I do. Don’t worry,” Malfoy says, an amused smile growing on his lips. “If it makes a difference to you, Potter, I’ll hold your hand.”
Malfoy wants him to say that he loves him.
Harry can’t stop from grinning then, even as Draco kisses the smile off his face, even as Draco holds him tighter than he ever has before—and in that moment, Harry’s happier than he was even under the Imperius—even when he’d had nothing to worry about at all. “Draco,” he sighs out.
, but it’s honestly criminal how sexy Potter looks in those trousers.
“When are you going to tell him?” the mirror asks.
“I like it too,” Draco tells him, and then he puts his head on Harry’s chest and fucks into him faster and, for the second time that night, he comes inside Harry, shaking and clutching at his shoulders.
“You know what? You were right. It’s a good time to leave,” Malfoy says, and drains his drink.
“Are you saying you’d trust my word over that of your precious Aurors, Potter? Please,” Malfoy glared at him.
Tears sting at his eyes.
, and for a moment he has to work to fight back the anger that bubbles up behind his clenched teeth.
Draco rolls his eyes in a way that feels almost fond, turning away again. “Sure, Potter.”
At the edge of his vision, Astoria nods. “Right then,” she says, standing and walking to the door. “By the way—the spell to make the other side transparent is
“I know,” Harry says. “But it feels nice.”
“You don’t think it’s weird?” Draco asks.
He thought maybe all of this would get easier with time. But every time he catches a glimpse of Malfoy at work, his gut clenches, and it feels like he’s been stabbed through the heart all over again.
Except Malfoy casts a Shield Charm at the last moment.
“You two know that, and I know that, but the Ministry doesn’t seem to care. We’ve tried to reason with them, but they won’t listen, and… I’m terribly sorry, but there are Aurors on the way here to apprehend Mr. Malfoy as we speak.” She looked down, mouth tightened into a thin line. “I will continue to say anything I can in your defense, Mr. Malfoy. You’ve been an excellent trainee, and neither of you have shown any signs of trouble this summer. There’s not a doubt in my mind that you were not the orchestrator of this monstrosity, but the Aurors will be hard to convince.”
“To be fair, I
Harry nods sullenly, wishing Lupin a begrudging ‘Happy Christmas’ as Lupin leaves with a swish of robes. The door shuts behind him a bit too hard, resulting in a loud booming noise that aggravates the headache Harry can already feel starting to form.
“Good,” Harry says, relieved. “Not that I enjoy keeping things from Ron, but—it isn’t my place to tell him, you know?”
He lets Potter take him apart with slow tenderness, the kind he’s come to expect from Potter the past few days. Potter figures out exactly what places make Draco jump and moan, what makes his eyes go wide, what makes him shudder with anticipation. He grows hard under Potter’s hands as Potter works his way down his chest; he bites back a sob as Potter pulls down the waistband of his pants and sucks at his hipbone.
Slowly, he allows himself to relax—to take advantage of Harry Potter, warm in his bed.
And then they go home.
“I don’t know if he’s good for me,” Harry admits quietly. “But—but I care about him. A lot.”
It’s a hard blow, even though Harry knew it was coming. “Fuck,” he mumbles. “And the others—they’re not getting better?”
Ron shook his head at Hermione and muttered something that sounded suspiciously like girls, before heading back out of the room.
It didn't help that he was curious as well. It was all treasure to him, something that was a part of Harmony that he now knew. The first memory he caught was a very ugly fat man with a purple face spitting at a younger boy looking Potter. Draco passed up that memory quickly and turned to her thoughts. 'I can't' he picked up, "I hope he doesn't see'. This made Draco even more curious, but something in the way her thoughts were scared made Draco pull away. He left with a small thought of his own. 'You have to really want me out' Draco told her. Harmony gasped as Draco left her thoughts. She didn't look at him as she tried to catch her breath. Draco felt awful for intruding into her thoughts.
"At this rate it should be you two getting the lessons, you are grown men, be a good influence and tolerate each other." McGonagall snapped, giving them annoyed looks as if they should be sent to kindergarten to be taught to hold hands and learn basic courtesy. Asking the two to be friends was almost as possible as asking them to frolic in a meadow of daisies. Hand in hand as well with harps playing in the back. She shuddered from the bad mental images and suspected what her nightmares would bring. At least Snape wouldn't be staying the nights, then she really would have something to fear.
"Whatever, let's just work on this potion," Draco placated. "I'll even get the ingredients with you to make sure that you get the right ones." Harmony walked in front, passing tables that were already chopping and brewing their calming drought. She passed Snape without meeting his haunting gaze and pushed the closet door with more force than necessary and didn't bother to hold it out for him. After a few moments she heard the door close and the walls glowed with a faint white light.
"I think that you mixed up unicorn with wombat," Luna said. They stared at the girl before clenching their mouths and trying not to laugh too loudly.
"He never knew about me since he was in Azkaban."
"I want you." Blaise stepped forward, till she was nearly in his reach.
After seeing his look of confusion, Harmony just twisted out of his grasp and turned away from him, knowing that there was no point trying to hide it. She pulled up the back of her shirt, revealing the damage that was still there. "I wasn't kidding when I said that the dragon almost got me." She explained lightly.
"Dumbledore is planing a way to destroy you completely." Voldemort cursed under his breath, the little light around him darkened.
Draco picked up where she left off, "we went to Maui, to Salzburg and Budapest, spent a week in Brazil, we flew through the Grand Canyon, swam in the Great Barrier Reef, walked on the Great Wall, toured a couple major cities and national parks. That kind of thing."
"Uh…since April."
"Dobby, please," Harmony said and kneeled in front of him, looking into his green eyes, as she almost pleaded, "I really need your help."
"Yeah, I'm sure Dumbledore just has your best interest in mind."
Ginny looked at the dark growth suspiciously saying, "I don't remember that being here before."
"EXPELLIARMUS!"
Harmony sat at the usual table on the café patio where she could relax and finish her tall glass of water. It was exceedingly hot that late afternoon, and she wore a loose red tank top and white shorts. Though the material was thin she felt it stick uncomfortably to her skin. A day had passed since her birthday and Ron and Hermione still hadn't sent anything to her. The heat forced many of the wizards and witches to escape indoors and she wanted to wait till it got a bit darker before heading back.
"Tell us what happened," she coaxed and Ron nodded happily. Something pricked at Harmony's chest, a cold dread that hung over her.
"I'll be careful," Harmony said, meeting Sirius's unwavering gaze.
Draco turned his head and watched the other students. The Slytherins and Gryffindors were spread out through the room, and he saw that most of the lot had constipated looks. "Professor,"
"Beats me," Harmony said, not having thought of the match yet.
"You have got to be kidding me…Dumbledore allows it"
"Strange, its almost as if-"
The perfect scene was cut short as Draco jumped into the water. Blaise had a moment of apprehension as he realized that Draco was a lot more possessive than he had given him credit for. Possibly enough for him to hex somebody.
"Nothing, master," came Lucious's response.
"No, we play sports and exercise most of the time," Ginny responded, "Why have fun?" A smirk formed on her lips.
"You are all wrong," Leighton concluded, " though Luna would be the closest. An animal with a look so menacing, so misunderstood, that it was killed on sight, and is now believed to be extinct. Severus would be the Thylacine," after noticing their blank stares he added, "more commonly known as the Tasmanian Tiger."
"Ron, they're joking," Hermione said as she gave the twins a disapproving look.
"You don't mind me being there?" Draco asked. She looked at him sideways and Draco looked into her girl like appearance while he had the chance.
"Dumbledore requested for somebody to watch over you during winter break, and I convinced them that it should be me. I guess Dumbledore wanted it as a surprise."
She was too wary of discovery to even try wandless magic on the blisters across her back. Even now, a month later, they ached, and refused to heal properly. Harmony had to endure the slow recovery all while her Uncle Vernon came up with increasingly nastier comments about his opinions of bums and vagrants and school drop outs, and while Aunt Petunia seemed to come up with new and harder chores for her to do each day.
"I love you," was what he said. Draco didn't know who was more surprised at the words, Harmony or himself.
Harmony sat perfectly still, conscious that any move may make the girl burn her ear or scalp. Harmony didn't think it possible, but her hair stayed down after she put something into it. Ginny looked at her nails and sighed. "Really?" Ginny asked, as if her nails were offensive.
"They took the first years back to Hogwarts with Dobby. My Father apparated us here." Harmony blinked up in surprise, "now he's in hiding."
"Yes." Draco thought he might as well humor them.
Harry awoke disoriented, hungry, and in need to use the loo. He hadn't been up since the previous day and he blinked slowly up at Dumbedore and Snape. He saw Dumbledor's eyes twinkling, and Snape's pale face was even more ashen and took on the look of a goldfish out of its tank. Harry rubbed his emerald eyes and could barely think straight.
"I have sneakers," she said and Ginny rolled her eyes.
Harmony placed her hands on Draco's in an effort to hoist him up. "Come on," she said, "you guys promised that you would show me around. I heard the kitchens have millions of elves!" Harmony grinned when Draco got his stuff and she looked at Blaise next.
They passed three halls and several classrooms before Draco started to wonder their destination. "Where you are going?" he finally asked.
She didn't dare call out to see if anyone was there. She timidly stepped into the wide hall where along the walls were statues of life sized men, with sour looks on the lot of them, staring down at her. There were empty portraits with silver frames that hung askew, vases with dead flowers, and a thin layer of dust that veiled the Victorian cabinets. The floor was a spotted marble, and light passed through the windows like ink splotches. Her wand was held out, and she took slow steps so that she could hear inside the rooms as she passed. Harmony looked back before stepping on a stairway, and tracing the rail that curved in a tight spiral. The tip of her wand let off a light glow as she descended into the dark. The temperature dropped, and the coolness chilled her heated face.
"We could have some punch," Draco said.
"Sorry," Draco said.
"Ah, but add Gryffindors to the equation and they would gladly throw themselves head long to the very heart of it." Harmony shrugged her shoulders, knowing that she had already planned keeping her friends safe from her path. "Ugh, I really didn't want to make you angry at me," he said with his hand at the back of his platinum blond hair, as if just catching himself acting like a complete arse. "Just see that you have options, more than being some kind of human sacrifice." He looked a bit uncertain as if he really hadn't though the conversation through. "There are those who don't want to see your death." He sighed at last, turning away from her, but if she saw him she would not have been able to read him anyway.
Sirius Black? He hadn't even known that Sirius had a kid. But that made sense. Sirius was a looker back before his stint in Azkaban. "Oh, that explains it." Charlie said. From the corner of his eye, he caught George stifling a snigger and Fred pretending to vomit.
"Thanks Ginny, but I don't need to be protected."
The announcement came early May, just before midnight, as an amplified voice of their head of house. Harmony woke up with a start, having heard the announcement repeated, in her ear once more. She quickly put on her Potter guise and glasses after throwing her black cloak over her thin pajamas and placing her wand in her inner pocket. "Gather in the common room, everyone wake up..." She scratched her hair, ruffled it all up, so it looked like the end of a rooster. Just in case, she skipped over her slippers and put on her shoes.
"So you need any books for your first year at Hogwarts?" He asked.
"Potter!" came a voice from Snape's office, "Remove your presence from my door this instant, I do not want to hear another thing from you!" The ferret squeaked and Harmony shot up and began to run, just in time before the door burst open and an angry Snape stepped out into the hall. "No running in the halls! 25 Points from GRYFFINDOR!"
"Then help me find out what is wrong." She turned her head as Harmony came with a trailing Luna. Harmony looked as she always did, like a disgruntled 13 year old boy. Sometimes forgetting is easier. She passed them without a word, and went straight to Leighton's door. When the door opened, a girl stepped through, and Draco's heart twisted. There was no hiding misery. Inside the room, none of the students bothered with any small talk. Not with Harmony and her tight lips and crossed arms.
She finished bathing and dried off to change. When she was finally ready she checked the time and wished herself an early happy birthday.
"Wha- what are you talking about?" She blinked slowly. The door opened and an angry Weasley and Granger dragged in a much relieved Longbottom. Draco finally pulled away from her while chuckling softly.
"Do your parents know about Harmony?" Blaise asked as they sat in the common rooms. Draco flipped through his Charms essay, checking for errors. The common room was mostly empty, since about this time, it was Hufflepuff hunting.
"Tell me what happened," Snape asked, and Draco did. The only thing that he left out was the kiss that Harmony and he had shared. It was maddening to think that simple kiss had started it all. And as much as it had damned him, it was worth more than he could have ever imagined. He had waited for that moment, when he knew with an absolute certainty that she would not have pushed him away. He had watched her innocent blushes, and had controlled himself. Till that very night when he could see her longing there and wanted to brush away all of her doubts and insecurities. Draco wanted to laugh at himself. He had been a fool, who had lost it all.
Snape was glowering at some first year potion essays when Harmony came to his door. He frowned at the girl, and not from his usual pretense. She stood at his office awkwardly. "What is it?" he asked her in a drawn out voice, as if it took his whole breath to say those three short words.
"No," Blaise got out, "I just think that you've been hanging out with them too much," he waved his hand where the Gryffindors were. "You need someone who thinks like you." The boy tapped the dark skin of his forehead and smirked.
Their first fight began during the Great Hall, as the owls brought in the morning post- dropping the letters on students' plates. Draco watched as his eagle owl swooped down to the boy wonder and Harmony caught the parchment with an easy flick of the wrist. She flipped it between her hands, and Draco watched with a smile as she broke the wax. He could only see the back of her head, but still he pictured the shock and small intake of breath. She'd see what he had written in his angular script. Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like mine?
"Thanks Ron," Harmony smiled, feeling a tad guilty that she had not really talked with either him or Hermione, even though they sat together at meals. "But shouldn't you guys have a date or something?" Hermione pinked at that, but Ron did not notice that as he leaned across the table, or that parts of his robes were getting oatmeal stains.
"Yeah, whatever," she muttered.
"Oh," Harmony mouthed out, "Your animagus animal and protronus are the same." Leighton smiled at her.
"You'd better change back before anyone sees," Draco persisted to look anywhere but at the girl, but he was aware as she shrugged her shoulders and shifted her body. He let out a breath he had no idea he was holding and faced the now boyish looking Potter. But still his heartbeat skittered, he could see the girl in his mind's eye, and he could not turn away from Harmony. Looking at the boy now, it was easy to fool himself into thinking that Potter was disgusting.
"So you picked Draco Malfoy over Harry," Hermione mused, shaking her head confused. "Why him?"
"Did you get the picture I sent you?" Draco asked suddenly.
"Just be glad that he doesn't test it out on you. Snape's revenge on anyone is something to fear."
Luna and Ginny pulled her close, and the sting of parting caught her throat. "This isn't the end," Ginny whispered into her ear, and Harmony tore herself from them without words to betray her. They would fight for her, rallying the students.
When they had finally walked out of the store, as Draco held the bag of Harmony's purchases, he decided that he had spent just about enough time doing what everyone else wanted to do.
"I'm taking the scenic route." Draco brought up the papers in his hand to look at the map of Hogwarts with all the rooms labeled.
"Then do you want to go to the girl's changing room?" Draco smirked.
"Good," Leighton said softly. "I want you to picture something in your mind to act as a shield, and to only focus on that. Like a protonus, think of something that can protect you, or something that gives you strength and happiness. That will be the anchor to your mind."
"For what reason?"
"Do you have anything else, like sandals?"
Upon entering the classroom, she was glad to see that the majority of students in their seats were wearing the red and gold color scheme to their school uniform. She soon spotted Ron in a far left desk along the wall and plopped down beside him. "Hey Harry, I didn't catch you at breakfast."
"Does it hurt?" Draco asked.
"Don't fret, we will deliver the clothes and get a bite at the Pegasus Diner." Harmony followed closely behind her and wondered if Mcgonagall ever had a daughter or anyone to take care of. It was hard to imagine any of the Hogwart's staff having families, or at least married. They seemed content though, unless teaching really was secretly a miserable affair.
"Whatever," Draco said.
"I am!" she said, and once again Snape was in her head. He was delving further into the memories that she desperately wanted to hide. She didn't want him to see her kissing Draco or witness other personal memories. When ever he got close, her mind became blank, and she thought of nothing. Sometimes she showed him things that she didn't care for him to see. She allowed her memories of previous potions class and divinations to fill her mind. Snape seemed to notice, but didn't offer any encouragement. He probably thought it was better to see nothing, than to see the memories that showed who she really was.
"Hey baby, just wanted to check to see if you were alive and in need for some mouth to mouth resuscitation," Dudley leered at her. A small part of Harry died that moment, but luckily she was breathing and had not aspirated on her impending vomit. Ickle Diddykins was putting the moves on her and he so obviously did not know how to perform CPR anyway.
"It's a weed that likes no light, it probably spread from the pipes," Luna said.
"You could come during the summer," Charlie said with a wide smile.
"Juliet Maystone," she made up, "and Sirius Black."
"This is my task. I don't expect others to follow."
"It is quiet nice and extravagant here," Luna remarked before Kingscross counted to three, and they left. The familiar grounds of Hogwarts were not welcome to Draco's eyes. He didn't look at the others staring at him, and strode out the room, before he had to hear another word to grate against his brain. Tomorrow was the Halloween dance, and when his head hit his pillow, he fell into a fitful sleep.
"Shite," Harmony winced, "I knew that I shouldn't have put maggots under his pillow. You trust him?"
When he got back to his compartment he was still smiling. Pansy though looked desperate for his attention and he simply ignored her staring.
"Thanks," she mumbled as gave him a warm hug. "Thank you for being here with me." It meant more than she could ever express.
"It's fine." Harmony replied, too preoccupied to care for the newspaper's petty bull. She ignored both the glares that were sent her way, as well as Hermione's mutterings.
Draco had to stop his hand from crumpling Leighton's note. The letter was absurd, and he could not believe that Leighton was still calling her Cub. He had a mind not to go. That obnoxious bear! She was not his to call cub. Draco noticed that she watching him, and he pulled out his quill to scribble on the parchment that he would be there. After that, Harmony retreated back into herself, and Draco watched the black figure of Snape. When class ended, Draco went alone. His slytherine mates wanted nothing to do with him, and Draco muttered that he could care less. He didn't need them either.
"Would you rather I be mean?" Draco asked.
"I didn't know."
"It's-" Harmony said between laughs, "just that you look like a kid discovering candy for the first time. Who would have guessed that you would like the telly."
"Unfortunately no. And don't worry, no one will look at your toes tomorrow from under your shoes, so you don't have to worry if you forget." Harmony shut her mouth as she pulled off her overlarge socks and threw them across the floor.
"Yes," he said slowly, "your face." She felt her cheeks, wondering if some stray crumb was left from dinner. "It's bad enough to see it in class. Change it." It didn't take longer then three seconds as she understood him and dropped the magic from around her face. Harmony felt awkward as he scrutinized her further.
"I was going to tell you mate," Ron stumbled through, "but Hermione said that it would be best to keep it on the down low. That you would feel bad or something," he began to laugh nervously.
"Get out, you git." Damn it. I am a calm lake, a flowing butterfly in the breeze.
"Harry… sorry to ruin the moment, but you're bleeding."
Above her, Ginny circled ready to dive, but there was a roar that shook them all. Harmony faced the bear that was crashing through the forest towards them. Above the bear a lemur climbed swung further up the branches, and Draco looked for a place where he wouldn't be squished. Harmony stood her ground, awaiting the challenge of the brown bear. The caracal within would not allow her to run. She waited till he was nearly atop her before lunging away, barely missing the paw that swiped at her head. Her muscles were taught and powerful throughout her body, and it didn't take much to jump three meters into the air; onto the thick end of a branch where Luna hung, clutching cartoonishly at the swinging branch. Luna's eyes were two blue blurs, and soon she jumped from the branch landing delicately on the spot between the ears of the grizzly bear. Harmony got ready to pounce down on the bear as well, but the talons aiming at her behind surprised her. She yowled, unable to turn around to face Ginny.
"Glad to see you alive," he retorted, "show me the bite." Draco cleared the remains of his robe and allowed the teacher to bring his wand close to the raw looking flesh. There were puncture wounds were teeth had broken skin and the putrid saliva dribbled from his ankle. The pain disappeared immediately and his foot appeared unscathed. Draco didn't thank him.
It was like grains of sand crawled under her skull, grating against her mind. Harmony could barely stand, let alone guard her thoughts. "Legimens!" Her eyes dilated, and a cool numbness trickled through her senses.
"I found out what I wanted, and I was also able to accept me." Draco took a breath, "As well as the parts that I couldn't allow myself to acknowledge." There was unmistakable sincerity in his voice. And it was like Harmony could see Draco's thoughts through their eye contact, his fears and his adventure from last night. And there was an outline of a small animal.
"Just tell me what you want." Leighton said and saved her momentarily again.
"Alright are you ready?" At the sight of Harmony's nod, Ginny transfigured herself into a hawk. As she felt her human body give way to wings and talons, Ginny let the excitement flood her, as she left her tiny room behind her and broke free into the clear night sky. Her hawk eyes watched the caracal that jumped down, rooftop by rooftop until it landed on the grass and bounded across the ground below her, keeping up with her pace.
"Draco," a girl said to him, who he cared less to realize that it was Pansy behind the cheetah print mask, "we must dance." Draco reluctantly turned his eyes to the girl, and looked down his nose at her. He wanted to tell her to bugger off.
"Today we shall be brewing the antidote for some of the most toxic concoctions known to the wizarding world. Your attention is crucial today because you will be testing your antidote against several of these toxic poisons. And you wouldn't want to spend the masquerade party in the hospital wing, now would you," Snape said indifferently. Behind his back a list of ingredients appeared on the black board. "Turn to page six hundred and sixty six, and begin." Snape extracted from his robes a vial filled with a liquid that looked to be water, but most definitely wasn't, to the students' dismay.
"I'm not sure, Harmony, but Dumbledore has a reason for everything he does." Harmony didn't say anything, but nodded her head. She slipped the ring on her other hand, and they went down the staircase.
Draco stumbled back, as Nagini slithered over, protecting her master. As Voldemort devoured the remainder of the heart, Harmony crept closer. "Reducto!" Draco shouted, blasting the snake across the room, where it hissed angrily at him.
She stuffed the other dresses in her suitcase and laid the silver dress on her bed. She was at a loss of what to do now. Harmony had taken a shower, and had towel dried her hair. She wasn't sure if she should have done anything more with the unruly locks. The dance was in two hours and Harmony had thought that she would have plenty time. She looked at the time and fretted. It had been so easy as a guy! All she had to do was change, and then wa la!
At least she wasn't wearing the locket, like last time. That had been too unbearable for the both of them. Her anger had made her susceptible to his attacks, till she had left humiliated and exposed. She felt marginally in control compared to then, and hid what she could. She didn't know if he was impressed or just glad that they were getting somewhere after the months of her failing at it pathetically.
"Did you just...read my thoughts?" He looked at her in disbelief. "So Legilimency is what you do with Professor Snape." Draco began to laugh, "and yet, Professor Snape hasn't killed himself or you yet. Impressive." Harmony didn't even try to hide what she was doing with Snape.
"Alright? What do you want? Want me to say that I hate his guts!"
"Thank God," she said and went back to sleep.
When Draco made his entrance to the common room he made out the two imposing figures. "Crabbe, Goyle!" he called out, they came to his side at once and smiled.
"Yes, but it's a mouse, if you use that it might make the mouse's heart beat too much till it explodes."
"Yes, Sir." He turned around and marched with a flaming downcast head to Hermione. Leighton shooed the onlookers with his hands and went back to his desk.
"That's right," Ginny nodded, pleased that it was this easy.
Heat seeped through Harmony's clothes, but it did not stop the cold, the desperation, or the shivers that stripped her body hollow. Something was pressing her wrist firmly. "Episkey," echoed in her ears as her brain reluctantly processed a deep low voice. 'What happened?' she tried to form with her leaden lips, but a grown met her ears.
"Fine I'll go."
"Yes, you will join your house shortly for dinner and resume your schedule. I have brought your uniform and supplies and I will perform the spell that will configure your face to appear like the previous Harry." Harry nodded and closed her eyes. She assumed that Dumbledore had used wandless magic and felt her old face. "It will only last for a full four days, then Minerva can assist you with this cream." Dumbledore held out a large container of yellowing ointment cream. "Made it myself," Dumbledore smiled and left the room to give Harry her privacy to change. He must have noticed the way she was accusing him in her mind.
When she awoke it was dark out and the sun set down in a fine cream colored array. True to his word, Dumbledore came through the door within five minutes.
"I know that I have such an enthralling mind, but I hoped that you learned something." They looked at each other, and Draco could almost see her thoughts flit from behind her eyes. They were rather green and inviting and Draco was tempted to drift into her thoughts and learn more about her.
“No,” Harry says. “I just—I never knew. I was lonely back then too, you know? I always thought you had so many friends.”
Then Draco shrugs, picking up his wand and spelling the blanket back over the mirror anyway, possible further wish-fulfillment be damned. The mirror’s a bloody voyeur, and Draco’s going to spend his first night with Harry alone, thank you very much.
“Fuck,” Draco sighs.
Draco looks pained for a moment. He licks his lips. “I do feel very strongly about you,” he admits carefully, briefly shutting his eyes before turning to look at Harry. “It’s terrifying.”
“Fuck, okay,” Potter says, his hands sliding along Draco’s thighs, parting them further, and Draco shivers.
“You’re
Malfoy again ignores him. “No regular events? Charity balls? Grand fundraisers? Come
Harry nods, feeling tingly with anticipation. “And then we stop.”
. Instead he feels the most aimless he’s felt since he joined the Unspeakables in the first place.
Draco swallows. “Oh.”
How much Draco wished, with the Mark fresh on his arm, that Potter could save him along with everyone else.
“Shut it,” Harry mumbles as he sits down too, not wanting to get overheard. Although, privately, he’s thinking exactly the same thing. He’s not sure he has the attention span to spend
“That’s exactly it,” Harry says, staring down at his worktable. “He doesn’t want to be forced into the whole thing. So really, even if I were his mate—well. Nothing would happen.”
“Please,” he whispers, urging Harry’s hips faster, and Harry obliges, jaw going slack as he grows closer. Draco takes himself in hand, matching Harry’s pace as best he can, reveling in the feeling of Harry inside him.
“Harry, mate,” says a voice, and then another. “Harry!”
“Salazar, that’s odd to hear from you,” Draco says, making a face. “I’m not calling you Harry, by the way.”
Draco feels himself come a little undone when Potter finally pulls out and away, as if Potter’s taken hold of a loose thread deep inside him and now is slowly unraveling him, stitch by stitch.
It’s then that Harry looks around and notices that neither paint nor a single brush seems to be present. “Did you, er, forget your supplies?”
Harry thinks on it. “Not since last night, no. Is something wrong?”
