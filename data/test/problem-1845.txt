“Oh, do calm down, Potter,” Draco drawled, rather enjoying the way Potter’s eyes flashed dangerously. “As luck would have it―” Draco couldn’t help a small smirk at the private joke “―I’ve been working on a new healing salve for the past two weeks. It’s supposed to regenerate any deep tissue injuries―”
“Christ.”
Harry looked tired. His face had changed, as though brought into sharp relief: features a little larger, eyes set a little deeper, skin a little rougher. Older. But he was here, next to Draco, achingly familiar and so wonderfully real. Draco couldn’t help but smile as an enormous sense of relief – of contentment – washed over him.

The match restarted, and Malfoy quickly resumed his position lounging around high above the pitch. Ron was right: the comfort break had been anything but, and Harry’s body now felt like one enormous bruise – annoyingly, much worse than before he’d gotten off the broom. So it couldn’t hurt to allow himself a proper break, could it? And if Malfoy was having a rest too – why not have a rest together? Harry was very curious about Malfoy; he’d long since stopped pretending otherwise. And besides, on a more practical note, perhaps he could convince Malfoy to do another numbing charm. Ron had had a go in the break, but his poor attempt had left Harry’s arse feeling a little bit singed.
or keeping any larger amount was regulated and had to be registered with the Ministry. Using it to gain advantage in business also skirted the edge of legality – it was highly frowned-upon, at the very least. His reputation would never survive a second hit, and Draco knew the Ministry would jump at any opportunity to lock up the only ex-Death Eater outside of Azkaban. His original plan – to sell the
Your favourite bit next, as the sun sets and they wander slowly back, stopping for lazy kisses against palm trees, faces shining pink with stubble-rash and sunburn. They barely make it up the stairs this time before they’re pulling each other to the floor, tearing off clothes, always insatiable. The fight for dominance ends with Harry bending young Draco over the sofa and pounding into him. Their cries echo through the apartment and out of the open doors, mingling with the sounds of the city outside. Your own strokes become faster now, more insistent, as you move to stand behind Harry. You ghost your free hand over the lines of his hips, tracing the muscles of his thighs, his arse, admiring the way it flexes with every thrust, drinking in every single detail this one last, glorious time. Harry’s breathing hitches, his movements growing erratic, and your hand works fast and frantic. Young Draco moans, and you follow suit, and soon you’re all three sighing out your release. Your younger self turns back towards Harry, traces a lazy finger down his face, limbs loose, smile utterly content.
, after all, and with Ron to boot. They’d get the chance to humiliate those gloomy buggers in the Unspeakables’ Department and a couple of days off work besides. Compared with the previous year’s Aurors vs Hitwizards Dance-A-Thon, it sounded like a veritable walk in the park. In fact, Harry’s body positively thrummed with excitement, that old competitive streak rising inside him and heating his blood as he arrived at the field, freshly-polished broom in hand.
“Oh, lighten up, Harry, you know what I mean. They’ll get bored soon and move on. May as well have some fun with it in the meantime.” As Potter scowled, Neville turned his attention to Draco, expression thoughtful. “Anyway, Draco, before I forget – did you have any luck with Brenton in the end?”
“Gee, thanks.” Potter said. Draco could detect a hint of a smile behind the words.
Grateful for the excuse, Draco nodded, sombrely. “Oh yes, of course. That’s why I popped in. To see if I could be of any assistance.”
Draco sighed. It had clearly been far too long. All he
“Nah,” said Harry, slowly. “Nah, if you’re up for it, that one’s all yours.”
“Pretty much.”
“That’s the point, though!” She pulled off her gloves, extracted the tiny phone from her pocket and waved it at him. “Why don’t you just get one of these?
“Great. Good. All right then. Good night.”
A creak.
“I’m right here, you know.”
on it?” Harry shot back, setting his magazine down and regarding Draco dispassionately. “Anyway, I’m not sure where you got the idea that you’re the one who’s asking the questions here.”
Loud footsteps stomped across the room. There was an enormous crash, followed by a shout of frustration. “

“So what happened, darling? Was it awful? Only Potter doesn’t seem the type for a quick smash and dash. Not very Gryffindor, you know.”
“Fuck, Draco, that was―” He shook his head in disbelief. “You were – where the fuck did you―?”
“Well, what can I say, Draco? You made bad choices. I didn’t make them for you, and frankly, I was a little bored of hearing about them, over and over. It was all getting a bit pathetic. Some of us had lives to get on with.”
No, he
It took a while, but they eventually managed to compose themselves, Ginny swiping a thumbnail under her eyes to remove any stray mascara while Pansy clung to her arm, breaths still shallow and shaky. They both looked up just in time to see Draco, expression shuttered, turn to Harry.
“Harry?”

“Yeah.” She put her hands on her hips. “My mum was your Professor, and I know

“Nothing. Just… nothing.”
) and then, with a look of almost maniacal glee in his eyes, head straight for the box of jam doughnuts which was sitting on the side of Harry’s desk. Harry had watched, horrified and fascinated, as Malfoy had proceeded to polish off the very last one, licking the jam and sugar off his fingers, letting out a loud “Mmm!” of satisfaction, and tipping an imaginary cap to Harry on his way out of the door. Harry had stared after him for a good five minutes, wondering if some crazed fan had managed to slip something into his tea again.
right there? I can’t get my head round it. You must have known that, if you’d asked, I would have taken you to mine. It all just feels… uncharacteristically reckless, I suppose.”
Draco took a sharp breath in at the mention of Potter’s name. Did she know, somehow, how much he’d been in Draco’s thoughts lately? “Potter’s – what do you mean?”
Mindless endearments spill from Harry’s lips –
“You’re not kidding.”
High on this sudden understanding, on Harry’s nearness, Draco murmured his words fondly against wand-calloused skin. “Are you going to ask me if you can help me upstairs this time?”
He could sense her grin. “Nah, you’re all right. Mostly.”
He feels Draco’s grin. “It’s better than Pansy’s sofa. Hardly Grimmauld Place either.”

was impossible. Draco briefly wondered if he was stuck in a nightmare.
Draco managed to swallow down the many retorts which had sprung readily to the tip of his tongue, merely smiling as though he was greeting an old friend, while politely offering Ron some free samples. It must have worked, because a couple of weeks later – just as Draco had got back from grabbing lunch, where he’d felt the sudden urge to buy an enormous platter of sandwiches – Ron returned to place a huge order, and they spent a pleasant afternoon stuffing food into their faces and talking about George’s proposal that they expand into Hogsmeade.
Pansy pulled back, then, and Hermione followed her out of the memory, sparing one last, hopeless glance at the drowning man, before the living room reformed. Back in reality, Draco was leaning against the wall, his head tilted to one side, murmuring softly.
“Very weird,” Draco agreed. “But it’s going well, so let’s not think too hard about it.” He offered Neville the plate of sandwiches.
the gravity of the situation. Was it finally acting in Draco’s best interests?
Draco forced his eyes open, turning his head slowly towards the door. From his current position, unless he craned his neck around the sink, he could only make out a pair of legs. He didn’t have to move, though. The Auror robes were unmistakable, as were the mismatched socks.

Draco grinned. “Don’t I know it.”
He sighed in frustration. “Lee, not that it’s any of your business, but I said no.” Her face fell, and he held up his hand. “No, listen, Potter and me… it’s a bad idea. Our history is… extensive. I can’t explain it.”
Draco leant forward. “I can’t testify against him.”
Her shouted response was barely audible. Draco coughed, embarrassed. “Er, good morning?”
, no.”

. I just… it’s not that simple. Also,” Harry added, a wry smile on his face, “I get the impression she’s watched a few too many Muggle romantic comedies.”
Crowson slammed his fist down on the table, making Draco jump backwards in his seat.
Harry took a slow deep breath in, but nodded. He leant forwards, began mouthing exploratory kisses over Draco’s breastbone, where the longest scar slashed a pale pink line across his skin, and Draco relaxed once more, pressing his head back into the pillow with a grunt. Harry nosed his way down Draco’s body, nipping playfully at the sensitive skin of his stomach, before finally relenting and taking Draco all the way into his mouth. He immediately set up a relentless, determined pace that had Draco regretting that he’d ever rushed him – he’d been hard for what felt like an age, after all, and after barely a minute of Harry’s single-minded ministrations, lost in the soft wet heat of Harry’s mouth, he could already feel his balls beginning to tighten. Mustering all his strength, he pushed at Harry’s shoulder.
“All right, I’ll give you the wandless thing.”
“Well buck up, Potter,” said Malfoy, patting him lightly on the back. “No backing out now. I just hope your numbing charms are up to par, ‘cause this is gonna be one hell of a game otherwise.”
what you’ve been up to.”
Crowson never finished his sentence. Instead, several loud bangs sounded; Crowson’s wand flying straight out of his hand as he stumbled backwards, out of Draco’s line of sight. Draco could hear more noise now; different voices yelling from all around. The Body Bind ended, and Draco rolled over onto his side, coughing, instinctively protecting his mangled arm.
roaring through his veins, Draco came with a wordless cry, white lines streaking across the shower door. He collapsed against the wall as if rendered boneless, his harsh breaths echoing off the tiles as the delicious aftershocks of his orgasm tingled all over his skin.

That the future of the world as they knew it depended on some speccy prat off hiding in a tent somewhere.” He nudged Harry, fondly. “They didn’t crawl into their beds wondering if tonight was the night the werewolf down the corridor would fancy a midnight snack. They just…

, carpet burns on his knees. Lazy kissing. Then – oh God – the bathroom door closing, mounting dread, those stupid bloody Quidditch boxers,
Draco stumbled out onto the hearth, wiping excess soot from his eyelashes. The room he’d emerged in appeared barely used; heavy curtains covered the windows, empty cabinets stood to either side of the fireplace, and all the furniture was hidden under enormous sheets. The air was stale and there was dust on every surface, a well-trodden path through it leading from the fireplace to the door. Another dust sheet hung loosely on the large wall opposite. Intricately embroidered leaves curled out from under its edges.
“Really though. Are you alright?”
Ten minutes later, they decamped to the living room. Harry sat on a sofa, thumbing through old Quidditch magazines, while Draco stuck to the margins of the room, occasionally fussing with the curtains or realigning the picture frames, trying to come up with a plan. But as the clock hands crawled slowly around, he started to feel the familiar unease rising steadily in his chest. His eyes were dry and sore, so he spelled the lamps lower, ignoring Harry’s murmured noise of protest. The smell of the carbonara seemed to be getting stronger, if anything, and Draco opened one of the windows, sticking his head out, gulping down deep breaths of fresh air.
Draco swallowed. That had to be a good sign, right? “So, when will I see you again?”
“We’ll be seen.”
Draco nodded, grateful for the distraction that making tea afforded him. He had no idea what was going on right now, but he definitely wasn’t up to small talk. He could feel Harry’s eyes on him as he filled up the kettle, and his cheeks grew hot.
Sharper now: “…he wouldn’t want… not in public… best chance…”
Potter looked like he might die from embarrassment, but in his eyes, Draco could see a glimmer of hope, along with a hunger which made Draco’s chest constrict and his heart beat faster with anticipation. In the silence that fell, Draco heard a small squeal from the lab and snorted fondly, casting a quick
“No, I’m gonna…. Just – just―” He gestured wildly to Harry who somehow understood, leaning back to watch as Draco aimed his cock and groaned his release, warm come painting stripes over the golden skin of Harry’s chest.
“Draco. Draco Malfoy? Seriously?” He could see the speaker now – a slight boy, younger than Draco, not long out of Hogwarts, by the look of it. Had Draco seen him before? He couldn’t be certain. But this boy definitely knew
“Is that so?”
, Uncle Vernon had said proudly), and Harry rolled his eyes, standing up and dusting himself off as it raced past. It revved loudly, skidding to a stop just around the corner.
“Not just yet, I don’t think,” said Harry, quirking a playful eyebrow. He pulled a glossy brochure out of his pocket, flicking quickly through it.  “There’s something else I – ah yes, here we go.
Back at the Manor, hundreds of vials ago, Draco had stood and stared at five silver Occamy eggs. He’d told himself back then that to die young would be somehow poignant or romantic, like a doomed lover from one of his mother’s silly romance novels. How naïve he’d been back then; how little he’d had to lose! He’d been such a fool all these years – a child playing with
“You’ll really have to let me return the favour sometime,” said Draco, sliding one bare foot –
“Obviously,” repeated Harry, less than convinced. It wasn’t just that part either: Malfoy’s whole answer had seemed a little… off, somehow. Almost as though he was trotting out a jokey, sanitised version of events to avoid giving an honest answer. But before Harry could probe any further, they were both distracted by the sudden appearance of the Snitch, which was hovering mere feet away from them. Its golden body jiggled about impatiently, as if to remind them they were supposed to be competing, and Malfoy waved his hand in its direction.
being a bastard… but I’m still rubbish.” Neville said, a wry smile crossing his lips.
His eyes are red and watery as he surveys the damage. “What the hell’s going on?” he croaks.
“Ah, you bought me a drink?” Harry looked conflicted, his hands coming up to tug at the ends of his hair where it stuck out from under that ludicrous cap. “I shouldn’t – thanks, though. You have it.”
, which left Draco in a much more chipper mood and feeling pragmatic about the whole encounter. He was better off without her – honestly, with friends like that, who needed enemies?
And therein lay the second problem: how to find him. Draco didn’t know where Harry lived, or where he went outside of work. Maybe Harry had told him, once, but if he had, Draco certainly didn’t remember. When he went out on Diagon these days, he was no longer on guard for danger, checking for the movement of wands or the flash of a curse; instead, his eyes darted from face to face, desperate to catch a glimpse of a familiar scar, or a shock of messy black curls. He never did; it was as though Harry had vanished into thin air.

Draco spent that evening making several visits to the storeroom, the entrance to which he had temporarily hidden by

Out of the corner of his eye, Draco caught a flash of movement. And then another. And then, to his utter horror, the tall shadow which he’d assumed to be his standing lamp started… undulating. The heavy bronze stem was warping, fattening out,

“Ow!”

for the score. A middle-aged witch, with curly white hair – from the charity, Harry assumed – walked slowly to the centre of the pitch. She clearly said something, because the crowd cheered, but her words were carried away by the wind. As she raised her wand high above her head, an ear-splitting boom echoed through the air. Below them, the timer ticked over to
Potter, always true to his word, spoke to Hannah, who arranged for Draco to brew a sample of his salve for the Healers at St Mungo’s. Its effectiveness was indisputable and he was called in for a meeting with the head Healers, where he was quickly offered a job. Draco declined, of course – he couldn’t share a lab, and after all, what would happen to his shop? – but agreed to supply them with the base potion and demonstrate the brewing process to their own potioneers. As expected, they leapt at his offer, and Draco found himself in the enviable position of being able to name his own price. Although

Or, at the end of the day,

All at once, the air around them seemed to vibrate, and Malfoy closed his mouth again, looking down in confusion. As Harry copied him, an enormous
no escape. Through the false window opposite him, London was choking under a thick blanket of fog – it seemed to seep into Draco’s own body too, now, his vision blurring at the edges. He slid down the wall to sit at the bottom, bringing his legs up to his chest, willing himself to stay calm.

“Professor Sprout, really?” Draco affected a high-pitched, no-nonsense tone. “Now students, if you
With fewer layers between them now, Draco could feel Harry shifting his hips to create more friction, his hard cock obviously straining the fabric of his trousers. Instinctively, he tried to bring his thigh between Harry’s open legs, groaning with frustration as his thick robes got in the way. Harry recognised Draco’s difficulty and stopped moving, letting out a huff of annoyance. They both looked down at the same time, their foreheads bumping together. Draco stepped back to tug the heavy robes over his head, startled when Harry moved to stop him.
Granger looked at him sharply. “Hermione, please. Unless, of course, you’d prefer to call me

“Looks that way.”
“Is that the case, Potter?”
for that.”
“Thank you though,” Draco said seriously, after a minute, “for coming with me. I know I wasn’t… easy.”

“Right. I’ve really got to go to bed. My back can’t take another night on a sofa.”

of dismay emanates from the little blinking alarm on the ceiling. There’s a second of almost-silence, disturbed only by the crackling of flames and Harry’s pounding heart, before it begins to emit an ear-splitting wail.
“Did it?” said Draco, recoiling in mock horror. “Don’t worry, I’ll be careful not to do that again.” Neville snorted.
He lifted his head from where it rested against the other man’s damp shoulder, reaching down to tuck himself back in. But before he could return the favour, he felt the familiar tug of

And it did: with a quick, “May I?” Neville headed straight for an enormous cloth-bound History of Potions book, settling himself down on a stool and flicking through the pages. Potter turned to Draco, leaning against a bench and regarding him silently. That odd, discomfiting expression was back on his face, and Draco felt strangely uneasy.
He had to admit that he was nervous, but reasoned it was the perfect opportunity to test a second sample of his

Realisation dawned, and Harry started towards Malfoy. “You utter wanker!”

“The dragon ingredients!” Potter blurted out, making Draco jump. Potter took a shaky breath before continuing. “Charlie. I’ve spoken to Charlie.

was dubious, to say the least, consent-wise. But Potter? Darling of the wizarding world? Poster boy of the Auror force? Draco shuddered to think of it. The repercussions would make two years of house arrest feel like a weekend trip to Hogsmeade – and there would be no coming back from it, this time.
had wanted him to avoid the sit-down meal so that he might slip in unnoticed. As he entered, though, it quickly became apparent that the exact opposite was true. Dinner had clearly only just finished, and everyone except a few keen dancers was still sat at their tables. As he entered the room, heads from all four corners swivelled towards Draco. The string quartet were finishing up their piece, the twirling couples coming to a standstill, and even the loud buzz of excited voices he’d heard from the Atrium seemed to die down as he walked into the room.
“For me,” interrupted Malfoy, voice quiet but steady, “it’s always been you.”

you, somehow. Help you, even. And… and other things. I really don’t want to go into it right now, but I’ll just say that I thought about you more than I probably should have.” Harry shrugged, looking uncomfortable. “When Neville visited you at the Manor, he told me how you were getting on, and then when I saw an opportunity to help you out, I took it. And I enjoyed coming into your shop, seeing you again. Doing so well. I’m not going to lie and say it was completely altruistic. I’m only human, and yes, I wanted something from you, too. I didn’t know quite what that was, but I couldn’t help it.”
while you’re in there. I’ll know if you do,” he finished, expression stern.
He suddenly felt tired.
Harry reached over without thinking, prised Malfoy’s fingers from around his broomstick and took his hand. Malfoy’s breath caught but he didn’t object, so Harry turned it over, palm down, fascinated. Malfoy’s fingers moved of their own accord, a flickering motion which spread from his fingertips across the back of his bony hand. As Harry watched, he could see the tendons working; could feel the quiver running up his own arm. He traced his finger along the ridges and valleys of Malfoy’s knuckles; pressed it into the soft spot between his thumb and index finger, unable to look away.
Everybody whispering, tense and anxious; his mother weeping, quietly, at night. Nothing going according to plan – and the realisation that maybe he wasn’t
Draco tipped his head back to look at Harry, almost losing his rhythm as he found green eyes staring down at him, expression awestruck, pupils blown wide with arousal. Maintaining eye contact, Draco carefully reached around, linking his fingers with Harry’s over the back of his head, their joined hands guiding him forward. He moved his fist so that he could swallow Harry down to the root, pressing Harry’s hand down against Draco’s head in short bursts until Harry understood, letting out a laugh of disbelief which quickly became a moan as he began rutting his hips forward in earnest, his cock driving in and out of Draco’s mouth.
Because as hard as he worked, and as much as the
Harry laces his fingers together, twists them back and forth. Runs his thumb over the spot where his wedding ring used to sit. What’s he supposed to say, exactly?
When he woke, it was early, and with Harry’s parting words ringing in his ears. One obvious disadvantage of remaining sober was the way the awful night’s events replayed themselves all too clearly in his mind. Lonely and despondent, Draco waited as long as he could before throwing his handful of Floo powder into the flames, and crouching, awkwardly, in front of the hearth.
“Look,” said Harry, sharply, “you don’t need me to tell you that what you did was idiotic, and hurtful, not to mention incredibly dangerous. But I

anymore. Even Draco had started dropping the odd hint about finding a job now, as if Harry didn’t have enough on his plate. No, the right career was waiting just around the corner; he’d know when he found it, and it wouldn’t be Quidditch, or the bloody Aurors, or politics, or teaching…
By the time they’d finally finished recapping every single encounter Leonie could remember, it was pitch black outside. Draco was slumped across the sofa, massaging his aching temples, half-dead with exhaustion. Lee had draped her arm loosely around his shoulders as they’d been talking, and her bloodshot eyes shone with concern as she twisted her head to look at Draco.
, Harry, I swear.”
“Go on then,” said Malfoy, interrupting his thoughts and leaning in close – somehow, one or both of them seemed to have inched a little further forwards than before. “What was the worst one?”
“Okay.”
“What is it, hmm?
. He’d tossed and turned half the night worrying, and he was desperate to feel the way he had the day before. It worked a treat – the second the glittering liquid hit the back of his throat, Draco smiled. His bright future as the successful proprietor of an apothecary off Diagon Alley was assured once more.
“Dennis.” Neville’s voice was sharp, cutting across the low mutterings of the crowd.
Ron yelped in alarm as Hermione appeared from nowhere behind them, her expression all business. “There you are! Sorry to interrupt, Harry, but Ron and I have somewhere to be. Right. Now.”
Pansy’s beady eyes flitted over Draco’s face as she considered his words. After a few moments, she sat back, smirking. “

His Friday night trips to Old Compton Street, for example, were no longer confined to Friday nights. He made no effort to hide what he was wearing or where he was going either; strolling through the Leaky Cauldron in tight black jeans and not much else, without a single patron so much as raising an eyebrow. He never bothered with G-A-Y or any of the big bars where he’d have to queue nowadays;

As the cheers faded, Harry opened his fist. The Snitch gave itself a little shake, its tiny wings uncrumpling, before it whizzed off into the air. As he watched it disappear across the pitch, Harry spotted Malfoy – to Harry’s surprise, still in the exact same spot as earlier. He caught Harry’s eye, shooting him a playful smile and a quick thumbs up.
he recalled as clear as day: the way Harry’s fingers had curled around his neck, eyelids fluttering shut as he kissed Draco with such a depth of feeling it made Draco ache. If only he could see Harry somehow, just once, he might remember what exactly his feelings
“Yes. No. I… I wanted your business to be successful. I wanted to see you doing the right thing. I guess I wanted you to do the right thing so much that I put out of my head the idea that you might… not be?” Harry sighed again. “I’m not afraid to say that I’ve never exactly had the best instincts when it comes to you.”

Potter pointed his wand at a beautiful old gramophone – almost an exact replica of Draco’s mother’s own, would you believe? – and the music began to drift, smooth and crystal-clear, through the air: a traditional Pureblood tune. Draco bowed, taking Potter’s arm, leading them gracefully around the room. That had been another wonderful surprise: Potter’s incredible skill at dancing. The man had been holding out at the Yule Ball, that much was for sure.

-d crockery – and they both stared out of the windows into the grey landscape beyond. In any other circumstance, the silence would have felt awkward, loaded, and Draco would have hurried to fill it – but today he could feel only that constant, exciting tingle of possibility. Longbottom was here for a reason. Things were exactly as they should be.
“Oh,” said Draco.

“No. It wasn’t pity. Not exactly. You know,” he went on, slowly, apparently oblivious to the inferno bubbling up inside Draco, “I never knew my mother. But I know what she did for me – that I survived the unsurvivable purely because of how much she loved me. With you – look, I’d always assumed that you were like your father. Blinkered, prejudiced, malicious, whatever. At school, you acted like you were so proud to be serving Voldemort. Like it made you something special…”
“Okay.”
The room was set up similarly to last year: orchestra, and dance floor, and foliage all around. Only instead of beautiful lightly-perfumed cherry trees, this time there was lilac – only lilac, everywhere he looked – hundreds of trees and bushes giving off a sticky-sweet scent so potent that he could taste it. The charming pairs of bullfinches were gone too, replaced with great swarms of butterflies which fluttered about irritatingly close to Draco’s head. Their tiny wings flapping made him itch and the cloying smell turned his stomach as he surveyed his surroundings.
“Honestly, Draco, I’m beginning to think my life was easier when you were just spending your time trying to trip me up or hex me. It’s been one thing after another since we’ve actually been friends.”
“Why d’you keep it up? Your job, I mean? Why not give up all that Deputy Head Auror rubbish that you hate so much? You know, if you’re not concerned about what people think…?”
Dennis ignored him, his voice approaching fever pitch as he drew his wand and waved it towards Draco with a shaky hand. “Colin Creevey, you arsehole. D’you remember him?
Hermione automatically began sifting through the first few memories to drift her way. They were all war-related, unsurprisingly: unprocessed trauma always lingered at the surface. She was good at Legilimency – great, even – in that practiced, determined way she excelled at anything she set her mind to. But after merely a few seconds of predictable scenes – Voldemort’s hollow eyes, Bellatrix’s cackles, a bathroom full of blood – Pansy’s snooty voice sing-songed through her mind.

“Look, I’m not crazy, all right? I can tell he’s still interested, and I don’t understand why he can’t give me another chance. I’ve done what everyone asked. I’ve sorted myself out.”
But Harry couldn’t be blamed for his initial reaction, could he? After all, Draco
Winter meandered into spring so gradually that Draco hardly noticed, until, one morning, he came downstairs to find that Itti, his mother’s single remaining house-elf, had set the breakfast table out on the terrace. There were buds on the wisteria and the peafowl were strutting around the lawns, enjoying the sunshine after a long winter. Draco didn’t blame them. Through the dark nights and miserable overcast days, he’d been unable to shake the dread that had settled over him like a shroud at his father’s funeral. But that day, looking up at the skylarks wheeling and circling in the cornflower sky, with the sun kissing his cheeks, Draco felt the pressure ease, just a little. There was a golden glimmer of hope on the horizon.
Draco’s head snapped around in time to see Harry, his smile echoing Hannah’s own, sweep her up into an enormous hug. “I did! Sorry I’m late – you look gorgeous by the way, Han. Congratulations again. Neville’s a lucky man.”
about you, ok? Are you happy now? You know I’m rubbish at this stuff, but I hate seeing you like…” Her words trailed off. And then, alarmed: “Oh God, you don’t have a guy up there now, do you?”
“How d’you guess?” replied Draco, wryly.
That bothered him. While plenty had happened over the past few years that he was keen to forget, the thought of forgetting the details of the times he knew he’d felt the happiest – Harry’s visits, Quidditch, Lee, seeing his mother – was awful. But try as he might, to his immense frustration, the memories remained inaccessible. Hidden away, behind a locked door, with no way of knowing if they’d ever return.
But Draco could barely hear her excited chatter over the rushing sound in his ears.
“No,” said Draco forcefully, fingers curling in Harry’s hair. “
“Shhhh…”
Harry slanted a brief, curious look towards him, before sinking down on the old stepping stool. Draco stared at him, mind conjuring flickering images of times long past, hazy memories of afternoons spent together layered one over another.
Draco affected a fake smile, stepping aside to allow a house-elf to Vanish the broken glass. Collins had been an irritating little Ministry sycophant years ago, and he was no more than that now. Besides, they were in the Ministry itself, with hundreds of other people milling around. He was hardly likely to draw his wand. The best thing Draco could do was keep calm.
Draco struggled to his feet, holding out a hand so that Harry could haul himself up.

Harry fell straight asleep again, his hand relaxing against Draco’s as his breaths evened out. Draco, too, felt himself beginning to slip under, but clung to consciousness for just one more wonderful moment.
Draco retreated inside, shutting the world back out.

“Well, as they say, why break the habit of a lifetime?”

Or both.” He closed his eyes, swallowing against the bile rising in his throat. “And as much as I’m sure you didn’t expect a repeat of last night, I’m pretty sure you don’t want to be around for that, either. So if we’re going to carry on this little chat, you’re going to have to get me some more

“Seamus!”
“Sadly not. He only collects the dung from wild dragons. I spoke to another trader, but he wouldn’t even tell me his source, so that’s a non-starter. What I really need is a dragon keeper who I can be confident is getting hold of the ingredients legally and humanely.”
Pansy stared up at him, taken aback, before waving her hand dismissively. “Whatever. What’s wrong with you anyway, Draco? Is something hitting a little close to home? Or can’t you take a joke anymore?”
For the next few days, in idle moments, Draco could hardly think of anything other than Potter. Imagination augmented by

She nodded, fervently. “I did, I did.

Why had no one explained it to him before?
with himself, and Draco didn’t even need to pinch himself to understand that this was real.
“Don’t thank me yet.” Harry leant forwards, his muscles visible under the tight shirt. He looked every inch the powerful Auror, and even beneath layers of confusion and fear, Draco swallowed tightly, shifting in his seat as he remembered the heat of that hard body pressed against his. “I’m not messing around, Draco. If I don’t like what I hear, you’ll be taking the Veritaserum, at the Ministry if necessary.”
, dickhead?”
He leant forwards slightly, voice hushed. “Do you mind if we carry on inside?”
Draco rolled over onto his back, slinging an arm over his head and looking over at the doorway where Harry stood, silhouetted. Draco almost snorted. The silly arse had only gone back to get his cup of tea. Draco found that the blinding rage – so quick to rush up inside him these days – had already started to subside. The man did have a point, after all. And what would getting angry at Harry achieve? He’d said it himself – it couldn’t be undone now.

They turned down Horizont Alley, passing Alessandro’s, where most of the lights were off, the last of the waiters busily
Another unexpected benefit of her presence was the way it seemed to reassure more sceptical members of the public of Draco’s amazing transformation from bigoted ex-Death Eater to generous champion of waifs and strays. This was helped along by – of all things – a Rita Skeeter article, which was saccharine to the point of queasiness, focussing heavily on Lee’s

made wandless, wordless magic look as easy as breathing. People always said that he’d managed to cast a bloody Patronus at thirteen years old, just out of sheer, desperate need. Well, if ever Draco had needed anything in his life, it was to get off this damn bed.
“What did he say?”
“For fuck’s sake,” said Lee, with a sigh. “Why is it that we always end up talking about Harry?”

“No! No potions.”
In the end, Draco was focussing so hard on staying calm and unaffected that he missed the Cannons’ only moment of brilliance: the Quaffle flung from fifty yards out to glance off the Keeper’s broom and soar through the centre hoop. He was therefore completely blindsided when Harry jumped to his feet, punching the air, before turning to Draco, a delighted grin lighting up his entire face. The smile was so unexpected, so sincere, that Draco’s heart leapt straight into his mouth, and he found himself grinning back, dopey and loving. Harry cleared his throat, looking away self-consciously.
A long sigh. The voice was slowing down now, getting deeper and more serious. “I honestly don’t know how else to put it. Draco is
“Shut up.”
“Fine!” Draco slammed the window shut with his good arm. The sound reverberated around the flat, and he saw Mrs Gibson glare at him before he turned away.
“That’s – that’s good.”
“Hang on just a minute.”
“Good.”
was telling him to ignore all his very tangible doubts, that he’d be fine.
Draco’s eye was drawn to one photograph in particular. It was one of the smaller pictures, tucked away in the middle of page three, so Skeeter clearly hadn’t thought it notable, but Draco was immediately transfixed. The shot was taken from behind Harry’s date so you could only see the back of his head and his hand as he passed something across the table. As Harry accepted it, their hands brushed, and Harry blushed and smiled, before looking away. The photograph, taken as it was with Harry smiling almost directly at the camera, made Draco’s chest tighten. He watched it over and over, until he couldn’t help smiling himself. It was only when he caught himself about to brush his finger over the photograph that he paused. Why was he being so weird, so

Efficient as ever, Pansy wasted no time putting her plan into action, and within a week, Draco found himself following a handful of stragglers through the Cannons' tired old stadium. A woolly hat covered his too-distinctive hair, and he ducked his head as he passed the stands full of orange merchandise, ticket clutched in his clammy palm. Chasing the roar of the crowd, he climbed up the rickety steps, winding higher and higher and higher still, until the air began to feel thin. Draco was already shaky with nerves, and he had to stop – back pressed against the canvas wall – and take great gulping breaths before he could continue.
what you told me. But I spoke to Pansy and Lee, and – look, I’ve been getting a lot of mixed messages. And when you mentioned the party…”
“Alright, but you can’t ask about this one. Wouldn’t tell you, even if I could.”
She turned to him, hands on hips and chin raised, but her eyes were unmistakably misty. “No. No, Draco. You don’t get to just… to just come down here, and… and…” Her lip trembled slightly, and he frowned. Knowing how she hated to be seen as weak, he stepped back, and she slipped past him to stand behind the counter. She wrapped both arms around her waist, holding herself, vulnerable and unsure for the first time Draco could remember. He took a shaky step towards her. The damaged wood stretched out between them.
) had created a very profitable business which, Draco calculated, would soon need to expand its premises further. His reputation was improving by the day, with his potions working better and for longer than those of his competitors, and suppliers actively seeking him out to sell their ingredients. He could never have dreamed of such success.
“Right. Well, Collins, I hope you’ll understand, I really must catch up with my old friend Draco here.” He took another step towards Draco, forcing Collins to shuffle back, scowling. “It’s been – oh, a while, hasn’t it?” He winked at Draco. “What would you say? About three months?”
“And have you found that… that someone yet?” Malfoy asked, voice quiet.
With profits increasing, Draco quickly gave Lee a pay rise. She was saving for her own flat – somewhere in Muggle London near her relatives, but where she could get a Floo connection installed. She was looking forward to a lie-in, and Draco was looking forward to not having to hear her rants about the ‘stinking bloody Tube’ every single morning.
As it turned out, he wouldn’t need to.
“And on a day like today. You must really be a dedicated Cannons fan,” said Harry, mouth twitching. He still wasn’t looking at Draco.
“They replaced your melted counter.”

“What?”
Draco could only stare, shellshocked, as the Deputy Head Auror – his erstwhile lover – stood at the entrance of his bathroom, tiny Quidditch players still zooming irreverently around his crotch, clearly weighing up the merits of arresting Draco on the spot. Distantly, Draco realised, he should probably

Another wink and he was gone, swallowed up once more by the hungry crowds.
His suppliers also seemed to be experiencing unexpectedly good fortune. Charlie Weasley himself had written to let Draco know that their dragon breeding programme had had its best year to date, and enormous packages begun to arrive from Romania – almost double his previous order size – at no apparent extra cost.
There’s a flash of movement up on the balcony and the agent’s nasal voice drifts down to the street:

“I’m serious. Nothing you’ll regret, Draco. Promise me.”
Harry tumbled forwards, fingertips connecting with the Snitch, at the exact same time as Malfoy’s. The effort made him overbalance, and he took Malfoy with him, the two of them falling, gracelessly, into an enormous pile of old leaves.
“No, it’s – it’s strange, that’s all,” says the agent, wandering too slowly down the remaining stairs, hanging onto the banister rail, still staring at the board in his other hand. “Unless she’s made a mistake again…”

Draco pulled the duvet up over his arms, curling onto his side away from Harry. For the first time he could remember his head felt clear and his heart light. He fell asleep to the soothing sound of steady breathing beside him.
She let out a long breath through pursed lips, and then silence filled the room.
It had been his first (and hitherto only) experience with a man, and the same for Theo. It hadn’t been romantic, and it
As Draco cupped the bulge of Harry’s cock through the cotton of his pants, Harry made a guttural sound and threw his head backwards, exposing the tantalising curve of his throat. Drawn to it, Draco let his tongue dip into the hollow between Harry’s collarbones, trailed it up over his Adam’s apple and all the way to his jaw, the rasp of Harry’s stubble under his lips.
He strolled back to the shop, enjoying the bite of the wind against his neck – both head and heart lighter than before. A smile played about his lips. His father would have hated it.
Harry’s eyes flicked down to Draco’s lips, then back up. Draco’s heart was beating a steady tattoo against his chest. If he leant forwards just a fraction, angled his head to avoid the scarf… but no. Reluctant to risk this new fragile accord, he waited. He felt Harry’s shaky exhale hot against his cheek.
Harry’s laughter, full-bodied and affectionate, echoed down the street, and Draco’s heart soared. Walking beside Harry again, able to speak freely, frankly, about their shared past – Draco thought he’d never felt so content.

The hand moved away. Draco pouted a little – or tried to, at least.
They sat on the top step of the rotunda overlooking the lake. The light was fading fast, the wind carrying the distant strains of excited screams as parents attempted to cajole, bribe or force their offspring away from the enormous adventure playground.
“Ah, I thought you’d never ask, Potter.” Draco said, gesturing towards the front of the store. “We keep the Sleekeazy’s over there, a good dollop of that should sort you out nicely.”
Finally, to Pickle and Missy. May you always be lucky (and may you never read this).
As expected, the Leaky was completely packed. Someone had made a half-hearted attempt to transform its dingy interior by draping a few strings of fairy lights over the rafters; these, unfortunately, only served to highlight stains on the carpet and hex-scars dotted across the walls. In stark contrast to the shabby décor, the mood in the place was buoyant. Loud, catchy music was playing, trays of champagne glasses were hovering about the room, and excited voices sounded from all around – in particular from the far corner, where George and Ron were holding court, demonstrating their latest Wheezes bestsellers to a mesmerised crowd.
All out of better ideas, he set aside his reservations, opened his mouth and gratefully let

He pulled on his shirt, shaking fingers struggling with the buttons, and looked up. Harry was spread out across the bed, wrapped snugly in the grey woollen blanket, half-smiling in his sleep. Draco’s chest tightened. No, he couldn’t leave. If Harry woke and Draco was gone – had snuck out as though this had been some cheap one-night-stand – it made Draco’s heart hurt a little, even just to consider it. No, there was nothing for it – he had to say something. To let Harry see him as he really was.
“But then the bosses came up with this exchange idea, and they were dead set on it, couldn’t talk them out of it. So I got back here, expecting Howlers and protests and Crup shit on my desk. And then I found out they’ve put me in the next office to the great Harry Potter, for fuck’s sake! So there went my last chance to convince people I’ve changed. How could I expect them –
“Good.” Harry rolled over towards him, the mattress shifting under Draco as he moved closer, meeting his gaze. Harry’s face was tense, his expression full of regret, but his eyes burned fierce into Draco’s. “No more

“I hope it’s okay, Draco,” Neville cut in. “I met Harry for lunch, and when I mentioned I might pop by, he asked if he could come along. You don’t mind, do you?”
Or, as he helped Lee and Draco extract Flobberworm Mucus:

The fire had been a turning point between them; a focal point for heated discussions from then on, but the kitchen had, of course, seen better times too. At first, Draco – house-elf free for the first time in his life – had developed an addiction of sorts to Muggle cooking shows. He’d loved surprising Harry with his favourite meals, even while he grumbled affectionately about Harry’s simple tastes. Harry glances over at the hob, picturing Draco standing there, wooden spoon in hand, licking sauce off his fingers, turning around with a smile as Harry saunters in…

My hero!”
“Hmm.” Draco tapped his chin, feigning deep thought. “I think it’s missing something.”
Malfoy swallowed, before waving his arm airily. “Don’t… don’t mention it. Anyway, uh, where was I?”
Neville looked supremely unconvinced; Draco wasn’t surprised, he could hear how it must sound.
"Look, I know you’re in there, Potter, so you may as well open up. I literally
Potter looked thoughtful for a minute. “Well… I… I don’t actually know.”
“But―”
Neville launched into an account of his most recent brewing disasters. The rest of the afternoon passed swiftly as Draco took him through some basics, Neville writing down pointers on a hastily Summoned piece of parchment while Itti flitted around them, refreshing the teapot and Vanishing plates.
You let out a long groan as the air shimmers once more, and the library reforms around you. Your prick dangles limp from your trousers as your body finds itself in the present, your mind still lost on a long weekend some twenty years ago. Three nights you’d slept together: sheets discarded, skin damp, legs tangled. Three days you’d consumed each other like men starving, whispered words you never had before or since. But you must have known, somehow, as you had the Pensieve vial in your hand and your wand at your temple the moment your feet touched the Manor floor. You must have known, although when those beautiful green eyes met yours, shining with remorse, your chest had throbbed as though he’d torn you to shreds again.
had clearly given up on him. They faced each other awkwardly; thick, cloying silence surrounding them once more, until Potter took a step back, blinking.
, I believe you. Now, let’s get you some water and off to bed.”
“And my mother? Does she know?” He could hardly listen to the answer.
The night air tasted sour, sitting heavy in his lungs, as Draco worked on a plan. If he was at home, he’d make himself a cup of camomile tea and pace around the living room, waiting for the jitters to settle. He was getting agitated now, after all, foot tapping against the floor, muscles coiled tight. He had to move – to do
“I had no idea,” Draco said, slowly. “The way you’re speaking though… did he really like me that much?”
Harry takes his time preparing Draco, holds his gaze as he slips first one finger, then a second, inside, watching him keen and squirm as though for the very first time. And Harry supposes it is, in a way; he can’t recall ever feeling this way before: surrounded by Draco; completely focussed, utterly entranced by the sighs and moans he makes, the way he bites his lip, the arch of his back as Harry moves inside him. All of it’s familiar, and yet all of it’s new. Harry watches him, thinking of their first time, their second time, all the times that came before.
“Pretty much. I think so.”
“No, I

“You’ll think me a fool, Draco,” she continued, “but I’d never really spoken to a Muggleborn. Our mother used to tell us all kinds of things: that they didn’t wash, that cooking Muggle food without house-elves made their skin smell. The Dark Lord always said that their bodies were weaker than ours, their brains smaller. I was ignorant, and afraid, and I’m ashamed that I never thought to question it. Worse still, of course, we passed our fears onto you. We raised you with so much hate in your heart, Draco. We let that man – that

“Okay, okay. Just water, then?” A mumbled incantation, and he pressed a cold glass into Draco’s hand. Draco gratefully took a sip.
It took Draco hours to wind down that evening, not helped by either the high dose of

Tearful with relief, Harry kisses him quiet.
“Great. If you could let him know that the gnomes actually much prefer Mrs Farley’s garden, and would really rather he didn’t keep Stunning them and dumping them here, that would be fantastic.”
Barely a few minutes later, another burst of music and laughter spilled out from the ballroom, lasting a few seconds before fading slowly to a background murmur. Footsteps sounded on the polished floor, moving ever closer.
. I hope you had a good laugh.” He rose abruptly, chair wobbling precariously, and turned his back on Harry, all at once desperate for some fresh air.
“Really?”
Harry looked back up at Malfoy. What could he say? He could ask how Malfoy had slept, of course, or maybe point out Ron – that should raise a laugh, for sure. Or perhaps he could try for romantic, make some trite comment about the sunrise?
Draco stepped forward. “Longbottom.” Politeness dictated that he should offer his hand, but he felt suddenly certain that Longbottom would decline, so, in lieu of this, he nodded and waved him forward. “You’re most welcome. Please, come through.” He gestured to the door to the drawing room. Longbottom nodded back at him and walked through. Draco noted with some interest the way Longbottom’s arse moved in his tight grey trousers, before thinking to himself with a half-smile that he must have been on house arrest far too long if he was resorting to checking out Neville Longbottom’s bum.
Harry was easy to find, over by the head table, handsome and impressive once again in those damn formal robes. He was frowning, hands clasped smartly behind his back, apparently deep in serious conversation with a group of Ministry officials. Elsewhere, Draco spied Neville and Hannah whirling clumsily but enthusiastically around the dance floor, and a familiar bushy brown head of hair amongst a crowd laughing over by the bar.
Harry spluttered loudly, and the umbrella-waving lady turned, glowering at him. “Excuse me?” He waved an apologetic hand up at her as he bent forwards, hugging his ribs, wheezing with incredulous laughter.
“Seriously,” said Draco, gently, “we can get out now. I can do this out in the bedroom, you know. It’s okay that you don’t want to be in here.”
“Draco, you don’t―” He made a weak effort to pull Draco back up, but quickly relented as Draco made short work of his flies and tugged both trousers and pants down to his knees impatiently.
Much to his chagrin, though, Draco didn’t bump into Potter all evening. A couple of times, Draco felt sure Potter had been making his way purposely towards him through the crowds, only for one of them to be steered away at the last minute. But, somehow, every time Draco finished a conversation and glanced up, his eyes were immediately drawn to Potter’s location. And Potter’s intense gaze was always on Draco too – burning through him, making his heart pound and his throat dry up. No matter what Draco did in response – smile, raise his glass, quirk an eyebrow – Potter just continued to watch Draco until his attention was required elsewhere.
“I’m Lee. Leonie Burbage.”
Nervously, Draco nodded his head at her –
“Yep.”

use to weekdays only. It was under control; a help, not a habit. He could do this on his own – and if he couldn’t, well, he’d just leave. No harm done. He grabbed his broom from against the wall and clutched it tightly to his chest, feeling ridiculously comforted, as though the slim stick of mahogany might provide protection from anything the world could throw at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco nodded, a quick jerky movement, barely disturbing the air around them. There was something about the darkness, the silence, even the bedroom – the setting for so much that had passed between them recently – that felt almost holy. The last thing Draco wanted was for his clumsy, half-formed sentences to risk disrupting the moment. Harry didn’t seem to expect a response anyway, and after a short pause his low voice continued, drifting softly over to Draco’s side of the bed.
“Although now that you mention it, darling, there is something I’ve been meaning to tell you.”
“I’ll just be a sec, okay? Promise.”

going to end in disaster!
Harry, meanwhile, was groaning in ecstasy with every careful movement of Malfoy’s wand, as Malfoy’s clever magic fizzed over him, leaving the muscles beneath tingling and so, so relaxed. The tension from a full day’s flying seemed to bleed away as Malfoy traced patterns across Harry’s chest, drawing the wood in precise lines down his stomach and then pressing deeply into the tight mass of his quads, leaving Harry boneless and writhing uncontrollably under his touch.
“Oh?”
. Maybe it would prevent him ending up with bats flying out of his nostrils again, he thought grimly, as he tipped the little vial into his mouth.
To Potter’s credit, he recovered easily from Draco’s insult. “Merlin, you do get prickly when people are nice to you, don’t you?” He smiled that beatific smile again, effortlessly doing away with all Draco’s attempts to stay annoyed. “You don’t have to believe me, but I promise I came because I was worried about you.”
could soothe his aching bones, fill the hollow in his stomach, or settle his trembling hands.
Lucius’ death had heralded another change too, of course: for Draco’s benefit, her soft, elegant socialite hands had been put to use for the very first time – and not just sowing and harvesting either, but grappling with carnivorous plants and heaving Mandrakes from the earth. The fresh air and exertion had suited his mother, leaving her body toned and her skin glowing – healthy, proud, and even lovelier than before. Over the past few years Draco was sure he recalled admiring her photographs on the society pages of the
To Draco’s surprise, Potter frowned. “I think that I’m not in the mood for messing around, Draco. If this is another game―” He began to withdraw his arm.
Then of course there was the
After lunch, Neville was keen to see Draco’s mother to update her on the Moly plants they’d grown from her cuttings. They spent a pleasant, if tiring, afternoon together attempting to harvest leaping toadstools, Draco very grateful for the extra pair of hands. As they were walking back inside the house, Megaera came swooping down and dropped a letter at Neville’s feet. He read it and wordlessly passed it to Draco.
Only Malfoy still looked quite calm – and annoyingly comfortable – mounting his broom with barely a wince. Everything hurt. Harry’s shoulders throbbed, his neck ached, his arms trembled. His buttocks… well, he dreaded to think. They were probably black and blue at this point. It was torture, plain and simple – not merely the lack of sleep, but also the need to constantly shift left or right to stay upright, despite Harry’s best attempts at stabilising charms. He cursed Kingsley, and Robards, and most of all himself for lacking the sense to ask a few basic questions before agreeing blindly to this ridiculous plan.
. But Harry didn’t follow him into the shop itself, only tilted his hip to lean against the doorpost, head cocked to the side. Draco shivered, recalling another evening, long ago: fresh summer rain in the air, a dull throbbing running through his arm, Harry’s lips brushing against his earlobe, his words raw and hungry:
Written for
They stayed like that for a few minutes, until the weight of Harry’s hands on his shoulders and the soothing cadence of his voice began to calm Draco. His blurred vision cleared.
It felt like an opening, like friendship; maybe the start of something new. All at once, the crowd seemed to surround him, their chants lifting him up and out of his seat. For the first time, he cheered each goal along with them, Harry’s looks of pleased surprise bringing a flush to his cheeks, the frequent press of Harry’s arm against Draco’s own like a rope to a drowning man.
. Surely there had to be
dripping slowly down the wall. A concerned look:
“…need your birth registered, of course,” said Bryn. “So I haven’t been able to keep a job for long. But, uh, hopefully that’ll all change now, after today.”
Potter laughed. “Fine, Draco. I’ll be your giddy pig. Merlin, imagine if my sixteen-year-old self could see me now.” He lifted himself up, unbuttoned his flies and slid the top of his jeans down on the left, leaning against the arm of the chair so that his thigh was raised off the seat. The wound
help him to remember those events clearly – to understand why he’d made the choices he had, to allow him to move towards letting go of his guilt and accepting the past as the past. But the whole process was anxiety provoking and excruciatingly humiliating, and so, in daily life, Draco had been more than content not to dwell on details he couldn’t recall. He remembered enough, with occasional prompting from Lee, to manage the day-to-day workings of the shop, and hitherto that was all that really mattered.
“I’ll suck you,” Draco mumbled against Harry’s lips, already reaching between them. He was eager, so very eager, not only to feel the weight of Harry on his tongue once more, but also to prove himself, that Harry might forget Draco’s earlier embarrassing confession. But before he had the chance, Harry’s hand flew down to meet his, encircling Draco’s wrist.
“No,” said Draco, firmly. “That’s not what I mean. It was never meant to be like this. When I started, it was going to be a temporary thing. Everyone hated me back then. They hated me so much, and I just needed a break.” She raised her head, looking at him incredulously. “Look, there are no excuses. I was always planning to come off it, but I couldn’t. I tried, I really did, but it all just got out of control. I know, I’m an arsehole – you’re not wrong about that. But I wasn’t

directly. He’d made such an effort to be quiet and considerate since he moved in, not wanting to give anyone the chance to complain about the Death Eater next door, and now it was all about to be ruined by Potter’s idiotic shouting.
“Worked, didn’t it?” said Harry, smiling as he unhooked his trousers from his ankles, before letting Draco haul him to his feet. He pulled up his boxers almost coyly – Draco noted with amusement that they were a novelty pair, with two tiny Quidditch players chasing a Golden Snitch around the outline of his softening cock – and waved his hand, cleaning the mess from both their chests.
There was silence for a minute. The trembling had gentled now to just the occasional quiver, like the leaves of a Flutterby bush. The hand was back, stroking tenderly over Draco’s brow once more, and Draco’s mind began to wander, the voices fading into the distance, as he heeded the sweet siren call of sleep.

Draco stopped, leaning against a tree, so Harry did too. They watched for a while as groups of teenagers piled out of the vehicles, lighting up cigarettes, climbing onto roofs and bonnets. The headlights painted intersecting stripes of light up onto the hillside. Some of the men, all dressed in grey or black tracksuits, started checking out the cars, while others busily passed around six-packs of cider. A group of girls wearing identical-looking fringed leather jackets and miniskirts were huddled around the back of a van, shivering in the fresh September air as they decanted spirits into half-empty coke bottles. Harry watched, vaguely appalled, as old cans and fast-food wrappers were ejected from windows, left to lay on the ground or blow away in the wind.
He’d enjoy Owling Neville about that one. Draco scanned it over breakfast and was delighted to note several mentions of his apothecary, with only a single reference to ‘ex-Death Eater Draco Malfoy’.
“And you’ll be doing the same back at your place, if you’ve got any sense.”
Draco merely snorted loudly and continued walking. “Put it away, Potter. Honestly, anyone would think you hadn’t been raised by Muggles.”
Draco turns his head, eyes half-closed, captures Harry’s mouth with his own. Harry tastes the salt tang of tears on Draco’s lips as he returns the kiss. It’s deep, aching; Harry still trying to pour every last inch of himself into the heated touch of their tongues. Draco, too, is all over him; hands tangled in Harry’s hair, face buried in his neck, hips tightly pressed together.
But with a few simple adjustments here and there – Draco stopped asking her to clean the lab, and he started unpacking the Occamy egg deliveries himself – they were back on track. Lee made his whole life
“Draco?” The voice was painfully familiar, and Draco felt a sudden chill. Humiliation twisted sickeningly in his midsection. Harry’s expression was achingly tender, his eyes soft with no hint of the anger from before, his mouth pressed together with worry, not curled in spite. Harry squatted down, laying a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
But at the third, even louder “

, but there was no venom behind it; it was more like slipping on an old, comfortable pair of shoes. Potter seemed to feel the same, his face opening up into a wide smile where he stood, his warm palm still pressed against Draco’s.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Do you think I’m a complete idiot?” He sighed. “Look, I need to talk to you properly, but I can’t trust a word you’re saying while you’re on that shit. How long will it take to wear off?”
“Look at you, cowering against the wall. Not so big and clever now you haven’t got your lackeys with you, are you, Malfoy?”

“You know, Mother, I wonder if I might be able to find a solution. You recall Leonie, my business partner?”

“Hang on a second, don’t answer that.”
Harry frowned. “Cleaning spell. Protection. Lube. You have – ah! – you’ve done this before, right?” He inhaled sharply, arm twisted behind his back. “I don’t mind, only you said…”
Suddenly, Draco was right back there, in his lab. Beside him, Leonie was measuring out the potion into jars for him to cool, while Harry, fists clenched by his sides, paced back and forth in front of them. Waves of distress rolled off him as he spoke.
Neville looked up. “What?”

him. Potter had offered to help Draco up to his flat.
Despite the chill in the air, the narrow street was filled with people milling about – fit young men in tight v-neck tops with perfectly coiffed hair mingling comfortably with scruffy bearded guys in jeans and trainers. There were topless boys covered in glitter, drunken couples pressed up against shop fronts – leather and latex, lipstick and heels, singing and dancing, fighting and fucking – and layered over it all, a loud, disorienting mix of bouncy upbeat music and frantic pounding beats. Draco had heard the older students at Hogwarts talking about clubbing, had vague images in his head of packed dance floors and strobe lighting, but this – this cacophony, this vibrant, roaring,
“Malfoy, I know you’re up there! Come out and talk to me!”
Draco surveyed his handiwork. The silence was deafening.
“You know it was. Done it a lot before, have you? Is that a signature Harry Potter move you treated me to?” He rocked back on his heels, rising to his feet.
Harry inhaled deeply, lacing his fingers together on his lap as he spoke. “All right then. So, you must have heard that I can resist

“Seriously, Harry, what the fuck?”
been Draco who’d wanted to keep things secret, hadn’t it? Yes, he thinks, it definitely had. Back when the press had been camped out by the school gates, sneaking in hidden devices to spy on Harry, and Draco had still been dodging Tripping Jinxes and worrying about what his mum would think. Sure, the world had moved on a bit since then, but it still made sense to keep things between them, didn’t it?
not here to hex you, right?” Potter asked from the corner, where he was digging his finger into a dish of crushed dung beetles.
Harry held up a hand. “Uh-uh. Later. Go, have your bath.”
He sighs, opens his mouth. His first attempt at reply is masked by a roll of thunder, which rumbles on and on, echoing around the grounds. As it fades, the storm dies down for a second. It waits, like you, for his answer. You're not surprised when you notice your hand resting just alongside his on the balustrade. Barely an inch to the right, and you’d be touching. You hold your breath.
“We won’t. It doesn’t matter, anyway.” Harry’s face is resolute. He reaches for young Draco’s hand, clasps it tightly, and your younger self looks down with eyes so full of wonder that you’re forced to stop for a second, pained.
“Do you still want him?”

And so, spending time with Neville became part of Draco’s weekly routine. Whenever Draco took the
With a grunt of effort, Pansy shoved the familiar images aside. New scenes sprang up in their place – a fall from a toy broom, Lucius’ jeers, a tripping jinx in the Ministry canteen – and were also summarily discarded. The pictures moved faster now, popping up and flipping away like the Rolodex Hermione used to play with at her parents’ surgery. As each new memory swam into view, she found her surroundings growing darker and darker, a sickly seafoam green settling like a filter over everything she saw. Her ears felt full, the sounds dampened, and a strange odour invaded her nostrils, familiar but hard to place: mud, decomposing plants, salt. And then all at once the blur of memories disappeared, and their surroundings stabilised. They were standing in a place Hermione had never been, but knew instantly nonetheless – the Slytherin common room.

safe around here?!”
Malfoy looked incredulous, but Harry merely tightened his grip, tugging him up to standing. Malfoy swung his leg over the broomstick, Harry following suit behind him, leaning over to grasp the handle over Malfoy’s still-shaking hands. He tucked his chin over Malfoy’s shoulder, guiding the two of them slowly up and into the still evening sky.
, you know?” He looked at his hands. “Anyway, apparently, I have the same resistance to other persuasive spells and potions too. I found it out the first week I started Auror training. This nutty witch slipped some Amortentia into a bottle of whisky I was sharing with Gawain and Kingsley. The two of them went loopy, but I just felt a little fuzzy around the edges.”
It was nothing like the first time, with that desperate, aching need for skin against skin after months of dancing around each other – nothing like the stairwell, or Harry’s frantic, jerking hand as he’d prepared himself, tension and anticipation and nerves dissolving into relief as they were finally joined, as they learned to move together. And it was nothing like the second time either – Draco edgy and exhausted and high on whispered confessions as he bent Harry over the sofa, confidence mounting, mesmerised by the way the muscles in Harry’s back rippled as he braced himself with every thrust. No, this third time was different. Draco could feel it in the way Harry settled over him, fingers stroking through his hair, tongue moving slow and sure against his own. He could see it in Harry’s expression, burning with desire yet still so hopelessly sincere; hard to look at directly, as though he was staring into the sun.
“Really?”
Deep down, he knew that taking more

“Thank you,” he got out, winded, pulling back slightly and turning his head to watch the Bludger whirl off into the trees.
Malfoy turned carefully towards the Snitch, which was, by now, hopping up and down, its tiny wings fluttering expectantly. “Go on then, I’ll have a turn,” he said with a grin, and with an alarming burst of speed shot off in the opposite direction. Harry leant forward to ease his still-throbbing bum off the seat while Malfoy chased the little ball about the pitch. Malfoy had been right, it

The bench rocked suddenly as a couple landed next to them, snogging as though their lives depended on it. The man’s hands were running up and down the girl’s legs as they spread themselves out across the seat. Draco shifted instinctively to avoid them, pressing Harry’s body uncomfortably into the arm of the bench. Harry swallowed. A greasy old newspaper cone rolled past their feet, bits of battered fish still stuck to the inside.
“I know.” Draco looks at him sharply, then, but Harry steels himself, presses ahead. “It took me a long time to get over you, Draco.”
By the time Neville emerged from the Floo on his final visit to the Manor, Draco’s preparations for the end of his house arrest were well underway. He’d written out a full inventory, had received surprisingly positive responses from several suppliers and even found a small shop, which had a very reasonable rent, and put a deposit down. It looked perfect on paper; not

“Oh, like you wouldn’t believe.” It was true, although Draco had hardly noticed the change himself. He couldn’t pinpoint exactly when Lee’s lanky form had begun to soften and fill out; nor how her face had suddenly morphed from too-sharp adolescent awkwardness into striking young woman. All he knew was that one day she’d been stomping around the lab in Doc Martens, and the next he’d found her leaning over the counter giggling with the new boy from Flourish and Blotts, cheeks suspiciously rosy and skirt eye-wateringly short. It had only gotten worse from there, with Draco now regularly forced to eject potential suitors just so they could get some work done.
Harry made a noncommittal sound.
he’s eating well. The other day I came back from work and he was sitting in the corner under the ficus, gobbling up soil straight out of the pot. Had a corner of the curtain tucked in like a napkin and everything. Just sat there cross-legged, shovelling dirt into his mouth, grinning away and smacking his lips as though he were halfway through the lobster at Le Cinq.”
Harry grinned, pulling Draco forward to plant smacking kisses on his mouth. “Seems like it.”
He let his eyes stray to Harry’s face. Harry’s head was tipped back, still against the pillar, and his eyelids were half-closed. His lips were parted – wet, obscene – and here, too, Draco could see his breath coming fast, unsteady. Dizzy with the force of his want, Draco brought his other hand up next to Harry’s head, bracing himself on the pillar. Harry’s eyes – so green, like fresh spring leaves and new beginnings, like shouted curses and the Firewhisky bottle under Draco’s bed – widened slightly at the movement, mouth curving up into a lazy smile, and Draco was lost.
Draco began seeing the Mind Healer Hannah had found – using the very last of his savings to do so – and little by little, his anxiety and low mood began to recede. The world around him – which, since coming off
And right now, there was only one thing he wanted. And it was mere seconds away from stepping out of his Floo.
No sooner had he left, Draco still staring like a fool in his wake, than the lab door opened, and Lee’s excited voice cut into his thoughts.

But it did, and it gnawed at him, and even taking his old Nimbus out for a spin at the Manor on a Sunday did nothing to sate his desire. Before he knew it, he was spending the long nights fantasising about getting on a broom and just taking off, speeding in any direction until he could see the sun peeping up over the horizon.

Draco hadn’t seen Ollivander himself since Draco’s father’s trial. The old wandmaker had shaken like a leaf throughout, hunched forwards as he described – voice faint, and scratchy – his months spent in captivity, and the torture inflicted upon him by Draco’s father under the approving watch of Voldemort himself. Although Ollivander hadn’t spoken at Draco’s own trial, Draco couldn’t forget the times he’d taken food down to the cellar, the way he’d cringed away from the awful, desperate voices begging him for help, running back up the stairs like the coward he was. Draco had so dreaded having to look the old man in the eyes again one day that every time he passed the shop on the way to Gringotts, he kept his head down and hurried past. And now

He indicated the chair, not five yards in front of them: when he looked at it, he could still feel the icy bite of the chains digging into the welts on his arms; could hear the vicious whispering from the highest benches; could see the flash of the cameras, leaving him half-blind and vulnerable, blinking away tears.

Although he made occasional flirty comments to Draco, he never went so far as to ask him out again outright, but now that Draco knew Potter wanted him too, the constant pull of desire was impossible to ignore. It was magnified a hundred-fold by
“Great. That was… great. Hey, and you know… thank

All night long, he lay there, feverish, his mind drifting through memories and nightmares, indistinguishable at times, all filled with terror. Now he was in the place of Leonie’s mother, suspended above the dining table by Voldemort’s wand, Nagini slithering menacingly below. Now he was back up on the Astronomy tower, watching the lifeless body of his headmaster fly backwards up into the air before falling, as if in slow motion, out of view, as Greyback’s elated howls rang out into the night. Now, now he was trapped in the Manor, covering his ears as an endless stream of Howlers screamed accusations at him, piling higher and higher until he was drowning, suffocating underneath a sea of red.
Longbottom looked at Draco thoughtfully. “You should call me Neville, then.”

was waging a war on his body. His legs wanted to carry him to the bathroom. His fingers itched to hold a vial. He got as close as opening the drawer they were kept in before pulling his hands away and forcing himself to return to the bedroom.
“Mmm?” Harry’s eyes were half-closed now, his voice heavy with sleep.

to resist that smile.
Finally spent, Harry loosened his grip on Draco’s shirt, staggering to the side and slumping down across the stairs. Draco stared at him for a second – he was lying awkwardly, uncomfortably, along the wooden staircase; his legs splayed apart, shamelessly displaying the damp patch on his underwear – and let out an incredulous laugh. It echoed in the still air of the hallway, and Harry lifted his head up slowly, eyes heavy-lidded.
“But―”
caught his eye was the glint of an overhead Impervius charm.
Somewhere nearby, a door banged open. Heavy footsteps approached and Draco groaned, pressing his face against his knees, wishing he’d had the foresight to think of casting a Disillusionment.
he? Was he at St Mungo’s? The bed was too soft for a Ministry holding cell, that was for sure.
“Good. Now I hope you’re all well-rested, and ready for a nice, clean game of Quidditch.” He looked at his watch. “Please mount your brooms.”
He needed time to clear his head, to stop him from doing something stupid. His fingers had begun itching to Owl Potter the minute the man had left.
To anyone with even a passing knowledge of potions, Occamy eggs meant one thing and one thing only. Draco had no idea which of his legion of ancestors had stored them up there and when – and it could have been any of them; it seemed a very Malfoy thing to do, after all – but he knew for certain
” through gritted teeth, before turning back to her paramour with a charming grin. Draco headed back to the door, sparing a quick wave for Seamus and Dean who had finally ensconced themselves at the Harpies’ table, and were both staring dreamily at Gina.
He thought of Neville and Hannah, of Dean Thomas, of Ron, and all his old Slytherin friends. What would each of them say, when they found out about him? Would they be surprised? Would they miss his company? Or would they just shake their heads, saying
Harry blinked. Surely not.
He found them on a Monday. Not that
adding something to the food, but mostly he chalked it up to his newfound happiness. After all, since Potter had entered his life – and his bed – every single day was just a little brighter.
It takes a few moments for the agent’s words to penetrate the thick fog of misery and self-pity swirling around Harry’s tired brain. By the time the pieces slot into place, and realisation hits – the blond on the street, the pseudonym they’d both used – they’re at the door, and the agent is tugging it open, and Harry’s heart is slammed brutally against his chest wall as a familiar face slides into view.
under a Disillusionment, only to turn away from it at the last minute, and find herself dusting the stools, or wiping the skirting boards. A few seconds later, she’d glance over at the side bench again, confused, and repeat.
“I… can we… can we go somewhere now? Get a drink or something?”
So what now, then?
Confirmation of his O grade had arrived back in the summer, affording him a few rare days of excitement and optimism. He’d received Owls from his friends – the last he’d heard from any of them, in fact – with news of their marks and confirmation of their plans for the future. Draco was, of course, well aware that with a year left of his house arrest, he wouldn’t be starting the potions apprenticeship he’d always dreamed of. But something about their success buoyed him enough to send off a few speculative Owls to well-respected potioneers around the country, mentioning his grades, the extra-credit work he’d undertaken and that he would be looking for a position from July 2000.
“Sadly not,” replied Draco, surprised by the change of topic. “I was only thinking today that it was perfect flying weather, too. I practice a bit, here and there, when I get the time… just to stay in shape, though. Hardly had a chance to fly lately… and who would I play with, anyway?”
And then, one day in mid-May, Draco received an unexpected message from Neville saying he had some news to share.
“Well, no, not really, I don’t. But I still shouldn’t have been such a snob about it. I know it was none of my business. And I’m sorry for ragging on you about Potter, too.”
Draco looked away before his treacherous face could do something stupid. “Fine. I’m fine. Thanks.”
“Nerve damage, Potter,” said Malfoy, in a voice that aimed for haughty but actually landed somewhere closer to mortified. The bristles rustled gently as he spoke, and as Harry looked closely, he noticed the faint but constant tremor in Malfoy’s slim wrists.
He sighs. “Of course not."
“Hang on,” Draco said urgently, picking up the vial. “Take the rest.” He handed it to Potter, and their fingers brushed, briefly. Draco felt suddenly unsteady as
Draco was unsure if Harry was talking to himself or if a response was expected. He hoped it was the former, as he had no conceivable idea what he might say.
Draco felt his fist grow wet, coated with Harry’s release. He kept it curled loosely around Harry’s cock as Harry continued to thrust weakly forward, riding out the last of his climax, a long, low gasp ripped from his throat.
Thanks to Em (

“Out of interest, what did you
“Merlin, no. I wasn’t planning on it, anyway. But this letter―” Draco tapped his pocket “―It wasn’t really a question. ‘I assume you’ll be there’, it said. He wants me to go.”
“Don’t worry, I’m the pretty one anyway,” she muttered, patting his back consolingly as they cleaned up the mess.
I lost you?”
“Cheers Gin,” Harry said, quickly. “Listen, have you seen Alex about? I was thinking about introducing him to –” He froze, drink halfway to his mouth, eyes narrowing in confusion as he stared over at the bar. A sudden bubble of hysteria welled up inside Pansy, and it took every ounce of self-restraint she possessed to force it back down. Against her side, Ginny was starting to tremble.

“The lab’s a complete tip, but judging by the ingredients I’d say we’re looking at Euphoria, Daydream Solution, a modified Amortentia, and something else. Strengthening Solution, perhaps.”
“You know, darling, I almost wrote to you all those months ago when that article about Potter was in the papers. I laughed so hard – I would have written, I swear it, but I was never sure if your post at the Manor was being read. I didn’t much fancy the thought of some stuffy old Ministry official finding out how badly you mooned after Potter at school.”
If truth be told, it wasn’t as though Draco had never considered trying to recover the rest of his memories before. He’d been working on it, loosely, with his Mind Healer for a while now – learning to integrate his skewed recollections with reality – and he was remembering more and more each day. It usually occurred at random, with recollections triggered by familiar events – a regular customer popping in, perhaps, or Leonie mentioning something offhand. Draco had only made conscious attempts to retrieve specific memories a handful of times, at the recommendation of his Mind Healer. In order to bring forth scenes, she’d encouraged him to focus hard on minute, seemingly irrelevant details: what had the weather been like that day? What potion was Draco brewing at the time? What was he wearing? It was tiring, and tiresome, and when it worked well, Draco inevitably ended up upset and ashamed by the end of the session.
“You’re not listening to me. I don’t have the experience to deal with this on my own.”
“Will you fuck me?”
CW: implied infidelity
Harry took his hand, casual as anything, as Draco closed the flat door behind them. The stairs were far too narrow for two people to walk down side-by-side but neither of them made a move to let go, and so, feeling lovesick and a bit foolish, Draco led the way. And then all at once they were back in the lab together, Harry sinking down into his old chair, making offhand remarks about the differences since the last time he’d been here – that it was messier, mostly – as though absolutely
And what a picture Harry made, Draco thought, greedily taking in the way he looked kneeling half over the shimmering puddle of Draco’s best dress robes: eyes sparkling with laughter, come shining across his pecs, hair completely dishevelled and lips bitten scarlet.
“Right, right. Sorry.”
Leonie’s anxious voice drifted up the stairs, interrupting his fatalistic train of thought. “Draco? Are you all right up there? I heard a bang. Do you need any help?”
The rest of the weekend, however, was rapidly becoming unbearable. Draco would Apparate home in the early hours of Saturday morning, down some Dreamless Sleep, wake up sweating far too soon and huddle, shivering, in his bed for the best part of the day. He craved the
“Love to,” Harry replied. “Any idea how?”
, Draco thought, as he felt his face arrange itself into a sympathetic expression. In the years he’d sat behind Neville, Draco had seen him systematically botch every single assigned potion, in every conceivable way. On one occasion, they’d evacuated the entire dungeons after Neville had inadvertently managed to unleash a lethal sentient mist by stirring his Muffling Draught in the wrong direction. There was no doubt in Draco’s mind; Neville was

“I don’t think so.” Harry thought for a second. “She said something about a boy running through an airport? I reckon there was also a school play, and someone who spoke Portuguese? I’d sort of tuned out by that point, if I’m honest.”
“Show off,” murmured Draco, hauling Harry back in for another messy kiss; legs opening instinctively to allow him closer.
It all seemed fair enough to Draco. But what could he do to help her? How could a Squib even begin to―
“Oh, do fuck off, Pans,” he spat back at her. “I’m amazed you managed to pull your head out of your own arse long enough to read the
Neville arrived in high spirits, launching immediately into a long speech about how he’d
There was movement over Bryn’s shoulder, and Draco’s roving eyes quickly spotted Harry making his way towards them through the crowds. The corner of his mouth quirked up slightly when he met Draco’s gaze.
“It’s a fucking joke, is what it is,” muttered one of the Unspeakables darkly, as she emerged from the trees,
“Yeah, tucked away in a tiny corner of the seven-page spread…”
Draco furrowed his brow. Why was the house-elf getting all worked up? Someone should let her know that Nagini was gone now. Everything was going to be just fine.

As Draco watched, he felt a tap on his shoulder.
Draco laughed. “Don’t be ridiculous, Potter.”
“He watched you come in, you know.”
. He brushed his tongue over the slit, dipping inside just barely, and then down to ring the sensitive skin underneath the crown. Encouraged by Harry’s gasps, he ran his mouth back up Harry’s cock to gently lap up the fresh bead of moisture which had gathered, glistening, at the tip.
Draco’s vision darkened at the edges as he fell back in the chair, the ringing in his ears drowning out all other sounds. The blurred shape of Harry moved towards him, and then – nothing.
Neville looked confused. “What do you mean?”
, mostly, whenever I’m in an unfamiliar place, or feeling nervous, but also for Firewhisky, if I’m with people who are drinking, or if I’m embarrassed or ashamed, or – I guess – if I just want to escape. Most of the time they pass quickly, but sometimes they don’t, and I can’t sleep, and… oh, I still get panic attacks, as well. And I get frustrated when I can’t remember things, and I know I worry too much about what people think of me. I can be irritable…”
“…we’ve had to stick to short-lasting Muggle sedative medicine and Nev’s herbs so far; we’re trying to stay away from potions as much as we can. Means this bit will be harder for you, but this way we avoid any unforeseen interactions, or creating different dependencies, which…” She fell silent, turning away as the bathroom door opened.
“And you and he are friends now.” It wasn’t a question.
“Oh, I’m just being polite to an old friend.”
. Scary, really.” As they watched, the blond bent forwards to speak to the barman, tight trousers clinging to the curve of his bum. His companion didn’t bother to hide his ogling, eyes roving blatantly over the blond’s lithe frame as he ran an idle hand through his mop of black hair.
Next, he ventured out to Diagon for the first time in years. He kept his hood up, watchful for any signs of trouble, but no one even batted an eyelid as he popped into Gringotts to set up a business account. On the way back, he stopped by Twilfitt and Tattings to purchase some new robes in the shorter, less traditional style that had become popular since the war, and finally, before he could talk himself out of it, he pulled open the little door to Weeoanwhisker’s, and emerged, half an hour later, his previously long, unkempt hair shorn into a severe Muggle-style crew cut. As he stared at the stranger in the mirror, his nails scraping up the back of his head to feel the unfamiliar shape of his skull, he felt as though all his sins had been washed away. Gone was the boy, so like his father. Gone were the riches, the status, the expectations. Here he stood: raw, hungry, desperate for a fresh start.
hot – all over his body. There was a dry, intense heat in his throat and behind his eyeballs. His back, buttocks, and legs were burning up where they were touching the bedsheets, and his hair was damp with sweat. He grabbed a glass of water from the bedside table, draining it completely. He ripped off the covers and then his clothes in a panic and lay back down. Salazar, he needed to sleep. Why couldn’t he sleep?
really made any difference to Draco; he hadn’t bothered to keep track of the days once they began to blur together in the first few months after his trial. He didn’t need to look at a calendar to know that he’d wasted a whole year of his life. Imprisoned in his childhood home, he wandered from room to room, invented pointless ways to pass the days and shouted at the house-elf – all the while, trying desperately not to think about the future. The folded
and his spectacular orgasm had well and truly gone, leaving in its wake a sore head and a sense of embarrassment and unease.
“If you’re sure?”
“What I’m doing? Neville, I’m not running a Squib charity project! I’ve hired Lee to be my assistant. She tells me she’s going to work hard, that she can do basically what a witch can do, and I believe her. Besides, doesn’t Granger work for Magical Creatures? House-elves, werewolves, goblins, et cetera? What’s she got to do with Squibs?”
They take their glasses and the rest of the bottle out onto the balcony, squish their legs between the cast iron railings and drink. The laughter of passers-by and the hiss of buses braking drifts up to fill the comfortable silence, as they take turns pointing out the tiny shapes of people walking up and down Parliament Hill. Eventually the sky begins to darken, and the smell from the chippie becomes too tempting to resist, so Harry wanders down there, grinning up at Draco as he emerges with piled Styrofoam boxes of cod and chips. He looks at the front door –

“…harder to predict…”
“Yes, Minister,” said Malfoy smoothly. Harry nodded.
“Look, humour me, okay? So, do you remember that time, back then? The time we sat here, on the edge of the bath together? And you… and I…” Harry was leaning against the doorframe, looking vaguely nauseous. “I felt so sick, and I couldn’t talk properly. We sat here, and you… you―”
was working. It was quite disconcerting, chatting with Neville Longbottom as though they’d always been mates. As though Draco hadn’t once hexed his hands to his feet and left him curled up in Snape’s size six brass cauldron for an entire afternoon.
His eyes remained completely unfocussed. Pansy’s voice was distant but full of disdain. “Great. Am I to assume you didn’t read my owl at all, then?”

It had been, he reflected that evening, the best day he’d had in years. Clearly, he’d brewed a perfect batch of
“There’s no department in the Ministry responsible for Wizarding-Adjacents,” Potter explained. “Hermione’s been working on a bill which would require formal registration of their births, improving representation, helping those who want to work in the wizarding world find appropriate jobs, that sort of thing. I know she’s been looking for representatives; this would be right up her street. And it sounds as though Lee would have plenty to say.”
Two weeks. Draco sighed.
The old bricks tremble, howling at each cast.
There were no moments of unexpected genius in this match: no heart stopping, world ending smiles for Draco. In fact, it was almost over before it began – twenty minutes of the most one-sided Quidditch that Draco had ever witnessed, rain hammering down as the Cannons’ Keeper let in goal after goal, until mercifully, the Snitch was caught, ending the punishment. But to Draco, watching from under their Impervius bubble, spending most of the game trying to eat a giant twisty breadstick in a quiet, dignified manner, it felt different. Harry seemed softer today, more contented, his limbs looser. A couple of times, their shoulders brushed as Harry jumped up and down to follow the play, and while Draco tensed each time, Harry didn’t pull away. When the match was over, Draco stood so that Harry could pass by. But this time Harry stopped, his eyes flicking up to Draco’s.
never been offered a promotion. Surely Robards has got to be itching to clip on those brand spanking new epaulettes and get a nice big photo for the
of his friends. And
“And now I’m out here with you.”
Yes, Harry had been caught out like that so many times he’d lost count, all in the name of whatever strange philanthropic venture the Ministry had cooked up that month. So when Robards had leant over Harry’s desk to grab a case folder and cheerfully declared through a mouthful of biscuits that he was taking Harry off the Eeylops Owl-Napping case so he could play a charity Quidditch match on Saturday, alarm bells should have rung. Harry should have asked questions. But instead he’d agreed straight away, same as he always did. Just as Robards had known he would. After all, for all that he grumbled, Harry Potter really was a sucker for a good cause.
– merely sighed disconsolately when Harry winked at him over her shoulder.
At first, Hannah popped by daily to check on Draco, asking all kinds of questions about his mood and waving her wand over him to read his vital signs. Gradually, her visits decreased, until she or Neville were only dropping in two or three times a week, usually Floo-calling Draco on the weekend. Some of their other friends also stopped by – Dean Thomas, some of the Diagon Quidditch team – all asking after Draco’s wellbeing. It seemed they’d all been told that he’d had some unspecified illness, and they all quickly waved Draco’s profuse apologies away. Even Ron turned up a few weeks in, ostensibly to sort out an issue with one his orders, but it was clear when he too grudgingly started questioning Draco about his health that he’d been press-ganged into checking up on him.
“But?”
“Do I really need to explain why that’s not a good idea?”

and take in turn. He slid his free hand down and began palming his erection steadily through his boxers, concentrating on the sounds Harry made – the small, incredulous grunts of pleasure encouraging Draco to bob his head faster, to take Harry deeper. After a few minutes, Harry’s hips began to stutter upwards in time with Draco’s movements, until he was unconsciously thrusting into Draco’s mouth. Harry’s fingers scrabbled at the back of Draco’s hair as he tried to get better purchase on the short strands.
“That’s what he told me.”
“Oh yes.” Draco nodded wisely. “

just sitting right there in your sodding bathroom cabinet.”
Crowson cocked his head, mouth twisting up into a mocking smile. “Strange, that’s definitely what I heard.”
Draco looked up, appealing desperately to the Aurors behind Crowson. Three of them stared straight ahead, avoiding his gaze. The fourth one though – a middle-aged, balding man – was glaring directly at the back of Crowson’s head, fists clenched. Something about his expression was familiar, but Draco couldn’t place it, and he leant forward, trying to to get a closer look, before –
“You’re the Auror, what do you think?”
“And thank fuck for that,” Harry says with a grimace. “Dingy old pile. Christ, I don’t think I saw the sun for the six weeks I was stuck sorting that place.” He wasn’t exaggerating; the longer Harry had spent uncovering mouldy furniture and throwing out rotten food, the darker and lonelier the house had become. It had all been most unpleasant, with ceilings lowering day by day and corridors stretching out before his very eyes. He’d woken frequently at night to the sound of disembodied footsteps, or the stench of burning meat that he couldn’t source and that Kreacher – sour-faced and obstructive as always – denied being able to smell.
With a sigh, he gently untucked himself, slipping out of the bed, pushing up the sash window with a grunt, and inhaling deeply. He felt strangely bereft, suddenly, without the warmth of Harry’s embrace, and shivered, wrapping his arms around himself for comfort as he stared out at the street below. What on earth was wrong with him? He’d just had an incredible shag – almost certainly the best of his life,
He nudged Harry. “D’you want to clean up?”
He spotted his colleagues immediately – they were gathered in a group next to a large wooded area, along with the press, some Ministry officials and a good number of spectators – and headed over towards them with a spring in his step and a glint in his eye. He was halfway across the dewy pitch when his footsteps began to slow, an unpleasant realisation dawning on him. Harry was an Auror, after all – a fairly good one, by most accounts – and right now, all his senses were screaming at him that there was something very
?! It simply wasn’t possible.
happened…”
In his dazed state, it doesn’t occur to him for a second not to do as Draco asked. He crosses the road – fortunately the rain has just settled – and plonks himself heavily down on a bench outside the now-laundrette to wait. He tips his head back into the wind, letting the gentle hum of traffic wash over him, feeling his initial shock begin to subside, giving way to genuine curiosity.
“Fine. So
get one night up close and personal with the Chosen cock. Then somehow, don’t ask me how, you manage to fuck it up almost immediately, and now you’re miserable again.”
“Fuck off, Russell,” muttered Malfoy.
The man stooped before the flames is cast in shadow, although Draco doesn’t miss the glint of a bronze badge in his pocket. A Hit Wizard, then: alone, by the looks of things. Unfamiliar words run through Draco’s mind as he inches his hand under the edge of his mattress, feeling for the wand he keeps taped to the frame. His fingertips have barely brushed the wood when it rips itself out of his reach and flies through the air, Sellotape and all, straight into an outstretched palm. Draco almost laughs with relief. He’d know that cast anywhere.
The heating charm must have worn off too, because Harry felt almost feverish with that early morning chill so familiar to him still from long nights spent on guard in lonely forests. Only this time he was far from alone – the shoulderblade poking sharply against his spine confirmed that, as did the pale strands of hair stuck to Harry’s cheek. The body pressed against his own gave a sudden shiver, the offending shoulder shifting as Malfoy stretched, extending his arms above his head with a slightly-too-loud yawn. Surprised, Harry wobbled a little, and Malfoy wobbled in turn, and all at once they were both wide awake.

Draco shakes his head, his laugh incredulous, and Harry squeezes his hand.

“I know it was just a silly idea,” he said quietly. “I know it doesn’t change the things I did.”
There’s more to come, you know, but you don’t press. You’re learning, finally, to be patient.
The box explodes, pieces of plastic and bits of electrical equipment raining down onto Harry and the burning tray. Harry blinks, ears ringing. He can’t make out Draco’s features, but he certainly recognises the exasperation in his voice.
“Because you couldn’t.” He shuffled closer. “Honestly, Draco, I’ve thought about nothing else for weeks. Come on. Come home with me. We don’t even have to do anything, not if you don’t want to.”
“I’m sorry, I was just walking past and I – I thought I’d stop by. I had hoped to speak with Mr Ollivander ―”
. Or… if you could just… just let me know… the plan, that would be… would be…”
Draco was unconvinced. He let Neville drag him over to the book, only half-listening to his rapid-fire questions about the Manor’s aquatic plants. He was completely unable to banish thoughts of Potter – or that searching expression on his face – from his mind.
And yet.
you respected me. I
Draco didn’t know what to say. It was all true. The intent had been different, sure, but the result… He hung his head. Tears were welling up in his own eyes now; tears for Lee, who had been through so much, and who he’d let down in the worst possible way.
“Great. I’ll – I’ll stop by around eight, maybe?”
? I haven’t been out in five years, and even
“Oh yes! Now I see him! He must be, uh, looking for Shrivelfigs.”
“Yes, and

“What?”
“Look, Malfoy. I really
“No, no. Of course not. I was just wondering.” They fall silent again, watching as a fat pigeon pecks around the bin next to them, before strutting over to the bench. Draco kicks out at it a couple of times; it’s undeterred, going for some crumbs just next to his well-polished shoes. A subtle repelling charm from up Draco’s sleeve sends it skidding a foot across the pavement, squawking indignantly. Harry laughs outright then, and Draco looks at him, his own mouth curving into a wide smile.
You’re on
Potter sighed, accepting Draco’s hand and hauling himself to his feet. “I must be mental. Go on then.”
“We’ve got time, Draco, plenty of time to talk and worry and work things out, okay? But you are right about one thing – as lovely as you are all wet and soapy, I really can’t spend another minute in this bloody bathroom.”
What eventually came out, though, was none of those.
“I know, Potter. If you couldn’t tell from that little love fest today, we’d met before,” Draco drawled.
“Er, hello?”

It was at this particular low point – his mother growing more distant and self-contained every day, his father’s health failing, his old friends all off pursuing their own new careers, the Malfoy name disgraced, and no career prospects on the horizon – that Draco had ventured into the attic on that fateful Monday.

’s coverage of Crowson’s assault and arrest as though nothing had ever happened, leaving Draco disappointed, and unbelievably frustrated. He was used to getting exactly what he wanted, as soon as he wanted it, and once again, Potter was proving an exception to the rule. Draco wasn’t sure what was going on. Perhaps the Quidditch match had proven to
The long winter melted into a brighter spring. Flowers bloomed from window boxes, birdsong drifted in on the breeze, sunsets crept gradually later, and – not for the first time – Draco mourned the flat’s lack of outdoor space. Unwilling to be seen in public off
“Like what?”
Draco knew he was being a brat, but it had been a shitty day, and he had drunk far too much Firewhisky to care. It was liberating, in a way, being off the
The first step, obviously, was to buy some appropriate clothes. Since the war, shops selling Muggle-style fashion had sprung up around wizarding Britain, and once Draco had left the Manor, he’d quickly come to understand their obvious practical advantages, not to mention the pleasing aesthetics. Potter, for example, very often popped by wearing a pair of jeans so tight that they were practically indecent. Not that Draco was complaining, of course.
“Harry?”
It made no sense! The sound must be moving, because it was definitely coming from the bathroom now. Draco let his hands drop down onto the bed in front of him, turning to the right to get a better look. He was slippery all over, sheets crumpled wet in his fists, and as he strained forwards to see, he fell onto his stomach with a groan.

As Draco tried to move lower, to turn his careful attention to the skin visible at Harry’s throat, he felt something catch on the front of his robes. Leaning back carefully, he realised that it was Harry’s Order of Merlin, one of its points caught in Draco’s blue silk. He reached down, gently releasing it, now keenly aware of all Harry’s ornamental trimmings, the way the heavy rope aiguillette forced far too much space between them.
Sometimes, he was struck by the fleeting thought that Lee was trying to tell him something – something deeper than the banal questions of daily life. But she never did, and anyway, what did it matter? It was in
But the mere thought of Lee was enough to dampen Draco’s spirits once more. He wondered, not for the first time, how she was doing. How much they’d told her. So far as he could tell, the shop was still open downstairs; he could hear her wandering about, occasional raised voices, sometimes the door slamming loudly. More than once, an enormous crash had actually made him head for the stairs, until he heard, to his relief, her loud and creative swearing.
“All gone, I’m afraid,” came Harry’s voice from the doorway. Draco couldn’t help opening the cabinet anyway, grabbing frantically at the drawer inside, heart sinking painfully at the sight of its empty interior.
, did you see anything that interested you in particular?”
“So is pureblood knobhead, but somehow I manage to say it just fine,” she muttered under her breath. Draco almost spat out his coffee, shooting Neville and Potter a glare as they simultaneously collapsed into unrestrained hysterics.
“Drop me an owl some time, whenever you’re ready. Or better yet, Floo-call me.”

banner rustled gently on the wall, and Draco spotted his tree – to his relief alive once more and covered in bright green leaves – over in the corner. The room was empty for many long minutes, and Draco was considering giving up when Neville finally appeared, groaning and muttering to himself as he came into view. He was paler than usual, barefoot and clad in just pyjama bottoms. His bloodshot eyes widened as he came closer.
, Draco. At first, I thought I could never forgive you. I was ready to leave, but―”
“Are you okay to get back upstairs?”
“Er, obviously you’re an Unspeakable. But – uh―” Harry looked at Malfoy, who’d stopped perfectly still, and mentally cursed himself for opening his mouth before he’d engaged his brain. Why did this have to happen around Malfoy
He wakes, and he’s sweating, and nightmarish shapes are dancing across the stones; old foes brought back to life. He’s never lit that fire, not even in the depths of winter when the cold seemed to seep straight through the walls and into his tired bones, and he’d crawled into bed straight after sundown every night just to escape the chill.
he’d forgotten; the endless rumble of car engines punctuated by traffic lights beeping. He’s peering down at the high street, thinking longingly of their old fish and chip shop – now a laundrette – when it happens. Somewhere in his peripheral vision, there’s a sudden flash of silver; light reflecting off an all-too-familiar blond head. By the time his brain catches up, the man’s already darting across the road towards him before – frustratingly – moving just out of view.

Wait a minute, why was he stuck to the bed?
Lee had only had the phone for a few weeks, but in that short time had apparently succeeded in convincing every young witch and wizard in Diagon Alley to buy their own, and the constant background
Harry shook his head. “Stairs,” he growled, rocking his body faster against Draco’s, frantic, gasping into Draco’s mouth.
It was the look on Lee’s face which remained with him all afternoon, despite
When Draco finally emerged – now washed, dressed and smelling a lot less like a brewery – they sat down for dinner at the small table in his kitchen. It was uncomfortable, to say the least. Harry’s pasta was some carbonara-type affair, and its rich, creamy smell had wafted throughout the entire flat, invading Draco’s nostrils as soon as he had opened the bathroom door, leaving him pressing a hand to his mouth in an attempt not to gag. The sight of it, thick heavy white sauce slopped out onto his plate, was almost too much to bear, but he’d been raised to be polite, and so he said nothing, poking it around ineffectually with his fork, trying to calm his stomach by taking deep breaths through pursed lips. He tried not to watch Harry, apparently oblivious to his distress, cramming forkfuls of pasta into his own mouth as though he was a man starved.
“Flirt in peace, you mean?”
was. Before things could escalate further, Draco stepped out of the lab, pulling his goggles off his forehead. “Pansy fucking Parkinson! What do you think you’re doing, terrorising my business partner?”
Draco nodded, recalling clear as day just how panicked Harry had been before the event.
“And then it was your turn. I just… I just got up and went. I told myself that this was the next trial, that I’d gone to them all so far, yours was no different. But Draco, I was wrong. As soon as I saw you, I knew that I shouldn’t have been there. That it
– to forget? I even forced myself to go to your office on my very first day so I could get the insulting or the punching or whatever over with, but―” he shrugged, “―you know, it just never happened. The way you looked at me… and you were so… well. Anyway, no-one cared. I guess the MACUSA thing trumped the Death Eater thing, and I got to see my parents again, finally. And now… now there’s you. And things.”
“Surfing, Potter.”
“I know. I―”
The noises Harry was making went straight to Draco’s own cock. Harry’s hand tightened on his shoulder as Draco sank down, taking Harry in further, until Draco’s mouth met the curl of his fist at the base of the shaft. He dragged his tongue back up to the head, memorising the feel of Harry’s cock – its length, girth, slight curve to the left – earning himself a small whimper of frustration from Harry. Draco took pity on him, lowering his head back down and setting a steady rhythm, sucking hard as he pulled back, his fist tight around the base.
There were a noisy group of young wix clustered nearby, and Draco could see several wizards glancing over at the pair. One of the younger Flint boys was amongst them, a jealous scowl smeared across his greasy face. As Draco watched him, he recalled a party, many years ago, where rumours had spread that Owen Bletchley had been spotted getting off with a half-blood Ravenclaw after the end-of-term feast. He could still see the spittle flying from old Mr Flint’s lips, and the horror on the children’s faces, as he lectured them for hours about the shame of being associated with non-purebloods. And yet here was his son, staring at Lee with naked want. The irony was delicious.

, he’d even felt a tentative camaraderie with the rest of his team as they all whooped and cheered and patted him on the back. Thomas had popped into his shop during the week, and had seemed pleased when Draco – in Thomas’ words ‘ten times better’ than their previous Seeker – had readily agreed to carry on playing for them.
“Oh, absolutely. If you’re still game, that is?” Harry spoke deliberately, sensually, dragging his words out into a promise that made Draco shiver.

Harry snorted. “Same shit, different day. Loads of paperwork. Robards still paying me too much but treating me with kid gloves. You know.” He paused, thoughtful. “Or, at least, I think you know. Do you remember? Sometimes when I’m with you it’s easy to forget that… that all the stuff we talked about before wasn’t…”
nasty, about ten centimetres long and jagged where it curved down the outside of Potter’s thigh. The healing skin was a dark purple with bruising around, and Draco focussed intently on it as he knelt down next to the chair. He tried valiantly not to let his eyes stray to the right, where the seam of Potter’s pants ran along the crease of his thigh, down towards – no,
“Great.” Draco closed his eyes, cheeks hot as anger warred with embarrassment inside him. He threw open the sash window noisily, sticking his head as far out as it would go, inhaling gratefully and feeling the cool night air enter his lungs. Harry’s words were wonderfully distant from out here.
weird. You managed to avoid her then?”
Draco turned to look at Potter. “Who?"
But no sooner had he flopped back down on his bed and closed his eyes than his peace was shattered by yet another racket from outside the window.
Suddenly, the smile fell from Malfoy’s face, and his head whirled around to the side. He tugged his wand easily from its soft leather holster and sent a flash of scarlet screaming across the pitch.
by the way, thanks very much…”
; yet another craving far beyond Draco’s control. This, though – this was pure
“How could I forget?” She laughed, lightly. “I remember asking you whether you thought the war had sent him a bit – you know…” She twirled her finger next to her head, crossing her eyes with a grin. Draco tried not to feel offended.
“I―” Draco started – it seemed Pansy’s question was rhetorical though, as she cut straight back in. Draco was secretly relieved – how could he put the answer into words, when he didn’t even quite understand it himself?
Draco nodded slowly. “I wasn’t on it then. Not that afternoon. Not when we almost…” He watched, satisfied, as Harry’s eyes widened in realisation. After a few seconds, Harry took a deep, shaky breath, collecting himself.
“Collins, Deputy Head Auror Potter,” said Collins with a neat little bob of his head, as Draco fought to keep a straight face.
Crowson was wearing a scarlet and black Quidditch jersey, stretched too tight over his round belly, and his face was red and contorted with rage. His jowls wobbled as he looked down at Draco. “Thought you’d got away scot-free, did you? Thought you’d slip out of your big fancy mansion, play the good little shopkeeper, and no one would remember all that shit you did, huh?” He nudged at Draco’s side with his boot. “Well, let me tell you something, Death Eater.

Draco finished in his head.
“Yeah…” Potter shrugged. “But maybe if

“Any idea what was in it?” Harry asked, brushing ash from his jacket. His glasses were crooked, and his voice was croaky: a side-effect of the Ministry’s speech-distortion charms, Hermione knew. He was wearing the familiar all-black uniform of the Unspeakables, the Head of Department insignia gleaming gold at his throat.
“Draco.”
“Draco―” Harry sounded deeply uncomfortable.
“Have you tried Charlie?”
him to flirt! It had wormed its way into his brain; it knew exactly how much Draco wanted Potter – how often he’d thought about that stupid, stupid photograph, how strange and exciting it had been to see him in the flesh after so long – and it had tried to… help.
“No. Not Veritaserum. I won’t – I
Lee rolled her eyes, but grabbed his arm as he rounded the counter, pulling him into a short, furious hug. He buried his head in her curls and sighed. How was he ever supposed to make things right?
, Draco was now well-practiced at meet and greets with former enemies, and he stepped forward smoothly, a contrite smile pasted over his face.
Draco smiles, slightly sadly, Harry thinks. “It is.”
Draco listened with a degree of scepticism, as Neville bent to examine some ferns. “Are you sure? Only, I knew old Birtwhistle quite well when I was a boy. I always suspected they had some dodgy activity going on there, but I assumed they were paying some Ministry official to turn a blind eye. They’ve been on Diagon for ever, though. They’ll find some way to reopen.”
, and:
“I’ve… uh… I’ve got it pretty bad for you too. You know that, right?”
“Just the once,” said Draco. “Didn’t go well.” He kept his answer deliberately offhand, desperate to avoid reliving that terrible night. The way he’d been forced to drag himself across the floor; the awful sounds that had come out of his mouth. Merlin, was it possible that that had only been three weeks ago?

They nodded at Draco distractedly.
The shame sat heavy on Draco’s tongue, and at first his mouth moved soundlessly around the words. But he took a deep breath, closed his eyes and finally they began to spill forth. “I… I still get cravings. For
– Harry didn’t gaze at him with that silly, adoring, heart-stopping smile plastered across his face. Back then, Harry didn’t let his hand brush innocently against Draco’s arse whenever he walked behind him, and he didn’t finish off Draco’s sentences with innuendo and a wink. And even if he had, of course, Draco wouldn’t have been able to flirt back. Not back then.
