Harry continued sucking him, getting more confident in his actions. His lips picked up speed, his hand pumping faster and harder than before.
Sitting in the pink bubbly water was Draco, with his arms spread out and resting on the side of the tub.
The figure trudged by the invisible boy, oblivious of his presence and continued his way along the corridor, a lamp in hand illuminating his shadow.
He continued to survey the corridor, keeping an eye out for anyone who shouldn't be out past curfew.
Harry dipped down to Draco, smothering his mouth with his own, swallowing the moans shared between them. He let up, staying slightly above Draco and continued to pound into him, watching his face contort in ecstacy, barely able to keep his eyes open.
Harry watched them leave until they were out of sight before heading towards the 7th floor. Pushing past students on the stairs and corridors was a hassle but soon enough Harry was stood outside the broom closet, just like the note said.
"Easy? You call that easy? It took me nearly all night to finish it. Are you sure you did the right homework?" Ron said sounding confused at how quick it took Harry to finish it.
For now, the fifth floor was empty, his main focus on Mrs Norris and Filch who were wondering the lower two floors. As long as they were out the way, his path should be clear. He untangled the cloak from under his arm, throwing it over his shoulders and covering his head with the hood. His whole body disappeared from view, blending in with his surroundings. Opening the door, he stepped out the frame, watching the Map closely for any change in the caretaker's patrol.
The sweat covering their skin began to dry up leaving their bodies red and hot. Draco flinched as he slipped off of Harry, falling back onto the floor with weak knees. He ran his fingers through his hair, feeling beads of sweat at the base of his neck. Draco looked over to Harry, watching as he buttoned up his shirt and shakily pulled on his pants and trousers, stuffing the hem of his shirt into the crookidly.
Reaching the Entrace hall, they passed by the Great Hall down to the dungeons underneath the black lake.
"I wanted to shut you up. You were being cocky and your ego was pissing me off, so I decided to do something about it for once." Harry admitted. He held his head up high.
"At least I don't panic if a drop of water falls on it." He watched Draco throw his head back in a snobbish manner, defending himself.
His body collapsed back against the wall, his knees buckled. His heart continued racing, pounding against his ribcage. He tried to even out his breathing.
"You better watch that mouth of yours unless you want to be reported to Professor Umbridge. I hear she gives brutal punishments. And I won't hesitate to get you in trouble just to see you get put in your place." His knuckles had turned white as he continued to grip Harry's collar.
Draco leaned down to connect his lips with Harry's, pulling at his neck to get a better angle. Harry's chest tightened as his breath became short. He parted from Draco and took panted, his cheeks red. Draco was just as flushed.
Harry rolled his eyes, a smirk lacing Draco's lips at his annoyance. Draco began fixing himself up, pulling his clothes back on his body.
"Come on, let's just go and eat already." Harry said wanting to change the atomsphere surrounding them. They huffed in response and begrudgingly followed Harry into the Great Hall.
Both boys breathed out shaky breaths, chests rising and falling as they waited for Harry to move. Every small touch left Draco's skin buzzing, legs shaking as Harry started to rock into him at a slow pace. The action pushed Draco's back further up the desk, his skin scratching against the wood every time Harry thrusted into him. Draco removed his hands from his legs, grabbing the sides of the desk to keep him from falling to the floor. Harry continuously pumped into Draco, picking up sped after every few thrusts. Their moans grew in volume, the burning desire taking over their minds. Draco lifted one of his hands to his mouth, biting the flesh and spreading saliva over his fingers, stopping himself from screaming at the top of his lungs. Harry nipped and sucked on Draco's collar bone, leaving red hickeys to mark his skin.
He leaned up onto his knees on the chaise letting Harry get up and kneel on the floor infront of him. Draco seated himself between Harry's body, a leg either side of him, his crotch above his face. A tent stuck out through his trousers, straining the fabric. Harry glanced up at Draco, a blush across his cheeks.
Harry stepped into the room, quickly making his way to the entrace, keeping his wand lit on the ground to watch where he stepped. The portraits in the corners of the room snored loudly, masking his feet on the bare, cold stone path. He stopped just behind the Fat Lady's portrait, taking the Map out of his armpit and whispering the words to lift the enchantment and scan the floors leading to his destination.
"Ah-ah-Draco~ah-I-can't-ha-ha-anymore-Ah!~" Harry tried to speak but his words got lost in his throat when Draco hit Harry's prostate, the shocked moan alerting him that he'd touched his sweet spot.
Taking off his Invisibility cloak, he rolled it up and placed it back into his trunk, closing in and climbing onto his bed. He pulled back the covers setting himself into a comfortable position. He slid his glasses off his nose and placed them upon his night stand, rolling over and plopping his head against the pillow entirely worn out. His eyes shut and within seconds he was fast asleep.
His mad demeanour vanished once Harry threw another wave over him, watching Draco turn and frown in his direction.
Umbridge's sickly sweet voice made Harry's blood boil, her words even more so. She stood up from her desk, her heeled shoes slapping against the stone floor, making herself comfortable next to him, a disgusting sneer adorning her face.
The common room was dimly lit, quiet. Easy for Harry to return to his dormitory without being questioned and stared at once he walked in. He crept up the stairs, trying his best to sneak into his room without waking anyone. The door gave way, a tiny creak as he closed it behind him. The boys in the room were asleep, Ron snores filling the silence. Harry kept his eyes on them as he walked over to his bed. He placed his bookbag down, throwing himself onto the mattress in complete exhaustion. He couldn't be bothered to clean himself nor his hurt hand, placing his glasses down on the bedside table, rolling over and tugging the covers up to his neck. He was spent for the day, his eyes drooping the second he rested his head on the pillow. He hoped sleep would come easy tonight, just so he could rest after everything that had happened today, even if it was for just one night.
"Well, let's get back now before anyone comes looking for you." Harry grabbed his cloak, throwing it over his shoulders and opening the Map back up, whispering the secret words to it. He reached the door ready to open it, only turning around when Draco hadn't come over yet. Harry deapanned, Draco still playing with his hair meticulously.
"No promises." Harry argued back, watching Draco open the door slowly. Draco checked the corridor for anyone lurking about but the coast was clear. Draco scoffed at Harry's statement and glanced one last time at Harry. Harry wiggled his eyebrows at him and winked.
Professor Snape stood in the doorway of the Great Hall, glaring at all of the students infront of him. Hermione opened her mouth to speak to him, however he put his hand up to silence her.
"What do you think you're doing?! Get off me now-Ah!" Draco began to protest but Harry's teeth biting down had cut his sentence short. A groan had slipped through his lips instead. Draco's body began to heat up, a blush forming along his cheeks and neck and his blood rushing through his veins. His pants began to tighten.
The voices from the stairs so faded away before the corridor was completely quiet. Harry leaned against the wall, tapping his foot impatiently, glancing up and down to checked the floor was empty. Everyone seemed to have vacated the corridors, all piled in the Great Hall.
"I'm supposed to be on corridor duty tonight, you know, for Umbridge." He started to play with his hair, brushing parts out of his face and tucking it behind his ear.
"'Your Highness'", Draco repeated along his tounge, his minty breath cascading over Harry's face, "I quite like that, I think it suits me pretty well, don't you agree?" He purred, stroking his thumb across Harry's chin.
"Fine. But don't think that you will make me beg again." Draco declared, fixing his clothing and hair before crossing to the door. Harry chortled.
"Please." Draco mumbled into Harry's shoulder hoping that was enough to satisfy him. His cheeks darkening from the embarrassment of having to plea.
Desperate to cum, Draco latched onto Harry's shoulders speeding up the process and bounced up and down on his cock. Harry, now desperate too, let Draco take the reins, sitting back and watching the blond squirm and shudder atop him.
"Nothing, it's fine." Harry didn't want to talk about it, not to anyone. Any complaint about what Umbridge was doing to him, she'd know she was getting to him, controlling him. He had to keep his mouth shut.
"Malfoy? Are you done patrolling already?" Goyle asked, confused at how quick Draco had returned to the Dungeons.
"The Room of Requirement. It appears to people who need it most. Although the room changes depending on the person's needs." Harry answered.
Draco slammed the door behind him, rushing over to the sink and turning the faucet on. Cupping the water in his hands, he splashed it over his burning face cooling himself down. The water helped his temperature lower but he became more aware of the uncomfortable tightness in his pants.
Harry watched the hole close up again before making his way back up the stairs to Gryffindor Tower, disturbing the Fat Lady.
A symphony of moans tumbled from Draco's lips as Harry sucked him, his hand pumping along the shaft for extra pleasure.
As his lips pressed against Draco's neck he could feel the vibrations of the moans Draco was emitting. His tounge played with Draco's adam's apple, swirling and nipping at it leaving the blond breathless.
"Oh Merlin, H-AH...Harry." Draco managed to pant out, his words catching in his throat, unable to speak more.
Draco walked past Ron and Hermione, smirking at them with Crabbe and Goyle shuffling close by. Draco stared at Harry for a spilt second before shoving past him. A crumpled piece of parchment manifested into Harry's pocket as Draco's arm brushed past him. Harry looked down at the note before meeting Draco's eye once more, seeing a wink sent his way. A ghost of a smile pulled at Harry's lips, unnoticed by his friends.
A snarl let loose from Draco's mouth. He was right. Draco did enjoy it. His mind was telling him he hated it but his body was eager to do it again.
A series of light footsteps tapped against the stone floor as they rushed down the corridors, the wind brushing against the invisible cloth hanging from their shoulders.
The way was clear until they reached the last set of stairs, the hallway to the Slytherin Common Room blocked by two hulking figures: Crabbe and Goyle. They stood against the wall, arms crossed, looking unbothered.
Looking around the room, he noticed its interior was different, not stacked with forgotten relics or junk. It was spacious.
Draco groan as he squeezed against Harry's fingers. A second finger joined the first, starting to spead his opening wider. Harry's fingers slicked with arousal everytime he repeated his motions, smearing the liquid along his ass. Draco squirmed, his hand latching on to Harry's wrist as he moaned.
"Says the one who's hair always looks like a bird's nest." Draco retorted, looking at Harry's hair in disgust.
"REALLY, DRACO! AGAIN!", Draco's laugh reverberated through the room, pissing Harry off. "Fine, if that's how you wanna play, you're on." Harry shoved a bunch of water into the air, watching as Draco got drenched in the soapy suds.
"I do not care what happens between students, however....." he paused before continuing. "Seeing as one of my students has been injured, I have to make it my business. Malfoy, What happened?." He asked turning his attention towards Draco.
Draco continued to pump in and out, beginning to reach his limit, clenching his teeth as he pushed in a few more times. Draco's arms tightened aground Harry's middle, his body stilling and shooting ropes of cum into him. Harry could feel each shot, his ass feeling full and warm from evey slap of Draco's hips.
Harry glared at him. "What now, Malfoy? Following me again?" He grumbled, staring Draco in the eyes.
"What's wrong, Potter? Don't tell me that they actually left you? I guess they came to their senses and saw how pathetic you really are. Famous Potter with no friends." Draco teased.
Harry raced up the stairs two at a time, out of breath by the time he reached the Portrait door. The Fat Lady was nonetheless unhappy with being disturbed again by Harry but he couldn't care right now, stepping through the open door once he'd given her the password.
"Leave me alone Malfoy." Harry seethed through clenched teeth. His jaw tensed and temple throbbed, deep lines etching across his brow.
Just as he was about to turn away, he was taken aback when he saw Malfoy's gaze flick up at him, without roving around to search for him. He seemed to know just exactly where Harry was sitting, which might mean he was aware of him and it may not be his first glance. When he caught Harry's eyes, he startled and looked down to his book quickly. Harry narrowed his eyes, puzzled and somewhat wary as well, and then turned his head to the front, towards Professor Slughorn who had just walked in.
They sit on his bed as they eat together, one of Potter's legs hanging off the side, the other curled on the mattress. His tie is as askew as ever. The hem of his trousers are riding up, putting his mismatched socks on display. Second Year, Draco had noticed them. He'd made a snide comment, something about Potter being blind as well as colourblind. It leaves a tug of quiet endearment in his cheek now.
"Not at all," Harry said. He brushed a hand over his rib, the feel of a somewhat clear ridge if he pressed slightly.
"I don't know. Even emotional bonds are an entire category all on its own, you know. Different types of it. Some even thrive on negative emotions, did you know?" She huffed, a mix of weirded and awed. "Okay. So maybe yours isn't affected by negative emotions, but then in that case, it would be on the basis of positive emotions, so it
"Special cases," Xavier answered, simply. "Emotional bonds are extremely tricky things, you see. And when it comes to saving lives, in magic?" He sat back against the chair, fingers curled loose on the desk. "Sometimes, Mr. Potter… it just isn't as simple as being
Moonstone eyes slowly opened, blinking groggily. They met his own after a moment of regaining focus and orientation, blinking again to clear the blur. Harry smiled at him.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "Malfoy. Whatever you need to talk about, talk about it. Right here. There's no need for all these… these formalities or whatever."
"Hello," Draco mumbles, clearing his throat roughly. He straightens his back and lifts his head higher, says it again, louder. "Hello."
Draco tried to show him how, without a wand, but it took him several tries to focus his magic and really manage to cast it. He seemed bewildered by this.
"Hello. Surprising you," Draco says. "I thought I'd finally come and see you, since you were so clearly miserable without me."
A while after, Harry checked the time. It was almost eight. They'd been in bed together for about an hour.
"I'm sure it is," Malfoy said, his voice slow, and Harry looked at him. He was thinking as he spoke. "I
Harry doesn't try to seek Draco out, to bridge this strange gap between them. He only catches sight of him from a distance, sometimes when Draco isn't looking, sometimes right when he is, and they are both left floundering, circling around each other, neither of them approaching the other out of their own reasons.
On a conversation with Hermione, it is pointed out that Draco talks to no one but Harry, which may be indicative of something contradictive to his unkind behaviour. Harry comes back later to find Draco in the midst of a severe panic attack and, in his desperation to calm him down, pulls him down to the bed with himself and lets Draco weep in his chest. After this, Draco is more open to allowing Harry's company, having learned that Harry's departure will hurt either way.
? The great mystery was so bloody anticlimactic and underwhelming that Harry wanted to bash his head against a wall. He couldn't even Disapparate out of here due to the wards.
Harry looked back at him. There was something brimming in his eyes, beneath the illness keeping them worn.
"I'm afraid not," the solicitor said to that, and went on to explain how it would be a symbol for the formation of the marital bond, the channel between their magical cores that allowed the circulation of the curse's magic, that it signified an agreement to join them together.
Malfoy nodded, staring down at the space of the ground between his splayed legs. "I'll be gone by tomorrow morning."
It took another fifteen minutes to conjure a stag, translucent white and lissome, shooting up from his palm, pressed up against Malfoy's spine. It flew through the wall, rushing towards St. Mungos, and then the Department of Mysteries.
It was strange that everything else of their lives should stay the same after what they had come home from yesterday.
"We'll, uh… we'll see you later. Harry." Hermione smiled tightly, awkwardly, at Harry, grabbed Ron by the arm and hauled him away forcefully.
With a lift of Draco's wand up at the ceiling, the vast, black sky comes into form, the stars scattering across it. Harry whispers Draco's name into the endlessness, watches them draw together into a glowing, dotted outline of the head of a dragon. Under it, they lie close together, both exhausted by the night and the half-arsed sleep for weeks. Draco's legs are tangled and brushing with Harry's, Harry's arm loose around the line of his spine, hand light at Draco's lower back. Their faces, so close on the pillow they're sharing air, just drowsily watching each other.
"I don't think we should—" Harry said, raspy. He swallowed hard, tried not to stare at his mouth, his own watering at the thought of exploring. He wanted to slide his hands up the opening of his shirt, feel the heat of him, the planes of his bones. Wanted his body hot against his. Wanted his hands and his legs around him. Wanted. Just wanted, desire a deep and wide and hollowing well.
Draco stood at the counter pouring himself tea from the kettle, in his satin lavender robes again, humming very low along to a song playing from his wireless, his voice just a little over it. He did that on the days he was much less moody and uptight. Harry was watching him from the doorway, a faint and amused smile playing at his lips, unnoticed.
Harry was drunk, and slow, his mind leaden with the alcohol in his system, and with his inhibitions loosened, it was the easiest thing to grab the pillow out of Draco's hands, throw it down at the foot of the bed instead. He scooted over across the distance between them and left an inch of space, and he folded a loose arm around Draco's middle.
And he can imagine him, sitting at the study desk in his dorm, writing all these letters he'll never send to somebody in a nonexistent world. To Harry.
Elias was still hovering over his lips. "I don't… really know what I thought." He smiled, bit it back, huffed again. Harry followed the movement of his mouth, fixated. "Part of me didn't really want to know."
"It did." But now there are many other scars to replace them, hidden underneath, and so it hardly matters. He doesn't say this.
. He remembers a strong body against his cheek, arms around him. The sound of weeping against his shoulder.
dot on the Marauder's Map. He lifted his head to look at his best friends, Ron and Hermione, snuggling with each other across from him. "He didn't show up for any of his classes since two weeks before Christmas holidays." Harry had spent those holidays with the Weasleys, Hermione, Andromeda and Teddy at the Burrow. He knew Malfoy went back to the Manor to spend them with his mother. "He just sits cooped up in his room all day long now. He doesn't even come to the Great Hall to
Harry shakes his head slightly. Neville is waiting for him to say something. He smiles a bit, though it comes too strange on his face. "Hello, um." He feels a bit nervous. He puts his hands into his pockets. "I was just… is... is Draco in there right now?"
The atmosphere is warm and nice, and there are drinks and people dancing all around to an upbeat tempo, some of them on their own, others caught in a dance with somebody else. Harry's sitting by Ron and Hermione, and Luna and Neville on the other side of them, when he sees him, making his way through the crowd of people for his dorm.
"Best out of what? There's only one of you," Draco said, huffing. He spoke a little absently, though he was considerably less drunk than Harry. His head had dipped where he was holding a shirt under his chin, his hands carefully folding it together.
It was a long while after, when Harry had stopped expecting any answers, that Draco did turn over onto his back, with a scooting of his body, a press of his foot on the mattress. Then he was facing up at the ceiling, a shaky breath shuddering through his body. Above the barricading, Harry could see his hair, mussed and spread out all over his own pillow.
"Don't do it," Harry whispered, temple leaned against Draco's, his voice so quiet that neither of them would have heard it if the wind carried it away, soft and sorrowful and breathless from kisses and desperation. His lungs were burning, the back of his eyes and his throat burning too. His quivering hands took his face gently. "Don't do it. Please."
Everything became surreal after that, too dim and too sharp. Bill's voice was a distant drone, his mind still buzzing on his words, all that it meant.
He won't be a choice Potter will make and regret, and he won't wait for Potter to make his choice and realise that Draco is hardly a choice at all. If it means that he will burn one way or the other, then he will not stay to become ashes and watch the fire die out.
"Yeah. Like he already knew he wouldn't have to. And the whole civil act was just a part of that. Harry, this
The road to recovery wasn't going to be easy, but looking into the moonstone eyes staring back into his own with tentative faith and trust, he knew there wasn't anything else he could believe.
Still, there had been few moments that they mildly interacted, wordless and uneasy, such as that time Malfoy had picked up his shrivel figs for him —  having rolled over to a black oxford after they'd slipped from Harry's hands. Malfoy had been seated in the adjacent row right beside him, handed them to him without looking at him.
For a long time, he sits there in all his love turned to grief, running through him with nowhere to go---until it pulls him to his feet, in some desperate need of catharsis. Until it strides him forward and drops him down on the chair in front of the desk.
One after another after another, Harry was driven down to his back as Draco lowered himself over him, a slow kiss-by-kiss that pushed him further towards the bed. Draco's hands, at his neck, his jaw, through his hair, the two of them losing themselves in each other.
"I don't—it just started—hurting—" Draco choked out, as Harry was maneuvering himself around him, pulling him back against his chest, in the cradle of his legs. Draco was heavy against his sternum. He pulled him tight, wrapping his arms around him, putting his cheek to his forehead.
Draco's face slips, then, just slightly, a peculiar expression flashing across his face, before it's quickly schooled away into an unimpressed look. Harry awkwardly withdraws his hand.
"Why didn't you come back after the obliviation, if you still felt... I mean, you didn't send any letters after... I spent months believing you erased me entirely, and I..." His voice goes a little strained, trailing off for a bit. "I think I felt like I was going mad for a while."
Malfoy's fingers moved slightly, so that Harry's slipped between his, loose and curling a little more. Harry liked the hum between them, piquant and warm and jangling up the nerves of his arm, the way it cocooned around his heart, shivered down his spine.
They had stopped here on the way to have dinner. It was a fairly fancy place, full of golden sconces and candlelights, all lush red decor. Outside, the rain pattered fast and loud, rushing over roofs and falling to the streets in a roaring rhythm, and through the window beaded with droplets, they could see the way it had made the streets dark grey, the blurred blue neon lights of the place across from here.
Harry blinked, until his vision was focusing better. He was still drowsy and weak, and when he asked them how long he'd been out, his voice didn't come out right — it came out too thick, croaky, words running into each other.
"Harry." Draco's lips shape around his name, soundless. He traces the line of Harry's face with his fingers. Without his glasses, he looks much younger, smooth-faced. Again, this time a whisper, "Harry."
Once the apologies are exchanged between Matthew and Scorpius, Harry calls for the class to settle down again and lets Draco finish up what he was saying, this time asking for all questions and comments to be at the end.
He looks at his thin and frail mother, alone for months on end, alone even after he's returned, who watched him every moment he was with her as if he's about to disappear, and says, "I will, Mother." He takes a hold of her hand with his good arm, making the reality of himself, his presence, known the only way he knows how. "I will."
A weight pressed gently against Harry's shoulder, the soft of a cheek and the hard of a bone, and he could smell the shampoo in Draco's hair. The back of his fingers pressed against the back of Draco's. His throat convulsed, thick and tight, when Draco slipped them over his hand, head bowed against his shoulder as they watched Harry entwine them together on the tile between them, their forearms pressed together.
It was hazy and fast-paced the first hour—of finding Draco unconscious, carrying him from the floor of the bedroom and onto the bed. He was bleeding out of his nose, and he was so cold.
He dusts off his trousers, the back of his coat, pushing up to his feet in a haste. He adjusts his own knitted hat over his head, pushing it over the front of his hair, pulling it back again, adamantly not looking at Draco's tensed figure below him.
Not so anymore, at least. He isn't eleven, angrily weeping under the covers of his bed at night over a rejected handshake. He isn't twelve, watching Potter laugh with his friends across the Great Hall, trying to think him vexing and only ending up aching. He isn't thirteen and fourteen and fifteen, carrying a black cloud over his heart for ruining it all and just wanting to mean
On some bad nights, he still talks to him through the coin, foolishly imagining Draco is on the other side, listening to him, but he can't hear him breathing and it's hard to not remember he's only imagining it.
In June of 2002, a summer party that took place at their own flat, Hermione proposed to Ron in front of all their friends and family.
Luna is holding a handful of leaves in her palm, transforming them into butterflies, giving him tips on how to draw his magic. How to focus it. How to mold it into the act of transfiguring.
This all came to an end when Malfoy one day pushed his arm away with a frustrated noise, grabbed his wrist and pulled them both up to the wall beside the fridge, stepping back into it. He'd slid Harry's hands under his own shirt, put them to himself.
"Yes," Draco says, with a nod, simultaneously shooting Harry a glare. "Yes you can, but in chemistry it's different because it can change into an entirely different colour even when the colour combinations aren't — Actually, wouldn't you say it's very cool that we can create something that makes sick people feel better faster?"
Harry feigns affrontement, narrowing his eyes, a hint of mirth. Draco is drawing a handful of them out, looking through them one after another. "Oh well, sorry I was so
But then there were days he turned Draco's last letter over and over, reading it, trying to derive more hope than hopelessness from it.
Maybe it's just the sense of somebody being there. Maybe it's his words, something to focus on that isn't his own thoughts.
"I'm sorry," Harry said. "You didn't really deserve that. And it's just… I just wish they would leave the war behind already."
He made his way down the stairs. Draco was still sitting on the couch by the fireplace, still in the clothes he'd worn to the party, his coat over his arm. He was just staring off into the middle distance, a furrow between his brows. He was quivering slightly, his fists in the knees of his trousers, the curse perhaps having acted up for him for a good while now.
Harry startled at the hands on his shoulders and arms. Malfoy was blindly tapping his hands over him to get his attention, his excited and awed gaze was fixated on the band playing on the stage, the guitarists and pianists and drummers. It was a strange expression on the otherwise cold or bitter or exhausted face. Harry had somehow not considered what positive emotions not laced with malice might look like on Malfoy's face. His chest felt strange at the sight of it. "Listen!" he yelled over the chorus of noise. "Here it comes, Potter! The best part!"
A week of doing this, the discontentment fed into itself until it became a sort of hunger, like being starved to somewhere beyond reach or comprehension.
Draco was by the foodtable again when he went to him, alone, drinking out of a flask. His hand was trembling. Harry frowned, moving closer.
Malfoy laughed, all quivering, thick puffs of wild bliss, squirmed against him, and Harry felt it too. He felt it all with that crystal intensity, heightened to the point that he was drunk and slow with it, and still yet the clearest, most burning thing he'd ever experienced. It overcame his senses, the two of them searching for little releases with every touch and movement and feel.
"I don't know why I did," Harry said, breathing a small laugh, because he looked back on himself and thought, he must have always been at least a little mad when it came to Draco. "I just saw your name, and I went."
But then the weight of his past secrets leadened his heart, and he only felt sick with himself instead, for even wondering if he shouldn't say anything. He hadn't been saying anything for a long time, and it had led them here anyway.
"We'll do it again next week, okay? I promise," Harry said to him loudly across the distance, frowning for quite a while afterwards.
"What's your favourite colour?" Harry asked him at breakfast, almost mindlessly, but for that vague thought he'd had that morning somewhere in the back of his mind, somehow still stuck, it seemed. The Bond-intensified sex, and the long run after, had him feeling good, and the words came easy in the lingering rush of it.
He makes a hazy walk back to his own dorm. The entire commons is emptied of people by now, who have all gone to the Great Hall. Neville is the only one there, waiting for him.
Perhaps it was the thought that Malfoy would not feel inclined towards opening up to him, or wanting to be his friend, that Harry would be the last person he would want to talk to anyway, and Harry didn't even know if he could help him. He was hardly in the best state of mind himself most days. He was afraid he might just end up making things worse.
"Take me for a dance?" Draco said. He was holding his hand out over the table. Their dinner was finished, and they were both on their third or fourth glass of fine wine.
In the dark was a silhouette, leaning heavily against the doorframe for a moment. That sickly pull in his chest had a direction now, focusing in on it. It wasn't an urge, anything forceful, only a mere sense, there, towards the body — Malfoy, stumbling towards him, tripping over when he reached the bed.
Almost a year later, Harry was sitting at his kitchen table, an invitation to Malfoy Manor loose between his hands. His heart had seized, inexplicably, at the name signed at the bottom.
Draco takes a moment to absorb the idea of this. "What makes this different from what any educated wizard can achieve?"
He is fascinated by what he sees of Draco, when he walks Scorpius to school hand-in-hand, the way he lowers on one knee before his son and fusses over him, touches his hair sweetly as he speaks to him, parts ways with a kiss to the side of his hair.
Draco is held down by the leaden weight of his own body and head, and so cannot express his distaste beyond an annoyed scowl. "Your vitals are all off-kilter. Have you been getting proper food and sleep, Mr. Malfoy?"
Draco heaves a close-mouthed sigh, heavy, looking at him with a thin set of his lips. He keeps silent for a moment, and it seems to Harry that he won't tell him this time either.
"Yeah. I just — you know. He's been helping me study for the NEWTs," is what Harry says, the first thing that comes to mind that might make sense to Ron. Ron's face is unreadable, and he looks down at the board, moving his piece. There's a pause. Another turn passes by, Harry's, and then it goes back to Ron. "Ginny was talking about you the other day."
Or, that's their usual Wednesdays. Today, Ron had asked Hermione on a date in Charms, after checking with Harry to see if he's alright with it being just the two of them for the day, to which Harry had said,
, Draco thinks. He carries it through the day with him, and the way it feels separate of him, not him at all, because he has somewhere to go back to now.
And then Malfoy broke out into laughter, open and free and uncontained. Even despite the lack of air, which made his laughter soundless, he laughed and laughed, relieved and amused. His white-blonde head was thrown back until it touched the wall and he was slipping down against it as he shook, and Harry hadn't seen him laugh as much as he did today
Harry swallowed around his heart, looking up at him now. Draco's hair was all softly around his eyes, feathered shadows on his face, the sharp line of his throat in firelight. He was so beautiful, and smart, and lovely, and Harry hadn't ever thought it was possible to want somebody with an intensity quite like this, in every sense of the word
"You should go," Malfoy echoed, and then he pushed himself up on his hands as well to mimic his sitting position. "Those mother-henning friends of yours are probably going insane wondering where you've gone."
Harry's gaze remained away, stilled, long after Malfoy had gone. In the kitchen, there was only the sound of his own breaths, unsteady and shallow. There was something hot bubbling low in his stomach, and his hands, still left craving in another way.
"Surprising, I know, but not really," Neville says. He pauses. "Well. This isn't exactly a complaint, just… weird, maybe. He does have some rather odd sleeping rituals…"
But they had stayed here long enough anyway. Harry looked at Draco, cocked an eyebrow, as if to say,
"Perhaps some day," Draco says. He settles back down in his chair. He pauses for a moment, throat convulsing. He darts a glance away, and then down at the top of the desk. His jaw shifts. "And what of the other things I'd—that I'd like to forget? Things unrelated to the dreams?"
But it was fair, and he knew it was. Hadn't Harry not wanted him then either? Hadn't he made that very clear as well?
"S'not like I knew," Harry said, sitting back with his head over the back of the couch. He breathed through the nausea.
There was a pause, a fairly long one.  "That, I don't know." There was the small sound of him swallowing. "It doesn't matter. I'm going to figure it all out."
Around mid-October, Bill firecalled Harry and told him about a curse-breaker who was willing to travel to Britain and help them.
And then Harry can't see him anymore, somebody sliding up in front of Draco and blocking his view of him.
Harry looked ahead, down at the bottle in his hand. At the waves of water below, moving unhurried. "Ever wish you could be with somebody you wanted?"
In his trunk, left slightly open for its mass of contents, he can see all the drawings and notes he's collected over the months in the furthest corner. He picks up one. It says,
Just as the thought came, however, it went when he remembered the glint of light and life in Malfoy's eyes. He had looked happy today, almost, after months. So was he really?
Like they were about to kiss. Except that it wasn't something that they did. Kissing was for lovers, and that wasn't what they were.
"I can rest here on this chair," Draco said, gesturing at the table. Whatever he saw on Harry's face made him soften again. He curled an arm around his neck, and then the other, clasping them together, Harry wrapping his own arm around him without a thought. "Stop worrying. If I feel like I'm pushing myself too hard, or getting tired, I will know when to stop."
The name said out loud left a pang in his chest, even years later, briefly snatching the air away from his lungs. Malfoy had gone silent and solemn too, a far cry from the boy that once ruthlessly brought up Cedric's death in an insensitive manner.
, Harry can't say, because it's been years and things are different and Harry doesn't really know how Draco feels about him today, even though he has his hopes.
He stirred to the sunlight in his face, his vision bright red behind his closed eyelids. He stretched out on the bed without opening his eyes, yawned cavernously, and realized only seconds later that his elbow didn't knock into any pillows.
Draco pauses. He does not know how to explain blood relations to a three-year old. "Yes, but. Much handsomer."
"It did," Neville says. Ron is absently wiping his sleeve at Hermione's foamy mustache, most of his attention on Neville. "It still sort of does, but it was worse at first. Not afraid, but just… sort of waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's a bit hard to shake that away, to be honest, but it's been a few days, and it didn't, and… well. Seems to me like there's a lot on everybody's minds these days, and he's no different. I guess he's not really up for being a prick anymore."
But then Draco's head bobbed, slow and small at first, then a jerky, quick sort of nod. His breaths shuddered slightly again, and he sniffed, rough like tearing paper, perhaps blinking it all back. Harry wondered if he believed him at all, if he was just trying to. They just stayed like that instead, silent and inside their own heads, until Harry could hear his breathing deepen in sleep. He did not let go even then, pressing a thumb to the beat of his heart at a corner of his wrist. Feeling him alive. Here.
When he turned around, it was to the sight of Draco on his back, his head near the edge of the bed, about hanging off of it. In his hands, up high over his own face, was the camera turned backward, blatantly recording Harry in all his bare-arsed, naked glory. Draco rolled over to his stomach, until his elbows were on the mattress, flipping the camera between his fingers back upright. He was smirking, his brow cocked, legs amidst white sheets, clad in pants and Harry's pale blue shirt.
Their waitress came over with their food, gushed about how adorable they were together, and informed them that in celebration of their
Just when Harry began to wonder if he'd crossed some line, Draco snorted. A corner of his mouth had lifted.
They eye each other for a moment, not saying anything, perhaps waiting for the other to. But neither of them speak. Inexplicably, Harry finds himself smiling, half-grinning, his face splitting with it, strangely dizzied and heady from the warmth of the drinks in his system, the smell of the lingering cologne on him.
Draco is taken captive on the orders of Voldemort as punishment for not fulfilling his task and is severely abused. Severus seeks rewards from Voldemort and uses them to be allowed to see Draco. Upon learning of the severity of his torment, he slips Draco a vial of a potion named Alucinatio on his next visit. This potion gives the drinker vividly realistic dreams of a bright and wonderful life consisting of all that they desired but leaves them comatose in reality, the cure of which is the tears of those the user craves the love of. Draco dreams of a life where there is no Voldemort nor Death-Eaters, where his family is happy and he has certainty of his father's love for him, and where he begins a friendship and eventually a relationship with Harry.
That night, when Malfoy got back, Harry told him everything that Hermione passed on to him from Bill, sitting on the edge of the bed with his back to him as he pulled his shirt on over his head, and then his track bottoms up his legs.
Draco hums. He lightly tosses the one he's reading on top of the pile. "It just feels strange. Like they were written by somebody else. Not me."
except Harry's heart has unexplainably started to kick up a storm at the thought of saying this at all.
Luna receives letters from Draco as well. He doesn't tell her anything about his whereabouts, either. He writes to her every few weeks to tell her he misses her and thinks of her, and how he is doing, asking after her. More than anything, his letters consist of detailed responses to whatever Luna writes to him, not much of himself. It's a careful and deliberate sort of avoidance. She shows Harry all his letters, and besides Narcissa, she is his only other connection to Draco now.
"Oh." Harry said, and then snorted, and then maybe sort of kind of giggled at the whole new context of the situation.
He conjured a Patronus. His mind felt foggy and slow. He had to try a bit harder to feel a memory with Draco, and then his stag came out, flew through a wall. When he turned, Dudley was standing in the doorway, having come back from washing his hands in the loo across the corridor.
"Keep your hands off of me," Draco hissed through clenched teeth, eyes red-rimmed. "I don't need anything from you."
Draco smiled, thin and wry. "Made fun of your dead parents. I didn't realise how much that could hurt… until I had a dead parent that everybody made fun of." He stared Harry in the eyes. His own looked so tired, sunken, and it hurt. Softly, "I'm sorry."
After Quidditch practice, he's always there at the alcove with dinner and desserts for Harry, and sometimes he does things like reach out and wipe away a smidge of food on the corner of Harry's mouth, or pick an eyelash off from under his eye, or fix up Harry's hair with a run of his hands through the front of it.
"I'm sorry," he says. His voice comes out low, strained, and he feels like he can never be sorry enough for what had happened to her at the hands of his family. "For what Bellatrix and my father did to you."
Harry, on the other hand, didn't sleep all through the night, holding Draco tightly as the thought about what had almost happened kept him awake. He would have chosen to walk away too soon, to return back to his Gryffindor dorms and sleep in contentment through the night, unaware and ignorant that that day and night was the last time he would have ever seen the boy that he had at some point fallen in love with already. He would have woken up the next day to learn that Draco—
"That it is extremely rare," she says. "That it is of love at its core. Moreover, it is of longing. Hence the cure, the tears of those you crave love of."
"So, for Merlin's sake, could you at least try to keep your damned wits about you this time? Just for one night?"
Harry frowned at the odd question. Coming from Malfoy, at least, it certainly was. What did he care about that?
What would happen after a year? Would Draco still want him, if he learned of everything Harry had kept hidden from him?
Weekends are always spent at a pub with Ron and Hermione, but there are times they are joined by Draco, Luna and Neville as well if they ever end up there at the same time, and Harry likes those sort of weekends. Draco usually watches their interactions from a small distance, commenting or adding a quip every now and then to something being said, fiddled slightly with his drink and smirked at Harry's jokes. He doesn't talk a lot with Harry while everybody's around, doesn't talk a lot in general among others.
That's what I called to tell you, kid. This cursebreaker knows how to alter bonds. He says he can bring yours and Malfoy's down to a quarter of its life. Five years, but no less."
Harry didn't know what to do. He could only understand his silence for what it meant. Maybe some part of him had been hoping that the things Draco had done, that were so muddled by their unique predicament, were some of his own wanting. Like when they were dancing, Draco's fingers at his hairline, his brow. Like when he'd asked Harry for a kiss, told him he was good-looking.
Then they morphed into Molly, always trying to pile food onto his plates, and Ron and Hermione adding a spoonful of pudding, a sausage, a muffin to his plate, through Eighth Year, and he thought of Draco, this morning, wrapping up breakfast and lunch for him, the dinner under stasis left on the kitchen table these nights.
Pansy stares at him, her neat brows pinched. "Okay," she says, after a while. "Okay, I won't. But I need to ask you if he had something to do with what happened—"
"Ah, I see." Draco said, stepping back from her, gestured towards the kitchen. "Join us for breakfast then."
"Sorry," Potter says, laughing awkwardly. "I didn't realise you guys were still doing wandless magic."
This time, Harry forced himself to let go of Draco instead of trying to cast Patronuses that he knew would take forever, and tried to call Healer Francine instead. Only, she wasn't answering, so he called Ron and Hermione, not knowing who else to call, and on Hermione's demand, he gathered him up in his arms and took him right to St. Mungos.
He thought of standing in a forest, and the flash of a green light heading his way. How his consciousness had been consumed into nothing, not unlike sleeping. He didn't remember any pain at all.
Narcissa eyed him for a bit, and then smiled, though it didn't quite reach her red-rimmed eyes. Harry didn't know what came over him in that moment, perhaps encouraged by the softening of her face, but he held his hand out for her, slightly tentative. He'd expected, in that second of surprised stillness for her to reject it, but then she gave a small laugh, still a bit thick and watery, as she placed her palm into the upturn of his own. Harry smiled too, eyes crinkling, bowed down and kissed the back of her hand. She smiled back.
They left when it was nearing nightfall. Andromeda did not insist for dinner, because by now everybody had the unspoken understanding that they couldn't stay long anywhere. Harry didn't know what came over him, only felt that he didn't want to go back home, but he looked to Draco outside the door as they were moving down the stairs together, said, "let's go out somewhere."
"Will you come to watch the game?" Harry asks. They'll be up against Slytherins today, which he hopes will be of some interest to Draco. He never shows up for any of the games anymore, and Harry wants to see him there.
"I do," Draco tells him, because he thinks it should ease some of the tension between Potter's brows. He does, with Luna, and with Madam Aileen, but it's terrifying, realising them into words said aloud. Inside his chest, they can be tucked away undisturbed into the hollow, the empty, the distance in his mind from those memories.
, was what Harry had mindlessly answered with, the last time Draco asked him what he was painting. He'd forgotten, found it strange to remember having said something like that to him. That Draco remembered that, too.
Narcissa meets him at the fireplace the morning after. Harry hugs her, and when she lets him go, he's hardly missing a heartbeat as he asks, "Where is he?"
"You did it to save us," Ron said, in a low voice. "You can't blame yourself for wanting to be free."
"Matty! You shouldn't say that—" Annie is admonishing at the same time, frowning. "Look, you're making Scorp and Mr. Malfoy very upset!"
In the silence, in which the man at the piano sang on to fill it, Draco looked much too solemn, his mouth small, a faint line between his brows. He seemed very lost in the haze of his thoughts, gaze distant over Harry's shoulder. They were moving in the small steps of a dance, feet a little unsteady and out of sync sometimes, when they swayed and ended up leaning a little too much into each other.
Potter laughs at that, a low, stilted sound. "Okay." He shifts his cheek against Draco's ribs, tilting his gaze up at him. "And then what happened? In your dream?"
As pertaining to the way they were here, not a lot changes as the first day goes. They arrange to see each other at their usual alcove on the third floor for breakfast, but are a little shy of each other, still trying to work out how to go about again after the shift between them last night.
"Well, for the record, I know your work is really fascinating," Harry says, almost blurting it out. "I know the stuff you've done, like... the contributions you made to making lycanthropic transitions painless and all these other — what you do makes the world a better place and that matters a lot, and I think..." He fades off there again, and he puffs out a hard, frustrated breath, and of all things, Harry’s next words are the last thing Draco would have expected him to say. "Look, I like you."
Draco remembers it only in a distant way, the way it felt, like phantoms. Mostly, it's only at an intellectual level that he can speak of it, can only remember the thoughts he thought if he tries hard enough.
Draco was not prepared for the way he'd felt seeing him go quiet instead. For the strange twist of his own heart at seeing him stand up to his feet, gather his things, and then slip away.
didn't make fun of mine either. Shut up and let me finish," Draco said, pushing a soapy, foamy hand at his shoulder, then back again in his hair. "I hated it because it was unfair, how good you looked with that mess of a bird's nest atop your head. The fact that you wouldn't even bother combing it! And then there were
He goes to dinner with his heart racing that night. Ron leaves right as he sees him there, which leaves him sunken inside.
I nod and we head back through the maze of halls. When we arrive I see that the cleansing chamber is a giant room with a shit ton of ruins. The ritual itself didn't take all that long and didn't seem like much but by the end I felt much better and could finally get my head wrapped around my friends and Dumbledore being not who they say they are. After a quick trip back to Gonduk's office I left Gringotts with a bag connected to my vaults, a list of properties and where they are, and a lot more knowledge.
"No, any type of magic block without consent is illegal for how dangerous it is, magical blocks bind a person's magic and make the person much more susceptible to danger. We can perform a cleaning and remove all long term potions, spells, and blocks."
But no sooner than it started it was over. It felt like something inside me had finally been released and it felt amazing. I felt strong and healthy. I didn't feel starving or the sting of the whip marks from earlier. As I set up I realized how clear everything was. I could see everything even though it was dark and I didn't have my glasses.
I pull my wings against my back and try to will them away. It works almost instantly, and for a second it feels like it was all a dream but as soon as I will them back they're there. I walk to the door and before I even touch it the door shoots open. At this point with the weirdness of tonight I'm not all that surprised. I sneak down to the cupboard under the stairs and like the one before it opens without me touching it.
As soon as I walked in I saw Draco Malfoy and Serverus Snape. Fuck. I can do this. I need to make allies before I start changing things. I tap Malfoy on the shoulder. I am so glad we're the only ones in this shop
A hush fell over the hall and Dumbledore stood up About to say something when the sorting hat interrupted.
Everything hurts. Merlin it feels like every bone in my body is broken. My organs are being shredded. My soul pulled from my body and thrown back in. It hurts It hurts It hurts It hurts It hurts It hurts It hurts It hurts It hurts It hurts It hurts It hurts It hurts It hurts!
"Gonduk is the keeper of the Potter vaults so he will take care of the test" the goblin explained as who I guess is Gonduk came up. He lead me through a very complicated system of halls and into an office. He pulls out a dagger with what looks like ruins on the blade.
"Yes master Potter" I had given up trying to get her to call me Harry a while ago, she was very stubborn.
We head down to the common rooms. Everyone gathers around the main fire place and the prefects start talking.
"As some of you know Slytherins are not well liked by the other houses, this means that outside of this comonroom we are a united front. If you have an argument or disagreement you keep it in the common room. As always if you are under 3rd year you must be with someone else when traveling through the halls. The health checks will be a different time for each year, the times will be posted on the board by the door along with the new password every week. If you have any questions ask a perfect or our head of house. and most important, Don't get caught." She finished as Snape walked in cape billowing behind him in a way that I'm almost certain is magic.
It is a form of dark magic that allows the user to control and with enough practice travel through shadows.
The two months in the manor passed quickly. I did a lot of reading and practicing in that time and I've learned so much. I can do simple spells wandless and wordlessly and second and third year spells I can do wordlessly. I've learned a lot about politics and history. I even found an original copy of the rules and regulations for Hogwarts, and I have a full proof plan to move to Slytherin. I also grew out my hair which grows surprisingly fast that combined with the muscles and proper wardrobe, I don't look anything like I used to.
One night, fairly drunk together again in front of the fireplace, Harry said, "Will you play the violins? I'm always showing you my paintings, but you've never shown me your violin — your violin playing — "
"Yeah," Harry said, shrugging, putting his hands into his trouser pockets. "Let's go out, have a drink or something. I don't know about you, but we've been cooped up too long at the house with… everything, you know. I don't feel like going back right now."
He feels the weight of Draco's head, settling against his shoulder. Harry shifts his cheek onto his hair, the two of them with their faces lowered towards their hands. He will never fully understand what it's like to have reality lose all colour in its most literal sense, to need something that doesn't exist, or to have lived an entire life of warped time, but he has seen enough of the way it has hurt Draco.
Hermione's brows are knitted with concern. "Oh, Harry, you haven't been feeling left out around us, have you?"
"Because I want to, Potter. Now switch." Malfoy rounded over, pushed Harry to the other side by his back towards the other chair, and sat down as he tugged the chair out.
Draco lifts his head from his shoulder and quickly takes his face, makes him look at his own, intently. "Because of
It was a slow one, the kiss. Mouths parting hot and slick into it, closing together. And there was nothing there that wasn't Harry himself, the knot of magic at his core and content, as if it had realised it was no longer needed, gathered itself, and quietly slipped away.
himself, that Harry could have walked away and not known until the next morning just what he had walked away from, that he needed to talk Draco out of it and that he didn't know if he would be enough.
They laid there like that, in the dark. Harry, lying on his side, a palm tucked under his cheek, the artificial comfort passing between their hands like the sway of the sea. Harry was thinking, vaguely, of not being able to breathe, fear tight in his throat, and Draco's voice, whispering,
Potter comes right in the middle of Draco's lessons with Luna, smiling in a chagrined way when he notices he's disrupted them.
"So, nothing," Draco said, quietly. He cleared his throat, shifted to let him take his robes off his back.  "It was — was just strange to hear. That's all."
"The entire Wizarding World adores you, in case you've forgotten," is what Draco says. It doesn't sound mocking. Just matter-of-factly.
I'm sorry for stringing you all along with this fic so much 🙈 but in my defense, this is all extremely complicated
The rest of it was rather uneventful. More talking. More drinking. Some food. Then they were all dancing in the centre of the great hall, all slow and formal and fancy. Harry had a dance with Narcissa, where she engaged him with polite small talk, smiled at him a lot as she spoke, charming and warm in a way he'd never seen her as in his school years. He was asking after her, telling her of what Draco had told him with all the gaps, and then had finally gotten the proper story which wasn't so far off from what he'd gathered.
"He was also hosting charity galas, apparently," Hermione said, going back to reading through the papers again.
Draco slowly settles down on the chair once he's forced his mind blank and decides to write a response letter to his mother. Her last owl had been yesterday, asking him of his well-being, of his classes, sending him homemade desserts. She'd asked about Potter as well, as she did in every letter.
"I kept telling you the opposite of what I felt, trying to protect myself. You couldn't have known. It's not either of our faults."
Harry wasn't sure why he'd still been keeping an eye on his ex-nemesis, really. It wasn't even as if he thought Malfoy was up to something wicked anymore. While not someone he would ever trust with a blade behind his back any time soon, he didn't think Malfoy was capable of anything evil anymore. Not after everything. Harry had seen the way he cried in the bathroom to Myrtle, terrified as he told her Voldemort would kill him and his family if he didn't do what he demanded of him, showing his reluctance towards committing the horrible deed so very clearly. Malfoy had refused to identify he and his friends at the Manor, and in return, Harry had saved his life twice, once at the Fiendfyre and then during the Battle from a Death-Eater, and spoken up in his favour at his trial.
Harry's face breaks into a grin. "Yep. That was me. Under my Invisibility cloak, throwing snowballs at you."
"I—" Harry says, voice fading. It's a low rasp, his throat dry. "I think I like you a little too much."
Harry clenched his jaw. He lifted his head and stared Malfoy flatly in the eyes. "Bill. His name's Bill." Malfoy only shrugged, uncaring. "Do I need to remind you of how he became one in the first place?"
Sometimes in particularly private places, Draco will kiss him and kiss him, and settle over his lap as he does, with his hands around his jaw, the nape of his neck, half in his hair. They don't do much beyond kissing, and tugging up the tails of each other's school shirts and push their hands up under them, to splay them over the heated skin of each other's bodies, and Harry is very much fine with that. But he thinks about it a lot. He thinks about a lot of things a lot when he's alone, when it comes to Draco. He thinks about a lot
It is a strangely fortunate coincidence that they reach out to him, get in touch with him, not long after what has occurred. They tell him to come to Cardiff, and he goes, because they are another corner of familiarity in a world that's grown a stranger to him, and there is nowhere else he has anyway.
Where once Harry's life was silent of him, now everything sings of him. All the little things Harry used to miss about Draco, they become a part of his days, fit into his life effortlessly. They just are; his kisses and the way he touched him, the ease and comfort and joy of being with him, his favourite sweets that Draco buys and leaves for Harry on the counter under stasis, and the notes in every corner of the house, on his side table greeting him
He didn't know where it was all really coming from, or if he entirely understood what the cryptic words even meant. They almost sounded like they were coming from someone else.
"I know," Potter says, quietly. This time, when he looks at Draco, he does so fully. His face seems to grow years older with the words. "Draco, I know."
Harry gets angry at a lot of things. He can't lie that some bad days, he gets angry at her too, for telling him that, for not letting them be in their blissful ignorance. Draco would never have left then, maybe, if he wasn't so scared of what Harry learned, of what he knew now, and Harry would never have days where he got doubtful and sad that it wasn't really him that Draco wanted.
"Why you awake?" Harry mumbles, slumber-thick and running together. It's still dark outside, near the beginning of dawn.
He cannot bring himself to say any of it, jaw working, chin quivering. His face contorts painfully, but the tears don't come beyond a sting in his eyes. He feels hollow and overwhelmed all at once, his breaths unsteady and growing higher and heavier into something louder, bordering on gasps. Panic and despair washes down on him, threatens to take him away somewhere else in his mind.
"We'll work something out, Harry," Hermione said, softly. "This isn't a marriage. Not in any real sense. This is just… a temporary solution. We'll find
Harry held the gaze for a moment. He then sighed and sat back down. Malfoy's chest heaved slightly, in some hushed relief.
Ron began his Auror trials, eventually. Hermione went into her Unspeakable training around the same time.
He went through the corridor and into the living room, found Draco stirring awake on the couch, at the sound of the door opening and shut. The light was on and the book had slipped out of his hands, the front flat onto his own belly, and when his bleary eyes landed on Harry, he smiled, all tired and in his lavender night robes.
Harry understood. Draco hadn't wanted him either, and it had made all the sense in the world back then, but now it only hurt to hear aloud.
"Do you know how the potion works? The one that Malfoy was given?" Hermione asks him, the next day, in the fall of a silence. They're sitting in the library, where she was tutoring him on Transfiguration theories five minutes ago, and then gave him some questions to practice on.
Harry waited for him to finish his sentence, raising an eyebrow. Malfoy didn't finish his sentence, instead seemed to be staring at Harry as if he was waiting for
"Ah, but see." Potter inclines forward and down, hands wrapped around the broom, to lean his face close to his, a smile setting his face alight in the day. "The game isn't over just yet. Wish me good luck?"
It was a while after, with the two of them in silence, and Harry eying him, that he finally said, "We should go somewhere. Do something."
After that was a trip to Honeydukes for some sweets, some Butterbeers at Leaky Cauldron, and then a Quidditch match between the Holyhead Harpies and the Wimbourne Wasps.
There are a lot of things Draco thinks he could be saying rather than a tepid, "Preferable to Celestina Warbeck, I should say."
"Yes, honey, I'm here. I came home as soon as your dad told me you showed up here. What are you doing home, huh? Did you just miss me too much?"
"Well, apparently he did write to tell us what happened, but I'd rather hear it from you first. Who do I need to have a word with?"
Harry sighed. "Please just tell me what's going on, okay? I'm getting really worried out here and also, my knees are starting to hurt. I'm not as young as you anymore."
And, as for the Gryffindors," he felt his husband raise his eyebrows slightly in amusement, "I would say they just don't know any better because they might be brave but they're not all the brightest, but to be honest with you, they have grown up idolising your dad, and when he married a Slytherin and both of his children ended up in houses that weren't Gryffindor, they probably just felt a little robbed of what they felt was their right to a part of the Chosen One's private life as well as his legacy."
Harry shoved an elbow into his husband's ribs. "That is not the right thing to be focussing on right now!" He hissed, but Scorpius' eyes had already brightened and he looked a little less sad.
"For being in Ravenclaw, I presume," Draco replied, very familiar with the way the minds of young Slytherins worked.
"Anyway, they didn't believe me and they kind of just started crowding in on me and then the Gryffindors arrived and they were agreeing with the Slytherins about how you were a weird couple and that just creeped me out even more, but I also knew that I was right and you know I can't just give in if someone else is wrong, so I just…" He averted his eyes, looking sheepish and so much like a mixture of both his parents in the way that he kept his chin high bravely but also sniffed proudly, as if the tears on his cheeks were offending him, that Harry felt his chest squeeze tightly the way it always did when he realised how much of a family he and Draco had built for themselves, even though neither of them had grown up in a very loving home.
Scorpius rolled his eyes in a show of being annoyed at his father for pointing out his age, but his parents both saw the way he curled in on himself. "They told me I was a traitor," he said quietly.
Draco exhaled a long breath. Then he took his son's hand and said, "listen to me carefully. While your dad and I both know what it's like to be bullied or harassed at Hogwarts, only I know what it's like to be the one to do the bullying." Both Harry and Scorpius looked ready to protest, always defending Draco, even to himself.
"But over the last few days, the Slytherins used to come up to me and they were really mean. They wouldn't let me do my homework in peace, and that's just rude! I could've put up with some annoying jokes in the halls or at meals, but my homework time is just one step too far."
Draco furrowed his brows, not liking the way his son seemed to think it was alright for people to make fun of him in passing. "Well, what did they say that made you decide to drop out of school at eleven?"
Draco tilted his head. "You remembered the whole way home just by looking out the window the first time going to Hogwarts a few weeks ago?"
"Oh, don't you look so smug, you know I love you," his husband replied, pulling him in with a hand on the back of his head and kissing him the cheek.
Draco gave Scorpius another hug and whispered into his ear, "You made me very proud today, son. You defended yourself with words and wit because you knew you were in the right, and still you didn't stoop to their level. Oh, and just so you know, I really am right where I belong. I'm glad you remembered that."
Harry scowled a little. He hated it when Draco referred to him as the Chosen One. He'd never liked that title, and although newspapers like the Daily Prophet had lost sight of him for a while, they'd been all over him the moment they'd found out that Draco and him had had children.
Draco rolled his eyes, but yanked Harry into a kiss so hard his laughter stopped and he had to grip Draco's robes to steady himself. "Darling, I think you know exactly where you belong."
"NO!" An angry voice shouted from inside the room, but Harry could hear the sniffles his son was trying to hide.
"Father?" Scorpius said quietly, obviously trying to sound even, but his voice was small and choked up.
Suddenly, the front door slammed closed and Draco appeared in the hallway, long robes billowing behind him. Harry looked up at his husband gratefully, gesturing to the door silently. Draco nodded and knocked on the door, two loud knocks and a silent one. A special signal that he and Scorpius had come up with when Scorpius became old enough to want privacy. This one meant that whatever Scorpius was doing, Draco needed him for something. It was only used in emergencies.
"Scorpius, honey, it's me," Draco said, voice soft and calm. Harry wondered how he did it. Whatever situation his husband was in, he was always elegant and put together. He never lost his temper like Albus did, or got frustrated like Harry did.
"Well, they weren't First years. They were at least in fifth year, maybe even older. And they all looked down at me and told me that their parents had told them that you were just confused about your values because you wouldn't be with dad otherwise, but I know you love each other, so I told them that you weren't confused, you were right were you belonged, because you told me that last year and I always listen to what you say, at least when it's important-"
Scorpius coughed, his cheeks blushing. "I told them that if they were so worried about Slytherins and Gryffindors fraternising they should maybe think about the fact that they were doing just that by ganging up on me." Somehow, he managed to raise his small head even higher. "And then they realised that I was right but since they obviously aren't the brightest of people, they just got angrier at me for pointing out their missing logic instead of yelling at each other."
Now, they might have gotten over me marrying your dad because most of their parents know what it felt like to be enslaved or terrified by the Dark Lord, and are grateful to him for saving them and giving them their freedom back. But their children have never known the fear that we grew up with, so they take their freedom for granted and fall back into the old rivalries. None of this has anything to do with you.
Scorpius smiled, but then he gave a great sigh that sounded much too exhausted for someone as small as him, and then he just plopped down onto the floor, his parents taking a seat in front of him, unconsciously leaning into each other.
"No, but not for lack of trying. A few of them cast stinging hexes at me, and something a little harsher that I didn't recognise, but Dad told me how to cast a Shield Charm, so I did that and just escaped by squeezing through their middle and they were too busy yelling at each other to follow me, and then I broke into Albus' dorm because he doesn't put any sort of Privacy Spells on his things, and I took his broom and flew home."
Scorpius looked up at him, his eyes frightened, "why, did Albus tell you that? Did he write to you?" He sounded horrified. Harry shook his head, but, as if on cue, a bushy brown owl came flying in through the window and dropped a letter in Harry's hand. Scorpius screeched and tried to grab it, but Harry gave it to Draco as if out of instinct, who simply held it out of his son's reach.
Slowly, the door opened a little. Red rimmed green eyes looked up at the two men, and Scorpius sniffed again. "No, I didn't, I'm not a baby," he said, and somehow managed to look down his nose at his parents. Draco reached out a hand and smoothed Scorpius' messy blond hair out of his face. "Of course you're not, love. But what's going on, hm? It's the middle of September, you're supposed to be in school."
Draco and Harry shared a look that only parents shared, slightly bemused but also incredibly proud of their son.
"Scorpius, please open the door," Harry said, his shoulders slumped and voice tired. He'd been sitting in front of his son's door for almost an hour, trying to get him to let him in.
"I answered a lot of questions on the train, I think it's my turn. Have any of you gotten a creature inheritance?"
I look him in his eyes, I really hope I don't regret this, "I Harrison James Potter swear on my magic that I want to start over and be friends with Draco Malfoy for no reason that will purposely cause harm to him or his family."
I lost track of time flying through the chamber and playing with the fire. At some point I realized I was getting tired not physically flying and controlling the fire didn't seem to take any work. But I checked the time and sure enough it was almost midnight. I wanted to do a few more tests so I extinguished the fire and called for lilly.
I walked up to where the sorting hat was. Professor McGonagall walked up and nodded as she put the hat on my head.
I shut the door, and introduced myself. "Greetings I'm Lord Potter-Black-Pervil-Ravenclaw-Slythrin, but you can call me Harry."
Snape seemingly unbothered by this event speaks up "I believe this is a talk between you and Mr Potter so I believe I will take my leave." He says and floos away.
"You better fill me in tomorrow" pansy remarks before going up to catch up with some other Slytherins.
Only start shadow travel once the person has mastered shadow control. Have them cover themselves in shadow and then have them try to bring themselves to another shadow with the shadows. It may be difficult at first but once you get the feel for it will be much easier.
"You're new to Slytherin so when we say what's said in here stays in here, we mean it" one of them said and they all nod before going up the stair cases to what I assume are the dorms.
I took the night bus to the closest one seeing as it's now 5 in the morning and I have a lot to process.this residents happened to be the Slytherin manner that had been kept up by charms and house elves but apparently no one had lived in it in ages.
I turned to the floo before turning my head back to him "oh and officially you should calle Lord Potter-black-pervil-ravenclaw-slythrin" I stepped through floo before he could respond.
Thankfully Gringotts was open despite it being about 3 in the morning. I walk into the practically empty lobby, and walk up to the first goblin.
"We can perform the cleans as soon as you claim your Lordships." Gonduk pulls out several boxes with the family crests on the top.
The magic swirls around me and sets in place while Draco looks at me like I'm crazy. Though given what I just did I might be.
I don't know why I still cry. It doesn't do anything. It just wastes energy if anything. But here I am again curled up on my floor naked crying and covered in blood. It crosses my mind that tomorrow is my birthday. Not that it matters. Ever since Dumbledore informed the dursleys that Sirius was… gone, they've been so much worse then they ever were before. "Punishment" from Vernon, impossibly long lists of chores from petunia, and as much Harry hunting as Dudley could manage. At this rate I don't think I'll make it to 6th year. I pull myself up and put on an old shirt before crawling into bed.I fell asleep sometime later.
An hour later and some fitful sleep we get to the leaky caldron. I walk through the almost empty pub and thankfully I'm not noticed and I make my way to Gringotts.
"Of course right this way master" she gestures and shows me through a few hallways and into a room that I had been in early but I didn't know what it was seeing as it was a giant room completely made out of stone with nothing in it despite all the other rooms being fully furnished.
I walked in and it just felt right, for some reason. And without thinking about it I walked up into the master bedroom. A few minutes later I was asleep.
I walked down the aisle looking for Draco. I'm near the back of the train when I finally find the compartment he's in. He's also sitting with 3 other Slytherins, Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, and Theodore Nott. I open the door.
"I'm not sure but I can pull down records and find out, we can have that information owled to you within a few days"
Any type of Phoenix inheritance is widely considered one of the strongest inheritances a human can have, but is also the most painful and considered to be far worse than any other pain.
This is an elemental power but unlike the other elements The person possessing this will be able to not only control fire but they will be able to make it out of nothing.
To start, have the person stand or kneel in front of a shadow and try to grab the darkness. Once they can hold shadows with little to no difficulty have them practice moving them by hand. Have light sources nearby so that they learn to do it wherever. After this stage have them move the shadows by will alone.
Once they are in a secure location light a candle and set it down, and get out of range because it most likely will get huge. Once they have control of the fire let them play with it and get the hang of it depending on the person they wouldn't need the candle for much longer. They will be able to create flames out of nothing.
It turns out the information in the book was very accurate from what I could test. And fire is very easy to control after the first time.
"Please prick your finger on the blade over the parchment," he says placing the paper in front of me. I do as instructed and as soon as my blood hits the paper it starts to swirl into words.
The difficulty of shadow magic will range depending on the type of inheritance you have. The more powerful the easier time you will have. Shadow magic isn't dangerous to the user or nonliving items but it can be harmful to living creatures if not controlled properly.
I pull my wand and something to where out of my suitcase quickly changing and shrinking everything I need down and slipping into my pocket. As I leave I focus on keeping the door closed and unlike before I open it normally. I walk away from the dursleys hell and make a pact to myself never to go back. As soon as I get to the park I call the night bus. A few minutes later we're on the way to the leaky caldron.
I close the stone doors and double check nothing could be burned. Then set the match down and lit it. For a second nothing changed but then he felt something in his chest like a fire calling out to him. A second later the flame grew taller than me. I acted purely off instinct and soon I was literally playing with the fire. Letting my wings out I soared through the sky. The fire was like another limb. I thought and it acted, it was beautiful.
"I'll make a magic oath right now to prove that I actually want to start over and be friends for no reason that will cause you or your family harm"
I do as instructed with the Potter ring. I slip it on and a warmth passes over me. I continue on and as each ring accepts me they mold together into one ring with a crest that is a mix of all five houses.
"Silence everyone," Dumbledore starts, "if Hogwarts wants Mr Potter somewhere else he shall go there." I can tell he says it through grit teeth.
Magical inheritance: shadow magic, fire control-, and self healing come in during inheritance. Though the healing is immediate and will happen uncontrollably. The shadow magic and fire control must be learned [instructions on how to start learning on page 473] the learning will come natural and will mostly consist of learning how to use it not how to do it.
The Slytherin manner is huge. I spent most of the day in the library and meeting the house elves, the head and my personal elf I found out was named lilly. The library had what seemed like everything about everything. I found a few books on Lordships and inheritances as well as one specifically on different types of creatures and what their blood does to the inheritance.
'hello to you too I've finally found the truth and I would like to go to Slytherin where I will flourish'
As the other Slytherins and I got into the carts pulled by what I think are theasterals, I prepared what I needed to do to make this work.
I had wings. Giant fucking wings. Moving them was like moving any other part of my body; it just happened. I brought them in front of my body and ran my hand across it. The feathers were velvety soft and as black as my hair at first glance but hidden in the feathers were bits of silver. I stood and immediately almost fell over due to the wings after regaining my footing I went to the window and found it looked to be about midnight. I have to leave this hell.
"Heir Malfoy, I would like to formally apologize for my actions towards you in the past; they were misguided and biased. I would like to start over" I place my hand in front of him to shake.
Finally we pulled up to Hogwarts and I felt her open her arms to me. This was going to work. I fell to the back of the line and let the others go in front.
Magical core: the person will be born with a very strong core as well as enhanced sight that is found in most flying type inheritance
"A lot has happened in the past couple days. I got my inheritance, and I've found out alot. Trust me we will have plenty of time to talk at Hogwarts but I have a lot of stuff to do before then so I'll see you there."
Physical attributes: opon inheritance the person will grow wings with a span of approximately 3x their height. Along with this they will grow lean muscles for protection and to hold themselves up with the heavy wings. These feathered wings are colored in submissives mostly the color of the hair and bits of the feathers will be the color of the mate's hair. Their body wings and hair will be completely fireproof.
Learning how is easy but it is very common for them to over do it so it is important to have them in a dueling chamber or something of a similar fashion.
But something felt weird, not bad just really off. Feathers brushed my back. I turned around surprised since I had let Hedwig with the twins-
After 30 minutes in Madam Malkims I had my orders placed and enough clothes to last me at least a year. I head down to pick up potion supplies and some more books because ever since I had the mental block cleared I wanted to know everything so I was never in the dark again.
"I know," Scorpius said, and his lower lip began to wobble slightly. "But I don't want to go to Hogwarts anymore. Maybe Beauxbatons will take me!" Draco frowned. "You've been nagging my ear off all summer about how much you were looking forward to Hogwarts, and Albus has been excited for you to spend more time together as well, even if he'd never tell you that himself."
