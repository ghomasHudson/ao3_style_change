Harry leapt over the piles of other rejected clothing to answer it before it rang off, only to result in a rather breathless ‘Hello?’
Harry closed his eyes and smiled at the voice.
‘Yeah I have to admit, Mione, this is a new level of bullshit, even from you,’ Harry agreed, unable to hide the complete and utter
‘Riiiight,’ Ron draws out the word, ‘and then after you’d had your coffee you thought you’d come mingle with the common folk?’ Harry knows he’s being teased but hey, he’s in a good mood, he’s got a date, he’ll indulge him.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair and reached down to scratch the back of his neck, his classic move for when he was feeling nervous or uncomfortable, or when Hermione asked him why he hadn’t finished his homework yet. Of course, she hadn’t needed to ask him
‘It helps that you seem to be blushing on command, too. Did you know you were doing that?’

‘Good. Well. I suppose you’ll be wanting my rota?’
‘If, after four years of actual marriage, you do not know to buy Hermione surprise bouquets or boxes of chocolates, that’s on you Weasel.’
“Home”, he supposed, was a bit of a vague description of a house he had only lived in a few months, his mother having moved there as soon as Draco and his father were both given their respective sentences. It was a small end of terrace thing, about an eighth of the size that the manor had been, but there had been no option of returning to live in the shell that had been the Malfoy ancestral home.
They were still getting closer and closer.
Draco rolled his eyes at Eddie, making his way to sit at the stool behind the front desk of the parlour. Eddie grinned at him and jumped down from the stool.
Malfoy still eyed him with mistrust, but let the subject go. Or, he would have let it go, if Harry wasn’t one to act upon every single, tiny, little, annoying Gryffindor impulse.
Harry, we were fifteen when we decided that! Surely you got enough dark wizard action with old Voldy to last you a lifetime? I know I have!’ He took a big gulp of his butterbeer. ‘Or I supposed it’s two lifetimes in your case, what with the whole he killed you and you came back to life to kill him thing?’
, remaining unsaid between them.
, and Draco was currently piling them, along with a tonne of flashcards, onto the table around their drinks.
‘Well it wouldn’t take much to fool someone as simple as you now would it?’
Taking a deep breath, Draco made his way up the steps and raised his hand to the knocker on the door. He gave three short, sharp raps at the door, and what could only be described as a screaming giggle came in response. Draco would deny his terror at that sound until his dying day.
A wince. ‘That’s none of your business.’
Sighing to himself, with yet another one of the ministry’s dirt coffees in his hand as he made his way to his office, Harry resigned himself to yet another horribly uncomfortable hour of just him and Malfoy and Malfoy’s annoying new habit of flirting
and not
‘Everyone has a chapter they don’t read out loud, Potter. My chapter is the last five years.’ Draco interrupted, praying to every god he could think of that might be sparing a glance his way at that very moment.
‘Hah. Yes. I suppose I was.’ Blushing. That was… new. And weird.
Well shit. Sunday. He was well and truly screwed.
Harry sighed to himself. It seemed like Malfoy had been late for every single meeting they’d had. Scratch that, he
‘Er, sorry, Mione says I always ramble when I’m nervous… what do you think?’
‘No- nothing! Just you saying goodbye. That’s it. I promise.’ Harry held his hands up in front of him in a mock surrender.
What the sodding Minister was doing slumming it down in the DMLE for, Harry had no clue. Nor was he going to ask. Nope. No siree.
‘Right. Well, thanks anyway. And I don’t know what else P said to you but I guess you know who he is now?’ Potter nodded. ‘Right, so yeah. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t try and get to the bottom of all my trauma yourself. That’s what I don’t pay P for. And, not to be rude,’ he waggled a finger between them, gesturing to them both, ‘but you and I? We’re not friends.’
Potter looked just as stunned as Draco had felt in giving a reply without snark or biting comment. Draco wasn’t entirely sure what had come over him; he couldn’t recall ever speaking to Potter with anything other than malice, or complete disinterest in his parole meetings.
, or anything worse, ‘I’m here for my appointment.’

‘Just go to sleep, Draco. You’d better hope Mister Potter doesn’t hold anything against you.’ Narcissa pinched the bridge of her nose, no doubt to get rid of the headache Draco had given her. To be fair to her, he’d be doing the same if he had to deal with himself right now. ‘Although I supposed we’ll see on Sunday.’
Hermione finished her mini rant with a flourish and plopped back down into her seat, unaware that her impassioned speech had caused her to stand. Ron and Harry just sat there in silence, staring at her. They knew well enough that Mione on a mission was certainly not one to go up against, but since she became a firm fixture in the office of the Minister of Magic she’d become even more formidable.
Ron’s voice echoed around the Room of Requirement as it burned, but Harry couldn’t just leave them there when there was room on his broom. Two hours later, he’d saved the rest of the Wizarding World, too. Harry Potter, the Saviour.
‘Mate.
It also had a great deal of music (if one could even call those heinous sounds “music”) which baby Edward had absolutely

In fact, Harry was too busy grumbling to himself that he failed to notice the rather stately looking witch that had taken up residence in his office who was currently sprinkling a selection of muggle toys around the floor for an energetic young toddler to pounce upon.
‘Malfoy?’
His eyes flicked up to Draco again and Harry inwardly cursed Draco for having been looking at him at precisely that moment. Stupid handsome git. Stupid handsome git that needed gently persuading (read: shoving) into professional help. Stupid handsome git that had kissed Harry and made him feel all sorts of confusing feelings that he really,
But Draco couldn’t find it in himself to deny them.
Almost ten minutes late, Malfoy sauntered into the office.
‘Leave it, we’ve got you plenty over here!’ Ron’s bellows came again, slicing through the entire establishment. It was a miracle that Madame Rosmerta still allowed the group of them through the door, what with Ron, Dean and Seamus’ foghorn voices attempting to break the sound barrier every time they met up for drinks.
help? I got three years. Every other death eater got a life sentence. Your ego can rest easy.’
Shaking his head but now smiling to himself, Harry opened the door to meet his charge, only for the smile to drop at the sight of hair that was too platinum blond, posture that was too rigid to be anything but the result of a pureblood upbringing.
‘Oh, Mione,’ Harry began, ‘I just wanted to say, those flowers in front of your window smell amazing,’
a comment or kudos is always appreciated xox
‘Oh, well.’ Harry’s cheeks flushed again. ‘I guess I just have a good memory when it comes to you.’
Atrocious glasses and hair fit for a bird’s nest? Draco hadn’t spent six years at Hogwarts with a fierce rivalry to simply
Harry’s mouth dropped open in shock. ‘You want… me? A godfather?’
‘Oh hardly, don’t be such a drama queen!’ They were laughing together now, Harry felt sick.
‘H-hey, come in!’ Harry cleared his throat and prayed that Draco hadn’t noticed the crack in it.
someone out there for you, and that they might be closer than you think.’
It was a small window, looking out onto a small back garden, but there had been so many hours, so many days and weeks and months, that his mother had spent, painstakingly filling it with beautiful flowers and intoxicating smells to bring some semblance of joy to their tiny end of terrace house in the middle of muggle suburbia. It had made Draco almost unbearably happy to hear of its progress with each visit his mother had made to Azkaban over the years, and he won’t deny having been moved to tears when he finally got to lay eyes on it upon his release.
He supposed the blond man could be Sam at a push; their first date had gone well, almost too well in fact, despite how atrociously Harry had behaved, as had the three dates since then. But Harry couldn’t help the paranoia from sneaking in, the constant questioning that had led him to avoid a love life for so long in the first place, of people wanting to be with
‘Cormac McLaggan and Moira Thorpe? It’s nothing really, Potter. Do you have that counter jinx?’
to look at. Then the tendrils thrust themselves into the ink itself and Harry hissed at the shock of it. Still pulsing as the magic took effect, the stag began to stomp its front hooves and shake out its antlers, before taking a few tentative steps along his wrist bone. He was sure he’d never forget the sight of this, the feeling of the new ink on his wrist being imbued with magic, for the rest of his days.
‘I suppose it’s too late to show you the right sor-’

As if he had been hit with a stinging hex, Draco leapt up from his seat. Shooting Potter the most aggrieved glare he could possibly muster, Draco spun around on his heels and marched out of the room, not caring a second for Potter’s feeble calls to stay for the remaining few minutes of their meeting. As fucking if.
The most perfect looking oat milk mocha edged its way into his eyeline and Harry looked up at another one of the reasons that
Draco blinked. Potter had managed to say all that in about five seconds flat. ‘Well. that sure was a lot of information to take in that quickly. My condolences, although he sounds like a twat. But why a new coffee shop?’
Harry tried desperately not to panic, glancing around to see if anyone had spotted his predicament. He glanced across Draco’s head to Seamus, who’d been sat on the other side of him. Seamus felt Harry’s gaze and turned to him, but when Seamus saw the situation Harry found himself in, he grinned and winked at him.
‘Is that all?’ Draco asked, ‘can I go?’

to make it awkward?’
‘Sounds good to me, H.’ Draco wandered out of the entrance and into the main room. He looked around the room, obviously spotting the dimmed lights and candles giving the room an obscenely romantic glow. Turning around slowly, Harry saw that Draco’s expression was now serious, and his eyes as wide as dinner plates.
‘Harry, you’d better not be shagging any more of my siblings out there!’ Ron shouted out at them, not daring to come out fully and risk scarring his eyeballs again, just in case.
the days Harry would be too busy to remember lunch, but brought some for him anyway and forced him to eat it with a small kiss to the top of his head.
‘Mate, did we crash your date?’
‘You can’t say that and then join in, Ronald,’ Hermione chastised, but there was no malice in her voice and Harry could feel her smile through the masses of her hair.
‘… it blew up in his face and now George has been walking around the shop missing an eyebrow for a week. Scaring half the customers away.’
Potter chuckled and went to get two glasses. He didn’t even rise to the Weasel comment, Draco saw that as a loss.
Draco mused,
. Harry’s old worst enemy out in full force.
Harry had been pacing and stewing for just under twenty-four hours now. Twenty-two hours and thirty seven minutes to be precise. Twenty-two hours and thirty seven minutes since Malfoy had kissed him and stormed almost immediately out of his flat.
‘What? Of course, dear, in fact this is the best I’ve felt in years!’ She stood up and started pacing around the room, ‘my little dragon, a second chance! Saved by Harry once again!’

‘But Potter, you and I both know that you

had an inkling, based entirely on the inferno that seemed to take over his face each time Draco shifted next to him or hooked a leg over Harry’s or leant over and whispered in his ear. Of course Harry had noticed he was blushing. The only thing he couldn’t figure out was why he was blushing over

‘I don’t think you’re gay. We think you’re more like bisexual- maybe pan? It doesn’t really matter. But you should see the way you look at him, Harry. It’s the same way I look at Ron, or Dean looks at Seamus. Mrs Weasley looks at Mr Weasley! Surely you must’ve noticed the way that you’re constantly aware of him when he’s in the room. The way that you gravitate towards him. The way that you seek his approval with everything that you say. For Godric’s sake, the way you reacted when you heard about the Diagon attack - just because the shop he works in is on Diagon Alley! Like a man possessed, Ron said.’

look at before tucking it away in a box inside his mind, labelled “Do not approach unless with a large stick and three bottles of fire whiskey”.
‘My parole officer is Harry Potter, mother.’
Sure Malfoy had caught him completely by surprise with the sudden kiss, and his shock had meant that perhaps he hadn’t reacted in the best way, but Malfoy had gone from eyes filled with lust to eyes filled with rage and Harry couldn’t quite figure out what he’d done so wrong.
‘He told me he’s in love with me, Mione.’
‘Just, er, letting you know it wasn’t a date,’ Harry trailed off, he didn’t think he had
What the hell had happened? Had there been someone abusing their power over him? Someone
Draco became a common sight to see around the Auror department, often with pastries or lunch, and always with coffee and a chaste kiss to the top of Harry’s head, so it was only fair that Harry become a common sight to see around Slug & Jiggers around Draco’s lunch breaks. Harry hadn’t quite worked out how to kiss the top of Draco’s head without breaking one of Draco’s very strict rules about their fake-lationship, though, and figured that boxes of his favourite chocolates and sweets might make up for it for now.
? What kind of question was that, Draco wondered. Did Potter mean today specifically? In the past week? Since their kiss? During Azkaban? During the war? He was going to have to narrow it down a bit. But still, proper pureblood protocol was still deeply embedded into his reactions to social interactions, and he replied with an equally cordial - if not, slightly strained - ‘I’ve been perfectly well, thank you, Potter.’
when making the booking, and made sure to say Harry’s name extra loudly when he spoke to him.
‘Spare me from having to listen to your boring heterosexual drivel for yet another night, Weasley!’ Draco drawled back, winking at Hermione and dodging a shove from a very wobbly Ron.

, and Harry had gone in for the kill. He was lucky, really, that Myrtle had screamed bloody murder (and she’d have been right on that count) and Snape had heard her. Harry had never felt so sorry for his worst enemy.
‘Whatever. Has your employment changed?’
‘You were so happy and at home, and I wanted that. I wanted it for you and I wanted to be a part of it. It wasn’t until I realised that, that I realised I’d been in love with you for months. I’d always known I was gay, and I know I never told you, but it was safer for me - for my heart - to never tell you, and never have to give you up.’
It was following yet another of these games that Harry found himself back at the Burrow for a celebration afterwards, cradling a butterbeer and surrounded by a sea of redheads and freckles and raucous laughter.
‘Right Harry, I have to ask, ‘Mione’ll kill me if I don’t, you know she’d be here if McGonagall didn’t have her helping the firsties, hates it when she misses your visits, you never visit enough she says, anyway she wanted me to talk to you see? Get a feel of how you’re doing, and -’
Although down a set of stairs and into what felt like a basement, the room felt light and airy. The walls were a bright white and light streamed in from the faux windows there; Potter must have bribed the Ministry to tell him their window spell, as the scene showed a garden not unlike Draco’s own at his mother’s house in Kensington. The kitchen cabinets were a pale grey and the light wood of the worktops perfectly matched the light wood of the same reclaimed floorboards as in the hallway.

to make it awkward?’
But it turns out, Draco opening up, even just a little, was enough for all of Harry’s common sense and willpower to disappear.
When Harry was twenty five, four months, and seventeen days old, he opened his heart to his old worst enemy turned best friend, and stopped thinking in such childish nonsense as

Hermione was laughing at him. Wide-mouth, eyes squeezed shut, laughing at him. ‘Harry, love, I know what you think you believe, but we’ve all been waiting for
‘Don’t sit down, Malfoy. Our meeting won’t be in the ministry today.’ Harry was already marching out of the office door before Malfoy had even finished walking through it.
Any friend would do it, right?
Harry’s heart fell. ‘Right.’
‘N- No,’ the words stumbled out of Draco, ‘I’ll come to your flat. And thank you, Potter. I don’t think I thanked you properly for what you did that day, and since. Not many people would give a damn about death eater scum being on the bad end of a hex or jinx, but I guess that’s what makes you so different from everyone else.'
Like that would ever make him feel any better. It just dumped a load of guilt on him like an icy bucket of water.
Some potential personal discomfort and occasional nightmare triggers were to be expected, right? Completely normal… Right?
‘The usual?’ Sam was already bustling about with shots of espresso, chocolate, and steaming up some milk.
‘Really?’ Her eyebrows raised higher.
think you’re off the hook about this whole kissing thing,’ She  brandished a wagging finger at him, but the whole effect was ruined by her giving a huge yawn. ‘I think it’s time for us to go, Ron, I’m falling asleep on my feet here.’

‘World, bet you just love all this attention don’t you Potter?’
‘Oh I’m sorry, forgive me for trying to not make this more awkward than it has to be.’
‘You think- wha- wonders? Ha… Potter? I mean- erm… alright, mother.’
Yep, not a chance.

The pair of them sat in an uncomfortable silence for a few moments.
So yeah, Harry wanted to curse Andi for suggesting that they come to
The film started and everyone around him seemed to be enjoying it, enthralled by the action on-screen, but Harry couldn’t even tell you the name of the film, let alone what was happening in it. All he could concentrate on was the feeling of Draco’s arm pressed up against his in the way they were sitting, and the occasional bump of his knee against Harry’s as he shuffled around. It was nothing, really, but it was the most distracting thing in the world.

‘Look, mate, just because you started making your way through all of our siblings, I won’t have it be said that we’re not supportive of who you date’
thank fuck, I’ve been going mad here.’
As if Harry had struck him with a stinging hex, Draco leapt up from his seat. He shot Harry another look of pure hatred which Harry valiantly tried (and failed) not to visibly cower under, spun around on his heels and marched out of the room.
‘Mother. Tea?’
, he supposed - had thankfully stopped the intense staring into what felt like Draco’s soul and was now fixed on the stag on his wrist. Draco couldn’t help but smile at the sight, Potter hadn’t even noticed that he’d finished the inking process.
In the four years Malfoy had been imprisoned, Harry had only made the trip out to the North Sea once. And even then, it was only as part of an Auror-training field trip; Harry had absolutely no desire to see the faces of all those Voldemort supporters - marked and unmarked - that he’d helped put away in those couple of months after the war. He especially hadn’t intended to catch a glimpse of Malfoy through the bars of his cell as he walked past.  It was only thanks to Kingsley's influence that he had been permitted to use Polyjuice potion as a disguise as he walked around, so as to not rile up the Death Eaters and whatnot, that Malfoy hadn’t glimpsed him back.
to Draco’s birthday party after what had happened, and what had been revealed through the conversation they had had there. Harry’s mind had been going over and over what could have possibly happened to Draco that was something unable to be healed by skele-gro or chocolate frogs and, short of some kind of mental abuse, he was coming up blank.
‘Right. Here you go.’ He handed over the coins. ‘Thanks… Eddie, was it? See you Friday Malfoy.’ Potter gave a small smile at Draco before turning to leave.
‘You should count yourself lucky, Potter. Not many tattoo artists give their customers out of office visits to check up on the healing of their ink.’ Draco looked up at the auror sharply, ‘have you been using the cream twice a day?’
‘Har har,’ Draco deadpanned. ‘I think it was actually you using me, the poor, scary Death Eater, to frighten away all of your quivering fans.’
The left forearm was also the place Voldemort had chosen for his Dark Mark, so Harry tattooing himself with images of the ones he loved seemed like one last “

dragon-taming Weasley brother. Then, Harry supposed, there was the upcoming date with Sam to contend with.
But Draco never got to finish whatever he had been about to say, as his flatmate Seamus bounded up to them and latched himself around Harry’s shoulders, closely followed by another flatmate, Dean.
‘Has your living situation changed?’
‘Again, Potter, I’ll say: eloquent as always.’ Malfoy smirked.
Harry dodged around some whispering fans yet again, cursing how far away Diagon’s designated apparition point was from the majority of the shops, it’s like the alley was trying to force him to be mobbed by reporters and fans. In fact, Harry was
Patch was smirking at him. He was an average height, just about five foot nine, with wavy brown hair, sharp blue eyes, and the warmest olive skin Draco had ever seen. He was, by all means, an incredible average looking man in terms of looks, but to Draco Malfoy he was nothing short of a Greek God. Or an Irish God. A God nonetheless.
‘Draco, hey! Draco!’ Harry pushed through the crowds of people, doing his best not to spill what was left of his pint or anyone else’s drinks as he arrived by Draco’s side. ‘You made it.’
Usually Draco would be revelling in the chance to not speak a word during these forsaken meetings, but the deathly silence from Potter was sucking all the fun out of it. He was like a dementor for Draco’s fun specifically. A Draco’s-fun dementor.
‘This is
Not even half a second after almost falling flat on his face after a decidedly ungraceful exit from the floo gate, Harry was being heckled by a rowdy table towards the back of the pub. Looking over, he spotted his friends taking up the entire back row of the newly refurbished Three Broomsticks, a sight that was becoming somewhat of a familiar sight for their regular Friday night pub nights.
‘So. erm. How’s your week been?’
Harry raked his hands through his hair and down his face. He was definitely going to have a headache in the morning, his tolerance had been shot to bits the second he'd joined the auror academy and helped take care of Teddy so a couple of fire whiskeys were more than enough to get him these days. How could he have been so stupid to even
An uncomfortable pit had settled into Harry’s stomach at the thought of seeing Malfoy so broken and vulnerable. It unsettled him. In the decade they’d known each other, Malfoy had never appeared anything less than perfectly put together, completely in control of how he presented himself to the rest of the world. Harry’s visit to Azkaban prison was something he had tried very hard to obliviate, without magic, from his memory.

If Draco had had a drink, he’d have spat it out. ‘Come with? Y- you want me to join you?’ He had almost completely resigned himself to having to sneak out the front door like he was doing a pathetic walk of shame.

the things around him. This was not enjoyable.
‘Guests? I thought I was your “arsehole parole officer”?’
‘I’ll see you next week then, Potter, owl me the address.’ Draco nodded, and left as quickly as his upbringing would allow without flat-out running. He completely missed Potter’s worried look following him out of the door, and the small way that Potter smiled to himself at the thought that Draco would be
‘I know you did, but I’ve already said there are plenty who see you that way. You just need to know where to look.’ Charlie smiled at him, as if he knew something Harry didn’t, but that was nothing new to him, and Harry was well aware he was generally an oblivious person.
‘Piss off, Malfoy. I got you a biryani, sit down and let me ask my questions.’
Harry felt even more terrified now, as if they could look directly into his chest and see the gymnastics that his heart
Taking out his mobile, Draco immediately set about swapping his Monday shift with the girl Ivy’s for the following afternoon. Oh yes, if Harry Potter was getting a tattoo at
‘Listen… Sam. I wanted to ask you something,’ Harry began, sitting forwards in his seat.
‘Harry, hey!’ Draco walked into the flat, brandishing a bottle of wine at Harry.
Harry hated him. Wanted to hate him
‘What?’
He needed someone with the same fire as Ginny, though. Someone who could push his buttons and widen his boundaries and catapult him right out of his comfort zone (which had become unbelievably small in the years since the war). He needed someone who knew his past, who knew each and every secret in his life, and loved him in spite of it all. He needed someone who knew he made mistakes, and who had made mistakes themselves, but who worked with him to make amends and strive for a better life.
‘Well as you can see, Potter,’ he gestured to the wizard sitting in front of him, ‘I am otherwise engaged. So,
An Irish voice broke Harry out of his reverie; it sounded suspiciously like Seamus but Harry knew that he was off travelling somewhere in South-East Asia with Dean, so it couldn’t possibly be him. Looking up to meet the voice, Harry was fixed in place by the bluest eyes he thought he’d ever seen. Even Dumbledore’s couldn’t have held a candle to these ones.

‘Well there you go. What do you say, stay?’
, Harry could hear Malfoy’s condescending tones loud and clear in his mind. Great, even his own head was against him.
But anyway, it wasn’t like Draco had any friends left to invite in the first place: they’d all made themselves scarce before the Wizengamot had even finished reading out his sentence.
Draco picked it up and read, his eyes narrowing as they darted left and right.
Right under his nose? Maybe someone who went through the war with him? Although that ruled out almost the whole of his year and the year below, except for Malfoy of course since he’d been in Azkaban, as everyone had paired off pretty soon after the end of the war and rushed into marriage with their childhood sweethearts. It was a huge relief that he hadn’t done the same with Ginny, they would have truly made each other miserable before they reached their first anniversary, let alone for the rest of their lives.
‘Nah, he was just crazy.’ Harry took a sip of his drink and looked up at the other man. ‘Sorry, I don’t mean to be rude, but who are you?’
Harry looked over at Charlie in the dusk. He could see his eyes shining too; everything was feeling soft and nostalgic in the early evening, helped along by the numerous butterbeers and fire whiskeys everyone had been supplied with all afternoon. Harry opened his mouth to speak, but the sudden, harsh yellow light of the open back door interrupted him.
Harry was up and moving the second he’d seen Ron’s head, but at the words “Diagon Alley”, it was like he’d been hit with a
‘It’s not sex, it’s a date’ Ron states, leaning back onto his heels matter-of-fact in his assessment. After so many years joined at the hip, Ron and Harry had developed a pretty accurate way of reading each other so completely without a single word. It pissed Hermione off to no end, but it was the closest Harry had ever felt to being a true Legilimens without ever actually attempting any proper training after the farce that had been lessons with Snape in his fifth year. Harry respected the man, after what he had seen of his memories during the Battle of Hogwarts, but Severus Snape should never have pretended to be an Occlumency teacher (Ron even favoured the theory that Snape had been

forgotten about until her mentioning it, and he’d been in their bloody house for a bloody birthday party just a few days before.
And if Draco cried himself to sleep feeling so thoroughly rejected by his best friend and love of his life, well, Harry couldn’t hear it over the sound of his own thoughts whirring away through the night.
Setting his teacup down onto the kitchen table, he thought back to the mornings he had spent outside, sat at the small bistro table his mother had set up on the terrace, drinking countless cups of tea with his mother and Patch - if he got a day off - and eating the various pastries he brought over to sate his sweet tooth.
not being quite so straight-as-a-ruler as previously thought. Again. Draco grimaced, surely the whiskey hadn’t made him forget so spectacularly. ‘Seems you are perfect after all.’
!’ and ‘
Walking backward and away from Harry, Draco’s attention was already on anything but Harry. ‘Alright, well I’m just going to say hi to Pansy and Blaise and I’ll come find you in a bit for that drink, yeah? And we can do some karaoke!’
‘No.’
Oh, who was he kidding, with Malfoy’s speedy exit stage left, even Harry “oblivious” Potter knew he’d definitely fucked up here.
Malfoy cleared his throat. ‘So, what’s with the stag?’
the memory from his mind and never think of Draco again.
What Draco was saying finally registered in Harry’s mind. ‘Move out? Why would I want you to do that?’
‘Right. Well. Good.’ Harry looks down to read the papers he has in front of him in an effort to not seem entirely like the idiot he knows he sounds like, but he doesn’t miss the slight twitch in the corners of Draco’s mouth.
‘No no, not at all, my dear,’ Andromeda chuckled warmly at him, ‘I’m sorry to do this to you so last minute, but I seem to have gotten myself an emergency that I cannot possibly rearrange. Would you be an absolute dear and watch Teddy for me for a few hours?’
‘Bloody posh prat, bet you’ve never-’
Draco was well used to his mother’s eccentricities by the age of twenty-one, but having not been around them whilst he had been
‘Good.’ Draco affirmed. He reached over to his side table for a cloth and wiped away the excess ink coming from Potter’s wrist.
He’d had strong words with Kingsley and Robards about what had happened with Cormac McLaggan and Moira Thorpe last week, which thankfully they’d been just as outraged by, but it had still taken a full week to convince them to let Harry have his parole meetings outside of the ministry. Harry’s not saying he pulled the “Saviour of the Wizarding World” card for the first time in his career, but he also didn’t
But Potter was too busy having a crazed look in his eyes. Draco could almost hear the gears turning in his head; Potter was coming up with a plan and Draco wasn’t exactly sure he was going to like what it was.
‘Not crying, Potter. Malfoy’s do not
happy 2021!!!!
‘Well which is it? Are you just queasy or do you not want to be here?’
‘He bloody what?!’
Harry gave a big groan of frustration, big enough to draw even mum-and-dad-to-be out of their bubble of happiness.
Harry was getting really sick and tired of these mis-dates with Draco now. He’d tried no less than five times now, all with devastating failure and general awkwardness, as the boy he was in love with remained entirely oblivious to his attempts at wooing.
‘How am I supposed to act normal tomorrow?’
Straightening back up and looking at Potter, Draco caught a thoroughly confusing expression on his face, that one could only describe as strangled; the man looked as though he’d been hit with a rather kinky choking charm and Draco wasn’t sure if he felt aroused or sickened. Either way, the butterflies that seemed to have moved into his stomach permanently took it as an opportunity to flutter up again.
‘Oh please, as if you had much choice anyway. You and I both know that my mother most likely threatened to have your bollocks if you didn’t show your face.’
, Draco apparated into an alleyway just a few houses down from the address that Potter had owled over to him earlier in the week. Seeing a number eight to his right and nine to his left, Draco headed to the left, keeping an eye on the house numbers.

for them both.
‘It was… who?’ Potter was raging. Draco didn’t think he’d ever seen those green eyes look quite so angry, even in all their years of tormenting each other at Hogwarts. Draco half wanted to take notes on how to rile Potter up like this again, and half wanted to melt into a puddle knowing Potter was angry as a direct result of something happening to
Draco felt a light push to his chest and his eyes snapped open. Potter was laughing at him. He’d teased him and pushed him away.
sexy.
.’ Harry smirked, if Malfoy was going to play it that way, Harry wasn’t above sinking to the same level.
‘What?’
Harry could only suspect a late night studying in the library, but their different courses meant they couldn’t study together most of the time. Draco had been yawning profusely before they’d even sat down in the cinema, and for the first half of the film he had been leaning more and more into Harry’s side. It hadn’t taken long before Harry’s resolve had broken and he’d whispered over to Draco to just rest his head on his shoulder.
But the excitement and passion that Malfoy felt for the process, the fire Harry could see behind his grey eyes, he couldn’t help but feel almost
confundus
Choosing to ignore the fact that Potter’s magical tattoo had just charged at him and chased him away, Draco instead turned his attention back to his young cousin. He made all the appropriate noises when Edward informed him of his creations with his building blocks, and the current storylines his toy figures were currently being forced to act out.
Even Harry had to admit that Ron was right here, and he’d learnt early on to
Wordlessly, Potter handed over the parchment and his quill, and made his way over to a nearby bench to sit and stare into his lap. Draco sat on the same bench, but as far away as he could physically be without falling off.
‘Because he’s out of Azkaban?’
‘Thanks, Harry. I’ll get the next lot, I promise,’ Draco said, picking up his mug of mocha.
When Harry was eighteen years and one month old, his worst enemy was the wizarding world that he’d given his life to save.
The pair of them sat in an uncomfortable silence for a few moments.
‘Are you allowed to just sit down and join your favourite customers like this?’ Harry asked incredulously, a smile in his voice.
‘Harry James Potter. Do not lie to me.’
But Andi just smiled, her eyes sparkling with mischief at him.
Four months into their “relationship” and Harry, personally, couldn’t have been happier. Even Draco didn’t have many complaints, despite his initial refusal to go along with the scheme.
Draco was almost whispering by the time he’d reached the end of his confession; if Harry hadn’t been so focused, he might’ve missed it.
Robards was looking at him closely, with the distinct focus of someone trying to determine whether there was food in the teeth of whoever they were looking at. As if he could see directly into Harry’s thoughts and seem them spiralling away from him. He didn’t seem convinced.
‘ENOUGH,’ Harry roared. He took a deep breath and tried desperately to collect himself; Hermione was always laying into him for not getting his temper under control, she’d given him exercises for it and everything. So he tried to step away from the fight, and remind himself that him and Draco were adults now, twenty one years old with a whole lifetime’s worth of life experience already under their belts. They weren’t fourteen-year-olds fighting in the middle of a Hogwarts courtyard anymore. ‘Now, if you could stop being such a git, I’d like to get on with these bloody questions.’
Potter looked down at a wrist watch. ‘We’ve still got half an hour, I’m not supposed to let you leave before we’ve had the full time. So I guess we’ll just sit here and enjoy each other’s company?’
“His own stuff” was, decidedly,
Ron rolled his eyes and chucked at his wife, ‘I mean, we knew he was a bit oblivious but this takes the cake.’
Harry winced and felt his face flush with pink. He knew he’d promised Patch to start calling Draco
‘No way, Draco Malfoy!’
‘Hmm. I think I remember? It’s all very vague. Not that memorable at all if I’m honest,’ Harry drifted off.
down, that he absolutely should not want Malfoy like this.
He must have run his hands through his hair a total of twenty times before Draco broke the silence.
Harry wanted to hex Andromeda for suggesting this place.
With a crack, Harry landed back in his living room at Grimmauld Place.
Potter’s eyes flicked up at him at that, full of an emotion Draco didn’t have time to deal with today. If there was one thing he couldn’t stand, it was any kind of
first meeting. It was presumably the fact that Draco had made his way through four other parole officers before landing in Potter’s office that his employment information had simply failed to follow him. Even still, the tattoo parlour was honest enough work, and he’d been there long enough now that Eddie was beginning to trust him with the gun on customers. Draco had always had an affinity for art, Merlin knows he had had enough evidence of that in his studio at the Manor before the Ministry had seized the place, so a couple of months practise on fake skin and Eddie had been happy enough for him to get on with some small designs on paying customers.

what Harry had wanted to do, unless “his own stuff” included having an actual date with the gorgeous person in front of him. Was that really too much to ask? Was he just terrible at the art of asking people (Draco) out?
‘Who’s “P”?’
Almost immediately, Harry could feel a tingle on this wrist where the ink was. White tendrils of magic drifted out of the end of Malfoy’s wand and snaked their way around his wrist, making Harry gasp at the pulses of sensation given out each time they touched the ink. Harry was enthralled, he’d never seen something so purely
Flirting?
Malfoy had given him an equally pained expression.
Walking up the back path now, Draco could see how his mother had fallen in love with the quaintness of the place; the tiny rooms, the soft corners and gentle furnishings, the huge windows at the back of the house, letting in more light than could have ever been seen in the manor. It was Narcissa Black to a tee.
‘Woah woah woah, attraction? Who said
‘Nope. No no no no. I’m gonna stop you right there. If this has anything to do with the, er,

upon attending, and the grief and the mourning and all the rest of it), and he’d only got a letter of recommendation from the Minister of Magic because it was Kingsley.
‘… Right?’
But as happy as Harry was, he couldn’t quite shake the feeling of jealousy when he looked at his two best friends wrapped back up in each other and their baby bubble. How lucky they had been to fall in love with their best friend, to fit together so well, to understand what the other was thinking and dreaming before they even did themselves.
‘Oh. Right.’ Harry winced. ‘Erm, well… he invited me to this party he’s having? For his birthday.’
"motus atramento" literally means "ink movement" in Latin so it seemed like a good place to start w/ making up spells, and that tattoo aftercare is true! I looked it up! it's paraphrased ever so slightly but the gist is there
‘Alright, darling!’ Came the reply from the drawing room.
He cringed inwardly and tried not to let it show on his face, but Sam’s expression faded from anxious into one of confusion. Taking a deep breath, Harry tried again at half the speed.
Okay, maybe he was just being overly sensitive on the last one - he couldn’t
Double checking for karaoke nights at every pub in the city, Harry managed to find an evening where none of them had
‘Hm, I’ll make sure to let Luke know next time I see him.’ Harry sat back in his seat, letting the warmth of the mocha seep into his fingers.
Great, Harry would never hear the end of this now.

‘Let me finish, Harry. The reason I never wanted to be your
Potter nodded along with what Draco said, but by the way Potter didn’t take his eyes back off the stag on his wrist, he wasn’t too sure a single word he’d said had been heard. Draco stood up, chuckling softly to himself as he left the room to get the supplies. Of course, most wix reacted that way to their first magical tattoo, but Draco hadn’t expected Potter’s eyes to be quite so shiny, quite so green. It was a bit disarming but not altogether an unwelcome feeling.
Harry’s eyes flicked up at him at that. He had known, of course, that the only person Draco would have any notions of seeing would have been his father, and that there was no chance of Draco ever wanting to see his father again, but still. He had to ask. It was on his list.

to remind them both of at every available opportunity. He’d be loath to find out he’d missed one here.

‘What do you mean you don’t read it out loud?’
‘A date? On a school night? Very unlike you to break the rules, I must say.’ Malfoy was frowning too, but in an angry, disapproving sort of way. ‘Although, with the amount of witches after the

And I'm not an auror, or you wouldn’t be sitting here would you?’ Harry moved around Malfoy to the chair behind his desk, sitting down himself. ‘Now, I know you’re you and I’m me but for the sake of getting you through your parole period could we please try and be somewhat civil? Or professional? At the very least not hating each other’s guts?’
There was no kissing allowed unless initiated by Draco, and only then was it to be on the cheek or the top of the head - it was one of the many rules Draco had set to feel even moderately comfortable with it all. Harry hadn’t minded, but seeing Draco all loose-limbed and glowing under the pub lights was doing strange things to Harry’s inhibitions, and he knew if they’d been alone on the dancefloor, anything could’ve happened. Draco was his

‘I’ve been perfectly well, thank you, Potter.’
‘Well. Great. Good for you, Potter. If that’s all you needed then I guess I should… go?’
‘Piss off, you know what I meant. Anyway, this was just supposed to be a quick meeting; you meeting your parole officer, me meeting my parolee… Merlin knows what Robards was thinking, pairing us together. I guess we just figure out a schedule for now and try not to kill each other for the fiftieth time this decade.’
Potter at least had the good sense to wince at that one, ‘Sorry.’
away or else he might start having flashbacks and panic attacks and he wasn’t about to go ruining the hardened criminal reputation he’d been trying to build up around Potter for the past four months.
The County Arms, Ron and Hermione’s local, was a quaint looking muggle pub tucked away in the depths of their burrow in Notting Hill. In fact, it was so tucked away that Harry was sure most of Notting Hill didn’t even know that it was there. It was small and cosy, and had twinkling lights strung up around the ceiling year-round which gave it a decidedly christmassy feel even in the highest heats of summer, and it wasn’t known to anyone else in the wizarding world other than the three people currently sat in one of the squishy corner booths.
‘Have you been contacted in any way by any known or unknown Death Eaters?’
Draco couldn’t help but smile. ‘Right well I’ll leave you to it for a few minutes for the charms to settle in with the ink and your own magic, and I’ll get the protective film to wrap it up and a cream for you to use whilst it heals.’
At the sound of his name Harry’s eyes snapped back up.
‘Harry… was this a date?’
‘A monumentally bad idea, I know,’ Draco sighed, ‘but it’s for my birthday and she’s insisting that I invite you.’
‘But you are for Draco?’
‘Inviting me back to yours already, sweetheart?’
‘Hah, yeah, but I don’t think I’ll ever get over the sheer
St Mungo’s had branched out in the years following the war, taking inspiration from Muggle ambulances and coming up with a whole new mobile team of Healers that could apparate to a location where the injured party was too fragile to apparate themselves or use a port key. Say what you will about wizarding transportation, but it wasn’t the most smooth of a journey no matter which you picked. So, seeing Draco in the middle of four lime green Healer robes just about sent Harry careening to the floor.
He had stewed and worried and felt magnificently sorry for himself all of Saturday and all of Sunday morning, after he had stormed out of number twelve Grimmauld Place on Friday evening. Now, he was a mere half an hour away from the time guests would supposedly begin arriving for this Merlin-forsaken birthday party, and the threat that he might be coming face to face with Potter much sooner than he’d like.
‘Hey!’
‘You leave half an hour early?’ Harry was confused. ‘How are you still ten minutes late then?’
He was just thinking that he should probably put away some of the books scattered across his desk before Malfoy arrived and called him a heathen, when a sharp knock sounded at his door.
‘I was, erm, babysitting. If you must know. My godson.’
‘Thanks for suggesting this, I hardly even remember mentioning this film to you.’
‘Holy
‘Oh, to share. Most
‘Do you treat all your paying customers like this? I can take my business elsewhere,’ Harry glared back and made to leave. Fortunately for them both, the man who was obviously the owner or manager or whoever had the misfortune of being in charge of Malfoy burst into the room to stop Harry from leaving.
Patch just grinned at him, knowing full well the thoughts going on in Draco’s head. ‘C’mon birthday boy, let’s go greet your guests.’
Potter seemed to be taken aback. ‘It’s, er, private.’ he said, blinking at Draco.
‘Oh, right. Yeah. I'll follow you.’
‘Are we done? I have a shift starting in a couple of hours.’
‘I don’t buy my veg with anyone.’ Harry sulked. The

Perhaps he’s not as impervious to my charms as he’s been claiming.

‘Harry? Please say something. This is why I never wanted to go along with your stupid fake “relationship” plan. But, instead, I was selfish, wanting to pretend like it was as real for you as it was for me. I never should’ve given in so easily.’ Tears were falling down Draco’s face. ‘I understand if you want nothing more to do with me. If you want me to move out.’
‘That’s the one.’

He knew that a date and a knot in your stomach usually meant butterflies and giddiness and excitement, but he couldn’t help himself from feeling uncomfortable with it; like the knot was telling him something else entirely.
Harry wasn’t sure what was happening the first time Draco had turned up in the DMLE with a coffee and a toasted three cheese sandwich from his favourite café, until Draco pressed a small kiss to the top of his head, gave a half shrug, and simply said ‘I knew you’d forget lunch.’
‘Yes, dear. Do keep up.’
? Like he never called you m- er… that word! You hated him too! Punched him in the face!'
‘You could say that again.’ Tentative hands reached up to hold onto Harry’s arms. Looking up, he saw hurt and confusion and openness and… hope? in Draco’s eyes.
‘Are you finished?’ Sam broke Harry out of his thoughts.
he was not in the mood to be nice and polite to the ex-bloody-convict he’d been saddled with, when really all he wanted was a coffee or a nap or maybe both. Maybe a shot of firewhiskey whilst you’re at it. Sighing, Harry knew that only one of those things was accessible
‘Thanks, Harry, they’re narcissus,’ she smiled at him.
It took a moment for Potter’s words to sink in, we’ll blame the firewhiskey for that, but once they did…
‘It’s nothing,’ he lied.
‘Somehow I find that hard to believe.’

’ Ron shouted the last two words, causing at least five people in the shop to turn around and glare at them. Harry even saw one mother put her hands over the ears of her son (but he was looking at the WWW brand fireworks, so Harry wasn’t too sure what she was hoping to achieve by protecting her son from Ron’s shouting when he clearly had his sights set on much louder noises).
‘Really, Potter. Why am I here suffering through this infernal meeting if you won’t even dignify me with your undivided attention? I had been trying to answer your question regarding employment, but you seemed to doze off. Is the subject of my employ so boring to you? You’d think the ministry would be most interested to know the jobs of their Death Eaters, no? Honestly it’s like you expected me to fail. Well, I’m sorry to disappoint you so, but I've been working there a few weeks now. Did my first tattoo yesterday.’
Harry removed Sam’s hand from his arm and turned to Luke, the barista behind the bar who had dropped the hint that Sam had liked him in the first place, and grimaced at him.
‘The Famous Harry Potter. Popped out any weasels with the Weaselette yet?’

‘Hermione… you knew about this didn’t you?’ Harry wasn’t an almost-fully-trained auror for nothing, and he could definitely spot her being a bit shifty.
‘I wouldn’t come any closer if I were you, Charlie. You remember what happened last time you snuck up behind me like that.’
Malfoy had obviously been out of Azkaban long enough to recover from the starvation diet and malnutrition, if anything, Harry would say that Malfoy had even developed a bit of a pouch. Not that that was a bad thing of course, after so long with his stomach concaving inwards from lack of food, it was nice to see someone post-Azkaban with the faint curve of a healthy, full belly. The pointed angles that had been so quintessentially Malfoy back at school had softened as a result, too, but still looked like they could cut if you brushed along them. The luminous silver of his hair was blonder, dirtier, polluted with strands of gold. He no longer looked like a direct clone of his father, and
‘A toast. To my two wonderful, glorious, fantastic,
‘Ill? Are you alright?’
‘Don’t do that. Don’t act familiar.’
‘I don’t recall you complaining last time.’
‘What’s all this?’ Harry asked.
‘Okay. No meeting today - sorry - but I’ve got something I need to do. I’m going to sort this out, Malfoy, I promise you!’ Potter was almost skipping as he left his office, bouncing along the halls of the ministry with enough energy to kill ten Dark Lords. Draco didn’t know where he stored it all.
‘Has your living situation changed?’
‘I am a guard, but I’m also a licensed psychiatrist.
he shouldn’t have been having these thoughts. It was completely the fire whiskey’s fault.
Only as he spoke, houses number eleven and thirteen seemed to shake and stretch, the muggles inside them remaining utterly oblivious. When the buildings eventually stopped shaking, Draco blinked and shook his head. There, right in front of where he was standing, where previously there had been nothing, was now another house with a neat, golden
Harry gave it, and paid, and Draco went off to get them both a table.
He gave a short, sharp bark of laughter and took another large sip of his drink. Ron just looked at him over the booth table, one hand still holding onto his own seemingly forgotten pint, and gave a small sigh.
‘So how was the honeymoon?’
only knew what had got Potter down enough to make him look like someone had just died but-
Draco couldn’t wait for it all to be over.
Draco reached one hand up to cup Harry’s cheek, and Harry drew in a sharp breath at the sudden intimacy. The two boys moved together, holding each other in their arms, before closing the remaining gap between their lips.
Harry sighed and shook his head. ‘No, I’m sorry. Two lattes and a hot chocolate, please.’
Potter put Edward down into a small playpen and moved to the small breakfast table under one of the faux windows, where he sat down in one of the seats and gestured for Draco to take the other.
Upon seeing Draco, however, the wide grin stilted and shrank, his eyes lost their sparkle, and there was no way Draco could lie to himself and pretend anymore that it didn’t hurt.
The door was flung open and a beaming Potter greeted him; his mouth stretched open in a wide grin showing off all his pearly whites, bright green eyes that seemed to sparkle from the mirth held within them, and the characteristic dark-brown-almost-black unruly curls that topped his head. Then there was the clothes. A pair of pale grey jogging trousers donned his legs, rolled over a couple of times at the hip to make them shorter, and a simple black henley with the long sleeves rolled up to his elbows to showcase his stag and a new-looking large black dog (which Potter must’ve snuck back to the parlour to get without him noticing, the bastard), and his utterly

you, Harry,’ Hermione interrupted yet again.
He took a deep breath before his next question. ‘Have you been contacted in any way by any known or unknown Death Eaters?’
He could feel his cheeks flushing as Ron and Hermione continued to look at him in shock.
Harry checked his watch. ‘We’ve still got half an hour, I’m not supposed to let you leave before we’ve had the full time. So I guess we’ll just sit here and enjoy each other’s company?’
… yes, that would be lovely. Harry.’ Sam cast his eyes downwards to his coffee and Harry caught the tiny half-smile in the corner of his mouth again.
trying to wingman him - that his new favourite barista, Sam, had requested the morning shifts specifically to slip Harry an extra breakfast pastry if he came in.
‘You know why, Ron, I want to do my bit.’
Hermione scoffed incredulously at that, whilst Harry tried not to piss himself from laughing too hard, but Ron brought out a picture of one green-skinned, one-eyebrowed George Weasley and beer came out his nose.
‘Oh I’m sorry, forgive me for trying to not make this more awkward than it has to be.’
, Draco would have to give him a proper lesson in owning clothing of appropriate lengths to fit his body. A nicely tailored shirt would suit Potter much better than the muggle garments he usually wears, anyway, not to mention it would be much more office appropriate. Draco always could appreciate a handsome man in a well-tailored suit.

‘It’s fine. I didn’t have anything else to do, anyway.’

had ripped him away from parents who might have loved him, who might have given him a loving home. This evil wizard was the reason Harry had grown up in Privet Drive, and raised by Uncle Vernon.
No matter how many sessions Draco had with Patch, he still couldn’t bring himself to say the name.
Draco turned to look at him, a vaguely amused smile on his face. ‘Your treat? My, my, Potter, who knew you had all this chivalry in you? I’ll have to get the next round then.’
Draco tried (and failed) not to long for the life he had always dreamed of; sat having breakfast with his wife - although
Having said his piece, Draco turned back to resolutely continue being ignored by the brunet. He most certainly did not expect said brunet to suddenly lunge at him and wrap his arms around his neck and start sobbing into his shoulder.

is hardly the only establishment for a wizard to get a cup of coffee in Britain, nor is it by far the best. The Java Snitch is a much higher class of cafe. Plus it’s quidditch themed, so. It’s a win-win.
Harry had never heard a less sincere apology, but he was going to take the win. Smirking at Malfoy, Harry turned back round to face the man - Eddie - and gave him his undivided attention.
Potter sighed, but he was smiling now. Smart man, he knew a losing battle when he saw one.
‘You’re in love with Draco! Have been for a few years now, just like he has. Only we’ve been waiting for you to realise you like men. Draco had the advantage there, he came out to all of us at some point in eighth year.’ She winced at that, and at Harry’s astonished reaction. ‘Told us not to tell you.’
‘Oh, no. If I have to be named after one of them, I might as well have my own personal constellation to bring me luck and rain misery down onto my enemies.’
Have you been in contact with anyone not permitted by the terms of your parole?’
‘Oh. Hi, Harry.’
Harry
Tossing a few galleons onto the table to cover the drink, Harry stood and left the coffeehouse, and resolutely decided that he simply could not go any further with his day without informing Tweedle Dum of his brand new, shiny date.
‘Honestly, do these people have nothing better to gossip about than who you buy your veg with?’
Harry felt his cheeks pink. ‘Thanks, keep your fingers crossed for a second date for me, then. And thanks for the coffees!’ he raised up the two mugs in mock cheers, and the barista laughed at him.
, Potter.’ Draco winked at him and earnt himself yet another glare.
- and he was trying, honest! - but calling him Draco to his face was a whole ‘nother ball park that Harry just couldn’t bring himself to face just yet. If he got an earful about it from Patch later, so be in. If Draco started calling him “Harry” out of the blue, he’d be freaking out and throwing hexes; Draco’s shock-horror seemed like a particularly mild response in comparison.
shade of red, that it was almost worth the slew of butterflies that seem to have taken up a permanent residence in his stomach.
to be Earl Grey! And none of that “own brand” shite. It always tastes like dishwater. Pick me up a box of that Twining's.’)
‘Harry, hey!’ Draco turned and grinned at him, and Harry was struck, as always, at just how beautiful Draco was.
Was it too much for Harry to ask to find someone like that for himself? Sure, maybe he couldn’t fall in love with his best friend, they were both
Well shit.
Harry could have wept at the familiar bantering. ‘I believe it was because you were using me to better your family name and social standing.’
Instantly, the bar was filled with noise and screams and laughter of students looking for a drink on a Friday night. Harry was jostled away from his position at the bar, but he didn’t mind as he wanted to get to Draco anyway, and ask him what the hell was going on?
pull it.
‘- Well, we had yesterday’s at Grimmauld because I had to watch Teddy too, right? It was just easier to do it there, only then he stayed and watched Aladdin with me and Ted afterwards, Ted wouldn’t just let him leave, you see? So we watched the film, and that finished, and I put Teddy to bed, but Malfoy was still there. He was just sat on my sofa watching the title sequence of bloody Aladdin going round and round, and he looked a bit miserable so I asked if he wanted a fire whiskey with me and-’
It didn’t make it any easier on him with the knowledge that he had to have been about the worst first date in the history of first dates, but Sam had still blushed and flustered and invited Harry in for a nightcap three times in a row. They hadn’t shared more than a few chaste kisses, but Harry figured after so long out of the game he could be excused for such poor romancing skills. Either that, or he really had to start getting paranoid about Sam’s motives to make Harry his rubbish boyfriend, and he really would be an outrageously rubbish boyfriend if his current mood carried on any longer.
Did Potter sneak into the parlour to get a tattoo without Draco noticing?
‘Oh… I’d love- an honour- yes!’ He reached across the table and grabbed both of their hands.
Draco had to concentrate very hard not to smirk at that. He had thought earlier that Potter had no clue how magical tattoos work from his reaction to Eddie mentioning the charms, but this just confirmed it.
So: shocked.
‘Not a Mind Healer, a muggle psychiatrist. I might be a wizard, but I’m muggleborn, so I’m a Muggle first and foremost, and proud of it. After I graduated Hogwarts I went to university up in Belfast, got my psychology degree, and got licensed. When I heard after the war the Azkaban was hiring for human guards, I jumped at the chance; I could use my qualifications to help people -
She snorted and took another sip of her coffee. ‘No, it isn’t.’
It was Draco’s turn to blush then. ‘Of course I did. You were an obnoxious little git at Hogwarts, and I stayed up late every night, praying to the Draco constellation that something bad would happen and you’d get into trouble. Unluckily for me, you always seemed to get yourself out of it.’
on a plaque next to the door.
Summoning up as much Gryffindor courage (not that he should have needed bravery; he was making fun of Potter, wasn’t he?) as he could possibly stomach in an inherently Slytherin body, Draco asked the question before he could lose his nerve.
But was Malfoy -
If you do not wish to read this chapter, or you think it may be triggering for you, PLEASE DON’T. I think the warning, the knowledge that it happens in Azkaban, and the knowledge of how people treated Death Eaters after the war, will give enough of an indication of the plot, that you do not need to read the section I’ve written on this for this chapter. There will be other mentions of Draco's trauma in following chapters but I will put chapter warnings at the beginning (just like this one) for those who do not wish to read them.
‘Why have you been crying, Malfoy?’
It made perfect sense.
There it was, that snooty, drawling,
Malfoy had been late for every single meeting.
‘It is when it’s combined with his skin being dyed green, love. Everyone knows George likes to test out new products on himself and they don’t want to risk that those ones might already be on the shelves.’
, exactly, he couldn’t tell, but there was definitely more of something, and it was truly excellent.
Just as expected, and much to Draco’s satisfaction, Potter turned a suitable shade of red and swallowed audibly. Blinking rapidly several times, Potter then cleared his throat and put Edward down. Draco couldn’t help but smirk at how easy it appeared to be for him to fluster Potter, to make Potter feel just as horrid and uncomfortable as he made Draco feel. Served him right, really, Malfoys were not above being petty.
Was it the whiskey?
‘Attack in Diagon Alley, mate. Robards wants us to go.’ Ron poked his head around Harry’s office door.
‘D, how could you
Sam’s own eyes flashed with hurt at Harry’s curt tone and hardened expression but, Harry thought to himself,
‘Y’know, kid, it’s considered rude in wizarding culture to refuse a tip.’
Draco winced again. ‘Sorry, mum. I’m sorry for worrying you, I should have floo’d.’
He knew Potter was just using his first name to wind him up, and Draco’ll be damned if he lets it slip that it was working.
‘Saviour complex, can’t do any-’
‘Malfoy, come in and sit down.’ Potter was stood up and facing away from Draco as he came into the room, putting some book back onto his shelving, giving Draco the most
‘Saviour complex, can’t do any-’
Harry rolled his eyes. ‘Oh shut up, you know what I mean.’
‘I am indeed, call me Patch, though, please. P is reserved strictly for Draco, I’m afraid. You must be “arsehole parole officer”?’
Instead, he went for the much safer (although much less satisfying) approach of thinking through a selection of rather colourful expletives to describe his supposed “best friend”. His “best friend” that could apparently read him like a book no matter how many shields or layers of masks that he put up.
Draco felt sick.
‘When, er, when will it start to move?’
worse at it all.
Harry stood there in shock. Draco, his best friend, was gay and had never told him. And had also never told him that he’d been
go against Hermione in an argument, but for the sake of bearing witness to another domestic between the two, he intervened.
‘Malfoy.’
‘...and then I jumped on the back of an erumpent and we rode off into the sunset.’
Harry ordered and collected the drinks at the bar, settling for just two glasses of champagne rather than a whole bottle since it was only two of them actually
Harry willed himself to move, to look up at Draco. Drawn, as always, to those gorgeous grey eyes, Harry couldn’t help but notice the hints of worry he saw there, and the nervous way that Draco now held himself.
He loved his adoptive family, he really did, but their levels of noise and the speed they drank at was proving to be too much for him today. There was so much on his mind, from Malfoy, to the kiss, to Sam; he was just trying to keep his head above water, any more and Harry was sure it would drown him.
‘Last minute rota change,’ Malfoy brushed it off with a wave of his hand. How could he be so nonchalant when Harry was seconds away from hyperventilating over here? ‘I had to cover Ivy but it’s no big deal.’
‘Alright, alright! Honestly, Charlie, how could I forget?’ Harry could feel his eyes shining at the memory of it.
All other events, be it the fortnightly pub night with Ron and Hermione (although he manages to duck out of those when he can think of a convincing enough excuse, not often, but he does), or the occasional Sunday roast at the Burrow with all five hundred members of the Weasley extended family (okay, maybe there was only thirty people at most, and those lunches were much easier to duck out of, but he still makes an effort to go on special occasions, Molly would never forgive him if he didn’t), manage to blur into one and be forgotten about as soon as they occur.
I hope I can do this and our boys justice here, and any feedback/criticism/general comments are very very welcome to me!
‘I suppose it’s too late to show you the right sor-’
The biggest change, though, had been Draco. Because he was Draco even among muggles now, never to be Malfoy again.
‘So. This is our third meeting now… has your employment changed?’
that Harry couldn’t help but lean into him a little.
‘Thanks for listening, P… yeah, you too, mum misses you… talk to you soon.’
‘Sorry, Mione,’ Harry said, still laughing, ‘I just keep picturing what Angie’s face must have been like when George got back from the shop that day, and it sets me off again.’
‘MIONE! How could you? The ferret and Harry?! Were you not there the entire time we were at Hogwarts? They’ll kill each other in a week!’
‘I… um… yes I did. It was me who suggested assigning you and Malfoy to Kingsley in the first place.’ She finally managed to look Harry in the eye, and the level of guilt he saw was almost enough for him to feel sorry for her. Almost. Ron on the other hand…
, it’s where I get emailed my rota and payslips.’
‘I’ll see you soon, H.’ The nickname Harry reserved only for Draco to use made his heart swell right back up again. ‘I really am sorry, I was looking forward to that drink.’
He was brought out of his internal panic by a drink being pushed into his hand. Turning to look (and yell) at the person who dared infringe on his personal space, Draco was instead met with the kind and knowing eyes of one Mister Patrick Waldron.
healthy tan with only a hint of sunburn across Ron’s nose. Mione must’ve had him bathing in suncream for him to have escaped with no lobster sunburn. Harry smiled back at his best friends.
And with that, Malfoy stood and tried his very best to not run from the room. Harry couldn’t blame him at all, if
‘No, I… of course I did. I just- I mean- I didn’t think you were working today?’ Harry managed to squeak out. Malfoy’s casual flippance with French did nothing to help out Harry’s ability to think clearly.
He looked confused. ‘I don’t remember saying that?’
‘It’s what they do in movies isn’t it? When friends or boyfriends get sick?’ Harry desperately hoped that Draco hadn’t noticed the way Harry had squeaked out the word “boyfriends”. Honestly, they had yet to have a successful attempt at a first date, Harry really shouldn’t be getting all giddy around the word boyfriend.
‘Just, er, letting you know it wasn’t a date,’ Potter trailed off, suddenly looking very insecure, as though he couldn’t quite believe that he’d just divulged such precious information to a
, when he needed it most and there was no one else around. And if it made Draco’s heart speed up and skip the occasional beat and the butterflies in his stomach to beat incessantly against his ribcage, then that was just something Draco would have to push down and ignore until it went away.
Now, Draco didn’t work at a tattoo parlour for nothing; he could recognise a protective film that goes around a new tattoo when he saw one. But to his knowledge, Potter hadn’t been back into the parlour since Draco had inked that stag for him, and that was a few months ago now.
Happy reading xox
Thoughts of ‘
!’ and tried to ignore the knot in his stomach that had tightened around the words “next time”.
‘Yes it is, I’m telling you that it is. It was just something I made Draco agree to, to get the press off my back. I thought it’d be a bit of a laugh.’
Luckily for Harry, Luke was a true friend and just nodded understandingly at him before narrowing his eyes at the back of Sam’s unsuspecting head. Harry had to stifle a smirk whilst still in full view of Sam, but he had a feeling that Sam was in for a nasty bit of discipline from his boss there, if not being fired with immediate effect for losing the cafe’s most famous patron.
. ‘Erm yeah, I guess that fits the bill.’ He held his hand out for Patch to shake. ‘Call me Harry.’
‘Fuck Robards, honestly. And Ron gets it, he can take plenty of notes for the both of us. Merlin, it’s like you didn’t expect me to care that you got hurt.’
‘And don’t you look so smug, either, Potter.'
‘Perfect Potter and his-’
rather than dark and set to curse you if you entered. The walls were a pale duck egg blue and the flooring looked like it was reclaimed original floorboards, nothing at all like the greys and blacks and snake detailing that had canvassed the entire house before.
Sam’s eyebrows shoot up at the same time as the corner of his mouth quirks into a tiny upwards smile, too quickly for him to acknowledge it before schooling his expression into one that he no doubt hoped was less enthusiastic and slightly more nonchalant, much to the bemusement of Harry.
Who was this “Liam”? And why was he interrupting Harry’s date with Draco? Who did he think he was, waltzing in here, all tall, dark and handsome, and hugging Draco like
Draco grinned and leaned over, nuzzling his head into Harry’s neck and bringing his hand up to grip onto the t-shirt Harry was wearing. It took all of Harry’s concentration to not bury his nose into the soft hair brushing against his cheek and take a deep breath of Draco’s citrusy shampoo.
Potter’s cheeks pinked. ‘Right. Well. fire whiskey? Or do you want a beer?’
exactly he felt the need to, but it was an excuse to make Potter feel uncomfortable and flirt with him a bit more so he was going to continue. That is, until he spotted the stag pawing at the… ground? Skin? … Skin, and charge right at where his fingers were brushing against Potter’s wrist. Nearly jumping a mile (
(Harry had never seen Draco in such high spirits as the days that Harry sent him flowers.)
‘Erm. Yes?’ the words squeaked out of him, and if he wasn’t so scared, he’d be mortified at his apparent reversion to pre-pubescence.
Looking over to the opposite pavement, Harry saw Draco grinning and waving over at him. His heart grew at the sight.
‘How can you say it’s nothing? They assaulted you! Last time I checked, that was still illegal, Malfoy. And they’re
Harry was reeling, how could this be happening? How could Malfoy possibly have got a job at the tattoo parlour he was booked into for Sunday afternoon? An appointment he’d had booked for weeks, still having to pluck up insane amounts of courage just to take a trip down Diagon Alley. And now supposedly Malfoy would be there too? Watching him?
comments and kudos give me lifeeeeeeee xox
‘Yeah, me too, D. Maybe next time, hey?’
, Potter! You’re acting like you didn’t know I worked here.’
‘Again I’ll say, piss
‘Blimey! Erm, Malfoy. Erm, are you coming with?’
Draco bloody Malfoy had brought what looked like half of their entire year with him on their date.
‘Stop psychoanalysing my guests, P.’ The unmistakable, posh drawl of Mal-
was his new parole officer, and made for the apparition point to head home. He turned with a sharp
‘Er, no. No date… and no witches, any way,’ Potter was mumbling back to him.
Potter looked up at him with the most empty expression in his eyes. Draco’s heart almost broke, he was pretty sure he’d do just about anything to get the fire back going behind those eyes.
Of all the things Harry thought Patch could have asked him, why he still called Malfoy
‘Just Draco. Right.’ Harry frowned down at his glass of punch. He’d never thought of it that way before.
‘Right. We were only nineteen. Fresh out of Hogwarts, fresh out of a war, fresh new friendship, and the Weasley’s welcomed me in with open arms. I’d never known a Christmas so warm and full of love, and you looked so at home, right in the middle of it all.’ Harry could almost smell the cinnamon of the buns that Molly loved to bake fresh everyday (she needed to, with so many of her own children, and then Harry, Hermione and Draco on top). ‘Well, it was that Christmas Eve; I heard you and Ginny in the lounge, and you came out to her.’
As a matter of fact, Harry
George let out a scandalised gasp. ‘A date! Oh, little, baby, not-quite brother! Who’s the lucky… girl? Boy? Who? Who!’
‘Erm, yeah. That might be best. See you next week, Malfoy.’
Right on time, Harry heard a knock at the door to his flat.
‘So, erm… how did you meet Malfoy?’ Harry asked, desperate to break the awkward silence between them.
‘Dray - car!’
Harry’s voice came out choked, not at all in the confident way he was supposed to be feeling as an Auror in charge of his newly paroled offender.
‘Hey, Draco!’ Harry pulled him in for a hug. When he pulled back, Draco looked a little confused but both men shook it off.
Harry tugged at his hair in frustration. ‘You think I don’t know that, Mione?’
‘Er, yeah. Sure, I’ll see you then.’ Harry beamed back.
‘Shut it, Seamus.’
A secret stag? Draco racked his memory, trying to come up with some kind of reasoning behind it, hadn’t there been something about a stag with one of Potter’s most infamous spells?
‘Honestly Potter, I don’t know why you’re insisting on forcing yourself through the training, you’ve got the most experience in the wizarding world.’ Robards frowned at him over the Auror training request forms Harry had thrust upon his desk. ‘Not to mention your honorary N.E.W.T.s from Headmistress McGonnagall, and your - frankly - glowing letter of recommendation from the Minister of Magic.’
‘Alright, alright, I’ll drop it, no need to get all upset,’ Harry chuckled, enjoying the very obvious discomfort from Sam. Clearly Luke has been onto something when he’d mentioned a couple of weeks ago about a certain
‘Come on, you,’ Draco said. Another fond smile. ‘Time to go.’
He’d never touched Harry, apart from the odd grabbing-him-by-the-scruff-of-his-neck situation, but one can only live in a cupboard, starve, and be verbally abused for so long before it starts to have an effect. That, and Uncle Vernon enthusiastically encouraged Dudley and his friends in their “Harry hunting”, only to enthusiastically berate him if he managed to get away.
‘Of course. Thank you, my dragon.’ Narcissa smiled at her son, he rolled his eyes at the pet name, and poured the tea into both of their cups.
There was, though, the issue of the
That sobered Ron up quickly enough. His face suddenly empty and blank, but Harry could see the gears turning in his brain sure enough, rapidly trying to process the - surely - impossible information that Harry had just dumped on him.
‘Right,’ Malfoy’s voice came out of nowhere and almost gave Harry half a heart attack, ‘you’re all done with the ink. Shall I get started on the movement charm?’
married and
that, Dra- Malfoy.’
. He felt his face twist up, his heart squeeze, and something in his stomach knot up again. But it only took one look back up into those eyes, those shining blue eyes that look so sincere and full of hints of guilt and hope, for all of his previous reservations and resentments to fade away into the background. Harry knows that he’s got so much going on in his own head to sort out before he could even consider anything to do with Sam again, but the ease of it all, the familiarity, was almost enough for him to just dive straight back in head first.
