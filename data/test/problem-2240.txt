Mother's face lights up, and she rushes around the island to hug you tightly, which you return. I can feel you practically glowing at her affection as you nuzzle into her neck, chirping happily.
And even though that's all you say, I know exactly what you mean. No, he can't have someone else's towel. No, because it will smell like someone else. No, because he will smell like someone else. I do the first thing I think of - fall against him before he has the chance to wrap the towel around himself, forcing him to drop it and catch me. His arms around me feel like home.
The day after not finding my mate in the pack, I can't help but be slightly down. Whatever little expectations there were, they were still there. And they were still dashed. It doesn't help that my mate pains have officially turned from annoying to painful. There's a constant throbbing at the base of my head, and my muscles ache the more I use them. Occasionally, my skin starts burning, but after a while, it fades away. I wonder if it's when I get close to my mate. I try to chase it sometimes but never get anywhere. I'm at breakfast, staring at a full plate and decidedly not listening to Ron and Hermione bickering, whilst instead watching Romilda Vane do a very similar thing across the table. I realise that it must be even worse for her than it is for me. She has met her mate, and after all, missing someone you know and love with all your heart is far worse than missing someone you've never met. The realisation does nothing to make me feel better. I don't think anything could at this point, aside from finally meeting my mate.
Eventually I can't take it anymore and I need to get out. Not just of my 'nest', but of the dorm. It's suddenly become stifling in here. I find myself in the library. There are a couple of people clearing up, but it's mostly empty. I keep my head down, so focused on not drawing attention to myself that I don't even notice I have until shadows are cast over the table. I look up, careful not to make eye contact, and recognise three seventh year Gryffindors. I don't say anything, letting them speak first as a sign of respect they probably won't even recognise.
My mother and I apparate to the station, and I am faced with swarming crowds that make me feel even more anxious. Like I'm completely surrounded, trapped. And it's so loud and hot, and I can feel glances, and sometimes outright stares, crawling all over me like bugs. They're looking at my wings, I know they are. I knew that to attempt to hide them with my robe wouldn't work; they're too big. Or maybe they're just looking at me- Draco Malfoy, Death Eater who was for some reason excused from punishment. Draco Malfoy, son of Azkaban prisoner and one of the Dark Lord's right-hand men. Draco Malfoy, the enemy of the saviour of the entire Wizarding World. Draco Malfoy, now nothing.
"You are dismissed, thank you for coming to see me. Feel free to do so if you find yourselves needing anything." She nods, and we take it as our cue to leave her office. Zabini leans down to whisper something in Neville's ear, who blushes and nods, before letting himself be led away in the direction of the dungeons.
"They... they'll judge me, like the first years, and everyone h-hates m-me bec-cause I was a d-death eater... no one was mean b-because they were scared of m-me, b-but now... now I'm pathetic."
"Potter!" I stop, turning around to find him behind me. I nod at him, a sign of respect, and he does the same. "If you're going to find Draco, don't."
"Wouldn't do anything else, Zabini." He leaves, headed to the dungeons, and I turned to Neville as we start walking. "So, what happened?"
"Oh, Draco. I would never. Never." I want so badly to get this through to him. "We are meant to be together. I was made for you, to be yours." He smiles, shyly and small, but I would do anything to see that smile forever. "I'm yours, Draco." But then he frowns.
"Y-yeah. I'm okay, I guess. I just... what's Father going to say?" At this, Mother wraps me in a hug.
But a chocked sob flying out of Draco's mouth makes me turn away, focusing again on the love of my life.
What about Re and Siri, and my father's old pack? Besides, I don't want to live in the Hogwarts grounds.
Okay, I've now caught up with myself posting wise, so from now on I hope to be updating this once a week. Hope you've enjoyed it so far! Make sure to leave a comment telling me what you think.
"I missed you, too. You shouldn't hunt for so long." He gives a noncommittal chuckle and pulls away from her.
"Okay," I say, cutting off his probably chaotic inner monologue. "That's more than okay, my love. Whatever you need." But he's still tense, and then I realise- "You have my permission to speak throughout this whole conversation, is that okay?" At that, he finally relaxes, nodding, and breathes out deeply. "Good boy, you're so good for me." He chirps, the sound filling me with inexplicable joy, and nuzzles against my hand cupping his cheek. A rush of your emotion suddenly reaches me, so strong that combined with mine it nearly overwhelms me, and I have to talk to distract myself before... I don't know. Before something. "Now, what was your question?"
- submissive nature to hurt me. And then, inexplicably, what if my mate knew me? What if they knew me before, and hated me then, and don't give me another chance? What if they reject me? What if they reject me and ridicule me and hurt me and hate me hate me hate me? My mate can't hate me, they just can't.
"Thank you," I murmur in Blaise's ear, whilst Pansy talks to Theo. "You know, for being cool about everything."
"No, I've already forgotten. I'll only look properly when you're finished, okay?" He breathes a sigh of relief. "There you go, you're so good for me, Draco." He keens, subconsciously rubbing his cheek across my scent gland. Pre-marking me. I practically melt. But then I remember- "This wasn't what was wrong in the common room. What happened then?" He stops abruptly, lifting his head so I can see his widened eyes as he remembers.
"Fuck, Dray, how much more perfect can you get?" My blush returns full force. Perfect. My mate thinks I'm perfect. Happiness rushes over me, submerging me entirely until it's all I feel and all I'll ever feel. We walk through the castle, which is, to my relief, astonishingly empty. There are a few people here and there to stop and gape, but Harry quickly growls at them so low I can feel it vibrate in his chest, and they soon stop.
"Hey guys," I say. I remain standing, looking to Neville as a form of respect that I wouldn't normally offer, but I would like us to remain friends. If we do, I could end up becoming much closer to him. He nods, and I smile, sitting next to him.
"I thought we cleared that up, sweetheart. You fainted during your inheritance, and you have all the characteristics of a sub."
"Stop it," Nev mumbles. We start heading up to the castle in silence, before Neville asks, "we have to go see McGonagall, right?" I groan. I had forgotten about that.
"And I, yours, mate," my mate says, and whilst I can't hear their voice, I can hear their words, and they are everything. I am pulled into consciousness by Blaise, who I growl at for doing so. He chuckles at me.
You're mad, and not at me, even if you pretend to be. You're mad we have to leave Draco and my 'Lexie, like I am. You bring the collar of Draco's cloak up to your face and inhale his scent until you're calm enough to keep going. I revel in the scent of my mate, but still. It's not enough. You keep walking until you reach the common room. The portrait lady asks for the password, and you snap at her until she lets you in, grumbling about how rude you were. You don't care.
"Almost more than I was. He's different, Draco. He doesn't care about your past, all he knows is that you're a sub and it's his job to protect you. Trust me, aside from myself, he is the least likely to hurt you." It reassures me somewhat, I no longer feel terrified at least, but I can't help but feel sceptical. I know for a fact that Potter hates me, and to be honest, I don't blame him. So why would he be worried about me? I just don't understand. "I should get back. I don't like leaving my mate so long. I'll see you in a bit, okay? Shouldn't take too long."
“He’s just been a… real prat towards someone I care about. And it’s kind of made him make a bad decision, and, well… it ended badly.”
touched him all this time and Draco didn’t freak out (so much). He had all these people who cared about him, who forgave him, still there, maybe constant. Maybe something he could even trust. And Harry – and his magic –
“Dumbledore will never take me,” Malfoy shook his head, eyes returning to their normal size. “He will never – no, you're wrong. You keep doing this, Potter.” He rubbed his eyes furiously, head bent. “Thinking there’s a bloody choice. That there are options and opportunities and free will. You are nothing but a delusional child.” Without giving Harry any time to respond, he shot to his feet. “I can’t be thinking only about myself anymore, Potter. Not when her life is on the line. Not when I’m the only one who can – you must stop trying to deter me from the one bloody thing I can do to save her.” He shook more and more violently as he went on. “You're the one who’s incurably into saving people, aren’t you? Then you must know where I’m coming from.” And he stalked away without even taking a breath, leaving Harry with his mind reeling. And once again he had to come up with a reasonable excuse to give Professor Electra for Malfoy’s absence.
Draco was losing his mind with fear, that had to be it. What he thought he was hearing, witnessing, was so far into the impossible that it had to be imagined. There was no fucking way Grove was begging Harry to take information about Him. It didn’t match anything he’d known, remembered or understood. Hell, it didn’t match anything he could know or remember or understand. Grove was – he was Draco’s worst nightmare, for years and years on end he ruled the list of his worst fears. Grove broke him, completely and beyond repair. What was this, this bundle of flesh pretending to be him? What was this meant to be?
For a second it looked like Potter was about to grab his hand, and Draco held his breath. He had no idea how he’d react if he did. A part of him longed for it – another part of him shuddered at the very thought – but Potter never actually went for it, just crossed his hands on his stomach and rolled his eyes. “Is it fifteen? I don’t know. Stop moving so I can count properly.” Draco relaxed, let out a brief laugh and sat back down. Potter was
at him, which was somehow still a thing Draco was starved for, no matter how much he was seen every day.
Draco had to laugh. “I’m not saying anything, Potter. The Deathless Elixir is just a myth. There is absolutely zero proof that a potion like that ever existed. If you'd heard of it outside of a theoretical potions lecture, it was probably in some sort of proverb.”
Snape sighed. “I do believe you, Draco. In any case, you know you can’t lie to me. I would just be cautious, if I were you, not to display any of these – feelings – around him.”
“Oh, Potter. Sad little Potter. Did your little heart break once again? Are you going to cry your eyes out?”
Ron let out a low whistle. “I still can’t really wrap my mind about that. You and him, close. I mean I can get the whole, you know – physical stuff. But to think you are actually connecting… it’s bizarre. But I’m really happy for you, still,” he added almost in an afterthought, and Harry laughed.
“What’s’it?” he asked, a little dumbfounded, blinking a lot and trying to get the world back into one sharp image. “‘re you okay?”
, the voice in his head reprimanded, and he shivered in response. I know. I know I'm bad. I’m sorry.
“You’re drunk,” Draco repeated with disdain. He didn’t like this one bit. Not that he thought Harry would hurt him like they have, those whiskey-stained memories, but still. He didn’t like it.
“Then we should be good.” He leaned forward and kissed Draco very softly on the lips. The blond rested his head on Harry’s chest again, heaving a little with pain, and Harry held him close and wished more than anything that there was something he could do. They stayed in bed for hours, way past midday, deep into the afternoon.
, not as he was, never again. Everything he learned in the past few months, what he thought he might be able to believe, the little he collected of himself and perhaps would have been able to keep. Not anymore, and there was no use overthinking it. There was simply nothing to it; a mindless pet was what He wanted of him, and He always, always got what He wanted from Draco. So he had to give up, had to give in. It shouldn’t hurt, since he didn’t know what he was giving up on. He had no idea who he was in the slightest, not in the most obscure sense. He simply didn’t know. He didn’t know anything anymore.
“And what happened?” the smooth voice made Draco’s skin crawl, at least the part of it he still had intact. He didn’t want to look directly at him, for when he did his knees almost buckled, so he looked at his father instead.
“That very night. He wasn’t extremely keen on you finding out, for obvious reasons, so I never pushed the matter further, but he did say he believed you had the right to know.” Dumbledore sighed and stroked his long beard. “That night when you came to me, Harry, I have to admit I had already known about Draco’s task.”
“That’s what you said last week. And the week before it. And the one before. And yet we have not practiced a single time since break.” Malfoy pulled up into a sitting position, looking at him seriously. “You know this is important, Potter. Besides, I wouldn’t be using that word around me unless you were willing to go all the way.”
“I just hate it,” he said, gritting his teeth. “I hate being so helpless around you. And I hate that you have this on me, that you have this power. It’s driving me insane. I was such a fool to ever talk to you.”
Pleased, Draco beamed at him. “Thanks for getting it. And for all your help today. It was nice to have you around for a change.”
“Cousin Draco, Cousin Draco, do you remember when you gave me that dragon doll? I still have it! do you want to see it? Gran can summon it for us and she’ll show you!”
“Are you serious? You'll go, no matter what I say? Do you really care so little for me that there's nothing I can do to convince you?” Draco sounded so desperate, he was on the verge of tears. Harry stroked his arm lightly.
“Yes, Potter, I wanted to. I’m sad and alone and I wanted to kiss you, all right?” his tone was growing desperate, his eyes widening. Harry shook his head.
Draco nodded stiffly. “Keep out of sight, Dobby.” Then he turned to the invisible three. “Keep the cloak on at all times, no matter what we see. Be absolutely quiet. If I'm attacked – “
“Of course not,” Malfoy’s voice rose a little, and he looked up again. “It’s just that… During the summer, with Greyback there, he forced me to – I had to watch him… feast. It was the constant threat, you see. One step out of line, and I will be his next meal. Hadn’t been able to… well, I didn’t have much appetite since then.”
so calmly.” Draco gestured towards the pumpkin-jumper Potter had on. “I’m sure even Weasley would refuse to wear that.”
How could he treat him like this? Snape was always terrible towards Harry, and he knew that he was nothing but a horrible, horrible person. But towards Malfoy, his all-time favorite, the son of his close personal friend? A boy in his care that was fucking frightened for his own life? And the rage that always bubbled underneath the surface was threatening to take over him, to consume him entirely. He was in half a mind to run after them, screaming and cursing Snape into a slimy, mindless creature. But then reality knocked at his door and he realized how dangerous that could be for Malfoy. If Snape would think Harry knows about whatever Malfoy was requested to do, he will definitely tell his master, and Malfoy’s mother will… He tried to calm himself down instead, working on taking deep breaths, slowing down his racing heart. It took him a long time, but in the end he was able to take himself slowly down the stairs and back to Gryffindor tower, where Ron and Hermione were waiting with a lot of questions. He tried to answer them calmly before retiring to his dormitory. He was aching to be alone. The terrified look on Malfoy’s face was burning in his gut like an actual flame.
“No,” he raised his head faster than lightning. He looked at the werewolf with a mixture of repulsion and detestation. “You will leave them all for the Dark Lord. He will decide what to do with them.”
Draco’s heart broke so many times the past two days – the past week – the past whatever – but the way it did now felt brand new. It was as if the entire universe was somehow stuffed inside his chest, and it was crumbling very noisily into a great vacuum. He felt sick again. Oh, Merlin’s pants, this was the very last thing he could deal with right now. But he had to try, he had to fucking try. “Harry, can you – can you please just listen to me for one minute?”
“So what?” her tone was so careless, so casual, that he actually paused to think about it. What if she was right? What if it didn’t matter?
Which of course was very much the wrong thing to say. Draco opened his eyes, aghast. The face next to his was a very poor attempt of self-control. “Yeah, I guess that’s right.”
“Don’t give me that look, I can’t stand when you’re all miserable like that. Look, I know you must have a lot of questions, and I’m sorry I can’t give you more straightforward answers. It just hurts a little too much to talk about. It’s not because of you.” He never would have expected such an honest reply from Malfoy. “Even though you still remain a total buzzkill.”
him have it, and therefore there was no surprise in how fast he was spinning out of control. Potter could say a word and Draco would open,
“Lucius,” the Dark Lord said as he arrived to the little group standing at the edge of the room. “You have summoned me here. You said you had something which I long desired to obtain.”
. Said it more than enough times and meant it, too, Draco knew that. You can’t abuse someone you love, right? And after all, love wasn’t meant to be easy. Love was meant to be hard, and Draco didn’t deserve it as it was, so… nope. Not a second did he spend thinking about it. Not at all.
roof, and you never get any space from me. I thought maybe you wanted, needed some. I wanted you to have the option. And I suppose that… maybe in a way I thought I deserved it, because that was such a screw-up, Draco, I can't believe I just did that. But I’m never going to
“But the thing he said,” Ron furrowed his brows. “The conversation Harry and Draco had in here – how did they know about that?”
She was torn for a minute, and it was possible to see the dilemma in her eyes. Draco harnessed all his will power and looked at her with silent pleading. His shoulders dropped with relief when she closed her eyes and nodded once. Oh Lord. She was actually agreeing to go. He thought he might have to stun her by a spell and shove her out of the room.
“Draco, please,” he heard Hermione beg as he stopped in front of them. “You don’t have to do this. We can help you. Please, just think about what you’re doing."
“At first it was really more of an escape,” Harry admitted, his head emerging from his firm hold. “I used Malfoy to stop myself from thinking of Sirius, to keep myself distracted. But then after we talked about it I – I don’t know. It’s like he… helps me somehow? To make it not so bad.”
“Maybe you should be,” he whispered, looking directly into Harry’s eyes. “Maybe you should be very, very concerned.”
He didn’t kneel, though. He had some self-control. “So what exactly do I get out of having the moon, with it being all the way up there?”
“Potter, please, I don’t need to – someone needs to stay with you, monitor your condition. What if you need something during the night?”
“We should start thinking about dinner,” Mother said, perhaps sensing the difficulty in the situation. “What would you like, boys? We should celebrate tonight. Draco, any suggestions?”
“Not enough,” he whispered back, lightly trailing Malfoy’s face with his fingers. “And not nearly close enough to what I want to do to you.”
Narcissa closed her eyes, seemingly in great pain. “I don’t know that it will be possible, Potter. But I will try. The most important thing is to get all you children out of here before we run into Lucius... Or worse.” At that, she opened her eyes. They were so disturbingly similar to Draco’s – the same silvery lines running deep in them. Only hers were now filled with such fierceness, it was a little hard to look at them straight on.
“Ooh, Potter is sullen,” Malfoy sneered, and Harry felt his cheeks flush. “What is it, Goldie? No one to save today, so you’re a little grumpy?”
Potter shrugged again. “I really am sorry for not coming after Tuesday. I didn’t mean to leave you hanging. I had a lot on my mind.”
voice, and his insides froze and melted at the same time. Not an illusion. This was real, it had to be real. A hand grabbed the back of his neck, a
For a second it looked like he was about to pat him on the shoulder, but then Potter’s hand changed direction and landed in his own hair. “Good night, Malfoy. I guess I’ll see you round soon enough.”
of attack before, and it was a little hard to imagine that the slender, beautiful woman in this cozy Hogwarts class could somehow simulate a real war. However, he was alert. Something about the fine lines around her mouth made him think he did not want to mess with her.
For a second Draco let himself picture it, him and Harry and the quiet forest all around them. They would be holding hands, because it’s so much easier to do that outside. The sun would be shining through the leaves and the whole place would smell like autumn. He tormented himself with this lovely image for a moment. Only then did he catch on – “Hunting for what?”
He didn’t know how to explain it. He didn’t know what to think. It was impossible, absolutely impossible, breaking-the-rules-of-time-and-space impossible, too-far-fetched-to-be-real impossible, will-kill-him-this-very-instant impossible. Just impossible. And yet – “You just said His name.”
Right, as if he’s buying that. A meltdown is upon us – the end is near – so what have you fucking got to say?
Potter looked about the premises as if expecting banners to drop from the ceiling, shouting ‘April’s Fool!’ even though it was January. “What the fuck? Flowers?”
“So when you saw me at the shop…?” Draco felt strong enough to look at him now. Locks of dark hair shook and his expression was so gentle.
“Malfoy, I’m…” Potter broke first, and Draco readied himself – here comes the first strike – “I’m so sorry.”
“No, sir. Absolutely not. I remind myself constantly that he is nothing but a target. I look forward to delivering him to our Lord and getting him off my hands.”
Well, now, he told himself, but his feet just wouldn’t listen. Come on. Step by step. It wasn’t like he had much of a choice in the matter; he could not risk stirring His wrath, not when the balance was so shoddy between them. How bad could it possibly be, right? He just needs to tell Potter a little about what happened in Azkaban, but not too much so he won’t ask too many questions, and somehow make him go away and never come back. Piece of cake. This was no time to be lily-livered. He shook himself once, then again, and a third time because he really hated when his mind thought in flowers, before detaching from the door and finally beginning to move.
“Do not fool yourself, he's never gone. He will come back, that much is certain. He won’t be gone if we do not take care of it ourselves.”
“Yes, Potter, I’m fine,” Malfoy laughed rather breathlessly, and he dug his hands in Harry’s hair and started stroking him gently. “You don’t seem great, though. I think I might have given you a little too much for your first time.”
Harry stared at him for a moment, deliberating with himself. “Look, I’m only going to say this once, and then I’d give it up and let you make up your own damn mind. You can join us. I can’t promise you that going along with us will be much better, but I can promise you one thing. I don't only think of you as a victim. Never have, never will. You’re way too much of a twat to be just that.”
“I just – thought you should know – “ Lucius waited a moment longer, then shook his head. He opened the door, and in the split second before averting his eyes to the hallway, Draco saw actual malice in the grey. He had a thin smile on, the one Draco knew only too well, and bode nothing good. Then he looked out and saw the empty hallway.
He thought he’d given up. He didn’t. He thought that being ruined meant he gave up, that letting go of everything inside him was giving up, but it wasn’t exactly. Giving up was when he drank that bottle of bleach, but even from that he managed to bounce back up.
“Because you didn’t trust me enough to think I would stay,” Harry said, his voice tiny. “And you were right. I wasn’t strong enough. Not brave enough.”
“We'll make sure he doesn’t stick his large and greasy nose in your business,” Ron said, placing his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “That is, if you let us sleep a little before that. Come on, I’m beat.” Harry went up to his room after the redhead, feeling lighter than he had in many weeks.
“Did you?” Draco's fingers ran over the smooth edge of the bracelet. “Must be from when He was still living here. I don’t eat them, not ever. Well, not anymore.”
“Why did you have to do that?” he eventually asked, a long sigh of a question. He didn’t look at the shadow, only at the flowers. “Why did you do all that to me?”
“You’ve done well, Draco, really well. Nothing less than what I expected of you.” Two hands grabbed him in a tight embrace, and Draco felt himself melting into His warmth, the kindness of His tone. Paralyzing fear and disgust were shoved to their usual, faraway corner. To be forgiven like this was… he couldn’t even begin to say what it meant to him.
“He will not leave until he is satisfied. I’m afraid there really isn’t any other choice. You do know whom it is we are dealing with here – I daresay you know very well. You have shared much with me over the years, after all. He will not leave before he knows more, and there isn’t much we can do about him on our own. You will have to tell him - not about us, of course. About Azkaban.”
“Draco,” Harry said, appalled, horrified, and then as no words were enough, he simply leaned forward to hold him. “Draco, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry…”
“Look, I didn’t tell anyone, all right? I’ve not opened an official inquiry or anything. I just needed to – I mean, you were bloody dead!”
“You know, little Draco, it’s a bit rude you didn’t even greet us yet. I thought you were supposed to have such impeccable manners.”
“I thought nothing can scare the great Harry Potter,” Malfoy retorted snidely. “Not the Dark Lord, not his Death Eaters, and definitely not little old me. So what is it really, Potter? Because I swear I could feel you staring at me all through Charms today. Maybe it is you who fancies me?”
. After the third minute he was frantic enough to jump in front of oncoming traffic, and he wasn’t even outside yet, so he simply pushed the matter aside in his mind. Compartmentalization had been one of his most important tools of self-preservation for many years now, and it did not fail him this time either. Draco simply took to being glad Potter was there last night, because he was a little scared to think what would have happened if he didn’t come, and that was it. He didn’t think about it anymore. He didn’t think about anything anymore, what with the iron curtain and all. The day went on as if by him, and somehow he went through a whole shift at the shop without even noticing.
? Does that mean that something like this happens to Potter too? That he is also in his own way broken, like Draco? The awe in him was growing into uncomfortable dimensions. Soon he would have to throw up in order to make more room within himself for this wonder.
Draco shrugged, because nothing mattered anymore. His flowers were dead anyway. His father, if it even was him, was gone. And He was… he bit his broken lip. “Sorry.”
“Please!” There was no way to say what he needed to, and Draco was genuinely alarmed when he squealed, but maybe it worked; the fingers under his chin moved to cup his cheek.
And for crying out loud, this chat of deserve was driving him bloody insane. He could not think like that anymore, what he did and did not deserve, what was his due. It was too much for him, too much flesh-tearing, soul-gnawing, mind-fucking
“The one who raped you cruelly enough to make Voldemort look like a kitten? Yeah, I remember.” Potter looked at Draco’s hand on his knee and took a measured breath. “You don’t have to. You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to. I –“
They decided to take shifts, to sit with him and observe his reactions, two at a time. It definitely warmed his heart to see them, stepping up for him, caring enough to do this. It was very uncomfortable at the same time, and equal measures terrifying, and – well, there were just a lot of emotions in him right now, and actually, he couldn’t focus on any of them. He was too nervous about the bond. How would it feel without the potions, which he should have taken – Draco looked at the clock on the wall – three hours ago? What will happen to him? (
– made everything taste sour and terrible, and the herbs became a very unappealing green soggy mess in the pan. On top of it all, Draco added far too much salt, so in the end it tasted like a very salty, undercooked yet somehow dry chicken in smelly socks sauce. Draco tried to add more and more things to get back on top of it, but nothing helped. He added sugar to kick back the sour taste, but it did nothing but make it sickly-tasting. He added water to try and beat the far-too-thick cream consistency, but it didn’t mix in well and it looked terrible. And only about thirty minutes too late did he remember about the rice, which was a solid pile stuck to the pot and did not relent even to his most heartfelt, tear-stained begging.
Potter shrugged. “It’s not the best of places, no. But it’s close enough to work, or at least, to Floo… and I can’t be arsed to find myself another place. Not when Sirius used to live there, you know.”
“Stop it, stop hurting him. Please.” something contracted in Draco’s chest. He didn’t want to hear Potter beg. He didn’t want to hear him small and hurt and sad. If he could move his arms he’d cover his ears, but there was no need to, as magic pulled him up again and he was standing somehow. Without his say so, his left arm rose and settled like that, stretched forward.
Then opened them, because screw it. He was young, very recently out, and even if the bloody Savior wasn’t here, and Pansy was a bitch, and the music was questionable – well. There was a nice beat to it, actually. And some decent looking blokes, even if they didn’t have
” he dropped the glass with a great thud. His heart took the next step from his underwear to his socks. “But it couldn’t be, could it? The Dark Lord is dead.”
Suddenly the bells stopped. He hallucinated he could hear his name – it was his mother’s voice calling him, like she did when he was little. Draco smiled to himself, suspended somewhere between this world and the next, unable to move and confused out of his senses. He had no idea what was happening around him, but he knew one thing, and he knew it for sure; he was Draco. Always had been, and he will be exactly this until the very end. The fog tried to take it from him – this terrible week tried to take it from him – that atrocious month tried to take it from him – this entire
“No, but you’re looking at me like I…” he let his sentence hang unfinished between them, and Draco shuddered with how hard he tried to keep his mouth shut. It didn’t work.
"Fuck – that, Harry, there, it's... ah... hell. Will you put your bloody cock in me already? I think I might explode if you don't."
“So gallant,” he sneered, and gave him a very cold bow. “Always ready for the rescue. I’m forever in your debt, you complete arsehole.”
And nearly jumping back out. The room didn’t look anything like Harry had seen before; it almost seemed like a prison cell, dark and windowless and hostile. There was a chair in its center, with shackles around it, like the one he’d seen in court in the Pensive. On a table behind it was an array of – Harry quickly looked away, sick to his stomach. He didn’t know exactly what these devices were, but he was sure they had an unpleasant purpose. There was also a sneakoscope on the table, which Harry grabbed immediately for reassurance. it spun in his palm in a swift motion, making him slightly ill.
“But – I mean, I’ve been observing you for six years too, and I have no idea what you used to have.”
“Come now,” he rasped, but Lucius didn’t budge. Grove tugged once, twice, but still Lucius refused to move. With an infuriated sigh he pulled out his wand, which made Lucius react in what seemed a fairly mechanical manner – hunching his shoulders and looking down, he nevertheless remained very much above Draco. His face was still completely impassive.
This whirlwind of emotions in him was baffling. It was like meeting a long-lost friend suddenly, out of the blue; Draco didn’t know what to do with the lot of it. Before there was only void and emptiness and Him, and now – now there was void and emptiness and Him, of course there still was all of that, but also pity, and anger. Draco had no idea what to do with that combination.
“Where is she, Father?” he asked instead. He realized his hand was clenched to a fist around his wand, and made no effort to try and hide it.
Harry was completely at a loss. What do they do now? They have to get the others and get away. Perhaps telling Snape now would be the right thing to do – perhaps it was their only option – “Professor, I – “
Surprisingly enough, the shadow complied. Draco watched the image of the man he could never get out of his head stretch luxuriously on the grass, and something inside him hurt. He looked at the flowers again, eyes lingering on their brightness, on how vivid they were. How real.
There was no air in the room anymore, and Draco might have actually been dying all this time and he didn’t notice. He wanted to open his mouth to speak, but then he’d just end up barfing – silently he turned to Harry, pleading him to
The hours went by and he felt them physically on his skin. Every passing minute, the sense of all-purpose dread increased in his throat, and he had no idea what to do with it. He could not get rid of it for the world, and it ran dangerously close to where he kept the iron curtain. If that came crashing down now, he will be utter toast. And not the buttered kind. Or perhaps yes the buttered kind, buttered and with jam too, and then falling jam-side-first on a fluffy rug that just got cleaned. Draco let himself get carried away in his colorful imagery, grateful to have anything to think of that wasn’t simply doom. He had to be stronger now, because he was alone, and he would have to get used to that. He thought with alarm of the last time he found himself all alone. Then he thought with even greater alarm of the first time after that when he
“The whole bottle,” Draco confessed to his knees. “I could feel it… burning in my throat… it was excruciating, but I thought it will be over then. I thought I will be free.”
“Oh,” he bolted into sitting, appalled. His heart still beat rather wildly with giddy joy. His Harry came back to him. “Erm, right. Sorry. Let me just – “
“I’m scared,” Draco admitted then in an angry hiss. “Alone in that room, I’m – I can’t sleep, Potter. I thought that maybe you’d, er, let me… sleep here.” He swallowed heavily and waited.
“I don’t – Potter, it’s done with. You don’t need to get so worked up about it.” Because I do, enough for the both of us.
“I don’t know, wouldn’t want to get your hands dirty. Especially not the left one.” Harry started to pull his sleeve with his free hand, and Malfoy gave a palpable jerk against him, pushing him back and drawing his wand higher at the same time.
Not to mention it was Potter he was meant to talk to, Harry Potter, someone who knew Draco for most of his life and who didn’t like him even then, back when he really
“If he can’t get her out – “ Malfoy started, speaking very slowly and heavily, like he was forcing every syllable out of his mouth, “then I’d – I don’t know what I would do. But I would not perform the task. I couldn't. Never.”
“Yes. Torturing, killing, you know, dirty work. The Dark Lord very rarely gets his own hands dirty. Only when he is very angry indeed, or… when he has a special message to deliver.”
“You were the one making it better, not worse.” It could have been a lie, but it could have been the truth, too. It depended on which part of him you were asking.
“Draco, look. It’s not something I know how to talk about so well, all right? But let me guarantee you this one thing. I would never, ever, ever ask you to give everything up for me. That’s not what I think love is, anyway. I know you have… and I have… we are very different people, and we’ve been through very different experiences. But I don’t want you to choose me over anything. Hell, I’m glad you won’t. What Marvolo did to you, it was so messed up, just so warped and horrible and – I can’t even try to explain to you how different this will be. I don’t want you to be anyone else for me, I don’t want you to give me – and I’ll try to set a better example too, all right? I’ve been a little intense, I know. That’s on me, I have my own demons, you know that. But you can be certain that’s not what I want from you.”
“Harry, I know you didn’t want to hear it before, and I understand if you aren’t ready to hear it now, but you must know it is true. I care about you so much.”
open this stupid cleaning product, no matter how he tried. He spun and swung and hit and tapped and nothing, nothing,
“I can’t even… on my own…” the sobs were hard to contain now, and he knew he’s worrying Potter, but there was nothing to do about it. “I’m so sorry…”
to consider, so much to go over. There was Him. There was how He was – and what Draco did – and Grove being – and the whole entire thing – but going into that loop was too demanding, and he was so tired. Draco avoided it for now. He didn’t know if he’d ever be able to actually open it.
There was no way he could explain it, but this stupid, stupid gesture from an already exhausted Harry was the last straw. It sharpened oh so quickly the details of the situation they were in, the dangerous,
“I don’t know. Irony? Fate? A fucking slap in the face? A natural continuation of my ongoing humiliation?”
Walking to the store was an absolute nightmare, despite the fact it was only a quarter of a mile away. Be that as it may, it took him over thirty minutes to finally stagger through the glass door, heaving into the flowers and nearly choking on their intense scent. Somehow his flowers always seemed to be more fragrant than normal ones. Draco had no idea if it was something He did on purpose, because He liked the floral smell on him, or perhaps because He knew how sick their sweet perfume makes him. With some effort Draco washed his face in the little sink to wipe off the signs of exertion and sat down stiffly, knees still not on speaking terms with the rest of him. He had to stifle yawn after yawn - not exactly tired, but exhausted. There’s something about staying up all night prey to your worst thoughts and fears that left a man somewhat fatigued. Even worse, still; the tug in his abdomen, which increased all through the night, was about to drive him out of his damned mind. He couldn’t possibly take it much longer. He noticed his hands were shaking in his lap.
on top of everything, and his stint in prison left him liable for afflictions. Waddling like a bloody penguin, it took Draco almost fifteen minutes to make the distance, and he was sweating slightly when he finally got there.
“As a matter of fact, yes,” he answered without the slightest bit of irony. “I’m not going to clean other people’s filth like a Muggle. It’s disgusting.”
!” Potter laughed, a loud ringing sound through the silent kitchen. He wiped tears of mirth from his eyes and then sobered up, seeing how unamused Draco was. “I mean, not a full dog. He was fine, too, we had him changed back by the end of the day at St. Mungo’s. But he had a fluffy little tail and long, droopy ears and spots down his – Malfoy, are you all right?”
“Certainly, I am so sorry for what’s happened to her too. Bellatrix and Greyback and everything she had to endure.”
They ended up a little late for their reservation, but that was okay too. Harry skipped lunch, so he really was hungry – but he was absolutely insatiable for Draco.
"Malfoy? What the hell?” Potter was still standing at the threshold, one hand keeping the door partly open. “What are you doing here?”
“Try. To kill myself. It was a short while after the incident with the guard happened. We were – I was staying at this place, hiding, frightened out of my mind. Quite frankly, I lost it. Every shadow passing by the window was an Auror coming to take me in. Every sound was the search party for me. I knew that if I was found, I’d be taken straight back with no chance to ever… and I couldn’t take it. I found this bottle of bleach in a cupboard. Didn’t understand most of the ingredients – all that synthetic rubbish Muggles use – but I saw the skull, and the warnings. It said toxic. I thought it should work well enough.”
“No, no. I just thought… if you wanted… do you want to maybe grab a beer? We can talk a little more. I prefer to do it in a place where you’re not throwing these huge scissors in every direction. I can try to be less of a twat, and I promise not to ask about anything you don’t want to talk about.”
“Quiet, Teddy,” Andromeda shook her head, mildly amused. “I already told you, Draco lives here now.”
To imagine Him saying these words was almost comical. A great shudder rocked his entire body; Draco avoided thinking about Him for as long as he could, but sooner or later he’d have to. Time was still running out in his hourglass. At some point He
“Well then, in that case we should – “ some noises from the hallway outside distracted them all momentarily. Lucius quirked an eyebrow with suspicion. “What is this, Draco? Did you bring any more of your little friends?”
“Well, next time try not to die somewhere else, will you?” Draco asked and forced a tiny smile on his face. “Terribly inconvenient.”
“She was a very close friend. Someone I could count on. You may be surprised to hear, but I don’t have too many people like that to go around.”
Harry shook his head. “No. It’s – do you think they’d really kill him, though?” His shaky fingers pried the parchment from Hermione’s hold. “He said by morning. Are they really going to do it?”
“We have nothing in common, you sick bastard,” Harry retorted, because brave as he was, he was also a little bit stupid.
When his father came into the cell, Draco was already lost. He knew it. He knew he can’t stand it, and he knew he can’t give up. He assumed his father was there to try and convince him, since the clock now showed two minutes till go time. He looked down and hoped to somehow die before it.
Finally, with considerable effort, Malfoy raised his head. His nostrils flared a little as he faced them, hands still shaking on his knees. He seemed to be drawing energy from deep within himself, and unsure if it will suffice. “I…” he looked lost. He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths, steeling himself. He bit his lip hard. “I’m sorry.”
learn so fucking recently? Draco didn’t do this. It’s not like someone gave him a choice, it’s not like back during the war when he made the wrong one. He didn’t do it, this wasn’t his fault, it wasn’t his fault. It was Him, which – was possibly even worse, because He was everything, for so long He was
“I don’t know how I feel,” the voice was so low it was nearly inaudible. “I don’t know how I feel about any of this anymore. About my father, the Dark Lord, my mother, you. Nothing is clear, nothing is straightforward. It’s like the whole world tumbled down and fell on its head and I’m just trying to find somewhere to hold on to before I fall into the gaping abyss.”
“Not thanks to anything I did, though,” Harry’s hand moved faster through his hair. “I wouldn’t have made it out if it wasn’t for my wand. I just escaped by the skin of my teeth.”
He knew he should feel embarrassed, but there was only pleasant warmth inside him. “No,” he answered simply with a light smile. “You?”
“When we were cleaning with Filch, I accidentally… shoved him a little. I didn’t see everything, but I noticed a huge bruise on his chest, and one of his ribs was broken.” Harry said it all very quickly and quietly, looking at them sternly. “He asked me not to tell, so I didn’t say anything, but it’s really bad. And he refuses to go to the infirmary, and I have to know why. I think… I think Voldemort did this to him.”
An awkward silence stretched between them, and Draco knew he isn’t out of the woods yet. He could see the wheels moving behind Potter’s eyes, and knew he did not satisfy his curiosity one bit. Potter would still want to know more, and he will not leave until Draco gave him
“No,” Harry denied quickly, even though there really was no point. His stomach made that inexcusable growl again, and he turned a little pink.
There's a fairly detailed sex scene in this one. The gawky, awkward first-time type. (chapter 19, we've already had our fair share of smut, we're pretty much ready for this, yeah?)
to be a dragon. Too – what’s the word – beautiful. “I came to free the princess,” Harry said at long last, because he truly didn’t know what else to do. The man emitted a loud sound which, shockingly enough, turned out to be laughter.
Potter looked highly uncomfortable. “She’s… well, she saved my life, sort of. Back at the battle of Hogwarts, I’d be dead if it weren’t for her, and I was never able to pay her in kind. My testimony didn’t count for so much at the trials – you were sent to Azkaban anyway. And I just feel like I have to do this for her. Even if she wouldn’t know. Just to make sure you’re okay.”
“Draco,” he heard the soft grunt in his ear, and everything was falling into place inside him. This was where he belonged… this was what he deserved… he spread his legs even wider apart and pushed down, deeper, deeper, harder… The pain was all he knew, and the arms around him were more necessary than anything. Then He kissed him – slow, real, and for one glorious moment he was there, all there, held and cared for and maybe even understood. But when he closed his eyes he was back in the cell, and the body on top of his entirely different. Draco screamed, but a hand shot to his neck and he became quiet, whimpering slightly on the cold floor… on the warm mat… whimpering and moaning and groaning, faster, faster… It was almost as bad as he remembered, but still it wasn’t enough; he
"Why?" And his voice is beautiful and musical and angelic, if scratchy from misuse and just waking up. But then his eyes get wide and scared, and his hand is pulled back from my face to cover his own, and he's shaking and whimpering and I realise he thinks he did something wrong. He thinks he spoke out of turn.
"How often do I get to do it?" Get to. Get to, not have to, not like it's a chore, like it's something to look forward to.
"We're good." I turn to Neville. "Are you okay?" His head is ducked, arms folded around him. I must've scared him, bringing out his sub side. He nods, taking a deep breath. I sit next to him. "Relax, Nev, it's okay. I'm not nor was I ever mad at you. I'm sorry for losing control. I won't let anything hurt you." I sense him relax slightly, and he looks up at me.
"Eh, it's probably nothing. Merlin knows regular wizards can be oblivious. Someone probably made an offensive comment without meaning to."
"Whatever role you are, you will be happy in it, whether you believe it now or not. It's how your inheritance works," Mother says with a sigh.
Before I can even reply, you're pushing your way forward and taking control, almost falling to the floor when you do so too fast. In reply, Emma's Veela takes control too.
"We would love to have you, pup." The joy that fills me is one of the many ways I know that this, the three of us, are family. Are pack. "We were actually going to invite you anyway." I grin at them, pulling them into a three-way hug.
Bull. I don't need to talk to this supposed Uncle who I've never met. Father already trained me, and it's not going to prove I'm a sub because I'm not-
"My name is Harry Potter. I'm a student at the school. My wolf was hunting, we didn't mean to come so far in, I'm sorry to impose on your territory."
My mother and uncle leave me and Emma alone. She seems to have relaxed a bit, presumably because she knows there is no unmated dominant around her. Emma is pretty, there's no doubt about it. She has long, chocolate brown hair curled delicately into ringlets, and wide hazel eyes. Her skin is on the darker side of caramel and her frame is delicate.
"I- I need to ask. Please." And him begging is something else. He's so unbelievably submissive, and of course, he would feel more comfortable asking my permission to do things, he relies on me, I'm his dominant.
"Eli." His voice is practically a whine as he falls limping against me, practically melting into me until I don't know where I stop and my mate begins. He starts chirping as I start grooming my fingers through the feathers at the base of his wings and rubbing them down the space of back between them. He's mumbling something, over and over, and I realise it's my name.
You are yelling out the window. Calling our mate back, but he's not coming back, and I can't figure out why. He's our mate, he's meant to be with us always. But he's flying away, away from his mate, but that makes no sense. It hurts. You turn and punch a wall, hard. The wall is stone, and your skin immediately splits, blood falling out between the ridges of your skin, tumbling to the floor. Pain echoes up your arm, and I feel it, and relish it. This pain isn't as bad.
A howl sounds from somewhere far away, and I remember the kind of things in this forest, things I had forgotten in my misery. Werewolves, centaurs, and, apparently, chimaeras. The one in front of me must see the fear in my eyes, or maybe in how my body tenses and shakes, as it chuckles lowly again.
"Draco?" I nod. "It's no problem. You're my best friend, after all. You know there's nothing wrong with being a sub, right?"
I finish the letter, pleased with his response, both that it wasn't his fault that I didn't know and that he is willing to train me. However, I do wonder why my mother never told him about the bite. It is weird, as he said...
But it's okay. I'm okay. I don't need my mate. I don't need anyone, apart from maybe Blaise. Everything is okay.
"Are you okay, you're practically shaking?" You whimper. Why? He chuckled; what's there to whimper about?
"Y-yeah. Sorry for not announcing myself, I should've done that. Sorry." Zabini caresses Neville's upper arm, soothing him, whilst glaring at me. "Anyway," Nev continues. "We've just finished eating, so when you're ready we can go up to see Draco." I'm confused for a moment, and then I remember. Yesterday they said I could talk to Draco, make sure he's okay! I practically leap up from my chair.
“What are you talking about? Of course I wanted it. That’s exactly the problem. You only kissed me because I wanted to and you thought you owed it to me. And I didn’t even stop you, Draco. I wasn’t strong enough to do that. And now I have you sitting on my bed like a stupid prick and… fuck, I’m screwing everything up.”
He stared at the place where the door usually stood, pouting. A part of him was even angrier that they used this place against him, the place he loved from the bottom of his heart and where he spent most of his time with Draco. Don’t they know how difficult it was for him, to be stuck in the same room where he told Draco he loved him? where he made love to him? where he –
“Malfoy, calm down. Ron doesn’t want to do anything to you, none of us do. We know you're going through a lot right now, and we simply want to help you, like Harry said.” Hermione’s whisper somehow managed to be very warm.
“Draco,” He said, a warning edge to His voice. “Calm down. Your behavior is – frankly, rather wild. I would hate to have to take action.”
a door, suddenly, miraculously, and it opened. Ron and Hermione both came rushing from behind it, their eyes wide with concern and anger and sadness. “Harry – Harry, are you all right?”
Potter laughed uncomfortably. “Sure could have used him during the war, eh? Would have helped us beat Voldemort much sooner.”
Just as he anticipated, the room went immediately quiet. Harry made his way through the stunned silence, keeping his head down, most certainly not looking towards the large staff table. He somehow got through and slumped on a seat at the Gryffindor table, where people at least had the common sense not to try and imitate dead fish. He raised his eyes and found out he landed next to Neville and Seamus, who were both smiling warmly at him. He struggled to smile back. Around them Professor McGonagall began preparations for sorting, and Harry barely even noticed it.
“Yeah, right after the war ended I spent a few months at the Burrow. Ginny and I were still together, and Ron and Hermione were there too, so it kind of made sense. We all had this… I didn’t want to go too far away, you know? There was so much darkness everywhere still.”
“Will Master Harry want his breakfast served here?” a tiny voice asked and Draco jumped to his feet. He completely forgot there was someone still in the house with them. Potter seemed to have forgotten too.
Perhaps his heart yearned for something else, but the trauma in Draco was more prominent, and for a second he couldn’t even see the dark brown eyes above him. Instead he saw a blue pair, cold and metallic, and terror so deep broke in him that he began to weep. “Please,” he whispered, completely lost in it. There was no shelter from the blue eyes, from the sharpness of their gaze – they can see him here, they can see! But he can’t let it happen – he can’t let them see – he
“What?” Harry asked hotly, and he lowered his gaze instantly, flushed. “What is it? Happy to see the Boy-Who-Cleaned?”
“Cheers,” Harry answered weakly, and he took a big gulp when he saw the other boy bringing the glass to his lips. It burned him immediately, shooting flaming hot through his throat, and made him cough. Malfoy laughed again, delighted at his expression, and placed a hand on his shoulder.
“You know you could get a wand, right? That is, if you come back. You could have anything you wanted.”
“I missed seeing you in robes,” Harry agreed, chuckling. “Before we go, actually, I have something for you.” He turned to his bedside cabinet and pulled a rectangular box from the drawer. Draco recognized it immediately; it had Ollivander’s symbol. All the air was knocked out of him rather suddenly.
Draco ached to touch him, an altogether terrifying experience, but he held himself back tightly. He drew a very deep breath instead. “He knows. You’re not so great with holding your emotions at bay, Potter. Trust me, if you’ve ever looked into his eyes, he knew how much you cared. You don't need to suffer any more for it. You did so much already, gave so much, and you deserve to... You don't need to sacrifice yourself anymore.”
“No, don’t worry, he’s not dead or anything. But – he was attacked, and by Dementors, no less. The last time one of them attacked a Muggle was during the war, so that was… Draco, can I – “ he didn’t get to finish his question, since Draco collapsed on the floor before he got the chance. His chest was going up and down in terrifying speed, and all he saw was darkness. Gods. Someone. Please. Help.
The smile on Malfoy’s face seemed strained. “I don’t think I’ll be back to my serpent-covered house, Potter. Not in the near future, at least.” He heaved a sigh.
“Harry,” he tried weakly, but his words were drowned in the warm lips and all thoughts sizzled to ashes in his mind. Harry’s breath was whiskey, but his tongue when it slicked into Draco’s gaping mouth was coffee, and the mixture was baffling. There was nothing he could do but let it. So he stayed where he was, immobile, hands frozen in his lap, his tongue floating in the open space of who-knows-whose mouth, and now there was no stopping the tears.
Harry gave him no mind. He was lost in his own rage, it sounded like. “You did all of it, it was you who hurt him, and then you bound him to you – “
“You are everywhere I go. You were running out after me, just now. Spill it already, Malfoy. What’s your big plan here? Bother me to death?”
When Draco dreamed, it was always of Him. It was impossible to think about Him in the hospital room, where he was constantly surrounded by people asking him
The realization made him fall to his knees, yes, back to his knees, fuck him, that’s where he found himself. Because – because fucking shit, but the thrum wasn’t the bond at all. It was his own magic.
“Sure,” he breathed immediately. Anything to keep her away from him. And maybe he could take this chance to walk about, see if he can find Draco and Ron anywhere. He tried to keep his face blank as she gave him one last look and left, closing the door deliberately behind her. Harry waited for a few seconds, his breath hard and cold in his throat. The look on Narcissa’s face – he couldn’t get it out of his mind. Her eyes, almost exactly like Draco’s, filled with so much pain. What did they do to her? What did they do to drain her so of energy, of life? He remembered her in the forest; distraught, yes, but still elegant, filled to the brim with dignity. The woman he saw today was… not even a shell of her old self. She was still strong – he could see it in her. When she thought of Draco, she had strength in her yet. But other than that… he shivered when he pictured her face once more. It was terrible. Awful. Again he felt that bubbling wrath inside him. Why did Lucius do this to his family? He caused them so much pain, so much trouble, and for what? A chance of some power with his stupid Voldemort? This was insane. Harry wondered again where Draco is now and what is going on with him. Obviously he didn’t find his mother, so what is he doing? Has he found anyone else? Fear for him was bitter and burning at the same time.
a beam of light, and perhaps it only made the whole situation worse. Because how can he trust a light coming from the Savior of the Free World? Someone whose name was all in caps – irony aside that he never failed to address Him in capital – could never have anything to do with someone as lowly as Draco. Draco did not deserve it, and moreover, he didn’t want it. What he wanted was to roll into a ball until he’s tiny enough not to take up space in the world. And he so, so very much wanted to be seen and taken and cared for, at the very same time. Confusion practically oozed out of his skin. Draco did not want Potter to save him - didn’t think Potter can save him - already had been saved by him - would need to be saved again and again, continuously, until the end of time. The whole thing was as impossible as it was futile.
“Just a few things. Pajamas to sleep in, a few books, and…” he rummaged in the bag for a few seconds, then pulled a sealed bottle of flame-colored liquid. “Firewhiskey!”
“It’s going to be over soon,” a beloved voice assured him as a liquid was poured into his open mouth. “It’ll all be over soon. And we’re going to be right here.”
“Of course. I’m sorry. I just… they were being absolute monsters, and it wasn’t because of you or anything that you did.
. He almost never got to feel sorry, period, unless it was for the things he’s done and the person he was, etcetera, etcetera. He shook his head and, maybe more to distract himself from this train of thought, blurted the first thing he could think of.
, and it was so, so easy. Right now he could make him happy, and that made Draco sort of happy, too.
Draco felt guilty enough to be sick, for he was fairly certain he was the trauma she was talking about. “It’s – really? But what about the Statute? Aren’t therapists a Muggle thing?”
“You’d need a heart to feel sorry for someone else,” Harry grunted. “And to acknowledge that other people exist in the world, other than you. But you can’t do that, Malfoy, can you? You only think about yourself. Like in Defence class. The classic Slytherin.”
Potter was gay? “God, I keep forgetting you don’t read the Prophet and all that. It made some big waves, I’m surprised it didn’t reach you as well. Yes, I'm gay, and the whole bloody world knew that but you.”
“And I can’t tell you how relieved I am to have someone else who lo-“ Harry stopped mid-sentence, flushing a furious red. “I mean. It’s so good to have you here, Narcissa.”
, he thought, feeling his whole body relaxing into Draco’s warmth. The last few months were so hard. There was so much pain and uncertainty and loss, and at some point it seemed almost impossible for them to get through it. But now, in his warm bed, with the man he loved... The cheery Gryffindor colors of the curtains painted a pretty picture around the pale halo that was Draco. Even if he lived another hundred years, he will never find a thing he would like more.
“And I got them all,” Draco said before he could stop himself. “I didn’t forget anything. All of the ingredients.”
For a while, he just looked stunned. Then Lucius broke into laughter that didn’t translate into his eyes. “Be quiet, silly girl, and I might not let the werewolf tear you apart. Really, Draco, can you not at least control your little girlfriend?”
“All right. I’ll do it. If – you really think it’s a good idea.” He couldn’t stop himself from begging just a little there. It still seemed like a perfect punishment.
“I don’t – I never wanted to – good gods, Potter, you're going to get me killed.” Malfoy looked sincerely upset, his voice nothing but a little whimper, sinking in his stool. Harry almost didn’t have the heart to continue. He took a deep breath.
“I think it may be time,” Dumbledore said incredibly softly, as if he could maybe hear Harry’s thoughts, “for Draco to tell us what exactly happened during his captivity. That is, of course, if you are ready to speak.”
“You do have a choice,” she pleaded, to general laughter from the crowd of Death Eaters which she ignored with much dignity. “Draco, there’s always a choice!”
Potter wanted to kiss him bad. Every little drop of affection was treasured in this desert in his chest, and
The air was heavy with a sickly, sweet smell, and it took a while for Draco to realize there was something in it. Floating about, was it – feathers? He tried to catch one, but as soon as he had it, the tender thing combusted into flame on his open palm. Draco didn’t know why, but it made him infinitely sad.
"Will do. See you around." I let go of his hand, and head back to the hall for lunch. Zabini comes back about half an hour later, grabs some food and leaves again, probably so Draco doesn't have to come into the hall again. After lunch, the speakers say everyone with inheritances can leave, they don't need any examples for the next part of the talk and we know all the information, but tell us to go to McGonagall's office after dinner. I decide to go back to my dorm and take a nap. I'm pretty tired, and who knows, maybe I'll have another mate dream. Turns out, I was right.
Okay, okay, I understand. They're family, and that's important. I'm sorry. I realise the silence has grown thick. I wonder if my uncle is having the same conversation with his Veela. I try to work up the courage to break that silence. Somehow, when I do, the sound is more awkward than the quiet.
Because of who I am. And I know that's not your fault, but it doesn't change anything. And I don't want to talk about this anymore. As much as it hurts you, it does me. I yearn for my mate, more and more each day. The thought of going without them forever hurts me more than words can say. But I just can't bare the possibility of being rejected. It's better this way.
"Okay, that's more than okay, my love. Whatever you need. You have my permission to speak throughout this whole conversation, is that okay?" I nod, finally sucking in breath. "Good boy, you're so good for me." I chirp happily at his praise, nuzzling further into the hand that's still on my cheek.
"People with inheritances scent differently. Plus you can tell whether a creature is dom or sub by their scent. Well you guys can't. Other creatures can."
After the hunt, we head back to the den, and I have to address the main reason for me coming down tonight- I want to ask about my mate. They could be in this pack, but I would never know if I only met the hunters, who are all dominant. You almost push me to the front, eager to see if our mate is here. Alpha Cal notices I've transformed and does the same.
