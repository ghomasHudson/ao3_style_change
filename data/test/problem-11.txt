Harry stopped, and took Draco’s face between his hands. He leaned in for a warm, affectionate kiss, and Draco smiled.
“Malfoy,” Potter said, following close behind as if he thought he might be able to snatch the tray away. They were inside Draco’s sitting room before Potter realised that he had even crossed the threshold. “Please don’t take
“That’s very sweet, Draco, but the world doesn’t work like that.”
“Do you have to wait for a reply?” Draco asked. She was an extraordinarily expressive owl. Draco shouldn’t have been able to decipher ‘no, but I have to wait for a reaction’, but he did. He found a box of dried mice in the bottom of his pantry and passed her one. She looked unimpressed. He dug out his own supply of dried venison, a good snack for long evenings working, and she was much happier with that. Of course the personal owl of the Minister for Magic had airs and standards. Deplorable.
“I didn’t even say.”
“He will be.”
Well, almost everything. He maintained his own anonymity, but he did describe a famous Wizard who Draco had attended school with, and the terrible and wonderful realisation that his patient’s fantasy life had involved him, and the way he had… there was no other way to say it, but the way he had abused that fantasy to force Harry to recover. To his credit, Emrys’ expression remained utterly neutral from beginning to end, and he didn’t ever hold Draco’s eyes for longer than Draco felt comfortable with.
than Grimmauld Place ever had.
She listened and listened. All these events in Harry’s day, utterly ordinary and completely wonderful. Tea and cake and cats. No horrors, no responsibilities, no one asking him for anything — she felt a pang, thinking of what his life had been like for the last few years.
Harry tried to look annoyed, but he couldn’t, quite. “Don’t eat all the crackling, prat,” he replied, and Malfoy closed the door.
“And learned to speak Italian.”
Harry had neither the emotional bandwidth nor the attention span for creative work, not just then. He took up a wand that he’d been working on, probably the largest he’d ever made, and some fine-grained sandpaper. He already knew that there would be a shine to this wand; the wood was a dark red, almost black, and so beautifully responsive to his work that he could feel it hum with satisfaction under his fingers.
Harry slung an arm around her shoulders. The night was warm even now, and they were comfortable.
Sorry I slowed down -- I got myself sucked into writing another fic. I hope you'll read it xoxo
He paused for a moment, concerned, and then smiled to himself.
Ollivander took another sip of his tea, his hand still shaking, and set his cup down on his saucer.
“Oh. No,” she said. “They were unkind, but it wasn’t — like that,” she said, relaxing slightly. Though only for a moment. “Oh, Draco. No.”
“So what’s your diagnosis? Am I a danger to myself or others? Because really, Blaise —”
“No, I… yes, it’s very nice. I meant the room.”
“I think I failed to understand a great deal about that boy,” Narcissa said. “And presumed too much about the sort of man he might become.”
. I mean, what’s wrong with dating? I know how to do that.” He bit his lip. “In theory.”
the Potions Master.”
,” Harry insisted.
“Professor?”
He received a highly agitated return Owl from Hermione insisting that he let her come right away or she would break something else that no Minister for Magic should ever have threatened.
“No, something else, although after dessert tonight…”
“I withdraw my proposal. Next you’ll be asking me to comb my hair.”
Hermione cut him off. “You’re right. About all of that.” She placed Draco’s envelope on the table.
?” Draco sat up straight.
“I can tell, ‘cause you’re stonkered,” Harry said with a laugh. “Seeing your mum tomorrow?”
Harry and Ron and Hermione hadn’t waited very long before they started helping to rebuild Hogwarts, and there was something extremely satisfying about physical exhaustion. Hogwarts herself helped, of course. She wanted to be repaired, she just couldn’t do it by herself, so it was common to find that the stones that had been levitated into place on a destroyed wall would be firmly mortared into place by the following morning. A lot of the community came to help. Most of the Weasleys were there, including Charlie for a few days at a time before he started worrying about his dragons, and that was family.
“What happens,” she said at last, “when he sees you?”
Merlin’s beard, it was disgusting stuff. Harry thought for a second that he’d been tricked. Draco had, in fact, poisoned him. His only comfort was in knowing that he would die, and become a ghost, and haunt the git forever. The fantasy only intensified for the thirty seconds that his pain, nausea, and regret intensified; and then —
“You lost your wand?” Hermione said, sharply. They were both so used to Harry’s wandless spells, many of them non-verbal, that she hadn’t even known there was anything wrong with it.
Harry lifted a frame from his desk, and turned around, resting against it. He made a small, impatient gesture which made Draco’s heart flop suddenly, and Draco cautiously approached him, shifting alongside and leaning against the edge of the desk, peering over Harry’s shoulder.
“I really was hoping it would be a Howler this time,” Draco said coolly, and snatched it from Harry — because despite his insistence that he was not in the habit of reading other people’s mail, he really had no such qualms.
Hermione laughed. “I thought she looked a little more purple than the average. How wonderful.”
“It doesn’t matter. Molly. He’s gone. I don’t expect to see him again.”
Draco didn’t sit up. He mumbled into the table, instead. “When do you see it?”
would like, Mrs Malfoy? Something pretty that has caught your eye?”
for me?”
“Mm,” Hermione said, but her voice sounded troubled.
“I know. That’s why you keep buying me green clothes. I should never have told you I was almost sorted into Slytherin.”
There was a quiet rap on the door.
Harry hesitated. There it was again, something he wanted to say. But he didn’t.
fond. And I’m not saying that it would be easy for everyone to just forget the past. But Arthur is a very good judge of character, Harry dear, you mustn’t think he’s not just because he’s kind.”
“They do that, when there’s been no one home for a while.” Topher paused. “She. Not
“Oh — yeah!” Ron replied, turning toward the over-stuffed bookcase. The bottom shelf held several photograph albums, all enormous. He lifted two, and dangled them awkwardly, unsure where to put them. Topher took a satchel from his shoulder and held it open.
stonkered.”
“Dra…
“I have to go,” Hermione said. “I nominate you to do the washing up, and then you’re under orders to spend at least most of the day doing nothing at all. I’m very afraid Draco Malfoy is going to show up at the Ministry and hex me, and I’ll deserve it.”
“You’re not,” she said quietly, moments later. “It’s reparations. But it’s not what the family was ordered to pay… it’s everything they have. The vaults, Malfoy Manor, a Villa in Tuscany… another in France. Everything. Except what he gave to Andromeda and Teddy.”
She shook her head.
Harry snickered.
“Usually seven hours a night, and it’s good sleep. I’m not perched on a knife edge waiting for a disaster. I’m not waking up with my hand already almost on my wand. I wake up, I stretch, I yawn…”
“Of a sort. I understand what he’s done, now, at least, although I don’t believe he did it on purpose. But I’ll get to that. We’ve touched on this before, but I’m asking you directly, now. Do you think Harry is gay?”
Harry laughed painfully. “No. I’m afraid that didn’t really work out. I thought he wanted to come back to our world — but I was mistaken.”
“So much better than my imagination,” Harry growled, when he’d taken his mouth off Draco’s cock. “Fuck, Draco — I wish you could see yourself right now. Every inch of you. Unbelievable.”
“Er,” he said, as eloquent as he’d been at eleven.
“Er,” Potter said. It was gratifying to know that he had become no less eloquent in his advanced years. “Malf… Professor,” he finally managed to say. Draco regarded him with studied patience.
Draco gave Harry a hard look. The little girl, Draco believed, had been abused terribly. Which was something Harry might have some insight into, but she was still a patient, and she still deserved her privacy.
He had no control. His only hope was that Harry’s memory would be followed faithfully and that he would escape with the egg — but Draco had seen this. He had been there. He knew how high Harry had flown to escape the dragon after she had snapped her chain in anger. He had no control, none whatsoever, and it was only when his landing on safe ground once more immediately became a descent into the Black Lake that Harry — Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the Saviour, every other fucking name they’d ever given him…
He found himself thinking about the conversation he’d had with Hermione. About… dating. Fuck, what a terrible thought, but while Harry could insist to Hermione that he wasn’t lonely, he couldn’t deny it to himself. He was lonely, but the thought of dressing up and heading to a Muggle bar and finding someone to waste a few lovely hours with didn’t feel right.
“Thank you for your help,” Draco said, standing and reaching for his satchel. “I think I’ve been away from Auror Potter for long enough.”
century. No one cares. But he’s never talked about it, you know?” Ron had wondered, though. Harry spent most of his holidays with Charlie, and…
Narcissa sighed.
“If you did, you wouldn’t have to say so,” Malfoy replied, but he passed the juice.
“He’s an interesting fellow, your Harry Potter,” Topher said.
“Gryffindor git,” Draco said, in a stage whisper.
He nodded jerkily. “I’m not discussing it in here. Some patients wake up and repeat entire conversations that they heard while seemingly unconscious. When you’ve finished sitting with Harry, come and find me. I’ll have an elf deliver you tea.”
“Go and see Madame Pomfrey,” Malfoy said. “Go on. I shall pass a note on to Professor Saltzman to say you’ll be late.”
“Just a minute,” Hermione said, and at long last Draco relented, patting her shoulder briefly. “Thank you. You’ll never know how much… thank you.”
“Minerva, please.”
Also, he had been practising charms that could make him appear to be ill, because the weekend of the dreaded Malfoy party was upon him, speeding towards him. November 1
Harry felt painfully out of place, hearing such intimate thoughts, but he thought if he stayed respectfully silent, then that would be alright. Except the silence went on too long.
According to the roster which Hermione had made and stuck to the pantry door, it was her turn to cook. But seeing as Harry suddenly had the afternoon off — and would begin his apprenticeship the following morning as soon as he had told the DMLE that he wouldn’t be continuing his Auror training — he though he might do it himself. He hummed tunelessly along with the wireless and smiled as he chopped vegetables, pausing from time to time to pop a piece of something small and delicious into his mouth, or to reach into his pocket to reassure himself that the heavy iron key Ollivander had given him was still there.
“Your tattoos,” Harry said, kissing one of the dark tendrils which quested down over Draco’s chest to curl around his nipple. “They don’t move.”
“Master is home!”
“Mr Combefort,” Harry replied. “Is there something you need?”
“And here, I was planning to make you beg,” Harry said, clasping his hands behind his head as Draco started to kiss and lick down his body. It was much too soon for him to get hard again, he thought. Until Draco licked at a stripe of come on Harry’s stomach and moaned into his skin. “Good grief,” he muttered, reaching back with one hand to grip the headboard, moving the other back to the top of Draco’s fuzzy head.
“What else did you have in mind? I’m not sure what else I’m good at — I know I don’t want to play professional Quidditch. Molly thinks I should teach, but to be honest, I think after NEWTs I will need to give Hogwarts a wide berth until… well, for a good long time.”
“And I wished you’d been sorted into Slytherin, because I’d picked you out to be my best friend before I ever got on the train when we were eleven. And I envied you, and I admired you.”
“You underestimate the DMLE. You'd be surprised at what they've managed without him. And you work very hard yourself, Hermione,” Blaise said, reaching to take her hand, but she wasn’t in the mood to be reassured.
“He cared about me,” Harry said, carefully. “I know he did.”
“Turn the hourglass,” he said, and Harry did. “
She nodded, held Harry’s eyes for a moment and then shook her head. “Fine. Do try not to sleep in too much, will you?”
She smiled broadly and curtsied. “Master Harry. Lissie is pleased to be making your acquaintance.”
Draco bit his lip.
as if he would fit in at a party of this sort) and congratulated Neville, who had taken to begging Harry to help him practise conversations with Luna Lovegood.
“I miss him,” Harry said, at last. “We were getting to be good mates, and I’ve gone and bollocksed it — er, made a bit of a mess of things, really. Do you think he’ll forgive me? Even if I can’t — do the other things.”
“No, please, Hermione. I wouldn’t change a thing. And in the end, he helped me to come back. He gave me that choice and he let me make it, and I don’t regret that, either. You need to know that with all of this fucking garbage in my life, I’m okay, or at least, I’m getting there. And it wouldn’t have happened without the Mind Healer I’ve been seeing since I pulled my thumb out of my arse and agreed to commit to Draco’s rehabilitation program. And I sure as fuck wouldn’t have been able to do it without him.”
had drawn for him, Ron’s untidy lines and appalling handwriting corrected or enhanced by Hermione’s immaculate script, and sat down to study it, quill in his hand so that he could make some notes, and start another version of the map. He had barely started, ands considering a pot of tea, when he heard swearing in the Floo.
Topher looked around the room. He looked less like he was trying to find something than like he was taking measure of this and that, but what Ron didn’t know about psychiatrists… he didn’t want to ask, or disturb. He just wanted Harry back.
“Nothing. I’m talking to you.”
“I feel like such a mean old grown-up chasing them away,” he mourned. “Do that Quidditch whistle of yours. We’ll get them all heading back to the castle.”
“I’ll show you my collection, if you can keep a secret,” he said, and Draco followed him with some trepidation out to the shed where he kept his bizarre collection of Muggle items. The whole house seemed to breathe out once he was outside.
Harry and Hermione shared a look.
“Did you see the mirror?” she asked.
Harry wanted to argue, but he couldn’t think of anything sensible to say. He wished Hermione was there. She’d have said something clever and true and maybe made Draco smile a little bit. Harry had nothing. The silence stretched on, and on, and he allowed himself to glance at Draco from time to time, hoping to see something on his face which might give the slightest clue as to his state of mind. Nothing presented itself. His expression was cool and so controlled, as it often was, and Harry couldn’t feel his magic. He wondered again how long it had been since Draco used it, and why, and whether it could come back. Whether Harry could create the right wand for him. If it was an emotional problem, a physical one. So much to wonder.
“Alright — what
Draco felt his stomach heave.
Harry’s stomach twisted uncomfortably. “How could I be? I’m busy. I have you two, and Teddy — and I’m not a hermit,” he added pointedly. “I see my friends. Neville, and even your incorrigible friend Blaise… did you know Pansy and I have coffee together at least twice a week? I’m not lonely, Hermione.”
“I fail to see the relevance,” he said, coolly. “As you may recall, Professor Snape loathed Remus Lupin to the core of his being, and yet for the year he taught Defence at Hogwarts he faithfully and immaculately brewed him the Wolfsbane Potion every month.
“Fucking Gryffindor,” Draco snorted, and Harry chose to take that as a compliment as well.
“No,” Hermione said, firmly. She lifted Dora off Harry’s shoulder and kissed her irritable little face, before depositing her on the couch. She turned a bone white which matched the sofa beautifully, apparently preparing to launch herself at Crookshanks. “I want to come.”
Fuck the wards.
. He had begged off his afternoon and eaten a large meal, so that the weekend’s berries and grains wouldn’t sap him too badly. He read over Hermione’s latest missive. There were photographs, this time, photographs of the house, with the walls the right colours and the floors freshly carpeted — better than that, the rooms that had been abandoned and walled off in Harry’s head were now fresh and clean and new. Sirius’s room would be indistinguishable from the way it had been when he was a surly, rebellious teenager. The horrible tapestry, full of burned holes were the faces of unsatisfactory family members had been scorched away, was fuller than ever; Harry was there, linked to Sirius, and Teddy’s young adult face was patrician and kind. There was also a photograph of Kreacher, Binks and Malinda, standing tall and proud. Binks and Malinda looked at each other every few moments, unable to believe they were employed in such an important house, and Kreacher gazed proudly at the camera.
“Mum.” Draco laughed. “I don’t think I’ve ever called her that in my life. And no, I haven’t had any suspicious post. Unless you’d count a cashmere sweater from Belarus. It’s a lovely shade of green. You’ll remember I’m partial to green.” He enjoyed the way Harry’s cheeked burned. “Once a Slytherin, always a Slytherin. I’m sorry, did I interrupt something?”
“Dumbledore loved Harry,” she said.
In the moments he had for reflection, he was glad that every time he stepped into Harry Potter’s spectacularly fucked-up head he had experienced the same shoulder dislocation, because even though it wasn’t real, and wasn’t his own memory, it hurt like fuck and Draco’s belief that responding would hurt Harry more than it hurt him meant that he was able to keep himself silent. Through the dislocated shoulder, the smack to the back of the head that made him see stars, the slaps to the back of the thighs. And he was being tossed into what he had first thought was a nursery, but turned out to be something significantly smaller.
“It works,” she said, with a fond smile on her face. “In another year or two he’ll leave the department and we can go public. Not yet. Too much is fragile, right now, and people are starting to talk about Harry. His…
“When the war was over, and the trials were over, he left England. I didn’t know where. I wanted to know. I made some discreet enquiries. But I was in Auror training and I didn’t have a lot of time. Still, eventually, carefully, I found him. Studying in Nice, at first, where he finished his NEWTs.”
curse on her.
come back.
He cast a quick
“Are you alright, Ron?” Harry said, after a long and awkward silence. “If you don’t want another game, I can…”
They stayed exactly like that for several minutes, just breathing, enjoying the closeness, until Harry’s softening cock slipped from Draco’s body, and Draco started complaining about mess. In truth Harry would have been happy to lie in their filth for a while, but Draco looked like he was getting ready to fret loudly, and Harry thought it might be better to just head him off at the pass. A wandless, soundless
The bathroom was unpleasant. No one used this one, which was precisely why Draco did; when he had started confiding to Moaning Myrtle he wasn’t sure, but at this point in his miserable life she was the only person in the world who understood him. Who knew what was happening.
“Would you like me to come…? And…”
“Please, Harry. We can throw all of those doors open and let in the light. You just have to help me. And then you can have all the days off that you want.”
Harry laughed. “Oh, shut up, Ron. I came straight here. I’m fine.” Still unaccountably aroused. Still imagining that Draco had kissed him instead of punching him. But
, Harry. More than once.”
“Why do you use school owls?”
Hermione opened her eyes wide. “I can’t imagine what you mean.”
Mrs Malfoy raised her eyebrows expectantly and Harry remembered his manners, offering her his elbow. She nodded in silent praise as she slipped her hand around his bicep and let herself be led down the street. She nodded her hellos to many, stopped to greet a few. She smiled warmly at those who narrowed their eyes at her. Harry was impressed. She could have easily become a pariah. Or a hermit. Instead, she had already donated a significant amount of her wealth to very worthy causes and made everyone rethink her. He wondered if his own words at the trial had helped, and immediately felt like a wanker.
At last, they started coming out, with amplifiers and a drum kit and a tonne of things Harry didn’t recognise. A huge black tote bag full of… wires. Cords. There was probably a different word for them. Everything was piled into the back of a van with mismatched panels. Finally, Draco came out of the back door as well, a guitar case in each hand. He flipped the driver the bird, and the driver laughed, and the van was gone. And Draco Malfoy was lighting a cigarette in the rear alley behind a Muggle bar in Camden in leather pants that looked as if they’d been painted on. He dropped a backpack off his shoulder and fished out a hoodie that had seen better days, pulling it on without dropping his cigarette.
“I’m not interested in finding a bride,” he said. “I… Malfoy, I shouldn’t be here,” he said, urgently, and with so much regret, and the almost overwhelming desire to embrace his inner Gryffindor and snog Malfoy silly, just so he’d know once and for all. “It was kind of your mother,” he repeated, and tried to pull away.
. “There’s nothing to tell. Some drunk wanker decided he didn’t like the look of me.”
Which is to say it brought out the worst in him, which was one of the reasons he so rarely put himself in a position to be rejected. He’d never had a relationship that lasted for longer than six weeks, unless you counted the fact that two or three times a year Blaise blew through town and the two of them would spend a dirty weekend fucking and sucking in every conceivable position, location, and combination. The faint hangover from the intensive presence of a half-veela in his home was worth it, but the arrangement was no more romantic than the one Draco had with his hand. His hand, as well, while not remotely as satisfying as Blaise’s marvellously athletic and flexible body, was much more reliable, and there was certainly something to be said for that.
“My dear boy, unless you know how to turn the clock back, and make me young again, there’s nothing anyone can do. My wife is gone, my children and grandchildren have grown, and my great-grandchildren are getting there. I have far more happy memories than I do regrets — that’s quite enough to be getting on with. And what brings you to my shop?”
“It’s so good to see you happy, Luna,” he said.
“No,” Harry said, forcing a smile, and he escaped to the kitchen. Maybe some hot chocolate. He hadn’t had hot chocolate in a long time. Yes, hot chocolate. Except he also wanted to climb under the dining room table and imagine it was his old bed at Hogwarts, curtains keeping him in and everything else out.
Draco woke clutching at his throat, struggling to breathe, on his hands and knees on the floor. He felt rather like he’d been hit by the Hogwarts Express. He rolled onto his back, coughing and wheezing.
Except that he hadn’t been on his own. He was sure of it, now.
Potter had glanced back, once, with an expression on his face that simply said
“We can talk about it,” Draco said, his voice velvety and soothing. There were magic words. He’d stumbled on them before. “Harry. Darling. You can talk to me about things.”
“Is that a threat, or a promise?” he asked.
He wasn’t altogether surprised to find Narcissa Malfoy waiting for him on the front step, dressed in an almost silver fur coat, and with a pale blue shawl draped over her head and shoulders. The wards probably started a good distance from the Manor, for safety’s sake. She ushered Harry inside, and led him into not the formal living room but the
“And I’m the arsehole,” Draco growled.
When had he started to think of Harry as
“This is a book of Muggle child psychology.”
Harry had been cooking up a right snit, but it felt pointless, suddenly. He didn’t care about any of it; he was just happy for some good company in a warm pub. He was even happy to have Draco by his side, laughing and snickering and tossing out rude comments at every opportunity.
“No, stop,” he said, with a smile. “There is something I want everyone to understand. I did die. As I say; I died. I died, but not for long. I didn’t fake my death. I came back. And because of that death, I was able to conquer Tom Riddle forever. Some of you don’t want to think about this. You don’t want to think about the fact that Dumbledore, who so many of you have loved for so long, could orchestrate a plot that he knew would end in my death. But tell me; what could you have done differently? Do you sacrifice one to save many, or do you risk many to save one? I need you all to hear this,” Harry said, sternly. He leaned into the lectern.
Hermione felt her smile widen.
“I was just thinking that I’ve imposed for a long time, here.” He glanced at the window. The sun was beginning to set, but Draco surely caught his meaning. “Perhaps I should return to London, let you get back to… your life,” he said, choking a little on nothing at all. He knew that all that time spent with Draco had been in his head. That did nothing to make it feel less real.
“You’re invited as well, of course,” Bill said to Draco. He didn’t look up, though. Harry wanted to know if Draco was looking at Bill’s scars, if he was thinking about that night. The air could not have been harder to breathe.
Harry looked up, alarmed, deep shadows under his eyes and a guilty expression. “Hullo, ‘Mione… Minister,” he corrected, as she threw herself into his arms.
Emrys made a face. “You are hilarious. My point is — if you fell in love with that person, and if years or decades later you suffered a potentially fatal heart attack — would you want them to be the one to take care of you?”
“She’s not… not having another of those parties, is she?” Harry said, and Draco couldn’t tell if the expression on his face was one of hope or one of horror.
“I might try to get a couple more hours of sleep,” Draco said. He didn’t meet Harry’s eyes as he left. He slipped up the stairs like a sylph. Harry stared after him for what felt like a long time, thinking.
Kreacher was wringing his hands in some previously undescribed combination of happiness and abject desperation.
,” Blaise said. “The downstairs sitting room is a
“Did he miraculously wake up and ask for a cup of tea?”
It was horribly Gryffindor -esque, in Draco’s estimation, of course. Though his mother had managed to use the ruby tones as an accent instead of making it look as if a lion had actually puked up a spleen, the way the Gryffindor common room had always seemed to Draco. The golds and greys made up the majority of the colour scheme, actually, turning the remaining rock-hewn wall into a feature instead of allowing it to continue looking like a cell.
“Oh,” Draco said, pulling out a pile of files and pretending to look through them.
He thought he was alone, but when he sank down onto the end of the tiny, thin, lumpy mattress to give himself time to figure things out he realised that Harry Potter, aged perhaps six or seven years old, was sitting at his side.
“Could I convince you to abandon those files? You know I only agreed to give them to you because I thought it was the only way you’d come here to stay,” she said.
From inside the Burrow there was a loud crash and raised voices, and all three of them flinched. Family or not there had been too many months now of close quarters, frayed nerves and quick tempers.
Harry shook his head. “I’m really not. But I
“The year after the war, Hogwarts was closed for repairs.”
“You’re not going to argue with me, then?”
He thought about the nightmares they’d unlocked together. Sirius in the Room of Death. The fucking Basilisk. Harry’s cupboard in Little Whingeing.
“Well.”
Dream or not — Draco had seen himself exactly as he was. With Harry.
“And probably Pansy and Greg insisting on staying at the Villa.”
“Thank you,” Draco said, sounding strangled. “I’ll give that some thought. It’s a very kind invitation.”
It wasn’t really a question. Draco Malfoy was most definitely in his kitchen. His hair had grown a little longer, cropped close on one side. He looked slightly healthier than he had the previous winter, though that wasn’t a very high bar. He startled, as if it was Harry who wasn’t supposed to be there. Wearing Ron’s old jeans, and a t-shirt that threatened to fall from his shoulders.
“I know where to find you,” Harry said. “Come see what I’ve done with the attic, and then we can go and get pissed.”
Draco snorted.
Healer Thistlewish cast a quick diagnostic spell, and Harry waited patiently.
“Interesting,” Blaise said.
“Lissie is a free elf,” she said proudly. “Master Malfoy is making Lissie’s dress. Is Master Harry wanting a butterbeer, or a firewhiskey? Or some wine? Or mead? Or —”
“Oh,” Penelope said. “What a beautiful owl.”
, tying it to Narcissa’s owl’s leg and feeding her a large piece of fruit bread, before scratching the back of her neck just as she liked, and calmly returning to his breakfast of… salt, and grease, and something approximating meat.
“Not today. They’re proper grownups, remember, kids and all.”
“Have you ever heard the crazy rumour that I’m married to a vampire?” Professor Saltzman asked.
When Hermione was curled up in bed with Ron, in one of the newly-decorated guest bedrooms which was anything but dark, Harry lay awake and turned it all over in his brain. It did seem like a bit much, some days. His childhood had been a bit rubbish. (More than a bit, but it seemed to pale in comparison to the rest.) And then Tom Riddle — not being believed and being believed and realising that Dumbledore’s kindness had all been a part of leading him to die for the rest of the world —
“Liked yours well enough. Me, I’m all about brains, though. She’s the smartest woman I’ve ever known. Should’ve been in Ravenclaw. Should’ve been in
“You look slightly less like something a Kneazle dug up,” Draco replied. “My compliments to your stylist.”
“Ron, then. That suits you better.” Topher winked. “Heard that once upon a time, you and the Minister were… smoochy.”
Draco chuckled amiably. “What a sight that must have been. You know, I’ve heard things about being an Auror. Close quarters, high stress… romance blooms… or not romance, as the case may be…”
She looked so knowing that Harry couldn’t hold her gaze. He bid farewell and locked the door with a gesture, flipping the open sign to closed, and forced himself to take the stairs one at a time.
“Last summer when you got into that fight. I think — and tell me if I’m wrong — I think that was the last time you ever headed out to, uh, sow your wild oats.” She blushed loudly. “Did something happen, that night? I know Muggles can be…”
The black script faded, and in its place in a green script that betrayed a wavering hand:
“Pour me a glass of wine, darling,” she said, finding herself the most comfortable armchair.
Harry’s throat caught, and he found himself gazing at nothing at all, for a long moment.
“Unlike you and your dreadful Muggle relatives who didn’t even know how to treat family, let alone a guest, I have manners, Harry,” he said, pushing himself upright and almost floating in the direction of Harry’s quarters.
“I’m not building a tree house when they’re predicting we’ll have two feet of snow by the end of the week, Hermione. I love you and your healing spells but when my fingers freeze and fall off we both know you won’t be able to stick them on again.”
A tear fell from the corner of Harry’s eye, but when he looked up and met Draco’s eyes again, the expression was one of guarded hope.
“Yes, mum.”
“And will you be joining us for Christmas, Harry?” Arthur asked cheerfully.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. “I’d completely forgotten they were coming here, or…”
“Draco, stop.”
“There is a wide world of difference between me sharing information about his present state with you, as his medical proxy and friend. It is another thing entirely for me to share details of things that occurred three decades ago without his permission, when he has clearly chosen not to share them with you for a reason. I’ve said far too much. It was unprofessional of me.”
Except he wasn’t, at all, and he rather suspected his mother wasn’t, either.
He continued to read through the files, but Hermione had only given him closed cases, as he’d begun to realise just before dawn. The team had done excellent work in his absence. In fact, he wondered if his absence had been to their benefit. Without having him to rely on they had all pushed themselves harder, done better. It warmed him to the bones.
Harry nodded with a professional distance that Draco hated. He looked like he was having a conversation with one of his actress escorts at a Ministry function. Attempting to reach a carriage unmolested, perhaps.
“That’s it. Watch me. I’m going to take
“I can’t help it,” Harry said. “You look like you’re cooking up some kind of dreadful scheme, and I have to pay attention so I don’t miss when you start.”
“It’s nice,” Potter said, looking around.
had learned it from Ginny, which meant it was a good threat, but invoked mutually assured destruction. Draco hadn’t, though. Which made it hilarious in Duelling Club, and… and there he was again. “For goodness sake, Harry. Put yourself first, for once. Malf— Draco. Isn’t Vold–– Tom Riddle,” she said, leaning back against the couch, and rubbing her hands over her belly.
Harry was disappointed; he’d thought perhaps after a day like this one had been Draco might be ready to talk at last. Draco seemed to have a finite capacity for being around other people, though, and being surrounded by that much magic might have worn him out as well.
“Then why?”
“Veronique Pueplier says her daughter has joined your duelling club,” she said, when the niceties had been addressed. “I didn’t know you still had an interest in duelling, Draco — or did you agree for other reasons?”
“Ah, that’s why Hermione was demanding your wand when she finally laid eyes on me again — makes sense.” He sounded bitter. “She wanted to hex my bollocks off in a

it read. Harry glanced at Madam Shacklebolt, who nodded serenely.
“What you’ll learn is that children are exhausting. So go home, Harry,” Ollivander said, patting his shoulder. His hand felt frail, too light, as if his body was clinging to his spirit instead of the other way around. “Take a couple of days and come back on Friday. And don’t forget to lock the door.”
“Is he looking to have me strung up?” Draco asked, trying to sound bored.
Draco was quiet. Hermione wished he would ask more questions; she could feel the way a realisation she had been trying to avoid was beginning to well up in her chest.

“Are you Secret-Keeper for Harry’s house? Twelve Grimmauld Place, I mean.”
mean-spirited and insecure and who have family shrubs full of cruelty and madness. You had…” Draco swallowed hard. “Wonderful friends at school. So why him?”
Parvati stood by the door, her face impassive.
will be. And Harry — we’re sure as fuck not
He wasn’t at all surprised when the owl returned in the morning, delivering a letter from his mother. He slipped it into his robes and moved to unfold the Daily Prophet. He heard an irritated growl to his right, and immediately saw why;
Hermione was about to object.
“Oh. No, no, I refuse to think about them having sex, let alone kinky sex. In fact I have already decided that they sleep in separate twins beds and only kiss on special occasions. Because otherwise I’d keep throwing up all over everything and everyone for all eternity. Which I might do right now, actually,” she said, looking across the tables to where Draco and Harry were still dancing, as if they hadn’t noticed everybody else had decided their feet needed a rest. She made an appalled face.
He was dressed and ready for the dinner before Hermione arrived, in a rush, already tossing her shoes aside and asking about what colours Harry thought were appropriate. Harry was calm, though. Calmer than he thought he’d been in a very long while. He lowered himself onto the couch, and after a moment’s hesitation, swung his legs over it, stretching out, relaxing. He didn’t care if the robes got creased. He really didn’t. He grinned at the thought, actually.
“It’s a big house. I think you might need help. Perhaps there are two elves who would like to come and live with you there? There’s a lot to be done, and perhaps it would be better if you — if you had a staff.”
Harry was not expecting Prof— Headm— uh.
, Mrs Malfoy. Something I hadn’t thought could happen in a hundred years.” He paused to examine a strange bronze statue that was flexing its muscles and adjusting its hair. “It’s not something I’m prepared to risk for… something I know I’ll get wrong. I’ll do the wrong thing, say the wrong thing — I don’t know how to be… I don’t know how to
“Say it. Say you survived it. Say you want a lifetime, Harry.” Draco gritted his teeth. “Say you want a lifetime with
Draco’s worst mistake — or perhaps his most fortuitous one — happened less than two weeks later.
Black?”
She didn’t expect to see Malfoy — Draco — Healer Black being strong-armed by a pair of unfamiliar Aurors.
“I need a wand, so I can hex that shit-eating grin off your face. What will you do next?”
“Funny,” Topher said. “Figured the Hero of the Wizarding World would have been the one to get the girl. Cheers, on behalf of the little guys. Well played.”
“I want you to wake up, but I won’t blame you if you decide not to, Harry,” he murmured, as the sun began to peek over the horizon, pinking up the window.
“What happens next?” Harry said, forcibly uncurling his hands from Draco’s robes.
“You two truly are unspeakably bad at this,” he said, and served himself some more pie. “To tell the truth, I think you might be right. I had those parties, what, twice a year…”
“Goodnight, Potter,” Draco said. It was barely five in the evening. The sun wasn’t down yet. But Harry thought he might have been almost as tired as Draco.
Time to stop feeling sorry for herself. Hermione climbed to her feet, and opened the scroll of parchment.
Louder, this time.
They were silent for a while.
Mostly, Harry seemed delighted to have his Goddaughters back. They told a series of ridiculous stories, each tale taller than the last, while everyone ate takeaway Muggle Thai food (everyone present could cook, Harry being the best of them, but no one had seemed to have the time or inclination and Harry still looked incredibly tired. And when had he last cooked?).
“I need an elf,” he called, and with a loud crack, he heard two appear in his room. Two was even better. He spoke firmly. “I need you to bring Madam Pomfrey,” he said, nodding at the first, who disapparated just as quickly as he had appeared. “And I need you to summon the Headmaster.”
“Can you zip me? Blaise can’t exactly join us,” she said, embarrassed. “He’ll be there, of course, but he can’t… until he’s resigned… fuck. I need to stop taking third helpings of everything you cook.” She turned around when Harry had zipped the back of her dress. “Everything is so complicated. With all the fuss that was made of me being elected Minister. A woman, and single…”
Prats.
Harry looked around the workroom. There were things he could do, plenty of them, but he had learned to trust when his body felt ready to be finished for the night. It was after eleven, after all.
Draco laughed, and stretched his arms over the back of the sofa. “I’m surprised anything you come in contact with isn’t cross with you. You are, after all, the King of the Gryffindor gits.”
“That’s not what I mean, and you know it,” Harry replied, sounding almost prim. “I’m betting there’s some sort of Pureblood nonsense I should know about. You know I have no idea about —
Oh, this was
Harry sighed. “Or, I could do my best to reproduce her. I’ve been finding that sometimes, using materials that are special to a family produces extraordinary results. If you have more of these feathers… anyway,” he said, casting eyes to the ceiling again as something broke. “You might wish to think about it, Mrs… I’m so sorry, I really need to check on my guest. Would you like to take this with you, and discuss it with your family?”
Blaise howled with laughter. “Yes, but I think stepdad number three did as well. Oh, there’s a summer room off the side — very nice. Show me the bedrooms, then? It really does seem like a lot of work, all of this. Lovely, though. There aren’t enough of the really old Wizarding homes left these days.” He stepped into one of the larger bedrooms. “Fantastic. It’s much too big for one person on his own, of course,” Blaise mused, and Harry’s stomach twisted.
They sat in quiet contemplation for a long time. Harry felt numb. What little anger he had was directed inward. He should have known that Malfoy hadn’t changed.
Draco didn’t phrase it like a question, but Harry nodded anyway. He felt slightly better when Draco pressed a warm kiss against his mouth.
“There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you,” Blaise said.
“I mean,” he said. “I told you, he always has some girl on his arm for events, you know.”
“I’ll be cancelling your classes, today and tomorrow,” Harry said, firmly. “With the weekend, that will be four days’ rest, and then you should be alright.”
. Every
“I’ve been trying all sorts of things,” he admitted. “But I haven’t seen — are they special, to your family?”
Harry shook his head. “I’ve asked people to be respectful of my workplace. There’s still a few wankers around the place, but mostly, people do the right thing. It’s about the time we’ll start seeing first years coming in, though, buying their first wand.”
They sat in silence for a long time. Ron’s eyes trickled tears; Harry didn’t think he even knew, but they flowed, one after the other, healing and cleaning, Harry hoped. Corroding and burning was the less desirable option.
“Well. We got into Auror training, but at the last minute Ron decided against it.”
Hermione got nine Os, and Ron and Harry didn’t even ask her how she’d managed to sit nine exams.
Harry waited a few moments, and then sighed. He looked through his clothes. Draco had a good six inches on him, but there was a pair of jeans that Ron had left a few weeks ago. They’d be loose around the waist, but no one excelled at tailoring spells like Draco did. (Well. And Pansy and Blaise. Bunch of slick gits.) He found a white t-shirt that wasn’t too worn-out looking; this one was Harry’s. Although he couldn’t actually imagine Draco — this Draco, with his buzzcut and tattoos and makeup — wearing a cardigan, but Harry fished one out just the same, a warm dark brown, soft and comfortable. Socks. A pair of boxer shorts (luckily, he had a new pair that still had the tags — he didn’t want Draco shredding them in an offended rage). He left them on the dresser in the bathroom, along with a clean towel and a fresh bar of soap.
“Yes,” Harry said. “Fuck, yes.”
“Professor Malfoy,” Potter replied, nodding slowly. “Thank you. I’m very pleased to be here.” There was wariness in his eyes, but relief, as well, and in that passing way that Draco tended to pick up on emotions when he wasn’t paying attention (being distracted, for example, by a particular shade of green) he felt him relax as well.
“Are you sure? I know you’re very clever and sneaky.”
“Ugh.”
At eleven o’clock, Pansy came in with a promising-looking brown paper bag, and a less-promising glare.
“I hope I’ll see you soon,” she said, rather officiously, when she’d let go of Draco. He didn’t reply, but he looked, Harry thought, a little fond when he nodded noncommittally.
Hermione shrugged uncomfortably. “To tell you the truth, he’s never shown much interest in sex at all,” she said.
Actually, it seemed like a cupboard. Under a set of stairs. How strange.
They were settled back into their armchairs a moment later, Harry staring into the flames and Draco pretending not to stare at Harry.
“I love you,” he said. “You know that, right?”
Draco opened the door carefully, already beginning to smile.
“I’ve been in love with you since we were fifteen years old,” Draco promised. “It took me a long time to find a way to stop thinking about you.”
Andromeda froze, looking over Draco from head to toe. She glanced quickly at Harry, and Harry realised he had some explaining he would need to do. “Nephew,” she said. “I haven’t seen you since…”
The woman, Petunia, looked disinclined to argue, but glanced at the door of the cupboard. No one saw Draco. Which was a pity, since it meant he probably couldn’t transfigure them all into shoes.
“So,” he said, “what you’re saying is that it would be economically responsible of us to support small local businesses by going down the street to buy ice cream.”
“Fancy a pint?” he said.
She looked so careful, and uncertain.
“Fine,” Draco said, patting down his robes again.
“We did, didn’t we,” Harry said fondly. His shoulders had relaxed, and he smiled a little, and he took a step closer again. Draco stilled him, taking his hand, and Harry’s smile faltered.
He wished he didn’t recognise what he was looking at, but he did. This was not the old Number Twelve Grimmauld Place. This was the version that had only ever existed in his dreams, faithfully plotted out, wallpapered and painted, carpeted the way it had been carpeted in his most private fantasy world. Not just a house, but a home. And how she loved feeling like a home again; Harry felt the way her old resentments had fallen away. The bookcases were dust-free and the books looked as if they had been healing, too. When Harry stepped into the kitchen, he wanted to cry, a little bit; there it was in its glory, the size it had been when Molly Weasley had been feeding the Order of the Phoenix there night after night. He didn’t even notice the tears streaming down his cheeks. It didn’t look like it had even back then; it was exactly the way it had been in his dreams. Just… big. Big enough to host parties, full of friends, full of…
Draco nodded, and Harry began his story. It started on his eleventh birthday. It started with hundreds of owls and hundreds of Hogwarts letters and a half-giant with a very strange umbrella. It moved on, in delightfully muted shades of nostalgia and a feeling of adventure. Shopping in Diagon Alley, which Harry had been afraid might be a dream. Meeting Hedwig, who had looked at him with such disdain, as if to indicate she wasn’t sure she wanted to belong to someone she could carry in her talons.
Draco realised rather late that he was still staring down the dragon — and that he had raised his arm, and called for his broom, and then he was in the air, with his eyes on the golden egg down deep in the treacherous rocks below.
There was nothing in the world that made him feel freer than flying, or younger. He didn’t bother with caution; it was much more fun to hurtle himself high into the sky, body crouched low against the broom so he could pick up some real speed. Draco could scarcely feel his face, the air was so cold; he could, however, feel that he was grinning.
It was a maze, it really was. Harry knew for certain that he would never find his way around the place alone, but he had to assume he’d never need to. Many of the doors were heavily locked and warded, entire wings closed and when Harry thought about the things that had happened here he knew he’d never ask.
“No one in that house wants to see me,” Draco said evenly.
“I don’t know who you’re trying to convince of that, but alright.”
He plucked gently, and then began to play, something Harry thought he recognised from the Muggle radio station he sometimes listened to at the shop. He sang quietly, beautifully, and Harry wished he could go back to that first day on the Hogwarts Express and shake Draco’s hand, show him another way through.
Hermione bit her lip.
Harry woke in the morning with absolute awareness of everything that had happened. No long, slow moments before he remembered, no gradual recollection; he woke, and he immediately knew that Draco Malfoy was in his home, and that he needed help.
“What are you reading?”
“Er,” Harry replied.
Ginny sighed.
“No Malfoy,” Ron murmured. As if summoned, Malfoy appeared in place at the head of the grave, his spine straight, his eyes dry, and (one of those things Harry could have difficulty failing to notice, sometimes) his magic flashing and jagged in the air around him. The contrast between his calm exterior expression and his inner grief was frightening to see.
Emrys shrugged. “Still a lie.”
“Happy Christmas, Narcissa,” Harry said, taking Narcissa’s hand to kiss. He didn’t fumble on her name. He’d practised.
Draco closed his hand over Luc’s wrist, stopping him before his fingertips could curl into the waistband of Draco’s trousers.
“Headache? Stomachache? Are your eyes adjusting?”
Harry looked down at a second-year Hufflepuff boy with an overbite so severe he reminded Harry of Neville, before puberty had swept him into the realm of the truly spectacular.
as a way of tricking me into saying yes?”
His face burned, suddenly, as Draco raised his eyebrows so slowly that entire continental shifts occurred.
Draco pushed his hair away from his eyes. “Tell me a story.”
He took a breath. He didn’t like the way his tongue was tripping him up. He acknowledged his irritation with himself, though, and then he let it go. Dwelling wouldn’t help.
Somewhere along the line his feelings had shifted, blast them. And he’d found himself remembering how his parents managed his own small catastrophes. How carefully his mother had made sure he knew he wasn’t in trouble, the way she’d talked him through the mistakes he might have made. And now Amelia felt like —
“Well, if it’s just between us,” he said.
“Er,” Potter replied, staring at the bottle.
Harry didn’t point out that Draco had a lot more space in his own quarters; he just Summoned a small ottoman from across the room for Draco’s feet, which was oddly touching.
Molly was quiet, blending the pudding ingredients, and then she pushed the bowl to Harry. He wasn’t sure why she didn’t have the spoon set to mix the batter itself but he enjoyed doing it.
“Well?” Draco demanded.
“Humble,” Blaise exclaimed, glancing Heavenward. “Alright. I wouldn’t even be here, if you’d gone to Naples weeks ago the way you know you should have. You’re not waiting, any more. You haven’t bee for a while. You’re
“You really are prone to letting your sentences trail off.”
And they could be terrible. If he tried to extract himself from a situation he wasn’t comfortable with, they still sometimes shouted and called him names, accused him of thinking he was too big for his britches.
“He’ll be fine,” Harry promised. “Really.
“Really, Malfoy, I can do it myself. You must be busy.”
“The first time I was asked for an autograph, I was eleven years old,” he admitted, eventually. “People treated me as special. It doesn’t matter if I was, or not; it was just very tiring. He never thought I was anything special. It helped.”
Harry took a seat beside the bed and spent a few minutes just silently thanking Ollivander for finding him when he had. He hoped he had said often enough how grateful he was to the man for helping him to shape a life that was about creativity and magic, instead of violence and suspicion. He liked to think he had. He held that cool, papery hand and wondered how he was supposed to be feeling. Ollivander had been very clear that his life had been full, and that his only regret had been not finding an apprentice until so very late.
“Harry,” Ginny said. “Why is Draco Malfoy on your couch?”
“Yes,” Harry said. His eyes were wide and dark. “I’m not very good at this.”
“What’s it going to take to get you to use my first name?” Harry asked with an affectedly mournful tone.
Hermione felt something small and sure flutter in her chest.
“He laughs it off,” she said, staring at Draco’s bookshelves. “I swear, I’ve tried. He’ll tell me he’s planning to spend the day resting, and then I’ll find out he’s spent the day visiting children at St. Mungo’s, or helping Ron in the shop. I ask him if he’s sleeping well and he puts this big, blinding, Harry Potter smile on his face and he tells me he is. He doesn’t complain. He never looks sad, or angry, or…”
“I’ll leave whenever you want me to.”
Hermione frowned, and nodded.
Neville shifted in his seat.
“You just wait until I’ve had some sleep. I owe you more loaded banter than I can properly calculate right now.”
Harry had long since given up trying to guess how old people were. The more powerful seemed to age incredibly slowly. If Madam Shacklebolt had told him she was a hundred years old, despite the barest hint of crows feet at her eyes Harry would not have batted an eyelid.
was. And he had excelled.
Harry’s hair curled at the nape of his neck, thick and dark, but his eyes tightened into crows’ feet in the corners and his mouth was set in a tight line.
“I don’t think I’m ready,” Harry said, staring into the middle distance. He didn’t respond to Draco’s touch, his eyes, the kiss to the hinge of his jaw. He just stared at nothing.
He was suddenly embarrassed. Something about the expression on Ollivander’s face.
“Narcissa Malfoy,” she said, ever polite. “I’m not sure we’ve met.”
“I have over a week to practice being that version of myself,” Harry said. “I’ll be fine, and you don’t get to ask me again.”
“Too little,” Draco said, dully. “And too fucking late by half.”
And he wanted more.
“We can go home, Harry. We can. There’s just one thing left to do.”
He looked over the map for a few more minutes. No way to know if he could choose one just yet, but he wanted to remember as much as he could about the rooms in the real house, so that he might be able to anticipate what the house in Harry’s mind might be concealing.
He leaned his elbows on the railing, and Blaise rested his arse against it, rubbing his hands together to keep them warm.
“How do they do it? How have thousands of parents — every year! — Just, goodbye, we’ll see you at Christmas. And now he has his Sorting, and what if he’s afraid?” Harry and Andromeda looked at each other a moment and then forced themselves to stop. After weeks of the two of them being upset at the idea of Teddy heading off for his first year and Draco declaring them both utterly pathetic, here he was with his nose running.
“Do you love me enough to live?”
“Potter,” Draco corrected. “And don’t pretend you know things you don’t, Blaise.”
“No, thank you. I don’t want to.”
“He agreed?”
“Blaise likes anyone who can hold their own in a battle of wits and fill out a pair of jeans. Really, Hermione — stop this. It’s all fine. I have no interest in dating Blaise Zabini, quarter-Veela, or anyone else, for that matter.”
“I need to take steps to get him out of there. I have perhaps two or three courses of action, but only one which I think is… safe. Or near safe.”
On the other end of the bench, Blaise laughed, and tossed his head over the back of his neck. “You’re an odd one, Harry Potter,” he said. “And please don’t tell Hermione about this. She has nothing to do with it, and she’s a hair puller.”
At school, though Harry had barely known Blaise except to see him, he had always held a smug expression; one-quarter Veela, as they said, always draped in attractive prospects, generally difficult to pin down by all accounts. But smug is not the same thing as confident, and Harry knew the difference.
Pansy narrowed her eyes again. She was probably trying to look cross, but only succeeded in looking worried. “How convenient.” She huffed, and then her expression softened. “Or not. Harry, did he…
“We’ve just got two more songs left for yeh,” the singer said, and Harry noticed the Scottish brogue he didn’t seem to sing with. “And we’ll let yehs be, right. This is Mikey on skins, Penny on bass, Draco on guitar and I’ve been Jackson. We’ve been the Burnt Lips.”
and then he was gone.
But it was. “No. I should have known.”
“If the Weasel can behave, so can I.” Draco turned, then. Snow had caught in Harry’s hair, and on the shoulders of his robe. “I could even learn his name, if I put some effort into it. Write it on a bit of parchment for me and I’ll look at it each day,” he said, reaching out to run his fingertips over Harry’s shirt where his robes parted. He met Harry’s eyes, wide and green and hungry. “I didn’t say this would be easy. Or that we’d figure everything out overnight. Your question has to be, is it worth it? Tell me, Harry — do you want me?”
Or rather, here was another part of Draco that was afraid — much more afraid — that they’d never get a chance to figure out if this thing, this mad, passionate thing that had been almost thirty years in the making might work in the real world. Draco could be selfish. He knew that, and it didn’t bother him. He wanted this, wanted Harry, wanted to make love the way they had in the pretty bedroom upstairs and make plans and tease each other until they were old men.
Malfoy’s lip curled in irritation, but when he opened his eyes, his look was one of relief.
“But that’s all PR nonsense. I used to be friends with one of the most famous opera singers in Italy, you know. She was a
“Harry Potter,” Pansy kept saying. She was full to the eyeballs of her own whiskey, and, Hermione hated to notice,
“No need. I walked by there this morning and the place is open. Just go. Tomorrow, we’ll test the fitness of your new wand and you can start again. Well, Mr Potter? Are you waiting for a hand-embossed invitation? You don’t impress me, you know. I know you’re good. But shortcuts get people killed, and I won’t offer you shoddy training just because you got lucky.”
Hermione was lost in thought for a long time.
“I don’t know,” Draco said.
“Oh, Harry…”
“— My son is not an easy man to love. Nor was his father. But I loved him. Even when he was terribly wrong, I loved him. I wanted to leave, once — I believed the Dark Lord was…”
“And my ruddy jeans,” Ron groused.
“Are you enjoying Auror training, dear boy?”
. It was surprisingly comfortable and while far from shabby, it was worlds away from the cool, threatening air of the rest of the manor. Harry felt at home immediately. And he really, really wished he didn’t. This room was like Draco’s rooms in the castle, he realised. He’d never quite noticed before that although the furniture was of good quality, it was also comfortable.
“Thank you for,” he said, gesturing at the curse box, and the phial full of filthy, greasy magic. “I didn’t mean to be rude about your room.”
There was something else about the shop, too, something Harry hadn’t anticipated.
It was, for all intents and purposes, a birthday party, and it was a fine evening indeed. Ron and Hermione came, Hermione heavy with her second pregnancy and Ron loudly proclaiming that she would be the youngest ever Minister of Magic by the time the kid could roll onto its belly. Neville, who had offered to help Harry bring his things to Hogwarts — he had taken over as Professor of Herbology eight years prior. Ginny couldn’t make it. As the Captain of the Hollyhead Harpies she was too close to finals to take time off, but she did make an appearance in the fireplace, to everyone’s delight. Luna, who had taken over as the editor-in-chief of the Quibbler (circulation had grown rather a lot since she had proven the existence of various previously denied species).
. Blaise wasn’t sure that his own mother had ever been happy. As dedicated as she was to hedonism, she had never been happy, and Blaise hadn’t been happy until he turned away from all of that.
“On second thought, it’s probably simpler to simply Owl for them. Leave your supplies to the students. Goodnight, Malf… Prof…”
“No you fucking don’t, you self-sacrificing Gryffindor martyr, you utter
“You were. You are,” Hermione said, and they spent a long time clinging tight to each other, before Ron pulled away with a shy smile and disappeared into the green flames. After a final look around Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, Hermione followed suit.
Harry looked at his glass, still smiling, and then raised it to his lips. He took a deep drink, and rested it back on the sturdy walnut countertop.
Luc narrowed his eyes.
. It’s this thing you have where —”
“Of course you can.”
Ron relaxed a little more, and Topher topped up their mugs.
to embracing it. But he was, now — to borrow a Muggle expression — living his best life.
Harry decided to walk back to Grimmauld Place, and stopped on the way to collect some branches that had been blown off the trees in the nearby park. Grimmauld Place was coming along very nicely. Not finished, but it was hard to believe she was the same house that she had been when they’d first taken refuge there after Bill and Fleur’s wedding. She seemed to be responding beautifully to their intentions for her, the windows growing slightly to let in more light and air, the ceilings getting higher. The kitchen was back to being enormous, and the three of them had decided only this week that they would have a big party soon, invite all of the old gang to join them. Harry liked bringing natural wood into the place. The house seemed to know how to let it be shaped into skirting boards, and absorbed into failing window frames, and he was beginning to get a feel for the wood. He liked the way it hummed in his hand.
When they were aching and exhausted and energised, Hermione stretched and slung her arm across Blaise’s stomach.
She sighed, and picked vegetables out of her noodles. “You stopped going out. And I know I wasn’t the most supportive of you just… shagging random Muggle boys…”
“Then you’ll go to Ollivander’s in the morning, Harry,” Hermione said.
“Thank you,” she said. “For telling me all of that.”
Harry wordlessly conjured some lube on his fingers, and nudged Draco’s thigh; he seemed to get the picture very quickly, and threw one long leg over Harry’s shoulder, angling his hips just slightly so that Harry could get at his tight little hole.
“It’s not like he ever dated a bloke,” he said carefully. “But I wondered.”
Draco pretended to be embarrassed, and nodded, and Auror Lisbon laughed. “Can’t blame you, mate. No one could.”
“You want
“You just need to give it a little wave,” he said, and she did, causing a sudden hot wind to wind through the shop. “Perhaps not. Alright, try this one.”
Trying to ease his conscience, of course.
“I hate being an adult,” he confided to the rough oak. “Don’t you miss being petty, Neville?”
Until eighth year at Hogwarts. And that didn’t bear thinking about.
under his breath. He didn’t miss the way Draco closed his eyes. He probably wasn’t upset that the mug was fixed. It had to be the mirror. Harry took a blanket from the closet and covered it up, using a sticking charm to make sure it stayed that way. He picked up the mug, and vanished the spilled coffee before it could mark the floorboards.
Hermione dropped her face into her hands, and sobbed.
“You got much, much better at sarcasm.” Harry raised a hand and Hermione offered him a listless high five. “So, it’s the next big adventure, right?”
“Can I help you, sir?” the shopkeeper said, emerging from between two aisles.
“Only three, then.”
And there it was, quite suddenly. Here in the clearing, there were dark stones and about a million flowers budding and ready to bloom. It was pretty — actually, it was very pretty. It was…
Granger sniffed. “I believe it was his day off.”
As soon as the classroom door closed behind them, Draco collapsed in a heap on the ground, tears streaming from his eyes.
“Worse than dying?”
In retrospect, she realised he had probably spent most of his life trying to prove he wasn’t the person he had been in that moment.
Draco looked up, and Parvati met his eyes.
They hadn’t laid eyes on each other since Harry had spoken for her at her trial. “Mrs Malfoy,” Harry replied, offering Draco’s mother — his
“It’s not torture. It’s
“Sold,” Pansy said, opening her money bag to count out Galleons. “Listen, Potter — since I’m here anyway. I was wondering if you know where Draco is.”
“Shut up,” Draco said sweetly.
“Thank you, Malfoy,” Harry said, teeth clenched together, not actually snorting smoke like a dragon but near enough. He turned back to Narcissa. “I apologise, Mrs Malfoy. It does look much better. Very nice. I’ve never been very good at…”
On his desk was a small pile of birthday presents.
Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes — after the honesty they’d survived the night before he might have imagined that Hermione could find her way to trusting him, but apparently his optimism was unfounded.
“Perhaps a little.” He shrugged. "Yes."
“It’s too cold for ice cream,” Harry insisted. Teddy weighed a tonne. Four years old — it was hard to believe. Harry put him down.
Blaise raised his eyebrows. “Harry, is it?” He shrugged. “I’m not shocked.”
Molly gave him a firm hug. It took Harry back to the very first time she’d done it. The first time he’d learned what a really motherly hug was like. “Thank you. For everything. Including that. And so’s you know, I decided that this year my resolution would be to see if I can find myself a nice bloke to settle down with. And before you ask — yes, that includes letting you set me up with your friend’s brother’s nephew, or what have you, alright?”
“Healer Thistlewish. Do you have news?”
Harry was so stunned by the question that he immediately stood up, wand in hand, looking around at everything of value he owned. Mad-Eye’s old foe glass, milky with age, alongside the new one that Ron and Hermione had given him for his birthday. His broom; it had been a while since he flew it, but it was the very latest, a rare indulgence. His cabinets were locked, and they were warded, and if anyone was daft enough to try to rob an ex-Auror they were in for a terrible shock. He tucked his wand away in the pocket of his robe.
Hermione laughed, and Blaise wrapped an arm around her shoulders and kissed her hair.
“Oh,” Harry said, embarrassed again. “You know about —”
Neville sighed, and nodded into his ale.
“It’s my job, Potter. I
“But I do,” he replied, confused. “You know me better than anyone. Better than Ron does, really.”
The base?
“Yes, Harry. What’s this all about?”
He didn’t let himself wonder if without Harry’s stupid famous shadow over him he’d have far more chances to shine. He did let himself remember all the nights where Ron had patiently tried to teach Harry a more strategic approach to chess, and Harry had gone dizzy, continuing to alternate between aggressive and defensive play without any kind of long term strategy.
“D’you want to see? What it was like? He didn’t want to do it, you know. When he realised what was happening in your head. He showed me a memory in my pensieve, and told me I had to decide if it was alright for him to… I can show you, Harry. What he was like, when he started to think he couldn’t wake you ever.”
“You’re sorry the most chaste dance ever invented by Pureblood wizards got you hard, Potter?” He didn’t wait for a reply, just took another step nearer. Harry wanted to step back; this close, the height difference made him uncomfortable, and too warm, and somewhat inclined to disapparate again.
Perhaps Draco didn’t have Harry’s memories of… however long he’d been imagining this. Of daytime fantasies in the shower, or particularly enjoyable dreams (and what a mindfuck that was, the thought of Harry waking with his hand closed tight around that enormous prick of his and thinking about Draco, before he put on his ugly Auror’s uniform like a proper adult and heading to work), but he knew men. He knew men’s bodies, and desire, and he knew that Harry sodding Potter wanted to be held down and fucked until he was seeing stars.
“We’ll know what to do next when that time comes, Draco. I love you. The rest is details.” His expression was so tender and so sure that Draco’s throat ached. Their foreheads rested together, and Draco enjoyed the heat of Harry’s body, soaking it up.
Jake Combefort, unquestionably one of the brightest students in Harry’s fifth-year class, with his shiny black skin and his red-headed mortal enemy in Slytherin, looked over his shoulder. There were a number of students standing behind him, including the aforementioned nemesis, and another dozen or so a little closer to the door, wary. They were from all four houses, which made Harry feel both unreasonably pleased, and slightly concerned.
He intended to call out, but his voice seemed to drop just an inch from his lips, and the name disappeared into the night. Draco was trembling, his head aching. How he had envied Harry. How they had all resented him. He saw Ron’s betrayed expression in his brand new memory and wanted to slap it from his stupid face, before he remembered that he’d been so much fucking worse, so full of resentment that he’d spent hours making those stupid pins that read ‘Potter Stinks’.
“How many hours did you spend spelling those flashing badges?” Draco flushed. “And did you make your own Dementor costume, or did you have it made at Madame Malkins’?”
“Usually,” Luna agreed. “You’re amazing too, you know. I’m glad you quit your job. Your aura has looked like a tight golden shell for the last few years. It’s not good to be so closed off. You never know what you might be missing. And look, you have a butterfly on your wrist, now. A butterfly wouldn’t land on a tight golden shell.”
The day felt unbelievably long. Unfathomably. Harry gave up on his wand-making pursuits before lunch, knowing full well his energy was too scattered to really understand what the raw materials were trying to tell him. But the shop was quiet, and all Harry could really do was try to read, and listen — hard — to his rooms above the shop, wondering if Draco would come down when he was ready to talk, or if he’d climb out a window and disappear again. Or if he might be upstairs waiting for Harry just as Harry was downstairs waiting for him.
Draco nodded, mentally noting the locations in his head, and snickering quietly at Hermione’s cautious tone.The next line was significantly more difficult to decipher.
“Don’t talk about him that way.”
“You only love me for my cooking,” Harry teased. “D’you know, I had such fun cooking dinner tonight. Remember how I used to do that all the time?”
“What on earth — but Dra…
There was a lot of chatter as the students moved around, some excited, some angry, all at least a little bit intrigued. A few students ended up sitting next to someone they well and truly loathed. Two boys in the middle of the classroom, one in Gryffindor robes and one in Slytherin sat with their chairs as far apart as they could manage it, looking murderously at Harry. The Slytherin boy had hair red enough so that he had to be related to the Weasleys one way or another, and the Gryffindor boy had skin such a dark black it shone under the candlelights.
In this particular case, he had known Draco — Christopher Black — for long enough so that they were friends, as well.
“I should get some sleep,” Harry said, placing the frame back on the desk and avoiding Draco’s eyes. Draco glanced at the clock. It was barely eight o’clock. He didn’t want to go. He wanted to hear things. In the most terrible way. He wanted to hear stories. About Sirius Black, his rebellious uncle. About the year Harry and Granger and the Weasel were off searching for Horcruxes. About his mother, whispering to Harry in the forest, wanting — needing — to know that Draco was still alive. He wanted to tell Harry what it had felt like when he realised that Harry was going to save him from the Fiendfyre. He wanted to hear about Harry’s godawful Muggle family, and feel angry about their abuse, and tell him so.
Hermione snorted, and stood up. “I think I need a break from all of this,” she said. “Can someone please sneak something starchy into Pansy’s mouth while her mouth is hanging open?”
He ignored the curious expression on Draco’s face and busied himself with the bacon instead.
to. He dropped the potion onto Harry’s tongue, and then his own. He stretched out on the bed, and slipped his fingers, vibrant and wanting, into Harry’s fingers, cool and slack. And then he closed his eyes.
,” Draco scoffed. He levitated the platter onto his bedside table, and climbed over Harry, straddling his hip, slowly rocking against him until Harry was getting hard. “You still have a great deal to learn about me, Harry Potter. Boy Who Fell Asleep.”
“Harry is a superb Occlumens.”
Harry fussed in the shop, looking up every time he heard a single sound. People would be buying Christmas gifts here soon. His tiny kneazle-whisker wands for children too young for a proper wand yet but who would delight at the trails of sweet-smelling sparks the wands trailed in their wake. Wand stands for heirlooms, polishing cloths, the other small items Harry had begun to include in the shop to keep people coming in throughout the year.
No. Scratch that. Empathy.
“What will you do with the place?” he asked. But Kingsley was already calling for his assistant to make arrangements.
apprenticeship?”
“I’m going to suck you,” Draco murmured. “Until you’re hard as diamonds again. And then I’m going to ride your cock. I’ll do all the work. You just lie there and enjoy the view.”
“Indeed,” Snape replied, adjusting his robes with an expression of boredom.
“I have to go,” Draco said. “Walk around. See if there’s anything I might have missed. Or rather, anything Harry might have. A hidden passageway, a concealed trap-door. A sodding wardrobe.”
“And every week after that,” she growled, grinning ferally. “You just see if I’m not.” She threw her arms around Harry as well, and he wished momentarily that he ever paid any attention to the calendar that Hermione painstakingly updated for him whenever she came by.
. A party. So? Harry had been to parties before.
“Did you hear me screaming and crying?” Hermione replied, with her own smile, raising an eyebrow.
Draco snickered, and shook his head. “Tell me.”
Malfoy tightened his hand around Harry’s, and tensed, beginning to open his eyes. Harry waved his wand lazily and the chair began to straighten into a chair again; still lazy and easy, but not longer flat for sleeping.
Draco didn’t answer, just kissed him, and Harry decided that was as good an answer as any, for the moment. He snapped his hips, and Draco moaned loud and long. His eyes seemed to spark when he looked at Harry again.
That it had become impossible, by the time he was seventeen, to ever be anything but the Boy Who Lived. His destiny seemed to be set in stone, and he lacked any kind of adult who he may have been able to talk about it with in depth. He had been fighting since before he’d had hair under his arms and it seemed inevitable that he would fight for his entire life. Never mind that it still seemed to be leeching life from him every day, and had done for years.
After a little while, Draco sat beside him carefully, and reached for a bowl, spooning a little of everything into it.
Harry blinked several times. What had Malfoy been looking for?
The following day, Hermione told Auror Robards that Harry had returned to England. It was an idiotic thing to do; within ten minutes, the man was barking orders left and right to arrange a formal dinner at the Ministry to welcome Harry home. By the time Hermione was back at the house, spitting venom left and right and trying to explain to Harry what had happened, he had that faraway look in his eyes again. As if he was ready to curl up into a ball and go back to sleep. He didn’t want to visit the house, anymore; he closed the door to the bedroom he had been sleeping in for almost a month now and Hermione could do nothing but fret and pace and fume.
“But Hermione is all proprietary about that sort of thing,” Ron said with a leering grin, and bolted up the stairs.
(“Which is really just a fancy way of saying I’ll be expected to do all the grunt work for a pittance,” she’d said drily, more than once. “Lucky I’m much smarter than Blaise. I’ll swap jobs with him, so he gets the easy stuff and I get to actually learn.”
Apparently he was appalled to find himself in the company of a pair of Purebloods in his quidditch gear and drenched with sweat, as well. Though he forgot quickly, as he looked around the room.
“In a minute I’m going to tell you to fuck me, and if you want it to last for longer than thirty seconds, then yes, I’d sugg… Potter. Potter!”
wasn’t.
“You never win,” he said. “Not because you don’t make good moves, because you do. But you’re not willing to sacrifice any of your pieces. I never noticed. But I win while you have more pieces still left on the board. You’ll use a knight to protect a pawn.”
Draco thought on it. “I’m sorry I broke your nose.”
He didn’t turn to address Blaise directly, but he was quite certain the man was there, tacked away behind a disillusionment charm, or perhaps a simple notice-me-not. “Do you know anything about that case?”
“You don’t need to,” Harry said, his teeth beginning to buzz. “Please, Draco. It’s my day off. I don’t want to argue about sausages when we’ve enough bacon to sink a small battleship.”
Draco glanced at the clock over the Floo; it was probably time to go home, perhaps make himself something to eat. Helpfully, the clock’s hands were at ‘time to go home’ and ‘time to eat’, so he thought he was probably on the right track. The sun had almost set; the long days in the summer always made it easy to lose track of time and work too late. He stretched in his chair and was about to summon Rubino when he heard a knock at his door. He glanced at the clock again, and the hands had both settled at ‘something unusual is happening’.
What if he could include a charm in the wood that would prevent the user from causing harm? Was that even ethical?
“Ginevra Weasley, I can puke at will,” Pansy said, waggling a very drunken finger at Ginny’s face, before staring openly at her breasts. “Is it true you’re still letting your freak flag fly, Gin? You should come and stay with me and Greg sometime. All the whiskey you can drink.”
Draco favoured a wine bar nearby; it was run by two Wizards, easily a hundred years old and married since they were out of school. Most of the patrons were Wizarding folk as well, but Italy had rather a more relaxed view of Muggle-Wizard relations, and many of the tables were mixed; Muggle friends and partners laughed quietly alongside their more magically inclined loved ones. In the back corner, three vampires sat quietly, minding their business and drinking from pewter goblets, rather than glasses.
Harry sat dumbfounded, staring at the words on the page for a long time.
It was much more difficult than a broom, which was a surprise. A broom wasn’t constrained in space in the same way, allowing one to rebalance in three dimensions instead of just… falling sideways. But Harry set subtle cushioning charms on both sides of the bicycle in case he came close to falling (… after the first few times, anyway), and by the end of the hour, he seemed to have the hang of it. Which was why he then stopped to buy one in a store before he headed back to Grimmauld Place.
“We also scratch.”
Draco’s heart raced.
Finally, Mrs Malfoy led him into a store Harry wasn’t familiar with. Three more steps and they would have been in Knockturn Alley, which explained that readily enough; had he ventured this far down in the presence of Molly, she would have dragged him home for sweet tea, a cool compress and a very earnest lecture.
“It’s nice,” he said. “I think. It tastes a little bit like grass, but I’m told it’s very healthy.”
“Heads are gone. Walburga is curtained, since she has a permanent sticking charm of some kind on the back. I’ve thought about cutting into the wall, but the house gets so cross with me. I can’t have Kreacher
Draco shrugged. “Invite her sometime. Mother wouldn’t mind. It’s not like someone as obsessed with books and reading would hurt anything in here.”
“I’m a posh git by profession, not preference,” Topher said, and Ron laughed, dropping into a chair by the small kitchen table. Seemed barking mad that the thing could fit thirty people when it needed to, but it was being small, for now. He took the mug, and bumped it against Topher’s.
“I’d hate to disappoint your house,” Harry replied, shrugging. “I’m sure you’ve told them to expect terrible things from me.”
He knocked gently on Draco’s door, and waited a moment before he opened it. All he could see was the lump under the quilts where Draco had buried himself.
Harry had been grading a stack of papers — quite cheerfully, his students were doing well, for the most part — when he heard a knock on the door of his room, behind the defence classroom. Knock might have been generous, actually; someone was pounding their fist, and Harry’s gut twisted.
“I’m sorry about your mother,” Harry said.
“I gave that up, remember,” Harry said, and he let Draco sit up again. Wanted to see those beautiful eyes, that patrician nose. Those lips, so soft, that fit so beautifully with Harry’s. Draco turned his head.
Harry looked dumbstruck, and then he smiled, weakly, wide eyes betraying something ridiculous going on in his fat head that Draco didn’t have the energy or inclination to investigate. “That’s very kind.”
“It’s a timeline. The black is the true timeline.” He waved his wand elegantly over the page and murmured
Malfoy spent another bewildered moment looking around the room, and then he shook his head.
In truth, staying awake was no great hardship. Harry had been very carefully rationing out his Dreamless Sleep so as not to encounter too many ill effects, and of course to avoid addiction. Which meant that other nights were very, very difficult. He had been researching spells that might make him forget his nightmares on waking but was getting nowhere. He was getting desperate enough to consider asking Hermione for help, but his conviction that she would recommend therapy had kept him from doing so until now.
Harry was regularly invited to Ministry events of all kinds. He felt an obligation to accept them, until the night that Hermione let loose on him and accused him of treating himself the way others had treated him; like a pawn, a really shiny and expensive pawn who’d never been able to make his own choices, and who had no more obligation to the Ministry than any other Hogwarts student did. She’d yelled, he’d yelled, Ron had threatened to summon Molly Weasley, and then they’d all ended up on the couch together, laughing, crying, their fellow students silently brewing tea and bribing the house-elves for another round of dessert.
Draco jotted a couple of lines in a small journal. “So you and Ron graduated, and then?”
“Brave, Smart, Evil…”
“I went to try to correct my parents’ memories. But it didn’t work. We came back. Ron and I did our seventh year when the school re-opened, but Harry had received dispensation to begin Auror training.”
Hermione gave him a wide smile. “Shut up, you.”
“I’ve no clue, mate.”
The morning was fucking horrible, too, and Hermione was missing Blaise like an internal organ. She felt sick at the thought of summoning Kreacher, so Parvati led her down into the bowels of the ministry, to the kitchen, where he was resentfully rolling out pastry and muttering about his Master.
“People,” Topher said. “Sometimes I wish they’d just say what was on their mind.”
to perfect. Not tentative, not at all, it was a hungry, desperate kiss, perhaps a decade in the making. Draco pressed the length of his body against Harry’s, and reached up to free Harry’s hair from the loose bun, tangling his fingers in the length of it, pulling just enough to bare Harry’s throat and press hot lips to the shivering skin.
going on?”
He wondered how long she’d been holding this in. He could say it, just say it. Out loud. He could say, ‘I saw Draco Malfoy, and he broke my nose again’. Tell Hermione about his soft-looking buzz cut and the cigarette he’d held between his fingers and the way he’d poured all of his rage into that guitar. The way he’d flipped off the driver of the van — Harry couldn’t even remember, now, if it had been the drummer or the singer — and the way his eyes had narrowed.
“Harry,” Professor McGonagall said, clearly distressed, enough so she could ignore how tired she was. “Do you know how this happened?”
The day after the last of the term was outrageously busy. Hundreds of students to send through the Floo network or to send home on the Hogwarts Express. A handful were collected outside the gates by parents who used side-along apparition or had organised a Portkey.
“Hullo,” Harry said. “I’m sorry about the smoke. I think —”
Hermione arrived home, and the slow spread of the smile on her face made Harry giddy.
Now, Draco didn’t know who he was looking at.
“At the very least, you could try to wait until you’ve been awake twenty-four hours or so before you attempt to argue for a hasty escape.”
But Malfoy, while on his feet, didn’t look like he planned to go anywhere.
“Like what?” Hermione asked; Harry had been the first of the three of them to accept that he wasn’t going to get through without help, but like so many others, one by one they had all begun to make their way to acceptance. “Come back to school? Harry, it doesn’t matter that they’ve waived your NEWTs and let you into Auror training — you should finish, just so you know you
“Fuck you, Black,” he said, in a tone that straddled the line between playful and righteously pissed off. But he was gone in a flash of green flames, and Draco re-set his wards. For the foreseeable future, no one would be coming through without a specific invitation. He returned to Harry’s bedside.
Funny thing about doing that, though. Harry still hated the way people would rush up to him in the street and ask to shake his hand, offer their daughters in marriage, ask for an autograph or a photograph. But he hated casting a Glamour, because it implied that he was expecting it.
He’d seen this coming. A more senior position. More responsibility. They did love trotting him out in front of reporters from time to time to describe the ‘Boy Who Lived’ as the youngest Auror to… well, scratch his arse, it sometimes seemed.
“Of course, Mr Potter,” she answered. She was focused; he appreciated that. “I reserve the right to decide whether or not to agree to this favour, but please go ahead.”
Draco moved closer. “Do you want me enough to work for it? Fight for it? Thumb your nose at those tossers at the Prophet, stand up for yourself in front of your friends and mine, and for once in your life take something you want?”
“I believe they were hoping he would be backup. It
“Is that Molly Weasley’s shortbread I smell?” she asked, ignoring the chair for a moment. “Ah, so it is.” She took a lion, and took her seat, and Harry sat as well — on that side of his desk, since it seemed quite ridiculous to have the head of the Auror Office across a desk from him.
Was he about to lose his job? No — Harry couldn’t survive without purpose. His pathetic attempts to relax were proof enough of that.
Draco really hated his mother’s very long memory at times.
“I’m sorry I frightened you,” Harry murmured, against her neck.
Harry deflated, slightly. “I was going to ask you the same thing,” he admitted, quietly, taking the large coins and placing them in a money box under the counter.
He’d known it was the end, and now, he was gone.
“It’s alright.”
Harry was barely even conscious of the wandless, non-verbal spell he cast to bring the music out onto the balcony. He instantly regretted it, when he saw that Malfoy was impressed. Oh, he would make some girl a wonderful husband, for three minutes before he rode his broom directly into a volcano.
“You know you didn’t just seek redemption. You earned it,” Blaise said quietly.
But Harry didn’t answer; he was on his feet, hands cupping Draco’s face, kissing him so deeply and thoroughly that Draco couldn’t avoid a little mewl of desire. His entire body responded, and despite the difference in their heights, he actually felt small, pressed against Harry. Small and sort of…
“There’s nothing the matter. You look nice in green,” Draco said.
“Not as much as we’d like,” Neville replied. “Isn’t that right, Draco. Me and him, we’ve been saying it for for ages, now. There’s nothing wrong with the house system, but it shouldn’t limit who the students make friends with. Isn’t that right, Draco?”
“He didn’t want me to,” Harry replied miserably. “Have you — did you —“
Within a few minutes of the entire clan stumbling slightly drunk through the Floo, the doorbell began to ring. Neville and Luna, and the Patil twins; a handful of Ron’s friends from Auror training. A few friends of friends. The liquor flowed freely and they stuffed themselves with snacks, every last one of them, promising that the New Year — no, the new century, the new millennium — would bring with it powerful new promises to defy the call of deep-fried carbohydrates. Blaise Zabini appeared with a couple of other very nervous-looking Slytherins in tow, expansive and cheerful, shaking everyone’s hands, being unnecessarily tall, and telling everyone who he met that he was at school with Hermione and that he’d never in his life understand why she hadn’t been sorted into Ravenclaw.
“I think you should,” Hermione said, seriously, but she was still smiling.
about it.”
At three o’clock in the afternoon on Christmas Eve, Harry took the scrap of parchment that Narcissa’s owl had delivered that morning. He could apparate outside the wards of Malfoy Manor, but without the parchment he couldn’t use the Floo.
He woke on his bed fully dressed and wishing he had some hangover cure. Although he probably deserved this.
“Perhaps in the future a standing invitation might be in order, Minister Granger,” he said, taking out his wand to rinse down the crease in his robe, and then smoothing down his hair. “I’m not accustomed to being treated like a criminal.”
He closed his eyes. Happy. Alright, that couldn’t be hard. He was happy at the Burrow, with his chosen family. He was happy flying, but he knew he didn’t want to play Quidditch professionally; he watched Ginny bask in the spotlight and only knew he needed a much quieter place to shine. Where was he happy?
to fight anymore. I don’t want my life to be about that. I want something softer, gentler.” He glanced at the tiny wand in Ollivander’s hand. “Perhaps even something more creative.”
“You know something — I’m not dwelling on this. It’s December. It’s nearly Christmas, and I’m not letting that manipulative git ruin it for me. And my New Year’s Resolution is… I’m going to start dating. Properly dating. Relationship-type dating.”
“I see a match, here, that could raise the profile of the Malfoy line, and — please hear me, darling, when I tell you this matters much more to me — one that could make you happy. I’ll leave you with that thought; he’s almost here,” she said, crossing the space and opening the door to greet him before he had even managed to knock. “Harry, dear,” she said, stepping back to let him inside.
“I shall speak to Headmaster McGonagall,” he said. “And we’ll need to find a time when there are no Quidditch practices scheduled. I think it’s a fine idea.”
“Just a thank you will suffice.”
“Quite.” Draco shook himself. “That took a turn. I didn’t plan to say any of that.
With a crack, dinner plates appeared on the table and Harry, in his alarm, spilled tea.
Malfoy almost fell into the room, when Harry opened the door; his skin was a worrying shade of green, he appeared to be having trouble walking, and Harry had to half-drag, half-carry him to a large armchair.
“How do you take your tea?” Mrs Malfoy asked, waving a wand lazily at the tea service on the sideboard.
“Three house-elves and suddenly he’s all bossy,” Draco complained, reaching for a pinch of Floo powder.
Merlin’s balls. He could go back and try to sneak into the fireplace. He could try to climb over the fence, and hope that the wards didn’t go too high.
“I told you about the Dementors, and the Wizengamot. And this… Sirius’s room, obviously. It’s a doorway into what I can only assume is the Death Room in the Department of Mysteries — I was an idiot, I thought that would prove to be his worst memory of that time. And it was fucking
“I have something else for you,” Draco said. Harry wanted to sink into the carpet. This gift was far too much all by itself, even worse compared to his own. He wanted to argue, but he’d learned enough about Pureblood etiquette — even the simple Wizard courtesies — to know to keep his stupid trap shut. He swallowed hard.
One day he had been wandering aimlessly through one of the large parks when he found a middle-aged Muggle man teaching another adult how to ride a bicycle. It was interesting; riding a bicycle in the Muggle world was like riding a Broomstick, and it was unusual for an adult never to have learned. Harry loitered, with a notice-me-not charm, and learned that the man wanted to learn so he could teach his own daughter.
Draco turned around. He could never resist that particular tone.
“Oh,” Topher said. “Say no more.”
Harry was standing in front of his desk, staring at —
“I think we’ve firmly established that I… that I’m
His meddling mother had invited Harry bloody Potter to Christmas Eve at Malfoy Manor.
He’d had feelings for Malfoy, but this disappointment paled in comparison to almost any other loss he’d experienced. He’d survive. And if nothing else, this had jerked him awake. Showed him that there were things missing from his life; sex, and companionship, and someone to share his life with. Things he hadn’t thought mattered, knowing he had friends and family and meaningful work. But they mattered.
Hermione probably knew how Wandmakers got the magical core into a wand. He’d ask her in the morning.
She watched the even rise and fall of Harry’s chest, and returned her attention to the book open on her lap. Research, of course. The book was propped on the arm of the chair because it was heavy enough to be causing discomfort. Hermione glanced at the clock and asked herself how long she could realistically keep taking in any kind of information. She raised her wand, and tapped her watch. It opened out a schedule for the next two days. She had a briefing with… oh, and the Department of…
She leaned across the space and took his head in her great hands. “Two weeks notice. And rather than work them, you should take some of the leave you are owed. You will need supplies, and time to move to the castle. It is time to go,
Harry had no earthly idea what those were, but he smiled agreeably. He fed the school owl a morsel and whispered in her ear, and she was gone.
“The magical part of the injury will slow the healing of the non-magical part,” Harry said. “This reminds me a great deal of a trap my partner and I stumbled into in Belgium.”
Perhaps it
Draco pushed the door open. Harry was sitting on the bed. Older, but no less handsome — in fact Auror Lisbon might have been right, Harry was ageing rather gorgeously with the grey shot through his hair — but somehow defeated-looking, his hands resting on his lap, staring at the fireplace.
Harry felt that he should have been annoyed at the way Draco simply smoothed over what amounted to ten years of misery by being flippant but the truth was, he enjoyed it. Draco had no reverence for anything, and it was refreshing. Also, he was already making himself at home, pouring wine. Harry liked it more than he should have. He’d been so absorbed by his thinking that he’d let the fire dwindle, but he waved vaguely in the direction of the fireplace and the flames grew quickly.
Malfoy said nothing, focussed on his task. Which didn’t seem to be going well. There was smoke coming from the pan, though it didn’t seem to deter him.
“Well, I didn’t mean a literal textbook, although you do have a tendency to look a little over-read and dreadfully dog-eared.”
“I think we’ve established who is fucking who, right now, Harry. And now, my favour, if you please. While I open you up, you’re going to look at me. Don’t close your eyes, Harry. Trust me to take care of you the way you want me to. I promise it will be so good, so, so good.”
“Potter,” he said, his voice cracking painfully. “Help.” And then his eyes fell closed again.
He felt his cock stir, just slightly, and he almost didn’t notice when someone pushed a shot of something disgusting and sticky into his hand, but he downed it anyway.
Hogwarts.
, purposeful and productive, might be something he’d need to work on with his Mind Healer, now that he had stopped answering “I’m fine, really good” to every question she asked him.
And it was fucking
He wanted Draco. Not just in this precise moment. He wanted Draco
,” Malfoy said. “They must have known you —”
Hermione wanted to look at the map, she did. The lines moved, showing the different versions of the house, the two layers, as it were.
“I think he would have been a good deal happier had you stayed,” Mrs Malfoy said, quietly. “Perhaps growing up with Muggles taught you some sort of prejudice…”
“You are. It’s alright; you’re the Minister for Magic, Hermione.” Blaise lowered his hood onto his neck and settled on the arm of an overstuffed chair, which purred disconcertingly. “But I’d be remiss both as your adviser and your future husband if I didn’t give you a minute to figure out exactly why you are procrastinating. It’s hardly your style.”
“Well, write a note so I know where to fetch you back from, next time.”
?” he asked, frowning.
“Supervise?” Draco raised an eyebrow. “No need. Unless you’d be more comfortable watching to make sure I don’t switch something out for Belladonna, I can manage myself. I’ll have one of the elves bring it to you.”
She smoothed down the front of her robes, and settled herself.
“Slytherin, are you?” Draco said, conspiratorially. She smiled. “Go on, then. I need a little colour.”
a pot of tea. Sit together and talk.”
She wavered a little longer.
And why his head kept mixing up ideas and images like Draco, and fun, and sex, and loneliness, he really didn’t know. Nor why his comments stung so hard. It was an attraction, and he’d had dozens of those. Easy enough to set aside when there was so much to do.
The guitar player’s hair was cut very short, but it was a pale blond which reminded Harry of…
Draco climbed to his feet and headed inside. He was grateful for a few moments to collect his thoughts, actually. He found another bottle of Pansy’s Firewhiskey and a couple of small crystal tumblers. He had saved very little from his family home, but these tumblers had come with him from Wiltshire to Nice, to Rome and then to Naples, and he loved them, quietly and fiercely. He brought them out to the warm porch and poured them each a drink.
“Is it true you can do a non-verbal, wandless disarming spell?”
“Oh, you mean when I said I was going to make you my husband? Yes. I meant it. I don’t know what the future holds here except that we’ll be together in it.” He reached across the bed to tuck a strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear. It was so soft.
“I’m always nice,” Harry growled into his pint, as if he was blaming it very specifically for all the ills of the day, and hoping it would shrivel and die. Moments later, their colleagues were sat at the table with them, celebrating the end of another week and the absence of students in the pub.
“No, don’t try to make me feel better about it.”
?” Harry asked, cocking his head.
He felt almost dizzy. He’d loved duelling. He really had, and long before it had been a life or death skill. Take that, Hermione. Take that, Ron.
Draco found himself walking back through the castle in the direction of the Defence corridor, and Harry’s rooms. Well, room. His mother had been right about one thing; turning it into a suite would have had him choke on his martyrdom, and as nice as that might have been to watch, the chances were very good that he would have returned the space to its previously decrepit state rather than simply get comfortable.
Oh. Oh! Harry wordlessly conjured some lube into Draco’s hand and Draco lifted his own arse into the air, steadying himself with one hand and working his fingers inside himself until he was so turned on his mouth was getting sloppy, his rhythm entirely gone.
He didn’t respond to that.
He wrote Luna a brief note.
, a quiet voice murmured in his head.
Draco sent the letter at once, summoning a school owl. Time to get some sleep.
Parvati seemed to take several seconds to decide that Hermione wasn’t in danger from any of the elves, and nodded curtly, stepping outside and closing the door.
. He honestly sounds to me like a bit of a shit. At least when he was a boy.”
“Of course he will,” Harry promised, squeezing his hand again. “If they’ll let him.”
He was thinking about that now because he was thinking about Draco Malfoy, and how finding a calling could bring out the best in a person. He’d meant what he said. Draco had been far nicer than he ever wanted anyone to notice. He had been devoted to his friends. Predictably abrasive and tactile and sweet and funny right up until he’d been forced to take the Mark in the summer before Sixth Year, and shut everything else off, more or less. After that, of course, he’d been unable to think about anything much except how he was going to keep his parents alive.
“It’s alright to want to fall in love,” Draco mused. “And be happy with someone. I wish I could hear the music better.”
“I say. Haven’t they come up with another name for you, yet?” he asked, his voice cool and even.
wanted to kiss. He felt like a fraud, in his fancy clothes. He wondered if he should remind Draco that he’d slept in a cupboard under the stairs for ten years and didn’t know which forks to use. That sometimes he wanted to vanish all of his nice furniture because he loved it so much and didn’t think he should really be allowed to touch it.
It was probably almost twenty years overdue, really, and the almost hilarious thought struck her that Draco really had to be a very good psychiatrist. She was not, however, expecting to hear his chair move closer, or expecting him to slip his arms around her body so that she could cry into his shoulder.
“Either I am a stranger who will begin working to bring him out of this fantasy with hard work and logic, or I am a lover who can teach him he’s safe outside of it. I’m sure you’ll agree that the two approaches are necessarily
“Perhaps we should leave off taking potshots at each other’s friends until we’ve figured out what exactly we’re doing, here, Professor Potter.” Draco raised an eyebrow and rested his hands on the balustrade. He missed the peacocks. The garden wasn’t the same without them.
“And he
“I just thought — well, Ron thought. Wondered. If there was something you knew about that we didn’t. Something he told you, something terrible. The worst memory Harry has.”
Ron nodded, but his shoulders sloped. “Yeah, mate, I… I’m glad for you. It’s great.”
Draco grunted, and gestured over the pyjama shirt, which obediently closed. He took Harry’s hand between both of his own, his expression serious, worried, and… Hermione didn’t like to look, but she couldn’t look away, especially when Draco seemed to have forgotten she was there entirely for a moment or two and gently brushed Harry’s hair from his eyes. His hand rested on Harry’s cheek for a few moments, and he murmured something Hermione didn’t believe was a spell.
“Well, we threw them,” Ron said, with his mouth full of mashed potatoes. “And you usually arrived late and covered in something frightening.”
half as wealthy as I am — when are you going to start dressing like an adult?”
Harry was almost knocked off his feet when Ron and Hermione stepped through.
He had happened upon his collection of feathers the week before, and that first wand with Kneazle whisker. He had begun to make notes about the attributes of various cores and possible cores and had begun planning a research study. He was considering getting permission from the Ministry to requisition certain materials that were otherwise difficult to get hold of. His mind had run away with him, over the last several days. Understanding what he did now about how a wand did nothing but focus power — and that there was some sympathetic vibration between the wand and the bearer — he was now wondering if there might be wands that would be fit for specific purposes, like healing. Healers might use one wand at home and another at work, for example. And so much more. What if the right wand could grant limited magic even to a Squib? Or someone who had lost their magic due to illness?
“I’ve known him since we were eleven years old and starting school together.” Draco flushed, humiliated, and then he told Emrys… everything.
dance.”
“Kreacher,” he said. “Did you do all of this?”
“Everything was… everything was normal,” Auror Lisbon was saying. She looked confused by the questions. “I’m new, you know, only been an Auror three years. He’s so good to me. My partner’s been off work, her wife had a baby and for a few weeks there, if I was needed for fieldwork, Harry — Auror Potter — was joining me. Until he went to… wherever he is now. You’re not — he’s not under investigation, is he?”
“Do you have a hobby?” Harry asked, innocently. “Other than gazing at yourself adoringly in the mirror? It probably doesn’t leave you a lot of time for much else.”
typical for a late July day in London, he took a long, aimless stroll in the general direction of things that made him happy. A man stopped him in the street and asked the time.
Mysteries, all, but it was impossible not to piece the simplest fragments together, given enough time to think.
. I have to go. Ask her out, you utter git. She was mad about you in school. Or I shall come up with a better threat. One you’ll believe.”
“Not here.” She sighed. “Come and stay with me, for a little while, please. Blaise and I have a couple of spare bedrooms. I’ll have the files sent over if you’ll rest while you read them.”
“Yes.
“No, because you have terrible instincts and a death wish.”
Fuck, he’d been out only a few hours, and as much as he knew it was time to go home, he missed it. The good days, anyway, days when Draco wouldn’t let him out of bed, or when they cooked side by side in the kitchen or talked in the sitting room with their bare feet stretched out toward the fire.
Arsehole. Complete sodding
“It’s alright,” Harry promised. “You’ll always be my family. Even when it’s hard.”
Harry’s lips curled into a small smile. “I think it’s very fair to say that we both had our moments.”
.” And it
“I’m going,” Neville said, from Draco’s left side, waving his own invitation. “I’ll be delighted to go! Draco, will you let your tailor see to me, too?”
“I must take my leave. Draco, darling, I have some papers for you to sign — will you take supper with me this week at the Manor — perhaps Wednesday? Eight o’clock?”
Draco’s eyes were red-rimmed, the inky shadows beneath them even more pronounced. His hands were hidden in his cardigan, as per usual, and he flinched at the sight of the half-completed wands scattered over the table.
“Kreacher has a staff,” Kreacher said. He climbed down off the table, and stood between the two elves. Their eyes were as large as his were small. “Kreacher will go, now. Kreacher has work to do.”
“Oh, hello, Persephone,” he said, as Hermione’s owl dropped a newspaper in his hands and flew into the room, perching happily on the foot of his bed and waiting expectantly. “Do I want to read this?” he asked the owl, balefully, and Persephone gave a soft hoot before flying down the stairs and into the kitchen. Draco stepped into his slippers, less for warmth and more because there was sometimes a splinter or two to be found on his floorboards and he hated having to dig them out.
She had a lot on her tray, and Harry had to remind himself that House-elves were enormously strong. He took a butterbeer, and then thinking at the last moment took the firewhiskey as well, knocking it back and returning the glass with a wink.
Draco found his seat at the head table and nodded cordially to Neville and Harry. Harry had clearly elected not to come to Draco for more Dreamless Sleep. He looked rather like he hadn’t slept well since the night of the party at Malfoy Manor. Served him right.
The wand hummed faintly. Harry gave it an experimental little wave, and weak yellow and orange sparks tumbled from the end. He laughed. Not something the DMLE would appreciate, but it felt so good to have figured something out by himself that Harry kept making sparks for a good ten minutes.
Hermione blanched.
“Yes, Madam.”
“I think I can manage all of that,” he said, sounding remarkably prudish, enough so that Harry had to laugh. “But I need you to do me a favour, too, Harry.”
“Malf—”
“Harry,” Draco said, from his left elbow.
“I should probably attempt to get some sleep. I barely made a dent in your files.”
“Alright, Harry. Four drops. I’ve set an alarm so I can’t get lost, but I’d appreciate you not pushing me out, this time, if you can help it, alright?”
late twenties. But he hasn’t got the memo yet. I mean, fair play to him, and all. He can stick his knob wherever he likes. Might be about time I encouraged him to stop pointing it at me, is all.”
Harry didn’t have an answer for that. For any of it. For a moment last night he’d thought maybe Draco had come because he wanted to be in Harry’s life, because he’d seen something there that he wanted. That like Harry himself he’d eventually started wondering if all of those years of mutual obsession and pigtail-pulling had been a veneer. He’d wondered if they might have another chance, if the help Harry had failed to offer Draco when they were sixteen years old and the world was on fire might be something he could offer now.
There was no balancing the scales. Draco knew that.
just to get a break from his loud, frequent overanalysis. Maybe he should talk to Pansy. He could spend another afternoon in Dublin on Saturday, he thought.
The tip of Draco’s tongue slipped out to wet his lips, and Harry was mesmerised. He could — and then he’d… and he’d never kissed anyone before that he’d
Where on earth was that Healer?
Draco opened out the map that
Harry opened the letter, and frowned at it.
“No, Draco. I don’t want —”
He sat morose with glass after glass of Firewhiskey. When Neville eventually dragged him back to the Defence corridor, he pressed a vial into Harry’s hand.
Longbottom had steered Potter to his seat, which was of course beside Draco’s. He’d have liked to pretend it was Minerva interfering, but as he’d been seated beside the previous Defence Professor for the last two years he had to assume it was tradition. Minerva certainly wouldn’t try to bait them into a duel on the night of the Great Feast, surely.
“He said that went fine.”
Draco took his seat, and reached for a glass of wine, just as a parade of tiny first-year students, shivering from the rain outside, were brought to the front of the room for sorting. He clamped down the flurry of emotions, keeping his face steady, and prepared to clap politely as each child was sent to sit with their new table. He could do this.
Draco shrugged. “My own inimitably handsome self. And one very scruffy half-mad Auror.”
“See you at breakfast,” Harry called, waving absently as he headed in the direction of his quarters.
But the small things, he liked those better.
“Well, spit it out. This had better not be you begging for remedial Potions lessons. As much as I would enjoy your debasement, I’m afraid there’s nothing to be done for your appalling lack of ability.”
“But I need your opinion on something.” Ginny nodded. “There’s a memory. Something Harry can’t bear to think about.”
“Alright,” Blaise said, after a few moments. They’d of course managed an entire conversation with a glance, and Blaise knew that she wouldn’t be swayed, nor appreciate a fuss. “Welcome back, Potter.” He clapped Harry on the shoulder. “See you soon. Draco? What do they drink in Naples? I think one of my dads was from around here… maybe the fourth or fifth one…”
“Oh, he’s interested in sex, alright,” Draco said. His expression was inscrutable. Amused, sad. Something else, too. “Do you think he might have some kind of secret life that you’re not aware of? A lover?”
“The difference is, everything I lost, I deserved to lose.”
, All Souls’ Day. He floo-called Hermione, who couldn’t talk about anything but her pregnancy. He floo-called Ron, who only wanted to fret about what would happen if Hermione was wrong, and it wasn’t a girl (“What if she just wants to keep having them, Harry? My parents had a thousand of us before they got Ginny — I don’t have the energy.”).
Ron’s mouth flew open. “Me, too. I think I like being busy, that suits me. D’you know what Auror O’Toole said, he said —”
But sometimes, when he was just falling asleep, Harry would hear those words over again:
He stared at the fire, the light dancing across his pale features, and sipped the whiskey. Hermione wondered if he even remembered she was there. They were supposed to be talking about Harry, and yet, she wanted —
“Finished. I’ll bring you one when I receive my brag copies,” she promised. She handed over a long wooden case. “I’m here because of this. It’s not my wand, but it has been passed down for several generations, and it is used in certain private, traditional rituals,” she said. Not her usual cheerful self. Harry opened the box, and immediately felt the problem. He lifted it and placed it on a stand.
“So what are you, Harry? In your heart of hearts. Were you not the Boy Who Lived. Had you not been the one to defeat Voldemort and end the war. Don’t answer too quickly. Just think, and tell me. Where does your heart lie? Where are you happy? Close your eyes.”
“Alright. Give me a wandless summoning?” A moment later, a mug flew across the room and into Harry’s hand; good speed, zero splash. “Show-off,” she said, taking the mug and sipping her coffee. “Disillusionment? Alright — apparate outside my door, and then inside again. No. Apparate outside near the trees and bring me something back.”
These tricks were no longer working. He needed some of that potion.
“Oh.” Draco’s mouth and throat were dry. “And what did you talk about?”
“You have to ask them if I can come,” he said a few minutes later. “I’m not springing it on them. But don’t be surprised if they say no. I won’t be hurt.”
Harry startled briefly as Crookshanks leapt up on the couch alongside him. “Hello, you,” he said, scratching deep into his fur. “I have to tell you about my day, Hermione. I met these cats…”
“No,” Harry said. “Don’t you dare, Hermione. If he can’t trust me — he has no one.”
“If you think it more likely that this… very sweet, but twisted little domestic arrangement has transpired this way simply because I am the one who showed up in his head, then tell me.”
“Well, that sounds like a lovely break from work,” Draco deadpanned. “What about holidays?”
“You can’t cook.”
, must be
’? He sat up abruptly, wrapping his arms around Draco’s body with Draco seated firmly over his thighs.
Hermione was struggling to find something to say in reply, and then it was too late. Harry was gone.
Harry muttered a near-silent A
“There’s no Firewhi— oh,” Potter said, when a bottle and two glasses came to rest at the end of Draco’s personal work-bench.
“Stop it,” Harry said, finally taking a step back. But Draco only took a step forward.
“I don’t want to interrogate you,” Draco said delicately, sitting across the small table with his own mug of tea.
Of course, everyone makes ridiculous faces when they come. Harry felt his mouth fall open, his eyes roll back in his head as the tug deep in his body, behind his balls, became impossible to control. As his balls tightened, and his thrusts lost their rhythm. And then he was coming, hard, with his teeth buried in Draco’s bottom lip.
All of this — he’d been so clever, so careful, made Harry think they were getting closer. Made Harry think that affection was real, that his hesitation and his beautiful submission had been Harry’s idea. So little was known about re-awakening a dormant magical core, but if someone wanted to do that, what better source than what the Daily Prophet constantly referred to as the
“Same time next week, Professor Malfoy.” He nodded, and they parted ways.
The long dining table. Once, Lucius had sat at one end, and Narcissa at the other. Draco in the middle, miles from either of them. Now, he and his mother crowded one end so they could talk. And talk she did.
But he held up his hand. “All I ever wanted was a simple life like my parents had. Family. I think maybe I used up all my courage in the war. I wanted to be there for you.”
Draco turned back to him, his cheeks flushing slightly. With pleasure, with embarrassment, Harry couldn’t be sure.
“I didn’t come to get my magic back,” Malfoy said. “I didn’t
Draco huffed, and shifted, reaching for the book and passing it to Harry. “I have a five year old patient who won’t speak,” he said, by explanation.
All the energy seemed to go out of them at the same time. Harry was almost relieved not to have to hear what Draco might have said, had he gone on. They sat in a silence that began tense and settled into companionable over time.
… nah.
Harry woke before the sun was up. He wasn’t surprised, but he was disappointed. He suspected that he had been having a very pleasant dream. Probably better that he didn’t remember it. His dreams had been about Draco for much too long, and he still burned with humiliation when he thought about the fact that Draco knew it.
“Careful,” Draco said softly, to a student in Potions that day before lunch. She was a nervous little thing. Born to Squibs and expected not to have magic of her own, she’d not been exposed to this world until her owl had arrived on her eleventh birthday.
For a moment, Draco froze in place. His mother’s owl? But no, that was impossible, because Narcissa had been gone for five years, almost, and her owl had disappeared as soon as she was in the ground. Still, the resemblance was uncanny.
Harry sighed, and moved closer, brushing a warm kiss over Draco’s mouth.
“Yes,” he said. He took the first stair, and then the second, his feet getting heavier. He turned around. Harry was still staring at him.
Draco didn’t look up. He could brew this particular potion in his sleep, but he took his time. This was the first time he’d been alone with Potter since the term had started. But whatever it was he’d been planning to say, he had clearly decided against it, reaching for his glass, instead. Draco was gratified that he noticed it wasn’t the ugly crystalware from the kitchens, but a Malfoy heirloom. Potter turned the tumbler in his hand, admiring the rainbows cast within.
grateful. Or hallucinating. One or the other, maybe even both. He crouched down in front of them, and offered Kreacher his hand to shake. Kreacher tugged at his ears briefly and then flung himself into Harry’s arms.
Every night since Harry had moved into the Villa, Draco had heard him walking around at night. So it wasn’t a terrible shock, several days later, to find Harry climbing silently down the stairs at two o’clock in the morning, with his hair sticking out in every direction and blinking owlishly behind his glasses. Draco was stretched out on the couch, warming his toes with a book in his hand.
“Mistress!”
“Please, darling.”
The mood in the room started to shift. Harry recognised it. There were a lot of people in the room who had put the pieces together, over the years, and others who were shocked by every syllable.
Harry frowned, and then understood. “What? No! No, it’s not — I couldn’t explain this to someone I knew, I certainly can’t make you understand. Why are we
“Really?” Draco’s expression was challenging.
“Plenty of leftovers,” he said. “I’d rather waste our afternoon on more carnal pursuits.”
“Bit hard to miss a mirror that size.”
Ginny would Floo in at eleven o’clock.
He had done one more thing, in Diagon Alley. Harry had been very sure he couldn’t ever have another owl, after losing Hedwig; but somehow, taking control over his future had made him feel bold enough so that he now saw purchasing himself another owl as an act of forgiveness. She was a funny little thing, who cocked her head this way and that, and even seemed to dance sometimes on the perch he had conjured her in the kitchen so that she could get used to him.
“I look forward to it, Mother,” he said, mentally compiling a list of all the things they needed to discuss. It was not a short list.
“Like what?”
He took Hermione into his arms and danced her around the kitchen. Poorly, but with a great deal of enthusiasm and more energy than he’d had the day before. He’d soaked up all the sunshine and it was converting to peace, under his skin.
“He did terrible things.”
It looked to Draco like the bars of a cage.
Harry leaned forward, elbows on his knees. He was silent, his mind churning, almost nauseous. The ducks, though. The ducks were great.
The party was small, but the guests too polite to make a fuss of Harry, much to his relief. He took a seat on the end of a sofa once he’d been introduced to everyone (Draco had snuck him a memory spell to recall their names, which was very helpful, as he would never have been able to keep them straight in his head otherwise).
must have such a hard time of it when the weather is cold. People have prejudice against delicious cold food just because it’s cold outside.”
Draco snorted. “Because, Minister Granger — he wanted a fucking day
Emrys laughed out loud. “This isn’t a tea conversation. I’m not even sure it’s a supervision session.” He paused, and raised his eyebrows, and looked very deliberately at his teacup. “Topher. I thought the implication was very clear.”
He saw the bird, in his mind’s eye, broken and twisted.
“They were all closed files.”
Draco’s hands were folded together in his lap. He looked down at them, and realised how tightly they were tangled together. They ached. He released them, and smoothed down his pale grey robes.
When the cats lost interest in him, Harry walked on. He found a sunny park, and sat on an ancient bench carved with hearts and letters, and let the sun warm his face.
Draco set the cup on the table. Not a teacup, actually, it was a mug, and it wasn’t full, which could only mean that Draco had seen how his hands shook. It was very strange, seeing Draco Malfoy behaving in a way that was so acutely considerate and careful. Or perhaps not. Perhaps it was only that Harry hadn’t seen that gentle care turned on himself in this way. Not outside of…
“Merlin’s arse,” Draco said, frowning and looking up. He was six feet tall himself; the history professor was being simply
Beater, no less.”
“You want me to suck you off, Malfoy? Is that what you want?”
Harry did — he couldn’t resist showing anyone around, if they showed the slightest bit of interest. With a grin on his face, he led Blaise up the stairs. “These old places make me laugh, you know. There’s the sitting room downstairs, and a sitting room up here —”
Harry watched, mesmerised, as the butterfly slowly moved its wings, watching him. And he didn’t feel any regret when it flew away.
to do, ways to keep busy, work that would put them to sleep at the end of the day. Harry was regularly trotted out by the Ministry to talk to the public, asking them to dig deep; this was a world full of destroyed buildings and new orphans who needed help. Fundraising was easier than expected. Anyone who had ever expressed a shadow of agreement with Tom Riddle’s absurd fantasies about blood purity was particularly keen to be seen donating large amounts.
Draco stared at the letter for a moment longer.
friends. When he wasn’t studying he worked in one hospital or another. He was good with children and he was kind and smart and funny and mean, and he knew which of those to use and when. I liked seeing him. Sitting near him in a quiet café or the library, just watching him exist. And then he went to Italy, studied in Rome for a couple of years. And then to a hospital in Naples. Eventually, it wasn’t enough to watch him; I had to speak to him. I’m quite good with Glamours myself, thanks to my work. My previous work,” he corrected. He looked ashamed, but determined, and hopeful.
“Then a nice Slytherin boy — I suppose you’d like to see me deliriously happily married to Blaise Zabini.”
“The Auror work,” he said, with a shrug. “Sometimes it’s safer to be silent. And sometimes you can’t reach your wand, or someone has taken it, or you’re in a full body-bind for one reason or another.”
After a long silence, Draco nodded, and climbed to his feet. “No need to get up, Minister,” he said. “I’m sure Auror Patil can show me to Harry’s office. I’ll talk to you later today.”
“It’s just — it seemed — he cares about you, Harry. And I think you care about him, too.”
, all the time, living with him, sleeping with him, bickering with him. He wanted Draco’s morning breath and his snide comments and his sparkling eyes. He wasn’t sure he could even look at his bedroom knowing that it would always be half empty. And knowing that Draco had to have described all of this, in enough detail so that Kreacher could make it happen. As if he’d cared. As if he’d wanted Harry to make his home here again.
“We should get Ron and Hermione around for lunch,” Draco said, as he Summoned a couple of pans from the cupboard.
Once he was settled in his armchair, the leg rest out all the way and the back reclined, Harry pulled the last quilt over himself and waited for sleep to take him.
The Chosen One. And he’d never had the chance to choose, not really. And never, never for himself. Plunging into the dark water and trying to remember that he was breathing through gills, and not drowning. Dodging Grindylows and worse as he swam — and he wasn’t very good at that, either, the buoyancy of his limbs fighting him every step of the way —
“Oh. Well. Thank you,” he said.
“It looks lovely,” Topher said, and even though it was an obvious lie, Ron seized on it.
“Better than you,” she said.
“Keep November 1
“Oh, I’ve always been happy,” Luna replied, her chin tilted just so. “It’s only a state of mind, you know. You choose it. It’s not a place you arrive at.”
to exclaim “THE BOY WHO LIVED?”
“I’ll ogle you all I like,” Harry said, and he kissed the hinge of Draco’s jaw. “Draco Potter.”
,” he called, clear as a bell. From the tip of his wand, silver smoke poured, and an enormous hare leapt around the courtyard and then disappeared into the trees. Harry laughed out loud; Draco’s lips barely curved as he watched the hare’s antics. Long and strong and noble. Draco turned to Harry, the smile gone from his face, and shook his head. He looked at the wand in his hand. “I’ve never cast a real, corporeal
Blaise Zabini didn’t know Harry Potter very well at all. He genuinely wasn’t sure that anyone really did. But he was certain of one thing:
Draco couldn’t remember the last time he’d had a proper cry. One of those good, painful, drawn-out snotfests that left one feeling scrubbed raw inside. But he sat up now, legs over the edge of the bed, and he cried. For himself. For Harry. For everyone who’d lived through the war and everyone who hadn’t. He cried for that fourteen year-old in the cemetery, too, and for the little fuckwit Draco had been until he’d looked up one day to find that his father wasn’t just mistaken, wasn’t just wrong, but knew it — and had made a conscious decision not to change, regardless.
Draco folded his arms. He glanced at Blaise, but had to assume there were no secrets here. He shrugged. “I’ll do it.”
“I didn’t think of it,” he fibbed politely. “I forgot how much I enjoyed it this way.”
Finn and Luna had spent a couple of weeks helping to re-home a colony of Striped Copper Moles (previously thought extinct by Luna and imaginary to almost everyone else in the Wizarding World) as their cave system was about to be demolished to make way for the tennis courts at a new seaside resort for Muggles. Grayson had stayed at home, working on his novel in a Muggle overcoat (“terribly smart, but itchy on the bollocks when you’re sitting down”), pretending to be tortured (“because what if that’s why I didn’t finish my first novel? I wasn’t tortured enough? I think the itchy balls are probably important for the torture”).
Harry sat up. “Are you sure you’re alright? You haven’t been Obliviated? Not getting sick or anything? Day off, Draco. Day off! You’re not allowed to feel like shite on our day off.”
“You can read, right? Only I’m not sure you should have accepted a teaching post if you can’t.” He handed the envelope back to Harry, who looked at it as if it might contain a Howler after all. “It’s addressed to you.”
“I think he probably is. D’you know, We were out in the field once, a big raid, maybe a dozen Aurors. This group takes Muggle drugs, right, treats ‘em with spells, charms, all that malarkey, sells them to Muggles and Wizards alike. The place blew up. Bunch of us were hurt, course, can’t avoid that, but no one died, thank Salazar. Anyway the mobile mediwizards came to patch us up in the field and I saw him without his shirt on — never seen so many scars on a Wizard before! Can’t pretend we weren’t all having a good look. He’s handsome, isn’t he?”
But instead he found himself meandering aimlessly down a street in Muggle London. The day was unseasonably warm but there was a nice breeze. Harry found an old black cat with one eye patrolling the front steps of a small house set close to the footpath, and crouched down to pet it. It spent an appropriate amount of time staring at him disdainfully and tolerating his gentle hand, and then curled around Harry’s feet, demanding to be petted. One cat soon became three, all looking for attention.
By choice.
“So, on a score of, say, Sirius to your Mother, how did I do?” Harry asked, leaning against the balustrade.
business hours,” she said, defensively.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Shall I go?” He was already halfway to his feet.
“My first and only concern is the well-being of my patient,” he said, sitting up stiffly.
“Sounds like it,” Draco said, with a sigh, making a note. “What about you? Have you ever worked with him on a case?”
“I can get them myself,” Potter said.
Harry nodded. “And Fairlie Gothelf —”
Harry nodded briskly and tried to pull away. As if he was trying to get to his feet. Draco took his wrist and pulled him back down.
Harry deflated, somewhat, and looked about to say something else when the morning owls flew through the windows, dropping letters and parcels everywhere. Draco caught a package with his own name on it, and passed it to Harry, who was still dutifully checking all of his parcels, and any latter addressed in an unfamiliar hand. Harry passed him back a letter with the Malfoy seal on the back.
He wrote.
Harry glared murderously at him. “Get out of my room, Malfoy, or I’ll hex your balls off.” But Malfoy, stupid git, rolled his eyes and sat down on the end of the bed. “How did you get into Gryffindor Tower?”
“How are you feeling?” Harry asked.
“I don’t know if he knows about the flowers,” Blaise said quietly, holding Hermione’s elbow as she picked her way across the space. “But the Malfoys never really got rid of anything, and there were old food stores and mattresses in one of the cellars. Far as I can tell, the mattresses were stuffed with grasses and seeds and once the enchantments were gone and everything started to fall apart, the seeds struck.”
Malfoy didn’t watch. It would have been easy to think that he was, but he wasn’t. Harry could see how his eyes were unfocused, and his hands perfectly still. He was there, but his mind was somewhere else, and Harry was prepared to bet it was a long way from Wiltshire.
Draco nodded. “We talked for a while, afterward. Or I did. But he listened, I think. And eventually, he relaxed enough to let me hold him for a while.”
He sat by Harry’s bedside for at least three or four hours after he arrived back in Naples, thinking. And then, following no other protocol but instinct, Draco crept up onto the bed. He stretched out, his head on Harry’s shoulder and his arm draped happily over his stomach.
worked on your dreadful handwriting.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said, dropping into the armchair by the lamp in Harry’s office. She wanted to tear herself into pieces. She wanted him back — the DMLE needed him back. Harry had been refusing to take up the post of Chief Auror for years, because he always said he needed to be in the field, but that didn’t change the fact that he had been running the place for almost a decade. And that his extraordinary success rate had seemed to make pursuing Dark Magic significantly less attractive than throwing oneself into more legal and satisfying pastimes. Auror Robards was a signature, these days, and everyone knew it, including him.
“Harry?” he called, louder this time. He stepped around an ancient-looking mausoleum and into a sort of clearing, with an enormous cauldron in the centre. Wisps of smoke from a long-dead fire vanished into the breeze.
“Sort of,” Harry grumbled.
“But this…” Harry’s voice was lower, and scratchy, and exhausted. “This didn’t happen, did it. It didn’t happen and it can’t happen. The worst thing I ever did. I can’t take it back.”
“So — what would you say? If you could see him — tell him — this
“No, we’re not. And you’re right; when we were children, I did hate you. I wished Voldemort had killed you when you were a baby.” Draco hadn’t expected quite this degree of honesty to tumble from his lips, but here it was.
“I won’t leave,” he promised Draco’s now-closed eyes, in case he was still awake, or semi-conscious. He pressed a warm hand to Draco’s cold cheek. “I’m right here.”
“Your little friend asked me how you were,” Harry interrupted, placing the plate on the end table beside Draco. If he’d noticed that Draco’s wards had been shifted to allow him access, he didn’t mention it. He placed a glass of ginger ale alongside the plate, and sat on the armchair nearest. “I told her you were quite well. She thinks she’s in trouble.”
“I worked at St. Mungo’s, actually. I still consult for them, from time to time, when they have a potions-related catastrophe of some sort or need help developing something new. I was always rather good at this, I think you’ll remember. The secret is: follow the directions, stop aggravating Snape, and stop staring daggers at the back of the Slytherins’ heads, and you might learn a thing or two.”
“I know. And I never take risks, or run into something half-cocked —”
“I can’t,” she said, now, miserably. “I can’t. Look how it bubbles, Professor Malfoy. It will splash me.”
He frowned.
It was an interesting question. Draco tilted his head; he couldn’t quite remember.
Draco leaned forward, elbows on his knees, and closed his eyes. His glass dangled from his fingertips. “I feel like you’re encouraging me to ignore my professional ethics. I realise I’m not exactly a model of virtue, but that still sounds very problematic to me.”
“We should celebrate.” He rolled over in Draco’s arms. He didn’t move, for a long time, just memorising all over again every line on his face, the pale grey of his irises, those impossibly long eyelashes, golden where the light caught.
Harry dropped his head back onto Draco’s shoulder. “I love it when you call me darling. I love you, you know. Do I say it often enough?”
Madam Shacklebolt took another biscuit. “You must send Molly my regards, and my compliments,” she said. “And tell me, how do you intend to celebrate your birthday?”
“Does Ginny know?” Harry said, suddenly miserable.
Harry gave him a quick hug of thanks. “And how’s
“I want to be a magi-zoologist when I grow up,” she confided, eyes wide. “D’you think you could introduce me to Luna Lovegood? Only I know you’re close.”
So it was
“I will,” Harry said. He didn’t look at Draco.
Hermione drained her glass, which entirely shattered the impression she was trying to project — that of being utterly calm and collected and of course, right.
“What’s that?” Hermione asked him, brushing her fingertips over the petals of a flower she couldn’t hope to identify. Neville needed to know about this place. She sat back on her ankles, feeling younger and stronger than she had in… well.
“I see.”
Malfoy stirred, and Harry reached out, taking his hand.
Harry tensed, but pretended he hadn’t, shifting instead. “Are you trying to reassure me, or something?”
“No, I — Ginny, there’s no one up — Gin!”
“I will also need to collect some things from the house. And there are questions.”
As they walked, Draco pointed out a few rooms in particular. “The library,” he said, opening the door; the gaslights responded to his presence, and Harry took in a breath. It was almost the size of the Hogwarts library.
She examined it, and took a breath. “It feels so good,” she said. “Not right for me — it’s so… strong,” she said, frowning. “It feels as if it wants to build things.”
Ron squawked; he was getting a little tired of the way everyone assumed he would just do whatever Hermione thought was right. However, since Molly had elbowed in on the issue as well, he looked ready to concede defeat.
Draco spent the rest of his day wondering how, exactly, Potter would get his revenge. Wondering wasn’t helping to calm him down, so he set about some work; first priority was brewing some Dreamless Sleep, since Potter was bound to need more, soon. Draco was surprised he hadn’t asked for more already. Dreamless Sleep, and then some Standard Antidote (useful to have plenty on hand, to adjust to whatever rubbish children were doing to each other these days) and he sat down to mark a pile of papers about the differences between various materials one might use for an athame or spoon.
“I can’t believe I told you that.” Harry frowned, and then seemed to remember something. “I have a Kneazle kitten. Her name is Dora. I picked her out because she seems to have some very odd abilities for a Kneazle.”
Harry was
“Goodnight, Draco,” he said quietly, and headed to his own bedroom to read until he was ready to sleep.
“Harry, my boy,” the old man said, his hands shaking a little as he closed them around one of Harry’s, a little while later. Harry had dawdled terribly, stopping at a Muggle coffee shop to flirt with the man who always made his coffee, and to scarf down a couple of chocolate croissants. He’d stopped at the joke shop to see how George was doing. Angelina was there, and while George looked no less lost than he ever did without his twin, he did smile at her once or twice, quite wistfully.
“Such as?”
It wasn’t really Harry’s kind of music. Not because it was Muggle, but because he preferred music that didn’t prevent people from talking to each other. Give him a couple of guys with acoustic guitars and dirty hair any day. But there was something compelling about them. He found himself staring at the guitar player’s back. Narrow and lean, but his arms were strong; his leather pants hung dangerously from his hips and his black tank top (which looked to have been ripped beneath one arm) made his pale neck look terribly fragile. All of him looked fragile, actually, except those arms; Harry could see where his ribs cut in, and his wrists were as fine and breakable as one of Harry’s more delicate wands. He was covered in tattoos, which Harry had briefly mistaken for a mesh shirt. They were all black, with what looked like a mess of thorny vines tangled around his arms, teasing the hair on the back of his neck.
Madam Shacklebolt’s face was serene and kind, and absolutely serious. And Harry wanted to paste a smile on his face, lie through his teeth, and say that every day was a fucking joy and a privilege — but she was, after all, the head of the Auror Office and rather well primed with a bullshit detector that was famous across all of Europe.
Harry reached out to pat Hermione’s hand fondly. “I’m alright, ‘Mione. I’m not going to break. But you know, if I’d grown up with a Wizarding family I might well have grown up like that. And then I would have been that entitled brat. I wouldn’t have had the fortitude I came to Hogwarts with, and I could well have failed. Refused to do what I had to, or…”
“What’s that?” Hermione tipped her head.
He locked the workroom door, and the door to the shop, and murmured
“If you’re not ready very soon, it will be too late,” Draco said, pressing in close. “You need to trust me. I know that’s hard. I know I was an utter shit, to you, to all of your friends. But we grew up. Right, Harry? My love? We grew up. We’re not those boys anymore.”
“These pies really are fantastic,” Harry said, avoiding Hermione’s eyes and cutting savagely into the crust.
“You are looking for Christmas gifts, Mr Black?” she said, without glancing at him.
Draco rolled his eyes. Narcissa didn’t see, so as soon as she looked at him, he did it again. The second one was so dramatic it actually ached for a moment.
Someone should have told him; someone should have said. This was not just a party. This was courting. Pureblood families by the handful, all the girls decked out in dresses that probably cost a few hundred Galleons each, and men looking like they were determined to find brides amongst these beautiful girls who ignored them prettily. Harry, having no interest in finding a bride, felt as if he was marching to the guillotine. And he clearly had Malfoy all wrong. He burned with the humiliation of it.
“No. Snape did a good thing or two, and he was brilliant. Utterly
Harry made a sound in the back of his throat, and Draco felt his arms twitch. He wanted to reach out and slip his arms around Harry’s body, but he didn’t; it felt for all the world like he was trying to entice a frightened cat, though Harry was neither easy to frighten, nor skittish, ordinarily.
Harry had never really thought about it like that. He filled the teapot with hot water. “Yes,” he said. “I love my life. It’s nothing like I’d ever imagined… not when I was a hungry kid sleeping under the stairs, not when I was at school…” His eyes closed for a moment, breathing it in. “Sometimes I think all of this is a dream, and it’ll go away again, and I’ll be back in the Forbidden Forest, dead under the trees, under the stars. And other times, I think it must be real. After everything that’s happened… I feel I’ve earned this peace.”
Hermione sat up straighter. “You’re close?”
needs Kreacher, and Kreacher…”
“So far, you git, but am I going to get a blowjob this morning, or do I have to make you breakfast first?”
He led Harry to a small parlour with a writing desk and some bookshelves — fiction, Harry noticed to his surprise. One door led to a bedroom (Harry, embarrassed, stepped away from it) and another to a bathroom with dimensions that made no mathematical sense and had a bathtub about three times the size of Harry’s old cupboard.
How funny.
“I’m sorry,” Harry spluttered. “It wasn’t my intention, I just…”
“Oh,” Hermione said with a sigh. “I’ll never forget that. The feeling when my wand came alive in my hand.”
“This weekend, d’you think?” Draco asked.
“Thank you, Draco,” he said instead, and Draco felt something deep inside him quiver with need at the sound of his voice. “Send an elf if you are still sore in the morning.”
Draco staggered to the fireplace and tossed a handful of floo powder into the flames.
“It’s dot dat mad,” Harry replied, which in no way answered her question or appeared to reassure her. Okay, so he couldn’t talk properly and his head felt like it had swollen to twice its size — perhaps it was, indeed, ‘dat mad’.
“I’m Professor Potter. I have the lesson plans from your old professor,” he said. “This year, we’re going to be focusing on the defence spells and counter-curses you’ll need to get through your O.W.L.s. I don’t much like teaching from a book, or learning from one, so it will be a very practical course, though we’ll be using the textbook you all seem to have — does anyone not have one?”
Harry’s throat ached. “I didn’t want to change it,” he admitted. “For a long time, because Sirius —”
He managed to sidle in amongst a group of good-looking Muggles about his own age. He was filing away details of their outfits — costumes, really — those two were definitely writing novels, these two were doing art they described as edgy and subversive and that involved gluing a lot of doll parts together.
Draco gazed at the window. Outside, the sky was so clear that a thousand stars shone. All those constellations, all those grand old Black names.
He watched as she stepped out into the cold street, buttoning the top of her robe and plucking her gloves from her pockets to slip them back on.
“I’m giving you one more chance to leave on your feet and then I’m tossing you into the fireplace with a handful of floo powder. And you’d better believe I don’t care where you end up.”
Harry shook himself and stood straighter, dislodging Draco’s arm. Draco fought the urge to fight back, wrap his arms around Harry’s body and pull him in, apologise, for everything Draco had ever done, and for everything that every Death Eater had done, willingly or not. But he kept his Pureblood, well-raised, Slytherin hands to himself and stood straight.
“I won’t,” Harry said, catching the cups in midair and easing them down onto the table; they seemed eager to participate, and it took a moment and a gentle stroke to calm them down enough to pour the tea. “I think we can all agree that I’ve had a good long rest. I’m eager to catch up on the progress of the Department.”
But she had taken a few steps away, toward Draco’s shelves, and was examining the spines of his books. “I’d love to get lost in this library for a few… months,” she said. “I’m not procrastinating.”
“When you put it like that,” Draco replied, adjusting Harry’s robes before moving to his own. “Yes. And it’s not nonsense, Potter. Your Weasleys have their own traditions. I bet your Muggle relatives do, too, and Granger. Traditions are nice. But we don’t have to worry about those right now. You’ll sit by me for supper where I can poke you in the ribs if you seem likely to say anything too ridiculous.” His face softened. Harry’s expression was part determination and part exhausted resignation, but he looked like he was prepared to try, and that needed to be enough for today. “Don’t worry about the rest. We have plenty of time.”
Draco nodded slowly. He shifted his body language and leaned back in his chair. “Merlin. Dragons. That does sound like fun.”
George’s note came from Angelina. It was a reminder that Draco had been the one to toss Harry the wand that had ultimately led to Voldemort’s destruction, and that George would be alright.
Please note the update to the warnings; this chapter includes previous abuse at the hands of the Dursleys.
Draco didn’t move, didn’t respond. Harry thought he would be better off changing into pyjamas but once he had managed to work Draco’s boots off his feet he was too exhausted to try anything more complicated. And the thought of touching Draco’s body, in however innocent a way, felt like a violation.
Ollivander waved him off. “It’s not that, not at all. The truth is, if someone doesn’t know how to make a wand, you can’t teach them.”
Draco flinched. And then felt grumpy. Of course he wasn’t part of the ‘old gang’.
“Sorry,” Harry said, looking mildly embarrassed. “Er… my magic is a little bit… unpredictable.”
something. But he suddenly didn’t want the answer.
“Hermione,” he said, with a warning in his voice. “I don’t think it’s safe, here; I don’t think this is real.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said. “When will this be over?”
When Harry stepped out of the Floo, Draco was dusting the ash from his pale Healer robes. The lights around the sitting room had begun to glow as soon as he passed through the wards, and the house was as beautiful as he remembered it to be.
“No, I think I’ll have a shower. And you should come with me. I’ll make it worth your while,” Draco said. “Just think. All slippery…”
“I like money,” came a high-pitched voice.
“You want to talk about this?” she asked.
was there, he’d be demanding, and rude, and affectionate, and he’d make cutting comments about how I poached my eggs, and talk me out of my robes, and make me laugh and argue with him… and I was there, in my office, half asleep and there was a sound and I… I knew I couldn’t do it. I didn’t even care what case it was. I only knew they were going to ask me to help with it and that I couldn’t. And I didn’t want to.”
“You know that you may decorate as you wish, Mr Potter,” she said. “Harry.”
“I don’t know I’m fit for any of this, Mother. Let’s be honest, I’m a bit of a twat.”
“Your owl is very lovely,” he said, rather than cause the poor child irrevocable trauma. “What’s their name?”
bought me a lot of presents.”
Harry nodded, and turned to Madam Pomfrey, who was loosening Malfoy’s clothes and cooling his forehead again. “Is he alright?”
Harry didn’t know why he was surprised to hear voices, and laughter. Of course it wouldn’t be just the three of them. He wondered if his clothes were alright, and then he saw Draco, dressed immaculately in tailored trousers, a white linen shirt that was too well-behaved to crease and a waistcoat.
He smiled into Hermione’s neck.
“Again, Draco —
“Well, I am. And I’m a disaster, and the Dark Mark will never really go away, no matter how I mutilate it. He’s the hero of the Wizarding world, and I’m an ex-Death Eater. And one,” he added, noticing the clock above the hearth, “who needs to head back to the castle and get some sleep.”
“There you go again,” the man said, in his lovely Scottish brogue. “Good man.”
“You’re staring at me,” he said, closing his eyes. “It’s very creepy, Potter.”
There were a lot of people in that photograph who Draco recognised, and others who he could guess at. He felt ill. He wished for a fierce moment that he wasn’t a Malfoy, nor a Black. That he had known the warmth of families like these.
