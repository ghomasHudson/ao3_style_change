“Why should I when I have you to do it for me?” Draco says. “Besides, I’m occupied with leading us to our destination. Quite an important job, that.”
The kettle sitting by whistles in rage. Draco brews a cup of tea—white blended with almond and vanilla, excellent for the chill. He pulls on gloves, a second pair of socks, and a thick turtleneck, then steps onto the front porch. Settling the tray of his lunch on the small table, he sits on the wicker chair, sighing in contentment.
around himself as he rushes near the family of stridien wamps. He knows this forest like the back of his hand. But - as dust particles and ghoulish shadows whistle into his headlamp and spread to the sides of his face, as ordinary sites blur into the void around him, he feels like an outsider in his own home.
As Draco clutched those broad shoulders and wrinkled the expensive fabric adorning them, he had half a mind to demand Edmund to be rougher, to stop trying to savor it. Stop making it something to go breathless over.
“We hate each other. So, why was I what you ‘sorely missed?’” Harry asks. Everybody in earshot winces.
Little Billy comes back when Draco’s a few bites in. Letting the earthy, spicy taste of mushroom soup warm up his stomach, he watches Little Billy munch on his own food.
The Indicator can lighten or increase in weight at Draco’s will, a fickle little feature that he’s glad Weasley R. reminded him of. Holding the chain with both hands, he swings it in a circle at his side as he sprints, uncaring about its original purpose.
“Your usual order from the Viet place nearby whenever Pepper-up isn’t sufficient,” Draco murmurs, placing a spoon in Harry’s hand, his words warm against Harry’s temple. Huh, he didn’t think Draco would notice. “You said today you’d deal with those disgusting booby traps you showed me, thus I reckoned I should put the yams on our counter into good use.”
The wolf ducks his head and gives the floor a few sniffs as he scuttles to where Draco was napping last. The door all locked, he ambles to the wolf, who’s rhythmically drumming the floorboards with his tail. Draco’s nose wrinkles at the stench.
His goal is no different than the Foundation’s from now on, and he has no qualms about that. With this opportunity, he is free at last, free to do the work he knows is important, to help and
Small hands pat his back and sides, raising his head up in a way that makes him dizzier than it should. Honey brown eyes flash in worry, wet curls falling into Harry’s face.
“There is an anomalous individual working here,” she says, hard lines etched on her face. “You will act like you’ve not changed your career and continue to ‘work’ in the Ministry. Because of your proximity, we expect you to gather as much information as possible about him. You can use any method, as long as you stay alive and well to report back to us and receive your salary. Not to worry, we will assist you as this individual is, like most of what we deal with, deadly when pushed.”
“For fuck’s sake, boy,” Grammedion fires a hex at Draco’s legs with one hand while he pulls the cloak hood. Freezing static runs up his legs, automatically straightening them and forcing a pained groan out of Draco’s mouth. He lugs Draco’s writhing form to the end of the porch and kicks him down the steps.
Grammedion glances at him. “I think you’ve gotten the order confused,” he says, “I’m the captor. You’re bound on the floor. You’re the one being interrogated, Mr. Malfoy, that trick won’t work on me.”
“He asks if you know he loves you,” Harry says. His head is bent down and focused, missing the slight twitch in Narcissa’s fingers. “Do you know he loves you?”
“Oh, right,” he says, “I heated it up on the stove, but you were taking atrociously long so I cast a Heating charm. Let me take it off, okay?”
The arm Potter had in his mouth earlier has limped to the ground, more meat than skin. Between unfurled fingers lies Draco’s wand. It’s bloodied but not mangled, and Draco does quick work at cleaning it at the sink. Then, kneeling by Grammedion’s broken form, he casts as many healing spells as he can remember. Although, the thing about using spells instead of potions and hands-on equipment is that even though they work, they take a while.
“I was eating dinner when I thought I was going to die of a heart attack at 23,” Potter continues. Draco pulls the drawers out, unable to find a single bag of tea for several excruciating moments. “The next day, I was reading about your mother’s death on the
Sending the objects back to their original places, Draco takes his seat, brows furrowed. He toys with his wand, a tick he hasn’t been able to be rid of ever since Potter’s returned his wand after years of what seemed to be perpetual emptiness without it.
. Hurts like a fucking bitch. One can never really get used to getting punched in the guts, he guesses.
Quiet murmurs from one server to another leak through the soft notes of jazz trickling from speakers. Something clangs in the kitchen. Paper butterflies flutter to their container without prompting.
There’s a pang in Draco’s chest, and judging from the twitch of Potter’s brow, he can feel it too. Not another word is said, the two men merely facing each other from across a tiny kitchen, considering. Draco can feel the warmth of sunlight beaming through the little window and coating his nape as he leans against the sink, earl grey on his tongue. Lovely citric notes of bergamot drift up his nose. He closes his eyes. What to do, what to do.
Draco grimaces in pain. Potter is still staring at the Moon, but his grip has tightened and he’s starting to spasm. Before he starts paying attention to his condition, Draco jerks his arm away from Potter and grabs his wand.
just enough to remove clumps of brown and the stink of dirt and mud. Potter butts Draco’s hand with his muzzle, the latter now noticing the clear lack of blood crusted on fur.
Gramma’s Cabin isn’t very far away. In a while, they’ll get to a shallow stream where they can collect some marsh cinquefoil. After that, it’s another sixteen-minute trek, at least. Draco stops walking and checks his pocket watch.
“I don’t think you’re in the position to be worrying about my clothes, Harry,” Draco says. He glances at the bits of Floo powder fluttering to the floor and continues.
Harry looks up. The way she phrases the question doesn’t make sense; it's like she’s asking someone else. That is, if there’s any other person in the dusty, hazy room except Harry. The planchette quivers then, jackrabbiting across the board.
amused. “Do my ears deceive me? Am I being confronted, cornered, accosted for being a good husband? Were the 5 minutes it took to Shrink and Levitate the wretched old thing away from our safe haven worth your condescension, dear lover?”
But, he feels like doing something different tonight. His joints pop, his knuckles grind. He arches his back and feels the knobs of his spine knocking against each other. He curls his feet, blood rushing to his throat. One moment, his head feels overinflated, overstretched, and the next, he is fine. He is taller now, his jaw sharpened, his neck thick. He spreads his fingers then clenches them into fists.
Potter knocks Draco’s finger away and charges ahead. To the east. Draco reckons Potter’s attitude doesn’t improve much when he has to stop him with a hand on his shoulder and steer him to the west.
Draco shrugs. “Lovegood was thorough. She didn’t work alone, I’m sure you already know that. She did the inventing and inviting, her partners dealt with the logistics. They got the paperwork sorted out for me, changed my name to Castor Lambert. Looks great in cursive.
It’s sweet, that tone, as sweet and numbing as the saliva dripping down his nape. If Draco is someone else, an unfortunate bastard even more miserable than he is, he might have believed it.
Draco’s breath catches in his throat. Swallowing it down, he grabs his mug, scooping out the tea bag just to have something to do. He takes a sip without blowing, ignoring its scalding heat.
Swallowing the harsh tang of iron down, a rich, foreign sweetness floods his senses. It’s the nectar of late-June peaches and lingonberry syrup swirled in chamomile, coating his palate with a luscious glaze. A low moan escapes as his muscles relax. If it’s not for the steady hand on his stomach, Draco’s knees would have hit the dirty ground already.
The wolf closes his jaw a bit, not enough to break the skin, but the pressure is an adequate enough warning. Heat envelops Draco’s hands and condensation burns Draco’s face. Through his blouse, he can feel the tip of Potter’s claws, mere breaths from ripping the linen in pieces. He lets go of Draco's hands and sniffs at his fingers, palms, knuckles. Every instinct in Draco’s being screams at him to stay as stationary and quiet as possible. He doesn't want to know what happens if he lowers his arms.
Draco’s voice dies. He watches the aquamarine glow of the Indicator chase the emerald of Potter’s eyes. It floods the different angles of his face in light - in the silence, Draco sees his chapped lips, the lightning scar that feathers down his right eye onto his cheek, his day-old stubble, the rich brown of skin contrasting bright blue - before decelerating. It stops moving altogether, illuminating his face from below. Draco’s arm quivers.
Everything he has to say has been painstakingly scrubbed out of him, scratching his throat raw and robbing him of air. At this point, he wonders if Hermione was right, that feigning disinterest and focusing on a promotion to work in Switzerland is better than being honest.
“It’s fine,” Harry says. Draco nods once and turns to the fireplace. Without thinking, Harry stands up. “Why’re you going to Pansy’s?”
“You—” Draco frowns. His eyes strain on the cup of tea until they hurt. He squeezes them shut, sighing. “It doesn’t prove anything. Perhaps I’m jealous of my childhood nemesis having a better life than me, ever thought of that?”
“You were so far away in Hagrid’s arms, I couldn’t see your face,” the night had been blinding, but his eyes had found Draco’s anyway. “It felt like my heart died with you.”
The Second Wizarding War ended barely a decade ago. Its victims, both people and nature, still bleed. “I can see why you aren’t very keen on interacting with us up-close these days,” Draco nods, careful.
“Ma’am,” he tries again, “yes, we are near closing time. Therefore, if you order a quick meal as you wait for us to close up, then we shall have our conversation soon after eight. Do you know what you want to order yet?”
“You don’t feel them now, but wait until they set in,” Edmund tries to tug him back, shrugging when he doesn’t obey. “Your abilities. We’ll go back to the House of Collective tonight and when you wake up tomorrow, you’ll know what I’m talking about.”
“Nerve damage,” Draco says, pulling on thin strands of memories he’s tried his hardest to forget. “The Manor reeked of Dark magic and it did a number on everyone who lived there. We witches, we live longer than Muggles and thus, the consequences of old age hit us much later, like when we’re ninety, for example. And yet, Father’s joint pain started in his early thirties and made him use a cane. Mother started losing hair a year or two after she moved into the Manor.
more times than he should have. He knows the marquise droplets of Ginevra’s gems and the chevron curve of her ring, the blankness of Potter’s own band a dream and a question in his mind.
“I know,” Edmund’s thumb swipes over the cut, as soft as a brush dipping into paint. “There’s still blood.”
“Yes,” Draco says, frantic now. He can’t seem to find the crate through his panic, “The seasons are all mixed up, forecasts have never been more wrong, even the lunar cycle is fucked. Muggles blame climate change, I blame Voldemort and his Dark creatures and idiotic rituals. Grammedion, hurry, where’s the Wolfsbane?”
Millimeters beside Draco’s hand on the counter, glinting in the sun, is a wedding band. Draco knows Potter and Ginevra’s in and out, has examined the picture on that day’s issue of the
“You’ll only be at the House of Collective until we get you accustomed to your new life, then you can return home. Or,” Edmund tilts his head to the side, “you can stay. It’s akin to a commune, there’s space for all. It’s in the middle of the woods, too, hidden behind extensive wards and Charms, very private. Don’t you love your privacy?”
Cracking open the dirty window right beside his bed, the cool scent of fog and sleepy meadows wafts against his face. A gentle tap of his wand, and the paper crane floats away into the night with minute flaps of wings. Where is it going? He never knows. To his love?
She crosses her legs. “We’ve had our eyes on you for a while, Dr. Malfoy. We need someone who’s willing to look for the oddity in the mundane, and when our people heard rumours of the infamous Malfoy heir having a—highly accurate, by the way—fixation on conspiracy theories and cryptozoology, visiting various parts of the world in pursuit of those ‘tall tales,’ we knew we need your intellect.”
"What? No,” he frowns, staring at the steaming bowl of soup on the table, then at the throw draped over his lap. “What the hell’s all this?”
“I’m cold, too,” Draco sits on his own chair, curling his legs up. He sets his soup bowl on his knee. “Do you know what I do when I’m cold? Eat hot things and dress warmly. Works like heaven.”
His hair is of the lightest shade of blonde, akin to snow. His skin is tan, littered with scars and tattoos, but something tells the Boy King that it used to be paler than ever. Unmarked, unmarred. His silver eyes are glassy under the moonlight, to the point where they seem transparent.
His hand flies to his mouth. “Oh, sorry. I don’t really speak about this to anyone. That was a tangent, I’m sorry.”
A squawk rips from Potter’s throat during the process. Draco shushes him. He leans up to Potter’s face.
A chair tumbles onto the ground. Shouts explode into existence, footsteps thumping. Draco grips Potter’s left forearm as Potter’s wand effortlessly slides out of its holster into a waiting hand. The fizzling heat of hastily casted hexes slice through the air. With his mother’s shout of relief in his ears, Draco succumbs to the squeezing suffocation of Apparition.
“You’re so fucking stupid,” Draco can feel a headache building. “That was a horrible decision. I never imagined you—you!—out of all people, could be this irresponsible. What the fuck.”
“Okay, but why are we even going there? Didn’t you and the other Potioneers stock up on all the important potions?”
Harry vaguely feels himself say, “You're welcome,” then averts his eyes. He doesn’t look at the Scale of Truth. He doesn’t look at the board nor its planchette.
“Don’t look,” Edmund nips his ear lobe, “unless you want further mortification. You mortals are ashamed of the strangest things, I can smell it on you.”
Draco leans his head back against the wall. “I take it I won’t be getting out of here any time soon,” he might as well make himself comfortable. “Well, what’s your so-called plan, then? Keep me entertained.”
Never mind, he has things to do. Has to take a shower, get dressed, trim his beard. Put on his best shoes and hit the Leaky, catching Seamus’s signature grin as he waits for Harry to get to the table and share the good news. Inform everybody that he’s done it, has cut things off and drawn this five-year epic of a ruse to a close. Order grumbling friends to pay up, their fault for betting that he wouldn’t have the balls to do it within 3 days.
at the broken window, Draco trudges to the wall opposite Grammedion’s cage and leans against it. His knees buckle and he slides to the floor, eyes already slipping shut. He draws his cloak around him more tightly, flipping his hood over dirty hair. The open window was letting cold air into the cabin, the chill settling into his pores, and the temperature inside is likely to not rise any time soon. Heating charms are useless; he has no intention of snapping himself awake every fifteen minutes to reapply it. Exhaustion surges through him, glacial and unsympathetic, pressing on his lashes. Lifting his wand just the slightest bit to cast an Alarm charm on Grammedion so he can be notified when the man sits up, Draco nestles into the cloak, falling into what must be the deepest sleep of his life.
Draco doesn’t need to think; he’s done enough of that in the past two months, since the day he opened his front door to see the strange woman’s sharp smile. But he thinks anyway, one last time before he answers.
“You can thank me by taking off those horrid gears faster and come here,” with that, Draco crawls back to where he was sitting before.
invention and charmwork, meddling with cosmic magic, practically kidnapping people and sending them away with no way back. You know she’s probably doing this because she wants to use you as a test subject for her, I don’t know, transgalactic experiments, right? Everything could’ve gone to shite. How are you supposed to return if I’m not here?!”
“The Death Eaters caught me long before the attack and tortured me with my children chained up on the opposite wall,” Grammedion’s voice doesn’t hitch, doesn’t change, like he’s used to thinking of the scene. “They wanted to utilize Fenrir more, but his notoriety was chasing new weres away and they started joining the Order. I came up with a plan, and my kids each got a gorgeous room in the Malfoy Manor. Tell me,” he looks at Draco, “does Grimmauld Place have enough space for those weres the Order adopted?”
The fruit bowl is already depleted and the gliders are on their way out, pausing to tumble onto Draco’s head before leaping out the window. He tilts his head, not stopping his stirring, and feels clever paws climbing up from his shoulder. Little Billy swipes his tail on Draco’s forehead as a good-bye, then joins his colony.
Draco sags against Edmund’s strong chest, head lolled to the side, panting. They have stopped before it got too much this time, yet Draco still teeters over the edge of insanity with every suckle of lips, every caress of tongue. Edmund has been gentle, large hands cupping Draco’s face like he’s a priceless treasure made of opals and emeralds, combing through the slightly wavy hair Draco has grown out. He has fixed Draco’s shirt as he plucked off every scrap of sense remaining in Draco’s head, has stroked the purple marks in bloom, and covered them with the bomber jacket.
Draco takes it in, then, unable to help himself, curls his lips at Potter and his attire. At his artfully gelled hair, his hanging bow tie, the elegant boutonniere on the lapel of his dark blue suit. His empty ring finger.
“I could’ve, but I spent most of those days in denial. Then the dots connected and I couldn’t deny it anymore, so I decided to just go through with the wedding regardless, be with the woman I loved. Hoped that maybe the odd emotions I had would go away,” he shrugs, raising his eyes to meet Draco’s. “Saw Ginny at the end of the aisle and, well, I couldn’t stop thinking that it should’ve been someone else. All this time, I’ve thought that she didn’t feel… right in my arms, but I pushed it down. And there she was in that white dress.
“Healer Yamamoto will tell Potioneers Jensen and Reyes what to bring for werewolf-inflicted wounds,” Draco’s Thestral paws the floorboard; his message is getting rather long. “Other than them, get whomever you deem fit to handle a traitorous spy. Don't ask. You’ll know when you're here.”
He doesn’t understand why—he’s never understood much, now that he thinks about it—but he’s taken to writing those three words before every message. It feels nice, he supposes, to pretend there’s someone who looks forward to reading his letters, regardless of how boring or awful they are. No matter, a tiny phrase never hurts anyone. He hopes. How many things (small, insignificant things) did he say that—?
Noises of jars clinking and cabinets closing reach his ears. Energy replenished at the familiar figure, Draco jogs to the rows and rows of glass containers, each filled with potion ingredients labeled in lovely cursive. He nods at the grey head of hair at his right.
Draco pushes away as far as Edmund’s firm grasp allows, which is only a few centimeters away. Whatever his blood did with Draco’s own, it snaps him awake with startling clarity just as swiftly as when it’s reduced him to a little more than a rag doll. Everything is so sharp it’s almost disgusting, like his eyeballs are gouged out, scrubbed clean, then shoved back in again. Draco locks his legs, willing himself not to stumble.
Draco spreads his hands and purses his lips, brows high on his forehead. “What more do you want me to say?”
“Stop zoning out,” Potter’s voice cuts through his assessment. “I mean, no rush. But the sooner we leave, the better.”
“So demanding,” Edmund leans back and looks at Draco like he’s seeing him for the first time, a hint of humor in his serene demeanor. “The House of Collective is where the majority of us in Britain frequent and reside. The newly Turned are brought there to be with their brethren. Trying to deal with these new abilities alone is what makes them go Rogue and lands them on the front page. Think Jeannette McDermott, the poor woman.”
Draco has spoken to Weasley C. three times in total, each conversation spanning about fifteen seconds.
“Those three dates were nothing more than bouts of insanity. My apologies, I was in a moment of weakness and was somehow fooled by your… Merlin, I don’t even know. Basically, you were a passing fancy that I will rue ever having for the rest of my life.”
“Intelligence, Mr. Malfoy, is your greatest asset,” Grammedion nods, “but it’s also your biggest downfall. It makes you arrogant, inattentive. If it’s not for your dreaded headlamp, neither you nor your colleagues would ever detect the minute changes in those vials until it’s too late. What would the Order think if their prized Potions Master can’t even recognize pure versus contaminated Wolfsbane? Indeed, we were betting on your negligence.”
Lovegood’s lips stretch into a beatific grin. The straw hat on her head slightly tips to the side, blanketing half of her face in shadows.
One good thing about growing up too quickly is that Potter is mature enough not to argue back. He only narrows his eyes at Draco and makes him uncomfortably aware of the fact that if he steps a centimeter closer, he can feel Potter’s body heat.
He keeps the interesting ones in his court, but most are awfully boorish. Some even remind him of bad things. Bad people. He drives them out. When he feels like it, he collects their eyes. The Boy King cannot just get help from any intruder he finds.
She flicks her wand, and the chair in front of her slides back with a small screech. Draco flinches. He doesn’t sit down.
It’s a dark, dusty corner, but his headlamp is still on. Its light catches the colour of the vial for a split second as he rises, and Draco halts, squinting at them. The liquid inside is of a deep shade of violet, but… deeper than usual. Since when does Draco start mixing up colours? His head hasn’t stopped spinning from the Apparition yet, that might be why.
But the Boy King wants more. His power comes with the freedom to do anything he wants, within reason and within closed gates. Therefore, if he wants complete omnipotence, he needs to be completely free. He needs to be free.
He fiddles with his watch, murmuring something like ‘got time.’ Turning to Draco, Potter’s eyes remain empty of bitter harshness, but they’re fierce. Draco thinks of courtyards and immature duels, and represses a wistful, a bit regretful, sigh.
With the glass now rinsed and settled once more on the drying rack, Harry drags his feet to the bedroom. The clock - an antique Draco stole from his cheating ex - hits 7:18 PM, but getting ready to go to sleep sure sounds like a decent idea. Harry palms the back of his aching neck and winces. He’d go shower, scrub the dirt and tension off his limbs, and maybe heat up the leftovers from two days-
“No,” Grammedion backs away as if he can’t stand to be near Draco. A part of him breaks. In some ways, he is like the mentor Draco’s never had, his patience and perspective far superior to Severus's (bless his cold, dead heart). “You’re redeemed, aren’t you? Favored by the rest of the Order, especially Harry Potter. He argued for you, didn’t he? Nobody ever did for me.”
He has to confess, the once awkward, malnourished teen has grown into quite a formidable young man. War has a way of aging its victims, especially ones spanning half a decade long, and Chosen One or not, Potter has no choice but to succumb to its grasp. Lankiness turns to muscles, moodiness turns to stoicism, obedience turns to perceptiveness, and bullheadedness-
“No, it’s not,” Pansy says. She’s a Healer, so she’s probably right. But Draco prefers to ignore that.
Those canines are back on the base of his neck. The arm that isn’t wrapped around his middle slithers across his chest, calloused palm an anchor on his shoulder blade. Draco wonders if this looks intimate, possessive—protective, even—to their observer, when he simply feels choked. A mouse gripped within the gentle loops of a snake’s body.
“I’m not going back,” Draco says. “Look, regardless of her intentions, it’s not like Luna just dropped me off blind without preparation. I mean,” he rolls Billy over on his palm and scritches the soft underbelly, “I certainly didn’t know that the line between the Wizarding and Muggle world is so thin here, to the point where these sugar gliders are living right outside people’s homes. But again, nothing I can’t handle. If I have to rate, it’s five over five for customer service.”
—but he cannot understand what. All he knows is that this man is here to see to the Boy King’s demise.
“Sisters,” Edmund says. The hand on Draco’s jaw edges to his neck, thick fingers adding a slight squeeze to the vulnerable valley on either side of his Adam’s apple. Draco sighs into Edmund’s mouth. “Surely you don’t think there’s only one of us out there?”
Harry looks up from his slippered feet to see Draco. Or, more specifically, Draco’s silhouette. Behind some kind of white cloth. A white cloth that’s conveniently placed where the focus of the bedroom should’ve been.
“But you haven’t changed yet,” Harry frowns. Pansy loves people she considers hers dearly, but if one doesn’t at least attempt to look put-together, they can’t step a foot into her house without it getting chopped off.
Just as Potter’s huge, black claws snag on his cloak and tear, Draco does the last thing he is supposed to do. He Disapparates.
“I may be a bit absentminded these days, but I remember this,” Potter looks like he’s hearing Draco list out his crimes. “That savior complex of yours, always taking the blame. No, it’s not. There’s nothing that could keep me from serving my sentence. I can barely remember your testimony, let alone resent you for it.”
The only one in the vicinity is his mother, whose sobs are choked off by heavy chains. His father has fled. Probably died, too, bless him.
It’s quiet. The fireplace seems more subdued, as if it only deigns to burn enough to warm a single person instead of two. Harry falls back against his armchair, staring at nothing. His temples ache for some reason, like he’s spent the past hour stretching his unfocused eyes into slants to see better. If it is so, it doesn’t work. Harry feels like he’s blinder than ever.
“There’s no need to order one. I would’ve borrowed it from Hermione if you had only asked,” Potter says. “Instead, I got curious and read it for myself. That’s how I connected the dots about the heartache, how I realized we’ve both had it since that day years ago.”
She slides the file toward him and settles back against her chair. Draco is admittedly no less surprised than before.
“Potter,” Draco gasps, leaning up to try and see. About a hundred meters from the cabin, lurking behind the trees and bushes is a hulking shape, hidden in the dark, but Draco can’t mistake the gold in those gleaming eyes.
“Well,” Hermione muses, two of her fingers poking out from the fluffy towel to grip Viktor’s sleeve, who has crouched close to her with rosy ears, “at least neither one is strong enough to throw punches right now. An actual conversation once in a while would be nice.”
“Gosh, I,” Harry says. Mumbles, really, into Draco’s collarbone, filling his brain with the woodsy aroma of potion-making that no amount of expensive body products can mask, “that’s lovely, baby, thank you.”
They go out the next morning, Pansy in thick makeup and Draco practically drunk under nine layers of Charms. The air is a bit humid, which seems to get worse when the bustling street intensifies in volume into a roaring din. Pansy pulls him under an awning, yanking at his sleeve a bit to try out her disgusting sugary coffee. She always does this whenever she wants to take his attention away from something, which means he just has to look at exactly where she’s doesn’t want him to. As his lips wrap around her lipstick-stained straw, he glances up.
“I hate to do this to you, for I have come to value your presence and worldview. But Mr. Malfoy,” Grammedion squats down, elbows on his knees, his face right in front of Draco’s, “it’s not about reputation; it’s about trust. If the head of a team critical to the cause disappoints, who will everyone else turn to? Who can they blame? Who can they trust after that? And by then, your recollection of this discussion would have been wiped, and I’d be long gone.”
with you!” Draco whirls around, teeth bared. Potter recoils. “You’ve been acting so odd for weeks now. Just what is your preoccupation with making me-”
"Yeah, five whole years, then another five to figure out a rescue plan. Toughest case we ever got," Potter tugs his ear.
“What do you want me to do about this?” He says. “I didn’t make you run out of your own wedding. If you expect me to take the blame for your inane decisions, the first person I Floo wouldn’t be the Aurors, but Ginevra Weasley herself.”
Then, his husband reseats himself, this time with a smell. A mouth-watering, delicious smell, tickling the back of Harry’s nose. He opens his eyes to see Draco lifting off the lid of a ceramic bowl perched on a tray, steam floating out and fogging Harry’s glasses. It’s purple yam soup, topped with chopped up shrimp and ground beef.
“Then, if you don’t hate me,” Potter lifts his head, peering into Draco’s eyes, “would it be so bad to go back with me?”
Draco fills his lungs with air, making as little noise as he can. He takes a step back from Potter, who flinches.
“As I thought, I forgot something,” Dr. Stewart sighs, the first sign of human imperfection leaking through. She searches through her briefcase, long nails clicking through the files. “Sit down, please, and there’s no need to pack up your belongings.”
“While I’m glad that your fearless leader has hastened my plan beyond my comprehension - thanks ever so - I will not die because of him tonight,” Grammedion unlocks the door and throws it open. Gasping, Draco claws Grammedion’s hands enough to draw blood, his legs regaining enough energy to hook behind the entryway.
“Good,” Edmund whispers. At this point, Draco wouldn’t be surprised if that’s not even his real name, “good.”
Harry glances at the crown of his head. The man doesn’t sound surprised; Harry wagers that he already knows and decided to make one for the both of them today.
Not very certain of what to say, Draco purses his lips instead. Edmund lets out an amused hum and indulges him, sucking on his bottom lip. It’s good, so good, until it becomes sickening, like raiding the entirety of Fortescue’s stockroom. Being a creature of the night is rapidly losing its novelty.
“Might I remind you who here has any actual idea of where Gramma’s Cabin is?” Draco checks his pocket watch. Two hours until sundown.
“And yet, they won’t,” Grammedion says. “They will blame you first because you are the one Potions Master they trust, the one person whose duty is to gather and inspect high-quality ingredients to serve their purpose. In spite of that, you fail. What would
“Who have it the—oh,” Potter straightens, touching his forehead in realization. His hand slides back to his nape. “Fuck, how did I forget?”
Its body is so tiny compared to Potter’s hands. Draco is struck with how much space Potter takes up, how much his presence engulfs.
“I hope you’re proud,” he says, when he’s sure Grammedion is conscious enough to hear him. “Look at you. Fucked with every single thing in this godforsaken cabin, now I can’t even make a simple anesthetic potion for you. I hope you’re lying there, knowing that you’ll be in pain for the next eight hours, knowing that you did this to yourself.”
Draco glances at the spoon sitting to the side and refrains from asking Potter if he knows the incantation to Scourgify. He gets a new spoon anyway. Ten minutes after walking away, Potter calls him back.
As they move through the forest, the trees get denser, the air wet. The grass is thicker under their feet, vines stretch and sprawl in between rocks. As shadows elongate and darkness prowls, Draco suspects that at times, they might have even stepped on small carcasses. Potter has finished with his task, leaving spinaberry trees bare and shivering in his wake. He wraps the leaves with a Conjured towel and Vanishes the basket, then hands the neat bundle to Draco.
“Full Moon?” Potter furrows his brows and lifts his head. The clouds clear, and the perfectly circular Moon shines her light onto them both. His face empties. He stares at it as if he’s in a trance.
Harry points to his wet hair with the hand holding his towel. Draco clicks his tongue and waves his hand more aggressively.
Draco gnaws his bottom lip and wets the still-throbbing cut on it. Then, he rolls his eyes, sliding them shut. No big deal.
” appliances, but he got there in the end. Despite his constant bitching about everything, Draco not once raised a word about the drastic switch, effortlessly guiding Narcissa to gossip about the Albescu clan’s abhorrent matriarch when she asks about how he’s faring.
Draco bites the inside of his cheek and looks away. The only consequence from that horrid night was his fucked up heart and nothing else, nothing at all. Whatever Potter is insinuating, he hates it. He hates this. He hates
An almost imperceptible weight perches on his shoulder. A wet snout flicks at his cheek, long, bushy tail brushing his nape. Only one glider likes to linger like so on him, the one with just a single ear.
Swiveling his head, he had gawked at Harry, who had still been standing in the corner with his arms crossed, confusion and hysteria in the arch of his aristocratic brows.
Potter swings his knife with a tad bit more hostility this time but has the sense to not escalate matters. Draco doesn’t mind it; he knows giving Potter something productive to do instead of stewing in thick-headed frustration the entire evening will only benefit the both of them.
. If I’m not, I’d just pick you up from a club, drink from you, leave you behind that dumpster over there, and you’d wake up feeling hungover with no memory of me,” Edmund goes on, his face close. If Draco tries, he reckons he can swallow down the intoxicating spice of cologne wafting against his cheek. “But I’m not doing that, now, am I?”
Ron agrees, albeit a bit unwillingly, and settles back to watch the show as Malfoy’s two cronies and Pansy Parkinson hurry over.
"Luna was good at what she did, we’ve been onto her but couldn’t obtain the evidence necessary to build a case. When we did, we had to reverse-engineer the spellwork of her entire, er, system to figure out where each victim was and open a two-way portal. It was hell, she wouldn’t say anything and before we decided to, y’know, make her take Veritaserum and get her memories to put in a Pensive, she put herself in a magically-induced coma. Been sleeping for, like, four years now.”
“I tampered with them,” Grammedion replies, resigned. “Everything here, actually. Admittedly, the Full Moon tonight has hastened my plans. Made it unpredictable, but nothing I can’t fix.”
Something leaps in Draco’s chest and splatters on the floor of his stomach. Placing her hand over his heart, Pansy frowns at him. She doesn’t ask why Potter stared at someone who looked like a stranger to him. Only tells him to start finding answers.
“You don’t want to kill someone on your first transformation, or on any transformation at all in the future. I know you,” Draco’s arms are starting to burn. Potter’s relentlessness, surprise surprise, still shines through even in dog form. “You will regret this if you kill him. Potter, Potter, let go. Let go.
Across the street, a couple strolls through a gushing crowd. Fiery red hair, airy laughter, a pale arm wrapped around her fiancé’s waist. Curls of black, sleek spectacles, a protective palm on his fiancee’s shoulder. They make the perfect picture, a vibrant oil painting. Their existence is formed from bold strokes of sunlight and starburst kisses, with the focal point being a shock of phthalo green and cadmium lemon, two minute specks that make all the difference. As all good paintings do, they pin the viewer on the spot, as if the viewer himself is a thing to behold. Then they shift away.
“Grammedion, you planned this? Oh, fuck you, honestly,” Draco struggles even harder against the twine.
Draco laughs, a momentary rumble of his chest, then moves forward to click something on the laptop. Harry’s on his fifth spoonful of pure comfort when the jazz music stops, and on the blank wall opposite from their blanket fort is the title card of a movie. Strange, Harry didn’t even notice the mini projector. He squints.
He turns to the front door. There it is, a knock. More like a thud, really, like a particular beast is once again barreling into it.
He doesn’t know everything, but he knows his findings are not safe in anyone’s hands but his. The Ministry still repeats its tendency to care more about itself than the common people. The Department of Mystery, practically its own entity due to how even the Minister is forbidden from accessing most of its files, has motivations he can’t comprehend, which means motivations he can’t predict. There is no way to know if his colleagues are truly interested in “that old wife’s tale, that Bigfoot, Cthulhu shite Malfoy’s into” or will report him to those who know how to deal with him, to Unspeakable Granger, to the Department of Mysteries. His findings are not safe in anyone’s hand but his.
It darts from one letter to the next, Harry so used to each one’s placement that he can generally tell what the spirits want to say before they even finish.
He has a lapful of Draco, a lungful of peach and cedar scented shampoo, and the sleepy timbre of his husband’s voice against his chest. The Italian movie is the last thing on Harry’s mind.
Harry squints at her, the pieces in his head drudging through quicksand to connect. They’re getting close, a conclusion’s about to be made, but his body aches and his brain has smoothened with fatigue and. Hmm. He hasn’t eaten since yesterday’s lunch. Must be why he’s fucking beat.
Harry almost throws the planchette on the table and risks the consequences for such a disrespectful act, but he refrains from doing so. Setting it down without a sound, he leans back against the squeaking armchair, leaving his things unpacked. Hesitant fingers against a stubbled cheek, Harry catches Narcissa’s eyes.
“So he did,” Narcissa peers at the yellowed windows as if she can clearly watch the overgrown garden. “How do we know if a spirit is at peace?”
High-pitched chirps fill the tiny kitchen, and he doesn’t need eyes to know that at least three more gliders have flown in.
Draco’s fingers tighten around Edmund’s arm in warning. He doesn’t say ‘goodbye,’ but he does look to the street light opposite the alleyway. Before the Apparition wrenches all the thoughts out of his head, Draco vows not to think about the expression on that face.
When he doesn’t give one, the canines on his exposed shoulder threaten to break the skin. Unexpectedly, they lift off.
Past Edmund’s sturdy form and angular lines, out in the main street, the thin crowd of pedestrians pass by in chattering groups and pairs. Opposite to the alley, however, one lone figure stands just out of reach of the street lamp. The yellowish light merely suggests their existence as they lean against the restaurant Draco and Edmund exited from earlier. The bright tell-tale red of a cigarette butt is visible but other than that, no detail to be discerned. Looks like someone who’s just minding their own business.
Potter uncrosses his legs and stands up so quickly his chair almost knocks over. He paces back and forth, scratching at his stubbles and pinching the bridge of his nose. It’s a bit crooked to the right, and for a moment, Draco can feel the crunch of cartilage and bone beneath his sole. He exhales. The memory evaporates.
With a 'pop', Draco appears out of thin air and slams onto the ground. Oxygen burns in his lungs. There’s a reason why Tonks stressed to the Potioneers repeatedly not to test the anti-Apparition wards she’s helped strengthen around Gramma’s cabin. Thank Merlin no one is seeing him right now, heaving and wheezing while dots litter his vision.
“My mother,” he says, watching Potter’s irises get swallowed up by pure black. “Remember what she did for you, Potter, please. She can’t stay here…”
Has to get some drinks to start, then head to a proper club, it’s nearly the weekend. Avoid the crushing disappointment that Luna has no qualm hiding from him. Make it back home after midnight, way after Draco’s returned to pack his bags—he doesn’t like to stay out past 11—and
“You are the exception,” she says. “We need professionals in the occult, especially those who dabbled in the Dark Arts along with other types of magic. Not many wizards of your kind in Great Britain remember the Original Gods and Old Magic, but you have that link, whether it be through honest religious belief or just intensive research.”
This time, both hands are in the pants pockets. The cigarette has stopped its light bouncing, now lying still between pillowy lips. Like before, the voyeur is a statue amidst a sea of movement.
“Did you not hear me? Conjure a knife,” Draco frowns. He doesn’t mean to sound vexed. Looking at the ground, he grabs two rocks and tosses them at Potter, who catches them with (enviable, he admits) Seeker reflexes, “and a basket, too. You don’t need to do much. Touch the spinaberry leaves with any sharp object and they will simply fall off. Collect them, I need more for the Bloodclot antidote.”
He stands there, unable to do all but look at the particularly orange tile four paces from his position.
The pair fall silent and keep walking. For some inane reason, Draco’s chest squeezes all the more with each step. Chewing on his bottom lip, he glances back at Potter once again. The man looks miserable, biting back expletives at every sting the spinaberry leaves slice into his skin, which Draco has anticipated and worn a cape for.
That wet nose touches the twine around his wrists and after a couple of sniffs, Draco watches in astonishment as the wolf softly bites at the knots. When one breaks free, Potter grunts and hops off Draco's body, sniffing the earth and running up the stairs. He claws on the front door, teeth bared, leaving deep slashes on the wood.
“Indeed,” Draco says, looking back at him. Smiles, because Potter remarked he doesn’t do so very often. “I can tell you where to get some if you plan on hunting with your bare hands more regularly in the future.”
“He never let anyone but him enter the fort, remember? Back when he’s still making us build it for him?” Draco’s fingers tap a random rhythm on Harry’s stomach. Harry tightens his arm around him, shifts a bit. “So many forts and I still didn’t know what it’s like to be in one.”
by Elise Arrowlane, limited edition,” he says, unbothered by Draco’s slackened jaw. “You ordered it from the new bookstore on Diagon months ago. You were small and old and grey, but I recognized you. I always could.”
Harry sighs inwardly. When he first started this career, he had expected his Master of Death status to be enough for clients to believe him. As it turns out, it usually takes about ten sessions and an expensive investment in the Scale of Truth for them to even start looking at him with something other than polite indulgence. His work has spoken for itself, though, and to his contentment, the number of skeptics is dwindling by the day.
“Know this, know that, you know nothing,” Draco lunges forward, only for Potter to twist out of the way and raise the package out of his reach.
Left hand tucked in a pants pocket, the other tapping the fine ash from a cig into a puddle on the concrete. It lifts to hover in front of full, waiting lips. One sleepy bloke trudges by, a heavy bag slung over his shoulder. A hazy billow of smoke spills forth lazily as the bloke walks out of view, opaque clouds masking an expressionless face before disintegrating into the night.
He turns to look at his husband. When Harry’s career was starting to take its toll on his magical core, Draco didn’t hesitate to dive headfirst into Muggle living. Easier said than done, and it took months for him to stop frowning at the “absolutely bizarre, Potter, bi
The flames in the fireplace crackle, a flare of heat and a pop of sound. A waterfall of pale-blonde hair, blue eyes that have lost their sparks, telling him that this has gone too far. Dean’s already paid, then Seamus, then Lavender, then most of the Gryffindor alumni. A bet between two festering into a conspiracy between all.
The Boy King exists in many forms. Three, to be specific. It is a small number, but his subjects can only dream of having more than one restricting form. That is if they can think in the first place, let alone dream. Alas, they cannot. It is why he is the Boy King and not them.
“You—you,” Potter gestures at poor, innocent Billy, “you can’t stay here just to play with some fucking flying squirrels. What about the Draco Malfoy of this universe? What if the War is still going on and they find you?”
“You must think yourself funny,” Draco says, arching his neck to accommodate the kisses peppering his skin, “using my own shame against me. I doubt people even remember there’s an alleyway here.”
“I have a Trace on me,” Grammedion growls. He spots what Draco is doing and kicks his hands, hard. He keeps kicking until Draco almost keels over, as if he's been waiting for this opportunity. “You can’t take me to Grimmauld’s unless you want Death Eaters at your door. You can’t do shit to help or my children will be fucking dead. And stop fucking trying to escape, it’s no use,” the rosy welts on Draco’s wrists now open and bleed.
“That’s what irresponsible Turning looks like. If we want to Turn someone, it must be carefully considered and planned, for there must always be more prey than predators. Such is the law of nature,” Edmund says it like it’s a walk in the park rather than changing people’s entire lives. “Deacon Frangos was careless—amateur little weakling—and wanted something more thrilling than, say, going to clubs for gullible drunks.
“Perhaps in another universe, I’ll take your hand, Potter,” he says, folding his legs onto the chair. Billy falls onto his lap with a squeak. “For now, little Billy and I are quite content where we’re at.”
Harry nods, suppressing a shiver. It’s cold out, middle of November, and one touch of Draco’s hand is enough to tell Harry that he’s fresh from the shop, sweaty and too warm. Squeezing the palm on his shoulder, he smiles up at Draco. The man watches at his expression for a second before retrieving his hand from Harry’s grasp.
Heavy, black claws pinning Draco’s chest to the ground, the wolf presses on top of him, easily covering the entirety of Draco’s body with his massive frame. If there's any remaining doubt that this is Potter, it’s eliminated with the white streak of fur crossing through his right eye, a stark contrast to his black fur. Draco curls his bound hands into fists and swings them upward, punching Potter's jaw from right under. A torn piece of fabric flutters from its mouth onto the ground - is that from the stream? Draco’s legs scramble and push his body from under the wolf. He barely gets on his feet when Potter snarls and bites his cloak, causing him to fall on the ground once more. Draco hopes whatever deity is watching has a grand old time.
“I want to give you something,” he says, holding the mystery object out in a closed fist. Draco frowns, tempted to let his face shift into something long-past and glare at the man in front of him. “Come, now, don’t be stubborn.”
Draco’s vision darkens as red lips touch his. His nose clogs up for a brief moment, overwhelmed by the onslaught of scents and tastes. With every languid swipe of a clever tongue, copper as bitter as Charon’s obol forces its way into his mouth. A sharp needle of pain pricks his bottom lip. Draco flinches, tries to take a step back but the hand on his jaw keeps him close. One long finger sneaks into his mouth, prying it apart.
He’s not certain about the windows, but there’s no harm in trying. Pulling out the Indicator, Draco wills it to weigh more and swings, brushing aside the ominous creak his shoulder makes. With an ear-splitting crash, the Indicator plunges a decently sized hole in the glass, spidery cracks spanning a portion of the window. Panicked hexes are hurled from the inside, and Draco ducks out of the way. Silver eyes meet gold; in an instant, Potter leaps straight through the window.
He gets back up on his feet, index and middle finger shakily looping the silver chain of the Indicator and flicking his wrist. The orb flies upward and when it lands on his palm, it returns to its state as a brooch. He pins it back on his cloak, peering at the torn corner at the bottom. That could’ve been his leg.
Weasley C. is, predictably, bulky since he wrestles dragons for a living, the scars crisscrossing his arms and his medium-length ponytail doing wonders to spark a few longing sighs. But Draco can acknowledge in private that Potter’s facial structure is disturbingly agreeable and that he’s built like a brick house. Draco supposes he should be jealous, but there’s no reason to. What with his refusal to leave the potion lab on most days, Draco only bothers exercising enough to stay alive on the field and make mirrors swoon over his biceps. Plus, seeing Potter’s kilometer-long shoulders in front of him always makes his day for whatever reason. The man makes an exceptional human shield.
“Before Draco Malfoy is given the Dementor’s Kiss as punishment for his crimes, relatives and loved ones are now allowed to say their last words to him,” the Wizengamot judge whose name Draco has let slipped out of his mind in a daze says with a bored drawl.
Draco sucks in the stale air with a hiss. He’s pulled his date this far into the alley because he didn’t want curious onlookers as they snog. Bad fucking idea that was. Still, the thought of strangers witnessing this horrid moment fills him with dread. They can’t do anything to help anyway, only to humiliate him even more.
“Right. Luna’s convinced that dumping people into a whole another reality altogether is the solution to unhappiness and whatnot. I mean, it really wasn’t that much of a surprise, to be honest. She means well, but she’s just that ‘mad scientist' type.”
Draco’s eyes open with a heavy drag, allowing in but a sliver of light. In the misty blurriness, he sees a smirk. One stark-white canine pulls the bottom lip inward, pierces through papyrus skin.
“Do you really think so?” Potter’s jaw clenches. From here, Draco can see a vein trailing down his arm, his fist tight. “What about me?”
“Fifteen. Nearly, not really,” Potter says. “Fourteen and some months. You missed Hogwarts’s ten-year reunion.”
Harry repeats the question and the planchette draws a decisive line toward the word ‘Yes.’ Something clinks. The two occupants of the room look in its direction at the same time.
Draco’s voice doesn’t waver as he says, “Parkinson Estate.” With his old shirt stained with drying sweat, stuffed in a dirty pair of overalls, he walks forward, engulfed by a roar of green.
Draco throws her a look. She replies by jabbing his back with her mop handle and turning away. He swallows, then slowly sits on the chair, not sliding it close to the table. His eyes move to the black binding of the menu and stay there. Lovegood closes it and rests her elbow upon it, no manners whatsoever.
“So many questions, Potter,” Draco mumbles, watching Potter’s eyes shutter close and his face burrow into Draco’s stomach. “When will you answer them for me?”
“He was but a child,” he hears his mother scream. A deafening crash echoes throughout the vast space as her chains weigh more with each word spoken out of turn, forcing her to the dirty floor. “A child!”
He looks back to the front. It’s not his fault Potter lets petty irritation ruin his oversight and refuses to listen to Draco half the time. It’s not his fault Potter has treated him like this despite everything. Draco’s proven his loyalty by poisoning his own Father - a feat that repays him in nightmarish recollections of flayed hands clinging to Draco, a gasped out “son," the man's last breath - before he could do too much damage as Voldemort’s right-hand man. He’s been developing most of the Order’s potion stock. He’s apologized to Hermione by improving her plans and dragging her to bed when she’s worried sick over her significant bother being stuck in the Malfoy dungeons, and Weasley R. by getting him out of said dungeons. He knows his own worth, thus he shall not let Potter’s one-sided grudge affect his professionalism.
“Grammedion,” Draco greets as he searches for the crate of pre-made Wolfsbane. He’ll get the specific ingredients in bulk later for the stockroom in Grimmauld’s.
Draco has a few questions, but from the way she ends with a close-mouthed smile, he reckons any at all would be regarded as idiotic. Well, at least she told him something.
“Where’s your wand?” Draco asks. He has to commend Grammedion for perfecting the poker face essential for any spy worth their salt, but he’s seen desperation on enough faces that the flicker of it in Grammedion’s expression gives him away.
And it’s only now that he registers the sound. Potter’s watch has gotten more aggressive, its quick beeps escalating into one long drone. Draco takes a step back, then another, barely exerting any effort at all to pull his hand away. Potter blinks slowly as if roused from a deep sleep. When he looks up, Draco is seated on his wicker chair. He takes a sip from his tea, now cold and has scarcely any flavor left.
Draco checks his Alarm charm on Grammedion, makes sure his cage's bars are sturdy enough. When he looks down, there’s a sleeping wolf in his lap, his body curled into a huge ball. Draco sighs and
With a slight sigh, he opens the file. The peculiar layouts and code words fly past him—he’d have to ask for a manual of some kind, Muggle science-y terminology has never been his best suit. However.
“I grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true,” croons a singer in a song Teddy likes these days. Harry wonders if Ron’s also heard of that song, so he could use it to snap Harry out of his delusion.
Unnerved, Draco flips the cloak’s hood over his hair, the low bun fitting snugly at his nape. The additional layer of barrier did little to calm his nerves, thus he swings the Indicator even harder. Chirps and wails echo around him, but their owners wisely remain at a distance, intimidated by the whirling blue orb and chain. Sweat covers Draco’s palms and onto his wand. He only clutches it more tightly.
“Our goals are different; the SCP Foundation wants to keep humanity safe and alive, you want knowledge and just knowledge. But I hope you find yourself in your element while working with us, finally having access to all the information you’ve been working so hard to find out.”
He doesn’t even spare Harry a glance as he walks past him. He hasn’t done so for the past months, in fact, ever since the Goblet spat his name out. Without thinking about it, Harry’s hand darts out and grabs Malfoy’s ankle.
his hair, which makes it awfully brittle and dry. Making a mental note to wash it four times when they get back to Grimmauld’s, he braids it in a loose plait and tosses it over his shoulder, mind clouded.
“It’s been so long ago,” Draco breathes. The pad of his finger grazes across the lines and wrinkles on Potter’s palm, bumpy with calluses and etched with scars. “The ‘me’ of today, in this universe, is not the ‘me’ you were interested in back in ‘99.”
Tonks and Grammedion have worked hard on the wards around this cabin. With the stream as the anchor point, one can’t Apparate near the cabin beyond that. Furthermore, one has to walk the whole way here while paths and trails rearrange themselves and converge, designed to puzzle those who don’t know the cabin very well and even drive them to madness. Thus, only Draco and his team know how to weave their way to Gramma’s Cabin.
“Wake up and get ready by 6 AM this Saturday, for we’ll come to get you at your house and go to Site-91. There are other information and protocols you need to know, and you’ll also get the equipment suited for this assignment,” Dr. Stewart adds.
“Oh, it’s,” Potter stares at his wrist. It’s a long, long stretch of time before: “I guess this is it.”
It’s just a thing Draco does when he’s bored. A past-time, or a hobby, even. If it’s past midnight and less tiring to be honest, he’d admit that it’s a coping method. But he never really feels like that as of late, as expected from a permanent resident in what is now the Dark Lord’s lair.
“A blanket fort is a blanket fort,” Draco takes the towel from Harry’s arm and puts the throw pillow Ron knitted in his lap. He hits a button on the laptop in front of them, and Harry’s favorite jazz collection plays. He blinks. He thought Draco would play his questionable atmospheric-white-noise-POV-you’re-having-tea-in-a-gothic-vampire-library playlist, the weirdo.
He lifts his head up, meeting Draco’s unimpressed gaze with a smirk. “Perhaps one last kiss will be the balm I need. Come on, just one more for closure.”
A swift turn to the ticking clock on the far wall, and Harry can tell they have but a few minutes left of today’s session.
Either way, his Prophet subscription has been canceled ages ago and he has no desire to read the drivel people call news these days. But, he reckons his haggard self in the restaurant’s ancient uniform must have made the front page, or at least the second, because why else would Harry Potter be sitting here, looking at him?
“No, you have nothing to worry about,” he concludes, still tapping. “It’s my fault. I’m not used to restaurants, so I’m a bit clumsy. Sorry for troubling you these past few days.”
!” He musters up every fiber of strength in his body into the spell. At such close distance, it hits Potter at full force, slamming him back several meters.
“Because, Potter, and this is the last time I will explain this to you,” Draco says, a familiar migraine flaring up in his temples, “I do go through here every other week, which is why I’d hate to break that routine by bleeding to death in a shrub. It’s safer to go literally anywhere at all in pairs. You
Divide from the inside. Begrudgingly, Draco is impressed. He’s even more impressed at himself for somehow pissing off enough people and creatures alike to be in the middle of a conspiracy.
Draco doesn’t have a reply to that. Potter seems to know this. His eyes close with force, his serious expression distorted with emotion. The hand not being held falls back to Draco’s side as he watches Potter’s head bow, face twisted. Contrary to his expectations—he doesn’t quite know what to expect anyway—Potter rolls Draco’s glove off and turns his hand over. Softly, a kiss is placed upon Draco’s bare palm.
Draco stays quiet. With smooth jazz crooning through the walls of bars and eateries to complete the easygoing ambiance of a mid-autumn night in Muggle London, it seems to be the least likely time of the year to find oneself bargaining for their life. But here he is.
Draco is thankful for having the… opportunity to put on his headlamp, because true to his words, the forest only gets darker. Branches close in on them, humidity clinging to his very being. If his heart stops thundering in his temple, he might let himself hear the sack thudding against Potter’s thigh.
Draco smooths a hand over Potter’s neck and gently shifts to sit against the wall. Potter follows suit and drops his head on Draco’s lap, his whole body sprawled on the floor. Keen eyes wander from point to point, eventually drifting back to Draco’s face. Draco lays a hand on his pale underbelly and marvels at how the sleek fur turns soft and luscious, marvels at the trust he never thought he'd ever be given by Potter. He sits there and wonders and wonders.
“What the fuck,” the main character, a square-faced woman with a python around her neck, has a monologue in a completely different language. “What the fuck? Is that Italian?”
“Of course I am. Merlin, that poor fucking woman. If your purpose here is to make me feel bad for Ginevra and all 300 of her relatives for once in my life, you’ve succeeded, congratulations.”
Not bothering with stepping stones, Draco stomps straight into the freezing water. The barrier between the rest of the forest and the area around Gramma’s Cabin. He catches his breath for a split second and turns around to see canine eyes glowing in the headlamp’s light. Potter’s back is bent at a severe angle, the protruding knobs of his spine outlined through the thin shirt. His ears sharpened and his brows are gone. Choppy bunches of fur cover parts of his body, bristled and mangled with dirt and leaves. Head low, his eyes follow every twitch Draco makes, low growls ringing from his thickened throat. Though he’s crouching on the earth, the sheer size of him looms over Draco.
“You’re so generous, Draco,” purrs a deep voice right at the corner of his mouth. Draco parts his lips, breathing in the hushed words. “Can’t say I won’t miss this. Your blood truly is a delicacy.”
Harry doesn’t need to imagine it; he had witnessed it himself. Draco, freshly released from a two-year sentence in Azkaban, mellowed and tentative, yet determined to reconnect with his mother’s sister and his nephew. Harry had been wary too, standing in the corner of Teddy’s bedroom, staring at the fuzz of blonde on Draco’s shorn head and his weak gait. Teddy, the darling boy with his clumsy hold on Draco’s thigh, afraid that the haggard man would trip without help, had led him to his play area.
“Good evening, welcome to La Villa,” Draco blows on the paper butterfly. In gentle loops, it flaps to the table as it increases in size, eventually becoming a proper menu. Lovegood catches it mid-air and a giggle bursts from her throat.
the part of his brain that never forgets Mother’s fashion books notes) and dark, well-fitted pants stretching over thick thighs. Sleeves rolled to the elbow, exposing dark arms with a myriad of pink-white scars. White button-up, wrinkled and stained, tied by leather harnesses crisscrossing at the chest, like the wearer has forgone changing after work and instead hurried off to deal with an urgent task. An unusual outfit for urban London, but somehow, it works.
Draco dips his quill in the ink bottle the woman—“Dr. Stewart,” she’s introduced, calm and sure—provided him and signs his name on the contract and its related documents. No hint of anything other than indifference is shown on her face, and he wonders how many others before him has she recruited.
“Do what she says,” a voice whispers in his ear. Tessa’s. “Come on, just humor her. Me and Jeremiah will finish up.”
“What,” Harry gurgles, coughs his whole damn lung out, “what’s going on? Weren’t we just in Dumbledore’s office?”
He doesn’t know whether he wants to rebel, turn his head, and meet the stranger’s gaze head-on, or just rest his forehead against the grimy bricks and find reluctant comfort in Edmund’s instructions.
Taken aback, but no less pleased, Draco fails to reign back a smile at Potter, tucking the bundle into his satchel. How thoughtful. The latter blinks, straightens, and says, “You don’t smile very often.”
think?” Draco’s yell almost drowns out the shower spray. Harry laughs, his stomach hurting for the right reason at last.
Draco’s silhouette crawls to the opening of the cloth… tent-shaped thing. Pewter grey eyes peer at him behind strands of near-platinum blonde, its icy color soothed by the orange tint of- ah, so he’s brought the bug lamp in here. Neat.
Draco gets on his feet, wincing at the static numbness in his bum and thighs and vowing to bring a sleeping bag everywhere from now on. His throat itches from the hair poking it, his neat bun having spilled out of its elastic some time as he napped. He shuffles to the door and unbolts the two heavy locks above the door handle, opening it to see the giant inky mass that is Potter in his dog form. His tongue lolls out as if he’s a common Crup and not, say, a murderous bear-sized wolf. His eyes have lost the ferocious heat from earlier, and are wide and hopeful as he pants at Draco. Of course, a good hour or two of venting the anger and bloodlust of first transformations in the wilderness probably does that to a werewolf. Makes them tired and docile and scurry back to wherever they came from.
Draco swirls his tongue against the pad of the thumb, tasting himself and gulping it down. It’s bitter and sour without Edmund’s blood to sweeten it up, but he keeps licking until all he can feel is the saltiness of skin, the clenched fistful of his jacket against his hip, and—
“You have no need to burden yourself with us anymore,” Narcissa pushes the pouch toward him. “He’s done what he’s yearned for all these years. He is free and finally at peace, and that is all I ever wanted for him. Another session is not necessary.”
“Of course,” Narcissa says, dignified in her hollowness. She merely looks at his face, her curiosity in his rapidly moving hands having faded long ago.
Draco thinks and thinks. It’s all one can do when they’re held so firmly, quite literally stuck between a rock and a hard place. A bead of sweat trickles down his temple. Edmund kisses it away with false reverence, dotting another kiss behind Draco’s ear. Draco would have jolted if he has any energy left in him.
"Yes, fairy tales. I’m not famous, but, you know, I wrote them,” Draco smiles, a bit flushed at the thought of his works. He’s not showing his face at the library next week, though his illustrator will. Her art is gorgeous and she’ll teach the kids how to draw the characters.
Velvety smooth sax flows through the air. Harry exhales, easy and content, and lets Draco tilt his head. He towels Harry’s hair, massaging unhurried circles on his scalp and varying the degree of pressure. In no time, his head lolls forward, eyes closed, chin a breath away from his well-worn shirt. A slender, pale hand cups his cheek and holds his head up and steady. Meanwhile, the hand’s owner leans out of the blanket fort to get something.
“Better answer him,” Harry murmurs as his eyes are pinned on the little wooden heart. It makes no discernable word, then stops altogether. “Yes or no?”
“There we go,” Dr. Stewart says and flips open a thick, stapled stack of paper. “You are to stay here for the duration of your first assignment. Count yourself lucky, starting work right away.”
“You see, the blood of mortals is our life force, yes, but few of them ever smell and taste like anything more than diluted shite. Blood like yours, though, that’s rare. Power like yours. That raw, untapped, repressed power hiding under masks and marks. Given enough time, enough resources, it can be brought forth, and you can prosper.
“Due to the frequency of me being summoned to your table, my supervisor has some questions about my performance and its inadequacy,” Draco folds his hands behind his back, staring at the tablecloth. “If you let me know what I can do, then you won’t have to keep calling for help and have your meal interrupted.”
Like before, Draco has nothing to say. What kind of answer can he give that is the balm Potter needs?
The rise and fall of Potter's chest increase in frequency. Normal people would be unconscious for ages, but he’s Harry Potter and is starting to break out of the Stunner.
Draco throws the rag on the counter. The kettle whistles, a piercing sound. “What’s your point? Are you here purely to flaunt your relationship and imply that I’m in love with Ginevra Weasley? If so, I got it. Thank you so very much, it’s been enlightening. Now get out.”
Draco lifts his eyes from his mug. Potter isn’t standing in front of him but off to the side, leaning against the door frame with crossed arms. His hair is cropped shorter than Draco’s ever seen it—what’s the term, a burr cut?—making the scar across his forehead and eye more jagged, the edges harsher. His eyes aren’t as harsh, however, their shade of moss-green reminding Draco of the life his garden is regaining. He’s definitely not dressed for the weather, what with that thin jacket and apparently unlined jeans. The hiking boots look alright, though.
Between lingering lips and the cradle of Potter’s hand, Draco feels warmer than he’s ever been. Potter shifts his face away, far enough for his other hand to close Draco’s fingers on the kiss, like he’s given Draco a treasure to keep. Cupping the back of Draco’s hand, Potter raises it to his lips once more, the spark of heat now spreading from Draco’s knuckles instead of his palm.
“Oh, of fucking course you still see me like that,” Harry can’t stop himself from snarling. “Have I ever been anything but The Fucking Boy Who Lived to you?”
After the mixture is all dried, he divides it into glass jars and fills them to the brim with the vinegar solution. He picked up this pickled daikon and carrot, or ‘đồ chua,’ as well as the daikon leave furikake recipes from an old Asian cookbook—many thanks to the city library. Putting everything into the fridge, Draco pulls out his leftover mushroom soup to heat up in a pot.
People’s hearts twinge sometimes. For Draco, he can barely remember the last time he doesn’t have these twinges. It’s pretty normal at this point.
“Well, in my professional opinion, sleeping in a blanket fort once every blue moon does wonders for one’s quality of sleep,” Draco gets up on his elbow to smirk at Harry, “we can look at other beds tomorrow, can’t we? Now hush. Rest.”
It’s not his business Potter hasn’t been in the Forbidden Forest enough to know what plants, what creatures to look out for besides centaurs and weeds. It’s not his business. It’s not his concern. It’s not-
A bright burst of light comes from behind him. Ah, the intruder is here. The Boy King turns around to face him.
His head whips up so quickly his neck strains within the collar. Knowing emerald eyes meet his gaze. “Potter,
“I wasn’t,” Potter says. “The Healers said it’s a health thing I developed after the War and I just needed to avoid strenuous activity. I didn’t think much of it, but then I read the book and realized that it usually flared up whenever you watched me.”
Draco can't help but feel reluctant admiration leak past tendrils of dread. When he risked his life to Apparate here, he was confident that without a clear scent to chase after, Potter would give up.
Littered in the sound of shattering glass is Grammedion’s alarmed shouts. When Draco climbs through the window into the cabin, the older man is cowering behind the large wooden table, shooting feeble hexes that mostly fizzle out before they can get to bounce off Potter's form. The latter crouches on his hind legs, gums exposed, incisors out. The fur on his back bristle and snarls fill the air. Potter snaps his jaw, his barks harsh and deafening with every spell that hits him. Draco creeps behind him, the Indicator’s chain sure in his hand.
“Yes,” Hermione thumps his back as she tracks Ron’s lanky form running through the crowd, “we were. Then we’re knocked out and brought here.”
The man paces and looks out the window instead of answering, the moonlight deepening his eye bags. His normally lush beard has grown unkempt, muscles replaced by tired hollows and bony wrists, the form of his skull emphasized by liver-spotted wizened skin. He’s always seemed so steady, immortal, even, that to see him so worn down is frankly disturbing.
The band that’s resting on the counter is different. Rustic gold and a fissure in the middle, the fertile earth splitting open to reveal a stream of diamonds, a sparkling river. Draco sets his mug to the side and holds the ring up close, his finger smoothing over the grooves of its texture.
“Cordium nuts? How you even found these is beyond me,” Draco lets go of his spoon to scritch Billy’s head. That familiar snout digs into his cheek like a peck, wet and cold, and he huffs out a laugh.
His wrists wriggle back and forth. Despite the fragile nature of the twine Grammedion used, it’s been tied into intricate knots, and nothing Draco’s tried can make them budge.
It only takes a few steps, a few heartbeats, to reach Potter. With Little Billy tucked on his shoulder, his hands are free to touch one of Potter’s and lift it to the space between them. Potter’s thumb is tucked into his fist, the other four fingers squeezing it anxiously. Draco sneaks his own fingers in, loosening Potter’s grip until his hand is open and relaxed. As it should always be.
But from the way the court is growing evidently agitated, from the way Potter doesn’t let them bother him one bit, from the way he waits, endlessly patient.
“No, I was, I’m,” Potter rubs his neck, his hand then falling to the table, a finger rocking against the surface, “we knew she would target you. We decided to get there early and catch her in the act.”
“Either I’m really desperate for human company and am hallucinating,” Draco blows on his tea, “or Harry Potter is actually standing in front of me.”
This line of thinking is bound to give Draco a big head, he thinks. Potter probably eats at La Villa before, and Draco’s never seen him around since he’s worked in the kitchen until recently. It’s a bit strange, though, how he only gestures for Draco’s help instead of the waiter working at his table.
“It’s getting late,” he says. The street outside is still bustling with people, bursting with sound. The person leaning against the wall opposite is lighting up a new cigarette.
“You love these gears,” Harry says, hanging his harnesses and tool belt in the closet and walking into the bathroom for a quick shower, “you love them against your ba-”
“Oh, pish posh, I hate it too! In fact, I’m doing us both a favor disposing of the entire thing altogether.”
“On the contrary, it’d seem that it’s only grown,” she continues. “That boy of mine. My boy. He had never been one to keep his emotions in check very well.”
“I think,” he starts. His neck is aching something fierce the longer he looks back, so he turns to face Edmund directly, “we need to have a talk about ending this entanglement.”
The wind rifles through Draco’s hair, under his cloak, over his leather satchel. The temperature hasn’t changed much, but he shivers, goosebumps pimpling his arms. Winter has passed, which means this is the works of Dementors.
As if on cue, the person straightens from their position against the wall. They step forward, one foot after the other, slack and loose, into the buzzing light. Draco can’t observe intricate details from this far away—has to wait until tomorrow, apparently—but he still has eyes.
His master is merciful. Everything is within the Boy King’s control as long as he keeps an eye on the intruders. He cannot keep them from coming in, but he can do unto them whatever he wishes if they break the rules. He just needs to take care of the rule breakers and heathens, the rest can freely traverse his domain. That is all he needs to worry about. His master is merciful.
“You’re getting there. When the next Full Moons come, the unsuspecting weres under your care will consume those contaminated vials. There will be distress calls from various parts of the country, and when the Order members are busy trying to sort out what’s going on and protect the public, Fenrir and his pack will strike. By then you’d discover that the Wolfsbane is contaminated, and of course, you’d hurry to make more,” Grammedion sounds as if he’s checking off a list. “Merlin, what will happen when all the other ingredients in this cabin are spoiled?”
“I was, but I knew, somewhat, that I wanted someone else,” Harry’s head lowers, slow and careful, until his forehead rests against Draco’s shoulder. “I told myself that I just liked the way it looked, had to get it in case I didn’t want the other ring anymore. But I got it a size smaller. Been carrying it in my pocket ever since.”
Harry pulls his hand from his cheek to rub his chin, eyes still a bit glazed over. “When they no longer respond to the ritual’s call.”
He doesn’t know how long his eyes have been closed, so he opens them once more. It’s like… it’s like he’s been floating on thick water and is only recently dragged into shore. Rubbing the creak out of his neck, Draco squints.
Draco’s headlamp turns on, and it shines straight at Potter. Potter looks up, eyes flashing in the light, his hands cupping around something that writhes without rest, jerking his arms around. His fists clench. Then, it is still.
Draco’s back straightens, and he moves his wand this way and that, orchestrating a cacophony of tomes and devices to levitate from the heavy bookshelves to the duffle bag he brought along.
True to his words, Draco translates every dialogue and mimics the characters’ voices with zeal, contradicting his stoic expression and somber, interlaced hands, looking like a cranky judge having to deal with reckless teenagers on their anti-authority phase. Harry can tell that he doesn’t understand a thing, and soon enough he’s woven a story about how the thriller-mystery they’re watching is actually a vicious custody battle over a duck. For each of Harry’s occasional snicker at the absurdity Draco has thought up is a playful kick at his ribs.
Draco’s heart throbs and throbs. Large hands circle his waist, bunching up the back of his sweater and pressing him close, chest to chest. A blanket of pure heat envelops his body as he breathes in the timeless saffron and neroli of cologne, half-lidded eyes pinned on the band he’s given.
“Yes! Just so you know, I built my own dwelling. It’s stunning, if I do say so myself. Marble floors, 5 balconies. Just added a new pool last month. Plenty of space to… christen, unlike your studio apartment.”
With a slight bow, Draco goes to focus on his own tables. He’s not called back again, but for the next few months, that table has unofficially become Potter’s domain.
Draco’s gaze flickers from one green eye to the other, then finishes the last bit of his soup. Wiping his mouth with a cotton napkin, Draco leans against his chair. He cradles his mug with his right hand while Little Billy plays with his left.
“Merlin and Morgana, did you take a bath in a pigsty?” He follows the question with a soft Cleaning charm
“Are you—um,” he says to Hermione, his accent weighing on each pronunciation and dragging it down, “I’m sorry.”
“I don’t know,” he replies, the unnatural chill on the back of his bare neck too visceral a feeling.
“Jesus-fuck, we’re not having this conversation again,” it’s the fifth time they’re having this conversation again, all initiated by Potter. “Look, you were a spy and what-not before openly defecting. Aren’t you good at, I don’t know, sneaking around? You go through here every other week.”
“The War is over here and this village is so obscure, it probably doesn’t even show up on a map. And let’s say somebody wants to find me. Would they even consider the notion that Draco Malfoy’s doppelganger is a children’s book author named Castor Lambert who writes under the pseudonym ‘Robert BoBee’ and—and talks to ‘flying squirrels’?”
Somebody downs a shot in the movie. Harry doesn’t quite register it. “I don’t think I’ve ever been in a proper one either until now. Didn’t have enough space in the cupboard. Plus, the hanging around the beds at Hogwarts felt pretty cozy by themselves.”
“I don’t know,” Draco lightly bounces Little Billy into the air. He floats down like a parachute, “since I’ll never try.”
scarcely bright enough to write down a sentence and cut a strip of paper away, making a square. Familiar folds and creases give way easily beneath his calloused fingers in the dark. Feeling the precise pleats, he bends the wings, then pulls out the tail and the neck. He runs a finger down the neck’s tip. Its head is formed.
Edmund’s reply comes in the form of his thumb pressing against the cut as if wanting to both stopper the blood and squeeze it out. Draco assists by opening his mouth, slipping the finger into moist warmth. And for some godforsaken reason, his eyes travel back to the street beyond.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Professor McGonagall gasps. Harry blinks the dynamite behind his eyelids away, “that is no way to treat a fellow classmate. A classmate you just saved, at that!”
The Boy King does not know what it means. Murderous anger subsides for a moment. No intruder has called him that before.
Potter does, patting away the dirt at his pants. He Conjures a small sack from a fallen leaf (no words, no
Draco glances back at Edmund, who is staring at his lips. His hands run tiny circles over the small of Draco’s back.
“Can’t have you tearing through your clothes and destroying your things, can we? Don’t fret, I’ve left you with your pants on, see? ” He hopes his casual tone soothes Potter’s agony somewhat.
Draco cracks a smile, then pauses. “Oh, that’s not a joke? Huh,” he purses his lips. “I assume people finally caught on.”
Draco feels something he hasn’t felt in months at the sight. He’s trained himself to suppress it the moment it showed itself and has been relatively successful until now. The sting, without warning, bursts from within his chest, calling forth a slight wince. Potter’s brows furrow.
“Alright, that’s enough. Pull yourself together, Potter,” Draco grits, “you could do it then and you can do it now. Let him go.”
“Did you clean yourself in the stream?” Draco crouches and massages the wolf’s head. The wolf replies by panting and licking Draco's healed wrists. “Hmm? How lovely of you, Potter. Dried blood is a bitch to
Jeannet McDermott drained and devoured 6 people in a single weekend. The Aurors got to her first before the news outlets. Being a shut-in and hating being perceived in general—Merlin knows how she got bitten in the first place—the only pictures ever taken of her as an adult was of her mangled body, torn by her own claws and twisted into stillness. It was a once-in-a-century scandal that paralyzed Wizarding Europe for 2 months straight.
He swivels his head to the left, the right, his headlamp shining into the thickening trees and the deepening gloom. Nothing. He looks up, noticing what hasn’t been there before. The Full Moon, half-hidden behind wisps of charcoal clouds.
There one moment, gone the next. Draco sits there and stares at the spot once occupied by a warm body amidst the chill of spring.
“You’d look like you’re swooning in my arms while I drink from your,” the tip of Edmund’s nose travels up the length of Draco’s neck, ending at where his baby hairs are matted with cold sweat, “gorgeous, delicious essence. And it’d only take a blink of an eye. Our little voyeur would never know.”
All noises cease, leaving behind the squeaking of trainers against tiles. Draco doesn’t look up even as the sounds get closer to where he stands.
“During the official trial at the House, he confessed that he spent days working through her wards and broke in. Never expected that McDermott was a fighter. She couldn’t get to her wand, but she did have a knife. She stabbed him 3 times as he was drinking from her. Their blood mixed, and Frangos ran off to lick his wounds before we found him. That was Friday.”
No frost, so the daikon also encountered little trouble. Cutting the leaves away for later, he cleans and dries the white root before peeling the skin off. A pot of vinegar, salt, and sugar boil over the stovetop, then he moves the solution to the counter to cool. Meanwhile, he juliennes the vegetables and places them in a bowl, pouring salt over the mixture. As he squeezes the salt in to absorb, something lands on his shoulder.
“Check with a Healer, then. If you can put past grudges aside, I can hand you Pansy Parkinson’s business card,” Draco grits through his teeth, pushing against the door with his entire body, his throw slipping to the ground.
His sexuality was leaked to some irrelevant gossip rag, not even making the front page. Nobody noticed, nothing changed, and it hasn’t entered his mind in what feels like forever until Potter reminds him.
“Innovative,” Potter rolls his eyes at Draco’s tone. “You made it too easy, only going three, four times a week. She just had to walk in on one of your off-days and what happened? I turned in my notice and was gone a week later. How did your team take it?”
One Narcissa Malfoy remains unimpressed, however. Strange, considering she’s the one who wrote three letters consecutively to plead for a moment of his time like he wouldn’t readily accept.
The hand holding the flashlight shivers before righting itself. Intruders always wear a uniform, for some reason, and this one is no different. And yet, this one is quite different, indeed.
“Now,” Draco’s pulse jackrabbits so quickly he can hear it. A delighted chuckle leaks into the night. “Your answer, please.”
“Indeed it is. Have a nice trip, see you never,” he waves, a jovial smile on his lips. He only holds it for a few seconds. His cheeks hurt nonetheless.
The severe edges on Potter have faded. Left behind is a handsome face, astonishing in its clarity. Taking in laugh lines and crow’s feet at the corner of lush-green eyes, Draco knows it’s the face of joy and love and being loved. That face doesn’t belong in this lonely village and this lonely cottage. Potter belongs in his own world.
Minutes pass. Harry is more than happy to wait it out for a little longer just to ensure that Narcissa’s question is answered. But if no answer comes, then he’d have to finish the ritual and make both of them wait until next week for another session. Many clients drive themselves spare when situations like this happen, and while Harry thinks Narcissa’d rather eat mud than be associated with those people, it doesn’t sit right with him that an old woman would have to wander the lonely halls of this forgotten mansion, wondering what her son might have said. But since they’ve just been sitting here, waiting…
come from?—rush to the ladder, hoisting Gabrielle up to the dock then Fleur, both girls being immediately enveloped with fluffy blankets and general fussing French noises. Malfoy climbs up the ladder himself, shivery and slow. He pauses at the top step like he’s two seconds away from taking a seat right there for the rest of the day, but instead takes a deep, heaving breath and marches on.
He lifts his gaze to the buzzing light on the ceiling, its shine cold and apathetic. To the mahogany bookcase, filled with tomes upon tomes full of ancient rites and rituals, of creatures considered ‘cryptid’ even to wizardkind. To the bookend that is shaped like a crow, which flaps its wings when its beak is tapped five times, unlocking the hidden safe behind the bookcase. The safe that stores all the actual research and data he’s collected, jealously and fearfully hoarded.
Draco pushes his wrists against the twine until it falls off, stumbling onto his feet and rubbing his wrists in sheer amazement. Even with the obvious displays of savagery, somehow, Potter has taken care not to let his saliva touch the bloody welts on Draco's skin.
“Don’t call me that,” Draco gathers enough of his declining wit to argue. “Sounds like you’re calling a dog.”
Listening to Grammedion's raspy voice, Draco remembers a sink oozing with bad decisions. Red weeping from paper-thin skin, Myrtle’s screams and Severus’s salve, not knowing if he would die from blood loss or the water down his throat. Wonder Boy fleeing, leaving him there. And through the suffocation of betrayal, Draco imagines that in another world, he’d make Grammedion a pot of tea and sit by him through the night.
“For making you have to,” Viktor clears his throat, frowning as if to gather his thoughts, “have to go down the Lake. You were in danger because of my, my feelings, and I’m sorry.”
Draco palms the brooch of his cloak. The intricate pattern of a serpent spiraling around a drop of ruby curves up into a glossy orb as he twists it, emitting a ‘click’. Gripping the silver chain connected from the brooch to the other side of the cloak, he loops it tight around his index and middle fingers, sweeping his arm in a downward arc. The chain lengthens from his still-tied cloak, the orb swinging free. Holding his arm straight in front of him, Draco observes its movement. Now the size of a fist, it dangles from the chain to his midthigh, fluttering back and forth.
“When Ginny saw you on the street during our date and extended her hand toward you, you shook it. But your heart ached.
“Fool,” Draco says. A rumble reverberates throughout the wolf’s body and into the walls. “Unicorn hair core is loyal only to its owner and their goal,” Draco tilts his head. “What do you think
He can pinpoint the moment when Potter hears the beeping. He doesn’t turn it off, doesn’t even check it. Just looks at Draco.
After an uncomfortable pause, clearing his throat, he picks up the near-forgotten package from the carpet. His hand feels around the outline of the object within, rectangular and heavy. Glancing at Draco, he says hoarsely. “I know why you bought this book.”
Ever since the day that ridiculous notion entered his head, he has been haunted by visions. They feel like memories, but the Boy King has no history. No before's and after's, only his kingdom and his subjects. And yet, they come anyway like rats in the night. One, a levitating feather. Two, a cloak nowhere to be seen. Three, pure green. Four, five, six, seven, so on and so forth. The eleventh and twenty-fifth contain a freckled face and a mane of curls respectively. They keep appearing in his head, in bits and hints when he opens his eyes and roams his land, in dreams and nightmares when dawn comes and he sleeps. They persist even after he remembers the word ‘friends.’
“Your wand is faulty, Mr. Malfoy,” Grammedion says, his voice strained, grappling for control. “It can hardly cast more than two hexes, let alone hold a protective ward. One must wonder how you’re able to get anything done.”
The vase on the coffee table is filled with blooms, pinks and whites galore, handpicked by Harry himself just last week. It was the first vase Draco’s blown for him, stained using cheap acrylic paint and glue. It was clumsily done and it shows, but it’s beautiful.
The sound of movement stops. “Oh,” Grammedion says, “The Full Moon? A bit early this month, is it not?”
Harry hums. Good question. Even better if there’s a reply. But, well, even after two repeats of the question, the planchette only lies there.
So Harry discusses. In better words, he talks and talks with no answer. What Hermione made him promise to say—even sat down and wrote a speech for him to remember—swirls in his head, syllables that don’t make noise, phrases that don’t make sense.
Potter hops atop of him, dodging his kicking legs and flailing arms. He'd take out the Indicator, but it can only be activated when he's standing and able to swing it out, and now he's never getting a chance to fix that feature. That fear pierces him even deeper when Potter catches Draco's hands between his teeth. His big, sharp teeth. Draco freezes, his heart battering its way throughout his body.
A ringed finger runs down the lists of appetizers and main courses, its owner humming to herself. Leaving her to it, Draco turns to leave.
Last month’s Full Moon was Fenrir’s worst attack yet. He and his pack of rabid followers were ordered to venture into Muggle villages and ravage whatever they could get their hands on. Thankfully, the Order had known about this weeks before and worked tirelessly to keep the Muggles safe and unaware in their own homes. However, as the Order has grown in members, Fenrir’s pack has also grown in size, and they did a number on the villages’ infrastructure and resources. It was a difficult few days for the Order to both contain the attack and spin a story that a hurricane had passed by.
“Have you worked with wizards before, Dr. Stewart?” Draco asks as he starts packing the valuables at his work desk into his briefcase. Dr. Steward has come to the Ministry by Floo, and though she seemed a bit disconcerted after stepping out of the Ministry Public Floo #13, she didn’t hesitate to follow him to his office. Thus, seeing her reaction to a simple Vanishing spell has certainly been a bit strange.
“If Mrs. Malfoy had just waited for this announcement, she wouldn’t be in her… predicament,” he says, his ‘but what can I do?’ attitude spurring the courtroom to snickers. Draco asks himself, for a brief, horrid moment, if Fiendfyre can be called forth without a wand.
“Thanks for helping me out that time,” Potter finally says. Draco doesn’t know what he wants him to say. That night was fucking hell on earth, he could barely remember it with how hard he blocks it out of his head. So what if he didn’t turn Potter in? What does it matter?
” now he has two wands in one hand, an ankle in another. Malfoy seems to go through every stage of grief at once, with the last stage manifesting itself as being too consumed by exhaustion and disgust to do much else but glare at Harry.
Scoffing, Draco turns and stalks into the kitchen. Walking past the boiling kettle, he throws a cabinet door open and grabs a mug, his hand trembling.
Draco held his own, for he knew enough about the pack to pinpoint where their weaknesses were. Casualties were low due to him and his team of Potioneers’s restless brewing, and Hermione connecting with the elusive Lavender Brown to design three of the most vicious curses Draco’s seen yet. In spite of that, the Order didn’t return from this battle unscathed. Potter, ever the hero with his savior complex, was in the front lines, facing off Fenrir himself. He later dismissed Healer Yamamoto’s desperate attempts to patch him up, insisting that he can take care of himself, telling her to “stop standing around and do your job, look at how many patients you have.” Tense with anxiety, Healer Yamamoto has lost the words to explain how important it was for Harry Potter to be in tip-top shape. She huffed and left him alone.
Draco runs and runs and runs. And soon enough, leaves crunch and rodents scurry from a second pair of feet, quickly gaining speed.
Draco watches him through half-lidded eyes, body numb, his head still pounding. Perhaps it’s the pain that makes his brain-to-mouth filter disappear.
He doesn’t know everything, but he knows enough. He knows enough to be aware that the lore Pansy snorted at when he first mentioned them, the creatures Mother dismissed as another of her bored rich son’s new obsessions, are the same ones Unspeakable Granger narrowed her eyes at when she walked past his table in the canteen and caught a glimpse of his notes. He had a feeling then that he shouldn’t even make any indication that he was interested in these things, which was proven to be correct when Ministry personnel started loitering outside his office more after that day.
“You’re an,” Potter grips the handle of his chair, leaning away, “you’re lying. An author? Oh, shit, how do you even—the paperwork—identification—”
“Fort, fort,” the boy had screamed in Draco’s ear, but he hadn’t flinched. He had nodded and gone along with Teddy’s babbled directions, then sat back on his heels and fixed a wide-eyed stare at the monstrosity Teddy had called a fort (his designing skills were, unsurprisingly, underdeveloped at the mere age of two).
“Is your dining experience subpar, sir?” Draco asks before Potter opens his mouth. “Is there any major flaw you think should be fixed in order to improve your time here?”
He whirls around and is instantly gratified with the way Potter stiffens up. “So. You’re stuck with me, we’re stuck with each other,” he jabs a finger at Potter’s chest, “now be the adult you are and deal with it.”
“I’d rather the, um, the studio apartment. It does have its charms. Checkered bathroom tiles, and, hmm, a working oven. I might paint the fireplace next week, who knows?”
Potter comes in any time from six to eight PM every other day, avoiding rush hour and choosing the table with the best vantage point in La Villa (near the entrance, back against the wall, easy view of the entire restaurant and out the windows). He rarely ever summons Tessa and only sips on wine when Draco cleans the tables. The hype has died down about his patronage and Draco’s existence, Ms. Remington has stopped running her mouth, so generally, it’s been peaceful.
When he moved to the fringes of this mountainside village, the villagers warned him of ‘pygmy demons’ and to keep his windows closed. Said they’d steal his food and trash his home before disappearing into the darkness. As it turns out, these so-called demons are simply a colony of sugar gliders that can turn invisible, save for their yellow-red eyes. He’s used to them, though. As long as he feeds them fruit and doesn’t chase them out, they don’t wreck his cottage with mid-air wrestling.
Light, clean air, silence, and Merlin knows what else, are lacking in abundance in the Malfoy Manor these days. However, with owl posts too easily intercepted and words too eagerly etched on skin rather than blank pages, paper is readily available. Draco has a lot of free time, being ‘Lucius’s worthless son’ and all. Thus, he writes.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers, allowing himself a moment to touch Potter’s cheek. He stares at Draco, pupils mere pinpricks, mouth agape. The veins on his forehead strain and sweat dot his skin. Draco slides a hand under Potter’s shirt collar and presses on the heated, swollen outline of the bite, “but you were infected after Fenrir’s attack last month. I have to do this.”
They continue to watch the movie in silence, whites and blues and purples flooding his sight until Draco yawns and Harry blinks his eyes shut for far too long.
“Harry, Harry, you’re okay? Does anything hurt? You passed out right on the top step,” Hermione’s voice shakes. Her wet hand lays on top of his stomach, trembling as the chill of his drenched clothes chases away any warmth she’s regained in her body.
Pushing off his hind legs, Potter vaults himself over the table. A weak cry ghosts past Grammedion’s lips, as if he’s tired, so very tired, and he is slammed onto the ground. All Draco can hear as he runs to them is the sound of boots thumping the floor, limbs thrashing and fists punching, screams wrenched from wheezing lungs pulsating in Draco’s ears. Drool drips from a gaping, hungry maw. Razor-sharp teeth sink into leather, into cloth, meeting flesh. Red splatters on the floor, on the black fur, on the table legs, on Draco’s cloak, crimson seeping into wool.
“When I announced my engagement to her on the Battle of Hogwarts’s 10th Anniversary, you were clapping along with everyone else. But your heart ached.”
“What do you,” Draco murmurs, sour notes of alcohol floating back into his nose, “what do you propose I do then? Just stand here and wait for them to get lost?”
Potter seems to be confused as to why he’s being restrained and wrings Grammedion’s arm even harder as an answer. Defeated groans resound from the floor.
“Your lack of critical thinking for a grown man astounds me, truly. Gramma’s Cabin? Grammedion? Ringing any bells?” Potter starts to shake his head but stops. Recognition dawns on his face. “There we go. It’d be horrific if you forget the spy who has saved our arses time and time again. Yes, we’re on our way to his safe house, Gramma’s Cabin, for information. And precisely, my team and I stocked up on all the necessary potions, except Wolfsbane.”
I don’t believe it,” Draco mumbles, unable to do anything else but that. He hates how Potter’s palm on his cheek both warms and chills his bones, “I don’t believe it… shit, I don’t even have Wolfsbane,
“Of course we can. Baby, we don’t know anyone who’s good at computer stuff and can deal with the viruses.”
He thinks of Mother, of Aunt Andy, of little Teddy, of Pansy, of Blaise. The vision of them killed, maimed, snapped from existence because he didn’t do anything to help makes his gut twist, his throat parched. He’d kill himself from the guilt, a well-casted
Draco peers up as he rises, hands around the package. Potter has his maddening Invisibility Cloak slung over his arm, his roguish charm heightened by a perfectly fitted three-piece suit. A tiny posy is pinned on his left lapel, muted green hellebores with a few sprigs of privet berries. He’s dressed like a man in love.
Draco dashes over, hands clammy. The cart there's wheels squeak on the wooden floor, and he grabs a handful of vials.
“Dark Magic leaves a mark on both the wizard and their victim, doesn’t it? No need for a book to tell us that,” Potter says, the harsh afternoon glow of him gentled by the soft lamplight in Draco’s hallway. “In certain cases, it even leaves a link. A connection.”
he thinks, and again when it settles at the base of his ring finger with ease, as if it belongs there and never left.
The shift is unpleasant, but he likes this form. His power is challenged less often when he is no longer a child.
"I guess I shouldn’t be too hard on you, Potter, my apologies,” he sips his tea, smoky cardamom making his nose tingle. “I didn’t like her, still don’t,” he raises the hand Billy is hanging on, tapping his temple with his index finger, “but I can say that she’s a different type of intellectual. Because you can’t think like her, from the start, you’ve already lost. I was the perfect candidate, she wouldn’t give up on me just because she had Aurors out her door.”
“The oddity in the mundane, Dr. Malfoy,” Dr. Stewart leans forward, a knowing look on her face. Draco’s legs feel like wooden trunks, sunken into the ground. “Get used to it, and get focused. Because if left unchecked, Harry Potter might very well get powerful enough to become a reality bender.”
“The point is,” Potter says, lifting the kettle off the burner to pour it into Draco’s mug, placing his tea bag in, “unless the article about you being gay was wrong, Ginny isn’t the one you’re in love with.”
Harry had kissed his forehead and hugged him close. His heart had always been there for Draco to take.
There’s an analogy to be made about shackles and penance and father’s sins. Draco wouldn’t know. He’s not in the right state of mind to ponder it.
“A blanket fort, lover,” Draco says, his gaze tender. Harry’s fingertips tingle with every touch of cotton, linen, silk, as he gets situated. It’s been years and years and years and years, and Harry can never get used to, can never take for granted, the weight of his husband’s undivided attention.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Grammedion says, his deft hands opening heavy bags and filling jars with new, exotic materials.
Draco closes the window and slides under the cover. Staring up at the swirling darkness of his canopy, he hopes the crane gets to, say, the nearby valley before descending.
Death is unbiased. It doesn't discriminate, only takes and takes. If he doesn’t grow to be unbiased himself, how can Harry even dare to approach its throne, let alone work with it?
Potter's left forearm shifts a bit, jostling the jacket sleeve and capturing Draco’s eyes. This can’t be right. Draco glances at Potter’s right arm and the visibly holstered wand that he always carries with him. Back to his left arm, where the head of another wand is but a hint in the shadow. Draco would’ve thought so as well, would’ve thought Potter is being cautious, if not for the instant familiarity striking him like an elbow to the throat.
“Yeah, you fit the type she targeted, no offense,” Potter crosses his ankle over his other knee, palming his chin, “Kinda lost, no aspirations. Tired, don’t seem fulfilled, basically wanting a better future. Those are the people who’d accept a ticket to a different life.”
“Yes,” he says, “but since I have to get a great number of ingredients in dark locales like this,” he hopes his nonchalant wave doesn’t tremble, “it’s infinitely safer and less time-consuming if I have both my hands free to work with.”
Draco doesn’t quite know what to say. He was sure everybody thought him unhinged; even Luna seemed off around him these days instead of enthusiastically rallying after his theories like she usually would, gradually gravitating toward Granger whenever they’re in the same room.
Letting the salted daikon-carrot mixture sit for a while, Draco turns to the daikon leaves. It’s tough chewing on greens all year with just salt and pepper. Thus, once a month, he hitches a ride on the old woodworker couple’s truck to the city, lugging home jugs of imported soy sauce, mirin, et cetera. After washing and chopping the leaves, he throws them into a pan and whips up a batch of furikake to last the week. Breathing in the nutty aroma of sesame oil, Draco goes to wash the salt from the daikon-carrot mixture.
They stand there for a few moments more nonetheless, clutching each other. Then Draco sees it. Sees him.
“My colleagues have—some of them have Muggleborn and Halfblood relatives—but not me personally,” she answers. “My apologies, I still need to get used to seeing magic in… this way. Ironically, we have more luck with magic users from other dimensions than from our own, especially with what happened in recent history.”
There’s a stream up ahead, and Draco’s mouth dries. At his back, snarls accompany the stench of blood. Gramma’s Cabin is only sixteen minutes away, ten if he keeps at this speed. Potter is faster.
After years of doing it, he can scarcely tolerate one Portkey trip from wherever he’s assigned to back to the main headquarter before getting uncontrollable shivers. Another 30 minutes on the metro, then a 10-minute walk home. In addition, Harry has to sleep for at least 8 hours every night to replenish his energy. Morning comes, he wakes up, Apparates to the headquarter, and the cycle continues.
He grits his teeth, drawing forth what’s left of his stamina and focus. Not enough strength. Humming bog daisies sway upward from the bottom of the stream and hug his ankles, ecstatic at the presence of a human. Feeling liquid energy coursing up from them into his body, Draco sends a silent apology to the beings guarding this stream.
“Grammedion,” Draco sighs, ignoring the little tidbit about Potter which probably never happened, “you never needed redeeming. You were with us from the start. What changed?”
The pain shoots from his chest to the rest of his body, and for several seconds, his lungs wouldn’t work. He whips his head away from Potter, who groans and sags against the wall.
“If the Dark Lord knew how soup and a blanket could shock you this easily, you wouldn’t have made it past five years old,” Draco says when Potter jumps at the sight of him.
They actually don’t take anything from the safe house if they can help it. The ingredients and potions stored there are expensive to replace, thus they are used exclusively for dire situations, like the new batch of weres. Plus, Voldemort has tightened security these days. Frequent trips to Draco's fellow spy’s cabin are the only way to access Death Eater information anymore without the riskiness of owling and Flooing, or the hassle of one-way Protean charms.
He realizes it now. Ever since the day Edmund’s gaze lingered a second too long, it was over. There is no one left to remember him, and if he ‘makes it easy’ for himself and says no, nothing will change. Sooner or later, he’d die without a purpose, alone.
. “I think having to choose between that and rotting in a back alley is at least a little bit pressuring.”
“Why are you looking at me like that? Keep eating,” Draco settles amid the pillows, long hair settled on his satin-clad chest, white against emerald. Harry sneers at him - an unfortunate habit he’s gotten from Draco - and turns to watch the movie.
When the footsteps nearly reach the top of the staircase, the Boy King unfolds himself from his seat. He looks at his small hands and short legs. He knows he looks like a child, an infant, even, in the standards of his world. He is not called the Boy King for nothing.
The moment he sits back down, Draco’s big toe pokes at his spine. Getting the memo, Harry grins and reclines on the pillows. His left side is flushed against Draco’s right, the kinks in his neck eased off from the angle. They, as per usual, gradually get closer to one another, and at some point, Draco lays his head on Harry’s chest and ear on his beating heart. It’s calming to him, Draco had said when Harry asked, on the third night of their honeymoon. With the war long behind them, there was nothing to fear. Only the constellations existed as their witnesses.
When the public has stopped its rage against war criminals and deflated to resignation, preferring to just ignore and go on with their day, and when Ms. Remington deems it sensible then to give him more work, and by more work, she means actually serving customers.
Draco takes off his gold-rimmed glasses (so sweet and soft Harry can barely feel it), cleans them, and puts them on a chair. Through half-lidded eyes, Harry watches him cover them both with a quilt and return to Harry’s chest, curling up like a cat. Draco’s arm is around his midriff, peach and cedar pervading his senses anew, and Harry forgets whatever he was going to say.
Draco’s eyes haven’t left Harry’s face throughout the explanation, and he doesn’t open his mouth once. Harry wishes he’d say something, do something other than bouncing his heel ever so often.
“Yes,” Narcissa stirs her tea absentmindedly. She stares at him. “May I have a question for him in return?”
His husband’s level of theatrics is directly proportional to how slow Harry is at doing what he says, so he nods, fondness overflowing, and obeys.
His hands shift against the grimy bricks, one seeking familiarity and warmth as it grips his other wrist, grounding him
Whatever Hermione’s about to say is lost on Harry, because there’s a gasp from McGonagall again. He whips his head to the Black Lake and sees them at the same time the rest of the audience does. Everybody clamors to the edge of the docks, screams and cheers of all kinds of languages filling the air. Three blonde heads, darkened by the water, steadily swimming to shore. Scratch that; a weary little girl is held up by two teenagers on both sides, each panting for air but tense with bull-headed stubbornness.
Once his thumbprint has been collected, the last step of the process, he Vanishes the ink on his finger. Dr. Stewart raises a brow but says nothing more. She stands up, holding out a hand.
Draco lifts a brow. Grammedion walks to where Draco was standing earlier and plucks his wand off the ground. He tosses it from side to side, getting used to its weight. Then he returns to his place by the window, tapping Draco’s wand against the glass.
It had been the first time he had looked at Harry in the eye for years. In seconds, it was 6th Year all over again, with him watching Draco pushing his food around with a fork from across the room, unable to look away. Obsession, a voice not unlike Hermione’s helpfully defined, had slithered up and under his skin. It had remained there for years, stubborn and ardent, an emotion he had tried to leave behind time and time again. He’d never succeeded.
in tow. Ropes appear out of thin air and coil up his body, binding every centimeter except the head. Draco loops his satchel across his body, wand and Indicator at the ready, and runs.
“‘Depends on the situation,’ he says,” Draco mocks, getting a carton of milk from the fridge to save his bitter, bitter tea. Potter doesn’t reply. Stirring the milk in, Draco lets out a heavy sigh.
“Oh, but you’re no fun,” Edmund says. “Being poetic has its merits, I think. Makes life interesting.”
He throws on a sweater, and a throw, too, for good measure. Ambling to the door, he checks the mail slot before peeking through the peephole. Nobody but a package is outside. Draco hums and unlocks his door, crouching down the moment it opens. What feels like soft satin brushes against his cheek, cool and smooth. With a flash, a pair of shiny dress shoes appear before him.
It’s alright. Draco tucks his wand in his satchel, which has miraculously stayed on him through the entire ordeal. He’s okay with not understanding why Potter treats him as nothing more than an acquaintance in human form. He’s okay with the knowledge that Potter is only kind to him during Full Moons.
“Don’t forget that when a being has lived for as long as I have, has accumulated this much power, nine times out of ten, he knows what he’s saying. I’m powerful enough to catch the scent of every mortal walking by, even know if they’re actually mortals or not. Our little voyeur? He’s still here. He’s watching. He’s waiting for you, doll.”
“Oh, yes. Cold weather is hell on my nerves, can't let my extremities be exposed to the elements. Can’t drink coffee, either,” Draco pats his mug. “Caffeine-free. Very good brand, this, phenomenal taste. I can recommend it to you,” he tilts his head, “though I’m not sure if they have it there.”
“You might want to think it through a little faster, doll,” the large hand pinning Draco’s wrists against the brick wall clenches around them, then drifts down his chest. Lays flat on his quivering stomach, a persistent pressure against Draco’s thrifted bomber jacket. “We have an audience.”
Potter stays quiet. His jacket moves a bit with the gentle wind, and if he still has that mane of hair, it would fall into his eyes, unprotected without glasses. Draco’s eyes widen. Potter isn’t wearing his round glasses. He’s not wearing glasses, period. When did he stop? Has it really been that long?
“What the-” he says and immediately takes a step back, “Is that a werewolf? What the hell is a werewolf doing within the boundaries?”
He’d have to leave the wizarding world behind. Of course, it doesn’t have to be that drastic. However, if he doesn’t want his frequent disappearances to catch the Ministry’s attention, then it’s best to withdraw into the Muggle world altogether, as far from its control as possible. Mother has Aunt Andy, Teddy, and friends from her book club now, she’ll be fine with him visiting only a few days each year.
As if it can understand English, the sugar glider noses at Draco’s apron strap for a second before clambering down his arm, sailing away before it reaches the bowl. Unlike Muggle gliders, this one’s patagia stretch into a perfect circle as it lands straight into the fruit bowl Draco’s laid out. Eyeing the way it shamelessly gathers as many berries and grapes as its tiny body can handle, he knows its brethren are soon to arrive. The kitchen window is open for this purpose, after all.
“Big plans, big plans,” Edmund nods solemnly. “However, you will need to pay a visit at least twice a month for resources and news within the community. There are tons; we even have a matchmaking service so you wouldn’t have to explain yourself to some bumbling mortal and worry about lifespans. Isn’t that so very neat? But, you already have me.”
“It’s getting late,” Edmund whispers against his forehead, his lips a touch away from kissing his fringe.
Potter sniffs. “Yeah, yeah, I know. Hermione’s still telling me how stupid I was for volunteering,” he says. “I just, I thought it’d be good to check on you as well. It’s been years. Two birds, one stone.”
“He hated Lucius, you see,” she explains, “and held no love for his peers. They’ve either abandoned him or died, and he couldn’t find it in himself to dwell in their memories.”
“Lover,” Draco tosses a napkin at Harry’s crossed legs, “what is watching movies online without the occasional bout of piracy?”
Edmund lets a casual grin grace his face, all jokes. Draco curls his lips. It’s a mystery for the ages as to how he’s ever found this man charismatic.
