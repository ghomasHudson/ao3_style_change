Before he could kiss me again, I rolled out from under him and sat up on the edge of his bed. I kept my back to him as I spoke. “That Mark signifies what I am Harry; a traitor to the wizarding world. I took the easy way out, becoming one of his minions without a thought to myself. Without a thought to the pain I would cause others."
I wasn't aware of how long we sat there until Ron and Theo came up to us after getting off the ride. “Is everything okay?" Theo asked.
I groaned, dropping my head back against the sofa. “Fine. I want a banana cake with chocolate frosting and strawberry filling," I said raising my head to look at her, waiting for her to tell me I couldn't have that kind of cake.
," said my voice from behind me. I turned around, my shirt falling to the floor. My reflection was standing there, arms folded across his chest. It wasn't really my reflection now; the spell had captured my image, so now I was officially talking to myself. The me in the mirror was still wearing his shirt, but he could move and talk; almost like talking to a portrait of myself.
“Whoa. And you didn't get in trouble with the Ministry for that?"
“Well, you must be in that rare category where you are naturally fertile. Your body is equipped for having children, and your magic is strong enough that you don't need pregnancy potions. Congratulations by the way," Dean said.
“Because people that want to end a relationship, don't cause themselves harm when the relationship is over." He snapped at me. I paused and raised my head to look at him.
“I warned you," he said, before he turned around and walked out the door, closing it behind him.
“We need to speak with Harry. Carlos Madole said he was trying to get a job here," Hermione said, placing her hands on the desktop.
Harry immediately halted the movement of his hips, holding me completely still against him. He leaned forward and placed a gentle kiss on my lips. He slid his hands back to my arse cheeks, and with my legs still wrapped around his waist, Harry carried me to his bed and gently laid me down and then he came down so that he was laying on me.
“Actually, yes, that counts as creature blood, simply because James Potter could become an animal. Now, from what I could determine, Harry is suffering from a very rare form of magic. It's called Guilt Magic."
Kingsley sighed and raised his head to look at us. “I'm gonna have to bring him back here and send another Auror in his place. The concussion was worse than he realized. It's days like this that I wish you had become an Auror, Harry. You could've handled something like that," he said.
“Are you ready to order, dearies?" Asked a voice. All three of us glanced up at the waitress who stood behind the chair next to Ron, popping bubbles with the wad of gum she was chewing.
He met my gaze, his pupils blown wide with lust. “I'm only just getting started," he whispered to me. He rose above me and kissed me. We kissed for several moments before Harry snapped his fingers and summoned the bottle of lubricant. He caught it in his hand and squirted a large dollop on his fingers. He waved his hand and my legs became unbound; unfortunately for me, my arms were still fastened to the headboard. He pushed my legs open. “Bend your knees," he said, rubbing the lube around his fingers
“Well, what I saw in his head as I was healing him, his magic played it out that you cut him. The way he saw it, you were showing him how much he had hurt you by doing the same to him."

He held up my cigarette pack, still laughing his head off. He took a few deep breaths to gain control of himself. “Well, want to know what made me laugh? You and I smoke the exact same brand," he laughed.
“He got the bruise, because I slapped him as hard as I could."
I fought back a growl and turned towards the men's room. “Where are you going?" Pansy asked.
“No Dray. Listen to the lyrics of my song. Better yet," he flicked his wand and a piece of parchment appeared and on it were the words to his song. “Read them. Then you should understand how I feel."
“Why would you want a portkey to Azkaban, Harry? Everyone imprisoned there hates you."
The memory faded away, but reformed quickly. We were now in the Manor library.
She nodded, before reaching under the bar. She set a glass of ice in front of me. Her hand picked up the soda gun, pressing the button to fill the glass with water. I thanked her before turning my attention to the one that was pouring drinks. She seemed agitated and kept glancing down at her watch.
He nodded. “Oh, Harry," I said. I couldn't stop myself from leaning forward and pressing my lips against his cheek. We both froze at the contact, before I came to my senses and pulled away. My cheeks were burning as I turned my attention to picking at a lose thread on the bottom of my shirt. We sat there for several minutes in uncomfortable silence, until Harry started to chuckle.
Harry recoiled away from me as if I had slapped him. It took me a moment to realize what I had said and regret washed through me. “Harry, I didn't..."
“I'll take some toast, yogurt and fruit. I'm not very hungry this morning," I said to him. He bowed to me, then disappeared from sight with a pop.
“Draco, want to help me?"
He slowly raised his head to look at me. “What happened to me? I should be covered in blood right now. I should have marks like yours," he said. He raised his hand and gently rubbed his chest.
“Did you get it from Marcus?" I asked Charlie.
“Okay. Now is this..." she started to ask, but I cut her off. “Just tell Mr. Hannigan to put it on my tab. Put Mr. Potter's bill on my tab as well."
I closed my eyes, picturing the streets of Diagon Alley. I twisted on the spot and disapparated with a small pop.
Suddenly, my phone buzzed slightly in my pocket. I pulled it out. “Ron says Hermione's forgotten which direction she's supposed to be going," I said, reading the message Ron had sent.
“That was amazing, even if I never did that before," I whispered to him. I slowly pulled myself out of him and rolled over to lay next to him.
The choking sound coming from Rose's tiny throat increased slightly. Her little mouth opened. She gagged a moment, then out came what had been blocking her airway. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw...a ring fall to the floor from Rose's tiny mouth. Draco turned Rose onto her back and cradled her against his chest. Her cries quieted down. I summoned her bottle from the kitchen and handed it to him. He took it from me and when he offered it to Rose, her little mouth latched on to it easily. It looked so natural for him to hold her. Draco's own breathing was slightly ragged.
“Are you kidding me?! Peter, you can't expect me to run the bar and train Alexis at the same time by myself. Thursdays are our busiest days and I can't do this alone!" Krista practically yelled.
“You can ask me anything, Draco. I won't lie," Harry said.
I let out a heavy sigh. “Do you have any idea where he could have gone?"
I turned around to face him. “You would be okay with me leaving?" I asked.
“How fast can you arrange a portkey to Azkaban?"
“I've been sick the past five days," I answered, clutching the bucket a little tighter to my stomach.
“Let's start with an order of chili queso dip, no pico," Harry said. Kyle walked away to place our order.
“It's true Percy. I'm gay," I said. He turned to look at me.
He peaked at me over the top of his book. “Now it won't be a surprise if I tell you about it," he said. He disappeared behind his book again. I waited a moment before leaning over him. He glanced at me briefly and smirked, before turning back to his book.
She came to a halt next to me and flipped her dark curls over her shoulder. “It's good exercise to walk," she said. Her eyes glanced at me briefly, before shifting to Harry. “Well, hey there stranger. Long time no see."
“You okay luv?" Charlie asked. I looked up from my pancakes, the breakfast that I wasn't really eating. I shrugged, then looked back down. It had been three days since the birthday party, and I still hadn't heard anything from Ron. Charlie sighed.
“Don't you ever do that again!!" I yelled. I could already feel my lips swelling. I grabbed the stuff from the bed and made my way past Draco. I ran down the hall and dumped my things unceremoniously into an empty box. Draco grabbed the two boxes of books and stacked them into the fireplace. He quickly grabbed the box of stuff I had brought out of the bedroom.
------------
Draco decides to visit Lucius in Azkaban. Harry goes with him to make sure Draco doesn't get hurt.
The chicken was just about done, so with a flick of my wand, I set the table. The salad bowls flew out from the fridge, and the two candles on the table came to life, producing a soft, romantic glow in the kitchen. The bottle of wine that was sitting in the ice bucket beside the table, rose up and poured into the two wine glasses. I turned back to the stove.
“Oh, yeah. In fact, I have a practice with them next week to see if I'm good enough to join them. Can you imagine, me a professional Quidditch player." Her face was beaming.
I kept my hand at a slow and steady pace, up and down, up and down as I licked my way back to the head of his dick. I rubbed my thumb across the head, smearing precum around it. I swallowed him deep into my throat and sucked harder. I moved my head up and down, my hand keeping pace. Harry was moaning and writhing back and forth on my bed. His hand dropped from my hair and tangled in the comforter beneath him.
“Well, why don't you floo call him?" Mother asked.
Ron noticed my hesitation. He glanced from me to the side of the bed and a frown formed on his face. The medi-witch that brought us to the room turned around and left, closing the door behind her. The Weasleys all turned to look in our direction at the sound of the door closing. Charlie's eyes met mine. We stared at each other for a moment, before Ron grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the bed.
He jerked upwards, blinking rapidly.
Draco ran his hands up my legs, sliding them over my skin until he reached my hips. He leaned forward and licked my shaft from root to tip. I moaned tossing my head back against the pillows. He wrapped his lips around the head of my dick and sucked me into his mouth. I moaned again, thrusting my hips up. One of his hands wrapped around the base of my shaft as he bobbed his head up and down. Almost at once, I felt my groin begin to tighten.
Once we were in the car, she started the engine and we were on our way. “So, who's watching Rose today while you're on your little mission to get me back together with Harry?" I asked. I knew Ron was at the Ministry.
Still continuing from Draco's point of view.
I opened my eyes and looked over at her. “Well, my friends and Harry's friends. I think it's about time we put the animosity between us to rest."
“This bag has an undetectable extension charm on the inside. We're going to a Muggle amusement park and I don't want anyone to lose their wands or cellphones, so I'm bringing this bag to put all that stuff in when we go on the rides."
“Well, well, well. Look who finally decided to grace me with his presence; my son, my
I whimpered softly when he pulled away. “Good morning, Draco," he said, his voice slightly husky.
Draco looked in the kitchen one last time, then turned to me. “Charlie, here, has a line of potions sitting on the table. These particular potions come from St. Mungo's, and they were created to treat sexually transmitted diseases."
“Most definitely," he whispered, leaning closer and letting his lips brush softly against mine.
“No, not kidding," I said, tightening my grip on Draco's hand.
He rolled his eyes and looked away. Kingsley sat forward in his chair. “Lucius, tell me more about your little incident with Patrick Jensen," he said.
I slid my glass across the table. “Try it for yourself," I said. He looked at me like I had lost my mind. “I'm not trying to poison you, Potter. Just try it."
“Alright dear. Now, you four, into the kitchen," Mrs. Weasley said, waving her hands towards the kitchen. Without a word, we all headed into the kitchen. As we entered, I finally noticed the Expanding Charm around the room. Not counting Bill's wedding, the last time the Weasley family had all gathered at the house had been when Mr. Weasley had gotten tickets to the Quidditch World Cup. Back then, we ate on tables outside in the backyard. Now, everyone could sit around the table comfortably.
“Charlie?" I questioned, turning back to him.
I sat him down on the bed, then helped him lie down against his pillows. I undid his belt and pulled it free from his trousers. A soft snore reached my ears and I glanced up at Harry's face. He had fallen asleep as soon as his head hit the pillows. I sighed, before slipping my wand from my pocket and transforming his trousers into pajama pants. I removed his glasses from his face and placed them on his nightstand.
“Yeah, I think Steve and Randy can finish up. There's not much left to do anyway." Peter said. I glanced towards Steve and Randy to see them both nodding. I turned back to Peter.
“Did he hurt you?" I asked before I could stop myself. He looked at me.
“You didn't really think that you could repair your relationship just by saying ´Sorry' did you?" Hermione asked.
“What does that have to do with anything?" I asked.
Ron turned left and walked over to where he had parked his car. The grey Chevy Impala glinted in the sunlight. I took Draco's hand and led him across the street to the lawyer's parking lot. I had parked near the back of the lot, parking in the shade of a tree. My black Lamborghini Gallardo still shined, even in the shade.
“Master Draco is ins the sunroom. Should Dempsey tells Master Draco that yous bes looking fors him?"
“It's not a hickey. One of the young female dragons lashed out with her tail because her mate was hurt. I just happened to be the one in her way," Charlie said. He grabbed the collar of his shirt and pulled it aside. There was a large bruise along his collarbone, but it didn't even touch the one on his neck. My blood boiled with the feeling he was lying to me.
I smiled. “I may dislike the idea of you moving out, but I can't fault your reasoning behind the decision. I told you yesterday that I've wanted us to be together since third year. If you think moving out is the right choice for now, I can respect that."
he pressed his mouth to the head of my dick.
“Are you saying that you used to dream about me? All nightmares I'll bet, right?"
Harry walked into my room, his eyes wide. I stepped in behind him and pushed the doors shut. For good measure, I locked them. I turned around to watch Harry explore my bedroom. I watched him walk over to the black leather sofa that sat in front of the large fireplace that dominated the right side of my room. He ran his hand over it, glancing at the fireplace.
He looked up at me. “Draco, you may think that this Mark is what made you a Death Eater. That's not true. What makes a Death Eater is your heart. You joined Voldemort in an effort to protect your family, not for power like the rest of them." He pressed his lips against it again, before rising back up over me. He leaned down.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, that's completely mental. Cheating on my brother with that slimy haired git."
“He's outside. He's been working on a new song all day."
(See the end of the chapter for
Without a word, I set the bucket aside and stood up. I quickly pulled the robes over my head, then I unbuttoned my shirt and pulled it off. I sat back down and lowered myself until I was laying on the exam bed. Dean gently touched his wand to my abdomen, then moved it in counter-clockwise motion, chanting softly in Latin. When he had made a complete circle, my abdomen glowed with a soft blue light. He did it again, and got the same result.
“Charlie! You can't do this!" Ron yelled.
I turned my head to look at her. She was smiling. “I guess I have you to thank for that Mother. I don't really think Harry and I would be together if it wasn't for you telling him about how I used to fancy him."
Draco laughed as we moved around the medi-witch and entered Narcissa's room. She was laying on a large bed, propped against the pillows. Her long blonde hair was twisted into a braid over her shoulder.
Charlie glanced at Draco for a moment, then looked down at the boxes. “Yeah, I thought it would be easier for you. There are still things around the bedroom and here in the living room that I wasn't sure you would want, so I left them." He looked back at me.
“I'm not jealous," I repeated.
He pulled it from his pocket, then swiped his thumb across it to answer the call. “Yes, dear?" He asked, after raising the phone to his ear.
Draco suddenly chuckled and stood from his chair. He crossed over to me and sat down on the edge of the bed next to his mother. He looked right into my eyes.
“Absolutely not. I think that we should establish some ground rules though. Like, we only eat in the dining room on opposite sides of the table. We only hang out together if we're hanging out with Ron, Hermione, and any other friends of yours, or mine. No hand holding and definitely no kissing right now. And you sleep in this room and I'll sleep in mine. Does that sound agreeable to you?" I asked him.
“Yeah, what are you congratulating me about?" I asked him.
“Just incompetent people that don't know how to do their jobs," she answered, raising her arms to embrace him in a hug. I hung back as he stepped up to the side of the bed, placed the flowers in a vase on the bedside table, and then bent down to give her the hug she wanted.
“Wait, who else is coming? I thought everyone else that we asked were all busy?" Hermione asked.
It felt as though my heart ripped apart as I choked back a sob. I dropped to my knees, as the tears fell. I allowed myself to fall forward, my face burying into the carpeting. I sobbed, letting out my pain.
“How could you do this to me? Does the last two months mean nothing to you? Does this morning mean nothing?" He asked, before waving his hand and summoning his clothes from the wardrobe.
“Thank you, sir. I know that this is putting you in a difficult position, but I also know that Draco will appreciate it," I said. Kingsley nodded his head before turning back to his paperwork. I closed my eyes and pulled my head from the fireplace.
Harry chuckled. “You don't have to decide right now. We've got time."
“That's because the scars on Draco's chest are long since healed, he didn't see them when they were fresh. Draco, is it safe to assume that this is the first time he's seen your wrists since it happened?"
Harry smiled at her. “Connie, can you take my boyfriend Draco inside? I need a cigarette before I get to work."
“Potter doesn't deserve you. Draco, I know you still want me."
“Come on, tell me. I promise I won't laugh."
“What's going on here?" I asked Narcissa.
“Fine, I'll sit next to Harry," I said. I slid out of the booth. They both stepped back to give me room. “Scoot over, Harry," I said. He immediately slid closer to the window. He sucked in a sharp breath and I felt another shot of pain. I quickly sat down next to him and reached across the table for my drink. I noticed that my knee was pressed against his, but neither of us seemed willing to move apart from the contact.
“I do recall clearly that I tried to talk you out of cheating on him anyway. You just couldn't resist the Malfoy charm," I said, putting a smug smile on my lips.
The four of us watched as Harry rounded the table and stood in front of my father. For the first time in my life, I saw a look of genuine fear flash across Father's face, as Harry towered over him. Harry raised his hand and slapped him hard across his face. Father's head snapped to the side with the force of Harry's blow. Father looked up at Harry, a red handprint on his cheek. Even as I watched, the handprint began to darken in color.
I sat there for a moment, then finished my drink in one swallow. I grabbed my coat that was still on the bench where I had set it when I first sat down. I headed for the door, pulling it on as I walked. I called out a goodnight to Josie, waved at Marko and made my way out the door.
“Potter! Have you lost your mind? There's no way I'm putting those on my feet," came the expected whispered hiss as I led the others away from the front counter of the bowling alley.
~~~~~
“It's only an eight year difference, Charlie. I don't care that you're older than me," I said, drinking more of my tea.
“Okay, I'll tell you. Back during the summer between second and third year, my Aunt Marge came over and stayed with us for a week. My uncle had told me that if her visit went well, and if she knew nothing about my ´abnormalities', as he called my magic, then he would sign my slip to visit Hogsmead. Things had been going well, and I only had one night left. On the last night of her visit, she began to insult me. I was fine with it, until she turned her insults to my parents. I got angry at her, things around the room started to rattle and the next thing I knew, I had blown her up like a balloon."
“Not since yesterday. He didn't come to breakfast, and I've been down here all day. Have you asked my mother?" I asked, turning back to my potion.
We stood there in silence for a moment. Suddenly, I heard the sound of running water coming from the bathroom. “Is someone here?" I asked.
He groaned, wrapping his arms around my back and pulling me up against his body. I tightened my arms around him, as I thought about the one place I could take him where we could be alone. I twisted in his embrace, and we disapparated; our mouths never braking contact.
“Shut up, Potter," I answered. There was no bite to my words, which just made him laugh harder. I couldn't help but to laugh with him.
“Hermione, can you give us a second?" I asked in a husky voice.
At the mention of his godfather, Harry turned his head away, but not before I noticed the tears in his eyes. I reached up and brushed away the tear that had slipped from his eye and down his cheek. “I'm sorry about what happened to him," I whispered.
“Please take Mister Potter to the sun room. Then I want you to leave him until he summons you to lead him back here," I said to him. I turned to Harry. “All you have to do to summon him is call his name."
“Sir, can I ask how Patrick was doing? I know you went to check on him when Linda led us to the interrogation room," Harry said.
He broke the kiss and pushed me away. I opened my eyes and looked at him. His eyes had darkened more, his cheeks were flushed. We were both breathing heavily. Without a word, he pulled up the edge of his boxers and pulled up his jeans and re-fastened them. Without looking at me, he moved over to the sink and turned the tap back on.
I took a breath and moved to the end of his table. He didn't acknowledge that I was standing there. “Hey Potter, what are you doing here? Wouldn't think someone like you would know about this place," I said in my usual sarcastic manner.
Tom pulled out his wand and did some quick calculations. “8 Galleons, 5 Sickles, and 2 Knuts," he said, reading the edge of his wand.
“What's that supposed to mean?" He asked me.
Harry groaned, then he grabbed the bottle of lube and squeezed some onto his fingers. He leaned down and kissed me as he parted my legs a bit. I felt his lubed up fingers at my entrance. He slid a finger in and my muscles contracted around him. As he moved his finger in and out, I let my hand continue to apply the lubricant over his growing dick. I gasped as he added a second finger. He moved his fingers around my hole, stretching it wider. A third finger joined in and I about screamed with pleasure.
“I think that's kinda sweet," Hermione said. I noticed that neither Draco nor I had mentioned exactly what Narcissa had said when we talked to her.
“I know Harry," he whispered back.
“Yes, you do. Your shoes are over by the desk," I said. He moved over to the desk and sat in the chair. I pulled out my wand and waved it at the bed. Instantly, the sheets and comforter were completely cleaned and pressed, the comforter rising off the floor and sliding across the bed. I turned back to Harry and found that he had his shoes on. I let my eyes travel over him once more, discovering that I had correctly chosen clothes for him.
“No, why?" I asked him tentatively.
“What kind of job did you have?" I asked, stubbing out my cigarette in the silver-lined, glass ashtray next to me.
“Oh please, it was all over the Daily Prophet. You heard Percy in there; telling me all about the things you have done like I don't already know. Anyone who's grown up in the wizarding world knows exactly who you are."
. Thick, smoky numbers flew from the end of my wand, forming in the air in front of me.
“Scared, Potter?" I couldn't resist asking. I watched him as he grinned.
Draco released my fingers and dropped his hand onto my thigh. He squeezed it, letting his fingers drift closer to my zipper. From where the waitress was standing, and based on how tall she was, I knew she could tell where Draco's hand was. He leaned forward and whispered loud enough for the waitress to hear, “Oh, I'll make it up to you after she goes to bed tonight."
“Blaise kissed me and Harry broke up with me," I said. Tears filled my eyes again and I buried my face against her shoulder.
“Well, well, well, Harry. Who knew that a Slytherin heart beat behind that Gryffindor facade?"
“Well, I'll leave you two alone. Harry if you want to start unpacking, feel free to do so," Mother said. She turned away, then turned back to face him. “Oh, this is for you, Harry," she said, pulling out a piece of parchment from her dress pocket.
“You might want to come back out here. Ever since you left the table, Kyle has been all over him."
“Draco, it's not going to kill you. Remember, all day you have been touching things that were all touched by Muggles. Wearing these bowling shoes is the same thing. Besides, you'll still have your socks on," Hermione whispered to him. She had also sat down and was removing her tennis shoes.
“Add another one," he groaned, his hand falling away from my dick.
Listening to Seamus flat out lying to Hermione about me, I let out a shaky breath, and sank to the floor against the far wall. When I had seen Hermione's car pull up in front of the building, I had been happy, anxious to see my best friend. When Draco had climbed out of the passenger seat, I felt my heart plummet to my feet. The pain of betrayal had flashed through me and I had raced into the back room of the bookstore, begging Seamus not to say a word.
He appeared in front of me with a small pop. “Yes Mister Harry?" He said, bowing slightly.
Harry put his hands on the lions and pushed the doors open. His eyes widened at the sight before us. His room was set up like mine, but with subtle differences. The king-sized bed was surrounded with scarlet curtains, topped with a crimson canopy. The comforter was a rich gold color and the pillows were a nice shade of ruby red. There was a mahogany desk on one side with a floor to ceiling bookcase beside it. The view from his windows looked out over the large garden. Harry turned his attention to the fireplace and the black leather sofa that sat in front of it.
“Alright. Well, could you bring breakfast up to us?"
I stepped up to the side of the bed, stiffening slightly as I passed Charlie. I sat down on the edge of the bed. Hermione pulled down the blanket and my heart expanded at the cute little girl I was looking at. Her cheeks were rosy, and she had a full head of bright red hair. Her little eyes were closed. Hermione leaned forward and I instantly made a cradle with my arms. Hermione placed the baby into my arms.
“She got home a few days ago. She even helped me finish up your room. Although why you want your own room is a mystery to me," I said, with a slight pout on my face. He chuckled for a moment, then started looking for his glasses.
I smiled slightly and leaned into Harry's embrace as he began placing kisses along my jaw. He moved down my neck and nuzzled the chain of my necklace. “Oh, cut it out you two. We don't all need to see that," Ron said. He had crossed the floor and now stood near us.
“Harmless flirting? Draco, you have at least three hickeys forming on your neck," I accused, pointing.
I rounded on Charlie. “So, you were lying to me last night, weren't you?"
“Man, Harry. It's been ages since we've seen you around here," Lisa said, dropping her arms.
Harry pressed open mouth kisses all over my length, starting at the bottom of my shaft before working his way up to the head. He licked the slit, then dragged his tongue around the head. He began licking back and forth along the head of my dick. I moaned loudly, thrusting up my hips to get him to take me into his mouth. Instead of engulfing my shaft in his wet mouth, he pulled away. I let out a frustrated groan and raised my head to look down at him. “Harry, what's wrong? Don't you want me?" I asked.
“What's going on, Shawnna?" He asked as his eyes passed over Harry's chained down form. He moved closer to the bed, eyes wide as he saw the marks on Harry's skin.
“Well then, Draco, for you I would recommend the grilled chicken wrap with honey barbecue sauce and fries on the side," Harry said. He pointed out a section of my menu.
“Merlin, I've missed that sound. So, what did you want to talk to me about?" I asked him as I fastened my seatbelt.
I swore harshly under my breath and made my way back up to the table, ignoring the stares I was receiving. I threw myself down in my chair and raised my drink to my lips and took a small swallow. The alcohol burned down my throat.
“Do you work at St. Mungo's?" Ron asked.
He looked at me for a moment, then he nodded. I motioned for him to move over to the wall. He shut the tap off and leaned against the wall. I turned him so that his back was braced against it. I took a step closer.
“Dean? Dean Thomas? That really you?" I asked.
“I don't need to see it a third time. The fact is that you and Blaise were kissing. I'm not going to stick around when it's obvious that you don't love me. I won't do this," he said, closing the lid on his trunk. He waved his hand and his trunk and suitcases shrunk down. He picked them up and shoved them into the pocket of his trousers.
“Yes, Master Draco?" She squeaked.
“I'm fine, Dempsey," I called. As I heard him walk away, I felt my Healer's magic sliding beneath the surface of my skin. Both wrists were now healed, the cuts just pink lines on my skin. I watched as the lines faded away. I sat down on the floor and slit the left wrist open again. This cut wasn't as deep and healed a little quicker than the previous one.
“Draco, we discussed this. We agreed that it would be cowardly to wait to show him."
“A Royal Waterfall? No body has ordered a Royal Waterfall in weeks. I don't even know how to make a Royal Waterfall," Krista said.
“No, not right now," Harry said.
Draco's cheeks pinkened as he caught the meaning behind my words. I finished driving to the Manor in silence.
“I was there to visit my mother. She'd been having nightmares and I took her to St. Mungo's to help her get better. I knew she wanted to talk to Harry, so I invited him up to her room with me," Draco continued.
“I didn't see that outside either."
Mr. Weasley raised his wand and produced several more chairs and two more couches so everyone would have a place to sit while he opened all our gifts. I moved over to one of the other couches and sat down. Charlie was instantly by my side and sitting down right next to me. Percy didn't look to happy about it.
“You want to know what I want? I want you," I said.
He slid off my lap and walked over to pick her up. “Smells like someone needs her diaper changed," he said when Rose was in his arms. Ron chuckled, then rose up from the couch. He took his daughter from Draco and disappeared down the hall. Draco smiled, then walked back to me. He sat back down on my lap. Without warning, he leaned forward and pressed his lips to mine. It wasn't a quick kiss; his lips just about devoured mine, both of his hands tangling in my hair.
“You're right. From the moment I entered the tavern, I could tell that someone was in pain. I felt a throbbing ache around my hip. The closer I got to you, the stronger I felt the pain. But also, every time you shifted, a fresh wave of pain pulsed through my own hip."
Without a word, Harry turned on his heel and stormed to the door. The door blew off its hinges with his uncontrolled magic. Harry stormed up the stairs and disappeared from sight. Kingsley was the first to move. “Briggs, Robards, take Lucius back to his cell. Meet us at the portkey," he said. He turned and quickly took off in the direction that Harry had gone.
“Marko, what's going on tonight? Your place is never this busy." I said as I shook his hand.
“Draco cut his wrists before?"
“So, I see you have most of my things packed for me," I said.
Draco nodded, but didn't take his eyes from Rose. Hermione stared at him for a moment, then turned to me. “Well, all I can say is, ´it's about time'," she said. I noticed Draco raise his head at her words.
“Sure, I'll go with you, Harry."
“Works for me," I said. Pansy reluctantly agreed. The six of us rose from the table and began walking towards Gringotts.
We sat in silence for a few moments until Josie brought their drinks. She set them on the table and walked away.
I glanced over at them as Draco's laugh sounded again. I smiled as I leaned closer to Hermione. “I honestly can't believe you two are okay with my relationship with him," I whispered to her. My eyes passed over the two of them.
“So, where does that leave us? What happens next?" I asked. I was curious to hear what he would say.
“Well, it started out with the Healers asking me questions about how I had healed your hip and how I stopped Rose's choking. Then they asked how good I was at healing wounds, even though I can't heal my own anymore," I said.
Hermione smiled and turned to Pansy. “Sure Pansy. Harry and I came up with this idea to spend the day like Muggles," she began, but Pansy cut her off.
As he pulled the shirt over his head, I again noticed the hickeys that marked his skin. “I could heal those for you," I said, pointing to his neck.
“Want me to walk you back?" I asked slyly as he reached out his hand and helped me to my feet.
“Draco, don't say that. You and I both know how that curse feels," I said. It was something that neither one of us had ever discussed; how we had both been tortured by Lord Voldemort with one of the three unforgivable curses known to the wizarding world. I still remembered the way my blood felt like it was on fire, as the curse ripped through me. I banished the thought from my mind, and instead, I turned my attention to the comfort of his body underneath me on the sofa.
I followed his magic, until I found him sitting in the highest level of bleachers, facing in a southwest direction, magic billowing around him. I took a deep breath and cautiously moved towards him. He turned his head at my approach, his magic slowing as he tried to rein it in. I slowly sat down about six inches away from him, and I reached out my hand. When I made contact with his knee, he sucked in a breath and his magic settled as my touch calmed him.
“Is that possible for someone there to know where he disappeared to?" I asked.
Charlie had apparated in to make sure that I was okay, then he had gone back to the Burrow. I was still picturing the look on Ron's face when Charlie had said we were together. It was like I had betrayed him by not telling him about my relationship with his brother. A tear rolled down my cheek as the thought that Ron would no longer want to be my friend crossed my mind.
“Yeah, you too Percy," I answered. Penelope now moved towards me. “Harry, this is my sister Jolene," she said, indicating the young woman talking to Mrs. Weasley.
Harry rolled over, but didn't wake up. I walked around the side of the bed and sat down next to him. I reached out my hand and gently shook him. He opened his eyes slowly, blinking hard. He sat up and looked around. He seemed slightly confused. When he reached up to rub a hand across his face, I realized what was confusing him; he couldn't see without his glasses. I reached over and plucked them from my nightstand.
I stiffened at the mention of my mother's study. I had known she wanted to show Harry some of her memories of me growing up, but I hadn't thought she would do it today when he was still weak from the magic he had suffered yesterday. I let my ´mask' slip into place as I turned around to face Hermione again. “Well, I haven't seen him, but when I do, I'll be sure to give him your message."
“I'd like that. Like it even more if you walk me to my room when we get there." He grinned and laced his fingers through mine.
“Does what you have planned involve our bedroom?" I asked him.
I told him what had been going on; how I'd throw up a few times first thing in the morning and I would be nauseous and queasy until about three in the afternoon. I told him how the smell of greasy foods made me throw up, and how I would feel perfectly fine around dinner time. Neville piped up and told Dean how I would eat a lot of food at dinner, then have a snack later in the evening. Dean listened carefully as he continued to cast diagnostic spells over me. He occasionally flicked his wand at the parchment on the counter.
(See the end of the chapter for
“How do you know about that?" I asked.
“Actually, I'd like what Mr. Malfoy is drinking," he said, indicating me with a wave of his hand.
Ginny brings Ron to Harry's and Charlie's place in an effort to make Harry and Ron talk to each other.
“You can come up with me, if you want to.  She's actually asked me about you a couple of times."
“Well, look what the wind blew in," said one of the three hostesses that were standing by the podium. One of them left the podium and threw her arms around Harry. He reluctantly released my hand and returned her embrace.
We fell silent, just glaring at each other. My phone rang and I broke my glare at Seamus and looked down as I pulled my phone from my pocket. Seeing Draco's number on the screen, I growled, and placed the phone face down on the floor next to my leg, as it continued to ring. I turned my attention back to Seamus to see the softened expression on his face.
He picked up his jacket and walked around the bed to get his wand from my nightstand. He slid his wand into his pocket and pulled the jacket on. He zipped it up.
Jolene smiled and sat back down in the chair next to the fireplace. Without a word, the rest of the family settled in the chairs. We were now in a circle around Mr. Weasley and the large pile of presents. I could see my gift for him; the gold colored wrapping paper and the dark red ribbon stuck out like a sore thumb.
“You might laugh at me, but I was a bartender in a Muggle bar."
Our tongues danced against each other, in a sensual battle of dominance, with Harry seeming to come out the victor. I slid my hand up from his hip and ran it across his back. I could feel the scars that crossed his skin. I pulled myself closer to him, and pushed my hips against his. My erection brushed against his. I moaned softly against his lips.
I reached over and grabbed half of Draco's sandwich. I brought it to my plate and set it down. I picked up half of my sandwich and placed it on his plate. Draco smiled at me. Ron rolled his eyes at us.
," I cried.
“Harry?" I heard Charlie's voice behind me. I spun around to find him standing there in nothing but his pajama pants.
I didn't move until he reached up and pulled me down for another kiss. “You can move now. Your not hurting me," he whispered against my lips.
“Ron was telling Draco about growing up with his brothers," Hermione answered.
“Watch me," Charlie replied.
“But what about having an heir to continue the Malfoy family?" Harry asked, still following the Tahoe.
He began slowly; first sliding himself out of me until just the head of his dick was still inside me, then he would thrust forward, burying himself completely in my body. His rhythm was slow and steady, as if he was afraid of hurting me. “More," I said. He didn't need to be told twice. He grabbed my hips and hauled me against him as he thrust forward. I reached my hand between our bodies and wrapped my fingers around my hardened dick. I began to pump my fist up and down my shaft, keeping perfect rhythm with his thrusts. Before long, we were both moaning, our bodies tightening as our orgasms approached.
I broke away from his lips and began to kiss my way down his chest. He growled low in his throat as I moved lower. Before I had reached my destination; his glorious and fully formed erection, he caught my arms and pulled me back up. A small whimper escaped my throat and I tried to slide back down his body.
Kyle walked away, his shoulders slumped slightly in defeat. Harry held my hand for a moment longer, then he let me go. He grabbed the bottle of ketchup and squeezed it over his fries. I took the ketchup from him and squeezed some onto my fries. We sat in silence for a few moments, happily enjoying our food. Suddenly Harry looked up at me, a sly smile forming on his lips, and a wicked gleam in his eyes. Without a word, he reached over and grabbed my food, sliding it closer to himself.
I thought to myself.
Harry chuckled at me. “Yeah, I've been looking, but not really finding one that I like."
“I kind of like that idea. Okay, as of now we're officially a couple again, but no more sleeping together until after a few dates," I told him.
Draco raised his eyes to look at me. There was such misery in his eyes, I felt like my heart would break open. I couldn't stop myself from leaning towards him and taking his lips in a gentle kiss. I wrapped my arm around his waist and pulled him off the arm of the chair and into my lap. He curled up against my chest and let his head rest on my shoulder.
“Actually, Harry, this wasn't the first time he ever cut his wrists. He did it before a few times."
“Sorry. It seems like neither one of us can follow your rules about working on our friendship."
“I came to see you. Your mother told me about what happened," she said, her eyes still on my wrist. “Why would you do this to yourself?" She asked me.
~~~~~
“Draco, Pansy. Over here!"
“Hi Harry. Been wondering when you would show up," Hermione said. She sat up slightly. I moved over to the couch and bent down to give her a hug.
“What do you mean by that?" I asked.
“Sure, Harry. Take your time. Just let me know what you decide. I'll personally get a room ready for you."
Harry crawled out of bed and began to search around the room as best as he could. With a muttered oath, Harry sat down on the floor. He snapped his fingers and suddenly, his glasses flew out from under the bed and into his hand. As he slipped them onto his face, I realized that he had used magic without a wand, again.
I looked up at my arms and found that my wrists were tied to the headboard with a dark green cloth. I tried to move my legs and discovered that my ankles were also tied down. I looked at Harry to find him grinning wickedly.
“But to use an Unforgivable Curse on a twelve year old boy? Was that something his father did to Lucius?"
Before I could answer, a young woman stepped up to the table. “Another Firewhisky, Mr. Potter?" She asked.
Before he could answer, Draco apparated into the apartment. He glanced at us for a moment, where I still knelt on the floor in front of Charlie, shrugged his shoulders, and started to gather more boxes into the fireplace. “Is this everything?" He asked as he grabbed the last box next to the couch.
I looked down at my wrists, rubbing them softly. My chest ached with the forgotten scars across it. “Yes. About ten years ago. We were fighting at Hogwarts and throwing curses at each other. He used a spell that he didn't what would happen. I forgave him a while ago," I said, keeping my head down.
“I don't really have a uniform. My boss just requires that the bartenders wear black shirts, but that's really the only thing."
As we crossed the pavement towards the double doors, I looked around at the building. The building was a brick building, with yellow and black paint around the doors. On the glass of the doors, there was a logo of some kind of animal with a wing sprouting from its back. I was confused, as I had never seen anything like it. I glanced at the words above the doors. “Buffalo Wild Wings? What kind of a place is this?" I asked Harry.
I pulled away and looked down at him. “What are you doing?" I asked.
“As soon as possible sir. I want to go before Draco loses his nerve."
“I'll join you guys, but I'm not sitting next to Potter," Blaise said.
“Yeah, I'm not too hungry right now," she said, settling back against the couch cushions.
“We'd better move this conversation to a different room. Otherwise, his magic will react to what I have to say and he'll be right back to where he was a moment ago," Dean said. He slowly stood from the bed, stumbling slightly.
“Is that your uniform for the bar?"
“Harry, you've told me before that your uncle referred to your magic as an abnormality. How is that abuse?"
“And you?" Kyle asked, looking at me.
“Not my fault that you're here early. You said two o'clock. It's only one thirty." I said as I slid my belt through the loops on my trousers.
“Not yet, there's still one more coming," he replied.
I slowly made my way to the sink, keeping my eyes on the floor in front of me. I turned on the cold water and splashed it across my face. I shut off the water and grabbed the hand towel hanging on the end of the counter. I patted my face dry, before I finally raising my eyes to the mirror. My eyes were red from crying, my cheeks blotchy. My hair was messy and clung to my forehead.
Before anyone could say anything else, a woman's voice was calling out to them. Harry, and the others turned. I watched as a young woman with curly dark hair crossed the parking lot towards us. “Connie, you're a customer. You don't have to park in the employee's parking lot every time you come here," Randy said.
Draco's hands caught my shirt and lifted it. I broke the kiss so I could remove it. I grabbed his shirt and removed it as well. I began to place kisses along his chest. I raised my head when I noticed the faint scars that marked his chest. I began to trace one of the scars with the edge of my tongue. He moaned and threaded his fingers through my hair.
I glanced at Draco when he let out a deep sigh. There was a far away look in his eyes that I had seen several times at the bar. “Draco, is everything ok?"
“Is there anything Master Draco and Mister Harry wants for breakfasts? Poppy make whatever you likes," she said enthusiastically, nodding her head and making her ears flap.
“Good night, Harry. I love you," I whispered. I felt my heart swell with pride as I said the words. I snuggled against him and let my eyes close as I finally drifted off to sleep.
“Oh, God," I said. I spun around to face Charlie. I knelt on the floor in front of him and reached out my hand to his face to force him to look at me. His face had drained of color, making his blue eyes stand out. “Do you really have an STD?" I asked.
“Charlie, what difference does it make if you know or not?" I asked.
“I don't need my wand to heal it. I'm a Healer," I said simply.
Hermione tugged on the sleeve of my shirt. I turned around and followed her out the door. Sliding into her car, I felt like I was going to burst into tears. “So, now what?" I asked.
“This whole situation, he's only doing it to make you happy. He told you he was fine, because he knew that's what you wanted him to say. Before he left, he left me a note. He said seeing you with Chase felt like his heart had been ripped out."
“I'm a little more advanced than they are, but yeah like them," I said. “The vast majority of them still need to use their wands, or they need to team up with others to heal. I don't. I can do it on my own."
“Answer me."
“We can go to my room. It's just down the hall so you'll be close if Harry needs you," I said. I stood up and led them from the room. We traveled down the hall towards my room, but I changed direction at the last moment and opened the door across from mine. This room was smaller than mine, but it would accommodate the five of us nicely. Stepping through the door, Hermione quickly cast a cleaning charm on the room. She waved her wand and a few chairs appeared next to the sofa near the fireplace.
“Well, Rainforest Falls is a Muggle bar. If Harry's used magic to make himself disappear over the last week, I doubt that they would know where he disappeared to," I said, fiddling with my seatbelt. As anxious as I was about finding Harry so I could at least explain what had happened, there was also the feeling in the pit of my stomach that Harry wouldn't want to see me.
“I knew he was up to something. He was a little too willing to join us at the table," he said. He turned on the tap and held his shirt underneath it. Suddenly he leaned forward, bracing his hands on the edges of the sink, and sucked in a sharp breath. His face twisted in pain again.
“I'm going to talk to Harry and I'm going to apologize for your behavior. You two better not be at this table when I come back!" I growled.
“You call that the easy way? Draco, Voldemort would have killed you and your family if you hadn't joined him. You know that. Nothing about Voldemort was ever easy," Harry said from behind me. He gently rubbed his hand across my back.
Hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for the next chapter. It will be ready as soon as possible.
When we reached the table, Harry dropped his arm from Mother's and pulled a chair out for her at the end of the table. She smiled as she took the offered seat. After he had pushed her chair in, I caught his arm. I pulled him over to my usual spot on Mother's right-hand side. I pulled out the chair next to mine and waited for him to sit down. Once he was seated, I pulled out my chair and sat. Remembering the flowers in my hand, I pulled out my wand and summoned a vase. The vase landed on the table in front of me and I placed the bouquet of flowers into the vase and tapped it with my wand to fill it with water.
“What brings you here? Especially you Hermione; haven't seen you since you got pregnant," Steve said as he dropped his arms.
“She said she hasn't seen him since he ran from her study earlier. Ron and I are headed to his parents house for the evening and we just wanted to tell Harry goodbye."
Curious, I picked up the scroll and untied the maroon ribbon that held the scroll shut. I skimmed my eyes over the parchment. “Harry, what exactly is this?" I asked, feeling a little hope rise in my chest.
“What do you mean, technically?"
“No, Harry. I want you to see the actual memory, the whole thing, not just the kiss. Don't you have a Pensieve?" Hermione asked.
“Get in line, Ronald," Draco said. “If anyone is going to kill him, you can guarantee that I'll be the first to do so."
He spun around to face me. His blue eyes were blazing with anger. “Why are you so determined to figure out where my bruises come from? And why are you accusing me of cheating anyway? Trying to protect yourself because You're the one cheating?" He snapped.
Hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for the next chapter. It will be ready as soon as possible.
I stared at the bruise. It was about the size of my hand. It was an ugly purplish black and in the center, there was a puncture wound as though someone had stabbed him.
Harry grinned at me, then he held out his hand to me. I stepped forward and took his hand. I brought my other hand up and gripped his elbow. He twisted on the spot and together, we disapparated.
“I honestly don't know. I haven't looked at what the house elves brought. It all smells delicious though." I lifted off the lids that were on the dishes. I uncovered eggs, toast, sausage and sweet roles. With a wave of my wand, I divided the food onto two plates. Harry reached for a plate and pulled it closer to him.
“What's so funny?" I asked. I brought my cigarette to my lips and pulled out my lighter. I lit the cigarette and took a drag from it. I blew out smoke as I waited for his response.
“Ron, stop!" I yelled, chasing after him.
“Is everything alright, Draco?"
“Harry, just because I'm tired when I get home, it doesn't mean I don't love you. And I've slept in the guest room because by the time I was getting home, you were already in bed and I didn't want to wake you up," he said.
Charlie glanced at me. I nodded. “I know about his relationship status, because I'm the one he's been dating for the last six months."
Curious of the time, I summoned my wand and cast a silent
We stepped out of my room and I closed the door behind me. We made our way down the stairs. “So, Harry, why do you stay here? Why don't you stay at Grimmauld Place?"
I sighed and glanced at the clock on the wall. Charlie said ten minutes, so that's what I was going to do. I walked back into the kitchen and picked up our mugs off the table. I stepped over to the sink and turned on the tap. I let the water warm up before I stuck the mugs under the stream of water to rinse them out. I shut off the tap and turned the mugs upside down in the dish rack.
“Not in the way your thinking, Malfoy. He went to leave and I stood in his way. He put his hands on my shoulders and pushed me out of his way. My hip hit the corner of a table. It's not a big deal," he explained.
*****
I fell silent and looked down at my feet while Draco and Narcissa talked about random topics. My head was spinning as I processed this new information.
“Are you referring to when I said I had something special planned for your birthday?" When I nodded, he chuckled and continued, “Part of it. Now sit up. I want to give you your present."
Before Draco could respond, Ron tapped him on the should and pointed to the lane. Draco sighed, before he rose from the table to go take his turn. Ron waited until Draco was up at the lane before he turned to me. “That's bullocks Harry. Saying you're not jealous. You just got pissed off because some other guy was flirting with him. Don't you think that is jealousy?"
I looked at his back, and I couldn't look away. His skin was a rich tan and there were scars crossing his back in several ways. I watched his muscles ripple under his skin as he worked. My heart started to race. I just starred at him, willing myself not to go over to him and run my hands over his skin. I took an involuntary step closer to him and fought back a little moan.
Harry came around the corner of the kitchen, with a green apple between his teeth, a glass of milk in one hand and a sandwich in the other. When he saw me, he bit down on the apple freeing his mouth. The apple remained floating in the air near him as he chewed on the bite.
“Well, I was thinking, um,...I was thinking, oh, God. I can't say it."
“So, where are we going?" I asked.
I pulled my mouth away from him and slowly kissed my way back up his body. I laid across him and pressed my lips to his gently. He wrapped his arms around me and rolled us over. He kissed me deeply once I was pressed into my bedding. “My turn," he said. There was a wicked gleam in his eyes. He began to kiss his way down my body, biting gently in several spots. He ran his tongue around one of my nipples, then he bit down on it. I gasped, and brought my hands to his hair, holding him to me. Like a snake, he slithered out of my embrace, chuckling to himself.
We headed down the hall towards a large opening. We stepped into a large reception area. He led me over to the desk in the center of the room. “What department do you need?" Asked the medi-witch behind the desk. She didn't pay attention to us, just continued to scribble on the parchment in front of her.
I raised my hand and gently ran it through his slightly damp hair. “Harry, it was stupid of me to even ask that of you the first time. I promise that while we continue to work on our relationship, friendship, whatever you want to call it, I will not be with another guy again."
“Jensen didn't get hurt, did he?" Kingsley asked.
He kissed his way down my body towards my trousers. When he reached my waistband, he paused and looked up at me. “Yes," I said. He undid my belt. He hesitated for a moment, then he undid my trousers and began to tug them down my legs. I raised my hips and he pulled them off. He hooked his thumbs in the waistband of my boxers and slid them down as I moved up on my bed until I rested on my pillows. Harry knelt on the bed,  leaned over me and began kissing his way up from my ankle. He ran his tongue around the bend in my knee, biting his way gently up my thigh.
“Harry, just because I'm his son, it doesn't mean I had the best childhood. Every time I did something that he didn't approve of, he punished me, usually by beating me in some way. Like how I couldn't beat you at Quidditch, or how I couldn't beat Hermione at being the top student; those were things he punished me for constantly. He turned violent when I visited him last, because I told him that I'm gay," he said. He still wasn't looking at me.
I let my eyes travel over his body and noticed the unnatural way his shirt clung to his chest. I waved my wand and vanished his shirt. There across his chest were four bleeding wounds like the scars that marked my chest. Again I ran my fingers over the wounds, but again, nothing happened. The wounds were still there, and there was no blood on my hand.
I lowered my hands and placed them against his chest, pushing him back slightly. “Harry, wait. We're not dating right now, we shouldn't do this," I said, reluctantly.
I was slightly shocked by his words. “Harry, it shouldn't matter what he did. It's in the past. I'm still here," I said, rubbing my hand over his knee.
I swallowed him deeper into my mouth, and I moved my hand a little faster as I bobbed my head up and down on his shaft. I pulled my mouth off of him and ran my tongue around the head of his dick. I had been told before that I had talent when it came to giving blow jobs. Now, was a perfect opportunity to put my skills to work. I licked the entire length of his shaft, swirling my tongue around it lazily. I planted little kisses around the base of his dick and pulled one of his balls into my mouth, sucking gently on it. After a moment, I switched and pulled the other one into my mouth and repeated the action.
“I've missed you too, but I was too stubborn to come back. Please forgive me for this past week."
“Has my mother come down for breakfast?" He asked her.
I smiled to myself, knowing he was talking about Harry. The chair on the other side of Connie was pulled away from the bar. A man sat down and said, “I would like a Royal Waterfall, on the rocks, shaken, not stirred."
“Okay, fine. My point is, he's wanted to be with me since third year and I've wanted to be with him for a while, and now this. What angers me about it, though, is that we talked the other day and he asked if I would be okay if he was dating other people while we work on our friendship."
“I got it. I start my training on Monday. I'll be working in the children's ward," I exclaimed excitedly.
“I'm what?" I asked.
“Well, after my break up with Charlie,  I was a mess. I would get angry at the customers, and things would go wrong. My boss ordered me to take some time off work."
“Has anyone heard from Tracy? She was supposed to be here almost an hour ago."
“Harry, he told us that he broke up with you because you slept with Malfoy. Although how you could do that is beyond me," Ginny said from her place by the bed.
“You don't have to hide anything from us, Harry. I think Draco and I can accept you just the way you are," Mother said, picking up her knitting. He nodded again.
“Well, the Manor has plenty of space and then you wouldn't have to pay rent. You would have your own room with its own bathroom, house elves to bring your food to your room if you want it there. I'm sure Mother wouldn't mind." I reached over and placed my hand over his on the table.
? You are throwing away the Malfoy reputation, being with the person that tore our family apart."
Draco stepped over by me. He placed his wand to his temple, and pulled out the silvery strand of memory that he wanted me to see. With a flick of his wand, the memory dropped into the Pensieve. “If, after you see this, you still want me to leave you alone, I'll walk away and not look back," he said. Then he walked over and sat down next to Hermione on my bed. She reached out and grabbed his hand, giving it a friendly squeeze.
Hermione has given birth to her daughter. Harry goes to St. Mungo's to pay a visit, and runs into Draco, who is visiting his mother.
“Is this going to be a regular thing; waking up in each other's beds?" He asked.
“Now, Draco, it's nothing to be ashamed of. So what if you liked him? You can't help who you fall in love with." Draco's cheeks darkened.
“So, Harry, I never got a chance to thank you for keeping Draco and myself out of Azkaban. If it wasn't for your testimony during our trial, we would both be rotting in that prison next to Lucius."
“Where is the bathroom at?" I asked suddenly. Harry pointed out the hallway where the bathroom was located. I slid out of the booth and made my way to the men's room. I moved over to a urinal and emptied my bladder.
“Potter? As in
The gates swung open without a sound. I turned back to Harry and held out my hand to him. He took my hand and linked his fingers through mine. I led him up the pathway between the two rows of hedges that towered over us. The gates swung shut behind us with a boom. The walk to the front door was long, but we were comfortable without saying anything.
“That song is about me, isn't it?" I asked sitting down.
Silence fell around us. I sat there watching as my boyfriend and my best mate got along with each other. My smile got bigger as I watched them talking without even trying to hex each other. My heart expanded with joy.
Shame hit me like a brick; shame and regret for the pain I had caused Draco over the last week. Tears welled up in my eyes as I glanced over my shoulder towards the bed. Draco was sitting there, crying softly against Hermione's shoulder. I turned around and took a step forward. As soon as I did, Draco raised his head and looked over at me. He rose to his feet, watching me carefully. He took a small step towards me and opened his arms.  With a sob, I practically ran to him and allowed him to wrap his arms around me.
“I-I don't know wh-what you're talking about, Malfoy," Charlie stammered out again. He wouldn't look at me.
I shook my head. “Like me, she'll understand. All Mother wants is for us to be happy, and if we have to slow down to get there, then she's going to support our decisions."
I walked back towards the bedroom. I flicked my wand and the bed made itself and the dirty clothes flew into the hamper. I smiled, pleased with my work. I slipped my wand into my pocket before walking over to the wardrobe. I pulled a cloak from inside the wardrobe, shut the door, and pulled the cloak around my shoulders. I walked back into the living room and glanced at the clock again. It was time. I pulled the cloak tighter around me and closed my eyes. I thought about the grassy field outside of the Burrow and and twisted on the spot. I disapparated with a small pop.
“Draco, what kind of cake do you want for your birthday party on Saturday?" Mother asked me.
Without a word, the waitress turned around and practically ran to the kitchen. Ron's laughter broke through. Draco and I joined in with our own laughter. “Merlin, that was funny. How thick could she be? You two were holding hands on top of the bloody table."
That seemed to snap Kyle out of his stare. He blinked, then turned back to Harry. “Can I get you guys something besides water to drink?" He asked.
“Now that's something that I never thought would come out of Draco's mouth," came a voice. I turned my head. My jaw dropped in surprise;Theodore Nott, whom I hadn't seen since my disastrous birthday, was standing at the end of the table.
“If you are not cheating on me, where did those hickeys come from?" I asked, pointing to his neck. He raised his hand up to it.
“That must have been rough. Did he cheat on you like your most recent ex?"
I put my empty mug on the table and stood up. I followed him into the living room and over to the fireplace. Charlie flicked his wand and summoned our jumpers from the bedroom. They were the jumpers we had gotten from his mother at Christmas time; the Weasley tradition every year. His was black with a light grey “C" on it. Mine was a dark blue with a red “H" on it. We pulled them over our heads because we knew that Mrs. Weasley loved to see us wear them.
And so the memories continued, each one showing me a darker side to Lucius than I had originally thought possible. Every memory showed him yelling at Draco for things that were beyond his control, calling Draco a disgrace to the Malfoy family; every other memory seemed to involve hitting Draco in some way. I watched, horrified, when Narcissa caught Draco cutting his wrists for the first time the Christmas break during fourth year, after he had gotten yelled at by Lucius, who had told him that he didn't deserve to live in the Manor.
“Goods morning, Master Harry. Will yous be joining the others fors breakfasts this morning?" He asked as he finished tucking the blanket under the pillows.
I stepped forward and took my own helping of floo powder. I threw it down on the hearth and called out, “Ministry of Magic, Minister's office." I stepped into the flames and disappeared with a swirl of color.
“In answer to your question Harry, I found out last week, when I got a burning, itching sensation in my groin."
I sighed. I gently pulled his hand up to my lips. “Well, if your that scared of going, I can come with you," I said.
I quickly relayed the message, then watched as the Tahoe put its blinker on and pulled over to the side of the road. Harry drove past them and then Hermione pulled in behind us. Harry turned a corner, then he continued down the road.
," I whispered, magically locking the door.
“Hey Peter, can I ask why your brother has been telling me that I wasn't needed as a bartender lately?"
“Well if Blaise is staying with you, then I'll join you as well. But I'm not sitting next to Potter either."
A/N: This chapter contains a song by Jesse McCartney called
Charlie ignored him and looked directly at me. “You need to tell my brother about your relationship. If you don't, I will, and I won't hesitate to tell the Prophet about you and Malfoy either!" He snapped.
As I watched my wrist waiting for it to close like it had several times before, I felt like something was wrong. My vision was starting to swim and I was seeing blackness along the edge of my vision. I blinked trying to clear my head, before I noticed that my wrist wasn't healing. I glanced down at the other wrist and noticed it was still bleeding. In the back of my mind, I began to panic that my Healer's magic hadn't closed the wounds.
“Any Good?" He asked.
--------------
A tingle of arousal slid down my spine at the feeling of his lips against my bare skin. I fought back a little moan as he pressed kiss after kiss against the scar, before he began traveling his lips up my arm towards my Dark Mark. “Harry, stop. This isn't helping us to just be friends," I said. Harry raised his head, his cheeks flushing a bright red.
~~~~~
I turned my head and saw Dean standing inside the hidden doorway behind me. He had pushed aside the bookcase and stood at the base of the stairs that led up to the apartment. “So, Harry, how does it feel knowing that you caused Draco as much pain as you caused back when we were sixteen?" Seamus questioned.
“A Muggle restaurant not too far from here. I haven't been there in a while, but I know they have good food," he answered. He took my hand, lacing his fingers through mine, and led me back down the hall and down the stairs. He led me straight out the door and we turned left. Without letting go of my hand, Harry began to walk down the street.
He chuckled softly, pulled me down and kissed me gently on the lips. When I pulled away, I snuggled myself against his chest and settled back down to sleep.
“I would blame him being drunk, but he's not that good an actor," he said. He looked down at his shirt and continued to trace his wand over it.
“Where's your baby at?" I asked Ron.
“Harry, please let me explain," I said, taking a small step closer.
Ron and Hermione made there way down the stairs when I offered to let them join Mother and I for dinner. I crossed the hall into my room. I crossed over to my bureau and pulled a vial of Dreamless Sleep Potion off the top of it. I went back to Harry's room and found him drifting off to sleep. I gently shook his shoulder to gain his attention.
I was about to drop the subject, when I noticed a faint bruise peaking out from the top of his collar. It was on the back of his neck, and it looked very much like a hickey. I knew it hadn't come from me; I usually leave hickeys on his chest not his neck.
“Sounds like a plan to me. I like the sound of being your boyfriend."
“What do you mean?" She asked as she drove down the street.
Hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for the next chapter. It will be ready as soon as possible.
“Can I ask who it was that you slept with?" He asked gently.
“You're always starving," the rest of us replied all at the same time.
A look of pain crossed his face, but he straightened up. He looked down at me for a moment, then turned and walked out the door.
“Harry, that's how it's always been in pureblood circles. The Head of the Family can basically do whatever they want to everyone else. Look, I'm touched that you wish to defend my honor, but its not necessary."
“Well, what did you tell him?" Hermione asked, placing her hand on my right leg where it was placed over my left knee.
“I don't know Harry. We actually could have used your help the last few days. You are the best bartender that I've ever hired. I've even had customers stop coming because you weren't here. From now on, I'll write up the schedules and I'll make sure you're on it."
“Are you living here?" I asked, glancing past him at the room beyond. There was a jacket draped over the back of a chair next to a desk. I could see the corner of the bed and I could tell that the bed wasn't made; I could see the comforter hanging off the bed, almost touching the floor.
“I can heal that," I said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The night's not over yet," I said.
“I usually glamour them. I didn't today because I'm tired of hiding them," I said, still staring at my wrists.
I dropped my arms from around her as she turned to Harry. She held out her arms to him. He hesitated for a moment, then stepped into the circle of her arms. Like she had done to me, she smoothed her hand over his unruly black hair. I fought back a laugh, as his hair refused to lie flat. They dropped their arms about the same time.
A pure white light spread from the palms of Dean's hands. The light flowed over Harry's body, small tendrils disappearing into his ears. The harder Dean concentrated, the brighter the light shown. Harry let out a soft sound as the light intensified around him. Slowly, one by one, the wounds that weren't really there began to disappear from Harry's body.
The door across from me opened. “Alright, Harry. They're gone. Want to tell me what that was all about?"
Ron rose to his feet and walked over to her. He sat down next to her on the couch and pulled her into his arms without a word. He mumbled something to her and rubbed his hand up her back for a moment. Hermione buried her face into his shoulder and let herself cry.
“Why should I believe that? I saw the kiss in both Ron's and Blaise's heads. You looked pretty cozy in his arms," I said.
(See the end of the chapter for
He rolled towards me and pressed his lips to mine. He pressed me deeper into the bed as he laid on top of me. The kiss became a little more frantic as we both fought for dominance. We rolled around on the bed, trying to pin the other one down. His hands began to roam over me, running up my arms, down my chest, touching anything he could reach. He finally managed to pin me down by pressing his hips against mine.
Pansy and Blaise stared at me for a moment, then Blaise slid onto the booth bench I had just vacated. Pansy hesitated a moment longer, then slid in next to him.
“Can I ask why you don't work here all the time? I saw your skills when you healed my hip. Your an amazing healer."
He nodded and pulled his trunk and suitcases from his pocket. He set them on the bed and waved his hand. They enlarged to the normal size they had been. Harry glanced down at his watch. “I'll put these away later. I want to go get my things."
“So, the story in the Daily Prophet was true? You're gay?" I asked, shock coloring my voice.
“Harry, listen to me, we can still make our relationship work. We can fix it. This will never happen again."
I had been back at Malfoy Manor for about a week, and things weren't the same as they were before. Draco wouldn't be in the same room with me unless Narcissa was in the room, the house elves had started calling me Mister Harry again, where before Draco's birthday they had started calling me Master, and even Narcissa treated me like I didn't belong around the Manor. She had welcomed me back with open arms, and then, just like her son, she had become cold and distant.
Harry and Charlie head to the Burrow for Mr. Weasley's 60th birthday party. Charlie's unsuspecting brother, Percy, and his wife bring her sister along with hopes of setting her up with Harry. Charlie gets a little bit possessive over Harry and their secret comes out.
I stood and followed him. I found him in the living room, hands braced against the bookcase. “How come you never want to cuddle with me anymore?"
“Okay, who should we invite?" Mother asked, pulling me from my thoughts.
“Krista, calm down. I have a bartender on the way. Actually he should have been here by now, but until he gets here, you'll have to handle things."
“That's what friends do; they help each other out. At first they didn't want you there, just because of your name. When I told them how you healed my hip, and then how you helped Rose, they're willing to give you a chance."
“Give me your hand," Draco said. He reached out and grabbed the young man's wrist. The blood was running down his hand. Draco pulled away the fabric that was tied around his hand in an effort to stop the bleeding. Draco pressed his thumb against the bleeding wound. In an instant, the wound was gone.
“Harry, it isn't what you think. Marcus got drunk last night and I brought him here to sleep it off," he said. He held up his hands defensively.
I opened my mouth to speak, but Charlie cut me off. “Back off Percy. I choose to sit by Harry and that's how it's going to be. Just because Bill and I are gay, it doesn't mean we always have to sit by each other. What do you think is going to happen? That us sitting by other people is going to turn them gay as well?"
“It's a Pensieve. I have one myself."
“Draco, Harry left. He got upset by Chase flirting with you."
“Actually Draco, there is someone else there that's a part of our world," she said as she pulled into the parking lot behind the bar. She even parked in the exact same spot Harry parked in all the time. She killed the engine and we both got out of the car.
“Harry, you know I love you, but..." I began, only for Harry to cut me off.
“Everyone step closer to my desk," Kingsley said. We stepped forward, forming a circle around Kingsley's desk, Harry to my left and one of the Aurors to my right. Kingsley pulled out his pocket watch and looked down at it. “Alright everyone. We all need to touch the portkey, it's almost time for it to activate," he said.
“What do you mean?"
“Actually, you should have noticed it first during our first night together. If you remember, after we were done, my wand was suddenly in my hand. But, you also used wandless magic on that night."
“He used to fancy me? I find that hard to believe. He always hated me in school."
“Hermione, dear, are you staying out here?" Mrs. Weasley asked.
Harry glanced over my shoulder. “Well, so he is."
Kyle returned, setting a lemonade in front of me and an ice tea, plus a sugar bowl in front of Harry. “Have you decided what you want?"
“Remember what happened in sixth year?" She asked. Draco flinched and turned his back on the room. I swallowed hard, but didn't answer. She signed. “Harry, I'm talking about when he was in the hospital wing afterwards. I know you snuck out of the dormitory quite a bit to go see him."
Draco nodded. “I'll be back in a few minutes," he said, before disappearing into the flames again.
“I brought Draco, my boyfriend, here for lunch. He's never been here before so I thought he would enjoy it. Kyle here has been flirting with me ever since we sat down. When my boyfriend went to the bathroom, Kyle started to put his hands all over me."
Harry has decided to move into Malfoy Manor. He also returns to Charlie's place to get the rest of his things. Draco tags along and helps Harry bring his stuff to Malfoy Manor. Harry gets a little shock about Charlie in the process.
He must have noticed my silence. He turned around and I let my eyes travel around his throat. There was another one on the right side of his neck.
When I pulled away from his lips, I heard Mother laughing quietly. I raised my head and turned to look at her. “You two just look so cute together," she said. I glanced down at Harry and discovered that his cheeks were flushed. “Alright, Draco. Leave your boyfriend alone and come over here and help me plan your party."
“Yes. I've been wanting to talk to you. Come, sit," Narcissa said. She gestured to the chair next to her bed. I moved forward and sat down. Draco sat down in the chair on the other side of the bed. He placed his hands in his lap and watched us.
When our feet touched the ground, Harry broke the kiss and we looked around. I had apparated us outside of Malfoy Manor, the iron gates right in front of us. I turned back to Harry and found him looking down at me. Our arms were still around each other.
“Oh, so you won't be home tonight? I thought maybe we could hang out together. I can wait up for you to get back," I suggested, slightly hopeful. My eyes were glued to his tan chest and the slight patterning of dark hair across it, and I licked my lips slowly.
I picked up my pack and pulled a cigarette from it. I lit it with a small flick of my lighter. After releasing the smoke from my throat, I spoke up. “Now, Harry must still be somewhere on the Manor grounds. The wards haven't given me the feeling that someone has left. Did you try his room?"
“Because I'm in a relationship with someone. I need to go home and try to fix it." He stood and walked over to my bed where his clothes were piled. I turned my head to watch him, a feeling of rejection sliding down my spine. I watched him pull his boxers up his legs before he removed my robe from his body. He sat on the bed to slide his legs into his jeans.
I stood at the sink, washing my hands, when the door opened behind me. A young man, wearing the same uniform that all the other employees were wearing, stood behind me. “Are you the guy that is on a date with Harry?"
“Actually, to tell you the truth, I never knew he played guitar. He knew I played violin, but I didn't know that he played."
“Leave him alone, 'Mione. It's not his fault that he's never had chili cheese fries before. So what if he overdid it? Let's not forget how you threw up a bit after we got off that rollercoaster before we even had lunch," Harry said, continuing to rub his hand across my shoulders.
I dragged the back of my hand across my mouth, wiping off my lips. “You're right. There must be something wrong. Give me about fifteen minutes to get ready, then you can take me there," I said.
“Not true. Yes, I had a one night stand with Malfoy, but Charlie didn't break up with me, I broke up with him. He had been sleeping with Marcus Flint for three months," I said. Without another word, I spun around and walked out the door.
He was right; I was close to my orgasm and with a few more strokes of his hand, I was spilling myself on the bed beneath me. Harry thrust into me a few more times before I felt him spilling his seed deep inside me. He collapsed over me for a moment, before he rolled onto his side without disconnecting from me and then he gathered me in his arms. He pressed a gentle kiss on the top of my head.
“Would it really have made a difference?"
With that, I made my way to the men's room. The throbbing in my hip was getting stronger as I made my way to the bathroom. I pushed open the door, and I paused. Harry was standing at the sink, his shirt was off and he was tracing his wand over where the Firewhisky had spilled.
“So, how long have you been together?" Ron asked. He glanced down at his menu, then flipped it over to properly read it.
“No, I drove today," I said, reaching into my pocket for the keys.
Without another word, Harry and Krista began to pour and mix drinks. The younger girl Alexis was passing the drinks around the bar and setting drinks on the end of the bar where the servers were picking them up. I watched in fascination as Harry worked. He looked at home behind the bar, mixing and pouring drinks with ease. He glanced at me from time to time, but he never let it distract him from what he was doing. I started to get hungry, and Harry ended up ordering me a burger and fries.
We drove in silence for a while after that. I studied him carefully; his eyes never left the road, but every now and then his knuckles turned white when he tightened his grip on the steering wheel. It seemed like he was trying to stop himself from reaching out to me.
“Have you visited him? You don't have to answer. I'm just genuinely curious."
“Harry, are you alright?" Mother's voice asked, pulling me away from my book. I glanced up and turned my head in his direction. He was sitting in an armchair near the window, there was a scowl on his face and his fingers were trembling against the book in his hands. It was early afternoon and we were sitting in the sun room, all three of us just kinda relaxing around.
“Kingsley will have a portkey ready at three thirty this afternoon," I said, shamelessly letting my eyes travel over his naked chest. Draco smirked.
“Now I still need time to decide if I'm gonna take you up on your offer of staying at Malfoy Manor. I'm tempted, but I need to think about it," Harry said. He leaned down and kissed me.
“Good night, Harry," he whispered.
“You know what, Draco? I didn't want to push you away. I was ready to drag you to the floor and I don't think you would have stopped me if I had."
A small smile tugged on the corner of Harry's mouth. Without another word, the two of us stood up and made our way out of the stands. When we reached the ground, we walked back to the Manor in silence; neither of us wanted to apparate back, because neither of us seemed ready to say goodbye.
“What, that I love you? That much is true Harry. I do love you."
“Mother! I'm going to be twenty seven on Saturday. Do you still have to throw me a party every year?" I asked, exasperatedly. Harry snickered from where he was laying next to me on the sofa, his legs across my lap.
“It sounds like the shower is running. Is there someone else in this apartment?"
I turned around again and found myself staring right at Hermione. She moved further into my room, closing the door behind her. She crossed the floor and gently took my left hand in hers. She gently ran her fingers over the bandages.
“So, you want honesty from me, but you don't seem to want to be honest with me," he said, not looking at me.
“No problem Harry. Are you ready to go back in so we can portkey off this island?" I asked him.
“You know what, if you two are so worried about Draco sitting with me, why don't you join us? I told him earlier that this table is big enough to hold four people," Harry said. I felt a little clench in my stomach when he used my name.
We laid there for several moments, just trading soft kisses. Harry pulled back and looked down at me, his green eyes swimming with several emotions. “I've missed you so much Draco, but before we go any further, please tell me you're not going to find someone else while we continue to work things out between us. I don't think I can bear it."
“Well, him being your ex was part of it," she mumbled.
Harry took a cigarette from the pack. I watched as he raised it to his lips and lit it with a small, silver lighter. He took a long drag from it. I watched his Adam's apple bob as he swallowed, before he released a cloud of smoke from his throat. He immediately seemed more relaxed.
I glanced over my shoulder at Draco. After the initial glance when Charlie had come out of the bedroom, Draco had turned his attention back to the kitchen. He seemed to be staring at something on the table. I noticed an evil little smile on the corner of his mouth.
Hermione released a little sigh, gave me a slightly disappointed look, then turned around and walked away. I waited until I was sure she was gone before casting a simmering charm on the potion and apperating straight into Mother's study. She looked up from the parchment she was scribbling on. “You just had to show him your memories today? Mother, I told you about what happened yesterday, now you've probably put more guilt on his shoulders," I snapped, placing my palms flat on her desk.
“She's been crying for the last ten minutes. I can't seem to get her to stop," Hermione said. I noticed tears in her eyes.
After a moment or two, Harry stood from the bed and gathered me in his arms. Holding me with one arm, he drew down the comforter and sheets, then placed me on the bed. He slid in next to me and brought the silk sheet up over us. He pulled me into his arms and tucked me against his right side. His arm wrapped around me and held me close. I naturally let my head rest against his shoulder, my right arm thrown across his waist. We laid there as our breathing quieted and our heart rates slowed.
Charlie stepped into the room behind me, but stopped short when I raised my wand that was still clenched in my hand. “Back off Charlie!" I growled. He took a step back and stared at me.
Harry reveals his relationship with Draco to Ron and Hermione. Draco gets to meet Harry's goddaughter, Rose. Ron and Hermione see Draco's healing abilities.
I stumbled out of Draco's fireplace, the boxes tumbling out next to me. I dropped to my knees on the floor beside the fireplace, my breakfast threatening to come back up my throat; mainly because of what had happened with Charlie, not because of traveling by floo. I sat there gagging, trying to keep my food down.
“Malfoy! What are you doing sitting with POTTER!!!" I glanced at the end of the table. My old friends, Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini stood at the end of the table, Blaise looked confused and Pansy looked ready to destroy the place. I glanced at Harry.
I apparated straight inside my kitchen. The room was the same as it had gotten left last night. The partly eaten meals on the table, Charlie's chair was still tipped over, the candles were nothing but dried wax on the table and the candlesticks.
I looked out the window at the darkening sky. I tried not to let my thoughts form a reason why he was late, but against my judgment, the thought forced it's way into my mind. It was a thought that I had come up with two weeks ago the first couple times that Charlie had come home late. I had only given voice to that thought once. I could still hear my conversation with Ron...
“He's telling the truth Harry. We have been sleeping together for almost three months. You were right when you accused me of cheating last night," Charlie said.
“You're right, I shouldn't be focusing on the negative aspect of this. What I should focus on, is how Draco will react when we get to the bowling alley," I replied just as a large cheer went up; Pansy had made a mistake on the dance, thereby allowing Draco to win. I watched as Ron begrudgingly handed a few coins to Theo.
I opened my mouth, but a blush spread across my cheeks at where my thoughts had gone moments before, and I couldn't find the words to say what I wanted from him. I closed my mouth and looked away.
“Tell me what happened," Alan said. He sounded weary.
I pushed open the door and walked inside, closing the door behind me. Narcissa stood near the window, a quill and parchment in hand as she studied the Venomous Tentacula plant growing there. Small vine-like tentacles wrapped around one of her wrists. The hand holding the quill paused for a moment, then she reached out and gave a sharp slap to one of the spiky leaves at the base of the plant. With a shriek, the tentacles fell away from her. I couldn't stop the chuckle that escaped from my lips.
Kyle reluctantly turned his attention to me. “I'll have the grilled chicken wrap with honey barbecue sauce and fries please," I said. He nodded and seemed to be writing it down, but I couldn't see a quill. I shook my head slightly.
“Hey, Harry? Don't be a stranger. Drop me an owl every now and then," I said.
“You two can find another table if you want. I'm fine right where I am," I replied.
As the food landed on our plates and bowls, I leaned across the table. “Ginny, have you ever heard anything from the Holyhead Harpies yet?" I asked her.
“What happened?" Ron asked. He looked at us for a moment, then said, “I just want to know how he got the bruise."
Draco pressed little kisses against my neck. I laid against him until our breathing quieted down. With a small snap of my fingers, I summoned my wand. I used a few cleaning spells to clean our bodies. I gathered Draco into my arms. I lifted him from the bed and pulled down the comforter. I laid him down and crawled into bed next to him. He came into my arms and placed his head on my chest. I caught the edge of the sheet and pulled it over us.
“No, I guess it doesn't."
I cleared my throat. “Well, I guess I'll go collect my things that you said were in the wardrobe."
After Harry took the parchment, Mother turned around and headed to the stairs. Harry glanced down at the parchment in his hand. “It's a list of the house elves. Whenever you need something, just call one of their names," I explained.
“You? You're the bartender that's filling in for Tracy?" She asked him.
He tightened his arm around me. “Yes, I'm aware of what I said. Does it bother you that I used that word?"
“Was starting to think you weren't going to come. Thought for sure that you would have changed your mind," he said by way of greeting. He motioned for me to come in.
I stayed on the floor for a moment longer, then I grabbed the table and pulled myself to my feet. My hip was screaming in protest at my movement. I limped over to the closet. I pulled out a jacket. I was going to a bar. I knew I didn't want to be here when Charlie got back.
“Harry, I think you were crushing on him before you even realized that you're gay, if your obsession with him in sixth year is anything to go by."
When he pulled away, all I could do was stare up at him. A lot of emotions were swimming in his eyes, love being among them. “I don't blame you Harry. If anything, I blame Snape. It was his own curse that he wrote down in his old potions book. You explained all that to me after the war ended. I know you; if you had known what that spell did, you never would have used it, not even on me."
As I tugged on my black jeans, I heard the sound of the bathroom door closing. I sighed. Charlie and I have been together for six months now and the rest of the Weasley family still didn't know. They knew I was gay; something the Daily Prophet couldn't resist posting when they had caught me coming out of the Three Broomsticks with my last boyfriend, Ernie Macmillan. Ron had taken it kinda hard that I never told him the truth, but him and the rest of the family still accepted me. Well, maybe not all; I hadn't seen Percy since the news broke out that I was gay, and I'm still not sure how he thinks. I sighed again as I pulled on a red t-shirt with a large black dragon on the front. Ron had given it to me after the Tri-Wizard Tournament to remind me of the dragon I had faced in the first task.
“Oh, fuck, Harry. You make me feel so good."
Draco apologizes to Harry for his self-centered behavior. A small argument takes place. Draco then comes back, two days later, after his interview at St. Mungo's, and the pair of them end up in bed. And Harry gets a surprise on his birthday.
“Alright I'll see what I can do. But I need to you to step away from the bed. The magic I have to use is tricky and I can't have anyone too close to it."
By the time the pizzas were delivered to the table, Chase had come back, and now he didn't seem in any hurry to leave. He straddled the chair next to Draco's, where they sat at a second table. I tried to squash my feelings every time I glanced in their direction, but it was getting harder and harder with every glance I spared them.
“I don't like him. Why would you even sit down with him?"
“Harry wouldn't let me explain. He believed what he saw through Legilimency of Ron's and Blaise's minds. He saw the kiss, but didn't see that I wasn't a willing participant in that kiss."
In answer, I caught his hips in my hands and ground our bodies together. A moan escaped from both of us. Draco pulled himself off the bed and stood next to it. He kicked off his shoes, unfastened his trousers and shoved them and his boxers down his legs. He stood before me in all his naked glory. My heart raced as I stared at him. Draco climbed back on the bed, settling his weight over my legs as he caught the edge of my pajama pants and boxers in his hands. He began to tug them down, so I raised my hips and let him pull them off of me.
He twisted to disapparate, but nothing happened. He tried again, with the same result. He stepped into the green flames that were still burning. “The Burrow!" He shouted. Again, nothing happened.
“I'll have one of the house elves show you to the sun room. Dempsey?" I called. With a small pop, a small male house elf appeared next to me. He was wearing a t-shirt and a pair of shorts that had been shrunken down to fit his small frame. He was the smallest house elf that we owned, but he was my favorite; he had been with me since the summer between third and fourth year, had always taken care of me when I had been punished by my father for being a disappointing son. His green eyes were almost the same shade as Harry's.
“Why?"
His hand grabbed my arm and he spun me around to face him. I yanked my arm from his grasp and folded my arms across my chest. “What do you want Charlie?" I snapped.
“Are you alright?" I asked him.
“Well it's not like I was getting anything from you," he snapped.
. I couldn't share his enthusiasm; now that we were off the ride, I was feeling queasy in my stomach.
“How's she doing?" Draco asked as he stepped up to the desk.
“Hang on a second Charlie," she answered. She turned back to the fireplace, where green flames were still burning. “Get out here!" She yelled into the flames. At her words, the green flames flickered and started to go out. “Oh, no you don't!"
“Excuse me? Since when do you care if I make a scene in public?" She snapped at me.
“Yes I am. What's going on?" I asked, shutting the water off and grabbing some paper towels.
Once we made it to Mother's study, it dawned on me that he really would be moving out of the Manor. Harry spoke quickly to Mother, telling her of his plan to leave. “Just know that you will always have a home here, should you need it," she said, pulling him into a big hug.
“Draco, if you want to go today before you lose your nerve, we can actually go today."
~~~~~
“I call riding in Harry's car," I said, grinning.
She led me into the bar and through the building to the bartop. I chose a seat at the very end of the bar, knowing I would be able to watch Harry better. Connie chose to sit next to me, not that I minded. There were two ladies behind the bar, one that was younger and didn't seem to know much about being a bartender. As the other lady began to pour a drink for Connie, the younger one stepped up in front of me.
We stood there staring into the window for a moment. “Harry, are you telling me that you dated a Muggle?" I asked, turning to look at him.
“No, I'll talk to Draco. You still have a hard time controlling your temper around him," I said. I pushed away from the table and stood up. I took a breath before I made my way towards Chase and Draco.
“Seriously, Ron? Can't you ever stop thinking about food?" I asked as Harry dropped his arms and grabbed my hand instead. Ron shook his head as Harry led me over to the table where the two cakes sat. On the icing of the vanilla cake, a green serpent was slithering around the words ´Happy birthday Draco'. As I approached the table, the 27 candles on the banana cake burst into life, one flame at a time.
I flinched at his use of my last name. “Since when am I Potter to you lately?" I asked him.
“I would rather eat in here. I don't feel like being around the others today."
“Draco, you never should have asked me if I'd be okay with you being with someone else. But I never should have told you that it was alright either. You know how I feel about you."
“God Harry, this is so good," I said. My breathing labored.
“No."
“Harry, you probably won't believe this, but I heard him complaining to Ginny that you won't get back together with him," Hermione said.
I turned my back to the mirror, refusing to believe myself. I knew that the words my reflection was saying were completely true. I raised my hand and played with the dragon around my neck. “How can you say that? We don't know what love is," I growled, before turning around to face the mirror again.
“You can't deny it Draco. I saw it in Ron's head and I saw it in Blaise's head. I can't understand why you would do this," he said. His voice was low and I saw the tears begin to fall from his eyes.
I chuckled at him. I continued to follow behind Ron's car, Draco and I making little jokes about how Hermione would react to our relationship.
I thought.
She nodded and walked away. We sipped at our drinks in silence. I couldn't seem to take my eyes off of him. I watched as his tongue slipped out to catch a drop of his drink as it slid down his lip. I I swallowed, hard.
I sighed as I opened the stove to check on the chicken I was making. This dinner was supposed to be special; it was about a week before our seven month anniversary.
I wasn't sure how long I sat there staring at the floor, but suddenly I heard a knock on the door. “Harry? Harry let me in please," Ron's voice came through the door. I was shocked, but I got up and pulled the door open.
“Hermione, I was not obsessed with Draco. I was merely trying to prove that he was up to something. And I was right after all," I said, turning to face her.
“Yeah, Mr. Potter got Firewhisky spilled on him and I was trying to help him. As for my friends, we had an argument and I told them that they better not be at this table when I came back."
Hermione was still laying on the couch, just watching the flames dance in the fireplace. She turned her head at my approach.
“Oh, God, Harry! Don't stop, please don't stop," I begged him. His mouth felt so good. I felt my body begin to tighten. “Harry, I'm gonna cum," I warned him. In answer to that, he tightened his mouth and sucked harder. I moaned, thrusting my hips up as I released into his mouth. I felt him swallow several times. He pulled himself away from my dick and kissed his way up my body like I had done to him. When he reached my lips, he kissed me more gently than he had all night. I could taste myself on his tongue. We broke away, both of us breathing heavy.
He spun around to face me. “You don't get it, do you? This is the second time that I've almost died because of you. The first of course was ten years, and it was a direct result of a curse. This time it was because of my actions based on the pain you caused me."
In answer, I thrust my hips forward, rubbing my hardening erection against his stomach. Harry swore colorfully and with a whispered spell, he banished our clothes, leaving us both completely naked where he had me pinned against the wall. His hands moved from my arse to my hips instead. I thrust forward again, eliciting a moan from Harry's throat.
“That's ridiculous Harry. I told you last night that I'm not cheating on you."
I walked over to my sofa and sat down on the soft black leather, my damp hair dripping down my back. A slightly cold breeze slid across the back of my neck. I shivered, raising my hand towards the fireplace in front of me. “
“Well, congratulations. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that they ended up together. Back in Hogwarts, I think it was obvious to anyone but them that they were both in love with each other. I guess I'll talk to you later Harry," Draco said. He stepped around me and started down the hall.
I heard him, but I really wasn't listening to him. My gaze had fallen to his lips. Before I realized quite what I was doing, I leaned up, slid my arm around his neck and pressed my lips to his. My left hand was still on his hip, and I used it to pull him closer. I pulled my mouth away, looked him right in the eye, and pressed my lips against his for the second time.
He came around the corner and froze, looking at the romantic setting of the room. “Oh, honey, I'm so sorry I'm late. There was a dragon hatching today. Seven eggs hatched and three of them were Hungarian Horntails. I'm sure you remember how dangerous the Horntails can be."
. I growled in my head.
“We should go upstairs," Draco said.
“Too bad. You said you wanted to apologize to him and that's long overdue in my opinion. You should have apologized to him the next day, not a week later."
I looked down at the table. “Look, Harry, I know I crossed the line in the bathroom. For some reason, I've wanted to kiss you almost since I sat down. I know you said you're in a relationship, but I couldn't help it. I don't want to ruin your relationship with him. It shouldn't have happened."
---------
“Come on. Let's get you sitting over on that bench," he said. He gently put his arm around my shoulders and led me over to a bench, a good distance from the ride. Harry sat me down so that my back was towards the ride, then he sat down beside me. I leaned forward and put my head between my knees, breathing slowly in and out, trying to ease the nausea. Harry's hand began making small circles across my shoulders, and I was suddenly grateful for the small bit of comfort he was offering.
“I don't know what you're talking about," Harry answered. He didn't look up from his book.
“You know I'm gay?" I asked.
She surprised me by asking, “Should I order one cake or two?"
When Dean finished casting his spells, he summoned the parchment and read over it. “Well, Harry, all these tests came back normal. There is one more test I can run, and I'll need you to remove your robes and your shirt and lay back on the exam bed," he said.
Kyle turned back to Harry. “What about you Harry? What are you going to have?" Kyle asked eagerly.
“Shut up, Marcus!" Charlie snapped.
“Trying to break your own rules there, Draco?" Harry asked, chuckling.
This chapter contains EXPLICIT content. If you don't want to read it, kindly skip the last section of the chapter.
“What's so funny?" I asked as I sat down.
Harry chuckled. “Oh, before I forget, I have something for you," he said. He leaned across the car and opened his glove compartment. Without taking his eyes off the road, he reached into the glove compartment and pulled out a sealed scroll. He dropped the scroll into my lap and straightened up in his seat, placing his hand back on the steering wheel.
“No. I know the spell to activate it. Ever since I became a Healer, I work here on occasion," Draco answered. He waved his wand and the lift shot upwards.
“Draco, how can you say that it shouldn't matter? No matter that it's in the past, you were abused by your own father!" Harry snapped.
“Excuse me Draco," Harry said. I slid out of the booth and Harry slid out as well. Without a word, he made his way to the men's room. I noticed his slight limp and the throbbing in my hip started all over again.
“The last thing they did was bring in a young boy who had a couple wand burns on his skin from the punishment his foster mother did to him. They said if I could help him, I'd have a place in the hospital."
When I opened my eyes, I was standing in the bedroom, looking down at the Pensieve. Rage blossomed in my stomach as I thought about what I had just seen. I wanted to find Blaise and hit him with every curse and hex that I could. I took several deep breaths, trying to get control of my temper before my magic could get out of hand.
I walked over to my bed and picked up my trousers. I had just pulled them up to my waist and was fastening them, when a knock sounded on my door. “Mr. Potter, you have a visitor," called the voice of the innkeeper, Tom.
“If you really want a buzz, you should do what I do. I get Butterbeer mixed with Firewhisky. After a few of them, you won't be able to walk straight."
“Okay, let's do this before I have a chance to change my mind," Pansy said suddenly.
“Thanks Hermione. I don't know why you're being nice to me, but I appreciate it," I said. I unfolded my legs and stood up, stretching out my muscles. When Hermione stood up, I wrapped her in my arms once more. “I don't know what I did to deserve your help."
“Feel better?" I asked as he took another drag from his cigarette. He nodded.
“Well, the least you can do is introduce us to him," Steve whined.
“What just happened?" Harry asked looking at me.
“I'm going to pretend that you didn't just call Ron ´Weasel' again, not once but twice. I honestly can't wait for your birthday. I have something special in mind." With that, Harry picked his book back up.
“I'm sure I could go back to Dean and Seamus' place, or even Neville and Luna's place. As long as I'm not avoiding you like I did before, I'll have a place to stay."
“Well, I want to go faster. Can I?" I asked him.
“Rainforest Falls? I've actually been there," I said, blushing slightly when he turned to glance at me.
“If you really want the truth, Potter, you're asking the wrong person. We both know that Charlie won't tell you the truth, because if he told the truth, we wouldn't be in this situation."
“Oh, I was just thinking. I need to get ahold of Charlie about getting the rest of my things."
“Here Harry," I said, placing the glasses in his hand. He shoved them onto his face. He seemed startled when I came into focus.
“Look, I know my brother. He just needs some time to wrap his brain around the idea. He'll come around, Harry."
I reached out my hands and I caught the bottom of his shirt and tugged it upwards. He raised his arms and let me pull his shirt completely off. I dropped it carelessly behind me. Now we were both shirtless and he pulled me back to his lips. This kiss was hungry, his mouth moving urgently against mine. I parted my lips and he slid his tongue in. I trailed my hands over his skin, sliding them down his chest and up across his back. I broke the kiss again, and pushed him backwards on my bed.
I forced myself away from him. I brought my hand up and slapped him hard across his cheek. The force of my blow knocked him away from me. He sprawled across the floor, glaring up at me. Draco came running at the sound of flesh striking flesh, clearly worried about me. I watched him pause in the doorway.
“Harry, I think we need to take you to St. Mungo's today. This is the fifth day in a row that I've found you with your head on the edge of the toilet," he said when I finished puking.
“Are you cheating on me Charlie?" I asked, looking down at the floor. His silverware clattered against his plate.
“Why do you automatically get to ride with him? Just 'cause he is your ex?" Pansy asked, glaring at me.
“You know what, I will take my usual tonight. Put it on my tab," I said with a grin.
Suddenly, the sound of flames bursting to life echoed through the apartment and we looked towards the living room. I could see a green glow. We both stood and made our way into the living room, Charlie's wand in his hand. We entered the living room just as Ginny emerged from the fireplace.
Without a word, we began to eat. As I was helping myself to some tea, Draco reached over and brushed my hair away from my face. I turned my head to look at him. He gave me a big grin, then he leaned forward and pressed his lips to mine. He pulled away and turned back to his breakfast. I chuckled and went back to pouring my tea.
“Yes, I would like to return to the lobby."
He grabbed my hand and gently tugged me out the doors. He snapped his fingers and the doors swung shut behind us. Still holding my hand, he began to make his way down the hall. When we reached my room, I released his hand and disappeared into my room to grab my jacket. As I came back out, I found Harry leaning against the wall next to my doors. He smiled at me and reached for my hand again. When I threaded my fingers through his, he tugged me into his arms. He dropped a soft kiss to my lips and apparated us into the garage.
Draco stared at me as we entered the room. “Well, in that case, I'd love to go to lunch with you. Does tomorrow work for you?"
I turned around and walked back into the bowling alley, leaving Draco staring after me with a look of bewilderment on his face.
“Yes, I really slept with him. As to losing my mind; probably."
“Oh, hey Hermione. Did you need something?" Draco asked, turning his head at my approach.
“Okay, so that we don't arrive at the same time, I'll floo over first. Give it about ten minutes, and apparate to the Burrow. Is that okay with you?" Charlie asked. I nodded. He bent slightly and placed a kiss to my cheek. He straightened up and turned towards the fireplace. He took a pinch of floo powder from the pot on the mantle and threw it into the empty fireplace. Green flames erupted instantly. Charlie stepped into the flames and shouted ´the Burrow'. He was gone in the blink of an eye.
I moved farther into the room and sat down on the sofa. I pulled out my pack of cigarettes and my lighter. I calmly lit a cigarette and took a drag from it. I slowly exhaled the smoke from my throat before I spoke again. “Draco, what do you want from me? I've apologized for what happened at your party. What more can I do?"
----------
," I said. Flames burst into existence, filling my room with heat and a soft glow. I snapped my fingers, summoning a soft red lap blanket from the foot of my bed. Narcissa had given me the blanket shortly after I had moved in.
“Well, he wanted to work here, and when I offered him a job, he never showed up. Look, I'd like to help you guys out, but I've not seen Harry since last Tuesday," Seamus said. He leaned back in his chair and propped his feet on the desk in front of him.
“Sure thing, Harry," she said. She held out her arm to me. I glanced at Harry for a moment, before I slid my arm through hers. Before she could lead me away, Harry raised his hand and caught my chin. He leaned down and kissed me, earning a few whistles from the guys. He pulled away with a grin.
Acting on impulse, I ran my tongue over the burn. I began to place nibbling kisses across his collarbone and down his chest. I kissed my way further down his body, crawling under the blanket that still covered his waist. As I began to place kisses along his hips, a strong hand tangled in my hair, while the other hand pulled the blanket away. I looked up. Charlie was starting down at me, his blue eyes shining.
I poured the tea, adding sugar to my mug. I glanced up at him and he nodded. I added sugar to his and then added a splash of cream to both mugs. I tapped them both with my wand to stir the tea. I passed one mug to him. He plucked it off the table and took a sip.
Our night had gotten pretty heated after I was in his room. One thing stuck in my memory; Harry closing the door with magic, but not with his wand. Our lips had been locked together and Harry had tumbled us onto his bed, with him landing on top of me. He had broken our kiss and had turned his attention to my neck, biting gently, and kissing his way to my ear. I had turned my head to give him more access to my skin, and saw that the door was wide open. I had whispered to him about the door, and he raised his hand and the door swung shut and I heard the lock click. Last night had lasted longer than our first night had.
I didn't get a chance to respond, for Harry withdrew from me, before thrusting back in quickly. I moaned loudly. He did it again, striking my prostate easily. My eyes threatened to roll back into my head at the pleasure that rolled through me. Harry set up a rhythm, going slow and steady, but that pace didn't last long. As I started thrusting my hips backwards into him, Harry started thrusting into me harder and faster. It wasn't long before he was reaching under me and wrapping his hand around my shaft. He moved his hand in rhythm to his thrusts. I shuddered at the contact as Harry used his thumb to spread the precum leaking from my tip.
“Good night, Draco," I said. Shortly afterwards, his breathing became slow and deep. His body around me became heavier as he drifted off to sleep. I pressed a kiss to the top of his head, before I let myself drift off to join him in sleep.
“Hello Narcissa. Draco told me that you have asked about me," I said.
“I'll tell you about it later. Right now, where did he go?" Kingsley asked her.
“He got slapped because that bastard kissed me. He forced the kiss on my lips, so I slapped him."
He sighed and placed his guitar on the grass beside him. “I've been working on it all day, trying to put exactly what I feel into words."
“Was all that real?" I asked him.
Before Draco could respond, the lift came to a halt and the door opened. We stepped out of the lift and began to make our way to the Apparation room. “Please tell me that it wasn't because we slept together," he said.
He caught my right wrist and pressed his palm against mine. For the third time, I felt his magic work its way through my skin. The stinging sensation from where I had slapped Charlie, slowly began to dissipate.
Ron's eyes briefly slid down his menu. “I'll have the turkey club on rye, with a side of cheesy bacon soup," he said.
“Good night, Draco," he replied.  He pressed a kiss to my forehead. We drifted off in silence.
“No, not at all, Harry. It was just a surprise to hear it."
“How about we tell you later when Hermione's around? That way we don't have to repeat ourselves," I said.
“You would seriously cheat? Just because he's pushing you away for a couple of weeks, it shouldn't come to throwing away a relationship that's lasted almost seven months. Harry, think this through," I said. I wanted him to understand what would happen if we went through with this.
“Damn it, Draco! Stop talking like that! You say that no one can love you; well I do damn it!" Harry snapped at me.
----------
“I was thinking about how they don't know about us. To be honest, I'm tired of hiding it from them, especially Ron."
He looked at me, confused for a moment before I straddled his lap. I kissed him again, tangling my fingers into his black hair. I slipped my tongue into his mouth. Once again, our tongues danced against each other. I felt his hands at my waist. He slid his hands underneath the bottom of my shirt and ran them up my back. The higher up his hands went, the higher up my shirt went, until we had to part from our kiss so he could pull the shirt over my head. He threw it somewhere, but I didn't see where it landed.
“Alright I'll be back in a few minutes," Charlie said, before he disappeared into the kitchen.
I kept my eyes closed, taking several deep breaths. I slowly opened my eyes, blinking as the green flames disappeared from the fireplace. I turned my head to look towards the bed. Draco was sitting there with trays of food sitting on the end of the bed.
“Draco, I always want you. Since today is your birthday, you have a choice...You can Top me and set the pace of our love making for however fast or slow you want, or you can Bottom and this will be done at my pace."
Draco took a sip of his tea before he answered. “Occasionally, but the staff there doesn't completely trust me. I am the son of a well known Death Eater. Hell, I was a Death Eater myself." He lowered his head to his chest.
“Yes. I don't think you understand how much I've missed this; not just the sex, even though that's usually pretty awesome, but just waking up with you in my arms."
“Brown," Ron said. He sat down on the other side of Hermione's bed and she leaned against him. I smiled at the pair of them, then turned my attention back to the little girl in my arms. I raised my hand and gently touched her little cheek with my finger. The skin was so soft.
Kingsley glanced at the Aurors, then looked at me, then rose to his feet. With a wave of his hand, he motioned me to follow. I glanced at Harry for a moment before rising to my feet and following the other three out of the room. Kingsley turned right down a small hallway and ushered us through another door. We were now in the small room behind the two-way mirror, watching and listening to the conversation between Harry and Father.
I placed my breakfast tray aside, removed the blanket from my lap, and stood up. Since I wasn't eating anyway, there was no point in delaying visiting Narcissa like she asked me to. I twisted on the spot and apparated outside the door of her study. I took a breath, before knocking on the door. “Come on in, Harry," I heard her call out.
I sat there, kinda stunned. His eyes never left mine as he picked up a fry from his platter. He brought it to his mouth and slowly, and deliberately, licked the ketchup from it. I squirmed in my seat, before I slid from the booth and quickly sat down next to him. “Tease," I hissed under my breath.
I felt my cheeks heat as a blush began to spread. As I continued to eat, I did my best not to think about the kiss that Charlie and I had shared this morning.
“Oh, FUCK!! Fuck Draco!! I'm gonna cum!" He moaned. I glanced up at him; his face was flushed, his body was covered in sweat and he was trembling with the orgasm he was trying to hold back. I turned my attention back to what I doing. I licked the underside of his dick and sucked him to the back of my throat. He moaned, thrusting up as he released himself down my throat. I kept swallowing, feeling him soften in my hand.
“You seemed lost in thought when I came out of the bathroom. Something on your mind?" He asked, before taking a sip of his tea
“What are you talking about, Harry?"
“Hey, give that back Draco," he cried, reaching for the glass. Unfortunately, his hand missed and the full glass of Firewhisky spilled all over Harry's shirt. “Oooops, sharry, Harry," The words were slurred coming from Blaise's mouth. He couldn't stop giggling like a little girl.
“So, your okay with us?" I asked, gesturing between Draco and myself. Draco's hand was still on my thigh. I was still laughing softly.
With that, he finished his drink and slid out of the booth. He grabbed his jacket from the hook on the wall behind him. He pulled the jacket over his shoulders and headed for the door. He called out a goodbye to Marko and walked out the door.
“I'll have a bacon cheese burger with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and a side of fries," Harry replied. Again, Kyle seemed to write it down.
“Yes," he said, dropping his gaze away from me again.
~~~~~
“Relax Ron, we're all friends here," I said with a smirk.
Charlie groaned and buried his face in his hands. I took pity on him. “Draco, can you start taking my things to the Manor? I would like a moment to speak to Charlie," I said.
“You're going to have to explain that to me. If you were having an affair with him for three months while we were together, and you were still sleeping with me during that time, how can you be sure you didn't give me an STD?"
“Who works here?" I asked, looking through the glass. I followed his gaze and my eyes landed on a young man with honey brown hair. He was talking to people seated at a table.
He grabbed my shoulders and shoved me sideways. I fell against the end table next to the recliner. My right hip landed hard against the sharp corner of the table. I landed on the ground. I looked up at him, my hip throbbing.
“Hello, Minister Shacklebolt, Auror Robards and Auror Briggs," said the Auror behind the desk. She flipped her dark blonde curls over her shoulder and smiled warmly at us. The plaque on her desk read Linda Sanders.
“You honestly don't know what happened at my party?" I asked.
“What makes you ask?"
“Alright, I tried to warn you that you didn't want to hear this...Charlie and I have been sleeping together for almost three months. Every time you two would have a fight, he would come to me."
“Everything alright Harry?" Kingsley asked.
Harry emerged from my bathroom, his face freshly washed. My robe hung on him loosely. He crossed over to me. As he approached me, I noticed all the hickeys that I had left on his skin, four of them forming a “D" on his collarbone.
“Hangover potions. Drink two before consuming alcohol and you won't have any side effects," he said. Pansy was nodding her head with every word. Her smile was smug.
"Yeah, I have one," I said reluctantly. I strolled over to my trunk and knelt on the floor next to it. I opened the lid reached in and caught the edge of my invisibility cloak. I shoved the cloak aside and pulled out the shallow basin covered in ancient runes. I slowly rose to my feet with the Pensieve in both hands. I moved over to my bureau and placed the Pensieve on top.
As soon as the gates came into view, Draco pulled out his wand. He aimed it at the gates and they swung open easily. I pulled through the gates and up the pathway. “Follow the pathway around the Manor. There's actually an underground garage around the back," Draco said when the front doors came into view.
Before I could respond, Draco spoke again. “Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if you got it from Flint. He never could keep it in his pants."
“No," they both answered. They still stood by the door.
We made our way to the exit, Harry's arms draped across mine and Pansy's shoulders like he didn't have a care in the world. I tried not to focus on how good it felt to have his arm around me, but I couldn't help the little tingle I felt in my stomach. After we were outside the gates, Harry dropped his arm from my shoulders and led Pansy in the direction of the vehicles. The two of them were whispering to each other before Harry threw his head back and laughed. They climbed into the Lamborghini and the rest of us climbed into the Tahoe. In just minutes, we were pulling out of the parking lot.
I began moving both fingers in and out of him, twisting my wrist as I did. Harry moaned, his head thrashing back and forth on the pillows. I leaned forward and pressed a kiss against his collarbone He growled softly, his hand still slowly spreading lube around my shaft.
I made my way over to the desk. “Excuse me, but is there an Apparation point here? I really don't like using floo powder."
Carlos let his eyes travel over me briefly, before turning his attention back to Harry. “Well, he's a lot better looking than that red head that you were dating," he said before crushing out his cigarette, and heading back into the bar.
“It didn't used to bother you if I was already in bed when you got home. You would still come to bed and pull me into your arms. Now, I don't even get that. It hurts to say this, but I really miss you."
“Did you forget that he plays the guitar?" Neville asked, arching an eyebrow.
“Alright, first we need to stop at Gringotts so I can exchange Wizard money and get the Muggle money we need, then we'll apparate to King's Cross station; that's where my car will be. Hermione did you manage to get ahold of that rental car place?" Harry asked.
Hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for the next chapter, it will be ready as soon as possible.
“Well look at that; the Savior loves a Death Eater. There's a nice headline for the Prophet. Now, why don't you run along and find that gay person that dares to call himself my son and get out of here? Merlin knows that I won't miss him when your gone," Father sneered.
As soon as Jolene and I had finished the last of the food on our plates, the two trays rose into the air and drifted towards the kitchen. A moment later, the Weasley family began to emerge from the kitchen. I stood up so Ron could take my place next to Hermione.
Ron pulled out the chair across the table from me and sat down. He looked between me and Draco and back again. “Really, Harry? There wasn't any other guy that you wanted to be with? You had to pick
“And Draco's now the second one to puke. What a way to ruin the day," Pansy complained from somewhere behind me.
“I would rather go to sleep. I feel kinda worn out. Do you have a Dreamless Sleep Potion anywhere?"
We sat there and talked about a bunch of different subjects. Harry and Blaise started a conversation about what they missed from Hogwarts. No surprise to me that Harry missed Quidditch the most. Pansy rolled her eyes at that, then launched into a tirade about why she had always hated Quidditch.
I leaned forward and took his lips as he erupted in my hand and across his stomach. Feeling his muscles clench around my dick brought me to my own release. I groaned deep in my throat as I released my cum inside his body. I thrust a few more times before I collapsed against him.
“Give us a bit, Kyle. Draco's never been here before."
“I'll kill him!" Ron snarled.
“Oh yes. Yes please, faster."
---------
I thought to myself, letting my eyes travel over his sleeping form. My eyes lingered on the hickeys that marked his skin. I smiled, knowing that I had once again marked him with my little “D" shaped hickey, and I could see it on the side of his neck.
“No. But how about we call it quits here at the amusement park and just go to the arcade sooner than we planned?" Harry asked.
“Yeah, and I want to play that racing game again. It was kinda fun," Theo added.
“What would ever make you ask a question like that?" He asked me.
I quickly moved and blocked the door. He paused. “You're not going anywhere Charlie. We're not done talking about this," I said.
