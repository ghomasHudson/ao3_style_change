They snog and grope their way up to the teachers’ table, leaving a trail of discarded clothes behind them. Draco flashes a predatory grin when he roughly pushes Potter into Minerva’s chair. He climbs into Potter’s lap and straddles him, his hands holding the back of the chair and his hips making slow, rolling motions as he rubs their pricks together. Potter moans into Draco’s neck, his hands kneading Draco’s arse. They grind against each other, hot, hard and heavy, the slick slide of their bodies driving their lust to new heights.
A nearby clang distracts Harry, and they both turn towards the kitchen, which is bustling with the lunch rush. The roaring stoves and the instructions hollered back-and-forth between the workers seem to have shaken Malfoy back into his senses.
Harry's mind is spinning. "So I'm... I'm hurting you, in the long run? I make you happy, but I'm making things worse too, aren't I?" Helpless, he shuffles away from Draco, until he's kneeling on the opposite side of the bed, palms clenched on his thighs. "Then it can't work like this," he mutters, eyes dull and downcast.
Anything can happen now, and that tantalising whisper of possibility and promise thrills and chills Draco at the same time.
"Really? That's brilliant!" Harry exclaims in delight. Last year, he'd managed to rope Oliver in to coach the older kids in between seasons of professional coaching with Puddlemere United, with Harry taking back the reins when Oliver returned to Puddlemere.
Malfoy places the bowl back on the drawer and presses his lips against Harry's neck, kissing a path down the side of his neck, his hot puffs of breath sending thrills down his spine.
The castle appeared to encourage them. They were taking an adrenaline-filled risk one afternoon; pushed up against a wall and groping each other senseless in a corridor near the One-Eyed Witch Passage. There were noises coming from approaching students, but before they had the presence of mind to do anything, there was the sensation of a raw egg cracked onto their heads, enveloped by the castle’s Disillusionment charm. They stood, frozen, their wide eyes tracking the students as they walked past, oblivious to the fact that two of their teachers had their pricks out.
Instead, Harry chuckles when Ron finishes his tale. He takes a long swig of beer, licking away the foam on his upper lip. Harry is about to speak, when Hermione glances behind him, frowns, and then gasps, covering her mouth with a hand.
Harry kisses Draco’s cheek and holds him tight. "I love you too," he says.
Harry swallows in disbelief and arousal, continuing.
Draco takes advantage of the increased space between their bodies to use his left hand to wank Potter properly while two fingers of his right hand is still buried in Potter's arse. He's not really finger-fucking him, just moving them in and out an inch, committing to memory which spots make Potter's cock harder. Draco's mouth is busy working Potter's balls — damn, he's really sensitive here. With every flick of his tongue, Potter makes a delicious mewling sound.
"Listen to yourself, Draco! You shelter him in the rain and then give him chocolate, and then what, years of enmity gone, just like that?" Pansy snaps her fingers in his face.
Without any warning, Potter drapes his arm over Draco's shoulders.
“Goodnight, Potter.”
"Yes. Only you. Inside me." Malfoy smiles, the affection shining in his eyes making Harry's heart expand with emotion. "No one else."
Unfazed, Greengrass extends her hand. "Pleased to meet you, Mr Potter."
"How about you do Harry's place?”
"Why are you reading-" Draco starts, but Pansy shakes him hard by the arm.
Harry blinks.
"Gonna, I'm gonna,
The colour of the water is much lighter than its usual dark greenish tinge, indicating that sunlight is streaming through the lake. This is a welcome departure from recent days — late October brings with it chilly weather, a perpetual pounding of rain on castle windows. He’s been feeling cooped up lately, exacerbated by the flurry of colds inflicting both faculty and students. Perhaps today is a good day to head outdoors and bask in the sunshine with a book, before breakfast and another session of marking.
"Yeah. Wear your dark blue trousers for the Leaving Ball, the ones that Hermione likes so much," Harry says in an attempt at humour, but Ron's smile is wan.
. Like your cologne and your natural scent..." Harry had trailed off to stare at Draco with eyes wide in surprise and wonder. "You still hug it! You still hug it to sleep! That's why whenever I visit the Manor you make some excuse to disappear before I'm allowed to enter your room! To hide the evidence!" He crooned in delight and admired the doll again. "Well, I don't think my eyes are that close together, but well... it's rather flattering to know that you have a Harry Potter doll."
A new, piping-hot tray of Shepherd's pie comes sailing in from the kitchen, nestling itself into place. Malfoy looks intently at the pie, before nodding and plonking the ladle into it. When Harry catches his eye and chooses the roast chicken too, Malfoy merely arches a brow at him.
Potter looks beautifully conflicted. “I should, yeah?”
But he can't stop now, not when he's so close.
“I’m glad I got a lot more than treacle tart out of this,” Potter says, plucking the napkin from Draco’s hands and putting it away. He turns out the lights, and they settle into bed.
“Jason and I,” Malfoy corrects gently.
He steps back and looks at Malfoy, once cool, calm and collected, now reduced to a fucking hot mess of arousal and longing, because of
“Right,” Harry says eventually, wiping his palms on the thighs of his jeans. There’s really no subtle way to go about this. “I’d like to… er… pursue Malfoy.”
"Nope, that's not how it works." Charlie grins. "And you should talk, being one yourself, years ago. Does it actually count if you didn’t finish the Academy proper?" He pauses, then dismisses the question. "Well, you're here now, and you're gonna do your usual terrorising of the first-years."
"I..." Harry's hand falters and his face grows warm. "Not now..." He ducks his head and gestures to his half-hard cock.
The air is electric with promise, crackling with potential.
— so Potter simply folds Draco up in his arms.
Something deep in his chest rumbles, voicing jealousy and displeasure, but Harry pushes it away. His eighth year feels like an eternity ago, and although he wouldn't go so far to say that he'd wish Malfoy the best, he hopes Malfoy can find someone who feels so strongly for him as much as Harry feels—
With every night comes a different narrative: of Harry taking him in various positions—
He looks down and rights the pitcher of water at once, cursing under his breath. Letting out a deep and drawn-out sigh, Harry puts his overflowing glass of water and the pitcher on the table and steps out of the small puddle on the floor. He winces at his damp sneakers and the uncomfortable feeling of his jeans plastered to his right thigh, but before he can cast a drying charm, Oliver Wood appears in the entrance of the kitchen.
The silence is rich with expectation.
Draco frowns at the television screen, his hand pausing its rustling in the popcorn bowl. Even though it's not Draco's first time watching television, he still doesn't understand how Muggles can spend hours in front of this little box watching mind-numbingly boring shows.
" Kingsley says around a grin, while Parvati tries very hard not to burst out laughing.
It feels different this time round, because Harry's usually watching at the bar whenever Malfoy's dancing, and fuck, it shouldn't even be a surprise that Malfoy looks even better dancing up close. Harry licks his lips hungrily.
how to cook. I thought we would be going out. I should have brought something!"
Draco had tried to suck it, couldn't wait to get his mouth around it, but only managed a few cursory licks before Harry growled and shoved him away. Draco could only watch, his mind yet to keep up with this sudden turn of events but his cock stirring as Harry tore off his own clothes.
Hopefully he's hatching a plan to help Harry get his tart.
An image of Malfoy and him holding hands and sharing an umbrella while they splash happily about in rain puddles makes Harry blush.
He opens his textbook and begins to read.
It's over; the entire exchange had been as passionless and precise as a piece of history homework.
"Some days I look at it before I sleep, wishing that I'd see this, see
To focus on anything but Harry, he gazes around the room. Gone are any traces of their activities: the bedside dresser and the lamp have been repaired and replaced to their rightful position, the pillows are gathered on the bed, the window is gleaming, with the accompanying curtains repaired and reunited with their holders. Draco's clothes are folded on a chair with his multiple tubes and jars of lube and wand placed on the top. With nowhere else to go, his eyes finally rest on Harry, who is fully dressed and fiddling with the wrapper of the eclair.
"You'll fight me every step of the way."
And that's why Draco is sitting on the train with a sore arse and an exhausted Potter in his arms. Potter shifts in his seat, makes an adorable snuffling sound and nuzzles his head against Draco. He kisses Draco's neck, and with his arms still wrapped around Draco's middle, squints at the scenery (he isn’t wearing his glasses).
Lucius Malfoy was wearing dark blue Muggle jeans and a black collared shirt, his long blond hair hanging loosely around his shoulders. Narcissa Malfoy was dressed in a cheery sunflower-yellow sleeveless dress that accentuated her slim figure, complementing her hair, which was styled in an elegant chignon.
Malfoy's grip tightens on the bowl.
“Oh, that’s not important. Thank you, thank you!” Draco exclaims, delighted. He goes at once to his study to keep the book. There’s the crackle of the Floo, and Draco’s heart leaps. That should be Harry and Weasley, back from the Ministry. Enjoying a nice dinner with Harry would make it a perfect birthday. He’s barely seen him for the past three weeks, what with the high-profile case they’ve been working on.
The recorder becomes silent; the only sounds in the room are Harry's desperate groans while he continues to stroke himself.
Draco isn't prepared for this towering, sweeping wave of nostalgia and loss. Even though it feels like a lifetime ago, he will never forget the suffocating pain and fury as he grieved for his loved ones; those who were dead, missing and those who fled the country, leaving him all alone—
Harry's heart twinges.
Harry sucks in a breath and goes very still, his body tensing. Malfoy trails off, his fingers faltering on his guitar. His eyes are round with shock, his smile dimming. They stare at each other, and Harry cringes when people turn back to glance at him. Malfoy shakes himself out of his stupor, and with his gaze still locked on Harry, he continues singing without his guitar, his whisper trembling.
In return, Harry nips at Malfoy's thumb and steps back.
Harry smiles at Rose, and then gazes up at Draco.
Harry swallows, and she continues.
"I don't mind if Potter's going to work his way down my body."
Potter chuckles. “But I’m already here in your bed. You gonna kick me out now?” He flashes Draco a cheeky grin and a wink. “Especially if I do
New-found confidence blossoms in Harry, galvanising him into action. Harry starts to dance; small movements at first to warm up — gentle shoulder and hip rolls, but that's enough to reclaim the flagging attention of the crowd. The presenter shouts his name and that only emboldens Harry even more — he snaps his fingers, throws his arms high up in the air, slightly bends his knees to exaggerate his rolling hips as they move in smooth circles to the beat of the music. Harry traces his fingers down the side of his face... his throat... right in the middle of his chest, his wandering fingers teasing the crowd by pushing apart half of his shirt, revealing the left side of his bare chest and shoulder — God, Harry can hardly believe that he has it in him to drive the audience
Potter huffs, and they place their orders — a steak for him and a Chicken Cordon Bleu for Draco.
Draco’s stomach swoops with panic, and he turns to face Hermione.
"It's Potter. It's always all or nothing with him," Theo says, taking another cushion and tucking it under his head as he leans back against the seat of the sofa. He closes his eyes. They lapse into a companionable silence.
Harry casts a privacy charm, aware of the cubicles around them. Theo raises his eyebrows at the spell, but says nothing. Harry chooses his next words carefully. "If one were to... get on his good side, what does one have to do?"
"Yeah, was thinking about... um. Your treacle tart," Harry hedges, refusing to meet Draco's curious gaze.
Dreamless Sleep.
Harry agrees with her, but he's not too worried — Pork Chop is a crafty and smart fire-breathing Ashwinder that is able to camouflage, she's more than capable of taking care of herself.
"A deal he rejected again, I assume."
They kiss — slowly, softly, luxuriously — in the middle of the Quidditch pitch, Draco’s fingers curling against Potter’s chest and Potter sighing into Draco’s mouth. Every nerve ending in Draco’s body sags in relief when the kiss deepens, as if they’ve been watching and waiting for Potter to breathe life into him.
With that parting shot, Draco turns sharply on his heel and storms to their bedroom. He slams the door closed behind him.
She takes Malfoy's hand and presses the ring into his palm, her nails digging hard into Malfoy’s skin and leaving crescent-shaped indents. She gazes at him, her tone softening. "I love you, Draco. I know you do, too, in your own way, but we can’t continue like this.” She lets out a soft, broken sound of defeat. “I’m done.”
Harry rests his left hand on the railing in front of him, and Draco shifts, placing his own hand on top of Harry's. Maybe it's not too mad to imagine a red thread, smooth and untangled, looping snugly around their last fingers and trailing back to their hearts.
"Worst of all, I don't understand why it's so bloody difficult to find a proper cup of—"
Malfoy moans around his prick, and Harry sucks harder.
He impulsively punches the wall behind him for good measure, regretting it the moment pain lances across his knuckles.
"Stop being a git," Potter says good-naturedly and pats the space on the bench beside him. "It's nice and quiet here."
“I’m sorry, Headmistress,” Potter says in a small voice.
It's fucking heaven, having every inch engulfed by the exquisite lushness and warmth of Malfoy's mouth, the head of his cock hitting the back of Malfoy's throat with every small push of his hips. The air is heavy with Harry's pants and Malfoy's moans—he knows how much Harry likes it loud. Malfoy looks so damn good giving head—tousled blond hair, hollowed-out cheeks and half-lidded eyes smoky with sex and seduction. His satin-soft lips wrap around Harry's prick, tongue teasing him with every slow drag on his shaft, slick with pre-come and saliva.
"Draco, could you just... stop thinking about everything that could go wrong? There are so many things that could go right, so, so right, if you'd only give it a chance," Potter says, taking Draco's hand into his. He takes a deep breath and stares into Draco's eyes, his gaze intense and serious, and the line of his jaw strong. "I just have one question for you: do you want to be with me? That's all I need to know."
They've been walking on eggshells about this, but Harry needs to wrest it out into the open, to voice out his worries and concern, because if he doesn't, then who would?
This could end really well or horribly, and Draco has a feeling it's going to be the latter.
He feels, rather than hears, the hitch in Malfoy's breath.
Harry had been watching Malfoy's reaction — for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, something had frozen in Malfoy's face — before smoothing over.
Draco gets up and winces when he feels a tell-tale soreness in his lower body. He pads to the bathroom to take a leak, brush his teeth (Potter's left a spare toothbrush, how thoughtful) and pulls on his clothes from last night — his white shirt and black underwear. He looks in the mirror, finger-combs his hair and tries on a smirk for size.
“No.” Flustered, Malfoy glances away to the horse-drawn carriage clomping on the pathway, his blush deepening. He puts his guitar down on its case, grabs his bubble tea and takes a long drink from it. Harry pulls his own bubble tea towards him, slurping up the tapioca pearls and chewing on them. He shifts into the shade of the large tree and leans on its trunk, stretching his legs out. There’s a young boy flying a kite, shouting joyfully as he dashes across the grass in front of them, his mother chasing after him.
It's Harry's first sketch of Draco, in Mona's.
!" Harry gasps, arching his back when Draco lifts his upper body up. He holds his arms taut and plants his fists on the bed. He starts to thrust, his hips undulating and his legs bracketing Harry's spread legs.
Harry hears Malfoy's footsteps before he sees him.
Three days have passed since the Night of the Failed Seduction; Malfoy didn't show up for work the first two nights, presumably to take care of his mother. Just half an hour ago, when Harry had made eye contact with Malfoy at the bar, the other man had looked away pointedly.
is the one acting like a complete potato.
A question hangs in the air, teasing the both of them:
Draco wouldn't mind falling asleep to Harry's voice detailing each and every one of his virtues — oh, he wouldn't mind that at all.
, is it? Draco darts a quick look at Potter, who seems unfazed by Draco's choice of words.
Harry opens his door, revealing Draco holding a pizza box from Joe's Pizza.
"I don't want you to get hurt," Hermione explains, her tone gentle. "You do have a... colourful history with him." She shares a look with Ron, a motion that irks Harry sometimes, but not now, as he's still buoyed up by the memory of Malfoy’s hands on him. Hermione smiles. "But we are glad that you're finally doing something about it, after all the pining."
Eventually, the conversation winds down, and Potter foots the bill. They leave the pub, a warm feeling enveloping Draco when Potter leads them away from the main thoroughfare of the streets, turning into a quieter road.
"May I assume that you approve of the lodgings?" Draco bites out, irritated. He glares at the back of Potter's head.
"Yes, and you'll get both tonight. But which one do you want first?"
"And everyone else?" Draco asks, arching a brow.
The snake vanishes in a column of black smoke.
Pork Chop hisses and slides off his chest. Draco props him to a sitting position, and hands him the glass. Potter drinks deeply from it.
Things are never going to be easy between them.
Hermione is smiling at a painting, and Harry joins her. He matches her grin — he loves it whenever his art makes people happy. “This is my favourite,” she says, her eyes still on the painting.
Harry stops in his tracks at the sight of Ron and Hermione sitting beneath a large tree, immersed in conversation. He doesn’t know if he should approach them in his frazzled state of mind. He's about to turn around, when Ron looks up and waves. Hermione twists around and matches Ron’s smile.
"Please suck my cock," Potter whispers, and Draco grins, knowing that he has the upper hand now. Until a mischievous gleam seeps into green eyes, and Potter says casually, "Unless it's too big for you."
He gestures to the box with an unsteady hand. "They don't spark joy. Certainly not. Instead, they make me sad, bittersweet. They remind me of the love I've lost. Should I throw them out?" He shakes his head, his words increasing in certainty. "No. Of course not. I salvaged these from the..." Draco's breath hitches. "The Manor, because they mean the most. Each item reminds me of the best of them. I remember them as my friend, my family, not by their faults, not how they were vilified by the media and immortalised in textbooks as war villains."
Harry eyes the ornate box in Draco's hands with curiosity.
"Father's mellowed out quite a bit after his heart attack," Draco says. "Besides, I suggested having the dinner outside, away from the Manor. I’m certain that would make it more comfortable."
They look at each other expectantly for a moment.
Harry sits down cautiously on the sofa.
A few more strokes, and Harry clasps his hand around Draco's wrist. Green eyes open.
Theo opens his drawer and retrieves two case files. He pushes them to Harry, his brown eyes sparkling slyly. "Last I've heard, I've got a report to finish up."
Draco pushes the dossier away, pulls his laptop towards him and retrieves a piece that he started writing last night. He skims the beginning and types out a new paragraph, relishing the busy taps of the keys under his fingertips. He learnt to work Muggle-style from Casey Smith, a Muggle-born colleague from the
Draco spotted Hermione sneaking glances at the aquamarine ring on her finger for the rest of the night.
"Go to bed? Yeah, it's really late. I'll come with, maybe I can sleep now."
"No," Draco murmurs, and he aches to wrap an arm around Potter. "No. Don't give up. I..."
There's sudden movement in Sin, and Harry's eyes swivel towards the bakery. A figure — Zabini — moves towards the entrance, flipping the sign on the door and turning his head back. A white-blond head emerges from the back of the shop. Harry watches through the windows as Malfoy throws his head back and laughs, his face looking wonderfully open. It's obvious that Malfoy, Zabini and Parkinson are unwinding after a hard day's work, like what Harry, Ron and Hermione are doing now.
Harry calls Draco, receiving a mechanical female voice in response.
Unlike how things used to be, all they have is time.
This is the same place where they had danced, but that scene felt like an eternity ago.
"Eh, Hermione and I think it's bound to happen sooner or later," Ron says dismissively, biting into his sausage. "Doesn't mean we're entirely alright with it, but you're our best friend. Would help if you'd stop denying it, to be honest."
...which go to shit eventually.
Harry opens his eyes. "Could be one of those membership things with flight miles, I reckon. Perhaps we could ask the counter staff about joining?" he suggests, wrinkling his nose in curiosity.
Malfoy stares at him. “We’re already neighbours,” he points out.
Somehow, Draco's hardly surprised. He slides the tray into the oven, and with Harry's guidance, sets the time and temperature.
Harry presses his hips closer to the counter to hide his growing erection.
"Me too," Malfoy replies, eyes fluttering closed when Harry starts to suck.
Malfoy holds his gaze for a long moment, his eyes contemplative in the weak silvery shimmer of moonlight. He dips his head and Harry feels Malfoy’s eyelashes grazing his jaw and warm puffs of breath on his neck...
A long pause ensues, in which absolutely nothing happens.
Harry reaches over to the small table to grab something. It appears to be four tickets. He places two tickets on the bench, and Draco looks at the remaining two clasped in Harry’s hand — these are tickets for the London Zoo dated in the year 1999.
If only Harry suggested 8 pm instead, if only Lucius Malfoy didn't have his heart attack back in Wiltshire in the early hours of this morning, if only the nurses didn't take one look at his Dark Mark and purposely schedule him for a later slot for his surgery, if only Draco's Portkey from London arrived earlier, if only he had run faster—
He's grateful for their support: Pansy had cut her honeymoon short when she heard the news and has been one of Draco's pillars of support, while Blaise and Greg quickly tied up some loose ends in their businesses — a vineyard and a career in construction, respectively — and hurried from Italy and Berlin, where they are now based.
"I don't blame them. Because you're
He remembers the heaviness of his heart as he was packing his things in the dead of the night with Blaise hurrying him. He was leaving Hogwarts in such a rushed manner because of the death threats facing his family. There were so many things he would miss: he didn't even have the time to say goodbye to Pansy and Greg, and in the case of Harry...
Well, that bit is true... Harry takes a calming sip of Earl Grey and recalls the events that had led to that fateful night with Malfoy. He had been with Cheryl (his secretary in the orphanage) in the drawing room of Grimmauld Place, scrutinising the list of donors that were worthy of an invitation to the charity auction. Harry wasn't one of the organisers — he hated doing things like that, that was more of Cheryl's forte — nor was his orphanage one of the beneficiaries since he had enough money to support Grimmauld Place. However, there were still other orphanages that needed assistance, so Harry had agreed to help.
In his hurry to exit the departure area, Draco accidentally nudges the wheels of his luggage against the ankle of a witch. Normally he'd turn around to apologise, but his tunnel vision recognises only Harry and Pansy a short distance away. He last saw them around three months ago, when he returned briefly to interview a source and exchange intelligence with a London paper before rushing back to Los Angeles.
The expression in Harry’s eyes would make any lesser wizard cower in his boots, but not Draco.
Draco can only moan, his eyes closed and mind reeling at the sensory overload. Potter swaps sides; now it's his tongue on Draco's left nipple, his right hand on his right, and left hand on Draco's cock. Lightning streaks of desire dart like fireflies through Draco's system. He's so far gone, he can't even remember his name. His world has narrowed to Potter's mouth and fingers on his erogenous zones, every lick and tug turning Draco on to no end.
When Malfoy turns the corner, Harry closes the door. With his back pressed against the door, he slides down to the floor, a long and dreamy sigh accompanying his descent.
He despised the impression that he had left Potter with then: thin, filthy Azkaban rags draped over his gaunt body, greasy and tangled hair hanging limply down to his shoulders, chapped lips and eyes gone dull with defeat. That's why he had taken pains tonight with his appearance — he's kitted out in a bespoke, classic black three-piece suit. The jacket, with one button fastened around his waist, makes his shoulders seem broader than they actually are. A white silk pocket square is tucked on the chest of the jacket. He's wearing a white shirt and a checkered red tie under his waistcoat, and his black trousers are just the right cut to emphasise his height.
"He's pining," Ron declares around a mouthful of popcorn.
"Are you finished with travelling, then? You're always haring off to the next adventure, the next exotic locale," Malfoy says.
Draco glances at the date of the Battle of Hogwarts on Potter’s hand. It spelt the conclusion of a war that affected them so profoundly and deeply. Not that it didn't affect Pansy, of course, but not to the extent that she had to flee to the Muggle world or away from wizarding Europe.
“See you back in the office,” Theo says. He tucks his book under his arm, picks up his plate, and then leaves.
"Stay, won't you?" Malfoy asks, voice thick with emotion. He kisses the top of Harry's head. "Stay with me?"
The torrent of fire cuts a swathe of destruction through this stretch of the Forest. One of the Keepers jumps on a broom and soars into the air to contain the flames, while the others renew their efforts to control the dragon. Adrenaline pumping in his veins, Draco darts around the area to cast a series of protective spells around each person, augmenting them with fire-resistant qualities, while taking care to avoid the dragon's snorts and hefty feet.
“Go!” Hermione says, as he grips his wand, ready to Apparate.
Harry looks different in daylight.
Draco’s heart clenches at the intimate setting — he was so consumed by the past that he completely overlooked the present.
Draco wrinkles his nose at the dried ketchup and coffee stains on the napkin. "The Potter-Weasley fight for treacle tart: unfairly held hostage by one Draco Malfoy, also known as pointy ferrety git," he recites blandly. Potter flushes with embarrassment. "And they say Slytherins are the overdramatic ones.”
"Dobby painted this. It's supposed to be me, but…" Potter peters off, gesturing limply to the mop of black hair that looks like a large bird's nest. His grip tightens on the frame, so hard that his knuckles turn white. "You were there when Bellatrix killed him. For once, Hermione couldn’t solve it, so I… I buried him near Shell Cottage. Dug his grave myself."
He needed just one night — one night to get Malfoy out of his system.
After a few minutes, he hears Harry switching off the lights, the snap of waistband against skin when Harry wears his boxers and the clatter of the flask on a hard surface. The bed dips, and the entire suite is flooded with darkness after Harry clicks off the other intact lamp.
“You’re the one I’ve been singing for?” Malfoy says, his voice a papery whisper. “No, no…” he stutters, a white-knuckled hand gripping the doorjamb. He goes very still, his dazed eyes staring at a spot behind Harry. Harry turns to look, but there’s nothing. “No,” Malfoy repeats in distress, and Harry spins back. It’s as if he’s lost in a fog of memories; his reaction is beyond mere astonishment and shock.
Only one way to find out.
All because of him.
"Hang on. Did we just get engaged?"
Draco’s heart clatters at twice the speed at the thought of Potter in bed with him.
The thought of kissing Malfoy there, that secret, private place that no one else has ever touched is enough to drive Harry’s anticipation to fever-pitch. He's heard the boys talking about something like that, about licking girls there and how much they like it.
"Alright?" Draco asks.
Harry rears back as if slapped.
Harry glares at him.
"Dinner's ready, just let me dish up," Malfoy says, pulling Harry out of his recollections.
"W-Why would I want to enter Sin?" Harry stumbles, hedging for time by gathering their mugs and standing up. "Just like what you said, we sell different things. I don’t have any reason to visit him. No reason at all!" He thinks that his words sound a bit too high-pitched, but it's probably some leftover brownie still lodged in his throat.
A night would never be enough.
He doubles back to where Potter lays, sprawled out on the floor, an upturned chair beside him.
It’s lucky that they were flying fast but not high. Besides, Draco’s experienced worse falls during Quidditch matches.
"I want it, I really do," Malfoy insists. He frowns at himself and wanks in short, desperate strokes, keen on showing Harry just how much he wants it.
Harry looks at the photograph, to the Polyjuice pills, and back to the photograph again.
Draco had spent too much time at Hogwarts observing Potter to miss that. His smirk still in place, he rests his right palm on the table, slides his left hand into his pocket and crosses his legs at the ankles. He's envisioned this scenario so many times in his head, aiming for the epitome of cool and collected, suave and smooth, although the pounding of his heart indicates the opposite.
"That's the
Only thirty minutes into the game, and that was the eighth time that Campbell showed visible discomfort.
Harry shifts uncomfortably in his seat, his face warming with embarrassment when someone nearby whispers behind their hand to a friend. He wheels around to the bar, his blush deepening when the bartender shoots him a curious look. He tugs his hood up, drains his beer and stares resolutely at his glass. The singing resumes, but he doesn’t move. Merlin, of course Malfoy would react to him; they have so much baggage between them that it could fill up an airport. Maybe he should leave, the last thing he wants to do is disrupt Malfoy’s set.
No, he can’t stay.
Draco drops the trousers he's holding, the hanger clattering to the floor.
"Yeah. Speed's good," Harry manages between gasps as Malfoy establishes a steady rhythm. Harry cants his hips up and spreads his legs wider; Malfoy takes the hint and bends down to kiss him, his tongue slipping into Harry's mouth the same time two fingers enter Harry. He pushes into Harry deeper this time, and when he brushes against his prostate, Harry groans and sinks his fingernails into Malfoy's shoulder.
In response, the sconces extinguish abruptly, leaving only two alight on his left, which leads him to Potter. Incensed, he stomps there, banging hard on Potter's door and shouting his name, but receiving no reply.
Pansy winks at Draco. "Go with the blue shirt, darling, it brings out your eyes."
The only light glinting in the room was a candle studded on a single piece of chocolate cake.
Recently, his concentration has been shot to pieces. Once again, his gaze wanders to his tattoo, and he smiles. He could be doing mundane things such as brushing his teeth or making tea, and his mind would scamper away to memories of his first kiss with Potter.
, has just
He's just about finished with the chapter when the doorbell rings. He glances at the clock — it's eleven on a Monday night. It can't be Pansy, Blaise or someone close from work; they'd arrive by the Floo. It can’t be his parents either, because they'd write first before visiting, unless...
His world narrows to Potter's weaving and diving figure, glowing with the orange of the flames as he dodges another plume of fire. Draco scampers around the area, throwing up defence charms and fire-resisting shields around Potter and his snake. The heat and adrenaline surging through Draco makes him sweat as he keeps his eyes fixed on Potter's dance with the dragon. Potter now has the dragon's full attention, and it snarls, its jaws snapping as it spars with the pesky figure floating near her head, her large paws jabbing at Potter like how one would bat away a fly.
Draco's throat thickens with tears.
If only.
When a raucous group crowds the bar, shouting out their orders, Harry shrinks back against the wall at his corner. Eventually, they return to the back rooms, and he hears the drone of the television. He hops off his stool and peers into the room — it appears to be some sort of game room with two pool tables and two dartboards. He goes back to his seat and nurses his drink, letting the energy and noise of Mona’s wash over him.
"She is a wonderfully delightful biped," Bacon says with a touch of affection, but tosses his head haughtily when he mentions Ron. "I cannot say the same for her choice of mate, however."
"So eager, as always. I'm kissing you now, kissing every inch of you just the way you like it, you feel so good, so warm on my lips... can't get enough..." Draco describes through a sigh, but how could he, when his mouth is travelling up and down Harry's length, dropping small kisses and tiny kitten licks, one hand on Harry's hip while his other hand fondles Harry's balls. Oh,
And then he lifts up the lid of the box, something he hasn't done in almost two years.
It’s already November, and term will end soon for Christmas. He’s mostly glad, as he can return to France to see Mother and Pansy, and also take a much-deserved break from the busy humdrum of school, but a part of him is disappointed, because he can’t see Potter every day.
"You don't look too well. D'you want some water?"
"Not so much, since most of my clients are Muggles. Demand is low, although I've inked a few magical tattoos this year," Pansy says, closing the book. "I tattooed a witch some time ago, and she seemed interested in a glow-in-the-dark magical tattoo, but when I took my wand out, she changed her mind." Pansy scoffs. "Apparently people still aren't comfortable with me, a Dark Lord sympathiser, using magic around them."
And Ron?
Draco tilts his head, confused. "It's raining," he says slowly and gestures to the thickening rain, as if he's explaining something to a particularly unobservant person.
None of the photos has captured Draco with another man, giving Harry hope.
“I will not be surprised if the castle exhibits signs of being sentient, having played host to a staggering amount of magical objects, witches and wizards for centuries,” Draco says. “My bed was cold, despite my numerous warming charms, the taps in my en-suite wouldn’t work, the locks in my room would jam, the fire in the sconces dying out whenever I stepped into a corridor. If I was alone during night patrol, my only light would be my
"Sit on the edge of the bed. Do not lie down. Open your legs as wide as they can go. Touch yourself for me, Harry, touch it good..."
"Just you. Only you," Harry repeats in jagged gasps, starbursts of ecstasy igniting in him like fireworks. "Gonna, I'm gonna—"
"It hurts, Draco. I thought it'd get better, but it still hurts so much."
"Come in me. Please, Harry, please, I'll take every drop, just like how I swallowed you all up. I'll take everything because I'm your Slytherin slut-"
Draco lifts up his head to glare at him, but shrugs on the blue shirt. He gets out of bed and finishes dressing. He looks at his reflection in the mirror and smiles at the memory of that night in the courtyard. Satisfied with his appearance, Draco waves to Greg and makes his way to the almost-empty common room, just in time to see Pansy lean forward, fix Potter with a hard stare and ask him, "Do you have dishonourable intentions towards Draco?"
When they're finished, Harry tosses the cloth to the side and gathers Draco in his arms. Draco loves how Harry holds him. His embrace is fiercely protective and his presence wonderfully solid. They rest their foreheads together, and Draco's mouth turns up into a brilliant smile at the sight of Harry's glowing smile.
"Spend the next few days clearing the paperwork on your remaining cases. I won't be expecting you in the office when you're undercover, since Dan Felton" — Kingsley indicates the photo with his chin (Harry knows that the name is as genuine as his dancing skills) — "will be busy undercover, or should I say...
When the strippers finish their set, Harry gets up and threads his way to where they step off the stage. He can only proceed a few steps along the narrow corridor when he sees a pair of bouncers lurking around a corner. The Invisibility Cloak presses against his thigh, and he's just about to use it when he hears a door open and footsteps drawing closer. He hurries back to the main area and watches as a fresh group of strippers emerge, flanked by the bouncers, who stand guard at the spot where Harry stood mere seconds ago. Harry spots another pair of bouncers and strippers crossing the adjacent walkway.
Harry flinches, the words like a slap to the face. He's tempted to shout back, but he swallows the furious words, simmering so close to the surface. Instead, his voice is subdued, his eyes sad and tired, arms hanging at the sides.
Draco inhales the herbal scent of Hermione’s shampoo and smiles. He's grateful for her company too; he's enjoyed their intellectual conversations about literature and magic. Although her knowledge in potions falls short of his, Hermione had given him very useful feedback (incorporating her experience in Herbology and Transmutation) about his potions manuscripts.
Harry doesn’t break his promise, made so many months ago, in Draco’s flat in New York:
, and again, Potter's pulling out even before Draco has the chance to settle into a rhythm.
"Yeah." Harry nods. "But it's worth it. For you.” Malfoy looks down, trying to hide the smile spreading across his face, and Harry continues. “Plus you’ve had to sacrifice too," he says, thinking of Lucius Malfoy's fury and the scandal splashed over the papers. "I love travelling, exploring new places and cultures. But it'd mean so much more if you’re with me. We could do it for leisure. I could show you the world. Places like Hawaii, Malta, New Zealand," he says hopefully.
They haven't been meeting up as often, what with N.E.W.T.s starting next week. This is Malfoy's way of getting Harry's attention, wearing something like that and sauntering into the Great Hall thirty minutes late for lunch and ignoring Harry’s gaze.
"Harry," Draco says out loud, the name echoing in the empty kitchen. It sounds strange, saying it when he isn't lost in the throes of sexual abandon.
Harry's thoughts screech to a stop.
That was probably why, coupled with lewd gestures and meaningful eyebrows towards Potter's uniform, Draco had mouthed
"The things I do for you…" Draco says, releasing a dramatic, long-suffering sigh. Harry beams, his gaze falling to Draco’s lips. Grey eyes dart around them—Draco's usually wary of kissing in public—but it's fairly quiet, except for a few other couples and a family in the distance.
"It's cosier than you'd think," Parkinson says after a while.
"Only fifty?"
"That night, when I watched you -
"He's been hauled to the Ministry for questioning."
"C'mere you
" Harry watches as Malfoy's entire body tenses up, watches as Malfoy shrieks Harry's name and comes all over the sheets.
“What the—“
He needs to have a reason to go over, though; he imagines Harry's smug reaction
He pulls out, and with two quick pumps of his fist, his abdominal muscles clenching and Potter's name on his lips, Draco throws his head back and comes hard and messy on Potter's cock, the last few trickles dripping down to the sofa.
Brilliant, mind-blowing, amazing, out-of-this-world sex right off the bat.
Only his way back is lit up.
That night, Draco had saved Weasley from himself on the year that
"You're two grown men who’ve been acting like pygmy puffs! Go out for dinner, a drink, or even a shag if that's what you want. Just sort it out, alright?" he says, jabbing at them with a finger. He exhales heavily and leaves the scene, not to return to his office, but to visit the Extendable Ears aisle and grab one for his own use.
"Did I hurt you?" Harry asks. Alarmed, he withdraws.
He's stopped telling himself that it's a coincidence after he brought the third Potter look-a-like home.
“Oh,” Potter says, looking away.
Potter’s hopeful face falls, and he hesitates before smiling back. He looks down at his bowl, pushing cornflakes around with his spoon in a rather disappointed air.
There's a long moment of silence as they simply hold each other, taking their time to return to reality after a bout of phenomenal sex.
“Draco…” Potter whispers. It’s the way he says his name, like before that kiss in the pub—
Harry sticks a finger down his collar and adjusts it, is Malfoy
When they move closer to the bed, the candles dim. Celestina Warbeck's "A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love" pipes softly into the Room.
Potter whispers his name again into the kiss, and Draco kisses him even harder. He doesn’t know why; whether he wants Potter to say it again, or he wants to stop him from saying it, because he’s scared, he’s terrified…
“What if… I checked if we could go another time, when the both of us are free? I swear I’ll let you know before booking anything. Or would you prefer to get a refund?”
“Where’d you get that?” Harry asks, pointing to the dessert.
Two minutes pass, and Potter is still in canary form.
Then she promptly shuts the door in their startled faces.
"Wouldn't what? Swallow it all?" Draco croaks as he licks his glistening lips, smiling when Potter's pupils dilate at the sight. Draco gets up and straddles Potter's lap, forcing Potter's attention on his erection. "You forget that I'm a man of many talents." Draco kisses Potter squarely on the lips. "You taste delicious."
"Like what? A proper relationship? You don't know me well enough to want that!"
"Care to tell me what this is about?" Draco asks, even though he already has an idea.
Three sharp raps on his door, and then Potter bursts into his lab like an over-excited Crup, complete with a cheery greeting and an electric grin that makes Draco's heart thud with longing.
“He’s going to eat up all of your profit margin.” Draco says, sighing. “And he’s going to become so fat.”
Draco nods back. Although they're not close friends, Granger has been more accepting of their relationship than Weasley, but at least all three of them are on civil terms. He slants a glance towards Potter, who's staring ahead at the display of the Giant Squid's tentacles with amusement.
Instead, Draco asks, “Are you worried about the third task?”
“Yes, fuck
"Harry? S'at you?"
"The Draco I know isn't afraid to call me out when I'm being an arse, and I like that. He writes songs and sings for me with one of the most beautiful voices I’ve heard. He's got a brilliant sense of humour and wit, and even though he’s a lot to handle sometimes, he's worth it. Worth going back to New York for. Worth a dedication to a whole exhibition too, because he's just that wonderful." Harry recalls when he fell sick a while ago, and Draco took care of him. "This Draco is caring and thoughtful, and he only shows this side to people close to him, and I'm so lucky, so bloody lucky that I'm one of those people."
The Slytherin in him hisses that it'll be wise to keep Potter close, because being the partner of the Saviour would open up a myriad of benefits, such as connections that would help Draco obtain a job, but...
"What memory finally worked?" Potter asks, his eyes still on their Patronuses.
"There has to be some way around this!" Harry pleads. "We'll take the letters back, and we'll find another way, another angle to crack the case. There has to be another way!"
Harry knows he definitely wouldn't mind.
Harry’s expecting to see a single slice of fresh treacle tart, but on top of that, Malfoy's given him a sampling platter of Sin's wares: dainty white chocolate pralines drizzled with dark chocolate; macarons with delicate shells sandwiching luscious chocolate filling; a single molten chocolate fairy cake topped with gleaming vanilla frosting; gooey walnut brownies with browned marshmallows; and lastly, a pair of lush strawberries dipped in rich milk chocolate.
Harry glances at the visitors of the park again. It's not a new sensation — feeling alone in a crowd of people, on the outside looking in. The sharp sting of loneliness is familiar, intensified by the nature of his work. Once again, he finds his gaze gravitating towards Malfoy, who is sitting a short distance away. He appears to be writing a song — tinkering with a few chords and humming as he studies a piece of paper with scribbled words. He picks up a pencil, writes something down, and whispers something under his breath repeatedly. Annoyed, he purses his lips and crosses the lyrics out, before strumming a string of chords. He tucks a lock of black hair behind his ear; his earrings are different today, two small silver hoops instead of the studs.
When the head of Harry's cock slips inside Draco's mouth, Harry cants his hips up in encouragement, only to have Draco restrain him with a hand on his left hip.
Everything happens so fast — a series of thudding sounds reverberate throughout the house, as if all the drawers and wardrobes are yanking themselves open and slamming themselves closed. Draco yelps when a door bangs against the wall, followed by other doors following suit. Before they know what's happening, piles of clothes are rocketing towards them from different rooms. They're being pelted by all sorts of clothing — Potter's clothes and centuries-old attire, both male and female, that wouldn't look out of place on Draco's ancestors.
Malfoy huffs and throws his arms up in exasperation. "I knew I wasn't going to get any sympathy from you, Weasley. Of course, it'll be up to me to fix things that need not have happened if people learnt how to follow instructions! Who knows, I might just leave it there," he grumbles, skewering Harry with a glare. He hurries towards his bookshelves, pulls out a folder with colour-coded parchment and flips through it, mumbling darkly to himself all the while.
"There isn't a body. It was an explosion that killed them. The Ministry will be holding a memorial service, of course."
"Don't know you well enough—" Potter splutters.
Harry's not here anymore.
,” Draco hisses and wanks faster. Potter looks so
Draco is sucked into a maelstrom of memories about the Manor, images that he'd kept at bay for the past two years. After the war, Aurors dragged him from his Ministry holding cell to the Manor. Per their orders, he gave them access to every part of the Manor as they raided it for Dark artefacts. He could only watch as they took his terrified house elves away and plundered his ancestral home, turning it upside down and storming into rooms meant only for Malfoys. Draco trudged through the corridors, his head hanging, leftover horror and trauma dogging his footsteps because every corner reminded him of the Dark Lord’s torture.
Harry moans and deepens the cherry kiss, a kiss that brims with a heat, burns with an intensity that warms Harry down to the marrow of his bones. It's a kiss ripe with promise and potential, a hint of future things to come-
"I thought of you," Draco whispers. He swallows, another piece of his heart falling into place when Potter slowly turns to look at him, his eyes round. "I thought of you, Harry."
Harry’s heart aches with emotion. Not trusting himself to speak, he simply nods and jacks up the pace until he turns Malfoy into an absolute mess, lost in bliss. He grabs Harry everywhere, his wandering hands rubbing Harry's sweat-slicked biceps and shoulder blades, tangling his fingers in Harry's hair, touching him as if telling himself that it's real, that Harry's here, in his bed, fucking the breath out of him. Malfoy releases that tell-tale sound, a cross between a deep sob and a breathy sigh. He's close, and Harry isn’t going to deny him this time.
He’s the only person that Malfoy has just confided his past to. The noise and the surging crowds melt away, Harry’s attention entirely on Malfoy. Suddenly, a picture barges into Harry’s mind, as vivid as day: Times Square, lit up with its trademark glittering billboards and shops, rain puddles on the ground reflecting the colourful neon lights, but the streets and roads are deserted and hollow, decorated with emptiness…
"Shut up," Potter yells, twisting round to glare at Draco. "This is private, you don't have the bloody right to do this!"
Potter absently picks at a loose thread on the end of his sleeve. "I did mention it to a few people during Christmas. Ron and Hermione know, of course," he says, counting it off his fingers. "Luna said I had a lot of Wrackspurts around my head, so she asked if I was keen on anyone. She knows, which means Neville knows, and Ginny too, I would reckon." He pauses, thinking, but before he can name any more, Draco snaps.
Dan!" There's a note of panic in the presenter's voice now, and small clusters of said audience begin to murmur amongst themselves.
Unable to bear the stifling silence and Potter's stony gaze, Draco escapes to the bathroom. There's his pyjamas and a toothbrush. He knows he's being cautious —
Malfoy had fallen for it hook, line and sinker. And he definitely didn't disappoint — that extravagant sex-fest with Malfoy had been the best sex of his life. Every other man after that
"Back here? When was she ever at Hogwarts?"
The door of the pub swings open, revealing Neville and Pansy Parkinson. Harry can't help himself; he sits up straight and looks at the door, hope flaring in him for a glimpse of a blond head and stormy grey eyes.
amazing, but treacle tart coupled with Malfoy might probably be Harry's most favourite thing... Harry quickly swipes the dessert from Malfoy and places it on the table. The other man merely arches a brow in amusement and they finally sit down to dinner. Harry pours red wine into their glasses and pulls his own glass towards him. He takes a few bites of the pasta and catches Malfoy looking at his food and...
Even under his briefs, Potter's prick looks fucking fabulous, Draco can't wait to find out how it really looks. Potter cants his hips upwards, but Draco pouts and shakes his head, his lips hooking up into a rich, artful smile.
Malfoy doesn't deserve him.
He just said that..." Potter's blush deepens. "He approves of you."
Harry is busy with an exhibition of his watercolours — a collaboration with two other schoolmates — over a weekend in early July. Even though he isn’t headlining the show, it’s special, because Draco is there, a proud smile on his face, standing together with Harry’s friends, and he’s so happy.
Rooted to the spot, he stares, eyes widening and jaw dropping, shockwaves of disbelief reverberating from his core. Malfoy stares back, one arm slipping from the counter and dangling limply at his side. His breath caught in his throat, Harry remains still, afraid that if he moves, Malfoy will disappear like a dream. The rest of the ballroom fades away, his world narrowing down to Malfoy.
" Harry offered late one night when they were in bed and tangled in each other's arms, his lips pressing blooming kisses on Draco's fingertips.
, Malfoy panted into Harry's neck as he arched into his touch.
All songs listed here belong to their respective owners.
"How dare he!" Pansy snaps, her teeth bared.
the days, with your hair all... er..." He flaps a hand in the air as he rambles on, mounting panic and embarrassment flooding him, but it's as if he's lost control of his mouth. "Blond and shiny. Your hair's always nice and blond, soft and silky, not like mine, all..." He pats his own head. "Messy and everything. What hair product d’you use, d'you use a lot of it? Nothing works on mine." He abruptly stops himself, his toes curling in his boots with the awkwardness as he inwardly cringes to hell and back.
"I owe you one, mate," Harry says, already grabbing a handful of Floo powder. He glances at his friends before he steps into the Floo, feeling a rush of gratitude. They're his rock, his shelter, his home ever since he was eleven.
But Harry knew what wasn't a work-in-progress for them.
“Well, I should think so. You’re working on Monday, aren’t you?”
"I don't want just one night with you, Malfoy. I wanna fuck you all the time, every time. Anywhere, everywhere. However you'd like it, but I wanna do this properly," Harry pulls Malfoy closer to him and grabs his waist. He inches up (unlike Dan, he's shorter than Malfoy) and before the other man can react, Harry's pressed his lips against Malfoy's. They're kissing all over again, exactly like their last kiss in the club, but it's different now — it's Harry's own hands moving all over Malfoy's body, his own lips kissing Malfoy's, his own voice moaning in Malfoy's mouth and it's absolutely
Yawning, Harry almost falls off his chair in mid-stretch when someone clears his throat rather loudly. Harry closes his mouth at once and turns to his left.
Draco blinks. "You... bottom?" he repeats, surprised. His fantasies about Potter fucking him hard vanish with a disappointed little pop. "With a prick that size?" The words escape his mouth before he has fully processed it, and he's ready to take them back, knowing about Potter’s shyness.
"Wow, thanks. That's a new spell.”
Draco swallows the emotion in his throat, and his voice shakes when he whispers, "What am I going to do with you, Harry?"
It takes a moment for Harry to respond. He can't believe that Malfoy is here, minutes before Xu Jian will ring him to provide details of the Portkey. "Shanghai. Two months."
“Hey,” Harry murmurs into Hermione’s hair as he engulfs her into a tight hug. He strokes her back, hoping that his touch would soothe her. It does the trick — when she pulls back, she takes a steadying breath and wipes her nose and eyes with her sleeve. With her hands cradled around Harry's face, she says, “I’m so glad you’re back. And safe.”
“Ready?”’
"She did." Potter laughs, a sound as bright and happy as a shot of summer. Draco looks at him with longing, another piece of his heart falling into place. Potter stretches his arms out and flexes his fingers, and grey eyes swivel to the tattoo stretching from the back of his right hand to the inside of his elbow. He raises his arm to the light, and Draco squints at the faint scars covering the back of his hand. They look like words, but Potter covered them with a date.
It’s a long time before he’s finally done — the sun has already set, and he hears a whistling Weasley lock up his office and his fading footsteps. Draco yawns and stretches out the kinks in his spine. Pleased with his progress, he puts his things aside, leaves his lab and descends the winding staircase — similar to the staircase at the Burrow — to the shopfront.
Potter’s legs are already splayed open in invitation, his jeans and pants pushed to mid-thigh, his cock so hard that it’s parallel to his body, Merlin, what a view—
!" Potter shouts. Draco flinches when Potter grabs a cushion from the sofa and hurls it against the wall, his chest heaving and his fists clenching.
"I— I've n-never come like that before, I can't, I can't, let me t-touch, please!"
He can't... he
Harry munches grumpily on his bread and butter pudding.
Eventually, they pull apart, their breaths in furious, shallow synchronisation. Harry trails his palms down Draco's chest, while Draco's thumbs stroke his hips. "I went back to New York to look for you, but you left." Harry whispers, holding him closer. "I owled you after that, but you never replied."
Harry spun him around and pressed his front to Draco's back, rubbing his erection on Draco's arse. He ran his hands up and down Draco's hips and waist, while he licked and nibbled away at Draco's neck, tongue tracing Draco's jawline-
"Good afternoon, Malfoy."
Harry is caught looking, when Malfoy turns towards him with a questioning look on his face. Harry shakes his head and busies himself with mixing his paints. It doesn't matter if he hasn’t decided on a particular scene, he’s keen to paint something to get the flow going.
“Yeah, it’s been two weeks.” Potter looks at his jaw. “Yours?”
Taking advantage of the rumble of incoming cars and lorries that separate them, Draco momentarily lets his shoulders slump and releases the tension in his fisted hands. He knows exactly what to say and how to say it to make Potter react as expected, but it's been ten long years of fighting, and many things — including Draco's feelings — have changed.
“Concentrate,” Draco barks.
Blaise’s usually inscrutable face comes alive, his laughs and smiles dispensed freely as he watches his friend perform, and Greg claps and cheers the loudest out of them all.
There are tears pricking Harry's eyes as he edges a glance at Draco. Although Draco’s eyes are trained on the reunited family, it’s obvious that his thoughts are far away.
It is a yearly tradition for them to spend some time browsing the wares in the park-turned-Christmas market just ten minutes away from their apartment. Sometimes, Ron and Hermione join them before they leave together for dinner at the Burrow.
"You don't have to be alone," Draco whispers, his gaze flickering to Potter's lips. Potter's breath hitches, but he doesn't move away, and that's all Draco needs to know.
“Oh, Harry? You asked if there’s anything you should know. Do you really mean it when you say anything?”
The twinkling stars shine down on them, and the full moon hangs in the velvet night sky. The view from the Tower is truly romantic, providing an encompassing panorama of the sky, the Great Lake and the grounds beyond.
But that hadn’t stopped him from being pulled up from the depths of the Great Lake by Harry Potter that morning. They had broken through the surface of the water, Draco cocooned in the safety of Potter’s arms.
— littered on Harry's neck and the tops of his shoulders.
pile.
So he holds Harry close and hopes that his touch says the words that he can't.
"Your mother chopped it off again?" Draco asks, raising an eyebrow at the uneven cut of Charlie's hair.
Hermione beams back, saying, “I’m horrid at Quidditch, you know that. That’s more of Ron’s—“
Harry reminds himself not to speak to the snake — his cover will be blown if anyone, especially Malfoy, sees him talking to it; but on further inspection, Harry sees that there's no point — based on the de-fanged boomslang's glazed-over eyes, it's too drugged to respond anyway. Nevertheless, it still winds its way up Harry's body when he extends an arm to it.
"You break every damn rule back in Hogwarts, and you're suddenly all for following the rules now? I don't believe this!"
"Norberta!" Charlie hollers, jumping and raising his arms. He adjusts his fireproof balaclava and shouts again, catching the dragon's attention. It staggers towards Charlie, who backs away into a grove of trees. Magical ropes snap around the dragon's ankles; Filius and Minerva quickly conjure new restraints. The dragon’s formidable spiny wings attempt to beat, but it can't — someone must've grounded it.
Draco drinks his tea even angrier.
"Was anyone hurt?" Harry asks. He sits on the edge of the bed, and Malfoy takes a seat on the chair near his table.
Draco looks up from his stack of business contracts and groans in exasperation when his eagle owl skids onto his table, his wing just missing the uncapped bottle of ink nearby. Humphrey hops over Draco's arms to deposit a letter — the one that Draco had buried at the bottom of his pile of junk mail when he had received it last week — in front of him, before fixing Draco with an expectant look.
"Oh, no. I'm only fucking you with three-quarters of my dick. Gotta get you ready for all of it. If it feels so good like this, imagine how good it'll feel with the whole thing in. You thinkin' of that?" Draco leans down to whisper, his breath becoming more ragged with every thrust.
Weasley makes a strangled sound. He looks meaningfully at Potter, who elbows him in the stomach. "Yeah, I…" Weasley mutters, frowning at his friend. "I've got plans with Hermione. Er… book club. Thanks for the offer, though."
Malfoy sighs. "I feel similarly, too. It's just…" He puts the cushion down and rubs his face, shoulders slumped. "We did things the wrong way around. Couples usually start out as acquaintances, friends, experience a lengthy courtship before getting together and then becoming intimate. Merlin, I only learnt today that you take your tea with a cube of sugar and no milk."
"Really? You can't?" Hermione says crisply, arching a brow. "Then why aren't you in Korea now? Why did you dismiss Labelle's students in Ireland? Even though it wasn't your class, you could have easily taken over. It's Defence for first-year trainees. You could've done it with your eyes closed. You’re here because you already know what you want to do."
Harry's heart is beating so fast that he's afraid it might leap right out of his ribcage. Malfoy looks so vulnerable, an uncertain half-smile on his lips and his cheeks stained with a tinge of rose.
"Yes." The answer slips from Draco's lips without hesitation, because that's the truth.
Humphrey screeches in annoyance, but settles down at Draco's side. He starts to groom himself, nibbling at his claws and toes with his beak.
Does Harry care?
Draco suddenly feels homesick.
“He’s my father,” Draco eventually croaks, his eyes vacant and his hair wild.
It's been three weeks since Potter had dragged him to the burger bar, but there are still many things that they have yet to talk about — Draco's stripping and the War (sometimes Draco catches Potter's eyes lingering uncomfortably on his Dark Mark). Nevertheless, Potter's already moved on to addressing Draco by his first name, while Draco's still stuck on
“Stop looking at it like that,” Potter whispers.
Salazar, what do you do when you've got Harry Potter's cock in your face?
They head towards the nearest exit of the High Line, and when Harry tells Malfoy about his craving, Malfoy rolls his eyes good-naturedly.
"By the way, Led Zeppelin's one of my favourite bands too," he says, smiling tersely at Malfoy. Without waiting for Malfoy's reaction, Harry exits and retreats to the sanctuary of his own shop. He can still feel Malfoy's eyes on him, so he goes to the kitchen, closes the door, pulls up a chair and places the box on the counter. He runs his fingertips over the smooth matte finish of the box before flipping it open.
Harry feels a warmth spreading through him at Ron's loyalty.
It’s rather strange how the fire in the sconces flare once, before dimming slightly, lending a soft, cosy atmosphere. The reflection of firelight dances on Potter’s glasses and earrings.
He'll never forget the heart-breaking sounds of his mother’s sobs.
Draco relaxes his throat as he closes his eyes and sucks hard, easing it deeper into his mouth. Potter's abdomen clenches, and he longs to pull off to look at Potter's expression, but he has to concentrate. He paces himself, breathing through his nose while his mouth works its magic. His eyes watering, Draco swallows another inch, and another, until it nudges the back of his throat, and even so, it’s not fully in yet.
Draco's head is tilted towards the sky as he gazes at the moon with forlorn eyes. His hair is longer now, the ends of the blond strands falling loosely around his face and brushing the Gryffindor scarf wrapped around his neck.
"I... I like Malfoy's hands," Harry says after a long moment, wondering if he's making a colossal mistake.
Draco's hand, which is holding an uncapped vial of morning dew and hovering over a bubbling cauldron, jerks at the muffled sound of Potter's bright laughter in Weasley's office. Draco swears when five drops, instead of three, fall into the cauldron. He sighs in dismay when the potion turns a murky green.
Harry's smile fades.
As if privy to his thoughts, Potter pushes Draco away to bend down and remove his sneakers and socks before pulling off his jeans. He's about to lean back on Draco's chest, but appears to think twice. He instead plops down on the sofa and reaches over to grab Draco's arse to pull him closer. Potter blinks up at him, green eyes wide and slightly unfocused.
It's halfway into the night when Hermione catches Draco's eye and indicates the bartender’s counter. They head there to get the next round. After they place their orders, they linger at the bar, observing the raucous group from a distance.
Potter opens the box.
“Hmm.” Malfoy looks unconvinced, but he leaves it at that. He waves at Marjorie, flashing her a warm smile. “See you next week.” Marjorie looks up from the beer tap and grins back, waggling her eyebrows at Harry. Instead of responding, Malfoy grabs his jacket from the coat stand near the door and leaves the bar, with Harry trailing after him.
This is as close to redemption as he can possibly get.
The snake catches her eye and hisses.
Harry pokes his head around a large shelf holding pots and pans, blinking rapidly at the side view of Malfoy standing between two stoves. Something simmers in a stockpot on one stove, while on the other, a spoon swirls lazily by itself in a saucepan. The scent of fresh herbs, tomatoes and spices permeate the air, and Harry licks his lips.
Excitement thrums in his blood as Harry flings the curtains open. He can feel a thick web of magic here — protective and concealment charms potent enough to escape his general diagnostic spells. Harry starts to untangle the layers of spells, and he's finishing up when he hears Bacon's hisses emitting through the gap under the door.
Harry flops onto the bed and stretches. Maybe he'll have a quick shower and a nap before popping over to Draco's...
"I was gonna approach him anyway," Harry mumbles. He takes a seat opposite George and nicks a biscuit from the tin on his desk.
George presses his lips together in determination when Harry sags against his chair and chews rather morosely on another biscuit.
"I swear on Merlin's pants, if they've blown up the rose bushes..." Draco grumps as they emerge from their bedroom.
"Get me ready for that huge cock of yours," Potter orders.
The easy, intimate atmosphere melts away, the way dreams dissolve and vanish.
Harry blinks, entirely wrong-footed. "Hang on. That's not how it's supposed to go! You," — Harry points at Hermione — "were supposed to go all" — he pitches his voice to a higher register and laces his fingers together —
Harry had had enough.
“Because you have my attention, Malfoy. All of it, every time. Ever since first year,” Potter murmurs and strides away from Draco. He turns to see a smirking — where the hell did Potter learn to smirk like that? — Potter with his arms spread out, as if offering himself up to Draco.
," Potter demands. He entwines their fingers together and kisses Draco over and over and
As time passes, fresh potions bottled and ready for sale gradually fill his workbench. Hermione stays with him, curled up in a corner with a book and a hot mug of tea.
Draco shrieks Harry's name as his hips jerk and he comes, shooting his load all over the sheets. "Oh, God yes." He makes a sound — a cross between a sigh and a sob.
“Yes…” Malfoy had said shakily, flicking plaster dust from his hair. “I was trying something out. Something that the books didn’t mention. And… well…” Shooting George a helpless look, he had gestured to the ruins of his bench and the crumbling remains of the wall.
Potter deflates. "Uh. No." He frowns. "But that doesn't mean I don't care about them!"
Draco throws his head back and gasps, anticipation buzzing in his blood when nimble fingers get to work on his belt and the zipper of his trousers.
George didn't mind the explosions — as long as he didn’t actually set anything on fire.
"I... no, you didn't."
Draco folds his arms across his chest and shoots Potter a withering look. "We wouldn't have to go through all of this if you had kept your hands to yourself! Now please leave, I've got work to do!"
Potter closes his eyes, a single tear falling down his cheek.
"Yes, so good for… oh!" Malfoy gasps when Harry eases a finger in, working him open in a gentle, tender slide. He sprinkles a necklace of kisses on the base of Malfoy's throat when he adds another finger. Harry kisses him on the mouth, swallowing his moan when he begins to scissor his index and middle fingers. Malfoy is so tight and warm, and the thought of pushing his throbbing cock inside sends another wave of lust thundering through Harry.
“Yeah. I'm so glad that today’s my last day in the office for a while,” Harry mutters and steps into the shower.
Harry nods, matching Malfoy's tentative smile. "Where does this end?"
curving slightly to the right, and so thick that Draco’s arse is clenching at the thought of being stretched by it. There’s pre-come dripping from the tip, and he’ll give anything to taste it, swirl his tongue all over Potter’s
…until the first April Fool’s Day after the war.
"You can't go around disapproving or approving the men in my life, Bacon!"
Draco retreats further into the shadows provided by the large tree. When Potter slants his body, he squints at the black ink-like marks on two locations — slightly above his left hip and a string of what looks like words occupying the inside of his right upper arm — those must be Potter’s tattoos. Draco is too far away for further scrutiny, but Potter did mention that he has a tattoo. Draco was curious, but he didn’t want to pry.
They pull apart after a while to cuddle in bed.
Potter stares at Draco as if the trunk had knocked him silly. "Touch it to see if it...
"I am!"
Outside, the weather is pleasant, and the streets busy. Harry winces at the sharp honk of a yellow taxi when a boy dashes across a street crossing. A rather handsome blond man with a nice arse, who is bending over to unlock a bicycle in a row of parked bicycles, catches Harry’s eye.
Anticipation and excitement swirl in Draco. He steals a glance at Harry. They’re together in a place that Draco’s always wanted to visit, and Draco bites his lip to stop the silly smile spreading across his face. He suppresses his longing to hold Harry's hand. Instead, he looks up at the blue sky. It's a beautiful day, save for the smattering of dark clouds in the distance.
"Of course, Harry!" Pansy shoots back without missing a beat, emphasising his name. "Would hate to stand in the way of true love!" she trills, equally obnoxiously.
Harry has come to recognise moments when Malfoy would experience flashbacks — the sight of a snake triggered the most recent one when they passed by the window display of a pet shop. He knows Malfoy doesn’t sleep well; he often hears the telly coming from his flat in the middle of the night when Harry emerges from his room for some water. A part of him still can’t get used to Malfoy’s black hair, and when his gaze lingers on his unblemished left forearm, Malfoy would turn his arm over, or yank down his sleeve. When Malfoy is left to his thoughts, like now, an undercurrent of melancholy weighs him down, going by his downturned lips and vacant gaze.
"You look even better up close," Harry murmurs, wrapping his arms around Malfoy's waist and pulling him closer.
He had just wanted a taste of Potter; wanted to try him out.
They share a shy smile, their faces engulfed in lovely pink blushes.
it, Harry."
"But it's still around here! I don't know how it's hiding, but we didn't see it leave."
Her red-rimmed eyes focus at once on Draco's face, the look in them crazed and panicked. "The baby, our baby Rose, without a father, how can I have a baby without Ron, I can’t have her without him—"
Potter frowns. “Angry… at you? You talk as if Hogwarts can feel emotions.”
“Hey, Rose. It’s Uncle Harry.” His voice breaks, emotion welling up in his throat.
Ron or him.
He slumps his upper body on the table and stares with vacant eyes at Harry's note
Harry did mention before that he was interested to know more about Malfoy's inventions, so it’s hardly George’s fault if he was merely granting Harry’s wish, wasn’t it?
Harry stares at Malfoy's dot on the Marauder's Map; he is currently in the Slytherin dungeons, surrounded by a cluster of students. Sighing, he forces himself to deactivate the Map and place it on his bedside dresser. He takes off his glasses and stretches out in bed, pressing his face into his pillows.
And so, he tried to collect his feelings and stow them away, cover up what he had shared with Harry with
With ink-stained fingers, Draco thumbs through a dossier of old newspaper clippings with moving photographs. Some are yellowed with age and crinkle under his fingertips, and he pauses at another one of his articles. It's another Quidditch scandal that he investigated three years ago—this time involving a ring of high-profile players that were caught embezzling funds from an orphanage that took in war orphans.
Although Malfoy isn't dressed in a Muggle suit, he still looks drop-dead gorgeous. He's wearing a grey shirt, paired with a black robe thrown casually over his shoulders, reaching down to his knees. The robe is fastened on the base of Malfoy's throat with a black and green brooch emblazoned with the Malfoy crest. The chain of a pocket watch peeks out from the pocket of his black trousers, and his polished shoes shine in the sunlight.
please…” His fingers stroke Draco’s rim, pressing in—
"Easy for you to say. Shouldn't you be playing happy families with Greengrass?" Harry says, his brow furrowed and an edge to his words.
"Have dinner with me," Draco blurts out, seized by panic and anxiety about Potter’s safety.
Draco does so, gratification returning as he jacks off, with Potter leaning back, his hands on Draco’s thighs, holding him open as he fucks him cautiously and carefully with controlled strokes. He’s gazing at their joined bodies, as if mindful of the extent that he can go. Draco closes his eyes and tips his head back to hide his frown. It feels good, yes, but…
Harry sits up straight and eyes Malfoy as he comes closer.
Malfoy shrieks and continues to sing along in a rather off-key fashion; Harry can't help cracking a smile because he acts exactly the same way when
Draco shifts on the reclining chair, making himself comfortable as Potter mixes the inks. His left arm is resting palm-up on a cushioned table. He gazes at the delta of blue-purple veins threading under his wrist, then down to the Dark Mark; the hollows of the skull that stare back at him defiantly, and the snarled, fanged jaw of the viper. For ten years it has kept him company, reminding him of the lowest point in his life and the worst of himself.
Harry's original intent had been to gloat, but Malfoy's sitting right there in Sin and tucking into Harry's chocolate desserts with a pleasure that's almost... sexual. Harry's eyes are as wide as dinner plates as he watches the trail of white chocolate dripping down the other man's hand, at the tip of Malfoy's tongue that darts out between a set of full lips, licking from wrist-bone to thumb.
There's no use putting it off any longer.
Harry ignores the question and pulls him into a corner behind a potted plant.
His world does not revolve around Harry. He has his work, his books and friends that care about him.
He had Flooed over when he regained his senses, only to be met with a dreadful sight: Hermione slumped on the door, her head tipped back and throat exposed while she screams Ron’s name over and over again amidst sobs that shake her entire frame. She's clutching onto Ron's unopened will so hard that it's scrunched into an indiscernible shape.
"That's all of them," Harry says. "Time to get to work."
The bed is perfumed and rose-scented, the sheets silky and enticing, and it’s so easy to reach over and touch Potter, Salazar knows Draco wants to, so much. But he can’t. Not yet, not now.
That was how they’d learnt.
Potter shifts around on the bench. “We don’t have to talk if you don’t want to,” he whispers.
He tried, really, he did. He sat at his table and attempted to construct a short paragraph, blooming with affection and endearments. He tried fitting the words on his tongue, but they only wilted on his lips.
It takes a few tries for Harry to speak because he's fighting to control his own tears. "What did I ever do to deserve a love like yours? Save the wizarding world? If that's the case, I'll save the world every single time to have a love like yours, from someone like you, in all of my lifetimes."
"Yeah, Malfoy, I really, really wanna know you a lot better."
Harry's always been impulsive, like a runaway train with no fixed destination in mind, and Draco can only hold on and hang tight to him, wishing that Harry wouldn't leave him behind.
Draco packs away the other jumpers into the bag. Potter looks mournfully at the two bags of clothes to be donated, while Draco retrieves a tiny folded box from his briefcase. He enlarges it, and then raises his wand at the messy pile of wanted clothes. He casts another spell — he's particularly proud of this one — that folds them into the box in a special way so that they're easy to see and retrieve.
about Oliver and Harry. "He's always bloody grumpy whenever the media announces updates about your love life."
“But my home is here, I can’t just up sticks and leave!"
Draco licks his lips.
"Astoria, dear," a lady pipes up, looking at Harry and the couple. "You haven't… with Mr Potter?"
"This is where I'm gonna eat mine then," Harry replies, his voice rough as he spreads Draco's legs, his pupils dilating at the sight of Draco’s erection. He runs a finger around the rim of the open jar of treacle sauce, gazes at Draco...
Draco opens his eyes. Potter takes hold of his legs, rests the back of his calves on his own shoulders, and kisses Draco’s ankle. Potter is bathed in moonlight and the orange firelight of the sconces dances across his features, gleaming off his earrings. He gazes at Draco, and this time, it’s not his thrusts that knock the breath out of Draco, but the fond affection shining in his eyes and the tender smile curving his lips.
"I know." Even though Harry knew that Malfoy was lying from the start, something hard and bitter untangles within him, easing at those words.
“Faster,” Harry demands when Malfoy unbuttons his shirt in an excruciatingly slow manner.
Draco clears his throat. "I... should get going. Goodnight, Potter.”
Theo rears back at the sudden proximity and places both hands up, a crafty smirk quirking his lips. "Why, Potter, you seem... almost desperate to get this information."
"—to check if there were any rules against teachers dating each other. She said it was alright. I definitely didn't expect the entire faculty to know so soon, let alone bet on it." He gives Minerva a wronged look, but the Headmistress is entirely unapologetic.
Harry fires off a particularly vicious stunning spell towards Malfoy's left ankle, the curse so potent that the air around its path shimmers. Malfoy barely has time to dodge and collect his wits to throw up a Shield Charm.
When he grunts, Draco drops the book he wasn’t reading and scoots his chair closer to the bed. His body tense, Draco watches as Potter wiggles his fingers and toes, touching his own arms and stretching his legs to check for injuries, just like they learned in the Academy. Potter’s eyelids flutter open, and he gives Draco a slow, crooked smile. "Hey."
, he is tempted to accuse, like he used to, but he swallows it down. They have no right to point fingers at each other.
This isn't his first Ministry Christmas dinner and dance, and he's no longer that awkward eighteen-year-old.
"You still need to eat, yeah?" Potter cajoles. “Plus, I’ve got your favourite chocolate croissants from Magnolia. I passed by the shop this morning.”
A faded love bite peeks out timidly from the top of Malfoy's collar, and as his tongue lips
Harry alternates between concentrating on Malfoy's hole and sweeping the flat of his tongue along his crease in a steady pace. Malfoy clutches his pillow, his head hanging as he bounces his hips, pressing his arse back to Harry’s face in a plea for more.
Apparently, he hasn't lost the knack for hurting Harry right where it matters the most. Harry retreats to the door, his heart sinking like a boulder.
“You’ll never catch me, Potter!” Draco twists around to shout, but his smirk fades when Potter puts on another burst of speed.
For the next two years, Draco would appraise the students, noticing their technique, leadership skills and character, along with their ability to handle pressure and conflict. After their final exams, he would send Robards a list of names that he recommends, along with reference letters for students that requested it from him.
"Then why are you doing this? It's still so bloody hard to figure you out sometimes," Potter says, letting out a frustrated growl. "All those reasons that you gave..." Potter begins to count them off his fingers, his voice spiralling in volume and intensity with every word. "I've grown up with the media scrutinising my every move, so I'm hardly gonna care about what they talk about now. Yes, Ron and I are gonna be Aurors, but why are you even fussing about my promotion? I'm not even enrolled yet! I will meet new people, yes, and maybe they will be a better fit, but that doesn’t matter because the only person that I want to be with is you!"
"Right, then. Get your coat. We're going out for dinner," Harry says briskly.
“You want a confession?” Charlie leans back on the trunk of a tree, linking his fingers behind his head. “That’s not Draco’s style.”
Part of Harry's exhilaration disappears. He hadn't really thought about how this would affect his friends. "You think I'm making a mistake?" he asks. "I didn't make any promises, we just agreed that we'd like to get to know each other better."
Draco bristles. "Fine. I'll ride on your death-trap of a bike."
"You liked it!"
"Just in time," Potter says and tilts the pan to the side, topping up the small tower of buttermilk pancakes. Draco sets the table and it's not long before they're sitting down to breakfast. Draco drizzles more maple syrup and takes a big bite of fluffy pancake.
This isn't his room.
"Malfoy."
Astonished green eyes stare back at him.
The lovely mood of Draco’s birthday has evaporated, and they’re now left floundering in this fog of doubt and frustration. They have had similar arguments before, when Potter received a casual letter from a London-based ex asking about his plans for Easter hols.
"Come on, then." Draco kisses the top of his head. He lets Draco drag him into the shower. They make it quick, and it's not long before they're back in bed again.
“Harry,” he repeats, louder.
Potter looks around the infirmary, a wistful smile on his lips. "Back here again, like when I was a student. With my record, I reckon one quiet year of teaching is out of the question." He gazes at Draco for a moment, before melting into a goofy grin. "You're so gorgeous."
!" Potter’s words break off into a startled yelp when Draco roughly pushes him up against the wall of the darkened Ministry canteen. He raises his forearms to press them on the wall on either side of Potter’s head, trapping him. He works his right thigh between Potter’s legs, hissing in pleasure when Potter grinds on his thigh.
"That was only three-quarters?" Potter asks shakily.
They've been together for four years, and in these years with Harry, how much of it was spent with Draco's thoughts poisoned with pain and wreathed with worry about Harry's job? In the end, it didn't matter, because Harry's gone, he left anyway, he's
Draco snaps out of it with a visible shudder. His gaze flickers to the skyline across the river. Harry waits for him to say something, but when he doesn’t, he simply touches the back of Draco’s hand, giving him a patient smile. Harry and his friends have had each other to heal after the war, while Draco only had himself.
“I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself, you idiot,” Draco mumbles into Harry’s chest, but there’s no denying the happiness taking flight in him.
Potter laughs. “I aim to surprise.”
"I wanna eat the chocolate over
Harry nods. Their four-day visit ended a day before he left for field work.
They pull away eventually; slowly, hesitating at first, their exhaled breaths mingling against their lips. Harry's hand finds the back of Draco's neck, and they rest their foreheads together, breathing in shallow, furious synchronisation.
Hermione turns to give the man a cursory glance, before arching a brow at Draco. She rests her elbows on the edge of the table and leans forward, an impish smile winking on her lips. "Really? That's strange, because I think your type is someone shorter, with black hair, green eyes and glasses. Someone definitely not as suave and well-dressed as
, Harry," Draco's protests end in a thrilled moan when Harry, having popped the last button free to reveal his bare torso, snakes a hand down to Draco’s crotch.
Draco’s sessions with Alicia are scheduled for Monday afternoons and Friday mornings, and Harry keeps himself free for a while after those sessions, just in case Draco doesn’t want to be alone. When some nights are particularly bad, Harry talks to him on the phone, even though his own eyes are closing and his voice has tapered off into sleepy mumbles.
“Humphrey?
Bacon huffs, but stands down and slithers to a corner of Harry's table. In a reconciliatory gesture, he nudges a cup of coffee towards Harry with his snout. The snake coils his long, heavy body up and lapses into repose, but not before looking at Harry shrewdly.
Harry stares at his back for a long moment. At the rush of longing scrawled all over his heart, he frowns and turns around, facing Ron instead.
Humphrey perks up when a stray thought enters his mind.
Three days have passed, and Harry’s hope that Malfoy would open his door dwindles with each day. In fact, he’s so surprised when Malfoy’s door swings open that he simply stands there, his fist still in the air in mid-knock, wide eyes taking in Malfoy’s resigned expression and crossed arms. Grey eyes flicker to something behind Harry, as if he’s imagining something else, before settling on him.
Harry whistles, upends the bag and pours the treats out in an enticing pool on the kitchen island.
Draco nods, putting down his briefcase to take off his winter things and hang them on the coat rack, grateful for the toasty warmth breathing life into his numb extremities. He glances at the spot where the hideous troll leg used to be, but it’s gone. Draco scans his surroundings as Potter leads him inside the house, down the long hallway after the front door. The musty, faded carpets and peeling wallpaper is gone, along with the stern and disapproving portraits of Draco's ancestors. He looks at the wall on the staircase, noting the stark absence of the grotesque shrunken house-elf heads, and most importantly, Walburga Black's portrait.
"Breakfast? The morning...
Malfoy closes his eyes.
and there had been a rocky period in their relationship because of Draco's reticence about his feelings. But that was before Harry had learnt that Draco regarded actions to be more important than words. Some nights when Harry returned home late from work, he would find Draco fast asleep in front of the Floo with an open book on top of his stomach. Harry had asked him, "Why don't you go to bed?"
His heart sinks all the way down to his shoes as he plods back to the bench. Who was he kidding? It couldn't have been Harry.
Draco crosses his arms over his chest, his gaze darting, before he musters a weak sneer. "Are you going to save me, then? Like what you just did?"
"Shut the
"Yeah," Draco sighs, groaning when Harry starts to stroke him.
"So what happens next?" Draco asks when they're finished and Harry has rewarded each owl with a bowl of their favourite treats.
"It's all your fucking fault, Malfoy. All your fault that I can't eat or think of chocolate without thinking of you," he snarls. Anger, anticipation and arousal crash through him in waves, and he's lost, lost in Malfoy's gorgeous grey eyes, grey like a sky that could either bring rain or sunshine-
"You a strict bottom?"
"You do, but you're putting on your coat. So I reckon this means that you're as interested in me as I am in you."
Draco falls into a stunned silence at his words.
“Have it your way, then!” he yells, before stomping to his classroom.
Harry casts his mind to Ron and Hermione. He's never really thought about it, but Ron always knows what to order for Hermione—regardless of her cravings and mood—if she's nipped off to the loo when the waiter arrives. Similarly, Hermione knows what to say to calm Ron down, and Ron knows what to buy for her at the florist, while Harry doesn't even know about Malfoy's favourite flower—
He's half-hard even before he walks into his bedroom. Just the thought of Draco, all ready and waiting is more than enough to get Harry going. Last Christmas Eve, he had come home to Draco sprawled in his bed, wearing nothing but a filthy grin and a large red bow looped around his left thigh.
“No.” Draco closes his legs.
"Dinner tonight? Can't get enough of you," Harry mumbles into Draco's neck, pulling him close for a brief hug.
It comes back to Harry in a rush; Parkinson’s urgent words,
"Sorry, Mr Potter!" yells a horrified Ravenclaw a few pairs away. Harry waves back, signalling that it's alright. The students quieten down at the outburst, craning their heads to look at Harry.
"Fuck yeah," Draco agrees, his heart rate speeding up at the very thought of it. He pulls out and follows Harry's cue, settling himself on his knees between Harry's open legs when Harry lies down on his back. He holds Harry's left leg upright and leans it against his chest, a coil of lust surging when Harry's right leg falls apart at once. A lazy smirk poised on his lips, Harry grazes his fingers up and down the vee of his spread thighs before moving them to fondle his balls.
"Before I go. Just this once. Please," Draco murmurs, his heart beating rapidly like a flustered Golden Snidget. And then he closes his eyes, tilts his head and leans in, pressing his lips gently on Potter's.
Well, Draco also saw other things too, not just Potter’s thigh tattoo. His lips curve up into a slow, wicked grin as he remembers the happenings of the past two weeks—of them tumbling into bed together, leaving a trail of discarded clothes snaking from Potter's front door to his bedroom. Sexual tension crackled in the air as Potter stroked Draco in places where no one has ever touched before, triggering starbursts of pleasure sparking across Draco’s skin.
“Not many. Even if I do write new material, I rarely perform them. The audience prefers covers, something they can sing along to.” Malfoy quickly changes the topic. “What places have you visited?”
"Going straight to business, I see. I don't mind, if it means we get to have fun sooner rather than later," Malfoy murmurs, taking a long gulp of wine and licking his lips deliberately.
And when Draco grins and says, with twinkling eyes, "Wanna walk on the Brooklyn Bridge? Race you there, Scarhead!" — Harry's return to London seems further and further away.
Harry doesn’t know what’s more surreal — consulting his former professors about his love life, or said professors offering love advice.
"Even saying your name... it's enough t' make me come. I love your name. You want me to come, don't you?"
George swears that somewhere high up in the heavens, a celestial choir must've hit a high note.
"Need you in me, please," Harry begs, blood burning in blushing cheeks.
“I’m keeping Times Square, and the one of him performing in Mona’s,” Harry says at once. “And Empire State Building.”
“And you believe those stories?! Even though you clearly know that you were my…
"Yes, yes I do, yes—"
Just one word — Draco’s own name that he hears on a daily basis — but it’s coming from Potter’s mouth. It’s the first time he’s said it and it sounds so dangerous, that single word pushing Draco down this slippery slope and he’s falling and falling and losing control and it feels so divine-
Harry's heart stops beating for a second, before hammering in his chest in double-quick time.
Harry narrows his eyes at Malfoy's smirking reflection in the mirror.
"So you used to fancy him?" Harry manages, frantically ransacking his mind to turn this conversation to his favour.
He'd know that laugh anywhere.
All he has received is a series of polite thanks, as if he offered to help Malfoy mark his scrolls. He hoped the gifts would loosen Malfoy’s inhibitions, but he’s still as enigmatic and inscrutable, keeping everything so close to his heart, his words and behaviour a jigsaw puzzle.
Draco goes to the bed and flings the crumpled duvet away. He pries Potter off him and tosses him on his bed. Potter's strength and agility, even when drunk, are a surprise when he pulls Draco on top of him, sighing into his neck and grasping him around the waist. "Stay. C'mon. It'll be fun. Treat you right all night long,” Potter mumbles.
Harry smiles and returns it. She cheers, thanks him and runs back to her family. He chuckles when she whacks her brother over the head with her Dragonite.
Potter shrugs again, his attention already wandering to the next item on the pile. "It doesn't. I've had it for a long time and I don't wanna throw it away."
“Fuckin’ lightweight!” Charlie yells, before crashing in an identical manner, his body going limp.
For the third time that evening, Draco looks up from his exam questions and puts his quill down. He sniffs the air again, his mouth watering at the tempting whiff of fresh chips. This must be the castle's doing — the dungeons are nowhere near the kitchens. He forces himself to focus on plotting the obstacle course for the third years. It’s only March, but he prefers to set his questions early. He picks up his quill, his stomach growling at the thought of chips, crisp and golden-brown on the outside, fluffy inside. He glances at the towering stack of scrolls demanding his marking next. Surely there's no harm in a quick break?
"Better 'n alright, and you know it," Draco whispers, kissing Potter's cheeky smile.
A refreshing, thrilling coil of heat wells up in Harry — the sight of stormy grey eyes, Malfoy’s plump lips pressed into a thin, unyielding line, this clenching of fists is enough to transport him briefly back to their years at Hogwarts, when it was so easy to get under each other's skin.
"Soon," Potter says. He looks at the clock, and starts to gather his paperwork. "We have to leave soon; the Leaky is always crowded on Saturday evenings."
"No, Mother." Greengrass stares hard at Harry. "I'm not the one he's here for." She says it when Harry steps on the altar beside Malfoy, so that Malfoy is sandwiched between him and Greengrass.
Draco sits back down and blushes into his pancakes.
a playful voice chirps in Harry, much to his embarrassment. He nods and steps to the side, allowing Malfoy into Grimmauld Place. Marjorie throws one last look at Malfoy before scampering away to her corner of books in the living room.
Harry tries again. This time, he manages to slide his entire finger in. He moves it in and out, studying Malfoy's expression to know when to push and ease off, until Malfoy's hips are rocking together with him. When he asks for more in a soft, breathy voice, Harry adds a second finger, going even slower.
"Turn over."
"And I think I like him back just a little, you know? Er, no, scratch that. Maybe... a lot," Harry announces bravely, grimacing when something twitches in Ron's face. Any second now, Harry gulps with mounting apprehension, Ron's gonna explode in fury and disbelief, ranting and raving about Malfoy and a barrage of
"He's fucking sloshed, as usual. Lightweight," Jacob grins and punches Malfoy lightly on the arm, who sways on the spot. Harry quickly steps around Jacob to grab Malfoy before he falls over.
Draco wiggles his toes and his fingers, flexes both arms, stretches his calves out and hauls himself up to a sitting position.
good, so damn hot on all fours, on his palms and knees as he arches his back (once again, the curve of that arse) and lifts his chin, before curling his body inwards, rounding his back and lowering his chin to his chest.
Parkinson looks up, her tear-streaked face shining with hope. She utters a name — a name that Harry knows because of his brief Auror training.
"Let me take care of you tonight."
The door swings open. Draco barely has any time to react before Pansy bursts into the room.
"I mean, I'm not saying you look good only today, y'know, you look good on
Harry stays, waiting to see if Malfoy looks back at him.
Draco bites his lip and looks away. He leaves the mug alone, rinses his hands and rushes out of the kitchen.
A long, black snake emerges from the tip of Malfoy's wand, and a collective gasp rings out from the students. Harry leaves the shelter of the fountain and saunters towards the snake. It turns, its forked tongue flicking at him as it raises itself.
Draco smooths his hands over Potter's back, his thumbs skating over his spine and tracing those admirable biceps. He lowers his body, his chest pressed against Potter's back. When his heavy cock rests on the crease of Potter's arse, Potter's body tenses. A tinge of trepidation seeps into Potter's eyes.
Draco nudges further down to play with his balls, but it isn't enough, Draco needs fewer clothes and more flesh on display—
"Sure," Harry says faintly, his mind whirling at the knowledge that Malfoy turned up after all.
The faculty has mostly remained the same, except for one marked difference.
“And if I were to say there is a rule preventing teachers from getting involved? Would you give up?”
"They were talking about the wedding, and..." Harry pauses, wondering if Malfoy would run off again if he said this. "They want you to be their best man, if only they knew about your whereabouts."
"Unlike some people here, I have a heart. How bad do you want it?" The lilt of Draco's voice is teasing and playful. Harry's eyes dart towards the recorder and back to Draco. Draco licks his lips and slides his hands down Harry's Auror robe, pushing it back from Harry's body. In response, Harry spreads his legs open even further and lifts his hips up slightly, his trembling hands planted on the edge of the bed. The top of the robe slides clean off his shoulders, trapped between the sides of his chest and his upper arms.
With a smile of a sinner, Malfoy snakes a hand down between them.
Harry lets out a sigh of relief.
"Wonder what you'll do if you see me like this..." Malfoy all but
"Oh, really?" she remarks, before peering at him intently. "Potter.” She frowns, conflicted. She fiddles with her napkin, folding the corners down and smoothing them out. She repeats the motion, sighing. "If you're not over him, if you still want him, you have to act fast," she says, an urgency in her words. "Time is running out, and preparations are already underway."
Malfoy peers into the bowl, ignoring Harry, who's panting with need.
"Oh, I can definitely see what I'm doing to you," Potter says around a grin. He slides two fingers in the space between Draco's erection and stomach, nudges it towards himself just a bit and lets go.
“You’re… you’re not in this just for the treacle tart, are you?” he asks. “I’m not a fool, you gave me all this attention after we argued about treacle tart. Going to write it all off when I give you your tart?”
"Nice and blond, soft and silky," Ron recalls, guffawing. "You could put that in a song!" He wipes away his tears of mirth. "That was really bad flirting."
reporting on their memorial service. He dashes the tears away from his eyes, smooths the paper out and stares at Draco's picture.
Draco smiles to himself at the prospect of exploring new places with Harry on his bike. His grin widens when he touches his wallet inside his pocket, which contains his brand-new biking licence.
“Ron Weasley, from Magical Games and Sports, Ministry,” Ron says. “Hey, Eddie! Great to talk to you. Would love to catch up, but it’s urgent. When’s the next Portkey to New York?” A long pause, with Harry hanging onto every word. “For Harry Potter.” Another pause. “Yes,
“Nice to meet you, Harry,” she says, and then bustles off to prepare his drink. She returns promptly, wiping down the bar and setting it in front of him. She jabs a thumb towards Malfoy. “Good-lookin’, eh?”
"That's... good. Enjoy your bath," Draco shouts back. He sits down at the table, and pops a chip in his mouth.
The vendor puts away his mobile and stands up when Malfoy approaches.
Harry finishes his coffee, and bins his sandwich wrapper and paper cup. He waits until the last possible moment, and then gets up, hoisting the strap of his bag over his shoulder. With a piece of his heart left behind, Harry enters room fifteen to take the Portkey that will take him home.
Draco wanked himself raw for days after that kiss.
Harry brings him to the room next to his studio — he calls it the gallery, although it’s too small to be a proper one. The minute they enter the white room, devoid of any furnishings except for the paintings on the walls, a flood of embarrassment and shyness engulfs Harry. "They're from my last exhibition. About New York," he says self-consciously.
"All of them want you," Malfoy murmurs. At that silky-smooth, baritone voice, Harry wraps his arms around Malfoy's neck and ruts against him harder. "Your worshippers. Your silly fan club. But it's me, isn't it? It's always been me." He releases a low, mocking laugh, his thumb teasing Harry's sensitive slit. "When you sit here with your friends, I want you to think of this. Our little secret, how good I'm making you—" His words break off into a strangled moan when Harry wraps a hand around his prick, his other hand trailing to his arse, squeezing it.
"And you just decided to ignore the warning?" Malfoy points out, gesturing to the red warning tag wrapped around the umbrella-shaped lid labelled
"Yeah, just like that..." Potter says barely above a whisper after a while. He starts to move his hips in tandem with Draco's fingers. The knot of tension in Draco fades, replaced by a jolt of arousal at the sight of his fingers preparing Potter and the look of growing pleasure on Potter's face.
"I rejected the mission,” Harry says. He takes a deep breath. “And… I’ve also submitted my application for a leave of absence. You matter more to me than my job. I know I haven’t always showed that, but you are, Draco. You mean so much to me.”
Not the entire castle is tattooed, of course, but the turrets are well-reproduced, and the façade is distinctive enough. The sky is a carefree blue, the turrets coloured in their usual slate-grey and the buildings beige and brown. At the corner of the tattoo is a small stretch of the Quidditch pitch, complete with a hoop.
The world spun on its axis when Malfoy grabbed his collar and pushed him up against the wall, his eyes wide with panic and disbelief.
Harry turns his mug on the table in slow circles, and once again, that same promising atmosphere simmers between them.
"Sorry," Harry says. He looks down at his cupped hand, at the small puddle of lube gathered in the centre of his palm. "Um." He looks at the nightstand, his cheeks warm with embarrassment. He’s tempted to wipe his hand on the sheets, but Malfoy might find that too graceless. "D'you think there'd be tissues there?"
“We want you to be happy,” she says, a patient smile on her face. “Besides, it’s a bit premature to talk about things so far into the future, isn’t it? Just talk to him, see if you can work out an arrangement. You need to know how far he’s willing to go, and you certainly don’t have to rush things.”
Malfoy looks down at their joined hands.
Harry chances a look at Malfoy, whose face is a jigsaw. But he's definitely watching Harry now, and that thought — of having Malfoy's full, undivided attention on his body as he dances and gyrates and moves and thrusts to a room-full of roaring, hot-blooded men — is driving
He's pushed that feeling away once.
Harry squeezes his hand, and when he looks up at Draco, his gaze is equal parts shy and nervous.
It took Draco an even longer time to chip away at his denial and admit to himself that his feelings for Potter had developed to something more than platonic. Since Potter would never return his affections, he was content to bask in Harry's company and then go their separate ways after leaving Hogwarts, hoping that his infatuation would fade with the passing of time. Why would Harry Potter be interested in him, a Death Eater?
"I thought I'd come early. I’m glad I did," Potter replies, grinning.
"That was you, by the way. You're in my bed right now, naked and all fucked-out, my handprints and love bites all over your body. Just thinking of you sucking me off again like that... fuck, I'm gettin' hard already, even though we just had sex. I gotta... lemme get this off-"
Eventually, they emerge and dry themselves off with towels and Hair-Drying Charms. Malfoy tidies the sheets and they tumble back into bed, wearing only their pants. They face each other, tracking the changes on their bodies, the silence loaded and delicate.
Harry growls and punches the mattress in disappointment.
Draco knows what the colon and parenthesis means, thanks to his students’ note passing. He stares at the card, the roses, and then back at the card again.
Draco’s eyes open, and he echoes Potter’s squawk. He lets go of his prick.
To which Draco had replied, with his hair messy from lying on the couch and his lips turned up into a sleepy smile that made Harry's heart skip a beat, "Because I wanna be the first thing you see when you come home."
And Harry only wants more.
Sounds like a plan.
"In a messy mood today, aren't we?" Draco mutters, his breathing still uneven. He dislodges his hand from Harry's. Harry grunts in return, left palm pressed on the base of Draco's spine and right hand still on his cock, stroking it as he coaxes the last of his orgasm over Draco's skin.
Theo rattles the answers off. "No, Draco's not seeing anyone. He's got a wicked sweet tooth, I'm sure you recall the sweets that his mother sent him during school. He has a penchant for all things chocolate, but he detests white chocolate and raisins. In terms of compliments..." He pauses. "I cannot be certain, since I don't look at him in that way, but the last bloke he was with, Nicholas, I think... I've heard him compliment Draco’s eyes before."
Harry's own legs are splayed apart and he can't help but palm his own cock when he shifts slightly and sees Malfoy commanding the stage with such a triumphant expression. Each snake is wrapped around either of Malfoy's extended arms, all the way from his wrist up to his shoulder. His action doesn't go un-noticed either — Malfoy reaches down and slaps Harry's hand away from his cock.
Nothing else happens.
"I can't, because he's
Harry grins at the effusive praise. The boy might be a Slytherin, but he has the enthusiasm of a Gryffindor, probably due to Jason’s influence. Leo used to be shy, and it’s wonderful seeing him blossom into someone confident enough to offer strategies during sports.
He's trapped in a clear plastic bubble of a world, disconnected from the people around him. His anger has drained dry, leaving behind in its wake grief, depression, and another intense, screeching sort of pain that feels like it could break him as easily as a bone. Some days when things are particularly bad, Draco imagines a giant, skeletal hand reaching down his throat, all the way down to his gut and extracting everything that is good and true and
"You kinky fuck," Draco groans and cries out his name, to which Potter only fucks him even
?" Draco asks, unconvinced and confused.
“Yes,” Malfoy replies, looking rather dazed.
“Er.” Potter’s eyes dart around. “Lucky guess.”
Malfoy blinks at the greeting, which is a departure from their usual barking of last names and brief nods. The saltcellar in his hand pauses in mid-air. "Same to you, Weasley," he says, before returning to salting the chips. He darts a look at Harry, who is watching the scene unfold in disbelief.
Harry’s heart thuds with a keen longing.
"I know it’s a shock, but…" Draco presses his lips together in a slight grimace, struggling to find the words. How can he explain that in his mind, it’s Potter, and not his best friend, that he wants as a tattoo artist? How can he articulate the significance of Potter being the one to turn this blemish into something blooming and beautiful? His shoulders sagging, he tries again, "He’s the—"
"Didn’t used to be such a tease," Harry croaks.
The air is throbbing with obscene slurping noises: Potter’s sucking his cock like a fucking porn star; when Potter relaxes his jaw to swallow him down deep, Draco rewards Potter by giving his cock a few brief strokes in the same rhythm as the slide of Draco's tongue on his arse.
All songs listed here belong to their respective owners.
on his tongue. Harry's also surprised that Malfoy's a stripper even though he owns the place.
. Potter is a wonderful fuck; raw and primal, his harsh pants and sharp cries accompanying gasps of Draco’s name, like he’s a
Harry laughs. "How could I forget? You'd gobble up every chocolate dessert, especially the tarts, during dinner."
Their chests are pressed so close together that Draco thinks Harry might feel his own heart beating. Harry is touching him so carefully with delicate, tender caresses, as if Draco is a dream that might vanish any second. His arms are wrapped around Draco's waist, his fingers ghosting up and down the knobs on the base of his spine. Draco's hugging Harry's shoulders, clinging onto him so tightly as they trade kisses and sighs, whispers and touches.
"Why did you do that?" Draco's vehemence takes Harry by surprise. "I will never make you choose between you and your career! Isn't it obvious, after all these years? You'll grow to resent me if I make you quit, and where will we be, then? If you wanted me to give up my potions research, I'd feel the same way too. I don't want you to lose something so important to you!" He declares, his cheeks flushed in agitation and his fists clenched.
Potter huffs in impatience. "What d'you mean by that? I've got to make reservations for dinner. It's packed on weekends."
"I was happy to just be your friend for the remaining school year. I've actually fancied you for a while now, and I've thought many times about telling you how I feel, but..." Potter looks down at their joined hands. "But if you didn't feel the same way, then I might lose your friendship, won't I?"
Harry begins to strike up a rhythm with shallow thrusts. Malfoy feels wonderful, exquisite around him, and he still can’t believe it’s Malfoy. Years of lust, desire and pent-up sexual tension, and he’s in bed with Malfoy, blond hair on his pillows, pale limbs splayed out like this,
"I don't use the rooms upstairs, so they're under a preserving charm," he says, briefly tilting his head back to talk to Draco as they pass the living room. As Draco walks behind Potter, Draco's gaze is drawn to his jeans, admiring the curve of his arse and the backs of his strong thighs. To make matters worse, he’s wearing a black T-shirt which hugs his shoulders in just the right way.
The room bursts into applause and whoops when the song finishes, and Malfoy grins, inclining his head. For the next forty-five minutes, Malfoy is charismatic and funny, interacting with the crowd, indulgently flirting with the women at the front. He takes requests — a waitress pops scraps of paper into a small basket near his stand — and celebrates birthdays and anniversaries. Being the centre of attention suits him; he wears that familiar confidence and charm like a second skin, like how he held court at the Slytherin table in Hogwarts.
Potter eventually throws his hands up. "I can't win with him, and with you...
, Draco wants to say.
"Well, since that's the case..." Potter trails off, his eyes twinkling with mischief. Still bracketed in Draco's arms, he hops down from the table and turns around, until Draco is facing his back. He twists around to look at Draco, his eyes smoky and his grin lascivious. With his palms pressed on the table, he shuffles a bit to the right, moving his hips to nudge Draco's erection in between his arse-cheeks.
“Yes, I see that in your classes, how you promote house unity. I like how you’re granting the opportunity for students from different Houses to try out different sports,” Draco says. Part of him is very curious about Potter’s classes, ever since Charlie bounded into his office one day, grass stains on his knees and mud smeared on his cheek, raving about Potter’s “refreshingly fun” football training. “Are my students playing fair?”
is what Bacon means to give up, surrender to the music and let his body take over.
Eventually, the onslaught subsides. Potter bats away the shirts on his back and rolls away from Draco, the blush on his cheeks deepening when Draco arches a brow and removes a pair of red briefs — decorated with golden Snitches — from his chest. They sit up and look in disbelief at the avalanche of clothing and handful of trunks strewn all over the living room. Dust motes float in the air, and the room is redolent with the musty, stale smell of clothes that haven't seen the light of day in ages.
He could say no, but he’s not going to do that. It would break Harry’s heart, and that choice doesn’t make sense because at some point in time, he would very much like to get married to Harry. He could say yes, but it just feels so…
It has been one year since his disappearance.
The kiss quickly gets heated when Draco pulls Harry on top of him and toys with the hem of his shirt. He’s barely spent any time with Harry since the guests began to arrive, and it's such bliss to finally get him alone.
Malfoy straightens up and sighs at him, not in exasperation, but in something like fond amusement. “I would cut a slice for you, but this tart isn’t really for Ministry employees. It’s for someone else. No, it’s not for my own use; I’m not using Ministry resources for personal reasons.”
Harry and Draco groan in unison.
After some time, he squirms at the mess between his legs and declares, “I need a shower.” He sits up gingerly, wincing at the twinge in his lower back.
The Muggles around the pond are engaged in a variety of activities: napping, reading, talking to each other while clasping bottles of beer. There are couples holding hands, and families on their respective electronic devices, together yet apart.
"What— so...
"Hell no. Don't ever apologise for something as good as that."
mind because Malfoy's so pliant and willing under his touch, oh
Malfoy jerks. "Cold," he hisses, removing the lube with his arm.
"Granger?!"
"I can say the same for you," Draco says, lips quirking up. They quickly make themselves decent, Harry Vanishes the mess and casts a strong Cleaning charm on the table.
“Wait,” he rasps, fastening a hand around Draco’s.
They weren't prepared for all the kissing.
"The same reason why ferrets shouldn't be left stranded in rooms of Fiendfyre," Harry murmurs, finally turning back to face Malfoy.
Draco knows bits and pieces about Potter’s childhood, titbits of information revealed by Potter himself during their time together in the Academy. He knows that his Muggle relatives didn’t treat him well, but he’s hardly privy to the full extent of things, not having wanted to push Potter too much on such an intensely private matter.
Draco freezes when he hears a crash behind him, and then a loud groan.
"Come on, get on me. I gotta practise with a snake," Harry grumps, sticking an arm out.
Miffed, Draco attempts to calm down by drinking his tea, wincing as he swallows a scalding mouthful.
“Yeah!” Potter says, warming up to his theme. “Football and basketball are definitely things I’d like to include this term. If there are some kids who aren’t interested in competitive sports, running and calisthenics are also possible. I’d like to add tennis, and maybe rugby for the older kids, but I’m really just starting, I’ve still got to sort out the space constraints and demand for each sport.” He pauses, frowning. “Swimming would be interesting, but I reckon including proper exercise attire like shorts and sports shoes in the students’ packing list this term has raised enough eyebrows already.”
Does that count?
Finnigan asked at the Leaky as the group was hunched over a strange parcel that was sent to him.
He wraps his fist around the Galleon and pretends that the warmth of the coin belongs to the warmth of Draco's touch.
Draco rushes into the living room, only to stop short when the room is empty save for Hermione. She is hunched over the red embers of the coals and hissing in an undertone.
Harry waggles his eyebrows mischievously at Draco, leering. "In my perfect world, you're naked all the time."
Harry grins in triumph, and he advances with increasing speed, the tingling in his leg already gone, replaced by another burst of adrenaline sending his heart pumping. His smile fades, and his follow-up curse wilts on his lips when Malfoy smirks and twirls his wand at two suits of armour standing guard nearby.
Draco's grin grows. He loves Harry's deep bear of a voice — cheerful, smooth and incredibly sexy. Harry doesn't know it, but it turns Draco on so damn much whenever Harry leans in and murmurs filthy things to him during sex. He doesn't do it often, but remembering it is more than enough to get Draco hard.
Harry's view of Ron is blocked as the Healer changes Ron’s bandages. Harry speaks, his eyes trained on the light bulb. "Draco will take care of Hermione. You know he will."
“You have no right to be angry at him!” Hermione rages to Ron with unshed tears gleaming in her eyes. Upon seeing Harry, her expression softens and she rushes to him.
Draco’s eyes linger on the bob of his Adam’s apple.
He stares, dumbstruck, as the lid on the nearby biscuit tin pries itself open, and a handful of jammie dodgers float out, settling on their saucers. He expected many outcomes — a disapproving lecture, outright rejection, wariness or grudging acceptance, but this…
Draco twines another mouthful of spaghetti Bolognese around his fork and eats it. The pasta is too soft, the sauce too bland and watery, and the flavour of rosemary and oregano too weak. He doesn't understand why; he followed Harry's recipe down to the exact measurement as if he was crafting a potion, but it doesn't taste the same anymore.
Harry drags his gaze away from Sin and fastens it on his two best friends instead.
Draco’s first reaction is to scoff
He looks at the serving line, his eyes narrowing in determination when he spots a flash of a blond head, now visible because of the shorter queue. He presses his lips together, annoyed at the thought of Malfoy withholding his dessert.
He's kneading Draco's arsecheeks now, holding so tight onto his flesh as he fucks and fucks and
He's gonna make Malfoy scream.
Molly Weasley hurries towards them.
His thumb rubs on the word
He positions himself a few shelves away from them and unrolls the Ears in their direction.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake—“
"Draco. Let me hold you tonight. Please," Harry says, his throat clenching with emotion.
This is hardly the suave and sophisticated greeting that he is hoping for after seven years.
Malfoy’s lips curl into a familiar sneer at once, like a reflex action. “Go back, go away!” he snarls, and promptly slams the door in Harry’s face.
"Fuck yeah. Didn't know —
The guest room has been converted into a storeroom of sorts. There are a few large cardboard boxes labelled with black permanent marker: Harry's clothes, Harry's shoes, Harry's Auror textbooks, Harry's Quidditch magazines and Harry's vinyl records.
"If he does take the bait, I have a good feeling he'll pay well for me. The war orphans benefit."
Draco swallows.
"That's the Louvre Museum." Harry points to a stern-looking and massive building topped with a dark-grey roof in the far distance. Nearer to them, trees stretch their branches in protective arcs above picnickers on the green grass.
"I didn't," Harry throws over his shoulder as he stumbles away from the bar and hurries out of the club. Grateful for the fresh air and cessation of thumping music, he goes back to the alleyway to meet Bacon.
"Draco," Harry croaks, his voice breaking with anguish and his throat scratchy and sore. "Love you. Love you so much. Miss you. Miss everything about you."
sign on the door.
“I do not want to hear you say
And eventually, it does.
Draco leaps into action, pulling on his robes, and then rushing to the dungeons to execute Minerva's orders. On his way out, he runs into Horace, panting like a train and leading a huddle of pale-faced Gryffindors, who appear to be unharmed. Along with Aurora and Pomona, who are covering the other wings of Hogwarts, the older man’s instructions are to keep everyone indoors.
“They’re already clean, but feel free to clean them. Sizes can be adjusted with magic.” Harry motions to the curtained-off corner. “You can change there.” When Malfoy thanks him and moves away, Harry returns to his class, taking over from Darren. Malfoy joins them soon after, picking gingerly at the sleeves of the sweatshirt and the pockets of the sweatpants.
“Draco. I want more.”
"You're insatiable," Harry purrs when Draco collapses beside him.
"Look at how damn happy he is. Bet Potter's absolutely massive," Blaise said, gesturing to the soppy grin spreading across Draco's face despite himself.
Potter tenses, and not in a good way.
There will be a time to break, but not now.
A possessive gleam flares in grey eyes, and Malfoy hisses, a growl building in the back of his throat. He sinks his teeth into the side of Harry's neck and sucks hard, leaving another love bite that Harry will Glamour away tomorrow morning.
"Single and... looking?"
He hesitates, and then jolts into action. He runs up the stairs, two at a time, and then begins to pack his things.
Draco clears his throat and repeats the spell.
Harry squeezes his hand. “Come on,” he whispers.
"C'mere," Harry growls. The specifics can definitely be ironed out tomorrow—the important thing is he’s staying in London and Malfoy’s parents haven’t disowned him.
Draco fiddles with a corner of his blanket.
Arousal flares like fire in the pit of Draco's belly at the familiar combative mood. In a flash, Draco's on top of Potter and they're kissing again, hot, urgent and desperate. Draco grinds their hips together while they kiss, biting back a moan when Potter grinds and kisses back with equal ferocity.
"Really?" Potter rebuts, his eyes shining in challenge. Before Draco can do anything, Potter takes off his glasses and pulls off his T-shirt. At the unexpected sight of a half-naked Potter — Merlin, that chest, those shoulders
He pauses in his thoughts to slide a finger down the thick, cream-coloured invitation card, its edges gilded with gold leaf. He grimaces at the crass name of the charity auction —
Although the façade, along with key classrooms and structures of the castle were already repaired by the faculty, there were still some obscure wings, locked doors, neglected staircases and burnt portraits, waiting for someone patient and thorough enough to restore them to their former glory. Draco laboriously spent his free time during his first year repairing things here and there, until the castle finally stopped acting up.
Draco's breath catches in his throat.
“Yeah, definitely.”
George had turned to look at a horrified Malfoy, who was gaping at him through the jagged hole.
But Draco isn’t finished. "You come here unannounced, years after the war, we go out for a while, and you think you can save me, change me? There is no future for us in London! What would they say, a Death Eater and the Saviour? Go home and get your inspiration for your damn paintings elsewhere!"
And this only makes Draco want to know him even better.
"I'll show him," Draco hisses. With that, he gathers the box in his arms and disappears into his kitchen in a furious flurry of white uniform, ruffled blond hair and clenched fists.
"Yeah?" Potter croaks. His right hand continues to stroke Draco, twisting his wrist at the head before sinking back down to the root. His left hand is inside his boxers, touching himself.
"Well, did you have a good laugh with him, then?" he asks in a defeated air, his shoulders slumped as he pushes his bacon around the plate.
to him before.
for a month.
Although Draco arches into his touch, he places a hand on Harry's wrist. "Wanna come only when you're in me."
"Don't be silly," Draco says, flapping his hand in the air in a dismissive gesture. "We're good friends, aren't we? I'll be here when you need me, you know that very well."
How things have changed.
"Draco," he repeats, louder this time. Before he knows it, he's stealing through the trees, shuffling towards Draco, with his eyes wide and unwavering on the other man.
and your stupid messy hair and your green eyes and
"Thanks for today. It was fun," he says, before adding, with a hopeful smile on his face, "Maybe… maybe we could go to Shake Shack soon?"
It’s his first time inside the flat, as they spend time together at Harry's place. Harry isn’t surprised — Draco is the more private one. He enters the bedroom, his body sagging in relief when a sleeping Draco is bundled up in bed, covers pulled to his chin.
," Draco snarls, a hot jolt of lust zapping through him when Potter's thighs fall apart even more, his upper body dropping till his elbows are on the table. He tiptoes, moaning as he increases the roll of his hips, the sweet slide of Draco's prick along his cleft driving Draco out of his mind.
Maybe he hadn't been obvious enough, he thinks, wrinkling his nose. Perhaps he should have just come right out and said it
Malfoy laughs, a clear, bright sound of delight that elicits a smirk from Harry. Their eyes meet, and a buzzing anticipation sings in Harry's blood at Malfoy's wicked grin.
Hermione pauses before she lifts the warm fairy cake to her lips — not because Malfoy's the one who made it, but out of her loyalty to Harry. Ron's hesitating with his chocolate mousse too, but not for long. Hermione takes a bite, and rich chocolate flavour erupts in her mouth as the smoothest and silkiest molten chocolate she's ever tasted spills out from the fairy cake. When Zabini slides a heated glance to her mouth, she can’t help but feel flustered.
Potter enlarged the windows to allow more natural light to enter. He took down the thick and dark velvet curtains that accumulated dust, replacing them with white sheer curtains. The flowerpots dotting the windowsill contribute splashes of colour, brightening the atmosphere. The kitchen remains relatively unchanged, although Potter gave in and bought one of Draco's organising cabinets.
"What about you? I thought you were straight?"
Potter continues, "After those two years, I returned to the magical world, but only to visit the Weasleys and friends, while I trained at Muggle tattoo places." He pulls a face. "Hated the media attention, but I made sure to do nothing remarkable." His smirk widens into a full-blown grin. "Nothing scandalous when I'm just buying milk at the shops or lazing about Grimmauld, especially when I didn’t meet everyone’s expectations by joining the Aurors. Think I’ve done enough fighting to last a lifetime."
Now, Draco continues to wait, eyes trained on the door of the hotel room. He circles a fingertip on the rim of his whisky glass, with each tick of his watch winding up his anticipation levels and the beat of his heart.
, but there were so many memories that he could never outrun them all.
She dips her head, and a tendril of hair falls, framing her face. She tucks it behind her ear. Her eyes are faraway when she speaks. "He sometimes says your name when he sleeps. He reads every article that mentions you. Just seeing a photo of you with another man is enough to ruin his day.” She shrugs, a faint smile of resignation curving her lips. “And then we met you at Barcelona. I saw how he looked when you ran out. He took me to bed that night, but I wasn't the one he was thinking of."
Although Draco hesitates, he nods and stays by Harry’s side, holding his hand.
"I have calming potions at home—" Draco says. Molly nods and crouches down to fold Hermione up in a hug, murmuring into her hair. Hermione clings to her and continues to sob and mumble.
Draco falls apart.
With lust thundering through his system and his nerve endings singing with every touch, Draco lets him.
“Oh,” Draco murmurs. “It’s unlocked.”
The shirt barely hangs off Harry as he grinds his way back towards Malfoy.
Harry scoots closer to Theo and hisses his name. He’s not surprised when he gets no response; he knows how engrossed Theo can be when he’s got his nose in a book; he’s as bad as Hermione sometimes. He calls his name again, but his words are swallowed by the sounds of the lunch crowd — laughing voices, clinking cutlery, and scraping chairs. Huffing, he balls up a clean napkin and lobs it at Theo.
Malfoy is dressed impeccably in tailor-made wizarding robes that highlight his tall, lean frame. Compared to their eighth year, his hair is now shorter and un-gelled, reminding Harry of his hairstyle from sixth year. A lock of hair falls over his left eye, and Harry’s hand clenches as he suppresses the desire to smooth it back.
treacle tart — on your right."
"You'll be glad to know that we've sorted it out," Malfoy says.
"Oh, really? And what colour would my ring be?"
Malfoy lifts his legs and tucks his arms under the back of his knees, exposing himself. "Don't make me wait, Harry. Need you so bad.” He purses his lips in impatience, eyes still trained on Harry's prick. "Now, right now.”
Harry reads the rest of the letter, where Hermione talks about McGonagall's career guidance for the eighth-years and her same indecision between becoming a Healer or entering politics. He knows Ron plans to help George at Wheezes until he figures things out.
Malfoy growls, a guttural sound that makes Harry even harder. He reaches for the lube. "How do you want it?"
“No. He’s not here, Hermione. He’s not here,” Draco chokes out, slumping to the floor.
Draco pulls Harry into another kiss; a slow, simmering kiss brimming with promise and hope.
The Magpies are leading, and the game is about to end, judging by the roar of the crowd and the escalating aggression of the Seekers. It appears as if Potter is about to get his wish — Ellis Connors, the Magpies Seeker, surges forward, and there he goes; the Snitch fluttering in his hand as he noses his broom upwards in a triumphant dive, with the commentator shouting to make herself heard over the commotion. The Magpies celebrate their win by executing a victory formation in the air.
Lucius ignores her and turns to his son. Lucius’ features soften, the ire in his eyes fade, and his shoulders slump in disappointment. It’s only now that Harry notices the frailness and feebleness of the Malfoy patriarch. His cheeks are sunken, his arm quivering and his knuckles white as he grasps his walking stick for support, even though he’s sitting down. His voice is tired and brittle. “Draco. Your bride stormed out, and yet you’re still here? What will our guests think?” He sighs and shakes his head. “You’re our only son, the heir to the Malfoy line. And you’re throwing away centuries of tradition for him.”
"Perhaps I could forgive you… if you’ll have dinner with me this Saturday night?" Malfoy offers without missing a beat, lips turned up in a tentative smile.
“Okay,” he says, dragging the word out in uncertainty. “So I can chase him?”
The Ministry Obliviator did find it rather amusing—the story of Draco accidentally whipping out his wand in front of a poor Muggle customer and performing a Summoning Charm, causing a few bottles of tattoo ink to come flying into the room when Pansy said with a sigh, "My inks are in the other room."
Malfoy's eyes flutter open, revealing grey eyes smoky with lust, and Harry knows that Malfoy feels the
"I just think that this Draco person is worth a shot."
A faint scream emanates from the box, followed by a gust of wind strong enough to scatter a few sheets of parchment nearby. A large, midnight blue shadow emerges from the lid of the box, and Potter steps back and watches with wide eyes as the shadow shifts, forming a demon with an appearance similar to a Djinn.
"D'you think we're ready?" He asks, his words hushed. "Don't get me wrong, Draco, I really like being with you and everything's wonderful. Even though we fight half the time, I love it when we work through things and come out stronger than before. I think..." His blush deepens, and when he speaks, his voice is barely above a whisper. "Sometimes I think I would like to spend the rest of my life with you."
Draco had to chug a can of beer after that conversation.
"Hey, Malfoy—"
while Harry watches-
"Yes." Draco nods, his jaw set. "Five months on, and I'm still seeing her. I knew you frequent a pub called The Red Lion, located near Grimmauld. You mentioned it before, and it stuck with me because it sounds absolutely Gryffindor. I spent a few nights playing shows there, hoping I'd see you one day.”
“I… yes.”
“I am! It’s just that… what I’m concentrating on is just so… distracting,” Potter murmurs and licks his lips, his green eyes sharpening as he looks deep into Draco’s eyes. “Really… really distracting.” He lifts a hand from Draco’s shoulder and runs the back of his hand down the side of Draco’s face. Draco tries to control the longing, but he can’t, so he leans in to Potter’s touch, his eyes closing for a brief moment.
Malfoy releases a shaky laugh of disbelief. "You can't be serious. You’re done? Everyone wants to get laid, and—"
His face flames at the errant thought.
"Her appetite got worse after I left Hogwarts, but at least she was still hunting. I wanted to do something for her, so I went down to Eeylops and got them to teach me about making owl treats, and it was brilliant!"
The only thing drifting in his mind is the thought of Malfoy, wrapped in the arms of some shorter, scruffier bloke with messy dark hair, both of them laughing at something.
This is something that only Malfoy can give.
Draco shakes his head in warning.
Harry howls, a visible shudder jolting through his body when Draco fucks him hard, fast and deep, hips jerking as he sets a punishing pace. They're both ready for a long overdue orgasm, it's gonna be so good, Draco can feel it deep in the marrow of his bones and the tingling of his spine—
Draco bunches his fists up and grounds his elbows down on the table, his eyes squeezed shut. He lets out a sound of discomfort.
"He's not in Britain anymore, because of the media and… everything." She taps the card. "He's here. Only I know of this address. I don't know how long he will stay in Lisbon, so you should leave soon."
Harry exhales heavily. He's hard, but he knows that he can't do anything, no matter how much he wants to, oh
Harry lightly bumps his shoulder against Malfoy.
They look away at the same moment.
That single word, murmured in that voice in that tell-tale manner, scatters his thoughts like pinballs.
“C’mon, Humps. You want this, don’t you?” he says, his words light and teasing. He tears apart the bag and brandishes the contents in front of Humphrey.
over his shoulder while he fled.
"So, which body part is it today, Harry?" Ron asks. He points at the macaroni and cheese.
Draco raises his chin in defiance. “So what if I am?”
"Have you never tidied this place?" Draco howls in horror, flinging himself to the side and narrowly missing a petticoat to his face.
"Whoa!" Potter yelps, cupping the side of his head and swaying on his feet.
"Harry, you have no idea what a book-keeper does."
Harry shakes his head. It's not a secret that Harry is gay — he doesn't go around announcing it to everyone, of course, but Kingsley, Parvati and his close friends knew and were completely fine with it.
"Yep," Ron says.
Ron returns with another round of Butterbeers and slides back into the booth beside Hermione.
"Thanks, Hedwig. You're next, Pig," Harry says. He switches the samples to another set of treats that are smaller. Pig approaches the food with exuberance, fluttering up and down, weaving his head in curiosity at each bowl, and pecking at the samples. He takes his time, as if soaking up the attention.
"I'm sorry, I know I gotta foreplay more, but I can't wait, I can't..." Potter babbles and steadies Draco's left hip. He slowly slides a finger in him, all the way up to the knuckle.
“There are still other things to consider, but yes. Yes, I think we could.” Malfoy’s eyes are glossy and bright, his lips parted as he rakes a hot-blooded gaze all over Harry—from his tousled hair (which Harry styled to make it look freshly-shagged), the double piercings on his earlobe, and down to his body. There’s a reason for Harry’s outfit tonight; black jeans and a black T-shirt that brings out the broadness of his shoulders, the firmness of his biceps and the slopes of his chest, highlighting his physical attributes that Malfoy fancies.
This dizzying, overwhelming spectrum of emotions: a growing joy soaring through him like a bird taking to sunny blue skies, a shatter of disbelief and a squirm of unease
Harry doesn’t know what to say to that. He can’t offer anything helpful, so he wanders out of Mona’s in a daze, consumed by a slow, pressing despair. With dragging footsteps, he lets his legs take him back to the alleyway, and with a splintering heart, he Apparates to a quiet corner near the Brooklyn Bridge Lookout. He goes to the mesh where the love locks are.
Desire flits like electricity all the way from Draco's fingertips down to his toes.
Harry isn’t expecting it when Malfoy starts to wear his clothes.
And it's bloody working.
Potter's full-lashed lids dip downwards, and he smacks his lips, his tongue darting out to catch a drop of pre-come. Finally, he lifts his gaze to meet Draco's, his thumbs smoothing over the vee of Draco's thighs.
There’s a splash of water a short distance away, and Draco opens his eyes, alert. Another large ripple on the surface of the lake close to the bank, and Potter emerges from the water, clambering onto the shore—
“I’m alright, thanks.”
Harry is surprised to hear him describe Malfoy as vulnerable.
Potter’s mouth latches onto his neck at once, biting, sucking and licking, and when Potter squeezes his arse again, he buries his fingers into dark messy hair. “Is this my dessert?” Potter whispers, reaching down between Draco’s legs and rubbing his erection. Draco groans, his hands clenching on Potter’s hips. When Potter pulls away, his eyes are twinkling with mischief and an impish smirk flitters across his lips.
"His eyes were too close together, and you realised that too
Draco deals with conflict very differently from Harry, which led to dreadful fights at the beginning. Draco would refuse to engage with a furious Harry, choosing to lock himself away until they were both calm. Harry mistook it as him avoiding the issue, and it took some time for him to realise that that wasn't the case—it was because Draco didn't want them to say things in the heat of the moment.
"Hey," Harry murmurs, his lips curving up into a smile of his own. He gasps in surprise when Draco grins and presses the soles of his cold feet to Harry's ankles under the blanket. Laughing, Harry scoots closer, resting his head on Draco’s chest. Draco finds his hand under the covers, and he drops a kiss on the back of Harry's hand and laces their fingers together.
"She'll be here tonight after work. What are you reading now?"
But Harry's getting there.
"I... couldn't resist," Potter whispers, his eyes re-focusing on Draco.
It's obvious that Malfoy's been waiting. Harry notes the stiff way Malfoy stands against the wall, his posture ram-rod straight, arms folded tightly across his chest and the fingers of his right hand tapping impatiently on his left upper arm. He pushes himself off the wall at once when he sees a tall, blond man with a long nose and sharp chin entering the club. Malfoy stalks towards the other man and even from this distance, he can see the deep frown on Malfoy's face, the agitated swipe of Malfoy's hand cutting across the air as he talks — Harry knows that Malfoy rarely shows such blatant emotion, so he has to be
An explosion echoes from the garden.
," Potter suggests.
Draco looks at the dolls. "They look good together."
“You and your presents,” Harry says around an affectionate laugh. He bumps his shoulder against Draco’s and entwines their gloved fingers together. Draco tugs his black knit cap over his conspicuous blond hair and inches closer to Harry until their arms are pressed flush against each other. He revels in the heat of Harry’s body that’s so much better at warming him up than his mug of mulled wine. He inhales deeply — the Gryffindor scarf wound around his neck still smells like Harry.
Draco gestures to his overnight bag. "I'll stay with her for the time being."
He trains his eyes straight ahead, gazing towards the lit-up buildings on the horizon. He doesn't know what he's supposed to feel — relief that marriage isn't on the cards for them now, anger at himself for jumping to conclusions and anger at Harry for not telling him about it, or feeling silly for psyching himself up to be Harry Potter's husband.
“I can’t do this. I can’t,” he insists in a papery whisper. Grief, hovering like a vulture, begins to coil and gather, seeping through the cracks in his heart. He shakes his head, backing away from his workbench. He’s not ready to return to work yet, he’s not ready to move on—
"Draco, could you er, stop humping my thigh? It's not that kind of dance."
"You're so pleased about this because you like to watch," Blaise says to Parkinson.
They wait with bated breath as the chatter fades away. Malfoy stares at him, before pushing up and away from him. Harry blinks, uncertain. The interruption broke the moment, but he tries anyway. "Just now, we…"
When they were finished with the painting, Harry blinked in surprise when Dean pointed at the space beside his signature.
Slowly, his smile morphs into a sly smirk when he thinks of Harry coming home tomorrow.
"I'd rather walk," Malfoy replies instead and carries on without waiting for Harry.
"What?" Horrified, Harry sits up straight so quickly that half of Pork Chop's body falls to the floor. "It can't be the Basilisk, I bloody well killed it!" He turns panicky eyes onto Pork Chop. "Did you listen to it? What did it tell you? Did you go into the Chamber—" He stops short at the mischievous glimmer in her eyes, glowing as red as embers.
Bacon had kept his word. His mixed blood — half-Runespoor, half-Gaboon viper (the Muggle blood had suppressed the three heads and conspicuous colouring of a Runespoor) — had gifted the grey snake with the ability to camouflage himself flawlessly in darkness, proving himself a valuable asset in stealth and tracking missions. Since he was an ambush predator, many a time Bacon could be found lying alert, motionless, coiled and concealed for hours on the dashboard of a car while Harry napped in the back seat.
"Fuck, Draco!" Harry shouts. He growls, grabs Draco's hips and starts to fuck, his biceps clenching because he's thrusting into him and grabbing his hips so hard, fuck yes—
"Nothing, I just..." Draco says, picking up his trousers. He gathers the selected clothes and lays them out, before plopping back on the bed beside Harry.
Just like that, Harry falls for him so much more.
"Say my name, fucking say it—"
He scrubs paint off his skin and from under his fingernails, and gets ready for bed. He wraps himself snugly in his duvet, grabs his phone and opens his messages, scrolling past other names before spotting Draco's. He pauses before selecting Draco's name — he has to stop this habit, nothing will come out of this... stalking. They haven't spoken since Harry left, so why should things change now?
When the singing starts, Harry grins and begins to draw.
Draco shivers under his study.
"Everything. I want everything.
"I'm... not dreaming, am I?"
"Gonna blow you.”
Well, there goes the sexy mood.
Harry searched his flat during hols, but he didn’t have that specific issue. The only other person that collects the mag more than him is Oliver, so he sent him an owl. Even though they’re no longer together, things could never be awkward — they’ve always been mates, having shared the same career, and a love of Quidditch. So, they met for a drink, and Oliver brought along that issue. Harry remembers stumbling across it in an adult bookstore while he and Oliver were still together and having a laugh over it. He dismissed it as a bit of good, strange fun and didn’t think much about it, although it appears that Oliver must’ve bought it for himself.
On the way there, who else should he run into but Harry bloody Potter, looking like a walking wet dream in his Quidditch leathers?
Draco rears back, as if slapped by Potter.
"Are you going to help, or do you plan on simply letting me do all the work?" Malfoy says, adding more bacon to the pan. He glances at Harry, smirking at the Slytherin shirt. "Plates are over there, and there's milk and juice. Or would you prefer tea?"
All of them turn to stare at her.
"Sure," she says, brushing away his usual concerns at her voyeuristic tendencies. "It would do the both of you well to make him your mate," she declares, and then slithers back to her basket, curling up for her usual nap before her hunting session.
Harry pulls a dumb look on his face, biting back a smile. They've both changed throughout the years, but Harry knows that Malfoy would never miss a chance to lord anything over him.
"Imagine my surprise when you turned up today," he adds, shooting Draco a wink. He turns his attention to the owls. "C'mon, you lot!"
"Your kisses... they taste like sunrise," Draco murmurs.
"Oh," Pansy mutters, her smile wavering and her eyes wide with surprise.
"You did it! Brilliant, absolutely brilliant! Charlie's gonna be dead jealous when he knows!" Potter laughs. "It reminds me of Pig." At Draco's confused look, he clarifies, "Ron's owl. Really small and adorable." He lifts up his wand and summons his Patronus, grinning when his stag canters around the dragon.
They walk back to the house in silence and open the door, only to be greeted by the scene of Ron and Hermione locked in a tight embrace, with Hermione sobbing into Ron's shoulder. Ron calls out Rose's name when they appear, and Hermione looks up. Harry and Draco approach, and Harry notices that Hermione is clutching a Ministry envelope with a golden seal.
"I like challenges," Potter mutters into Draco's skin, his breath hot and smelling of alcohol. “You're such a challenge. Wanna win you. Make you mine."
This… thing between them breaks every rule.
Draco keeps this story close to his heart because this was the first topic that Potter and he, reintroduced to each other by Pansy five years after the war, talked about. Potter cut through the awkward silence with a muttered compliment about the article, and Draco smirked into his glass of wine.
in every way possible.
Merlin, Harry's going to list every single body part of Draco that he likes.
Malfoy's still sarcastic, witty and snarky with an attitude that still makes Harry want to punch him in the face, but Harry can't ignore the genuine affection that Malfoy directed towards his colleagues tonight. Malfoy had asked after Michael's wife and two kids, laughing with the others when Michael told them stories about his daughter's first day at pre-school.
"Shut up, Potter," Malfoy growls. "Don't you dare bring up that night in the Room of Requirement." His words emerge fast and hurried, finally unchained after three years. "I went back that night to the dorms, only for Weasley to ambush me, all angry and bitter, saying that you'd left. I fucking thought you went to the loo, not that you left Hogwarts! You just fucking left like that!” He raises his fists as if to hit Harry’s chest, but drops his arms to his sides.
Narcissa patted his hand. "We know how important this party is for Harry and you. It's a big occasion, is it not? It's the first official gathering held in your first house." She became quite misty-eyed as she stared off into the middle distance. "It reminds me of the first ball that Lucius and I hosted in the Manor right after our wedding, along with the in-laws-"
Draco returns to resting his cheek on Potter's thigh.
The rain continues to fall, and the jukebox plays a melancholy tune not in Japanese, but in what sounds like Korean. The singer is female, her voice soothing, smooth and emotional, complementing the piano and violin in the background. He doesn't understand the lyrics, but the song is poignant and wistful, as if the singer is missing someone far away.
"Yeah. But I'm glad, 'cause it's really nice to see you again," Harry says, beaming. His eyes flicker towards Draco’s lips, then up to his hair. “You wear it loose now. It looks nice.”
At the forest’s edge on the lower right side of the tattoo, there are three pairs of footprints placed side by side. The tattoo of the footprints is tiny. The feet cross the width of Potter's back, leading to a second landscape tattoo near Potter's right hip.
Harry lets out a long sigh, deep with feeling.
"I love you," Harry repeats, because these three words are the ones that he has wanted to say to Draco for the past year. He continues, his words tripping over each other as they emerge in a mad rush, "I never stopped loving you, not a single day since I've been gone. I missed you every day; I miss your smile, your massages, your healing potions that make it all better, everything. Draco, please, talk to me, shout at me, hit me, I don't care, just do something, please!"
"Thank you for your kindness and generosity, oh great one," Potter deadpans, and Draco can't help but crack a smile.
"Harry," he whispers, his heartbeat stuttering.
"My mum's letter to Sirius," Potter whispers, caressing a wrinkled piece of parchment. "She wrote about me, after my first birthday. Thanked him for his present." He pulls up a ragged smile. He traces her words on the paper, over the loops of her '
Charlie yells, "It's Charlie! C'mon, Norberta!"
Harry honestly meant for it to be just a bit of good fun, when Dean allocated him a corner of the night sky to paint. Dean was a natural teacher, patient when Harry over-blended the paints, turning the final colour too dark, and when his brush strokes were too heavy. But Harry kept at it, fuelled by determination and a growing interest, as he watched Dean's deft and light strokes on the canvas, paired with an impeccable eye for colour, dimension and detail.
With wide eyes, Harry stares longingly at the pale expanse of skin exposed with each button. He reaches out to touch, only for Malfoy to push him away again. Merlin, he should’ve known Malfoy would be such a tease. Just like him, Malfoy leaves his open shirt on, although he’s still wearing his trousers. A possessive gleam enters his eyes, and Harry watches as Malfoy crawls between his legs, his face bathed in moonlight, eyes half-lidded and lips parted. His tongue sweeps slowly across his upper lip, and Harry bucks his hips up, directing Malfoy’s attention to his bobbing erection.
Draco looks at the food that Harry has unpacked: a selection of cheeses, a hearty pulled pork sandwich for Harry, a ham and cheese baguette for Draco, and a box of chocolate macarons that Harry recommended.
Blushing, Draco had run and sought refuge in his kitchen, the good-natured laughter of his two friends ringing in his ears.
Harry shakes his head weakly. “No. Malfoy—“
Malfoy says again,
Malfoy rests his forearm on the banister, and Harry looks at the elegant turn of his wrist, tapering into long fingers that once trailed over every inch of Harry's body. "Does she love you?" Harry asks, even though he already knows the answer.
It's times like this when Draco suspects that, despite knowing Potter's idiosyncrasies, he's never really figured Potter out at all.
Harry grins, grabbing his bum. “Ferret.”
"How may I help you today?"
That is so untrue that Draco wants to laugh, but he’s too furious. He directs his anger to the topic at hand.
"Get out," Harry hisses.
“Sorry, too hot, couldn’t take it anymore. Come for me, c’mon…” Harry mutters, pulling out and nudging Malfoy’s hand away. He wanks Malfoy, hard and fast until Malfoy becomes an incoherent mess, his back arching off the bed and his heels digging into the mattress. Harry nuzzles his cheek and hisses into his ear, and finally, Malfoy tenses, the tendons on his neck standing and his abdominal muscles clenching. He’s close, so close—
“It’s brilliant,” Harry exclaims, grinning at Malfoy. He takes another large bite and chews happily on the stringy cheese, relishing the fresh and flavourful sauce.
