Harry finally picked out the back of Draco’s head two pews ahead of him, positioned at the far end next to the stone wall. His head was tilted back, and he appeared to be admiring the high vaulted ceilings of the church. Harry followed his gaze and finally allowed himself to take in his surroundings. The building itself was made of walls of beautiful stone blocks, with tall wooden pillars that soared upwards, and the sheer size of the space they were seated in meant that the priest’s words reverberated in a way that Harry found very solemn and impressive. For a moment he felt out of place again, an interloper, but he remembered the grey-haired greeter’s welcome. Clearly, at least one person thought he belonged here, even if he wasn’t sure of it himself.
Harry startled guiltily out of his chair. “Of course, sir!” he said. “Just wrapping up this last case as we speak.”
Potter continued to watch the cloud as it wound its way towards them. Draco ran his hands up Potter’s chest, tweaking his hard nipples along the way, to remind him of what he could be focusing on instead.
“Careful,” Malfoy murmured. He was looking at him closely, and it made Harry a bit nervous. “Watch how much pressure you’re putting on the clay.”
“So, Harry was hit by one of those magical viruses?” Weasley asked. “But why did it go after his memories?”
Harry realised that he was just sitting there, smiling like a fool as he watched Draco straighten piles of paper. “You know me,” he said, looking away quickly before Draco noticed. “I always support a good criticism of bureaucracy. How about I go promise our friend in Evidence not to mess up their filing system, and you can figure out which records we need to pull?”
“So, you and Pansy then?” Harry found himself saying to Ginny. She was standing on the pitch sidelines yelling suggestions at the players in the air; he had joined her and they watched the sky, side by side.
Draco merely raised an eyebrow at Harry, before returning to studying the parchment in front of him.
It was not a good plan. Harry was doing his best to focus on his wheel and his endless studies in bowl construction, but something about Malfoy’s presence kept distracting him. Malfoy kept wandering around the class, never sitting down for longer than thirty seconds at a time. Harry had actually begun counting after the sixth time that Malfoy’s rear had barely touched the stool before he was leaping back up to go and fix some clay emergency across the room.
Blaise nodded. “See, that’s at least a defensible position,” he said. “Harry, the Leaky is something to be endured, at best. I’m afraid you may be developing Stockholm Syndrome.”
Harry is tempted to mess with him, but he suppresses the urge. He can be the bigger person in this interaction; he is a consummate professional. “It feels like any other wand to me,” he says. “That suggests the problem lies in your connection with it. Go ahead and cast a
“Nice one, Malfoy,” Ron said. Having returned to his desk and taken up his paperwork again, Draco only hummed noncommittally. “Listen, Harry, I know you’ve got all this work to prepare for the trial, but Mum keeps fretting over you. Do you think you could just pop by for a quick visit or something? She keeps looking over at your presents and sighing, and saying things like ‘I hope that poor boy is alright,’ and it’s a bit much to take, honestly. It’s bringing the whole mood down.”
“That jealousy could trigger your issues with your wand.” He bears down with the chisel, causing a curve to appear starting at the midpoint of the wand, helping it narrow towards the end. Unfortunately at that moment Malfoy lays a hand on Harry’s back, and all thoughts of artistry and aesthetics fly out the window. Harry's eyes widen; his nostrils flare as he hyperventilates through them, but otherwise he is completely still.
Potter gaped at him, his embarrassment apparently forgotten for a moment in the face of Draco’s matter-of-fact delivery. “You…” he began. “You’re really suggesting that we…”
Harry was two beers in, sitting in a booth with Ron and Hermione at the Leaky Cauldron, and finally feeling like he could unwind a bit. He’d left Tran’s office earlier that afternoon with the pottery class information folded up in his pocket, and his thoughts had kept returning to their conversation ever since.
“I was early,” Harry retorted. “I didn’t realize you were already inside.” He pulled the handle towards him, and Malfoy reluctantly released his grip on it, allowing the door to swing open. Harry caught a glimpse of a nicely-fitted collared shirt and jeans beneath the other man’s apron, and he briefly wondered if he was underdressed for the occasion.
He took another drink, rather than dwell on it. Harry did like the Leaky. Sure, it was often too loud, and the quality of the food seemed to be getting worse, and the booths were actually rather uncomfortable, but he always ordered the same beer and it tasted familiar, and that was fine with him. It was almost always exactly what he was looking for, and it could be counted on to settle an argument about where to go drinking with his friends. Nobody could ever seriously object to the Leaky Cauldron.
Ron stretched. “I guess that’s something, mate,” he said. “Listen, I’ve got an early morning at the shop tomorrow—George has me coming in at the arse-crack of dawn to unload a big new shipment. If you’ve got your days free now, you could drop by and say hi sometime.”
“What are you distracting me for?” Malfoy asks, sounding annoyed. Harry loves that tone of voice, and he loves how easy it is to draw it out of Malfoy.
Through another yawn, Potter looked up at him quizzically. “Malfoy?” he said. “I had a… it was the weirdest dream.” His cheeks suddenly flooded with colour, which Draco took to be a good sign in this particular case.
Draco’s eyes darted around the room, but he visibly steeled himself. “No, of course not,” he said. “Just… unexpected. You should lead the way.”
“Come on,” Draco breathed, trying to keep his mind on his task. “Back to your reading. You’ve had your fun now.”
Harry is not actually surprised that the Manor portraits are enormous gossips. That just seems fitting, for some reason. He refrains from pointing this out, though, since Malfoy sounds like he’s building to some kind of point.
“Suit yourself!” Ginny said. “Hey, chin up. These things have a way of resolving themselves, one way or another.” She jostled their shoulders together again, then wandered off in the direction of the house without waiting for a reply.
Malfoy seemed to consider this for a moment. It was the weirdest thing to witness as they both stared at each other. “I accept,” he said finally. “But I get to go first.”
Malfoy was looking over the class, his hands in his pockets, when he caught sight of Harry. The polite smile vanished from his face, and his eyes widened briefly before he recomposed himself and turned to the remaining students, pasting that fake smile back in place.
“Those rites that you definitely do not engage in?” Harry said, trying to mask his disappointment by playing along.
, Hermione,” Harry said, annoyed. “I’m just talking to someone who happens to be a magical therapist because Robards told me to. It’s not the same.”
He gives a shaky little nod to Draco and turns back to the wand, checking carefully along its length. It appears to have settled together perfectly; he’s not entirely sure how much time passed while he was in Draco’s thrall just now, or perhaps something about Draco’s power also caused the glue to set faster than usual, but he’s not going to complain. This project has turned out to be far more intense than he ever bargained for.
“I wouldn’t have said anything even if he did ask,” Pansy pointed out. Harry flipped two fingers towards her; she responded by raising her glass and giving him a Cheshire grin.
Harry blinked at him, then looked over at Malfoy again. His partner was still pretending to be focused on the paperwork, but his quill had stopped moving, and he appeared to be listening intently. “You, uh, think that’s a good idea?” Harry finally asked Ron hesitantly.
It was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes as he went to fetch a block for himself. He still wasn’t sure what to make of this situation, with Malfoy being a bit anal about the whole thing but also apparently prepared to just.. let him be? Harry felt a bit adrift when he thought about what the next few hours looked like. He brought his clay back to his wheel and sat down, but for some reason, he hesitated to turn it on. Perhaps he hadn’t thought through the implications of sitting right in front of Malfoy, he thought morosely. It just meant more opportunities for Malfoy to watch him and judge his non-existent pottery skills. On the other hand, moving his table at this point would practically be an admission of weakness.
Draco leaned back in his chair, stretching out his back muscles, and looked over at Harry. “I see nothing to toast here,” he said testily. “Merely a slow death by papercuts.”
“No, seriously, your saviour complex is out of this world,” Draco continues drily. “You should definitely see somebody about it.” This earns him a chuckle from Harry, and he leans forward and touches their foreheads together again, reaching out to wipe away a tear that glistens in the moonlight. “Your work is important, and as long as you want to keep doing it I will support you in it.”
“We’re all going to try making a bowl to start, but don’t worry too much about the details!” Melanie said cheerfully to the group of slightly overwhelmed students. “Now, back to your wheels and give it a go!”
“This next step is a bit more delicate,” he says. The quiet is just too much. He figures he may as well keep up the narration; inviting more questions from Draco seems like it’s just asking for trouble at this point. “I need to make a small incision for the wand core without compromising the integrity of the rest of the wand.”
The woman sucked on her quill thoughtfully. “Well, now. An evidence emergency, you say? Don’t get too many of those around here.”
Draco’s gaze dipped, and Harry could swear Draco glanced towards his lips, which were suddenly dry. He licked them, then Draco’s eyes met his once more. There was something there, Harry found himself thinking. All of a sudden, Draco’s mouth was on his, and Draco cast aside the wands he was holding to grab a handful of Harry’s robes instead.
,” Harry whispered as he stared at Malfoy. His wheel revolved in front of him, forgotten, as he tried to work out the likelihood of Draco Malfoy turning out to be an assistant teacher at a Muggle art studio. It defied explanation. Could Healer Tran have known about this? Had she done it on purpose? He was pretty sure he’d never mentioned Malfoy to her, but she came off as just devious enough to make him consider it.
“I guess you have to get good at being professional about it,” Potter said. “And you were. Very professional. So, thanks again, I guess.”
“There are some minute curse magic traces in the frontal lobe region,” Draco said, for both Weasley and Jenkins’ benefit. “They’re suspicious, but curse magic can also linger for a long time. Do you know if Potter suffered any curse-related incidents within the past month, particularly ones that struck in this region?”
Potter gave a little moan at that, but remained focused on his reading. Draco lay his face against Potter’s warm back and breathed in the scent of him, revelling in the experience. He found that his hips, moving of their own accord, had shifted forward, pressing his own crotch against Potter’s lower back and grinding a bit.
“Since you cheated so terribly and blatantly,” Draco amended, “I will allow you to take me out for dinner once we’re done here to make up for it.”
It was 4 pm on the 22nd of December, and Harry was, against all odds, almost feeling bored. He amused himself by leaning back in his chair as far as it would go, seeing how long he could remain balanced on a single leg, making minute adjustments with his feet that were still propped on his desk. Yes, he supposed he could still make headway on the papers scattered around his feet, half piled, half free-range, but he had told Robards the truth: everything remaining
Surprised but pleased, Harry stood quickly and fumbled to put his coat on. They walked through the entry hall of the church, where the grey-haired greeter waved at Draco in a familiar way. Draco pushed the heavy wooden door open and called “Happy Christmas Rosie!” as they stepped outside into the brisk night air.
Potter gaped. Whatever he had been expecting, it clearly wasn’t that. “Ok,” he said slowly. “Let’s say that what you’re saying is true. What’s this book doing to me when I read it?”
“You’re sitting in front of a pottery wheel. There’s a pedal by your feet to control whether it’s turning or not, and you have some water next to you to dip your hands in to ensure your clay remains nice and wet. Apart from that, all you have to think about is what you do with your hands and how it affects the clay on your wheel as it’s spinning!” She started her wheel to demonstrate; after wetting it with a bit of water, she placed a round ball of clay in the centre. “Everyone, come gather round so you can see.”
Draco blinked and found himself back in the familiar surroundings of St. Mungo’s, sitting next to Potter’s bed. He was also obscenely hard, if discreetly so, under his Healer robes. That was probably better than actually coming in his pants, he rationalized, but it certainly wasn’t a comfortable sensation. He stood up, startling an oath from Jenkins as he did so, and looked down at Potter’s body, searching for signs of wakefulness.
“I promise to leave you alone,” Malfoy says nervously. “I’ll do whatever you ask. I’m just… I’m scared of what this means. Please. There’s nobody else I can turn to.”
By the late afternoon, they had accumulated the records they needed from prior cases, and it was largely silent between them unless one of them uncovered a new candidate translation for an unknown piece of shorthand. The whole thing was starting to grate on Harry’s nerves.
Harry met Draco’s gaze, and he was pretty sure his feelings were written all over his face. His earlier hesitation about the awkwardness between Ginny and him was gone; he desperately wanted to see the people he loved, just for a little bit. He longed to forget about Pensieves and stolen property and the Diagon Alley BIA for a little while, and instead envelop himself in the comfort of his family.
“You can’t be serious,” Harry argued. “The Tornadoes are miles ahead of everyone else; they’re sweeping the pitch every game.” He abruptly jumped as he brushed a couple of fingers on his right hand against the spinning clay in front of him. “Shit.”
Draco cursed Potter’s terrible, antagonistic dream brain. “Look more closely. Does anything look out of place?”
“Because I really can’t have you staring at me right now,” Harry snaps. “Not if this wand is actually going to turn out decent.” He tries to slow his breathing, willing himself to calm down. There’s still lots to do, and he’s got to remain clear-headed.
Harry swallowed. Draco was looming over him, radiating control, and it was extremely distracting. “Make me,” he said recklessly.
“Well, we won’t keep you any longer,” Harry said quickly, and he dragged Draco out of the room before he could make matters worse.
“Eyes up here, Potter,” Malfoy said. He didn’t bother to turn on his own, just motioned to his face. He was smirking for some unfathomable reason.
Tonight’s meal is another compromise. Every year Draco suggests they go someplace nice for their anniversary, and every year Harry says he would feel bad if he were called in to St. Mungo’s when they had a reservation. Particularly for the kinds of places that Draco has in mind, which are on the cutting-edge of the wix culinary experience and tend to require down-payments.
“I’m not saying no!” Potter said quickly. “In fact—I’m saying yes. I… I will definitely find it ‘pleasurably distracting.’ Although I’m impressed that you can make even sex sound pretentious.”
The longer the conversation dragged on, the more Draco felt he was losing the plot. Potter was showing an even more uncertain grasp of life events than he had previously; Draco couldn’t remember any other patient who had demonstrated such a flexible understanding of the linear passage of time.
"Are you sure about this one, Potter?” Draco asked, breaking the silence for the first time in a while. “BNG for “buying”? I’m looking at a document that is ostensibly an arrest report, and I don’t think that really fits.”
Still gazing at him warily, Malfoy reaches up and plucks one of his long, pale hairs, grimacing as it comes free. He reaches out and passes it to Harry, who inserts it into the test wand and replaces the panel before holding out the device to Malfoy.
Harry shrugged and took a closer look at the top parchment. It was another of the victim statements, this time from one “Ms Cecily Porter, proprietor”, and while the lettering was masterfully done, it appeared otherwise unsurprising.
It didn’t help that he was attempting to keep an eye on Malfoy the whole time, either. Not that it was particularly difficult—he mostly sat at the spare wheel and played with a small piece of clay, his eyes constantly scanning the class to look for anyone who seemed to be having difficulties. He would wait until they raised a hand before going over to them, however. Harry never bothered to raise his hand, and Malfoy conspicuously never offered him any assistance. Occasionally, Harry would look up from his latest disaster of a bowl to find Malfoy’s eyes on him, but Malfoy quickly looked away every time.
“Yes, the enormous shelf with the fuck-off ladder,” Potter said. “I’d say that it caught my eye. Did it catch your eye as well? I find it quite eye-catching.”
Harry eventually returned with Thai food from the new restaurant a couple streets over that Draco had mentioned enjoying. As he took his coat off, he could see the moment when Draco was drawn out of his focused state by the smell of Harry’s lunch.
They made their way over to the base of the ladder and stared up its towering length. When Draco looked over at Potter, he found the other man gazing back at him. “Well, what are you waiting for?” he asked. “Up you go.”
“You can engage in whatever frivolous activities you wish,” Draco said haughtily. “I intend to pursue the course of justice.”
“Harry!” Arthur exclaimed, breaking off in the middle of their conversation. “Didn’t think we’d be seeing you today.” He stood up from his chair to shake Harry’s hand and genially clap him on the back.
After the wand is sanded appropriately, Harry sneaks a glance over his shoulder. He briefly catches Malfoy’s gaze before the other man looks down at the book in his lap again, and Harry exhales. Even though he knows he told Malfoy not to look at him, he can’t deny the satisfaction from knowing that Malfoy apparently can’t keep his eyes off of him.
Harry noticed the look he shared with Hermione, because he was a good Auror and picked up on things like that. He was pretty sure it meant “Don’t get him started again” in that secret shared code that people who had been close partners for a long time developed. Some of the other Aurors in the office who had been together for ages did it too. Harry thought they looked ridiculous and took a swig from his glass bitterly.
“Now you take over,” Malfoy said, breaking the spell. He let go of the pedal, allowing the wheel to spin down, before standing up and wiping his hands on a nearby cloth as he made room for Harry to take the seat again.
“Do we need to go back to the library and get a new one?” Potter asked. “…Does the library even exist any more?”
Harry chuckled nervously. “I’m trying a new strategy,” he said. “Embrace the chaos. Don’t worry though; none of this is important. Draco ensures the chaos is prioritized appropriately.”
Harry abandoned Draco’s desk and righted his spinning chair from its spot on the ground. “Dunno. The archives, I guess?”
So Harry could potentially just go to Draco’s home and wait there for him to return. He risked looking like a loiterer, or worse, a stalker, and maybe Draco would find it weird? On the other hand, if Draco had actually forgotten his wand at the office, perhaps the pleasant surprise of having it returned would be enough to overcome the weirdness of Harry lurking outside his house. On the other
“Pleased to meet you!” she replied cheerfully. “I’m Melanie; I’ve been teaching this class here at Diaz for, oh, probably seven years now. I’d offer to shake your hand, but…” She held up her hands, which were covered in more streaks of whatever was on her smock. “Clay tends to get everywhere if you’re not careful.” She gestured to the circle of desks behind her. “Go ahead and choose any available wheel. We’ll be starting shortly!”
“What the fuck was that?” Potter asked. Draco supposed it was a proportional response to what Draco had just put him through. Potter released his grip on Draco’s hand to run his own through his mess of unruly hair. “Are you actually trying to kill me?”
He couldn’t stand it. “Fine,” Harry snapped. “What advice would you give me if I were to ask for some advice?”
Draco turned and looked. In what had previously been an empty space in the room of hidden things, there was now a four-poster sitting there instead. It was exactly the right size for two people to fit snugly together, complete with perfectly fitted sheets, and fluffy, plump pillows. Of
Harry wasn’t sure if he was expected to respond. He assumed Malfoy was talking to him, or at him, or near him or something, and just being super weird about it. He felt uncomfortably seen, but acknowledging it in that moment would just make it worse.
As Draco was still getting his bearings, Potter himself emerged from a small doorway at the back of the room. He drew up short upon seeing Draco, his face taking on a look of confusion.
know, Ginny’s new girlfriend is coming to Christmas, and it just feels… I don’t know. Seems like it might be awkward.”
“And I said to leave it on the desk when he was finished so we could review it,” Draco said slowly. He glanced at the mostly empty surface of his desk, radiating uncertainty. “Where did all the paperwork go?”
“Right,” Harry said, suddenly feeling awkward. “Well. Have a good night, then.” Face warm, he gave a little wave over his shoulder as he made his way into the alley without waiting for a response.
Ginny crossed her arms. “I think this is the first time I’ve ever heard you appeal to professionalism,” she said.
Draco considered his options. The common opinion in the mind-magic community was that making the dreamer aware that they were dreaming made interventions more difficult. A mind that understood that anything could be possible would no longer be shocked as easily. Draco figured he had a better chance continuing to string Potter along at this point.
He glanced briefly at the course listing that Harry’s dreaming brain had conjured up, but he was no longer certain that this would be a productive conversational avenue.
“Have a drink with me,” Potter’s voice said, the words tumbling out of the mobile’s tinny speaker. “Tonight. Or right now even. Are you free right now? We could go to the Leaky.”
Harry’s brain shut down as their lips met, and he returned the kiss insistently. Draco’s mouth opened slightly, and Harry pressed his advantage by running the tip of his tongue along Draco’s lower lip; he was rewarded by a breathy gasp.
Harry snorted. “Mmm, that’s a compliment I’ll treasure,” he said drily. “Real high praise from Draco Malfoy.”
Malfoy paused the motion of his wheel, allowing it to spin down. “How does it feel to you? When you’re just starting your bowl?”
“Ok,” Harry finally says. He can see Draco perk up out of the corner of his eye, because even when he’s trying to focus his attention completely on the wand, he can’t stop looking at the other man. He takes a deep breath, steeling himself. “This is the final step,” he continues. “And you’re going to need to really, er. Turn up your power. As it were. Otherwise the wand might still not work right for you.”
“Ah well,” Draco mused. “You get to hide from your former beau and receive the pleasure of my company at the same time. A true Christmas miracle!”
Harry is tired of rationalizing, tired of thinking analytically about these matters. He brings his other hand up to cup Draco’s face, slides his palm tantalizingly through the hair hanging down the side of his scalp, and Draco gasps, closes his eyes. Harry brings his lips to Draco’s ear and whispers: “Stick around this time and we can find out.”
Malfoy hands it over, and Harry allows himself a momentary fantasy of snapping it in half and throwing the pretty bastard out. He hopes it doesn’t show on his face as he balances the wand on his palm. It still feels structurally sound, which removes one possible cause of magical malfunctions from the list. Harry tries casting a
Harry handed the paper to Draco. “See for yourself,” he said smugly. It came out far more confidently than Draco was used to hearing from a dreamer.
“God, I’m sorry,” the other man said, reaching down to help him off the ground. “I shouldn’t have—Malfoy?”
“And how will you do that?” Draco asks. Harry can hear him moving closer, but it’s easier to think now than it used to be, as if Draco’s actually more interested in the process. Maybe reading the book really did help somehow.
“Being the keen Auror that you are, and knowing that I just came from the archives, you now see me looking through the contents of my desk. What might you infer about the location of the paperwork for the case?” Draco was speaking in very precise tones as he continued to shift papers around his desk.
“I didn’t want to rush you,” Draco said. “But I’d feel better if we were leaving soon. There are still so many Pensieve records to go through.”
“What?” Draco said, taken aback. He glanced at his lunch. “The flavour profile of a green curry is completely different from an egg salad sandwich.”
“This is the same Ginevra that broke things off with you.. a week before Valentine’s Day?” Draco asked. “And you’re worried it would be awkward at Christmas?”
Draco looked down at his clothes; he had arrived in Potter’s dream wearing his Healer robes, which were unfashionable and very workmanlike. Draco had learned early on in his Healing career to accept that; there were too many opportunities for his nicer clothes to get ruined while working with patients. However, his work robes had been replaced without his knowledge by… well. The best word to describe the new outfit was sleek. There was a base waistcoat, sitting snugly around his chest, with a thin, dark outer robes that caught the light as they flared around his trousers.
“We had just busted that one brewer who was making the subpar Polyjuice, and Robards told us to handle it. He said the BIA was making a stink at the Ministry about how they were being fobbed off.”
“I have another idea, if you’re willing to indulge me,” Malfoy said, and Harry looked up in surprise. Malfoy was looking at him, not the clay disaster, and he was tapping one of his long fingers against his lip thoughtfully. “I think I might be putting too much pressure on you. Let’s try again, but we’ll have a proper conversation this time.”
“You’re insane!” Potter hissed. “Your priorities are completely backwards. I don’t even know why I’m listening to you.”
Draco took his wand from Harry’s hand, and Harry felt the most minute brush of their fingers as he did so. Butterflies erupted in Harry’s stomach, and he shoved his hand back into his coat pocket immediately. He swore he could still feel the touch, however.
Harry shivered in a sudden gust of wind. There were another thirty minutes of class left after the break, but it didn’t feel like there was much point to the whole thing. He wasn’t looking forward to discussing the experience with Healer Tran, who would definitely ask about it at their next session. At least it wasn’t the sort of class that involved grades. He could just… stop doing it and never think about it again, without harming any future prospects. Unless his magical therapist took it poorly and refused to sign off on his return to duty. Then again, he’d attended two classes; surely that counted.
What they needed to do was give Potter a chance to read that book. Draco wasn’t sure what that experience would be like, but he didn’t have high hopes for Potter getting through it in their current situation.
He forces himself to concentrate, blocking out any thoughts of Malfoy by imagining that it’s Ollivander looking over his shoulder instead, passing judgement on his efforts. It takes him a few minutes to get into the rhythm of it, and he works away at the hard corners of the block with the chisel, watching them slowly get replaced by the round, smoother shape that he’s looking for. It’s going pretty well, he thinks, but every time Malfoy shifts, or coughs, or reaches out to touch one of the wood shavings surrounding the lathe, Harry has to re-focus on his task all over again.
Harry swallows. “Well,” he says, trying to focus on the work ahead of him. “Come back in a couple days and don’t make those stupid bedroom eyes at anybody else.”
“I went to that new Thai place you talked up last week,” Harry responded as he sat down. “I decided to try the green curry.”
Potter’s eyes went wide. “Oh,” he said. “Oh, yeah. Er, yes. Good.” His eyes darted to the card again, then met Draco’s once more. “God, I wasn’t sure if you would want that. After, you know. The, er. Well. But you do!”
“I’ve always seen the Aurors as a stepping stone,” Draco said gently. “A foot in the Ministry door, as it were. I’m sorry, Harry. If it’s any consolation, partnering with you has been… much better than I feared.”
“Hmph,” was all Draco had said, turning back to his paperwork, and Harry couldn't help but smile. Draco and Robards had a lot in common sometimes - they both acted like acknowledging a good thing might cause it to fall apart.
“Er, yeah,” Harry said, remembering his manners. “Fleur, this is Draco. Draco, Fleur. You might remember her from our fourth year.”
“Or maybe you should test out this wand you care so much about,” Harry says, feeling reckless. “Maybe you should see if you can maintain an
He realized that he hadn’t actually replied to Ginny, and she was giving him a funny look. “What, can’t a man have a quiet drink by himself?” he asked.
Potter grinned at him, and Draco abruptly couldn’t think of what he was supposed to say next. The silence went on slightly too long, and Potter’s smile dimmed for a moment.
Harry laughed. “Jesus, Malfoy,” he said. “Is that what this is about? You could have just had me fill out a survey or something.”
Ginny raised her eyebrows. “Lord,” she said. “You’re not dating him, but you clearly want to. This is so much worse than I feared.”
“It could be a fun experiment,” Draco says, and it’s like a switch has been flipped. Harry can feel Draco’s gaze on him again, and he suddenly has to concentrate very hard on turning on the saw and making a precise cut along the length of the wand. It takes longer than is strictly necessary; he’s going slower than usual because he keeps getting distracted imagining Draco moving through him like the saw blade, a quick, neat release, and he’s left breathing hard at the image. He finally reaches the end of the wood and turns the machine off again, and the quiet abruptly feels very loud.
“No, that can’t be right,” Harry argued. “I don’t even have my NEWTs yet. There’s no way I could be a full professor.”
“What theory was that?” Malfoy asks. The way he says it makes Harry think of tinder, dry leaves that could catch at any moment.
“It didn’t take you very long to make new Christmas plans with me this year, rather than the Weasley brood,” Draco pointed out smugly.
Draco crossed his arms defensively. “I almost turned down the Unspeakables invitation,” he said quietly. “I didn’t want to let you down.”
“Will do,” Harry promised. Turning to Draco, he asked, “Shall we?” The words died on his lips as he saw the unnerved expression on Draco’s face.
Harry nodded slowly as they continued to walk down the street. He could understand the reassurance that that could provide, given what Draco had lived through and the way he reacted to the chaos that Harry regularly embraced. “Yeah, I can see why that would be helpful,” he finally said. “Even if it doesn’t really make sense right now. I’m sure you’ll figure it out, though.” He smiled over at Draco in what he hoped was a reassuring manner.
“Melanie said to start by making the bowl’s indentation,” Harry felt compelled to point out. “Pressing down to get the clay out of the way.”
. “I didn’t follow you or anything,” he said nervously. “Not like, properly. I made use of our bonded locator spell even though technically I’m not supposed to do that except in emergencies.” Harry realised he had crossed his arms, which according to Auror interrogation training indicated that the subject felt defensive, so he consciously willed himself into a less closed-off posture, allowing his arms to dangle by his sides instead. He regretted it almost instantly; his whole body suddenly felt awkward, and he was far too conscious of how his limbs were positioned.
Looking over the ingredients arrayed in front of him once more, Draco sighs. Harry had insisted that Draco should follow through on his plans when the call from St. Mungo’s for another Healer had come through just after half three.
“I specialize in mind-related healing,” Draco said. “Legilimency is a large part of my practice. In fact, a modified form of legilimency has recently emerged as one of the best treatments for magically-induced sleep—we enter the sleeper’s dreams and deliver a shock of some kind. Something that pushes their mind out of the comfort of the dream and into wakefulness.”
“You’re lucky it’s an interesting problem,” Harry grumbles, but he’s opening the door wider as he says it and ushering Malfoy inside. He doesn’t offer to take Malfoy’s coat, and it’s a small and petty act that makes him feel slightly better. “Come on into the workshop and let me see your wand.”
“Give me details, Jenkins,” Draco said, striding briskly through the halls of St. Mungo’s. “Today, if you please.”
“They wouldn’t,” Harry stated. He pushed his sleeves up; the room was getting uncomfortably warm. “I really am very good at my job. It would be mad to let me go.”
Draco reaches out, holding his hand just short of the stag’s ghostly face. It stretches out and nuzzles against his palm, and Draco feels a tingling sensation as the Patronus fades away. He watches the space it had occupied for a moment, waiting to see if something else will happen, but the kitchen is silent and still. Eventually he turns back to the island and its cutting board with partially-chopped chicken breasts, and he resumes his measured, careful cuts.
“This way I can learn by watching you,” Harry said sweetly. “Besides, it felt weird to leave all this empty space between us when we’re the only ones here.”
Harry checked over his shoulder again, feeling paranoid. “You can’t just say things like that out loud!” he hissed. “It’s fine. It’s just a, you know. It’ll pass. I’m fine. We’re professional.”
The box in front of Harry’s feet attempted to fly through his legs, the weight of its contents, giving it enough mass to start pushing him and his chair out of the way. Harry grabbed on to the edges of his desk and attempted to keep himself in place. “Oh, how strange,” Harry said lightly. “I wonder how that got there!”
Of all the people who might turn up at the front step of his wand-making workshop, Draco Malfoy is perhaps the least likely. He has his fist raised, about to knock again, but he slowly lowers it as Harry crosses his arms and stands there without saying anything. They look at each other, and Malfoy is the first to break and glance away uncomfortably. Harry feels like he’s won the opening round; it’s sharp and sweet, and it feels vindictive but he doesn’t care.
Harry had found himself describing the problem to Hermione the previous night, and she had excitedly flooded him just after midnight. She'd announced that she'd discovered a short chapter in a compendium on magical creatures that described instances of magical core interference for Veelas who used wands. To both Harry and Hermione’s chagrin, that was when Ron had interrupted them to point out that they should ask Fleur if she knew anything.
Malfoy apparently noticed his confusion. “The clay’s on the second shelf in there,” he said, pointing at a cupboard against the wall behind him. “And yes, you can use it.”
“It’s not like that at all,” Harry continued. “I just need to take some time off and meet with a, er… just someone. We talk, she clears me for duty, and then I’m back to work.”
Harry smiled, recalling Draco’s reaction to his sudden determination to finish his paperwork. At first his partner had been full of sarcastic praise; this had turned into puzzled but cautious pleasure; finally, he had turned suspicious.
Malfoy’s voice was different when he began speaking again—it was gentler, dreamier than before. It was disturbingly reminiscent of listening to Luna when her focus was elsewhere, which, in fairness, was most of the time. “When I’m working on a piece,” Malfoy began, “I look for ways to influence the clay. It will respond to any touch, big or small, but in the beginning, I find that slow and steady pressure helps me determine what shape it wants to be.”
hand, though, if Draco had not expected Harry to remember the address after the drinks night, Harry ran the risk of looking even creepier.
Malfoy stepped backwards to let Harry pass. “I’m often here early,” he said. “When I don’t sleep well… anyways, I find the space to be a good distraction.”
Harry studies the stool, searching for any sign of inconsistency or weakness as it sits in mid-air in front of them. “Feel anything unusual?” he finally asks.
“Now, if you’ll excuse me,” Potter says, “My wife should be here momentarily, so I really must finish getting ready to leave. It’s our date night, you know.”
Malfoy turned to look at him, bringing his face a bit closer to the light. He looked surprised, and a bit wary. “This was my pottery class first,” he finally said. “If anything, I should be the one asking you that.” Instead, he just took a drag from his cigarette, not breaking eye contact.
Draco’s offer of starting an hour later from the night before no longer felt as generous when Harry dragged himself to the office at half nine in the morning. He hadn’t made any effort to decorate Grimmauld Place in a festive way; it didn’t seem worthwhile when the celebrations always took place at The Burrow every year. He regretted that choice as he woke up on Christmas morning knowing that he had yet another full day at the office ahead of him. In any other year, he would be gathering up his presents and Flooing over to the Weasleys in time for a riotous breakfast with all his friends and family. Instead, he found himself scarfing down a quick toast and tea in his kitchen before heading into headquarters as if it were any other day. Harry found himself grumbling as he took the lift to the Auror floor of the MLE building; he did not look forward to continuing to push through stacks of papers today.
“You said you’re seeing somebody,” Malfoy says, and it comes out so casually. Harry desperately wishes he could see the expression on the other man’s face, but he can’t risk it. “Who is it?”
A motion in the corner of his eye caught his attention. He spared a glance to his right, and realized to his dismay that the darkness from before was advancing along the ground, slowly spreading out to fill neighbouring stacks as it went. His mouth went dry; he didn’t have a lot of faith that they could outrun it, if it came to that.
Melanie gave him a sympathetic smile. “Oh, I know what that’s like. Sometimes you can’t force these things, as much as you’d like to. Just keep at it—I’m sure you’ll have more luck next time!”
?” Harry asked, looking guiltily over his shoulder to make sure Draco wasn’t standing there. “We’re not together. That’s not what everyone thinks, is it? Oh, god.” Had he accidentally brought Draco to the Burrow under false pretenses?
“The only reason I’m going along with this idea is that the thought of watching you search through this disaster on your own sounds even worse,” Draco muttered as he came over to join Harry. “That pile’s on my side. Get your own.”
There was another pause, and Draco refused to be the one to take the next step. Potter may not be his patient, but Draco was still the one who had pushed boundaries so far, and he wanted to be sure that Potter actually wanted this. “Well,” Draco finally said, when Potter just kept glancing at the card and licking his lips nervously. “I’m glad you’re feeling better, Potter. Do give me a ring if the fancy ever strikes you.” He bestowed another one of his professional nods in the other man’s direction and continued on his original path.
Harry doesn’t reply, but he’s still wracked by soundless, whole body sobs. Draco lays next to him, pressing himself as close to Harry’s back as he can, trying to convey support through his presence. Eventually Harry’s body stops jerking as spasmodically and he rolls over to face Draco. Now the moonlight coming through the window draws a slash down Harry’s face, highlighting one of his eyes and his other shoulder this time.
Draco turned a scathing look on Harry. “Merlin, no,” he said. “We just have to redo it properly this time.”
“Interesting,” Harry says, walking over and taking the wand from Draco’s unresisting grip. It’s a birch wand, with a core made from the hair of a Veela, and Harry gets a worrying thought in his head. He taps the wand against his other palm a couple times as he ponders, but decides not to voice his suspicions quite yet.
actually have his eyes closed, which was something. “Take my hand, Potter,” Draco said, trying to inject confidence into his voice.
“I don’t know,” Draco pensively. He let out a breath slowly while he appeared to consider his answer. “I started attending two years ago. At the time I was feeling… alone, I suppose. I found the holiday season difficult that year. The idea that there’s some kind of… order to everything that happens, an overall plan, and ultimately, the possibility of forgiveness… well, it’s a comforting idea to me.” He hesitated again before continuing. “Not that I think that idea negates any sense of personal responsibility or accountability. I believe those are of utmost importance, too. It feels very contradictory at times.”
,” Harry interrupted, his checks aflame. “Not that I’d… I mean he’s… we’re just partners. Auror partners. I’m pretty sure there are rules against that.” He attempted a laugh, but it felt forced.
“Pottery?” Harry snorted, crossing his arms. “You want me to, what, make some nice bowls? A pretty cup? What does this have to do with me going back into the field?” Tran's mouth thinned briefly, and Harry cursed silently. He always did this. He let down his guard and allowed his frustration out, in front of the one person he could not afford to slip up around. He took a breath, plastered a concerned look on his face, then tried for a less confrontational tone. “I’m sorry,” he said pleasantly. “I just don’t see the connection, and I would really rather do what it takes to return to work.” Saving lives, he didn’t say. Rescuing people like
“If I need anything,” Potter said slowly, looking from the card back to Draco. “Like… more legilimency help? I’ve been given a clean bill of health, you know. I should be fine now.”
Draco’s mounting frustration was abruptly replaced by dread. He had walked right into that one, allowed himself to be goaded by Potter just like when they were younger. “I…” he said helplessly.
Draco looked up from whatever he was attempting to decipher. “Oh,” he said, sounding surprised. “Um. Maybe next time?” He paused for a moment as if searching for something else to say. “It’s almost time for me to begin those druidic rites, you know,” he finally said, a smirk appearing on his face.
“If I were, it would appear that I have failed,” Draco pointed out. He tried not to feel smug about Potter’s bewilderment; Potter did tend to bring out unprofessional reactions in him.
Potter stood up to pull a shirt over his head, and Draco told himself that he wasn’t disappointed by this development. “People tell me things,” Potter said, waving the question away. “They say you’re a very good Healer. I have to say, those work robes suit you very well. It’s a very…
“I’m dreaming of a cloud that steals my memories?” Potter said, sounding unimpressed. “That doesn’t make any sense.”
Harry had worked with Draco long enough to recognise when he was masking his discomfort in the presence of others. He affected a breezy wave to the others in the room. “See you later! We’re going to go watch some Quidditch.”
Harry shrugged. “Today didn’t feel like a Pad Thai day,” he said, opening up the container and letting the smells waft around him. “It’s fun to explore the menu.”
“It’s returning your missing memories to you,” Draco said. “The dark cloud appears to be tracking you, and when it catches you then it steals some of your memories and hides them away.”
Harry paused, feeling wrong-footed. “What do you mean?” he asked. “Of course I do. I’m good at my job, and I’m just sitting around right now. I could be doing so many more productive things with my time.”
Malfoy gave him a narrow look, but there was a small smile pulling at the corners of his lips. “You’re doing very well, Potter,” he said, still holding Harry’s gaze. “You should try making an impression next. Nice and gentle.”
Harry jumped and tried to think about anything except boning. It proved surprisingly difficult, and he silently cursed Ginny’s power of suggestion. “Oh!” he exclaimed nervously. “How long have you been standing there?”
This wasn’t the first time he’d been contrary out of habit, only to have her take him seriously. He didn’t know how he felt about it. “Er,” he said, stalling as he tried to remember things that he liked to do. Some kind of activity where he could at least have some fun while he waited for this stupid administrative leave to be resolved. “Flying?” He hadn’t touched a broom for… years, probably. It wasn’t an efficient way to travel.
revealed that it had already gone quarter past six, and his stomach rumbled in protest. “I don’t know about you,” he said to Draco, as he leaned back in his chair, “but I could use some supper about now.” He took a breath, steeling himself. “Want to go to that Chinese place you like so much?” Harry was proud of how casually it came out. Just one work colleague inviting another work colleague to have dinner together after work. Nothing wrong with that; it was perfectly normal. It didn’t matter that the one work colleague had an appallingly obvious crush on the other one. It was fine.
His finger paused in its movement, and then Malfoy was digging into the clay once more. Gently tugging the brim of the bowl towards him to widen it, he would occasionally switch to deepening the impression in the middle of the bowl, maintaining some kind of symmetry between the two that Harry couldn’t fathom. If Malfoy had been allowed to sit at his wheel and work this kind of magic during the classes instead of helping out the other students, Harry wasn’t sure he would have been able to take his eyes off him. He found the effect mesmerizing, seeing the essence of a bowl emerge out of Malfoy’s delicate ministrations.
It was tempting to start drinking and try to forget everything he’d just allowed to spill out. “I need to go back to the office later and get some more work done,” Harry said remorsefully. “I should probably keep a clear head.”
Harry looked back over his shoulder at them as he neared the Leaky’s exit—they had shifted to one side of the booth with Ginny in the middle, so she could fit her arms around both of them and they could rest their heads on her broad shoulders. He watched Pansy’s lips move, and the other two laugh in response, quick and delighted. He turned away and walked out into the night before they could catch him staring.
Draco had the sinking feeling that whatever that spreading cloud of darkness was, it was actively feeding off Potter’s memories. If that was true, then Potter’s ill-timed nap was almost certainly related; memory modification turned out to be much easier while the victim was asleep, with only their subconscious mind as the last line of defence.
“I’m just saying, I would have brought my invisibility cloak along if I’d known,” Potter groused. After a furtive look around the library, he stepped over the chain at the entrance to the section; it honestly did very little to keep students out, in Draco’s opinion.
“A bed,” he said decisively. “We need something more comfortable.” He pointed behind Draco. “I think that one should do, don’t you?” he asked, sounding smug.
“Well,” Draco said later that afternoon as he stood and stretched. “That’s it. I’ve finished redoing every single witness statement, and I’ve verified all the Pensieve timecodes for quick retrieval during the trial if necessary.”
Harry felt himself flush at the praise, and he buried his head back in the paperwork. This forced closeness as they spent hour after hour together was a change from their usual routine, where they would usually work on cases together but split up responsibilities, and they would be in and out of the office at different times as a result. Whether it was the proximity, or the pressure to wrap up this case as soon as possible, he was finding it more and more difficult to hide how Draco made him feel.
Harry swallowed. “Then I choose you,” he said, reaching out to take hold of Draco’s hand and interweaving their fingers. “Now take your stupid box and stop distracting me from finishing this awful paperwork so we can go to dinner.”
watching seizures,” Harry says angrily, and it’s the first thing he’s said that doesn’t come out toneless or sad. “I hate when
“‘The economic impact alone!’” Harry said, imitating the nasal tones of the president of the Diagon BIA. “‘The streets aren’t safe to travel any more! We’re losing the goodwill of the public!’”
?” Harry asked. “If you insist!” He turned the small boy over until his head was dangling just about the ground while Harry kept a firm grip on his ankles.
The light situated above the studio door blinded Harry as he stepped out into the dark of early evening, but he could make out a dim Malfoy-esque shape leaning against the wall further down the sidewalk. A small light flared in the vicinity of Malfoy’s hand, and he watched as Malfoy brought it near his face, briefly illuminating a cigarette sitting between his lips. He lit it before extinguishing the flame in his fingers, and Harry watched as he expelled a small cloud into the night air.
“There’s a class tomorrow evening that I want you to attend,” Tran said, interrupting Harry’s reverie. That was different than normal. She unsteepled her fingers in order to push a piece of paper across her desk. “It’s a pottery class for beginners. Non-magical, but the teacher is a witch.”
Harry raised his head from his contemplation of his beer glass to find Ginny leaning against the side of his booth. The Leaky Cauldron was hopping; Ron and Hermione had abandoned him a good thirty minutes earlier, saying they didn’t want to keep their babysitter waiting too long, but Harry hadn’t been ready to pack it in for the night. He’d ordered himself another drink and nursed it, watching the other patrons without trying to be obvious about it. He felt jittery, like he was waiting for something to happen. He’d thought about trying to chat someone up, bring them home to distract himself, but honestly, the Leaky was the wrong place for that. He was far, far too recognizable a presence here, and he didn’t really want to attract that kind of attention.
“I guarantee you that you’re wrong,” Draco said, putting steel into his voice. “The last time that The Prophet wrote about your marriage, it was about how the divorce proceedings were going.”
Malfoy eyed him again as if considering how much to say. “After the trials, I had a Muggle society integration specialist as a condition of my parole,” he finally said. “He made me do a bunch of different activities to show that I could be a ‘functioning and contributing member of society.’ One of those was some art classes through the studio here; he knew Melanie, and I guess this place has gained a bit of a reputation as a halfway house for people like me.” He smiled self-deprecatingly. “Anyways, the art was the first thing that really felt right to me, so I kept taking more classes. When Melanie was looking for some help, I volunteered in exchange for studio access.”
Malfoy pursed his lips, and the sight made Harry want to laugh. “No,” Malfoy said. “Why did you say the other day that you needed to take the class?”
“Listen, it’s kind of difficult to explain everything in these surroundings if you catch my meaning,” Harry said defensively.
Potter gave him an odd look. “It was all over the papers last year when we got married; I’m surprised you missed it.
“I learned my lesson last year!” Harry replied, leaning back in his chair once more and carefully putting his feet on the desk around the mounds of parchments. “Draco just went down to the archives to file our final summary for the forgery case. Everything else can wait until the new year, I promise.”
Potter shuddered in a gratifying manner. “Fuck,” he finally said. “I just keep thinking about losing my memories again; it’s really killing the mood. I don’t think I can concentrate on reading while it’s here.”
Harry’s face cleared. “Oh, that’s alright,” he said, magnanimously. “I remember being that age. I’m just sorry that you had to come all this way for nothing.”
“Pottery! That’s great!” Hermione said excitedly. “Ron and I did a few beginner sessions a couple years ago as a date night. You might find that you really enjoy it!”
Harry knew Draco’s moods well by now, and he could practically see the other man biting his tongue. “Hypothetically,” Draco said, far too calmly. “Use your imagination. Say there was a desperate need for someone with a lot of experience with this department and they’re not here. What then?”
“It’s probably because I was a Death Eater,” Malfoy says calmly, and that takes a bit of the wind out of Harry’s sails.
“—but doing this? Helping out at the studio forever? No. Circumstances change. Interests change. People change.”
The afternoon is exactly as long and boring as Harry expects, but at least he gets to watch Malfoy become flustered and annoyed when a wand refuses to cooperate with him. If he’s being honest with himself, he doesn’t mind being able to look at Malfoy all afternoon either. He’s objectively handsome; his high and tight haircut appears to have been retouched recently so the shaved sides are nice and short, while the rest of his hair hangs along the top of his scalp. The earlier hurt and anger Harry was feeling has gradually given way, replaced by something else that Harry chooses not to examine too closely. It’s not hope—he refuses to let himself be taken in again, since Malfoy clearly doen’t want what Harry wants. But it’s surprisingly enjoyable to be around the man. Harry wonders what they would be like together if there wasn’t this mystery hanging between them.
It feels more intimate this time, strangely, as Draco gently soaps Harry’s back and down the lengths of his arms. “It’s all right,” Draco tells him, murmuring it like a charm. “You’re here with me now. I’ve got you.” Harry gives a little shudder as he says it, but he also reaches behind him to clutch Draco’s waist tightly and pull him closer. Overall, Draco feels like his attempt at a reassuring monologue is doing more good than harm, so he continues whispering comforting platitudes as he lathers up the remainder of Harry’s broad backside.
“All right,” Harry said. He was vaguely relieved that he wouldn’t have to negotiate any more misunderstandings about his and Draco’s relationship today. “We can slip away, in that case.”
Harry licks his dry lips. Malfoy looking at him like that is doing things to him, and he isn’t looking forward to the next couple of hours. Well, rationally, part of him is dreading it, but there’s a significant portion of his brain which is rubbing its hands together in anticipation.
Harry rolled his eyes and started to read. After a few moments of struggle, he looked up and met Draco’s eyes.
“I don’t care,” Harry says quickly. “Just ask me questions or something.” He bites his lip as he pushes the chisel along the length of the wood again.
“What?” Harry asks. All thoughts of taunts are gone; he’s tense, ready to intervene if something dangerous occurs.
“I want to taste you,” he says. His mouth is watering at the thought. “I'm going to press you up against that wall and run my tongue along every inch of you. You’ll be shaking by the end, desperate for me to bring you off. Is that what you want?”
“I’ve been meaning to thank you, Harry,” he said seriously. “I had something today that I wasn’t expecting—my aunt has invited me for tea with my cousin on New Year’s Day. I’m not sure if or when we might have reconnected if not for you insisting that I accompany you today.”
“Huh,” Harry says. Against his better judgement, his mind is already working on possible tests they could run. He’s always found it difficult to resist a good mystery. The little Hermione voice in his head points out that this is doubly true when it comes to Draco Malfoy, but he ignores her.
The next time, Harry conjured some fairy lights while Draco went to put the kettle on. They were both consuming an alarming amount of tea and were taking it in turns to obtain refills. Harry used the opportunity to stick the lights all over the wall behind Draco, and when his partner returned and deposited Harry’s mug before sitting back down, he appeared none the wiser.
“You know, he’s right,” Blaise said, turning to look at Pansy once more. “I can’t imagine why we didn’t tell him about it before. He’s taking it so calmly.”
“I reserve my judgement until afterwards,” Draco said pompously, and Harry couldn’t help but chuckle.
Harry scrubbed a hand across his face. “It made sense at the time,” he said. “I’ll put a question mark next to it, I guess, unless you have a better idea.”
“It’s not what it looks like,” Harry protested. “Ron and Hermione were here earlier and they didn’t take their glasses back to the bar. Those two have been keeping me from going out of my skull with boredom; it’s very decent of them.”
Weasley shrugged helplessly. “Not that he told me about, but also, it’s Hogwarts, you know? Not that anybody would intentionally curse a professor, but there’s a lot of magic that goes on there.”
“Now,” he said, as he stepped in front of Harry, crowding him back against his desk. “Return my box. Your underhanded theft has only delayed my inevitable victory.”
Harry desperately refocuses on his chiseling—there’s now a sinuous groove starting at the head of the grip and extending all the way to the wand’s tip. It’s serpentine, and Harry hopes that Draco will appreciate the Slytherin touch he’s added.
“What?” Malfoy said, seemingly baffled. “No, Potter. You can always leave if you want, of course. But if you prefer to stay, we could keep trying other things.”
Draco eyed Harry, seemingly weighing something. “My mother lives in the Italian countryside,” he eventually said. “ When I visited her three years ago, it was like… it was like she had recreated the life she had here, as closely as possible. Without my father, for obvious reasons, but still. I have no interest in being part of that, not after everything.”
“Fuck off,” Harry said, but there wasn’t any heat in it. He kept his gaze on Malfoy, resisting the urge to look down at his wheel. He would show Malfoy that he could do… whatever this was.
“Yes, yes, go ahead, Potter,” Draco said drily. “Put your wholesome boy hero status to good use for once. I’ll remain here in the document mines.”
“You have posh drinks with your Slytherin friends,” Harry tried. He walked over to his chair and sat down in it, to at least provide the illusion that he was about to start his paperwork at any moment. “You all meet up in a place with real silver and eat tiny portions of deconstructed Christmas dinner.”
Harry settles his head back against Draco’s shoulder, and they stand under the stream together. “There was…” he begins, haltingly, but Draco can barely hear him over the rushing water before he trails off again. “Sorry,” he finally says. “I didn’t want to…”
“Thanks,” Harry replied nervously, wondering what he was getting himself into. He walked quietly towards the space where the service was taking place, feeling like he was intruding merely by being in the building. When he reached the doorway, he glanced inside - the main sanctuary was a high, arched room, and  pews lined both sides of the long aisle. They were well packed with attendees, and at the end of each row there was a wreath and a lit candle, the flames dancing merrily in the warm air.
Potter let out a sound of disgust. “Slughorn is a terrible professor,” he said. “But fine, I’ll touch all of the books and find the one that gives me a shock.” He ran his hands along a third of the books crammed into the shelf before he suddenly jerked his hand away. “I felt it!” he said, shaking his fingers out a bit as he looked down at Draco triumphantly.
“Ok, here’s what’s going to happen,” Harry says, desperate to regain control over the situation. “You’re going to ignore what I’m doing and read one of my books on wandlore. You were a swot in school, I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.”
Draco looked him in the eye, then opened his mouth and slammed Potter’s cock forward until Draco’s nose was tickled by the dark hairs at the base. Potter moaned as he was deepthroated, a breathy, urgent sound that lit Draco up, and the fist in Draco’s hair tightened deliciously. Draco held Potter’s dick at the back of his throat for a long moment, then pulled back just before he could feel tears starting to form in the corners of his eyes. He kept watching Potter’s face as he began to jack him off again, with quick, urgent motions.
Draco wracked his memory for any similar cases that he’d treated that might suggest further tests to perform. As he pushed open the door to the patient’s room, Jenkins added, “Also, you should know one more thing, he’s—”
“In every piece that’s ever worked out for me, there’s a moment when I’m coaxing some form out of it and it just… connects,” Malfoy continued. “For me, it’s like brewing a potion—when you add a particular ingredient, or you stir it just the right number of times, in the right way, and it reacts exactly as you expect. There’s a harmony when I’m working with clay, and I feel it from my fingers all the way up my arms and into my chest. When I know precisely what will happen when I touch a particular spot.
“I’m nearly there,” Potter said tightly. “I just...” He stilled again, and Draco felt the other man’s stomach muscles clench. He looked up at Potter’s face; he was looking out at the surrounding darkness once again.
“What happened to the last one?” Malfoy asks, his lips curling up into a smile. “Were you… careless with it?”
It’s not that he didn’t trust that the other Aurors would continue to make headway on their cases in his absence. It just never really felt like anybody else
“It worked,” Harry says. He licks his lips, slowly, just to see what happens, and is pleased to see Draco swallow in response. “You’re not causing this. Do you understand? I want you.
Draco opened his eyes and found himself in a room that was recognizably Hogwarts. A fire crackled away merrily in the hearth, surrounded by stone walls, while a large solid desk absolutely covered with loose sheaves of parchment sat in the middle of the room; it was otherwise sparsely decorated.
“Aha,” Draco said, sounding viciously pleased. “Yes, that would fit quite nicely. Excellent deduction, Potter.”
“Just testing your powers of recall,” Draco said. “It certainly appears as if we were able to avert any lasting damage to your memories.”
Harry couldn’t think of a reason that Draco would intentionally leave his wand behind at the office. Harry certainly kept his with him at all times; while his fourth year Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher may have turned out to be a disguised criminal, the mantra of “constant vigilance” had imprinted itself over the years that followed. Harry never wanted to be caught unprepared. It was hard to imagine Draco choosing to live differently, given everything he had been through as well.
Twenty-five minutes later, Harry was bored. He’d never actually been good at the waiting and observing parts of being an Auror; those in charge had quickly realized that he was most useful for the bits when resistance was expected, or a chase might be necessary. He had never really got the hang of reading newspapers, either, so he couldn’t even distract himself effectively. Malfoy still hadn’t appeared; trust him to be late to his own… whatever this was. Harry decided to wander past the studio just to make sure everything looked in order.
“Merlin, Potter,” Malfoy said, breaking into his crisis of confidence. “I’ve seen you use your pedal before. I didn’t think I had to provide you step by step instructions.”
Frustrated, he carelessly tosses the wand into his box of other failed experiments and returns to his workbench. He collects the wood shavings surrounding his lathe and vanishes them, perhaps more aggressively than is strictly necessary. It's satisfying, though. He replaces his chisels on their wall mount and sits down on his stool, staring out the window of his workshop as he contemplates what he can do to get out of his slump. He has spent several months focusing on turning wands using Muggle woodworking techniques, with as little magic involved as possible, and unfortunately that means that much of the existing wand lore out in the world that might otherwise help him is useless. Perhaps it’s time to give in and return to the traditional wand making forms that Ollivander taught him during his apprenticeship. It’s just that he finds them so restrictive; there’s no room for creativity. Ollivander chided him whenever he decided to follow his gut, experimenting with new woods or cores instead of sticking to the prescribed ones. As soon as Harry had finished his apprenticeship he’d decided to focus exclusively on his experiments.
“And now what?” Draco asks from just over his shoulder, and Harry shudders. Maybe Draco is just leaning forward to get a better look at the wand, he thinks.
“I think we can afford a short break,” Draco said, and Harry felt a big smile break out on his face. “Shall we?”
Draco took a deep breath, and it appeared to steady him somewhat. “Do you remember that Diagon Alley thief from the summer?”
Harry headbutts him gently. “Berk,” he says, and it comes out fondly but he’s also sniffling a bit again.
“Fuck,” Potter said, squeezing his eyes shut, then opening them again as if he couldn’t bear not to look at Draco while this happened. “Fuck me.” Another long blink, before his eyes popped open again with a sudden look of concern. “But wait, you didn’t get to—”
“Alright!” Melanie said cheerfully. “Is there anything you’d like me to fire in the kiln? You can collect it at the next class.”
“Oh,” Harry said, and he looked vaguely disappointed for some reason. “I guess that makes sense. You must deal with all kinds of weird stuff as a Mind Healer.”
“Let’s focus on what actually happened,” Draco prompted. “What do you remember doing before you woke up here?”
“Those children will be so disappointed this year,” Draco said drily. “What a monster I am for depriving them of this experience.”
“Oh,” Harry said. He felt vaguely embarrassed for assuming… he didn’t know exactly what it was he’d thought. Malfoy’s reactions kept surprising him.
“No,” Potter said, shaking his head. “My door was closed, and it squeaks really loudly as it opens. I would have noticed somebody coming in.”
“What we need is a decoding spell,” Harry said morosely. “What good is magic, anyways, if it can’t even do what we need?”
“Ok, bowl time,” he muttered to himself. He would make a few silly things and bring them to show Healer Tran at their next session, and then they’d spend some time talking about how it was such a productive activity and how relaxed he was now. Then she’d sign off on him returning to duty and he could get on with his life again. He was going to ace the next therapy session, he decided.
“And how’s that working out for you?” Malfoy asked. “Melanie has probably made hundreds of bowls at this point, if not thousands. She has it down to muscle memory by now.” He moved his hands, cupping them on either side of the clay without actually touching it, then adjusted his left thumb and two fingers on his right hand to lightly press at the centre. The clay seemed to melt away beneath his gentle touch. Harry stared, captivated by the way his fingers slowly but inexorably carved out a depression, as the clay yielded to his will.
“Not that I doubt your conclusions, exactly,” Malfoy begins as he steps over the threshold, and Harry gives a little snort because that’s a great fucking way to start a sentence. “But I decided to do a little research into my family’s history to see how this… situation could be possible.”
Malfoy took another inhale of his cigarette, then blew it out without saying anything. The silence quickly grew uncomfortable, and Harry started to have second thoughts. If this really was Malfoy’s life that he was intruding upon, he didn’t have to make a big fuss about it. Merlin knew Harry could relate to a desire to keep a low profile, sometimes.
Draco abruptly decided that their current position was insufficient for the purposes of tormenting Potter. “Straddle me,” he ordered, laying down on the bed. “If you can talk coherently, I’m not doing my job correctly.”
Draco shifted his weight, staring at the bed. This was actually nothing like picking up someone in a club, he decided. This was like picking up someone in an office in the cold, harsh light of day. This was a terrible idea.
Malfoy fiddled with a heavy metal lighter as he considered the question. Harry watched his long, delicate fingers flick the lid back and forth across the top. “I needed something to do with my hands,” Malfoy said eventually. “When they took away my wand for that first year… well, let’s say I found it challenging and leave it there.” He waited a moment, before adding, “Also my father absolutely hates it.”
“June, I think,” Harry said, spinning slowly in his chair and looking at the ceiling. “It was in the middle of that string of underground brewery busts.”
“You’re such a git,” Potter said, gritting his teeth. He shifted how he was holding the book so that he could keep an eye on Draco’s oral activities.
“Hmm,” Malfoy said. It was just one syllable, but Harry knew he was looking at the remnants of the perfect bowl that he’d started and that Harry had ruined. Harry felt a surge of embarrassment; why had he ever thought that this was a good plan?
Potter turned back to the bookshelf, muttering something that Draco was pretty sure was not complimentary. Draco stared up at him, willing himself not to look at the encroaching darkness. It wouldn’t help, and it might even make things worse, if it truly did feed on attention. He focused instead on observing the lines of Potter’s backside, which was several rungs higher than his head and therefore unavoidable, really. It truly was unfair that Potter remained in top physical condition even as a school professor.
It was a quiet day; even lunch was subdued despite their new tradition of swapping portions. Harry came back from the outside world carrying Chinese takeaway, and Draco already had a sandwich half set aside for him without even putting up a token argument about the incompatible palates. He accepted a helping of Harry’s Mushu pork with a grateful nod of his head but otherwise acted distant towards him.
Draco fiddled with the sleeve of his coat. “I’ve never met my aunt. My parents never spoke of her when I was growing up, and I thought about contacting her after… you know. Everything.” He exhaled, sending a puff of breath out into the cold air. “It seemed too presumptuous. She cut off all ties with my family; I figured that if she wanted to reconnect, it would have to be her choice.”
“Not sure when I’ll be home,” the stag says using Harry’s voice. “There was an Auror incident and we keep admitting more patients. Sorry. I’ll make it up to you.”
Draco’s current working theory was that it either fed off of Potter’s attention somehow, or the sustained focus of a particular dream environment. Maybe if they kept moving it wouldn’t bother them, or perhaps that was just coincidence. Unfortunately, in Draco’s experience, dream motion was too unpredictable to be relied upon indefinitely. Sometimes the dreamer would just be transported to their destination immediately; other times their dream brain might focus on the journey, but there would just be indeterminate, liminal spaces between the two points.
Draco barely kept from laughing at that; he was pretty sure it would have come out a bit wildly. He glanced around them; the darkness had advanced down their aisle almost to the base of the ladder, but Potter
Draco was tapping rhythmically on his desk with his free hand while he read an evidence report intently, occasionally making marks with a quill with his other hand. Harry found himself getting lost in the sound of Draco’s fingers; it felt like rain on an attic roof, with no discernible pattern but nonetheless soothing. He fondly noted the way Draco stilled for a moment when he found what he was looking for; then the tapping would accelerate when it resumed.
Draco had to refrain from rolling his eyes; the man was a willfully oblivious fool. “Listen,” he said, as Potter appeared to have every intention of just striding away in a huff. “I am only going to tell you this once, and then I am going to walk away and we don’t ever have to discuss it again.” He took a quick breath before plunging onwards. “I chose my… method… for extracting you from your dream mostly because I was desperate. But also I think we may have been flirting? Earlier in the dream, I mean.” Despite his mother’s loathing of the habit, he found himself biting his lip again. He hated exposing his feelings this way, like some kind of emotional exhibitionist, but there might not be another way to get the message through Potter’s extraordinarily thick skull. “Dreams are strange beasts,” he continued, “so I’m not going to read anything into it. However, here’s my card if you need anything from me in the future.” He grabbed a business card from his coat pocket and handed it to Potter, who stared at him.
It was a straightforward plan. Well, about as straightforward as any plan that involved delving through Potter’s unconscious mind could be. Draco was depressingly confident that Potter would continue to find ways to make his life difficult.
“Yes,” Harry hisses. His cock is hardening at a rate that is almost alarming, and he has no idea what to do next. “Don’t stop,” he whispers. The hand in Harry’s hair slowly tightens into a fist, and Harry’s brain stutters as Draco gently but firmly tugs on his hair. “Christ,” he pants once he’s able to form coherent words again.
Harry looked guiltily at the stack of papers that remained on his desk. Truthfully, there was nothing he’d like to do more than skive off, but at the rate he and Malfoy were going they were going to be in it for the long haul. He really wanted to be done with work before New Year’s Eve so he could actually have a few days off.
“And you’re one of the most obstinate, stubborn men I’ve ever met!” Draco retorted. “You barely even listen to me as it is, even though I’m the only one of us who knows what’s going on.”
Molly’s head appeared around the doorway to the kitchen. “Harry!” she cried. “I was so worried about you!” She bustled out, wiping her hands on her apron before giving him a big hug.
Just to confirm, he circled the church, first checking that he wasn’t being observed. He didn’t want to be reported for suspicious activity around a Muggle religious building. The locator spell was unquestionably pointing him towards the church, insistently tugging him towards the front doors. Harry wondered if he should just wait outside for the service to end, but the night was only getting colder, and his initial warming charm was already starting to fail. He nervously approached the heavy wooden doors and pulled one open just enough to see inside.
Ginny slid into the booth opposite him, placing her glass on the table in front of her. “He could,” she admitted. “But that doesn’t really explain the other five empties.”
“What do you mean it doesn’t matter?” Potter hissed at him. “It’s clearly.. I don’t know, malevolent or something. And it’s coming toward us.”
Potter rolled his eyes, but he stepped onto the bottom rung of the ladder and began to climb. “This is a terrible idea,” he warned as he scaled it. “If we get in trouble for it, I’m pinning all the blame on you.”
“Ugh.” Potter flopped backwards across the sofa, throwing an arm over his eyes. “Must we do this now?”
“Well then, let’s get started!” the teacher announced. “Welcome to Beginning Pottery night at Diaz Fine Art Studio! Those of us who spend a lot of time here just tend to call it Diaz, though. We run these nights to show members of the community what our space can offer; I’m a member of the studio, so I get to use the equipment here whenever I like. That means the painting supplies, sculpting tools and modelling clay, the drafting board in the corner… anything you see, really. If you find that you’re enjoying this class and you want more opportunities to practice on your own, there’s information about becoming a member in the pamphlets by the entrance. I’m also happy to answer any questions you might have during the break." She smiled invitingly at all of them, then clapped her hands. “Enough boring stuff, though! Let’s talk about pottery!” A few students dutifully chuckled.
“See?” Malfoy said, looking amused. “It’s not that difficult. Now, I’m going to ask you some questions, and you’re going to answer them, and while you’re doing that, if the urge strikes you I want you to reach out gently and shape your clay. That’s all.”
“I want to bend you over this table,” he says, panting now. “I want you under me, here in my workshop. You’ll leave here and every time you smell wood shavings you’ll think of me.”
“You know what I do for Christmas,” Harry said, rather than dwelling on that thought. “Why is this such a secret?”

The downside of dreams was that they were largely driven by the attention of the dreamer. Like watching a Pensieve memory, the surroundings tended to get fuzzy at the edges when the dreamer stopped looking at something. It meant that non-dreamers would often get swept along by the dreamer’s whims, which in Draco’s experience could make for frustrating interactions.
Draco frowned. “Yes, well, I notice that my side of our office is noticeably more spirited than your side,” he said.
“Exactly,” Draco said. “You understand me perfectly.” His grin widened as he indulged Harry in this private joke, and Harry felt a warmth growing inside of him. Draco’s smiles were his only weakness. Draco’s smiles and being praised by him. Well, his smiles, his praise, and maybe his playful insults, as weird as that was. Merlin, he was far gone.
He had the general shape of what to do next outlined in his head—this was the kind of twisty case that he had built his reputation as a Mind Healer upon. Clearly, he needed to investigate the problem of Potter’s regressing memory before he could safely bring the other man out of his induced sleep. If the missing memories were still accessible, it should be possible to convince Potter to manifest a physical representation of them inside the dream. The symbolism of dreams was often meaningless nonsense, but at the same time the mind was also quite adept at finding meaning in noise. Draco just had to get Potter to interact with the representation of his memories to stimulate the recovery of them, then wake him up as soon as possible to prevent any further damage.
As they drew near the makeshift pitch, Harry saw the rest of the regular Christmas crowd. They were evenly split: some were flitting about in the air, trading playful insults and passing the quaffle lackadaisically, while the rest were standing around chatting and occasionally calling out suggestions to the players. He spotted Andromeda standing with Hermione, both of them ignoring the game completely as they talked, while Teddy stood next to them with a huge smile on his face as he tracked the players that flew overhead.
Hermione picked at her drink mat before she tried again. “I just meant that you’ve got this time to just… try other things. Obviously, you can’t
“Then we’ll have learned something else,” Harry replies, and he leans back against the workbench to watch what he expects will be a long and boring process.
“Potter,” Draco warned. “I swear, if we end up trapped here because you’re fucking embarrassed about a dream you once had…”
“Why can’t I watch?” Malfoy asks, sounding slightly annoyed. Maybe he’s still bristling about the hair thing.
“How about an alternative one: five years blissfully free of your interference in my life, and now you barge back in all of a sudden?" Malfoy breathed in; the end of the cigarette flared. He turned away from Harry, pressing his back against the wall once more. “No, I don’t trust it for a moment. You can tell your superiors that Draco Malfoy is a law-abiding citizen and that sending the Chosen One in a hamfisted attempt to intimidate me out of my chosen profession simply makes them look like fools.”
The hairs on the back of Draco’s neck stood up. “Every professor gets an office,” he said slowly. “And you’re the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.”
“Something like this pottery class could be helpful,” she said. “I think you could benefit from an outlet, because it doesn’t sound like you have anything besides your work right now."
Harry snorts. “No, you’re right,” he says. “Look at us. So responsible.” He lays back on his pillow as well, and they’re both quiet for a moment. Then Harry shifts a few times, as if something about the position is bothering him. “What did you do to my pillow?” he finally asks suspiciously.
we looking for, anyway?” Potter asked as Draco marched them towards the far corner of the room. “You’re being awfully secretive about this whole assignment.”
A woman in a priest’s robes, who looked to be somewhere in her forties, read the scripture aloud.. She stood behind a pulpit that was draped in a festive covering that read “Unto us a child is born”, and she had a soothing reading voice. Harry gazed around the rest of the sanctuary, not focusing too long on any one thing; he was no longer in a position to cast his locator spell unobserved, but he was dying to know if Malfoy was actually here, sitting in the congregation in a church service. It’s not that there was anything wrong with that, it’s just not a possibility that would ever have occurred to Harry. It wasn’t like he had any experience with churches, himself; the Dursleys were never into that sort of thing when he was younger, and he’d never understood why someone would choose to leave the house on a Sunday morning rather than have a lie-in.
“The root problem was as I predicted,” Draco said, turning away from Potter to face the others. “Mr. Potter was trapped inside a dreaming state, and I was able to assist him in exiting it by creating a sufficient shock from inside the dream.” He resolutely didn’t look back at Potter’s face, nor elaborate about the nature of that shock. Some things were best never discussed again. “However, there was a foreign element present that I haven’t encountered before, which appeared to be seeking out Potter’s memories and… hiding them, somehow. My theory is that Potter was deliberately placed in an enchanted sleep to reduce his mind’s natural defences against this assault on his memories. Perhaps if we knew what had triggered his involuntary nap, we may better understand how these pieces fit together?”
Harry wasn’t sure why it galled him so much. He carried his wheel across the studio space and placed it so it was directly opposite Malfoy’s with only a few feet separating their two desks. Malfoy actually looked up at this and rolled his eyes, which Harry found remarkably satisfying.
Melanie proceeded to explain a surprising number of steps that were involved in making their first piece. First, they were supposed to form a slight cone by applying pressure with their hands just so; this would help seal the base to the wheel. Then they were to practice “coning up” and “coning down”, which seemed to involve forcing the clay to through holes between their fingers in both directions and would help shape and position the clay as needed. After that came “opening up”, where Melanie pressed three of her fingers to the top of the mound of clay, and all the students oohed as a bowl shape gradually appeared in the mound of clay, as if by magic. Finally, she showed them how to “pull a wall”, where she took that bowl shape and squeezed the wide sides to make them narrower, forcing the extra clay to move higher as a result.
Potter’s breathing sped up, and his hips began to move without any assistance from Draco, pistoning his cock in and out of Draco’s mouth. Draco just relaxed his throat and took it; he’d always found it an incredible turn on when a partner let loose on him like this. He tried to assist by swiping his tongue along Potter’s cock as it retreated after each thrust—every time he did so, Potter gave this little grunt that steadily increased Draco’s desire to flip him over and just have his way with him, damn the consequences. Surely there were worse ways to go.
Draco pushed against Potter’s hips, moving them backwards so the man’s cock was no longer interfering with his speech. The suction in his mouth caused a popping sound as the head emerged once more. It bobbed appealingly in front of Draco’s lips as he made direct eye contact with Potter. “I said you should fuck my mouth.”
Malfoy’s cheeks flared inwards as he took a final drag on the stub of his cigarette, highlighting the sharp ridges of his cheekbones for a moment. “Look, it doesn’t matter to me either way,” Malfoy said. He tossed the stub on the sidewalk and ground it under his shoe. “I’ll be in the studio tomorrow morning. You can show up, or you can fuck off. Makes no difference to me.” He glanced at Harry once again, as if checking for some kind of reaction.
Watching Harry from the corner of his eye and trying not to be obtrusive about it, Draco is relieved to see Harry going through the motions of toweling himself dry. He appears less overwhelmed now, but he’s still being quieter than usual. After a shift Harry likes to vent, or at least relate the details of particularly complex cases that he dealt with. He says that it helps him decompress, even if Draco doesn’t actually understand half of what Harry tells him. Draco worries his lip a bit as he refastens his towel and decides not to ask about the shift again; if Harry’s ready to talk about it, he’ll usually bring it up on his own.
“Hello?” Potter called, which was odd. Draco craned his neck to see what the other man was doing, but the doorway just appeared to lead to a deep darkness, as if Potter hadn’t bothered to dream up an actual corridor outside his office.
“Harry?” Draco asks uncertainly. Harry notices Draco’s eyes drop to his mouth, just for a moment, and feels elated. “It felt different this time. It felt like I could actually control it with the new wand.”
“Happy Christmas Teddy!” Harry called, and when the young boy turned around and spotted him, he ran towards them, abandoning his study of the game.
“Thirty two year old male, found asleep and unresponsive to external stimuli.” Jenkins unconsciously wrung his hands as he spoke; it was a habit that made Draco want to grind his teeth. The Healer trainee tended to look even more worried when Draco did that, however, so he refrained. Barely. “Arrived via Floo, it’s unknown how long the patient has been in this state.”
Potter flipped two fingers at him. “So… I guess I should read the rest of this book?” he asked. “And you’ll think of some way to get us out of here?”
Harry snorted. “Funny you should mention that. She wants me to go to a pottery class tomorrow evening.”
Draco interrupted his pacing to wheel around and check on Potter; he couldn’t help himself. “Have you—” He caught himself before he asked anything too leading. “Do you have any questions?”
Draco murmured something that sounded like assent, so Harry began the laborious process of isolating memory fragments that might be important to the trial. He wrote a request to the archives for all memories associated with the case file, charmed the parchment into a bird-like shape and sent it fluttering off down the hallway. He watched it go, his spirits lifted by the way it traversed the air currents, flitting from doorway to doorway until he couldn’t see it any longer. Perhaps the day wouldn’t be so bad, he thought as he reached for the first file.
He pauses, closing his eyes. Draco hums encouragingly, not sure exactly if he’s supposed to be reacting right now or not. Harry takes a breath again, seeming to steel himself for something yet to come. Draco realizes that Harry’s starting to slip into what he thinks of as his debriefing voice - it's a little bit like lecturing, as Harry tries to relate the facts of the case dispassionately, like he says they’re taught in their Healer training.
to help out with the backlog.” He pauses for a moment, and it feels like he’s steeling himself again. “I would do it again. Everything. Everything I did tonight… it's really important to me. That’s not ever going to change.”
“Good morning,” Malfoy says formally. “As agreed, I have returned three days from our original appointment.”
Draco scoffed; what a reassuring vote of confidence that was. “Yes, I have successfully woken up other patients with this method. It’s often quite straightforward.” He took his wand in hand and pointed it at Potter’s head. “At the very least, I should be back soon with more information,” he said. He gave Weasley a professional nod, then turned his attention back to Potter. “
“Maybe you can help with that,” Draco said. “Can you recall any particular dreams you’ve had that were interrupted? Maybe they can inspire us. Anything would help, really.”
“Mmm, bed sounds good,” Harry murmurs. Draco thinks the late night might be catching up with him by this point, the tiredness overwhelming whatever was going on earlier. Wrapping his towel around him like a protective cloak, Harry is about to leave the bathroom when he pauses in the doorway and looks back at Draco for a moment. “Sorry about the anniversary,” he says quietly.
It wasn’t that Draco couldn’t, or even wouldn’t, apologize. Early on in training, he had come to Harry and issued an uncomfortably thorough and blunt apology for his many transgressions during their time at school and the war. Draco had been weirdly formal about the whole thing, and he’d almost seemed annoyed when Harry had accepted the apology at face value rather than hashing out each time he’d hurt Harry.
“Well, Potter,” Malfoy said gravely, interrupting his reverie. “Congratulations. I think we can definitely say that you have made.. something. Well done.”
Harry considered the dilemma for a moment and was suddenly struck by another option. All Aurors were taught a locator spell that keyed to their partners. It couldn’t be used to track anybody else; it was something about attuning magical cores that Harry forgot as soon as it was explained to him. Draco would probably remember the details because he was a swot like that. Of course, Harry
“I split the wand down the middle,” Harry says, extracting the wand from the lathe and setting it on the platform attached to his small jigsaw. “Then I rejoin the two halves afterward.”
“Let’s toast,” Harry announced, several hours later. He had lost the ability to concentrate a good half hour earlier, and in a rash attempt to regain it, he had decided to organise his desk drawer. He had actually uncovered a book on the history of magical creature relations that Hermione had loaned him, and he’d forgotten about entirely, a golden snitch that occasionally made half-hearted attempts to fly away, and a bottle of Ogden’s Finest ‘51 which he’d received for Christmas the previous year.
“More reading, less chit-chat,” Malfoy said. It may have come out a bit gleefully. Tormenting Potter turned out to be
Draco shrugs. “I try not to get my hopes up,” he says. The way Harry’s face closes off, he thinks it might have been too honest. Harry abruptly turns and walks down the hallway before Draco can say anything to soften it, and he sighs and picks Harry’s robes off the floor. He can explain what he meant in the morning, when they’re both better rested.
as much as he did. It showed in his results. No other Auror had reached his rate of closed cases, let alone sustained it like he had. And yes, these days he worked alone, often as not, because whoever they assigned him as a partner could never keep up, and could Harry really be expected to babysit someone in the field? He didn’t dare split his attention to keep somebody else alive. He put himself in danger all the time; that was an acceptable risk—it came with the job. The latest partner they’d tried to saddle him with hadn’t even lasted a month before she demanded to be reassigned; he’d heard she’d threatened to quit.
Therapy wasn’t Harry’s idea. Robards' meddling, priggish administrative assistant had swept into Harry’s office and informed him in no uncertain terms that he was on administrative leave until he could get his shit together. He’d handed Harry the contact information for Healer Tran and told him she would have to sign off on him returning to active duty. Harry had acknowledged the news calmly, unwilling to show any weakness, but later that afternoon, he laid on the floor in Grimmauld Place and stared at the ceiling in silence until Kreacher came and snidely asked if “Master would like to be watered and turned towards the sun.”
somewhere different because you have these sessions with your healer, but you could still visit a museum or take a class or something. Just as a change, you know? You could treat this as an opportunity!”
Draco rolled his eyes and performed a cleaning spell on his mug before he handed it over. “The ways I debase myself around you simply boggle the mind,” he said.
