"Now, now Potter don't be greedy. You can have a turn after I'm done playing," and his back was fully turned away now, and Harry smirked. It was exactly as he wanted.
"What, what?"
"Relax Draco," she hissed quietly.
If the blonde was being 100% honest with himself, he was having a hard time keeping up with the constant shift in Potters demeanor. The way the other man seemed to go from guarded and annoyed to something

Harry was sure the git was up to something no good, and now, Harry couldn't image the blonde doing anything bad especially seeing how...vulnerable the blonde looked and suddenly every regret Harry had been feeling vanished, thankful he had stopped things before they had gotten out of hand.

Pansy shields back into the couch, looking positively miserable while even the ginger Gryffindor seems unsure what to say, deciding to remain quiet instead.
"What's the matter Ron, would you rather Draco dominate me instead?" Pansy calls sickly sweet, sending a knowing wink in the ginger's general direction.
Harry had grown a considerable amount in the years following.
The Gryffindor was holding on so tight that Malfoy wondered if he would have bruises as proof of how strong Harry truly was.
He's about to tell Potter where he can

refused to show such vulnerability as he reacted by lashing out instead.
It had started off as a comment, and a simple one at that.
"Y-Yes a-a- all the time..." a quiet whimper of want escapes as he lets himself breathe in the Gryffindor's scent; his inhibition for subtle going right out the window.
Harry couldn't help but mull as he realized just how truly gorgeous the Slytherin was especially with the light from the ceiling filtering in  making his blonde hair and creamy texture just that more breath taking.
"Really? You can brush your teeth all on your own like a big boy?" Potters quick, voice cutting sardonically.
"What do you mean by that?"
But someone does.

Though he denies acknowledging the truth behind the spell.
During the brief time him and his friend Blaise had relations, Draco never had the courage to voice his thoughts or ask for any of his 'sick' fantasies; the constant scare of the Slytherin running away or worse... telling someone.
Ron snorts at this, shaking his own messy hair as Harry leans back, smiling with interest.
"I just...I.." he was trying his best not to shake, refusing to be seen as weak; pathetic, but failing miserably the more his 'friend' pressed; closing the gap between the two of them.
But now he was apparently about to tell his nemesis; something he loathed with embarrassment.
Blaise simply chuckled, satisfied with his results as he seemed to just be beginning.

The need to taste Potter is heavy on Draco's mind, and he's desperate to escape; body clumsily pushing at the other boy to get him out of his way so he can rush to the nearest exit.
"Seems like the potion works," Pansy suddenly called with a snicker, glancing at her best friend beside her.
Ron seemed to have the opposite reaction, going almost as pale as Malfoy. "Bloody hell Harry, like I'd want that image in my head."
Peering through slit eyes, Draco begrudgingly cooperates.

"What's the matter Malfoy, thinking about Blaise?" and Draco must
"You're already so excited for me, aren't you?"
The blonde in question groans in annoyance.
It's an automatic reaction, moving before Draco can fully register what he's doing, but slim hands move awkwardly to cover his lap in embarrassment.
Draco doesn't dare dwell on why.
Blaise on the other hand, simply laughed, uncurling the blonde from his arms and throwing him back against the hard oak in their first position; eliciting a pained yelp from the blonde as Zabini called casually over his shoulder.
"Yes," and there's no mistaking the quiet, defeated demeanor in his voice.
"Potter did always have a way of making you do
"O-oh..." is all the blonde can manage, startled by the gentle compassion from his nemesis as he lightly touches the spot again.

if the Gryffindor was anything to go by.
The sensation was- too much- and not enough, hands desperately clinging to the Gryffindor for support.
"I'd reckon so, considering how much of a massive git you are Malfoy," Ron growled, stepping forward as if allowed to finally speak upon his acknowledgement. His hand twitched readily at his side and the Slytherin notices the ginger was half cocked and reaching for his wand half tucked beneath his robe.
A breathy pant leaves the thin lips of the Slytherin as he tries to hide the groan of arousal at being kissed so well, at lips moving so expertly against his pale throat. He shivers at the way his nemesis bites his neck,  quick to leave little marks and bruises that send a dark pool of ecstasy hot in Draco's body.
Malfoy doesn't find annoying- but
Later the blonde would blame it on the possible concussion he was suffering from, knowing it was a good enough excuse as any as to why he would agree to such an idiotic idea.
"I was right. Potter
"Nah that's where you're wrong Malfoy," Harry hisses darkly.
"Yes,

"Malfoy's such a bloody git isn't he? Such an annoying little prat, don'tcha say?"
His friends looked between each other, a sly smile spreading on their face as if they knew something Harry didn't, and went back to conversing and eating; greeting Harry with a curt nod. They said nothing to Malfoy, but Harry wasn't surprised. The pure-blood was still Malfoy, the annoying prat that teased him and his friends relentlessly, but now the blonde...seemed different.
Draco's eyes are wild and unsure, though he bites the inside of his cheek to hide the tremble of his body.
"Yes, well, must be nice having the Chosen One always around to fight your battles for you, isn't  it? How very convenient for you, Weasley," Malfoy turns without taking a breath; eyes locked on the brunette whose attention he FINALLY has again.
The reserve Draco had been holding back finally broke at that, a choked sob escaping his throat as fear blanked his eyes for the first time since the exchange.
"You're the one that agreed to go along with Potters asinine plans, I for one thought you were bloody mental for agreeing to such a thing, hell I still think you are."
Harry knew all too well how it was easy to hide feelings and truths when too busy arguing and driving a wedge as nemesis. But after today, Harry knew Draco was no longer his enemy, knowing there was no going back to the way they where before. He had seen such a vulnerable side of Draco that he never even fathomed the boy had, and it was just a shame that he had come across it with such dire circumstances.
The bottle tips and Malfoy closes his eyes as his head snaps back; smooth neck exposed.
"This does not concern you, Potter." Blaise hissed, eyes narrowing into slits.

The blonde isn't entirely sure of the answer
A short unamused noise calls out, startling both boys, as Harry turns slightly, with Malfoy in his arms, to the source of the sound.
He has the strange urge to hold Draco close and hug him tight while apologizing profusely. To let him feel the warmth of his body and know that he was going to be alright and to tell him that it wasn't his fault his friend was fucked up. That it was on Blaise not him.
But fuck, risk or not, it was tempting, Draco would admit to that. Being able to ask the Boy Who Lived ANYTHING without the Gryffindor being able to lie in return was something that seemed almost impossible to pass up. But with the perks and stakes so high, so to could the Gryffindor do the same as well.
"Awe what's the matter, you two
"Okay, that's IT," Ron hissed, and his wand is fully out and pointed at the blonde.
"Maybe you can just pretend to drink it?" she whispers quietly, voice barely fitting to the blonde's ear.
, Draco hates himself a little more inside. He's all too aware of the distant sound of sobbing, the noise to his shock, was coming from his own throat.
The tone cuts sharp and serious, voice curling a new wave of nausea and terror in the blonde's throat.

He can feel Potter's tongue pressing  against his lips, demanding entrance.

know.”
"I just don't
Sometimes, in the middle of class, Draco would find his eyes drawn to Potter’s unruly head of hair, and if he was especially bored, sometimes he would simply stare for awhile. He would trace the hard line of Potter’s jaw — usually just this side of stubbly, no doubt because Potter felt he couldn’t be arsed, the same way he apparently felt about his clothing if those ripped denims and washed-out tees were anything to go by — and then linger briefly on his throat, the way his Adam’s apple moved when he swallowed. Often Draco became completely captivated watching Potter’s hands, too. He remembered the way they felt on his cheek, and not for the first time he marveled over what those hands had done.
He’d only smoked marijuana three or four times since the incident six months ago when that incriminating photograph had appeared in the paper, and before having had his row with Malfoy he’d had no intention at all of lighting up between now and the Cup.
Most scars, like the ones on Draco’s chest, fade eventually to white. Harry’s is different, though — its lines are thin and imprecise and faintly pink against his dark skin, starting at his hairline and branching out into hectic patterns that take up half his forehead like a bolt of lightning.
"You could at least
“All I said was good morning, heathen,” he says. Harry’s smile grows. “Isn’t it early for the asserting-your-dominance routine? I’ve only just woken up.”
“Stop moving,” Harry said, mild yet brooking no argument. Malfoy let his head fall against the back of the sofa, chest heaving, eyes shut, golden lashes brushing his effeminately high cheekbones. He looked like he was praying for patience. Watching him closely, Harry pulled his thumb out and replaced it with his middle finger, gliding it in easily through the wetness he’d put there. Malfoy keened but stayed still. “You’re doing so good,” Harry breathed, stuffing a second finger in beside the first and placing a wet kiss to the inside of Malfoy’s thigh.
to hear something that would make this okay. “He would have done the same thing if they’d let him go back to the manor. It’s not your fault or your mum’s or Potter’s.”
“So it’s legal, then?” Malfoy asked sceptically.
Harry hardly slept that night, and the next morning Malfoy didn't come down for breakfast. He said nothing to either Ron or Hermione, and that afternoon he and Ron went out to the pitch for a few hours where Harry spent most of the time trying not to think of the night before and failing completely. Hermione told them when they came back that Malfoy had seemed weird and jittery when he came down and that he'd gone right back up to his room after a quick lunch.

“No, you haven’t been having fun?”
“Of course not!” she defended fiercely, but when she saw the grin on Harry’s face he saw her relax a little bit. “I just meant —”
"Right," Harry said. His voice was deep and scratchy, the hand that had fallen to Draco's hip squeezing with a possessive force. He pecked Draco on the lips again before moving back. "How are ... how are you feeling?"
“I’m okay,” says Harry. “Don’t be long.”

Draco purses his lips and looks into the small shop again. He smiles to himself.
"You okay?" Harry asked, moving a sweaty clump of blond hair out of his face. Draco only nodded. It was then that Harry realised Draco was shivering again, though not from an orgasm this time. He pulled out — eliciting a soft sound from Draco — and grabbed his jumper. "Here," he said, handing it to him, "put this back on."

the blonde boy drawls in his usual demeanor; though Ron is all too aware of the disturbing sight of the Slytherin wrapped up in Harry.
"So..." the redhead coughs nervously, "Are you two going to ask each other something or are we just going to sit around here all night?"
He knows the ginger is trying to bait him, but he won't play into his games.
He would do anything for this boy, and Draco was going to let him.
filthy.
For some reason, Blaise's grin widened even more; as he took the action to mean something else.
"Yes you did," Draco shoots pointedly back at her. "When we had to hide from Finch, you pulled me into the corner and my head got smashed against the wall."
"Ello everyone, what are we talking about?" Ron interrupted, the sweep of his robes drifting ever so slightly as he plopped down beside the curly haired girl, kissing her brightly on the cheek as he reached around with his other hand and plucked some food from her plate she had left to the side of her work.
"Because I'm not a self-righteous git," he hissed, "And we're not fucking," he added with a pierced wince as the brunette quickly looked away.

"Considering you fooled around with Blaise, it's obvious you
Blaise refused to look away and it only fueled the Gryffindor even more as he cocked his eyebrow in a challenging stance.
"Y..Yes..." he whispered back breathless, and that's when Harry realized without a doubt.
And the brunette swears his best mate has physically turned a greener shade.
"Y-" he stops himself, the familiar taste of copper filling his mouth with fresh blood as he tries to hold back through the broken flesh; biting hard.
bloody well mention about that stupid fucking…" the Slytherin boy pauses, as if the very word would make his predicament further exceedingly worse; and perhaps even more real.
Potter had done something nice for him and the blonde
"Well as a matter of fact I was, but you were too busy. "
He doesn't miss the way the Gryffindor boy's hatred

A whine of distress escapes past desperate lips before he realizes it’s too late.
Blaise chuckled darkly, fingers moving up to stroke longingly against the smooth side of Draco's pale cheek.
“I… wow. I was not expecting that.
The thought was gone in an instant, hating himself for comparing Blaise to himself as if his actions were normal.
He wasn't quite sure what he was doing exactly, and neither it seemed did Malfoy. But as timid fingers curled and wrapped around the Gryffindor, Harry swore he would do everything in his power to protect the boy.
"Don't tell me your scared,Malfoy." The brunette taunts, using famous words that he knows the Slytherin will no doubt pick up on as he quirks a small unseen smile as Draco scowls angrily.
A light tap against the skin has Draco struggling to
Draco was shaking again, terrified as he clutched the Gryffindor, nuzzling his head into the crook of Harry's neck and seemingly uncaring of anyone who might see the bizarre scene.
"Always so fucking full of himself, isn't he?" At this he grabs the blonde, turning him around so Draco's back was pressed into Blaise's chest.
Harry's arms still remain curled along Draco's body, though the Slytherin knows there's really just no other place for them to go, his own hands firmly against the Gryffindor's chest.
"Close is an understatement. I'd rather not be stuck with the choice of being caught and having points taken from Slytherin or being stuck next to two..." He slicks his platinum hair back, fingers running through his hair as he glares darkly at the brunette. " Sweaty Gryffindor's. A hard choice indeed."
"Yes, I can tell, the girls must be ever so thankful." Malfoy drawled, half amused as the ginger's ears turned pink at the insult.
Before Harry could sputter a response, someone beat him to it.
His head is spinning, feeling dizzy as uncertainty whether from the bump on his head from earlier or because of the compromising position the two boys seemed faced in, wondering if Harry noticed as much as he did.
Suddenly Malfoy wasn't looking his usual cocky arrogant self anymore, in fact Harry could practically hear the worry radiating off the blonde's body as Draco tried to take another step back and put some distance between himself and the other Slytherin, getting trapped instead.
The Slytherin shoots for casual, though there's no mistaking the thinly veiled threat behind his austerity.
"Yeah..." Harry answered suspiciously, but honestly. There was no question about that.
Draco's not paying attention, body still in fight mode, unaware, and doesn't notice the taunt feeling of his robe being pulled before he's already moving, letting out a startled yelp as his head collides with the castles brick wall before he's being stuffed in a corner nook with too many bodies pressed close together.

Draco yelped in surprise, fork clanging embarrassingly loud on the table as he relaxed just as easily when he realized who was holding him.
"Well Malfoy? I asked you a question." the condescending words barely register, the blonde fighting a losing battle for control.
"Well don't you think Malfoy should get a little taste of his own medicine? Bout time he learned a thing or two... if you know what I mean."
Draco growled angrily, shooting a pointed look before he sniffed, turning and walking in as Harry waited for the blonde to pass, a coy smile etched across his Gryffindor strong features as he followed closely behind.

"I...I.. I w-was thinking about you tying m-me up and p-punishing me," he answers with a flushed voice as Malfoy refuses to meet Potter's gaze, eyes transfixed to the floor.  It's not until the brunette tilts his head up does he gaze into bright emerald eyes that spit fire.
The inquiry blind sides the Slytherin, having

Despite his protest, he couldn't stop his betraying mind from conjuring up images of eager hands moving, constricting and tying him to the bed without the luxury of being asked; instead being taken.
Lips brush firmly, a small tongue protruding to lick at exposed flesh as the blonde shudders under the cool but salacious touch.
"Y...Your right Potter.." the words whispered as if air escaping, as he bowed his head in defeat.
The Slytherin can hear his heart racing in his chest, but he pretends he's fine as he squeezes his eyes shut and does the only thing he can do, he waits.
"And what, two Gryffindors being out is completely fine?" The platinum blonde arrogantly calls with raised eyebrow.
"Drink." Voice gruff and for a moment Draco almost thinks of refusing out of spite as the flask waves heavily between them both.

"Let's just get this over with," Ron growled, coming to stand beside Draco as he eyed the room cautiously before pushing past Draco aggressively as he opened the door and headed in with shoulders back. The lithe platinum blonde scoffed, shifting his robes so as to have them sit better on rested shoulders as Pansy quickly followed suit behind the ginger.
"Is that what you want me to do to you..

between tightly clenched teeth.
It shouldn't of been a surprise when Blaise ducked his head low a mere 30 minutes later, slithering towards the Slytherin table as he sat between Pansy and Theodore Nott.
"What I mean is…" she trails off as eyes widen in recognition as the Gryffindor girl turns a pinker shade of skin.
"Beg like the submissive little whore that I
Something that would not end well for the Slytherin, he was damn sure of it.

Everyone's nervous, anxiously holding their breath as Draco tries to squirm and get some personal space but finds the action futile and pointless. There's nowhere to go in the small confined area they find themselves enclosed in and as he turns his head to hopefully get into a better position he finds himself fastened to bright green eyes that stare into his own cloudy pupils.
Draco is all too aware of what the next question

The word curls instantly, a dark thought surfacing to the brink of the blonde's mind. It was a well-known
When neither happens, the Slytherin's not sure what to think as an almost animalistic growl escapes past the Gryffindor's lips before the brunette is pushing hard; trapping the lithe blonde against the wall.
"I was just telling Harry here that he really should stop eyeing Malfoy all the time. It's only going to cause more problems."
"I wouldn't say that. In fact, I wouldn't say it's paradise at all..." and  it's obvious that Harry had planned to say more but thankfully

Filch is getting closer, lamp swinging back and forth as an eerie light bounces up and down with each step.
"Oh, Chosen One, why don't you ask Malfoy something first?"
"Oops, sorry Malfoy," Harry called with an innocent shrug of his shoulders.
A sharp stab of pain reminds Draco of his head colliding with the wall only moments ago and the blonde winches, desperately wishing he can clutch at his head; feel for the bruise that will surely make itself known on unblemished white skin.
"What?" Draco hissed when Harry said nothing, nor moving one way or another.
"Oh oh, trouble in paradise Harry dear?" a mock tone that expressed  Malfoy's ridicule leered out with a wolfish grin.
"Yes, well suppose you don't Draco," she eyes her friend with an exasperated glare, before she nudges past him and leads the way to a darker section in the castle.
"I'm just asking you to walk away Harry, that's it."
"H-How DARE you talk to me like that Potter!"

There was alot of things the Gryffindor wanted to say in that moment, but he chose to remain silent. Waiting and playing out the scenario to see where Blaise was going with his comments.

It was as if the Gryffindor had uttered a

"I did no such thing!" she pipes up with a scoff, airing fake offense.
The boy got lost in thoughts, head still reeling over everything that happened in the course of two hours. He still couldn't believe one of Draco's supposedly friends had tried to rape him, and was stunned when the blonde had actually agreed to letting Harry help him.
It's a notion that disturbs the Slytherin to his very core, but he can't bring himself to correct himself, nor will he flee like a common coward as he straightens up with a clearly practiced poise.

And Harry watched wide eyed and jaw slack as the taller Slytherin pressed against the pure-blood, pushing him against the tall oak tree and trapping their bodies against one another. Long arms reached, grabbing the thin wrists of Draco as he pulled them up and above Malfoy's head, sealing his head in as Blaise smiled slowly, a wicked grin gracing his face.
Draco doesn't have to see to know that all eyes in the room are on him as Malfoy pretends not to feel the way Harry's eyes are burning into him.
"You two just shut your filthy mouths up about my sister! Not one more god damn word you hear?" Ron puffs up his chest with each breath, ready to defend his baby sister if need be. Not that she needed it, but he would always play the protective big brother role.

It had been a mistake, as soon as he stepped through the Room of Requirements, hell, even before when he had let Potter bait him into such an obvious and idiotic trap for information.
Harry's blood began to boil at the implication of the words, shaking his head hotly as he could feel heat rise up on his cheeks.

The man in questions sighs, carding his hand through his unruly red hair. He loved his girlfriend to death, but sometimes he wished she would just get to the bloody point.
It did surprise Harry however, that he had come back so soon after just licking his fresh wounds.
"For Merlin's sake, Harry! See, Ron, this is precisely what I was talking about."
He kissed him then, fingers move and force the pale skin of Draco's jaw to snap up as the other Slytherin boy takes his lips hungrily.
"Harry?"
"I don't want you anywhere near him, do you understand me?" The voice is low and steady in his ear and the blonde is all too aware that his nemesis isn’t asking.
He's surprised at the level of strength the brunette had displayed, wondering with morbid fascination if he were to gently run slender fingers against the top frame of Harry, how much muscle he would feel if he just stroked...
It takes a moment before
“W-what?” Draco asked, confused at the unexpected question.

Draco's stomach flips as he remembers wondering the same thing about the other boy.
"Shove off Blaise,I'm nothing of the sort." And there was no mistaken the painstakingly arrogant voice of Draco Malfoy though as Harry got closer to the scene outside the court yard he couldn't help but notice that there was something...different sounding about it. What that was, the Gyffindor was unsure of until he crept closer, remaining hidden to both Slytherin boys as the three of them remained undisturbed and alone.
"H-How fucking DARE you Potter!"
And deep down, Draco knew he always did,
"Well, obviously, I could have told you that," the blonde says with a mock pout before his eyes startle wide. "Though- wait, not even our own kind? What do you-"

"You sure about that one, Malfoy?" the retort is quick, smooth, as  the Gryffindor boy folds his arms into a defensive stance.

would.
He could feel his eyes grow heavy, eyelashes fluttering ever so slowly as he fought to keep awake. Thankfully and unfortunately, he didn't have to fight long.
“You can play Devil’s Advocate if you want,” Harry said calmly, making Draco arch a brow. The truth was, he wasn’t an Auror for nothing — he was an extremely perceptive person. And after years on the job, he was now able to read body language so well Draco often felt like he couldn’t have lied about anything even if he’d wanted to, because Harry would see right through it in a second. “You know he does.”
Potter had barely finished the sentence before Draco was shoving at his chest. But Potter was laughing, and he grabbed Draco’s hips only to pull him close again and catch his mouth in another devastatingly slow kiss.
“I’m hardly halfway,” said Pansy. Yet she rolled her parchment up as well, and Draco couldn’t be arsed to try and stop her. It seemed Blaise cared about as much as he did. “I’m going to go have lunch, are you coming, Draco, darling?”
"Well I'm in love with him too," said Harry. "And incidentally I'm in love with
Harry opens his mouth to make another sarcastic remark (because he can’t fucking help it, even with his libido screaming out in agony for him to fucking leave it, just let Draco have this power trip) but before he can say anything Draco’s lining up and bares down until the head pushes through the ring of muscle — and he stops there. And Harry’s always been good at biting back vocalisations, an ability to stay quiet no matter what is a highly useful skill for an Auror, but when Draco stops and merely squeezes around the head of his cock he lets out an utterly tormented groan, bucking his hips only for Draco to lift up and away.
“Right hand to god, Malfoy, the Hat tried to put me in Slytherin until I begged it not to,” he said, impossibly satisfied by the look on Malfoy’s face. “Said something about — I dunno — a thirst to prove myself.”
It was a weak excuse, but it would have to do. Theo seemed uncertain whether or not to believe it, but nodded slowly all the same.
But Malfoy was apparently already finished with the conversation, because he gave Harry another horribly stony stare. “Just don’t, Potter.” The tears were there again, still being held back but shimmering noticeably in his eyes, and Harry felt a very familiar sense of helplessness that always plagued him in situations he couldn’t control. “For once in your life, keep your enormous head
me see you that way, there's nothing like it. You think I want someone with no surprises? Someone who likes exactly the same things as me, can't introduce to me new stuff? Someone who doesn't challenge me?" He shakes his head. "I can't think of anything more boring. And all that messy shit from our pasts ... I know we've avoided it. But, Draco, if you're ready to start trying to talk about all of that then so am I. You can talk to me about
Now he did pull away. He didn’t know whether Potter was asking a rhetorical question, and anyway, he was hardly focused on the second part of that impromptu speech Potter had given. The first part was still ringing in his head and making him feel nauseous. After several long moments where Potter watched him with his eyebrows knitted in the middle of his forehead, arm back at his side, Draco forced out the words he desperately wished weren’t true.
care about these days, is there, Potter?” Malfoy said faintly, voice breaking as he was stuffed full once again. His back arched up off the sofa, hands coming around to Harry’s back where his nails dug in sharply. Harry hissed at the pain.
For one dizzying moment, Draco thought Potter was going to kiss him. His lips tingled with the anticipation of it, his stomach clenched, his cock twitched, and his traitorous eyes even dipped to glance at Potter’s mouth. But in the very next second, with his lips slightly parted, he saw Potter starting to grin, and an embarrassed flush spread over his whole body.
"Hey," he said, stepping inside and shutting it behind him. "Are you ... how are you?"
“Will you come with me?”
“You’re a fucking twat!” Draco hissed; he dug a knee into Harry’s side, satisfied when it wiped the grin off his face and made him grab at his ribs.

He waited to see if Harry would say anything else but he didn’t. He only stared at Draco expectantly, arms folded, in all ways closed off.

“Hello, Harry,” said Parvati when he pulled up a third chair. “Brilliant playing today. I was just asking Hermione if it was true, what they were saying about you and Puddlemere in the paper, but she won’t say a thing.”
Harry reached over the edge of the bed and retrieved it from the floor, handing it over and watching as Malfoy covered himself back up. His nipples showed through the shirt, however, and Harry couldn’t help grinning.

Draco grits his teeth and tries to focus.

“This one is deliberately a comedy,” he assures him, as the familiar theme of
At this, most of the class stopped what they were doing to look, including Draco. He blinked owlishly at Harry, whose eyebrows had lifted in surprise at all the sudden attention.
“I say you’re holding out on us, Seamus,” Harry turned to look up at him, grinning wryly. “Why is it you’re the only one here off your trolley?”
“I haven’t even started that,” Harry said morosely.
The result was that there were days when the sex didn't involve Draco going into his headspace at all; in fact (and this had become one of Harry's favourite things in the world) Draco could be quite smiley when he was in a good mood. It wasn't something he liked more or less, necessarily, but rather in a different way. Being able to get Draco to a place where he could find peace for a little while was satisfying in its own very particular way — fucking him while he was wearing a heartbreakingly beautiful grin and breathlessly calling Harry a wanker was satisfying in quite another.

“Are you cold?” He pulled off his jumper and handed it over automatically, and although his cheeks coloured when he realised to whom he’d just offered it, he didn’t retract the offer. Malfoy seemed to contemplate the article of clothing for several moments before taking it and pulling it over his small frame. “Parkinson been lending you clothes?”
“Fuck me,” Draco said against his mouth. His own words made his belly throb with want. He felt it as his cunt started leaking into his knickers — a physical response to the amount of tension accumulated within the last few hours. He needed release, and he needed Harry to give it to him. “Please.” The word sounded weak where he spoke it into the sharp line of Harry’s jaw. His hands were unsteady, his legs even worse, and it wasn’t until Harry backed him up to the same bed where he’d discarded the Cloak, laying Draco down on his back and climbing on top of him, that Draco realised exactly how weak with exhaustion he was.
“No,” Draco said slowly, a pit of fear materialising in his stomach. He’d never heard the word, and yet the sound of it gave him the chills.
“No one could have saved your father, Draco,” said Pansy gravely. His throat was tight, swollen. He hated that he was hanging on her words, looking for truth in them,
"What?"
Only forty-five minutes later, half the bottle was gone and Draco had somehow ended up straddling Potter on his bed, bent forward and kissing those whisky-flavored lips with a breathless, sloppy enthusiasm Potter returned tenfold.
"Soon," he said.
Draco pulled back — reeling from the kiss, though he was disinclined to let this fact show on his face — and gave Potter a searching look.
He didn’t know whether it was supposed to be a rhetorical question, but the answer came readily to his lips: “
“Shut up, you fucking bonehead,” Draco snaps. Potter’s still laughing, eyes crinkled in a sickeningly endearing way, and when he opens them again they’re alarmingly green in the sunlight. “Like you don’t stare at my arse in Potions.”

of it. His overworked mind was playing odd tricks on him. Malfoy was leaning back against the wall, arms crossed, white blond hair in disarray and ashy with smoke from the fire. There was a smudge of it under one eye, as well. He stared at Harry with a single eyebrow lifted, challenging.

“Well?”
begin to forget, however, was the intensity of the hatred he’d once felt, and it was not without a bout of nausea and anxiety that he recognised something unsettling: learning that there was another side to Malfoy he’d never seen before, one that he very much liked, did not negate the side he’d known about for seven years, and very much did
For as vivid as the memories were, Harry had realised when he came out here that he didn’t in fact know exactly where he’d gone in. He couldn’t remember. He’d been so inside himself that the details of his surroundings had become nothing more than a blur.
Draco opens his mouth to argue but is suddenly unseated and rolled onto his back, at which point Potter assumes the position he’d been in previously and Draco’s too stunned by how quickly and effortlessly it had happened to do anything until his wrists are already pinned.
“Something,” he echoed, nodding his head and letting his eyes roam freely across this new Malfoy’s face. “Yeah.
She says, “Tell Kimball to go fuck himself,” in her groggy sleep voice, and Harry laughs as he’s pulling on his shirt.
been talking.” Harry looked across the table at Hermione meaningfully, and yet it was several more long moments before he saw comprehension begin to dawn in her eyes.
Potter, for his part, had been in a strange mood since the Saturday afternoon when Draco had spotted him and Weasley in Hogsmeade. The most Potter would say on the subject was that he and Weasley had apparently worked things out, neglecting to go into detail about whatever conversation they might have had. The oddest part of all was that Potter had stopped trying to get him to open up about anything uncomfortable — still no mention of his wand, not a word about his father, or the war, or the past. No questions about the memory Draco was using for his Patronus. And, blessedly, not even a hint of those dreaded words:
Draco’s jaw fell open, his cheeks instantly filling with blood, and to make it worse, Potter was grinning now.
"Look," Harry said, planting a kiss on his cheek and then pulling away to grab a Butterbeer for himself as well. "If this is a grand gesture in your eyes then fine, I lied. But I only meant for it to be something small for us, without everyone else. Label or no label, whatever the hell you feel like calling this that makes you happy, it's
And not a moment later, this time in Harry's voice: "
He pushed Malfoy gently back onto the bed and crawled half on top of him, connecting their lips at once and dropping a hand to Malfoy’s small waist. Two delicate hands cupped Harry’s face, holding him close as he worked his tongue into Malfoy’s mouth, and it was the shaky desperation he felt in that touch that drove Harry absolutely wild. Nails scratched lightly along his skin, and when he lowered himself further, he felt the evidence of Malfoy’s tits pressing into his chest. Beneath him, Malfoy let out a rasping breath against Harry’s mouth.
Harry laughs. The sound make Draco’s heart swell.
Only three months of official dating had not prepared Draco for the flood of emotions he now felt, yet the most pressing matter had become the semi trapped uncomfortably in his trousers. He wanted those talented fingers in his mouth, to feel the callouses on his tongue and taste Harry on them; he wanted to feel them on the sensitive skin of his inner thighs and hip bones, to have them buried so deeply in his arse that he forgot where he ended and Harry began.

“So, are you staying here for the holidays?”

He saw Draco swallow and then look past Harry at something, which he turned to find was a small group of students watching them. Harry found that he couldn't locate even a small part of himself that cared.

“Of course,” Draco drawled, though there was no hint of real disdain in his voice. “Famous Potter, from the Chosen One to Undesirable Number One, it’s always
“Malfoy?” he said loudly, and to his utter astonishment, the girl in the oversized robes with the short blond hair looked up at him for the space of a second before allowing Pansy to drag her away, but not before Harry had made eye contact. And in that moment — that fleeting
“Is that really all you had to say to me?” Potter said eventually. “Or is this you changing your mind at the last minute again?”
Again, Malfoy nodded. Then, a minute later, said, “What was his name? The moron who attacked me?”
Hermione shrugged. “I think maybe it affected his body's bone-structure and most likely that’s all it did. If Professor McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey saw fit to release him from the Infirmary and rejoin the rest of the school, it can hardly be anything permanent, anyway.

Realising he didn’t have much of an answer, Harry merely shrugged.
the struggle happening inside Harry’s head, he didn’t have an inkling as to what it could be about.
"That child is in love with you," said Draco, something tender in his voice, as Harry — grinning helplessly — lifted the baby onto his lap.
“What do you
feel like fighting right now. Not ever again, maybe.
“I always have been,” Harry said, wrenching one eye open again. Draco thought privately that he had never seen anything so charming in his whole life. “But I got used to sleeping especially light last year when we were on the run hunting Horcruxes. Undesirable Number One and all that, you know.”
“You’re such a pervert, Potter,
Draco complies, lifting himself up so that Harry can undo his flies and pull down his trousers, Draco getting them the rest of the way off himself. They work on Harry next, and only once they're both naked does Draco lower himself again, toes curling at the way it feels when their cocks press together. Licking his hand in a crude gesture that makes Draco feel a little faint, Harry wraps it around both of them and starts wanking them slowly, dropping a kiss on Draco's chin. Draco rocks helplessly into the motion, anchoring himself with hands on Harry's shoulders and his eyes slipping closed, because it's all so

As a present to himself on his birthday, he’d bought a new broom before coming to Hogwarts this year. It was the newest model available, the Moonraker, and it had been expensive indeed. As was usually the case when Harry spent large sums of money he had to fight back a habitual sense of guilt that he supposed had something to do with the time he’d spent living with the Dursleys.
“You can’t produce one,” Potter amended cheekily, and the smirk on his face made Draco scowl.
“Ow!” Harry yells, snatching his arm from around Draco’s back when something scalding hot touches his skin. Dean descends into howls of laughter while Draco takes Harry’s arm and starts apologising profusely. He goes as far as chucking the joint at Dean, whose laughter subsides as it lands in his lap and he jumps out of his chair before it can burn him. Harry can see it beginning to burn a hole in the carpet.

This was not the case now — on this point, at least, he seemed resolutely sure of himself. “Running out on you just now, that was … it was shitty.

Malfoy’s back was to Harry, facing the bloke he’d come in with; he looked positively edible in a tight pair of trousers that clung to his arse
"Malfoy, there you are," comes Weasley's voice, in the actual room now. And on the heels of that, "Hey, whoa, where're you going, you just got here!"
. The tickling charm. It did not escape Harry’s notice that this was the spell he’d used on Malfoy during Duelling Club in their second year, nor did his mind fail to play the word association game and drag up memories of Malfoy lying on a bathroom floor, sliced to ribbons. This was especially bothersome considering they shared the class with the Slytherins, and Malfoy himself was not ten feet away.
to say something, and he told himself
The logic was difficult to disagree with; after holding Granger’s gaze another moment, Draco threw the Cloak over his head and left the room with the other two in tow. The closer he got to the entrance hall, the more rapidly his anxiety seemed to be spilling over into the forefront of his mind, so that by the time they had reached the marble staircase and heard yelling down below, Draco was nearly frantic.
Feeling extremely awkward and trying not to think about the fact that he had been discussing this very child with Theo not so long ago, Draco handed the picture back silently. He’d never seen Potter so emotionally vulnerable, and for the first time in a while he remembered what Potter had once been telling him in the prefects’ bathroom, about not sleeping, about being plagued by the war so often he couldn’t escape it.
“Call Blaise, tell him!” he shouted. “You two can have a good laugh over it —”
when you were twelve years old?” he couldn’t resist asking, astounded against his will by the amount of sheer bravery — or perhaps stupidity — it would have taken to blindly jump into a dark tunnel whose bottom couldn’t be made out.
His words were cut off by a hard shove against his chest, knocking him back several steps before he found his balance.
"I said I'm not going anywhere!"

. Paradoxically, it was the source of his tetchiness that was making it so bad.
"Grab me a cigarette, will you?" Draco requests, pointing to the pack on his wardrobe. Harry hesitates but does it, handing Draco's wand to him along with the cigarette. He sits down on the bed again and Draco can feel him watching as he sparks it to life.

"Why?"
Theo shrugged. “S’pose it shouldn’t,” he said. It seemed a peculiar thing to say, but he didn’t elaborate, nor did Draco enquire further. “Well … here’s hoping for miracles, eh?”
“Sure there is,” he said tightly, bottoming out and rocking his hips, biting his lip to hide a grin when Malfoy gasped, knowing he’d found his prostate again. “They’re just not the things everybody

“That’s why you came out here, isn’t it?” Potter chuckled. Draco saw nothing funny about the situation. “At first I thought you might have gone mad, but then I realized you were probably just setting me up. You’re nearly as clever as Hermione sometimes.”
O.W.L.s, thank you very much, and five of them were O’s.”

“I’m in charge of the investigation,” said Harry, following Draco and sliding his hands onto his hips from behind. “So you’ll find I can do pretty much whatever I want, actually.”

"Potter," said Malfoy, looking up at him again, "we don't have to talk."
would be upset.”
Draco shot Harry a hollow look, and he saw that even Goyle looked suddenly nervous beneath the fury.
And that if someone had asked him why, he wouldn’t have been able to give them a straight answer.
Draco looks down, craving a cigarette suddenly. He lifts his unburned hand and rubs his eyes. He doesn't think he's been this mentally exhausted since he was seventeen.
Harry turned to find Draco Malfoy looking at him from not far away. There was a bruise on his cheek, likely where Ron had punched him earlier. He was strikingly pale and thin: Harry thought that he'd never seen anyone who looked so pathetic. He thought it with no anger or hatred. It was exactly what he would expect Malfoy to look like at this moment in time. He couldn’t decide how he felt about seeing him here now, knowing only that he felt no anger. Some part of him even wondered how Malfoy was feeling.
No, there's no doubt about who James Evans is.
Harry pushes his chair back and rubs at his eyes. He might as well go to bed for all the work he's getting done tonight. But before he does, he pulls out a desk drawer and picks up a sheet of parchment, frowning down at it.
Draco has whipped around to silence Harry with a kiss.
"Right now," said Draco sleepily, sliding a hand down Harry's arm, "life's pretty perfect."
A faint smile is still playing around Harry's lips. "I have an idea. Let's try the wish sensors. The requirement sensors. Let's see what they give us."
"Do you think we should give it another try?"
"And you're someone who likes going to Muggle museums?"
"Dudley Dursley, my Muggle cousin, asked me to make him a clock."
"Easy," Harry says and sits up, turning to look at Draco over his shoulder. "We live happily ever after."
Down to business, then.
All in all, it's not bad being back at Hogwarts.
Apparently he's passed the test, because Hermione looks pleased. "This Friday, then? At six? Have a drink before we eat?"
He has no idea what Harry feels. This might only have been a temporary thing, a nice way of passing the time while they got their work done, and now it's all over.
Harry's breath is hot against Draco's neck, Draco's fingers knotted in Harry's hair, as Harry fumbles the button of Draco's trousers open. "Yes?" he whispers.
Harry removes his glasses, his gaze finding Draco's, serious now. Intense. He catches Draco's wrists, sliding his hands up Draco's arms to his elbows, pushing him gently against the wall. The touch sends sparks up Draco's spine, heat to his groin.

"P-Please…. Oh Merlin PLEASE," his voice is ragged and choked, a wretched and uneven tone ringing in the too quiet room as
"Yes of course... I mean, that is, if you'll let me."
"Hmm let's see, let's see…"  a slender finger taps at his lips as he mockingly takes his time to think.  The Slytherin notices how he's got the Gryffindor's full attention; though completely misses the reason

He waits for the snort of disgust, the cold, cruel laughter
It’s the abruptness of it all that has Slytherin realizing his mistake.

When the brunette still had said nothing, Blaise edged in, almost coaxing,
A horrible thought nagged at the back of his brain, but Draco was a Malfoy, and there was no way in hell he would ever indulge in such...

than that he wanted... more to his life. Someone to hug, to hold close, to trust and accept him…
Somehow things had gone from bad to awkward to absolutely terrible and Harry was starting to wish he had minded his own business after all and stayed out of things that didn't involve himself. It was silly now, looking at Malfoy now as opposed to moments ago in the hall which felt like ages by now.

He wanted to taste Harry fucking Potter.
So no he wasn't gay, especially for Malfoy, he just...noticed these things is all.
"Well, Ron isn't coming back to my room now is he?" and there's a confident grin to Harry's words that
Draco nodded slowly and Harry gently cupped the other man's jaw gently pulling him to look up at him. He didn't want to startle the blonde or seem like he was forcing or pressuring the other man after the events of today. But still he had to ask...
"Oh, there you two are," she calls noticing Harry also present. "I've been looking everywhere for..." she pauses in step, side eyeing the two Slytherin's also in the room.
"Yes, oh god please, yes let's..." as he curls his arms around Harry’s neck tightly, refusing to let go.
"Very well," he sighs in defeat as he gets up suddenly to pace; his robe moving and twisting like the master that wears it.
It seems as if  Harry himself
He was gone.

All those things excited the boy, finding himself desperately withering, aching to
But Malfoy was a Slytherin through and through, and
"Promises promises," the blonde whispers, before remaining silent for the rest of the interaction.
It was disturbing how stern Potter was being, how commanding he truly was.
"I think I will do the same. Too many bloody Gryffindor’s around for my taste," he slides his trademark smirk back on and Harry fights the urge to grab the blonde and wipe the look off his face with a heated kiss as he does his best to not turn and desperately make eyes at the beautiful Slytherin boy.
Pansy is trying hard not to laugh while Ron looks positively shell-shocked, eyes impossibly large.
of you," he glances at Pansy for a second before emerald eyes lock back in place, glaring daggers at the pale blonde boy.
"What are you up to Malfoy," he adds almost as an afterthought to what he should be saying, voice a bare whisper, before he's straightening up, presenting much taller then the platinum blonde.
" and there was no mistaking the dark words etched in Harry's voice as he bore into Malfoys gaze.
He prays nobody noticed, or thinks twice.
boys, as fun as it is staring awkwardly at each other, perhaps someone should do… something."
"Well, that's simple Malfoy.." the brunette runs a finger suggestively along the edge of the lithe blondes throat as the shorter man trembles at the touch; Adam's Apple bobbling nervously.
The room had no house colors, likely for good reason, as the walls were a beautiful turquoise finish.

would find him attractive, Harry had eyes after all. Blonde silky hair slicked back to perfection, the way he carried himself with such poise. The man had also grown alot over the holidays and Harry couldn't help but notice the pure-blood had grown at least 4 inches over his time away and somehow gained muscle while keeping his slim lean figure at the same time. Not to mention the rare time he saw Malfoy actually smile a genuine smile was nothing short but breath taking.
Draco laughed coldly, pointing his nose up in the air as he side eyed his nemesis and the ginger.
Much to his chagrin, Draco lets out an undignified snort.

before a quiet and powerful voice breaks out,

So instead, Harry just growled, jaw clenching tightly as he swallowed dryly, watching the other boys movements. His fingers itched, ready to grab his wand if things needed to escalate past him threatening and scaring the other boy off.

"I… I.." a low, needy moan escapes Malfoy's lips before he's able to stop himself as he trembles against Harry's body that's pressed against him.
There's a heavy silence at which the Slytherin girl realizes her slip of the tongue and pales, glancing nervously at her best friend.
“Yes?” the voice responds just as
"And it just sl- wait what." The brunette froze in shock and unsure of what to do. Draco Malfoy was arrogant and petty and loudly obnoxious. But this...
"Why don't you do something, then you bloody cow-" Draco freezes from a hard fixated glare from his friend when he recoils in horror at his mistake.
He makes a weird face suddenly, as if trying to hold something back before,
Veritaserum or not, he was thankful he still had his biting sarcasm.
"Let's see how good it looks when I...." and Harry's voice carries out in a quiet husky tone for only the two of them to hear.
"Sorry," Harry called sheepishly, hand nervously rubbing at the back of his neck.
"What do you think your doing Potter- nobody touches me like that!" he sibilated harshly.
Harry happily listened to his two best friends talk, love and pride feeling his insides and he enjoyed the senseless babble before his thoughts began to drift and he started to day dream.
“Harry I-”

"Be nice," Harry huffed a warning tone, as he pulled sharply on the smaller blonde's ear.
Just when
"Is that your question, then Malfoy?" Harry drawls with
The blonde hangs his head before,
The fire place crackled as a silence seemed to stretch between everyone; Potter cupping and
"Now if you don't mind..." he calls dryly, as he arrogantly makes a show of sweeping his robe as he turns around with a flourish. He hopes to god that Potter hadn't heard Pansy's crude remark at a sick joke.
He was so close to the Gryffindor Draco could smell him, like fresh-cut grass of a Qudditch field and something sweet like treacle tart.
note that he HAS made time for the Gryffindor.
"Well your not helping any," she hissed back, before more then aggressively needed, inking her quill again. She hated when she had to explain something more then once.
"So… Draco," and the tones sweet with a hidden layer of malice as innocent eyes blink aggressively.
"How dare I?! Oh, please Malfoy. I'm sure you make a fantastic little submissive slut for Pansy," and there's a growled edge to his tone, something the blonde notices but is unaware of context.
He hated Potter, Potter hated him. End of story.
Draco feels himself growing dizzy, his mind blurring around the edges as he wonders if he's finally getting the concussion from the incident earlier in the night.
He wants to retort, 'As sure as my name is Draco Lucius Malfoy,' but a hard jab to the ribs has the boy

The Gryffindor girl watches, confused, as the two boys from different houses stumble away and out the door before anxiously meeting up, kissing desperately and passionately when they think they're free and clear from watchful eyes.
"Nothing, nothing..." Harry growls with narrowed eyes. Even with Slytherin and Gryffindor constantly fighting, Malfoy had never seen the other boy look at him like
Harry chuckled darkly, breath tickling and teasing at the nape of exposed pale skin on his clavicle.

"Why, do you got somewhere you need to be Weasley," Pansy calls coyly, and the ginger shoots her a glare.
"Well, this has been… something else, boys. I would like to say this has been fun, but I'm not
"And what would you say? Daddy, Potter is such a bad
"Draco?" a quiet voice off to the side seems to call, and it's the Slytherin girl's words that seem to set the brunette off again.
Hermione’s eyes widen at the interaction between the two houses, unable to hear what either boy had been saying; but their body reaction making it apparent.
"Oh I know," Malfoy thinks, with a wicked grin.
The other boy is so close…
He was still a Malfoy after all and Harry sodding Potter was

The Slytherin hates himself a little more knowing that deep down the answer is yes.
"Do you think it wise to say such words to me Potter?" the blonde hisses, growing more irrate when his nemesis smirk only grows wider.
And then if the spell was broken, Harry moved quick without thinking, as he caught the almost collapsing man and hauled him up, hands digging into his collar so as to not let the blonde fall.
But still...it was Malfoy... he shouldn't be thinking like that EVER but..

"H...Harry..?" A timid voice asked and it took everything in other boy's power not to curl the other man up in his lap and shield him away.
Malfoy had just assumed the Gryffindor would forget.
"What was that Draco," she called cheekily with a wild smile pressed against her face.
Draco huffed quietly to himself, annoyed at the shotty interrogation Potters friends were giving him as he rolled his eyes, tugging on the brunettes sleeve subtly.
With each moment that passes, the Slytherin boy grows redder and redder with embarrassment. Almost at his breaking point, the blonde considers voicing his indignation when a concerning thought comes to mind.

fucking off and leaving or 'accidentally' knocking the rest of the Veritaserum potion seemed like a good idea, he feels the tight bunch of his robes cling to his chest as he's yanked forcefully forward.
Draco's inner turmoil has the Slytherin seething with irrepressible rage as he struggles against the uncontrollable shiver.
The pale blonde stretches, making a show as he cracks his lithe spin.
The thought of embarrassing himself in front of his nemesis is enough to snap the blonde back to reality.
It's as if a light switch had gone off in both Slytherin boy's heads. Malfoy, upon hearing the words, whimpered, eyes growing unpossibly large as he seemed to collapse in on himself in defeat.

He sniffs the glass vile containing the Veritaserum once, stomach rearing in protest as he shudders away the thought; quickly handing it over to his nemesis before sitting back down beside the other Slytherin.
