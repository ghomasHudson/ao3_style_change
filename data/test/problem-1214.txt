Again, Draco ran his hand over it. Harry canted his hips to make it easier, and Draco felt his fingers dig into the skin above Draco’s shoulder blade. He rubbed again, and felt Harry tense, holding his breath as Draco pressed harder, moved his hand more firmly from Harry’s waistband, over his flies, to the juncture of his thighs.
“Yeah.” Harry’s chest heaves. He looks far more prepared to come than to hold off for a minute longer.
He scowled, his bottom lip plumping as he did. “That was different. The Ministry was corrupt, it was being run by Death Eaters.”
He spent two days looking into it in earnest after Granger called. It was a quick call, straight to the point. Croaker had begun to suspect that Harry wasn’t making as much progress as reported. She’d spoken with Harry and they’d decided on a change of plan. They wouldn’t need Draco to continue making his trips, though they both appreciated it very much and any outstanding bills should be directed to, etc. He lost interest after that, as well as all ability to focus. All he really heard was that Harry was gone. And he was happy for him. Truly. And proud of what they’d accomplished. He hadn’t always thought Harry would reach that point, and it was a wonderful thing. An achievement to be proud of. And he told himself at first that his introductory letter to the Headmistress at Uagadou was in the interest of racking up more of those. Until he thought, for a hundredth time, about the intensity of Harry’s eyes and his declarations of honesty, and admitted to himself that, while the question and the prospect of travel both intrigued him, they weren’t the only motivators.
“I didn’t realise guests were allowed to demolish the place. That’s years of wasted opportunities. Unless you’re going to start threatening to kick him out, too?”
Ron’s head was moving swiftly towards the bar, and Harry and Draco followed gladly, grabbing two Fawley’s from the bartender and downing them quickly.
She laughed. “Neither that trying nor about to become that much more interesting. Only one is for me. One is for the elves to take to Greg, even if he’s not the gala type, and one is for you to take to Harry.” She held a flute out to him. “He’s starting to get a little peaky from all the attention.”
Draco blinked. It stung more than he would’ve liked it to. “Telling people what you want, going after what you want, doesn’t make you a coward.”
They’re only a few yards into the aisle before it begins. “This,” Draco points about three shelves over, “To that.”
“Not to burn you?” Harry asked, seeming genuinely confused, like he couldn’t understand why Draco was asking such an obvious question.
The rush of Christmas is over at last. I’d assumed it would be a barren, lonely sort of holiday. That was a vast underestimation of Mother’s determination and Father’s pride. Instead of a funereal affair, it’s been bursting with cheer, only some of it obviously forced.
Draco pressed his forehead against the glass. There was so much to lose. Maybe Potter had lost sight of that? But it was all already lost if Potter’s decision was made and, for all intents and purposes, it was.
It slid free without struggle, and around Malfoy's wrists just as easily. Harry pulled it tight around them and took half a step back to admire his work.
The cold could not account for the thrilled look of visceral pleasure written across his face the moment his wet brush met stone. He never looked away, never wavered. Even in those few first, simple words, crudely scrawled on a pedestrian underpass, he gave himself over completely.
Harry sighed. “Yeah, I think so. I… it still makes me nervous, but I suppose I see what you were saying, about magic.”
“Excuse me.” He looked at Malfoy once more, then stood and followed Susan from the room. He barely resisted the urge to look over his shoulder.
Draco’s barely processed the tremendous, echoing racket, or what it means for his workload, when he realises it would be wise to duck.
“He is fond of a tantrum. Nothing compared to the coup in the Department of Mysteries after Granger left, I’ll grant. But I thought we were going to have to call the Aurors when the Minister told him we want to cut back MLE’s Research and Development budget to create a charity fund. On top of losing his would-be Super-Auror? Got to be a bit much for him.”
When Harry presses in, Draco braces his hands against Harry’s shoulder and pushes and, for one horrible second, he worries that he’s misunderstood. Then the backs of his knees collide with the mattress and he realises that it’s an encouragement, not a rejection
“Yes, Granger, we have. We’ve got charts and supplies and the box and one happily willing Parselmouth. We’re as well prepared as Ravenclaws on the eve of an exam.”
He continued onwards. Potter’s ribs, his sides. He placed a kiss at the top of his hip bone. Potter arched. His heart had pounded since their lips first touched, but the look of Potter rolling his hips was something else altogether. He met Potter’s moan with one of his own.
This evening’s observations were rudely interrupted by Pansy who, unfortunately, caught my telescope misdirected towards the pitch. Potter was practising. It’s only in my nature to take every competitive advantage.
“No, I mean–” He shook his head and exhaled through his nose, and his mouth turned down into a thin, mulish line. “Right, the files. That’s it? One phone call? That’s all it took?”
He can take it almost to the base and it’s perfect. His mouth’s full and it’s hot and salty, his hands are gripping Potter’s arse, pulling him closer, and then, then it happens, on an exhale.
But there’s no reason to believe another trial will go any better. And the idea of making an arse of himself in front of Draco yet again is…unappealing.
She picked up her fork and sliced into an egg white. “Haven’t heard from Prippa or Galder yet this morning, I take it?”
“Community service. And how.” Draco’s eyes are still trained on the knife. This particular blade has never, to his knowledge, been sunk into an Imperiused Muggle or run over a prisoner’s throat, but the resemblance is enough to turn his stomach. Still, he can’t tear his eyes away. Not when the alternative is seeing Potter’s reactions. “Do you know where Vanished objects go?”
Harry saw him reach for his trousers and pull them on, fastening them quickly and reaching for his shirt.
I’ve declined, of course. Potter might be a refreshing challenge, and he might look particularly sweet in his Quidditch leathers with a bit of post-battle muscle on him, but it would be more work than I’ve ever been inclined to put into a dalliance. More than Pansy’s arse is worth, and admitting that she’s got something I want would be disastrous, never mind the publicity that would come with breaking the boy wonder’s heart. If she’s half the woman I think she is that’s what she wants anyway, and she’d use it to get me on the ropes. Please. The only ropes I plan to see will have her tied to the bedposts.
Half a dozen quips hit the back of his teeth, and Draco barely ignored the urge to run. With a curt nod, he took the proffered seat.
“Yeah, well. Yeah. I’m glad the void was there. Doesn’t mean I should do more of it though. And it’s technically true, that they’re not all bad. I think actually they’re all kind of in the same position. I don’t know John as well, but Gawain… he really does want to do right by his Aurors, wants to keep people safe. But he’s got his own Robards and Croaker. It’s never ending.”
Harry’s not sure where the roaring sensation in his chest has come from, but he’d quite like it to stop.
Harry nodded and bowed his head again. As soon as he felt Malfoy's hand slide into the cleft of his arse he pushed back, so that Malfoy’s finger suddenly drove through the lingering resistance.
“We didn’t worry about it at the time,” Potter interrupted. “Really, just trying to be as thorough as possible. Making sure your records are complete. You know how it goes, with paperwork.”
Draco approached them quietly, willing his heart to slow, trying to ignore Potter’s presence at the door. He slipped one from the curve of its mother’s body and lifted her for examination. She mewled plaintively and scrabbled at the sleeve of his robes.
The surface was in sight, and this was muscle memory. They could fight; he’d catch up to a fight. “Problem?”
He thinks about Harry’s declarations in the cloakroom, tries to remember all the words he was too shocked to really hear. From the recesses of his mind, he pulls out sentence fragments he can almost be sure of. Things about wanting that weren’t in the past tense. Things about hope.
Pansy’s been throwing tantrums all week. Huffy little snits and the usual barbs, but more frequently than even her usual. No idea what it’s about, but it’s especially strange for being accompanied by an eagerness that’s notable even for her. Very handsy. Bending over, stopping by on her way back from the shower, lots of cleavage. Which for Pansy means that her nipples are on the verge of a prison break at any given moment.
It’s quiet as tombs in here, at fucking last. Putting the eighth years in our own tower might’ve seemed like a bright idea, but it’s just a different sort of battle. The Ravenclaws demand constant silence in the interest of making the most of the “unprecedented academic opportunity” to retake courses they’ve already taken and have threatened to block off their corridor. Even if the idea of treating the common room like the library wasn’t patently absurd Finnigan’s propensity for explosions, Weasley’s insistence on nightly games of Wizard’s Chess, and Pansy’s determination to loudly faux-console every marginally disgruntled witch or wizard in sight would make silence impossible. The Hufflepuffs spend most of their time hovering nervously at the edges of conflict. Granger and Nott are about ready to defect to the Ravenclaw faction. Every evening ends in an eruption of one sort or another. Potter may have arrived at the only sensible solution: frequent trips to the Quidditch pitch that keep him well out of the Common Room until things die down.
He squinted and stepped forward, perhaps to argue, but it was at that moment that he noticed that I was…a bit further behind in the changing process. I’d started stroking myself when I cast the
Pansy folds the page over and passes it to him. Her eyes never leave Draco, and he barely resists the urge to squirm.
ed. “One never knows.” She leaned back and folded her arms. “Besides which, I happen to think Mind Healing is perfectly respectable.”
He’s pretty sure he can feel Draco watching him all the way down the aisle, though maybe he’s just imagining it because when he peeks out of the corner of his eye, Draco’s intent on the books in front of him.
Only an hour, though. Potter was talking to Ron Weasley this time, when the slate beneath them cracked into dozens of pieces. Weasley took it in his stride, crouching to repair it quickly. Potter looked quite ready to run back to the void. He settled for craning his neck frantically until he found Draco.
“A requisition number appears on pages B-16 and B-17 of the standard requisition forms, alongside explicit instructions to make note of your requisition number for future reference.”
“Leave that to me. Our next group meeting isn’t too far off.” He frowned. “Unfortunately. Isn’t there something else you can use?”
“Not the point. I looked down. As one does. Gave a few instructions. When I looked back up he was gone. Figured he’d left. But I would swear on Slytherin’s grave that I saw his eyes after that, and we all know about the cloak. When it was all said and done, this had turned to embers and left a rather nasty scorch mark on the counter.”
“Dr Malfoy,” Shacklebolt sighed, “I have known Harry since he was in school. I have fought by his side and, in so doing, seen him turned into all of those things, for all sorts of purposes. Somewhere along the line, believe it or not, I grew fond.”
Point being, there hasn’t been anything to print that would’ve put Potter at risk for such un-heroic exposure. Nothing that would’ve used something Potter’s done or somewhere he’s been to put any member of his inner circle in line for public scrutiny, and if Draco ever knew him at all, that’s more likely than anything to set him off.
Draco blinked once, and again, and shook his head once to clear it. “Of course. You… That’s what you want?”
The void was under his childhood bedroom. He’d become experienced enough in the course of his work to tolerate the lack of magic, but the thought of being deprived of magic unexpectedly if something went wrong, of waking in the middle of the night and feeling its absence, was not exactly appealing.
“Yeah,” Harry answered, keeping his composure more successfully than Draco would’ve thought. “There were other things going on.”
Draco turns on him then, arms folded, eyes filled with as much cold fury as he can muster. “Maybe it’s because you’re fucking their staff.”
This time, Millie’s clink came, harder than he’d expected but all the more satisfying for the sound of crystal on crystal. “Cheers.”
“Being able to navigate the facility more rapidly and relying more heavily on time and date recollections may speed the effort. I can collect all items that may be yours and positively identify those that are part of the Black holdings, after which you need only return to positively identify more recent acquisitions. I will be able to more efficiently balance this task with my other responsibilities and you will be free to spend your time elsewhere.”
“In ways that we never would’ve discovered without taking Muggle contributions seriously on their own terms.” Draco tried to centre himself. “Their understanding of the nervous system far outpaces our own. Ditto their research on the conductivity of bones. I study Muggle science. I teach Muggle as well as magical students. And while we haven’t yet found a way to apply our results to Muggle medicine, it’s because their bodies aren’t reliably receptive to magical ingredients. Charms research begins next spring.”
He started with the mother and daughter. Their murders had created the biggest upset, and some of the details had made it into the papers. They’d been found on Diagon Alley, blown away from each other by the force of a spell. Draco thought a Blasting Curse would be the Aurors’ likeliest guess, Confringo or Reducto. They shared the same magical foundation, and the Aurors wouldn’t think to look for variants unless there was something unusual about the scene. They’d figure that mother and daughter had been thrown twenty feet by a classic Blasting Curse. The Aurors would have found them banged up on the store fronts and assumed their injuries came from impact.
“Phillips,” the young man offers. “Right that way, sir. First left, next right, and straight on to the front office.
Draco could practically see her biting back a comment about how he would’ve known, and how she would’ve known that he knew. It was a very good, if wholly unneeded, reminder of why he’d left England in the first place.
Draco had rarely found that encouraging Potter to talk worked out well for anyone involved. So, he didn’t.
“It works because I have to be distracted. It’s not like learning another language. I have to just... zone out and get into it.”
Of course, Malfoy didn’t actually miss a beat. “What kind of art is it if it serves its meaning up on a platter and doesn’t engage with the viewer at all? If it exists simply as a passive object?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I know about the Elder Wand. I’ve been master of the Elder Wand. I understand the importance of not advertising the Elder Wand’s whereabouts. And if we’re starting with Unbreakable Vows again, I’ll be perfectly happy to take my lunch in Paris.”
He didn’t fully grasp how taken he was, how overwhelmed with it all, until Harry leaned back, and Draco realised he’d stopped moving.
“Good,” Draco soothed. “That’s right.” He pushed in again and twisted, and Potter whined thinly. “Your arse is bloody gorgeous.” He leaned in to catch Potter’s ear between his teeth. “I’m going to put my cock in it.”
He looks beneath the counter for correspondence. He can open letters, surely. And he can alphabetise them. The alphabet will still make sense.
Then Draco felt a tug on his own shirt. Harry worked it free from his waistband. Draco could see, now, Harry’s chest rising and falling with each quick breath. Harry rolled the bottom button of Draco’s shirt between his fingers and looked up for permission. Nodding, Draco moved his own hands to the top button, slipping it through the hole and moving to the next, and Harry worked from the bottom. They met in the middle, Draco’s hand covering Harry’s to slide the last button through.
Potter looks over his shoulder, concerned, when his belt is fully in hand. “Are you—?” He turns around. His chest is covered in the same coarse hair Draco remembers, only more of it. “You’re not getting undressed.” He covers his chest with folded arms.
“Tell that to Bill’s face.” It was almost under Ron’s breath. But not quite. Harry knew he’d been meant to hear it. He just didn’t know what to say.
Potter looks wounded. It’s maddening. If Potter’s not even going to recognise his own tables, if he’s not even going to bother accepting them when Draco sets them down right in front of him, Draco can hardly be bothered with finding them.
“Yeah, me neither,” Harry chuckled. “But it was sort of in front of me. All of the cases we handled that were really to do with the war and all the ways it messed people up. And working with Healer Barrett. And working with you. I hadn’t known that there was anything more to magic than just pointing and casting, you know? But that was wrong. And we saw a lot of cases, actually, that were related. People getting in fights, drunk and disorderlies, violence at home, kids getting scared and causing damage with their magic. Just all the time. And they were the worst cases, because there was nothing you could do. Part of why I liked the away cases so much. Dragon egg smugglers, that’s straightforward enough. But all this stuff, the post-war trauma stuff, that’s—what do you do with that? With people who love each other or want to be good, who don’t really have criminal instincts, but they’re so angry, or scared, and they can’t contain it, or their magic can’t, and there are all sorts of damage done. And the Aurors are a plaster, when it needs a lot more than that.
Harry wrapped his fingers around the sides of Draco’s hand, steadying himself as he stood. He met Draco’s eyes straight on. “Yeah. Yeah, I would.”
Draco steps over the dropped box to come towards him, and Harry’s heart leaps at the promise of familiarity, until Draco comes to stand several feet away from him from him, hands folded primly on the worktop.
“No, thank you.” Potter took another step back and shot Draco a pleading look. “I, um, I’m not feeling terribly well anyway, so—”
“Dr Malfoy.” Shacklebolt sat forward, his voice considerably calmer than, if just as authoritative as, Robards’ or Croaker’s. “You are, of course, correct. We are all concerned for Harry’s health and safety, and I suspect my colleagues are simply disappointed to hear that he has a longer road ahead than we had hoped. Though I will confess that I share their concerns about his schedule, particularly with regard to certain pending legislation in the Wizengamot.”
“Good.” Draco pulled closer next to him, and every few steps Harry could feel Draco’s hand almost brush against his own. “But,” Draco went on, “I didn’t just bring you out here for the scenery.”
“Yes, I think so.” Potter shrugged, returning to total calm. “We worked on a potions case a while back and had to read a lot of journals for that.”
“And for harnessing wandless magic,” Croaker added, a repulsively dreamy look on his face. “Or spell amplification. Salazar and Godric both.”
“Then I suppose I ought to have dinner with him again and hope for more charitable ones. At the very least, the public can be convinced that I haven’t poisoned him.”
Potter wasn’t especially talkative, and, if nothing else, Draco was fairly certain that mute awkwardness was not the sort of show Robards had had in mind.
“On the dunes,” Draco said. “He’ll fly out over the water. If he’s moving on, he’ll head south. If not, he’ll circle back.”
Harry gasped as Draco’s tongue slid towards its quarry, as Draco ran it around the rim of his hole and then slid over it. Fingernails raked down his back again, and he gasped and keened when the trail ended in a hard slap against his arse. And then Draco was lapping at him, and Harry’s arsehole clenched in an effort to pull him in deeper.
Harry’s head snapped up for the express purpose of looking at him like he ought to consider a trip to St Mungo’s.
Luna patted his shoulder gently. “If it gets to be a bit too much, you can always come visit the Humdingers. Just remember a Shield Charm. Better safe than sorry!”
Because I can perform, as always. Do my best to look appropriately contrite. I’m so sad and damaged, the poor little former Death Eater who can’t possibly understand the power of love. Perhaps Potter will have to get close enough to give a demonstration.
’s news has preceded him. On the one hand, he’s pleased that his staff are keeping track of their competitors. And that they had the good sense not to run anything about it without consulting him. On the other, he has no idea how they ever manage to dig up anything worthwhile when their whispering and staring is about as subtle as an Erumpent. And he would like to throttle each and every one of them.
Malfoy sagged back, bum hitting the edge of his desk as he sat. Harry took him in; Malfoy was, from waist to shoulders, perfectly composed. But his pupils were blown wide, and his cock was out, and he looked as deeply satisfied as Harry felt.
You stand. Your knees twinge, your head swims. He holds out a hand, one blue vein pulsing at the base of his palm.
“Like policies permitting the construction of magical voids and wards for long-term treatment of magically unstable patients. And considerable resources devoted to biomagical research while—as you, unfortunately, know quite well—there’s nowhere in the UK doing this kind of work, or setting aside resources for it.” As he spoke, Draco’s stomach sank with the weight of his realisation. With its irrefutability.
Granger interrupted their impromptu staring contest. “Dr Malfoy, as I’ve explained, Harry’s attendance at these events is of the utmost importance. That’s true, as I suspect you are suggesting, for the charities that benefit from it, but it is also true for Harry himself. He’s deeply committed to supporting each cause, and would be distressed to miss the year’s biggest opportunity to support the magical community.”
,” and looked up. He gestured with his wand. “Window.” Harry snapped around. Draco tried to reassure. “It’s fine. No harm done.”
The hare dissolved. Harry had the feeling it had been more than a wildlife fact, but even for Luna it was cryptic.
He may know, but it’s apparent that his staff are less familiar with the intricacies of Potter’s habits. And, he reasons, what if they’re right? What if he’s opening the paper to liability by misnaming Potter? He has to be sure. Has to check, for the sake of thoroughness. For professional obligation.
“You asked if I was up to the challenge,” Draco hummed, lifting his head while dragging his nails down Harry’s back. “A Malfoy is always prepared.”
Draco watched him try to collect them in his lap. Some stayed. One scrambled up his arm. The mother cat set one on his knee and tried to groom it.
“Leave Potter alone, would you?” Draco said, his annoyance becoming apparent. “He’s our guest, Pansy.”
“There’s no need for that, Dr Malfoy. Obviously, we are well aware that the results have been less than ideal.”
“Once confirmed, you may visit the Office of Boring Paperwork in person to request the specific forms necessary to disclose your requisition number.”
“Nothing.” Harry raises his hands to gesture and drops them again. “If you’re someone who likes fine. But since when is fine enough for
Malfoy’s shoulders tensed as he took a step closer, and that last thread gave. “Fuck’s sake, Malfoy! I brought it in, I just want to see how it is!”
“Bespoke, Potter. The Huntsman house style. Hammick still does mine himself, and he’s both understanding and discreet. Had a wizard in the family, Hogwarts ‘63.” He cuffed a sleeve, revealing a sliver of fine green silk and the very tip of a wand. “He understood.”
He veered away from Malfoy in search of a foothold. It didn’t make sense. Malfoy didn’t make sense. He hadn’t made sense before the conversation, and he made even less sense since.
Draco doesn’t miss it. His smile returns, slow and unmistakably salacious. “You do. Though it’s a wonder how you have any energy left.”
He was hot on my heels nevertheless, restless and restive, nudging me out of his way, urging me to move faster, to do more. Having come so far in our partnership, it would have been rather a waste to strangle him. Instead, I turned, palm extended, meaning to tell him to stop it, step back.
Right, Draco thought. That might also explain it; Robards’ thanks weren’t meant for him. Wardwell raised an eyebrow at Draco, who knew better than to ignore her signals. He returned Robards’ nod and sat up even straighter than he had been. He thought of adding a “Thank
They stand, staring at each other in silence, for a moment that seems to drag on endlessly. Draco’s stomach feels tight and sour and, worst of all, he’s not exactly sure why. He’s called far worse on a fairly regular basis. Potter’s outburst is pure sentimentality, mawkish and simple, the sort of thing he can barely tolerate at the best of times. It’s all the more reason to get Potter out of here as quickly as possible.
“Do you remember, as I do, the wonder of the Entrance Hall? A thousand floating candles, the Grand Staircase unfolding before you?” Many of the members were smiling and nodding, and he smiled back, surveying the crowd. “Do you remember the first time you saw that staircase move?” He chuckled, and was matched by voices from the press gallery and the bench. “I didn’t know how I would ever find my way.
Draco had decided more than once before that when all was close to lost, drastic measures were entirely appropriate. Any means, after all.
Draco presses his forehead into Harry’s and lets himself be pulled, until their bodies mirror each other almost perfectly, until Draco’s mouth hovers over Harry’s and he dips down again to taste him.
“You really have no sense of irony at all, do you? It’s all black and white, good guys and bad guys. I was once a bad guy, so that’s all I’ll ever be. I’m—what? Rich? Hobnobbing with well-respected artists? And therefore must be incapable of anything remotely worthwhile. Merlin.” Draco sank back against the wall next to Potter. “That’s it, isn’t it? Once and future evil. That’s all I’ll ever be to you.”
“Almost,” Draco confirmed. “Not Pansy and Greg and Millie and Blaise. Not Crabbe, either, or Theo or Daphne. They were good friends, no matter how it looked from the outside. And particular things about how my life went. I’m glad I played Quidditch, that I was a prefect. I’m glad I did my Potions NEWT. That worked out exceptionally well in the end. And there are plenty of other things. I’d like to think there were good things about me then, even if the obvious looms large. And about my life. I don’t regret it all. But I would change parts of it.” He sighed again. “You can imagine which ones. And I did change them, as soon as I could.”
Blood pounded in his ears. His mouth felt full and warm, his limbs light. His prick was leaking, just as Harry’s was. He knew he was close too. Closer than he wanted to be. And if he was going to come, and come soon, he wanted it to be everything it could be for Harry.
He realises, with a bit of a jolt, that he really doesn’t want to know. Doesn’t want to see Potter with his arm around the Weaselette, smiling, kissing her cheek, doing whatever it is they’d done as a couple. He remembers, vaguely, though he thinks with certainty, Potter telling him that it hadn’t worked between them. But perhaps it isn’t about the youngest Weasley so much as Draco’s newfound and rather unfortunate understanding that he doesn’t want to see Potter with anyone.
“Any other clothing is entirely your responsibility!” She yelled after him. “And you’re buying the next drink!”
Potter’s hand was warm and firm, and he followed Potter’s lead as they started down the street. There was no reason to keep holding on, except that he wanted to, and Potter seemed to want to let him. It might’ve been Potter’s warm palm, or the exhaustion of a night with very little sleep, but the city felt quieter than usual. Brighter. Full of promise.
Draco snapped his eyes to Snape’s portrait, and Harry couldn’t help a tiny smile at the realisation that they’d wandered. “Buggery and depravity, sir. I thought you were rather well acquainted.”
He ran a knuckle over Potter’s arse. “You’ve got a lovely arse, you know.” And there it was again, that odd reaction.
Instead, he reached for his trousers and fished out a pocket watch. The clock read ten minutes till seven.
He barely manages to summon the bin in time. Even once his stomach is thoroughly emptied, part of him wishes he could keep going, that he could rid himself of these feelings right along with the Scotch.
“It’s my stuff, isn’t it? Even the stuff I don’t know about yet. I told you that might happen. And there’s probably more new stuff than you think, that you won’t know about straight away. So I could be helpful with that.”
“Why, Draco. Good morning. Deigning to raise your head out of the upholstery to greet the peasants – how kind.”
It tasted as perfectly fresh as any Draco had picked as a child walking through the orchards or stopping to rest mid-flight. The hint of pear, the thickness of the flesh. Draco swallowed. “It’s perfect.”
Surely that hasn’t just disappeared. This isn’t just like Draco was before, professional and, Harry readily admits, good at his job. It’s colder than that, like he just wants Harry gone. But Harry was there, he knows now,
Draco crouched beside Potter and turned him to lie on his back. Even without moving, Potter did a remarkable job of conveying murderous rage. “I’m sorry. I’m going to release you, but when we believe a patient may behave unpredictability, especially with uncontrolled magic…if you run I may have to do it again. Understood?”
Granger turned to run after him. Draco imagined a continuation of their earlier conversation, Potter dodging questions and trying ceaselessly to reassure her. He lifted his wand and shut the door. “Don’t.”
Potter frowned. “Yes,” he said, though it sounded less certain. “Maybe it’s something you said earlier.”
Draco felt warmth accompanying the light. It was a gentle heat, and he relaxed into the chair behind him. Something rustled his hair, and a look at the palm tree confirmed that it was a breeze.
It wasn’t useful. Harry knew it wasn’t useful. Third rule of a stakeout (after ‘don’t fall asleep’ and ‘don’t lose focus’) was to put up with your partner’s weird foibles without saying anything that would compromise the integrity of the mission, including by pissing them off. “Why the fuck did you do this, anyway?”
After leaving Harry with the kittens in the conservatory, Draco had cancelled his breakfast tray and got Millie on the Floo. He wanted to talk to her before the hearing. He was less surprised to find that Pansy was also there than he was to find that Greg wasn’t. He’d thought they had breakfast together most days, and said as much.
“But,” Potter rushes on, “we don’t have to stop. I know how you feel about efficiency. You know, getting things done.” Potter cringes. “I’ll be okay with just a couple of biscuits.”
He looks up to find Harry staring down at him, worry apparent on his features. Draco’s stomach clenches. “What is it?”
All that softness has been replaced with severity. The soft halo of his hair has been slicked back; Harry can imagine errant strands being forced to perform hard labour for their disobedience. His robes are pressed within an inch of their lives. His shoulders are straight and firm, even in the midst of this newly created disarray.
Once he was done, and Harry saw that they were safe, Draco sat back against the chair as he had last time and watched Harry close his eyes. He seemed, again, to drift away, and the room grew warmer and sunlight seemed to emanate from the joints between the ceiling’s glass panels. And when it grew warmer than it had the last time, if the room felt humid and hot and closer to a tropical beach than a Scotland spring day, Draco didn’t think for a second that it was a sign of magic gone awry.
He could just show up to one of these things and run into Potter. F and L can tell him what Potter’s RSVP’d to, and then they’d be on more equal footing, and that’s not a bad idea.
at the ready if the Statute of Secrecy was broken—a job which had fallen to Harry, whom Robards thought was especially good at blending in with Muggles, and which Harry thought was a colossal waste of both Ministry resources and his own Friday night.
Draco goggled. One kiss with a man and Harry was planning to come out. It was so typical of him, so blindly Gryffindorish, that Draco could’ve kissed him then and there if he wasn’t so set on hearing the rest of what Harry had to say.
He pumped Potter’s cock and fucked into him, and it was almost…it almost felt like enough, in a way nothing ever did, not any of it. All those victories, but never the pure, blank pleasure of wanting and getting so viscerally, so certainly. And when Potter shouted for, “More, fucking
“Gryffindor,” Draco repeats, a little louder. “All these famous tales of epic bloody magical swords that are meant prove you’re the heir of Gryffindor. Totally unnecessary for anyone who’s ever heard you ramble.”
Between the sex and the fighting, Harry was so dazed that he wasn't sure, after the fact, how he'd made it outside. He remembered a buzzing in his ears, but wasn't sure if it was the lifts or his own frustration. He remembered a pounding, but wasn't sure if it was his heart or his boots against the lobby floor.
“I thought about it,” Blaise said. “After the war. Figured it might be better. Get away from the expectations. Even if it meant going abroad. Even if it would’ve meant going to the Muggle world.”
“Sir.” The client leers at that; Draco crosses his arms against the possibility of another advance. “The Vanishing Department is not liable for the condition of items. Any testing or other assessment is the sole responsibility of –”
interview him, and donates money to St Mungo’s and Hogwarts in his own name to be a good role model, and donates thrice as much anonymously, and lets Molly hug him for as long as she wants every time he comes and goes.
Draco had never had Sola’s private lunch service before. He’d been hearing about the Iberico pork and parmesan foam for ages, though.
The magic of the park already seemed like a distant memory. The stairwell was cold concrete. The light was fluorescent. Something tugged at Harry, keeping him glued to the spot. It didn’t feel like it was over, like it should be over.
At last, he cleared his throat and resorted to simple reason. “You’re my patient. I care about your wellbeing. As a researcher and a clinician, I am concerned with finding the best outcomes and correcting previous teams’ unethical lapses in experimental procedures.” He paused, looking again for the right words to explain why it all felt so urgent. “And frankly, Potter, I do believe I owe you one.”
Draco looked up at him. “Preventing harm to the patient includes harm from the patient him or herself, and in your current state—clearly angry and determined to bottle it up—that’s where we were headed.”
Pansy and Blaise come round for breakfast twice. Pansy is unusually subdued and Draco, to his dismay, is more than half convinced that it’s out of concern.
“Not with total certainty, no. My expertise is not in Divination. But I’m as sure I can be short of that. You must know that your tests this afternoon weren’t promising.”
Harry waited a moment, and then seemed to falter. At the prospect of losing his nerve, he went on. “The other thing is, if you said yes, you’d—or, you could—be back in England. With me. Not that that will be persuasive, or that I expect that. But if you did, I’d really like—” He sighed. “Sometimes I really wish I didn’t have to deal with this magic thing
Draco didn’t leave the library until well past ten. He’d Floo called Chloé to get the draft articles and ask for any new results and was as convinced as ever that taking the damn thing out would leave Potter even more magically impaired than he already was, probably permanently. He’d also done everything he could think of to find a pattern. Time of day, dates, number of days, anything. He’d given up when he got to reverse alphabetisation by name of person recording the incident.
“If you’re going to completely abandon all context, history, conceptual underpinning, advancement through medium, and meta-analysis, sure, Potter, that’s what it is.”
“As does he, I think, but much more literally. And it’s not talking to people. It’s not every time he talks to someone. It’s when something upsets him, or gets under his skin somehow. When he’s outside of the void and running, completely focused on that, he’s perfectly fine. No incidents. And when he’s casting spells, straightforward, plain old casting with a wand, his precision and endurance are above average.”
“Dr Malfoy,” Shacklebolt interrupted, “perhaps now that Ms Granger has revealed that piece of information, you can understand our need for discretion.”
There was no resistance. It clicked open easily. The door was heavy—he thought, for one heart-stopping moment, that it might be stuck—but that was all. He leaned into it, and it opened onto the pavement.
He almost manages it, but Draco can’t quite suppress a wince, just a tiny one. “Yes, well. It’s very tasteful.”
“It’s like you think it’s the end of the world, being without magic. But it isn’t. There’s still this.”
“Yes. I’ll have to sign some thank you notes before we go, but if you’ll Side-Along me to St. Pancras we can catch the train at 4:43 and be back in time for dinner.”
, nor do I particularly anticipate enjoying the experience. But, having done this before –” Harry’s eyes widened “— yes, Potter, having done this before I can guarantee that I won’t cause any injury. And if you have another suggestion, I’m happy to entertain it.”
Harry drops his hand to brush a knuckle over Draco’s bollocks, sweeping over them and pressing against the skin underneath, just before his arse.
Draco did his best to hide his confusion. Potter’s abilities were far beyond what he had expected. “Right.” Draco broke off a spring of the yew hedgerow that grew at the border of the path to his left. “
Draco’s not biting, though he matches the appearance of Potter’s smile. “You just had to include the ‘Lucius,’ didn't you? Wouldn’t want anyone to forget that, would we?”
He settled for a martini instead, and wiled away the early evening with a week’s worth of the crossword. Traffic in the corridors sped up and then slowed as seven turned to eight. Cleaning crews appeared and disappeared as eight crept towards nine. By five to, the lights on the floor were all out save Draco’s desk lamp. At five past, the diffuse glow of the city was the only thing that lit Potter’s silhouette from behind as he filled Draco’s doorway.
“No, Potter. Tell me or I’ll stop.” He drove his fingers as deep as he could to punctuate the point.
“Yes. A proper table setting requires linens. I’ve no doubt that you’ve inherited quite a collection.”
Harry smirked and turned to face him. “Your performance on the other hand – got a bit enthusiastic, didn’t you? Got a secret thing for snakes?”
“Yeah.” Potter smiled at the apple and turned it over again. “Though I guess I don’t know if they’re any good.”
Were he a Slytherin, I'd have lived that night in terror, imagining elaborate extortions or dramatic revelations, all ending with my wrists in shackles. Were he a Hufflepuff, I'd have imagined that he wanted to consult his keepers, whoever they might be. If a Ravenclaw, I'd have chalked it up to thorough investigation. But with Gryffindors there's no telling.
Halfway to the Floo, he realised it was an international call. It was probably Pansy, reminding him again to clear a few days for the Paris Haute Couture Autumn/Winter shows, or Greg, who had done the blueprints for the stables expansion and was on to design a proper standalone greenhouse for the grounds, and liked to consult. And he hadn’t exactly warned them not to call.
His pounding steps reverberated down the shaft like pennies falling into a well, sounding smaller and smaller as he left them behind him, and eventually vanishing into soundless nothing.
Draco blinked. “Congratulations. You’ve packed so much quasi-passive aggression into a single sentence I’m not even sure where to begin.”
“Nothing you say in the next minute will be held against you. How would you characterise their relationship?”
take him out of the void, repeatedly and, depending on the results, for increasing periods of time. I see that the Unspeakables haven’t—which is itself far less than ideal for his long-term prospects—but, more immediately, I can’t find a solution if I can’t observe the problem.”
Never mind that it’s full of ground unicorn horn, and if she got Finch-Fletchley up her twat it’s only because she got that up his nose.
“Peace,” Draco said again. That, too, felt true, though he’d never said it before. Redemption, setting things right…those had always seemed like the sorts of things a person could fight for, could talk about fighting for. But this was true too, and it settled, easy and light, into his bones.
“Very exclusive.” I lift my glass in salute and take a slow sip. I want to watch him assess the room. See if he figures it out.
With a ragged moan, Draco slips his cock into the cleft of Harry’s arse. Harry feels a fleeting stab of nervousness. Then Draco drags his cock over Harry’s hole and it’s replaced by sparks of pleasure.
Potter was sitting, quite unassumingly, in a yellow bergère, with a book closed neatly in his lap, his index finger still marking his place. Between a white Aran jumper and not-quite-brown Muggle trousers, he was practically camouflaged into the room. He didn’t move until Granger approached him, her arms out and voice laden with worry, asking how he was, how he was feeling, what he needed. Potter shook his head, smiled, stood, and folded her into a hug, and Draco thought he could lip-read a few mumbled reassurances. At least, the general idea was clear.
Halfway through the living room he stopped, turned, and walked to the desk. He grabbed a piece of parchment and jotted a list of notes, affixing it to the mantel with a sticking charm.
“As long as we’re agreed on the troll part.” She looked at the head of the table and her face went blank. Without comment, she took the seat immediately to the right, drew her wand, and filled her wineglass almost to the top. Greg slid in beside her with a quiet, and much more relaxed, smile for Draco.
Draco gaped for a moment, fighting through the tiredness of a night spent devising new ideas to try to reconcile the quiet, apologetic man in front of him with the ball of rage that had walked past him the night before.
The Junior Undersecretary nods and makes a beeline for the staircase. Potter steps out of Draco’s grip and crosses his arms, looking far more confrontational than the situation calls for. “Didn’t know you were in such a rush to leave.”
He doesn’t know this, not yet, but, given my endowment, fingerfucking has become a particular mastery of mine. I crook my fingers up to hit his prostate and feel him tighten around them.
“If your plan was to ignore us, we would’ve just gone to Pennifold’s of Diagon Alley,” Pansy adds with a sniff.
“Make things right,” Draco finished. “Not—I can never make things right. I know that. There’s no undoing what was done. But, well.”
This time, Phillips does offer some form of useful assistance. “We recommend starting with a test jump, sir. Then, if that proves successful—if you’re able to maintain height and stability—we would move on to more advanced manoeuvres. Travel, flips, anything you might need in a chase.”
what you were hiding?” Draco spits the first word, still refusing to face Harry. Still wondering when Marcel’s pants will turn up.
He ran a hand down Potter’s spine, tripping his finger over the bump of each vertebra, and straight onto the crease at the top of his arse.
Potter frowned down at their interlaced fingers. “I can’t, sometimes. Sometimes running is the only thing I know how to do.”
“Damnit, Malfoy!” Potter takes a step forward. His magic is crackling around him again, and Draco fights the urge to step back. “I’m sure it’s hard for you to understand this, spoilt rotten as you were, but not all of us had families, okay? And everything I have left of mine was in that fucking house. If you think I wouldn’t miss that, you’re even more heartless than your reputation suggests.”
As if on cue from some particularly benevolent deity—quite possibly one that his father had paid off while sitting in this very seat—the door slid open again, admitting Granger and Millie. Behind them, peeking over Mill’s head, Draco saw the unforgettable, unmistakeable cheekbones of Blaise Zabini.
By 1:59pm he was outside Potter’s door, watching the seconds tick away on his pocket watch. He let himself in at exactly two, only to find Potter deep in conversation with a fatherly-looking man in his 40s. Potter looked up, saw Draco and, rather apologetically, told his visitor he’d lost track of time. They shook hands, and the man nodded at Draco and saw himself out.
Except about the reactions they'd get. He’s right about that. It would be a disaster. Potter’s had enough of public attention, that much is clear. He won’t want any more of it. Unless he wants something secret. Bile rises in Draco’s throat.
That woman has a fake smile composed entirely of icicles and goblin-forged blades. “Why, Wiltshire, of course. You know, Malfoy Manor. They got it for a song at a one of those auctions the Wizengamot’s ordered. Fire sales, more like. Seems the Ministry couldn’t wait to be rid of it. Easy to see why, don’t you think?”
When he tumbles out of the Floo, his outfit suggests that he hasn’t. He’s dressed for a club, tight jeans and barely there tank and the hideously worn leather jacket he insists on wearing, which he claims is vintage and which is, to its credit, softer than silk against bare skin.
He focuses on the bookshelf. He’s only at T. Is Draco really that much better at this? Is he really that distracted?
Twenty-eight days after the Battle of Hogwarts Harry pulls his invisibility cloak over his shoulders and steps through his front door. Someone’s sold him out – his money’s on Mundungus – and there are reporters camped out all up and down the street. He gives them the slip.
Draco began to move his finger steadily, slowly, in and out of Potter’s arse. He could feel Potter relax around him, could feel the slickness of his finger as it entered Potter’s hole. Noticed the tension in Potter’s shoulder’s ebb, and his forearm come to rest against the glass. When Draco next withdrew, Potter followed him back.
“That’s not what I—Fuck. That’s not what I meant!” Potter’s inability to stand still was driving Draco mad, not least of all because it felt like the embodiment of Potter’s unwillingness to listen. “I meant that there’s no one else who was doing this, or who could. I know it’s not what you want to hear. It’s not what anyone wants to hear. But these people—these posh arseholes—don’t listen to the Ministry! They don’t listen to Hogwarts! I promise you, Potter, I speak from experience. You can require all the Muggle Studies classes you want. Those who still believe in pure-blood supremacy will use every Floo call, every letter, every visit, and every meal at hols to teach their children that it’s a bunch of weak-minded propaganda for weak-minded wizards who need to be ‘guided’ by the old pure-blood families. You have to get through to the posh arseholes before anything else will really change and for Circe’s sake will you stand
Thinks about their most recent conversation in the parlour at 12 Grimmauld. How hard it had been not to remember the times they’d fucked over the back of a dusty armchair in that room, the times he’d reduced Harry to begging on the threadbare rug in front of the fireplace. How confident Harry is now, in the refinished room, watching Draco. How well Harry still knows him.
When he reaches Draco’s waistband he takes a steadying breath and keeps going, lowering Draco’s flies to reveal a patch of honey blond hair. Harry looks up, surprised, and is met with a bemused smile. “Ruins the line.” Draco whispers, and runs a gentle hand through Harry’s hair.
Fighting the heavy satiation in his limbs, he struggled up and tugged, pulling Harry towards him, onto the bed and onto his back.
He thought, at first, it might be his office, but his eyelids were leaden under the weight of last night’s whisky, and since the odds of his feeling beholden to scheduling reminders were slim on the best of days… well. He wasn’t especially moved.
“Their father must have been a Kneazle. Their mother is a cat. She may not be able to provide enough nourishment to support their magical growth, in which case we’d supplement her milk with store-bought Kneazle milk or dandelion root.”
Harry half-shrugged, as if to brush off the question. “No, just thought about it. It’s chilly, you know? Figured that was good motivation.”
He watches the way Harry’s biceps flex as he unbuttons his shirt, thrills at the sound of his belt sliding through the loops.
“Nothing.” Potter shook his head quickly. “Nothing. Never mind. What do you want? Let’s go. We can go.”
Draco heard, before he even had time to turn and see, Harry’s sigh of relief as they stepped out onto the Terrace Gardens. The chill in the air and the utter silence of a winter night were an instant relief to Draco, and Harry looked as though the same was true for him.
Either way, the rain kept Draco from walking the ten minutes to Sola. He had been relying on the walk for a chance to clear his head, but at least—thanks in no small part to generations of Malfoys past—there wasn’t a Michelin-starred restaurant in Paris that didn’t have an Apparition point.
He blinked. “Yes. Mostly. Not Voldemort. Not Umbridge or the Carrows. But people who want to change.”
“It isn’t all Inferi and Severing Charms, anyway,” Malfoy replied. “We’re also looking at how components of the Babbling Curse could help people with a fear of public speaking. It’s very promising.”
Draco watched Shacklebolt and Granger share an attempt at non-verbal communication, darting away just long enough to catch Millie’s very miniature nod of approval.
“I quit the Aurors because every time they sent me out the press showed up and someone was gonna get hurt some day, and I quit the Aurors because people are still trying to kill me and I didn’t want anyone else to die for me in the crossfire. And every time I went in, every time they tried to send me out, the war was always just
“For—bed?” Harry asks, eyes flitting nervously upwards at the ceiling and, presumably, the bed above them.
Merlin, but Potter was bloody exhausting. That wasn’t it at all. Draco hadn’t had a clue when he’d stumbled into a Muggle museum the first time. Hadn’t known anything about art except that it meant cantankerous old relatives with terrible politics who managed to take pleasure in judging every aspect of one’s life even from beyond the grave. Wizarding art was so invested in portraiture, plus the occasional landscape meant to provide the bored portraits with a bit of a holiday, that he’d never considered what art could be.
His robes were slung over the edge of the washbasin, the five scorch marks still visible as Draco sank neck-deep into the water. If he’d had any doubts about his theory, they were gone now. Lingering questions about the particulars of Potter’s feelings about him were much more persistent. Draco had been in a fight or two in his time—it was impossible to be a Death Eater, ex or current, without accruing some experience in that department—and he knew what fighting looked like. That heavy breathing, those dilated pupils. Potter had had that at first, but by the time he pulled Draco in it looked just different enough for Draco to wonder. Suspect, even. Potter’s lips had been flushed red, his hips very close to Draco’s own. That wasn’t a fighting stance.
Greg coughed, startling them both. “Well, expect it’s time to leave you to it. Harry,” he nodded. “See you tomorrow?”
His musing results in a barely repressed grin when he reaches the tables section. Potter was quite adept at furniture dodging. No wonder he won the war, really.
“They’ve been to two WWN publicity events together, have been photographed shopping in Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, and Soho, and he’s taken Donaghan to L’Arrondisement twice.”
He strokes himself tentatively, distractedly. His eyes are on my hips, focused on my pelvis with a mix of fear and anticipation.
“Parseltongue, Draco? Really? A Parselmouth terrorises your home for a year and you come away with a new fetish.” Snape rolled his eyes and sighed. “Only a Malfoy.”
Harry grinned sheepishly at McGonagall and shook the water from his hair, missing Draco’s scowl when some of it landed on his jumper. “Sorry, Professor. You know Hermione’s always been the Charms wiz.”
He looks down. It’s true. There are fine, red stitches spelling out “Potter” under a faded Madame Malkin’s label. Harry feels a lump rising in his throat. No one’s ever sewn his name into a jumper, which means…
Harry stops at the landing and gestures towards a familiar door. Draco’s heart is in his throat as he steps forward to open it.
A bouquet shot from his wand, already tied. It was a medley of red tiger lilies and birds of paradise and red roses, surrounded by laurels that looked to be made from gold filigree. It was a mad combination that almost hit Draco in the chest as it sprung forth, but fell short to land across his legs.
“You’re the head of Fashion and Lifestyle. In that capacity, how much would you say you know about the interpersonal relationships of wizarding celebrities?”
My tongue slides up another inch, and then another, and I can feel the coarseness of his thickening hair, then, at last, the smooth ring of muscle.
Malfoy pulled back, twisted them together, until Harry was pressed between the wall and the warm weight of Malfoy’s body. Held between the two, there was nothing to do but focus.
When it came zooming past the hedgerow and into his hand, he heard Potter turn towards him. His t-shirt hung unevenly and he held his jacket in his hands.
“Master? Taking me to the dungeons?” His voice faded a bit as he lagged behind Draco in the hallway. “Not really my scene.”
He was rambling on, about how it was plain and he knew it wasn’t much to look at yet, but it was clean and he promised the sheets were good, not that I had to, not that…he out-flustered himself. Just sort of ran out of things to say and stood there, scuffing the toe of his trainer against the bare wood floors, his hands tucked in his pockets.
I break eye contact first. Drop to my knees in front of him, hands on his thighs, and nudge his legs apart. He tenses under my palms. I run my hands over the muscle, stopping on his waistband.
“Mmm.” Harry brings his hands forward, kneeling on all fours with his mouth perilously, wonderfully close to the tip of Draco’s erection. “What else?”
“Very well, then.” Draco walks to grab the cloak. “Take the evening to consider your position, then, and I’ll see you at the Ministry.” He looks down at his hand, seems to reconsider, and drops the prototype back on the chair. “And bring that with you.”
“A few magical diagnostics, if you don’t mind. For obvious reasons, we can’t conduct them in the void.”
The absurdity of that statement. As though everything in both of our lives hadn’t been designed for seriousness, as though we hadn’t just barely survived a war meant to destroy us both. As though we hadn’t both held death in our hands on numerous occasions.
This made sense. He could do this. This made sense, and he didn’t have to think. His body moved and his mind was blank, and he didn’t have to think about Malfoy.
He reached for the bottle of shampoo, opened it, and put it back. If he used it, he’d smell like Malfoy and that was…too close, somehow. But they’d just been so close. Or had they? Had they been close, or bodies pressed closely together?
Draco was up with the sunrise. He’d managed a few sound hours of sleep, thanks entirely to Harry’s warm weight on top of him, and then next to him. Once he’d stirred, though, he wasn’t able to go back.
Draco, standing stiffly on the opposite side of the room, seems to be encountering the same problem.
He can’t resist a grin, though he makes sure to direct it towards Phillips. “More advanced manoeuvres?”
Harry was distracted by the slow burning push of Malfoy’s tip breaching his hole and struggled to focus on the snake’s response.
Harry complies and fear begins to war with lust. He’s so open like this. Draco can see everything. He could be looking right now.
Grinning, Harry nodded and shoved himself back onto Draco, rocking back to encourage a rhythm. “No chance.”
He nodded and reached for me again. This time I beat him to it. I pressed him back into the mattress and kissed him with everything I had. Any hesitation was gone. He reached for my hips and pulled himself against me, pressing his hips against mine, showing me that he was half hard already. He slipped a hand between us to unbutton my pyjama top and pushed me back to remove it.
Something in his chest loosened. He was relieved, tremendously so. He didn’t want to marry her any more than she wanted to marry him, if for very different reasons, but after all they’d been through, he’d be twice damned if he did anything other than support her. Which, if the way he felt her shoulders relax in his arms was any indication, he might have managed.
As he brushes past, Draco can hear Potter’s intake of breath. There’s a pause before Potter’s footsteps fall in line behind his own.
The guilt in Harry’s chest sank to his stomach like a stone. It hadn’t occurred to him. It should’ve, and it hadn’t.
Draco’s stomach tightens further. His voice follows. He doesn’t know what Harry’s so eager to hide from him, but none of the options are good. “No need.”
Potter blinked at him. “Whatever, Malfoy. Is this thing going to eat me or something?” He perched gingerly on the edge of the sofa, seeming to test it out.
Harry couldn’t hear any more of Malfoy’s voice, after that. He pictured Malfoy’s face travelling through shock and anger and resentment and cold fury.
When he did, a strip of light caught his eye. The plain white door at the top of the staircase was ajar.
Harry nodded, took his hand, and moved to the empty half of the settee. He smiled gratefully. “Thanks. That was intense.”
“That sounds interesting.” Potter, having stripped the lavender of its flowers, dropped the stem at the base of a hedgerow. “Is it only magical animals?”
Draco found he could relate. “Well.” He took a step back and used his wand to clear the pieces to one side of the path.
“The things I’m talking about with Mind Healer Barrett. I—There are some parts of my life that hadn’t been working very well. Things that have always—That I’ve always wanted to be a big part of my life. Finding someone to be with. That sort of thing.”
Draco can feel the pounding in his chest race towards his brain. He thinks his eyes slip out of focus for a moment. He suspects he couldn’t forget those words even if he ever wanted to.
Starting at the knee, Draco ran his hands over Harry’s inner thighs, digging his thumbs in, massaging as he moved further and further up his leg. “Still?” He asked, fingers close enough that if he reached out he could brush Harry’s bollocks.
“Okay. But I’m sure you have other things you could be doing, and I doubt it was very interesting to sit here.”
He’s surprised to learn that Harry has spent at least part of the last decade learning the Veelan waltz. He’s a competent dancer. A fun one, even, who knows when to add his own flourishes.
Wardwell hummed her agreement. Potter gave another brusquely professional nod, and Draco noticed that the tilt of Potter’s head seemed to include him in the gesture.
Then he pushes back against my face, grinds into me with a desperate whine, and I’m coming, coming, spilling all over my hand, all over my trousers, moaning into him, and the vibrations only seem to urge him on.
It wasn’t all that Malfoy had done. When he’d reached out his arms and stretched, he’d been startled by the absence of a small, bitter, angry knot behind his ribs. He’d never noticed that it was there, though its absence made it obvious in retrospect. It had burrowed into his chest, the reflexive defensiveness of a life spent fighting things off. He’d always had to. He’d always been right to. But being wrong about Malfoy…that was something new.
Robards launched into what Draco hoped would be a lengthy explanation. The fact of the matter, though, he quickly realised, was that there wasn’t any real choice at all. If he declined, they’d assume he was motivated by a selfish interest in putting his safety above everyone else’s. They’d recruited him because he was dark, the bad sort of wizard this killer would go after. A no would only confirm it.
“Because in the course of daily life we all use magic while we’re feeling frustrated or angry. This is a chance—an intentionally controlled, safe chance—to see how those emotions affect the results of your casting.”
“I shall be managing routine rubbish disposal. I will return at the end of the day to check your work. These four sets of shelves hold the items that are likely to be a part of your lot. When in doubt, I recommend checking for monograms and examining the seams for notes to do with origins or inscriptions.”
“Exactly!” Granger interrupted, pushing up out of her seat. “She knows why and she knows what’s at stake and she came here with us!”
“And I can’t, if I don’t know that you know that it can’t be… I’m leaving the day after tomorrow. It can’t be more than that, and if you want more than that, if you need more time than that to figure this out with someone else. I don’t—I couldn’t, or I wouldn’t want to live with it, with knowing you felt like I left you.”
Harry hummed around him, and it tipped him over the precipice. His thighs tensed. Pleasure swelled and then exploded through him until he was crying out, calling Harry’s name and gasping for breath. Harry kept moving, warm and wet around him, until Draco pulled away.
“Wasn’t the question.” I lick again, slowly, from his bollocks to the fine hairs at the base of his spine. “Is it bad?“
If there was any part of these evenings that could convince a serial killer that the two of them were really together, Harry was certain it was this.
He blamed Malfoy, obviously. Malfoy's taunting was the sort of thing that would drive anyone to madness, and no one, including Harry, could reasonably be held responsible for resorting to technically extralegal measures where Malfoy was concerned.
It was just behind him, to his right. A loaf of bread—or what had been a loaf of bread—was smouldering, turned into a lump of embers. It wasn’t threatening to go up—there was nothing left of it to catch on fire—but it had left a long scorch mark on the marble.
“The Elder Wand isn’t like any other.” She leaned forward, hands gripping the edge of the table. “What were we supposed to do, track Death down and ask him to make an extra bit?”
Granger furrowed her brow and tilted her head, as if trying to physically turn over the question enough to make it comprehensible. It didn’t seem to work. She opened her mouth, closed it again, and her frown deepened.
He fell back onto the bed a moment later. Draco knew it couldn’t have been more than a few seconds, but it felt so much longer. Felt long enough to be sure that he’d remember it forever, Harry’s mouth slack with pleasure as he spilled over Draco’s fingers. That he’d remember this, Harry’s skin against the duvet, the line of his eyelashes against his cheeks, the soft rise and fall of his chest, and the way his hands searched for Draco automatically. The way Harry curled into him, his head against Draco’s shoulder.
Granger paused, sharing a quick glance with Millie and then turning back to Draco. “It is elder wood and Thestral hair, yes.”
Draco turned, arms folded across his ribs. “I won’t work with anyone who doesn’t trust my judgement, including my ability to evaluate what parts of a case require discretion. If Ms Granger is suggesting that I would reveal information about a high-profile patient—about
“Right!” Ron’s enthusiasm returned. “Exactly. But a wizard wouldn’t have the foggiest. I tried it once, wasn’t pretty.”
He sighed and looked at the stack of books, and his vision swam just a bit which, he supposed, proved her point. “Okay,” he said. “Okay.”
“Like, I can – things that are none of your business, okay? Just, give me the box and I’ll work it out.”
Draco watched him through his 29th and 30th laps, before calling him to a stop. He took Potter’s pulse, had him take his top off so Draco could listen to his heart. All normal.
Potter rose as one of Draco’s heavy wooden double doors swung open and, after a tight smile and nod, he followed Draco’s secretary down the hall.
Which was useful; the distance was just enough to remember myself. I told him not to start anything he wouldn’t finish, managed to look hurt, I think.
“Is it just through there?” Potter smiled kindly, and a bit apologetically. “I’m afraid I did a bit of exploring when I first arrived.”
The Malfoy in front of Harry bore very little resemblance to any of the ones he’d just seen. He stood ramrod straight, his suit was crisp, his gait was sharp, and when he turned his head towards Harry his features were all edges and no shadow.
“And you’ve told us about them in great detail. One might say you’ve made a bit of an art out of nicknames alone, and I was almost concerned that Blaise was going to laugh himself into an early grave at your description of Galvin Gudgeon’s orgasmic exclamations.”
And it wasn’t just the robes. He’d never packed his own things beyond laying them out for elves; he wasn’t even sure why he felt the need to do it himself now. He certainly wasn’t being effective. And Pansy’s colour commentary, amusing as it was, was doing much more for his sense of déjà vu than the state of his clothes.
“It will live,” Malfoy said. And then levitated it again and moved it, and himself, to the recovery room.
Malfoy’s face told a million stories at once. Neither of them said any of them aloud, but Harry thought they might be thinking of the same ones.
Draco glanced sidelong at the stain on the window. He couldn’t be arsed to detect whatever it was that lay beneath the strain in Potter’s tone. Stubbornness, probably. Or some ugly accusation, or a request for proof that Draco would follow through. He didn’t care what Potter wanted from him. Not when this was just another negotiation, and its terms already set. He held out his arm and raised his glass in a toast. “Just like that.”
The lightness in Draco’s step didn’t last. Even with his meeting, he arrived at the Manor before Harry did. He asked Galder to let him know when Harry arrived, and Draco was relieved when he did, but he came with Granger and his Auror guard in tow and Draco was disinclined to interrupt.
“The implants don’t need to, and usually don’t, come from the original wandmaker. You must have known that.”
“Over with?” Harry’s face fell. He struggled to right it. “I—If you don’t want to be here, you can leave.”
Still, he feels the eyes on them, hears the whispers, particularly from the older witches and wizards gathered around the perimeter of the floor. He feels the rearing of the ugly voice inside of him, urging him to run, to step away before the cameras capture them, before his parents find out, before it’s committed to newsprint, made part of the historical record.
They were both silent, moving towards the void by force of habit, until they reached the steps to the gardens. Then Harry spoke out of nowhere. “It’s the 9th.”
He’d always liked the blue rooms, though. Had thought them adult, stately without being as stuffy as some of the others. And now, more like his own flat; blues, whites, oak and mahogany. Nothing that looked as though it ever could’ve belonged in the Slytherin common room.
He procrastinated with the sort of Potter-esque obstinacy he hadn’t exercised since Hogwarts. There was a nap, a bath. He sorted through his robes to see what needed to be pressed, even though it would all probably need to be re-pressed after it was unpacked, and Fallie would be just as attentive to every hem and seam as Galder was. He took dinner in his room, asking Galder to relay his regrets and plead exhaustion on his behalf to whoever was in the dining room.
Malfoy crossed his arms. “Well, what? You’re the one with a Parselprostate. What is it going to take?”
But that was nothing to worry about in the moment. In the moment, Potter was biting his way down Draco’s chest, his teeth pressing into and releasing Draco’s flesh, and it felt incredible, felt like Potter had a straight line to his heart, to his stomach, to his aching, dripping cock. When Potter’s teeth sank into the skin above his hipbone, it was all he could do not to scream for the sharpness of it, for how close it was to Potter’s mouth on him. For all it brought into clarity: that Potter liked this. Liked it messy and unrestrained, liked it about give and take, liked a bit of playing with power.
Harry groans, falls back on the bed, and stairs at the ceiling until he falls asleep. When he wakes the sun is already higher than it should be, and at that point, really, what’s the point of going in?
The results of Potter’s physical were the picture of normality. Average blood pressure and heart rate, no fluid on the abdomen, no disparity between the strength or reflexes on his left and right sides, nothing unusual in the tongue, throat, ears, or eyes. No reports of soreness or tenderness. Well-developed musculature to support the spine, and excellent posture. No scarring at the surgical site; as Granger’s description had suggested, they’d concealed any sign of the Wand or its insertion. There was scarring on the sternum and a few other points on the arms and legs and, of course, on his forehead, but all had healed well and were consistent with his reported medical history. Potter was (though Draco found himself grudgingly loathe to put it in as many words) above average in every indicator of physical health.
Draco isn’t having it, but he’s not having a scene, either. When Potter pulls at him again, he uses it to propel them past the foot of the staircase and into an unused cloakroom tucked underneath it. “What in Merlin’s name are you doing, Potter?”
Draco couldn’t blame him. It was a transparent excuse; his purpose for being in England was to work on Harry’s case, and he’d never had a conflict before, nor was there any reason he should have one now. He was grateful that Harry didn’t push it, but felt like he’d stepped in the proverbial dragon dung regardless. At least he didn’t want Harry to think he was wrong to ask. “I’m sorry I don’t have an answer for you straight away. I’m glad you’ve asked though.”
Potter surveyed his suit, seeming to linger over the top button of his waistcoat before his eyes snapped to Draco’s face. “Are you ready?”
the spines as he checks the titles. The way he balances his wand in his hand, the precise command he has over every flick.
“It’s either that,” Potter said, moving his hands to Draco’s flies, “or cast a cleaning charm so powerful you’ll be tasting mint for a week.”
Potter, on the other hand, shuffled backwards towards the door. “Perhaps I should return to the library?”
“And when that’s not possible?” Draco asked, resisting the tide of anger that swelled in his chest. “Do you give up? Offer them a quick AK?”
Draco’s head shoots up. Potter’s standing in front of him looking nervous and charming and beautiful. He’s carrying an enormous, faded tapestry under one arm, which means…
“It’s part of it.” Potter lets out a ragged sigh, and launches into an explanation much like the one he’d given Draco. His attempts at jobs, his isolation, his frustration with the way he’s treated by the public. The portrait, whoever it is, listens silently, and Draco thinks Potter is winding to a close when he adds something new. “And I think I’ve met someone I like, someone who understands all that, and there’s nothing I can do about it. About any of it.”
Harry stopped him before he could. “It’s not you. That’s only about them. That they believed it so easily and wanted it so badly.” He sat back. “But they did. So I could only figure out one way out.”
Lunch lasted, and lasted, and Draco had work left to do afterwards. But even after several hours of reviewing patient files and a long, unusually roundabout walk home, Draco’s head was still spinning.
I’ve heard worse. I’ve said worse. I’ve certainly done worse. And I’ve no doubt that I’ll come out victorious.
Where do you go to be sick when even the walk to the bathroom is haunted? When you hope to see his face around every corner, but are terrified of turning each one lest you find him there?
Draco decided his resolution to the contrary was officially a lost cause: he liked Granger. Or at least had an increasingly ungrudging appreciation for her candour. Putting it that way was a bit more palatable .
“Fuck,” Harry managed, drawing a sudden exhale and opening his eyes. “Fuck,” he said again, this time more vehemently. “That was…”
The riot of sensations that followed escapes even my best attempts at recollection. I remember the rough drag of glass against the floor, his nipples just out of tongue’s reach as he stretched for another jar, and another. I remember the strength of his hand around my wrists and bucking under him, my sides spasming and back arching as he dragged the fine bristles of his brush over my ribcage. I still bear the marks he left: twin stripes of black down my sides; red streaks on my shoulders matched by raised pink welts where his fingernails bit through my skin; half a cobalt handprint on the inside of my thigh and a full one where he’d grabbed my arse.
“I don’t think that’s it. Really, I don’t,” he insisted when Blaise joined in on the shared looks. “It’s more fundamental than that. I’ve been upset about other patients facing magical deprivation, and I imagine I will be again. It’s more than one person.”
“Are you?” A wave of concern crashed into my chest. There was no doubt that his enjoyment was genuine, but his actions have never been predictable.
“We’ve done a thorough survey of the Aurors, and there’s no one else who offers such an apparent and, to be entirely candid with you, Malfoy, well-known and historically important set of contrasts as the two of you. We don’t think the killer would be able to resist.”
They are pressed together, hip to hip, driven forward by the delicious friction of their cocks together, but it’s not enough, not nearly.
?” Strategy is barely hanging on. “It’s gross.” I take a step back. “You’ve no problem sticking your prick up other men’s arses, but it’s gross when yours is on the line?”
Seeing him out on his broom like that, it’s hard not to wonder if he fucks as seamlessly as he flies, if he grips his cock – or the mythical Trevor-the-boyfriend’s – with as much passion and finesse as he holds his broom. And, next to him, Pansy’s constant machinations are irritating and a bit stale.
“What about what I told you before? If I have all this power, other people will want to use it for something. Even if I just get back to where I was. Not getting better might be the only way to avoid that.”
“Okay. Okay, good." Harry exhales. “But after…whatever. I thought he wouldn’t push me away. And he did at first but then, um, things happened again, and he didn’t. But then when I’ve tried to ask him to do things – other kinds of things, I mean – he just ignores it and doesn’t answer, and he’s really eager to get me out of here.”
An air horn blared all of a sudden. Draco jumped. Lee leaned in to his microphone, his eyes still pinned to Draco. "We've been caught!! Harry Potter, it's Call or Delete day!"
With an impish grin, his...person-of-significance-with-formal-labels-to-be-assigned-at-a-later-date leans forward onto the counter. "Hey."
"It can't be anything to do with the files; they were immaculate. And I'll be rather surprised it's anything to do with the case, now I've reminded you about Scotland Yard. We don't have friends in common about whom you might feign concern, nor do we have any sort of ongoing social relationship, and you do your banking with Gringotts. Do correct me if I'm wrong, but that leaves two options." Malfoy leaned forward on the desk and looked Harry in the eye. "Either you're looking to diversify your portfolio which, while wise, is the sort of thing that usually calls for meeting while the bank is actually open. Or you're here for, well, I would've gone with something less crude than "arse," but that was your word, not mine."
The weight of Draco’s attention grew uncomfortable. Harry turned to retrieve his clothes. “Guess that’s it, then.”
“Do sit down, would you both? This—” he waved at them “—is a bit too much like getting a dressing down at school. Next you’ll start deducting house points.”
Harry is relieved that Draco follows him, and even more relieved when he catches Draco eyeing the room approvingly. Draco picks the bottle, a 1943 Ogden’s French Oak-Aged Single Malt. It doesn’t mean much to Harry, but then, he’d be happy with a cider, and the liquor isn’t really the point.
Draco does not nod, even though yes, he knows. More than knows. He holds his breath instead, hating the way his chest hitches.
Harry worked his mouth open and shut helplessly and Draco, otherwise unmoving, reached a hand up to cover it.
Potter laughs once, short and sharp, and Draco feels it resonate through him. “I know you well enough to know that you’re not satisfied with that.”
“As far as I’m aware, the last time you left a bank it was by Dragon.” He pushed a button on his phone. “Kate will walk you out.”
Draco takes a deep breath and counts backwards from five before snapping his eyes open and staring at Potter with all the bile he can muster. “Are you, by any chance, the proud owner of nine decapitated, stuffed, and mounted house elf heads?”
Because only two of the Howlers have come from Lucius, and none from Narcissa, and the threats to have Draco sectioned at St. Mungo’s have no real weight, Draco is assured by legal.
“Art, though?” Potter sounded…entranced, maybe? Or confused? His face was cast in shadow. Draco wished it wasn’t.
“Fuck, mmm, Malfoy.” His eyes are closed, his voice is low, his neck arched. I reach for the other nipple. He presses into the touch, gasps out, “Still not gonna fuck me.”
Potter is slow to follow which, Draco reminds himself, is not a bad sign. Draco is running a hand over a length of rough grey silk by the time Potter’s footsteps round the corner.
“No.” Potter made for the outdoors. “What do you want? Spell casting? Flying? What is it?” He threw his whole weight into shoving the door open.
“Stop that.” Potter looks up and Merlin, his eyes are even greener when they’re watering. “There’s no need to take it out on the woodwork.”
But they couldn’t talk about this. Not here, when the killer might be anywhere, might be able to hear them, and then this would all be for naught. Except from the look of it, he’d been right; Malfoy had a spark to his eye that hadn’t been there before, and it promised fascination at the very least.
“I–” Potter’s eyes flicked to the top of Draco’s waistcoat and down to the rug. His chest rose and fell shallowly. “Yes.”
Harry’s skin is velvet soft and warm and solid. The vein that runs the length of him pulses against Draco’s knuckle.
Draco saw curiosity on Potter’s face, and hope, probably reflecting his own. It was overwhelming, he was almost overwhelmed. But hoping and trying were all he’d had for so long that he’d become an expert. If Potter was hopeful, if Potter wanted to try…
“No.” Draco jumped in almost before Ron had finished. “Nothing to do with blood at all.” He tore his eyes from Harry and looked to Hermione. “I’m sure I’d be terrible at flossing.”
“Yeah,” Harry said. He was breathing easier now than he had been at any point in the conversation. “Yeah, I am.” He waited.
“I can.” Draco hesitated, and not because he couldn’t. “Whether I will depends on the rest of our negotiation.”
Draco turned, leading them down a dozen slate steps that led from the raised gardens into the field beyond.
Potter shakes his head. “I didn’t even know where you were. All I ever heard was that it wasn’t Azkaban, something about community service, but no one told me anything for sure.”
Potter gagged around him and it felt so fucking good Draco almost stopped. Until Potter, perhaps mistaking the pause for displeasure, took him down again. Draco’s hips snapped forward, Potter coughed, and still he didn’t stop, pull away, any of it. His eyes were closed, his cheeks flushed, and he was starting to answer Draco’s thrusts with tiny moans that vibrated through him.
“I can send a letter, Malfoy. It’s just you’re a bit prickly, aren’t you? Thought the personal touch might do the trick.”
Millie threw up her hands and reclined. “Not everyone shared a house with a Flint. They’ve come out looking squeaky clean, and it’s a clever way to go about it. Your father couldn’t have thought of better.”
Potter took a deep, steadying breath. “You might not like that I am actually capable of doing something to help you, but that doesn’t change the facts. I could do it.”
He was still softening in Harry’s hole when Harry spilled over his hand, the overflow pooling on Draco’s stomach as Harry collapsed onto him.
There was a long moment’s silence. Draco lowered his hand and took a long sip. It had got warm. Waste of good gin, that was. Then he heard Potter’s boots shuffle across the carpet, heard the leather of his jacket against the leather of the sofa as he retrieved it, heard the quiet “
Unfamiliar because it was, in fact, Draco Malfoy’s armrest. Draco lifted his head off of Harry’s chest, blinking the sleep out of his eyes and, as soon as they were open, groaned again, lifting a hand from Harry’s bare thigh to cover his face.
Draco looked at the settee and knew that if he collapsed into it he wouldn’t get back up till morning.
“Not quite the same, but let’s try it. I’ll have Lobsey bring them to you with dinner. See that you read them this evening.”
The problem was, his brain reminded him, that Harry was still, well… still Harry Potter. The letters Draco would get if he deleted the Golden Boy on air would be scathing. Howlers, probably. And Floo calls and phone calls and angry rants in the street. He couldn't go back to that, nor could he risk the ratings drop. It was a matter of simple self-preservation.
“Once filed, the Office of Boring Paperwork will reply by owl to confirm your request within seventeen business days.”
“Yes, Master, of course, Master, as Master wishes.” Galder bowed, and Draco thanked his lucky stars for a perceptive elf. “Master’s guest will follow Galder, yes he will.” Galder tugged at Sydney’s jeans and started out of the room.
Potter’s hands were firm on Draco’s arms, holding him in place while Potter licked into Draco’s mouth, and when Draco’s knees went weak, he let them, and sank to the floor with his face in front of Potter’s trousers. Circe, but Potter was hard, so hard Draco could see the outline of it through his flies, and he wanted to press his mouth to it, wanted to taste Potter, to take him apart.
I swallow my outrage at that “all right.” If he’ll only say my arse is all right…well, it’s a good thing I’m a man on a mission. “You’re telling me you don’t want to be fucked because you lack proper hygiene?”
Draco knew the Rue Guynemer loomed ahead, even if they couldn’t yet see it for the trees. Gravel crunched underfoot, two sets of steps, side by side, and Draco realised he hadn’t noticed it earlier. It didn’t sound out of place to him at all, unaccustomed as he was to making this walk with company.
Draco wasn’t sure he would like the answer to his question, but he was sure he needed to ask. “Were you given the option of a conventional implant?”
“And you’re so bloody myopic it’s a wonder you can find your own backside! It’s not always going to be the kind of battle where you get to draw a big sword and save the day! If the only kind of evil you’re willing to acknowledge involves villainous monologues and drawn wands, the wizarding world will be no better off in ten years than it was a decade ago!”
Unfortunately, his own mind isn’t so neatly locked away. The longer he goes without thinking about any of it, the more persistently thoughts of Potter reassert themselves. He can’t shake the cruelly fresh memory of Potter’s enraptured face looking up at him, or his sleepy contentment as he’d rested on Draco’s knees. Can’t forget the heat of his fingertips.
She cocked her head and looked at him curiously. “About five years ago, I’d say, give or take a year.”
“I gave testimony on Malfoy’s behalf following the Second Voldemort War.” Some of the members of the Wizengamot still cringed at the name. “And,” he added, “we have had some social, interpersonal interactions on several occasions.”
“I have no intention of reassigning you. You’re perfectly welcome to keep on with Pansy.” He stepped back as she tried to rush forward and wrap herself around his legs. Keeping enough distance to look her sternly in the eye, he asked, “Why does Pansy think otherwise?”
“It’s not—” He tried to make sense of what Malfoy had said. He’d heard so many speeches of self-declared redemption during the trials that it had all dulled to a low buzz. He didn’t need to hear it any more to know that it was rubbish. “You’re not exactly the first Death Eater to declare yourself a new man.”
My journal is enclosed. I’d long considered this sordid collection of my machinations to be something of a trophy; all the things I’ve done since the start of the term are contained in its pages. Please, if you ever cared for me - if what we've had means as much to you as it has to me - please read it. I owe you so much more than this, but hope, at least, that there might be no more lies between us. At least I might try to show you why I've hurt you, and how deeply I regret it.
Draco looked up and saw Harry, and stopped laughing as soon as their eyes met. He dropped his wand to his side and stared. The potato fell against the wood with a heavy smack. Harry could relate.
Harry set his arms on Draco’s shoulders in a loose embrace. “Telling you. That I want you.” He swallowed. “Tell me, now?”
You didn’t even need to do that. Yeah, people told me to look out for you, but people have always been doing that. Did you really think I would just do whatever someone told me too? Of all the things, that makes me think you knew me the least. Cause by the time you did all that – it wasn’t even that you thought flashing me in the showers was all it was gonna take, though that was pretty dumb when I’d already told the whole world that I care more about how people are treated than about superficial stuff. But then you said that stuff about extended hands and you were right. I felt bad because you were right. I hadn’t been doing what I told other people to do. You threw me off a little bit there and it took me a little while to get straightened out about it. But I liked that you called me out. It was good for me. It made me better, and I think sometimes that’s kind of what you’ve done best, even if you drive me absolutely fucking mad in the process. But I wouldn’t just shut you out forever over it. Maybe you don’t know that, but I wouldn’t have. What you had Neville say didn’t even make that much difference. And you were just going to torture him for years over it anyway?
“This leaves us with a practical problem. It’s not uncommon for patients to experience an attraction like this. That, in and of itself, need not be an issue. But it does seem to unsettle you, to incite the same outbursts we’re trying to control. In which case—that is, when resolving repressed emotions is central to your recovery, and when this is causing distress or getting in the way of healing—it’s not ethical for me to continue treating you.
I’ve prepared the bedroom in advance. My bedroom, rather than the guest room. I want to remember Potter’s arse laid open for me every time I lay my head down. He doesn’t need to know that, nor see the trinkets that would’ve given it away, now safely stashed in trunks and wardrobes. All he needs to see is the four poster and, perhaps, the chest at its foot.
“And Pansy,” Blaise retorted, “has no appreciation for the avant-garde. We’d have to resign ourselves to spending long evenings on the overstuffed chintz dustrags she tries to pass off as antiques, bickering about the comparative propriety of various alcohols while you rot in a cell in Azkaban.”
“I hope you know,” Luna went on, “that there isn’t anything wrong with crying. It can be a bit hard, sometimes. But there’s a difference between things that are hard and things that are bad.”
He stepped back and bowed slightly, and the room erupted into applause. Even Robards was forced to clap, albeit feebly, and Draco saw more than a few hands at the neighbouring tables reach for the golden envelopes that sat under their place cards. A string quartet picked up from beside the stage. Harry waved again and made for the stairs.
“Want you to,” he said. “Want to make you come.” He moved a hand towards Harry’s cock and thought better of it only when he saw how quickly Harry moved towards it, how close he really was.
“Oh, of course,” Pansy gushed, with the sort of saccharine over enthusiasm that Draco had long known to take as a warning sign. “No one will give it a second thought if I, the recluse who once tried to hand Harry Potter to the Dark Lord, show up out of nowhere after a decade with enough cash to buy a few castles. And I’m sure they’ll be lining up to have me in the neighbourhood.”
Draco has found himself more at ease than he ever would’ve imagined, but his heart is pounding again by the time they reach the bank of fireplaces.
Shortly after two, he found Harry waiting for him on one of the benches along the garden path, wearing only a jumper, Muggle jeans, and trainers. Draco’s momentary concern dissolved into surprise when he came closer and felt the warmth of a heating charm.
“I had time to think, in Azkaban. That was a lot of what I thought about.” He’d told his father that once, when they’d run into each other in the yard. If his father had had a wand, Draco doubted he would have made it out of the conversation alive. He remembered that every time he remembered them; that the last time he’d seen each of them they’d been gaunt and grey and utterly sure of the same convictions that had got them all there. “When I got out, I thought I should find out for myself.”
“Okay,” Harry said. “That’s fine. I understand. If you have any questions about it—about any of it—and you want to ask them…”
Pansy nodded and, after glancing over at her, Greg followed suit, though neither stood to see him out.
Harry, who is stunning in emerald green robes that do astounding things for his eyes. Harry, who smiles at him and asks if he’d like to come in.
Draco slides his thumb under Harry’s jaw and tilts his chin upwards. Instead of answering, he brushes his lips over Harry’s.
Draco’s hips bucked forward, and then Potter pulled away. Draco whined at the loss before he could think better of it.
There wasn’t. He just wanted an answer, wanted to know what Malfoy was so determined to deny, and he hadn’t found out.
But no. It was a bird, and it hit the pavement outside number 34 Grimmauld Place with a heavy, wet thud.
Draco moves to sit in his own chair, but quickly thinks better of it. It won’t do to have Potter feel like an employee, like Draco’s talking down to him.
His jumper followed, and then Harry stripped off his jeans and pants in one go, almost stumbling over the waistband and hoping Draco hadn’t noticed. He balled it all up and aimed for a far corner, grinning when he made it.
He just wants to walk somewhere without anyone grabbing at him. Wants to take long strides and breathe air that doesn’t smell like 12 Grimmauld Place. He walks towards the Thames – just for somewhere to walk – but there are more and more people the closer he gets and when he bumps into two confused Muggles at once he ducks into an alley, hiding himself behind a skip to stuff his cloak into the Mokeskin pouch he still wears.
Millie stood quietly and went to slip an arm around Granger’s trembling shoulders, squeezing gently. “Granger’s right about the Ministry. Shacklebolt wants to do what’s best for Potter, but he’s under tremendous pressure from his supporters to keep tax rates low, and if the charities can’t get outside funding, the Minister’s office is in a jam. And he needs support from Croaker and Robards, who have their own interests… it’s not as easy as all that.”
She nodded and stood. When she spoke it was, he thought intentionally, unambiguously loud enough for Draco to hear. “In that case, probably enough for one afternoon?”
Draco slams the flowers into the disposal chute. They don’t make nearly so satisfying a noise as the potatoes had done, but better than the mouldy bread. He eyes the newspaper. How many
You see him smile, if you want to call it that. You don’t. His lips pull up, twist, and his face is harsh and starved and known. He goes for his wand, too. Stops. Shakes it off and drops his hand. Sets down the glass, slides it down the bar. Takes a step.
Draco is torn between impatience and the need to hear this, to hear Potter ask him for it, even if it’s only an instant, even if it’s only because the blood’s too far from his head to support any semblance of good judgement.
“Let me get this straight. You were trying to clean out your house. You’ve spent a substantial amount of time doing that. Now, having succeeded at it, you would like to undo it?”
Except that Unspeakable Wardwell was present, side by side with Robards at the end of the long oval table, and they’d hardly try it on a senior Unspeakable.
They all tumbled through his Floo within five minutes and stood clustered around the bird, which Harry had lain atop the dining room table, wrapped in one of old Walburga’s tablecloths. Harry’d spotted a wound below the bird’s crooked wing as he wrapped it, and it was slowly staining the graying lace red – a touch that Harry didn’t think the Black ancestors would mind too terribly.
Another dark flight of stairs, then he pushed against the edge of a gilded frame to reveal a staircase, flooded with light, smooth and bare, free of the dusty carpet that covers the rest of the house. I walked up first, into the attic.
It doesn’t matter, he decides. He doesn’t care. Potter’s thin whimpers are beautiful and Draco could watch him roll his hips against the air for hours. He’s half tempted to, but then he would have no excuse to see more, and he desperately wants to see more.
“Do you really think he’ll open his arse, let alone his heart, to the Dark Lord’s failed lackey?” “Don’t you think he knows the only thing your hands are good for is casting Crucios?” “Why would he ever choose you when he could take his pick?”
Potter seemed to think about the question. Or maybe he was just confused by the existential mystery of the paint blobs. Draco wasn’t sure which would’ve been more shocking. Either way, he was feeling a bit unnerved by Potter’s reaction, which involved about a thousand percent less mocking or antagonism than he’d expected. It might have been the most confusing thing to happen all evening, though it was still better than the alternative.
Draco sets his glass down and looks at Harry expectantly. Heart in his throat, Harry stands and extends a hand.
“You were always going to become an Auror,” Malfoy went on, his head bent against the wind. “Not because you’re especially good at Defense or because you’re especially noble. It’s just the only one way you can imagine doing good. Turn up and fight the grand battle, conquer the basilisk, save the school, capture the bad guys, find the bird, and then you’re on to the next thing. No follow through.”
It was strangely familiar, riding behind him like that. I realise it’s not the first time, though there’s no need to recount those particular circumstances. Suffice it to say, this was destined to be more pleasant, even if not for the strange conversation.
“And I can’t do it myself, and there isn’t anyone else to do it, then it still doesn’t have to be your—your cock, okay?”
Draco scoffed. “Hardly. They’re barn Kneazles, and half-Kneazles at that. They’ll live in the barns. Keep the horses company.”
He clamps down and I want to curse that particular declaration. “You’ll be so ready for it, I’m gonna get you so ready for it.”
Draco’s eyebrows shot up. Had it been anyone else on the line he would’ve tried for thoughtful, but Millie would recognise “dumbfounded” through his best attempts, so he didn’t make any.
From the tension that suddenly shot through Malfoy’s legs, Harry thought his knees might've started to buckle. "Opponents?"
With both hands, Harry grabs the forms and pulls. Malfoy is just startled enough to loosen his grip momentarily. Harry stumbles back, victorious.
“Scotland Yard requisitions things like this all the time. Could’ve got a look at their safety deposit boxes that way too. You can’t seriously tell me that the Ministry doesn’t still have a relationship with them.”
“I will only point out that it would be extraordinarily easy for the elves to sneak a Puking Pastille into someone’s dessert.” He thought of Robards again.
With a grin, Harry leans in to whisper several other things they might try in the service of working off their lunch.
“I don’t, but the elves do. And I believe in high thread counts, even when it comes to tea towels. They adore me for it.”
Malfoy took a shuddering breath. He closed his eyes for a long moments, and when he opened again he stared right into Harry’s. “Tomorrow. 8am.” He turned on the spot and disappeared.
“So, two things,” Harry said, suddenly more nervous than he had been just a minute before. “This charity… It’s going to have a research division. Figuring out how to treat people whose magic is out of control in some way. Figuring out what they need, why they’re using magic violently, whether consciously or not. A lot of that will be led by Mind Healers, but there’ll be some cases that are about magic in the body. There have already been some in the news, about people who can’t explain why they’ve cast certain spells, especially children. And some cases where it seems like magic is reacting to neurochemical or hormonal conditions. We don’t even know exactly what the source is, some of the time. But we need someone to run it who knows about magic and medicine, and who’s willing to think creatively about how those things work together. So, one thing is wondering if you might be interested in running that.”
“A great deal about adjusting to magical exposure after time spent in the void.” It was true, if not the complete picture. But given what was at stake, and Potter’s strange, oft-maddening willingness to say no to Draco when he’d roll over for anyone else, Draco felt… well, any means, he reminded himself.
Draco watched Potter tilt his head back, felt his thumbs dig in against Draco’s hip bones, his fingers braced on Draco’s sides. He felt Potter’s mouth open. Felt the surprisingly fine mess of Potter’s hair under his hands as he dug his own fingers in again and thrust once. Felt Potter’s throat contract around the head of his cock as he pushed deeper still. It was incredible. Tight and hot, and he felt it shooting down his thighs as he pulled back and thrust forward again.
I’m everything she says and more. Stupidly oblivious, easily distracted, weak. And now I’ve lost everything for it.
There’s no response. Is Harry making a face? What kind of a face? What is the portrait doing? Draco wants so badly to look, but there’s no way he’s willing to cut this conversation short or risk discovery.
Harry wondered why he was the only one worried about the bleeding. Luna was almost preternaturally calm, even more so than usual. It was a bit creepy, all things considered. And though he seemed to be the only one really noticing it, the presence of the bird wasn’t doing much for the atmosphere.
Harry couldn’t figure out where to look. Edgar stretched his wings beautifully, and after having seen them drawn in tight and covered in blood, the sight of the wind beneath his feathers moved Harry more deeply than he might have expected. But then there was Malfoy, his profile turned almost out of sight, but not so far that Harry couldn’t see the softness in his eyes or the gentle smile at the corners of his lips. Harry watched, rapt, as Malfoy tilted his head back and shielded his eyes to watch Edgar’s flight, his smile growing as Edgar soared higher and higher. Harry thought of taking a step closer. Wondered how it might feel to stand at Malfoy’s side. Worried that Malfoy might startle.
Draco pulled him closer, resting his forearms on either side of Harry’s neck and moving his hips in time with the music, hoping Harry might feel more at ease following. It worked, to an extent. He wasn’t able to move with the beat, quite, but he did respond to Draco’s body, did let himself relax into Draco. It wasn’t anything flashy or impressive—they wouldn’t be taking home any awards—but it felt good to Draco. Very good, to move together, to see Harry’s limbs loosen, to feel his hands trail up Draco’s sides and to his neck.
Millie laughed. “Four Aurors will arrive at half one. Finnigan and Weasley—Ronald—volunteered for the job, then I think it’ll be Helen Goshawk and Ella Wilkins. Weasley—Percy—is working on a story to explain the guard. Robards is still saying no to anything more, and Shacklebolt says no to a closed court. Potter’s not as useful if the media aren’t aware he’s involved. Of course.” Millie rolled her eyes in sympathy with Draco’s open disdain. “The hearing may last several hours. He’s been asked to write a statement, and there will be questions from the Wizengamot. Shacklebolt would like to make him available to the press afterwards, but we’ll see.” She leaned in conspiratorially. “Between us, Granger’s been on a bit of a tear.” She grinned. “It’s impressive. I wouldn’t bet on Shacklebolt winning that one.”
Potter’s fingers tightened around the apple, his fingers feeling for indentations and his thumbs holding on for dear life.
Galder bowed deeply, which made it that much easier for him to twist his ears half into corkscrews. “Mistress Pansy and Master Greg, sir, they is having troubles in their rooms.”
You feel the heat where his knee was pressed to your chest. You feel the ache in your hands, in your mouth, in your cock. You feel his eyes on you. You jolt at the force of his gaze and this one’s not just in your prick.
You push up and step towards him. The beat just laps at your toes now. One more step towards the curb and you’ll lose it.
Harry moved more deliberately this time, running his tongue through the drops of precome gathering at Draco’s tip, slowly over the underside of Draco’s shaft, hollowing his cheeks around the glans and beginning to bob his head again, moving faster this time, his hand moving with his mouth so all Draco felt was pleasure shooting through him.
“We will also send our best team to document the charity event of your choosing, and are willing to devote several hundred words to coverage of that cause, as a gesture of sincere regret and goodwill. We do hope that—”
He locks eyes with me, and I move, press forward until I feel his pucker against my fist. I let go and slide my cock through my fingers, further into him, and further still. I can feel his body struggling to yield to me, and it makes him so tight around me, so fucking tight, and if I hadn’t already come this would be over far too soon.
He jerks his wrist free and crosses his arms. I feel the space between us acutely. I hope he does too.
In any event, she’s off to the continent and there’s no way she or her mother will see the photos until they’re in wide circulation. Cora Floydam will prove impossible to find should they attempt it. Besides which, the story’s not even wholly untrue; they
Harry, unable to find the right words, crossed the room, cupped Draco’s neck, and pulled him in for a kiss.
Panic begins to rise. Should he have set the dinner table? He’d mentioned a drink and eight seems late for dinner, but maybe purebloods eat late? What if Draco is expecting a full meal? He’s got hors d’oeuvres, Kreacher had been sure about doing that part, but not a proper meal. He could go set the table. Or he could make tea, in case Draco prefers that. Or double check the kitchen, if Draco would rather be somewhere warmer and more casual, as unlikely as that seems. Or, he thinks, he could remake the bed. Which he, then, tries not to think too much about. Changing the linens and flipping the mattress and making it twice already…that was surely enough. If it even becomes relevant, which there’s no reason to think it will. It’s only a drink, and then only if Draco shows up.
Shacklebolt interrupted Croaker’s seething before it could take shape. “Thank you, Dr Malfoy. That is most useful. I hope, though, that you can understand our interest in a speedy resolution, particularly if the magical void is contributing to ill effects. Is there anything you can do to accelerate the process?”
Anyway. How much of it did you mean? I know you can’t answer that. I wish you could, though. Cause I’m pretty sure about the early stuff, that you were faking it. You’ve said it, and we all knew it then. It’s later on that’s messing with my head. Did you keep having sex with her? After we kissed? After we did…did you do it again, with her? I know we didn’t say we weren’t going to, with anyone else, but I didn’t think we needed to.
“Maybe I do!” Draco’s voice rings out, seeming to occupy the entire room. “I’ve spent years making this department work and it’s likely to be the only job I ever have. Do you think I’d do anything to jeopardise that? To risk reassignment because the press says I’m a danger to the boy wonder?”
Harry settled across from him. Or tried to. He couldn’t entirely sit still. Draco wanted to grab his hand just to stop him playing with the silver. Or needed to stop him playing with the silver without grabbing his hand, because he wouldn’t want to let go once he had.
“He is,” she agreed, tucking Finch-Fletchley’s elbow more securely into her side. “But dreadfully handsome and has the Turner Prize. Who could blame her?”
Draco knocks Harry’s leg under the table, and when the increasingly familiar gesture is returned, he starts in on the next big thing that will have all of wizarding London talking.
“Okay.” Draco ignored the pounding in his chest, or the possibility that Harry’s double meaning was not unintentional. “Same as last time?”
Draco felt the warmth of his fingertips through his shirt as Harry pulled at his buttons carelessly, but it didn’t burn. Not when he got the last button open, or when he splayed his hands over Draco’s chest and pushed the shirt off his chest entirely, or when Draco arched into a hand that tweaked his nipple.
“No. It kept behaving more dramatically when it was separated from him, and after shorter periods of time.”
“Christ, Malfoy. What the fuck do you think I’m here to do? There’s not a translation spell buried up there. It takes a little effort.”
Malfoy looked almost exactly how Harry had always imagined a posh arsehole would look: smooth and pale and softer than silk. He’d never worked the beat in Diagon Alley, walking up and down endlessly in the sun, or spent weekends weeding a garden. He’d never handled tools until his fingertips built up callouses. For a moment, it reminded him of everything he’d thought he should hate about Malfoy.
You’re asleep again right now, but Merlin it’s been good to hear your voice. Madame Pomfrey says not to wear you out and I haven’t given this back yet, so I don’t think you’ll mind too much if I write to you a little longer.
There’s a small pile in the centre of the dais. Draco pulls up at its edge, Harry right behind him. It does look like a pile of clothes, and it makes no sense for Harry to want to hide this from him. Unless they’re not Harry’s. Unless they belong to Marcel, who’s undoubtedly got a huge cock, and they probably shower together when they’re all messy after class – Draco knows how Harry tries to pretend he’s not peeking at Draco in the shower and Marcel is probably so used to being covered in raw egg that he, unlike Draco, has forgotten that the whole purpose of showers is getting clean – and he’s left his pants behind and Harry’s trying to get them out of here before Draco notices.
They’re not moving or buzzing or anything like that. Just plain brown boxes, two of them, inert on the worktop. He looks over to Phillips, who has summoned a clipboard from parts unknown and is reading over its contents intently.
It’s been three days since you first properly woke up. You’d stirred some before then and said a few words – some of the best words I’ve ever heard – but it took you longer to shake it all off and really wake up. Draco, it’s been so good to see you again. It’s not everyone who could take the piss from a hospital bed.
Draco stood, gathering the flowers in his arms. “Almost. There’s something I’d like to discuss, actually.”
Something about the way he says it makes Draco wonder if he really did. He quirks an eyebrow at Harry. “Did you?”
Draco is sure he’s not imagining the rustling of silk and taffeta or the heat of a hundred sets of scrutinising eyes when they start down the staircase together. It’s what he’d been trying to avoid in the first place, what his parents had been trying to avoid for him with all their attempts at sensible matchmaking, and he can understand why now. He isn’t sure the good press is worth it, or that it will be good press if he vomits all over the Chosen One.
He was suddenly certain that it would be unwise to look at Harry. He kept his eyes ahead, walking into the conservatory. “I will, yes. The afternoon of the 11th?”
“You Vanished the contents of an entire house, listed three pairs of trainers on your form, and thought that was it?”
“Er, no, thanks. Just had lunch.” He shook his head as if to clear it. “And I’m really just here on business, anyway.”
The bustle of the Wizengamot fell to a low hum. Draco saw Harry waver, but as soon as Weasley moved forward Harry was behind him, as commanding as Draco had ever seen him.
Money and fame. Of course. Harry felt almost as stupid as Malfoy seemed to think he was; of course that’s what would have motivated Malfoy.
He doesn’t miss Draco’s fleeting look of astonishment at the offer. It thrills him. He can feel the heat of Draco’s gaze, but he doesn’t move. He stays there, hands raised, waiting.
on the mother’s body, meant strength and good health, it’s inversion, on the daughter’s meant weakness and sickness. That if
The elf obeyed with no outward sign of dissatisfaction. “Prippa will take Master’s cloak if Master pleases. Master will find tea in the music room.”
Potter’s bollocks are high and tight and Draco has to make a choice. He wants to watch and he wants to taste, but he can’t do both, not enough of both.
Draco’s stomach twisted as it sank. This was why they’d brought him here, then. It wasn’t a mission. It was an interrogation.
“It’s passed through into the Report Stage. They haven’t scheduled the vote yet but, given Flint’s acumen and the level of public support, three weeks?”
With Harry pressed firmly against him, Draco brought his fingers to Harry’s neck, feeling the fine hair there, thick and unexpectedly soft beneath his fingers. He ran his fingers over it and felt Harry arch back into his hand, even as his hips pressed forward.
Draco’s softening cock slipped free when Harry relaxed back against the stone, but Draco stayed where he was, kneeling stiffly above Harry, eyes wide open.
They stood there a moment, Draco still with a mind towards keeping the bread out of sight, and Sydney’s grin began to falter.
He feels it coming, feels his thighs tingle and his bollocks tighten, knows he won’t hang on much longer.
Harry huffed another shaky laugh and nodded. She asked a question. He gestured to the untouched tea tray. She shook her head and said something and they both snickered.
Up, he went, and up and up. Warmth crept into his muscles, into his bones, through every vein that cycled through his beating, bounding heart.
I drive into him again, my bollocks almost too tight now to slap against the soft muscle of his arse.
I know you believe in love and forgiveness. I know, too, that there’s a difference between forgiving someone for who they are and forgiving them for what they’ve done. What I’ve done. I know I’ve no right to ask, but you’ve shown me that living with love is something worth fighting for and I don’t want to live without it ever again. Without you.
He’d started writing Malfoy a letter the day after Luna’s dinner, but he hadn’t been able to figure out what to say. “Were you in love with me?” sounded mental. “I’m sorry if I hurt you” sounded insincere, but taking out the “if” made it presumptuous.
Though there was no longer any question in my mind of not going. Hadn’t been for some time. I sat next to him, close enough to reasonably place my fingers over his. He hooked his over mine and toed off his trainers. I followed suit.
“But at least at first,” Granger pled. “He’s very private. It might be the difference between him agreeing or not.”
As if on cue, the waitstaff descended to clear their plates and deliver the next course. Draco settled himself slowly into his seat, holding Shacklebolt’s eye as the waitstaff worked around them.
He drops the hand and brings it to his jumper. He looks Draco square in the eye before he whispers, “Trade you.”
He gives me a last, sceptical look, and turns, sliding up the bed so that only his toes hang off the edge.
And then he tucks into himself and he’s turning up again, the gold-green grass flashing by in a blur as he corrects himself. He opens his mouth to let out a victory whoop.
Potter shoots him a look. “—since an entire house worth of stuff doesn’t usually Vanish, in my experience. So I don’t really know what was in there.”
Then his hunger returned. He moved so he was kneeling between my legs, pushing into me, twisting his fingers beautifully, intuitively, to hit the exact right spot. Even in the hazy reflected light coming in from the streets I could see his desire, the degree to which he was enthralled at the sight of me, rolling against his hand as I was.
“The Room of Requirement,” Draco affirms. “That was the other half of ‘away.’ For centuries, when witches and wizards Vanished things, that’s where they went. So when a student needed something, whatever it was –”
But then, he’d planned for it. It was only a few days until classes started, and he was meant to make a trip to the Manor in between. Millie sent all British Ministry correspondence to the Manor, and Pansy sent it on to Draco, and the letters from Croaker and Robards had become more insistent. He’d been able to put them off once with a report, sent the week before Christmas and probably shelved in the rush before the holidays, but now they wanted him in person, and he’d agreed. He was to Apparate early morning on the 8th, meet with them that afternoon, and return home that same evening, or the next morning. Depending on whether he felt up to all that Apparition and, he would admit to himself, whether there were other pulls towards a longer stay at the Manor. Classes started the following Monday, but he didn’t really have to be back until Sunday evening, depending on how it all went.
“But for other things as well.” Draco takes a deep breath. “I apologise if you wanted more privacy than our coverage at the
Then he’d come back, all bashful fumbling and odd determination to help even though it really and truly was not necessary. Fine. Draco understood the political importance of accommodating Potter’s odd whims. He’d let him help. Kept him at a distance, given him a concrete task so simple that an adolescent troll could manage it, and left him to it.
“Harry,” he said again. “Remember: if I really didn’t want to, if it was truly too overwhelming or onerous to be worthwhile, I wouldn’t do it. I’ve told you all of this in the interest of explaining why I hesitated when you first asked. Not because I want you to feel indebted, which I don’t. I’ve made the decision freely. You’re welcome, and I’m glad to hear that it’s a relief, but you don’t owe me anything.”
Harry swallowed. His throat was dry and tight, and he didn't think it was just from getting fucked. "That so?"
And then it came, the warmth of lips against his own. A hint of roughness at the corner of Harry’s mouth, fitting for December. The softening of his lips as they moved against Draco’s. The electric pins and needles that travelled down his arms as Harry stepped forward again and pressed their chests together. The feeling of Harry’s waist as Draco hooked an arm around him and pulled him closer still. Maybe Draco shouldn’t have been surprised that Harry was good at this, but inasmuch as he retained any ability to think, he was blown off his bloody feet.
," he spat. "You're so full of shit, Malfoy. I've told you why I've come. If you're just going to give me the runaround and parade your smug attempts at logic all over the place, I'll see myself out."
He looks at me. He’s so fucking earnest. They die on my tongue, one after the other, and all I manage is a nod.
“I am increasingly unsurprised at that,” Draco said, honestly, if with a bit of after-the-fact concern about how Potter would take it. The only thing that seemed to inspire any hint of anger was his reflexive defensiveness of Granger and his team, even though they’d landed him here. “Though—and I’m as surprised as you might be to hear myself say this—in their defense, I’m not certain that they knew.”
In the report I just said that you were fighting with Pansy, but I didn’t say what you were fighting about and they didn’t ask. They probably still will, in front of the Wizengamot, and then it’ll all be out in the open. I don’t know if you’d like that, either.
“You needn’t explain,” Draco said, calling upon all of the pureblood training in imperiousness that he could still muster. At least it was familiar, some sort of a way to move forward without falling apart. “We had an understanding, and neither of us was obligated to the other.”
“I,” Potter pauses. “Not that I can think of. Everything I’ve wanted to do has always involved other people. Helping them, one way or another.”
“Imagination?” Potter sputtered, the sound of his outrage resonating beautifully through the room. “What the bloody hell do you want from an Auror patrol?”
Regardless, Draco was determined to make an effort. He’d worn Muggle clothes, as instructed, and picked a particularly becoming outfit, of the sort one might wear on a first date. He’d been punctual, and greeted Potter with the sort of shy, warm smile he’d often seen an adolescent Pansy practising into her hand mirror when she thought no one was looking. He’d held Potter’s hand a moment longer than was strictly professional, and leaned into it so that their bodies were closer than would befit colleagues out to a business dinner. He’d tried to make conversation; he’d asked about Potter’s weekend plans, and his thoughts on goings-on at the Ministry.
Draco ignores him. “These are also sorted by date of arrival, so we can begin with those closest to us. This is an oak secretary, circa the late nineteenth century. Does it belong to you?”
As an area of mutual interest, Quidditch may be a useful icebreaker, especially because it gets him out of Granger’s grasp. Her presence foils most of the other obvious alternatives – he doesn’t need a tutor in any of his subjects, he isn’t wanting for company or support, and she seems to automatically anticipate the vast majority of his and Weasley’s needs. But I’ve made some inquiries to Blaise about upcoming social engagements, and fully anticipate making headway shortly.
The moment I pushed into him…that’s the face I’ll always remember. There was moment of pain, a choked gasp, all to be expected I suppose. I stilled and let him adjust. And then he had his hands on my back and was pulling me into him, and the look on his face was awe and newness and wonder, and then pleasure when I started to move.
Still, there were only so many affronts to his dignity that might reasonably be included in the job description.
He stood looking at Potter, who had turned to inspect the seam, running his hand over it with no small amount of confusion.
Turning on his heel, Draco strides towards the next section, coming to a stop in front of wardrobes and bureaus.
“If there’s anything you’d like to do, please let me know. Or Lobsey, if you’d prefer, and he can relay the message.”
Malfoy wasn’t entirely wrong. Half of what he’d said had washed over Harry, drowned out by the edgy tension that had been building back up in him since they’d walked out of the mirrored room. The other half…he wasn’t sure what to do with any of it. It was smug and elitist and everything he’d always hated about Malfoy, and the worst part of all was that he didn’t think Malfoy was entirely wrong.
For a few preciously short minutes, Harry gave it to him. He loved seeing Malfoy come undone, loved watching him, hearing him, as he gave in to his own desire and asked, albeit silently, for more. As he pushed back harder when Harry added a finger, and then two, and began to thrust them into Malfoy as his tongue circled the sensitive skin. But Harry's own need was pressing, quite literally, against his jeans, and if his mouth hadn't been occupied he might have begged.
I tried anger. Suggested he was saving his love for the infamous, absent Trevor he’d written about. I meant to make him defensive; he just looked confused and then laughed. He laughs at all the wrong moments.
Harry took a last, intent look before he nodded and let Draco lead him further down the Rue Saint-Jacques.
Trained departmental personnel? Harry thinks. Isn’t it just Draco? “Trained departmental personnel? Isn’t it just you?”
He thought of Potter’s trips to the kitchen, of his almost-destroyed seam. “Beyond what I’ve told you, given the particulars, I’m not sure it’s mine to tell.”
Once seated, Harry swirls his glass. He’s fairly certain that’s the sort of thing one is supposed to do. He almost sloshes some over the edge when he watches Draco take a first taste.
it was perfect — Potter’s calloused palm just rough enough against his shaft, his skin warm, grip hard. He started so slowly at first that Draco might have mistaken his technique for laziness; then Potter added a twist of the wrist that had Draco letting out a moan he couldn’t hold back. Potter did it again, and again, pressing forward with his hips and running his rough fingers over Draco’s shaft until heat gathered in Draco’s thighs and his toes curled against the sheets, and he was coming too. He was coming to Potter’s touch, with the taste of Potter on his tongue, with Potter’s come drying on his thighs, and if it was as intense as any orgasm he could remember having, he was sure he could find a way to ascribe it to something other than Potter. To the circumstance, to the intensity of sex whilst on a mission. If it would be a lie, nobody needed to know.
“After three weeks, it’s possible that I’m looking forward to the Eurostar just to have two hours to spend alone together.”
He is fine. Nothing broken. He might bruise, but that’s nothing new between the two of them. He’ll have to do some sorting to fix the mess, but work really has been slow. He is. He’s fine.
I’ll wait an hour, though. All day if I have to. Until the Ministry comes to get me, or until he does.
, that it isn’t “useless posturing” when one part of the team is able to solve a problem, while the other’s chief objective is lying to the public.”
“Months,” he snorted, and shook his head to forestall her objection. “I know, I know. Not possible. As long as you can. A week, two weeks. Merlin, I would take a few extra days, if that’s all you can get me. But time, Granger. I need more time.
He’d felt it, of course. I play a long game, not an unselfish one. But whether due to adrenaline, Firewhisky, or both, his drunken fumbling had never captured the size of it. How could it? I’m longer than his fist, thicker than the circle of his fingers. Big enough to elicit that unmistakable, bug-eyed, open-mouthed moment of alarm.
In actuality, of course, it’s the Ministry-appointed Mind-Healer’s daughter. Dumb as bricks – shocked she made it into Beauxbatons’ N.E.W.T.’s program – but exactly the kind of oral fixation you’d associate with her mother’s line of work. Given what the practice was charging, their pockets must be as deep as her throat. Which probably explains Beauxbatons, come to think of it.
“Did you think it was nothing, during all that time?” Harry asked, with a hint of despair in his voice.
Draco followed him without a second thought. He ran his hand up Harry’s leg, tracing gently over the line of muscle that hid the Wand from view, over his hip, up his side, still not touching his prick, not yet. He looked up, first, to see Harry biting his lip and watching Draco carefully.
He was clearly a first-timer. It was sloppy work. Inconsistent and too wet and a few scrapes of his teeth had me arching more in fear than pleasure. He squeezed my bollocks too roughly and moved too quickly and applied so much suction at times that I felt like he might’ve mistaken my cock for a sugar quill.
Draco freezes, unsure that he’s heard Potter correctly. Sudden-onset rage can distort one’s hearing. “Pardon?”
Thinking wasn't working as a strategy. Not if it meant he was so unprepared that he gasped like that and his knees buckled like that and he gave himself away so thoroughly.
He’d thought his heart might beat out of his chest the first time he saw a video installation, and then a performance. He was bowled over at learning that Muggles created their canvases and photographs with dyes and chemicals and a careful hand and a discerning eye. How much they had to love it, how much they had to devote themselves to it, to capture their world without the help of magic.
“Look around you, Potter. Nothing burning or iced over or shredding or cracked or exploding or splintering or dropping leaves. Not since you started yelling.”
Draco pretended not to notice Potter’s reaction, even as he found it hard to look away. “Taking or giving. Pansy, really. As much as you might enjoy attempts at shock value, it’s hardly effective when we all already knew that.”
Potter looks rather at a loss for how to respond. Draco does his best to revel in the silence stretching between them. At least he’s got Potter on his back foot.
“Yes.” Harry answered without even a pause. He hesitated after, though. “Do you think, what was there before, what we felt—is it still there?”
“I guess I feel kind of… different? It’s more… do you know the feeling before a storm, when it feels like there’s a lot of energy in the air?”
Draco struggles with the top clasp of his robes. He’s not sure why it won’t close, but he’ll be having a word with Twilfit.
Draco was stung. More deeply than he would’ve liked. “I didn’t realise you had so little faith in my abilities. But since you’ve asked, the French authorities are more reasonable about interactions with Muggles. It’s the British Ministry that’s got a problem with Muggles. Happy to Obliviate them, but never to help.”
Kitchenware is close to the front. The short walk is not incidental. Draco spends the whole time evading Potter’s attempts at conversation with all manner of useless departmental trivia.
There were good reasons, excellent reasons, why they stuck to these things—to the weather, Quidditch, sometimes a particularly benign news item, usually something from the arts section, which Harry would know only a little about and Malfoy would explain at length—and Malfoy was an absolute master of small talk. Harry almost admired it; it was a fair sight better than the old codgers at Ministry dos who were happy to drone endlessly for the pure pleasure of hearing themselves talk. Malfoy seemed to make some genuine effort to be engaging. Charming, even. Which was all well and good, except when it hit him that he knew very little about Malfoy, and that he felt as though he should have known more after a dozen dinners together. Or when Malfoy’s storytelling accompanied content that remained so firmly in the territory of “passably close to interesting” for such extended periods of time that Harry started to feel as though he was back in History of Magic, except that nobody had ever expected him to take Binns’ hand and whisper sweet nothings to him across candlelit hors d’oeuvres. For which he was eternally grateful, but still. If Malfoy could be passably interesting about vintage Lichtensteinian weather conditions, Harry thought he might be downright fascinating on topics he cared about.
Draco cast another Alohomara, practically under his breath, and pulled the gate back so they could slip through.
Harry risks a look at Malfoy. His eyes are lined with black, his lips are plump and glistening. His skin radiates heat.
“Indeed.” Granger pursed her lips. “And yet we have a project—a rather urgent project—that would benefit a great deal from exactly that expertise.”
He ran back through the photos again, then shoved it all into a drawer and turned on the intercom. “Kate?”
I bend over him, bracing an arm on each side of his chest, bringing my mouth to his ear. “You think this is going to be like a Bludger to the bollocks? Potter, I’ll lick your hole so well, you’ll be begging for more.”
They were 21 again and sneaking out of a window at a Ministry fundraiser, the hunted look on Malfoy’s face fading away as Harry held out a hand to help him over the sill.
Draco doesn’t look back. He knows full well that Potter might ruin the place, but what of it? Potter could bring the whole thing crashing down and the Minster would praise him personally for an innovative reorganisation.
The snake began to slither towards Harry, breaking free of the box entirely when its head reached Harry’s shoulder. It coiled around his arm and hovered by his ear. “
Draco tries to conceal his shock. This was not anywhere in the range of reactions he’d anticipated. And he doesn’t want it back. Not at all. It’s a part of the past he’s happy to see gone. He just wants Potter to recognise that he knows what he’s talking about, that he doesn’t need any handouts, that maybe, just maybe, Draco has an expertise worth an iota of respect. “Of course not,” Draco spits. “That would be highly irregular.”
“So, what? Your great penance is to spend time with powerful Muggles as well as powerful wizards? Because they’re powerful?” He hoped he sounded half as incredulous as he felt.
He looks up at the clock and rolls his eyes. It’s only 10:15. It’s only Tuesday. It’s only community service hour 6,410 out of 10,000. Another seventy-five minutes of sorting and cleaning and labeling and storing to do before lunch. And on Tuesdays he has to water all the plants and dispose of whatever’s rotted, and then there’s logging items and addressing requests.
He wasn’t surprised when it was Millie, instead, even if it was the middle of the day. He was much more surprised—and instantly a bit queasy—when she spoke.
Potter snorted and shook his head. “So, what? We walk around, stare at the animals? Petting zoo is your idea of a good outing?”
“He said the same to me. It’s idiocy. There are a million ways to explain it, and what do they think will happen if you do have an episode of unreliable magic? Won’t that be rather noticeable?”
At least he knew what to do when he was this kind of cold, and Potter had unwittingly made it an even easier and more obvious solution than it usually was.
“Is it really that bad?” Harry asked, dropping down beside him. “Snape telling your father, I mean?”
A white light emanated from the tap and it began to twirl until it was spinning so quickly as to be a glowing blur. Porcelain scraped stone as the basin began to sink. It disappeared, leaving behind a wide, metallic opening. The entrance to the Chamber.
And there he was, with his hand reaching for mine, telling me he’d just borrowed the name, there was no Trevor, there wasn’t anyone else. It was just that he needed to know it meant something, that he’d seen what actions came from hate, from apathy, from manipulation on both sides of the war. That he knew I knew what he meant, because he knew I’d seen it too. Knew that I knew how much those things could hurt someone. Knew that there was something more between us – wasn’t there?
When Flint yielded some fifteen minutes later, Marchbanks rose and announced special testimony from Harry, describing him as, “an expert whose duties to the Ministry made him unavailable for open public comment at the time of the second reading,” and called a voice vote to yield the floor. The ayes were overwhelming, though Draco noticed Flint and a few others keep their mouths firmly shut.
He dragged himself into the bedroom and fell, fully clothed, onto the duvet. He buried his face in the pillows and tried to will the world away.
It hooted sharply as he walked past, and he craned his neck. It stared at him so intensely that Harry almost felt the urge to cower. Then he noticed the scroll around its ankle. He stepped closer, and it held its leg out imperiously, hooting again and shaking its feathers when Harry hesitated. His hands shook—with cold, he told himself—and he had to open it slowly so as not to drop it. Inside, there was one word written in scrawling hand:
Still staring down, Harry quirked his mouth into a wry smile. “Didn’t think you’d take this much convincing.”
“Then I suppose I’ll have to ask you to excuse me. I suspect the elves will be considerably more persuadable.”
From the corner of his eye, Draco saw Harry shake his head. “I wanted to. Part of me wanted to. But I guess when the time came, I just… I knew I shouldn’t.”
Harry blinked, and started from the top again. There were children’s programmes in the mornings, adult education and senior programmes in the afternoons, events for students and artists at night. All of it was free. There was no way Malfoy was making money off of any of it. Given the number of programmes that offered free food and childcare, he must have been losing a mint.
Galder appeared just as the clock on the sidebar chimed eight, announcing “Mistresses Bulstrode and Granger, sir.”
“But…” Harry’s eyes flicked to the web of scars on Draco’s chest. He looked at them pointedly and back to Draco. “What if you don’t know that? What if it could’ve been worse?”
“Very well.” Draco let his eyes flicker shut for a moment. “I will visit in the morning. Are my rooms ready now?”
“Working with Healer Barrett… it was good in a lot of ways. And it’s not like it’s the sort of thing that can ever be—I’m not sure ‘cured’ would even be the right word. But managed. And it made all the difference, that you realised that, figured out what to do about it. I—” He sounded choked up, and Draco was a bit grateful that he continued on in a different vein. “Anyway, I kept getting closer to being back to where I had been before, and Gawain and John kept poking around, asking questions about it, wanting to see what I could do. And I realised either I would have to pretend to be sicker than I was, or I’d have to own up to being able to do wandless magic that…well, I kept practising and I’d guess it’s good enough now that they would’ve wanted to make something of it.” He sighed. “As always.
was the end result of a fortune and a reputation that was centuries in the making. And you took it all, down to the last saucer, the last runner, the last duvet.
Harry’s grin is all the answer he needs to give, apparently. As soon as he’s turned it on Draco, Draco leaps up into the air, hovering there, waiting.
Draco waved a hand for him to stop, and took a long sip of water. “Fine,” he coughed. “It’s fine.” He cleared his throat. “Surprising, but I understand the unique charm of Pansy Parkinson. That was actually a bit of food down the wrong way.”
It rose up before him, looming closer with each step, blocking the sun and taking up more and more of the sky as he approached.
He’d skipped it just once, when Millie and Blaise dragged Pansy and Greg along with them on a trip for his birthday, all of them staying at Draco’s, which quickly began to feel quite a lot like an older, drunker, funnier version of the Slytherin common room. Pansy had come close to making up for a decade’s worth of missed shopping opportunities, given the chance to use her royalties for once. Greg had visited every museum and walked more miles that Draco could keep track of. Millie and Blaise had wandered the city drinking more than their share of coffee and wine and looking disgustingly in love all the while, and Draco could’ve bought Pansy yet one more pair of shoes for every quick-witted jibe that left them all laughing. He’d only wished it was longer, and his flat felt woefully empty in their wake.
“No, because they’re not leaving my sight. We have a plan, and while you may not particularly like it, you have agreed to translate the texts.”
They’d used to bump up against each other easily, gripping arms to point out a particularly tacky tourist or holding each other up when they’d had a pint too many or breathing whispers into each other's ears or jamming into a crowded booth and sitting so close that there was no way for their thighs not to line up against one another, for their fingers not to brush together. But even then it had, as if by silent agreement, been kept to the strictly accidental or the plausibly deniable. But, Harry thought, if he did, and if Draco did, then perhaps it would be okay to run his fingers over the sand until they met Draco’s.
“I do actually know the difference between snakes and... well, you know, I think cock, Malfoy, is the word you were looking for.”
“Next time,” Draco whispers, as though the words are unfamiliar. “Next time,” he says again, nodding, and dips his head to kiss Harry.
He grinned at the sputtering that followed and planted a hand on Malfoy’s chest, pushing him backwards across the room and on to a low settee.
“Don’t you dare, Draco Malfoy. Don’t you fucking dare. I wanted you. Thirty owls worth of wanted you. A year of waiting before I so much as looked at another bloke wanted you. Bizarre appreciation for the most intrusive staff of photographers imaginable wanted you. Let you appear out of nowhere and blackmail me into a date wanted you.
Reaching into some reserves of strength, Draco forced himself to stand. “Walk with me.” He moved towards the door, fully aware of his stiltedness and unable to spare concern for anything other than putting one foot in front of the other.
The question of the hour. It certainly hadn’t seemed to where Potter was concerned. He pinched the bridge of his nose. “Does anything?”
Draco bends his knees and jumps. He doesn’t fall, and it takes Harry a long moment to realise what he’s seeing. Draco, suspended over the ground, without a broom.
He does not, however, mention his mystery man, much to the public’s consternation. The buzz infiltrates even the Prophet’s own newsroom. Draco can’t leave his office without overhearing such a ceaseless stream of questions–“Who’s the lucky bloke?” “What I wouldn’t give to trade places…” “Do you think he’ll come forward?”—that he’s half-tempted to release Potter’s name just to be free of the speculation.
The end of his sentence is lost to Potter’s mouth. One moment Potter’s coiled on the edge of rage, the next Draco’s pinned to the shelving again. Potter is a hot weight against him. He kisses Draco urgently, pressing first lips, then tongues together.
Draco had expected Potter to keep going in his clumsy, relentless way. The stillness was far more unnerving. Potter was almost never still. Draco didn’t know what to make of it.
“Casting while you’re focusing on different emotions. It may be useful that you haven’t done it before, as it means you don’t have a preconceived picture of the end results. Your magic is controlled enough at this point that I expect you’ll complete the spell correctly each time, but it will show us whether and how your emotions change the end result.”
“Hmm?” Harry can’t help but be suspicious of the hint of amusement he sees written across Draco’s features. “What is it?”
Harry leaned forward speculatively, and Draco raised a thumb, brushed it over his cheek, and followed it with a kiss, just under his cheekbone.
She shook her head so minutely that Draco barely caught it. “However, the Minister needs to speak with you at your earliest possible convenience and directed his office to make contact by any means necessary. Will you meet with him?”
Draco took one of the chairs. He didn’t miss the disappointed quirk to Harry's mouth, and added, “Just so I’m not distracted.”
“That only gives us two days, which is barely sufficient for even an anecdotal report. This afternoon.”
By the good graces of the Minister, Draco had Millie waiting at home for him after work, along with a thin dossier outlining the details of the case. He had insisted—interestingly, to Granger’s seeming approval—that he couldn’t decide on the spot. They’d given him 24 hours for an indication, and 72 for a final decision. Six had passed and he still hadn’t entirely wrapped his head around the news.
The thought relaxed him. If it wasn’t something he was fighting, maybe there wouldn’t be anything to think about. He could just let it go. He didn’t have to pretend not to be interested, or to talk himself out of noticing Harry’s better qualities. He would acknowledge it and let it go.
