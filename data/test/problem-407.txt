"You do if you don t know how to make the potion already."
After pondering over the past few years he decided his first order of business was to drop the glamour he had worn since his seventeenth birthday. Then he was going to get his eyes fix and a few wizarding tattoos. Next order he was going to burn all of his clothes and get himself an entire new wardrobe.
"Mister Malfoy I would assume that was obvious. He had help from myself and someone who knows how to manipulate the portraits here at Hogwarts."
Harry was starting to get tired. It had been a long stressful day for him and he had to be up early for classes. He didn't want Draco to leave but he needed sleep. It was already approaching midnight and his first class was at nine, but before he could say anything there was a set of strong arms embracing him from behind. Then a quiet yawn and a warm breathe could be felt on his cheek.
He had been at Potter Manor for a week thinking about what had happened in his life before he decided what he was going to do. He remembered during fourth year during the Tri-Wizard Tournament how he snuck down to the Chamber of Secrets and found Salazar s Sanctuary. He was allowed entrance and it always confused him why the Founder referred to him as his true heir and showed him the true secrets of Sanctuary. He spent three years down there learning from him. Salazar had even given him a snake ring that was a portkey tuned into the wards that surrounded Hogwarts that would return him to the Sanctuary when the given phrase was said in parseltounge. Fifth year brought Snape down to the Chambers. He had followed him after a disastrous oculmency lesson. Snape had seen the power and control of the spells he had been casting and demanded answers. So he brought him to Salazar to gain entrance to the Sanctuary. He learned of the abuse that he had suffered from his family and the trust that Salazar had placed in the young man. This brought Severus into the fold and he to began to tutor and train him when he had time from his duties as a professor and spy.
slender woman wearing regal robes with her long hair flowing freely and a beautiful diadem on her head.
"Harry you have to drop the glamour for the test to be accurate. I'm sorry." Andromeda said in a sad voice.
When he had entered the Great Hall for the welcoming feast he saw the golden trio minus the one he was searching for. He noted the absence of many of the Slytherins only two besides himself had returned, Pansy Parkinson and Millicent Bulstrode. He listen intently to the speech Headmistress McGonagall gave about the new teachers and the announcement of the eighth year tower that would house all returning eighth year students and that each student would have a single roommate from their house to reside with for the year. This announcement meant Draco would have a room to himself as the only returning male Slytherin. She then went on to announce that their head of house would be Professor Vector and that they would be given some special privileges that year that would be handed out with their time tables later. It was after her speech that the first years came in to be sorted and the sorting hat sang his song about school unity and even encouraged the traits found in every house. Draco was proud to see many first years entering into Slytherin. When the last student was sorted and Professor Sprout was placing the Sorting Hat on the chair to be returned to the Headmistress office a bright light emanate from the hat and the Great hall fell to silence.
He, Draco Lucius Malfoy was not a morning person. So he was very surprised when he woke up and was not at all groggy. He was more surprised at his surroundings, the canopy of the bed he was lying in was covered in the celestial sky, but what shocked him more was the warm body beside him and the strong arm around his waist that kept pulling him closer. Slowly the night before was coming back to him. How Harry had let him into his secret life and showed him that he truly cared for him. He was content for the first time in a long while so he decided to snuggle closer to the warm embrace. That was until he heard hissing coming from his chest. His eyes widen as a head appeared from a small coiled mass that he had not noticed. Emerald green eyes seemed to glow at him and before he could rouse Harry from his sleep Nisha struck out at his throat. A scream tore out of him and woke Harry who was asleep next to him. Panic filled his eyes and body as a burning sensation coursed through him. He looked into the panic stricken eyes of Harry as he watched him look down on him.
hear her.
The only eight year Ravenclaw to be claimed was Padma Patil when a pale yellow light engulfed her.
"Yes if you would all like to know I will show you after dinner today." He said. Draco let go of his arm and he went to leave the Great Hall. On his way out he was stopped by Hermione, Ron and Ginny entering.
He said as he pointed to his throat. He watched as Harry bent down and kissed his throat. The pain slowly ebbed away and he felt the familiar tingling sensation replace it and race through his body.
"Welcome back, I have made a list of potions on the board, I would like you all to choose one of the potions listed and work on it individually. You have the remainder of the class to work on it and may leave after a finished vial is on my desk and I would like a two foot essay on the aspects of the potion and individual ingredients due at the start of next class you may began."
"Possible. Look I should go I have to meet them in a half hour. I will see you and the girls around seven."
"Who is it Sage?" Draco question. He was tired of the constant invasion of his home by the Ministry and the Auror department. Aurors had been station to guard him and his mother until there trial. His father was once again in Azkaban and his friends had abandoned him.
first part of the show” Godric chuckled
He said as he stroked her smooth scales as she settled around his neck once again. W
Harry saw as a faint silver line appeared on Draco's chest. It ran from just below his right shoulder to just above his left hip. It was not straight but rather jagged. He knew from a distance you would never be able to see it and he realized that Draco hid it from him because he didn't want to remind him of what he had down. "I am sorry. I should never have used that curse against you. And don't tell me that you were going to use an unforgivable on me. I know you better than you think and you have to really want to inflict pain on someone for that to work and you never had it in your eyes at that time. I am so sorry." He said as he felt the tears beginning to form in his eyes and he looked down onto the stone floors. He didn't hear Draco come stand before him but he felt a warm hand caress his cheek and bring his chin up to meet silver grey eyes.
"I said I was sorry but he did try to kill me and I did tell you that if I could find another one or an egg that I would bring it here just for you."
"Well that's good for you Dray. So you are going to tell him right?"
Sirius Black
things go and if I do get y N.E.W.T.S. done then I will be free to run Hogwarts at and Administration level and McGonagall could handle the students and I could manage everything else.”
"Thank you Neville." After that they got to work working on carefully repotting the Devil Snare seedlings.
"No, it's nothing."
The little snake responded and slithered her way back up her master's arm.
"You never told me why you didn't turn me over in your Manor?"
"Harry I... was hoping you would walk with me to Potions I was wondering what time you would like the girls to meet at our room tonight." He said as he watched Granger turn on him and glare.
Nisha hissed next to the terrarium on the table.
"Yes I was the one that requested it if you remember. Plus I know you are going to love the teacher for the class, but I don't think you have ever met her before and I honestly can't wait until then. Things are going to start to change around here and I am sorry that I am dragging you into this if you want out all you have to do is say the word Draco and your free."
He had seen into the snakes mind and knew what it wanted.
Morning arrived too early for Harry. He was just stepping out of the shower when Kreacher arrived and grabbed his hand and with a pop he was in his and Draco s bathroom starring at a much disheveled Draco.
"So Harry you going to tell me what happened this summer?"
He heard a small green snake say. He walked carefully over to it trying to avoid the many tails in his way. It was exactly how heremembered it down to the crack through its surface. He quickly reached down and picked up the stone. He then placed it into his robe pockets and thanked the various snakes that had remained. When he felt Nisha crawl up his body to rest around his shoulders he used Salazar s ring to return him to his rooms. He had about a ten minutes before Herbology started so he quickly placed the stone in the box next to the Elder Wand then ran for the exit.
"Sorry that was from Andromeda. She was just letting me know that I would be seeing her and Teddy soon." Harry turned to the owl Artemis, "Apollo has missed you go find him." And with that Draco watched as Artemis took flight towards the Owlery.

"Severus be nice to the boy. Hello Harry." The woman with red wavy hair and familiar green eyes that had accompanied Professor Snape said.
"Harry..." he looked into the emerald green eyes of the one who held him "your snake seems to be talking to me and I think I can understand it as well. What is going on?"
"I'm not sure I would call that fun." He squeezed Harry's hand as he said, "I am glad you survived."
Draco watched as the students went to receive the clothes they were to be tested in. The girls were given cotton shifts and the boys were given cotton draw string pants. He was surprised to see that more than a few of the students didn't go to receive their clothes and were being ushered out of the hall. The number of students had decreased by half before he went to change into his pants. He waited next to the door that Harry had entered curious if he would keep the glamour on or if he would take it off. He wasn't surprised when the door opened and Harry stood their barefoot and with pants slung low on his narrow hips. He heard gasps and whispers when the two of them returned to the group around the circle.
"Hey Po-Black." He yelled and watched Harry turn around and Granger practically run straight into him.
"Sorry for my behavior Pansy, I just returned from a difficult conversation. Lets get down to business shall we." Harry said as he gestured towards the door. Draco watched as Harry masked his emotions then followed him out of the door with Pansy and Millicent behind him. They followed him down the hall a ways until they came to the alcove at the end. Draco saw that a blank portrait was now residing there. "Kreacher."
"No… no no… I was…Just to sleep mind you… there is a guest room and everything. I ughh."
"I don t understand. Is there someone else?"
Draco couldn't believe that Harry Bloody Potter was going to be giving him competition in his grades this year. When he walked into Arithmancy he thought he had walked into the wrong class, but when Professor Vector had announced that he got a perfect score he was shocked. He had come in second to Granger by missing half a point and Granger was shy of perfection by missing seven points. The look on her face to be beaten out of first place was priceless. He would have to thank Harry for that later. They were on their way down to the dungeons for potions and he could tell that Harry was trying to avoid Granger and just barely succeeding so in true Slytherin fashion he decided to intervene.
Draco asked.
"Look I was scared and you guys already had enough on your plates, with leaving your families to go with me I didn t think I should bother you."
"I do wish you would call me mom Harry. Why am I here at Hogwarts?"
Harry walked over to the table and was repulsed by what he saw. A once beautiful snake laid mangled next to its cage. He could tell that at one point tis scales were white with a pearlescent shine to them. He laid his hands on the limp body and poured his magic in to it. He watched as the numerous cuts began to heal.
"Hello Professor."
"I think it is time that you have Kreacher take me back to our room Harry."
"Go away" away he yelled as he continued to kiss his way back up to Harry's lips.
"Well, that's a long story and it really isn't mine to tell. You will have to ask the Professor, but I think you would have better luck if you see Lily and ask her. Well its late and I have homework to do so good night." Draco watched as Harry retreated to their room.
"Thanks mo chorí." he heard Harry say as he walked out the door. He defiantly was going to look for a translation charm soon, he wanted to know what Harry had been calling him.
"Thank you Hermione. Draco is he alright?"
"Well Potter or is it Black now. It is no surprise that you cannot go a single day here without causing a stir. The whole castle has been speaking of your theatrics in the Great Hall this evening." A familiar voice raised him out of his musings.
"Hello Mister Malfoy, I apologize for not speaking plainly but I needed to inform Harry of certain, information that you are not yet ready for. I welcome you to my Sanctuary in the Chamber of Secrets, I do wish you could have meet Letalis. He was very sweet when he was young, but alas he meet his end a few years back."
Hermione was the last to go for the Gryffindors and to many of the students surprise she was not shown to have any affinity for the elements. He watched as she went off disappointed to sit next to Ron.
Soul Mate Bonds:
Harry had led them into an ante chamber of sorts where two snake statues stood guarding a door and suddenly the room was filled with hissing.
"Good by Lord Black."
Harry watched as his two ancestors stood in front of him, he could feel Draco shift him so he was leaning against him. "I thought you said that you couldn't take any form?" he asked Salazar.
"Nice ink mate." He heard Seamus say to Harry.
"It be my honor Master." The elf replied with a low bow and a twinkle of mischief in his eyes.
"Okay Nana, bye 'arry, bye 'raco."
come. I must tell you the last heir will be here soon and his mate is waiting for him. You must have many
In an instant he had transformed back and grabbed Hermione's and Kreacher's hand as the apparated to where Nisha needed him. The scene they came upon made Harry's blood boil. Draco was currently yelling at the Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor and Nisha was trying to slither closer to a table with a terrarium that was covered in blood. There were first year Slytherins and Ravenclaws cowering in the back of the room as they watched the Malfoy Heir yell at their professor.
"Harry they never commissioned a portrait of Professor Snape when he was Headmaster, so how do you have one here?" Millicent asked.
"Harry, MALFOY. It may not be Slytherin of me but I would at least like us to all be civil and I promised a certain Professor to look after his snakes this year since he could not."
"See you in Potions." He heard Draco say as he closed the door and couldn t help but chuckle. There were only a few students in the common room as he swept through, none who tried to stop him. He made it to the Great Hall with no interruptions and sat at the far end of the Slytherin table. He looked over to the Gryffindor table and noticed that Ron and Hermione were not there yet but he nodded to a waving Neville. He ate his breakfast in silence and was about to leave when Pansy sat down across from him with Millicent.
"Luna what have you seen."
"Those of you that wish to study to be an Animagus can see me after class. I will have a special class held on Saturdays to study. Mister Black I hope if you have free time during these classes that you would assist me."
"Now there is one more to be sorted this night. One who has found out the truth and knows who he truly is, Mr. Harrison Corvus Black," the old hat said.
"Yes, Professor. This is Nisha Professor." Draco watched in amusement as the little snake lifted up her head and eyed Slughorn. He could tell that she was a lot more intelligent than people believed her to be. She was also something more than Harry let on, her green eyes seemed to glow and were calculative at times.
"I love you mon beau couer"
"You listen here Harry James Potter, I mean Harrison Corvus Black. You come out this instant or I'm coming in."
They were interrupted at that moment as a beautiful black owl with a letter. Draco watched as it landed on Harry s outstretched legs and as he took the letter which he quickly read then placed it into his robes.
"That may be true but I will always have you. You have never once abandoned me, you may have not liked me but you never let up on being a bloody prat to me. You have always been a constant Draco. Thank you." He said as he sprawled out on his bed.
" Mmm 'k." he heard the quite voice say. He watched Harry turn the small boy in his arms to face him. The amber eyes that looked at him slowly changed to a silver grey and the black hair started to have blonde streaks appear throughout it.
"What about us Harry?" Ginny asked.
"Lord Gryffindor I apologise but you no longer have the power to demand this."
"And you trust that slimy git."
Harry watched as the rest of the class pulled out their books. He noticed Hermione looked upset at the fact that there was no real instruction for the class she sat next to Dean and tried to get his attention. Padma and Pavarti sat behind them already deeply involved in their books. The class rounded out with three other Ravenclaws, two Hufflepuffs and all of the current Slytherins.
"Keep your secrets for now Harry but I will find them out."
"Harry it's me. Can I please talk to you?" he heard Granger say.
"Hello Miss Parkinson. I am glad that you are getting along with Mister Black here. I hope that he will help with breaking the tension with the other houses. It does not bode well for the rest of the houses to discriminate against Slytherin. Malfoy would you kindly close your mouth you look like a fish. If any of you need my assistance for something that is important you may call on me. Now I am going to retire." They watched their Professor say as he turned and left with a flourish of his robes.
"An angry cat and a happy badger, chaos and mischief."
"Sorry Professor, but she is still much too young for that she is only a few months old and I feel it would upset her." And with a wave of his hand Draco watched as Nisha vanished from her spot around Harry s neck. "Sorry she wanted to return to our rooms she was getting a chill and the fumes were upsetting her Professor." Draco couldn't believe it he had just witness Harry preform wordless and wandless magic as if it were nothing and then return back to his potion as a dismissed and stunned Professor walked around the class to inspect the rest of the students potions. They continued to work in silence and every now and then Harry would give him a tip on his potion which Draco noted. His potion was coming along a lot faster than it had before and it was perfect thanks to this new Slytherin at his side.
"Thank you Kreacher." Harry said before the elf walked out of the room.
"Lily leave the boy alone."
One more Hufflepuff strode forward to be dismissed before the Ravenclaws started filling in to the circle. He was not surprised to see the dark yellow tendrils from the air rune encircling Luna who was the only Ravenclaw claimed. He was not surprised to see the intensity of the color when Luna's affinity showed. He knew that she was stronger than she let on.
When Ron entered the circle the white light engulfed him then faded into nothing and he could her Draco chucking next to him so he elbowed him to quite his boyfriend before a fight could break out. Neville was next and the intensity of the green tendrils came as a surprise to Harry and to Neville as we as he watched his dazed friend go sit next to Luna. He watched as the rest of the Gryffindors go and was happy to see that Parvati was going to join her sister with a pale red light.
When they entered the Potions lab he immediately took his usual seat and watched as Harry sat down next to him. It was a few moments later that Slughorn entered. Looking around the class he noticed that all the house seem to sit together except for the Pavarti twins who sat next to each other. Ron and Hermione shared a table as well as the two other Gryffindor girls he could not remember. Three Hufflepuffs shared a table together and the remaining four Ravenclaws broke off into pairs.
"Nice to meet you to 'raco." Teddy said as he wrapped his arms around his newly discovered cousins neck. "You need to meet Nana too."
"Yeah, I was hoping for a better wake up than this but I have to get ready for class it seems we have slept part way through breakfast. I have Ancient rune and you don't have class until third hour and that isn't mandatory so we have until lunch to work on this. I'm going to get ready then we will go back to our room and I will meet you at the start of second hour to help you. We will figure this out Draco I promise." He watched as Harry leaned in and kissed him. He felt the passion and even the concern Harry had for him behind it. He could admit that he was jealous of Harry's ability to speak to snakes and he never imagined that he would have that ability one day but now he did and he was a bit worried at what it meant for the two of them. He watched as Harry rushed to the bathroom to get ready.
“I am very proud of you Harry for asserting your authority, but next time give us more notice I missed the
"Yes... Yes I believe you are right Mister Black. I would like everyone to practice the spells seen today and to try to cast them non-verbally for next class."
once he is done mourning”
"Look I never intentional blocked or have I ever rejected our bond. Yes we are Soul Mates and I have suspected this since the beginning of summer but wasn't confirmed for me until I kissed you. We have always been drawn to each other. I thought you were the most beautiful boy I have ever seen when I first met you in Madam Malkin's but then you had to open your mouth and you reminded me of my cousin who's favorite past time was Harry hunting. Our bond mutated a bit but it was fixable because we never fully rejected it and that was mostly due to things that happened to me when I was a baby." He watched as Harry paused to take a few breathes, "I am going to tell you something that only four people in this world know; one of them only guessing and two of them are now dead. Voldemort split his soul into pieces and hid these pieces into dark artifacts called Horcruxes that was how he would return. The last year during the war Hermione, Ron and I went and collected the remaining Horcruxes and destroyed them. When he came after me when I was a baby he accidently turned me into one. I was a Horcrux, I walked into that forest knowing I was going to die and I was okay with that. It was the only way to defeat him. I didn't die because when Voldemort cast the killing curse it killed the piece of his soul that was attached to my scar. When I went to the Manor to return your wand I couldn't help but feel drawn to you in a different way than before, there was no feelings of rivalry. You looked so confused and depressed and all I wanted to do was wrap you in my arms and comfort you and this scared me so I left."
"If you answer that I warn you that you will pay for it sometime in the future." He whispered into Harry's ear.
"Oh, it is just a book about bonds and bondings. I was curious about something the Founders had said today." He looked up at Harry and he could tell that he was trying hard to hide something. He pulled the covers back and crawled in next to him and opened the book once again to start reading. He hadn't noticed the first time that there were two ribbons marking sections in the book. He decided to turn to the first section and began to read;
from a great darkness that is coming. For some of the old ways have been forgotten. The future is
"Your mother is insufferable." Snape directed at Harry.
"There you are young man. What have I told you about running off?" a very frazzled older witch said as she took a reluctant Teddy from his arms. "Thank you for taking care of him… good Merlin you look just like Cissy when she was younger. I'm Andromeda Tonks it's nice to finally meet you newphew. You can call me Aunt Andy if you like but if you pass the tests to get in to my class I guess it will have to be Professor when we are in class."
"I understand Lord Slytherin."
It wasn t long until he reached the familiar clearing. Memories of that night came flooding back to him. He remembered seeing his parents and Lily. It wasn t long until he heard numerous voices approaching. He turned to confront them but realized that what he heard were the voices of hundreds of different snakes.
"Thanks Harry, just a bit nervous."
With a pop the elf was standing before them. "Yes Masters."
"I wouldn't do that if I were you." He turned to face the portrait behind the desk. "He trusts you and when he is ready he will show you but he isn't yet. He still unsure of your intentions when he knows what his are."
Next to go were Pansy then Millicent who both left disappointed.
"Why yes but I believe your friend here played a part in his demise."
"Hey guys, I am sorry. I know we need to talk but I have to go see McGonagall. I will talk to you at dinner if you would like. We could meet in the Room of Requirements and have dinner there."
"Yes Miss Granger?"
The hour or so he was gone passed in no time. He had taken a shower and Nisha had worked with him to show him the difference between the two languages. She would shake her head when he was speaking in the human language that she couldn't understand which helped him slowly get control of his new ability. When Harry returned they held conversations back and forth and by lunch he could control his new ability.
Draco heard him say yes to the professor as he went in search of his room. He wasn t surprised to see that Harry s name was on the door with his since he was the only other Slytherin boy. The room itself was rather large there was two double beds on either side of the room with a door leading off to what he presumed was a private bath between them next to each bed was a desk that sat under a window and a large wardrobe next to that. He was surprised when he noticed there was a very old house elf in what looked to be a black silk pillowcase with a rest on its back unpacking his things from his trunk that resided at the end of the bed he presumed was his.
"She is right Draco."
The sounds of the Great Hall had come to a stop as two ghostly figures came to surround Harry and Draco.
. "Aghhh….Hermione can we talk tomorrow?"
The war was over. He had defeated Voldemort only hours earlier and now he hid in his old room in the Gryffindor tower away from the celebrations and away from his grief stricken friends. He had truly become the master of death now that he had all of the Deathly Hallows even thou he had dropped the resurrection Stone in the Forbidden Forest. Everything that had happened over the last few hours had not prepared him for the news a Goblin form Gringotts brought.
banish a foul reprobate who made first years participate in torturing one of magic’s sacred creatures,
"I know my son cares for you a great deal. He spoke often of you this summer even if he didn't realize. Plus portraits talk here and I know all about your past issues that happened here. Really… "Potter Stinks" Badges you couldn't have screamed for more attention."
"Really."
. He looked down and in a terrarium on the bottom shelf was a small but very beautiful black and silver snake with glowing emerald green eyes.
"He accepts Harry with a standard contract with the exception of the student clause, he will be having a student live in his chambers and you can arrange to have Flitwick grade my work."
"Why Black are you asking to sleep with me?"
"Ronald Weasley how dare you call him a freak." Hermione yelled. Everyone was shocked even Ginny looked appalled at Ron for calling Harry a freak because she knew of his past.
"What are you laughing at Harry?"
Harry wasn't very far into the forest before he called Kreacher. The little elf had Nisha wrapped around his waist as some sort of belt.
“I think I am going to have to do what Sal and Godric suggested I don’t think Bingham is going to let
"Aghh... so what is your class schedule for the rest of the week?" Draco nervously asked.
"Well it can't get any worse." He sad as they exited the hallway into the common room.
"Somewhat I could go get it and read it in here. The magic this afternoon took a lot out of you and you need to rest. I will watch over you I promise." He kissed Harry on the lips and rose from the bed to retrieve the book he had left in the library.
"How are you feeling?" he asked
"You brought Kreacher with you? How could you, I thought you agreed with us about house elves."
Disclaimer: I do not own the Characters from Harry Potter but I may have borrowed a few for my pleasure.
“Well madame the Heir can appoint a new teacher if he so chooses without your approval just as he can
And now that he was on his way back to Hogwarts to finish his final year of schooling, part of his sentence, he was thinking about Harry wondering if the Savior of the Wizarding World would be returning as well. He had looked for him at Kings Cross Station and aboard the Express but did not see him.
"Lets see you have been obsessed with boy wonder since first year and you came out to us during fourth year. Come on the only reason you dated me was to please your father and now you don't have to. So are you going to tell him that you're gay and that you like him too, because it is obvious that he likes you. He has been looking at you in all of our classes and he was subtly flirting with you as well."
"Yes, but he does not. Only one remains in slumber the other two are awake and I feel they will make their presence known shortly."
"Just want to understand your Heir." He said chuckling as he returned to Harry casting the charm on his way.
"Harry, you could work with me I don t mind." Neville said as Harry was walking by.
"I said take it off." He looked at Draco and could tell that he meant what he said. He had never showed anyone the scars that he had. He preferred to take a shower last and when anyone was around until the day that Severus saw them and helped him make a glamour potion that they had found in the potions library. He watched as Draco continued to stare at him as he removed his clothing and slipped his own black sleep pants on over a pair of rather tight pair of green boxer briefs.
"No Harry" she then turned to Viktor and pressed their foreheads together. "Hello Altor"
He moved his hand to tangle in Harry's hair while the other caressed its way down to his waist. He heard him moan as he pulled away to get a breathe of air then he continued to lay kisses along his jaw and down his neck. Harry's hands were caressing Draco's back and he could feel them slowly lowering down to his arse when they were interrupted by a knock on the door.
The whole class turned and starred at him. He could hear Draco mumbling of course he is an Animagus as he stood up from his chair. He headed to the front of the classroom and stood in front of his peers. He felt the magic rise up in him and he felt his body grow in mass and length. Black thick fur began to coat his body and he began to crouch on the floor. In a matter of seconds where he once stood was now a large black tiger with silver grey strips and stormy grey eyes. He stood about four in half feet tall, his body length was an impressive elven feet long and he had to add another three in a half feet for his tail. He took up most of the front of the classroom. He could hear the many gasps of the students and when he looked around many were in shock.
"Let me guess your mysterious Tutor."
"See I told you the new look was just an act Mione." Draco could hear Ron say before there was a large gasp from the rest of the students.
"That is not very Slytherin of you Potter." Draco said as he slide in next to him.
“You can call me Grandmere Roe and so can Harry lil one. We founders will help guide and protect you
"And just who do you think you are?"
"I believe he has locked himself in that charming cottage with the Lady Evans. Good night Harry and Draco."
"Hello Harry."
"I know and I am sorry, but things were made clear this summer. Some of things that I had felt were put into perspective and that's why there can t be an us."
He waited patiently in their room for Draco to be done talking to Lady Ravenclaw. He knew that the information he got from her would be just for him unless Draco wanted to share it. Their familiars were currently entwined together on their bed. He must have dozed off because he awoke to a warm body curling up next to him and a head full of blonde hair pressing a kiss to his chest then settling down.
"I'm sorry I didn't know it was still this bad. I can swear to you that you're safe with Pansy, Millicent and I. We never wanted to join and mostly did what we had to, to look out for ourselves."
Ever since fourth year he had started to change his opinion about Potter. His hatred towards him because of his slighted offer of friendship started to fade. The following years it turned into admiration and when Potter saved his life it turned to something else something he wasn t prepared for and now after he heard Potter call him Draco he knew that he could no longer call it admiration.
"Agh, Harry my boy I heard that you have an Indian Krait, very rare they are."
"Sure you do but from where I am standing I don't see any scars on you only a few tattoos."
He looked at him and noticed that everyone was staring at them. "Thanks Neville. Only if you don t mind."
"Do you trust me?" he heard Harry whisper into his ear as he was looking into the openings depths.
"Sorry I couldn't resist. At least its clean now, the first time it was all dirty and this place was filled with bones of all sorts of small animals. Dobby helped me clean it up since I helped free him and he felt guilty for almost killing me."
Draco started laughing. “So it was you in Hogsmeade that day! The three of us were so freaked out and confused.” The volume at the table dropped. There weren't three anymore, and people hated being reminded of the war.
As Harry sat down, he said, “Monday was amazing, but by the end of Tuesday everything went downhill.”
Harry smiled and said, “First, I accept your apology, though I have no idea why you thought being mean to me would work well if you wanted to be friends. And, second, yes, I’ll be friends with you.” After this, the two boys went back to chatting with the group.
“Well done Malfoy, ‘ermione. Five points each.”
Hermione
He woke up in a surprisingly good mood. It was Monday, and his first time meeting Gregor was yesterday. He woke Ron up and threw his robes on. He ran down the stairs. He spotted Hermione and said, “Let’s go down to breakfast early. I want to say hi to Hagrid during lunch, so that means we should stop at the kitchens after breakfast, if we actually want to eat.”
Lips moved synchronously against each other as Harry gently cradled Draco’s pale, aristocratic face with his rough, tan hands and it wasn’t anything like it was when he had kissed Cho or even Ginny. There was a distinct rush of adrenaline like you would get on a roller coaster. He gently pulled away, but only because he needed to breathe. He looked at Draco, and said, “I’m sorry. I should have asked first, but… I have a crush on you too.”
They all sat down, Harry on the chair closest to the door, Ron and Hermione on the sofa next to each other, and Gregor in the other chair.
Pansy was the first to go. “Never have I ever done it with a guy.” Harry’s glass stayed full, but most of the girls took shots, but Luna, Draco, Dean, Seamus, Neville, Theo, and of course Blaise took shots.
They practiced for an hour before it was time for dinner and the trio went to the Great Hall. Sam went to sit at the Hufflepuff table, and the older boys went to sit at the eighth year table. When they sat down, they were bombarded with questions about who 1the kid was, and why they were hanging out with him. Both Pansy and Hermionie said, “Who is that first-year Hufflepuff kid? And why are you hanging out with him?”
They all sat in a circle, and Dean started. “Umm… Hermonie. Truth or dare?”
When they finished dinner and reached the common room, they were all laughing. It was surprising how well they got along when they weren’t on opposite sides of the war. Most of the group sat down on the floor by the fire to chat. Everybody else either studied or had something else they were supposed to do.
Hermione laughed and said, “What are you gonna do? Curse me? My dare still stands.”
There was a man, who he assumed to be the mind healer, sitting at the desk. When he heard Harry enter, he turned around. He looked to be in his mid twenties. When he stood up he looked to be about 2 meters tall.
First, I’m sorry I haven’t posted in so long. I am not going to give up, so even if it a couple months, I will finish this.
She sat down with a sigh. “He’s right. I wanted something more interesting in the bedroom, but he isn’t up for that.” Harry glanced at Draco for support; the blonde spoke up, “I get it. I- I left one of my partners because of similar reasons.”
As Harry pulled out his book, Draco set up their cauldron. “I’ll go get the ingredients,” Harry said. He then went to the small supply cupboard. As he reached out for the ingredients, a boggart suddenly appeared. The shapeless creature started to swirl and shift to his greatest nightmare. But before the creature could take shape, he quickly yelled out “Riddikulus!”
Draco laughed, before saying, “You forget you’re a wizard sometimes, don’t you?” kissing the tip of Harry’s nose.
She rolled her eyes, “Truth.”
“Not so great. This past week has been hard.” Harry said with a small, tired smile.
Neville went next. “Never have I ever had a panic attack.” Almost everyone took shots at this. The only one who hadn’t taken a shot, other than Neville, was Theo. No one was surprised by this, the war was tough on everybody and no one survived a war without trauma.
The room then fell silent. Harry could feel his breathing quicken, his heart began to race and his palms sweat up. The room became hot and cold at the same time, and he felt light-headed. Under his breath, he muttered, “Oh no, not now.” He took a deep breath trying to calm his breathing, but it did nothing. He felt his legs go weak, and he slid down the wall. He was barely breathing, and he was shaking like crazy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“One of his triggers is thunderstorms, but we don’t know what all of his triggers are yet. Our goal today is to teach you about panic attacks, triggers, and how to help people through them.”
Harry smiled and cupped the blonde’s jaw with his hand. “Love, I will always support you. The war was hard on everyone, and the only reason I’m doing well enough to not be jumping off the Astronomy tower is thanks to therapy and Gregor.”
“Hey, are you alright?” Harry asked with concern, sitting next to his best friend.
Letting out a breath she didn’t know she had been holding, she said “Thank you, professor. Is there anything else?” Briskly the professor said, “Not immediately. Right now, I think you should go and make sure Mr. Potter isn’t having a panic attack after you ran away.” “Ok,” she responded.
Hermione smiled softly and said, “Do you want to tell Ron or do you want me to?”
After classes were done for the day the eighth year students decided to play a game of Quidditch. The teams were mostly Gryffindor v.s Slytherin, but there were also some Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. The teams were slightly small, with only two chasers each. The teams were Harry, Ron, Neville, Seamus, Luna, and Dean v.s Draco, Pansy, Blaise, Theo, and the Patil twins.
He replied with a “Nope. I was hoping you could deal with that?”
Gray eyes looked from the sunlight bathed sky to the green eyes staring at him. Draco searched his boyfriend's eyes, looking for pity or other things he didn’t need. When he didn’t see anything other than love, he smiled and looked back to the sky.
Soon, though Ron brought up his nightly tears. “Hey, I really don’t want to bring this up, but what’s goin’ on? Every night I can hear you crying, and I wanna help, so what’s up?”
Harry sighed. “I know, but… I want him to see that people change. I do think he knows that even if he doesn't realize it and I think he and Hermoine are going to split up very soon. ”
“Wow, it does sound like it has been a really long week. Let’s start by working through what happened between Ron and Hermionie. I’m surprised they didn’t work out. I always thought they’d end up married and have a little family of their own. What happened?”
Sam blushed and said, “It’s not like I can practice a hex on anyone, and I’m only a first-year.”
She was on the verge of tears. What can she do? “I’m going to talk to professor McGonagall. We are going to get you out of there.” She heard Harry start to protest, and pointed out, “this is not ok, we are going to do something.”
As they reached the great hall, the Trio sat down together as usual at the Gryffindor table. His mind must’ve wandered very far away because Hermione said, “Okay, what’s on your mind?”
Hermione then spoke up, “Same. Have you checked with McGonagall to make sure it’s okay?”
Hermione glanced at Ron before saying quietly, “Over a month ago.”
Hermione was first to give a fact, about Harry. “The only reason Harry didn’t fail potions sixth year was because he had a book with a lot of tips and shortcuts. It used to belong to Snape.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ll go get my set.” The blonde kissed Harry’s temple and ran up to his room, grabbing the old expensive wizard's chess set from his trunk. He walked back down the stairs, pausing when he was across the room to just admire his boyfriend. Harry was handsome. His emerald green eyes were the reason he liked green so much, more-so than it being a slytherin color. And his tanned skin reminded Draco of a pool of never-ending caramel, his untamable nest of raven black hair, surprisingly silky and smooth that Darco loves running his fingers through his beloved’s hair until Harry was smiling sleepily and content. That’s not all he liked about him. Draco also loved Harry’s unwavering loyalty and sense of judgment, and the fact that he knew what a horrible childhood he had, yet still has the biggest heart out of everyone Draco knew, made his love and respect for Harry grow.
Hermione shook her head, but Ron spoke. “If thunderstorms are triggers, what can we do during thunderstorms?”
They stood in front of the cage and stared at the creature. It was about a meter long and looked like a scorpion, but with bird wings, and feet. The blue eyes were staring at them, and the stinger was a pinkish color.
How you enjoy!
In the end, Fred and George ended up yelling Angelina Johnson and Katie Bell respectively.
They all walked back to the common room and sat in front of the fire to chat. They all eventually decided to play a game. They decided against Never Have I Ever, because they didn’t want to get drunk. Eventually, they decided to play Truth or dare.
He managed to transfigure his splinter into a small end table. Class ended, seeing as he had been in the hall for close to twenty minutes. He decided to tell McGonagall the reason he ran out of the room for the majority of the class.
After a moment Harry started to speak, “It started ok I guess. We have our own table and common room. It is going pretty smoothly, and it was really nice to get to know the Slytherins, and not be expected to fight with them.” He took a deep breath and finished with a smile, “Draco has changed a lot. He-he’s actually very sweet… I’m bi, and we are dating.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The room was deathly quiet for a moment before Gregor broke it. “I bet that surprised you. On the outside, he seems very confident, cocky, arrogant, and a down right git, but on the inside he isn’t, and is in fact, very vulnerable.”
“Most of these are just from scratches compared to others, but the words on the back of my hand were Umbridge’s doing. This big one on my chest was from a locket that turned out to be a Horcrux. Then there is the one on my forehead, everybody knows the story of that one, I- I don’t really have any other major ones, but I do have a lot more.” Harry shifted, hiding the scars on his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
As he trailed off, Gregor said, “I’m sorry about how your only family treated you. I hope that next time you go back there, it’s better.” Harry just responded with a quiet, “Yeah.” As he was now lost in his thoughts.
“Draco, it’s beautiful. How old were you when you made this?”
Draco slowly sat up and pulled off the shirt, folding it up neatly to organize his thoughts. “The ones on this hand were from the fire, in the room of requirement. There are the ones all over my chest from that night in the bathroom. There are some self-inflicted ones on my arms, then… there are the ones on my back.” Draco then turned around, talking over his shoulder. “These… were from my father’s belt.”
“I think it is hard for you to open up to people. I would guess that you kinda have mixed feelings about his reaction?”
Luna was next, and no one really had anything about her. She was pretty innocent and was a little strange, but never embarrassed about it. After this, they decided that they should quit for the night, but not before they added it to the list of games for them to play on Friday nights.
Draco smiled and let himself be dragged away.
Harry sat down, sighing. “Thanks. Tell her that Draco and I would come to see her, but we are in- Oh wait. I’ll send a patronus her way.”
Harry smiled and pulled out his books.
Harry nodded and with this, Harry walked out of the room with a tense “Bye.”
When Ron confirmed this he said, “First, I want you both to promise me you won’t do anything rash.” Hermione said quietly “I won’t unless there is anybody getting physically hurt.” “Same here mate” Ron assured.
Most hands stayed down, but about five went up. “Ok, only six, so Truth or Dare wins!”
Gregor pondered for a moment. “Well, most likely, everything would be okay. We should make sure all the professors know about panic attacks. Once we find out more, we can also try to avoid situations in class. Anything else?”
“You can see the sunset from here, and at night, all the stars and the constellations are visible. Draco, Sirius, Regulus, Andromeda.” Draco said quietly, playing with Harry’s hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
Both Harry and Ron laughed, and Hermonie soon joined in.
Harry was stunned, and a wave of nervousness swept through him. “Yeah?” He said again. Draco took a deep breath and sighed before continuing.
Well, it’s a long one! Enjoy!
Sighing, Hermione said, “You really should talk to Gregor.” “I know Mionie.” He sighed, “But the next meeting is still almost a week off. I can’t really do anything until then. I’m gonna try to sleep. We do have classes tomorrow.” Getting up he crept back to bed. He heard Ron come up a couple minutes later, as he drifted into a uneasy sleep.
“Draco, love.” Harry hesitated, not wanting to overstep any boundaries or make him uncomfortable. “Can- can I see some of them sometimes? The drawings or the paintings, or to hear you play?”
Draco gave an exasperated look saying, “I’m not going to tell you, for two reasons. One, I deserve it. I killed people in the war. Two, you don’t need to scare the Gryffindor out of first years. The war was already enough trauma for everyone, let alone eleven-year-olds.”
Harry gave his best friend a small smile and said, “I get it. He did do some pretty bad things during the war, but I think he was doing his best.” He paused and looked around for a moment before saying, “We better get to class.”
Draco dragged Harry into his room, locked the door, and pushed his gorgeous, hot boyfriend against it. Harry’s mouth was on Draco’s. When he pulled back to catch his breath the blonde asked, “How- how far do you want to go?”
Harry reached over to his boyfriend for a kiss. The kiss turned into multiple, and soon Harry was sliding onto Draco’s lap. As they paused for a moment to catch their breath, Theo walked by, glancing at their red lips, laughed, “Get a room.”
The blonde snorted with laughter, saying, “Why on earth would I do that? I want everyone to know we are together. Unless… you don’t want that?”
Hermione sighed and said, “Not really.” She added, pointing it at Ron, “We can finish this later.”
So this was my first beta’d chapter, so hopefully it was easier to read. I absolutely love it, thank you again, Liiizzaabeth_Rose
The eighth years continue to get to know each other.
Theo was the first to start laughing and said, “So that Gryffindor wit got you in trouble. That totally doesn’t sound familiar...” Neville blushed and hid his face in Theo’s shoulder. Theo just laughed again and said, “And now that bravery is gone. Hmm...”
He froze, his mind racing. “I- I’m so, so sorry.”
Often when he had this dream, he would wake up with those same feelings, the walls crowding in on him. Thankfully, this was not one of those times. He would have to talk to Gregor about this, if there was a name for it, if it was normal. If there was a way to stop it.
As she stood and left she realized she didn’t know where the boys were. She decided to go to the front steps and check if the boys were still at the lake, even if it was a pretty big detour in the huge castle.
As they walked down to Care of Magical Creatures, they chatted about what they would be learning about today. They reached Hagrid’s hut and saw a flying scorpion-like thing in a cage outside the hut.
Harry sighed retracted his wand, nodding his head “Yeah hopefully,”
After thinking, Harry responded. “Well I’m not 100 percent sure, but I think being around people would help. Being on the lower floors might not help as most of the problem is the fear that walls might collapse. Outside might help; it’s not the storm itself that bothers me but being in an open space helps me a lot.”
Draco sighed with a slight smile. “More people than you think have panic attacks after the war, I’ve seen almost everyone in eighth year have one. I’ve also had them as long as I can remember.”
After that, most people had a free period, while others had Arithmancy. Hermionie headed off to class while Harry pulled Ron aside to tell him what happened. After he had told the whole story, he said, “I’m gonna go to the library, there is something I want to look up. I’ll meet you for lunch?” Ron nodded his assent before they went their own ways.
Dean was up next, and Seamus had a fact about him. “The first time we kissed was both of our first kisses. It was absolutely horrible! He completely knocked both of us over.”
Throwing on his robes over his pajamas, he crept quietly down the stairs. Sitting in a comfy chair, he tucked his legs up under him. Staring at the fire, he thought about the recurring dream. He had been just sitting on his bed, in the cupboard. He was so scared, but there was no good reason. He felt as if the small walls were creeping in on him, suffocating him.
He laughed. “Oh. Yeah, I wasn’t really subtle about it was I? I was gonna come out to you and Ron tomorrow, but… I think I’m bisexual.”
Harry hesitated. He didn’t know if it was a good idea to give Malfoy’s secret away. Still, he remembered that Gregor had said that whatever was said in here, stays in here. So, he took a deep breath and responded in a quiet voice, “He told me that his father beats him every day.”
Draco stood up and grabbed his boyfriend’s hand, dragging him away from the lunch they had just finished, whispering in his ear, “I want to show you my favorite place in the castle.” Harry smiled softly, still amazed that the blonde trusted him this much.
Harry let out a huff. “Remind me to thank her. Never thought I would be thanking Pansy Parkinson of all people.”
I hope you enjoyed! I think I am going to go for shorter chapters more often, rather than longer ones, partially because I know that I will forget to write... on that note, I will trust you guys to hold me responsible- here’s an Instagram just for you guys to remind me! @anikafangirl_  Thanks for reading, (plus I would love you forever if you left kudos or commented...) and bye for now!
Draco’s hands made their way down to the buttons on the other’s shirt. He pulled back, looking at Harry’s closed eyes below him. Harry opened his eyes, giving a small nod, yes, Draco could take his shirt off. The blonde slowly started unbuttoning them, moving his mouth to the other’s neck. Draco finally got all the buttons undone, and tried to slide the shirt off, but was obstructed by the bed.
Hope you enjoyed! Thank you to my beta, Liiizzaabeth_Rose!

Around him, he knew that the Gryffindor team had scored 40 points, and the Slytherin team had 30. He didn’t really register it though, in his own world, high in the air.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam responded, “Now I don’t wanna do a hex, I wanna do a wandless hex!” The older boys laughed and Harry said, “Well, I’m sure that you could do that, but before you can do it without the wand, you need to be able to do it with the wand. Sam nodded and said, “Carry on with the lesson then.”
Harry took a slow step into the room. Draco followed and then stepped ahead of the rubble. Harry stayed near the entrance, and Draco picked his way through the debris towards the back of the room, barely visible.
2, The Golopocus Larialahs. My friend came up with this, and it was too funny not to add.
Ron and Hermione both said hello as they shook Gregor’s hand.
As they ate, Pansy told him, “You really should just ask him out. I have a hunch that he isn’t straight.” Maybe he wasn’t straight, and Pansy was right, but he would wait until the other boy came out. If he ever did.
Harry must’ve seen the flash of gold because he hadn’t moved his eyes and was flying like a curse. They both kept flying and reached where Draco had seen the snitch. He followed Harry, and then he saw another flash of gold right in front of him. He reached out to grab it and it was gone.
As soon as he was out of the great hall, he sprinted up the stairs to Gryffindor tower. He slowed when he reached the portrait, pausing to give the fat lady the password. When she swung open, he quickly headed up to his dorm room. Walking in he flopped onto his bed, and as soon as he touched it, started crying.
Harry looked up to see Draco’s gray eyes and platinum blond hair. He heard the blonde asked quietly, “Is it ok if I touch you?” Harry nodded, that wasn’t the problem right now, Draco set his hand gently on Harry’s arm, and Harry calmed down a little more, at least to the point he could talk.
Harry was shocked. Had… Had Draco been nervous that day after he had found him outside the classroom? He had seemed not as brave or witty as he usually did… Could he seriously have been nervous? Why would he be scared? He decided to ask about it later.
He could get through it. Breathe, he told himself. He wasn’t freaking out right now, but he was definitely on edge, his nerves, on fire. As they moved onto double transfiguration, it started thundering. He hoped he wasn’t going to have another panic attack. The class sat down, and the lesson started. They split into groups to start transfiguring splinters into tables.
He had broken up with Ginny a week or so before, after realizing he didn’t feel that way about Ginny anymore. He had tried to make it gentle, but it had turned out that sometime during the war, she had figured out that she was bent, and wasn’t attracted to men.
Draco smiled sadly, grabbed Harry’s hand, and said, “Harry, the war is over. Hopefully, no one will ever have to think that way again.” in a soft voice.
Gregor said, “Hey, it’s ok. I know that was probably hard to say, but this room is a safe space, it’s ok if you cry. It’s ok if you yell, this is a place for you to get everything out. There is never any judgment in this room. Got it?”
He was taken aback. This was not what he had been expecting. Draco-had wanted to be friends? Why had he always been so mean to him? He decided that the past should be left in the past and to be friends with Draco.
Moving forward he nodded and started. Gregor stood up and opened a drawer in his desk, and after shuffling around for a moment pulled out a thick set of cards in a plastic bag. Sitting back down he pulled them out and put them in three piles, one red,  one blue, and one green, the same colors as the pieces.
“Well, here’s what we can do. I can get you some dreamless sleep potion, and we can try to teach you some breathing exercises to help you cope. If you are comfortable with it, I can help teach your friends, Ron and Hermione, how to help you through one, and what to expect when you will have one, so they can keep you away from your triggers. They could come in with you next week if you want, and if it’s ok with your teachers.”
As everyone finished their breakfast and grabbed their bags before class Harry decided that he would go to the library in his free period while Hermionie had Arithmancy so he wouldn’t be pestered by her.
The shy looking kid nodded and offered a small smile. The boys all stood up and Harry said, “If we are going to practice stinging hexes, we should probably go into the Come and Go Room.” Draco said, “Before that, what is your name? My name is Draco Malfoy, and this is the famous Harry Potter.”
Harry shifted so he was sitting cross-legged facing his only friends. Taking a deep breath, he started talking. “I grew up with muggles. My aunt and uncle, they don’t like me, never have. I grew up not knowing I was a wizard.”
He realized he had said nothing to her since she had left earlier, he quietly said, “Thank you. I don’t know what I would do without you.” She smiled and said, “You would fail all your classes, and continue to be a depressed. For now though, let’s not think about that. We are all going to take this evening off.”
I hope you enjoyed! Thank you LiiizzaaBeth_Rose
Harry let out the breath he didn’t know he was holding, but Draco stayed silent, speechless. Harry pressed on, “Dumbledore always knew I had to die. He never told me. I had to find out through Snape’s memories.” Harry spoke quietly, not confident enough to speak louder. Draco was looking away, so only when he looked back at his boyfriend, he saw the tears running down his tanned skin.
“I-I’m sorry. I wasn’t expecting that one. Thank you, but how did you know what to do?”
When he was flying, he was always in his own little world. He was separated from all the drama in the waking world. He didn’t have to think about if his grades would be good enough for his father, or if he would be beaten because of the dark mark that was forced upon him. He didn’t have to worry if he could get a suitable job.
Both Hermione and Ron nodded at this.
Well, chapter two! Enjoy!
As Harry stepped into the fire, he steeled himself for what he would tell Gregor. He emerged and saw Gregor sitting at his desk.
Taking a deep breath, he responded, “Yes. I kinda told Ron about this before, but apparently, I have had panic attacks.”  He shuddered. “I freak out about things, for example, small spaces, cupboards, and thunderstorms. I want you two to be able to help me avoid those things, so I don’t get triggered, along with being able to help me get through them.”
“Hello, Gregor. New glasses, I like them.” Harry said with a smile giving his therapist a hug.
Anyways, hope you enjoyed!
“Draco and I started talking about our childhoods. I started, and I told him about the Dursleys. He… he lost control of his magic. He was so angry. We didn’t talk much more before deciding to call it a night.”
When he walked into the common room, only Ron and Hermione were up, quietly talking. When they saw him they jumped up and as Hermione hugged him, Ron asked, “How did it go, mate?” He shrugged and said, “Better than I expected.” Hermione stepped back and said, “Well, I think we should all get to bed. We do have classes tomorrow.”
Harry laid out the blanket he grabbed on the grass near the lake and sat with his chin on his knees. It was a very nice day, with the sun shining but it wasn’t too hot. He heard running footsteps approaching but didn’t turn.
All of them seemed nicer. Most of the Slytherins, or their parents, were death eaters, but they had changed. Malfoy at least, said he was trying to forget his pure blood status. He even had apologized to Hermione and Ron for his teasing and really did seem to be making an effort.
As everyone headed to the great halls, he handed Pansy a note. He had enchanted it so only she could read it. It said, ‘At least I’m friends with Harry. I wish I could be more, but he’s straight. I would rather be friends than enemies.’ She glanced at him, and said, “Who knows. He broke up with the Weaselette.”
Harry sighed. He hated being reminded of his status as ‘The Chosen One.’
Harry smiled and nodded before whooshing out.
Dean smirked and said, “Well, how about… when was the last time you slept with Ron?”
Theo hid his face in his boyfriend’s shoulder. Neville just let out a small laugh and kissed Theo’s temple. They made an adorable couple.
For the rest of the time until his appointment they all studied and did their homework, though he and Ron did get distracted. By the time dinner rolled around, that had gotten almost all of their homework for the next week done. When they finished dinner, Ron and Hermione went back to the common room to finish their work, after dropping Harry at McGonagall’s office.
Harry silently thanked his boyfriend then spoke up, “What can I do to cheer you up again?” Hermione sighed again. “I don’t know. I wonder if he even still wants to be friends.”
Harry chewed on his lip before saying, “I guess for now we can try to keep it at Hogwarts. I don’t think it would be good if the Prophet found out that I was in a gay relationship. I personally don't care, but I’ve also had that amount of publicity for years.”
I hope you enjoy!
He felt Hermionie bury her head in his shoulder before she completely broke down. He glanced at the gray eyes across the room, and saw the sympathy in them. He whispered in the girl’s ear, “Hey, it’ll be alright. It isn’t that he doesn't care about you; I just talked to Ron, and he thinks he isn’t enough for you. It’s not your fault, alright? ” Hermione hugged him tighter, before letting out a big sigh. She slowly released him from her death grip and walked over to her bed.
A magical buzz slowly started filling the Room of Requirement, sending tremors through the furniture. Harry finally lifted his head, trying to find the source of the disturbance. Draco was breathing deeply now, and his eyes were closed. Harry realized what was going on after a moment, it wasn’t the first time it had happened, but it was the first time he saw it happening to someone other than him.
McGonagall looked at Harry with concern and pity in her eyes and responded, “Thank you kindly for telling me. I had my suspicion, Ms. Granger told me that she was leaving to try to calm you down. I understand that you don’t want your personal business to be common knowledge.”
The next morning he awoke to two panicked familiars darting under the covers and slithering their way up between himself and Draco.
. He watched as Nisha slithered over to Draco then rubbed her head against his chest then returned to him. As she passed through his shield she returned to her normal size.
"Draco she gave you a gift. I am not sure why of yet but all things will be apparent in time. You can speak and understand parseltongue now."
"Right. Teddy go sit with Aunty Minerva."
know that is how Fawkes found me so many years ago. I believe he should be returning to Harry soon
the tower.” She said as she vanished from the study.
"Clearly you are dafter than I thought."
“Mon couer what is wrong”?” Draco asked as he squeezed Harry’s hand.
"Okay Harry."
"How would you know that?" Draco asked as he poured himself some tea.
"Well if you want you can come with me to find out mo choir."
"It's okay Professor Tonks." Harry said as he waved his hand in front of himself.
"Harry you didn't wake me. I was in the library reading a book." He decided he wasn't going to tell him that he been snooping around his study.
"Always the Slytherin. I will tonight but you will have to get permission it is not up to me."
Harry couldn't help but chuckle under his breathe at Draco's comment as the walked into the Great Hall for lunch.
He was finally happy. Andromeda had accompanied him to a muggle doctor to fix his eyes and then spent the next week with him and Teddy to make sure he was okay. They were the only ones who he had kept contact with in the wizarding world. He wrote his friends every few weeks but he couldn t bring himself to meet up with them. Death Eaters were still on the loose so Shacklebolt against his wishes assigned a few Aurors to keep tabs on him until the remainder could be apprehended.
"I know Salazar, sorry my dear lady. I am Godric Gryffindor and this is my longtime friend Salazar Slytherin. You may address us as Lord Gryffindor and Lord Slytherin. We have come to formally claim our Heir."
the door.
"Sorry Sev. But your godson was trying to break into Harry's wand box."
"I need you to keep a secret. You don t have to worry about sharing a room with me I have other arrangements in the castle that no one knows and most wouldn t understand. So these rooms are yours but for appearance sake I will leave some of my things here like Kreacher suggested. If someone comes looking for me just tell them that I am out or that I am in the bathroom and send Kreacher to get me."
"Draco it was never a game. Please let me explain everything, you need to understand."
"Well I have an idea. What do you think about Viktor Krum? I was going to bring you to meet him this weekend in Hogsmeade. He did get his Masters this summer, he studied under some Bulgarian Master."
"Nothing of importance mo choir lets head out and leave these two alone to chat and have a quiet day in our rooms."
"This repugnant imbecile was teaching first years cutting hexes on a living snake," he said as he pointed to the terrarium. "I could hear his screams all the way in the Great Hall were Andy was going over the things she required we have for our classes starting next week, she will send you the list. Harry he is in so much pain he wasn't conjured, he is alive, and in pain I can feel it. We have to help him Harry please?"
It did not take long for McGonagall to spot Harry and come storming at him in all her Scottish glory.
"I'm sorry my dear you can't take this class." He heard her whisper to the student as she stepped out of the circle received her wand back and went to sit near the back of the room until the rest were tested.
"Well I hope you keep that thing away from me."
He looked to Harry as he could feel his face pale.
"I'm sorry but it is the only way to get the doors to open when locked."
"No Master Black, Kreacher can't sense anything like those," he said as Nisha was slithering down his leg to the forest floor.
"Why the hell couldn't they just understand... and who gave them the right to judge who I like." Draco watched Harry rant as he took of his tie and sent it flying across the room and continued to pace the length of their room.
The commotion in the Great Hall Thursday during third hour was over whelming. Harry and him had walked in hand in hand to see all of the eighth year students and about half of seventh years staring at a circle that was in the center of the room. He didn't get much time to examine the circle before he realized that his boyfriend had released his hand and was bending done too scoop up an energetic ball of blue and green.
"So you didn t think we deserved to know what happened during your birthday." Ron growled out over a mouth full of Shepherd s pie.
"Sir are you talking of the basilisk?" Harry watched Draco ask.
Both Susan Bones and Wayne Hopkins, eight year Hufflepuffs, were shown to have affinities pale green surrounded both Susan and Wayne.
Harry still in his lion form began to slink back to his seat and changed on his way effortlessly. By the time he sat down Headmistress McGonagall had called the class back to order and they began to study their lists.
"You re a what?" Ginny yelled it was the first time she made her presence verbally known. She had been trying to put her hand on his leg all night and he kept brushing it off only to find it on his leg again minutes later.
Draco watched as a shirtless Harry bent down to pick up Nisha then hissed something and disappeared in a swirl of green and silver. This is going to be a very long year he thought to himself in the now vacant room. Whatever had happened to Harry to change him this summer Draco wanted to know. He liked the new changes in his once rival and he couldn't wait to discover them all.
There are very few ways to intentional block or break a Soul Mate Bond. The Cor Nigrum potion is one of the darkest potion in the magical world and if brewed incorrectly it causes instant death. Cor Nigrum is irreversible and must be given to both mates to work. There are no recorded spells to block or break a Soul Mate Bond. There have been reports that a Soul Mate Bond can be blocked by possession of a mate and one instants when a shattered soul latched on to another person's souls. In this case once the piece of the shattered soul was removed the bond returned between the mates.
He looked up surprised but grasped Harry's hand and again he felt that tingling sensation. "Are you sure you want the others to know?" he asked as he looked down at their joined hands.
Harry said as he put an arm around Draco's waist as Andromeda called the students to order before he could ask what Harry had called him.
Harry could feel the nervousness radiate from Draco next to him as another seventh year Hufflepuff entered the circle and was dismissed. It wasn't until Melissa Jones entered the circle that the first student was claimed. The white light had faded to reveal pale green tendrils snaking their way around her from the glowing earth rune on the floor.
Draco sat down at the end of his bed and watched as Harry got up and removed his shirt to toss it on a chair next to his wardrobe. He could barely contain the gasp that tried to escape his lips as he saw the tattoo on his now bare back. He watched as the snake around his neck slithered down his arm across another tattoo to rest on the bed and turn to hiss at Harry.
He knew something was going to happen he could feel it the entire time he was in the Great Hall as his classmates were slowly shown their affinities, he just didn't know exactly what. When the white light surrounded him it nearly blinded him. He felt the elements respond to his control and as the light faded the dark tendrils of green, yellow, blue, and red wrapped around him searing lines into his flesh. Green vines began to wrap around his left weaving in and out of his tattoo of his father's name. Yellow feathers began to appear on his right arm. Red flames and blue waves crashed against each other on his back to surround the Deathly Hallows tattoo. He could barely hear the screaming of his name form the students and teachers that surrounded him. It wasn't until the dark tendrils of light faded back into the runes that their sound penetrated the circle.
"Well..." he said as he unbuttoned his robe and leaned back against the tree. "The morning after Voldemort's defeat a goblin from Gringotts showed up in my room and insisted I come with him. It was there that I was read my parents will and the man I thought of as my godfather's will as well. I found out that Lily Evans was not my mother, but that she carried me for my fathers, James Potter and Sirius Black. I found out that I had been lied to yet again my entire life by people that I looked up to. The Weasleys are the only ones that are still alive that knew about it and they didn t even tell me. So I guess that I kind of decided that I was going to be true to myself. I dropped the glamour that I had on myself and I dropped the Harry Potter act. I always thought that I had to play a role, the role of savior. Being Ron and Hermione s friend I had to play the role of na ve wizard and play down my intelligence. I will tell you something that they don t even know. The Sorting hat first year wanted to put me in Slytherin and I talked it out of it partly because of you being a prat to the first and second friend I have ever had and the fact that all I heard about them was bad."
"If you insist sir."
living snake. I believe he may have caught it in the castle because it is now Draco’s familiar.” At
Draco didn't know what to think when Harry came storming into their room. He watched as Harry ripped off his robes and through them in a bunch in the corner then yell for Kreacher. Nisha even seemed to want to get away from her master as fast as possible. He could feel the frustration and the anger coming of him in waves.
"My apologizes Severus but it needed to be down. I believe even you told me I should have been in Slytherin towards the end of sixth year. I played the part well and never did I reveal to Ron and Hermione that I knew of the oath you gave to Dumbledore. By the way if you haven t heard already I cleared your name with the Ministry and I have a present of sorts for you."
“I’m sorry lil one, it was not fated yet. You had to accept your mate and he you. I may be tied to Lady
"Ronald."
They walked hand in hand to the Great Hall for lunch and sat at the Slytherin table together. Pansy and Millicent didn't let this go unnoticed for long and soon they were the topic of gossip though out the hall.
"I know." Harry said as Draco watched him release the small blonde.
He really didn't know what to expect when he returned to their room. He had assumed that Harry had disappeared to where ever he was hiding. So when he entered and he saw Harry sitting on his bed with a letter in hand and two owls perched on a conjured stand he didn't really know what to do.
"Harry, do you want something Draco?" said Harry as he was trying to keep a frustrated Granger at bay, Draco noticed.
It only took them a few minutes to reach the second floor girls bathroom. He watched as Harry greeted Myrtle then begin hissing at a sink. He watched in awe as the sinks began to move to open up to reveal a large opening into the floor.
"Harry wait..." he heard Ginny call out to him as he left them standing there next to the doors. He didn t turn around he was still trying to figure out what he was going to say to them especially after they saw his performances in their up coming classes.
"If I remember correctly on more than one occasion they abandoned you."
expect them to be ready to teach class on Monday.” She announced so everyone in the Great Hall could
Nisha hissed out a yes in response and nuzzled Argentum's head.
"Harry I am not like Weasley." He said as he walked over to Harry. "I admire you for coming out to your so called friends. It took me two years to come out to mine, and it took fifteen seconds for Pansy to say about time. So I cant judge you because I would be judging myself." He said as he stood in front of Harry and looked into his eyes.
"No he is my friend and I like him. He was only being a prat to save himself. You don t know him."
Draco watched the conversation between Harry and his familiar trying not to be bothered by the hissing. He was sure now that the Gryffindorks had not realized the snake s relationship with Harry. He also had to admit watching and seeing Harry speaking parseltounge made him quite attractive. Many of the onlooker s eyes seemed to be glazing over and they were drawing a crowd as they traveled through the corridor to the potions lab.
"I had a little help."
"I think it wise that we head to the Great Hall I have a feeling all hell is about to break loose."
could barely hear the howler yelling. Godric and Salazar were waiting for them as they entered into the
“What do you want to do Harry? I now Draco and I will support you.”
"Now Salazar he is not only your heir but mine as well as you know. Gryffindors may be able to call the sword in great need but he has always been able to call it forth at will since it is rightfully his." Godric said as he looked at a stunned crowd of students and teachers.
"Well that's easy. I was always supposed to be in Slytherin. I talked the Sorting Hat out of placing me the first year and I asked the Sorting Hat this summer to re-sort me and it did. As for Draco he is not the enemy, must I remind you that he didn t turn me over to Voldemort."
By the time he had Kreacher setup dinner in the Room of Requirements Ron, Hermione and Ginny were entering the room.
"Why should I care about a stupid snake?"
"I remember that. Father was not happy he locked me in my room for a week once summer came."
"Don't let Harry bite." The girls said together as they returned to their room chuckling.
Harry felt a heat burn through him from where Draco s hands were but dismissed it as embarrassment of being only in a towel and with a hiss of parseltounge he found his way back to his rooms to finish getting dress.
"Sleep tight Draco."
"I was wondering if we are going to be studying the Animagus spell since it is not on our list."
"Please do not yell Mister Finch-Fletchly. Mister Black was registered during the summer so he is perfectly capable of assisting. Mister Black would you care to share your form with us."
"Mister Malfoy I believe it is your turn." Andromeda called. He squeezed Draco hand before watching him walk up to step into the circle. The white light was more intense this time and Harry watched it fade to reveal not only the familiar blue light that seemed to claim the Slytherins from the water rune, although the darkness of it made it seem to shimmer black at times, but also a dark yellow coming from the air rune as well.
"Don't worry Draco, she holds nothing against you. As she has said to me before we were just children thrown into a war we should have had no part in. She has wanted to meet you for some time now."
"Master Black your guests have arrived. Would you be needing anything else?"
without your knowledge or your consent” Salazar said loudly.
Herbology passed by in no time. The next class was Defense Against the Dark Arts where the instructor, an Ex-Auror named Clark Bingham, decided it was his personal duty to duel against each and every student to see where they were, and what needed to be taught. Harry s fellow classmates did very well and the duels were over within minutes. He noticed that Hermione, Ron and Neville gave him a good fight and that Draco, all though some of his spells could be questionable lasted the longest. Professor Bingham decided to save him for last. Harry couldn t believe that the old Auror thought he was going to get the best of him. He played along for a while but when he was getting bored he decided to finish it. Bingham had casted and Expelliarmus while he casted a wordless Protego Maxima and sat down in the middle of the classroom. Professor Bingham stood there and continued to cast spells but nothing could get through and after a while Harry had enough. So he stood up and placed Nisha on the floor then wandlessly and wordlessly casted Engorgio on her then allowed her to pass through the shield. She was enlarged to about 7 meters long, he watched as the rest of the class backed away from her and Bingham stood slacked jawed and starred.
"See you later Harry." She said and turned and kissed Severus on the cheek then left the portrait. Draco couldn't help but chuckle and neither could the girls beside him.
"It may have betrayed you which I know you could overcome, especially because you know of everything he did for the light and also for me. But you need to know that he never abandoned you he did all of that for you once he saw the errors of his ways, and I have it on good authority that he still loves you and if you would just give him a chance."
"Sure love and I am the Heir of Ravenclaw."
"He is a Malfoy, he is the enemy." Ron bellowed.
"Well lets start with the obvious. What happened to you this summer to make you change so much besides the whole parent thing but I am guessing that it is part of it." Draco asked as he took a seat next to Harry.
He turned around in the boys arms and looked him in the eyes. Those silver grey eyes seemed to ensnare him and he did not want to let go so he leaned in and stole a kiss from the pink lips that belonged to them. The kiss was brief but it still sent a warm tingling sensation up his spine. It had been happening every time he touched Draco and he was beginning to become curious about it. He leaned his forehead against him and barely whispered "You could always stay here with me."
“Well what are you going to do then Heir?” McGonagall snapped.
"When did you meet up with him and just why did you not tell me that we were seeing him this weekend? I could have had plans. Blaise sent a letter I got it this morning in the Great Hall during breakfast. He is coming this weekend to talk to McGonagall about returning here to finish out his studies."
Harry landed in the common room of Salazar s chambers. The founder himself could been seen asleep in his portrait so Harry slipped pass to enter the study. He took the Elder Wand that he had been carrying with him since the war out of a holster that was on his calf and placed it in a box sitting on the mantle above the ornate fireplace. He had placed a fake one in Dumbledore s grave without anyone being the wiser and kept the real one with him. He figured since now that it was part of his ancestry it belonged with him and no place was safer than the Chambers. He had hung his invisibility cloak up next to the mantle in its place. . He was planning on going to the clearing in the Forbidden Forest tomorrow during a free period to retrieve the Resurrection Stone and place it with the Wand as well, then the three Hollows would be together again and in a place he deemed safe from the outer world. He took a seat in the chair behind the desk to gather his thoughts before retiring to bed. Tomorrow was going to be a day to truly test his friendships and his temper he presumed. He missed his friends but he could no longer deny who he was. He was sick of playing the role of the savior and one of placating his friends. Over the years Severus and Salazar s training and tutoring had made him very knowledgeable in many of the subjects that he played fool in. This past summer he took the O.W.L.S for Arithmancy and then owled Professor Vector and completed all of the required sixth year exams receiving top marks and would be joining her NEWT class this year, he even took the O.W.L.S. for Ancient Runes and passed with an "O".
He let his magic go and watched as the snake latched onto Draco's wrist. He stood there and felt the bond form between the two of them. He waved his hand over the snake's body and the blood disappeared and he realized that the snake was an albino Indian Krait. He knew that the two would be alright so he turned to face the Professor. His anger had returned with a vengeance for he had glimpsed what the snake had been through at the hands of this man. He saw the first years being comforted by Hermione over his shoulder a few had tears in their eyes.
"He was actually when he found out, I think I gained some of his respect then. But let me finish well I went to a muggle doctor and got my eyes fixed after I moved into Potter Manor. Then got new clothes and my tattoos, grew out my hair and basically hide away from the magical world all summer. Even went to a gay club in London one night. Not sure how to tell Ron that part yet. I studied a lot, took my owl in Arithmancy and Ancient Runes and passed then took all the exams Professor Vector and Professor Babbling had assigned after I had owled them. Then read up on all sorts of Pureblood traditions and etiquette so that I would no longer make a fool of myself. I think that explains my summer, except appending time with my godson and his grandmother."
"Thanks I love you too. Since we are up how about breakfast you sit and have some coffee while I go take a shower." he kissed Draco quickly on the lips and went to take his shower as Draco waved him off while hovering over a steaming cup that Kreacher had set in front of him.
"Good, because I want you too." Harry said before he claimed his lips in a searing kiss.
He looked around at the stunned room. "Okay I guess I should try to explain that as well. Nisha bit Draco and now he can speak and understand parselmouth, that's all I can say for now. Most of you know that I found out my true heritage this summer. I am related to both Salazar Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor through my father James's side of the family. The Sorting Hat originally wanted to put be in Slytherin but I talked it out of it and it placed me into Gryffindor. Salazar I mean Lord Slytherin has been training me since fourth year when a lot of you abandoned me because of the Tri-Wizard Tournament. I was alone and I couldn't handle the pressures of everything so I retreated to the only place I could be alone and I found Salazar's Chambers in the Chamber of Secrets. He was quite mad at me for killing Latalis but he decided I was worthy of learning from him and began tutoring me. After an eventful lesson from Professor Snape he followed me down into the Chambers fifth year because I forgot to close the entrance he saw my abilities and began to tutor me as well that is why that I am currently the top of the class in all of my classes. After I found out who I was this summer I came back here to talk to you Headmistress about school and after I went to visit Salazar who explained a lot about my heritage to me as well. He told me of the founders stirring and the castle waking, he also told me of the Room of Prophesy that is hidden here in the castle. All of the prophesies were made my Lady Ravenclaw and are written on the walls and once conditions are met are they visible to others besides the founders."
“What should I call you?”
"Draco can you tell the difference when you are speaking parseltounge?"
"Your right mon beau coeur. So what are you going to do about the DADA Professor?"
"Why not, I waited for you. You said if we all survived you would give us a chance."
"Kreacher."
"Kreacher could you fetch me my night clothes from our room. The Italian silk ones."
"You did Severus but I wanted to see Harry and find out how his first day of classes went. I missed his first day of Hogwarts I am not going to miss it now.
"And which professor is that?"Pansy asked.
He nodded yes to Salazar.
"It is a very nice honor to meet you Teddy." He said as he shook the small extended hand." Giggles erupted from the small boy then he held out his arms to him to be held. He looked back at Harry before taking the boy from him.
"Mister Black I believe it is you turn." Andromeda said as he handed his wand to her. "Please step into the circle."
"What are you doing?" he asked as he watched the aged elf hang his new silk shirt up in his wardrobe.
"My apologies Professor, I had a meeting with the Headmistress this morning and it ran a bit over. He said as he went to the front of the classroom to hand her a note."
"Fine bloody familiars and bright birds."
"You knew about this didn't you?" he asked Harry as they left the Great Hall for the hidden entrance to the chambers.
Love always your Father,
"Teddy this is your cousin Draco, my boyfriend, Draco this is your cousin Teddy Remus Lupin."
He placed his hand into her cage and allowed her to slither up his arm ad rest around his neck. He then went to the counter and asked the clerk to gather the things he would need for her.
"Bloody birds you mon beau couer attract the strangest of creatures."
"You do know sir that one there is highly poisonous, it has tried to strike everyone who has got near it. I can hardly condone you buying it and wearing it like a necklace."
"Yeah my life has always been filled with fun."
"I'm guessing that didn't go well."
**I have Harry their is much I must tell you and your mate. But my story can wait as it is still early. I did not mean to scare your familiars, i would never hurt them they are apart of you. I just wanted to let you know that I have returned and the bond we should of had is complete, it started to forge all those years ago that first day you touched me. That is why I can talk to you and your mate, i have a way from the castle too. I will be up in Godric's tower when you wish to talk.** Fawkes then vanished in a flash of flames and was gone.
He was taken back by what he heard. "So what should I call you then?" was all he could think of to saying to him.
The meeting with McGonagall went as well as he expected. She was upset that he didn t tell her about his talk with the Sorting Hat and about his discoveries this summer. When he had left her office he could hear her having a heated discussion with Dumbledore s painting about keeping secrets. By the etime he had reached the seventh floor Arithmancy classroom, Professor Vector had already started class.
shall have a new teacher by next week.”
"What?"
Nisha hissed.
"Bloody hell Kreacher." Harry said as he took in the sight of Draco standing there stunned.
"I know you can't Hermione and I am not asking you to. But I know who he is I have seen through his mask I have had a lot of practice in that. Draco is complicated he did most of the things to protect himself and his family. He was never a Death Eater, he never took the mark."
"Yes Kreacher. I was wondering if you could sense anything like my cloak or my wand."
"Draco are you alright?" He was asked as the arms that held him turned him around to face Harry.
"Master Draco he did not say but I knows who he is, and you must go see him." Sage said and stomped her foot.
"Buckbeak that stupid Hippogriff?"
"Explain, but I make no promises on staying."
"I heard you were a tiger Mister Potter but no other information was given about your transformation. You are quite impressive I have never seen one so large or have I ever seen one with your coloring. You may return to your seat."
As he got up to leave Draco grabbed his wrist and turned him towards him. "Another one of your Secrets?"
"Better now I will admit that I am still shaken but it will pass now that you are here. So what is this book about my heart?"
"It is from Shacklebolt. He assigned some Aurors to look after me this summer while they tried to round up the remaining Death Eaters. Two of them just turned up dead. They were tortured and the Dark Mark was carved into their chests. One of them was the one assigned to watch over Andromeda and Teddy"
"Harry I am sorry but this is just a lot to process right now you need to give us time."
"Humpf, I didn t think he would bring you here in a towel." Draco said as he yawned and rubbed the sleep from his eyes. "But Granger was here a few minutes ago looking for you. I didn t think you were a morning person Potter."
He had been placing tender kiss across Draco's jaw and had moved down his chest in his attempts to quiet the young man in his arms and it had finally worked as Draco grabbed his head and pulled him back up so he could lay claim to his lips.
"Lord Black I would also like to inform you of the properties that you now own. Besides 12 Grimuald Place you also inherited Black Castle which is in lower Wales and from the Potters you have the Potter Manor and the cottage at Godric s Hollow and the surrounding village. I can show you on a map were they are located and it will only take a drop of your blood to open the wards to you. If you wish I can remain as your personal estate manager for you are now one of the wealthiest wizards in Britain."
"You will note that though you are all housed together that there are separate areas for each house. Your names will be found on the door to rooms and you will find your timetables within as well as your personal affects and a list of privileges. If I hear of any fighting within the common room or your own rooms, you will be receiving detention as well as a loss of house points. That is everything so I will leave to allow you to get settled." Draco watched as his classmates left down their respected hallways to find their rooms, he turned to face Professor Vector again when he heard her call out "Mr. Black the Headmistress would like to see you in her office before your first class tomorrow."
He grabbed Draco's hand and led him through the common room and down a long corridor. "It is easy to get lost down here so just ask call for Kreacher he will show you. He has his own room off of the kitchen. What to show you first." He said as he went through a large set of Oak doors that had silver embellishments of snakes on them. He turned and watched as Draco's eyes widen at the sight of the library. "Each bookcase actually is a door to a separate room on that topic. There are one for each of the subjects taught here and one for some of Salazar's hobbies. I believe that it is actually more extensive then the Library upstairs. There is also a potions lab connected to the room behind the potions bookcase. It is filled with ingredients, some extremely rare that got Severus excited." He watched as Draco perused the shelves pushing some of the bookcases open to reveal the room behind. "Come on I can take you down here whenever you like, but there is more to see." He ushered Draco from the room and continued down the corridor showing him the dueling room, his study, the guest room, a trophy room of sorts, a smaller room of requirement, and then pointing out the hallway that lead to the kitchen behind a tapestry before they came to a set of stone doors. He watched as Draco ran his hands over the doors that were etched with ancient ruins and had numerous carved snakes in them. He hissed and the snakes began to wake under Draco's touch which made the young man jump back and himself laugh.
"Yes, whhhyyyyy….." he never got his question answered because Harry had pushed him into the opening and he was currently sliding down a long tunnel. He landed into a nest of pillows once he reached the bottom. "What the bloody hell was that for you git?" he asked once Harry landed behind him laughing.
"So it is coming to pass. My true heir has come into his powers."
He asked.
"Headmistress?"
He was returning with the book when he saw Salazar moving through the portraits towards the study so he decided to ask "Salazar do you know a common translation charm?"
"Well it looks like you can enter but they have two conditions. You always have to enter with me and I can't leave you down here by yourself yet." Harry said as they passed through the guarded door into the common room where he was introduced to Salazar Slytherin's portrait.
"Silence," he yelled as he drew his wand and approached the two individuals. "What in Merlin is going on here Draco?"
“Hello my Heir I am glad you accepted your Soulmate. You two will need each other for the things to
"You talked your way out of being in Slytherin, Professor Snape would have been proud."
intervene, they would not allow it. I know the troubles and sorrows you have overcome and I am so very
"Well I was hoping that it would not have come up, but yes I would have eventually. I can teach you if you want. Sirius taught me over the summer before fifth year. No one knew and by Christmas with some help from a tutor, I made my first change. Sirius was so proud of me, he was a dog that looked like a Grimm, I took up most of his room and Buckbeack tried to kill me."
"Yes Master Black." Draco watched as Kreacher smiled then disappeared with a crack.
"You are taking eight possible nine classes?"
"So Harry are you ready to answer a few questions?"
"Go ahead Draco."
"Well she seems rather sweet to me." He said as he stroked Nisha s scales and she rubbed her tiny head against his chin.
"Good afternoon students. I am Professor Andromeda Tonks. I will be teaching Alchemy to those of you who are found to have the aptitude for the class. Alchemy is the study of the elements in their most raw form and the power to change and manipulate them. Very few are able to do this and even rarer are they able to do this with more than one element. The circle here represents the elements. The rune for air, water, fire, and earth mark the four cardinal points. I will ask each of you to change into these. They are made from cotton and have never been touched by magic. There are changing rooms towards the back of the hall once everyone is changed we will begin with the seventh years first."
"So were you ever going to tell me about this change?" Draco asked.
"No! She pulled me down the Gryffindor hall to interrogate me then she went to warn me about you and how I shouldn't trust you. Ron came out of his room took one look at me then slammed his door shut and Hermione then said I should try and talk to him. Then she pointed out that it wasn't fair that I took my O.W.L.S. this summer to get into Arithmancy, well I guess she will be surprised that I beat her at Ancient Ruins as well." Harry said as he flopped down upon his bed.
Hogwarts but as a seerer I am tied to the Mistress of Fates as well. I watched and as much as I wanted to
"You killed that in second year?"
"If you had my tutors you would too, besides it is only a calming draught, and I think that a few of our classmates are going to need it today." He said as he looked over to his friends table.
"Draco, leave that alone. It is far more trouble than it is worth and the only reason it is here is for Harry's protection. Now if I didn't know better you have a question for me?"
The meeting with McGonagall went well and his new classes that he wanted were added to his schedule. He had asked to speak to Dumbledore alone and she obliged him. When she left he spoke to Dumbledore s painting and gave him a piece of his mind and then he spoke to the Sorting Hat before he left the office. He never once dropped the glamour he had worn to look like Harry Potter while he was there.
He found his way into Harry's study he did not think anything of it as he looked around. He noticed the snitch that floated in the air and the shelf with Harry's fathers' journals on it. He studied the shimmering cloak that hung on a peg next to the fireplace. When he took it off to wrap it around his body because it smelt like Harry he noticed that he disappeared. He then noticed a wand box on the mantle and went to investigate. He tried to pick it up but it wouldn't move, he even tried to open the lid but it was sealed shut. He went to reach for his wand but was stopped by a voice.
"Thank you Kreacher you may go."
" 'arrrry!"
"Life will be interesting soon. I have and never will abandon you."
"Why did your stupid snake bite me?"
It happened in a second and Draco didn t know what was funnier at that point, the scared look on Weasley s face as Nisha had wrapped herself around Ron s wrist poised to bite or the stunned look on the Gryffindorks behind him.
"Harry what is she talking about," Draco grumbled sleeply into his chest.
"So she is going to help me control this until you get back from class?"
"Are you sure?" he nodded yes and Harry continued on. "So what book did you bring?"
By the time he and Harry returned to their rooms Harry was deep in thought.
"I have every power. I control the wards as does Salazar. We also are able to manipulate Hogwarts structures. Now that he has been claimed the wards will allow Harry to apparate within the school grounds." The surrounding students were shocked at the news that Godric and Salazar had given. He could feel Draco's arms tighten around him as he scanned the room. He watched as both Godric and Salazar reached into the ether and pull out a silver and gold chain and place it around his bowed head. The amulet the hung from the chain was the combined crests of Slytherin and Gryffindor. He watched as his two ancestors began to cross the room and exited the Great Hall.
"And what is that?" he replied as he now got to see the front of him and the tattoo of Marauders that ran across his muscular chest and the two on his toned arms that said Padfoot and Prongs. He couldn t help but think that he was a very attractive man and he realized then that the other feelings he had this summer for Harry Potter were turning into crush on Harrison Corvus Black.
"Everything will be fine I promise. I think you have a class to start."
"For you I would."
"It Still just Harry, Draco, and I am playing at nothing. Lets just say that the truth about a lot of things was revealed to me this summer and for now leave it at that."
"Thank you Salazar."
"Harry we haven't been together for more than a day and you are already trying to get rid of me I'm hurt. Haven't you realized that Malfoy's always get what they want and what I want is you."
"What about all the wandless and non-verbal magic, or how about your grades Harry? Where did you learn all of that? Oh yeah he is an Animagus as well." Hermione politely asked.
He waved bye to his little cousin as he watched him run to sit next to a smiling Headmistress.
"Not a problem Viktor I will see tomorrow no doubt and I will have the elves prepare a room for the two of you."
"Hey Teddy, missed you." He watched as Harry held his precious bundle to his chest. He looked over the boy and watched in amazement as the blue hair slowly grew and turned to match Harry's. "Hey little man I want you to met someone."
His curiosity started to get the best of him so he untangled himself from Harry's arms. He knew that Harry was tired after his ordeal in the Great Hall so it did not surprise him when he fell asleep after their heavy snogging session.
He could not breathe and his whole body was begining to shake. He could tell Draco was having a hard time trying not to attack Ron but Draco was having an even harder time trying to keep him from not losing his temper.
"Yes Headmistress."
"And neither do you Harry. He called me a mudblood if you don t remember and he didn t do anything while his Aunt was carving it into my arm. I can t forgive him that easily."
As Harry expected Fawkes was sitting on a perch in the kitchen while Kreacher was feeding him pieces of bacon.
"No." Godric said forcefully. "He will no longer be manipulated and forced to hide who he is. As my heir he has the right to be true to himself and the others have the right to know the truth as students and faculty of Hogwarts. For in time he will be the Headmaster of this School and no one will deny him his right."
He watched as Draco crawled under the thick comforter on the bed. It was always slightly cooler in his room and he was glad for the thick comforter and cashmere blankets on the bed. He usually had a fire lit in the fireplace but he preferred to let it go out as he slept. Draco held the comforter a loft waiting for him to join him on the bed and when he did he felt the other boy curl on his side and wrap an arm around his waist to pull him in closer. He did not have a nightmare that night which was a blessing for him. He had been haunted by nightmares for months now and it was rare for him to go a night without them.
"Yes Master Black?"
"What's wrong Draco? Do I have something on my face?"
"Maybe one day you will find out."
"You have got to be kidding me. Your clothes only take up half of this room. The other half is completely empty I could help you with that because you could always use more."
questions lil one.”
"Take it off."
"Why? Why didn't you tell me? What does this mean and why if love is so important to you would you block something like this?" he felt hurt and scared everything he had wanted was suddenly stolen from him. Harry was just playing some game with him.
Alexander Harper from Slytherin was claimed by a pale blue light from the water rune.
"Hermione will you Kindly escort the first years to the Great Hall for lunch we will be there shortly."
Harry started to laugh because without Draco's knowing Luna had spelled Luna's over protective brother into Draco's clothes.
should.”
"Yes Ron I do more than I trust your parents right now. Snape never lied to me or tried to manipulate me like Dumbledore. Dumbledore knew about my parents just like yours did. He also manipulated me and tried to play on my insecurities and dreams. I love your family but right now Ron I don't want anything to do with your parents. I need time to forgive them. I was hoping we could still be friends once you got past the changes with me. But I am not changing for you or anyone I am going to be true to myself and if that involves no longer playing dumb so others can feel like they are helping me or better than me so be it." He said as he pushed away from the table. "I am sorry for hurting your feelings but I cannot be Harry Potter any more, he was an act. I acted the way I thought I was supposed to but that is not me."
He didn't know what to say to that so he just ran his hand done her smooth scales noticing that they felt like silk. He continued to ponder the new information that he had received as Harry wandered out of the bathroom dressed in his school robes. He rose from the bed with Nisha securely wrapped around his arm to the outstretched arms of Harry.
“I believe some teachings have been forgotten… many magical familiars will seek their masters out. I do
"It is nice to finally meet the real you Harry." He watched Luna say as she came up and wrapped her arms around Harry. He watched as Harry bent down and kissed the lithe girl on the forehead.
"What do you mean your Heir?" McGonagall asked.
He had started to drift off to sleep when the shuffling of feet grabbed his attention to someone's approach. Not knowing who it was as Draco was supposed to be in class he decided to feign sleeping. It surprised him when Hermione sat down next to his head and began petting his fur.
"That is for me to know for the time being, if you would excuse me I have a meeting with Headmistress McGonagall before class."
Draco looked at Harry and he could feel the hurt evaporate from his heart but he saw pain flash across Harry's eyes, what was going to come next was something that was causing him pain. "I grew up in a home where I was called a freak because of my magic. I was no better than a house elf, I cooked and cleaned and did all of the chores from a very young age. I was mental abused by my Aunt and Uncle and physically by my cousin for a time. I lived in a cupboard for the first ten years I was there. They thought guys who liked blokes were disgusting and were freaks. I didn't know how to handle the feelings that I had for you and after reading my fathers' journal I came to accept them. I am sorry for not telling you, but I wanted you to like me for who I am not because I am the Savior or because of some bond. I have admired you for many years and I know who you are, I can see behind the masks you so carefully construct for yourself. Draco mo chorí means my heart because that is what you are to me. It may be too early to tell you this but I do love you and I am sorry for hiding this from you." Harry sat there as Draco watched him run his hand through his hair and then burry his face in them. He watched as Harry waved his hand and whispered "Expecto Patronum." Instead of the silver stag Draco was expecting a massive dragon began to fill the room.
Draco watched as the hat was placed on Harry s head and a glamour fell away from him in a rippling affect. More shocked gasp fell from the rooms occupants as the hat was overheard saying to him if he was going to start a new he should not hide behind the false glamour placed upon him from years ago. The new Harry was revealed, his hair was no longer unruly and it fell in soft waves to his shoulders, a snake was seen wrapped around his neck with its head whispering into his ear and yet the most striking change was his eyes. No longer were they the emerald green and hidden behind glasses but they now were a storm grey. Draco drank in the various changes of his once rival and waited for the hat to announce the inevitable placement in Gryffindor.
"Whats up with him?"
"I know Draco." Draco watched as Harry snapped his fingers and the letter went up in flames. "I'm sorry for how I was acting earlier I hope your happy that you can see Severus since I know he was your Godfather. If anything I said makes you uncomfortable just let me know and I will keep my distance."
"I have sir but I felt that it would be wise to keep some of your things up here for appearance and Mister Draco's things needed putting away before they wrinkled as always I serve the noble house of Black."
Draco pulled out his Potions text book and looked at the potions in question. He noticed that Harry had already gone to the supply cupboard, he assumed that he took his book with him since it wasn t lying on his work station. After choosing the Draught of Living Death he too went to get his ingredients. Upon returning to his work station he watched as Harry was already adding ingredients to his caldron.
There was a half-hour left of class as he watched Harry bottle up his potion and placed it on Slughorn s desk, he too was just finishing his and he noticed that Granger didn t look too far behind. Harry was just returning to their table as he started to bottle up his potion to turn in. He noticed that not only was Harry grabbing the remainder of his ingredients up but was picking up his as well and then went to return them to the supply cupboard as he took his own potion up to Slughorn.
"Harry and I am not but I have to meet McGonagall before our first class and I wanted to eat before that."
"Thank you Professor." He said as he turned to return to his seat but stopped when he watched Harry clean their work stations with a wave of his hand then put their supplies into their individual school bags and pick up his school bag to give to him.
"What do you think you know Pans?"
"Well you are a Black by blood I believe." He said as he came out of the closet with grey silk sleep pants on. "I hope you don't mind but I don't like wearing a shirt to bed. I have a few injuries that left some scars and I don't like how they rub."
This is going to be a very interesting year he thought as he grabbed his bag and headed to the Great Hall for lunch.
"Brilliant. Now Lily Evans I would like to introduce you to Severus Snape, Potions Master. Severus if you would please pretend to be a Gryffindor for a moment I feel you would lose some of your gloom. With that said I shall leave the two of you, I have classes tomorrow." Harry turned and left to go to his bedroom. He could hear Lily behind him call Severus s name and he took a quick peek behind him and saw that she had invaded his portrait and was in the mist of giving him a piece of her mind and Severus was cowering in the corner. He hoped they would be happy, they deserved it.
"Master Draco there is someone to see you in the entry way," the little house elf had told him.
before he entered. What he saw almost took his breath away. Their standing in front of him was a tall
He almost took out a few first years as he ran out of the girls bathroom on the first floor. As he entered Greenhouse seven he noticed that many of the occupants were already pairing up. Draco was already standing next to Pansy as he made his way over to the tables.
"So I think I am going to skip classes for the rest of the week, I can help you keep up if you would like to join me?"
"Fine but I'm not happy" He said as he rolled of Harry.
"There is much that has been forgotten since our time. Hogwarts has fallen asleep and much has been lost. Lady Ravenclaw was a great Seer once and a seeker of knowledge. The foretold that a time will come when the castle will wake again after a time of much death. An Heir will arise from two houses, the Master of Death will come forward to claim his right and peace amongst wizards and witches will return once the followers of the false heir are defeated. Harrison Corvus Black is the Heir. There is more to the prophecy but I will not tell it in its full until the Lady Ravenclaw awakes and confronts her heir. For there must not be any foreshadowing on a bond that must be acknowledged and this is required before the rest is known." Salazar said.
"Yes Master Black?"
"Hello Draco."
"Shut it Hermione, you keep telling me that I should accept him for who he is and that he had his reasons for lying to us but this is just ridiculous. Look at him he is a freak."
"Congratulations Miss Jones you may go sit over there with Headmistress McGonagall." Andromeda said as she handed back her wand.
Draco watched the conversation between the house elf and his master. He caught himself starring at Harry. He had grown since the last he saw him, he was now the same height as himself. He noticed that he was broader in the shoulders as he removed his robes and handed them to the elf. When he turned around and their eyes locked he felt he was looking into an oncoming storm his eyes were so grey and alive.
"You have my word as a Malfoy I will keep your secret as I am still in debt to you for saving my life. Thank you for that and for what you did for my mother and me with the trails. Does these secret accommodations have anything to do with the girl's bathroom on the second floor?"
She hissed into his ear as she settled herself back around his neck with her tail wrapped around his arm.
He began to wonder about his place after the death of both Sirius and Dumbledore but it wasn t until his seventeenth birthday that things really changed again. He woke up in agonizing pain. His whole body glowed from the magic coursing through it and then he felt his bones break and grow. His hair lengthened and lost the unruliness. He felt the magic in his body grow and expand it was painful and he nearly died. He woke the following morning and crawled his way to the bathroom and looked in the mirror what he say confused him. His hair was still black but fell to his shoulders in waves. He now stood at least six foot one and his shoulders were broader. The biggest change he noticed was his eyes were no longer emerald green but were the color of dark grey storm clouds. In his panic he threw up a glamour that changed him back to his original appearance and hid the changes from his friends.
She began to stand up but he had bit her robs and pulled her down into her side. He liked the laugh that she had rang out when she fell into him he had truly missed his friend and he began to purr when she started to scratch behind his ears.
"I'm not sure but I have an idea. We still have time to go back to sleep."
"Well that is helpful. You no longer have to call for Kreacher and you didn't even tell them about your ring." Draco said as he stretched out nest to him on the bed. They were still in the cotton drawstring pants and had forgotten their rooms in the Great Hall.
"Could you obtain our robes from the Great Hall and prepare us a light lunch."
"Lets see I had private tutoring staring fourth year from a tutor that I cannot name so do not ask. Starting sixth year Snape started tutoring me along with his Occulmency lessons. The non-verbal magic I could do since sixth year and I started the wandless that year as well but now it is effortless since my wizarding inheritance took effect. I have been an Animagus since Christmas of fifth year, my father taught me over that summer and I made my first complete change then. He was really proud of me. As for my grades, I have always succeeded in our classes but I talked most of the teachers to down play it for my safety and for other reasons. I think that covers all your questions Hermione anything else?"
