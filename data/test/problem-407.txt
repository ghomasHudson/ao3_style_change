“What else would you expect from the offspring of Death Eaters?” Iona declared. “You know as soon as that thing’s born Harry will get shot of them both.”
After his only friends had left, Hogwarts had seemed all the more horribly empty for Draco. He had ended up spending most of his free time down in the Potions dungeons with Severus. Draco’s beta godfather had been temporarily looking after the omega. This was due to Draco’s aunt Bellatrix having been injured that year during a dangerous ritual that Draco suspected had been intended to bring back the Dark Lord.
“Merry Christmas,” Nadia beamed, nodding goodbye as she continued down the corridor with the trolley. The compartment door slid open a moment later as Draco poked his head out.
“You see, Harry?”  Draco murmurs as if he just read Harry’s thoughts on the matter.  “How could I put you and the children through that?  What right do I have?”
“Saving you.”  He returns evenly, trying to give Malfoy his most sincere look.  Hoping to inspire some measure of confidence.  This will go a lot easier if Malfoy goes along with the plan.  “If you’ll let me.”
engraved on the lid.  Medieval in make.  He doubts anyone has laid eyes on it since his great-great-grandfather redid the hall.  He concentrates on wrapping heat around his chest.  Concentrating on how he wants it to fix everything, every horrific thing that has happened here.  Everything dark and foul remaining.  It may very well be the last thing he does.  Releasing a spout of flame to encompass the core fully with the last of his strength and determination.
“No – I mean – I’m up for it.  Let’s go.”  Harry agrees eagerly, getting up as Draco spells the lights off with a flick of his wand.  There is an instant where he glimpses the man reflected by the streetlights outside and the dim light of lab behind the door.  Pale hair catching the glow like starlight.
“What about them?”  Astoria challenges, giving him a droll expression.  “I promise you they have their own lives to focus on.”
“I did.”  Ron accedes, shaking his head again slightly.  Probably at himself.  “I – Hermione suggested we try dinner again.  Your lot and mine.  At our house?”
“Or you’ll be mine.”  Draco automatically flips it.  But frowns, as he remembers an important someone.  “What about Olta?”
Wigbins Primary is a quaint looking three-story building from the outside.  Inside holds a large entry way with two main floos.  The wooden floors are shiny and scuffed by the hundred fifty or so students.  Technically, the boys are the only two enrolled, but Lily will go next year.  The nursery school she attends located only a block away.  The first time he joined Harry in picking them up was like a bizarre, miniature Hogwarts reunion.  Apparently, a good amount of people in their year produced children around the boys’ age.
“Bloody fucking hell.”  Bill swears.  Fleur rests a hand on his shoulder.  George’s mischievous expression immediately falls, eyes widening in disbelief.  The others in the room visibly tense.  Molly sways once where she is standing in the kitchen and walks over to hold the back of her husband’s chair.
“I thought I just thanked you for that exact thing and I think it’s unavoidable at this point.  Considering you’re living with them.  I’m certain that’s what Harry
It's been maybe six years since he last went on holiday.  The last one was a Weasley family camping trip.  Al was a little over one at the time and Jamie was three.  He wouldn't exactly call that holiday relaxing.  It was fun, sure, but relaxing – not at all.  The whole thing was focused on the kids and family bonding and all that.  He liked that bit, but Ginny was tense the entire time. She had had a row with Molly before they left; and Harry was more often on the receiving end of Gin's frustration at the end of each day.  It got to the point he was avoiding being alone with her and then Ginny was mad at him for that and
He excuses himself a minute later.  Going to the hallway to compose himself.  Never in his wildest flights of fancy did he believe Ginevra would give her blessing in so direct a fashion.  He finds Harry, tray in hand and another floating beside him, walking toward Draco down the hallway.  His boyfriend smiles widely when he sees him.  Hands him a cheese toastie and kisses him on the cheek in a fluid motion.  Walking past him into the sitting room with the rest of their lunch.
“He doesn’t want to show favoritism.”  Clearwater mock-whispers to her companions.  Smile cheeky.  She reminded him of Tonks at times like these.  It was why he put up with her.  That, and her good work as an auror.
“They do.  Hopefully, all in one piece.”  Harry remarks.  Thinking of the beginning of the week.  His three sprogs all set with their little backpacks for a week-long stay with their mum.  He hugged and kissed them all goodbye as Ginny waited to take them into the cottage.  Directing them sternly to behave and listen to Mummy.  “Have you given any more thought about what I asked you the other day?”  He prompts his boyfriend.
“I appreciate you trying here, Ron, but we don’t have to talk about Draco if you don’t want.”  He offers, giving his friend an out if this is too much.
“Do you get along with his children?  His middle one is in Gabby’s class.  He talks a lot, but he seems sweet.”
Dad scoffs loudly with a disdainful “Come off it!” and Aunt Hermione murmurs lowly in a frustrated tone.
“Just nevermind, Harry.”  Draco responds despondently covering his face with his hands.  Body tense.  “I apologize for bringing it up.”
Harry just chuckles.  “I had to try.”  His boyfriend responds, raising his hands in surrender.  “Seriously though, thank you so much for looking after them.  I know they can be naughty little shits.”
“I am really not enjoying how much Viktor Krum played into a lot of our first kisses.”  Harry remarks, scratching at the back of his neck.  “He's a nice bloke and a talented quidditch player - don’t get me wrong - but really?  Him?”
good at French kissing so you’re welcome.”  Pansy defends, but then gives a swift look to her husband, frowning slightly.  “Sorry, darling.  I realize that was maybe a tad insensitive.”
“Possibly ruining it further.”  He finishes his thought.  Feeling some slight vindication at finishing his thought.
“It can be intense then.”  He comments.  Mind going over those first few months with Draco.  The infatuation becoming love.
“I’m sorry, Harry.”  They hear Teddy apologize in the bedroom over.  “I didn’t mean to make her cry.”
“I was sealing his medicinal potion in a carrier box for him.  We were short-staffed that day, so I helped reception.”
He once heard orgasming described as a marathon to jump off a cliff.  Draco had always thought that sounded odd even after he had had a few of them with other blokes.  But he knows what it means now.  Everything is tensed up in him, a coil ready to spring, body working as hard as Harry’s when his boyfriend comes.  Hole clenching spasmodically and pushing Draco over the edge.  It is like the whoosh of wind when first taking flight intensified tenfold into euphoria.
Draco is in the walk-in master closet.  Checking what clothing is here.  It seems like half his wardrobe has migrated to Grimmauld.  He would say the same of Harry’s if his was not a fraction of Draco’s.  It was hardly his fault that he had good taste in clothing.  It was fortunate that Harry accepted the occasional clothing item Draco bought for him.
“I’m willing to try.”  Harry responds.  It was far from the first time he had volunteered for a new treatment after all.  There had been mixed results for him in the past, but he would do a lot to improve use of the leg.  A good part of why he continued coming to this clinic, beyond meeting his own needs, was to add to the ongoing research they were doing to help others.  The Mercury Clinic had already improved the lives of people in the magical and non-magical populations.  It was inspiring to be a part of that work.
She’s a nice house elf.  Her ears are shorter than Kreacher’s but no less pointy.  Whenever they visit, she has on a new pastel colored dress with a little patterned apron over it and neat little shoes that match.  She even shows them her room after Lily asks where she lives.  It is on the main floor beside the other bathroom and Draco’s bedroom.  Scaled to her size.  All the furniture clearly meant for a small person’s use like a dollhouse just big enough for Lily.  They tell her how pretty her room is, and the elf seems incredibly pleased by the compliment.
“They told me it was unlikely to be successful considering the shards exposure to my hip and everything.  That’s why they went for the implants to work as a counter-curse.”  Harry explains with a shrug.  It had been a simple decision for him to make at the time.  Wanting to get to recovery as quick as possible for work. “And, I still had use of the leg.”
“I know you're mocking her, but the two of you have very similar taste palettes.”  Draco intones, expression teasing.
four weeks out of the year, Gin.  The weekends you get them don’t count toward that.  You have to figure another week out.”  He prods.
It is a familiar story.  How they met Simone where they all worked at the club.  How they came to be friends.  The three of them matured a lot in those initial years.  Draco is well aware of how much change he underwent.  He was such a broken person back then.  His experiences in Paris with his friends, finally learning who he was and who he wanted to be.  They all became the people they were meant to be.
.”  His partner responds, drawing himself to his full height as he looks down at Draco.  Wings briefly expanding and folding back as they settle through his cloak.
He is dropping Lily off at nursery school, making his usual assurances that either he or Uncle Ron will pick her up promptly at the end of the day, when it hits him like a stampeding hippogriff.  There was someone he had thought of, however fleetingly, when telling Al what sort of person he would marry.  Someone he's thought of a lot lately.
He barks out a laugh at the idea.  How absurd.  “Are you sure it wasn’t the other way around?”  He retorts.
“How’d you like dinner, sprog?”  Dad asks cheerily, in an especially good mood tonight.  Probably because of the pizza.
It seems like Harry wants to laugh at that by the way his eyebrows shoot up and the corner of his mouth crooks.  Expression an unusual combination of incredulous and passionate.  The other man shakes his head.  “No, here, let me.”  He says, taking Draco’s hand and guiding it down where they are connected.  “I’m just past that ring of muscle there.  That’s what might hurt.  Are you sure I don’t need to pull out?  Maybe we need to stretch you more?”
It falls to him, strangely enough, to take James to the diagnostician.  A pediatric healer.  Harry was called in last minute on an emergency.  Draco just told him to go.  He can handle this one appointment.
Dad crooks his mouth at Draco, then turns back to them.  “That boy who told you that, Jamie, he probably said that because people know now that I’m with Draco.”
“Draco,” Harry speaks his name slowly, walking toward him and tossing the apple core into the trash can.  “They all think you live here anyways.”
“Not really.”  The man notes, seeming far off by the way he looks over the garden.  “I try not to think about the past.  I get stuck . . . in my head when I do, hm . . ."  If Draco means to trail off on his thought, Harry is not sure.  Sometimes he did that.  Especially if they'd been drinking.
He leverages himself upward, resting back on his elbows.  Forcing himself to watch Potter kissing him so intimately.  Seeing that this is real.  It is the wrong decision.  Potter looks much too confident, focused on his work.  Dark hair framing his face where it is coming loose from the tie he had used to keep it out of his face.
His other cousins are around playing, Al and Lily along with them.  Well, everyone except Freddie who is with Nan writing an apology letter to the person he pranked.  Jamie decides it’s a good time to pop out on the porch and rub elbows with the old men.
“I’m off after that week.  I can take them then for a while.”  Ginevra states, quill stuck behind her ear as she flips through her schedule book.  “It’s just, I know I have some charity thing for the team in April when I’d usually have them.”
Harry is a bit too old now to write it off as missing a friend.  The twist in his stomach when Draco startles to laugh like a quick bark.  A trumpet of joy to his ears.  How endearing he finds it when Draco mocks him in such a dry, teasing manner that leaves Harry chuckling for days.  Harry thought he had forgotten that feeling – or something close to it.  Locked it up safe in a vault at the back of his mind to look through when nostalgic.  That old feeling has a beginning and an end like all the fairy tales he reads his children.
Draco looks despairing for a second before he drags the blanket over his head.  “You’ll hate me.”  He bemoans tucking his legs underneath and curling in on himself.
The shed is not all that big.  They never even magically expanded it.  There are some shelves on the wall that used to contain tools he had for taking care of the house.  These days, Ginny has odds and ends in here.  Broken bits of pottery and gardening tools.  His motorbike is covered by a tarp and does admittedly take up a significant amount of available space.  He hesitates for a second before removing the tarp.  He has not had a proper look at the bike in years.
It's fairly dialogue and plot heavy.  Sort of interlude-ish.  Shockingly, the next chapter will feature Harry and Draco abroad.  As always, I own nothing except for plots.
The alternative title of this chapter is Narcissa.  This was a fun one to write.  It isn't the holiday season yet but I wanted to include a chapter like this.  There is something about holiday based fics.  I'm a sucker for those across all fandoms.  I know nothing about yule and have completely made everything up.
Greg fidgets in his seat.  Expression suddenly sheepish.  “Khady is the most wonderful woman in the world.  She’s pretty, smart, and an amazing baker to boot.  She came to this country with nothing but her little sister and built so much for them.  I could never do that.  I’m a lucky man that she even tolerates me - let alone married me.”
“Kitchen flirt.”  Draco accuses bantering back.  Harry laughs, ducking in to kiss him.  The sun is setting and the overhead lights in the kitchen cast them in a homey glow.  He knows this is part of infatuation – this clinginess.  But it is fun being here, and it feels right.  Harry has not felt anything close to this way in ages and it is addicting.  Draco is solid and here for him.
“Severus, why are you here?”  He adds.  This figure is coherent, not the wretched attempt at his aunt earlier.  He may be able to get answers from him.  “I'm trapped in the manor.  Father warned me the manor's foundational magic was malfunctioning, but I was unable to disrupt the curse long enough after I entered.  I need to access the core.”
Al looks up at him with a serious expression.  Green eyes magnified by his glasses.  “We had to practice maths and I don’t like subtraction as much as adding.”
“You’ve been distracted.”  Hermione observes from her spot on the patio bench next to Harry.  The children are playing on the playset in the Granger-Weasley’s backyard as they sip wine and watch – like good parents.
He would be less thrilled by their frankness with Harry if he were not so full of excellent wine and food.  Merlin, he missed this place.  There was no better food any where else in the world so far as he was concerned.  Everything here was absolute magic.
The day he divorced Ginny was another sunny day several years later.  They signed the papers with their solicitors present.  Copies of their divorce prepared for them both for their records.  It was all very civil.  The paparazzi was banned from the floor they were on, but they still had to wade through flash bulbs going off at them on the way into the registry department.  He remembers gritting his teeth through it all.  Willing his expression distant and unengaging.
If Robards was summoning him now, it was at least a level three concern.  As a deputy head of the department, he was consulted on a variety of issues categorized due to threat level.  Level five being the maximum, where the ministry itself and/or magical society was at risk of imminent doom.  There were four deputy heads of the auror department plus head auror Robards.  Three of them were needed to make official decisions.
“You’re gorgeous this way, you know.”  Harry compliments breathlessly as Draco feels the head of his boyfriend’s cock at his entrance.  The muscles of his stomach jump as the man lowers himself and slowly presses in.  “I’m so lucky to be with you.”
“French people can't play quidditch!” Al complains loudly causing Lily to giggle madly.  Shaking her head repeating, “No, no, no,” like Nan.
“Not at present.”  Draco denies.  Jamie thinks that's a shame.  He wants to breathe fire when he grows up.  More adults should.  It does pique his interest enough to ask the only question he cares about.
He does remember Ginny standing at the door yelling at him for being an idiot and to come inside while he kicked the starter until the bike roared to life.  Of course, this was late in the evening and quite dark out.  He didn't even manage flight which was fortunate all things considered.  Hitting the gas and driving directly into the solid trunk of a tree at the end of their drive.  He does not remember that part though.  Only blackness and then waking on the ground.  A slick substance coating his face which he figured out was blood after he spat some of it out.
“I would be thrilled to host the both of you.”  Simone offers.  “Any time, really.  I owe Draco about five years of my share of the rent.”
Harry doubts that very much.  Narcissa was always precise with her words.  They were as much her shield as her dagger.
“Ooh.  Say it again.”  Harry teases with an ornery grin.  He wins either way.  His boyfriend will repeat his name or get flustered.  Draco rolls his eyes, ears turning pink.  Flustered, then.  Harry slides his thumb over an ear from where his hand is in Draco’s hair.  Is it weird to find another man’s ears attractive?  Is this a new kink?
“I don’t like trying to use the muggle money here.  It makes no sense.”  Malfoy remarks with a shake of his head, arranging his paper napkin neatly on his lap.
“Auror Potter, we will be seeking statements from the three individuals you named.  One of our staff will contact you afterward and inform you of our decision.  Please remain here in the meantime.”
Harry furrows his brow.  Confused.  “We’ll figure it out.”  He attempts to reassure his boyfriend.  Mentally reviewing what he discussed with the auditor.  Nothing was amiss so far as he knew.  There is a cursory knock at the door and the guard opens it.  Harry spies two aurors – not from his own squad of course – behind the guard.
He frowns, turning his attention back to his meal.  “It was nice for a short while, but neither of us were much cut out for it I think.”  He allows with a sigh.  “Leastways I wasn’t.”
They are not even back at Grimmauld long when it becomes obvious something is amiss.  The children typically ran off to the playroom or the garden first thing.  Unwinding after school.  Lily and Albus scamper upstairs, but James remains with Draco and Harry in the sitting room.  Drawing the tip of his toe in a line back and forth across the carpet.  Draco frowns slightly at that, it was new carpet after all.
, Draco.”  Harry praises, using the hand not gripping Draco’s hair to pet his boyfriend's face.  Wiping tears away from his eyes.  “All this just for me?”
“I like my stuff.”  Harry defends automatically.  This had been a frequent disagreement of late.  “Is that so wrong?”
He catches himself in the mirror one morning as he's shaving, Jamie and Al at his side brushing their teeth, and realizes it has been nearly three months.  The experiment will be over soon, and he will no longer be seeing Draco.  All their lunches, their walks, their talks.  Joking and laughing with Draco and his small, barely there smiles.
“Are you alright? Sorry they’re barmy,” Harry whispered as Draco tried not to obviously let out a shiver.
“We bitching about Harry’s fan club again?” Seamus asked enthusiastically as Harry rolled his eyes. The others liked to give him grief but it wasn’t Harry’s fault he was the subject of so much attention. He guessed it helped that after presenting alpha, Harry had filled out nicely and grown into his adolescent lankiness. He now stood tall and broad shouldered with thick black hair, green eyes and coffee coloured skin.
“Well,” Harry grinned, “this is going to make it a lot easier to remember birthdays in our household.”
Draco had clutched the handmade garment closely to his face, he could clearly scent the faint fragrance of another omega’s touch and it was oddly comforting. Molly Weasley smelled like rosemary and sea salt and it made Draco amusingly think of Sunday roasts.
“I’ll give you a moment,” Olive whispered, patting Harry on the shoulder before getting up from the sofa and disappearing quietly down the stairs. Somewhere in the background Harry registered the bluebird trilling again.
Harry readily obliged, steadying Draco’s waist with his fingers whilst his thumbs worked out whirled knots with deep, circular motions.
“Okay,” Draco replied quietly, but he lifted his head up enough just to send Harry a small reassuring smile.
“Right then,” Harry said, “How about a tree?” He focussed on an empty patch before suddenly a large dark spruce appeared, towering over them.
“Fuck,” Harry swore, surging up to pull Draco into a deep, urgent kiss. He helped the omega tip forwards, lining up his entrance with Harry’s cock before allowing Draco to set the pace. Draco’s face tightened then went blissfully lax as he sheathed himself on Harry’s dick. Harry lay back against the rough wood, staring up at the angelic omega. Draco opened his grey eyes, locking with Harry’s before giving him a bright, adoring smile.
When finally their daughter was brought into the world, Draco was close to unconscious and Harry had to crawl up onto the bed so as to support both his omega and the wailing pink baby in his arms.
“Like I was saying,” Remus continued, “you could authorise him to take his inheritance out of that and instead open a more accessible account at Gringotts. Then all you would need is to sign once on an annual release form and Draco could do whatever he wanted with his money. Or, for a small fee, you can extend the financial freedom to last five or ten years.”
Draco keened beneath him, cool fingers coming up to grip at Harry’s biceps, tugging him even closer. Harry grinned as Draco sat up on his haunches, angling his head so as to place a kiss on Harry’s cheek, before rubbing their faces together.
“Of course,” Harry nodded, “by the time I’m finished, everything in the house will be baby safe, or at least baby proofed.”
“I’m not,” Harry replied, “sorry you were misinformed. I just came to celebrate my friend’s birthday.”
“I’m glad,” Harry smiled softly, crawling over to rest against the side of the tub and drawing his husband and baby back against him. Draco sighed serenely as Harry pressed a loving kiss to the top of his scalp.
Draco smiled again, his posture relaxing as his nose wrinkled up like Harry had seen it do when he was relaxed and laughing with Katie and Hermione.
Eventually, after ten more minutes of twists and turns they emerged out into a large clearing. In the middle was a Christmas tree, but this one was completely draped in all different coloured lights, glittery tinsel, hanging baubles and, amusingly enough, a rather harangued looking fairy sat on the very top of it instructing winners to only take one present per person.
Draco glanced back in surprise to realise that the party had been set up just by the familiar scenery of the photograph Sirius had given him. There was a thick trunked oak tree and the Great Lake was sparkling in the background.
Harry wondered absently if he should shave? His stubble was starting to cross the line into beard territory and his hair was also getting a little long and erratic. Upon hearing the curtain move behind him, Harry turned round to come face to face with a very nervous looking Draco.
“I’m sure you’re a real catch,” Harry smiled placatingly, glancing down the corridor and hoping he could leave soon.
“Draco, I’m really fucking sorry,” Harry murmured, reaching out to stroke a finger cautiously down the younger boy’s cold cheek. “Are you okay? I didn’t mean to trigger…” Harry trailed off as Draco let out an embarrassed whimper. What the hell was Harry going to think of him now? There was a running joke about slutty omegas slicking up at the drop of a hat for any alpha who so much as looked at them.
Draco giggled, feeling absolutely wonderful. With a slight pang of regret he wondered if all these people would be coming here again next year? Draco probably wouldn’t be invited then, no longer being Harry’s responsibility. He shoved the thought to the back of his mind and took a deep breath, the air smelled of peppermint and roasted chestnuts and right now, Harry was holding his hand.
,” Harry snarled as Smith’s shit eating grin dissolved into panic. Harry tugged Draco against his chest as the alpha raised his wand and sent Smith flying backwards, landing in a sprawled heap on the snowy path.
Harry grimaced, he had heard of the crazed werewolf who fought on Voldemort’s side during the War. He wanted to snap at Snape again but caught Remus giving him an almost imperceptible shake of his head.
For a moment, Draco revelled in the wondrous fact that he could say no, that he knew with certainty that Harry would listen and go sleep on the sofa. However, Draco didn’t want that at all so instead he smiled, bringing his hand up to Harry’s cheek and nodding.
Harry gave her a grim smile. During his time at Hogwarts, several of his admirers had gone out of their way to try and send Harry love potion infused chocolates or scent fixators, hoping to secure some sort of claiming bite.
Despite having put away a sizeable portion of chips back at the pub, Harry still felt ravenous come dinner time. Luckily, the house elves had cooked up a veritable feast. Harry was pleased that Draco’s appetite had come back in full force and he watched with amusement as Katie helped pile the omega’s plate with vegetarian cottage pie and boiled carrots.
“Did you notice though? No bond bite,” a voice came from the kitchen. Draco tiptoed a little closer and peeked through the gap. He could see a rather stern looking older woman that Ron had mentioned was his great aunt Muriel. She was chatting to another couple of ladies all sat round the dining table.
“Just for an assistant’s role,” Draco explained hurriedly, “I could do most of the training at home, only going into the apothecary a few times a month.”
“I didn’t want her to die,” Snap croaked out, his voice slightly hoarse. “I would have done anything to save her. Hate me all you want Remus and I know you and that ungrateful yob Black
“No,” Draco groaned, tipping over on the bed and rolling into as much of a foetal ball as was possible whilst pregnant.
“That’s dumb,” Harry retorted as Draco’s eyes widened and his lips pursed as if trying to hide a smile. “What kind of clothes would you want to wear?” Harry asked, sitting down on the rocking chair and waving his fingers to set the kettle to boil. Draco let out a small gasp at the effortless show of wandless magic .
“Sirius, this one’s for you from me and Draco,” Harry was reading the labels of the various gifts and distributing to the other men.
“That’s better,” Harry declared, giving Draco a small wink before summoning a very wizened looking house elf.
After Harry had rearranged the furniture in the room to how Draco wanted it, the other boy’s scent had turned nervous again. Harry tried to figure out why, surely the omega knew that Harry was going to leave for his own dorm and wouldn’t try anything with him?
Harry tried to imagine a tiny pregnant Draco in the middle of the Weasley kitchen, surrounded by giant red headed alphas and betas. At least Molly was an omega, perhaps it might actually help Draco to speak to someone who had been through omega pregnancy before.
“Won’t mind that I’ve got a pregnant omega back home?” Harry asked drily, hoping his voice sounded as unimpressed as he felt.
“I brought mince pies,” Severus announced smugly, holding out the silver, cling filmed platter as Draco let out a hiccoughed giggle.
Harry stared silently down at Draco’s sleeping form. The omega was still unconscious, although Madam Pomfrey had said that was nothing to worry about as she had given him an I.V. of some kind of modified calming draught in order to allow her to complete the necessary scans.
going to think? First you let him keep the baby, then you’ve been practically glued to his side, then you nearly killed that Eighth Year alpha who made a lewd comment about him in the corridor the other day and…and now you’re saying you might invite him to live with you? You’re messing with the boy’s head Harry, his omega hormones are already going to be confusing all his senses. You don’t need to take responsibility like this…you didn’t fuck him.”
it,” Draco stated firmly, licking urgently across Harry’s lips as the alpha let out a surprised moan. “I love you, you silly, wonderful, man.”
Harry winced as Ron pulled a sympathetic face. “She is right mate, it’s pretty bloody weird. I mean, what are you gonna do? You’ll have a kid!”
“I do,” Olive replied proudly. “I graduated from the School of Magical Fashion Design in Lisbon before coming back to England and opening this boutique. My great aunt Dotty left me and my sister some money you see.”
“And I know if your mum was here she’d be so proud of you and want to take you somewhere nice,” Harry continued as Draco’s heart constricted. “Oh wow, Draco, look.”
was me attempting to be honourable.” Harry paused, “But I can assure you Draco, everything I’ve felt since then has been because I want you, not just our child, but you as well. I would never offer to bite someone out of duty, you’re forgetting who raised me.” Harry grinned at Draco, whose previously shuttered off expression seemed to be opening up to something resembling wary hopefulness.
“Bloody hell, there’s Neville, Hannah and Luna!” Seamus laughed as he pointed up ahead to where the three other Gaedere students were just coming onto the path. “What’s Nev doing?”
Another effect of the bond that was starting to materialise was that Harry could sense Draco’s emotional state, even more than he normally could from scents. Despite still being unconscious, Harry knew that Draco was feeling safe and satisfied. Harry wondered just how far the bond would go, if he would be able to sense if his omega was suffering from a nightmare or even a slight pang of discomfort. The idea pleased Harry greatly, that he might always be able to make sure his partner was happy and untroubled.
Draco smiled and rubbed his belly with his free hand, he didn’t mind how big his stomach had grown. In fact he was pretty sure he was going to miss his bump when it was gone. However, he was rather desperate to meet his baby and be able to see his feet again. It had got to the rather embarrassing point of having to ask Harry to help Draco put underwear on. Then again, the alpha certainly hadn’t seemed to mind, although often the underwear came straight off again as soon as it had gone on.
“Don’t get me wrong,” Damien interrupted, pushing himself away from the way and suddenly affecting a shy attitude, nervously tugging at the hem of his shirt so the neckline lowered to reveal more of his pale pink chest.
Draco felt himself start to shake with nerves and adrenalin as Luna called out for the others to start helping them. Draco could hear Ron swearing loudly before Hermione rushed over with a very diplomatically controlled expression, clearly not wanting to alarm Draco futher.
“Merlin, you’re so wet,” Harry gasped delightedly as slick ran down his shaft in waves of sweet honeydew. “So wet for me sweetheart.”
“Oh fuck,” Harry stated bluntly as it became horribly apparent what was happening. Even though Harry didn’t have a clear picture, given that Draco’s bump was in the way, he could clearly guess that Draco was pleasuring himself. The omega’s breath was coming in small, damp starts, punctuated by stuttered whines and his arm was jerking erratically. “Oh fuck, sweetheart, wait. I’ll leave,” Harry said urgently, trying to move as Draco tipped to one side and let out an upset noise.
“That’s no problem,” Harry replied, casting a spell that opened up one of the kingsize sheets and domed it upwards like a parachute.
“Like, I’m sure Gabby or Colum or anyone else at club you think is a bit of alright won’t mind,” Ron stated.
“And you,” Ginny sighed, turning back to Harry, “go find Draco and explain. If it goes badly just send a patronus and I’ll come and back you up okay?”
Snape inhaled sharply and Harry could see his bony fingers tensing as his hands clutched together. At some point, the beetles must have flown off, for the other man’s lap appeared bare again, clad in thick, almost dusty, robes.
“Ah,” Harry winced guiltily. “Um, that’s actually another thing I haven’t mentioned. Severus Snape is Draco’s godfather.”
“Nngh!” Draco let out another groan, he was clearly attempting to touch himself again and was close to slipping out of Harry’s hold. Harry winced as he lowered the younger boy carefully to the ground, hoping the cold of the flagstones might help abate his fever. Harry sat down behind Draco, bracketing him between his thighs to ensure the omega didn’t just fall backwards and hit his head.
“Yeah,” Harry grinned sheepishly, “Mione and Luna helped me with the charm work – oh hey, watch this,” Harry leaned in and whispered something to the fondant dragons before they zoomed up to the very top tier and blew fiery breaths across the eighteen, tall silver candles there.
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy, I can see that your colostrum has fully come in, nothing to worry about, often happens around the midway point with male omegas. Are you feeling any discomfort around the breast area?”
can’t,” Draco sounded a cross between miserable and irritated and it reminded Harry amusingly of how much more regularly the omega’s petulant side had been coming through lately.
“Hmm,” Harry hummed thoughtfully, glancing back at the attempted nest. “Well, what’s the purpose of building a nest for an omega?”
Harry had never known an omega to produce quite this much slick, although he certainly wasn’t complaining.
“I knew she loved Potter,” Snape stated coldly after a few moments silence, “I knew I couldn’t change that. But I just wanted something, I wanted
“Oh, that’s lovely,” Remus smiled, looking over Draco’s shoulder. “It’s all different animals, look –there’s a stag.”
Hermione nodded in understanding. Sirius was fiercely protective of Harry and if he got it in his head that some omega had taken advantage of Harry’s good nature then he would probably be the first to kick up a fuss.
“After the baby’s born,” Harry cleared his throat, “I don’t know what Draco will do. I assume he’ll stay with Snape or something.”
“Have you ever seen Harry duel?” Hermione asked, arching her eyebrow and looking somewhat amused. “He’ll be fine. Besides, it’s just stupid, puffed up alphas posturing isn’t it? Even worse when they’re boys.”
. They’d never do anything to hurt me and they certainly don’t hate you Draco. I don’t see how anyone could to be honest.”
“I don’t know,” Draco frowned, “maybe if I…” he swung his body round so he was sitting upright, his legs dangling over the side of the bed. “You could sit in front of m-me, if you get that chair?”
“Your…pyjamas?” Harry questioned, wondering if there was something he was missing here. He knew that omegas weren’t usually around alphas unchaperoned but he figured theirs was a unique situation.
“Okay,” Harry sighed, figuring out how to proceed. A moment later, however, Draco reached across to the folds of his dress, pulling out his hawthorn wand.
Draco nodded lazily in agreement but evidently didn’t move his head quite right as Harry chuckled fondly, stroking the side of Draco’s cheek. The alpha lifted up Draco’s legs, holding his slender feet in the air and exposing Draco completely. Even after everything, Draco still found it within himself to blush as Harry stared down at Draco’s puffy and gaping hole.
There was a moment of quiet before Harry let out a long sigh. “Even I know that’s not right, I’m sorry Draco.”
“How would Potter feel?” Severus asked, “You tell me that you are going to actually bond with that hooligan. Have you asked him about this?”
“That’s kind,” Harry smiled, some of the tension at sharing the news with his best friends slipping away. “I think we would rather just get bonded sooner rather than later though. Although it would be a nice idea to have a celebration.”
“Oh,” Harry piped up, suddenly remembering something. “I haven’t even told you about Sirius and Remus’ wedding present yet.”
“Yeah,” Harry grinned, winking at Draco. “Figured I’d save your cardigans, I reckon custard would be tricky to get out of that type of fabric.”
“I don’t know,” Draco wrinkled his brow, he hadn’t even thought about using his wand to help with the nest. “I think so, a lot of omegas don’t because of the smell but your magic just smells like you.”
Draco glared at the other boy, alpha or not Draco wondered if he could get away with hexing him into a stinkhorn toadstool and blaming it on pregnancy hormones.
Unbidden images of pale white skin and spit shined pink lips flashed through Harry’s mind as he thumped his head in self reprimand.  It was no good he decided, if he didn’t beat off now then he knew from experience he would probably spend the rest of the day on edge. It was Christmas Eve and Sirius and Remus had gone out for the day to visit some friends. Harry wanted to enjoy his precious time alone with Draco whilst he could, knowing that the next week would be a flurry of parties and events filled with other people.
A nasty twist of satisfaction settled in Harry’s gut as he watched the two of them descend into rushed, accusatory whispers. To his surprise when he glanced back over at Luna she sent him a small wink. Harry knew that he had always liked the former Ravenclaw.
“And when baby Severus comes I’m sure you’ll figure out babysitting,” his godfather concluded as Draco let out a loud laugh.
“I’m going to let you go,” Harry whispered furiously, “but only because I don’t want to scare Draco. However, if you
“Primrose and Profitts,” Snape repeated. “The historically pureblood’s financial institution of choice when it comes to trust funds, dowries and inheritances.”
With that, Harry turned on his heel and stormed back towards Draco and Hermione, the air still seeming to crackle with the power of his magical energy. Behind them, Smith hobbled away as quickly as he could, considering his incredibly wide legged stance.
“Ron,” Harry sighed, this was about the third time his friend had asked since Harry had told them of his plans the previous evening.
“It’s not my fault Smith is an arsehole!” Draco could hear Harry, he crept closer to the door to listen to the conversation, not sure whether he should go in or not. Would Harry be angry to see him? Draco had caused so much trouble and it didn’t help that the handsome alpha had then seen Draco in nothing but his underwear. Draco felt even more pangs of embarrassment bubble up in his chest.
“Draco,” Harry murmured, reaching out to hold either side of Draco’s waist as the younger man began to undulate, rotating his hips in small, maddening circles atop of Harry’s straining crotch. Draco was biting at his lip, tipping his head back. “My perfect mate,” Harry sighed happily, he threaded his fingers through Draco’s hair, gently pulling the strands free. Various bobby pins and a peach ribbon fell to the floor as Draco’s silver locks spread down across his shoulders. His hair was still intertwined with sprigs of flowers, giving him the appearance of some sort of ethereal forest nymph.
Draco bent down to roll up a small ball of snow with his mittens before standing up decisively and throwing it at Harry’s back. His eyes widened in horror, however, as the snowball exploded against the back of Harry’s head instead, ice slipping down the alpha’s collar.
“Look, Damien,” Harry sighed, trying to not be as cold or blunt as Hermione used to scold him for being when rejecting potential partners.
“I like that idea.”  Harry agrees.  Giving Draco a sure expression.  Astoria is important to Draco.  Probably the second most important woman in his life after his mother.  She was the only one outside of them that was aware of their relationship.  He feels increasing guilt every time he considers that even Ron and Hermione don't know yet.   He doesn't want to keep their relationship quiet from his friends much longer.  He needs to tell them soon.
Her scream is how he remembers it.  High and screeching like nails on a chalkboard, not so different than her laugh had been in life.
Potter kisses him then.  Draco has never had a kiss so sweet.  Chaste.  There is something about it that is captivating.  It is little more than a press of lips, but he feels his heart literally pound in his chest at it.  Suddenly intensely aware of everywhere he and Potter are touching.
Lily nods her head.  “I love you, Daddy.”  She proclaims earnestly.  Jamie is impressed.  It's a good opener on her part.  But she’s too green to know Dad sees right through her.
He closes his eyes.  Breathing deeply through his nose and out of his mouth like mother taught him when he was a boy.  Ignoring his dislike of the stale smell of his cell.  It was good to smell bad here he reminds himself.  He had been avoiding the showers.
Jamie's heard bits and pieces of the war over the years.  More than his siblings, he reckons.  He knows Dad saved a lot of people before he became an auror.  But if what Teddy’s saying is true, Draco did the opposite.  That’s what Liam was saying about Draco being death eater scum days ago.  Al seems deep in thought too, brow furrowed and frowning.  He could be serious for a kid.
Besides, Harry was sitting closest to Draco, his left arm outstretched over the side of the settee so as to occasionally brush his fingers against Draco’s knee. The fire was crackling happily away as the groundskeeper Hagrid, whom Harry was apparently very close to, had brought dried logs from the stores.
Draco shook his head, trying to dispel the voice. He didn’t mind if Harry was only concerned about the baby, that just meant he was a good father already.
“No, thank you, I can’t,” Harry replied, noting the relief that washed through his own body at the decision.
However, Bellatrix had made it blisteringly clear that this wasn’t going to happen. Draco had been devastatingly certain his future lay with Atherol Sourboll, the portly man who smelled like mint humbugs and had pinched Draco’s bottom when his aunt wasn’t looking.
“Ah,” Harry stated as he saw that Draco was wearing a white nightgown with long sleeves and decorated cuffs. The fabric fell to just below his knees and Draco’s feet were pale and bare against the dark stone floor. Half of Gaedere House ran about in far skimpier wear but for some reason there was something rather provocative about the garment, as if it wasn’t meant to be seen by others.
“I, um,” Draco fidgeted with the hem of his fluffy cardigan, half wishing he had a nest to crawl into right about now, “I’m not particularly popular with the other omegas.”
“Ooh, what about Hagrid’s Hut?” Harry said brightly as Draco’s eyes widened warily. “I reckon we could string some fairy lights up around the guttering.”
“Which flavour do you want?” Harry asked, picking up a large knife and a paper plate. “There’s apple, ginger, chocolate, honey, vanilla and rhubarb, which I know sounds a bit like a weird mix,” Harry spoke a little louder and pointedly as Ron snorted and hid behind his hand, evidently having already commented on the flavour choices.
Draco squeaked with mortification as he tried to jump out of Harry’s lap, yelping as the sudden movement threatened to undo all the good the massage had accomplished. Harry quickly spread his legs, causing Draco to slip between them, effectively trapping him on the seat where he couldn’t do any more damage to himself out of embarrassment.
nest is going to also house your alpha and your baby,” Harry smiled. “Surely that’s a plus point for it?”
“How I wanted to get my cock inside you whilst I fondle your swollen tits, make that little omega prick of yours bounce as I fuck you hard.”
Unfortunately, Draco knew he wouldn’t be able to live with Severus after graduation. However he hoped that Harry’s promise of looking into Draco’s inheritance might come through. Even if Draco was only able to get a little bit, it might still be enough for him to buy a modest flat somewhere that was safe to raise a child.
Draco tried his best not to cry as Harry and Hermione led him down to greet all the guests and receive a pile of presents and cards that Ron dutifully gathered together and placed in an assortment of canvas bags for them to take back when it was over.
Draco’s cheeks flushed crimson before he scurried back over to the other side of the room and began fussing with unpacking things from his trunk and hanging them up in the wardrobe. Harry noticed that Draco didn’t seem to have many items with him.
“Hermione let it slip after your accident,” Harry nudged Draco’s side. “It’s bloody brilliant. I thought maybe we could go celebrate? Hyde Park have got this wizarding winter wonderland festival on?”
“Oh I’m sorry,” Madam Pomfrey huffed, “should I have chosen a different object to suit you Mr. Potter? Your baby is the size of a quaffle.”
“I am afraid Mr. Potter has already been made aware of your condition,” Professor McGonagall announced, looking very serious. “You are going to need to explain yourself Mr. Malfoy.”
Ron paled slightly, “Okay, I get why when you put it that way it’s a bit off, but this is an unusual situation right?”
) liked to describe Harry as ‘arrogant and lazy’, his grades and achievements stood for themselves. Of course, Remus had always been there too, to tone down Harry’s cockiness and remind him to keep his alpha in check. It didn’t exactly help though that Sirius would be pulling faces in the background.
Remus looked up from where he was sat cross legged on the bedroom floor. “Harry, I don’t think you’ve ever coupled with that boy.”
“If you’ll have me,” Harry smiled, sweeping back the younger boy’s sweaty fringe and pressing a small kiss to his forehead, “I would like to be your alpha even after the baby comes.”
They went to a muggle pub after signing to celebrate the end of their marriage.  It was nice to be friends.  Better than before the separation when everything was strained and awful.  He wants to always be friends with Gin.  She's the mother of his children.
Harry face palms so quickly he feels the smack to his forehead before he remembers moving.  Draco is chuckling beside him and when he lowers his hand, he enjoys the up-close view of his boyfriend’s delight.  Expression open and grey eyes pleased making Harry’s heart flutter.  He chances a glance at Narcissa who luckily also seems amused based on the quirk of her mouth and raised eyebrow.  Andromeda is laughing outright next to her.
“Sorry.”  Draco apologizes, squeezing his boyfriend’s hand as much as he can.  Harry’s expression flickers, and the man pinches the bridge of his nose, dislodging his glasses.  Draco watches Harry steady himself.  Feeling awful seeing the man so upset.
Draco’s expression does something complicated.  “It was terrible.”  The man finally answers, brow furrowing and sounding sad.  “But you knew that.  What’s brought this on – the manor opening?”
Unfortunately, someone much louder finds Maud before they can.  They can hear her exclamations of joy from down the passageway attached much too near the large rooms on the main floor.
“I haven’t restored everything yet.”  Draco tells them, expression considering.  “My mother might come to live here later – at least for part of the year – and I need to hire house elves to help maintain the place.  I suppose there will be times I stay here too.”
“I’m sorry, Greg.”  He responds, concerned .  “There is nothing I can think of and I would caution you against trying anything experimental – particularly for your wife’s safety.”
Sy and Robards escort him to one of their conference rooms.  He is no longer allowed free access to the bull pen and his office without supervision.  Not until this is cleared up.  Harry hopes this will be finished in time for him to meet up with Draco for lunch.  One of the hit wizards arrive to guard him.  Stationed outside the door.  Sy wishes him good luck and exits.  Robards gives a curt nod and does the same.  Harry feels more annoyed than anything.  He has nothing to hide.
The peeling wallpaper remained in most of the rooms.  Faded birds and flowers weaving through the interwoven vines that papered the main corridors and foyer.  Lily’s little crayon drawings on the wallpaper, stubbornly too still for the birds flitting around them.  Kreacher maintained cleanliness, especially on the main floor, but bemoaned “Master Harry is
“You make him happy, you know.”  Ginevra states with surety.  “I’m glad you’re with him.  You're obviously made for each other.”
Marry a pureblood witch.  Have pureblood children.  Live at the manor.  Repeat the cycle.  That was what he was
“There are several activities you can do at home to support him.  Reading together and working with him to spell things out in a variety of ways are often the most helpful.  My staff will provide you with a packet when you check out.”
“Am I overstepping?” Draco asks worriedly.  He tried to not take on a role that was not his.  He never wanted to get between Harry and the children.  “You must tell me if I am.  I’m
I'm interested in playing around with different POVs.  The chapters I have planned out are mostly Harry or Draco POVs so far.  I own nothing but plots!  Thanks for reading.
"What did your father say?”  He begins the all too familiar refrain.  Propping a hand on his hip.  He and Harry did their best to not counteract one another.
“It’s me!”  He shouts, holding his nose where Malfoy elbowed him squarely in the face.  Not broken he realizes a second later, lowering his hand.
Part of Harry thought once all this was set up, he would be keeping his distance.  That was the plan.  Now Draco is a significant part of his life.  The person he speaks the most honestly with anymore.  It is rare for him to be around someone he can be completely himself.  That he would be welcomed that way.
“Am I okay?”  Harry repeats, sounding genuinely questioning.  Draco turns to his side and rubs at Harry's arm closest to him.  His boyfriend flexes underneath his ministrations.  “Fuuuuuck.”  The man moans, finally moving to unfold himself, but remaining on his stomach.
Al straightens his glass in the meantime, expression growing concerned. “What d’you think Bixby will do with it – uh, her?”
Harry moves to hug his former mother-in-law.  Resting his cheek on the crown of her head as Molly squeezes him back.  She was the best hugger.  It never failed to make him feel like he belonged with them.  Like he was twelve years old again and getting the first taste of parental affection.
“We’re not talking about this.”  Draco mutters, lowering his hands, utterly self-conscious.  He will face his mortification like a man.
He finds his boyfriend in the office going over parchment filled with numbers and ancient runes.  Concentrating.  He loves seeing Draco casual like this.  The flat was the only place he ever saw Draco out of a blazer or long-sleeved shirt – except Harry’s own bedroom.
It was withering when directed toward Jamie and his siblings, but he knew most adults shrank under it too.
“Shut it, Malfoy.”  Seamus turns his head to rebut.  Eyes narrowing and mouth puckering like he tasted something sour.  “No one asked you.  I don’t care if you’re with Potter.  You’re still a prat.”
“Use it in a sentence.”  Draco prompts.  Crossing his legs and sitting back as James huffs.  It was hardly a surprise.  Every time they spelled James was asked to define or use the word as a way to build his mastery of word and sound meanings.
“I’m sure you’re wondering why I gathered you here today.”  Dad begins with an air of authority.  Jamie imagines this is how he is at work, but probably in trousers then and not the sweatpants he likes to wear at home.
“Really?!”  Hermione comments sarcastically.  “That’s your excuse?  I was in that meeting.  Kingsley cleared you to read him in.”
“We can.”  Draco answers, hands on his hips as he considers the manor ahead of them from where they stand on the drive past the main gates.  Harry has the sealed portrait of Walburga Black under his arm.  The wooden seal maintaining a blessed peace for now.  “It will be my gift to you.”
“You’ve paid that back a thousand-fold.”  Draco assures with an affectionate expression.  “Besides, it was a little hole in the wall place anyways.”
“Nah.”  His boyfriend denies playfully, a smile forming on his lips despite the sleep in his voice.  “We’re fast asleep, aren’t we, love?”
“Sorry for blathering on.  I know you’re Gin’s friend too . . .”  He trails off.  He trusts Luna implicitly, but he knew it was hard for their friends and family to hear why he and Gin didn’t work as a couple.  He usually avoided speaking about it.  But Luna was often an exception to topics he typically avoided.
Lily is snuggled in her quilt on his lap, little socked feet sticking out and Albus between them tucked into Harry’s side.  James is the only one content to lay his head on his mother’s lap and watch the animated movie Harry is playing on the televisior machine.  The three little Potters fall asleep not even halfway through the film.  Draco has seen this film several times now.  It is about a muggle warrior woman in China.  There are few ‘princess’ movies the boys are willing to watch with Lily and this is one of them.
“That’s a rather philosophical question.”  Draco remarks, enjoying the warmth of Potter’s arm about his shoulders.  The whole day was shaping into something like a pleasant dream.  He had been eager to see Potter again.
“I was more frightened of myself with a wand.”  Draco says, glancing down at Jamie.  Grey eyes thoughtful.  “Having a wand means being responsible.  I was never taught that as a boy.  I thought it was my right as a wizard.  I was very wrong.”
Mrs. Weasley obviously takes great pride in her baking ability.  Every cake he has seen from her has been many tiered and decorated with the interests of the recipient.  Sparklers lighting on top.  Lily has to stand on her chair to blow out her candles.  The topic from a moment ago completely forgotten.
“I was in Paris once, but I’ve never been to Seoul.”  Harry adds conversationally.  There was a list of places he wanted to visit.  He'd been able to cross a few off while joining Ginny on international tournaments.  They usually did not have much time to sight see though.
He loves Lucius because he is his father.  The same one who taught him to ride brooms and Abraxan horses with equal abandon.  A father he admired and wanted to be like in every way.  It was what he was
“I like that change too.”  Harry adds in.  Wondering at the state of his life that he and Pansy are on the same page about school schedules.  “My godson visits us a few weekends out of each semester.  I still miss him of course, but it’s better than only three breaks a year.  Hogwarts isn’t perfect, but at least the professors are doing more to address that now.”
“If you like.”  He responds.  Personally, his hope was that Malfoy could live here without issue the remainder of his days.  He had placed people before in witness protection, but there was usually a team of people from the DMLE helping in those circumstances.
Draco smiles in turn as he catches Harry’s look.  Shutting his eyes tightly and pretending to snore loudly.  Harry joins in causing Lily to squawk in indignation.
“No, you don’t.”  She challenges, reaching over to pat his cheek.  Reminding him instantly of their daughter.  “Tell me when you realized you were attracted to men, my dear ex-husband.”
“I am.”  Harry confirms, going over to the free chair to sit.  Taking off his boots and uniform cloak.
“I’ll see you tomorrow, right?”  Harry asks Draco over the din.  Draco nods, but his brow is furrowed.  Harry spies Astoria headed their way.  Expression guarded again, and people looking confused in her wake.  As if she just suddenly ducked out of conversation.  He wonders what they look like to her right now.  He ducks in closer to whisper in Draco’s ear, putting a hand on his shoulder.  “Their reactions don’t change my feelings about you.”
Harry can see where Molly is standing in the garden, wiping her forehead off with a handkerchief.  Looking over at all the commotion his daughter is making.  Arthur is getting to his feet from where he was relaxing on the wicker chair by the back of the house.  The older boys are further afield.  His sons and Freddie flying around on their toy brooms that fly no higher than a yard above the ground.
“I will pick you up after nursery school on Monday.”  He informs her calmly once again.  Having told her this before last night.  “Mummy is going to look after you for a few days.  You’ll be with your brothers.  You’ve stayed overnight here before just fine.  You’ll be okay.”
How could Malfoy do it?  Accept everything?  Harry hoped the fool would have leaned more heavily on his part on their side during the battle or even what happened at the manor.  Try to save himself a little bit.  Sure, Malfoy turned tail for their side only at the end, but he fought for Hogwarts – for Riddle’s defeat.  Instead Draco Malfoy fell on his sword.
“Please, Christmas day was ridiculous," She tells him with a put upon look, rolling her eyes.  "All I heard from Mum was how wonderful you've been for Harry and the children.”
The two men share a look.  It is one of their silent conversations.  Draco knows his expression is exasperated but Harry gives him such an abused face in return.  Lower lip slightly pouted in a near perfect impression of Albus’ wounded crup eyes.
“Agree to disagree.”  He retorts.  It's what he would tell his children.  Draco moves upward and kisses his cheek.  Harry turns his head to return it.  Chasing his lips.  When Harry opens his eyes, it is to see Draco’s content expression.  It fills him with warmth.  Checking his watch does not dull it too much.  He has a little less than twenty minutes remaining.
Potter moves them to the bed.  Hands clutching at each other as Draco’s back hits the mattress.  Potter lifts Draco’s hips, making them more comfortable and lowers himself to Draco’s chest, taking a nipple in his mouth and massaging his buttocks.  Draco gasps at the sensation, one hand going thoughtlessly to Potter’s hair to grip.  The feeling goes straight to his cock.  Potter attacks his chest with his teeth and tongue like its his job.  Grinding against each other sensually for several moments, friction exquisite.  Draco groans when Potter lets up to kiss him in the middle of the chest, leaving small kisses and sucking at Draco’s skin as he makes his way south.  It feels like his cock is an iron bar when Potter’s face finally nears.  Saliva left from his boyfriend’s kisses cooling on his skin on the trail down.  Scars feeling sensitive where he kissed them in his wake.  Draco feels his hips twitch upwards once Potter settles by Draco’s groan.  Kissing the juncture of his hip above the elastic of his pants, making Draco shudder.
“No.”  Draco states, brow furrowing and standing straighter.  “I want to try.  It’s just . . . well, if I’m not any good at it or you don’t like my surprise, I want you to tell me.  Don’t let me make a fool of myself.”
“Thanks, guys.”  He says gratefully.  Hermione lets go and wipes her eyes.  Harry really did not mean to make her cry.  It is a significant load off his shoulders to share this with them.
“You could buy the food before I get here, you know.”  Harry snarks, enjoying Malfoy’s look of distaste at the idea as he hands over Malfoy’s lunch.  It's a warm day out for springtime.  The muggle park they meet at is often busy.  It is commonplace for office people to take their lunch and parents to bring their children to play.  He and Malfoy seem like ordinary office workers eating their lunch in the sun.
The sprogs are excited.  He figured they would be.  This was an opportunity for early presents after all.  He watches as Draco and Andromeda get everything ready.  Working with the children to mix the individual spices and dried petals like an art project.  Draco fills the cloth bags one at a time.  Tying them to the Yuletide log in front of the fireplace.
Harry sighs, wiping off his face with a cloth and putting away his razor.  “Yes, partly - though I still love your mum in the way friends love each other.  But your mum and I realized we wanted different things in a marriage – that can happen sometimes.”
“Let me rephrase,” Draco says, considering his next words.  “He cares less what I think about him than what you do.”
All and all he thinks he looks good.  His hair is a lost cause.  He gave up on it years ago.  But he did his best to comb out his nearly shoulder length hair.  Tying it loosely back so it appears a little orderly – or that he had at least tried.  Thick, springy jet-black hair still trying to do what it pleases.  He tries to imagine what Draco will think.  Harry fills out his robes much more nicely than he did as an adolescent.  He will never be more than average height, but he has wider shoulders than he could have hoped for as a teenager.  His tan skin looks good against the green of his robes, making the earthier undertones stand out.  Luna had helped him buy these a few years ago.  Her tastes tended toward the bizarre, but she had not steered him wrong yet.
His relationship with Potter makes him feel as he did when he first realized he could be free in Paris all those years ago at the start of his apprenticeship.  Free of Britain.  Free of his father’s control.  The dark shadow of the war slowly drifting to the periphery.  Nervous and excited.  Bewildered to be alive.
The day is not a total wash.  He and Harry take the children to the park after dinner to burn off some steam.  They do not often get out publicly and the children run straight for the playground equipment.  Typically, they are either at his flat or Grimmauld with or without the children.  He and Harry are still somewhat private about their relationship.  By the sounds of things, when Harry does take the children out and about on his own, it is his preference to go to muggle locales to avoid curious wizarding eyes.
“I know you planned on being here a week, but aren’t people wondering where you are?”  Malfoy begins partway through their quiet dinner.  “Your family maybe?”  The man suggests with a slight shrug of one shoulder.
“I want to be partners.”  Draco decides.  “But I also want it to be permanent too - whatever happens.  I'm not certain if those two ideals can work together?  Or if I should even say that considering this is our first official date.”
So Kreacher has his own room now too.  Not that he uses it for himself.  Still preferring to spend most of his time in the kitchen cupboards and pantry.  If Jamie was a house elf that’s where he would live too.  That way he’d have all the biscuits to himself.
It is a lot.  Harry has one hand at Draco’s lower back massaging and the other behind Draco’s head.  Cradling him almost.  Then Harry readjusts, nudging at Draco’s prostate in a manner that is simply spectacular.  Causing his whole body to twitch with the most fantastic sensation.
He can hear Dad laughing and talking animatedly to Teddy from the hallway above the sitting room.  Occasionally Draco’s voice comes in.  It used to be Jamie could eavesdrop however long he liked, but now that Olta lives with them he gets tapped on the shoulder and prompted for bed.  The elf scolding him mildly and suggesting she might take away his treats for being naughty.
He and Harry walk the sidewalk perimeter around the playground, stopping here and there to watch the children.  Muggles are interspersed throughout in their own couples and families.  Young people sitting on the public benches with their cellular phones out.  It occurs to him how peaceful all this is.  A perfect autumn day.  Fountains gently trickling in the background and children playing in front of them.  Harry’s warm hand in his own.  This could be some version of the rest of his life if he permits himself to continue to walk this path.
Ginny always had the kids during the window of time where the national league championship ended and before the international one began.  When she brings their exhausted children back to Grimmauld late on Saturday, he is working up the courage to have a serious conversation with her.
Harry tore his eyes away from Draco’s animated face to look down at the pretty buckle up shoes in a shiny powder blue colour.
Draco sat stiffly in the Charms classroom. Professor Flitwick was droning on about areas of effect within casting but none of the students were paying him attention. In fact a lot of them seemed to be shooting furtive looks in Draco’s direction.
“Right you,” Harry snarled playfully, stalking forwards as Draco yelped and tried to run away. It was no good however, the alpha’s strong arms wrapped around the omega not a moment later and Draco found himself hoisted backwards so Harry’s front was pressed against his back. “Got you,” Harry growled, the low rumble of his chest vibrating against Draco and making him shiver.
“Oh, I see,” Olive’s face fell in sympathy before she studied the photo again. “Well, would you like to try and find something like she’s wearing in the picture? She looks absolutely wonderful in it and I can see you’ve inherited her genes.”
“Never,” Harry replied, looking affronted before winking and adding, “you only ever smell delicious.”
Draco re-read the letter twice before carefully rolling it back up and popping it on the nightstand. Of course it wasn’t surprising that Harry was reluctant to take Draco home over the holidays. Draco wasn’t Harry’s real omega and his godfathers were probably furious that he had apparently gotten someone unintentionally pregnant.
Harry’s eyes seemed to glaze out of focus for a moment before the alpha cleared his throat and picked up a napkin. “Here, you’ve got some on your chin,” Harry said, dabbing the cloth against Draco’s face and inadvertently swiping Draco’s sticky lips with the pad of his thumb.
Harry quickly checked to see that Draco was completely dry. Katie was laughing and clutching at the grinning omega whilst Hermione very loudly began to lecture Seamus about the laws of transmutative magi-physics.
Harry frowned as Seamus flicked his wand and murmured something, causing a large globule of the buttercup yellow custard to bubble up and escape from a nearby jug.
“Are we doing lunch then or what?” Harry asked loudly, interrupting whatever Ginny had been going to say and sending her a warning glare.
“All done,” Padma announced, screwing the lid back on the jar of ointment. “You got anything to change into?”
“You may,” Harry laughed fondly, “but I don’t think I’m done with you quite yet.” Harry made sure Draco was watching him as he brought up the hand still covered by the omega’s release and diligently began to clean it with his tongue.
“Is –is it okay to use when I’m pregnant?” Draco asked, looking at the small blue tub that Katie passed her friend. Padma unscrewed the lid and the scent of camomile and honey wafted across.
“N-No,” Draco said, his lips moving by Harry’s nipple, tickling the hair there. “Don’t be sorry. You’re here now, I knew you’d come.”
“I think he looked smug,” Muriel sniffed. “Knows he’s done well for himself and did you see the way he clings to Harry? I swear he wouldn’t leave the poor alpha alone even for a minute.”
Draco may be young but Molly and Arthur had bonded at his age. Harry knew it was a little different as he was older, but surely four years couldn’t be that damning in the grand scheme of things? Although, would Draco even want to bond with Harry? Harry worried that maybe the omega simply tolerated him so as to better support their baby.
“Harry, why does one of our fairy lights have a bottle of whisky?” Draco frowned as the fairy continued to huff and puff, heaving the large dusty bottle further up into the air. “Oh!” Draco gasped as brightly coloured jets of spells fired upwards, the fairy deftly weaving out of the way as Harry recognised Sirius’ shouts of outrage below.
“He’ll need my magic though,” Harry replied, “male omega pregnancies can be a lot for the body and Draco’s already pretty weak looking.”
Harry frowned, he wasn’t quite sure he knew what Draco meant. Was the omega worried Harry was going to go laugh with his friends about having copped a view of Draco’s arse? It wasn’t like the younger boy had been doing anything shameful,
“Oh?” Smith quirked an eyebrow. The alpha was tall but not quite as big as Harry, although he still stood at an impressive breadth and height that served to be more than intimidating enough for Draco. “I’m surprised after what went down in that snow globe that Potter let you out of his sight.”
Instead, Harry got up and wandered over to have a look at some of the shirts hanging from a nearby rail. There were a few in alpha sizes and the kinds of colours he liked on himself. He picked one up and held it against his chest in front of the floor length mirror. It was a wine burgundy with gold buttons that were a little flashier than Harry’s usual taste but seemed to suit his skin tone.
Harry felt relieved as Draco nodded and gave him a shy smile. “You got anything in there like those magazines you liked?” Harry asked. He knew Draco had also brought a picture of his mother but he hadn’t shown it to Harry yet.
“A lot of the more traditional alphas don’t approve of their omegas seeking employment,” Severus hummed thoughtfully, “believing it to reflect badly on their ability to support and provide for the household themselves.”
“I know,” Draco whispered, ashamed of the slight pang of regret he felt at Harry stating so clearly that he didn’t want him. Draco’s omega was taking the gentlemanly reassurance as some kind of rejection and Draco was doing his very best to shut down such silliness. He
Draco had been revising in the common room the other day, Harry intently watching as the younger boy nibbled on the end of his quill, small pink tongue sticking out in concentration. Harry hadn’t even noticed that he had been emitting alpha pheromones until Luna had politely opened a window. Harry had guiltily looked back to Draco who had smiled shyly from under his lashes.
Harry tried to push down the wave of irritation he felt at the idea of his friends talking about his and Draco’s sex life.
“I guess he isn’t bored of you yet,” Bella continued, flagging over a waiter and ordering for the both of them without giving Draco a choice anyway. “I see I was right though.”
“I’ll take it off,” Harry promised, quickly standing up and unbuttoning his shirt and jeans. “I’m going to get Hermione to watch over you whilst I find some other clothes okay? Fuck – Draco –“ Harry lurched forwards just as the other boy began slipping downwards under the water, submerging his chin and mouth.
A moment later, Draco slipped out from the changing room and Harry nearly dropped his tea in surprise, quickly stashing it on top of a nearby table.
Harry frowned as his inner alpha’s desire to protect any omega from harm rose up within. He had always hated alphas who wouldn’t take ‘no’ for an answer and thought they were entitled to harass omegas into dating or spending time with them.
“P-Please leave,” Draco whimpered. He had now managed to cover his chest with his elbows and plastered his hands against his face, completely concealing him from Harry’s view.
Draco nodded, looking pleased as he cooed at Lyra, unwrapping her silk shawl before cradling her gently to his chest and drawing across the water to look out of the window. “It’s so beautiful here Harry, I’m so happy.”
Harry wasn’t sure he did remember Gabby, although he had the vague impression that she might have been strawberry blonde.
Harry had actually heard about, given that Mrs. White sent Sirius an invite every year on account of having been tremendously close with his mother Walburga Black and ever so impressed at his ‘war hero’ status. Then again, every single invitation also neglected to include Remus and was subsequently thrown in the bin or turned into origami, often of particularly ugly insects in compromising positions.
The letter didn’t bear any recognizable seals so Draco knew it wasn’t another of his aunt’s diatribes. He unfurled the parchment and began to read,
“Not to mention that that sort of ridiculous display is only going to cause stress for Draco and the baby,” Hermione finished.
A little while later, Draco excused himself to go and get another drink of water. Harry was engaged in a heated discussion with Percy Weasley regarding something to do with beneficiary trusts. Draco smiled as he saw Ron and Hermione playing with Bill and Fleur’s young children. A ginger three year old was attempting to mummify himself in a pixie infested Christmas garland, despite Hermione’s best attempts to distract him with a set of colourful building blocks. Draco smoothed his hand over his bump and wondered if in a few years they would be doing the same with his and Harry’s child? Would Draco even be invited again so as to see it?
“I didn’t either,” Harry shook his head reassuringly, “honestly, the healer said it’s quite rare and tends to only occur with male omegas. But it’s good you’re feeling better now, you fell asleep pretty much after – um, after your bath.”
“I bet your alpha wants to bite him,” Ginny’s face was looking suspiciously wicked. “I know you Harry, you pretend to be all blasé and easy going like some Sirius Black clone, but you
The next morning Harry awoke with a raging headache, fumbling around on the bedside table for a hangover potion.
Jamie hesitates, but Al crumbles immediately.  “We were afraid Bixby would get rid of her.  We wanted to wait to ask Dad and Draco together if we could keep her as a pet, but Dad’s not back yet.”  His brother spills worriedly.
“What’s that?”  Harry questions, leaning against the pillows Draco has stacked against the headboard.  “Is it lube?”  He asks waggling his eyebrows in his best come hither impression.
“Yes.”  Harry reassures, testing the bindings.  Pleased with the restriction he finds there.  “You remember the safety word?”
“I’m sorry, mate.  All I told them was I didn't trust Malfoy.  I did not accuse him of tampering with your cases.  I didn’t make the complaint either.”
Students at Hogwarts got a couple weekends out of each semester to visit their families.  This weekend Teddy is coming to theirs.  His grandmother, Andromeda, was out of town for some work thing anyways.  Teddy usually spent one of his weekends and part of any holiday with them since Dad was his godfather.
“I don’t know, Mother.”  Draco replies quietly returning his mother’s neutral expression, and again relocating Lily’s drink back toward the center of the table.  Away from imminent risk of spilling.  “It depends on the case he’s working.”
It feels like everything is coming together.  That this is a natural result of the life he and Harry are building together.  They have never hosted anything like this.  He ought not to be so surprised how well their groups mix.  After all, they have had smaller gatherings of their friends before at Grimmauld.  Astoria is quick to engage everyone which is a relief too.
“Master will not eat the hors d’oeuvres.”  Kreacher reprimands him as he leads the shoes over for Harry to step into.  “Kreacher is not there to be fixing stains.”
I wanted some floof in this chapter after the last one.  I hope you enjoy.  As always, I own nothing.  Thank you for reading.
Draco has the distinct since of déjà vu when one drink becomes two and suddenly, he is sideways with Potter snogging him.  It is their second kiss technically and not entirely unexpected.  Draco hoped accepting Potter’s invitation tonight would lead to something along these lines.
Even here, Harry aches for him still.  Running his hands over Draco’s strong shoulders and arms.  It is not the hot, desperate need they have indulged in recent days.
Draco nods, observing the life drain out of his literal body.  “I have an idea of how I can save myself, but it may also kill me.”  He tells Severus, again preparing himself for courage.  How he hated this.  If he managed to escape, he would be having a word or two with his father about how the man was the catalyst to this whole mess.
“Do you like quidditch?!” He demands as everyone at the table looks at him.  He remembers too late about being loud indoors and gives Dad an apologetic look.  But he wants to know.
perfect of all the allegedly perfect people.  The boy believed the wizard would control all the imperfect people in the world and make it so the perfect people were in charge.  The wizard wanted the boy to obey him so he gave him a task.  He told the boy to kill someone who wanted to stop the wizard's plans.”
“Parkinson.”  Harry greets tersely.  He has not spoken to her in several years.  He had been hoping for a few more.  The last time was in court during a hearing where she represented the Prophet.  He was not a fan.  Parkinson’s heavy lipstick and darkly shadowed eyes made her look older in his opinion.  Her face was still a bit puggish but even he had to admit her hair bob framed her face in a flattering way.
“That’s okay.”  Anthony says easily, going over to sit by his wife, and bounce the baby on his knee.  “He’s a pretty easy-going little chap.  We brought some toys in the nappy bag anyways.  Pansy always has the bag packed for anything he needs.”
“His memory is remarkable and clearly his language ability improved.”  Draco responds.  “There is a reason he went this long without all the adults in his life figuring it out.  He was clever enough to adapt.”
“What happened, Mr. Draco?”  Olta asks worriedly in her heavy accent, a tea tray floating behind her as she enters the room.  “Are you ill?  Should I call a healer?”
After a pregnant pause, Harry breaks into a jig beside him.  “Take that, you bloody bitch!”  His boyfriend shouts gleefully, spinning around.  Delight contagious, causing Draco to grin in response.  Pleased he can make Harry so happy.
he had been off the last few days.  Frowning more and seeming distracted even when they were reading another chapter together in their book before bedtime.  Worried like adults could get sometimes though Jamie didn’t know exactly what about – Dad being gone maybe?  Probably.  Dad and Draco liked to be together.
didn’t even want to share a bed with me at the end of the row.  We’ve never slept apart if we were cross with each other before.”
“Malfoys live at the manor.”  Mother intoned firmly, expression perturbed at the very thought of him
He sits down on the couch next to them.  Observing as Draco weaves the intricate looking braids.  Fingers moving deftly.  His boyfriend’s new ring glinting slightly from the ceiling light.
“But so much of it is bad though, Harry.”  Draco says miserably.  “I’m trying so hard to be a good person.  I
It is a sad state of affairs that he is accustomed to the screaming and wretched rambling growing louder when the overhead lights go out.  Sleep remains challenging.  He aims for rest instead.  Propped against the roughhewn wall, reclining on his cot in his narrow cell.  The cells are little more than carved in slots along the walls, scarcely big enough for a cot and toilet.  Creaking lamps floating along the aisle walkways cast weak light.
“Two months.”  Draco replies.  He had been counting down the days.  Waiting for the other shoe to drop and for them to drag him back to Azkaban.  Mother and Mrs. Greengrass were planning the wedding for right after.  He did not entirely dread the wedding, but Astoria was correct, he did not want to be married to her.  It would not be a true marriage.
His friend gives him a wane smile but shakes his head.  “I’m a hard worker, and I'll always be loyal to her – that’s true enough – but I’m afraid of what our world might do to her.”  The man shares, expression worried.
“Over an hour.”  Severus states quietly.  Draco shivers, feeling a prickling sensation begin to develop in his fingers and toes.  “I was sent here to comfort you as you die.”
It is strange how easy Potter can be like they have done this a hundred times before.  Comfortable in his nudity around Draco.  Potter looks over to him with a smirk, resting his head back on Draco’s shoulder.  Draco returns the look, placing his hand on Potter’s chest.  Interested in the feeling of coarse hair and his heartbeat.
Greg chuckles.  “She thinks it’s funny if a bit messy."  He answers.  "Doesn’t really appreciate it when feathers and waste are left behind.”
“I’d win anyways.”  Harry teases, ducking when Draco lightly cuffs him.  “Just breathe, Draco.  You’re doing fine.”
“You wouldn’t be with one then.  Cause they’re bad.”  Al ventures looking and sounding unsure.  “Draco can’t be a death eater then.”
The moment his boyfriend sees Harry he turns his head to the wall.  Shoulders twitching once.  Draco isn't making any noise.  Harry wonders why the tap is on if it was not to cover the sounds of someone crying.
“They will never accept you."  Father tells him viciously.  "No matter what you do or who you debase yourself with – however exalted
“Darling.” Mother said pointedly, carefully placing her cup on its saucer with a clink.  “Whether you like it or not – and I am well aware not – you will be the twelfth generation Malfoy to hold that land.  The last too as you say.  Whatever remains of it will represent you and what you have done for our family.  You will have the last word so to speak.”
Draco looks a bit surprised by that, blinking once quicker than normal.  “Yes, I’ve never met her but that is true.  She is my mother’s older sister.”
“You know, nothing is preventing you from going there and sorting it.”  Draco suggested.  A last-ditch attempt and they both knew it.
There are people moving around quickly.  He is dimly aware that he is not in the way.  Audrey is moving quickly.  Time stutters around him in a manner he has not experienced in ages.  Distant and all too painfully present at once making him feel as if he is dizzily spinning.
“Thank you, sir, but there is no need for introductions.”  Malfoy begins with a slight nod toward Harry.  Expression impassive.  “We’ve actually met.”  The blonde man states, hands moving gracefully behind his back in a polite manner as if awaiting further instruction.  The movement reminds Harry momentarily of a waiter.
“Not from the ministry.”  Harry answers earnestly.  “Not like this.  It never should have gotten so far as it did today.”
“It took me literal years to pry that damn woman off the wall.”  Harry says at the end of Draco’s story.  Pinching the bridge of his nose.  “She drove Sirius mad at the end.”
you obsessed with me?”  Malfoy drawls, dragging a finger up the middle of Harry’s chest.  Making him twitch.
Malfoy shakes his head, appearing lost in thought.  “Stand, please.”  Malfoy instructs quietly, eyes focusing on Harry’s right leg.  Flicking his hand and summoning a measuring tape that begins its work spooling around his limb when Harry rises.
His neck hurts when he wakes the following morning after tossing and turning for hours in one of the guest room beds.  The sprogs at least don’t seem to notice anything amiss at breakfast, but Narcissa sure as hell does.  Her light eyes always on him whenever he glances up from his cup of tea.  A slight frown on her face and one very pointed look toward Draco when the man arrives a couple minutes later than usual to the table.  Looking wane but forcing a smile when the kids greet him.
“This is just like old times, isn’t it, Draco?”  Whispers the voice he loathes most this time of night.
He does take the occasional break to walk around the place.  It's a strikingly different experience strolling around now.  Nothing on the outside reminds him of that first horrific time he was here when Snatchers dragged them in during the war.  It is actually quite peaceful now in the newly constructed courtyard.  Trees, shrubbery, and flowerbeds lining the area making quite the scenic English garden.
hard to come by.”  Shepard says casually, the swear triggering entry into their comms.  It is the signal to move.
Harry is Harry.  Orbiting around him, constantly reaching out to touch him gently on the shoulder and checking that he is okay.  It is strange for Draco.  He is used to licking any wounds on his own, but Harry wants to be with him whenever he is vulnerable.  Draco discovers Harry updates Pansy on Draco’s progress via text.  That is irritating.  Astoria thinks it hilarious.
“So,” Ron starts slowly, eyes shifting down to his drink.  “’Mione tells me Malfoy is moving in with you.”
“Daddy!  Papa!”  Lily shouts exuberantly rushing over to the men before anyone else can say anything.  “Jamie and Al got a cruppy!”  She declares doing an excited little hop in front of them.
Jamie wonders if Dad will be such a dork when he starts coming home to visit from Hogwarts too.  But it might be just because it’s Teddy.  If Dad had a favorite child, it would be Teddy.  They're both orphans.  Both of their parents were killed in wizarding wars.  Jamie knows that Teddy’s dad and his Potter grandfather were really good mates.  That Teddy's mum was a metamorphmagus too.
“I know.”  Luna replies softly, smile kind.  “We don’t always get what we want, James Potter, but it is better to be straightforward when we ask.  Hiding a crup in a tearoom will not help your cause.”
“That would be . . . challenging.”  Ginny comments.  Sounding like she is restraining her amusement.
James mostly ignores him.  This does not change as the weeks go by and Draco becomes a regular fixture in the children’s lives.  Learning their habits.  Their ups and downs.  The few times James does not ignore him, the boy seems annoyed as Draco attempts to engage him in conversation.  Occasionally going so far as to groan and dramatically fall to the floor while Draco inquires how school was that day or if James finished his homework.  James then claiming he has been bored to death.  Albus and Lily giggling from the sidelines.
“Dad, Draco,” Jamie states as he draws near, tone demanding their attention. “When we get home can I have my pogo-go back?  I promise I won’t use it in the house.”
The second and last time she calls on him is nearly fourteen years later.  Out of the blue on a cool, crisp spring day.  An eagle owl tapping at the window of his office.  He is a deputy head auror by then and answers her request to visit him in his office with a counteroffer that he can meet her at the manor.  Andromeda had kept him apprised of Narcissa in the years since the sisters’ reunion.  Harry knew she was dying by then and in no state to traipse through the ministry and its many obstacles it would produce for a woman married to one death eater and the mother of another.
“You are different than what I expected.”  Andromeda finally says, releasing him.  “I am glad to finally meet you, nephew.”
Harry snorts, amused.  “Sure.  But you know, you could use a credit or debit card?  Then you wouldn’t have to mess about with any of that.” He suggests, half-joking.  If you'd asked him ten years ago if he would happily spend his lunch break bantering with Malfoy on the finer points of financial transactions in Europe, Harry would have laughed his arse off and told them they had gone mad.
when he was young.  Merlin knows Oliver Wood and Cedric Diggory had been proof enough of that.  He elects to suppress that line of thinking before it goes further.
When he was small, Mother would bring him to the solarium to watch the thunderstorms pass overhead.  They had fascinated him.  Amazed at the light streaking across the sky and nature’s raw power.  Everything in nature spoke to the possibility of magic and change.  The raw, unbridled energy.
Draco’s arms give out immediately as he plops back.  Sensation narrowed down to Potter’s mouth.  His hips fucking up only to be held back by Potter’s firm hand at his hip.  He gets pinched for it, but Potter’s hand leaves his hip momentarily and puts his hand on Draco’s where it is buried in his head.  He curls Draco’s hand purposefully to take a stronger grasp on his hair before removing it.  Draco pulls at the strands.  Moaning when Potter moves to take in more of him.
“How long have you and that Scamander bloke been a couple?”  Harry asks the second they have a moment alone in the alcoves outside the manor’s great hall.  “You two seem very . . . close.”  He teases.  It was obvious – at least to him – how the two were mooning at each other.  Smiles fond and dopey as they moved in sync.  Utterly content in their own little orbit.
are the one who is sweet.”  He responds.  Especially considering the hand job.  But Harry doesn’t say that out loud.  It's not the time.
Mrs. Malfoy is so obviously Draco’s mum.  They’re just alike.  She’s always dressed up and has the same sort of aloof expressions that leaves him feeling uncertain.  Prim, proper, and posh in her every word and movement.  Like one of the fancy witches in the clothing magazines Nan ordered from sometimes.  Smiling but distant.  If Jamie was unsure about Draco at first, Mrs. Malfoy is another level of impassive.  Plus, he usually has the creeping feeling she knows what he’s thinking about.
“Do you like?”  His boyfriend questions huskily.  Face intent and a flash of something uncertain in his dilated eyes.
“I am.”  Harry amusedly returns.  Striding forward to assist Draco getting his shirtsleeve on.  Rubbing the man’s shoulder in greeting as he helps Draco get sorted.
The voice reverberates around them.  Shaking the frames of the solarium violently and causing the glass to shudder even the floor seems to shake.
“Who’s who?” Harry prompts Hermione as they head to the open bar.  It was a game the three of them had invented when they began work at the ministry years ago.  They had been meeting so many people back then it felt like a never-ending onslaught.  The basic premise of the game was that each pointed someone out to the other until they could not name them.  It made Hermione furious when she lost.
“He’s not my dad.”  James replies sharply, sounding cross.  “Draco’s just Dad’s boyfriend who lives with us.”
“Hold up, George.  I know this is a shock, but don’t use me to make a case against Malfoy.”  Bill breaks in, tone reproachful.  “He was a teenager when all that happened, and we know Voldemort was basically holding his parents hostage at the time.  Greyback did this to me - not Malfoy.”  He ends, gesturing to the diagonal scars across his face from the werewolf’s claws.  “I came to terms with that ages ago.”
It is fair play, Draco thinks, to work Harry open slowly.  The opposite of how it was earlier.  Besides, they are celebrating and torturing Harry this way is always pleasant.
Draco as matter of fact as can be, adding, “Astoria was quite keen to leave too considering her greatest motivation in life was to work at a burlesque club with muggles – Mother did not care for that bit of news,” provoking Harry to roar more.  Draco – for he was Draco to Harry at that point – looking on patiently, trying and failing to suppress a pleased grin.
“Draco's real nice.”  Al answers with a nod, head bobbing.  “I like him a lot.  He knows lots about stories and creatures and potions - more than Dad.”
“I will send a letter to our solicitor requesting the seal be broken."  She informed him crisply. "It is time to see what you will do with your inheritance.”
Draco is still firmly against him when his boyfriend ends their kiss.  Staring at him with his pupils blown.  Grey eyes reflecting all the colorful light around them and a solid silver all the same.  Draco’s expression fascinates him.  Entertained, happy, aroused; Harry loves it all.  He wants him.
Lucius looks ghastly.  Draco was prepared for that oddly enough.  Fine, platinum silver hair long and unkempt.  His pale ghost-like frame sharp and thin.  Dark bags under his eyes which appear tired and a bit hazy.  It is his father though.  Draco frowns.  Taking it all in.
Draco’s face screws up at that as if to deny the words.  “Harry.”  The man starts in complaint, circling Harry’s wrists with his hands.  Holding him tightly despite their trembling.
“You said there was someone once, but she died.”  He answers, shaking his head and immediately regretting that choice.
Dad pinches the bridge of his nose where his glasses meet looking unhappy.  Maybe he's getting sick too.  Jamie hopes he won’t get ill.  It'll be okay though; he tries to reassure himself.  Draco’s here and he gives them potions for colds and headaches.  Draco even puts plasters on Lily’s knee when she's not hurt.  Plus, Aunt Audrey will come help if they fire-called her.  She's a healer.
believe the salve is helping.  He notices less achiness and stiffness which is more of a respite than he’d expected.
“I totally agree.”  Pansy concurs with a nod.  “The very thought of being separated from my children for most of the year while they’re at Hogwarts is horrendous.  I'm so glad to hear that McGonagall’s adapted Beaubaton’s more relaxed break schedule.”
“No – not that.”  Harry responds, momentarily distracted.  He had suggested the charm to Draco for the manor restoration.  So far, every time Draco had tried to clear rubble or enter the skeletal remains of the west wing he had been prevented.  Harry tried to help once and was thrown back several yards.  His hands scalded.  Draco insisted on being the only one to attempt magical intervention on the main building after that incident.
Mrs. Weasley’s face is read as she dabs at the corner of her eye.  “I’m sorry.  I didn’t know he was there.  Ginny and I – it’s stupid, but to him, it probably sounded like I don’t like Draco.”
The conference room is nearly filled by the time he arrives.  Most of his squad, a couple trainees, and office staff filling out the rest of the seats.  Twysley, his sergeant, and number two is at the podium preparing for the briefing.
“I was.”  Draco allows, conscious of the guards listening in as he chooses his words.  “I relocated to Britain for work.”
“Oh, yeah.  I did some mad things in my day at Hogwarts – you know that – but I’ve no idea how they managed to pull that off.  Remus said it took them a couple years to sort out how to do it.  I
“Oh, we’re done.”  Pansy says with a huff.  “We’ve had one of each.  No more.  The baby factory is closed.”
“Yes.”  Clearwater assures her underling with a nod, caught up in her own story.  “I’ve never seen him so upset.  It was way worse than the time I accidentally filled that interrogation room with fish.”
If it weren’t for the fact they were hiding Maud, they would have brought her with them when they return to the half pitch.  He feels bad to leave her alone.  She looked so doleful when they left.  Al placed the bacon he filched from breakfast on the bathmat and Jamie left her the quaffle toy they were playing with to appease their guilt.
“There are always consequences, Harry.”  Draco interrupts, getting Harry’s attention.  Eyes still shut.  “Did you really think I would be allowed anywhere near
“You’ll have to let us know how you liked it.”  Hermione says as the four of them stand in the foyer of the Granger-Weasley home, saying their goodbyes.  “I’ve heard the food and the shopping there are superb.”
The Howlers had been hitting Draco’s wards on and off for the last few days.  Resulting in him working from home.  He hoped things would calm by the end of the week and he could go into the office without the fuss of a Howler finding him there and disrupting business.  Otherwise the news had not changed much of his daily life.  It was a minor hassle for him.  The wizarding world by-and-large hated him and he had isolated himself from much of it.
“Draco, I’ve brought Auror Potter here to see about the fire salamander salve trial.”  Hargreeves informs, straight to the point.  Harry’s chart floats over to gently land on the glossy desk set to the side, facing the room.
People shook his dad’s hand a lot because of the war, but Jamie didn’t know all that much about it.  He knew there were some wizarding wars and his dad fought in the last one.  His other grandparents fought in one too and died.  He knew the scar on his dad’s forehead was from it which was partly why Dad kept his dark hair longer.  Dad had other scars too like the big ones on his leg, but Jamie thought maybe those were just from being an auror.
The waiter arrives and delivers their pizzas.  A large cheese and a small spinach and mushroom.  He and Al each get a piece of the cheese as Dad helps Lily with her plate.  Jamie loves the way the gooey cheese gets stringy with every bite.  All the best foods are eaten with hands after all.
“I imagine he would.”  Luna says conversationally.  “You two complement each other which is difficult to do – especially for two unusual people.  And Draco Malfoy is one of the strangest people I’ve ever known.”
“So much of me is bad too.”  He counters.  Willing Draco to understand.  Why this line Draco kept between them made no sense.  “I’ve used Unforgiveable Curses.  My actions have led to people's deaths.  I’ve lied.  I’ve hidden things.  Just because so much of that is sanctioned by being an auror or what I did in the war doesn’t mean I didn’t do it.  That it wasn't cruel or wrong.”
Every disagreement or debate they’ve had before vacillated between irritation and bantering.  The ebb and flow of a couple trying to work together.  Finding their rhythm.  This was different.
“Yeah, a girl in his class told him that Draco was a blood traitor - only we don’t know what that means.”
“I think they’re telling us to take a bath.”  He guesses which is probably right considering how streaked with mud he and Al are.  His brother still has a twig in his hair.  “We’re getting right on that!”  He calls out to the concerned portraits, quickening his pace as they go.
He emits a soft laugh.  Surprised by her candor.  She was never particularly fond of him, but she had always been fair. “It is generous you even considered the possibility of our friendship.”
He cannot imagine his life without any one of them.  His home – his family – had become the five of them.  Him, Harry, and the children.  The unexpected joys of his life.  Albus who shared so many interests with him.  The boy who loved nothing more than learn about the magical world around, to play quidditch with his family, and eat sweets.  Albus who looked the most like Harry.
“What?!”  Ron responds.  “I want to check this bloke out.  See if he’s good enough for our best friend.”
use as prescribed.  Dosage instructions are affixed here.”  Malfoy states indicating the parchment on the underside of the lid, before pushing the box across the desk to Harry.
They furnish the whole place during the course of the week.  Harry does actually end up renting a truck then and helping Malfoy purchase furniture.
Draco meets the children for the first time at a muggle restaurant.  Potter takes his hand under the table when he sits.  Steadying him.  The man knows how unsure Draco is about meeting them.  If it had been up to him, he would likely have never meet them.  Despite how important they are to his boyfriend – or maybe because of that.
“Okay.”  Jamie says, taking in this new information.  Being a blood traitor wasn’t all that bad then.  Maybe being a death eater was the same?  “But Uncle Ron, what’s a death eater, then?”
“Looks aren’t everything, Draco.”  His boyfriend says trying to comfort him and failing when he cracks up at the end.  “I still love you.”
“And what about Ron?”  George points out, waving a hand around.  “He was nearly killed by the prat.  And then there’s Bill.  Greyback got to him because of Malfoy’s actions.  He lives with the scars of that every day!”
“What’s behind that?”  Albus whisper shouts in the way that children do who do not entirely understand the concept of lowering their voice.  “Are you sure it’s okay?”
almost noon.  It’s even sunny outside today which gives him a bit more energy.  So when Malfoy doesn’t answer the first knock on the bedroom door or the second, Harry slowly opens the door further and walks quietly inside.
It is soft when Potter kisses him then.  Draco feels lit up from the inside by it.  No one has ever kissed him like that – like he matters.
It is a small home.  Not at all different or notable from the other cottages dotting the outlying area of the village.  Two bedrooms, bath, kitchen, sitting room, and a small fenced-in garden out back.  There is an unattached garage, but he doubts they will need it.  He casts the Fidelius Charm so that only muggles can see it and remember it.  Anyone magical would see an unoccupied lot filled with mulberry bushes and an oak tree.
“We found her yesterday.”  Jamie grudgingly admits.  “Maud’s the one who’s been digging the holes outside.”
“Al?”  Dad says accusingly, switching gears.  Turning on the heat.  Jamie thinks Al doesn’t have to worry.  Al puts up a good front but –
“I want to ascertain our defense now, before we get caught unawares by another oversight hearing.  Do you really think Draco being an unregistered animagus will go undetected?  That is illegal last I checked.”
Harry’s calloused hand in his own is a grounding warmth.  He feels simultaneously in the past and present here.  Old cities were like that for him sometimes.  It is surprising when Harry gently takes the lead.  Draco thought he would be playing tour guide for the duration of their visit.
He regrets not saying anything before.  It never seemed like the right time.  When the three of them were together over the last few months most of their conversations revolved around schedules, kids, or the ministry.
Draco sighs, frowning.  “I didn't think you were working in that capacity at this point.  Besides, Granger was already there, and she offered.”  He reasons.  It seemed the right move at the time.  He was caught off guard and doing his best to think on his feet.
“Ha.”  Potter returns sarcastically, corner of his mouth lifting.  Expression thoughtful.  “He would help, you know.  Bill forgave you ages ago.”
Malfoy gives him a dirty look, crossing and uncrossing his arms.  Harry smirks in response as Malfoy takes a deep breath, regaining composure.  “For the experimental trials with the fire salamander salve, Potter.  You absolute idiot.”
The silkiness of the feathers trek across his arms as Draco carefully extends one wing.  Harry stares at the iridescent color he finds as the smaller contouring feathers in the wing change in the light.  He traces his finger along the natural line there marveling at the subtle change in texture.
Hermione beams, white teeth gleaming from her almond-toned skin.  Ron grins at them.  They're good friends.  He is lucky to have them.  The thought of dating was ominous enough, but he knew it would be hard for them to navigate too.  He’d seen that firsthand when Ginny began dating again and they had to figure out how to be supportive of her without hurting him.
“Is that all you have to say for yourself, Mr. Malfoy?”  Kingsley asks in his deep voice, causing Malfoy to look up.  Startled.
“Yes.” He answers.  That night at the gala and Ron’s cold fury was fresh in his memory.  “Ron didn’t take it well.”
“I – I ought to tell you something.  You might not like it.”  Draco confesses sounding anxious.  Voice tight making Harry concerned.   His boyfriend pulls away and sits on the edge of the bed, taking their blanket with him and wrapping himself in it.  Back facing him and shoulders tensed.  “In fact, I don’t believe you will like it at all.”
“Is that supposed to make me feel better?”  Draco sputters as he washes his face in the sink.  Harry is in his robe, hands in his pockets.  Openly laughing now.
Things are confusing for some time after that.  He has the vague notion of going in and out of consciousness.  The impression that Harry is nearby each time he wakes stays with him keeping him calm.  Albeit, he is only awake for a few seconds each time.  The paneled ceiling of wherever he is has water stains.  The smell of cleaning solution filling the air.
“She didn’t.”  Harry denies raising an innocent hand.  It’s been months since he’s seen Luna.  The last he saw her she was setting out on a trip to Malaysia with a team of magizoologists.  “It was a guess on my part – truly.  So, how long?”
“Yeah, they got married.”  He confirms nodding.  “They’re busy too of course.  I don’t see them much.  The last couple of years have been, er . . . not too good between us.”
“Well since you ask so nicely.”  Draco replies, finally removing his fingers and wiping them on the duvet.  Harry is so hard it is almost painful for Draco to look at, but the blissed-out expression on Harry’s face motivates him to keep things slow.  As much as Harry liked things fast and rough, he liked them slow too.
“What are you doing?”  Harry questions curiously as he walks into the sitting room at Grimmauld to see his boyfriend sitting on their couch, hunched forward.  He approaches, peering over Draco’s shoulder to discover the man brushing out Lily’s hair, dividing it into distinct sections.  Small yellow hair ties set on the coffee table beside them.
“Oh, uh, I can’t come in the mornings.  I got my kids.”  He explains apologetically.  His schedule is such that he does not often know in advance what time, or even days, he will have off, often scheduling most of his personal appointments on the fly.  He did his best to have weekends off to be with his children, but it was not uncommon for him to be called in.
The last week had been an odd one since the article came out with the picture of Draco and his children at the café.  People at the ministry seemed to be eyeing him and whispering more than usual as he passed by.  He had answered questions succinctly from other people in the department about Draco, stating he and Draco were good friends – that he trusted him around his children. It was what they agreed to say if they were asked about one another by people who were not press.  They were in an ongoing debate about when to issue a statement about their relationship.  One had already been drafted by Harry’s PR agent, but they remained unsure.  Draco felt it was Harry’s decision, given his very public presence.  Harry thought they should choose together.
“He is absolutely adorable.”  Hermione coos.  “Sometimes I miss the baby days, but then I remember the nappies and the no sleeping.  They are adorable though - and those cheeks.”  She says, miming pinching Aaron’s chubby face.  The baby smiles gummily up at her.
“He did?”  Draco asks, embarrassment hanging on.  He can imagine the expressions on Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s faces.  They have been kind to him.  Kinder than he deserves, but he knows that every Weasley is baffled by their relationship.  A lot of people were though the Howlers had slowed over the last few weeks.
On one memorable occasion early on in becoming a tutor, Draco brings out some older issues of Quidditch International that are kept in their library.  Hoping that would garner James’ interest.  It seems to work until it becomes apparent to him that the boy has memorized several of the main articles.
“Not terribly, really.  Although the boys did misbehave.”  Draco answers, observing his boyfriend settling into his seat, getting comfortable.  “Yours?”
“You want me tied up, sweetheart?”  Harry offers in a raspy voice.  Moving off Draco’s nipple with a hard kiss, after sucking it in by his teeth for a moment.  “I’ve got some nice rope just for you.”
“More like who.”  Ron mumbles under his breath.  Everyone hears him anyway, considering they all turn as one to face Harry except Hermione who gawks at her husband.
The man looks up at Harry’s entrance.  Grey eyes studying him as Harry sets the groceries on the counter.  “Can you cut my hair?”  He asks and Harry isn’t fool enough to reject an olive branch when he sees one.
Draco stares at her.  Taken off guard.  His instinct is to thank her.  Can he thank his boyfriend’s ex-wife for complimenting his relationship?  Is that rude?  This was the part in those novels of Astoria’s he secretly read that the former lover and the current lover would be at each other’s throats.
“Good.”  She states coolly, hand cocked on her hip.  “Draco has moved on in his life and he's a good person, believe it or not.”
“Harry, over here!”  Hermione calls out, waving him over.  Her dark hair is in twists this evening and looks lovely against her gold dress and gossamer, russet colored robes.  Ron complements her outfit in his own rich brown robes and navy suit.  They look sharp.  Harry smiles and gives a slight wave as he heads over.  Hermione had been invited tonight like Harry thought.  Any invites he received she mostly did as well.  She was a prominent official in the DMLE, not to mention a renowned war hero.
Hermione raises a critical eyebrow at him.  “So you can make the connection between what pajamas he wears and sexual receptivity, but you couldn’t take it the step further that perhaps Draco wasn’t in the mood to discuss the war?”  Hermione remarks giving him a disappointment look.
“A position that still requires some political maneuvering.”  Narcissa insists.  “You forget that I am an old hand at the inner workings of ministerial politicking.”
“I might.  Let me think on it.”  Draco replies.  There were still some contacts he had in the dark antiquities world who he would like to consult with about another possible course of action.  He may work more in potions now but his education in dark objects was often useful.
“NO!”  Lily sobs, red-faced from crying, lying on the rug running through the foyer.  The three backpacks on the floor beside her flapping up and down, reacting to her distress.  It was not uncommon for Lily’s wobblies to lead to accidental magic.  “No, Draco!  Don’t go!”  She wails.
Harry guffaws at that, glancing over to share an amused look with Draco.  His boyfriend sighs instead expression put upon.  Harry kisses his cheek to cheer him up.  Draco scowls at that but doesn't move away from Harry’s arm around his waist.
He and Draco reach for each other before he can tell who started and then they’re hugging.  His arms tightening around his boyfriend and burying his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, breathing deeply before the lump in his throat threatens to overwhelm him.
“Hello.”  A tall, dark haired man greets suddenly.  Head popping into the opening of the ajar door above the woman’s head.  Jamie rears back in surprise and nearly slams the door in both their faces.
“He is.”  Draco confirms, smiling softly.  He still found himself astonished to have a boyfriend.  Harry had filled his life in places he never knew he was lonely in.
“Draco was a talented bartender . . . eventually.”  Simone explains to Harry as Astoria giggles into her cloth serviette.  “It was challenging for him to manage all the drink orders and customers’ attention and that is very common at first.  He was also rather afraid of the blenders for a time, but once he overcame those obstacles, he was fabulous.”
Jamie frowns at the exchange.  Out of the corner of his eye he sees Al doing the same.  Draco seemed snappier the longer Dad was gone.  He couldn’t blame Draco in a way.  He missed Dad too.  Him and Al excuse themselves as quickly as possible after that, but not so quick so that Draco would suspect they were up to something.  Merlin knows, he and his brother never left breakfast while bacon rashers were still on the table.
He knows Draco appreciates the exercise.  That the man jogs a couple times during the week to stay in shape.   Harry mostly likes it because it allows him to surveil the perimeter of the village without any fuss.  Some people’s faces are beginning to become familiar to him.  A few older women even wave in greeting at Draco as they pass with his jogging partner nodding in return.
No one had ever asked him that directly.  He had worked diligently to bury that part of himself once he realized.  Hoping to keep
