“Pushing all my magic towards her and the baby, trying to sooth them and make them realize they’re safe.” Draco stated.
Draco panted as he rested his forehead against Harkin’s and slipped out of her, and Draco sat down in one of the chairs that were left standing and pulled Harkin into his lap. “You might want to clean up our mess before your mother figures out what happened.” Harkin muttered into Draco’s neck, and she felt as Draco moved his arm and Harkin felt as the magic washed over her. Harkin sighed, and melted into Draco’s embrace. “Where did you throw my knickers?” Harkin asked with a sigh.
“Well, we’re heading back to the Manor, Sirius, if you wish to join us for dinner. Both you and Remus, or anyone else is invited, if you wish to join.” Narcissa offered, and Sirius looked over to see her, Lucius, and Severus standing by the door.
“In trouble. Voldemort is currently dead, but if we don’t find and destroy the last item that we are looking for Voldemort can find Harry and possess him and live for another sixty to seventy years or however long he could live while riding Harry as a prisoner in his own mind. We know the item is here in the castle, we just don’t know where. So we are staying here until we find it.”
The next morning Harry woke up in Draco’s arms, and he was wide awake watching her sleep. “Morning,” she whispered, and he kissed the top of her head. “Did you sleep at all last night?”
“Can you allow them access? They won’t stop until they know I’m alright.” Harry said as he turned slightly in Draco’s arms to look at him.
“Agreed, Neville.” Ron said as he patted Neville on the back. “Good seeing you, Neville.”
“I don’t know for sure. It’s different for each case. Draco will probably bounce back rather quickly given that Harkin was the one that was poisoned.” Severus explained, and then Draco woke up coughing and retching. Severus grabbed Harkin off of his lap and onto the bed next to his, while Draco appeared to retch up black ooze.
“I’m just going to take her up to our room, so she can sleep comfortably. I’ll come and get you if she asks for you.” Draco stated, and Remus nodded. Draco carried her out of the room and up the stair to their bedroom. He laid her down gently on their bed, and he curled up on the bed, pulling her into his side. He stayed up just watching her sleep, and he brushed his fingers over her cheeks to whip away the tears that stained her cheeks.
“How long?” Harry mouthed.
The next morning when Draco woke up he grabbed his toiletry bag and hurried to the shower before and of his dorm mates could steal the shower from him. He climbed into the shower and quickly showered so he could head up to breakfast since he didn’t eat the night before. Draco climbed out of the shower and semi dried off and pulled on a pair of boxers before he walked out of the bathroom as he dried his hair. Not expecting anyone else to be awake yet, he ran into someone and when he pulled the towel away from his face his eyes met Blaise’s.
“What do you think Ron is telling people right now, or at least Hermione?”
“About what happened at Nott’s? Who told you?” Draco swallowed. He didn’t realize he w’s looking at her any different.
“Potter, shut it. Lucius Malfoy put a tracking charm on you, at least that’s what I think he did because all he gave me was your name since I’m pretty sure you didn’t tell him you three were here,” Tonks stated. She cast a spell that could detect any other spells that could be present on Harry, and when she found a certain set of spells that were found she removed them from Harry. Then Harry fainted, and Draco rushed forward and caught him.
Okay, so this isn't the end, but I'm going to start a set of prequels to this story. i feel as if I'm explaining events that happened in previous years too much. So I'm going to start with book 1 and work my way back up to this story, and then maybe tweak this story if it doesn't exactly line up with the others. I will try my hardest to work my way around having to edit too much on this story, but you know how things happen.
“Oh, that is easy.” Madam Pomfrey pulled out her wand and cast a Patronus and sent it off with a message. Draco then had no choice but to stay, so he sat down and waited for Granger to show up. It didn’t take long as a few minutes later she came running in the hospital wing.
“The next Malfoy heir is not going to be raised by a Weasley, and Harry knows I won’t allow that to happen. I think she will be fine with you raising our baby. The two of you have been growing closer, and she likes you, mum.”
“And before?” Draco wasn’t sure if he wanted to hear the answer, but he knew that he had to know. Harry looked him in the eyes, and he gave Draco a little smirk.
“It’s fine, Draco. I can’t change that. Hermione, Draco and I are…” Harry started, but then soon realized that she didn’t know how to describe her and Draco, and she stuttered. “Draco and I are…”
“Ah, I understand completely. Yes, how does 6pm sound?”
“You found me?” Harry whispered as she looked at the bouquet of Snapdragons and Lilies. “Do you know what the meaning to these flowers are? Snapdragons mean graciousness and strength, while lilies mean purity and refined beauty. What are you trying to tell me, Draco?” Harry asked with a smile.
“She nearly died, Weasley. She was bit by the snake in an attempt to save your father, and she almost died. The difference between her bit and your father’s is he had medical treatment right away, and she didn’t have any. The only reason she survived past yesterday was because I came home for break and brewed some potions that saved her life. Your best friend wouldn’t be here today, because she tried to save your father, Weasley and he would have survived. How do you feel about this now?” Draco stated as he pushed Harry behind him and stepped closer to Ron.
The room was about the size of the boy’s dormitory with one Queen sized bed in the middle. There were two doors off the room, and Harry walked over to the one door and found a bathroom, and in the other was a closet. “Thank you, Professor.” Harry said as he turned and hugged her.
“We’ll deal with it, dragon.” Narcissa stated as she pulled him into her arms. “We’ll deal with it.” She whispered. Draco leaned into her and her ended up falling asleep for a few hours. Healer Johnson and Severus walked back in, and Narcissa held her fingers up to her lips. “Let him sleep.”
Eventually everyone started moving again. Ron tried to pick a fight with Draco, but Ginny smacked him on the back of the head and pulled him into a carriage, apologizing to Draco as she went. “It’s not you who should apologize.” Draco stated as he climbed into a different carriage. Finally, everyone was up at the castle, and Harkin was already seated at the Gryffindor table worrying about Draco when Ron walked in before him. Hermione apologized again, and she pulled Harkin closer and rubbed her back. “Stress isn’t good for you, Harry.” Hermione soothed as Ron sat down next to her. Hermione felt as the air started to chill around them, and she looked around the room for Draco. Their eyes met as Draco walked into the Great hall, and he immediately started fast walking to Harkin. Draco could feel her cold slowly seep into the room, but it didn’t affect him like everyone else. He could tell Hermione was barely able to touch Harkin to keep her as calm as she was. Draco finally reached her and placed his hand on her back.
Draco will be returning to Hogwarts this fall for an extended year as newly appointed Headmistress Minerva McGonagall has offered an extended year to all the students that should have finished their N.E.W.T.s this past spring. A majority of the students are returning, but it is still unknown if Harry Potter is to return or not.
“Uncle Sev?” Draco questioned as he was concerned about his godfather.
“Technically, no. I’m courting you, Potter. Though I do have to say yesterday shouldn’t have happened since I was going to court you.”
“Now, move slowly, please,” Draco said at almost a whisper, and Harry started moving his hips slowly, and he continued working on Draco’s neck. Harry slid his one hand into Draco’s hair, and the other slid underneath Draco and down his back coming to stop right above his hips. Harry lifted Draco’s waist a little, and Draco moaned with the next thrust. “Right there. Yes!” Draco screamed which Harry wasn’t expecting, so he continued the movement. Draco was panting in Harry’s ear. “Harry, I’m going to…” Draco scream was cut off by cum splattering their abdomens.
“I told you not to do something, and you did it anyway. Please, Draco, tell me that this won’t be happening often, because I really don’t want to have to find some other place for us to stay, because you and Harry couldn’t keep it in your pants. My sister may be alright with you being with Harry, but that doesn’t mean that I want her knowing that you two are have sex every night. Nymphadora informed me that she walked in on the two of you earlier.”
“I can’t go, because if I do I will be arrested and sent to Azkaban.”
Harry turned towards Ron again and said, “No, Ron I could imitate Molly when I was a bloke and I’m pretty sure the twins can do it as well. Right, George?” Harry asked as she turned towards the one twin at the table.
“What? No, I’m not telling anyone why I just stormed out of the room. I’m embarrassed, and I don’t know why I’m so effected by this, but I don’t want everything to be out there where everyone knows. People look at people differently when they know certain things about said person. I don’t want people to look at me like that; I don’t like it when people look at me like that. It makes me feel like I’m belittled and breaks down my self-esteem. I can handle curiosity I can’t handle pity. I don’t like pity.”
“Yeah.” Hermione walked out of the room, and Harry was left alone in the Hospital Wing. Harry looked around for his wand but saw it nowhere in sight. Maybe Hermione had it or it was back in his room. That’s when something came to him. The eighth years had their own dorms and he shared a room with Draco Malfoy. Was that why Draco was here, and why he helped Hermione? Were he and Draco friends or trying to be friends? Hermione soon came back with Ginny, interrupting his thought as his eyes landed on Ginny. She had changed so much since he last remembered her.
“Well,” Harkin started, and Draco gave her a funny look.
“How?” Hermione asked.
“Yes, he’s fine. Just talk to him, and he can explain it, Professor.” Hermione said as she walked to the Gryffindor table but Pansy Parkinson stepped in front of her. “Yes, Pansy.”
“Dumbledore faked my death, cousin. Now, if you please. Come with me.”
“Do you have a photographic memory, darling?”
“Why would I stop being your friend just because your aunt and uncle treat you like shit, Harry? If anything that would make me want to be your friend more, not less.” Draco could see the confusion slip through Harry’s expression, like that wasn’t the response that he always received from people claiming to be his friends. That’s when it dawned on Draco. “Harry, have you ever had a true friend before? A friend that didn’t leave you to fend off your family when they found out who you were related to?” Harry just looked down at the floor again and shook his head no.
“Like a balloon. She wasn’t really his aunt she was his uncle’s sister and she kind of deserved it; she was making comments about his parents mostly his mum.”
“Yes, Madam.”
Her husband was never going to see them again she was going to guarantee that, even if Lucius had to go to Azkaban. After what Lucius told Narcissa, she wasn’t going to allow him to see the boys, and she was going to talk to Professor Dumbledore about not allowing Lucius to see Draco or Harry. Even if Harry wasn’t her son, Narcissa really did care about him like he was a second son, and now that Draco and Harry were together, it was even more pertinent for her to keep both of her boys safe. When she finally finished planning the trip, and she told the boys they were thrilled to hear that the trip was still on, but they were still a little concerned.
“I’m Draco Malfoy, and this is Harry Potter,” Draco said as looked up at Tonks. She took a sudden step back and leaned into the door way.
“Harry…” Draco whispered, not knowing how to tell her about the spells he forgot about and her possible pregnancy.
Harry rolled over so he was straddling Draco’s hips. “Well, Draco, if you are going to tease me. Then you have to, because now I’m not tired at all.” Draco pulled Harry down and locked lips with Harry, and then he pushed his tongue through Harry’s lips and rolled over on top of Harry.
“A what?” Harry asked with confusion, but Voldemort pulled back his sleeve and put a finger to his Dark Mark.
“Gentlemen, let us talk this up to the hospital wing so Mr. Malfoy can get looked at by Madam Pomfrey.” McGonagall stated as she grabbed Ron by the upper arm and dragged from the hall. Pansy helped Draco as Dumbledore trailed behind them. They walked up the few flights of stairs to the Hospital wing and Draco was escorted to a bed by Pansy and Madam Pomfrey.
“Yes, now place the little boy in the crib.” Harry did as he was told, and then he walked over to Andromeda’s desk and picked up her quill and a piece of parchment. Luckily, Andromeda still had her invisible ink that only she could see. So Harry started his letter.
“It’s done,” she said, and then she continued, “How much of his memory do you think he lost?”
“Yes, Potter. It is, my wife loved torture.” Harry bit his tongue as the pain coursed through his veins like fire. “Hurts doesn’t it.” He then picked up another knife that looked identical to the first one and threw it, and it impaled in Harry’s other shoulder. Harry could feel as the knife had the same effect only this one coursed across his skin. He felt like his was burning from the inside out, the pain rippling through him.
“Potter, if you’re going to make that much noise what was the point in hiding in the nook.” Harry rolled her eyes at the voice. How had Malfoy even known that she was out and about?
“Trust me. I won’t let you fall or embarrass yourself.” Draco smiled, and Harkin just nodded. Draco took her hand and pulled her onto the dance floor with ease. He pulled her to his chest, and he placed one hand on her waist and the other in her hand. Harkin gently placed her hand on his shoulder, and he leaned in to whisper in her ear. “Just follow me and pay no attention to anyone else.” Draco then turned towards the band in the corner of the room and gave a gentle nod, and the music started, and he immediately started pulling her around the dance floor. Harkin was surprised to find that it was easy with Draco, and when she focused on him and only him, everything was easy. They glided around the dance floor, and it wasn’t until the music stopped and everyone clapped at their performance that Harkin noticed everyone staring at them.
“You are growing.” She whispered to him, and they went back to their meal, and eventually everyone else slowly did too. The meal went by rather quickly after that, and then everyone moved to the ballroom, and the Malfoy family started the dance off with a dance. Lucius and Narcissa and Draco and Harkin.
“Harry, Narcissa will be teaching you how to be a wife in the Malfoy family. I understand she is doing this already, but we will be speeding up your lessons.”
“Actually the royals stole courting from pureblood families, but since you were raised in a muggle family, yes. Actually the Malfoy family is the reason why the royals started courting back in the day. They usually just had arranged marriages but one of my very great uncles had a thing with, I believe, the first Queen Elizabeth; he tried to court her, but it was a failed attempt to win her love in the end, as he courted her others that were there to win her heart saw what my uncle was doing and copied him, not including the magic of course, so something was always missing but they adapted it in their own ways and one eventually found her heart with my uncle methods.”
“Has that ever happened before?” she asked, and he shook his head no as his fingers brushed across her bare arms.
“The baby is yours; I doubled and triple checked. Your bond is still there; it’s just not trying to kill the three of you anymore.”
After she finished talking, she walked upstairs to the fourth floor of the house, which is the only livable part of the house at that moment, and Harry followed her up the stairs with Teddy stirring in his arms. Harry took Teddy into his bedroom and laid Teddy in his crib next to Harry’s bed. His hair now bright pink as his eyes fluttered open, different from the greyish white that it was when he was sleeping.
“Yes, Malfoy.” Harry said, and the sass just dribbled out of her mouth. Malfoy just stared at Harry with something that Harry couldn’t detect because she has never seen it in Malfoy's eyes before. “I’m waiting, Malfoy.”
“What happened?”
“Yes, as long as they don’t do anything that they shouldn’t, they should be able to share a room. I am being completely serious, Andy.” Narcissa looked at her sister, and she looked completely serious. Andromeda looked shocked at first, and then she reached her hand out to Draco, taking his hand.
“Dray…” Harry moaned, and her fingernails dug into his shoulders. Draco slipped his fingers out and quickly pushed himself inside her heat.
“I already came to terms with that, Professor. I understand.”
Finally, Harry pulled Malfoy to a stop, and she said, “Malfoy, I’m not moving until you tell me where we are going.”
“Why don’t you ask him when he gets here?”
Draco smirked as he kissed the side of her jaw and kissed his way up to her mouth, and she rolled her hips to let him know she was ready. Draco slowly started rolling his hips in a rhythmic way, and Harry started moving her hips in sync with Draco. Harry moaned as Draco hit just the right spot, and Draco’s arms wrapped around Harry’s waist as she shifted her weight on Draco’s lap, creating a different angle for Draco who moaned as she started sucking on the side of his neck. Harry gasped as Draco shifted and he came inside her, and she melted into his for support. Draco wrapped his arms around her and held her to his chest.
“Harry, no. Come on, Love. Don’t leave me now. You’re stronger than this.” Draco pulled out his wand and cast a warming charm around the entire bathroom and dorm room. “You are going to be alright, Love. You hear me.” Draco said as he scooped Harry up and carried him to the bed. Draco yanked back the sheets and all the plates clattered to the floor. Draco set Harry on the bed and pulled his clothes off and then he slipped Harry out of his. He crawled into the bed next to Harry and pulled the sheets over them and pulled Harry against him as close as he could wrapping completely around Harry as tightly as he could.
“That explains the dreams that Harry has, and how she knows things about what he’s doing.”
“I’ll write a note to Professor Snap about your tardiness, and Miss Potter not appearing today. I shall be right back, if you will watch her for a moment longer.”
Harry and Draco started gathering their clothes and pulling them on. When they were finally dressed, Draco pulled his school trunk out of his closet and started packing his clothes. Harry went into the other room and brought his trunk out and Hedwig. Narcissa then waved her wand and Harry’s trunk and Draco’s trunks disappeared, and then Narcissa took Draco’s and Harry’s hands and they also disappeared. When the reappeared, they were standing in the doorway of a house that Harry has never seen before.
“Yes, he has a very nice home now with Sirius.” Harkin smiled.
Teddy was just like Harry, and he now understood what Hermione was saying. Harry came to the same conclusion Teddy was more important than a relationship right now. Harry needed to grieve before he thought about a relationship with Ginny. Harry could feel the little boy’s hands patting his cheeks and Harry lifted his face to look at the little boy. The little boy in his arms patted the tears running down Harry’s cheek and Harry started chuckling. This little boy is the thing that returned him to present day. The torture he endured to save the little boy and his grandmother; the dark magic that infected him slowly draining him of his magic and energy.
“That is not funny, fawn. I can think of several times. One time includes the night we met. Going up against a werewolf who has not taken their potion can get you killed.” Sirius stated.
“And you aren’t.”
“Yes, I’d love to.” Harkin whispered as she stood up, and Draco stood to follow her.
Draco walked through the front door and stood in front of a stair case and a hallway that ran parallel to each other. “Draco, you can take Harry up to the room on the second landing first door on the left.” Draco followed Sirius’ instructions, and opened the door to find their trunks already in the room for them. Draco set Harry down on the only bed in the room, and Draco wondered if Sirius knew about him and Harry, or not. Draco pulled the covers over Harry and then he laid down on the bed next to Harry, and he must have fallen asleep.
“Potter, can you stop walking and just talk to me?” Malfoy asked, and Harry stopped and quickly turned around whipping Malfoy in the face with her ponytail.
“I should probably head to class as well. I’m technically not a patient.”
“Thank you.” Harkin whispered as the tears slid down her face, and she held the two older men to her. “I love you, guys.” Harkin whispered.
“Yeah, okay. That sounds good. Are you sure?”
“You were never a problem, dragon. I enjoyed watching you grow into the man you are now, and I’m going to enjoy watching you become a great father and husband. Now go see to your fiancée, she needs you more than me.”
“For Ginny and hoping that she understands why I can’t be with her and finds someone that deserves her in every way possible.” Harry said as he pushed memories towards Voldemort revolving around Ginny. The moment when he saved her in the Chamber of secrets, her dancing with Neville at the Yule Ball, her in D.A. showing off and being better than all of her brothers at fighting, every moment that they had shared together during last year.
“Dray…my handsome dragon…mmm…” Harkin muttered dreamily as she leaned into Draco, and he chuckled. “My handsome…handsome dragon…you are going to be…be the death of me…” Harkin attempted, and Draco stood up pushing the chair to the ground, and he placed her on the table. Draco slipped his hands up Harkin’s dress to the waistband of her knickers, and he pulled them off and unbuttoned his trousers, and slipping inside Harkin’s heat.
“My wife’s collection. You remember my wife, yes. Bella was such a lovely woman, but now she’s gone.” Harry made a gulping noise as he realized what was going to happen.
“I know, I’m just saying you more than just stubborn, because you get it from both sides.” Sirius stated, and Harkin laughed again as she wrapped her arms around his neck.
“But will it cheer him up?”
“Well, it worked. I don’t need it; I got a new one in June. Mother took me for my birthday. I do appreciate the thought though, Potter. You could keep this to be honest, it doesn’t work very well for me anymore.”
“Yeah, I just…after what I did…Arthur…” Harry attempted, and Hermione pulled her into another hug.
“He didn’t need that, it would only just make him angrier, and then he would never actually get over whatever it is that he is angry about. He needed to see that I am still his friend if that is what he wants. Though it is going to be different this time, he can’t get away with his old shit this time.” Harkin stated as she glared at Ron, before turning her attention back to Ginny. “But I am fine, at least I will be when I get this bruise to go away.” Harkin smiled as Madam Pomfrey reentered the room with the paste in hand, and she handed it to Harkin without a beat. Harkin smiled at her and whispered, “Thank you.”
The next few months were long and tiring; between the morning sickness that didn’t just last in the morning, which Harkin didn’t understand why it was called morning sickness if it could last all day, and the new homework load, and planning the wedding, which Narcissa was mostly doing, and then there was the endless studying for their OWLs at the end of the year. Harkin was also worrying about the weight that she was gaining; she understood that because she was pregnant, she was going to gain weight, and because she was pregnant with twin, of the sort, she was going to gain weight faster, but she was concerned about others finding out before the wedding.
“Ah, Black is here.” Severus said as he walked out of the exam room.
“Lucius’ drawing room is the most private room in the Manor other than bedrooms. The house elves won’t bother us there.” Narcissa said as she started moving towards the stairs, and everyone followed. Nagini closely following Harry. They reached the drawing room in complete silence, and when the door was shut Narcissa sat down on one of the couches and Harry moved to sit by her when she was pulled back to one of the chairs across the room. Narcissa looked up in horror as Lucius sat down next to her.
“Someone is still after us?” Draco questioned, slightly furious. “How? Everyone should be locked away by now.”
“Thank you, Healer Johnson. Everything is alright then? I’m not going to like implode or something?”
“Alright, what do you need me to do?” He pulled her over to the couch, and he started explaining the plan. Soon it was almost sunset, and Voldemort looked out the window and saw what time it was.
“Harry, you have to come back with us this year. Minerva said that it would be worth it to go back. Ron and I are going with or without you, Harry,” Hermione stated as she sat cross legged on the floor in the library of Grimmauld Place.
Draco looked over at Narcissa and she nodded at him as if through some quiet communication. “I have something that I want to tell you, and I hope you don’t mind doing this for me.”
“All of it. I met Andromeda in the hall, and she recognized me immediately. So we talked, and then she said she had to get here to talk to you, so I let her and followed behind her. I wanted to see what would happen. I do like the results, other than the crying, but I like the way that when you saw Teddy it reminded you of everything you were missing in your memories. You are going to be a great parent one day, Potter. I hope that I can see that, and our kids will be able to live civilly.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, it’s not cold. Severus, what is going on?” Draco asked as he looked up from Harry to his godfather. Snape’s eyes widened.
“Why didn’t you just kill me?”
“Bring him with me. What else would I do?” Draco asked as he stroked Harry’s hair back out of his face. “I wouldn’t leave him here, where I couldn’t keep him safe.” Draco said as his attention was focused on Harry.
“Yeah, Ron. I’m a girl, and if you try and get in my knickers I will punch you in the face, because you are my best mate. Understand, Ron?”
“Immobulus.” Harry stopped moving, and she moved her eyes to land on the ‘Draco Malfoy’ in front of her. “You are going to listen and do everything that I ask you too. You are going to ask no questions, and you most definitely not going to try and signal your friends somehow. That Patronus you sent already has me move up my timeline a little bit. I don’t want to hurt you, but if you do something that puts me in a situation where I have to I will. I am only doing this because I have to I really don’t want to Harry. My father is making me do this, I swear.”
“Unfortunately.” Draco drawled.
“Yeah, what are they calling you now. Harmony?” Harry looked up to see Pansy Parkinson standing with her arms crossed leaning up against the wall.
“No, Harry. It’s just you look a lot like your mother only with brown hair and your father’s nose.” McGonagall said, and Harry didn’t know how to respond to that. “Never mind, let’s go before the shops close.” McGonagall walked them over to the fireplace, and they stepped through to Madam Malkin’s Robe Shop. “Madam Malkin, would it be possible to get some new robes measured, please. This young lady here needs some robes.”
“I don’t really, but I had a conversation with a very observant young man, and with the information I know I feel the pieces fit together, ma’am.”
“I can. I don’t know everything, but I do know the gist of what is wrong.” Draco stated. “But you might want to sit down properly, Mother.” Draco insisted, and Narcissa gave Draco a look of shock and pulled the chair from the end of the table and pulled it next to Harkin. Narcissa reached out to hold her hand, and Harkin willingly took her hand.
“Hey, in my defense it was Dumbledore’s idea. Mione and I just followed through with it. I saved lives don’t judge.”
“Mel, what is going on?” Severus asked as he looked from Draco to Harkin and then to Melody.
“Yeah, Harry. You defeated him on May 2nd. You’ve been living at Grimmauld Place with Andromeda and Teddy.” Hermione stopped when she realized what she had said. She just sat up straighter and looked up at Madam Pomfrey. “Can you get Professor McGonagall to get Andromeda here with Teddy, please? I think she would be the best person to explain this to him.”
“Mr. Malfoy, are you alright?”
“We don’t blame you, it wasn’t your fault.” Hermione said as she grabbed Harry’s free hand and pulled her into the room and therefore Draco since he was holding Harry’s other hand.
Everyone was sitting in the Great Hall after Harry walked out, when a silver doe appeared in the entrance to the great hall, and then Harry’s voice was coming out of the doe. “Ron, Hermione, Draco help, plea-” but the rest of the statement was cut off by a high pitched blood curdling scream. Ron, Hermione, and Draco were on their feet instantly running from the hall, while everyone else was covering their ears as the scream continued to echo throughout the hall. Finally, Dumbledore got his wand raised to remove the noise from the hall.
“When do you go back to Hogwarts?”
“I love it. It captures my Father’s name very femininely. Harkin Jamelynn Potter. I like it.” Harry said as she sat down in Draco’s lap.
“That was amazing.” Draco whispered when he finally pulled away to breath, and he started pulling his clothes on. Harry grabbed his vest and pulled it over her dress, and she slipped her panties into Draco’s trouser pocket and took his hand. The stepped out of the alcove to find Narcissa and Lucius standing at the end of the row. “Mum, Dad.” Draco said as Harry pulled him past them, and then Harry stopped and turned towards them.
“Lucius, is a Death Eater. He probably has an arsenal of ways that he could have found us. One being a tracking spell on one of us, another being people. He is really good at convincing people to tell him the information that he wants to know. If you really want to know ask him if he is still here.” Narcissa went back to examining Draco and Harry, and Tonks walked out of the room, Draco assumed to go talk to Lucius.
Harry sat up and looked down at the scratch marks from her nails on his back, and she slowly brushed her fingers against the bloodied skin. The scratches then started to knit together, and she stared at them. “We can heal each other.” She whispered in.
“Your eyes. No one has eyes as green as you do it’s rather hard to miss. What are you doing here, Harry?” Arthur asked, and Harry hoped her lie was good enough.
“Don’t tell them, please. Don’t tell anyone.” Harry pleaded.
“Would you listen to me, please?” Harkin shouted. “She cleared me because she knows exactly what’s wrong and how to fix it.”
“Magic, dear. Everything in this room has an accelerated blooming. Each plant has their own cycle, unique in and of themselves anything that can be harvested and sold. The profits going into the Malfoy vaults.”
“Does anyone not realize that she is probably is just trying to stay alive. The only reason she is alive right now is because she is helping keep the Dark Lord from dying. The minute that is done is the minute every one of us becomes a target. She is just trying to survive until we figure out how to save her. She doesn’t know what to do and all her friends are turning on her. How would you feel is she did the same to all of us? We don’t even know where she is.”
“Pin you to the desk? I was a man until a couple hours ago, and I’ve been a seeker for five years, Malfoy.” Harry placed his hands on Malfoy’s shoulders and pushed him back against the desk so he was lying on it like Harry was. Harry then straddled his waist and rolled her hips.
“It’s alright, Narcissa. Draco is just being overprotective of me, I will be fine. I can take care of myself, but Draco insists that he protect me from certain things,” Harry said as he gave Draco a look, and Draco caught the scold that Harry was giving him out of the corner of his eye.
“Yes, now hurry and look for Harry, if she is in danger, we need to get to her quick. We don’t know who’s got her, why they’ve got her, and what they are doing to her right now?” Ron said as he started searching the map for Harry’s name, and when they found it, they had no idea how they were going to get to her, they watched as someone they didn’t expect walked her off of Hogwarts grounds and disappeared.
“Thank you, Mipsy.” Harkin whispered, and the elf bowed again and took Harkin’s hand and led her to the bathroom, where she started on her hair, and then moved to Harkin’s make-up. When Mipsy was finished, Harkin looked in the mirror and couldn’t believe her eyes. She looked beautiful, more beautiful than she ever expected she could look.
“Its fine, cub, and to answer your question. Sirius is the same way. Not with the blaming so much, but he can be this romantic sweetheart one moment and the next he’s an arse as you said. Sometimes you just have to take the small moments and try your best to help them understand what to say and act at certain times.” Remus stated, and Harkin looked up at him. “And sometimes men can just be oblivious. They just don’t realize how insensitive they can be.” Remus finished.
Draco chuckled and chucked it back on the bed; he’d read it later. Draco walked to his bathroom and stripped down to nothing and stepped into the shower behind Harry.
Harry turned around and saw Ron was staring at her. “What? Why does everyone keep staring at me?” Harry look back and forth between Ron and Hermione. “Do I have something on my face, or on my clothes? What?”
“Merlin, the way you say my first name. It’s intoxicating.” Draco turned towards the side and started nibbling on the side of Harry’s neck. Harry moaned, and resting her arms around Draco’s shoulders pulling him closer. Draco took a step forwards, and he gently pushed Harry back against the desk. Harry pulled Draco back with her and slipped her hand down from Draco’s shoulder to his waist. Draco’s hands slipped up Harry’s thigh and under her shirt, and he slipped her shirt off. “You make a gorgeous woman, Potter. Not that you weren’t a handsome man…” Draco whispered against Harry’s lips before he closed the rest of the distance between their lips.
“Okay, I’ll be downstairs making breakfast.” Harry walked downstairs and past his trunk at the bottom of the stair where Andromeda levitated it downstairs the night before. He walked to the kitchen where he placed Teddy in his height chair, and pulled ingredients from the cabinet, and he started making food. By the time that he was done Andromeda was sitting in one of the chairs at the table.
“Interesting, I don’t remember seeing your name on the schedule for tonight’s rounds, Mr. Weasley.” Severus stated.
“So Potter was turned into a girl, how fortunate. May I ask how it happened, Theo?”
“Oh, really I don’t see that going well, love.” Draco said as he slipped two fingers inside of her and her eyes rolled back in her head as she closed her eyes.
“You two stop what you are doing.” Severus said as he pulled Harry’s chair backwards. The temperature automatically dropped, only it dropped farther than it was as Harry stood up.
“Families? But the Malfoy’s and Snape are the only ones out there.” Harry questioned.
“Mother, why are you standing there like that? What is going on?” The woman just stood there like she was waiting for them to move. “Mother?” Draco questioned.
“Where did you learn that, darling?”
“Tally, Mistress Harkin has lost her knickers, and they are somewhere in this room. Can you find them for me?” Draco smiled, and the elf nodded and went to looking for her knickers.
“Harry, if this was going to be a one-time thing, I would not have done it with my best friend. Plus I’ve already been down the gay road with my parents, I told my mother that I also like guys, so I’m hoping that this will be less of a shock to them than that.” Draco slowly leaned in and kissed Harry. Harry struggled at first but the minute Draco slipped his tongue into Harry’s month Harry stopped struggling and started kissing Draco back.
“I know, cub. You’ll figure it out, and we’re here for you if you need to talk to us. I am also sure that Lucius and Narcissa will be willing to talk if you want to talk as well. Now I think it is time that we head in and have dinner.”
“Though I would love to sit at the Gryffindor table, I feel that the Slytherins protect their own more and don’t judge as much. Plus, you’re the Ice Prince, they worship you. The Gryffindors haven’t been as excepting as I thought they would about this, and I don’t want to deal with them right now.” Harkin stated, and Draco nodded.
“How could you even tell? She was completely Ginny like.” Ron stated.
“What is it now Mr. Malfoy? A sprained wrist.” Pomfrey stated as she walked out of her office and the she saw Harry dangling from his arms. “Oh, my dear child. Bring her over here and place her on this bed. What happened?”
“Where are we going?” Harkin asked.
“Yes, Draco.” Harry’s fingers laced into the hair at the back of Draco’s neck twirling his fingers around it.
“Yeah, Harry.”
“Oh, okay. Just wondering.” That’s when Rodolphus raised his wand and cast the first spell, and of course, it was the Cruciatus curse. Harry jerked and clamped his jaw shut as the spell zapped through him, and Harry did his best not to scream because that was what he wanted. Harry just had to hold out until the Aurors arrived, not knowing how long that was going to be though, was what was killing Harry.
“Dray, it’s beautiful.” She whispered, and Draco took the ring and slipped it on her ring finger. “I love it.” She leaned forwards and captured his lips, and that was when Sirius and Remus walked into the dining room holding hands.
“Do you think those are a good idea, mum? Harry being a half-blood.” Draco asked. “Those women are more brutal than some of the pureblood men we know.”
“Thanks, Remy.” Harkin whispered, and Remus pulled her into a hug.
“No, don’t be. You make it more fun and made me want to work to be better and learn new tricks.” Harkin stated.
“I love you too, Har, and I can’t lose you, not to my father.” Draco whispered after he pulled away and rested his forehead against hers.
“We will be right out, mother.” Draco leaned back down and kissed Harry on the lips quickly, and then he pulled Harry’s collar up a little bit to hide the new hickey that Draco created on his neck. “We don’t want them to suspect anything, do we?” Draco leaned back in and kissed Harry on the lips and then he lightly kissed the hickey on Harry’s neck. “Let’s head down. Shall we?”
“You know now, can you leave?” Harry said as she tried to back out of his embrace.
“Why are you here?” Harkin asked as she looked back and forth between Sirius and Remus and Narcissa and Lucius.
“Yes, Mr. Potter is strong and seizes to surprise us, but I am still unsure whether he can come through this, even with Draco’s help.”
Harry then remembers that he’s a wizard.
“I think it’s because since we’ve been bonded, we’ve never been so far away from each other. You were in London and I was here in Wiltshire. That’s 90 miles apart.” Draco stated, and Harkin turned towards him and raised an eyebrow at him. “What?” He asked.
“I’m sorry, Siri, I would have informed you myself, but we were just coming in for a check-up ourselves. Lucius and I just wanted her checked out by our healer since she hadn’t been to one since she fell into our care. Do you want to see her? I’m sure she won’t mind, we’re just heading back in now.” Narcissa stated as she started pulling Draco towards the room that held Harry.
Draco wanted to marry her after everything she had been through, and he wanted her safe and close by. Draco practically just proposed to her, and he wanted to live with her, and he hadn’t even seen any of her tiny quirks of the domestic kind. Harry wouldn’t have to cook or tend the gardens or clean anything again unless she wanted to, and she wouldn’t have to see the Dursley’s ever again if she so desired not too. That is when she realized she was perfectly fine with that, she loved Draco, she could spend the rest of her life with Draco. Wait, she loved Draco. Had she ever admitted that to anyone?
“Well, no going back now.” Harkin joked, and Draco chuckled as his kissed her temple.
“How much do you know about bonding magic, dear cousin?” Narcissa stated with a tilt of her head, and Sirius turned towards her.
” Harry looked up at him, and realized she was never getting out of this. She was stuck with him forever. “Sleep, now, my dear. When you wake we will be leaving this place.” Voldemort walked out of the room, and Harry fell back into sleep.
“Yeah, some very dark magic. It’s ripping your soul and placing it in an object so you can’t die.” Sirius stated. “I spent too much time in the restricted section after curfew.” Sirius explained.
“Anything for you, dear. Just let me know and I will help as much as I can. Alright?” Madam Pomfrey smiled back at her, and Harkin smiled slightly bigger.
Narcissa also got up and followed the boys out of the room, and when they reached Draco’s room she closed the door behind them. She turned to look at them, and she stated, “I’m sorry, boys. I didn’t know that Lucius was planning this. I didn’t want you boys exposed to this, and Lucius just insisted that he invite them over for dinner. I am so sorry, Draco; you know how stubborn your father can be. I will make it up to the two of you over our holiday, alright?”
“I care.” Draco growled. “He is asleep and I would like to keep him that way for a while. He needs to get better and rest. I will not let you jeopardize that, Lupin.” Draco stated, and he pushed Lupin backwards away from the door. Lupin came back and shoved Draco. “What are you going to do wolf; it’s not a full moon right now. I’m stronger than you.” Draco growled.
“You know, Ronald, the way you treat your best friend is intriguing to me. Bullying your only friend into submission explains a lot about your relationship. Whenever she had decided to step out of the line you wanted her in you made yourself her enemy, and now that she is realizing that you despise her. Is that it? Or do you just hate me so much that you would practically disown your best friend. That, if right, is the case, you are pathetic. My family rivalry with your family is pathetic, Ronald, and is definitely a pathetic excuse to disown your best friend. Your brothers definitely know that, which is why they are currently giving her a better friendship than yourself. You know what that makes you, Ronald, pathetic.” Draco stated as he pulled Harkin more behind him to make sure she didn’t get any more of the possible backlash. “It is a wonder as to how you became friends in the first place with that attitude, though with how often you have been angry with her, it doesn’t surprise me one bit that after this you might lose her forever, and then you won’t have any friends Weasley. And you can only blame one person, yourself for pushing everyone away.” Draco stated as Ron pulled back for a punch, but Harkin was the one to pull Draco out of the way this time taking the fist full in the face, knocking Harkin into Draco.
“Draco?” Harry questioned as he looked down at their still intertwined hands.
“Mom, we swear we didn’t know that anyone else was in the house we thought that everyone left for breakfast. We thought that it would be alright if we just stayed behind and had a little fun. I’m sorry, Mom. We won’t do it too often, we promise, and this isn’t Harry’s fault.” Draco took hold of Harry’s wrists and wrapped them around his own waist.
Next they stopped at a clothing store, where they bought him a hand full of blouses, a few button-ups, regular t-shirts and long sleeved shirts, and some jumpers. Then some skirts, jeans and dress pants along with some pajamas. When they were finished, Harry pulled on a pair on the black skinny jeans he bought, one of the skin tight t-shirts, and a pair of ballerina flats. Then they stopped at a barber, and Harry had his hair styled to make his hair more manageable, but he kept the length, because he liked it.
“No, I really didn’t have a problem with it. Though I was often thinking of other things than girls and sex. I was usually fighting for my life or trying to figure out what was going on in the school.”
“Yeah, we got all of the dark arts books up on the top shelves, and it is a lot less gloomy there now. I like the new style that Harry has going on in the house.”
Harkin walked down to the stairs and to the dining room where she found Narcissa waiting for her. “Ah, finally. I assume Draco kept you held up.”
“Can I touch your stomach?” Theo questioned shyly, and Harkin just stuffing some chicken in her mouth turned towards him and just nodded. Theo laughed a little, and then he reached over and placed a hand on her stomach. “It is amazing to think that there are two human beings growing inside of you.” Theo stated, and then looked up at her meeting her eyes and whispering, “And that one of them is technically my younger sibling.” Harkin could see the sadness in his eyes, and she smiled at him.
“Probably because it didn’t paint him in a good light.” Harkin joked, and Draco and Severus both laughed.
birthday. You are a beautiful young woman, who is bonded to an…interesting young gentleman, who you are going to be marrying in a few months and have a beautiful baby a few months later. You are going to have everything, almost everything, you ever wanted in a few months, fawn. You are perfect, no matter what you look like or what you may be doing. You are going to be a beautiful wife, and an amazing mother, no matter if that was what you originally planned with your life or not.” Sirius said as he held Harkin’s face between his hands, and he leaned forwards and kissed her forehead. “I love you, fawn, no matter what you go through, and I will be there for you. No matter what.” Sirius whispered.
“No, but I don’t know any of them like you, love.” Draco returned.
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy. I take it potions went well.” Professor Dumbledore said like he read Draco’s mind.
“Yes, you may, and I will give you a straight forward answer. I have been observing Harry’s actions for the past four and a half years of my life from right next to the glass, where as you and the Minister have been observing him from the little cameras observing the exhibits for half a year. I probably know more about Harry Potter than the entirety of the Ministry, but less than his friends. So I’m a pretty good source on whether Harry would plan this on herself or not.” Draco stated, and he turned towards Professor Dumbledore. “Professor, would you mind if I take up a few minutes of your time later today after my last class?”
“Uh, I just wanted to know what the hell Harry’s thinking in regards of my sister.”
“You, love. First, you are the most unique person I have ever met, and second, you are breaking all the rules of courting.”
“That is amazing. You are going right. That would be an amazing opportunity for you, not to mention your relationship with Fred.” Harkin stated, and Hermione gave her a questioning look. “Oh, come on, don’t lie to me. You like him, and he likes you. Go for it, Mione, I think you would be perfect for each other. Honestly, much better than Ron, especially if he isn’t going to get his head out of his arse. Fred would be good for you.” Harkin encouraged, and Hermione smiled.
“G-go away. I don’t need your pity. Not now…not ever. If you only knew.” Harry whispered, but Snape followed her.
“Wait, fiancée?” Hermione gasped. “We’re fifteen, Harry, isn’t it a little early for marriage?”
“That isn’t what I’m talking about and you know it, Albus.”
“Draco, I thought you said that you were going on holiday, and wouldn’t be able to pick me up until a month into summer break? Why are you here?” Harry asked with surprise in his voice. Harry just stared at Draco and his mother. He wasn’t even packed yet because he hadn’t been expecting Draco for another two weeks.
“Harry says it’s in Hogwarts, and that it once belonged to Ravenclaw or Gryffindor, Professor.” Draco said without looking up from Harry.
“Mmm.” Harry answered, and Draco chuckled.
“Who was the first?”
“Raven?” Draco questioned as he quickly moved to swoop her into his arms. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” He muttered over and over until Harkin started giggling. “Har?” he whispered.
“Mum, what was the point to this story? I mean, why tell me?” Draco asked.
“Miss Lovegood, you may go and find this Diadem, Miss Granger will go with you. I feel better if we aren’t wondering around the castle alone until Mr. Potter is himself again.”
“Well, Lily was beautiful even if I didn’t like her, it was actually one of the many reasons I thought I didn’t like her.” Narcissa chuckled.
laughter, you spread wherever you go. Y
“Mom, calm down. No one got hurt, everyone is fine. Well, everyone except Lucius Malfoy, but that’s okay. He’s in the closet waiting for my friends to take him off to Azkaban for attacking the boys, and for breaking into the house of an Auror.”
“I already ordered a custom made engagement ring for Harry, Mum. It’ll be here for Christmas.” Draco stated.
“Well, it takes a lot out of a person when you conduct certain types of spells on them. Removing certain spells is the same. Harry was pretty much being drained by the spell when it’s activated and someone is trying to locate them take the spell away and this happens. So it is possible that there are more people coming to either find Lucius because they know he was tracking Harry, or they are now assigned the mission of tracking Harry down. Either way Harry is in danger, because they are tracking him. My friends should be here soon but I can’t tell you if they will be here before or after your father’s friends. Mom, do you still have that magically protected safe room?”
Dear Minerva, I wanted to inform you that i have decided to take you up on your offer of coming back for an eighth year. I hope it isn’t too late, for I wasn’t planning on coming back, but had a very nice discussion with Andromeda Tonks about Teddy’s future and decided that what kind of person I would be if I raised him and kept telling him to stay in school if I didn’t even finish school. I understand if the deadline is up I wouldn’t expect you to make an exception for me, but I was hoping that I could come back if you would allow me to. Hope to hear back from you, and if I don’t I understand. Harry Potter
“The Weasley’s were here to see you. All of them, Ron and Ginny.”
“Good thing it is no longer your money; its Draco’s.”
“What?” Harry asked with a mysterious grin. Draco’s lips found their way to the side of her neck, and Harry pulled away only to turn around and straddle Draco’s lap. Harry’s lips found Draco’s, and he pushed her back against the table. Draco’s hands slid up Harry’s legs, and his thumbs found their way under the waistband of her panties. “Take them off, if that’s what you want, Dray.” Harry moaned as Draco slipped them off, dropping them to the floor. His hands slipped back up her legs and found their way to her hips.
Meanwhile, Draco was running down the corridors shouted after his girlfriend, and he followed her back to their room. Draco closed the door behind him, and he looked around the room to find Harkin curled up, crying on his bed. He walked over and started pulling his clothes off, and he curled up next to her. “Love, tell me what’s wrong.”
“Well, I will leave you to deal with whatever is in there waiting for you, and I will be back in the morning to take you down to breakfast.” Severus stated before heading back out the door they had just came through. Draco loosened his tie before walking up to the bedroom door, and he took a deep breath before walking through. When he entered, he looked about but just saw Harkin’s uniform scattered about the bedroom floor, so he followed the trail if clothes to the bathroom where he found her crying in the bathtub.
“I can take care of myself.” Harkin stated.
“Well, you treated her at the Manor for the accident on our Quidditch pitch, and this morning she was fine, so her and Draco came down to breakfast. When they were finished Lucius needed to talk to Draco, so I took her into the family’s indoor garden to talk, and while we were in there she fell asleep. I then went to tend to some of the flowers when Lucius and Draco came in. We heard a crash and rushed to her side to find her throwing up. Draco comforted her until she stopped and then she passed out and we brought her here.” Narcissa explained.
“Boys, stop.” Narcissa shouted. “This rivalry ends. Our children are getting married, and they are going to be together for a long time. We are stuck with one another; can’t we put everything behind us like our children have. It is truly sad when our children can act more like adults than the actual adults. Don’t you think?” Narcissa stated. Both Lucius and Sirius stared at her for a short while before nodding.
Draco found Harry on her hands and knees vomiting. “Harry!” Draco shouted as he wrapped his arms around her waist, and her vomiting stopped. “Are you alright, love?” Draco asked as she leaned into his side.
“No, Dray. We are not going to use these new powers for anything until we figure them out. Plus if we are having a baby we need to think about them too now. If we become parents…” Harry trailed off.
“Yes, they are. They bloom every two weeks, and the house elves collect them and become part of the Malfoy income.”
“We love you, too, fawn.” Sirius whispered back. The older men pulled away, and Sirius rested his hand on the side of Harkin’s face before he pulled away. “You are special, Harkin Jamelynn Potter. Don’t let anyone tell you any different.” Sirius stated. The man stood up, and he and Remus walked back around the table to the chairs they were sitting in before. Everyone went back to their breakfast, and they all were rather quiet.
“Thanks, Narcissa.” Harkin whispered. “I’m just so embarrassed over the whole thing, I appreciate the curtesy.”
“It is too late for explanations, Siri. You broke my heart.” She whispered before walking into the other room.
while she was sleeping. She has informed me while still under Veritaserum that you only did it under the pretenses of your son’s happiness. Now I can accept this as the answer if it is the truth and not just Miss Potter’s assumption of the truth.”
“I like you, Harry dear.” Narcissa laughed.
“Why does it hurt so much?” Harry asked with tears down his cheeks. “I haven’t felt this much pain since I was being tortured with the cautious curse by Voldemort when I was 14.” Harry whispered.
“Well, typically when patients who have been raped or almost raped or abused in the way Harry has, and not remember don’t trust the sex of their abuser. So if the abuser is male they have a tendency to mistrust all males; if the abuser is female they mistrust females. Not the entire sex except one person.”
“For now, yes. We still don’t know how to reverse this, but Severus is working on something that may help. We don’t know if you will function like a normal 15 year old girl, but I feel that we may find out in time. I am going to take you to muggle London and then Dragon Alley for some new clothes in the meantime.”
“Harry, what’s going on with you?”
“I know, fawn. I know, but we’ll figure something out. There is no reason to make any big decisions right now.”
“Where is he?” Malfoy growled. Snape slowly moved down from the staff table and towards Malfoy, and Ron and Hermione started doing the same thing. “Where is he?” Malfoy growled again but Hermione could hear the panic in his voice. Hermione reached him first and started pushing him from the hall.
“How did you know that I had it with me?”
“He really tires quickly.” Harkin muttered.
“That Mr. Weasley is what is left of the protective wards I had placed over Mr. Potter. Which leads us to the information we were dreading. The Dark Lord in using Mr. Potter as a vessel for damage. You three know Mr. Potter best, where would he go?”
“Draco, that is so embarrassing. You asking the house elf to find my knickers. Merlin, I am going to go upstairs…I will be there when you are done looking for my knickers.” Harkin stated as she stood up and made sure her dress covered her completely before undoing Draco’s spells on the room, and she fled up to her and Draco’s bedroom. She was just about there when she ran into Lucius, and she froze as she saw the door to her bedroom just a few feet down the corridor.
“I underestimated the bond that connects them. Whatever happens to Potter happens to Draco, and vice versa. Their bond is more profound than any bound I have seen or heard of before.” At that moment Narcissa walked back into the room with Luna trailing behind her, and then Narcissa spotted her son.
“H-h-harry, please.” Malfoy attempted, but Harry just placed her hand on Malfoy’s thigh.
“Yes, but I want a shower first.” She walked over to Draco’s bathroom and opened the door. “Bloody hell!” Harry said as she stared into the huge five piece bathroom.
“Potter.” Draco said as he stood up and walked back to his and Potter’s room not waiting for her response to that. It would have probably been something along the lines of, well then you definitely need to work on that if Harry can notice when he’s half out of it and Harry’s not usually observant. Draco didn’t care, and he knew how observant the raven haired man can be. He noticed things about Draco that even Draco’s friends didn’t even notice. Draco entered their room and glanced over at Harry to see him staring at him. “Potter, are you actually awake this time or are you going to fall asleep on me again.” The raven haired boy’s cheeks flushed which was extremely noticeable on his pale complexion, which made Draco wonder about the raven haired boy’s sexuality.
Harry started pounding on the door trying to get out, and when that didn’t work Harry started screaming at his uncle to let him out of his tiny little cupboard. Harry eventually gave up and he sank to the floor, and he started to think that this was going to end his relationship with Draco, when he heard the front door bang open. Shit, Uncle Vernon is pissed, Harry thought to himself. Harry didn’t even look up as the cupboard door opened, and someone kneeled down in front of him. Harry didn’t want to look up and see what he thought he would see, but then something surprised him.
“You just need to file out the blank spaces on the form.” Lucius said as he pushed the form over to Harry, and she took the quill and slowly started reading over the form and filling out the section that she needed to fill out. When she was finished, she pushed the form back over to Lucius, and he took the form and looked up at Sirius. “Now on to Mr. Black. Do you want your job as an Auror back because I can pull that while I’m there, but I will not be going back to get it if you don’t right now.”
“Yeah, I have no idea, how Granger got with Victor Krum, but I also don’t care since she isn’t my best friend. Though I’m curious on how Weasley got a date at all. He doesn’t seem like the type that would be good with girls, if you know what I mean.” This made Draco laugh.
“I’m here for you if you need me.” Harry took Draco’s hand and pulled him down on the bed so he was lying next to her and she rested her head on his shoulder. Draco just chuckled and wrapped his arm around her waist pulling her closer. “What’s so funny?” Harry whispered.
“Do you like lemon drops, my boy?” Draco thought the question odd, but he figured it a secret message.
“No, he can think about what he’s done. What he said, it deserves a little brooding. I’m done with being played for a damn tool, Remi. I’m not an object that everyone around me can use for their own personal gain, and sometimes that is all people want me around for.” Harkin whispered. “I know that Draco doesn’t think of me as a tool to use, but his father and mother. I can’t figure out one way or another if they want me there because of who I was, or because I’m Draco’s fiancé, or because they actually want me there.” Harkin finished.
“My sanctuary. How much do you know about flowers, darling?” Narcissa questioned.
“Yeah, I did. I figured if you weren’t out by now then there was something wrong, because you hate being here so the moment you get a chance to leave you would, so if you weren’t out something was wrong. It was a spur of the moment thing; I’m sorry.” Draco stated, and Harry started laughing.
The minute his mother was out of the room, Draco pushed Harry over to the bed and pushed him down, and he climbed on top of him. Draco started kissing Harry, and his lips attacked Harry’s. Harry was kissing Draco back, when the door suddenly burst open, and Draco jumped back off of Harry. There stood Lucius in the doorway to Draco’s bedroom.
“Safe for now. He’s part of the something I can’t talk about. Well, Ron and I need to get started on figuring out where the thing we need to find is. If you want to see Harry try talking to Professor Snape. He knows where he is. We’ll talk to you later, Professor.” Hermione said as she took Ron’s hand and pulled him towards the Gryffindor table. McGonagall reached for Hermione’s hand.
“It’s a possibility right? If she doesn’t react to me, what if she reacts to you?”
“No you aren’t.” Harkin stated as she slapped his arm.
“Dreams? What dreams?”
“What if the person that attacked her wasn’t male?”
Harry pulled her arm out of Malfoy’s grasp, and he turned back towards Harry. “Whatever you are offering I’m not interested.” Harry started walking up the stairs, but Malfoy followed her. “Why are you still following me, Malfoy? I’m pretty sure the Slytherin common room is still in the dungeons.” Harry said without even looking back.
She got through most of her assignments accept the potions essay she had to write because of the potion incident with Neville, and she wasn’t looking forwards to writing that. Her potion's book gave her the basic information on the potion, but she wanted to do better than normal on this assignment since she failed the practical completely. She decided it was six in the morning, so the library should be open, right? Harry pushed her books and parchment into her bag and headed out the portrait hole and headed towards the library, but she found out the library doesn’t open for another hour and a half.
“House elves. They have free rain over things. They can go through wards that wizards can’t, they can smuggle things past wards that wizards can’t. People don’t pay attention to house elves because they aren’t supposed to notice them. Plus, they follow orders, either because of threats or niceties that their masters treats them.” Harkin explained.
“I just don’t think I can get through it without breaking down. It’s a long story that stems from my childhood, before Hogwarts, before I found out I was a wizard.”
“That is our fate if one of us dies?” Harry whispered.
“Maybe either that or polyjuice. Care to test my theory?”
“Draco, do you want me to…”
Enjoy.
“Yes, Mum, we will.” Draco stated.
“Yes, you can start by why you would be shagging in my mother’s spare bedroom while she is out? Then you can answer who you are?”
“Yes, we can keep them in Draco’s room until it is time to pull them out of the stasis.” Narcissa said. “This is the safest place for them. Now that Draco is in the stasis no one can enter Malfoy Manor. So once you leave there is no returning. Not even using the floo, but then again if they stay here you cannot return to remove the stasis. If you took Harry back to Hogwarts with you Draco will wake up when you remove Harry’s stasis.”
“Really, so one night I could totally just crawl in bed with you and fuck you, and you probably wouldn’t even notice?” Draco asked sarcastically, and Harry’s eyes widened and his fingers entangled in his hair, which Draco loved. Harry’s mouth gapped open a little, and Draco took advantage of that and leaned in capturing Harry’s lips, sliding his tongue in place. Harry sighed a little and then kissed Draco back, and he slowly slide closer to Draco. Eventually, Draco pulled Harry’s body flush with his own, their newly formed erection grinding together, causing both men to pull away from their kiss slightly with a groan. “I was kidding before. I would rather fuck you to get your reactions than to fuck you for my own person reasons.” Draco panted.
“How long have you known?”
“No, you just surprise me is all. Why are you doing this?”
“Yes, I think I’ve got this so far. It seems rather easy.” Harkin stated.
Harry walked back to the Gryffindor common room, and when she stepped through the portrait hole, Ron and Hermione were standing there waiting for her. “Your room now.” Hermione said. Harry did as she asked without question and she walked into her room with Ron and Hermione on her tail.
“She has had 9 broken arms, 6 bruised ribs, 3 broken ribs, 2 broken legs, several concussions and stitches, not to mention the starvation and the confinement to the cupboard under the Dursley’s stairs. She should have been taken out of that environment as soon as you knew that it was happening, Albus. I’m ashamed that you didn’t. If I would have known I would have done it myself.”
“What’s wrong with it?” Harry questioned. “If we’re talking about size it is bigger than mine was.” Harry continued without looking up from her plate. When no one said anything, she looked up and took a sip of pumpkin juice, to find everyone staring at her. “What?” Harry asked with furrowed eyebrows.
“Are you sure that is a good idea?’ Harkin whispered. “I’m not that good.”
“Yes, I want it back.” Sirius stated without hesitation. “If you can swing it I would love to have my job back.”
“You’ve never had anyone take care of you in your life have you?”
“She said someone grabbed her hand, and entwined their fingers. She said she thought it was me, but then she woke up here and was holding my hand. I didn’t put it together until you said that. Harry’s hands are callused from flying and work and whatever else he did while at the Dursley’s even her hands are badly callused you can’t change the skin just the appearance. My hands on the other hand are rather soft because I’ve never really done any work, but if you take most of the guys in the school that most likely isn’t the case. I’ve been told I have very feminine hands, my mother is the reason for this.”
“I didn’t just do it for Teddy. I did it for me. Ginny and I had our relationship while the war was going on, and I don’t know what to do now that it’s over. I’m not the same person that I was before. I don’t know who I am anymore. I needed to find myself again and I couldn’t do that with Ginny because I’ll keep trying to be the person that I was before the war, and I’m not that person. I couldn’t tell her that though, because Ginny wouldn’t take that, and she would keep trying. I told her that I wanted to raise Teddy right, and I couldn’t do that while I was still in a relationship with her while she was in school. In reality it was because I couldn’t live in the past anymore and opened my eyes to new possibilities. Like you.” Harry said not looking at Draco but still playing with his hair.
“No, I told no one. It was a sudden thing and the only people that knew are in this room. My husband didn’t even know that I would come here. No one in my family besides myself even knew where Andromeda lived let alone that I would come here.”
“Mr. Potter is strong, I have absolute confidence that he can fight this off. He has never come across something that he can’t defeat or perfect.” McGonagall said.
“Of course, Theo. I am honored to be your little sister.” Harkin stated and then pulled away to give Theo a kiss on the cheek. “I appreciate everything that you have done for me and Draco and especially the twins. You are going to be a fantastic uncle, Theo; I feel that would be easier on the twins to call you Uncle Theo if that is alright?” Harkin questioned, and Theo smiled with a slight chuckle.
“What am I to do?” Lucius inquired.
“Better?” Draco nodded and Harry’s free hand slid from Draco’s face and down his abdomen, his fingers wrapping around Draco’s erection, and he started massaging it with his finger. Draco’s head slipped backwards as Draco relaxed on the bed. Harry pulled his fingers out and lubed up his hard erection. “You ready?” Draco nodded again, and Harry positioned himself and pushed his hard on into Draco’s prepped entrance slowly letting Draco adjust to each movement.
She slid her hand down his chest and rested it on the inside of his thigh, her thumb just barely brushing against the budge growing there. She smirked as he tried to buck his hips into the touch, and he released a whimpered moan as he wasn’t satisfied. “If you’re awake you should let me know.” Harry whispered into his ear, and then nipped at his earlobe.
“I tried to tell you earlier, Miss Weasley. Draco is protecting Mr. Potter. I don’t know how long it has been since he last fed, which maybe what caused this reaction.”
“Worse, and whether he gets better is going to be determined by how you answer a series of questions, starting with what spells you used on Harry while he was in St. Mungos?”
“Dray, I don’t feel good.” Harry muttered as she collapsed into his arms.
“I’m not much of a dancer.” She whispered.
“Not well. It is his first full moon without Black in two years, so his wolf misses him. Narcissa has a room specifically designed for his condition, when his first moved in though, and I feel it helped a bit.” Severus stated as he continued down the train.
“It’s not, don’t worry, Draco.” Draco’s fingers pulled Harry’s pajama shirt over his head causing Harry’s hands to leave their position in Draco’s trousers. Draco’s hands slide down Harry’s abdomen, and he laced his fingers around the waistband of Harry’s pajama bottoms, leaning back in kissing Harry. Harry slipped his hands back into place one in the back of Draco’s trousers and the other laced through the hair at the back of Draco’s neck. Draco pulled back from the kiss.
“I only killed him before he asked me to, and I made an unbreakable vow with Draco’s mother to kill Albus if he was unable to finish the act. I gladly made that sacrifice to save my godson. I unfortunately could not stop this from happening.” He said as he gestured to Draco and Harry. “I was too late, but I will do everything in my power to make sure no more harm comes to him. His father may have been useless, but I am not, and am only devoted to keeping him, them, safe. Lucius was devoted to the Dark Lord, and I have not been since he set his mind on killing an innocent boy of a dear friend of mine even if she wouldn’t speak to me anymore they were innocent, and deserved better than being killed by a man like the Dark Lord. I just wish I could have gotten my revenge the way Draco did.”
“Why would I when you think I’m the product of a mudblood and a blood traitor? That is who I am Draco, and you despise people of that such, so why would you want to be with me. You want to know why I keep questioning why you would want to be with me that is the reason right there.”
Draco lifted the wand and cast a spell at Harry, and then he put it back in his pocket. “Okay, try to think something at me.”
“She is fine, my dragon; she will be fine with time just as you will. If she isn’t awake by her appointment tomorrow, she will be taken to St. Mungos until she is better. I think there are still some effects from the snake bit, plus the magic she has acquired. Severus thinks that is the reason for your accident. Your bodies need to adapt to the new magic serge that is bellowing inside you two. Especially you, Draco, because Harry was already powerful, so the serge is only new to you, but the bond that you two share is unique, and we don’t know how you will react to it. I think your new sex drive is one of the side effects.”
Harry laughed and pulled Sirius in for a hug. “Thank you, Sirius.”
“Tally, indeed found Master Harry’s cloak, Master Draco, but the redheaded boy saw Tally take it from redheaded boy’s bag.” Tally whispered.
“And you were, it was a noble thing to do to keep your predicament hidden from people who will make fun of you and draw their own conclusions, but sadly your magic is stabilizing hers, and she needs you at full power not half, especially with twins.” Severus stated.
“I love you, too, Dray. What are we going to do now that both of your parents know about us?” Harry questioned as he lifted his head to look Draco in the eyes.
birthday, last summer?” Harry asked.
“What is the other problem?”
“You were just having fun playing Quidditch?” Draco asked as he wrapped his arms around Harkin.
“Seriously?”
“Then why did you kill, Dumbledore.”
“Black Manor.” Narcissa said. “I could ride my horse here before my parents died.”
“My Lord, may I ask what you found out?” Lucius asked with a bow.
“Anything for you, cub. We just want you to be happy.” Remus whispered in her ear, and he pulled her away to look at her to see the tears streaming down her face. “What’s the matter, cub?”
Okay, so I know last chapter I declared Harley as Harry's chosen female name, but I have recently been given the name Harkin Jamelynn Potter. Which I think is great and kind of suits Harry's character more. I've been told that Harkin means fiery one, which fits, so. I know I said I was going with Harley, but being the Author I have the right to change my mind sometimes. I hope you like it, and I hope you enjoy the next chapter.
“Ten chapters for you or ten chapters for me, because those are two different amounts of times, Dray.”
“Close, love…” Draco whispered, and Harry’s fingers entangled in Draco’s hair. “So close.”
“Your dad’s cloak?” Draco questioned.
“No, this is better than the first time. I want to see if I can do this,” Draco sounded determined, and Harry looked him in the eyes to make sure. “Potter, move your bloody fingers, before I change my mind, because this is getting uncomforta…” Draco cut off as Harry pulled his fingers back and pushed them back in siding the third finger in with the same movement. Draco’s expression was unexplainable, it was a cross between shock, pleasure, and the unknown. Draco whimpered as the fingers slid out and back in, and Harry was looking for pain in his eyes, but Harry didn’t know what that looked like on Draco.
The next morning when Harry woke up, he rolled over, and he found himself buried into Draco’s side. “Well, good morning to you to, Harry.”
“I’m fine, Pans. Go to dinner. I’ll be down in a little bit when I’m finished in here.” Draco said as he twisted his fingers in Harry, causing him to let out another scream. Harry was panting as his fingers dug into the shower wall, and Draco leaned in, kissed Harry’s neck, and whispered in his ear, “I’m sorry, Love. If she realizes what I’m doing in here she’ll go away faster. If you scream my name that might do it,” Draco stated and Harry could feel as the smirk spread across his lip. Draco pulled his fingers out and lined his erection up, pushing it inside of Harry.
“My guess is Harry is reliving his mother’s murder, and probably over and over again because Voldemort is a sick bastard.” Hermione said, and then turned around. “Let’s find this thing so we can help Harry.” Hermione walked away and McGonagall started looking through everything around her and slowly made her way through the stacks of junk that people have discarded in this room over the years. She reached the Vanishing Cabinet the Draco used last year to get Death Eaters into Hogwarts, and she saw Hermione standing under this cabinet down the way and she saw the Diadem sitting on top of this ugly manikin wearing a wig.
“I don’t care. I’m not going to hide away while someone is after me. I didn’t do it with Voldemort after I watched him kill Cedric I’m not going to do it now either. I’ve faced worse at this school than a little beat down. I’ve actually had more of those with Draco than I have faced Voldemort here. I can handle students.” Harry said.
“I’m not due until summertime, Pansy. They are technically due in September, that would be nine months, but given that they are twins, we are thinking probably June or July. At the latest August.” Harkin stated. “And it is only the start of April, Pansy.” Harkin chuckled, and Draco rolled his eyes again.
“You have nothing to be sorry for, Draco. I fell over because I am a klutz, and this hasn’t really improved my balance.” Harkin chuckled as she gestured to her baby bump.
“Sirius knows, and so does Dumbledore.” Hermione whispered the last word and everyone looked up at the man in question.
“Fine, you can hurt me all you like but let Andromeda and Teddy go. They did nothing to you.”
“I don’t know, why don’t you ask Draco? I just came up here because the whole dorm is really warm, and I tracked the magic in here. I’m going to let Draco explain. I love you, Harry. Feel better.” Hermione stood up and walked out of the room, and Harry turned so he was facing Draco.
Draco arched his back and he slowly moved his hands down to Harry’s waistband and started sliding his pants down his legs and off onto the floor. “Harry, more. More, please.” Harry slipped his other finger into Draco, and he rolled himself over so he was on top of Draco. Harry thrusted his fingers into Draco and slipped another of his fingers into Draco. “Harry, push this into me now,” Draco screamed as he gripped Harry’s erection and pulled on it some, causing Harry to scream a little. Harry looked down at Draco and stared him in the eyes.
“But you must know what this means now, right?”
“You can’t just take a Gryffindor over to the Slytherin table.” Ron insisted as he stood up, and Draco tensed as he felt Harkin twist in his arms and swung her fist to collide with Ron’s face, which caused him to stagger. “You bitch!” Ron shouted, and he swung his fist towards Harkin, but before his fist made contact with Harkin, Draco caught it, and he twisted his fist, so it was now behind his back.
“Well, there goes that plan. I was hoping if you knew you would go with it. I don’t have a wand though, but I do have a snake.” Harry said as Nagini slithered out from behind her. “Please, just cooperate Arthur. I really don’t want to hurt you, you’re family.”
“Because I’ve been having Veritaserum slipped into your food and drinks.” He said plainly.
“The baby will be his half sibling.” Harkin stated.
“You were out for a week Harry, don’t worry though Andromeda and Molly went to Diagon Alley and bought all your books and supplies for school. The Healers said that they will treat you the best they can here for a week and then they will send you to school and still try to treat you there once a week. I’m going to go get a Healer, and send Andromeda a Patronus saying you’re awake.” Hermione walked out of the room, and Harry tried to sit up but his muscles were having a hard time listening to him.
“So the baby should be…” Severus started.
Severus took Draco’s hand, and Draco took Harkin’s hand; and Severus apparated. When they reached the station, and Severus pulled them straight to the train and into a compartment. “How is Remus doing?” Harkin asked Severus as she was pulled behind Draco.
“Very good. Now, the only issue we have is the fact that we cannot destroy it until after Mr. Potter is released from the recesses of his own mind, otherwise there is no telling whether or not he will be released from his subconscious or not.”
Malfoy relaxed against the desk as Harry had, and Harry stood up and started pulling her clothes back on. She just finished pulling the last article of her clothing on when she felt someone wrap their arms around her waist and shoulders. She tensed, and she could feel the person behind her do the same and then start backing off.
“Yay.” Harry whispered as Madam Pomfrey walked up to the bed.
“Again, everything. Were you aware that Mr. Potter was captured by Snatchers six days ago as well? He was recognized immediately and taken to Malfoy Manor. The entire household had been emptied except three people. Narcissa, Lucius and Draco Malfoy. After the Dark Lord had Draco turned Draco ripped his throat out, and his father detained him locking him in his room. The Dark Lord then died. As Lucius helped the other Death Eaters set up the next base camp elsewhere Narcissa burned the Dark Lords body and released the prisoners in their cellar except one. Miss Lovegood, but she moved her to one of the guest rooms in the North Wing of the Manor and placed wards around the room to make it so Draco couldn’t find her while they made sure that Draco didn’t fed, unfortunately while Narcissa was out taking the people that they had had in their cellar to St. Mungos, the Snatchers came and dropped Mr. Potter off at the Manor where Draco unaware of his action do to the fact that he had never fed had them take Mr. Potter up to his bedroom and he dismissed the Snatchers before he changed his mind. Mr. Potter than came too and tried to escape Draco’s attacks, but was unsuccessful. Mr. Potter was subject to being Draco’s first. Narcissa came home and stopped him before he killed Mr. Potter, which she was just in time because Draco almost killed him a few more moments and Mr. Potter would have been dead.”
“And look at how that turned out for both of us. You died and I became an orphan, what an interesting solution. I don’t follow orders and I will not be your trophy. I am a human being, and you destroyed my life, so you see why I’m not leaping at your notion to join your side.” Harry sneered as she stood up and walked across the room and was almost to the door, when she was pulled back and thrown back onto the couch.
“Harry, don’t try to talk, the Healers said that you might be a little sore for a couple of months. The Dark magic that was in the knives that were very dangerous and could cause some damage if not treated exactly as specified.” Hermione said. “I’m glad you’re awake though, I was getting worried.”
“I believe you, Draco.” Harry whispered. “I feel cold. Why is it so cold in here?” Harry asked.
“Yes, why?”
Harry found it funny that an article about the Malfoy’s release somehow ended up talking about him. Harry rolled his eyes, set the paper down, and extinguished his light before falling asleep. Harry woke up three times that night, twice were because Teddy was crying, and the other time was because he heard something and had to check it out. The noise was just Kreacher working on organizing the kitchen cabinets and pantry.
“Grab her, I’ve got your bags. Hurry to the Hospital Wing.” Hermione ordered, and Draco did as he was told. He carried her to the Hospital Wing, and he laid her down on one of the beds, while Hermione ran to grab Madam Pomfrey.
“Told you.” Draco muttered from the bed and Harkin rolled her eyes.
“You may not want to stand so close to me, Severus. Thinking about Harry like that makes me thirsty.” Draco murmured, and Severus stepped back. “Thank you, I don’t want to have to talk about that just yet. Thank you for that sunlight potion as well. That was greatly appreciated.”
“I don’t like this position.” Draco stated and Harry pulled out his fingers and rolled them so Draco was back on the bottom. Harry’s hand slid back down and his finger slid into place.
“Draco…I don’t think that…that we should be doing this.” Harkin panted as Draco’s lips kissed, sucked, and nipped at the skin underneath her ear, and her back arched as she moaned.
“Lupin broke my arm, and I think you are feeling the pain.” Draco whispered as he pulled out his wand, and he healed the break. “I’m sorry, love. I didn’t know it would hurt you like that.” Draco apologized. “You aren’t going to get back to sleep are you?”
“I can’t be sure I don’t think so.” Weasley muttered.
“Not so loud.” Harry whispered. “I want to change it to fit my new gender, but it’s actually really similar to my boy name, so it’s not that big of a deal.” Harry smiled hoping that Sirius wouldn’t make a big deal of it right here in the lobby of St. Mungos as Narcissa slipped into the flames.
“You’ve heard of the Wizard of Oz, Mrs. Malfoy?”
He was standing in the graveyard before Voldemort, and the cup is a portkey, and Harry turns around and Accios the cup before the pain starts because he knows the pain will start. He’s standing in the room with the arch and he watches Sirius fall through the veil as Remus holds him back, and he’s reliving Sirius’ death over and over. Remus’ arms just wrapped around him to make sure he doesn’t try and follow. Harry won’t follow though, he has to get rid of Voldemort he has to make sure he can’t take any more people from him. He’s done with being nice about this to him, he’s taken too much, and then Harry realizes why he’s stuck in his head. Voldemort has trapped him inside his worst fears and memories.
“It’s a piece of one’s soul stuck inside another object it can literally be anything. Most of the time objects that can be hidden away easily. Most don’t put one in a living thing, because the Horcrux will only be alive for as long as the person, animal or plant is alive.”
“I have something’s to go over with Draco, so you don’t have to worry about him.” Lucius stated.
“Yes, I agree with Mel. Anyone who does not sleep in this room; either go to your own room or have one of the house elves prepare you a room.” Narcissa stated as she stood up and started escorting people from the room. Everyone else took the hint and started removing themselves from the room muttering their good nights as they left the room. Mel and Narcissa were the only ones left in the room, and Harkin was getting a little nervous.
“Injuries?” Draco asked through clenched teeth, and everyone turned to look at him.
“What is it?” Harry asked as she turned back towards Voldemort.
“Yes, Mom. Father used polyjuice potion and disguised himself as you, it threw me off at first, but Harry figured it out right away and he took care of stunning him and we ran out of the room and found Tonks. She took care of the rest. We’re fine, though, Mom,” Draco reassured his mother and rested his free hand on his mother’s that was resting on his cheek. “Everything is going to be alright. Okay, we can still go on that holiday that you wanted to go on and we can enjoy ourselves and forget about father. Sound good, Mom?”
“Thank Merlin. Child what on earth do you think you were doing just running off like that. Something could have happened.” Lucius stated calmly, and Severus turned and saw the questioning in her eyes.
“What if I’m not Harry’s first choice for her child? What are you going to do then, dragon?”
“Dray, you sure you want to continue. I have a feeling that she is going to tell your mother and I’m pretty sure your mother was serious about us not doing this.”
“Bath or shower, love?” Draco asked with a smirk.
“No, he was almost completely drained of blood, which thanks to my mother’s wonderful potion stash he was given a blood replenishing potion in staggered doses. Then he was tortured by my father when he was almost better again, losing the blood he just replenished. I wasn’t surprised that he was sleeping a lot. The body can only take so much.” Draco responded.
“Maybe marriage contracts are going out of style.” Draco stated.
“So, it is still possible for him to lose all memory of Hogwarts, and me and the war and the truth?” Granger asked
“Yeah, how does that help you understand this?”
“What happened?” Draco asked.
“I don’t think they will have a problem with what happened. If you explained what happened.” Draco stated.
“Is the Fidelius still on Sirius’ house?” Harkin asked.
“They have two different fathers.” Melody finished.
“Yes, it is, Potter. You can call me Rodolphus.”
“A special compartment.”
“Oh, don’t get cocky. You didn’t change anything. Voldemort is now out of my life and I don’t have to deal with him, so that takes care of 95% of the weird things that happen at Hogwarts.”
“I’ll love you until you don’t want me anymore and then probably even after that.” Harry chuckled, and Draco pulled him closer. They both glanced over at the door when they heard the door slam closed, and Harry looked back at Draco and whispered, “Ginny.”
“I’m sorry, Mrs. Malfoy. I’ll contact her right away.” The receptionist said as she walked away. She came back a few minutes later. “She said she’ll meet you in her office in a few minutes. You know where that is?”
Harry had always known that he had some sort of feelings for Draco, it’s why he decided to get to know Draco in the first place. Harry had met Ron Weasley on the train and he was alright, but the way that Draco injected himself and carried himself, made Harry want to know him and figure him out, which is why he shook Draco’s hand and said, ‘We’ll see how the sorting pans out.’ Harry looked at Ron after that and he had a small look of betrayal on his face. Harry didn’t want to just walk away from his first real friend but he figured he would have an open mind about this school and all the people in it. If he was sorted into Slytherin, and Ron totally abandons him then Ron wasn’t supposed to be his friend, because the way that Ron made it sound was Draco Malfoy was going to be in Slytherin, no matter what, and Ron was going to be in Gryffindor no matter what, so if Harry was sorted into Gryffindor and Draco didn’t want to be his friend then Harry would know that Draco wasn’t supposed to be his friend either.
“Can I move to your back it might be a little more comfortable that way.” Harry giggled and Draco rearranged her so he was now giving her a piggyback ride. Draco walked through the halls to the library, and when they got there, Draco walked over to the book shelves and started looking through them. He found a few books and brought them down and set Harry in the chair and then moved to the chair next to her.
. The next time Dudley and his gang pin him to the ground Harry focuses on the magic he knows is in him somewhere, and he forces it out of him with all his might.
“Have you talked to her yet?”
“Dad’s cloak.” Harkin stated with a smile.
The women seemed to want nothing to do with Harkin as her family was now out of the Scared Twenty-Eight when her father married her mother and had her, a half blood, and the last of the Potter line, and therefore making the Malfoy line into half-bloods as well. “You know, raven, that you might not even be considered a half-blood anymore.” Draco whispered into her ear, and Harkin looked over at him with a puzzled look. “With our bond. We are practically one person now. Meaning I would either be a half-blood or you would be a pureblood. Either way it doesn’t matter to me, as long as I have you in my life.” Draco stated, and she smiled at him.
“Don’t be, I killed my father and my aunt was no better than he was. She would have done the same thing to Harry.” Draco said with a straight face as they approached a wall, and Harry gave Snape a funny look.
“So, he is pulling the black ooze from Harkin into himself to save her and the twins? Has he been doing that this entire time?” Melody asked.
“No, but why would that matter?”
“Oh, Harry.” Lucius said before they completely walked out of the room. “I have that paperwork you wanted for whenever you want to fill it out.”
“What’s going on?” Harkin asked.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, you better have not done what I think you did in the dining room.” Narcissa’s voice boomed through the Manor, and Harkin flinched. She was dead. She was so dead.
“Yes, I know, but when we the last time you fed. For real fed.” Harry said as he stroked Draco’s jaw line. “You need it.” Harry continued as he drew Draco closer with his finger, and soon Draco was kissing the side of Harry’s neck again. Harry’s fingers slid up into Draco’s hair and curled into it. The second Draco broke skin, Draco completely bit down, and Harry moaned in pleasure. Harry’s hips buckled upwards into Draco’s as his back arched. Harry’s panting breath filled the room, and Draco was mesmerized and enveloped in the task at hand. Neither of them noticed as the door opened and a group of people walked in.
“Well, Harry doesn’t have a wand, so Voldemort would have to find one.”
“You aren’t going to shower this morning; don’t you always shower in the morning?” Severus questioned as he tried to trying to remember his godson’s habits.
“Well, I’m awful at wizard’s chess, but if you want to play have no objections.” Harry said.
“Never?”
“Thank you, mum.” Draco breathed as he embraced his mother pulling her close, while trying not to jostle Harry.
“Thanks, Blaise. Good job getting him all riled up, his emotions and everything aren’t already haywire with the effects of the dark magic, and I already knew about the whole Ginny thing, too. I was just waiting for him to tell me himself. Blaise, you’re my best friend and I care about you, but sometimes you observe way too much, and it doesn’t always need to be said out loud. Now I’m going to try and get him out of the bathroom before he freezes to death in the cold bathroom, and you better be gone before I come back.”
“Can you lace me up?” she asked hesitantly, and Draco walked over to her and grabbed the laces.
“Trust me, Remy. He’s got her. She’s in good hands here.” Sirius said as he stood and pulled the other man against his chest.
“Well, Lucius’ confession to you, and then your conversation with the Aurors.”
“Mione, you’re overwhelming them. Either slow down or stop talking.” Ron said as he wrapped his arms around her waist.
“For Harry. I stayed for her. She needed a friend more than you. And honestly, you decided to go home instead of supporting a friend. You didn’t even visit her like a real friend would. The Twins visited your best friend. What does that say about you, Ronald?” Hermione shouted before grabbing Harkin’s hand and pulling her towards the carriages, while everyone else stared dumbfounded after Harkin and Hermione.
“Yes, you definitely have her fiery temper, Miss Potter, but you are more like your mother than you realize, more so your mother than your father in most ways actually.” Severus stated.
“Mom, what’s up?” Draco said nonchalantly like he had no idea what his mother was talking about, but Harry could see the anger in her eyes, and he slipped behind Draco.
“Ronald. This is your best friend. How can you say that to her?” Hermione said as she turned towards Ron.
“You’re welcome, dear. You’re welcome.” Narcissa whispered back, and Harry drifted off to sleep in her arms. Narcissa cradled Harry in her arms for a little while, and then gently placed her on the window seat. Narcissa stood up and pulled the blinds down before she walked towards the door. When she opened the door, Draco and Lucius were standing on the other side.
“Sorry, mum. I can leave if that is what you want.” Draco stated, and Narcissa chuckled before standing up and resting her hand on her son’s shoulder.
“What’s that, Hermione?”
“Pettigrew? Wormtail, that creepy little rat?”
“What is this name that you are deciding to change to?” Sirius asked.
Soon Harry was standing in the room wearing a pair of skinny jeans, a very low cut blouse that her breast were almost hanging out of the top, and a pair of black combat boots. Mipsy disappeared, and a few minutes after Nott walked into the room, and he circled her as if inspecting her. Harry knew the real reason, he was checking her out, especially when he stopped in front of her, and he stared down her shirt. Harry flinched slightly as he brought his finger up, and gently stroked it down Harry’s jaw and neck, and he slowly dipped it into her cleavage. His finger made its way back up and behind her neck were he grabbed a handful and jerked her head to the side, so he could slowly suck on the skin right under her ear.
“I missed you, and without you there the bed was cold.” Draco stated, and Harkin laughed.
“Why didn’t you say anything? Everyone probably knows now.” Harry was embarrassed as his cheeks flushed.
“How do you know that he has more than one?”
“Try telling that to my sister, who thinks no one will love her.” Daphne said before standing up and storming out of the Great Hall.
“Why are you staring at me like that, Potter? It’s freaking me out a little.”
“You’ll always have me, because if they don’t I’m going down there and having a word with Fudge myself.” Harkin sniffled.
“I said I might be wrong about that I just know that he’s up to something but I don’t know what it is? It could have happened already but it also might not have.” Draco stated. “I want you to go talk to her, and see if I’m wrong.”
“You’re just a pretty little thing as a girl, Potter, aren’t you? I could actually have some fun with you, but not yet.” Harry recognized the voice but she couldn’t place it in the state she was in. She could feel as her knickers were roughly pulled back up and they laid cockeyed on her hips. She dropped to the ground with a moan and her mind felt as if something was being pulled from her head, and she passed out.
Harry woke in Draco’s bed with Draco curled around him, and she sighed as she curled deeper into his side. She felt as he shifted, pulling her even closer to him in his sleep, and she smiled as she nuzzles her face into the side of his neck. She started kissing the exposed skin there, and she heard Draco moan in his sleep as she started sucking on the skin right below his ear.
Draco was frozen, he didn’t know what to do. Was Harry just acting as he would to any of his friends, analyzing them until he understood? Draco decided he would ask Granger later, right now he had to take care of Harry. Draco pulled the covers over Harry and moved him into a more comfortable position on the bed, and then he closed the curtains and walked out of the room.
“Wait, she’s three weeks pregnant?” Draco questioned.
“Yes, actually, because it was something that I was actually good at and I didn’t have to pretend that I wasn’t for my cousin’s sake, so I didn’t get my arse kicked every time.” Harkin stated.
“The name is very unique, dear, and fits you very nicely. Why did you pick it?”
“I want to thank you for inviting us over for dinner. I understand that you didn’t have to, and that you didn’t have to want to get to know Harry’s messed up little family. I know Siri and I aren’t technically Harry’s real family, but we are what she has and are considered her family even if we aren’t.” Remus rambled, and Harkin giggled.
“What’s wrong with her?” he asked.
“Your father was with her.” Draco spun around and looked at Sirius. “We thought he was on our side now, like you claim to be.”
“Your magic is bonded together. Focus on your magic, and yours will lead you to hers.” Severus stated and Draco could see the irritation in his expression.
“I am going to get out of here with or without your help, Tom, but you are going to end here, I can promise you that.” Harry then pushed all the memories of anyone else he may have forgotten towards Voldemort, and then anything else that made him happy. Harry watched as Voldemort slowly faded away, and when he was gone, a fireplace turned green and Harry stepped towards it.
“7 pm on the day back from break, Weasley. Don’t be late. You are dismissed.” Snape said and Draco put Tally down and sent her off. Ron groaned, but he turned and walked out of the room in a huff. Draco moved to follow him, but Severus caught his arm. “Don’t even think about it, Draco. I know you actually did what Mr. Weasley accused you of. Now how did you do it?”
“I’m sorry, Harry. I didn’t mean to treat you the way that I did after the battle at Hogwarts. I was just trying to cope with Fred’s death, and so caught up in what was going on immediately with me to not even give you a second look. I’m sorry for that.”
“I can’t be certain, because this bond between you two isn’t a normal bond; it I something new something no one knows about. This could be the outcome or it could be better, but it could also be worse. Best case, your magic unravels after one dies and you live the rest of your life without any problems. Worst case, you die instantly upon the other’s death.”
“You aren’t upset about it?”
“Yes, Draco.” She questioned after seeing the concern in her eyes.
“No, Harry. That’s not what I meant. Are you alright with this?” Draco asked as he pointed at the bit mark. Harry laughed as soon as he realized what Draco meant.
“I just wanted you to know, I didn’t mean to be such a problem.”
“You’ve told me everything that is on your mind, and I appreciate that. I completely understand why you act the way you do around me, it’s understandable to everyone. Do you want to find out why you had to lose your parents, why Dumbledore planted you in that house, why he left you there, and did nothing about it? Do you want answers, Harry? Answers that the old man didn’t and won’t give you until you stumble upon them.”
“Yes, it’s how he came back to possess your sister, Weasley.” Severus said.
“Good. How much of your allowance do you still have?”
“I thought you released them?” Draco questioned.
“Yeah, I think it is. If not Hermione will probably come back up and yell at me.” Harry laughed and kissed Draco again.
“Yes, once, never did it again.”
“You are still being serious, Cissy. Right?” Andromeda asked and she had a confused look on her face. She tried to make sure that Narcissa was being serious or not.
“I never said that I thought that this was Harry’s fault, Draco. I’m just informing you that if this happens often I will be having more than just this conversation with you. Understood?” Narcissa stared Harry and Draco down and Harry just nodded, but Draco muttered yes, ma’am under his breath. Narcissa walked away and Harry looked at Draco.
“You are welcome, my boy, and sleep well.” Draco walked out the door and down the staircase as he headed towards the hospital wing.
“Good, if you have any questions don’t be afraid to ask. Okay?”
“Harry, oh merlin. How are you?” Ginny asked as she ran up and wrapped her arms around Harkin. When Ginny pulled away, she took Harkin’s face between her hands to look at the bruise on her face. “It looks better than it should, but I am sure Draco did something to help with it last night.” Ginny stated, and Harkin blushed a little bit.
“Draco, Mr. Potter is not in danger from anyone in this room.” Severus said, but Draco turned his head to the side and growled at him, too.
“Then we’ll just have to get it out of our system.” Harry smirked as she straddled Draco’s lap, and pulled him in for a kiss. Her hips ground forwards into Draco’s erection causing a groan to escape his lips, and his arms wrapped around her bringing her closer to him. She gasped as Draco’s erection slipped beneath her, and Draco smirked this time. Harry wrapped her arms around his neck and rested her forehead against his shoulder as he slipped inside her, and she released a soft gasp from surprise against his ear.
“Draco, are you saying what I think you are saying?” Harry asked. Draco leaned forwards so his lips were right next to Harry’s ear.
“He said no one would want me after their through with me. He said I’d be the Death Eaters personal…” Harry trailed of as her voice faltered.
“What have they done to her?”
“Ah…” Draco screamed as he fully seated himself in Harkin’s heat, and he paused. “My raven you are so…so tight. It’s delightful.” Draco moaned, and he’s head fell backwards. “Mmm…you are amazing, my beautiful raven.” Draco moaned as a whimper escaped Harkin’s lips.
Draco pushed his broom towards where Harry just zipped and zoomed faster to catch up. Draco leveled with Harry, and he looked over at her with a smirk. Harry looked over at Draco and she smirked back at him. “Feels like old times.” She said and zipped past him.
“I’m wonderful. You’re just here, and you’re going to be spending most of the summer here anyway, and I don’t think that with this magic bond thing we have we won’t be able to be that long away from each other for long. Severus said we were practically married through our magic, and that’s all I can think of is being married to you, but I can wait until we are both 17 at least to get married if you want, and I just want you here where I know no one can hurt you ever, and I know about your family, and I just can’t have that. I also know that if I ever see them I will be going to Azkaban for cursing the lot of them. I just want to know you are safe and I can’t do that unless you are here with me under the wards around Malfoy Manor. I just love you, and need you safe.” Draco confessed and Harry stared at him in shock.
“What are you talking about?”
“No, I didn’t. I was always just focused on trying to calm him.”
“Ginny, how are you?”
The group moved to how their break went and casual talk after that, and nothing exceptional happened; Harkin woke up about halfway through the trip, and apologized to everyone. The rest of the ride went smoothly until they pulled into the station at Hogsmeade.
“Miss Granger, look up.” McGonagall said and Hermione did so. McGonagall watched as Hermione’s eyes lit up. She levitated the Diadem down and she pulled out the Sword of Gryffindor from her bag and placed the Diadem on the ground. The sword plunged down and impaled the Diadem, and it released a scream that resembled those of Harry’s. Everyone else came running from other places in the room at the screams, and when they reached where Hermione and McGonagall were standing they looked at the remains of the Diadem.
“I’m sorry, Harry.” Remus muttered.
“She was raped three weeks ago.” Draco stated with clenched fists.
“He had a nightmare, and I finally got him calmed down enough to go back to sleep. Why would I bring him down here?” Draco asked.
“Found what, Draco?” Lucius questioned.
“When am I not, Siri?” Harkin smiled.
“Are you sure, love? Because I can keep tickling you.” Draco whispered into her ear seductively, and Harry shivered against him.
“That is the right password young man, but you are not a Gryffindor.”
“Nothing, let’s just get dressed and go downstairs to the dining room for breakfast. Mother and Father are probably already down wondering where we are anyway.” Draco said as he smiled down at her and then he leaned down and kissed her on the forehead, before climbing out of bed and walking over to the closet naked. Harkin smiled as she followed her naked fiancée to their closet and she pulled on a blue dress while Draco pulled on his normal suit with a blue tie to match her dress.
“No, do you know what it looks like?” Hermione asked as she turned towards McGonagall and the rest of the teachers.
Draco leaned down and captured Harry’s lips with his own; Harry pulled back as far as he could and looked Draco in the eyes. “My turn to ask you a question. How long?” Harry asked hoping that Draco understood, because he couldn’t figure out how to say it right.
“No, Mr. Malfoy you are not. Other students just found it strange that you dragged Miss Potter in here the way you did.”
Draco invited Harry over to the Manor the summer after their second year at Hogwarts, and when he showed Harry the room that would eventually be called Harry’s bedroom, Harry’s emeralds had a certain sparkle to them. When Draco told Harry that the room was his and only his whenever he was over Harry wrapped his arms tightly around him in a hug.
“Well, after I killed him in front of the lot of them I suspect they fled as quickly as possible.”
“I forgot what I was going to say when you turned around and said my name like that.”
“Help me, please.” Bellatrix pleaded. “You’re too noble not to help.” She finished with an insult.
“Ah, completely understandable. Mr. Potter’s soft spot always was his parents you make the wrong comment and he would go off. We might be able to use that to our advantage.” Snape said as he looked around the room to find something that the rest of them didn’t know what to look for.
“Yeah, I have to go talk to Professor McGonagall.” Harry tried to get out of the bed, but Draco was quicker than she was and as she stepped out of the bed, she fell and Draco caught her.
“Good. What time is it?” Harry asked as she sat up and started climbing out of bed.
“I don’t know what I’m going to do yet. I figured that I’d wait to make a decision for when I find out I’m pregnant or not.”
“Yes, they are different. With muggles they let you live on your own, and you are practically an adult. With wizards you are in between an adult and a child, and this means that you will be shadowing us, Narcissa and I, to take over the Malfoy fortune. Draco, I will be starting to show you how to run the finances, and when I think you are ready you will take over completely.”
“You said the Rodolphus Lestrange did this.”
“Draco, if you stare at me any harder, you will burn a hole in me,” Harry commented as Draco quickly glanced away as if he was trying to make it look like he wasn’t staring at Harry. Harry stood up and rested his hands on either of Draco’s shoulders, and forced him to look back up at him. Draco finally looked up at Harry and Harry said, “I’m fine. Trust me, I’ve been through worse.” Draco nodded at Harry and stepped away.
They followed Ginny and Ron out into the corridor, and then they made a turn to head upstairs, and this through up red flags for Harkin, and she stopped immediately. “No.” Harkin stated, and Draco stopped as well. Initially because Harkin did, but then to turn towards Ron. “Did you place the Imperius curse on your sister, Ron?” Harkin asked as she finally saw the glazed over eyes that Ginny’s eyes shouldn’t be, and Harkin pulled her wand out of her pocket as did Draco.
“Thank you; I understand you didn’t have to go through all that trouble, so thanks.”
“Oh, so we’re going there already, alright. Do you want to know what said Death Eater did?”
“We’re talking, Professor. I’m sorry if we were breaking any rules. I did not realize.” Malfoy covered, and Harry was very impressed.
“Sirius, he’s fine. He’s just a little out. You aren’t even supposed to be here. What did Dumbledore say? Stay out of sight, you’re supposed to be dead,” Shouted a voice that was coming near the doorway and in walked a man that Draco knew for sure, Professor R. J. Lupin, their Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher in their third year. “Dora knows what she is doing.”
“I think you’re missing my intentions, Draco.” Harry leaned forwards and kissed Draco on the lips pushing at Draco’s lips a little to try and get him to react. After a little prodding, Draco started kissing Harry back. Eventually, they pulled away from each other to breathe.
“I’m sorry, Draco. Bella had a portkey that I definitely did not foresee.” Lucius stated.
“I’m proud of you.” she whispered as she reached up and grabbed his tie to pull him down onto the bed next to her. “Have you ever stood up to your father ever? To his face or not.”
“Cali, I wish for you to move Mistress Harry’s clothes from her trunk and into Master Draco’s closet, and organize them accordingly. Her dresses may stay in her wardrobe, and anything that the Dark Lord may have bought her can stay in that dresser. Anything that Miss Potter had before may go in the closet. Her undergarments may stay in the dresser as well.”
“Draco, just ask her when she comes back. Stay with you injured fiancée.” Harkin said, and Draco sat back down on the bed.
“I’m dead I have to find joy somewhere.” Draco murmured as he took the potion out of her hands and placed it back in Harry’s. “Drink.” Draco instructed, and Harry uncorked the bottle and downed it, and then he handed the bottle back to Draco.
“Mum is winning.” Draco said as he brushed some of Harry’s hair behind her ear, and he kissed her temple. “How did it go with the Minister?” Draco asked without looking up from the game.
“If you are going to just burst into a room Weasley, you should make sure you want to know what’s on the other side of the door. Now that being said. If you wake him I will not hesitate to hex you, Weasley.” Draco stated calmly, and Weasley turned to the sound of his voice. His eyes widened as his eyes met Draco’s and then over to the raven haired boy in his arms.
“Yes, but we would like to be informed when you decide to leave. You might be used to doing whatever you want whenever you want, but you are part of our family, and also carrying the next generation of Malfoy and Potter. You have to be careful, you have to think about more than yourself, there are two of you now, Miss Potter.” Lucius scolded.
“Subconsciously, most definitely, probably even a little consciously.” Severus stated.
“Hospital wing. His entire body is purple.” George chuckled. “I told him that that one wasn’t ready to be tested yet, but he had to prove me wrong.”
“They’ll be found, dragon. We just have to keep her safe until then.”
“Harry, are you alright? I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…” Draco was saying before he was cut off by a kiss from Harry.
“Now, everything.”
“I don’t. What is going on?” Sirius stated, and Harkin and Draco laughed.
“Of course, Professor.” Pansy said with a small head nod, before she turned and walked away.
“That’s all you said?”
“I did it because that was not the orders he was given. He was supposed to bring you to me unharmed, and he did not. I found out because I read his mind. He was thinking about it the entire ball as he stared at the way I danced with you. Now what do you mean you dreamed it?”
“No, but I can smell which way Draco went.” Remus shrugged.
“Mum, still in pain. Please, let me go.” Draco muttered, and Narcissa gently placed him back on the bed. “Where is Harkin? Is she alright?’ Draco questioned as he looked around and then saw her lying on the bed next to him, and the amount of blood that was on Severus’ hands. “No,” Draco whispered as he was off of his bed and over to the one next to his in a flash. “I stepped in the way; how did this happen?” Draco asked as he looked up at Severus for answers.
“Harry, I love you. I know that for certain,” Draco whispered to Harry after he caught his breath. Harry rolled and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and Draco wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulders pulling him closer.
“Mum, what is this plan of yours?”
“Courting, like royalty?” Harry blushed, and Draco smiled.
“Yes, but what does that do to a person, especially a person who has another person growing inside them.”
“Harry, you honestly think Dumbledore didn’t tell us that he kidnapped you. I know he sent you.”
“May I ask how Mr. Longbottom knows what Mr. Zabini might have meant by his actions?”
“No, it’s fine. He’s busy, and he’s cleaning up Lucius’ mess and reestablishing the Malfoy name. He needs to do this, and I understand that.” Harkin stated.
“Yes, just give me a moment.” Harry said as she finally got the last quill in her bag. “There. You shall, but first I have to ask you something.”
She appeared, and looked Draco up and down. “I sure hope, you have good reason to be asking for a healer from St. Mungos to come to my ward and look at Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy.”
"Maybe. Maybe not. That all depends on you, Potter.” A male voice said from the corner of the room. Harry eyes meet the man’s and he pulled Teddy closer to him.
Harry’s hands worked their way down Draco’s sides and to his waist. His hands then moved around and started working on Draco’s pants. They were unbuttoned, unzipped and off his hips in an instant. Draco magically pulled his curtains around his bed as he worked on getting Harry’s pants off, and when the two were finally naked, they both groaned as their rock hard erections rubbed together. Draco, being on top of Harry, started kissing his way down Harry’s jaw, neck, chest and abdomen until he reached Harry’s groin.
“What’s going on?” she muttered sleepily, and Draco smirked at the comment.
Draco was about to pull on his pants when Harry dropped to her knees. “Harry, what are you…” Draco trailed off as Harry took his length in her mouth and started sucking him off. She swirled her tongue just right making Draco moan. His fingers found their way into Harry’s hair, and she braced her hands on his hips. Her one hand started playing with his bullocks, and he whispered, “Merlin, Harry.” Harry rolled his bullocks in her hand as she swirled her tongue, and Draco whispered, “I’m going to come, love.” And Harry sucked a little harder and he came down her throat. After she swallowed everything, she pulled off him, and he pulled her up to his lips and kissed her.
“Voldemort broke the stasis charm and all of your wards? Where did you find him?”
.” Harry sneered the last word as she turned away from Malfoy, but he could faintly hear the tears streaming down her face with the slight sobs. Malfoy walked up behind her and wrapped his arms around her and laid a kiss on top of her head when he felt her tense inside his grasp.
“I believe you, dragon. Why don’t we go and get some fresh air.” Narcissa said as she slipped her arm through Draco’s, and they headed down the hall to the lobby, where they walked out the front doors onto the street. “Dragon, I know this is difficult for you. Your father was a nervous wreck the first few months after we found out I was pregnant with you. He was constantly by my side making sure I was alright. The Dark Lord was furious with your father, but your father fought his case with the Dark Lord. I honestly think those months I was pregnant with you were the only times he argued and went against the Dark Lord. He loved me, and he wanted to make sure I was alright.”
“Draco, how much did you spend on this ring for Harry?” Lucius drawled as he dug his fingers into his temples.
“Really, that sounds like fun actually. So after Arthur, you’ll go to Bill, right. How are you going to find him? His house is under a Fidelius charm. Then you’d go to Charlie, right? Who is in Romania, by the way? No one knows exactly where in Romania, but he’s there. Then there’s Percy. Probably the easiest since he works at the Ministry. Then after Percy there is George, who after the loss of Fred, kind of went all paranoid, and no one can get close to him without someone close to him, but after three more of his siblings die plus his father, I’m thinking you won’t even be able to find him. Then if you somehow manage to kill George, you come to Ron and Ginny. They’re going back to Hogwarts this year, so they’ll be under the best protection that the wizarding world has, being inside the school grounds for the next nine months. That sounds like a lot of work, now that I say that out loud. Are you sure you’re up for that?” Harry asked, and then Rodolphus drew the knife back and threw it at Harry, and it lodged in his shoulder. Harry felt as the knife drained him. “Is this coated in Dark magic?” Harry asked.
“In other words you are wasting my time.” Harry turned and continued walking, and he barely noticed the small crowd growing. Harry felt as Malfoy grab her arm, and he pulled her into one of the empty classrooms. “What the hell, Malfoy?” Harry squealed as Malfoy shut the door.
“A snitch cake.” The Weasley’s said almost in sink, but Molly’s voice was heard above all others.
“Did you just say she looked scary like her mother?” Severus said.
“Hey.” Harkin said as she reached over and grabbed Draco’s chin with her hand, forcing him to look at her. “Just because I am better than you at Quidditch doesn’t mean a thing, and to top it all off I’m just amazing all around.” Harkin smiled
“For about 45 minutes.”
Our sources say that a letter was sent to the Wizengamot as a recommendation letter. Our source couldn’t find who wrote the letter, because it’s under pretty tight lock and key, but the secret writer must be pretty high up on the totem pole for their word to actually matter to the Wizengamot.
“Yes, why?”
“She said as long as you are welcome.” Harry hissed and pulled the man back completely on the bed.
neatness, your orderly way.’ That’s interesting.”
“Is he alright? Should he go to the hospital wing?” Harry heard Hermione ask.
“Can everyone leave? I feel Miss Potter needs time to recuperate and stress is not good for her healing process.” Mel stated.
“No, usually the calming draught has that affect, but given my power levels, doesn’t make that affect as prominent for me and Harkin.” Draco explained.
“I’m an excellent potions student.” Draco stated. “I actually made some of the stash in the cabinet. Plus I can read my own handwriting.” Draco finished.
Harry reached the Great Hall and walked over to the Gryffindor table and turned to sit down and found the hall staring at her. Harry just rolled her eyes and sat down at the table, and she started eating without paying attention to anyone else. Harry finished eating just as Ron and Hermione sat down. Harry stood up and walked out of the hall and as she reached the door, she felt as if someone was burning a hole through her. She turned to find Malfoy staring at her. Harry shook her head and walked out of the room, and she was just starting to climb the staircase when she felt a hand wrap around her arm.
“Yeah, he didn’t know. At the time anyway. I was trying to find a way to help Remi.” Sirius said with a smile as he looked at Remus.
“Let yourself heal a little more and actually be discharged from the hospital before you go running around. Alright?” Draco said as he pulled her back in the bed, and he laid down next to her and covered them up. “Just sleep and heal, love.” Draco whispered as he rubbed circles against her skin. They both eventually drifted off to sleep.
“Yeah, just one second.” Harry said as he shimmied his hips a little and wrapped his legs around Draco. Draco moaned as Harry shifted around his hard erection still sheathed inside Harry, but when Harry was done shifting, he said, “Alright, right there.”
“So Potter, what is it that you remember?”
“No, I’m going not to. That isn’t the plan, can you try to believe that?”
Harry moaned at the new pleasure, and Draco slipped his finger inside causing Harry to gasp. Draco noticed the change and slipped another finger inside, and he prodded a little farther causing gasp and moan. Draco continued to play with that spot as Harry got more and more vocal, and Draco smirked around Harry’s breast. Harry arched her back as Draco stroked his fingers against her walls and then slowly pulling them out, and when Draco’s fingers escaped Harry’s heat, Harry whimpered and thrusted her hips back towards Draco’s fingers.
“Of course not, though now I’m not sure what to talk to you about, but you are still my best friend’s baby, and I would not abandon you ever. Especially when you need me most.”
“What type of information?”
“It’s alright, dragon. Mel will stay with Harry, and you’re going to stay with me in the other room, dragon. You’ll both be fine.”
“Ronald, if she does want to tell us then she doesn’t have to. Don’t force her, or you might just lose your best friends.” Hermione stated as she wrapped her arm around Harry’s shoulder. “I’m not going to force you to say anything, Hun, but we’re just worried about you, and we’ll be there when you are ready to talk.” Hermione said to Harry. Harry looked up at Hermione and nodded at her, but then turned to Ron and scolded.
“Potter! Malfoy! Here, now!” Snape ordered as the two boys dismounted and walked over to the professor with curious eyes.
“Then why haven’t you done anything to help yourself?” Draco questioned.
“I would, but you have to make it sound more convincing. With all this laughing I’m not sure if I want to.” Draco said as he started tickling her, and she started trying to squirm out of his reach.
“Then there is only one place the Dark Lord can be.”
Would he be disgusted by her treatment or would he laugh wing her face? She figured the best option was to stay quiet like she planned. She continued to let him pull her around the dance floor, and soon the night was almost over. She was pulled around the room and introduced to all of the Death Eaters, and at the end she was brought to a table where Snape, Lucius and Narcissa were sitting.
“Far from it, but we will hopefully have her back soon. In the meantime we’re having a little discussion up in the headmaster’s office if you’d like to join.” Draco was up and across the room before Severus could finish and they walked back up to the headmaster’s office to find Ron and Hermione waiting as Severus asked.
“Malfoy, how is he?” she asked as Draco sat down in the chair across from her.
“That’s not what we meant Draco and you know it. What are you doing wrapped around Potter?” Blaise said plainly as he motioned between Draco and Harry.
“Yes,” Draco replied.
“I wasn’t going to say anything, but I was thinking about what your father is going to say when he sees it.” Harkin stated, and Draco froze mid-stride and swore under his breath, causing Harkin to smile wider.
“I’m courting Harry, Granger. Is that alright?” Draco cut in, and Hermione took a step back.
“We’ve been out there for 45 minutes.”
“See the difference between Draco and my father are the bond I have with Draco. Draco can just touch me and my emotions mellow out.” Harry stated as she walked up behind Draco and nuzzled her face into his hair inhaling his smell, before she lifted her head and turned back towards Sirius.
“Yes, you can continue.” Sirius said, and Harkin laughed as she wrapped her arms around her godfather.
“It’s fine. I’d rather it be me than you or Teddy. I’ll see you over Christmas break. Tell me anything that happens with the little guy. I want pictures.”
“Mel Hawthorn?” Sirius questioned.
“As was I, darling, but I digress. I came up here to see if you were up to a little lesson on diner manners and utensils?” Narcissa questioned.
“No, but it helps me. Now, Mipsy, will help you get dressed, and then she will pack up the wardrobe I have provided for you, and we will be departing. Malfoy Manor seems nice this time of year. I think I will see how right you are about Lucius’ intentions. Nagini will be your protector, and I have a little job that I want to plan with you.” Voldemort stood up and walked away, and as soon as the door was closed, Mipsy apparated inside and picked out an outfit for Harry to where. This was the first time that Harry had gotten to see inside her wardrobe, and she saw it was completely stocked full of dresses. There were no jeans or trousers in sight, just knickers and dresses and corsets.
Draco leaned back down and started kissing his neck again, and he positioned myself over Harry’s erection and guided Harry’s erection into his entrance. Both Harry and Draco moaned as they pushed against each other, and Draco went back to work on Harry’s neck as Harry started thrusting into Draco. Harry arched his back and tilted his head back giving Draco a better angle, and Draco took it. Draco adjusted himself, and Harry adjusted himself to thrust himself into Draco. Draco started thrusting down onto Harry and Harry matches his pace, slowly quickening the pace as he went.
“It’s fine, Draco is right. I need to be at my full strength to help the twins, I should be eating more. Even if it doesn’t help the weight gain problem. It needs to be done.” Harkin stated, and then she started focusing on her food in front of her, Draco placed another plate in front of her and she gladly ate it, and then Draco nodded and picked up their bags before helping her up from her seat. “Thank you, Dray.” She whispered, and Draco smiled before wrapping his arm around her waist. They walked out of the great hall and headed to the Transfigurations classroom. They sat down in the front of the classroom and waited for the rest of the class to show up. They talked amongst themselves until class started, and Hermione hurried into the room late, which was unlike her. Harkin gave her a questioning look, and it was returned with a we will talk after class look; Harkin nodded and then turned her attention back to Professor McGonagall. She paid attention and took decent notes; Draco had been helping her with her handwriting, so it didn’t look like chicken scratch, which greatly appeased most of the professors, especially Professor Snape.
“Me, too.” Harkin whispered before falling asleep.
“I guess.” Draco focused on the wards and said, “If you seize fire and promise not to harm any of the residence, I will allow you admittance inside the wards.” The spells stopped, and Draco could see them shaking their heads in agreement. Draco allowed the wards down, and he said, “You may enter.” The group stepped across the wards and the second that everyone was through the wards were back up.
“But you are rubbish at Herbology.” Draco stated as he turned towards her.
“Me! Why didn’t I say anything? I was a little distracted, and you wouldn’t let me get a word in edge wise. Draco when you touch me, I lose all train of thought. How do you expect me to stop you when all I can think of is how great it feels for you to touch me?” Harkin shouted.
“I’ve been better. I really hate Dark magic, and the fact that it is almost impossible to treat when you get it in your system.”
“I don’t know Mr. Weasley punched Mr. Malfoy in the face and then proceeded to yell at him. Mr. Weasley, care to enlighten us?”
“What do you plan on doing with her may I ask? It’s not like I’ll be able to tell her when I’m dead.” Harry tried and hoped that it would work.
“Sorry about that. Everything looks good. There doesn’t seem to be any damage. Though I do recommend that if either of you are injured the other should be there. It’ll help with the healing process. I think Severus is right in regards to your magic. Your cores are entangled together so closely that it appears that you share a core. The down side to this bond is that when one of you is hurt it affects the other, and depending on the injury it could disable the other, meaning you have to be careful, because if you don’t then both of you could be in some serious trouble medically. If one goes down the other will follow especially now that Harry is pregnant; the pregnancy will drain both of you because your magical cores are intertwined and our magical cores are similar to our life forces. Though we can live without our magic if we lose it we won’t last long which is why when someone’s magic is taken away their health slowly depletes. The longest I’ve seen or known that someone has lived without their magic is three years, and they weren’t a very powerful wizard.” Healer Johnson finished.
“They don’t have any affect after being removed right?”
“What’s going on?” Harry asked as Hermione shut the door behind hover and turned to Harry. “Something happen while I was out?”
“Same. Can’t wait for the holidays.”
“Wonderful. Dobby is wonderful, Miss Harry Potter. Professor Dumbledore is wonderful to Dobby, he pays Dobby for his services, and Dobby appreciates him. Dobby is free and Dobby knits socks. Professor Dumbledore is teaching Dobby to knit you see.”
“Did you grab our things?”
“You are always welcome, dear.”
“Yes, and I won’t keep it from Theo either. He isn’t his father.” Harkin stated as she looked at everyone in the room.
“Hold on, love.” Draco whispered, and Harry nodded as she leaned into his shoulder.
“You and Lucius grew up together?” Harry asked.
In theory.
“Well, that is a two sided coin. One I really don’t have a choice, and two I’m curious. What is it that this person could have said to make the Dark Lord fear his survival because of me?” Harry asked.
“We were gardening.” Harkin stated confused.
“Alright, Potter let’s get you up to the dorm.” Malfoy picked Harry up and carried him out of the bathroom.
“Harry, love. What is it?” Draco asked as he tried to turn to catch Harry’s eyes.
Sirius sighed as he pulled Harkin closer, and she pulled away. “Siri?”
“No, I think I won’t.” Harkin said as some derby fell from the ceiling, collapsing right on top of her. All she could do was scream, before she fell unconscious.
“I have been given knowledge that the pair of you have been consorting with Albus about my down fall. Yes, Miss Potter gave me the information, but I will tell you she had no control over the situation. I used a combination of Veritaserum and
“Yes, you know we were friends in school, Black.”
“Fine, it is a special compartment to keep you and what is inside you safe from Death Eaters that are still at large. They will be after you, and if they find out about other things they will most definitely be after you.” Severus said as he quickly pulled them into a compartment. “They will want the babies to try and raise them to make them a weapon against you; to train them to kill you if you aren’t already dead from them trying to take the children.”
“Her aunt, uncle and cousin, mostly her cousin.”
“Fortunately I saved him from that fate, and my father is dead no now, so he can’t harm Harry.” Draco answered, and he dropped his arm.
“They have all been dealt with. Narcissa has already told Kingsley where the hideout that Lucius had taken them to was and they are currently being apprehended. I am sorry about your father and your aunt, Draco.”
“You are going to look me in the eyes as I fuck you. Me being the first in your many future endeavors. I’m going to ruin you for anything that’ll last forever.” The man snarled, and Harry whimpered. This was going to be painful and probably damaging, and she knew that. “You’re going to be a duck toy for the Dark Lord’s followers for the rest of your life, Potter. For however long that may be.” Harry’s eyes were wide open as the man’s clothes disappeared, and he forced himself inside her.
“What am I supposed to do, mum?”
“Easy, you can’t touch me.” Harry moaned.
“He’ll forgive me.” Snape said as he picked up Harry. “Who is coming back to Hogwarts with me?” Snape asked as he turned towards Hermione, Ron, and Luna.
“He’s gone? Voldemort’s gone?”
“I didn’t kill him if that’s what you are implying, Parkinson. He’s safe locked in his Manor. You can owl his mother, she will tell you exactly that.” Hermione pushed passed Pansy, and she to the Gryffindor table. She started loading up her plate and she started eating her food. Hermione looked up and saw that everyone was staring at her. “What?”
“I do believe so, darling. We might have to test it out later, but I think you do.” Narcissa said, and Harkin blushed again.
“Why what are the two options?”
“He’s in his room.” Harkin said as she walked passed Narcissa and Lucius, and she walked down the stairs to the drawling room where she walked up to the fireplace and fire called Grimmauld Place.
“Sorry, love.” Draco whispered as he pulled her into his arms and kissed her temple. “What is going on?” Draco asked rather harshly to his father.
“What do you mean that isn’t Harry?” Ginny said. “I know my boyfriend anywhere.”
Soon he was cumming and then he pulled out. “Mipsy!” he shouted and the house elf from before showed up. “I want you the clean her up and make her presentable for the Dark Lord. She’s going to be doing a very special task. If she tries to escape again use any means to make sure she is captured and alive.” Nott then walked out of the room, and Harry was left beaten, bruised, and bloody in the room with the small house elf. The house elf went about making a bath, and she pulled Harry over to the bath and went about cleaning her thoroughly and properly.
“I do have to say I am curious now.” She walked out of her office door and walked towards the bed that Harry was lying on, and Draco sat down on the edge of the bed while Madam Pomfrey stood at the end. “Harry, dear. I’m sorry to have to inform you of this, but you’ve been attacked in the corridors by another student. We aren’t sure who it was, but they beat you pretty bad and erased your memory of the events.”
“If that is your compromise with mother, I guess I can deal with that. Just knock before entering the bedroom please.” Draco stated before he turned and continued down the corridor.
“Because it started with you saving the world by getting bit by a very big, very poisonous snake which lead to you defeating the darkest wizard in a long while. You are also just like your mother in your stubbornness.” Severus smiled.
“Draco will handle it. I’m sure it’s just morning sickness or something. The little Malfoy will take care of her.”
She looked at the box and then up at Draco, and he just smiled at her. She took the box in her hands, and she slowly opened the small box. Harkin gasped as she saw what was in the box. “Dray?” She questioned.
“That was the point, Draco.” Harkin smiled as she slipped her knickers on, lifting her dress up showing Draco everything.
“I understand.” Draco said.
“Really?” Harkin questioned.
“I agree.” Harkin stated.
“No, I usually come up here every morning just for a daily stroll and when I’m done I usually do my homework in my private room next to the library.”
“I’ll be fine. Thank you.” she whispered, and Draco pulled her closer.
“Explaining. You two get dressed and meet us in the dining room you’ll be hungry. Narcissa, Lucius, if you would please follow me.” Severus said and then turned from the room and left. Narcissa and Lucius looked at Draco and Harry before quickly following behind Severus.
“No, I don’t think so. Can I just come down with you?”
Mipsy packed up the rest of the dresses, and Harry noticed that there was at least a small variety in color, not just Slytherin colors. There were a few blues and reds and purples and thankfully no yellows or oranges. Mipsy finished packing and they headed down to the dining room where Voldemort was waiting with breakfast for them. Harry sat down, and she looked at the food.
“How did you calm him down after a nightmare? I’ve been with him day and night for the past six months, and I’ve never been able to calm him down after some of those especially get him back to sleep.” Granger stated. “What did you do to him?”
“Because I was asked to come, Lupin.” Snape said from the doorway.
Hermione kept her company quite often for she was staying at the Manor for the rest of break as was Theo, who took the news two different ways. First he was upset because it was his fault Harkin was in his father’s custody, but after he was reassured that it wasn’t his fault, he was excited to have a younger sibling, and that Harkin and Draco decided to make him the godfather for the twins. He also decided that he would help them take care of the twins during the school year as much as possible; he wanted to try to make up for his mistake, though Harkin and Draco both stated they didn’t blame him.
“I don’t actually know, but there are both muggle and magical plants. We aren’t all prejudice, Harry. Lucius had an interesting father and childhood; his mother died right before I started Hogwarts, and Abraxas raised Lucius similar to how Lucius tried to raise Draco, if I wasn’t in the picture.” Narcissa said as she pulled Harry into a little nook. There was a window seat that looked over the pitch in the back of the Manor. “I like to read here, and you can use it for whatever you like.” Narcissa said as she sat down in the window seat and looked out the window.
“Harkin broke Aunt Bella’s wards. I can feel her.” Draco stated.
“Yes, where else would the Dark Lord keep her?” Draco stated. “I thought my mother released her after I killed the Dark Lord like the others. I swear.”
“But we have all day tomorrow, and I’m tired.” Harkin whispered as she buried her face in his chest.
Well, I had it in the nice box it was going to be a nice truce kind of thing, because I thought that we should call a truce, I mean we’re grown adults, and we should be able to stop acting like children. Both of us were pawns in a game of chess that we didn’t want to be a part of, but got dragged down with the ship as it sank and got stuck. Harry exhaled and Draco stopped him from finishing.
“Yes, so technically until Black is officially cleared of all charges and cleared to be your guardian; Severus is your guardian.”
“Alright.” Draco reached over and grabbed his wand and cast a cleaning charm, cleaning himself, Harry, and his bed sheets. Draco then grabbed his bed sheets and pulled the sheets over both of them, and they both slowly drifted off to sleep in each other’s arms.
“Bath, definitely.” She said as she walked over and stared at all the dials in awe.
“I need some air.” Ron said and he stormed out of the room. Hermione stepped closer and wrapped Harry and Draco in a hug.
“No, Uncle Harry, little man. Can you say Harry?”
“Remus and I both have no coordination. Our significant others are the ones that have the dancing talent. So, I don’t know how well that is going to go.” Harkin stated.
“Harry, were you abused as a kid?”
They went back to Hogwarts where McGonagall escorted Harry and Hermione up to the Gryffindor common room. McGonagall stopped Harry from going in, and said, “Potter, I wanted to inform you that your belongings were moved from the boys’ dorm to a private room in the tower if you wish me to show you.”
“Yes, and test me she will use that time, but she also has to teach you about fine dining. More than a three course meal, fine dining, where you have more than one fork and more than one spoon.” Draco stated, and Harkin pulled away from him and stared him right in the eyes.
The next thing Draco knows is someone is shaking them awake. “Draco, wake up. The first hour is up.” Draco’s eyes fluttered open to find healer Johnson standing next to his mother.
“Mother, what is going on? What is Father planning and why can’t he say it in front of Harry? I don’t understand,” Draco rattled off as if he wasn’t expecting Narcissa to answer anyway. She just shook her head like she didn’t know or like she didn’t want to talk about it. “Mother, please just tell me. I will find out in the morning. Am I or anyone else I care about going to be in danger? That is all I care about, please,” Draco begged his mother to tell him.
“Over there.” Draco whispered back as he pointed to the floor over by her wardrobe. Harkin smiled at him, and she leaned forwards and kissed him before she climbed off his lap and off the bed. She walked over to the wardrobe and bent over to pick up her knickers, her dress sliding up a little to show Draco a little more than need be, and Draco groaned, “You are a tease, Harkin Potter.”
“I don’t know, it was a change, and I kind of like it long. It hides my scar better than with my short hair.”
“I will go let my colleagues know what your answer is. I am discharging you, but I want you to be careful and take it easy, Miss Potter.” Madam Pomfrey said as she flicked her eyes to Draco and then back to Harry.
“Not if you put her back in her room with Teddy, and I write her a note saying I went out for supplies. She would never know the difference,” Harry tried.
“May I ask what it may be about, my boy?”
Harry looked up and looked Draco in the eyes. “Morning, Dray. How did you sleep?” Harry asked as he started laying kisses across Draco’s shoulder and collarbone.
“If she didn’t realize what it was. Tom Riddle’s diary. He destroyed it in the Chamber of Secrets in his second year.” Severus said.
“You can stay right here, my Lord, and Lucius and I will go and see to the preparations of your rooms.” Narcissa said as she stood, pulling Lucius up with her, and they walked out of the room together. Voldemort turned to look at Harry, and she could feel him probing her mind.
“Draco, you’re alright?” she whispered.
“No, I sure hope not.”
“Like I accidentally dropped a house on myself. How’s our baby?”
“Remus and hoping that he can finally have an actual life and family and not have to worry about the fact that he’s a werewolf and that after I get out of here he still will care about me.” Harry said as he pushed every moment that he and Remus have ever shared.
“And Harry is one of these things?”
“She will be safest in his hands. He cannot kill her without killing a piece of himself.”
“Would that alert the Dark Lord of my connection to Harry? I can’t put him at risk I have to try and save him. I can’t lose him. If anything happens to him, Severus; I’m done. I literally can’t lose him.”
“I want you to find and pack Harry’s things for me. I need you to do it as quickly as possible I don’t know if anyone is going to come in here any time soon.”
“Well, Neville said that not many people notice what he is doing but that doesn’t mean that he doesn’t notice them. He said that he has noticed a similar look upon my face at times, which I do not deny, I probably have. But I know Blaise, and I don’t think I would put it passed him to try something on Harry, especially now that he’s a woman. I’m also not saying that he had something to do with this attack but he might try something else. I can’t be completely sure until he either confesses or is caught.”
Harry rolled to the side and sat up with a little help from Draco, and she smile and said, “Good morning, Ronald, Hermione.”
“You’re a…”
“Okay. Let’s hurry up otherwise visiting hours will end.” The pair quickly finished their shower and changed. Harry wore just skinny jeans and a nice blouse, and Draco wore his typical black trousers with a dress shirt and tie. They walked out of Draco’s room holding hands and back to the library where he hoped his parents still were. They walked into the library, and saw them sitting at the table in front of the door. Draco and Harry walked up to them, and Draco sat down next to Narcissa and Harry sat on his lap. “Mum, can Harry and I go visit Arthur at St. Mungos? Harry wants to know how he’s doing.”
Harry’s hands pulled Draco towards her so their lips met, and then started unbuttoning his trousers and slipped them off. Draco stepped out of them and slid them to the side, and he was back between her legs. Harry moaned as Draco’s thumb grazed her clitoris, and he smirked as he moved his thumb again. “Dray…” Harry moaned, and her fingers started unbuttoning the vest Draco was wearing and slipped it off. Draco loosened his tie as Harry started on his dress shirt, and Draco slipped his pants off as Harry finally managed to get his shirt open.
“Mum…” Draco whispered.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It is beautiful, Fawn, and I’m sorry; she has me under the Imperius Curse, and I’m fighting it, but it’s too close to the full moon.” Remus said through clenched teeth.
“Draco, I don’t think anything is going to happen to me inside the wards of the Manor, three stories up in the middle of the floor in your bedroom cradled against your chest. That would be an extremely special trick.” Harry whispered into Draco’s neck with a laugh, and Draco chuckled a little.
“You are not a freak. You are a beautiful young woman, who just so happened used to be a man. You have had some awful things happen to you. Your life isn’t the most ideal, but you have defeated the darkest wizard of all time before your 16
“Has Harry had any interaction with anyone other than me since she woke up?”
“Ronald is just upset over Arthur, Harry, dear. He’ll be fine when the doctors say Arthur’s out of the woods. I don’t blame you dear. Come say hello.” Mrs. Weasley said as she took Harry’s hand and pulled her towards Arthur and away from Draco’s grasp. Draco nearly protested until Harry gave him a look that said to wait, and Draco stopped. Harry walked up to Arthur and he smiled at her.
Voldemort then left the room and Harry was pulled into the bathroom where Mipsy pulled out this extraordinary ball gown, corset included. Harry just smiled and whispered, “Great” under her breath. There was no way she was running away in this outfit. Mipsy got her into the corset with the most difficulty, but once the corset was on Harry stopped struggling. Soon Harry was standing in a green floor length ball gown, and she wondered where they got the dress.
“Draco, put me down.” She giggled as he carried her down the stairs.
“I never said I blamed Theo, love. I’ve known about how his treated him, and Theo is a great person, and would be a great older brother.”
“How much has he eaten in the last few days?”
Draco captured Harry’s lips again, and Draco leaned down and gripped behind Harry’s knees and pulling him up. Harry wrapped his legs around Draco’s waist, and Draco managed to push his way back inside Harry while still kissing him. Harry had both his arms wrapped around Draco’s neck, while Draco had one arm wrapped around Harry’s lower back and his other hand was massaging Harry’s erection. Harry had to pull back from the kiss to breathe while resting his back against the shower wall.
Harry just chuckled at that. “What you were starved and beaten because your aunt and uncle, the only family you had left, knew you were a wizard but didn’t inform you because they wanted to make sure that you didn’t become a…
“Miss Potter accidentally dropped a house on herself and my sister. My guess is she didn’t take in the fact of the structure of the house when she forcibly removed the wards that the structure of the house would become unstable. She took my deranged sister out by dropping a house on her rather Wizard of Oz like Miss Potter.”
“Very good, Ron.” Luna said.
“He is on his way. He is just a little…stiff this morning.” Harkin smiled as she come feel Draco walked into the room, and she looked over to see he tried to find his most loose-fitting trousers he owned, and she smiled at him. Draco just glared back at her, and she laughed.
The stone was cracked and in some places the only thing keeping it together was the stone, and Hermione leaned down and picked it up, and she walked out of the room. Everyone slowly following her as she walked, almost practically ran, to the hospital wing. When she pushed open the doors, she found Harry sitting with his legs pulled up to his chest and his arms wrapped around them, and Draco had his entire body wrapped around Harry, slightly rocking Harry to comfort him with his fingers stroking Harry’s hair.
“Which brings me back to the reason why I don’t like you. Funny how this conversation is going around in circles, isn’t it?”
“If the Dark Lord is gone, Mr. Potter is perfectly safe at Hogwarts. I have gotten rid of the Carrows, and I am looking for a new Defense teacher, Lupin. I am also need a Muggle Studies professor, but that isn’t your concern. I am also aware of Mr. Potter’s task he was given. Horcruxes. The Dark Lord had seven of them and if my calculations are correct there are two left this cup and one more. Though what it is, is unknown as is where it is.”
“Very kind of you, Mr. Malfoy. She will definitely appreciate that. Does she have potions with you?”
“But will the baby. It’s mine, no matter how I became the father, it’s still mine, mum.” Draco muttered.
“Harkin Jamelynn Potter.” Draco said for her, and Harry cuffed him upside the head.
Harry looked really pale, his eyes were blood shot, and he could see the bags under his eyes. Harry knew that something was wrong, but he didn’t know what. Harry was starting to feel light headed again as he walked back through the door, leaning heavily on the doorframe as someone walked in the room. Draco Malfoy? Harry asked himself.
“Uncle Sev, I thought you didn’t do parties?” Draco asked.
“Oh.” Draco muttered as he smiled at the light she was producing with their touch. “I understand.”
