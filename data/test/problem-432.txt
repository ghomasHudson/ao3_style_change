It’s a thin, long building, lined completely down one wall with life jackets, and they’re each handed one by a man who doesn’t see or hear them past his book and radio until Draco clears his throat twice. He points to a sign declaring the jackets compulsory for safety and waves them through to the pier once Draco’s nodded in understanding. Harry hangs his around his neck as they walk.
And in Agnes’ interview, she swore she had no enemies. Harry believes her. But why target the Hogwarts event with a premeditated curse on a Ministry worker and then target random bookshop customers? The orders from Flourish and Blotts going back six months show no purchases for the book or author—the same copy cursed has been in their inventory for much longer.
Then he hears a sound he never thought he’d hear in her home; a page being torn from her personal collection. He lowers his arms entirely in the shock of it and watches her fold and add a page to the envelope. An address is written and it’s sealed and sent out the window.
“He was kind! And a really good cook!” Harry argues, feeling suddenly defensive for his past romances, despite his wish to never see the blunder that was Simon again.
Harry moves closer to the cabinets against the wall and the noise of the Dark magic is overwhelming.
“Darling,” Ron stage-whispers, “Does it count as ‘mates’ talk to tell Harry we’re trying for a second? Ow!”
He’s always found Harry to wear his emotions on his face, but it’s been especially true in the last few days. The look he wore when Draco had been cleaning up dinner in the cabin had been disarming, and almost every expression he’d sent his way since the curse has compounded on it. Even this one, right now, inches from him, is asking a thousand questions that he’d thoughtfully held back. He’s on his best form, his best understanding of Draco; waiting patient, quiet, thoughtful, like a lighthouse, for Draco to come to him. He does now.
Harry wakes early the next morning, the first day of November, feeling rather well-rested, grateful to have an uneventful Halloween firmly in the past, and pleased to see Draco’s still laying beside him.
“No,” he answers, shaking his head as he scrapes food scraps into his remaining pitta. “They thought they could make sure I never knew.”
“They stink,” Draco says, to fill the silence. Complaining seems as good a method to drive away his discomfort as any.
“Draco, if he doesn’t open this mystery definitely-a-broom gift at the table, we’ll be angry,” Ron says. Teddy nods fervently.
. Oh, I’m sorry, do you want an egg? Scrambled, omelette, fried?” He gestures by shaking a raw egg in his hand across the kitchen.
“Be safe,” he says, before pushing him into the bathroom and shutting the door, adding a silencing spell.
—they’ve spent years comfortably past those early idolised interactions. But if it hurt her, then intention didn’t matter, did it?
Upon his return, he took to spending all his time in his private rooms or Flitwick’s office. When he burned through three layers of bedding in an accident involving in-home brewing, he ventured to the dungeons at McGonagall’s request, spending late nights in the Potions classroom experimenting and trying not to think of Severus. His handwriting was still on some of the rarer ingredients’ labels.
Past the collision of his arrival, Draco takes in exactly what he’s fallen upon. Potter is wearing an old hoodie, more of those abominable running shorts, and trainers. His hair is stuck to his forehead, flatter against his head with post-run sweat than it usually sits and his cheeks are still red from the outing.
He hides his face in his hands. “Today’s been dreadful. I keep thinking—why would I do something so stupid and ruin what was going so well? And, what, I thought he’d be interested just because he’s gay?”
He begins weaving through the assorted, kitschy tables, and when he reaches the back of the café he turns sideways to squeeze past. Only when his legs slide past Malfoy’s sight in the thin space between two tabletops does he look up and register his arrival, quickly dog-earing his page and slipping the little book into his coat pocket before Harry can catch the title.
“Yes! What’ll you have done? A Mohawk! Gran took me to Camden and there were loads of blokes with Mohawks. Or you don’t have to do a Mohawk, but you can put designs in the sides with clippers. That’s what I’d want.”
“Alright, now that everyone’s officially here, Harry has an announcement to make,” Draco says suddenly from his left. He has a hand on Harry's knee, which could be a threat for compliance, a gesture of support, or a reminder for later that he loves him even though he's forcing him into a declaration in front of his friends.
They drift back into the quietness. His gaze in the grass drifts to the feet near his. A pair of abysmal trainers, once white, now a dingy, mud-scuffed grey.
“—great privilege to introduce a man you all know, to whom we are all indebted,” Kingsley is asserting with cheek-reddening conviction. “A man of bravery and dedication to our community, who has continued to serve post-war as an exceptional Auror. A warm welcome for Mr Harry Potter!”
They’d have to see him again to understand his appeal. Then they’d see it. You can feel it when he walks in the room, or at least Harry can. It’s electric, his personality. Then they’d see. The very thought feels dangerous—meeting with these two would be like meeting the parents.
One thing might manage to distract him: his trip to Paris had been worth it, even if his mum had forced him into hosting his old potioneer friend back in Chalais long after he’d wished to excuse himself to the study and put the new diagnostic information on Black’s necklace to use. He hasn’t mentioned it to Harry—he’d looked so excited by the very prospect of answers that Draco doesn’t want to tell him about any progress until he’s figured it out completely. He’s optimistic that it’ll be soon.
The entire block feels comfortably discrete, admirably so from one private-yet-recognisable wizard to another, and when he holds the door open for a plump witch and her two children exiting the café, she offers him nothing but a polite smile of thanks.
Soon enough, he’d push his books aside, call one of the elves for tea service, and listen intently while Blaise spoke of something or other, usually a girl or his law studies. He was thoroughly attractive, and had been taking advantage of this at the clubs in a way Draco could only sigh and support from afar.
This he knows shouldn’t be on any records. He opens his mouth to respond, then panics and disapparates.
.” He feels ridiculous, and Draco looks anxious, and Harry wonders vaguely what he’s done to make him so eager to please. He takes a deep breath and shakes it all off. “Are you going to anger me in the near future?”
They both fly high, and whenhe catches sight of Teddy beaming over at him it hits him, like it does sometimes, that he is to Teddy what Sirius would have been to him if he could have had him younger and more dependably. There’s Lupin in him. In his eyes and his lanky, already-lengthening figure, and Nymphadora every time he smiles. Usually, it’s expected. Sometimes, it knocks him over.
He doesn’t often wish for it. He sleeps fine. His nightmares have lessened significantly, pestering him like a bad hip in the rain. If anything will bring them back, though, it’s a chaotic Hogwarts event and a lift ride with his old nemesis.
His nightmares did come back. Wilder, stronger out of dormancy, but when they did she was there. They knew each other inside and out. It’s why he’s certain she didn’t deserve the way things had ended. And why he sees in her expression, despite the way she jokes with Neville, that she’s hurt.
“If all is well,” Harry purrs against his mouth. “Then you’ll have a good explanation for why my yoghurts have disappeared from the fridge.”
“I’m sorry, we’re not going to do that at this time, Harry. Not until Murray says otherwise. Mince pie?”
Bright lights flash in his face and for a brief moment, his body tenses and he reaches for his wand as if it’s an onslaught of hexes. He’s not much relieved when the spots burned in his retinas fade to present a huddle of reporters.
Draco reaches a hand out from the bed and Harry leans forward in the chair to catch it momentarily. Only once his eyes are drifting shut again does Harry start to get comfortable, and he and Pansy spend a while in slightly awkward silence.
on Harry’s face, and when Harry opens his arms, he crawls up the length of the couch to lay on top of him, face pressed against his chest.
Rose grabs at the paper and he lets her, unfolding it and skimming the article. It details Draco’s arrest for the curses—his ‘motives’ and his ‘romantic manipulation’ of the Auror in charge of the investigation to sway it in his favour.
Virginia and Powell help Leonard to his feet with his arms laced around their necks, then lead him slowly to the storeroom. Just like that, Harry is left alone with Malfoy, a slightly wrecked bookshop, a cursed object, and stolen potions ingredients. In the sudden quiet of the shop, he can hear the shopkeeper maintaining calm with the few remaining customers outside, no doubt itching to return to the mess Harry’s left him.
Hermione knocks lightly, then ducks her head in when she’s happy to see them sitting casually. “Harry, I’ll trade you,” she says, and when she enters further, he sees that she’s pulling Draco in by the wrist. His eyes flicker with something upon meeting Harry’s, even if his expression doesn’t change among mixed company.
Harry sits, sweating through his jumper for reasons unrelated to the pub’s temperature, as they discuss the match. When Ron returns with a drink for Ginny and seconds for himself and Harry, he accepts ardently.
It’s kind of symbolic that he’s repurposing his office for something he loves. Draco doesn’t see any Ministry work in here anyway—there’s far more on his dining table, on the sofa, even in Draco’s study. He looks up from where he’s been organising all the equipment he hadn’t asked Harry to buy.
“Where are the cursed objects?” Draco asks, moving deeper into the entryway and sweeping a hand down the wood stair railing. He lifts a finger to his eye line and rubs the dust between his index finger and thumb.
Hermione lays her hands flat on the table definitively, determined to repair the strange downswing in conversation. “Rose said the funniest thing this morning—“
Harry looks away, accidentally making eye contact with Ginny in the process, who recognises something in his face and gives him a slight shake of her head in fair warning, but he’s too irate to let it go.
He moans, adjusting his hips, and Draco chuckles low. “My god,” he whispers. “Tell me you don’t like me berating you while I touch you. We’d have to finally confront our troubled past.”
From Paharganj, Draco apparates them to Meena Bazaar. It’s an older market, corridors carved tall with barrel-vaulted archways, storeys high. Domed bays off the arcade serve as shops, piled with finery; glittering jewellery, embellished saris, ornate dishes. Harry’s almost too distracted by the shine of it all to recognise Draco’s travelling for what it is, but he stops just in the entrance.
“Well, I have to work with him either way. I could at least try to decipher what bit’s personal and what isn’t. I reckon I’m just the closest punching bag because I’m daft enough to keep trying.”
Draco feels a surge of annoyance when he looks past him for the umpteenth time as if he cares about whatever the game score is. At his question, though, two wide green eyes snap back to him with abrupt alertness. “What do
At least, he thinks, in the Ministry building he’s safe from anything truly nefarious. If Hermione’s analysis is correct—and she has much more reason to have her wits about her than he does—then there is no immediate physical danger. Surely if Murray had been planning to take a more direct approach, he wouldn’t have brought the likes of Lucrezia and a couple of Junior Aurors, plus an official arrest order.
To an outsider, their occasional and growing inclination to finish each other’s sentences when they get going would be a good reason to spend some time apart. But there’s no outsider here to slow down their orbit.
Draco was fine. Likely sore, surely exhausted, but fine. It had been a poison-laced item—they don’t know the specifics—but it’s been treated. Apparently, Draco was offering slurred, whispered advice to the Healers, then slurred, whispered berating when they dared question his advisement.
“When you’re better at it, it feels like a thousand voices shouting at you when you’re trying to hear someone whispering directly in your ear,” he explains. “And then once you’re even
He wonders what Jack would think if he texted him right now, asked him to train together. He likes Lars, but Jack is such a different fighter. The challenge of their spars was enticingly dissimilar. Would that be leading him on? And if he still found Jack attractive, but hadn’t nailed down the cause of his hesitation, would it be wrong to reach out at all?
He conjures back that feeling in the bookshop, of expecting the nudge of magic from a cursed book and instead getting hit with a crashing wave from behind. He’s not sure how he kept his composure.
Harry grows dizzy looking over Draco’s shoulder, their cheeks close, and finds that he’s being led well enough and in a close enough embrace to just close his eyes. He lets himself be carried along by Draco’s confident grasp in the darkness.
broadcast him as gay? Is it a crime, now, an advert, to choose one’s clothes tastefully? Maybe to someone like Potter—seemingly too heterosexual to own anything but denim.
And Harry’s eyes, his bright green eyes, don’t match Draco’s anger as they should, but instead are large with worry, with exasperated patience, his mouth curved down. And just as
Draco continues to put on airs, snapping back quickly at her jokes, affecting exhaustion when she asks of Luna, trying not to fidget. He’s not nervous to see Potter, despite Pansy’s continual teasing, but there’s no telling how long he’ll resent his old professor for forcing him into an entire banquet for some charms questions—he’d thought their academic relationship was strong enough to grab a pint, at least.
His only problem, as of now, is that no matter how professionally Potter writes, Draco imagines him sending letters in those scant red running shorts with a little muggle box of wires around his neck. Ridiculous. Unbecoming.
Harry puts a hand between his shoulder blades and rubs circles like Hermione’s done for him. They move again, leaning together this time, down the hall and into bed and Draco falls into it with an exhale like it’s not exactly where he’d been all day. He opens his arms and beckons Harry with the flutter of his hands.
He dares a glance back up and meets Harry’s eyes. He had leaned forward in interest, or to take another water from the bag. Either way, he was twice as close, his eyes soft and brightened from within.
“It’s nothing.” Draco works hard to manage his voice, to keep it casual despite his growing panic, and to not look right at Harry as he says it. “She’s nothing at all. My mum shouldn’t have written.”
Draco reaches out and curls Harry’s finger back around the chain. “It’s yours. And you don’t have to thank me, I wanted to. But if you fancied giving me permission to write it up for my book. With all parties anonymous, of course…”
Draco looks at him carefully, that same look in his eyes that leads Harry to believe that there’s What He Says and, separately, What He Thinks.
They sit quietly for a moment, Harry pressing a hand to his side where it’s throbbing, Ron watching him.
His voice trails off. His chest rises unevenly and without warning, he reaches out a hand to grip Harry’s arm securely, as if to confirm he’s real, or that he’s not about to run. In the post, sitting atop a couple plain envelopes, is a small paper-wrapped package. It’s perfectly unassuming. His name is on it.
It’s not the actual kiss that bothers him, he surmises, but the lack of disclosure. Draco had embraced him as he confessed to feeling overwhelmed by the speed with which his life is changing, even as he withheld further information that could be a bigger bomb the longer it sat unsaid. If he’d just told Harry. If he’d just said what had happened outright, then it wouldn’t come as a surprise. It wouldn’t be the next event in a series of sudden and unexpected changes to people and places he hadn’t expected to change.
And of course Narcissa was happy to host, thrilled to put her acreage to use. She spent most of the night conducting the house-elves and sweeping among the upper echelon academic circle he’d politely invited. The longest he spoke to her was during dinner, served under large tents constructed in the expansive land behind the main house and lit warmly with floating candles and fairy lights. They sat in circles of five; Draco, Narcissa, Harry, Blaise, and Pansy.
Draco nods vaguely, too busy wondering over Harry’s ability to move so quickly through the news that a colleague wants him dead.
—it’s fading. He tries to look back to Draco, to tell him he knows, but Lucrezia is raising her wand right at Harry and he feels a strong hand tightening on his shoulder again.
Draco cocks his head, pulling his jumper sleeve subconsciously. Potter somehow sees the question in his face.
When he returns, Pratik holds a thick print in his hands, the length and width of a large book cover, and he slides it gently across the counter to Harry. He’s not sure what he’s looking at. It’s a portrait, painted but charmed to move. There are seven figures, old and young, a few children. It can’t be, and yet—
doesn’t sound too good. Draco watches him thoughtfully anyway, still too pallid for Harry’s liking, and takes a long time to respond. It’s an unspeakable relief when he steps closer into Harry’s space and drops his forehead onto his shoulder.
He stands and squeezes past Harry, who’s looking up at him with sudden wide-eyed excitement. “Should I come with you?”
“So it’s Georgia’s day off, and Erin starts chatting shit about her in the booth, thinking we’re on commercial, saying ‘oh, thank Circe Georgia’s not in today, she’s a
of work, involving a miscommunication with an Indian shipper when it wasn’t clear that he wanted the exact broom from the small shop they visited in New Delhi, then customs, registering a foreign broom with the Ministry, and hiding it from Harry for weeks. He squeezes Harry’s leg under the table. “It was nothing.”
Such cheerfulness should be off-limits, Harry thinks crankily, especially when he’s barely gotten both feet off the lift and onto the Auror department floor, but he smiles back at Cassie anyway. He’d barely made it to work at all—travelling with a morose determination to focus on the case; where he’d been dissuaded by bureaucratic challenges before, he’s now feeling positively defeated. Still, he
It’s Hermione’s turn to look scandalised. “He doesn’t have to tell us anything he doesn’t want to,” she scolds.
Only now, following him back through the pub, does he notice Harry’s entire table watching them. He’s sure that if he looked back, his friends would be doing the same. A few people are sitting on one side of the garden so Harry walks the opposite way, until they’re out of earshot and mostly out of sight. Only then does he turn back, arms crossed.
Hermione would love to hear this. It’s ingenious. He can almost see this new Malfoy getting along well with her, past in the past, if he’d put the attitude aside. And considering her knowledge of his academics, he thinks maybe she’d agree.
“What a wonderful skill. She always made you out to be so smart, it’s nice to see she was right and not just biased.”
Harry considers saying nothing, just as he had when he rejoined them from the beer garden. But it’s clear that he’s been found out regardless, and he reckons disparaging Malfoy had always been therapeutic in the past...
Hermione shoots him an apologetic glance, no legilimency necessary to know it wasn’t a deep desire for punctuality that loosened his tongue.
If he were to risk a guess, it would be a sobering one; Harry stares into Draco’s eyes like he’s guessed every thought behind them. Or like while Draco lives in this huge what-if, he knows what’s going to happen next. If nothing else, he at least knows what he wants to say—
“But you should know something, and I need you to believe me when I say this because I am telling the complete honest truth,” he says, left hand moving to his heart in sincerity.
She clicks her tongue, narrowing her eyes at him, and he watches her turn her attention to Draco for a minute with an intriguing softness, which disappears quickly when she looks back.
Ron makes a noncommittal noise. “Yeah, but… you’ve never really cared about that, have you? You never talk about your identity; you haven’t
“My work,” Draco manages to stammer, glancing down at the piles of carefully organised notes and papers below him. Harry looks at him unbelievably, and he expects to be dragged onto his feet towards the bedroom, but Harry just picks him back up easily.
But Harry closes his eyes. Imagines the magic coursing through his body expanding outward, into Draco. It’s such a pleasant feeling, wrapped around him like the warmth of a summer storm, that it almost sends him back to sleep all on its own.
Harry huffs as he throws the note in the bin. It’s hard not to be offended. After all, he thought he did well staying quiet and only speaking when they took a mutual break or Draco started it.
Draco nods and flips the lid. It’s a small pendant on a gold chain in the shape of a crescent, shiny as if it was boxed yesterday. The chain is delicate and thin, the crescent slender, and he spies a note folded in the padding the necklace sits on.
She hands him a jewelled crown that he’d be a fool to refuse. He places it regally on his head, lifting his chin proudly.
It’s magic, isn’t it, the fire? Not magic in the technical sense. Not in the sense with a body of research, or precious ‘
“Sure,” Draco offers. His hands drop from the buttoned centre of Harry’s shirt to sit on his knee, and with a sudden motivation, leans closer and touches his lips to Harry’s neck.
Speech done, they all danced, even the guest of honour. First in a huge circle of Weasleys-plus-Luna and Slytherins to loud band music, then slow in pairs, then, as the crowd dwindled to only the closest invitees and the hour grew late, unabashedly.
“Merlin, Harry. Okay. Yes! I’m so so sorry. The next time I think we’re ending things because we’ve verbally destroyed each other and you’ve stood silent and I’ve slammed the door, I’ll make a proclamation. We can have a post-mortem, so our next boyfriends see new improved versions of us. We can get the relationship peer-reviewed—“
see a thestral, which would prove that he’d witnessed the murder. Absolute bollocks! How are you going to disprove that he
Bitterly, it’s that exact kind of natural, silent conversation that sent a twist into his heart all over again. It acted as a reminder that they could have compassion for him, but never a complete understanding. For them, he’s happy, and for himself, in the rawness of a separation, perhaps jealous.
’ Mari had said. She wasn’t, he’d told her, but there wasn’t much she couldn’t do if she tried. Mari had looked quite excited to meet her next.
“Er…” He had to think back for a moment. His role in the case had never required him to learn the victims too closely. “Recidivism, perhaps?”
your tracing potions are busy brewing. We can go shopping, this is the perfect excuse to get a punching bag for my place! That is, assuming you don’t want to train at the gym.”
“What a name, Draco! Should I be worried to spar you? You look like a bloke not to trifle with.” Lars raises an eyebrow, and Harry grins at the flustered surprise on Draco’s face.
Draco wouldn’t know this, but the Pixies song in Harry's iPod was "Here Comes Your Man." I didn't mean for too much symbolism there, they just have about two songs you can run to. Although personally I imagine Harry’s the kind of inhuman runner who could put on spoken word poetry and not find it affect his exercise.
“I think if you give up being perfect the rest will come easy. The honesty, the opening up… But I can’t—I… I’m sure it’s easier said than done. I know you’ve had a rough go of it.”
The arm she has around his shoulders tightens, keeping him close. “Ron seems… upset, that you didn’t tell him, but he’s being a good friend today. You’ll need to talk.”
“Ah, the cousins,” Hermione says, sweeping a dark curl from her face. “I try not to think about how much less they’ll all see each other when Teddy and Victoire start us on a new round of Hogwarts students.”
She looks him up and down, fingers laced together. “Please, Mr Malfoy. You’ve left Hogwarts twice. Stayed longer than any student who didn’t become a professor. Beaten me
She grins, and Harry is filled, not for the first time, with so much pride for her successes that he’s hit with a dormant pang of sadness for the loss of their relationship. Ginny turns her gaze onto him, a quick glance up and down.
She holds out a tin without raising her eyes, and Harry feels even more dismissed. He takes two; one for Ron, who had walked quietly to his desk this morning without a usual hello to Harry.
,” she groans tiredly as stars flood Harry’s vision and turns directly into Draco’s oncoming form. He whirls forward and head-butts her without reservation. When she stumbles back, he aims a gorgeous kick at the side of her head that leaves her in a crumpled heap on the floor.
“How did you know what to look for at Flourish and Blotts?” Harry blurts, a surprise even to himself.
She lets him sit in peace. She asks him no questions and silently fields the return owls. Narcissa, once hearing that Draco was going to be okay, requests updates and only sends a basket of sweets—dark chocolates, which Draco doesn’t like. Blaise and Pansy arrive separately but within fifteen minutes of each other, and Hermione even fills in during his retelling anytime he starts to trail off.
“Essentially, the spellwork on this necklace combines a sort of locator charm, I believe an adaptation of the Homonculous Charm, strengthened by only focusing on an individual recipient, and cast with enough love that you can feel it as powerfully as you would a curse. I believe you know a thing or two about the strength of love in the use of magic.”
He growls, and lifts onto the ball of his foot, pivoting on it as he turns at the hip. The bag swings a little, sympathetically.
Draco frowns. “I… it was a great surprise to me. It’s hard to… love someone who can do that. But there will always be a connection, I suppose. As you likely know. Do you think Ginny could still fancy you?”
He folds the note in half, seals it, and steps downstairs to find Orsix perched on one of his dining table chairs grooming himself.
Ron pats his shoulder, standing and holding a hand out for Harry’s empty mug. “That’s fantastic because I told her you should take her to dinner tomorrow.”
Perhaps if the first words out of Harry’s mouth weren’t consistently inquiring on the wellbeing of others, he could stop thinking about him in the shower.
“Oh, yeah, well, of course. It’s all just banter, we know there’s nothing there. For Circe’s sake, he almost killed you in that bathroom. And his best friend was tortured in your bloody drawing room. You’re not shagging in secret.”
When he reaches Diagon Alley, his pulse is racing and his mouth is completely dry. He hasn’t felt so overcome with nerves, with the idea of someone else, since years ago with Ginny. This feeling makes Jack seem like a schoolyard crush.
. Sometimes he’s underlined, too, and Harry will sit for a minute trying to imagine why it had spoken to him especially. The most memorable was a short quote, and he didn’t need to ponder over its import. It had been underlined twice, and circled:
Out the door, he winks to Yolanda, spares another look at Murray’s dark office, then stops briefly for a deep breath outside Ron’s door. With determination and remorse, he knocks.
Between the thoughtful discretion and the very un-Blaise-like stammering, Draco’s feeling dangerously moved. “Men, for now, thanks. Not written in stone, though. But honestly, enough Potter jokes. Come up with something more original. It’s embarrassing at this point and—“ He stops as his thoughts catch up to Blaise’s speech. “Hold on, Blaise. You said a decade, but all those men were after Emilia.”
and Draco takes it off his hands with wary interest. Most of the cursed items stay tucked away, once Harry’s properly identified them, for another day.
Harry flicks his eyes to the brother, just to check that his position hasn’t changed. He’s staring Harry down hungrily, but hasn’t moved.
He stretches his arms into the cold of Harry’s side of the bed. Three days and two nights together should require a night away. He’ll get up in a minute, go get work done, sleep in his own bed
Eventually, though, Blaise catches him alone in an alcove of the dungeons staring out through a window into the lake and sits across from him before he can run. Draco spares a glance. He’s all honey-coloured eyes and deep brown skin, face washed in the same aquatic blue as Draco’s.
Harry shrugs, immediately uneasy with the serious implications. “Nothing’s going to happen, but… yes. Just between us.”
At the first sip, he recognises it and downs the rest quickly. It fills him with warmth and slows his racing heart. He finally risks meeting Harry’s eyes. Instantly, he groans in anticipation. “I don’t want to hear it.”
It’s becoming apparent that Harry’s lack of eye contact is not, as he’d imagined, rooted in anger, but embarrassment.
No, that’s Jack, clenching weight stoppers onto the ends of a barbell. He doesn’t see Harry. The punching bags are on the opposite side of the room, so Harry makes his way over, happy to put the entire gym between them. It seems Jack had been trying to avoid Harry, too, and here they’d ended up—both tactically outside their usual time.
In the confusing rush of Harry’s arrival and subsequent collapse onto his bed, it hadn’t crossed Draco’s mind to ask where he’d been. With Ron, apparently. And it had taken a seemingly tumultuous turn in the direction of discussing the Potters again. Before their friendship, he wouldn’t have expected a book to serve as an appropriate apology gift for Harry Potter, but looking at him now, nose deep in the text, he can see no alternative.
The elf offers Draco a narrow-eyed glare and a gnarled sneer, then disappears. Harry pats his shoulder. “I’d be more concerned if he didn’t say something unfailingly ignorant. C’mon, then.”
“There is no reason,” Harry grunts as he lowers himself to the ground to look under Mrs Black’s former bed, “for one family to own this much cursed stuff.”
That curious look again, Harry’s eyes searching him like he’s trying to figure him out. It makes Draco want to shrink.
He’ll be happy to come visit again. He can imagine sitting out under the large knotted tree in the main courtyard in the summer, or living in the sage and mustard panelled library. He tested out the latter fantasy often that week, taking most lunches in there and a few dinners when a section of the estate was proving to be especially tricky to ward.
“What things—oh,” Harry says, as Draco’s fingertips touch the skin of his waist. He presses his lips to the flesh just above Harry’s collar, in case he hasn’t made himself clear, but Harry sighs, “I’m listening,” and finally reaches for Draco, too.
“Good to know you’re still charming,” he replies evenly, then waves his wand to unlock the cell door. It swings open with a loud, aching squeak, and he gestures with sarcastic chivalry through the opening.
Acknowledging that they’ve both kept some things private should quiet his thoughts, but instead he has this powerful desire to leave his friends sitting there, apparate from Hogsmeade right to Draco’s door, and refuse to leave until he knows everything. Where he slept at school, if he ate with the teachers, whether it was hard to go back. And did he get nightmares like Harry, even ten years later? How does he want his eggs? Does he ever see his mother?
He’ll joke with Ron, too, about work and his haircut, and he’ll ask after Teddy and Harry will ask after Rose, and they’ll laugh about children. Hermione will keep her eye on him, and not see the smallest resemblance to the man she had tea with, because he’s been dominated by a greater force; one determined to deserve love and give it, to Draco or Ron and Hermione and Rose or Teddy.
Teddy opens his mouth but Draco shakes his head slightly at him, feeling chided like a schoolboy. Teddy ignores him and pitifully offers, “There were cushioning charms.”
Harry doesn’t write his own speeches for these charity events. Or choose his clothes. He can’t even provide the name of whoever does. Mostly, he goes where he’s told and enjoys a night with his friends after the kowtowing is over. Hermione says he needs to learn to say no, but it’s always for a good cause, impossible to decline, even if some of the speeches are more cringe-worthy than others.
Harry’s gaze flicks between Draco’s left and right eyes, then he seems to take a levelling breath and smiles. The public figure smile, perhaps with a hint of tenderness in the eyes. “Tell me about Sirius’ necklace.”
It’s mid-afternoon on a Thursday and Flitwick’s schedule hasn’t changed in half a century, so he doubts it’s changed since he’d attended in 2002. He’ll be available if Draco goes now, so he gathers his courage and confidently steps into his fireplace, green flames licking up his legs and smoke fogging his vision, finally dissipating into a view of the Headmistress behind her large mahogany desk.
He hasn’t slept well the last two nights, hardly at all, and it shows in his eyes and the rings of purple under them. There’s a dark shadow underlining his jaw that he usually remembers to shave. His hair is getting especially unruly, too. He’s been too busy to consider any routine maintenance, and with a twist of embarrassment, he sees himself fake-smiling at Hermione looking like this.
Somehow not a single complete sentence, and yet Draco completely understands. Moreover, he feels a rush of guilt swirl through his belly, knowing that Harry’s having the very prevalent straight friend paranoia of
without fucking REM sleep! I’d rather not take you as the guinea pig for what a year off looks like!”
“Er, who… did the charms?” Harry mumbles to Ron when he and Hermione find him by the head of the table.
“Piss… off…” Harry breathes, short and sharp, eyes squeezed shut. His actions tell a different story, though, holding him close, bring the heat of their bodies together, and his breath huffs close to Draco’s neck. Before long, his breathing changes entirely and he tenses against Draco, eyes lightly closed and mouth shut tight.
Right now, for instance, Harry is bubbly, raving to Pansy, “Honestly, Molly Weasley loves your show! She’s always wondering whether you screen for the best questions or if you just get lucky.”
He’s putting more weight on his arm. Doing so brings him closer to Harry. It stops him from picking a sentence thoughtfully. He stammers out, “I just have one of those faces, I guess.”
Before Harry, he made weekly trips, mostly supplemented with takeaway that would last a few days for a single person. He wonders what After Harry will feel like. Reluctantly, he stands and dresses smartly, in a hopeless attempt to look more put together than he feels, and as he does so, he looks in the mirror and gives the most sensible speech yet, audibly and evenly.
Immersion quickly proves much more successful than avoidance. Within a week he’s watched Blaise get sick over illicit gin and lose a bit of the magic, so to speak. A few weeks later he takes a Beauxbatons student out, and watching him be a classically animalistic teenage boy over some girl does the trick. By the time Adrian Pucey gives him a look over in the Quidditch locker room, he’s emboldened and doesn’t look away. By the time Pansy has taken enough hints from their potions pairings and the rumours surrounding them to ask him to the Yule Ball, he rather romantically replies, “Why not?” and means well.
Draco beckons him in, still in a dressing robe and his silk pyjamas. Their plates from last night are in the sink, and when he glances into the study, it looks like a tornado has blown through.
Draco reads it three times, his brow knitting more with each pass over—the first, for comprehension, the second in contemplation, and the third in resignation. He sighs, sitting back in the chair overcome.
Equally tense and feeding off each other’s tempers, Draco and Harry don’t need to speak a word aloud before agreeing to stalk out of the Ministry, furiously fast, and only come to a stop when Harry collapses onto an empty bench a couple blocks away.
“It’ll just be bureaucratic rubbish,” Harry adds. “If there’s a duel, I promise I’ll send a Patronus.”
“I bet your other friends are missing you,” Harry replies, nodding towards the booth he’d appeared from. He likes Seamus, truly, but he’s too sober to match this.
Ron arrives just then, calling his name and listening to his shaky shout from upstairs and his eyes widen slightly at the sight of Draco. Harry had thought he’d looked dead when he’d walked in, with his unseeingly open eyes and the pinked patch of hair where his head had hit the sink on the way down.
Draco shakes his head, lips curled up like he’s affronted by such obvious adulation, but it’s clearly superficial. Harry can’t even bring himself to challenge it—certainly this wouldn’t feel right without just a little faux-antagonism. Besides, his left hand is laying on Harry’s knee under the blanket even as he feigns revulsion.
gone to Harry’s Muggle pub to feel close to him, so technically he’d succeeded. Never in his life has he sobered up as quickly as he does now, throwing his hands up to the back of his head and pacing the hallway.
He extracts his arms, electing to make himself useful getting plates, and when Harry glances back at his leaving figure, Draco’s encouraged by the expression that meets him; one that seems to mirror his own internal distractions today. His gaze is exploratory and deep, flitting between Draco’s eyes and mouth, and his lips drift apart for a quiet moment before he stammers, “Bowls, too.”
Perhaps feeling the heat burning into the side of his head, Potter suddenly meets his eyes, smile instantly fading as if looks
flat—near Diagon Alley. He’d looked a mess; dark purple circles evident even against his dark skin, hair unwashed… It was a miracle that he’d changed clothes.
She points a finger at him, vaguely threatening. “You’ll catch flies like that. I know when a compliment is well-deserved.” He closes his mouth, not sure when he’d let his surprise show so openly. “Off you go. And get that necklace owner’s permission, young man. Whatever it takes. A gentleman never tells.”
taste like being on holiday— and he coughs into the straw, looking up with large eyes. “No, I don’t!”
“The parcel,” Harry affirms, handing it over with a curt nod. “I’ll—I’d… Just look.” He presses past into the hallway but stops just short of the study when he realises it’s not empty. Pansy Parkinson stands suddenly to face him, masking her surprise with a smile.
“One chapter left. Dinner must have been uneventful or I would’ve heard.” His hand pushes the hair out of Harry’s eyes and stays on the crown of his head, looking down at him as he talks.
Draco thinks back to how tetchy he was in the holding cell, assuming Potter was there to rub salt in the wound. How quickly he’d turned sour when Potter asked for his help. He hadn’t given the man much reason to think he’s changed.
An impressive Auror named Marinella is just beginning to update them on her largest case when the door to the conference room opens and Ron enters. The majority of them glance over and back at Marinella, but Harry notices his red face, bright eyes, and the way he can barely keep the smile off his face where he sits in an empty seat by the back wall.
“Or alternatively, the moral is ‘Don’t fall in love with another woman and let your Patronus give you up’.”
. You took me to bloody India, that’s not—“ He closes his eyes and takes a deep, settling breath through his nose. When he speaks again, it’s slower. “It’s just funny how I’ve spent these last months defending you and
He floats the cursed object carefully off his desk and up onto the filing cabinet beside it, then sticks a quill behind his ear and gives his full attention to the notes. His papers are full of scratched out or disproved attempts at the new spell. He doesn’t know what’s left to try and tries to ignore the feeling that he’s done nothing but fail this week.
Kicking is harder—there’s a natural flick like a wand that he engaged in punching that’s absent here. On top of it all, he can tell Harry’s aggravated by his inability to comprehend his verbal instructions or mirror his example.
These days, remembering moments of hands thrown up and doors shut in his face in moments when he’s pushed too far, he’ll break into a sweat trying not to let his temper go in front of them. He goes out of his way to laugh things off, for fear that their resentment for the unhappy post-war Draco will return, irreversibly.
So Draco himself, faced with Harry’s deftly chosen touches, tries to rein in his urgency and the slight disbelief in reality that has subsisted since he returned from France. It’s challenging. He acts hungrily, never having touched Harry’s skin so removed from the obstacle of clothing. He wants to do everything, touch everything, elicit every sound he can, just in case this is all a dream, or his one chance before Harry comes to his senses.
Hermione grimaces. “You’ve had a really hard day. Sorry. Table that speech, okay? Think about it later, after—“
Draco’s latest reads haven’t yet made it to the bookshelves, and he tries to read through their titles quickly from the perspective of a visitor, hoping none are too embarrassing:
At the promise of research, he can tell he’s won her over, much faster than expected. Her eyes brighten. “Oh, that’s a great idea! Did Molly’s book help?”
“Hm.” She slides her paper closer, out of Draco’s prying eyesight and writes something long. “So what are you working from?”
He listens, jerkily controlling his body enough to sit with his back against the sturdy desk. He draws his knees up, breathes slowly, rocking his body through the waves of pain. He stays this way for minutes that feel like hours, his world reduced to one body, one mind, the in and out of his inflating lungs.
It stayed propped by the fruit bowl while he threw himself into arranging the chapters that had been returned and preparing the second draft of the necklace chapter for Marta. It was still sitting there when he made breakfast this morning, and when he wiped down the counters, he’d lifted it to clean under and set it back down with impressive self-control.
haven’t been easy lately,” she says. “You were generally uneventful the past, say, seven years? You owed us some major changes. Some difficulty. That’s life.”
With the quill back behind his ear and the papers before him, Draco finally meets his eye and Harry’s breath catches. A few hairs have escaped his ears and lay across stormy eyes that flash bright with inventiveness. His mouth is tipped into an excited half-smile. Harry grins back, conspiratorially, feeling brighter with the buzz of energy between them.
Draco keeps his attention on the window, watching the giant squid dive deep in the distance. Avoiding Blaise at all costs has created an unfortunate set of circumstances in which his infatuation, rather than fading, is pent up and even less manageable when their paths do cross.
Jack nods sympathetically and throws his bag on the ground, straddling the bench to face Harry directly. “Care to talk about it?”
Harry takes a deep breath, jaw clenched, clearly not interested in the attempt at casualness that Draco’s offering. “Why’re you ignoring me?”
“Fantastic, rest is important. Every day I feel like I have to remind another Auror to get at least four hours at night.”
“Honestly,” Teddy says, attention already shifting again, tilting his head thoughtfully. “You should’ve gotten this haircut ages ago.”
This wins him a smile. Harry moves from the toilet to kneel at the side of the tub, leans in and grins—the widest smile Draco’s seen on him in two days. “I do, you know,” he says. “I ‘lo-care’ about you. I ‘lo-care’ about you much more than I expected.”
“You know,” Draco replies, taking a sip of gin, “I always wondered why you were so willing to come to my flat and bunk off Star Aurorship, but I would take half days and curate a booze drawer if I had to look at shit like this all day, too.”
He washes the bite down with his drink, clearly enjoying the suspense, then leans back in his chair and announces, “Harry shagged someone.”
The Christmas after he and Ginny broke up, the dark pit that had been waning in his stomach inched back open, leaving him doubtful of his place at the Burrow and in the family. He finally, softly, offered to bow out for a while, with gathered nerve during dinner one night, a week before Christmas. Ron made it a nonissue.
Harry smiles graciously but remains quiet as they enter Spoonfuls, busy persuading himself that the chances of seeing Draco are slim to none. Sure, he lives upstairs, and if it was absolutely silent in the café he might convince himself that he can hear his footsteps pacing the study somewhere above his head, but Harry’s the one who more often made runs downstairs for food. Draco hardly sets foot in the café now that he’s had someone to do his bidding.
She sighs, lips pursed, as though giving in, more than ready to return to the easy companionship that had been blossoming. “It’s strange,” she tries one more time, to be sure. “That you could hate him so much and now like him like this.”
His eyes widen. “I’m not going in, I’m staying here. I’ll work from the room, and-and if I need something, maybe Cassie—“
“I’m kidding, of course, Harry, you’re a natural Auror. I’m not sure any of us could have pictured you doing anything else,” Neville adds.
“Well we’re even I guess,” he sighs. Then, because he can’t help himself, “Does Emilia still fancy you? Could you tell, at her lab?”
with her that I think—it blinded me to what I would be feeling if I didn’t have her? If that makes sense.”
Yesterday, when the pages arrived for most of the book, he hadn’t imagined productivity as an option. But that morning, really examining himself in the aftermath of leaving Harry, he realised that he’d done a terrible job of setting priorities.
“I told you to tell me if you could handle me, and you said nothing!” Draco argues, taking his turn to look shocked beyond comprehension. “I walked out! That’s splitting up!”
Draco shakes his head, sipping his beer, happy for the calming buzz that’s starting to land. The Juliya debate has been ongoing for weeks. No one had asked him to take a side yet, which was delightful.
“My name and Cassie’s are circled at the bottom of your notes,” he says matter-of-factly. “Because my name was on the parcel?”
“Too slow, Ron,” Blaise says, standing and moving around the table to squeeze in next to Harry. “You’ve just lost out on some Pansy points.”
“Maybe someone was seen in the mailroom. Or thought they’d be seen in the mailroom—things were busier than expected, or what have you—and added the Cassie curse last minute as a distraction. A failsafe.” He regards Draco with wide green eyes, looking as though he’s thinking thirty thoughts at once. “This stays in this flat,” he says.
He opens his eyes, forgetting that he’d closed them to feel for the skull, and blinks in shock to make eye contact immediately. Harry is staring at him with an amusing intensity, as if he’s trying to look right through him. It’s incredibly disconcerting.
“With the office team. Seems genuinely dumbfounded, if not completely humiliated. He’s already talking of resigning before he can be discharged.”
Applause from behind Harry signals that Kingsley Shacklebolt has walked on stage, ready to introduce him, and he stiffens a bit. His heartbeat rings loudly, and he’s distracted only momentarily by Professor McGonagall’s friendly touch of his shoulder as she moves past to find her seat.
Now, it’s likely been almost twenty-four hours since it arrived, and it’s getting harder to ignore. He tells himself that he’s waiting to decipher his own emotions before he invites others, that surely Hermione’s letter is personal, not professional.
“I’m not telling you to quit,” Ron says. “But the entire wizarding world expected Aurorship from you. So if no one else is going to tell you it’s okay not to be one, I think I want to.”
He tears himself away, paranoid of being found with his hand on his own books and perceived as vain, passes Harry cross-legged on the floor in the Muggle Studies section, flipping seriously through a book, before stopping in the stationery section. It seems as good a time as any to do his own shopping, the few people that there are to consider, and a beautiful set of quills catches his eye. They’re swan feathered, with a glossy silver ink bottle and a small matching quill knife for sharpening the tip. Blaise would love them.
. And it’s more like shortbread, anyway. You’ll take back that foot-dragging when it’s in your mouth.”
, give you a chance to miss me and get this damn book done. We are exclusive, we’re keeping this between us until we’ve got a handle on it, we know to take a walk if we start getting too cross.”
He rolls his eyes. “This is why you should never have gotten the family home. My family home?” he emphasises, hoping it’ll clue him in.
He’d included Muggle maths in a spark of inspiration. For a month he did nothing but study logarithms. He nods.
He sits contemplatively for a moment, then gingerly raises Draco’s hand by the wrist. He guides it to the script on his left hand,
Harry just shrugs, eyes already glued back to the list he’s taken from his back pocket. Then, with a plan and determination and no waiting, he’s out the door, Draco quick on his heels.
“RON!” he shouts immediately. “HERMIONE!” The tone of his voice chills him, so he’s not surprised when Ron looks incredibly unnerved once he appears.
“Weird bloody poetry,” Harry muttered. With a Seeker’s agility, he swung the rolling pin at Draco’s hand, which had reached once again for the chocolate. “If you eat it all, these won’t be pains au chocolat, just… pains.”
in the process, and turned in early if Blaise joined them in the common room. It’s exhausting, but saves him from confronting the issue for a month.
Harry knows what he meant before he even asks for clarification, a small voice in the back of his mind saying
“Or not,” Ron winks. Harry, an almost-Slytherin himself, is beginning to shift on his feet a little. “That house only breeds bad—“
“DRACO MALFOY. THIS IS THE AUROR DEPARTMENT, WITH A WARRANT TO ENTER ON SUSPICION OF INVOLVEMENT IN SERIAL CURSES.”
Harry looks up at him. “His head should be elevated, he’s—there’s bleeding.” Even as he speaks, Hermione resituates herself to take Draco’s head, even as he begins to brace his arms as if he’s going to sit up himself. “Lay down, Draco. It’s just Hermione,” Harry instructs firmly, then takes Ron’s extended hand.
He rejoins Potter quickly, worried that he’s been snooping around too much, but he just finds him transfixed by the bubbling brew. Draco is pleased to see it has darkened considerably.
Together, they stroll the high street, Harry slowly crossing names off his paper, circling a couple for reasons unknown to Draco, who even got up the nerve to suggest a detour to a small furniture shop where he picked out a small runner rug that he hopes will match whatever Narcissa’s decorator was providing for her home. Harry, after purchasing a large telescope for Luna, finally breaks down and levitates his bags behind them. If he doesn’t look over at Harry’s haul, Draco feels pretty accomplished himself, having also picked up a cashmere scarf for Pansy along the way.
As he locks the door to his office, he finds it impossible not to begin obsessing immediately about what he’ll say to Draco over post tomorrow.
.” He leans against the wall, voice tinted with irritation as if he’s explaining this for the twentieth time.
Harry stands, immediately circling the desk to engulf Ron in a tight hug, running through a series of “Amazing!” and “Unparalleled!” and “You lot!” They’re grinning like idiots, like kids, clasping each other firmly.
Harry dog-ears the page and closes the book solemnly. His hand runs through his hair, and he tilts his head up tiredly with his eyes closed. “Look, do you want me to go?” he asks into another sigh, eyes still shut.
Harry’s eyebrows raise, with an entertained snort. “He was so pissed off when you got here. What did you say?”
Blaise makes a face, one that implies Draco’s being dramatic, which he is. “Can you cool off, Malfoy? Your energy is unmatchably intense.”
But mostly it was thinking about Harry’s declaration carrying across his home, voice pained and broken and calling, “Good people don’t walk away.” He tucks the book away on his desk and turns back to that same man.
He sits next to Draco, who rolls his eyes when Harry shakes the bed trying to shift close enough for their shoulders and legs to touch, but he drinks his coffee without a word and might move in an inch himself. They eat in comfortable silence, feeding off each other’s heat under the blanket, watching Dante claw at the edge of the curtains from the chaise with his rambunctious morning energy.
Harry smiles into the next kiss, and his hands leave Draco to find purchase under the back of his legs. Within a moment he’s lifted off the ground. It’s a strange experience, as a full-grown adult. Harry gives only a light huff, making him feel weightless, and he hooks his arms around Harry’s neck, his ankles behind his back. For a moment he really is at a loss for words.
When it opens, his eyesight is flooded immediately with the bright red and orange of Gryffindor memorabilia, the posters of Muggle motorbikes and women, all of which sends a twinge of affection and loss through him. It reminds him of his last night here, years ago, and he knows he’s not putting full effort in as he sweeps the room.
He hitches a breath and jerks back, shrinking towards the wall out of sight even though he’s clearly been made. He’d watched the millisecond where Draco’s face swivelled to follow Lucrezia’s line of sight, eyes wide.
Harry chuckles. “Didn’t know your self-esteem was low enough to waste time wondering why I came over.” He walks to one of the armchairs and drags it from the window to his desk, propping his feet on the desk’s edge.
The next hour is spent contently. They keep an eye on the game (England was closing the gap) while catching up on each other’s jobs, lives, and old wizarding family gossip. The web of intermarried pureblood families made for complex drama. Blaise, of course, is usually a bit tight-lipped—a Venn diagram of old pureblood families and his clientele was often a circle—but this always inspires Pansy to declare her hypotheses and watch his face for any tells.
He does, as far from Draco as possible. “You’re… er, feeling well, then?” he says as an afterthought of politeness.
Try to feel for the curser’s trace if you can, see if the evidence hasn’t been transported to this mystery specialist yet. Whatever you can get.”
When he speaks again it’s distant, his thoughts thoroughly elsewhere. “If Lars is leaving, we can just spar and you’ll get a feel for the ring.”
“Mum couldn’t think of any relation. I couldn’t either. But it seems likely, doesn’t it? That it’s a pattern? Or am I being narcissistic?”
There’s a body in his study. Harry’s body. On the floor by the filing cabinets, curled into the fetal position, though his muscles twitched like he was fighting it. Half a beat later, he sees the cursed skull clutched strongly in his hand. The man gasps like a fish out of water, eyes screwed shut.
How is he going to continue the case professionally, now, no matter how he proceeds personally? Maybe Draco will be capable of considering it a single embarrassing moment and moving on, but Harry can’t make it an hour without daydreaming again. It would have been easier on his psyche if he’d never kissed him at all.
Harry laughs as he gestures for the barman, but his breath hitches and his smile falls abruptly when he makes eye contact across the room. Draco Malfoy, of all people, is shooting him daggers, hand wrapped so tightly around his drink that he swears he can see his white knuckles from where he stands.
He’s never accepted an event invitation as fast as this one, especially when it came directly on McGonagall’s stationery. In retrospect, he wished he’d seen a Mind Healer after the war instead of relying on Dreamless Sleep to a dangerous degree. Now the nightmares are just few and far enough between that it to go to one feels like overkill. But if it helps other alumni changed by the war, he’d certainly give the speech a hundred times over.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” he’d said, taking another bite of his lasagna. Strangely, Ron eating through the conversation comforted Harry— it wasn’t a concern worth putting a fork down. “Mum would go spare. Pass the bread?”
Failing to sufficiently vocalise what’s racing through his head, Harry says, “You look good” as he pulls on his own jacket. Draco rubs his neck and looks away. Neither remembers in the briefly distracting interaction that he had asked Harry a question.
Harry spends the next day teetering between contentedness and confusion, depending on which minute of their study session he chooses to reflect upon. He doesn’t owl to see when they’ll work together again, like a teenager testing their beau’s attentiveness, and is glad he’d refrained when a familiar eagle owl comes to him that afternoon with a short note:
When she’s gone, Harry throws his arms over his eyes and finally lets out a slow sigh in his solitude. He stays there, no clue how long, until Hermione returns, and then he peeks towards her under his arms. She has a red envelope in her hand and stoops back to the bottom shelves for one of the thin books from before.
Draco leans up and kisses him hard, to prove his point or quiet him. He tugs at Harry’s shirt, shifts his weight around when Harry pulls at his, stiffens further at the moan Harry lets out when their bare skin finally touches.
Draco huffs, pokes Harry’s side. “It’s a bloody good poem, and you should show it some respect. It made me want to try again.”
He floated Draco’s parchment back to his desk. “You see, you haven’t even ‘failed’, you just need to extend the spell.”
Harry’s fuming. His leg taps incessantly below the desk. This may truly be the most emotionally confusing week of his life. “I will… convey the information,” he bites out.
The very idea of it enraptures him. He imagines the sea of heads like at a Weasley reunion, but instead of gingers, a sea of dark hair like his own, the skin of his father, the faces of his grandparents. He refuses three times that Pratik offers him the painting and accepts on the fourth. When Draco motions to put it in their shopping bag, he instead holds it safely close to his chest.
Harry has a habit of putting too much force into his magic. He treats it like a battle of force rather than one of skill. He has both, undoubtedly, and if he could learn to steady the two, he’d be unstoppable. It’s something he’s thought before, considered even while at Hogwarts, and now Draco tells him this, sucking in a breath of surprise when Harry’s eyes snap open and fix on him instantly.
“My wall is ‘busy’ on purpose,” he mentions when the silence drags a little long. “It’s a gallery wall. Per Hermione’s suggestion. Organised chaos.”
Harry blinked in surprise. Then thought about it. “Oh, actually, yes. The west entrance is just there.” He gestured a block down.
Ron stands to let him pass, and Harry walks unhurriedly to the bar. He orders a double and folds the edge of the paper napkin placed before him. There’s a raucous bout of laughter from the table he’d left behind. It urges him to tap the edge of his quickly-emptied glass, sending for another. In the interim, he tears the napkin in half glumly and when the pieces fall back to the bar top, his eyes light suddenly, remembering a charm he used to pull out when he and Ginny were being particularly stubborn about something.
“I’ve been up for three hours,” Draco says immediately when Harry stumbles into the living room the next morning, eyes still squinted with sleep. There’s coffee brewed and dirty dishes and he’s bent over pages at the large table again.
“I feel completely fine.” It’s true. Tracing feels as easy as breathing. “Sirius’ room,” he decides quickly.
“I left the paperwork on Lucrezia’s desk weeks ago, never heard about it again so I assume she passed it on to him or approved it herself,” Harry says. “Don’t see why it would be a problem. The only other threat to public wellbeing at that banquet besides the cursed objects was my speech.”
“Two-year-olds don’t exactly have a command of your award-winning sense of humour, Ronald,” she sighs.
Ron stays decidedly quiet and Harry watches them for a moment through the cutout window above the sink, coming to terms with the fact that he’ll soon go home to his empty flat where his thoughts will be unfailingly consumed with the mystery of a new case. He throws the wet flannel he’d wiped the kitchen down with on the edge of the sink to dry as Ron speaks up with the prescience of someone who’s read his mind.
He thinks of every other prejudice he’s witnessed Malfoy embracing and exhales through his nose with embarrassment for being so naively hopeful. Yes, he grew up in what Harry would call a disturbingly traditional wizarding family. But there’d been an ounce of hope in him that the cold receiving end of prejudice Malfoy had experienced in England these days would have expanded a bit of empathy in his heart for other biases.
“She didn’t include a note, if that’s what you’re looking for,” he offers. “Just a page in an envelope. Wanted me to do all my own thinking, I suppose.”
It’s the pictures that finally draw him further in. An entire wall by the fireplace covered in photos, eclectically framed. His parents, laughing happily. One of Weasley and Granger, her in a long white dress. Potter in a suit at the same wedding, holding Granger’s waist as they dance and smile at the camera. Potter and a little boy with bright hair. Another of him and the boy, a bit older, on brooms. There’s another of Granger and Weasley, too, this time with Potter in the middle holding a newborn.
They go back to Draco’s. It’s amazing that hours ago he was asleep in that bed, but he prefers it in his present circumstances, sleep-deprived but strangely resolved, and not alone. He starts the shower, and as the steam rises, he gently lifts the hem of Draco’s t-shirt and tosses the stained clothing to the floor. Without speaking, he takes stock of his body; the black eye is gone and the cuts, which are already half-healed, will reportedly be gone within a day.
“Auror Potter, we are not wasting manpower on your case right now.” Murray seems to only speak when he can rebuff him, Harry thinks. “There’s nothing we can do besides research and evidence work until there’s another curse.”
“Unlikely.” He knocks his foot against Draco’s, trying to win his attention. Slowly, with a dramatic sigh, Draco turns his gaze to his friend. “Kneazle got your tongue? C’mon, mate.”
I should say sooner than later; I stand by my statement that no homophobia or transphobia exists in my universe, but does that stop these delightfully self-destructive characters from seeing some arrogance where there isn’t any? Of course not.
“Right, yes. I’m sure it’s unsurprising that I’ve been racking my brain trying to decipher exactly what curse I succumbed to—the spell Hermione used from the diagnostic book was brilliant, and it was for all plant-based poison curses, so that was a start. Did she tell you how clever she was? She had to independently recognise that only organic matter presents itself through the veins, then parse through the organic material diagnostic chapter and decide plant-based would have infused an object best at the speed it was travelling through me.”
He hesitates. He can’t put into words what came over him to think of Potter first when he escaped the journalists, but it had proved enjoyable, and so he listens again as it tugs on his tongue.
“Hm,” Ron hums. He thinks for a moment. “I appreciated the apology, honestly. We could tell it was genuine, that he’s different. But you can be remorseful without changing your attitude. You can be rehabilitated and still be a prat. So what… I guess help me see. Hermione says she sees.”
He shrugs. “I’ve always found it peaceful, I suppose. I think better, in nature. On holiday, the grounds of the estate... But my mastery summers at Hogwarts solidified it, I’m sure. I used to sit by the Great Lake for
Draco thinks first of having to stand shirtless beside Harry, the soft pale skin of his belly next to Harry’s, so tanned and defined. Then he thinks of the puffy snake and skull on his forearm, gut twisting.
!” he roars, heart still thumping agitatedly from the nightmare, sweeping the book off the floor and into the fire. When had he lit the fire? The paper edges curl and the fabric cover blackens.
For a while, he works in silence, then with the radio on, then eventually, while snacking on something from Harry’s fridge, he thumbs through his DVDs and puts on a movie. He spares a moment to acknowledge that Harry was right about young Tom Cruise, then continues to split his attention between the telly and the papers until the fireplace flickers to life.
“You absolute wanker,” he says, rolling his arms forward to look at the speckles of dampness along his back.
marry in this dream? Some tall blonde Veela that’s made all the parents jealous?” he asks, wiggling his eyebrows.
“Sure, yes,” he concedes, gearing up for his speech. This is the moment. Pretend Harry is just Dante listening on the reading chair, like before. “Harry, I—“
before he can stop himself. Potter looks cross so he adds,before he can open his mouth, “I was surprised. That you asked me here.”
“Hm,” Harry hums. “Well… I don’t—I swear, if he comes back and is angry that I’m not here, when I was here—“
Hung in a fittingly old frame he’d found at a charity shop is the Potter family photo, beside it a triptych-looking frame with three photos from India; Harry and Pratik at the Potter store counter, Harry and Draco smiling stiffly in the store’s façade, and in the centre a picture of just Draco in the rowboat, his linen sleeves rolled to the elbow, hair blowing slightly in the occasional breeze, and face in profile staring beautifully and stoically out to the water. When he’d come home from their fight, heart still beating and body tense, he’d stood in front of it and pictured the quiet rowing in India until he felt the fight leave his body.
The evidence box has gone, too, likely filed away for safekeeping. Thank Merlin for the weekend. He’ll pick it up on Monday, after he sleeps for a year.
“With your mere presence,” Draco goads. Blaise offers a rude gesture. “Er, it didn’t work this time, however. Unfortunately. It just… got worse.”
“I’ll never get used to seeing you looking this athletic,” she says, taking the offered glass that he pours.
Draco knows what disappointment looks like on Narcissa’s face, so he recognises it when the millimetre quirked tips of a smile fall. She’d written weeks ago to visit, he recalls. Before the mess of the Hogwarts banquet, or working for—
Jack wasn’t inside. Harry wondered if he’d been working just as hard to avoid him. The apologetic messages he’d sent had gone mostly unanswered, and, remembering the strange, crestfallen look on his face when Harry rejected him, purposeful avoidance seemed likely.
“THIS IS A MATTER OF MORAL CODE. TO CALL MY CLIENT IMPULSIVE AND CAPRICIOUS IS TO BE BLIND TO REALITY. HE HAS BEEN
Less time than he expected, once Teddy spots them from a bench overlooking the front walk. His hair is half green and half red and he sprints excitedly towards them, arms outstretched. Harry drops Draco’s hand and kneels, holding his arms wide to catch Teddy in a tight hug.
And still another part of him questions whether the tensions that had led to such a fight ran deeper—that it was less about the unhealthy amount of time they’d begun spending together without opening up any deeper to compensate. He thinks, sadly, as he steps under the water, that it might just be proof that they’re not as good for each other as the best-case scenario had got him thinking. If it was fate that brought them back together, how was he to question the fate that’s knocked them back out of alignment?
“I just… want to be careful with us. I want to work on this case with you, but without us going mad.”
“Did you see anything? From where you were? It looked dreadful.” Harry tries not to picture the state of Agnes’ skin alongside the taxonomy of ‘skin stretching’.
She turns away from Neville to answer, and Harry realises with a twinge of embarrassment that everyone had moved on from the Draco comment but him. He’d interrupted the middle of an entirely new conversation.
He ignores the hint of sadness laced into her voice, trying not to read it as pity because he doesn’t feel pitiful; he’s also a bit sad that he’s not interested. They’re right, Jack’s a catch. And because he agrees with them but still rejects Jack every time he replays that morning in his head, he decides to just have a go at honesty.
When they find Andromeda she wraps him in his third hug of the day and asks after his mother with genuine interest. They’d spent Christmas Eve together, he explains, leaving out the bit about her visiting Lucius on Christmas Day. His mother hadn’t seemed to understand why he would choose the Burrow and Harry’s family over such a thrilling trip—even when his most recent brush with death had been a result of his father’s actions.
Curses, he thought, were interesting. One still haunted him. For Draco, like the other Death Eaters, receiving the mark was a monumental moment. Unlike them, it wasn’t a proud one. His feet had moved towards his father’s study like lead that day, knowing he wasn’t the man waiting for him behind those doors. It felt filthy. Wrong. He’d heard once about how those who jump to their deaths and survive regret it in the split second they step off. He thought it must not be unlike this. Voldemort’s hooked wand pressed into his wrist.
is shock and not disappointment, paired with wide, serious eyes. “We’re going to Tamil Nadu,” he repeats.
He thinks of Draco, almost involuntarily. The especially bright smile reserved for him behind closed doors, his long-limbed form stretched across the bed and his messy, slack-jawed expression of sleep.
Rose is already down, Ron setting the table, Hermione in the kitchen when he arrives. It takes him approximately ten seconds to notice he’s in trouble. He can feel it in the quietness with which they move about.
Malfoy’s hands tighten into fists, practically warming the room with the heat of his anger. “I’m in enough trouble as it is, Potter. I’d thought you’d be man enough by now not to come all this way to do a happy dance in front of my
The jumper, too, is a matter of contention, but he finds one folded back in a drawer that he’s opened painfully quietly. One that looks especially unloved and unworn and therefore unmissed, black and scratchy, and he pulls it on.
“Only—well, I thought we could get takeaway from that Thai place you love and go back to mine. If—er, well, so long as you don’t have plans.”
The game is growing close—it’s only been in play for twenty minutes or so—and they make light conversation while mostly keeping their eye on the diorama. At one point, England’s chaser dives quickly down towards a dropping Quaffle and throws it towards the goal with a forceful upward toss behind her back. It puts them momentarily in the lead and the pub explodes.
“My love…” She reaches a palm out for his across the table and sandwiches it between her own manicured hands. “Hear my words when I say: this is not a call for you to add
They fall back into focused silence and trade several pieces. Draco bites his lip in deep concentration—he’ll have to confide in Harry that Ron’s some of the best competition he’s ever had, because he certainly won’t be telling his opponent directly.
A long time ago, he’d be comfortable taking some Dreamless Sleep potion and calling it a night, but it’s been years since he resorted to such measures. Sometimes a voice in his ear reminds him that he’s been completely weened since his most habitual use, so what’s the harm? He worries, though, that if he gets another taste of the irresistibly peaceful sleep it offers, he’ll latch on. Then he’s one step closer to Hermione and Ginny lecturing him into quitting again.
Harry frowns in sympathy. Thinking of Cassie will consistently fill him with guilt for feeling no closer to solving the case. He’s plateaued, and at the expense of her retribution.
“It’s only five, I was wondering if you’d tag along for a haircut?” he asks, before immediately growing nervous at the extent to which Teddy’s face alights.
. It means he knows how to get what he needs for himself or his friends and family by being really smart about it. Does that sound like him?”
Harry looks sceptical of this. Draco understands. It feels certifiable to walk away right now. Blaise would be incensed to hear such a thing. He briefly wonders if leaving will kill the momentum. Let Harry rethink and regret. But he really does have a Portkey leaving in under half an hour, and his mother is daunting.
“Alright, yeah,” Harry narrows his eyes as he nods, Draco seeming to confirm something with his swing. “You’re twisting your hips, but it needs to be lightyears faster than what you think. Like a snap.”
Her eyebrows raise but she asks no questions. “Before you go,” she says instead, reaching under her desk. She piles papers in front of him with each phrase: “Junior Auror performance reports. Obliviation review requests. And a memo from Murray.”
It’s hard not to smile, and despite his best efforts, he can’t hide a smirk when Hermione plunges her hands into her hair with exasperation.
In the centre of the room are two dark wood desks pushed into an ‘L’ for added workspace. On top, a cauldron, some dry ingredients, a mess of papers, quills, and a few cursed objects at varying levels of neutralisation.
Mari leans closer still, meeting Harry’s eyes with a solemn comradery, and when she speaks it’s a quiet mutter. “If you need me, on call or off, on the record or off, just say the word.”
Seeing a trace of his first home in the usually bureaucratic, clinical hall fills Harry with enough warmth and courage to reconsider joining in the socialising. Taking in all the familiar albeit matured faces, he supposes he might need less bravery than he’d anticipated. There is something comfortably less intimidating about most of the guests having already seen him go through the awkwardness of puberty.
“Budge in,” he says, crowding into place beside Harry. He nudges his shoulder as he does, an attempt to divert his friend’s melancholy, so Harry complies with a quick smile, shifting over and thanking Ron for the drink. They’ve only sat long enough to make light conversation when they’re interrupted.
The last thing he wants to do this morning is walk into the Ministry. At the beginning of a case, everyone stops by his office and asks him questions about what his first steps are or what his running idea is, as if he ended the war through the same channels of bureaucracy he works with now, and he’ll say ‘It was all over for Voldemort the second Nagini signed that affidavit, so I think I’ll start with witness reports’.
"Your masculine fragility is award-winning," Draco says, narrowing his eyes. He pulls the umbrella out of the cocktail, flicking it at Ron as he sits next to Harry. “And your loss. This drink tastes like going on holiday in the Maldives.”
but I don’t want you to overexert. So I’ll do it. You’re not leaving my sight today if I can help it. I’ll trace and cook and—“
“Don’t think I don’t know you’re pushing me out the door,” he says with a suspicious glare. “And I will remind you, as your most beloved friend, that I am a lawyer, and I
“I was coming to see what was taking you so long,” Harry says, stepping into the doorway. “Apparently, having fun without me.”
His ears prick up imperceptibly, instinctually, like when he’d duck moments before a Bludger would sail a hair’s breadth from his head. Only a momentary hitch in his breathing could indicate that he’d heard the sweep of a foot behind him, and he feigns unaware just long enough to bend at the waist, swinging like a pendulum, and duck out of a lunging attack from behind. He catches his adversary directly in the temple with his fist.
“Er, well, I’m not sure. Sirius isn’t… the recipient is not here to receive the alert… I know there was one, but not what it was. Regardless, this is bloody brilliant spellwork. Incredibly advanced. The caster was extremely skilled, I’d love to know what Flitwick would make of him—hell, I’d kill to learn from him.”
He braves the outdoors, heading away from the high street lest he sees anyone he knows, and has a quick lunch outside a small sandwich shop. By the time he’s finishing up, warmed by a stream of rising sunlight, he feels like he’s found himself again, as though these strange months with Harry had been an uncharacteristic departure.
Something was intriguing about both the Malfoys he’d met; the man who patiently reschedules to fit Harry’s needs, and the man who can match Harry’s animosity with exacting insults.
smart, the way he thinks and his work ethic… He’d learn anything you threw at him. Just… thoughtful and kind and smart and everything I never thought he was.”
Hermione, for one, is shocked to see him on her stoop. She opens the door with the forehead-wrinkling confusion of someone not expecting company and Harry meets that gaze looking properly apologetic.
This is when, despite his strong constitution, Harry’s mind would fail him. They wrestle hard; two competitive men, starting with steady eye contact and locked arms on each other’s shoulders, heads lowered, but it always devolves quickly—heads tucked under arms, torsos curved over shoulders and dropped to the ground, legs straddling hips, hands pinning down wrists, half-arsed punches that aren’t meant to hit forcefully.
He glances back down towards the ground, remembering that he was partially childminding, to see Teddy wobbling unsteadily in the same position as him, leaning back on his broom and trying to put his hands casually behind his head too, but mostly flailing them for balance.
“Promise me you’ll find a better phrase before edits. You wouldn’t be my first client with terminology invention regret,” says the woman holding all of Draco’s research. Her hair is cropped short, all business, as is the long, slim cigarette in her hand. Draco smiles. He’s always loved her for her emotionless critique.
He plays the radio next, charming it to follow him room to room as he dresses, then tosses the sheets into the washing machine, opens windows and drags a bin through the kitchen to clean out the fridge. It’s a warm day, for late October, and through the open windows he can hear cars and people and pigeons and life, and when his sheets are hanging to dry he stares at the yardage of white and remembers, for the first time in months, the importance of caring for himself, too, the way he hopes Draco is taking care of himself right now.
Harry’s next words freeze him in place. “Well, that’s an afternoon less of setup, then. Get changed!”
“He can’t do that! The number of case laws that have proved even suggesting that to a subordinate isn’t legal…” She leans her head into her hands for a moment and mutters repetitively, “Not my case, not my case…”
His flat is dark, empty despite Dante’s presence. He cleans up the two plates from breakfast and the two mugs, the last hint that it was temporarily occupied by more than an individual. Dante purrs, winding through his legs, sensing his melancholy.
Draco nods without looking at him and brushes through his hair, his left hand smoothing the path his comb traces with his right. Harry stretches his neck one way, the other, then stands with a yawn, extending his arms tall over his head. He crosses the couple feet between his bed and Draco’s and sits next to where his friend stands by the foot of it, forcing a mutual gaze.
. It was terrible. We just saw each other across the way, you with your wife, me with mine, making eyes like all was well. Like… there wasn’t something between us that would die unacknowledged.”
“Mrs Malfoy, you know, I spoke to your decorator when planning the décor for tonight’s event,” Pansy said then, bubbly and smiley. “He spoke highly of your eye for design.” He could’ve kissed her.
Harry abandons him immediately, not even sitting before he travels to the bar to order. He didn’t ask what Draco wanted. He’s still fidgeting with a comfortable way to hook his feet into the middle rungs that doesn’t feel ridiculous, wondering distantly if the reporters had left his door yet, when a beer is placed in front of him.
Harry stares into the fridge. There are enough raw ingredients to whip something up, if he could find the resourcefulness to imagine what. His eyes trace the shelves without focusing, and for longer than he thinks because when Draco speaks again it’s still laced with concern.
Draco shakes his head vaguely at the dialogue, quill skating over the draft notes Marta’s returned to him; her final set. They came with a pushy reminder that she expects a preface out of him, which he’d set out of sight immediately. He’s never been in less of a mood for writing creatively and honestly.
“Yes, I’ve got everything I need,” he says, a hand running through the other man’s hair. It’s gotten long again, and he’s been trying to find a way to say he’d loved it short just as much. “Now who’s worried.”
“After lunch. Which I will make while you change—I’m just assuming you’ll take five times as long as me. When
Harry’s eyes snap up, wide and careful, and he speaks quickly. “I’m so sorry, I don’t know what happened, I didn’t say anything dodgy. I didn’t give him any reason to fire you.”
“I don’t usually describe wars to people who were in them,” Harry mutters, straightening his tie, wondering if his dress robes always made him feel this stiff, if his collar always felt so tight that it might choke him. “It’s going to be more people from school than we’ve seen in—“
well, but it won’t be if you don’t stop picturing me standing all bothered making eyes at you beside
“He’s such a bloody prat. We were seventeen, we’re all… what, twenty-six, twenty-seven now, and he’s back to acting like we’re
Harry tilts his head back to let it happen, but keeps talking with his gaze towards the ceiling. “This
“No,” he confesses. “I wasn’t that drunk, and I was thinking… a lot of things. But I don’t want to ruin our friendship. We worked so hard to get to what we have, I think, and I shouldn’t have jeopardised that. I mean, I get to have you as a friend and then I just press my luck, as if—“
“Is this because of the World Cup?” he asks. “Because when my mum heard what was going to happen with the Muggles after… I wasn’t allowed to go. But I wasn’t supposed to mention why, either. I didn’t mean to abandon you two.”
“Do you want to be his friend?” asks Hermione, and though her tone is mild, there is a weighty history behind the question. The Malfoy family has been crueller to her than imaginable; with words, with Unspeakables...
you, Harry. I’ve got all this prep work this week. I need to study the team, meet the rest of security, learn the first three game stadiums and prepare plans for arrival and departure… and I owe Gin for the job but can’t even take her out in thanks. And I’m already abandoning
“You hate him for decades, and now you just… what, change your mind? Just in time to wiggle into his psyche and his work and his friendships? I remember school.”
He’d made it to Harry’s street, but couldn’t stop. He felt himself pulled past the door and down the street on a walk he’d made once before, to The Four Johns. If he didn’t have the guts to see Harry, he might as well try to connect with him just as Harry had described in the Mughal Gardens. Look through his eyes.
The main building housed twelve bedrooms, multiple sitting rooms, two kitchens, and more bathrooms than Draco could count. House elves bustled around him, piecing it together with new furniture and memorable items from England per his mother’s direction, leaving obediently when he requested a room to himself for some casting. Altogether, it had the expansiveness of Malfoy Manor that Narcissa was familiar with sans the dark history.
Harry touches his cheek, kisses him quickly, and returns to the fireplace. “My friend is actually Draco…” he hears as his head disappears again.
He holds out an arm, and Draco’s eyes only linger for a moment, just long enough for Harry to read hesitation and worry he’s said or done too much. But then his hand is wrapped in the crook of Harry’s elbow and with a twist, they’re gone.
Harry can’t think of a single thing worthy of response to such a kind statement. He busies himself with finishing the last bites of dinner, then catches Ginny’s eye.
“Yes, er… just an argument. About incompatibility, you know, we’re so different so being… colleagues is hard.”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t realise I’d—Does it hurt? It looks like it hurts. I’ll try not to touch it or—“
he thinks, looking past Seamus to the girls who’d finally turned back to their group. It’s an exciting change of pace.
He does, and watches Draco employ a translator spell and walk off while Harry pays. He can’t take his eyes off him—especially vulnerable in the gratefulness he’s been feeling all day—the way his hands sit in the pockets of his airy camel-toned trousers and the pant legs swish while he walks away. He’s in a white cotton tee and an open button-up black shirt with the sleeves rolled once or twice for the twenty-five-degree weather. Harry had never seen him so strikingly casual in his daywear, and it had taken him a moment to gather his thoughts when he’d arrived this morning.
“Almost there,” Harry says soon after with a backwards glance, proving he hasn’t forgotten Draco between interactions. “And no press, see? I—Oh, hello, nice to meet you!”
He twists the window latch and props it open. Orsix hops through with a resounding hoot, dropping the note onto the desk by the windowsill. Harry’s pulse quickens ridiculously considering he hasn’t even confirmed it’s a response from Malfoy. He feels it is in his gut though, and pulls his jeans up quickly, flicking the wet hair out of his eye with a flip of his head as he tears through the letter’s seal.
Harry pulls a face. Hermione chuckles and Ron grants them a tight humouring smile, too, but Draco doesn’t catch the quick look between them that Harry does. It raises his stress level higher.
He hadn’t known about their daughter, either. He’ll have to scold Harry later for his terrible briefing skills. He twists on the couch to look around. “Which one is Victoire?”
Draco’s always been a little relieved that Harry had either never read his work or never mentioned it. He thought it might kill the magic of their study nights.
The Hogwarts alumni in attendance he either saw regularly enough or had no desire to, and the Ministry attendees were generally the kinds of guests who would stand and stare wide-eyed as Harry talked, paranoid of offending him with their own conversational input. It was often painful.
“H-hello, and thank you for joining us tonight,” Potter stutters. Strong start, then. “Ten years ago, I began my journey to defeat the very… personification of evil and restore peace to the wizarding world.”
There’s no missing the fact that he’s too distracted to work—not once he reads the same paragraph three times and then buggers up his arithmancy so badly that instead of voiding the skull of Cruciatus curse, it sneezes—so he turns in early. The pillows smell dangerously like Harry’s shampoo, and when he falls asleep, not yet able to control his subconscious, he dreams unwillingly of smooth, tanned skin and messy hair and thick knit socks.
Between the salves and the potion, he’s feeling rather comfortable, and hums in understanding as Harry returns to talking through the plot. His eyes drift open and closed, especially once he’s caught him up and gone back to watching quietly. They argue a lot in this film. He listens with closed eyelids, reminded of home.
“Yesterday you came to work late with your hair wet, when I asked how you were you laughed really oddly,” Ron’s counting on his fingers, “Oh, and there’s a pretty sizeable love bite on the side of your neck.”
Often, now, Draco worries about miscommunication. This is for obvious reasons. The last thing he wants as he fumbles his way through a new phase in their relationship is to give the impression that he’s put his work first.
?” The way Potter looks at him is disconcerting; hopeful, willing to hang onto every word, as if Draco has stories previously locked out of his life.
He wants to impress upon Harry that he can barely grasp that any of this has happened. That he’d thought of this, in his weakest moments, but never with the imagination that it could come true. Not, at least, until last week, from which point it’s been an almost constant train of thought in the back of his mind. That already, still hot and breathless, it wasn’t enough. He hadn’t prepared for Harry to have such an immeasurable effect on him.
“But look how far you’ve already taken us!” says Harry, looking toward the thick bramble of roots they’re approaching.
Sometimes, he’d even watch the Quidditch matches from the teacher’s section, where he’d end up beside Luna Lovegood, who’d just come on for Divination. She spoke to him keenly about his studies, completely disregarding any awkwardness of their school years or the faculty-pupil dynamic they now found themselves in.
A centre section of Harry’s curls might be held in a small tie, but he thinks he could give Draco two braids at least past his ears with minimal fly-aways. He’d gotten Pansy to trim it once since they’d been friends, before it could reach a ‘Lucius-adjacent’ length, as he’d described it to Harry.
Harry does as told, granting Draco a minute of uninterrupted staring, beholding the concentration in his screwed-up mouth and eyes shut tight. He wants to tell him to stop tensing up so much, to put less energy into it. Belatedly, he remembers he’s teaching him and he can and should advise him.
A smile crosses her lips and she shifts the bag on her shoulder to sit better. “Tale as old as time, dear. I’m off, Draco, owl me soon.
“You’re not going to kill me, are you?” he finds himself joking in nervousness. “I don’t think I’d be the first life lost down here.”
Only when their stomachs begin growling again do they consider leaving the tranquillity of the bed. Draco looks out the window thoughtfully, at the disturbingly cloudless sky.
“I’d reconsider that, Potter,” Murray mutters through gritted teeth. “We could hold Malfoy. Just for a day or two to stave off the
Harry had traced the path of the pencil lines around the quote, imagining Draco circling them. He could see him from here, across the way from his seat on the reading chair. He’d gotten some work back for the draft of his new book and was covering the dining table across the hall completely with pages, biting his lip with concentration and muttering to himself as he rearranged the stacks of papers. His hair had fallen messily into his face and, more noticeable with the thoughts on Harry’s mind, his sleeves were rolled past his elbow.
“Well, she wrote—you can’t blame her, a mother gets excited when her son is seeing a beautiful young woman—once he’s
Eventually, after he’s digested enough of breakfast, Draco browses his medicine cabinet and returns with the hangover concoction. “It doesn’t taste great,” he warns as Harry tilts it up to his lips, coughing as he apparently comes to the same conclusion.
He’s already in the ring, setting his water outside the ropes and limbering up, so Harry leans his arms against the slack of the top cable.
on this, Potter,” Murray sighs, with such weariness in his voice that Harry is sure Draco can tell this isn’t their first time having this conversation. He’s humiliated by the idea of Draco, published author, curse specialist, self-sufficient success story, catching him out for the failed paper pusher he feels to be. “Are you saying Harry Potter and the ‘best curse specialist in England’ can’t handle this?” He holds his fingers up and curls them into air quotes, demeaning them further. “Which is it? You need help or your curse specialist is good at his job?”
The Malfoy airs had dropped so quickly when the door shut, when it was just them, so it had been easy to forget how uncomfortable he’d been just outside the building. The sneer in his voice, even if it’s not antagonistic towards Harry, reminds him again, and he feels terrible, suddenly, for keeping him here even a moment longer than necessary.
“I’m sure he is. All I hear about is Draco’s research, his books, his handsomeness… Your mother makes you out to be quite the intellectual heartthrob.”
“Here,” he murmurs, looking towards one wall, and in his periphery, he watches Draco do the same and nod in agreement.
He scans the page, but his eyes just read the same sentence over and over. There’s a sharp pinching at his temples and a tightness in his throat that returns in the constancy with which he wishes to share these things with Draco.
“BLIMEY! That Bludger hit to Gryffindor chaser Moris looked nasty, hope she’s okay. Well, she’s still on her broom, which is likely a good sign, I suppose—“
But if it’s not a ‘huge mistake’, has he taken the time to consider whether they’d be good together? He’d never thought hard on it because he hadn’t seen the point—he’d never imagined his current situation would become a reality. Is it worth it to pursue this at the risk of losing such an irreplaceable friendship? Or have they already risked it?
Neither of them notices the ‘We’ they’ve each offered. Harry sighs, biting at the inside of his cheek in careful thought. “I think I’d leave Sirius’ room as is. I—all this studying I’ve been doing on family… it’s strange that it hasn’t gotten to include him.”
“Oh, okay. I was going to see if Luna was available. She does a lot of the career counselling at Hogwarts now, and I’m officially not above being coached like I’m sixteen again. I’ll just schedule around you two.”
“I have binned the yoghurts that were in the icebox,” Draco recites. “Forgive me, they were old, so mouldy and so expired.”
They begin as they always do, with drills focusing on specific skills, but the tension Draco felt in the study has followed him into the training room like a shadow. He ignores it the best he can. Harry, meanwhile, spurred by his proficiency at Jab, is challenging him more than usual, and pushing him to work harder.
Harry nods, face screwed up. Draco watches him remember his earlier advice and relax the tension in his body. He feels a surge of fondness for Harry’s skill at taking direction. He’s a fast learner. A good student.
There’s a commendable chorus of polite protest to this, everyone jumping over each other to tell Harry he’s a fine Auror. He wasn’t reaching for compliments. He’s not sure he knows how. Even Ron always seems to take his candid admissions of disillusionment for the job as self-deprecating humility. He never argues back. They have the same job, after all, which Ron loves—he’d be an arsehole to start denouncing it.
“Yeah. I disagree with people loads.” Teddy flops back flat on the grass. “Riley, my neighbour, she’s twelve and she says if you kiss before you’re sixteen, you get transfigured into a frog.”
He doesn’t argue against the adage. She’d long ago turned the man into an epithet, like the hero of his own Greek tragedy.
While Harry slowly works through the open space, he lays back and looks at the framed photos, thinks about the images from a life Harry lived after him and then before him again, only rising when he’s beckoned again.
Her face shocks him from his thoughts. Draco hasn’t seen his aunt besides photos—she’d been disowned long before his birth—and it catches him by surprise to see so many of his own mother’s features, and those of Bellatrix, on the kind face that answers the door.
Draco was doing a great impression of someone keeping a watchful eye on the football score, but his head snaps to the intruder and his eyes are wide in recognition. “I’m not, I—this is unrelated to what you—it’s not that.”
“Harry, surely you can’t remember every time you put it down—you look at that file more than you look at me.”
He knocks his feet together, spreading his arms out like he’s going to create a snow angel in the greenery. “I think it’s rubbish. You don’t need turning into a frog to tell you that kissing is gross.”
Avoiding Blaise also, unfortunately, means he can’t concoct any appropriate drama to use as an excuse—he has no interactions to draw from. Luckily, Blaise, brows furrowed in deep thought as he tries to imagine where he’s wronged his friend, makes a suggestion first.
He thinks of Harry not knowing until the Cruciatus Curse hits that it’ll feel like life-ending torture, never learning to curb its effects. Harry doing all this with his face splashed on every issue of the
Harry wakes up, like you often do on vacation, confused by his surroundings. After a moment, it sets in—first with the view out the balcony that he’s still facing, then with the sound of running water in the bathroom, reminding him that he’s not alone.
Eventually, he strays from Draco entirely, taking interest in a circular fountain at the centre of the garden, surrounded by stepped rings of grass and flowers like ripples in a pond. The gardens are mostly empty—the sun is setting and closing time surely approaching—so he stands quietly facing the fountain and a stately building in the distance behind it, and watches and listens to the fountain spout and spray meditatively.
And Draco, in response, communicates similarly, like the book he’s diving into tonight in the hopes that he’ll be able to gift something in Sirius Black’s memory to Harry. He’s seen what it would mean to him. But he wonders, now that it’s more of an option than their relationship previously allowed, whether Harry wants more.
“This skull, the Borgin and Burkes find, no? Much more complicated. It’s been charmed to train its gaze on the viewer
being called powerful. Do you know who was powerful? Dumbledore. And Voldemort. And I’d like to say that I’m done worrying about being compared to the latter, I know I should be, but apparently, I’m fucking not. He was in my head for… Jesus, for years. I’ve looked through
He makes no further move down the hallway. Instead, he stops, crossing his arms and staring just above Harry with fixed concentration.
He’s wandering down the hallway, aiming past the study and the kitchen and the toilet to the rooms he’s never seen, suddenly caught up in his earlier wish to know every corner of Draco’s life. He’s drawn magnetically, heart still speeding from his brush with almost loneliness.
Harry shoves his shoulder mischievously as he passes him for the stairs. Pancakes, he thinks. And coffee and maybe scrambled eggs. Afterwards, say goodbye to Draco and drag his feet to the Ministry. They’ll see each other tomorrow, hopefully. He’s halfway down when he hears the strangled cry, cut off so suddenly that it instantly raises his heartrate.
“You two want to come handle an unquestionably furious Draco Malfoy and an overconfident Murray instead of taking advantage of an unexpectedly open child-free night? There’s no reason we all must suffer.”
“Probably needed the extra visibility on the road because he looks up and down instead of left and right when he crosses the street,” says Ron with a smirk.
Their fingers brush when they reach for the Portkey, twisting gut-wrenchingly towards England, and they exit the Ministry’s transportation department into steady, cold rain. A proper welcome home. Harry’s quickly pulling a jumper from his bag and Draco ushers them under a nearby awning.
The audience has grown, and though none are foolish enough to come in, they clutch their shopping bags and peer around each other, trying to catch a glimpse of the activity and the Auror at its centre. Harry points his wand at the windows and recites a privacy spell, tinting them from the outside. Some bystanders frowned in sudden disinterest, and the numbers quickly dwindle.
to hear it, what on Earth did you think you were doing? Why would you do this? I went out of my way last weekend to make you feel… ordinary. Unproblematic. Accepted. And you do
And that was what had been on his mind, wasn’t it? When his feet were taking him to Harry’s door tonight? The way Harry’s eyes had looked a bit startled but impressed at Jab. He loved catching Harry by surprise. And impressing him. He could do it again, he thought with a nervous thrill.
Outside the comfort of his regular café, he quickly discovers that while Harry had expertly planned for a crowdless shopping day, the few Sunday shoppers they do encounter are keen to shake his hand or have a word with him or, in the case of one large bearded man in hot pink robes, dig frantically through a shopping bag to find a cauldron cake to offer. Like Harry is a god requiring of food sacrifices.
“Of course not,” he replies, sitting back on his heels. “You first,” he repeats, forcing Draco back into the gravity at hand.
The first afternoon that he’d braved knocking on Draco’s door, he thought he would surely turn him away. But he invited him in, sceptically, and at least found Harry untroublesome enough not to oust.
“Ah, but I’m not the one who wants to learn, and I know you, too; you’ll have fun. You love a challenge.”
Well, that’s less than cheery, Harry thinks. Though at least their juvenile taunts weren’t appearing over the post. He’d felt a strange pang of disappointment reading Malfoy’s quick rejection. Part of him celebrates that the letter is exactly what he’s needed to wash his hands of this bizarre working relationship. But there’s another part of him, burning with the same curiosity that kept them tied to each other in school, that can’t accept Malfoy’s answer as the final one.
He takes them and lets her pull him to where she sits at the foot of the bed. “Ma pupuce,” he whispers. “C’est pas si simple.”
And still, no owl? Nothing from Draco at all? Was he even in London or had he fled to France? Was Harry supposed to chase after him? He won’t. He’ll leave the porch light on but he won’t start a chase. This might seem stubborn, but he can’t see what else he’s supposed to do when the main complaint lodged against him was acting too quickly.
He shakes his thoughts to other things as his pace steadies into a good, conservative clip. Tracing magic—that’s something welcome to focus on. He’s felt a growing delight in the process lately, feeling the traces of magic coursing through him in practice. It’s almost like
I may have been inspired for another tale halfway through writing this one, so if you're interested in more feel free to subscribe. I'll tease a bit—Harry and Draco as a long-married couple, two love stories running parallel in time, Draco, Ron, and Hermione as close friends, and no doubt a mystery... Now to write it!
“Oi, I hear you over there!” Blaise yells drunkenly. “I told my travel agent that I was done ‘dealing with’ hotels, and she
Draco smirks into the potion, back turned. The concoction is thick like a smoothie but smells nothing like, and Harry’s face twists in revulsion when he finally takes the offered glass. He gives it a sniff.
Wishing for an escape, he pulls the covers to his shoulders and tents himself in with a book. It works for a while, but eventually his stomach begins growling and he has to confront the fact there’s no food because Harry usually badgers him into ordering takeaway, insists on cooking something, or judges him persistently enough for not having a stocked fridge to shame him into visiting the supermarket.
With one last deep breath and a quick fruitless run through his hair, Harry steps up. His ears seem to close, the roar of applause sounding muffled like there’s a pillow over his head. He spells a quick Sonorous charm through the roar of applause, amplifying his voice, and sweeps his gaze across the hall of people, landing on Hermione’s encouraging smile. His collar feels exceptionally tight again.
“Draco Malfoy,” the woman says as she enters—one of the Aurors he’d seen at the hospital. Murray stands looming in the shadows behind her, staring him down intensely, alongside two more Aurors.
“I already own this,” he’d mumble, but still hold it in his hands a bit longer, considering a second copy with a different cover.
Some people familiar with post-war Draco tend to label him as quiet, but those are usually the same individuals he’s zipping his lips around to avoid hexing. Among friends, a filter of defensiveness drops. His shoulders relax, he bites back less, laughs more. If anyone who called him cold took ten minutes to observe a night out with Blaise and Pansy, they would know he appreciates a good time.
“I don’t have many photos from Sirius, or I’d have more to give you. Most with Remus I hoard for Teddy, put in albums.”
Draco peeks in the paper bag, smiling when he spies three chocolate croissants. The boxes hold, unsurprisingly, the cursed gifts from last week, but there’s one missing: a mysteriously wrapped package addressed to Harry. For now, he’ll have to start with the bouquet and chocolates from reception.
He’s surprised by the question. “Oh. Never seriously. I wouldn’t want to leave London, I don’t think.”
Almost comically, they both eye each other carefully through the meal, both determined to ensure the other eats well. Harry staring at him intensely over his glasses is striking, he’ll admit, and when he winks back it’s entertaining to watch him blink in surprise and look down at his plate.
When the door shuts behind them, he wants to ask what she told him about Sirius, about Grimmauld Place or his upbringing or Hogwarts or James, but Harry grips his arm vicelike and folds them immediately into space without looking in his direction.
“Ugh, I’m so sorry,” he groans, rubbing a hand tiredly across his forehead. “I’m trying to be present, I don’t know where my mind’s gone today.”
And when Harry pulls away, crosses his arms to pull his shirt over his head, Draco’s left with a brief moment to consider that this is another level of familiarity that’ll be hard to return from. He sits up too, pulls his own shirt off, snickering with Harry when it catches on his nose, but the sound dies in him when Harry pulls his glasses off and tosses them onto the bed beside them, turning back to Draco and skating his hands softly down his torso, past his stomach and lower.
“Alright, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it like that!” Harry says quickly. “I was just trying to empathise. You’ve worked hard the last couple of weeks, I don’t want you to feel like… like it was worthless. You’ve been loads of help.” His brows are wrinkled in such genuine concern for Draco’s understanding that he can’t stay mad. Especially not when he still looks so much paler than usual.
Three beers in, though, and Draco is longing for his bed. Unfortunately for him, his friends’ thoughts are also on his bed—namely who they can find to get in it. He’d emptied his last pint fully through a chorus of “How about him?” and “Her? Her friend?,” shaking his head in refusal at each. Pansy began referring to his ‘romantic slump’.
“We’ll have dinner with him then,” Hermione declares, choosing the most inopportune time to prove that she can, on occasion, read his thoughts.
Then he sees the blackness of his veins, at the fingertips of his right hand. He scrambles to his feet, slipping a little, and runs back down the stairs as fast as possible, thinking
Ron Weasley’s face is almost as red as his hair. And poor Granger is futilely attempting to pull him back into his seat by the shirt sleeve, muttering something up to him through clenched teeth.
For a few minutes, he focuses on bottling up the remaining potion for future sessions as Harry slowly works through the glass, making slight noises of disgust as he does. After it’s emptied, he offers him some chocolate to get the taste out and directs him to the dining table. There are too many cursed and ex-cursed objects from Draco’s work for the study to be a viable training location.
Draco smiles lightly, and Harry keeps glancing at him as though he can feel his stiffness and carefulness. He lays a hand on Draco’s knee and squeezes quickly, masking the brief affection by leaning in for his tea.
staff, but if I wasn’t forgiving then we wouldn’t be like this together, all… forgiven. And you were so stubborn, but look where it’s gotten
“I’ll try to stay out of your hair,” Harry says. It’s not bitter, or even that sad—a marker, perhaps, of their willingness for this time to be different.
He nods distractedly, looking down and flipping through papers until he stops, presumably, on his copy of the latest case report.
Harry stops and swivels his head to meet Draco’s eyes, likely because he never responded, and his own are wildly bright, his mouth drawn into a nervous smile, and with his changed position, his hair begins to blow right into his face. Draco removes a hand from his pocket and gently brushes it aside, so that the wind pushes it towards the back of his head rather than his eyes and he leaves his hand there on his temple, just for a moment, so brief, but Harry closes his eyes and leans toward it with that smile still spreading for just as briefly, and it’s a wonderful snapshot of time, Draco thinks.
Is it alright to walk into a trap when you know it is one? Surely that counts for something. Draco’s face sits in his mind like a beacon. He knows he’s not stopping now, so with a strange sense of resignation and acceptance of whatever’s to come, he sends a Patronus to Ron and Hermione, too—not with his location, but to at least let them know. He hates to do it—there’s nothing as heart-stopping as receiving a Patronus past midnight. Then, with a strangely familiar feeling of walking towards a known fate, he moves to the basement staircase.
For a minute, he focuses on his cooling meal, recovering from such an extensive speech, and in the quiet of their chewing he feels Ginny regarding him with an investigative thoughtfulness that she’s always executed so well.
He pulls a small box from his dresser, searching out two silver cufflinks shaped like snakes, gifted to him by his mother in his fourth year. Before today’s cowardice set in, planning to wear them had felt like a proud testament to Slytherin, but now, still feeling the tingle of dittany on his skin, he hesitates before attaching them.
It reminds him of when people are star-struck by him but go so far out of their way to appear otherwise for his benefit that they overcorrect, and seem to be working incredibly hard to partake in normal human behaviour.
In the ring, Jack is strong and killer fast on his feet. He’s a force of nature, unpredictable, always keeping Harry on his toes. More often than not, he can focus on his friend’s sparring traits and ignore his lopsided grin and the dark hair he swept into a short, offhand bun, but he’s only human, and he’s found that there isn’t enough appreciation for biceps in the wizarding world—too many levitation charms, not enough heavy lifting, he muses.
Perhaps Harry senses the same concerned stillness he’d portrayed the first time he’d seen the Dark Mark in the home gym—a worried prediction of how he’ll be considered—and this is why he offers a purposeful coolness. “You’re lovely as ever,” he breathes.
“Oh, you’re a curse, alright,” Harry grumbles, but he reaches his hand out slowly, hesitating slightly before skating his fingers along the pale flesh of Draco’s inner arm. Miraculously, Draco doesn’t shiver now, though he will later when he thinks back. Harry settles his palm, warm and flat, just below the crook of his elbow and closes his eyes.
“I’m taking a shower. Stay or go.” Draco speaks shortly, then paces to the bathroom and slams the door.
Draco, meanwhile, doesn’t say a word, but Harry hasn’t given him much of a chance. He’s too excited to be walking his neighbourhood with him. Can’t stop pointing out all his local spots. The Indian restaurant he’d found before he even moved in, run by a lovely couple, Sumeet and his wife Vijaya, sometimes with help from their teenaged daughter. The coffee shop where every barista knows his order, and where he’s too polite and touched to correct them when he walks in and hears “Saw you coming, Harry. The usual: Black coffee, two sugars, takeaway!” when he wants to try something new.
, he… listens thoughtfully. But he challenges me. To think differently or consider something new. And there’s a respect to it, so that I—what might not sound nice to you, I can hear the warmth underneath. And when it’s necessary, he shuts up.”
information, just a warning… No, a 'quick update' I believe you called it, in the message. I don’t know who’s denser—you for going in alone or me for really thinking this would be a paper-pushing operation.”
She waits for him to catch up, which he does not. He’s regarded with disappointment and all the sass of her fourteen-year-old self. “Honestly Harry, where are your observational skills? How do you think Malfoy was so quick to recite the counter-curse?”
“I shouldn’t have let my temper get the best of me before when I’d already hurt you. It hit hard. The insinuation that you don’t like me the way I am.”
Then there’s a strange feeling under the bedside table. It’s not foreboding like a curse, or mischievously spiteful like Sirius’ other items. It’s stronger than a regularly charmed object. He summons from under the furniture an unassuming cardboard box, smaller than his palm, and looks to Draco in the doorway, his expression doing all the beckoning necessary.
Draco quirks an eyebrow over the cauldron at Harry, who sits draped across the reading chair like a lounging ancient Grecian, knees hanging over one of the arms, back against the other. He has one of Draco’s ancestral books in hand with his finger shut in the middle as a bookmark, but he hasn’t seen him so much as look at it. He’s much more interested in the final steps of the tracking potion.
He laughs. “For Circe’s sake, Harry, I’ve spent all these months thinking you were a great man and a
Quite honestly, he’d been worried about having any Weasleys at the party, imagining that they’d judge him for the posh location and guests, even if an entire evening celebrating Draco’s success was a once-in-a-few-years event. He should have known Pansy would make it a smashing success, enjoyable and messy and the perfect combination of class and fun.
Draco sits stiffly, waiting with bated breath. The office always smells enticingly like nicotine, always cold. It’s Monday. He was early, and she’d been just as unenthused as if he’d been late.
Harry drops his duffel by that same blue front door, now crowded with kicked off shoes and mail, then heads upstairs for a quick shower.
Draco collapses lifelessly on top of Harry—who responds with an overdramatic wheeze—then splays his arms to his sides and buries an all-too-vulnerable smile into the crook of Harry’s neck. His voice is muffled. “I don’t know. I’ve enjoyed being your friend.”
He considers giving Jack some sort of conciliatory pat on the back but decides he’s better off to just get out of his sight, so he slips past with a sad, apologetic smile, unable to find the door fast enough.
“I’ve already got Arthur’s,” Harry debriefs. “Arthur Weasley, I mean. He’s so easy—anything from Argos makes his year. I hope starting at the Quidditch shop is fine. Could you drink any slower?”
He takes a corner of the gym for himself, easy in the early quiet of the morning, and practices combinations, rolling the momentum of his punches all the way through his ankles and hips, turning at the waist with quick power and exhaling through the thrust of his shoulder as his fist contacts the bag. Again, ankle, hips, waist, shoulder, fist. Again, and again, and again, exclaiming more into the hits as his grouchiness floods through like a dam breaking.
“If we wanted to find the wizard responsible, or at least anything on the objects’ cursed background, can you do that?” he asks.
Finally, at last, he gets to the events of yesterday. He traces the path through their entire afternoon and evening, then scrunches his nose and finally says it.
They land off the path of a brick-paved square by several sunny pink- and tangerine-coloured buildings lined with palm trees. It’s a cheery landscape, and in conjunction with the warm breeze moving off the water, it’s hard not to feel more peaceful.
“Yeah, well I hit the button on the envelope and then names appeared and—not to pry—you sure were laying it on thick with a Jack,” Draco says, frowning at the phone.
Draco shifts again, reaching a hand into the pocket of his trousers. “That reminds me, you left this at mine.” He holds Sirius’ necklace in Harry’s line of sight, and he takes it, lacing it between his fingers.
“I wanted this, too,” Harry says before he can get there. “Honestly, I thought I would get further. I guess I underestimated just what you’d do to my composure.”
“Blimey, you’d think after all this time he would learn to ease the hell off,” he mumbles, shaking his head. “Do you think the reunion atmosphere sucked him back to sixth year or he’s been obsessed with you this whole time?”
The question holds Malfoy’s attention more than the last. He meets Harry’s eyes at length for the first time today. “Pardon?”
Hermione’s right. Of course. Were they completely different or two young men placed at opposite ends of the same spectrum?
Harry nods, still staring at the book with a half-smile. Draco feels a great sense of affection from the genuine pride on his face, the way his fingers trace the spine and flip through the wordless pages yet again.
nauseating arrogance behind that speech you gave to everyone who’d fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. The one about how you single-handedly saved the day? Fantastic way to honour the dead.”
The second interruption begins with a polite knock later that afternoon, and when Harry calls out to come in, he’s surprised to see his first interruption’s wife. He beams when Hermione peeks her head, setting his work down completely.
The other man, meanwhile, is drinking in the attention. He can tell. He winks at Draco, shoos Pansy away from the tabletop and eats another chip.
It hasn’t always been so natural. Directly after the war, he’d mucked things up by getting in his head, spending too much time convincing himself that Ron and Hermione wanted long-overdue alone time, that he was the third wheel ex-hero that neither the world nor his best friends needed around. It had been rather idiotic, but at the time he was dealing with an identity crisis and enormous change.
He drinks slowly, heart beating faster as more guests begin to take their seats, and focuses on the bite of his drink, the carefully-rehearsed words ringing in his ears. He can feel eyes on him, and a look towards the side of the stage confirms that security wizards are watching closely, waiting for him.
Maybe he should have mentioned that she’d spent a night in one of Narcissa’s new guest rooms after dinner, maybe mentioned the awkwardly silent breakfast, or the nudge his mother had given him to personally see her out. But how was he to know Andromeda Tonks of all people would inform Harry?
Harry crawls onto Draco’s bed and sits beside where he stands combing his hair. It had taken a moment too long to tell him whether he slept well, and when he did it was followed by a nice smile that would have been acceptable if Draco hadn’t gotten to know his expressions so well. When he says, “Where to, O holder of secrets?” there’s a flicker in his eye that doesn’t quite match his cheeriness.
He takes that as a yes. Draco finally opens his eyes when he jostles him aside to sit on the edge of the bed, yawning relentlessly.
And then. Is it enough of a privilege to have been kissed by Draco once—admittedly once more than he’d ever expected? To have been kissed by him at all?
He changes quickly, throwing his bag over his shoulder. He panics momentarily at the entrance when he realises Draco is gone, but then he sees his form outside the doors and joins him in the cool September air.
“Essentially, it acts as an unidentifiable necklace from one, er, paramour, shall I say, to another, but if the giver is in mortal danger, it alerts the recipient.”
He watches Draco roll his eyes with a winning groan. “You’re impossible. One nice comment and you turn it all around.”
He looks unsure of how to recover, green eyes flickering back between both of Draco’s. But whatever he was considering, the safe answer probably wasn’t “Yes?”
“Princess Roohohose! Is it prescient to stick my unicorn friend in your mohohoouuth when you must venture to the castle to rescue the queeheeheen?!”
They only speak of anything easy. Harry explains why cooking was another thing he’d reclaimed from an unfortunate relationship created with it during his childhood, but offers no specifics. Draco mentions how much he’d begun devouring Muggle authors after school and the war, but skips speaking of the same probation that’d allowed for his time-consuming reading habits. They talk of favourite restaurants, of
It hurts a lot more than Harry probably intends it to, and Draco blames himself for the years of a devil-may-care attitude that’s no doubt portrayed him as someone who doesn’t care what others think. It’s a reminder of what most think of him. And that Harry’s an outlier in a society that mostly remembers but doesn’t forgive his history. He feels his ears heat and now he does snatch the book, reaching over the bed between them to do so. He turns away from Harry’s shocked face.
But he also uses his study, accepts free trips to his ancestral homeland, takes his help on a Ministry case, and repays him how? By absolutely demolishing him at sparring? By staining their friendship with the thoughts he has when Draco’s in workout gear or dressed like he is tonight?
“My head is NOT up the Minister’s arse!” Potter snaps, finally standing himself. He almost knocks the bench over with the jerk of his movement.
He has to duck away from a finger that Ron’s pointed at his approaching form when he returns to the table and sets down the round of meads as he declares, “Ask Harry!”
It feels as though Harry and Draco have gone into orbit, ever since the afternoon he landed nearly on top of Harry on the stoop outside his home. And though they’d only moved a fortnight or so forward in time, their relationship has slowed in the physics of outer space as if it’s been years.
Blaise and Pansy both look respectfully agreeable for a moment, but it’s not built to last. Pansy seems bright with deviousness.
“Tea,” said the house-elf, presenting a platter complete with cups and milk and sugar cubes and Draco’s missing trousers, perfectly folded. “Cadry thought Master might want his slacks from the library before Mistress tidies.”
“Okay,” Draco says, tilting his head. He gently untucks Harry’s shirt as he speaks. “I’ve fancied someone for a while, and the universe kept placing obstacles between us, and I thought I’d surpassed them, but even now he doesn’t seem to grasp that I would like to be done talking business and get around to other things…”
“It was rather boyfriendly, wouldn’t you say? I think it was a perfectly normal reaction when you lo-care about somebody,” Draco offers.
They are indeed interrupted—Ron and Hermione being the first to greet them, thankfully, and they take over for the rest of the introductions to let Molly get back to her hostess tasks at hand.
Next, he guides them to Wordsworth’s grave, in the churchyard at the centre of the village. St. Oswald’s Church. It’s named after a seventh-century king, he proudly recites from Hermione’s tourism book. The main structure is nestled among massive knotted yew trees, and they regard the writer’s grave and the surrounding nature quietly before following the banks of the River Rothay further, down a stone path that leads deeper through vegetation parallel to town.
It all happens so suddenly. He turns, and a cloaked figure cuts a silhouette into the alley’s opening, raising a wand. He lifts his own.
“No, of course not! It’s completely unrelated,” he promises, ears burning. “Why would you even say that?”
He leads her into the dining area and pulls out a chair, praying to any deity who’ll listen that it’s clean and tidy enough to meet her standards. The tea set is already in the centre of the table, so he politely sets the dishes before her and excuses himself to heat the kettle.
The lift creaks to a stop, and Harry holds a hand out slightly to indicate that this isn’t their stop, just as two men from MLE’s legal department cram in.
Flitwick’s stern expression flips instantly back to jolliness as he says, “Wonderful, wonderful, then! Do reach out if you have any more questions. It’s been good to discuss, just like old times! Just… more careful with the cursed objects, please.”
with—Harry Potter with minimal hostility has he been left thoughtful and distracted. He doesn’t tolerate diversions when working with cursed objects.
Ron regards him keenly and gestures to the chair across from his own. Harry sits, and he leans forward in his seat with enthusiasm.
It’s a slow read, all in French, and he must take time to translate each sentence, but there’s a chapter on diagnosing powerful light magic that seems to follow his own research and the advice he’d received, and he recognises excitedly that if he starts brewing immediately after dinner, he might have a diagnosis for Harry by tomorrow afternoon.
She rolls her eyes like he’s reminded her of the aggravating fact of his continued survival. “You’re fine, Harry, honestly. A spanner in the works is all. Finding your body in the mailroom should’ve sealed Malfoy’s fate… But here you are now, delivering yourself to me!”
He keeps watching Harry, but his eyes are glued to the floor and he doesn’t respond to Draco’s information. He pulls him in again and kisses his head, then his temple, his ear, the hollow of his cheek, and finally it seems to break the trance, pulling at the corners of Harry’s mouth.
“Oh god,” he grunts. He sees Harry’s blurry figure in his sight as he races towards the toilet, collapsing in front of it just in time. He raises his arm and wandlessly slams the door just as Harry approaches.
keeps echoing through his head as he heats up leftover fried rice and eats absentmindedly standing in the kitchen. He hasn’t thought about Jack seriously since just after his Muggle pub night with Draco. His work and the surprise of an unexpected but gratifying friendship have distracted him, but now his mind travels back to the locker room.
With just a hint of guilt considering the man he’d left behind, Harry finds himself stopping outside the first bookstore he passes—an old narrow building with a window display bursting with books by all the old romantic authors. He’ll be back tomorrow with Draco, he’s sure of it, but he steps in regardless.
Draco arrives at Harry’s early with breakfast from Spoonfuls and they eat hastily at the table as the sun cracks the horizon, buzzing with sleepy but excited energy. They both have their hands on the Portkey three minutes early, and when it finally transports them at seven sharp, Harry stomachs the nastiness of the voyage to find himself spit out into a travel hub near the Muggle parliament.
is a gorgeous thing to write home about. They give each other so much kindness, as if unspeakingly making up for all that juvenile cruelty. But if he hasn’t been able to vocalise this well to himself or Draco, how can he to his best friends? Hermione often seems to read his mind, but her brows are currently knitted in concern that suggests he hasn’t gotten lucky this time.
has changed its tune lately, hasn’t it?” Harry catches the confusion in Draco’s eyes. He doesn’t know.
He wishes this made it any easier to accept a deep green jumper with a D on it from Molly—hand-knitted. He pulls it on over his shirt when he watches Harry do the same. Hermione and Ron’s gift leaves him speechless long enough for Ron to begin looking concerned and ask Hermione if it was too far.
Harry’s heart is still heavy when he gets home, peeling off his Auror robes, eyes tired from the extra hour he spent after the party trying still to find a seemingly nonexistent connection between the department and his existing evidence, between the department and the victims, between the department and Draco. Marinella’s whispered offer of help echoed in his thoughts like a comforting confirmation that he wasn’t mad to feel like his case was being stalled everywhere but on paper.
“It’s disconcerting when you announce that. Like you’ve gotten into divination and there’s something you know that I don’t.”
Luna giggles generously, though she knows just what Harry's been planning. “Go ahead and tell them,” she urges warmly. “It’s a wonderful idea.”
He follows his instincts anyway, feigning obliviousness just as he had in the boxing ring, and picks back up into a fast walk, ears attuned and listening carefully.
It’s getting a bit old, Harry thinks. How often he finds himself defending a friend who’s been exonerated for years. He can’t imagine how tiring it must feel to
The first time Harry feels like Draco has fully rejoined the conversation is while he and Ron are lamenting about the current authority figures in the Auror department. Compared to the strong-armed occupation from the second wizarding world, Harry thinks Murray’s human errs of incapability seem like a blessing.
“That—” She knocks Draco’s closest leg with a boot and he glares, pulling his legs in. “—was a bit of a curveball, the two of you. Of course, it’s always been Malfoy, but your…
Draco walks beside Blaise, behind Pansy and Harry on the pavement, working against the surrealism of the moment he’s found himself in.
“At least we know for certain that the same person cast both curses?” Harry suggests cheerfully, watching Draco’s face.
Harry caught his gaze, shaking his head minutely even as his lips curled up. Ron put a hand on his back, thrusting him in front of the Weasleys and fully into Draco’s view. He looked impeccable. Tragically handsome. It should’ve ruined him, that beauty, made him incapable of continuing but somehow it bolstered him instead. He held those green eyes firmly as he pressed on.
“I have a good friend, Draco, also in publishing. He’s very talented, has been working for decades, published the Scrope book in fact. I remember because at the time, the concept of a book offering any help towards the removal of Dark Marks, even only in implication, was heinous. Do you know how he got away with the publishing?”
myself pushing him away before I’d comprehended it. I think there’s just too much on my plate, what with this big Ministry case, and… yeah.”
and he doesn’t know what that should feel like if it’s a danger to him, but he remembers Draco touching Leonard in the bookshop and looks at the curse running through his veins—already almost to his elbow—and chooses to risk it.
He nods and guides him to look to his right, traces the line of his split lip, then lifts his shirt. He notices when Harry winces as he lifts his arms, and investigates the remnants of hex damage on his bicep and his upper ribs.
He’s catching and releasing a chocolate frog Draco had charmed to hide and await discovery, forcing him to feel for its specific magic trace throughout the flat. It’s been a good system; something as small and benign as a charmed sweet requires more finessed skill to trace than an Unforgivably cursed skull. Harry was practising nonstop.
He rubs his eyes and leaves his hands there, his palms muffling the end of his speech. “So what’s happening is I’m thinking this was all a huge mistake and I’m not exactly someone who needs to advertise that he’s harnessing his power, and—or whatever. I think this is a bad idea. I don’t want to be unstoppable, I think. I’ve decided I’d prefer to be… stoppable.”
Harry takes a moment to retreat meditatively, face turning expressionless, just to ensure that when he speaks again it won’t be to hex an unarmed man on Ministry property. He sticks the wand through the slats of the cell, exhaling slowly to control his irritation when Malfoy snatches it rougher than necessary.
Draco offers an easy shrug to affect an untruthful level of ease, and he sees Harry blink in surprise at the gesture.
Subconsciously, Harry’s hand rises to his chest, flat against the necklace. It’s beating fast, too. Hermione eyes him where he’s stilled in the doorway. His hands are curled tightly around the spare clothes Ron’s picked up for him.
He’s too stunned to press for clarification, struggling to comprehend that Harry’s already feeling the traces so properly, and instead closes his hand around Harry’s wrist and drags his distracted friend into the dining space with interest.
“Coming!” He shouts over his shoulder, ignoring Harry’s stunned face. “Please, just for a minute. It’ll be so quick.”
“These stories aren’t for you either. Go fly with Teddy.” He doesn’t look Draco’s way, even as he barks orders.
passed the line into hate ages ago. Probably at eleven,” he replies. “Which is why it’s such a disaster that I need his help with work. God, I never want to see his face again, it’s all way too complicated to be worth it.” He leans forward and cradles his head in his hands. He feels Jack place a hand on his back in sympathy.
Merlin, he’s so close. Enough so that Harry must choose between looking at each of the man’s eyes. Indecisively, he flicks between them.
Draco pushes past where he’s stopped oddly just inside the room, tossing his bag down on the bed closest to the door. “’
There’s an electric buzz in the air between them; two empty whiskey glasses, four provoking eyes, and a distance over the table that seems to subconsciously lessen.
Harry gives him nothing more than eye contact, a little quirk of the head, squinted eyes, and a minute frown, and Ron proficiently reads the question in it. He answers it equally infinitesimally to all but Harry—a flash of wide eyes, a momentary lopsided smile.
Harry doesn’t like the way he says that, the thick undertone of tension and seriousness in the conversation. He’s always taken the case seriously, of course, but it feels like Draco’s removal and the quietness since the Ministry curses has thrown them into the belly of the whale—dark, consuming, directionless.
Work hadn’t proved as joyous; the day after Harry’s foray back to the gym, a neat pile of diagnostics on the cursed objects arrived on his desk in Draco’s neat, loopy script. It included all the positive hits he’d gotten, as well as potential unclear results and negative tests. Harry sent it off to the Junior Aurors to assemble a compendium of potion shops in London and their catalogues, cross-referenced for the ingredients in both curse makeups and Nightshade ingredients, the residue found on several of the objects.
Harry quiets. He’s so hot and cold. Congenial. Then self-protective at the turn of a sickle. The unpredictability of it fills him with a rush that makes it hard not to bicker back, but he badly wants to appear unflappable.
Draco flashes a grateful smile for the no-nonsense start. “Well, you may remember I’ve been working on de-escalation charms for cursed objects. The way I worked it out went great for smaller instances, like the stinging-hexed diary. I’ve charmed it down to where the diary just feels like a static shock.”
After a minute of scribbling, Draco sweeps the book and papers into his arm and drops them on the rug in front of Harry. He levitates the skull over, too, and sets it between them as he settles in on the floor. Harry sits quiet. Patient.
“That was endearingly challenging,” says Ron, standing and leaving Draco to sit in wonder, replaying how quickly the game had turned. “You’ll tell Harry I stopped over?”
Another knock, and Harry rushes to the door, opening it and feeling a rush of disappointment tighten his insides.
At this, Narcissa nods seriously, raising her chin in pride at her son’s importance. She’s already walking to the door as she says, “Never mind, I must be off regardless.” She kisses him once on each cheek and sweeps a hand across his hair behind his ear.
The bloody chair. The chair. He’d be angrier with himself if he’d been expecting company, but as it stands he hadn’t thought someone would waltz into his home and begin collecting evidence against him like it’s a crime scene. He runs a tired hand through his hair, then leaves it on his forehead and stares down at the table.
There’s red spotted on the carpet, trailing all the way to the bathroom, where it looks disturbingly like a crime scene.
Blaise sets his hand on Draco’s other shoulder, and he suddenly feels embarrassed and a bit pitying for Harry, like he’s been ganged up on. Blaise is just trying to be a good friend, though, and Pansy is doing the same, which in ignorance of their updated conflict involves being warm and open to Draco’s new friend.
he thinks, punching harder with each word. The bag creaks as if crying in surrender when he pulls his arm back again.
“Delightful,” he said to Dante. He’d spent the rest of the day rewriting the chapter, and it was longer, better, more insightful, less disorganised. It felt like a true introductory chapter, capable of the job he’d set it out to do. Part of him thinks he should tack the first version to the wall in the study; a reminder of what happens when he works too quickly, too distracted.
“Harry… I…” Draco starts. He reaches his free hand up instead of finishing, carding it through Harry’s hair, then pulling lightly at his scarf to bring him into a tender kiss.
Nothing logical, not since Kanpai. He’s existed, since, in two forms. One lay in a flustered heap, overwhelmed, embarrassed, faltering and firmly incapable of looking Harry in the eye ever again. The latter worked tirelessly to hide the former, to maintain an appearance of unchanging friendliness, and if sometimes it weakened and his hand went to Harry’s knee or he leaned in late at night in the pub, drunk on Harry’s words, then he’s still only human.
The head nods gratefully and vanishes. The fire immediately smokes out. Harry almost disapparates without remembering why he’d been putting his shoes on to begin with.
Harry feels a familiar flutter of love for the game when they turn into the pitch—he can see the lines of freshly manicured grass on the field, hear the croaking of the steps leading to the stands on either side of them, and if he closes his eyes, he can almost feel the thickness of Quidditch robes sit on his shoulders.
“It’s wonderful,” he murmurs, eyes still glued to the view. Immediately, he drops his work on the table in front of it and begins to unpack, so Harry takes both their bags upstairs to the bedroom. It makes him think of their last trip, with its two double beds and the crippling fear he’d experienced when he thought he’d have to share. He’d have it no other way, now.
his normal self, but Harry can’t shake the feeling that something is different. He sees it in the way Draco’s eyes either linger or completely avoid him at a moment’s whim and the way that with everything he says it appears he’s thinking an entire second set of thoughts.
he thinks, so he lowers them to sit on each side of Jack’s hips, feeling as though the adrenaline in the back of his throat is pulling forward, feeding off their movements, and it fills him with rash excitement that he translates into deepening the kiss.
Harry kneels in front of the reading chair and picks up his book. When a sheet of parchment begins to fall out, Draco snatches them both from his hands just as Harry starts to show interest. It’s been a calculated choice since the curse to keep something from him—a decision for his own good, because knowing that Draco’s slowly resigned himself to the fact that he’ll be named for the crime soon if they don’t figure something out will only be a detriment to his productivity.
He turns quickly towards Murray, who’s staring at him, looking bored. He sits up and straightens his papers.
In the yellow light of the streetlamp above them, his face looks even harsher than usual, casting dark shadows where his hair drapes over his forehead, under his eyes, and drawing sharp lines under the hollows of his cheekbones. Standing across from him looking so severe, Harry thinks abruptly of how charmingly round his face and cheeks look when he lucks into a full Draco grin.
“Obviously,” Draco mutters. “Though in your defence, I’d also want a couple of decades of constancy if I’d had your youth.”
Just an epilogue left, and with Draco to boot! Thanks again for all the lovely feedback, kudos, reading. I hope it's been enjoyable!
Ron seems to realise that he hasn’t invited him in yet and opens it wider. Harry meets Hermione’s eyes across the house, where she stands in a dressing gown with her hair tied up in a satin scarf. He’s definitely intruded on their evening, especially as his suspicions continue to grow that they were about to take advantage of their daughter’s unconsciousness with their own.
Draco turns to her, looking significantly less stricken to be caught out than Harry feels. “We’re not fighting, Pans, he was asking after us.”
Ron cocks an eyebrow, leaning forward from Pansy’s other shoulder. “Didn’t you do a divorce settlement last month? What kind of lawyer
He’s pointing to the screen behind Draco, who twists around to watch a furious player storming off the field, while Healers run to a man sitting fallen in the centre of the field. His face is bloody.
Draco leans down to kiss Harry’s lips awkwardly, perpendicular. “Can we put this on hold,” he asks sweetly. “Just until after Christmas day?”
“God almighty,” Harry sets his palms flat on the table and looks at Draco, eyes full and mouth creeping up with an idea. How had it not occurred to him? “I have objects. I have cursed objects and they’re yours, just say the word. Although, no, you’re right, what am I saying? I’m first in line to tell you to take a break, so actually—“
And so yes, this is all to say that he certainly feels rather comfortable with Ron and Hermione and even Ginny by now—none of which, unfortunately, lowers the specific anxiety he feels for entering the Weasley sanctum itself.
“Thanks, I’ll… see you around,” he says again, frowning thoughtfully. He still looks distant and a bit peaky when he reaches for the floo powder.
“That’s rather stereotypical and bigoted of me. So now I’m deciding how long to give it before I confront him and force him to let me down easy, because the waiting is horrible. I saw him today, in Diagon. Said roughly five words.”
It had been too long since they had seen each other, and Draco thought his arrival might be due to Pansy’s influence, so he quickly accepted. He tuned him out as promised and barely registered each time he threw his hands up and demanded justice for his client.
“I just really don’t think so, I don’t know what I’ve done to her. I think… I’m just a pawn—for once. And, as Draco’s reminded me multiple times, many people hate him for
“Potter,” he greets. His posture had been relaxed, crouched over his book with an elbow on the tabletop, but now he sits upright again, chin high. Harry wonders if that other Malfoy makes gay jokes or just this haughty one.
The bedroom is clear, as is the bathroom, but in the drawing room Harry hesitates significantly for the first time. Eyes already closed with a sweeping hand, he pauses and collects his breath. Suddenly, the feeling of a dozen malicious auras.
They’re not alone—it’s one of the most popular areas of the village, even early on a Tuesday morning—so Harry is caught well off guard when Draco reaches for his hand again. They’re halfway over a bridge, strolling unhurriedly towards the gingerbread shop, and Harry turns to meet his eyes.
“Oh, okay.” Oddly, at this confirmation, he moves his hand back to the scar, runs his fingers over it with gentle care, saying quietly, “That’s good.” Then, seeming to recognise the intimacy of his actions, he pulls back and raises his bare hand vertically between them. “Now punch me.”
He’s just gotten into a good rhythm of writing when the telltale sound of an active floo interrupts his thoughts. It leads him to tense up, embarrassingly, and he relaxes only slightly when he sees it’s just Blaise; he doesn’t feel like entertaining, and Blaise Zabini especially requires a high level of participation.
With a little more guts, he’d take Harry’s camera and capture the moment, but instead he sits back and takes it in himself, tries to memorise the details of the humid air and the rosiness of Harry’s cheeks, the way his arms flex easily with the slow rowing on the canal and the folds of his belly appear and disappear beneath his open shirt with each pull of the oar.
“What the hell are you doing?” he baulks, inching back. He’s never noticed all the flecks of greens in his eyes, mixed with ambers and almost-blues, like a jar of sea glass.
“Why is this framed as though there’s any competition between her husband and this old boyfriend?” he asks thirty minutes in. “Her husband is much closer to her age, respectful, and a resistance leader. He’s handsome and fights Nazis.”
“Right, then deliberation took longer than expected, so of course I ran late. But, Harry—“ He reaches out and grabs Harry’s forearm, no longer fighting the grin on his face. “She won!”
“Murray’s won an award again,” Ron says after a few minutes of hungry silence where they blaze through half their lunch.
“Let’s walk this way!” Blaise puts his arm around her shoulder and waves back to Draco as they turn away. “Have a good night. Nice to see you again, Harry!”
He’s right, and it makes it harder to leave him here alone. “Come closer, just for a second?” he tries.
Draco follows him through the stalls, browsing casually, then surprising him yet again by haggling. Harry has to put a hand over his mouth to hide a smile as he very earnestly bargains with a merchant for a necklace he had mentioned for Hermione.
?” he pants, spitting out a mouth guard and tucking his water bottle under his armpit. “That was a nasty blow, mate. I’ll be nursing it for a while.”
Draco had wrestled out from the blankets under him and begun to reach for his arms. He freezes, listening politely, but scowls.
On the edge of the grass, though, he can see Harry trying to levitate just Teddy’s shoes and take him with them, and it’s too endearing to interrupt so he stands for a moment with his fists in his pockets, trying to pick Ron or Hermione or Dromeda out from the crowd outside.
“I’m afraid I didn’t think to bring a broom,” Harry adds, setting aside a charmed stopwatch from Hermione that he’d been playing with.
“Hey, do you think this stripey polo goes with jeans?” Harry asks after a moment, holding it up as if everything doesn’t go with jeans.
he thinks, glancing back at Draco’s still form. His own heart is pounding wild, accelerating steadily with his discovery and much faster than the gold charm that’s beating a slow pulse under his hand, but he’d wager that, were he to place his other hand lightly against Draco’s own chest as he drifted to sleep, the heartbeat underneath would match rather well.
In addition to the necklace diagnostics, he’s also provided his rearranged, rewritten drafts of the first manuscript chapters and the completed skull chapter. His editor turns to this now, her beaded glasses chain swinging as she pushes the lenses higher on the bridge of her nose.
“Forget it, Harry, just get ready,” comes his voice from the edge of the bed. He’s wrestling on a pair of shoes too nice for hiking, but he says nothing. Just complies, letting his hands leave his hair and hanging a scarf around his neck.
Their little home is Saturday-morning cosy, with all the windows open to bright sunlight. There’s laundry sitting half-folded on the couch and the air is perfumed with pine-scented cleaning products. Hermione drops back down on the sofa and begins depositing folded clothes into a laundry basket.
“Dark magic,” he points out, then moves it to his forehead, brushed under his hair, to sit against the lightning bolt. He says again, “Dark magic.”
“He was on the Wizengamot, but this book is on wizarding roles in the World Wars. I did some serious digging to find him in it. The Minister for Magic was forbidding wizards from helping Muggles during the First World War and he criticised him for it. That’s partly why you weren’t in the Sacred Twenty-Eight.”
“Well, then I’m coming with you. Let me do the tracing. And make you breakfast first. You didn’t eat yesterday.”
No one’s asked him this in a very long time. He reaches for memories of telling Ron and Hermione and then reconfigures them for the first time to tell someone who’s not the brother and sister-in-law of his ex. He narrows his eyes at Draco, trying to calculate what he’s up to.
“I just can’t understand how Gin somehow remains impartial enough to teach Quidditch,” he’s saying. “She’s the most headstrong Gryffindor I’ve ever met.”
They circle each other again, Draco instigating more often than before, but never with a solid hit. When he opens his stance wide, inviting easy contact, Harry’s eyes widen and his mouth creeps into a knowing smile, but Jack doesn’t see it as the trap Draco’s set. It’s a cunning move; he’s recognised that his opponent thinks him weak, and so he feeds him just that.
“Thank you,” Draco sighs, taking the broom out of Harry’s hands the second they get through the door of Grimmauld Place that night. He sets it with the bag they’d brought home, full of gifts and sweets.
can hear the warmth in his voice but Ron bristles. Hermione seems undecided and challenges him back. She lifts her chin.
