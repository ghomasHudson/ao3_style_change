letting the Ministry know. Ever.
But then, at the bottom, in George’s handwriting it says, “Edgecombe still seems unhappy about DA, but she hasn’t done anything.” Then, in Fred’s handwriting, “Spoke to her a little. Turns out she’s terrified of all the Slytherins. Might be useful!” Followed by the most patronizing drawing of a heart Draco had ever seen. He wasn’t sure how a heart could be patronizing, but the twins had managed it.
When Eve suggests a card game and she goes off to fetch a deck, it leaves Harry and Draco alone in straining silence.
It doesn’t feel messy, necessarily, but it does feel full and claustrophobic. Maybe the office isn’t tiny at all… it just feels that way with all the stuff.
“I know what I am!” Max is going on, voice no longer defeated but furious, but there is still a warble there that Draco worries about. “I’m a proud Two Spirit, thank you very fucking much! Fuck Adham Najjar and his pompous ass! Just because I’m not something you understand doesn’t mean I’m wrong!”
“No,” Draco snaps before the ginger can send them all into a panic. “No way. That woman was far too emotional last night. If she’d found something like that, she would have bragged about it. Trust me, as manipulative as that woman is, she’s dreadful at keeping secrets when she thinks she’s won.”
Hermione’s hand shoots up immediately and Lily smiles a bit brighter, but her eyes flicker momentarily past the young witch. It is only a moment, Draco doubts anyone else noticed, but he does and he doesn’t like the implications when he remembers just who is sitting behind them. “Yes, Miss. Granger?”
More chores for the afternoon would be given later and Draco was already plotting ways to lessen his burden with bribes or trickery when Mrs Nubble reappeared in the kitchen with the mail in hand.
Plenty of points were made, valid, logical points, but Fudge ignored them all. Snape even had the courage to show him his own Dark Mark, the color black to indicate the Dark Lord’s return.
Anyway, I hope you enjoy! Big things are happening for Draco!
“And don’t forget it. Come on. We shouldn’t linger,” Granger replies and begins to move away, but Draco stops her.
“I’m not sure if anything can do that, mate,” Ron jokes, smiling brightly, and Harry offers a small smile back.
He doesn’t stop, though.
Growing more and more stressed by the second, thinking himself in circles, Draco growls and forces himself to not think about it. He could brainstorm with Granger or Potter later, maybe when he visited the Burrow. Right now, he was doing himself no favors.
“Yes. I did. Do not expect to hear it again if you intend to keep gaping at me like a fly trap,” Draco snaps before he turns on his heel and marches back to his room, nose held high. He hears the unmistakable noise of Dobby squeaking frantically before tripping over something and toppling to the floor.
“Thank you, Draco,” Luna suddenly pipes up as the door finally swings open, pausing to crouch beside the snow leopard. She runs a hand over his head, scratching behind his ear, before retracting. “We are safe now.”
“We must have just missed each other, then,” James speaks up, voice big and boisterous, cutting off whatever Harry was about to say. The young boy takes it in stride, however, and just seems to readjust what he was going to say.
I’m good enough to be here. I always have been. My father merely took the blindfolds off my team.”
“No,” Granger says before Draco can reply, and she’s back to looking like the definition of professionalism. “This is business.”
The hands tear apart the arch like they’re desperate, breaking the stone to pieces, the huge chunks of debris tumbling into the depths of the curtain as it begins to collapse in on itself. The arms keep ripping at any lingering pieces of arch until all of it has been torn from the earth, the limbs next to collapse into the thrashing, spiralling curtain.
“Wormtail! Focus on Wormtail!” he hisses back and Draco, reluctantly, snaps more and more pictures of Peter Pettigrew as he shifts into a rat to run away. They can’t go after him, Granger explains, since that would be going against all rules of time travel, but he can tell by the way Potter tenses up that he wants to.
“Snape and Moody,” Draco sighs. Out of all his suspects, these two were the two he could never find definitive proof were innocent. He hated putting his godfather on the list, but in the end… well, he couldn’t be emotional about this and the facts were, he knew very little about Snape.
It leaves them all unwilling to even attempt to plan out any future lessons or plans or plots. Granger takes a seat at the table, leaning back in the chair like a ragdoll, Weasley and Harry sit on the floor playing Magic: The Gathering - or attempting, really. Both are terrible without Eve’s guidance - and Draco is back in human form but still buried in the pillows.
“Are they… speaking in opposites?” Theodore questions, voice still low, and the figures both look up at the humans instead.
” Draco has no clue who throws the spell, he just knows it wasn’t Harry. Harry, who’d been staring down Umbridge, ready to do what needed to be done to protect the DA - likely ready to sacrifice himself - but someone had beaten him to it.
“Yeah! When all the Valentine’s candies are discounted at the store! Best. Day. Ever.”
“Oh, I forget how useless you are sometimes,” Draco sighs deeply and it is Potter’s turn to glower. “A grey spell is merely a spell that, depending on your intention and use, can be either a dark spell or a light spell. If you truly wish to be technical, all spells are grey spells, but that is a debate centuries in the making.”
At some point they do end up losing Eve. She hurries on ahead while Draco and Potter linger behind. They are in a tunnel made of glass, aquatic creatures floating all around them, the light a faint blue from the tank.
A few more names later Neville also gets sorted into Gryffindor, still holding his toad despite McGonagall’s disapproving look, and he is greeted warmly as well. Draco wonders if all the people he had met on the train were going to be in the house for the courageous… Also how had that Neville boy gotten into it? He hardly seemed courageous. Draco would have pegged him as a Hufflepuff, if he’d had to guess.
Then Draco blinks and suddenly he’s looking at the high ceiling. It takes him a few seconds to realize he had finally nodded off, head falling back on the couch, and someone is shaking him awake. He blinks, vision blurry, until he can focus on Blaise’s face right above him.
Eve’s wand crackles through the air as she shoots a bolt of purple lightning at Millicent’s feet, holding her back from advancing any further. “Oops,” Eve drawls, but there’s a curl to her black lips as she glares at Millicent coldly.
The spot around the Forbidden Forest that he is absolutely positive he saw the attack in is completely abandoned when he scurries up. He stands up on his hind legs, poking his head as high up as he can, and does a cursory look around. His senses feel sharper, and he smells what he thinks are people, but he has no frame of reference to be sure.
“The wand is a most important part of every witch and wizard, Mr. Malfoy,” Ollivander is saying as he measures across Draco’s knuckles, “It is an extension of one’s self. Tricky stuff, finding the right one, but so very rewarding.” With a snap the measuring tape very suddenly retracts and Ollivander pockets it. His expression looked distant, like he was thinking in some other world, and he turns away to start rummaging through the boxes. “The wand picks the owner, you see, so let us try out a few options.”
“It’s the girls’ bathroom,” Harry gasps and Ron looks at him sharply, before also picking up just what that means.
He thinks of the Forbidden Forest, the creature he now knows to be Voldemort approaching two first years, and Draco panicking but grabbing Harry anyway, silently promising himself, on some subconscious level, that he cannot allow Harry Potter to be seriously hurt any more than he already has been.
Potter had so few experiences with loving parents, Draco realized. Having Mr. and Mrs. Weasley there for him was one thing, but they still weren’t always there to pick up the boy when he fell.
He was still rather surprised when all of them woke up with him to give their good-byes that morning, though. Ada had demanded he write to her and send her stuff, and in turn she let him take her CD player with a small album of CDs she’d made on the Nubble’s office computer. Draco didn’t know HOW she’d made the CDs, but he decided he was safer not knowing.
“Always in such a hurry, Potter.”
Draco stashes his camera away in one of his pants pockets, shrunken so as not to ruin the lines of his suit. He hadn’t expected to use it often tonight, especially not with how much dancing he planned to do, but now he was glad he’d brought it.
“I am most certainly not throwing a ‘hissy fit’! I am completely within my rights to be upset.”
“Now, where have you been at this time of night, Hushburn?” Blaise questions innocently as Eve plops down in a loveseat of her own.
Eventually their song choice comes on. Draco knows because Max leaps away, cheering, then starts squirming. Belatedly, with some horror, Draco realizes Max is trying to dance.
Today, he was angry.
“Yes. No. Maybe? I don’t know!” Draco argues even though he doesn’t want to argue. He wants Max to be right. Why would he fight them on this?
And now Bellatrix Lestrange was free once again. Draco’s absolutely insane aunt, Narcissa Malfoy’s sister, Sirius Black’s cousin, was out in the world once more. Draco had hardly been able to eat after reading that…
“Within the legal department I discovered where they keep track of the Trace on all those underage witches and wizards out there,” Draco continues, “And, lo and behold, where usually they have a task force for many, many individuals, they have a set few officials keeping track of your Trace readings alone.”
Flying closer to the ground Draco picks up some speed, grabs the handle tightly, and
“I’m going to be better,” the little wizard announces, standing straighter, and the Muggle woman looks back down at him. “You said people who don’t learn and get better make you mad… so I’m going to be better!”
“And now it’s a term of endearment?” Harry huffs, arching an eyebrow.
“You think it’s an act?” Draco drawls, then ignores the middle finger Eve throws his way.
“What? Where?” Umbridge snaps, turning fully to him.
“Potter!” Crabbe and Goyle say in unison, the Boy-Who-Lived jumping in surprise and finally looking around him, confused. The two, large wizards have moved over to the side of Draco’s bed Harry is currently sitting on, both of them carrying crinkled and frayed parchments in their hands.
“I don’t want them.”
“Vivian Wilcom, inventor extraordinaire!” the red-haired girl grins back and Draco crosses his arms, glaring at the group as a whole.
“This ferret…” Krum says as Potter attempts to sort out Draco’s long, wiggly body without dropping him, “There is magic on it.”
It took no one any time at all to translate it all into “I hate this,” “I hate that,” “I hate that I’m not getting my way.”
“Dude… Not since I was ten…” Max says blandly and Draco feels his cheeks pink in slight embarrassment. “And like I said, they wanted me educated, but they also take me and Eric to all kinds of other services all the time so we know all of our options. Just last week we went to a Jewish service with one of Mama’s friends! They talk funny, but I like them a lot.”
“Will do,” Eric laughs, “Night, Draco.”
Draco and Eve blink at one another, startled, but then urgently turn to the potion.
“Why do you know all this?” Eve questions and Draco looks down his nose at her, not moving from his position.
Draco’s head tilts, smirk fading to a neutral expression, “Why, I’d even say you owe Sirius Black an apology. Wouldn’t you agree?”
“I didn’t sign up for it,” Potter grumbles, everything now in his bag, and he crouches beside the radio to make sure he’s heard.
Draco half expects the lift doors to open up to chaos, his fur standing on end as they come to a stop, but the moment doesn’t come. The doors open and everything is silent, Draco stepping out on quiet paws, listening intently as he moves. Nothing. He hears absolutely nothing.
“My, uh… favorite color is blue,” Potter suddenly mumbles out of nowhere and Draco looks at him with furrowed brows, like he must have lost his mind.
Draco remembers a distant memory of his father talking about people not being devoted enough to get better standings in society, of lacking a drive and wanting the government to pamper them. He doesn’t know why he remembers it, since it obviously doesn’t apply here. Draco has met Max’s parents, has even spoken to them a few times over this very radio, and he knows for a fact that they are very driven. Stubborn, even, and would deny any kind of pity.
He transforms with little to no issue nowadays, the shift in his senses no longer a concern, and he clambers down the tree and hurries off in the direction of the sighted leathery wings.
by S. E. Hinton,
Draco, not one to be left out of the fun, proceeds to dance with as many people that will have him. Mostly it’s the Slytherin girls that accept, twirling around with the resident “bad boy” for a bit of fun, but he also gets the opportunity to dance with Granger when Krum goes to fetch them drinks
Even so, they’d been dragged to their library table whenever they had too long of a break to get in on the studying. They were a mess, and they certainly complained, but they both sat through it anyway. And, Draco would like to mention, he was pretty sure Harry was getting better and better while working on flashcards while Weasley flourished going over the charts and visual notes.
This time Draco does look back, his brows furrowed in concern. He’d known about “daymares” from his Muggle family, but only a little bit. He’d experienced a few himself, as had Max, but he’d never known they were so prevalent in Eric.
That wasn’t Draco…

“Me? Oh, well, Nevill and I made a Fertilizer Charm last year?” Leandra shrugs. “It gives soil just a tiny bit more nutrients than it had before. It’s… not that impressive… But it’s a nice boost for personal gardens.”
“They kind of feel like a play,” Granger says, writing down their next proposed fight. She sits near the chalkboard, writing on a parchment, while Weasley plots out the “fight” like it’s a Quidditch play on the chalkboard.
Such things were honest concerns for the officials, Lucius had told Draco that in the past, so what could Jorkins have known? He recalled it had been Ludo Bagman’s department… Department of Magical Games and Sports.
“You have my sympathies,” Draco bows his head, smirking a little bigger, and he hears Skeeter grumble something nasty but doesn’t quite catch the words.
“Turns out I have epilepsy, who knew? I even got a vest made,” Draco smirks and Sirius looks at him, displeased.
“This perfidious behavior towards my sesquipedalian capabilities is atrocious,” he says, purposefully pulling out some of the largest words he could think of, properly making Crabbe and Goyle gawk while Theodore groans and Blaise just turns away.
“So all of this is just a bunch of assumptions and guesses on our part with next to no evidence to back anything up,” Hermione sighs, laying her head in one of her hands, disappointed.
For muggleborns, they wouldn’t have that. They wouldn’t have the magical upbringing that explained all the things they could do and all the things they could feel. The spells they learned were in books - official and straightforward - while inventing a spell likely seemed like a great endeavor.
“Smelled like dog?”
So Draco has to wait and hope that the stress would eventually begin to unravel their culprit before the final task.
“It’s not fair,” Draco whispers, looking down. There’s no real energy to his voice. He feels like he’s been pulled in too many directions in just the last few minutes.
Down the hall, in the general direction of Snape’s office, walks a familiar, downtrodden figure. Harry Potter looks like he’d seen a ghost, and not the good kind around the castle. His feet drag as he walks, eyes distant, and head hanging low. Draco’s chest seizes up, worry drowning out his other senses, and he shifts as if to go to him but freezes when he remembers he has an audience.
“Where are these forces of which you speak, hm?” Umbridge continues, prowling forward as her lips pull back in a twitchy sneer. “These… furious underlings that outnumber us. Where are they? Is that what Dumbledore has been doing? Trying to start some kind of… lowblood, ill-bred revolt against the Ministry?”
Allowing him to have his own broom just because he’d caught a stupid Remembrall? What a joke. And now he was apparently the world’s best Seeker or some garbage because he’d nearly choked on the stupid Snitch on his stupid first match.
When Draco had walked up a moment later, Potter was holding two cupcakes in his hands, one with a prominent bite mark in it. “They said…” Granger began, finding her voice first, “that cupcakes always made them feel better…”
There are a few more knick-knacks and toys, like a Rubik’s cube, a bouncy ball, something called an etch a sketch, another weird thing called a GameBoy, and, finally, at the bottom of the box, is a beanie baby snow leopard.
In the end, and Draco really isn’t that surprised, he ends up standing in the entrance to Harry Potter’s compartment. Granger and Weasley have already rejoined their friend, but Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, and a strange-looking girl Draco does not know, with a spacy-er gaze than Tracey’s, are also there.
“You may want to ask why you’re so offended, Nott. Is it because you honestly believe I am lying? Or because you know, deep down, that it is the truth?”
“It is the offensive variant of the Patronus Charm,” Granger speaks up, finding her voice now that Draco has gotten the ball rolling. “It is the physical manifestation of our survival instinct.”
“Is Max short for… Maxine or Maxwell, is kind of what I’m asking.”
“She’s… mentioned something like that,” Draco’s eyes narrow, “But I didn’t know exactly what she was offering.” He still remembered Sinistra’s comments to him after their first class, but he hadn’t brought it up to anyone. It hadn’t seemed all that important.
“Come on, come on, come on! I’ll get Papa to pay for something for us both,” Max grins excitedly, but Draco, as much as he likes being given things, suddenly feels disconcerted. It felt wrong to go shopping around in a gift shop after all of the devastating things he’d just learned. It felt wrong for the museum to have a gift shop at all.
Draco doesn’t know how long they sway, but eventually even the noises from the Yule Ball end, every student off to bed. Except for them.
“Plus, plus, plus!” Max suddenly springs forward, eyes sparkling with excitement as they remember something important. Draco takes a cautious step away, uncertain of the young Muggle’s enthusiasm. “Papa told me this, too, and I remembered that the astronauts put these mirror do-hickeys up on the moon so when you shine a laser at them they’ll bounce back at you!”
~ ~ ~
“How’d you approach Harry?”
Well, Draco would just say he was thankful the other Slytherins didn’t say anything as they returned to Hogwarts and he abruptly disappeared.
Harry shoots after it, looking like he was meant to be in the air, his robes whipping behind him like bird wings, his arm outstretched. Draco can only watch in amazement as Harry effortlessly snatches the Remembrall right out of the air, spinning around and whooping in excitement. Draco is quick to join him, cheering at the catch, still flying through the air, but then Harry looks back and halts. Draco, immediately nervous, looks back as well and sees nothing. Nothing to worry about at all…
And he certainly would have stuck his nose up at the lesser families. At first, he does that anyway, especially while conversing with the high society folk, but his parents aren’t the only ones that gave him a mission.
“Max is Max.”
With a single nod Blaise points Draco’s attention to a far corner of the infirmary. Laying in the farthest bed, separate from the rest of them, lays Sophie, tucked tight under the covers. Her eyes are shut and she looks at peace, but that could mean anything.
“Hey! Dalton had it coming!” Max replies, but then begins to hum in consideration. Draco arches a brow at their behavior, waiting for them to say what they’re thinking. “Alright, I see your point. Maybe I should start studying for my SATs and ACTs, too!” Draco doesn’t know what the ACTs are. Maybe they’re NEWT equivalents? “Gimme a sec! I’ll go get my school notes!”
“You don’t have to go through with it,” Max’s mother spoke softly, “Your life is yours alone, and your parents will simply have to accept this.”
A few of the students clap his shoulder as he passes, but it feels particularly reserved. Mostly he gets nods and very professional sounding greetings. Millicent is looking at him oddly, but she does offer him a nod as he sits across from her.
Up until this particular night, the absolute most shocking development for the lessons was Neville Longbottom becoming the star pupil. He was still a mess and a dork, but he took to wandless magic better than any of them.
“Stop spying!”
Draco arches a brow, glancing at the record curiously. He hadn’t really thought about the majority of his Muggle music being American. He was aware of it, sure, but he’d never really cared. He’d been more interested in the sound and the vocals and the message. It would be interesting to see what these guys sounded like.
Still, Draco sees the hesitant, angry pinch to Harry’s eyes and he wishes they were in a situation where Draco could ease them.
“That’s what all rich people say,” Max gumbles and Potter chuckles. “Why did you even sign up for this thing if you didn’t want to do it, Harry?”
“That’s a very sweet thing for you to do for Harry,” Max’s mother praises, voice soft, “The people you’re worried about… they’re his parents?”
“There is a Slytherin, however,” Draco looks to Skeeter, “Who is a… third year, now, I believe, named Alexander Walton. He’s pureblood and his family had a blood curse that emerged in him and left him mute.”
“Good morning,” Greg greets, smiling, before hurrying to pile breakfast onto his plate.
” Harry casts and the shadows that emerge from his wand grow, coalesce, and rise.
“Plus, snow leopards are climbers. If he needs to flee out a window he might be able to,” Blaise comments, scratching under his eye and looking bored.
~ ~ ~
“Just a smidge nauseous, Potter, don’t hover,” he groans.
Draco’s eyes narrowed, fingers absently running down Muddy’s smooth body as she coiled up on his chest, right above his scar. Could whatever it was have been brought here to Hogwarts? Draco knew so few locations within the Wizarding World, so he had very little evidence for or against that thought, but…
Eve and her mother had clearly been sitting on the couch, but now both have stood up and are staring at the door. Eve glances back at the two boys, concern on her face, but her mother’s face is set to something hard and furious.
When Draco announces to the whole of the Slytherin common room that he has helped begin a wandless tutoring club, led by Professor Sinistra, most of the students voice honest interest. Hardly any of them share Umbridge’s opinions towards Uagadou, likely because such a school would rarely come up in conversation in their homes or at pureblood parties, and it just strengthens Draco’s certainty that pureblood parents have ruined this generation.
“It’s so small.”
Draco hadn’t thought of that. No one in Slytherin openly talked bad about each other, believing they couldn’t, that it would be betrayal, and the students at the Gryffindor table didn’t bring it up often anymore around Draco and Harry. Hermione, on the other hand, had probably heard, or even witnessed, far worse stories about these people than Draco. Of course she would be worried.
However, their reprieve doesn’t last as footsteps come rushing around the corner and a small gathering of teachers come hurrying towards them. Professor McGonagall is first, her usually stern face wild, and Sinistra and Quirrell follow after.
No more is said, however, and Draco ends up just steaming in his frustration. They watch Professor Lupin and then Professor Snape each slip into the hidden tunnel, but that is about the only exciting thing to happen for a long while. The sun has set by the time Draco deems to speak again.
“I’m being personally attacked by someone who doesn’t even know what I look like,” Potter groans while Draco continues to roll around, laughing. “Oh, would you quit it?!” the Gryffindor snaps, taking one of his books and thwapping it against Draco’s head when he rolls too close.
“Those were some pretty good tryouts,” Pansy agrees, but she seems distant, her smile not entirely there. She is still watching all the Slytherins in the air and Draco rolls his eyes.
“Putting a name to it would make it a lot more official,” Harry mumbles, looking away but resting his head on Draco’s shoulder. “I’m not going to make you do something you really don’t want to… But, I’d really like to tell people we’re dating… All the people we
For a few more minutes they try to focus on moving their feathers, but to little success save for a nudge here or there. The twins make an appearance at one point, not offering to sell them any of their products with Granger glaring murder at them from the corner of her eye, but instead picking fun at their brother, laughing with Potter, and passing Draco a piece of folded up parchment paper.
“What?” Potter asks.
Draco walks by a few Slytherin-filled compartments, but changes his mind quickly after seeing them. Theodore Nott, Gregory Goyle, Vincent Crabbe, and Millicent Bulstrode all sit together and look like the least inviting of all. Draco considers Blaise Zabini’s compartment, but the boy flips him off, so Draco returns the favor and keeps going. He finds Pansy sitting with Sophie Roper, Daphne Greengrass, and Tracey Davis, but Draco really doesn’t want to be in the middle of the self-appointed “gossip hole.”
Draco pushes his way fully into the office, shutting the door behind him, and standing before his Astronomy teacher as confidently as he can. He can’t sit. The chair has a chess set in it made of glass.
Once they are back within the safety of the castle walls, standing off in a quiet corridor, do they speak again.
Thankfully, or not, they soon are clambering up a set of stairs and ducking into an abandoned, dark hallway. All the other halls and rooms in Hogwarts were alight with torchlight, but this hall was dark and lifeless and cold. Colder than the dungeons.
“My Grammy.”
“You make me happy,” Draco tries to insist again, but his voice cracks and Harry is pressing closer. Their foreheads are touching, a constant pressure, and Harry’s breath tickles Draco’s lips.
After an Astronomy class one night, Draco made a point of staying behind. A full moon was coming up soon and he still wasn’t sure if he wanted to start the task of keeping a mandrake leaf in his mouth for a whole month.
“Maybe because… There’s different levels of different?” Draco suggests, head tilting as he considers the idea. Inventions and discoveries came into being due to people who thought differently. Just look at all those inventions he’d seen in the WW2 museum all those years ago! Muggles were different, and they’d managed some remarkable things, but they were also different together.
They waste no time as they shove their way inside, closing the door, then pressing close to the wooden surface to hear who might go by. It was still possible that Peeves would rat them out, but there was no where they could go where that wasn’t the case. Now they just needed to wait and hope.
“You’re purring,” the Boy-Who-Lived whispers. Draco smirks down at him, feeling the rumble throughout his chest and not feeling the need to stop it.
“Probably not the same dog, then.”
The force is so tight and sudden he goes rocketing off the broom and tumbles a few times through the grass. Even when he settles on his back, a leg still up and over his head, the world keeps spinning and he feels a nasty pain in his right shoulder. Groaning he drops his leg, laying in the grass and dirt, trying to get his bearings.
Chapter Song:
“But what if I can’t face my fear?” Longbottom says quickly, looking around at the herd of thestrals nervously. The creatures had finished their meal for some time now and were just lounging around in the grass. To Draco they looked haunting, but peaceful. Misunderstood but beautiful.
Draco reaches out, taking the Muggle’s hand, face set firmly with determination. “My name is Draco Lucius Malfoy.”
To be honest, Draco is surprised Dumbledore even agreed to go along with all this. It was a bit farfetched and seemed a tad disrespectful to the deceased, but Dumbledore was turning out to be a lot craftier than Draco had originally expected.
“American Fizz Wiz,” Granger offers as explanation.
It was a surprisingly emotional farewell from the woman, and she must have sensed that as she quickly squares her shoulders, gives Draco one final pat, then climbs back into her car. Draco, feeling oddly touched, gives her an awkward wave through the window then heads up to the station.
“Oh honestly, Draco, why are
They also served as the perfect path for Draco to use back to Moody’s room.
“I’m not using dark spells,” he says roughly and Draco shuts the book, reaches out, and smacks the other boy’s knee with it. “OW!”
“No clue. Definitely not good, though.”
“We won’t tell anyone,” Harry is quick to say, hand still on Draco’s shoulder, his voice firm. “Won’t we?”
There, on the ceiling, is a door. Like all of the doors in the Department of Mysteries it is mostly black, making it difficult to spot on the nebular ceiling, but when one knows where to look it becomes a lot easier.
“Nope. Just outsiders,” Draco shrugs.
“Well…” Eve sighs, squinting up at the dark sky, a hand coming up to shield her eyes against the light raindrops. “I hear thunder, but I don’t see lightning.”
“There was a diner just across the way,” Max’s mother offers, releasing Draco’s shoulder, “Why don’t we visit there. Will your parents be alright with this, Draco, or should we stay here?”
“Shut up,” Draco hisses and she only grins bigger.
“I don’t know…” the Gryffindor whispers, “You flinched and I suddenly had to do something, but there isn’t anything I can do, anymore.” Draco feels the other’s fingers curl into fists against his stomach. The pain and shock has finally faded enough that Draco can really look at Harry, process that he’s real and standing right in front of him, and take in just how stunningly beautiful he is.
Just like that, Draco forgets all about his magical blunder and the surrounding strange behavior. The radio was working! It was actually working! Max’s voice was coming in clear as day.
“You either cooperate with me, or the whole world finds out the truth about you,” Draco says, tapping a finger on his camera, “You lose your job, your credibility, your life. You may even get a nice little trip to Azkaban if I word my claim just right.”
“I mean… nothing feels different now that Harry kissed me.”
“No,” is what he mumbles, but McGonagall sees right through him.
“What?!” he finally snaps, taking his eyes off his stupid textbook to glare at the radio, “What would you like me to say? He’s a bumbling buffoon that gets along better with the worms in his garden than he does with people.”
“I wasn’t even intending to read it, love,” Eve says softly, turning back to her girlfriend. “It really was just laying open and I glanced over. That’s all it was.”
Everything is so… alien. Metal birds, grainy pictures that won’t move, plastic mannequins dressed in drab colors and holding huge wands made of metal. Draco stares in awe around him as people mill about. They leave him be, assuming he’s just someone there to enjoy the museum, and Draco idly begins to wander.
(Which I literally just made and have done NOTHING on...) I am most ofter on Tumblr.
It’s nice - it’s always nice - and some of the stress rolls off Draco’s back as he lays in the grass. Even when they bid Max good-bye and Harry moves to lay beside him, both staring at the stars, the worries don’t come flooding back in. It is all much-needed and much-appreciated.
“What could you have possibly done, mate?” Weasley reasons, his brows pinched and concerned. “There were Aurors there and everything. And the toad snuck up on us. We did all that we could.”
“Did we just blow your mind?” Draco smirks.
“Sure?”
“Harry, hold up,” he calls, catching up when his friend slows and looks back at him. Harry looks tired, more tired than he’d looked before, and Draco grabs his elbow to make sure he doesn’t run off. “You okay?”
He shuts the trunk and eyes the locks in confusion. He raises his wand and unlocks the second lock, the trunk opening once more with little issue. Inside is a bunch of junk. Sneakoscopes, quills, parchment, and--
Draco hides a smile as he shifts around and moves to approach the sullen Gryffindor, footsteps echoing through the quiet, stone corridor. Harry doesn’t even realize someone has approached him until Draco is right in front of him and laying a hand on his arm. The Gryffindor stiffens, then looks up at Draco with wide, lost eyes.
Left alone, Draco leans against the corridor wall, watching the full moon through the window, and waits. The sands fall one by one within the Time-Turner until finally it stops. The allotted time has run out and now it is ready to be used again.
“I’m sorry,” he throws in, shaking his head. “I never even noticed, and when I realized no one knew where the Galleon was I didn’t even try to investigate. I brushed it off like it was nothing. I never do that…”
“You get too anxious and jump the gun,” Draco waves him off, trying to look around a corner. They were almost to the elevators. They’d had to take the scenic route to avoid notice. “Any idiot with eyes could see that.”
Draco was confused by this, so he clambers back down the cabinet and hurries back towards Mr. Davis’s desk.
It was by far the most amazing thing Draco had ever witnessed when he saw Ginny Weasley punch Rodrick Bartholemew, a Ravenclaw sixth year, in the mouth for calling Crabbe and Goyle “the retarded gargoyles left to rot under the castle.” The two wizards - who made Ginny look miniscule and could have taken care of themselves - had hardly left her side for a week after that.
Draco tries to pay attention, he really does, but by that point he is swaying on his feet and fading in and out of awareness. He thinks he hears Umbridge demanding some kind of potion from Snape, something to help her “sort out the liars,” but she never calls it by name and Snape is being snappish and unhelpful.
and sets it in his lap, Potter curiously trying to get a peek at the title before Draco opens it. “This is a dark arts book,” he says calmly and Potter stiffens. Draco could laugh. This boy was such a goody-goody it was pathetic.
“Clearly, Crabbe hesitated,” Draco finally speaks up, attempting to calm everyone down long enough for one of the professors to get here and step in. Unfortunately, this just incentivizes them instead.
Potter gives a wet, weak chuckle, before curling back into Draco, resting his head on the blonde’s shoulder and sagging. It isn’t as desperate a motion as it was a moment ago, Draco’s hold still firm, but relaxing.
Draco swallows and glances back at the now-covered body. He’d been running through scenarios in his head, over and over again, waiting for Eve and Dumbledore to arrive, and none of them had given him the answers he wanted. “I don’t like Moody,” he admits finally, “Haven’t this whole year, and I’d really love to point my finger at him and say he’s the murderer…”
“Good eye, Tracey!” Hagrid booms proudly, smiling big and broad as he faces the students fully. There’s an uneasy murmur through the crowd at this, but Hagrid doesn’t let it deter him. “Magnificent creatures, thestrals. Hogwarts has got a whole herd o’ ‘em—”
“Harry…”
“Heeeeey, Dray-meister!” Max’s excited call comes through once the radio has connected. Draco takes a moment to scowl at the name but knows better than to demand Max stop. They’d only just start coming up with worse…
“You sound like Sirius.”
The older boy looks at him strangely, lips twisting like he thinks the question is insane, but he at least answers. “I’m listening to music… It’s a CD player… How do you
Sinistra raises a hand towards Draco, palm up, like she’s offering something. “Thus, logically, it is within my bounds to offer any kind of information to… help,” she says, then lowers her hand as Draco turns fully back to her, surprised but incredibly pleased.
He’d hidden away in a compartment in the back, getting plenty of strange looks from more familiar faces as he passed, and met a girl with short, black hair styled into sweeping, fashionable spikes, blue eyes, and already sporting her Slytherin robes.
“Same with Max.”
“You did
upset Dobby was free, however. His only ally when it came to Max. But Dobby made a promise that the house elf named Tana, also within Malfoy service, would be happy to help Draco with any deliveries or packages.
He sighs, resigning himself to his fate. He doubted he’d be able to go back to sleep, despite how much he wishes he could, and instead stares up at the ceiling. There is the sound of shuffling footsteps to his right somewhere, but he assumes that it is just Madam Pomfrey doing her job. Maybe he could convince her for another Calming Draught.
has the Galleon?!” Weasley near shrieks, quickly jumping to conclusions and settling on the worst case.
“Oh, I do, it’s just old and used to be my brother’s.”
Max is silent for a moment and Draco wonders, momentarily, if he’s snapped too hard at them. Their voice filters through a second later, however, and it sounds faint with wonder. “The meaning of life is to answer the question, ‘what is the meaning of life?’ Damn, Draco, that’s deep. Who knew you had it in you!”
“Okay…” Draco finally whispers, nodding against Harry’s head, “Let me give it a shot…”
“How many times are you going to do that?” the blonde questions, referring to Harry’s apparent talent to sneak up on him.
Harry’s gaze flicks to him in awe and some apprehension, but Hermione is already talking. “Of course! Come on, let’s compare schedules.” They are both forced to hurry after the witch when she spins around and marches towards the Great Hall like lightning, but when they pass through the doors Harry freezes. Draco makes it a few more steps in before looking back in confusion. The boy was bug-eyed again.
“Dude…” Max begins slowly, “I’m a quarter Choctaw on my Mama’s side. My Ipokni could speak fluent Choctaw and everything.”
Well, it seemed his bushy-headed friend had made a bit of a name for herself.
“I bet you’d be, like, a Pomeranian or something,” Eve says, looking at Hermione and smirking at the girl’s affronted expression.
Still, he moans and groans, all with the backdrop of distant, echoing spells and screams.
damn it, I can’t just lose you like that!”
“Someone should really put you down, kitten,” Bellatrix coos and Draco has a second to think how cliche the comment sounds before she’s ripping her knife from his shoulder.
He didn’t even feel angry when he’d found out his father had been sacked from his place as school governor. If anything, he felt a disturbing sense of satisfaction. Disturbing because he had never felt happy for his own father’s plights.
Damn it all, being aware of his family’s flaws in tradition was making his life a hassle, because Slytherin’s traditions were essentially the same. He couldn’t escape the reality that he was living in a very damaged system, and he had been an active member in the corrupting.
A few more moments pass, Draco moving to stands with Hermione and Neville, the latter keeping right in the center of the tower and away from the edge, and they quietly watch everyone around them. Draco recognizes the Patil twins talking together, Lavender standing nearby, and Greg and Vincent keep moving between looking over the edge and asking Neville if he wants to join them. It seems after their first introductions at the Hogwarts Express the two, large wizards had taken a particular liking to Neville and Hermione, but seem particularly fond of the boy. Draco suspects it is because they share a dorm. That or they want to protect the chubby, cowardly boy. Draco wouldn’t be surprised.
“She frightens me,” Goyle mumbles as everyone slowly goes back to their previous discussions.
Ever since receiving the family heirloom, Leandra hardly ever set the book down, constantly trying to “solve its puzzles,” whatever that meant.
“No! Do not ask me that! You are not allowed to ask me that!” Max had yelled, Draco lounging in the Astronomy Tower at the time, sorting through files for his Triwizard Tournament investigation.
Then Max is groaning over the connection, sounding exhausted and agitated, before they’re saying, “Oh my god, you two are
“Nobody does…”
Sitting back down Mrs Nubble takes a deep breath and turns to Draco, holding the letter tightly. “I don’t like this,” she begins, because of course she doesn’t, “but it is quite clear these were never a scam, and I apologize.” Draco’s brows rise in disbelief and judging by the way Mrs Nubble looks over his shoulder and frowns the others are also wearing matching expressions. “Just because I do not need to apologize often does not mean I am incapable of it,” she says, a warning in her tone, and Draco thins his lips to keep from making a comment.
“Hello, Draco,” Duke greets with a nod, before looking back down at Ms. Hushburn. The woman is miniscule next to this man, but with the way her face is set Draco feels significantly more terrified of her than him. “I apologize again, ma’am, but I came to speak with Mr. Malfoy. Would it be alright if I came in?”
“As has been established,” Vivian hums sarcastically, still fiddling with the gadget. She didn’t look to be really doing anything at this point, just poking and proding.
And then both figures are reaching out. Slow and perfectly in sync they extend their arms, pressing their fingers to the heads of Draco’s Patronus and Militus… and in puffs of smoke and light both charms disappear.
“Okay. You weren’t scared. But I want you to know that if you ever are, it is okay,” Max’s mother squeezes his hand, then let’s go. “And it is okay to talk about it. Fear is not something to be ashamed of. It is completely natural and burying it inside us can only lead to problems down the road.”
Leandra had stopped Potter at one point in the corridors, no one sure how she would feel over her housemate’s death, but she had smiled gently and offered a single, bright yellow daffodil to Potter. She’d then given him a peck on the cheek and walked away, no further words needed.
“It feels nice,” she repeats, face blank, which is terrifying.
“Yes,” McGonagall replies simply, which gives Draco pause, and she looks at him meaningfully. “I did, as did many others, but it was not my say that decided things.” Reaching out McGonagall lays one of her thin hands on the young wizard’s shoulder, squeezing just the slightest bit. She looks sad. “I am sorry. For everything that has happened to you and everything you have yet to discover.”
“So competitive,” Draco stage sighs, shaking his head and shrugging, making Ron glare at him next.
“That’s right,” he agrees, but his shoulders sag as he admits, “Of course, it could mean nothing. We may just want a cool mystery to solve and are just putting meaning where there is none.”
Draco glances worriedly up at the three surrounding the bed, his expression clear even in this form, before he’s focused again on Potter.
“Dumbledore is a brilliant wizard!” Harry suddenly cuts in, looking over at Gemma like he’s been insulted personally. “A genius, even!”
“I’m sorry, Professor, what was that?”
“And that’s another thing!” Theodore shrieks, scrambling to stand and glaring viciously down at Draco. “You gave it my brand new shoes to play with!”
” he attempts and, for a moment, it appears to begin working. The stone wall where he points his wand begins to break apart, but halfway through it simply stops.
“Fate, in any form, isn’t real,” Max says, their own tone of voice more animated - but it always is - but significantly more subdued than before.
“Do you… like Star Wars?”
It was beginning to make more and more sense why Potter and his friends kept getting left out of the loop. Now, all he had to know was what the prophecy said…
“I hate being left in the dark. I hate not knowing what’s going on. I hate feeling like…” Potter pauses, chewing on his lip, before glancing at Draco like he must understand. “Like I’m not part of this, too. Have they told you anything?”
(See the end of the chapter for
But they couldn’t linger. They had their distraction and they needed to go. So, he hurries forward towards Tracey, pawing at her arm until she looks up. He then makes pointed motions at the closest door they could get to and she nods, understanding, and hooks her arms under Weasley’s armpits.
“Do tell.”
Draco never got involved, though. He kept his head high, even through the ridicule, and instead enjoyed getting to finally walk the halls of Hogwarts with Harry, Hermione, and Weasley. Other friends joined them too, but the four of them, specifically, felt special.
“M-Malfoy…?” Potter croaks, noticing Sirius’s split attention and looking over. Potter cringes and scrubs at his eyes, even though they’re dry, like Draco would care if he were crying or not. After all this time, fighting or not, Draco would never judge Potter over that, so he quietly watches, shocked himself, and unable to come up with any kind of response.
Without a word Draco turns away, heading for the door, but pauses when he grabs the handle. He looks back, hesitates, then says meaningfully, “You know, the boggart was right…” Lupin’s expression turns concerned and curious, his head tilting as he waits for Draco to continue. “You really are a mess…”
“We can use those…” Draco says slowly, bringing a hand up to his chin in consideration. The Death Eaters wouldn’t know how to tell the records apart, after all.
“We came close…” For a moment the argument that had gone too far floats back into Draco’s mind. He remembers all the cruel things he and the ginger had thrown at each other, for once actually feeling every blow, and he feels himself grow cold when he remembers
“Harry, no,” Granger says, shaking her head and moving as if she wants to come sit with her friend. “This isn’t your fault.”
Max is never upset, they actually call it sweet, and usually are fine with picking up right where they left off the next time they can speak again.
“Hey, Draco? Do you think I’m weird?” Max’s voice filters through the radio, sounding quieter than usual.
“Maybe it reminded you of my father.”
Hagrid shakes with laughter. “Bit o’ an inside joke fer the faculty, yeh see. We reckon Professor Sinistra’ll be the firs’ witch on the moon jus’ outta stubbornness.”
“Krum, would you like to see my favorite spell out of those books?” the blonde looks to the Durmstrang student with an overly cheerful smile.
“Over a barrel even, right Fred?” says George.
But to actually have this card in his hand… He’d never considered what it might feel like, or how
“You are welcome, Draco,” Tracey says, then he feels her balance yet another pamphlet on his back, “Now please stop breathing. You are shaking the pamphlets.”
~ ~ ~
Then the man is sitting back down, still smiling brightly, and the hall begins to clap and cheer. Draco, however, doesn’t, his brows raised. He glances across the hall and catches Hermione’s eye, her own expression equally surprised, but then she shakes her head and gives a helpless shrug.
That hundred you’re losing doesn’t even make a dent in what you already have, but what about the people that have nothing? Huh?! What about them?! That hundred is all they’re getting, and they use it to
“--were offered positions by Professor Sinistra. Apparently we really impressed her.”
There are no nifty items within this compartment, however, as Draco leans over to look inside. Ten feet down, the compartment goes, made of sheer walls no one could ever climb, a cool draft coming up to whip at Draco’s hair.
Draco sat in his living room sofa, packed between Mr and Mrs Nubble as they stared down the seemingly crazy woman in the opposite recliner. He was aware of Ada and Frederick hiding somewhere around the corner in the hall, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. He was too wrapped up in his own head to care about anything but himself.
“No, Elizabeth Thomas, the 18th century poet,” Draco drawls sarcastically and Potter shoots him a weak glare.
“Yes. Undersecretary Umbridge was at her Ministry office a few days ago and called me up for tea,” Lucius begins, pristinely cutting into a finely seasoned roast on his plate.
“And now you have. Why are you still here?”
“What do you want us to do?” George questions, brows furrowed, as Fred picks up both folders and opens Moody’s. Draco had done a great job putting together only the important parts for the twins, Moody’s original file even thicker than Barty Crouch Sr.’s.
Draco has no idea how much longer they’ll get this with the Ministry trying to solve where Potter’s Trace reading has gone, but he’s going to milk it for what it’s worth.
“I wouldn’t mind being an animal,” Potter says, sounding a little dreamy. “Anything, really, I don’t think I’d care.”
Draco hesitates, thinking over his answer. He knew what his dark arts book had called it, but he wasn’t so sure anymore. “A witch or wizard’s… warrior spirit?” Draco tries, offering an anxious smile to his professor, who looks at him quietly.
“From a mutual friend?” Potter says, opening the bag immediately.
Nothing more, nothing less, and it always has been this way.”
He stares in awe, shocked that the Muggles have found a way to communicate like this without the use of magic. In the Wizarding World, if someone wishes to speak to someone immediately, they have to use a floo, and those are sedentary installations in one’s home. Other than some form of charmed communication, which usually was quite limited, witches and wizards had nothing like this Muggle radio.
joined Draco and Narcissa for dinner two nights after Christmas day and Draco had become hyperaware of every word that he spoke in front of his father. He’d put on his pureblood mask, discreetly swept his hair into something more “appropriate,” and donned some of his finest robes.
“Your room is a travesty, I see,” he says, head held high as he sneers at everything. He at least pauses to give Hedwig a scratch on the chest, the owl fluffing up in appreciation. It is a little odd, though. As clean and organized as Draco had learned Potter could be, his room didn’t feel that way at all. It just felt barren.
“Why?” Draco asks. That was his favorite question, but his parents didn’t like him asking it very often, so he tried to keep them to a minimum.
“Okay,” Sinistra turns fully to Draco, blinking slowly, and folds her hands in front of her starry robes.
“Eagle 1 to Little Ghost, Eagle 1 to Little Ghost, do you read me?” Max’s father speaks to his own device and, to Draco’s amazement, his voice comes out of the device in Draco’s own hands.
“How do you even know about them?” Harry asks, looking to Eve in confusion.
“How long have you even been down here?” Weasley asks, looking bewildered. The two wizards must look a mess with their soaked robes and wind-thrown hair.
“Yes, because you’ve surely done this before,” Draco drawls with a roll of his eyes, “Just stick to the walls and shadows. Appear unassuming.”
The article is written by Skeeter, who looks giddy when told the plan. It didn’t matter about the outcome to her, she was just excited to get such a massive scoop. She begins writing the article before Barty Crouch’s body can be moved where they want it, then finishes it after Madam Rosmerta “discovers” him. Skeeter, true to her word and Draco’s threats, lets Dumbledore go over her writings first before she goes off to get it all printed.
ing,” Harry quietly groans at the pun while Lily looks especially proud of herself, “the mind. Why, I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death! It will take work - hard work - but it can be done.”
“They never did tell us what had gone down with him,” Draco observes, glancing around and wondering what that could mean. “The illustrious Barty Crouch is also missing,” he notices with an arched brow, quickly spotting the absence.
But it was still a dragon and Draco was having a tough time looking past that.
Still, to Draco’s knowledge, Umbridge was still clueless. He still had tea with her regularly and she was currently none-the-wiser.
Potter doesn’t say a word. He just keeps his head down, hands curled tightly around his mug, his body clearly shaking.
Well, Potter looks distinctly displeased, glaring at a spot on the floor. Draco doubts the plant talk is what has set him off, so he can only assume it was talk about summer break. Draco knew next to nothing about how the remainder of the break had gone for the other boy, after all, beyond a few passing words from the Weasley twins, and even then it hadn’t sounded great.
Then, one night, everything changes.
“I never believed you were,” Draco growls, “Now, do you understand what I am asking you or not?”
Draco spots the Gryffindor first years after a few seconds of searching. There’s a color-changing sign above their heads that reads “Lions Eat Snakes” with a drawing of a lion head biting a cartoony snake. Draco wonders if Hermione threw a fit over that, especially considering real lions didn’t actually eat snakes.
“Y-yeah… she teaches potions,” he whispers quietly, looking a little embarrassed.
“We still need to investigate, Minister. We have no idea who could have done this to Arthur,” the Auror replies firmly, their posture stiff like a soldier.
For a moment Ron and Hermione bicker about who gets to sit in the front. Hermione wins, of course, and Draco shoots the redhead an amused but reserved smile. “I could have warned you that would happen.”
Still, Draco offers an answer. “Because, to them, you are the enemy set out to disrupt their ideals. Dumbledore’s puppet, but they can’t keep track of Dumbledore like they can you.”
The other boy’s brows rise then he pouts. “I don’t do it on purpose,” he mumbles and Draco rolls his eyes.
But, as the term goes on, Draco begins to wonder if Granger was right. Edgecombe is definitely twitchier and more anxious, but she doesn’t make any move. Perhaps she had simply been further spooked of negative circumstances to her actions while visiting family. Perhaps she simply needed to move past it.
“That’s a word for it.”
“Obviously,” the woman huffs, readjusting her alligator skin bag. “You know me so well, little Draco. I must be off, now, you know how it is. Consider what I said about that potion, while I’m away.”
“We’re in a hall filled with beasts we’ll likely never see again. Sorry to sound like Hagrid, but what did you expect me to do?” Weasley snaps back. They’ve both managed to get to their feet by now and are struggling to continue down the hall, tracking water everywhere.
Draco can’t tell if his cousin is breathing from here, but he doesn’t get the chance to check as a wind begins to swell through the room. Draco thinks that this is pretty strange, glancing around the room, but then the wind is picking up, faster and faster, tearing at everyone’s cloaks and hair until it begins to hurt. It’s like a twister, and its epicenter is the arch.
“He’s just enjoying pointing out all our mistakes,” Potter says, glancing at his best friend before looking back at Draco with an unimpressed look, “As usual.”
“Your hair is purple.”
They enter the girl’s fourth year dorm, despite Eve being a fifth year, and Draco is standing in their bathroom when he hears a chorus of, “Granger’s here!” He pokes his head out to look, curious at the reactions. Millicent is the only one that seems exceptionally unhappy at a muggleborn Gryffindor being let into their room, glowering from a corner. Pansy is sure to be particularly passive aggressive, but is currently behaving herself. Sophie, Daphne, and Tracey, however, are circling Granger and pushing her to a stool.
“Sir Alexander Fleming was still a scientist beforehand,” Draco deadpans, pointing directly to the line detailing penicillin’s founder, but Max ignores him.
They don’t say anything until they have all showered, changed, and are putting all their things away. They’re all facing their lockers when Crabbe says, “It really was Montague who told me to do it… I wasn’t sure if I should, so it took me a while.”
books, then he would help with going over the theory. Otherwise, it was just a nice way to catch up on what was going on in “Gryffindor World.”
Not for the first time, and doubtfully the last, Draco smacks Potter’s hand away from his bag of candy. It has become something of a game, Potter attempting to steal M&M’s while Draco attempts to stop him. They’re at a pretty even match.
“You will simply have to wait, then,” McGonagall says, voice firm and final, and Draco pouts down at his list, forcing himself to continue to read.
It had successfully run Bagman off, which would mean a new judge would temporarily be called in for the final task from the Department of Magical Games and Sports. The last-minute nature of the call would put the task a little behind, but that was exactly what they needed.
It was rare Draco got to hear the full extent of Muggle school workloads.
They head to the market, which Draco grudgingly admits to enjoying himself, even though there aren’t any modern, counter-culture shops like the one in the mall they’d visited the previous day. It is beautiful and charming and not too busy at all. And, admittedly, it helps that it does remind Draco quite a bit of Diagon Alley…
“Uh, because I want to?” Max offers as if it should be the most obvious thing in the world.
jumping into the water.
Draco liked the thestrals, but he’d never thought of where the ones that led the wagons to and from Hogwarts might go when not working. He’d honestly suspected the Forbidden Forest, but he supposes a fresh kill like this would attract them just as well.
“Because it simply cannot,” Hermione says as if she is always right, and she often is, but Draco refuses to give her the satisfaction of admitting such a thing.
“You’d make a good teacher, I think,” Draco says, looking up from where he was skimming through one of the library’s spellbooks. “Professionally, I mean.”
Draco glances over at the other boy. He looks tired from their early morning, his eyelids drooping, but he’s looking intently at the book in Draco’s lap with confusion. “How would you know? You hardly even look in ours.”
“Did you wanna think about that a little longer?” Max deadpans, their tone unimpressed.
“I’m afraid that money won’t help you all that much,” McGonagall cuts in before Draco can ask much else. They are walking down a street labeled Charing Cross Road, passing by people - Muggles - that are giving McGonagall and her robes and hat odd looks. “I will explain when we are off the street, but you have nothing to worry about.”
“Well, sweetie, I am referring to the torture, and following insanity, of Alice and Frank Longbottom.”
“And you don’t want to be held accountable?” Granger questions, sounding a touch suspicious now, and Draco gives her a sour look.
“He said that our family used to support You-Know-Who…”
“You’re insufferable,” he grumbles, but Muddy seems done with him, now, and he lets her slither up his arm and settle around his neck. Honestly, of all the snakes to sneak into his luggage, why did it have to be Muddy? She was sweet, sure, but she had a mind of her own. At least Shadow would just mind his business, and…
And then something is launching through the air.
Then the woman is turning away and heading back to the Head Table. Draco stares after her, along with everyone else at the table, before Sophie Roper, a first year girl with dirty blonde pigtails, stage whispers, “Your mom is really nice.”
Potter looks thoughtful at that, before his expression turns distressed. “I can’t remember the address, either.”
“I’m looking forward to seeing Hedwig again,” Harry says quietly, a small smile on his face. The snowy owl had stayed in the care of Sirius for the majority of the year, but after Sirius had gone to St. Mungo's Molly Weasley had gone to fetch the bird and keep her at the Burrow. She was supposed to be bringing her to the station for Harry to pick back up.
He hated the thought that something so much bigger than them was hurting his friend. He hated the thought that people so drastically misunderstood such an integral part of Max, on such a massive scale, that it was making them miserable. He hated that the world couldn’t understand that people were just born different. Why did it matter that Max wasn’t a boy or a girl? Why was that anyone else’s business?
“They kinda look like chess pieces,” Weasley slurs, then begins to giggle like he’s made some spectacular joke. “Hey. Hey! Chess pieces! Why’d you let us in?!”
Then the girl is standing, gathering up her things, and bustling out the library with a determination to her steps. They watch her go, silent and surprised, until Harry whispers, “What just happened?”
Draco scowls at that and turns away, storming up to his room in search of something to do, leaving his mother alone to get back to her reading.
“Names! I demand names! And addresses! Eric and me’ll catch a flight and he can drive me and then we can handle things!”
“But we may need some added help.”
Draco’s brows shoot up in surprise when he sees that Weasley’s very eyes have changed with the spell, too. The whites of the wizard’s eyes have turned an orangy-red while the entire iris and pupil has fused into a golden disk. It looked very Gryffindor, now that Draco thought about it, but also very freaky.
“Oh, dude, alllllll kinds!”
“We hardly studied at all over the break, Potty, I have no intention of falling behind,” Draco scoffs and looks back to his textbook.
Draco’s mind was reeling. Muggles? Muggleborns? Witchcraft? Wizardry? School? Okay, well, he knew what that last one was, but a school for… for… magic? He suddenly remembers his conversation with Hermione not too long ago on the subject, but… this was not at all what he had in mind.
“Why is that so hard to believe?” he cuts in, “Muggles can’t charm balls to do different things, so they use people instead. Instead of Bludgers, we have defenders. Instead of a race to catch the snitch, it’s a race against the clock.”
Draco and Potter had taken a spot on the grounds, in a particularly sunny spot that made Draco want to take a nap, and had brought out their books to work on homework. The radio had come out soon after when it started to blink with an incoming transmission.
WHAM!
Hey there everyone! Hope you're all well! So, new chapter, showing the beginning of Draco's very interesting summer...
“Miss that man,” Draco hums, then turns on the sink before promptly bending down and sticking his head in the stream of water. He doesn’t think he needs a full shower at the moment, but he does scrub at his hair to rid it of residual smells.
And Harry holds him quietly through it all.
Draco has friends. Max, Eve, occasionally some of the Slytherins in his year, maybe even Granger and Weasley if he’s being generous… but not Potter. No, not Potter.
Which means now he has to wait, standing in front of the office door, wand raised, for the cannon to fire. It will take a while, thanks to all their efforts to stall, but it will come. It will have to, now.
“You call that a sword? Preposterous! I demand a proper blade to match my abilities.”
“Has he asked you to Yule Ball, yet?” Draco questions, pulling out his book.
“You coolio?” George asks with a smirk and Draco snorts, arching his brow at him.
The first of September. It was finally the day. Finally, Draco would get to set off on his magical, school adventure, away from his foster family, all on his own. He would get to learn spells and tricks and all kinds of things one could only dream of.
The day after his trip to Diagon Alley Draco had immediately asked if Hermione could come over and visit. After finishing his chores in record time, the Nubbles had agreed and his only friend had stormed into the house only a few minutes later carrying every book she had gotten on her own trip to Diagon Alley. They settled in the living room, spreading out their books and comparing. Much as McGonagall had suggested extra Transfiguration books to Draco, this Professor Flitwick had suggested extra Charms books to Hermione. Before being interrupted, Draco had been skimming through some of these, trying to swear the words and motions and notes to memory for when he would be allowed to use his wand.
“One of you has to come with us,” he says, head up in faux confidence. “You won’t know if we actually manage to make it unless one of you comes with us.” The trio hesitates and Draco desperately hopes they reconsider. If he could scare them out of this it would be perfect, and then he could tear Harry and Ron a new one.
“You can’t do this to us,” Draco says lowly and from the corner of his eye he spies Eve slipping from her own seat and moving quietly out of the room, giving them their privacy. “We were… fuck, Potter, I was terrified.”
“Yeah, it… it didn’t make sense…” Potter says carefully.
Draco had simply sighed, scrubbed a hand over his face, and walked away.
“Good idea, Fred! We should follow them around. See what they get up to. Find out what secrets lie beneath Quirrel’s turban.”
“You’re doing it again.”
The diner across the street from the WW2 museum is so much brighter than Draco expected a Muggle establishment to be, and the food is positively delicious. He supposes they have a lot to make up for without magic, and whatever they’ve done to do that, they have succeeded.
“Hello!”
Vincent is the one to lean forward, looking excited, and pats at his own chest. “Uh, yeah! So… everyone says you must have a scar, right?” Greg interprets, his own, dark eyes sparkling with poorly hid excitement.
He needed to figure out what was going on without their meddling.
“Yes,” Ms. Hushburn continues, beginning to walk in the direction of the guestroom to get it ready, her daughter right behind her. “Bad time for sex. I am not blind, Evangeline, I was teenager once too.”
Tootsie still flies in, though, and drops off a letter for Hermione, who had been using her to talk to her own family. A few seats down a parcel is dropped in front of Neville by a barn owl and the boy immediately brightens. It is from his parents, he says, and when he pulls out his gift it reveals itself to be a glass ball the size of a large marble with white smoke inside.
“I do,” Eve nods, clambering over the fence and falling with a thud onto the ground on the other side. She groans, taking a moment to gather herself from the tumble, and Draco leans over her to smirk in her line of sight. “Uhg… parkour,” Eve groans weakly, then takes Draco’s offered hand and gets up.
Merlin… Had Draco just seen someone get
Behind her are Weasley and Longbottom, being held and dragged by Verteaux and Goyle respectively. Just beyond them stands Crabbe, Warrington, and Theodore, faces stony. What… What was going on?
~ ~ ~
The blonde boy stiffens, eyes widening as Eric proceeds to tune out the world around him once more. “I did not run away! I told you, my parents are perfectly aware where I am,” he lies.
“Yes. In the end, I know exactly where to go and I can hold majority of the interview, but if we get into trouble I need the person with the most knowledge of the Ministry I can get,” Draco explains evenly, giving Weasley a displeased but resolute look.
“Do you regret it?”
“Oh, I think Harry will hand over that prophecy if he wants his friends to stop hurting, don’t you think?”
“No way, I bet he’d be a Pitbull,” Draco says with a dismissive wave of the hand not currently being pinned under Potter’s weight. The boy has finally given in and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, but is giving a valiant effort to stay awake and listen.
“I fight for myself,” Draco replies after a time, but it doesn’t come out as confident as he would have liked. It nearly sounds like a question, and judging by Sinistra’s extended stare, she likely can sense his uncertainty as well.
Draco’s heart suddenly jumps, speeding up, but he stamps down on that and keeps his voice steady, “Yes…? He does… And? I suppose it does get rather annoying watching Granger constantly trying to get them alone. Painful to watch, really.”
They’d eaten, likely more than necessary, and split up only temporarily to go to their separate dorm rooms to shower and change. Harry, not having to deal with a troublesome stab wound, had finished first and met Draco down in Slytherin, where they’d both promptly fallen asleep.
Which Draco hated, but it was probably their best bet.
“Lucky for you,” Draco snorts, wiggling when Harry jabs a finger into his ribs in retribution.
This must be Terence Davis, Tracey’s father, hard at work.
It sounded dreadful, being surrounded by so many Muggles on a regular basis. Draco supposes they all must be accustomed to it, but he’s glad he doesn’t have to do anything like that. He’d surely catch something dreadful and die on the spot.
Lupin’s werewolf form is on display in each one, sometimes in focus, sometimes half out of frame, sometimes blurry. Lupin stares down at the photos, an unreadable expression on his face. He stops on one that has his full form visible, and in pretty good display, and just stares at it for a while.
“Plus, they’re yappy,” Weasley adds oh-so helpfully, but looks away when Granger turns her glare on him.
“Of course,” Draco assures. He’d prefer that over his godfather. Harry’d learned nothing with the man, but at least with the Slytherins he seemed to understand the theories. He hadn’t managed occlumency yet, no, but he
Max brought out the most intriguing sides of people. They’d done so with Draco, even a little with Harry, and now with Longbottom, too.
So... From here on out the chapters are going to likely be shorter. It'll help my own sanity, but also get them out for y'all a lot faster. This particular one isn't super short, since I wanted to get a lot of the summer arc out of the way and introduce some new characters and themes, but after this it'll likely be much smaller word counts...
Draco hardly says anything before Harry is doing just that. He writes out a quick letter then attaches both that one and the one to James to Hedwig’s leg. He gives her a treat before sending her off and the snowy owl flies up through the tube in their ceiling towards the surface. Draco is too stunned to respond, having not expected Harry to just take action like that. When Harry looks back at him he pouts.
“Harry,” Max replies, mimicking Potter’s tone perfectly. Draco and Potter sit side-by-side on the floor of the tower, the radio in Draco’s lap, with their homework thankfully done and conversation beginning to pitter off.
gone, and they have to function in secret outside of Ministry control. You want to be treated as a part of that, you’re going to have to be a team player.”
“Gentlemen,” Draco greets, eyes thinning suspiciously, before glancing around as if confused. “Strange. I don’t recall saying your name’s three times in a mirror, yet here you bloody are.”
The Gryffindors find great enjoyment out of making Draco agitated, even though he’s the one that saved their golden boy, but eventually the twins do have to leave. They make some over-exaggerated exit, even for them, but it only succeeds in getting their younger brother to roll his eyes and Granger to offer a tense smile. It is then that Draco realizes Potter has been particularly silent.
The students in the compartments they visit all seem confused by the apparent return of the nervous boy, but most seem kind enough. Some get agitated, but most simply shake their heads and wish them good luck.
“Hagrid,” calls Tracey’s floaty voice from somewhere in the back of the group. Draco can see one of her hands sticking up above the other students’ heads. “Are we looking at thestrals?”
Draco doesn’t let go of Harry, but he does stand up straight, his brows rising up in surprise. That was… definitely not where he was expecting this conversation to go, but Harry was a bit of a mess right now, so Draco could work with him.
Max greets him immediately with an off-key rendition of “Happy Birthday,” loud and exactly what would be expected of the Muggle. This is followed by the radio being passed around to Max’s family, who all offer their own birthday wishes before it returns to Max. Draco talks about his day in as much detail as he can, especially focusing on his new “racing bike.” He has learned enough of Muggle culture to know some good substitute terms for his magical experiences.
Except the underside of his bed is clean. The one thing he’d ever ordered the house elves not to do, and they’d done it anyway! It was gone. His radio was gone. His “sat-e-lite,” two-way radio that had apparently cost Max’s father so much money… was gone. Just like that.
Then they spot Granger dancing with Viktor Krum and immediately smirk at each other. Looks like they had been correct.
Draco doesn’t go to classes the following day. He’s positively exhausted and he can’t imagine staying awake through his lessons.
“Now, now, Weasley, I only jest. It would not do to pick a fight in a place like this,” he says with a roll of his eyes. It mollifies Weasley enough he doesn’t look like he wants to castrate Draco, but the boy is still clearly displeased. “Perhaps a peace offering?”
His mother had solved things, however, and told him to head to the festivities early and to enjoy himself. He knew this was stressful for her, teenager or not she still worried he would vanish again one day and not come back, but she had put on a brave face. She claimed she would deal with Lucius, and that was final. Draco didn’t know what she planned to do, but he knew better than to ask.
“Oh, don’t look at me, Potty! This was all Dobby’s brilliant idea!” Draco says brightly, motioning to the little house elf. “Aren’t you grateful?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Oh… Oh! Right, the kiss. Merlin, yes Draco desperately wanted to talk about that, but not now. Not with how upset and out of sorts both of them were. Neither of them were in any condition to be talking about something like that right now.
“Ah, where to begin? My first year was Professor Quirrell, who was dreadfully incompetent. Scared of his own shadow, you see, and could hardly get anything out past his stutter.”
About ten minutes in he sighs, slips on a pair of dragon hide gloves, and frees the last of the Solar Flowers from their bulbs.
They hurry in the direction Luna claims was the Hall of Prophecy. The rooms are like a maze, the way they’re interconnected, and Draco wishes he’d reviewed the layout before coming back. Right now all he knows is the Unhideable Hall is through the Space Room, and apparently the Locked Room connected to the Brain Room. How helpful…
“Hiroshima,” she says, glancing down at Draco. “A dark day in history.”
“N-no, young master! Not at all!”
“Can I drop by your dorms tonight? Maybe get some of your dormmates’ thoughts on how they were taught Occlumency again?” Harry questions, sitting up straighter and looking to Draco without the frustration from a moment ago.
~ ~ ~
The latter was a lot less upsetting to Draco than he thought it should be.
“And you’ll send pictures of you and Eve, right? Mama’s been asking about those.”
Moody, or whoever the hell he really was - and Draco was beginning to think he knew who that may be - had to be regularly making and taking the potion to keep up his disguise. There was just one issue.
Draco shifts into a snow leopard, leaps down, and shifts back into a human to approach the table and look at what Granger is talking about. “Dumbledore’s Army” is written across the top, followed by the signatures of all the members of the DA.
But then, during the school year, they’d all illogically assumed that would end.
“He wants to know if you wanted to come, too,” Weasley says around his own mouthful of biscuit, crumbs flying onto the table when he speaks. Draco glances at him, one brow arched.
It did make him wonder how he’d never noticed Hushburn before now. She didn’t look average, in fact she was quite pretty, especially with her carefully styled hair, yet somehow Draco had missed her. In his own house, no less. Although… that was probably his answer right there.
“Because you aren’t speaking to Potter and it’s very clearly upsetting him,” Draco retorts. He’d learned speaking bluntly with his Headmaster was the best way to get an answer with him. He was a cryptic son of a bitch, and Draco would have none of it.
Harry steps away from the group, towards the open space of the room, and raises up his wand. He doesn’t do anything at first, likely thinking over exactly what context he wants his memory to be in. Draco, Weasley, and Granger wait silently, watching with bated breath as Harry sorts himself out.
“Those are stupid,” Draco says, but it doesn’t seem to bother Max, who just shrugs.
“Harry and me saw them, too,” Ginny says with a groan, rolling her eyes. To Draco’s knowledge Ginny did not know Eve well at all, but if she had been with Potter it wouldn’t be outside the realm of possibilities for him to have sought out a seat with her.
“What are you doing?” the blond asks softly and Harry shakes his head, looking lost as he gently lays his hands on Draco’s stomach instead.
“Well, Dobby, you’ve really outdone yourself,” Draco says, eying an ornament with the Boy-Who-Lived’s face on it.
“I know what I’m doing,” Potter hisses, their voices low but nonetheless vicious.
“I must agree with Granger, Potter,” Draco decides to step in oh-so-helpfully, “Chang was clearly distracted by you.”
Hushburn, then. He certainly hadn’t been expecting anything from her. And, logically, that must mean this was a Muggle book. It made sense. He wondered if Max or Granger had ever read it.
Sitting in the middle of it all is a massive desk, equally covered in piles of papers, and a man with a monocle, ink-stained fingers, and black hair so long it pools on the floor around him, sits behind it. He’s mumbling to himself as he works, fingers skimming over papers at subdued speeds before he writes something down in a notebook, stamps the papers with one of seven stamps, then taps it with his wand and it flies off to its own file somewhere in the cabinets.
“Is that why you didn’t want to wait with me earlier?” Harry questions, one cheek extended from a bite of food in his mouth and a few crumbs falling out. He quickly tries to swallow, though, and offers an apologetic look for his manners.
“This is amazing…” Draco whispers, eyes wide, and Max beside him groans while their father beams.
‘We always watch the humans. Your… ‘house’ is just easiest,’ Augi explains. Before Draco can ask another question, the merman looks behind him, further into the lake, as if he heard something. Draco cannot see any ears on him, though. ‘I am needed,’ Augi signs, looking back at Draco and staring at him for a few beats. Coming to some sort of decision the merman nods once. ‘I will get you help. Goodnight, Draco,’ he says and swims to the right, out of Draco’s view, in one fluid motion.
He plays The Offspring’s new album “Smash” that Eric sent to him for his fourteenth birthday. His mother very clearly does not like it, but she sits through two songs, before taking out her wand.
What had happened? Where had the two figures gone? Where the hell was Potter?!
“One other thing…” Draco says, sheepishly, “Please don’t question where I got some of the more… official-looking documents. It’s best if we just… never mention that.”
A girl with blonde pigtails trips out of the group, her face pink, and she clambers onto the stool. McGonagall holds up the hat for her as she settles then sets it onto her head, the brim falling down over the girl’s eyes. There’s silence, but Draco thinks he sees the hat squirm just a little bit, like it is thinking.
“Win-win.”
“The thing you just said.”
“Rita Skeeter,” he says brightly, startling the woman as he continues to snap photos. Her eyes are saucers behind her bejeweled glasses, a hand flying to her wand as she realizes she has just been caught.
“Uhh… Hello,” Potter says, looking over at Draco like he’s ready to kill him at any second.
Granger nods, not looking pleased but understanding the severity of the situation. “Tomorrow. Room of Requirement. As soon as we’re done with classes,” she says, her tone final, and Draco nods. He’d see them then.
For the rest of the evening Draco carefully weaves his story to fit his father’s expectations, properly putting him in such a good mood he doesn’t even notice the large portion of his specialized, Ministry-appointed floo powder that goes missing at the end of the Christmas Break…
“Properly,” Lily corrects, smacking his stomach.
expect the look to work, but her unimpressed, lifted eyebrow seems rather unnecessary…
~ ~ ~
“Okay!” the blonde is grinning brightly, yet again pulling out his letter. “Last is my wand and an owl. Right?”
Despite a few rebellious actions - like getting an undercut, insinuating he marry a muggleborn, or owning Muggle items - for the most part Draco’s father did not know the extent of his son’s rebellion against pureblood culture. He also did not know of Draco’s “internship” at the Ministry. Draco really had no reason to feel alarmed when he sees Lucius Malfoy in a story about Umbridge, yet the warning bells still go off in his head.
He thinks he hears his mother somewhere behind him, calling out to him, but there’s static in his ears.
“Why do you not suspect Karkaroff anymore?” Potter asks, effectively moving on.
“This place gives me the willies,” Harry says softly to Draco, looking around at the deserted hall. It doesn’t even feel like a ghost would come here.
“Wait, wait, then why are you learning the bones of the body… If you are not required to know them?” Draco questions, eyes narrowing as he looks at the radio.
Lightning breath, storm creation and dissipation, growing and shrinking in size, and the ability to fly without wings. He also explains that Lung Dragons tend to reside in rivers or bodies of water, healing and growing stronger from the natural magics that reside within.
“Which Draco is one of?” Mr Nubble questions, a hand laying on the blonde’s small shoulder. Usually Draco would brush him off, but he’s too preoccupied to care.
“It’s no—Nevermind,” Draco sighs, shifting around in the tub to try and get more comfortable. “I still don’t understand what you are asking. How is ‘fundamentally weird’ any different from your original question?”
The following morning Sirius wishes good-bye to Draco while still at the manor. Draco plans to go on ahead, use the Knight Bus this time, to avoid any suspicions of showing up with Sirius and Potter instead of his parents. It will also give the two plenty of time to be properly sappy as Sirius walks Potter to Platform 9 ¾.
They take their seats after that and the game begins.
Mr. Davis is silent, staring at Draco blankly, before his head tilts to the side. “Magic is full of loopholes. I would not test it, however.”
“Artefacts? Like ancient tablets or ruins or something?” Draco questions, deflecting the conversation so he doesn’t have to introduce himself yet. Maybe if there were less people in here…
They move back over to the couch Draco had previously been on and he relays his short interaction with Augi. Harry becomes a bit more aware as the conversation moves on, and grows serious when Draco admits to his nightmares.
“Very well… It really was a good lesson, Potter,” he says, offering a small smile to the boy, who straightens up at the praise. “Well done.”
“Yeah. Ya did,” Max says brightly, glee in their voice as they add, “I’ll leave you two alone, okay? Night, Harry! Night, Draco!” and then the connection goes silent.
“Just going through the motions, then?” Draco clarifies, watching in interest, and Ron grunts an affirmative.
He never finds out why Potter was so upset. None of them say a single word for the rest of the evening and all Potter does is chew at their licorice wands. His face does keep morphing through a series of complex emotions. Mostly he seems shocked, drawn in and void, but occasionally his eyes scrunch up like he’s fighting tears, or he frowns so deeply in thought it looks like he’ll develop sagging jowls, or his face twists in such vicious, unadulterated
“I’d still feel much better if I had this form to assist in an escape or stealth,” Draco growls, his displeasure outweighing Eve’s reasoning, so she sighs and quits with that.
“Okay, why are you
“I’m alive,” the blonde wheezes and Ron slowly lowers him down until he can be placed on the ground safely. He feels terribly dizzy as he sits up straight, blood rushing back to the rest of his body, and a moment later Hermione is barreling into his side and hugging him.
if you've a ready mind,
“Oh please, go ahead,” Draco says, standing up straight and trying to compose himself. He was great at keeping his cool in lots of situations, so long as he could have a moment later to drop the act and just take a breather. “Tell me how amazing I was.”
“And see who might replace us?” Harry hums, pretending to consider it, “Absolutely!”
“No, no, no, no,” Theodore keeps mumbling under his breath and Draco, scowling viciously, rips out his wand from his sleeve and points it at the lock on the door. The moment he was allowed to start practicing magic he had started testing the spell he’d seen McGonagall use and now seemed like the perfect time to put it into practice.
Still, all wasn’t perfect with the DA either. It was hard to tell, but it seemed like a few students were upset with them, too. Not for defending the Slytherins - people usually backed down in respect when the DA showed up anyway - but something else. No one made a move or said anything, but it was clear people weren’t happy.
The second the door is shut, the room begins to move. The doors twist and turn and jump, the wall disassembling and reassembling in an attempt to disorient them. Draco ducks his head, knowing trying to keep track of anything won’t help them, but he hears some of his friends murmur in shock and confusion.
“I know the Swollen Tongue Hex, you know. How long do you think that leaf would stay in your mouth with a bulbous tongue hanging out?”
“Correct. No new spells, just a new way of casting them,” he says to the room as a whole.
“She is with the Lovegoods for half of her break, then she and Luna will join me for the last half,” Mr. Davis says, slipping his wand back into his sleeve.
“I’m sure you’ll do just fine,” Eve assures her girlfriend, and Draco absently wonders what these two girls did for their Valentine’s Day. Should he have asked? Too late now.
There’s silence for a moment, Harry eying him strangely, until Max is whooping in excitement. “There they are!!” they shriek and now Harry is leaning towards the radio with a furious expression on his face.
“I can’t regret something that wasn’t my fault. I
It’s a few moments later before the wandmaker returns, looking thoughtful as he presents a new wand to Draco. “Try this one,” he says and immediately the blonde is curious. All the others Ollivander had named what the wand had been made of, but not this one.
“You just need to retrace your steps, Max, really,” Harry is trying to calm the Muggle down, looking both concerned and agitated. He and Draco are sitting on the edge of a small clearing they’d found the first time they’d snuck out, thick roots posing as sufficient seats.
Harry Potter is sitting casually on Draco’s bed, like he owns the place, chatting with Blaise, the only other occupant. At Draco’s arrival Harry had hopped off the bed and was looking at Draco in clear shock at his soaked appearance.
The handshake is firm.
Draco really was just happy to see him here and alive.
That’s what Draco hears the next day, along with Umbridge taking over his position. And it isn’t even the only bad news.
she was muggleborn, whom Umbridge would surely be causing troubles for. They had to play things smart.
The boy looks over to him, brows raised in surprise, then lowering as he actually looks at Draco. He seems to be examining him and the blonde stiffens. Madam Malkin hadn’t mentioned anything about him being the Boy-Who-Lived, or whatever, but that could have been because she hadn’t realized or was too professional to care. Then that Arthur man hadn’t noticed who he was because he’d been so wrapped up talking about Muggles. That didn’t mean this other boy would be the same.
The first time he’d noticed Potter’s looks, consciously, had been the night before Easter last school year. Ever since, Draco had kept spotting these moments, these looks, that stunned him, and Potter very rarely had to do anything at all to cause it. It was a little infuriating, if Draco was being honest, yet somehow he never felt angry.
“And now… we wait…” Draco says, Granger sighing beside him as they watch the owl fly into the distance.
“You’ve all done really well today,” Potter is saying at the front of the class. “Keep track of your galleons and be careful on the way back to your houses.”
How is it possible for two people to be so blind?”
Things aren’t fixed or better, but when have they ever been between a Malfoy and a Weasley?
“Or just no clues at all! Trial by fire!” Max says, voice growing louder as they begin to laugh.
Oh, but no, McGonagall was leading him towards the building beside it. Draco hadn’t even noticed it at first, like it hadn’t even been there, and the witch opens the front door. “This is the Leaky Cauldron,” she says as she shoos Draco in, not in any mood to dilly dally.
“Colin may know how to fix it,” Patil says, smiling cheerfully, “Do you want us to ask him to take a look?”
“Draco!” multiple voices call, but Draco’s entire focus is on the troll’s face as he’s suddenly much too close and upside down to it.
“Ah, well…” Ollivander looks up, still thoughtful, but a bit more focused on Draco now. He holds up the box with Draco’s wand in it and arches a brow at it. “Ebony, phoenix tail feather, 10 ½ inches,” he says slowly, then turns his arched brow on Draco. “The phoenix feather core is a rather unique substance. A phoenix will only offer up two of its feathers, you see, and the brother to this wand, the twin, why… its owner is the very one who gave you that scar.” Ollivander motions towards Draco’s chest, and the boy subconsciously pulls up the collar of his shirt, hiding any revealed edges of his scar.
“I required a moment of your time,” Draco replies. Lupin had been his favorite teacher the whole year, nay, the whole time he’d been at Hogwarts, and it felt wrong to allow him to go without saying anything. They never had spoken much outside of class, save for that one time after the boggart, and now Draco wishes he had. He would have loved to pick apart the man’s brain.
Draco takes a moment to look down at himself. He was wearing a black turtleneck and some comfortable jeans and green “Chuck Taylor” shoes sent to him from his Muggle family over the holidays. He’d considered wearing the Weasley jumper, but he knew he couldn’t be seen around the castle with that.
“I suggested we get Colin Creevey,” Granger explains, which is precisely who would make more sense than Draco, “But I recalled magical photography can occasionally be tampered with by unique spells, which we do not know, but Fudge does not currently trust us and would surely use it against us.” Fudge? As in the Minister?!
Two days before the final DA meeting of the year, just before the Christmas Break, Draco and the Golden Trio find themselves in the Room of Requirement’s meeting room. The faux windows show an autumn scene of a forest of aspen trees, their leaves fiery oranges, yellows, and reds.
“Right, of course. You don’t want anything to do with your own house, do you? You only want to be around those Gryffindorks,” Millicent huffs, flicking her hair back in a seemingly haughty motion, but she’s about as elegant as a troll so the effect is lost.
He continued his research on prophecies whenever he could. He hadn’t told Harry about what he’d discovered just yet. The boy needed a breather and having yet another thing to worry about right before sending him off to the Order? He just couldn’t do that. Draco felt a little sneaky about it all, but it didn’t deter him. He was a sneaky guy, wasn’t he?
“And of course, Moody, or the imposter, was completely mad.”
Lucius takes a deep breath, like he’s holding onto this moment. “I am very happy to hear this, Draco,” he says, looking back to his son with a shine to his eyes. “You make this family proud.”
Glancing around it appears most everyone is still focused on the ghosts. The earlier argument hadn’t drawn too much attention, thankfully, and now everyone was distracted, also thankfully. Draco runs a hand quickly through his hair, straightening out the strands that hang in his face in an attempt to just give his hands something to do.
“Not just from an outsider’s point of view,” Max’s mother continues, “But from the one experiencing it as well.”
A few more pleasantries are exchanged before Flint must return home, and then Draco is rushing at his father to wrap him in a quick hug. He doesn’t stay long, hugs aren’t to be drawn out, nor common, things, but he is so overwhelmed with emotions he can’t help it.
Then it begins falling again and this time it doesn’t stop. Draco would scream but his voice gets caught in his throat as he sees the ground getting closer and closer, coming up to meet him and end his life with a splat. He doesn’t understand how this could have happened. He doesn’t understand what he could have done wrong. He hysterically begins pulling at the broom handle in a last-ditch effort to pull up, but it won’t work and he’s actually going to die. He’s going to hit the ground and die here and he doesn’t know why.
“He really did! He did it as soon as we left from Easter Break,” he explains and Draco throws his own head back to guffaw at the idea. He hadn’t realized Sirius would actually try it! This was brilliant!
Once away from the group of Gryffindors and Eve’s happy Hufflepuff, they fall into comfortable silence, walking towards the castle grounds. It is between classes and they really should be getting lunch right now, but Draco had wanted to use this time to investigate. Eve, being Eve, he’d asked to come along as added muscle.
But for a moment he lets himself be surrounded by the safety and love his mother provides, her cool demeanor like a balm to his panicked, flayed psyche.
“It’s just who he is, Eve, and it is important we support him through this.”
“You don’t
He had learned that Hitler was the main antagonist in this story, with his lackies in Japan and Italy, and they were fighting against the protagonists in the UK, America, Russia, and China.
“And all your notes don’t make sense…” Goyle says, dejected.
They attempt to ask Eve what they should expect on their O.W.L.s, but all she advises is, since it’s still the beginning of the year, finish homework and then review things from their previous years.
“Of course not,” Hermione says cheerfully. If she can hear Draco’s thoughts, she is ignoring them, and honestly, he wouldn’t put it past her.
When he sets both books on the table the others fall silent, staring in confusion at the pair. As far as visuals go, they look identical save for the Roman numeral 2, and the metal on the second volume is gold instead of silver.
They both end up down in the sitting room, Potter off to pick up some snacks from a nearby, Muggle store. It turns out the portrait has been stuck to the wall permanently by a non-reversible sticking charm.
Draco would always trust his father’s judgement. Always.
“And keep working on the DA,” the blonde adds. “You want something to do? Focus on that. You’re making a difference in their lives and I don’t think you fully realize how important that is for them.”
“We’re still going to keep an eye on you,” Weasley warns anyway. Draco snorts, but holds his hands up placatingly until the conversation changes.
They sit close to each other, probably closer than is strictly necessary, but Draco feels comfortable with it. The silence between their whispers is relaxing and natural, like a practiced skill, and Draco doesn’t understand why Eve keeps giving them both expectant looks before rolling her eyes and going back to reading.
“Want to go up to the Astronomy Tower and talk to Max?” Draco asks after a few beats of awkward silence, and Potter sags with a breath of relief, finally looking up and nodding.
“I was only trying to
champions, one from each school.”
“Good morning, Harry,” Draco greets when they both come up for air.
“Of course he would!” Max immediately responds, but Draco’s smile turns sad.
It helped, knowing about the different methods of studying. Looking at his friends now, it was clear they all differed. Hermione was logical, but also visual, using color coding to finally offer herself some organization. Draco, himself, was visual and auditory, sketching out his thoughts but needing to speak out loud in order to sort out his own mind.
Potter had, in one of these moments, finally gotten to meet Max’s mother and father, who spoke so sweetly to Potter when they’d learned he’d been witness to a fellow student’s death. The Muggles had been told it was an accident, the only time they would be willing to pretend that was true, and when all was said and done Potter had been so emotional, he couldn’t leave the Astronomy Tower for nearly an hour.
“Millicent Bulstrode and Cassius Warrington, definitely. Elijah Mort and Tabatha Verteaux, too, they’re sixth years. Graham Montague, the new Quidditch captain? Keep an eye out for him. Theodore Nott I’m still trying to get a read on. Most of the first and second years hardly have any kind of opinions at this point.”
“What did I say?” Draco snarls, leaning towards Dobby with a dangerous look in his eyes. The house elf startles and shrinks back, floppy ears turning more downwards than usual at the sudden animosity.
“Not like I had anything better to do,” Blaise sighs, shifting to get off his own bed and meander in Draco’s, and the door’s, direction.
“Oh, I intend to,” his father finally lowers his newspaper to smile at his son. It’s a small, thin movement and looks more like a smirk, but it means the world to Draco. “But these things take time. It is a game of patience and strategy.”
“They’ve been Beaters since their second year,” Ron says with an eyeroll, “There’s no way they’ll get replaced this year.”
Which was how they found themselves in Draco’s room, after everyone else had gone to sleep, trying to figure out Max’s gift. Max had said it was for Draco’s upcoming “adventures in preppy boarding school,” whatever that meant.
Harry leans just the slightest bit towards Draco, eyes fluttering, but then he’s leaning back and looking around. “We shouldn’t talk here,” he says, voice rough, and then he’s leading them further down the hallway to an abandoned classroom. It’s filled with desks and chairs stacked upside down atop them. Some chalkboards are shoved against the far wall and sheets cover some furniture in the corner.
It is also incredibly exhausting, the whole ordeal. His nose is completely fine now, and his arm feels better but remains in a sling, but these aren’t why he is so tired. As spectacular as he is at social gatherings, every time, without fail, he always leaves feeling tired. Parties, dinners, dances, whatever it might be, they always sap his energy. He was great at faking it, though, and no one knew during the actual events, but after…
A tension fills the room at these words and Draco looks over where the girl is lounging at one of the tables, smirking viciously at him like she’d won something.
“Excuse you, I was studying, which I am perfectly allowed to do. Unlike this little… stunt!” she waves her hands at the two boys, who are still standing behind the armchair like some kind of barrier.
“They came to rescue me, you see. I thought I could stop the troll - on account I have read so much about them - but I couldn’t…” Hermione says and Pansy chokes on her own spit while Ron actually drops his wand. Draco only just manages to contain his shocked expression as he stares up at his best friend, the girl facing off against three of their teachers and telling a flat lie.
Potter is rushing back before Draco fully processes what must be going on, but it’s too late. Weasley has already tried to send out a curse that backfires, sending him tumbling. When Draco approaches at a much calmer pace he finds Weasley on the ground, spitting up slugs.
For all Draco knew she was already on the train.
“Oh! I love your hypotheticals! Hit me, hit me.” Max’s voice comes in and out as they most certainly bounce up and down.
“Excuse me?” Weasley somehow manages to squawk and whisper at the same time. “How is rushing around not a good Quidditch strategy?”
There appears to be some instinctive knowledge within his new body, and although he trips up a few times, face planting and tumbling with a litany of angry squeaks, he’s able to get the hang of sprinting through the tall grass as fast as he can.
“Well, I think she’s a lovely girl,” Draco says with a smile. As strange as Tracey was, she was certainly one of the good ones.
“Don’t say that where Hermione can hear you,” Harry warns and they both chuckle under their breaths. They pause, air mingling between them, and Harry repeats, “See you soon,” before they’re finally separating.
“The book appears empty to everyone but Leandra,” Draco says cooly, stopping the fight before it can begin. Their wards were impressive things, but Eve and Granger were scary, and he doubts their defenses could survive a brawl between the two.
To cover up his mounting panic Draco is quick to begin yelling. “DOBBY! GET IN HERE!” The manor houses many house elves, but Dobby is the one usually in charge of Draco’s care specifically. Even if he hadn’t been the one to go directly against Draco’s orders, he will know which house elf did.
The blonde throws his hands out in a disbelieving gesture, his eyes rolling skywards. What was he? The Golden Trio’s councilor? What next, was Weasley going to come to him with girl troubles? This was ridiculous.
“He spoke in sign language, obviously,” Eve calls back, glancing over her shoulder. “His whole year of Slytherins is pretty fluent at it by now.”
“Alright, enough!” Draco roars, then turns sharply. He stalks over to the fireplace and picks up Harry’s Cloak of Invisibility, discarded in the scuffle, and brings it back to Harry. The boy looks ready to fight, so Draco cuts to the chase. “There’s nothing any of us can say to change your mind, so take this,” he shoves the cloak at Harry, then shifts to dig in the hidden pockets in his satchel.
“What are you working on that has you so irritated?” Luna asks, which gets a sigh out of Draco. The boy raises up his camera, then hands it over to Tracey when she makes grabby hands at it.
The tone of his voice gives Fudge pause and Draco can positively feel the tension and glares on his back. He keeps his composure, however, and keeps facing Fudge.
“What?” Draco questions when no one seems willing to say anything. Harry audibly gulps, working his mouth as he tries to figure out what to say. Theodore beats him to the punch.
“I wouldn’t know what Dumbledore thinks,” Harry suddenly snarls, more heat than expected, but it quickly simmers away. “Snape likely isn’t going to say anything, and I won’t either. I probably have a better chance learning from you and the other Slytherins, anyway.”
He’d received another package from Max’s family filled with a new pile of Muggle books, a vinyl record for the Ramones album “Acid Eaters,” a device called a Walkman with tons of “cassettes,” and a substantial amount of American candy.
“Why would you have a museum dedicated to it, then?” Draco questions, baffled by these Muggles and a little bit horrified.
“They should rebrand that as Weasley Nip,” Potter chuckles quietly, “Did you know Ginny loves that stuff too?”
“Glad to know my innate goose-down-nature was of some assistance, then,” Draco says haughtily, and Potter shifts back and looks up at him with an arched brow. He looks strange without his glasses. Like a zebra without their stripes.
“Does it really only have one ball?” Harry questions, looking far more scandalized than is really necessary, and Draco snorts.
“Ooooh! Like how people used to think smart, imaginative women couldn’t give birth?” Max immediately perks up, energy finally entering their voice once more.
Luckily Granger, who has given up trying to lecture Weasley, steps in to help. “How was Defense Against the Dark Arts with Umbridge?”
“You are, but we weren’t talking about you,” Draco waves off the ginger, who glowers at him.
“Something big that thinks it’s a lap dog,” Eve agrees.
“You consider attempting to hex one another is heckling? And that such a violent act would be classified as friendly behavior?” Draco demands, baffled and irritated more than he’d certainly planned to be today. “Tell me, then, what secret message all your explosions have, Finnigan.”
.oOo.
Vivian Wilcom is completely at ease in her spot in the grass, her dark red hair tied back in a messy bun as she tinkers with a little, metal device. Draco doesn’t know her very well, she tended to function mostly at night, and also kept to herself. She was boisterous and protective, sure, but she hardly went out of her way to make friends, seemingly comfortable in her own company, and Draco didn’t have much chance to interact with people outside his own year.
“I still can’t believe your friends are named ‘Crabbe’ and ‘Goyle.’ They sound like STD’s,” Max says thoughtfully and Draco rolls his eyes.
“Father…” he says lowly, trying to keep his tone light and nonchalant, but failing miserably. “Do you…” Have to say those words? Everyone else thinks they’re bad. Everyone else thinks their cruel. A Muggle, who doesn’t know what they even mean, calls them slurs.
This surprises Potter, seeing as his spine shoots straight and he looks at Draco like he doesn’t believe him.
Snape says nothing, just looks up at Draco, and perhaps to anyone else he looks as dour and angry as he always does, but Draco has known this man his whole life. He can tell Snape is entertained by this and Draco desperately wishes the floor would just open up and eat him right there.
They leave Weasley for last, since he isn’t actually hurting anyone and they are hoping the curse on him will wear off over time.
On his way to Potions, which he still shares with the Gryffindors, Draco nearly gets bowled over by an agitated Cho Chang as she storms down the halls. She mumbles a swift apology on reflex before continuing on.
~ ~ ~
They don’t say a word for it, just squeeze each other until they are reassured that they’re both alright, then stepping back and away from each other.
“Shhh!” Harry hisses as Draco yanks his hand away from his mouth.
If someone decides to become an Animagus the legal way they are required to go through a series of classes with Professor McGonagall during their third year. Most of this is preparing the actual potion, doing research, and being taught everything that could possibly go wrong.
“OKAASAN!” Eve shrieks, mortified, as Draco and Harry yelp and spring apart, their eyes huge and surprised by the sudden bluntness of it all. “They’re fifteen!”
~ ~ ~
~ ~ ~
When the train finally comes to a stop in King’s Cross Station, they bustle to get their things, meandering out in a group and trying to not get knocked over by the other students in their hurry to get to summer break.
~ ~ ~
“It’s doubtful any of these plans would be of any help to you. They’re specifically for Slytherins and getting down to the dungeons. You’re the ones with the Marauders Map. Plan out escape routes for your own house.”
The interesting thing about people now being aware Draco took photos with a Muggle camera was the added benefit that, after a year, they tended just to ignore him when he did it. The first few months of his fourth year plenty of students had requested he take photos of them or would attempt to photobomb or mess up his shots.
He “accidentally” bumps right into Umbridge as she has her head turned away and upward, sending the woman tumbling forward. She shrieks, arms flailing, and then water is splashing everywhere as she falls into the swamp.
One of these days, with Eve leading the way, they end up at something called an “aquarium.” Draco does not know what it is, and neither Eve nor Potter will tell him.
Potter hums in agitated agreement, and he must be feeling better if he’s back to feeling agitated. “Not even Snape would have done that. He’d stick to one detention per opinion.”
Draco picks up the paper, the conversation around him shifting to one of Ron’s older brothers named Charlie, who apparently works with dragons, but Draco is too enraptured with the clipping to join in.
Hermione sighs at his side and Harry snorts, despite still looking very upset at this whole thing. Ron is looking disgusted again before he’s huffing and shaking his head, resigned to some unknown fate. Draco is getting very irritated at not being able to understand the boy and his expressions. “Alright, what is this garbage about, Weasley? Spit it out,” he says harsher than he intended, but not caring all that much.
For the past few weeks, when nothing seemed to happen following the article on Barty Crouch’s murder, Draco began to feel a little desperate. He was still incredibly suspicious of Alastor Moody, but he’d hardly changed at all. No fear. No acting out. No panicking. Nothing.
It was Halloween day and the first Hogsmeade trip for all third years. Draco, of course, had his permission slip ready to go, and had even been looking forward to it, but at the last moment he had changed his mind. He would go next time, but for now he wanted to enjoy the solitude of the Hogwarts grounds without all of the hustle and bustle of students.
“Yes… So, curious, as I said Mr. Malfoy,” the wandmaker continues, “how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, after all.” Draco feels himself stiffening the more Ollivander talks, unsure how one should react to this information. “I believe we should expect great things from you, Mr. Malfoy,” Ollivander says, a bit gentler and more thoughtful, “After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. Terrible, yes… but great.”
He flips over the box and reads the instructions, slowly going over every word, before finally raising up the black and green piece of plastic and pointing it at Dobby. “Let’s give this a shot then. Hold still,” he orders the house elf, then raises his hand and presses the button. The flash blinds him again, making him yelp.
“Yes, I’m very coolio,” he says with a roll of his eyes, the twins immediately snickering so Draco looks to Lee. “Wouldn’t mind a distraction, however. Discussing any new inventions?”
“That’s really impressive. Both of you,” he says sincerely, his smile of amazement never leaving his face. “If you’re willing, you can lead today’s lesson. I was going to have us continue working on our Patronus and Militus Charms -” since Easter Sophie had managed to summon a frilled lizard Patronus, Johnson a cheetah Patronus, and Smith a bat Militus “- but I think this could do us some serious good.”
“I say ignore it,” Draco shrugs, doing his best to appear uncaring. It is hard not to smile as he watches Umbridge squirm, unaware the current source of the Ministry’s problems is sitting right across from her. “It’s not like anyone is rioting or causing a scene. The interest and novelty of it all will fade, and all will be forgotten.”
“I tried to keep him out, I really did,” the Boy-Who-Lived moans in misery, covering his face with his hands. “He didn’t say anything afterwards, just… sent me off to bed…”
Draco didn’t like how they handled the mail, however. Whenever something came in for one of the kids they felt they had to read it first. Nothing was kept a secret, it was all done where said child could see, and they claimed it was a safety precaution, but it all felt very inappropriate to Draco. It wasn’t their mail, so they shouldn’t read it.
Dumbledore looks particularly pleased by this.
Draco wonders if they’ll be getting started with dinner, now, and he glances at the doors to see if anyone might be coming in with trays of food. No one does, much to the displeasure of his stomach, and he looks back to the front of the hall where McGonagall is setting away her list and moving the stool and hat aside. She moves back to the empty seat beside the Headmaster at the Head Table and then Dumbledore is getting to his feet. Draco is immediately all ears, eyes locked on the elder man and his colorful robes and his clever, twinkling eyes.
Draco cringes and Harry immediately begins to cackle under his breath. “As touching as your offer may be,” Draco begins slowly, “Please don’t attack a teacher for me.”
“I want to release the truth and trick the Ministry into allowing its publication. They’ll hardly read over an article they think has nothing to do with them or their pissing contest with Dumbledore.”
“I am not a sexy librarian!” Potter near shrieks as Draco rolls onto his side. He can feel the fiery glare being thrown his way, but it does nothing to stop his laughter. This was too perfect. It couldn’t get much better than this.
But then he remembers Mrs. Nubble’s screech as that owl snatched her letter out of her hands and how she had been absolutely terrified of the bird McGonagall later called in during their first meeting and Draco smirks. He looks up at the elder witch with a half-eager, half-evil sparkle to his eyes.
“Vince… he, uh,” Greg starts, back to sounding entirely nervous, “He doesn’t talk…”
After hearing so much from Hermione about what to expect from her intensive reading Draco didn’t feel too bad zoning out for a moment and looking around. Hermione was hanging off every word from the professor’s mouth while Neville looked oddly nervous, still clutching his toad. Vincent and Greg look like they are trying to listen, but aren’t paying the closest attention. A few paces to the side the tall boy and fat girl that had snickered at Greg are joined by a lanky girl with short, black hair and sharp eyes, her expression somehow both glued to McGonagall while also flicking around the room. A tall boy with dark skin and closely shaved, black hair stands off to the other side, looking to be trying to avoid everyone, his arms crossed and expression closed off. Harry and Ron are in the back, paying close attention to McGonagall like they are being briefed on a mission.
Draco’s brows furrow, not quite liking the wording of that. His motive? That made it sound like he was committing a crime. Which, despite everything they’d gone through, was likely what Granger and Weasley thought Draco was doing.
Harry must pick up on his newfound composure because when Draco looks over the Seeker is grinning at him.
“I think they’re romantic just as they are,” Leandra comments, pouting at Eve, who shrugs.
“What?” Granger questions, shoulders sagging as she looks to Leandra, more curious than defensive. The Hufflepuff is cradling her heirloom to her chest tightly, as if she needs to defend it, and her eyes are watching Granger like she’s a cobra.
He’s a little surprised by Neville Longbottom, who has been remarkably silent this whole time, but he isn’t surprised by Potter’s hand slowly rising into the air. He does stiffen, however, when he realizes the other boy’s eyes aren’t on Hagrid or the herd of thestrals, but rather on Draco himself, expression unreadable.
When the Lung Dragon article finally drops Draco has to be careful. Where, with all the previous articles, he had to keep his ears to the floorboards to find out people’s responses, when the final article on sentient, magical beings finally comes out, everyone is talking about it.
He turns off the radio and shrinks it with a simple charm he’d basically perfected by second year. He stashes the shrunken radio in his pants pocket beneath his casual robes and fully faces the now very distinct figures rushing towards him. He makes no move to approach them and make their trip any easier.
“Why don’t you use a wand?” Draco questions without thinking.
speaking English, aren’t I?” he questions.
“Aren’t you a pureblood?” Draco questions her, eyes narrowing in confusion and suspicion. Daphne huffs, flicking her shining hair and giving Draco a disapproving look.
to hear it?”
“Sometimes,” Max’s mother agrees, “But sometimes not. It can never feel the same from one person to another, thus making it near impossible to predict.”
Harry looks back as well, expression expectant and hopeful, while Draco tries to keep his own face under control. Sinistra says nothing for a moment before replying, “No. If you wish to remain out of trouble yourselves, then so must he.” Draco feels himself deflate, but he can’t be too upset. Sinistra has a point. If they want their own rule breaking to remain quiet, then so too did Theodore’s. It was still disheartening, though.
He always, always, always got what he wanted!
When all the Ravenclaws are through, door shutting behind their group, Draco turns and bolts. He doesn’t have time to check on everyone else, even though he really wants to, and instead heads straight back for the Astronomy Tower. His paws are completely silent as he heads up the stairs, no more traps left to be set off on him now, and he halts in the shadow of the doorway.
Seeing the shadow creature now, Draco can see why people assume this must be a dark art… If he were an enemy and Sinistra was using this cobra weaved from solid shadow to attack him, Draco thinks he’d be greatly unnerved and frightened. But, he isn’t. Draco is Sinistra’s student, not a threat, and he knows, can actually
“And if they do?”
“I missed the Patronus lesson!” he yelps, scrambling messily to sit up as best he can in his impromptu nest. The Golden Trio look over to him, watching him struggle, and taking a moment to realize what he’s upset over. When their own realization dawns, they look apologetic.
“We just wanted to talk!” Draco calls, staying low to the ground, but looking up as the allusive shadow finally stills within the clouds. He can tell it is long, so long it wraps entirely around the stone structure twice while still keeping in cloud cover, and it rears back a head with mighty horns that look like branches atop it. “Honest! We want to know your story, that’s all!”
“You’d be one of the few, then,” Draco huffs roughly, looking away to glare off at the clouds.
Nonetheless, it was quite fun to play as a secret photographer. Max said he was like a private detective, out scoping a case, taking scathing photos of his targets “in the act.”
The entire café has gone dead silent at the noise, everyone staring at them, Eve grinning, and Draco staring in wide-eyed horror at his hand like it doesn’t belong to him. He swallows, slowly pulling his hand back into his lap, then turns to nod at the café as a whole. “Sorry about that… Saw a bug…” The explanation appeases the other patrons, who go back to ignoring them, and Draco, overly calm, turns back to Eve.
“No. Not really… but it’s something I’ve been wondering,” Harry admits honestly with a shrug.
Then he has to kick a Skrewt that gets too close, and dives behind Granger when it’s stinger strikes at him.
“Well… What you are doing here is essentially the same. You are protecting these students, but in a different way. What you are doing will
“I expect you to. Perhaps now Hogwarts will understand what proper greatness is and stop humoring these… blood traitors and mudbloods.”
“If anyone can change it, it’s your generation,” Sirius says, voice meaningful as he looks to the bushy-haired girl.
For a moment Draco tenses, certain he had misjudged and he was about to lose everything, but then Narcissa is muttering a silencing charm at his walls and door, turning a smile to her son as she slips her wand back into her sleeve.
“Maybe we could leave some food out for it?” Potter suggests, “Lunch should still be out, we could grab a plate of meat.”
“He just came back from his career counseling meeting,” Eve, who decided that sitting on Draco’s legs was a totally normal place to perch, says while flipping through a book Draco doesn’t care about.
“What’re you working on, Leandra?” Harry finally asks, taking pity on Draco and changing the subject. Despite that, however, both Draco and Eve have a quick, silent battle by making the ugliest faces at each other they possibly can.
“What does that mean?” Harry demands, looking around at them, and Draco sighs. He doubted anything would calm the boy down until they were actually out of here and somewhere safe, but it would be really nice if Harry could chill out just a tiny bit.
Granger was the only one who had managed to form her Militus besides the Slytherin. Draco had been expecting some kind of yappy dog, at best, and had even been joking about it for some time beforehand, but then the muggleborn had stated the incantation and out lumbered the dark, menacing form of a grizzly bear.
“How, exactly, were you planning on getting in without me?” Draco wonders, arching a brow, but the other boy doesn’t seem embarrassed. Instead, he pulls out something from his pocket and flicks it open.
“This prophecy could turn the tides against Voldemort, since he wants it so much,” Harry argues back.
“I already let the rest of the Inquisitorial Squad know to meet me at my office,” Umbridge is saying as the group approaches. Weasley and Longbottom’s eyes are wide in fright and fury, but they’ve clearly given up trying to struggle. There’s a bruise on Longbottom’s jaw, which looks painful, and Weasley is leaning like something might be wrong with his left shoulder. “Join us, won’t you? We’ve finally got some rodents to catch.”
Usually, if he had gone with his mother and father, they would have apparated straight to the stadium, Draco having to side-along with Ministry permission.
Draco’s brows pinch together, and he crosses his own arms, mirroring the other boy. He didn’t know why he suddenly felt so defensive. “You could talk to people.”
“I should have seen this coming. Getting teamed up on by Gryffindors!”
“I do not know, but this is surely a disturbing thought,” Dumbledore sighs, standing straight once more. He removes his wand and in one, smooth gesture conjures a black sheet that drapes over the body. Then he turns his wise, old eyes on Draco, head tilting just slightly. “What do you think, Mr. Malfoy?”
“Yeah, I did. He was looking through his camera when they found him, but the insides of the camera were all melted.”
“Oh, you mean like that family you’re always complaining about? The Weasels, or whatever their name is?”
Apparently, someone had let slip that they would be getting his personal files soon - whether that was the goblins or the twins, Skeeter couldn’t tell - and he had panicked and come here. Once he’d found his files with Mr. Davis’s help, he’d quietly gone through them.
Potter,” he adds the last part when he sees the other boy opening his mouth to argue, “We’re here for defense lessons, so let’s just get started.”
“We should hurry back to the dungeons,” Eve says, glancing around for any signs of Mr. Filch or his cat. Draco straightens up, his ears swiveling as he listens. All his senses felt like they were on overdrive, but they didn’t feel too overwhelming. Perhaps it was because of the night and the muffling rain, but he was able to take stock of his new outlook on the world with ease.
“It means I don’t currently have it,” Potter says defensively, glaring back at Draco. “I lent it to Mad-Eye. He thinks it’s brilliant, which it is, and I owed him for keeping Snape off my trail.”
“Oh, no worries, Pa,” says one twin.
“Very well, Draco,” Skeeter says, voice tight and face drawn. She was livid, the anger dripping off her body. “It would appear I have no choice. I will help with your… schoolyard games.”
Chapter Word Count: 44,181
“Give us the prophecy, Mr. Potter,” Lucius says coolly, somehow speaking over Longbottom’s wails and Bellatrix’s high laughter. Lucius’s hand is outstretched, a small smirk playing on his face, and Harry glances back at him in terror.
“Yeah, but just listening to you talk about it all…” Weasley trails off and Draco’s glare flicks to Potter when he snickers.
“Don’t spoil her. She’ll get insufferable,” he drawls and Harry shrugs, still running his finger over her scales. Draco turns his glare back to her, now, and says lowly, “You should know better, young lady. I have a pet owl now, you realize? She could eat you up!”
“Ignore him,” Draco sighs, “Even if he is right. It
It becomes a norm for them, and Draco always feels so much more at ease after their late-night visits. They never stay out as late as they did the first time and, so long as they don’t try to go out on too many school nights, they don’t get exhausted.
“I don’t know of many,” Harry admits, “Sirius doesn’t talk about them much, but most are… most aren’t good people…” Draco stares at Harry, pleading him silently to explain, and the other boy sighs anxiously. “A lot of them… sided with You-Know-Who during the war…” Draco stiffens, eyes widening.
“But that’s not fair!”
“Don’t you love it?” Harry says wistfully at his side, also peering over the edge, but his eyes are locked on the horizon, and Draco scowls at him.
“Me thinks I smell a little jealousy,” Sophie says, her eyes narrowed.
“I do not see what Potter has to do with this…” Draco continues, somehow even more confused.
~ ~ ~
Draco nods meaningfully, his grey eyes sparkling eagerly, but before anymore can be said Max is rushing over to them and taking Draco’s hand. “Draco, Draco, they have a gift shop! Gift shop! Come check it out with me!”
“Which means we’re still on schedule,” Eve says as she walks closer to him. Her hand finds its way to Draco’s, curling around it and squeezing as they lock eyes for a quick moment. Nothing else is said between them, but the reassurance is palpable.
There’s a scramble as Vivian hurries out, her own walkie-talkie in hand, and Draco and Harry gather up their things. For a split second after the two boys kick back into the air Draco feels a sinking feeling in his gut, but then Harry flies in close to his side, their knees bumping, and he manages to calm himself.
?” the voice Draco always associated with Muddy, childish and feminine, hisses in his ear as the snake moves around.
“Oh! We got your photo, Draco!” Max says brightly one afternoon, and Draco looks up. He’s sitting in the owlery, quill in hand, and all the pages he has for his investigation spread out in his lap or on the bench beside him.
“You’re really not as clever as you think, prat,” the bespectacled boy huffs.
“The ability to work in a magical environment, though?”
“What is this?” Harry mumbles and Draco takes the walkie-talkie from him.
“She not coming out again?” Draco questions as he moves closer. No one is really around the castle right now, instead off at the pitch, so he isn’t worried about being seen around the known DA members.
she hisses, head swaying.
“Go ahead and get fitted for your robes. It may take a moment so I will retrieve the last of your supplies,” she says, motioning to the shop with a pointed nod before she’s hurrying off without actually seeming to be in a hurry. Draco blinks after her before facing the robes shop and slowly entering.
“No, no, Hermione!” Leandra says quickly, her eyes wide and hands waving in what is probably meant to be placating. “You misunderstand! We just… we discovered something and I wanted to check, that’s all.”
“I’ll try and send them your way, too,” Draco nods at her, thankful. He’d been worried, for a moment, that they would deny him. These particular Slytherins were good people. They were in Slytherin for a reason, and knew how to work a situation to their benefit, but all the opportunities that were offered to them - offered to most Slytherins - brought them down roads filled with darkness and pain.
Finally, Draco gets to the display that really stops him dead. It’s a single plaque next to a series of very thick books chained to a table. The plaque makes that pit in Draco’s stomach start turning in coiling spirals.
And they’re speaking.
He hands his portkey off to a Ministry official, ignoring them when they ask where the rest of his family is, and he walks out onto the grounds, weaving through hordes of people and looking around. There are all kinds of vendors that peak his interest, mostly selling cheap trinkets that have been doubled or tripled in their prices. Draco doesn’t immediately purchase anything, but the roar and laughter are invigorating.
“They will even work through walls, so we need not concern ourselves with that,” Draco continues, leaning back in the sofa and tapping his fingers against the armrest.
The blonde looks up at Ollivander with thinned eyes, suspicious. “How old are you?” he questions and hears McGonagall hiss a warning at him almost immediately, but Ollivander seems unphased.
“How did you manage it?” Harry asks, voice shaking, and Draco looks back down at him. “You used to worship the ground your father walked on, but when that changed you always seemed… fine. Cool and collected. Didn’t it hurt?”
“You put yourself on his side,” Sirius says quietly and most of the angry glares fade.
“He tried to look at his hand!”
“Tons,” Granger nods.
He does eventually find the room and the door swings open after only two knocks. Eve stands there, clearly frazzled, and she hardly waits for Draco to say anything before grabbing ahold of his collar and yanking him inside.
Draco nervously follows after her to his room. He was able to manage his father with ease, his ire inconsequential to Draco, but his mother’s judgement still would lay a heavy toll on his heart. If she demanded he get rid of his Muggle things… then he doubts he would ever be able to say no. He wouldn’t be capable of such a feat.
~ ~ ~
The tears well up quickly, then begin to drip free, turning their kiss wet until Harry pulls away. He doesn't go far, though, instead shifting them until he can hold Draco as close as his wounded shoulder will allow. The tears keep falling, wrecked breaths quake out of Draco on every exhale, body shaking as he presses his face to Harry’s neck.
“Krum had a copy, too, you know. Why am I getting all the flack?” Draco whines, sitting up straighter.
“We should go,” Potter whispers and both Draco and Granger nod in agreement, the three hurrying away and towards the castle.
“I think you and Hermione may have been related in a past life,” Harry deadpans, scooting closer to get a look at the book.
Even Max could be worn down. They were only human, after all.
One name, just one name, and the entire DA is abruptly erupting into a panic. The noise is deafening as they all begin shrieking and yelling and demanding what they can do. Some of them start moving around, frantic, but swiftly realize there’s nowhere to go.
“Remembrance. Dedication. Historical intrigue,” Max’s mother offers gently, glancing up at the photos of the mushroom cloud hanging on the wall. “Morbid curiosity.”
It doesn’t feel like he passes through anything, but one moment he’s one place and the next he’s somewhere else. A sign reading “Platform 9 ¾” hangs above him and a red train engine now sits on the tracks. Draco’s eyes widen as he looks around. It feels so much brighter here; more colors, more life. Things buzz overhead that look like they could be toys, people wear all kinds of robes and Muggle clothes, loud calls and chatter fill the air, and-- Draco startles yet again as Harry pops up in front of him, smiling happily at him and congratulating him on getting through.
“Hey, Malfoy…?” Draco looks over at the two boys, both looking nervous and fidgeting with their parchment and quills. They glance at each other, before Goyle continues, “What if… What if the Dark Lord really is back? What… What happens then?”
“Yes, she did.”
“I think…” Longbottom mumbles some more, reaching for some shears but not using them yet. Instead he turns towards Draco, fidgeting like he’s covered in ants, and tries to find his words for his on-again-off-again tormentor. “Maybe…”
Sirius is probably being tortured as we speak!” Draco grips Harry tighter, trying to urge him closer, but Harry lashes out suddenly to get away. There’s definitely tears in his eyes, now. “We have to go save him!”
“Agreed,” Eve nods, hers and Longbottom’s attentions both still on Hermione, clearly concerned.
“It’ll be alright Neville,” Hermione calls as the boy is led away and a murmur of agreement ripples through most of the students. The second they’re out of sight, however, Millicent, Theodore, and Pansy begin to laugh.
He wants to cheer, cry out that they’re saved, but they aren’t. They are still in the middle of a huge battle, which they had been trying to avoid, and trying to duck away from stray spells. Tracey is on the ground trying to shield Weasley’s body with her own. The ginger looks unconscious by this point, unmoving, and Longbottom stands beside them, recovered enough to defend them with his wandless magic, even if he’s clearly fatigued.
“Tsuki?” Draco questions when he spies a familiar barn owl sitting on Cecil Duke’s desk. Eve’s owl tilts her head to look back at Draco, before squawking in frustration at him. “Oh, I’m sorry, did I make you wait?” Draco smirks, reaching down to take a letter folded in the owl’s talons.
The students stare in awe as the form of a blue whale made of pure light begins to swim through the air, circling the tower with massive beats of its tail and fins. Then, Sinistra makes a sharp, cutting gesture with her finger and the beautiful creature falls apart and fades away like it had never been there.
“Oh, my parents should be in in a second to pay,” the other boy says, glancing worriedly back at the front door. “They got caught up talking to their old Transfiguration teacher.”
“No, I’m just…” Potter starts, very clearly avoiding eye contact, and chewing on the inside of his cheek. He was always a dreadful liar. “I’m just tired, Malfoy. Maybe we should head to our dorms.”
“Quite,” Draco says sharply, crossing his arms. He desperately wanted to leave this interaction and get back to looking around. He had nothing to say to these two.
“And why is that?”
“I asked Blaise to let me in and he did.”
Once every student has found a seat in the boats Draco only has a few moments to realize there is no way to steer or paddle before they are moving. The blonde looks around in shock as all the boats begin drifting over the water on their own, lanterns swishing on their fronts and creating wobbly, glowing reflections on the water. Draco glances over the side of his boat, watching the dark water ripple, the stars twinkling overhead, and he can’t help the urge to reach out and skim his fingers over the water.
Draco, being the double agent of the group, had a bit more leeway. He could start heading for the meetings far earlier, sometimes even right after meeting Umbridge for tea, and if anyone asked what he was doing all he had to say was Prefect work.
“They don’t,” Draco mumbles, only half listening, but is then pulled out of his thoughts by a tap at the window. Both boys look over at a giant, hairy man holding ice cream cones that look comically small in his hands. He’s smiling in at the other boy and, before he can consider his wording, Draco comments, “Look at that! What does an oaf like that want?”
“Goblins,” Draco replies honestly, shrugging. “I spotted them in Hogsmeade surrounding Bagman. Paid them off and offered to get more dirt on him for them to find out why they were mad with him. They were also aware of all the bets he made, including yours, the nosey bastards.”
“Hello, Draco,” the wistful voice pulls Draco out of his musings, his camera lowering as he turns towards the voice. Hogsmeade was as lively as ever and Draco had decided a few candid photos were in order. He so often was focusing on individuals or landscapes, he’d wanted to try his hand at busier pictures, too. Give himself a challenge.
He’d probably be terrifying to most people, but Draco can’t help but feel in awe of the being before him as he moves his hands through particular motions. It takes Draco an embarrassingly long moment to realize these motions look a lot like
“Definitely,” he nods, kicking his backpack under the seat, “I also have a few spells I saw I wanted to try.” His first thought was the unlocking spell McGonagall had used on Tootsie’s cage. It had been the first spell he’d seen that he’d also caught the words for and he really wanted to try it out.
Draco realizes the room around him has fallen deathly silent save for the splashing of lake water against the windows. He looks up towards Harry and finds the boy is staring at him with wide, shocked eyes. Draco blinks, then looks back towards the room. Theodore is staring, looking a little frightened, and Blaise has sat up in his bed, also shocked but curious, too.
Harry goes on to say that the rest of them had mastered both charms up to this point and he had been worried if Draco felt left out. Draco’s brain processes the words, but he can’t quite understand them, his focus still back on what Harry had already said.
“Cinema it is, then!” Draco says cheerfully, happy it is his idea that got priority while Eve pouts.
“Draco, obviously,” Eve mumbles, glancing over the paper at her fellow Slytherin, one brow arched. “He’s basically a Ministry intern, so he may as well be a Ministry member.”
He’d also received two unknown gifts amongst the many from his mother.
“A big one, I hear,” Pansy says cheerfully, but still extracts two galleons from her pocket and Blaise does the same. They toss them onto the table and Eve swiftly collects.
“Harry and I.”
Finally, all that’s left are Draco and the Golden Trio.
With meaning Draco steps forward and leans in. He has to lean down some, too, seeing as he appears to have begun to grow taller than the other boy.
“Do you recall in our second year when you approached me to inform me you did not think I was the Heir of Slytherin?”
“I never claimed to agree with every detail of the wizarding world. I doubt fame at such a young age could do anyone any good,” McGonagall replies, obviously not impressed by Draco’s outburst, but being patient with him.
“Wait… so the Ministry was there? They saw Voldemort?” Draco asks, brows rising in surprise when Blaise nods at him. Oh… well, then this was getting interesting. After so long of denying the return of the Dark Lord, of calling Harry a liar, of calling Dumbledore a hack, they’d just had the truth shoved in their faces.
“They sided with the guy that killed their family?” he demands, frantic.
~ ~ ~
They scramble out of Sinistra’s office the second they are allowed, shaken and terrified, and begin hurrying down the corridor to get as far away as possible.
So, he was surrounded by weirdos on all sides, but he was getting better at dealing with them and appreciating their moments of clarity. They were a break from the true insanity that now surrounded Hogwarts, and Draco would take what he could get.
“Please, by all that is divine and holy, stop now,” Weasley is whining from only a few feet away, looking like he wants to throw himself off the Astronomy Tower. Draco ignores him while Harry has the grace to smile apologetically.
“Opal isn’t pearl, though,” Weasley questions bluntly
“What happened to them?” Ada whispers and Mr Nubble hushes her, but no one else seems too bothered by the question. Draco looks up at McGonagall and his heart drops at her expression.
“How was everyone’s summer, then?” Draco questions, looking around at the compartment. Thankfully, due to the meeting in the prefect’s cabin, they are already at least halfway to Hogwarts and he won’t have to sit in this cramped space for long. He may as well strike up conversation so it doesn’t become stiflingly awkward.
“The Weasley rat?” Snape questions, disbelieving, eyes thinned as Fudge looks over the new photos.
“They’re Muggle, right?” Longbottom eventually asks when Draco makes no move to respond. “That Max… guy… girl…?”
“Duffle bag?”
Millicent, however, does not have that concern. Over time, where some of the other Slytherins had begun questioning tradition with Draco’s “on-again, off-again” rebellion, Millicent had instead veered the opposite direction. She was more biting and vicious than ever before, isolating herself from the other Slytherins in her year save for Theodore, who had always been on the fence about everything.
“I’m so going to tell him!”
“Everyone has a limit,” Eve says softly, reaching out to grip one of Granger’s hands and ease it out of a tight fist. “Don’t feel bad over something like that.”
“There aren’t four schools, though.”
“They’ll have to play along with what Umbridge expects of them,” Longbottom continues, words muffled in his knees. “If they act nice or decent… she’s sure to get suspicious.”
“She hasn’t known Krum for four years,” Eve says blandly, not looking up from her Potions textbook, a quill in a free hand as she attempts to plot out an essay.
There were screams all around him, horrifying things, as people ran for their lives, swiftly turning into a stampede. Someone had nailed Draco right across the temple in their hurry, knocking him to the ground, and dazing him something dreadful.
Draco arches a brow as he and Harry exchange a look, then turn back to watch the mother and daughter conversation. Slowly, after a few swift blinks, Ms. Hushburn throws her spoon-hand skyward and makes a sharp noise of realization. “Ohhh, yes, yes. You like girls now. You still break his heart. Should feel ashamed.”
Draco gives a weak shrug and looks back down at the fossil trapped in the amber. “Do you think if we could melt the amber this lizard would still be alive?”
“And here I’d always thought you just liked the sound of your own voice,” Eve had smirked, when he’d told her, but he’d ignored her.
The moment he steps into the Room of Requirement, the room taking on the usual meeting room that he and the Golden Trio had been using, the windows appearing to looking out on a sparkling, wintery scene from Draco’s fantasies, the beetle flies off his shoulder and shifts into a very disgruntled-looking Rita Skeeter.
Draco blinks owlishly, before turning a faint shade of pink. “Um… yes. I did. Is that a problem?” he asks haughtily, flicking his hair.
Merlin, Draco was just glad he had no need to be alone with the youngest, male Weasley any time soon. That was bound to end poorly for all involved…
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” Potter says, pressing his wand to what looks like just a blank pile of papers. He and Draco sit beside each other, leaning against the wall, Draco still in his Yule Ball attire while Potter looks ready for bed.
“Hey, Nev,” Max will usually begin and pause long enough for Longbottom to meander closer to Draco and the radio. “Do you think mirrors reveal the truth… or show the lie?”
Just about any Ravenclaw was good as well, since they often had their noses buried in research of some kind and wouldn’t pay attention to Draco. He’d even managed to get nearly a foot away from a Ravenclaw in the library, one time, without her noticing. But that was all they did. Research. And as interesting as that might be when he, personally, was doing it, it didn’t make a very interesting subject matter.
And then a photo of a slightly younger Sinistra that morphs into a honey badger when tilted side to side.
With a shout Harry is on his broom and flying upwards, snatching at the Remembrall, but Theodore sees him coming and backs out of his range. Draco, despite his own fury, thinks Harry is a really good flier. “Give it here, Nott!” Harry snaps.
“If I had someone out to murder me, I definitely wouldn’t be excited to get any kind of anonymous presents,” he says honestly, crossing his arms and leaning back in his seat. Granger looks up at him, looking startled, before her expression is shifting to something close to hopeful. It makes Draco ridiculously uncomfortable.
Now, though, he was grateful to be done with it. He sets the top of the phial on the floor by his feet, then pulls the mandrake leaf from his mouth. He holds the slimy, spit-soaked thing up to the full moon’s rays, letting it absorb some of its latent power, before pushing the leaf into the phial. He allows the moon’s light to wash over the phial as well before continuing.
“He probably needs to stay all ‘conscious of the public eye,’ or something,” Weasley says, looking far more relaxed now that they’re not talking about Slytherins and their inherent worth.
‘Had them for years,’ Draco signs back with a shrug, still staring wide-eyed. ‘I can’t believe I’m talking to you.’
“I don’t mind playing the bad guy, Potter. I’ve had practice, you know,” Draco drawls, trying for funny but Potter only frowns deeper.
“What shit friends.”
What he couldn’t understand was why these two girls, from his rival house, weren’t just talking to him, but offering to get his camera fixed by yet another Gryffindor.
Longbottom had beamed with so much pride even his Lumos had gotten brighter.
He’s pretty sure he does all that, except… except the other boy is frowning at him now, his brows furrowed under his messy, dark bangs. “No, you’re not,” he says and Draco blanches, hand falling to his side in surprise.
“What?!” Potter near screams, “Why?”
Well… here goes nothing.
“What’s she upset about?” Draco mumbles, watching the girl head for the check out.
Arthur doesn’t even realize he’s not said good-bye to Draco as he hurries after his sons, looking irritated but also resigned to whatever fate awaits him, and Draco doesn’t feel too agitated at the abrupt exit. If anything, he feels relieved. That man was ready to talk his ear off just because Draco had scoffed. Once. He really hoped he wouldn’t run into him again…
Hermione takes her time, reading over the instructions in full three times before beginning, slowly doing everything as carefully as possible. Draco also reads back over the instructions, but then begins flipping through the book and writing on his notes, marking down the purpose of each ingredient so he can hopefully get a better feel for everything. This IS a double class and they’ll be in here for two periods, so he has time to spare.
“WHAT?!” Max’s incredulous voice comes over the radio, sudden and flabbergasted. “Please tell me you’re joking!”
“Oh, I’m gonna puke,” Theodore definitely mumbles.
Longbottom, while replanting some shrub that changes colors depending on what type of water it is fed, had asked Draco if he had any insider tips on casting the Patronus. Despite being more intune with his magic without his hand-me-down wand, Longbottom was still a mess and could only form a non-corporeal Patronus, still.
The Order had finally arrived.
“I am merely being honest,” Draco says pleasantly, smirking when he hears the Muggle groan.
“I wish facts could change more minds,” Luna says, sounding wistful even for her, “But they do not.”
The stars are beautiful, Draco realizes despite everything, and for a while he just stands there, staring and breathing. He looks over the constellations they’d just learned in class before his eyes land on Draco, his constellation, and his chest tightens.
Nothing, no reason at all, can Draco come up with for Moody’s behavior. Fang, Draco knows, buries bones all over the place, and Draco is sure that is what anyone would think if they came across this freshly dug up dirt, but this isn’t Fang. This is a Hogwart’s professor.
Harry’s smile is devious and sharp as he points his wand skyward. Draco’s ears flatten, already knowing what to expect. “
Mrs Nubble doesn’t write another letter, too frightened to do much of anything else that day, and instead joins the rest of the house’s residents on their chores, attempting to get her mind away from the events.
“You here for Bulgaria or Ireland?” Thomas questions.
Now he just felt ill.
He never finds out what Max meant when they mentioned Potter, since Max rambles for nearly two hours until they have to bid each other good-bye and turn off their radios.
“I am resolute, strong, and I have had many, many years to steel myself to the evils of man. I can last a short while more,” Huang-Jun assures, but it doesn’t do much to calm Draco down. Apparently, it doesn’t do much for Weasley, either…
It also didn’t help that everyone apparently loved Potter, showering him with gifts and affections he didn’t deserve.
“Quit that,” Granger pushes his hand off her shoulder, but she’s clearly smiling from humor. She attempts to return to her work, but a few minutes in realizes she has more to say. “I never thought you would turn out like this, Malfoy,” she says softly. “You’re still a complete prat, but I’m glad you grew up so much. I actually don’t entirely hate your company, anymore.”
a failure,” Draco drawls and Weasley is quick to steam in fury, which only makes Draco smirk in amusement, “You gave Slytherin so many points. I even came up with a song, do you want to hear it?”
“I doubt my professors would understand that,” Longbottom mumbles and Draco can’t hold back his flinch. The image of his godfather immediately came to mind and his dreadful treatment of the cowardly Gryffindor. All Gryffindors were on Snape’s shitlist, but Harry and Longbottom especially.
“Does he want backup?”
“But Uncle Severus, I wanted to meet my cousin.”
“Nope!” Terry calls brightly from up at the counter, apparently having heard their conversation. “That’s tattoos and body piercings! You could drop by Claire’s Accessories if you really wanted to get your ears pierced.”
~ ~ ~
Draco still manages to catch up to Potter, though, ignoring the strange cold that permeates into his very core. Side by side with Potter, both have their hands stretched out for the Snitch. It is
“That is…” Draco has to take a breath, because that one had hit him more than he’d expected. He didn’t want anyone dead, he wanted his society as productive as it could be. Just like his father was always saying. “That is not it at all what I want, you are being ridiculous. These people want to tear down--”
Draco only just manages to stay upright, but he stumbles a few feet back as the sonic boom of the spell erupts out and blasts the door forcefully into the office. The handle and its lock, however, are all that remains, still attached to the wall with splintered wood hanging off of it.
“Thanks, Draco,” he says, then steps forward to press a kiss to Draco’s cheek. Weasley makes a show of audibly gagging, and Draco throws an Earworm Jinx at him, sticking “Rise Above” by Black Flag into his head.
“Yes ma’am,” Draco suddenly finds it quite hard to speak, but the smile on his face is probably far too large to keep any dignity. Eve shakes her head at him and mouths the word, ‘disgusting.’ He glares back at her smirking face, but doesn’t feel ashamed at all. He would need to get a handle on his reactions, but they hardly felt wrong.
Draco doesn’t know when Minister Fudge arrived at Hogwarts and he honestly doesn’t care. The fool of a man had gone and gotten a dementor to suck out Barty Crouch Jr.’s soul, effectively making him useless as evidence of You-Know-Who’s return. They’re best piece to the puzzle: gone.
He enters the infirmary. Madam Pomfrey is already awake, eying the wall in the direction most of the noise can be heard from, but she looks to him as he enters. He makes a show of moaning, complaining about stomach pains, and while she shows concern, there is also a suspicious twist to her lips.
Draco’s brows furrow, and then he looks down at the card to read it.
“Oh, Draco!” the bushy-haired girl cries and Draco absently pats her back, still very dizzy.
Draco has an envelope too, thicker than Hermione’s because it has three, separate letters in it; one from both the Nubbles, one from Frederick, and one from Ada. The one from his foster parents is very straight forward, cold congratulations on his placement and demands to be informed on his schooling so far. Frederick’s is nearly identical, if longer winded and more self-important. Ada’s is entertaining, at least, listing how they’re all doing and how much she hates gardening since she’s sure those dang snakes are watching her and she doesn’t even know where one of them is, certain it will attack her in her sleep.
“Eric, don’t name the dead bird,” Draco sighs at the same moment Max groans.
“The girls look like they could kick my ass,” Theodore Nott says, sounding awed, and Blaise Zabini snorts.
“I will not allow anyone to hold any power over me with a single name. I take back the ownership of the word, much as many minorities have done in the past.”
Draco looked around at all the boxes, eyes sparkling. Were these the wands, then? Did he just grab one? He glances back and sees McGonagall has taken a seat near the front door, brushing down her robes then folding her hands into her lap. She seems to be waiting for something and Draco opens his mouth to ask what he should do when he’s cut off.
