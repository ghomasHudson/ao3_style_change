Draco had never had to put these actions into words like this. He'd never had to justify why he was doing it. It just
"Your hair is pink."
With merely a frown, Harry hopped up onto the counter behind him. He swung his legs back and forth while contemplating her offer. "I don't know, Hermione…. I don't want to impose on your family."
Ultimately, he supposed, that was why he had ended up at that bar again. He had tasted the poisoned fruit and he wanted more, even if it may truly be the end of him.
It was no longer just a threat. Draco really was losing Shea. He was losing him and there would be nothing left to lean on. Not with Harry still being so committed to his 'stable' life. The skipping of his heart accelerated. He felt like it would beat right out of his chest. Bracing himself for what was to come. Silent tears dangerously close to breaking past his eyelashes. "Do you want me to move out?" he whispered, unconfident in the stability of his full voice. Several fears clenched his stomach at once, ranging from losing his ability to see Scorpius whenever he wanted to the loneliness of truly having no one again. He felt like he was going to be sick.
All Draco wanted to do was stop the boy. To shout at him and smash his hands against the counter. To tell him that couldn't be enough of an explanation. But in the end, he watched him go. He couldn't find the words to keep him there, mostly because his head was full of nothing but static.
in a dream. And that dream felt so fragile, like it could abruptly end at any moment. Their presence in this house was hanging precariously in the balance. Most every person he'd come into contact with wanted them gone. All except Draco.
his dream
Once she finally chose to break that silence, Narcissa laughed. Razor-sharp and an insult waiting to happen; it took everything Harry had in him to not take a cautionary step backwards from it and her. "Oh, thank goodness!" she exclaimed, quite the opposite of how he'd expected her to react. If Malfoy was any indication to his family, excitement didn't seem to be in their genes. "I was so worried for a moment there about our food becoming unbearably spicy." She laughed again, the insult even closer to the surface this time. "I have a very delicate palate," she whispered, leaning in for extra effect. Like if she said it that way or defended herself, she wasn't being racist.
In the end, everything currently plaguing him would be fine. His fight with Shea seemed to be solved for the moment. He had permission to keep seeing the man whose heady hands held him together. Eventually they would solve the case…or they wouldn't and he would have to find a way to live with that. Astoria would die eventually. Her heart would give out one way or another, whether she took that power into her own hands or not. Scorpius would be okay. He was weak but also very strong-willed. And Teddy….
When Draco tried to pull away, it dawned on Harry that he was frozen in shock and made a pathetic keening noise while kicking into action. His hands formed fists around Draco's lapels, tugging him closer. He parted Draco's lips with his own, feeling goddamn euphoric at the sweet taste of him. This moment, this rush of his hips careening forward and his whole body flushing with intense passion, was nothing like Harry had imagined. It was rushed and frantic, biting and scratching and pulling and demanding. He couldn't fucking breathe but he didn't fucking
That Mark upon his forearm, that one bad decision made under fear and duress, had cost Draco almost everything a human being should be afforded in life. It followed him around, feeling as if it were hanging over his head instead of fading away on his skin. He couldn't get a damn job because of it. Well…he could have gotten
"That's not what I meant," Ron mumbled, almost tucking himself down into his dinner as he shoveled it into his mouth. The tips of his ears were bright red; Harry had surely embarrassed him. It was just too easy and too satisfying. "Just forget it…."
They sat in a small silence once again, though this time it seemed far more awkward. Every fear they had about how they were raising the boy was being called into question. And if any of this ever went public…. "We'll keep an eye on it, Harry. It'll be okay. It could be just…a phase. Or maybe he isn't trying to cause any actual harm. We will figure it out. I promise. Nothing means more to me than that boy." Harry nodded, reaching through the fire to scrub a hand over his weary eyes. "What else?" Charlie asked. "What's happened with you today?"
But now, here he was in Harry's office, talking about privacy. To him, it sounded ridiculous.
It appeared to be the first of June, forced upon him in full, spectacular force.
"It's not his," Draco snapped, absolutely no mirth in his own face. "We tested it. The blood is…the semen isn't."
Still hesitant, Teddy gave the barest of smiles. He descended the stairs, rubbing at his eyes with a stream of soft yawns. Every bit of extra energy exerted only managed to exacerbate his exhaustion.
"Funny," Harry sighed, tugging at his beard to test the length. It had never been so long. He probably looked like a madman…. "How do you know where I live?"
told her to walk out in front of that bus. The other children said they saw him whispering to her a moment before. They said he looked evil….
With a resigned sigh, Draco walked back towards Harry's office. Sealing himself inside and allowing himself to breathe normal for the first time since this case fell into their laps. Even though it was followed by immense guilt, he felt a definite ease from being done with the whole mess.
"Hey, it's your adult life. Navigate it how you want," his father said through a chuckle. "But, seriously, Harry," he continued in a more somber tone, "should I be concerned?"
"Oh." After those fights they'd had, she was clearly expecting him to blindly take his partner's side. Which he was sure spoke to what kind of person he truly was. "Oh, Harry...that's awful." Hermione stared down at an unknown spot on her desk for an awkward moment. "You know, it really wasn't your place to get involved, right?" she finally stated, still not looking at him.
," Harry groaned, secretly glad Draco missed the reference. He hoped he'd remember to show Draco the films one day. But, mostly, he just hoped for more moments like this in his life. "But that's beyond the point entirely. I just don't want to do anything wrong. I want people to continue to be proud of me. Can't you tell me how to do that?"
. Even if that something was too rough and too quick and only left him feeling emptier.
"But they weren't supposed to transfer, I swear! At least, that's not what I wanted. I just wanted the dreams to
Harry looked up from the hole he was attempting to stare into the sidewalk, biting his lip and softening as he took in Draco standing in front of him. The Knight Bus was gone and they were alone — which was all Harry had been dreaming of for the last day and a half. But he couldn't hardly focus on his need to surge up and pull Draco down into a mind-melting kiss right now. He was too stuck in the idea of the past. "Does she have someone to take care of her?" Harry finally asked.
"I listen to you. It's important to me that you know that."
This wasn't something Theo had ever done before. He was insanely aware of this from the moment their feet hit the hard wood of his bedroom floor. He had never taken a bloke (or a woman, for that matter) home with the express intent of having sex. It wasn't something he had foreseen himself doing.
Harry had earned that last slice of treacle tart fair and square. And the heart-stopping kiss as soon as their feet hit the ground.
A well-timed knock at the door saved Harry the embarrassment of digging for an answer. Not that he was sure Hermione was expecting one. She knew better. "At least consider it a bit longer," she mumbled and practically stormed off to answer it.
Shea left when he was finished, leaving his dirty dishes and still not saying a single word. Draco watched him go with that familiar ache in the pit of his stomach. He was grateful the man only went upstairs instead of leaving the house. Instead of slamming the front door resolutely behind himself. But having him here in the house felt like there was a hammer still about to drop at any moment. The tides were shifting and he was hopeless to change them. This time, it was out of his control. It felt terrible.
the dream. It was the dream…
With a sigh, Draco stopped outside of the Emergency Wing door. As much as he didn't want to obey that request, he knew he was in no place to deny Harry something like that. His world was shifting and changing around him and he was helpless to stop it. The most Draco could probably offer in support was to let him have a moment with his guilty husband. Maybe he could get at least a few answers to the millions of questions that must be plaguing his mind. "I'll wait here. He needs to come with us when you're done."
what I'm being accused of, after all."
-'…. Okay, never mind that one…. That's not a good example."
"Don't worry; we will find some."
Harry nodded slowly, steeling his nerves one last time. "I would love to speak to your mum, rules aside. Can you get her?"
The heat and anger radiating off of Draco was palpable. And Charlie seemed rather smug about that. "Take care of yourself, Potter," Draco managed through gritted teeth. He didn't even try to conceal the gentle lingering of his fingertips upon Harry's as anything innocent. "Owl me when you're feeling better. I would like to try to see my cousin again before he leaves for school."
Overall, Draco was…
spread like a virus. Scandal always sold well and travelled fast upon the lips of those who needed the validation which came with its shock.
"Can't he and I want the same thing?"
"I think we're forgetting," Hermione cut in, her voice dripping in rationality, "that Malfoy is more likely to hex Harry than to allow himself to be completely ambushed with a non-consensual kiss."
Charlie's lips were locked with Harry's, mumbling questions in between every tentative fuck and lingering kiss. Inquiring about their happiness. About Harry's happiness. The name 'Draco Malfoy' lingering just below each word as a standard to live up to. Every different way he asked had Harry more and more sure that his husband knew about the affair. About the stolen weekends and the way Harry was slowly being torn apart after the last few days.
Draco inhaled deeply before nodding again. "Welcome to the Equality Centre," he drawled, very likely mocking Harry. "How can I be of assistance to the so dearly revered, great and spectacular Harry Boy-and-Man-Who-Lived Potter?" Okay, not just likely — he
happy. He was too good of a man to both Harry and Teddy to be labeled with such a harsh accusation. He hadn't done anything wrong. Very simply, Charlie just might not have been the one.
Glassy-eyed, Draco looked up at the shocked utterance of his surname. And sure as day, there stood Potter. So close to the still-fellating couple, he could likely feel their body heat. He seemed unfazed and even managed a smile. None of this quite registered as real. In this state, the world was clouded and distant. Draco was sufficiently checked out. So…he smiled back. His guard completely down. "Saint Potter…come for a shag, eh?"
Somewhere in a realm so far removed from Harry's current headspace, someone cleared their throat. He forced himself to come up for air, putting a fraction of space between his lips and Draco's. For a moment, all he could handle was to blink dumbly as he returned back to his body.
It was suddenly a very real fact that Harry didn't even know the man he had married. This was a side of Charlie he had never seen. This was six years of his life down the drain. This was something he could never get back and something he could never fix. It was a stain on Teddy's wellbeing and mental health and something Harry had walked right into his life.
," he insisted, sounding weary.
He said it so plainly, like it didn't even matter. Like it was just a thing he had done. Draco choked on his whisky, far too aware of the incremental inch that hand slid further up his leg. He didn't respond because he didn't know how. He didn't move because…what if that hand fell away? So he continued to sit, staring down at the bar, hoping the world would be gracious and just swallow him up already.
Charlie
Not that they were
Harry sighed, rolling his eyes. "Fine," he agreed, and scooted to the edge of the mattress. "I think I've already proven I'm ready to do just about anything for you—" He stopped short, firmly planting his feet on the floor. Allowing himself to feel grounded as he chewed over those words. Surely that wasn't the way he was intending to say that. "For this charade, I mean," he clarified and pushed into a standing position. Even if his head was still swimming and his knees were shaky, it still felt better to be on his feet. And to put some distance between himself and Malfoy. He was going to need space to process all of this.
He could never remember having felt more shattered in his entire life.
"But then suddenly we were in an actual, physical war and all of that seemed petty. All that seemed to matter were the small moments adding up to good or bad. And in the end…I guess you came out heavier on the good side…."
Draco shook his head lazily back and forth. "I have to be at the centre by ten. We're hosting HIV screening this morning and Astoria is already mediating a visit with a girl's parents. I have to set up screens and chairs and…
"Where did you even
"F'ck no, Daddy! You shut up!" Scorpius yelled, loud enough for everyone in the building to hear. He threw his little hands up over Draco's lips with a severely furrowed brow. "You talk enough! It my turn!"
Thankfully, 'cognizant' wasn't exactly in Harry's vocabulary. He smiled and said he was glad they had fun, but otherwise seemed not to notice Teddy literally sweating in his seat. "He's a teenager, you know, so he brushed me off when I asked if he had a good time. Guess I'm just being nosy. He doesn't talk much to Gin and me these days."
"So don't. Stay. Take a personal day and stay home with your family…." Shea's words were soft and inviting. Just the idea of his suggestions made Draco's heart ache with longing.
Despite trying to hold himself together, Harry dissolved into a fit of uncontrollable chuckles. Which, given his precarious emotions, eventually turned into full-on laughter, bringing tears to his eyes as he gasped for breath. In the inevitable end, those tears flowed out of him on wrenching sobs. All of the fear and anger and betrayal he had been holding in swallowed up every rational thought he had, bringing him to shake with those sobs until he felt he had nothing left to cry.
to him?
, if you're honest with me, I'll promise you right now…I'll forget it all after the week is up. My only interest here is doing the job I was paid for."
It was a lot to process. Too much. And Harry was honestly not sure if he thought Astoria was making a mistake any longer. If what she said was true... "Why now?" he whispered while raking his fingers through his hair. "Why are you taking Scorpius away from him after over three years?"
Harry had been relieved that they were on the same page. That Bill knew what he'd done so the words didn't have to be spoken aloud. But now he was a starting to feel like they were on two different wavelengths. Feeling that anger and resentment crawl back under his skin. "What?" he pushed out.
"Sorry, what?"
Harry Potter hadn't been a part of the plan.
As everyone dispersed to mingle or graze over the snack table once more, Harry made a straight beeline for Draco and pulled him aside by the elbow. Once they were off to a more secluded corner of the events room, Draco gingerly loosened Harry's accidentally tight grip and raised a brow. "No need to manhandle me, Potter," he chided, his tone light despite his accusation. "What did you think about Sparks?"
"Isn't that something you want, too?"
Harry, thrown by the abruptness of the break in silence, looked up from the pillow to Malfoy's face. His forehead was pressed against the glass of the window, his breath visibly gathering and melting away in a rhythmic cycle. "I, uh…." Harry frowned and cleared his throat. "Yeah, of course. My roommate — my best friend — I wanted her to know where I was so she wouldn't worry. And I did tell my parents. Well, my dad…my mum might not remember my saying anything…."
The answer was so matter-of-fact, it nearly stunned Draco. He blinked, once out of surprise, before recovering and looking down at his glass. He finished off the rest of his drink then stood with the intention of getting another. Until his knees gave way and he stumbled forward, that is. A strong arm caught him around the middle and there was a sure hand on his back.
Well he wasn't sure what he would have done. But there
Theo nodded and took the seat across from Potter. He hadn't been invited to. He was sure that invitation would never come. If he wanted this, he had to take it. He had to exert gentle force to get what he deserved.
"I'm surprised you didn't bring the dogs," Draco said, the first to break that strangled tension between them. He wore a simple, half-smile that just didn't quite have life to it.
my classmates? Because I don't remember seeing your ugly ass there on the frontline!"
"The one Teddy and I painted for you a couple of years ago. It was a father's day gift. It's red with a rather technicolor blue dragon. The weird, bright yellow handle is always the first thing to go when it hits the floor."
"You're thinking she's a terrible mother." Harry cringed as that thought had crossed his mind. Malfoy must have noticed as he nodded while crawling onto the bed himself. He matched Harry's folded position, seated in a mirrored pose with a good foot's distance between them. "I bet your parents always told you that you could be anything….
"Do you have kids?" Ricardo snapped back, inching towards anger himself.
If Ernie Macmillan were truly the good guy Potter wanted him to be, he wouldn't have cheated.
than this. Or he thought he was. But something about Potter was proving to be his weakness, it seemed. No matter how carefully he was trying to pick his words, they just weren't cooperating. "Everything," Theo whined, groaning at the confession.
And he would, indeed, be desperate.
The illusion of Malfoy's restraint broke, fueled by his magic to crack the mug which had only a moment ago been cradled in Harry's hands. Searing hot coffee dripped through, pooling out onto the antique mahogany. For a moment, Harry allowed himself to gather his thoughts while watching the puddle grow. This wasn't going to be so simple to explain. He didn't even know where to start….
Harry had yet to figure out what he wanted.
Astoria shrugged, flashing him a brief pained smile. "I met someone. Again, I know you won't understand...but this man could be a better father. He could be someone I wouldn't worry about leaving my son alone with. I've wrestled with this for some time now and I since we're now engaged..." It was the first time Harry had noticed the flash of a ring upon her finger. "I need to give my son the father he deserves. Draco isn't that man. I'm sorry, but his time is up."
"Albus! James!" Teddy laughed, scrambling to his feet to try and help. "Down! Get
made Bill bring him home while I was in hospital. So, that's on you. So are all of the other times it's happened. Because it's happened several times. And Teddy remembers every single one of them. Even the one you tried and failed to erase from his memory.
. Just as leaving the apartment and actually going to a gay club didn't really feel right. That's where men met each other. It wasn't something he was delusional about. He knew his loneliness was entirely his own fault. He wasn't trying. And he probably wasn't trying hard enough at these jobs, either. He hadn't exactly stayed on long enough at any of them to really know if he liked them or not.
Draco's brow furrowed and he leaned back against the locked door. It was a bit weird. But still thrilling. More thrilling that watching those dancers out there. His eyes falling shut and head falling back, Draco grunted – neither a 'yes' or a 'no'. His thoughts swam in gin, all slippery and impossible to grasp. Except for the repeated mantra that it was his goddamn birthday….
"Time's up," Draco said just as Harry popped the last button on his shorts, letting them drape slackly across his hips. Draco grinned lasciviously, surging across the mattress and capturing Harry in a breath-stealing kiss. That feeling of wholeness returned, lingering between them as Draco teased Harry's shorts the rest of the way off his hips and put them in a matched state of undress.
"It's really no problem," he muttered, allowing the flowers to fall back to his side.
"Drama, indeed. The boy is teething. Our new neighbors always seem to be at the house, asking questions and trying to make nice. Work has been…. This latest case is a lot to handle. I'm fucking exhausted…." He sighed heavily before letting loose with another deep, guttural noise. "That's it…."
There hadn't even
"Anyone?" Harry questioned, also taking a step forward, awkwardness forgotten. "Where do you keep them?"
," Draco corrected.
That stubble grazing his chin. Sure, practised hands exploring his body. The promise of filth on Potter's shaking breath.
Or, at least enough to last him fifteen days and counting without the real thing.
Harry grinned shyly and tucked his face back into his arms. "I came, like, four times."
was. Love wasn't superficial. Love wasn't fakeable. Harry was a firm believer in love and the beauty of its spontaneity. In its natural ability to make magic a real and tangible thing. But this? He didn't believe in this or any of it working. It was fake. It was a setup. And a week of this? A week where he would most likely have to share a bed with a stranger? Well, that wasn't something he had any sort of faith in. "I didn't agree to this," Harry muttered, pushing up from his chair. "You didn't tell me it was for a
give the Draco thing a rest?" Harry snapped, waving his hand in the general direction of the table. "Peel the fucking potatoes.
Draco was actually rather glad this wasn't
In some far-off corner of his perception, Harry was aware of Draco sitting up beside him. "Harry?" Unable to find the energy to answer, Harry remained silent and still. A few moments of measured breathing passed before the pressure returned at his side, a soft sigh tickling his chest hair.
That morning, Harry had been nearly sure about his decision. About getting Teddy into a better environment. About going back to the Ministry as soon as he could to ensure he still had a job. About being single for the rest of his life because, Merlin, that just sounded so much easier. But Draco was here now. Draco had such sweet things to promise. And Draco felt safe and right, just as he had the first time around. Everything changed when he was around. The world shifted and molded around him in ways Harry could never understand. But this time, he wasn't complaining. He wasn't planning to ever complain again. This was what he needed. What
"Draco…."
." Groaning, Harry lifted his head to meet Ron's embarrassment full-on. "I know I've said you can tell me anything, but I lied. Okay? You've put enough filthy images of Malfoy in my head and I would like you to shut up now."
What if he
"Did you actually get a lunch break today?" Draco asked, finally breaking the long moment of silence Harry had left between them. He didn't even look up from his book.
"Bye, Tater!" Teddy called, momentarily halting Mashed Potato's progress. Harry rushed the dog along before meeting them down in the grass.
Only once Harry was well and sure the Minister had left the building — that little tinkling of the bell over the doorway filling him with immense reassurance — did Harry turn his gaze back to the office. Draco still stood beside the desk, watching Harry with a sort of bemused expression. Harry realised he was waiting with annoying patience and too vividly remembered his reason for even being there. His pent-up bravado had dissipated with the last few flustered seconds, allowing all of those questions to once again take him over like a plague. "Er…was that about Athena's threats at the Ministry?" he finally asked, taking slow and measured steps back into the office.
"You know, Harry, I particularly like this bit here," Hermione mused over a bite of her dinner later that night. "'
Something was wrong.
"I've found you gain a lot of perspective as you get older," Harry started, cheeks flushing at just the idea of what he was about to admit. "Like…I guess somewhere under all of the anger and sneers, there was always an obsession. For you, I mean. Which I know comes as no surprise. I did practically stalk you throughout our sixth year." He forced a sideways smile, gaze trained on his twisting hands. He hadn't realised just how nervous he really was to admit all of this until that moment. "But somewhere along the way, that obsession turned? Like when we were just kids, I had to know where you were and what you were doing because I undeniably had a hero complex and wanted everything and everyone to be safe.
He'd never seen Scorpius up close, only in the glimpses he'd been allowed from afar. Well, and in photographs…the few Draco had of his son. The boy was much smaller than he had thought. Then again, he didn't know much about children. Was this average size for a three-year-old? The boy, peeking through the doorway, was grinning with glee. This was clearly the outcome he had been hoping for. "Harry?" he questioned gleefully. Even though they had never been so close, the boy clearly recognized him. Harry was counting that as a mark in his favor.
to Potter since his trial when he thanked him for speaking up in favor of the Malfoys being acquitted of their war crimes. He hadn't pursued the way his dreams made him feel. There was absolutely no justification to the jealousy and anger and betrayal coursing through his veins.
Harry kept the night's events in mind as he pushed his fingers deep into Draco's hair, that same feeling of harmony washing over him again. Draco's skin felt like his own — alive and open and begging for completion. The hesitation was still there underneath it all, but with that oneness pulsing through him it just felt silly to him now.
Before his parents could see, Draco excused himself. He grabbed the newspaper and ran to his room, literally throwing himself down onto the bed while pushing a scream into the mattress.
The public could not so easily forgive what followed their eventual breakup. The instant the Weasley girl announced her hard-won position with the Holyhead Harpies, the pair was over. And that was the final straw Draco needed to focus less on who he bedded and more on who Potter was spending his nights with.
What he was doing to the boy wasn't fair. It wasn't right. And it might very well come back to bite them all in the ass later. He was already hurting. They had yet to figure out why. Shea, through a mess of regretful tears, had lamented about failing him. And the anguish on his face when he was dragged back home…. No stable child wore a look so heartbreaking. No stable child looked at a relative with that kind of torment in their eyes….
Turning to his other side for what felt like the hundredth time, Teddy tried to close his eyes again. Trying to pretend like they were at home. Like this was any other night in Harry's own bed.
Draco's response…well, it wasn't exactly a
Real talk for a minute - some of you may have noticed that I haven't posted the last few days as I promised. First of all, I feel so so so bad about this, trust me when I say I've been agonizing over falling behind. But, as you all know, life does go on outside of fandom. Basically, I made the leap to reach out to a fertility clinic and have since then been working on paperwork and obsessing over getting back into the swing of all of that crap. I've stressed myself into a spot where I'm not able to focus on writing and I hate it. But I am trying! For now, here's the next chapter and I do hope to be able to get the next few out soon. I love the story I've created and want to see it through to the end.
"Just fuck me, Potter," he all but demanded. His instruction was met with a long, languid kiss and the prodding tip of Potter's cock at his entrance. There were no more words of discernable worth from that point. Nothing save for Draco's keening "Fuck" and Potter's grunt of satisfaction as he worked to seat himself within the man below. Once he was fully buried, Draco's hands desperately pulling him in by his arse cheeks (which were so plump, they were

to forget.
That ridiculous hair was blowing in the cold wind, bringing a grin to Theo's lips. He was…adorable. Of course Malfoy fell so hard for him. "I don't think any person would be stable in your shoes," Theo chuckled, catching Potter's elbow and guiding him down an alleyway. "Do you trust me?" he asked in the dark.
"Why were you staring at me?" he asked quickly, head lifting to see Draco standing across the counter from him once again. Not looking like he had a single intention to leave.
Teddy was waiting for Draco.
"Please don't elaborate."
The girl's mother came into the waiting room wearing a shining grin. Harry instantly thought good news and jumped from his seat. "Is it over?" he asked in a whisper, reaching tenderly for the woman's hands. "How is he?"
thinking about it. The words were stuck in Harry's head. Repeating over and over on a haunting loop. The last nine years of his life kept flashing through his mind with every repetition. From the first time Draco had said those words to now. And just how much their meaning had evolved since then.
. And, oh…he would be so proud of me…."

In retrospect, Harry had to know convincing Malfoy to actually sit down and explain anything wasn't going to be so simple. Getting him to
' smile on her soft and pleasant face.
Before he could process where he was going, Harry found himself crossing the threshold to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. It was close to the centre and the most comforting place in his subconscious. Once he saw Ron smiling warmly behind the checkout counter, he felt affirmed in his decision and shuffled over to him.
Making a musing noise, Draco delicately picked the cup up with only three fingers and took a long, slow drink. "And your parents? What do they do?"
Settling into a bar stool at the counter, Teddy chirped a soft laugh. Apprehension still hung in every one of his limbs. "Dad likes ice cream, too. We should go get him." With how
"And to top all of that off…something is wrong with Teddy. Which is not my fault…or even my problem, as he's not my son. But I think he's scared of something. Or someone. And since he wouldn't tell me what it is, my mind is just running rampant with disturbing ideas. The worst part is, I don't think he wants Harry to know. I don't think he wants anyone to know. He won't talk about it. So on top of the depressing shit show that today was, I've had that on my conscience. I'm holding a secret back from him and it won't keep gnawing at me. Every time I look at him, I feel like I should tell him. But I don't think I have that right.
One week was his limit. Harry couldn't handle the silent strain on their relationship any longer. He couldn't let this phantom sit just in the corner of their vision any longer. He needed it exposed.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but smiled. "Come along, Harry. Just be prepared, it's not much of a tour."
Laughing politely, Deacon adjusted in his seat. "It is a bit of a known fact, yes. That is such a beautiful gesture, but you see…I need you to help us work a case."
With his head swimming as it was, none of those words made sense. Harry tried his best not to frown or falter. He forced a coy smile Malfoy's way, head quirking in a way he hoped asked, "
"Whoa, Malfoy, look at you!" he heard someone — the Weasley girl, he was sure — exclaim. "Well done, mate."
Wasn't it?
"What are you doing here?" Draco eventually asked, shattering the stilled enchantment around them.
"What's a
Obeying the command, Harry took the seat across from Draco. He extended his hand with a shaky smile, once again feeling as if he'd just walked into a job interview. "Harry Potter," he stated, doing his best to smile through every other invading thought.
Harry was still laughing, but that gaze on him brought about a shaky tone to it. As if the memory wasn't embarrassing enough…. "Er, yeah…. No, yeah, I do know you. I worked at the coffee shop on Conduit. I had to remake your drink like seven times…."
What if he told Draco how he was starting to see their friendship?
With a delicate
He watched Draco for those tells again, desperate to know what was coming before he had to come to terms with it. But Draco had steeled himself and truly gave nothing away now, seeming more awake by the second. There was no warning to his explanation, not that any warning would have made it any easier to process.
It was a path paved exclusively for Harry Bloody Potter.
"I left a glass by your bed," Harry sighed, rubbing the boy's back as he steered him back towards the mattress.
Every time Draco had to explain some new magic

This was the first day Draco was allowed a moment alone with his son. When he'd come for his usual Sunday visit, Harry waiting at the end of the drive, Astoria had pushed a small backpack into his arms with a warning not to 'fuck this up'. She warned him the consequence was never seeing his son again. She warned him four times before allowing Scorpius out the door.
"That would depend on what you mean by
"On second thought, don't answer that," he backpedalled. "Forget I even asked."
," Malfoy snapped, lying back again. "No, that's very much the right word, Potter, because you have indeed
he had felt earlier, having his godfather between them would certainly help. As much as he didn't want to wake him. As much as he knew Harry could use the rest.
Harry wished he could say he was one-hundred-percent certain from the beginning. He wouldn't feel so slimy if he had.
Much to both Ron and Hermione's constant disappointment, Harry had never seen a need to put up wards on his flat. He figured enough people had tried to kill him in the past that there really couldn't be many left with a grudge against him. He gave Draco permission to leave as he pleased and leaned back against the wall to watch him finish lacing his shoes.
Once he was sure he knew where he was going with his brave display, he lowered his own voice and quickly closed the distance between them again. "This meant something to you."
has something to feel guilty about?"
Before he had even dared to look, Draco was already aware of how he would feel about the man Potter was kissing. Finding out the identity to those lips was only bound to make those feelings worse. Not that he had any right to. He hadn't so much as
Harry couldn't remove his eyes from every inch of exposed skin. Creamy and shining in the barest moonlight. His knees shaky, he stood and threaded their fingers. "But I want to…."
," Draco said resolutely, reaching for and squeezing Harry's hand gently. "I'm sure psychologically, that paints me as superbly fucked up, but I'm very proud of knowing what I believe in. And I believe in you."
"Thanks…." This stupid thing Harry was about to do was suddenly
Back home, his selections had been limited. The only other boys 'like him' in his year had paired off early. So when they moved to London, Harry felt he was ill-prepared. He'd never even had a boyfriend, let alone done all the things men his age wanted from him. He didn't know how to date…so he made quite a few vividly permanent mistakes.
, Harry thought, his mind whirring with too much information and certainly not enough answers. "You own the building?" he tried.
Nothing compared to that moment. Nothing came close to how Harry felt with Charlie filling him so full she couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. Couldn't say a damn thing but to repeat his approval over and over and over….
"And there's food in the cupboards?"
"I've tried to move on from you," Draco whispered. His words were steady, like he'd poured over them for too many endless nights. "Perhaps, I haven't tried hard enough. I could have worked harder to…to find someone else. There has to be someone else out there who could love me better, right?" He paused, his hand passing over his mouth while he chose his words. "But somehow, all my thoughts come back to you."
And yet so wrong.
"No," Draco mumbled back, his own voice still full of the shake Shea lacked. "But I told him I loved him. It was the first time I've said it to him in seven years. The first time be heard it, anyway. It doesn't count when he's asleep or when I know he can't hear me…. And I held him. And I…kissed him. And somehow…that time felt different than all of the others since his wedding. It snapped something inside of me. I can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop thinking about
Ron nodded slowly and reached out to steal a cake from the package. They both chewed in silence, Harry with unmatched desperation as he worked to fill a void. "The charm still picked it up, Harry, even if the drug test didn't." Ron sighed, taking a moment to breathe and pick at his food. "Where were you tonight?" he finally dared to ask.
"She forgot me, too, earlier."
"No, thanks," Harry chuckled through a tight grin, hoping it came across as a good-natured joke instead of unfiltered snark. He stepped away from the desk and over to her in three long strides, extending his hand with an easy smile like a well-trained celebrity. "Forgive me if we've already met. You do look familiar, but I can't quite place a name."
to be okay now…."
Harry's head just hit the pillow, ready to put one of those fantasies to the test, when he was viciously jarred from the beginning haze. He was already half-hard, solidifying this as the
change in him at all?"
something he just barely had and absolutely cherished. The anger undoubtedly coming from Harry once he heard the noise they were making and busted in. Losing Harry for real and for good if things went as badly as they could. And where would that leave Draco? The weight of death again heavy on his hands. Alone. Most assuredly isolating himself and making terrible choices. Again.
The world returned and along with it came the guilt. The knowledge that this wasn't how things should go. Harry opened his mouth to answer, finding he didn't have one. He hadn't intended to come here. He hadn't intended anything that happened tonight. And yet, here he was, and there were consequences to this decision. Some were mercifully far off, a problem for the light of day. But this, the tension between them, was something he had to deal with now. "You were so nice to me," Harry slurred, his words too honest for his lack of stability. "Earlier," he felt the need to clarify. "At breakfast?"
It was McClain's turn to snort in derision. "That
Teddy nodded, pointing towards the ceiling. "He and Miss Astoria are changing Scorpius upstairs." He raked fingers through his hair, grinning back at Harry for a split second before turning back to Draco. "How was work?"
Harry frowned, settling himself on the bench at the foot of the bed. This way he didn't have to look at Malfoy and he could still gaze about the room. From this position, he was offered a perfect view of bookshelves cluttered with various classic titles and an innumerable amount of trophies. "They didn't mention a number," he said quietly, feeling like he had failed some sort of test in this mission. "Your grandfather asked how much it would take and I shot him down. And…and that's mostly it…." He left out the parts where he sassed back and especially the too-real mention of responsibilities he could never understand or fit into. Whatever that all meant….
"Not if there's nothing to find."
Draco finally looked up to meet Harry's eyes with nothing but truth in his gaze. Harry was left speechless from that declaration. And that steely gaze only worsened that effect. An overwhelming urge to lean in closer took over his consciousness. It screamed for him to kiss Draco — that this was the perfect moment. They were pouring their hearts out to one another, as close as they had ever been. This could be their moment to rekindle that roaring flame they once had from the smoldering ashes.
Although he startled at first, Draco eventually relaxed his posture and a laugh even bubbled up from his throat. "That's still not much of an answer, is it? Not the one you were hoping for. The short of it is, my marriage is a sham. Run to your friends with that if you'd like; I would love to see my family name gossiped over and disgraced publicly over this whole ridiculous ordeal."
Even with that stiff atmosphere between them, they actually worked rather well together. It was like the lack of comfort propelled them into being productive. Or…it might also have been that they were just
Malfoy's statement was simple and, in a way, it did make sense. He essentially hid behind a mask. It was where he felt comfortable. "I didn't know until last week," Harry admitted.
Desperation took the unexpected form of anger and violence. Theo had barely opened the door before Draco was shoving a wand in his face.
Needing a proper distraction, Harry found himself on Luna's doorstep as soon as he could no longer stand his own company. She accepted his dropping by with open arms, guiding him out to her garden. Upon her insistence, he was given a floppy floral hat and a pair of matching gloves. He felt absurdly silly, but in a comforting way. It felt good to panic about something else, even for just one second. Besides, when he compared himself to that fact that Luna gardened nearly stark naked, loosely clothed in a smock and nothing else, he seemed relatively grounded and that feeling did wonders on its own.
And the only thing that perked him back up was seeing Teddy sitting at the table waiting for him. He grinned, falling into a chair beside the boy with a wearied noise.
He sighed softly, leaning in to kiss her forehead gently. "Drink up," he said when he pulled back, pressing the warm mug into her hands. "Can I get you anything else? Are you hungry?" She shook her head slowly and he stood, even though all he wanted was to curl up next to her and beg her to remember him. "Dad and I are out in the kitchen if you want to join us," he added before grabbing his tea and leaving. Closing the door behind him felt final and like a betrayal. Like he was giving up on her.
. "Did I give it?" he breathed, leaning in closer to be heard without having to change his tone. If he spoke any louder, the nerves would have shaken his voice.
Malfoy paused but didn't acknowledge Harry's comment. He merely took a set of deep breaths before continuing in a rush of free consciousness. "Right. There is no beating around the proverbial bush here. My family's fortune was practically founded upon a long-standing tradition of sticking our fingers deep in the most opportune pie. Oftentimes, those pies sit on the greyer side of the legal ledge.
While the phone rang through on the other end, he traced over its computer bits and bobs visible through the clear plastic. A distant Christmas memory flitted through his thoughts as he waited. He'd asked his parents for this very phone when he was sixteen. Not that it would have been of much use to him then. Their house had always had only a single landline hook-up in the kitchen and he never really used it much back then. He'd only ever really felt comfortable calling Hermione, and it was almost always easier just to walk a few streets over to her house than to try and have a private, teenage conversation around his parents.
"Your methods were less than ideal, but thank you anyway for your help earlier," he whispered. Anything louder would have broken the moment. "The article will be great because of you."
As Harry relaxed back in his chair, much surer of what he was about to do, he caught Draco's eye for just once second. Just long enough to catch his wink and triumphant smile.
"In other words, you don't want me to sleep with him. Does the thought make you uncomfortable?"
Leaning into the touch, Harry closed his eyes and exhaled, long and soft. This gentle way in which Draco handled him was still so new. It felt like a wound healing over — still raw beneath the touch, but with the reassurance of renewal. It felt like all of his wayward pieces were slowly stitching back together. It felt like he could literally endure anything for just one more simple caress or kiss.
…I almost killed you…." Sighing heavily, he flipped one picture over, causing the other four to jump and raise their brow. Three-year-old Teddy recovered first, giggling and snuggling closer to his godfather. Looking far less scarred and scared than the other images of his later self.
Draco had never been able to appropriately conjure the image of his father at Azkaban, either. He spent many nights during his sixth year at school trying to do just that. Lucius, so poised and in-control at all times, never seemed the sort to survive well in a cell. The two images just didn't mesh.
"Were you going to tell me?" Harry still couldn't speak at full volume. Not with his dad looking so frail and fragile before him. There was no solidity to their household, especially not in that moment.
From up above, somebody hollered back through their open window, "Nobody cares!" Which, for some reason, was the funniest thing Draco thought he'd ever heard. Luckily, they were paces away from his front steps, because seconds later, he devolved into a fit of laughter so violent he had to sit down.
"Good," Potter answered and finally removed that last finger, leaving Draco feeling emptier than he could have ever rationally explained. In order to distract himself, Draco pushed up onto his elbows. He hungrily watched as Potter once again uncapped the lube, generously coating himself with his verdant eyes locked squarely onto Draco's. The intimacy in that look burned deep into Draco's core, setting even the darkest corners of him alight. Uncomfortable under its weight, Draco averted his eyes to Potter's cock and memorized what he had dreamed about for so long. Memorized its length (not too long, but nothing to be ashamed about), its girth (fuck, was he thick), and the slight curve it took on when at full attention (
This felt like they could start over and finally be happy once again.
Harry allowed himself one more breath in and exhaustively out before he decided his time was up. Still in that darkness, the colours of the flag muddling together against the inside of his eyelids, he spoke what he'd always been afraid to.
happy and in love! She was young and still attending Hogwarts, but she could still be found spending the night at Potter's place in London over breaks during that first year. It was a scandal, but an innocent one. One the public was easily willing to forgive when pictures of the two of them holding hands while strolling down Diagon Alley hit the papers.
was thin. Not just in physique but also in composure with his skin just barely clinging to his hunched bones. Harry hardly recognized his boy anymore. This being shriveled up against the doorframe was no more than a ghoul at this point. Covering his grimace with a smile, Harry quickly stepped around Draco to support Teddy. "Did we wake you?"
Wincing, Draco abandoned his courageous train of thought. Absolutely thrown. "Yes…the
which absolutely broke Harry into a thousand tiny pieces — all Harry could manage for a time was to sit on the edge of his bed. He lost track of how long he stayed there, staring at the spot where Draco used to lay, his mind churning everything over and over — every laugh, every touch, every strange word choice. Once he started, he found he couldn't make it stop. He dissected the last month with intense precision, trying to figure out the clues he'd missed.
Draco's merlot-slicked lips finally quirked into a comfortable smile. "Because I listen, Potter. When you were young, your aunt and uncle couldn't get anyone to watch you for one of their long weekend trips to London, so they had to take you along. For lunch one of those days, you all went to Broadway Market and as a joke, your cousin made you eat pie and mash without telling you what it was. You ended up being allergic to eel. It was an eventful trip, to say the least."
Draco had never been a troubling thing to Teddy. He loved the man like a father. Of which he had far too many, already. But Draco was there before most of those others really made any sense to him. He was there when Teddy was a child, shaping who he grew to be. Those three years were deeply ingrained into his being. They weren't something he could just forget. They were a part of him. And that was comforting.
Even just a second too late here could mean permanently too late.
This was where Draco vowed to start. He didn't want to run. So if he was going to stay, he was going to have to work on fixing his problems instead of masking them. And the boy was his first challenge.
Clearing his throat, Draco finished more solemnly, "In short, my arrangement is a question, Potter." He lifted his chin, attempting to portray a far braver face than he felt. It took every ounce of his strength not to avert his eyes from that imploring sea of crystalline green. "A question which requires a very simple answer. I'll respect whichever one you give.
And Draco didn't doubt that he would. He was just worried as to how that would happen and where they would be left when it did.
Night walks, hand in hand, spent desperately trying to recover from cold sweats and bad dreams. Intimate moments where they worshiped one another's scars – fraught with guilt. Wasted afternoons with Teddy at the park or in Diagon Alley full of giggles and sweet indulgence. Memories Harry held close in private moments, all on display at the most inconvenient of moments.
Draco froze, halting his steps towards the couch. He kept his eyes trained to the floor. There was a new scratch in the hard wood — or was it even new? Had he just never noticed it before? He dragged the toe of his boot along its jagged path and breathed in —
When no reaction came after a long stretch of awkward silence, Draco slowly peeked out through only the small slit of one eye. Harry just…
to be handled), he met Draco's eyes for the go-ahead.
Before Harry had the chance to make up his mind, Draco did so for him. Not knowing if he was about to see that violent side of his partner, Harry flinched in response to Draco's hands on his chest. The coming push was gentle, coaxing instead of forcing him backwards towards the rarely-used loveseat. A great poof of dust clouded the air when he made contact and the wood groaned beneath his clumsy impact.
Being in love with Harry Potter was nothing short of self-inflicted torture. Especially since he had never given a single indication to being anything but straight. Not really. It wasn't really Harry's fault Draco had heard what he wanted to in regards to his invitation to this wedding.
And there it is - the last installment in this part of the series. The next (and likely last installment for real this time) part will be focused on Teddy. I'm not too sure on details on this one yet, but I'm excited to get it going. So look out for that and be sure to please let me know what you thought of this chapter and this work in the series!
Harry made drinks.
"When the hospital releases you, you'll be headed back home. Back to your perfect husband and your amazing godson and your beautiful little home in the country. And I'll stay here and solve this case. It was wrong of me to bring you into this in the first place. It was selfish. I mean…you helped; I can't deny that. But this isn't your place. Your place…isn't at my side. Your place – the one you deserve after everything you've done for our world – is peaceful and full of paperwork. As
"Draco…."
"Bring it," Harry parried with a grin.
Suddenly, ten thousand pounds didn't seem like it would be nearly enough.
But he couldn't. He was scared of what he would hear if he asked. His mind could only conjure the worst. The only possible outcome he could see to this was an ending.
Harry opened the door and the newly transfigured memo rat scuttled off ahead of him down the hall. They followed along behind it, pace much less urgent and soon lost track of the thing. Beside him, Draco was silent but there were obvious gears turning behind his eyes. At least one of them could focus.
Harry Potter thought Draco Malfoy was a hero.
For a moment, Harry merely blinked in surprise, but quickly regained his footing and nodded. "Why, then?"
"I know," Harry said softly, catching the boy before he was inevitably about to say the word 'rules' with that lispy 'r' sound he made. He needed to stay whole and vigilant; he couldn't afford for his heart to melt right there. "You've been told I'm not allowed inside. Your father, too, right?"
The weight of that statement was filled with several expectations that now fell on Harry directly. Draco had fulfilled his end of the bargain. The Evening Prophet had confirmed as much, touting an exclusive about every heinous crime McClain had copped to. And now here he was. It was Harry's turn to decide what he was going to do about it.
Draco watched the man shuffle off, his victory feeling like a double-edged sword.
With a full-body flush, Harry vigorously shook his head. "
"Draco used to drink a lot. When he drank, sometimes things would get violent. Scorpius was born premature and he... Well, he almost didn't make it. That was Draco's turning point and I do honestly believe rehab helped him manage his emotions better. I don't know if he drinks anymore-" Harry tried his best to keep stone-faced, not wanting to betray Draco by giving him away while Astoria surveyed him. She shook her head, waving the thought away. "If he does, then I do hope he's never showed you that side of him.
As nonchalantly as possible, Draco sipped at the mug softly cradled in his hands and stated, "Because, Potter, tomorrow you meet my parents. After dating for near a year, they'll expect you to know me quite well by now."
"He doesn't know
But suddenly, before Harry was ready for it, the door was swinging inward and the man who held Harry's heart so precariously in his hands was standing in front of him. Even rumpled with sleep, he was so heartbreakingly beautiful. All Harry could manage was to breathe the man's name, those five letters soaked in his sins.
Every year, Harry promised himself a change to the one before. And, every year, the entirety of June passed him by like it was just another month in the rotation. Every single fucking year, he cursed himself for his cowardice and drowned himself in self-deprecation.
Harry had already braced himself for what was to come. He knew he was in trouble even before stepping through the front door, having checked his watch religiously as he hurried from street to street. A small voice in the back of his mind told him he should be angry at himself, that he should be beyond these stupid little mistakes. But the night he'd had and the balloon of hope in his chest strangled all rationality in that moment.
The cat was hissing from atop the fridge. Their apartment was in such shit shape that even the damn cat couldn't stand it.
Draco Malfoy never was adept at doing what was good for him. Nor had he ever actually pursued something he thought he actually deserved. He was a coward.
Force
," Draco lied. Draco lied a lot during their sessions. It was counterintuitive to their purpose of meeting, but there were things he just couldn't share with her. With
. People like Rita Skeeter, they think we all care what you're up to every hour of every day, but we don't. Nobody cares!"
"Since when do you want my input on your relationship?"
"But?"
As the alcohol eventually took a more secure hold, their mirth died down to a comfortable lull. Harry finished his glass and relaxed back in the recliner he occupied. To his right on the loveseat, Draco was using Astoria's calves as a pillow while he babbled about where they had obtained the various furniture items around the house — every flea market purchase sounded like a victory on his tongue. After a riveting tale about the worse-for-wear coffee table, his words eventually fizzled out as he rested his eyes. "But only just for a minute," Draco reassured them. "I'm just feelin' a bit…." He trailed off, his hand flapping through the air before slowly sinking down to drape over his belly.
In that most awkward silence, Harry and Draco shuffled out the backdoor. The screeching goodbye from Scorpius was the only well-wishing that followed them out, everyone else just seemed glad to see them go.
Draco Malfoy needed easy, too.
"Were you not capable of
Cultivating a truce, and eventually a friendship, with Harry Potter (of all people) was just icing on the cake.
It had been five and a half years since Harry finally came to terms with it all. Five and a half years of internal debate. Five and a half years in a lonely apartment. Five and a half years of lying and creative evading.
Harry nodded, his heart seizing at what was to come. If Draco was pulling him away, this was bound to be a serious conversation. Was he going to profess his love now directly to Harry's face? His hands clenched into fists at the thought as he followed Draco across the hall. Draco resolutely closed the door behind them, but did indeed make for the storage cupboard with his wand held aloft.
branded with that stain for the rest of their lives for anyone to use against them as they willed.
Everyone was disappointed when Harry Potter didn't live up to his name.
And it felt wrong for Harry to be satisfied by that.
"No, like an orange. You know, the fruit?" Once again, Sharif cut Draco off mid-sentence, swiftly bringing the edge back. "Wouldn't sherbet be like a peachy pastel-type colour?"
In all honesty, the thought of not going at all didn't even cross Harry's mind. Of course he was going. There was a reason he'd seen that ad. There was some sort of destiny awaiting him at the end of this. Good or bad. Just like relocating to London. He'd left home and family all behind because he knew he was meant to. And now, to further the grand adventure, he was meant to meet a total stranger to have a chat about pretend relationships. It all felt so weirdly normal.
"I know," Draco said simply and resumed his pour until both of their leaves were well and steeping.
"Do come in, darling. Dobby will bring your things from the car."
"No need." Draco pulled a business card from his pocket. "Call me if you need anything.
Just like that, with one quick jab, everything settled back to normal. "Oh, come off it." Draco smirked, moving to walk beside Harry as they made their way back to the reception. He bumped their shoulders together before reaching to entwine their fingers. Only once Harry squeezed back instead of forcefully letting go did Draco grin and continue. "You know, just last week I saw you retrieve and eat a dumpling off a restaurant floor. By this point, I don't think you even have an image left to preserve."
Harry sighed wearily and gave up on composure. His shoulders sagged, his polite smile faded, his words became thin. "No, I haven't seen Neville since…since that day. You can ask him; I haven't broken the no-contact order."
. Didn't Draco fall into the latter category? A drug he couldn't quite get enough of? If he was supposed to cleanse himself of the things which poisoned him, was it brave to admit these lingering feelings, or was it harmful?
"Me, too," Draco confessed. He delicately covered his mouth afterwards, feeling for some reason like he'd divulged too much.
" Draco had sobbed into Harry's lap while curled like a kitten upon their bed. Once he finally told Harry, he was like a broken and gushing fountain. The alcohol was likely to blame for this. "
about it. Any of it. He wanted a clear head and an even clearer conscience.
"I think I'll have a bath before this inevitable train wreck," Malfoy continued like Harry hadn't spoken at all. Which was pretty on par with the last few days. "Just stay here and…." He paused in his mission towards a door across the room, taking a moment to assess Harry again from the corner of his eye. "Don't touch anything. Or move. Just
The response was instantaneous. With the permission, and without a single thought to question it, Harry hummed a noise of satisfaction and caved to the heat between them. He rutted in closer, his fingers eagerly exploring. On a normal day, it almost felt forbidden to touch his husband like this. To linger his fingers so intimately over his skin. To savor the scratch of his beard or the taste of his tongue. To revel in the matched heat between them and make sinful noises in response.
Hermione's gaze followed Harry as he paced back and forth a few times. "You're scared," she pointed out, expression softening. "Well, now you have to tell me."
fuck someone else. So he would go out, hair slicked and smelling of expense. Cocksure and dripping with wealth. His confident stride easily attracted all eyes
Their dynamic was back to exactly the way it had been. The sanctity of this room and its vulnerability was tainted with its ugliness. Harry lost any of the comfort he might have been feeling as he lifted up into a sitting position, legs dangling off the bed for a quick escape. "Pretty sure that's what I've been doing so far..."
. Children who didn't even know enough about themselves to think they'd done something wrong. Except for Martina Guererra. You broke your pattern with her. In every way. She was a pureblood. She was female. She was even a tad older than the boys. Why? Why did she deserve to die in your eyes?"
name, out on his tongue for the better part of two years. Always in private. Every time he spoke it, it brought a rush of color to his ears. It felt forbidden, in a way, and the high that gave him was intoxicating. Even now, watching Malfoy's eyes go lust-blown just at the sound of it, it was still the best feeling in the world. He hoped every time he spoke it from then onward (because how could he keep from shouting it from mountaintops now that he had been heard?), Malfoy's reaction would be the same as it was on this mind-fuck of a morning.
The instant feeling of protection absolutely no one else in the world could give him.
"Yes?"
They had never felt like protection before.
"The way she told it this morning, your relationship with Longbottom didn't end so 'amicably'."
"You know what?" Harry snapped back, the victory feeling bittersweet with Hermione's sour look accompanying it. "I think I'll have the rest of dinner in my room. I'm clearly in the wrong state to be socializing." He snatched up his plate and the paper in a rush, balancing them precariously as he leant down to press his lips to the top of Hermione's mess of carefully crimped locks. "Let me know if you want to watch a program before bed, alright?"
"Sorry, you just looked a little wobbly," Potter chuckled through his waterlogged throat.
won this battle.
The smile plastered to Draco's face began to deflate as he studied Sharif for a hint of humour. Mostly, he was just coming off as disinterested, which really wouldn't have hurt so much if Draco weren't actually so desperate for this to turn out at least amicably. "I suppose," he paused to clear his throat, "that's as good a reason as any to be employed."
In a rather undignified, un-Malfoy-like manner, Draco stuck his tongue out and aimed his broom in the opposite direction.
The reception to follow took place between the Stone Circle and the greenhouses. A dozen or so tables circled a large pile of kindling, too close to the Forbidden Forest for Draco's own comfort. Thankfully, there was plenty of wine, and since nobody seemed too keen to strike up a conversation with him, he was free to quickly lose himself and those pesky intrusive thoughts.
All he got was a puzzled knit of the brow. "Why would you go there at this hour?"
to me?"
His cautions didn't matter. Teddy heard, anyway. His hearing was ridiculously well-tuned. "Fuck," he muttered, hanging his head for a moment. "Yeah, Teddy…I did," he affirmed, looking up for just a second. Just long enough to glimpse the look of glee in the boy's eyes before quickly averting his own. "Keep peeling your potatoes."
that it hurt. Harry ached for more. For a heavier touch and a rougher kiss. If anything could make his doubts go away, it was this man he loved so dearly.
Hermione snorted a laugh, breaking any tension as she grabbed for the rough (
This time, Harry did allow himself a soft, restrained smile. "I don't know if you have enough experience with Polyjuice Potion to know that it leaves traces of a person behind. Small things."
For a long few minutes, the only sound came from Scorpius munching happily on his dinner. He was none the wiser to his family falling apart. What Draco wouldn't give to be the boy in that instant. Young and innocent and surrounded by nothing but pure warmth. Oblivious to any chaos.
She swatted at him playfully, accidentally dislodging her legs from beneath Draco's head in the process. Despite the way it
Draco had done this to him. Not directly…but it was definitely largely his fault.
His childhood was a messy tangle of hauntings such as that. Every good memory he had was spoiled by something ashen and singed. The older he was, the better those memories stuck...and the worse their burnt edges became. The older he was...the worse his mother deteriorated.
"Your frustration is beginning to make more sense to me." Cheryl sighed, the gears working behind her eyes before she could speak again. "First of all, I want to thank you for sharing with me. I commend your bravery
"That might have been the point, darling."
Always faltering in the heat of the moment when it mattered the most.
This attitude wasn't new, either, considering Harry's reputation throughout the office now. Swallowing the swell of his pride, Harry shrugged. "I wasn't drinking, Officer, but I'll acknowledge that I came in late. Even if it was only by a few minutes…."
, Potter."
"Harry? You'll continue to come around after tonight, right?" It was Harry's turn to pull himself from his distraction and meet Astoria's questioning gaze. "I mean…," she giggled, sounding nervous, "I hope you do. I think it would be good for you and for—" Astoria paused and looked down at Draco as he shifted against her legs. "And for Draco," she continued in an even softer whisper. "It's cathartic to be around people you relate to. I think the two of you could be that catharsis for one another. There's still a lot he hasn't processed from the war and from this whole ordeal with his family and—" With a frown, she abruptly fell silent, suddenly unable to meet his eyes. "Sorry, I'm rambling, it's the champagne. I drink too much and suddenly everyone gets this glazed look on their face. I'm just trying to say that I hope tonight wasn't this one-time thing you did because you felt obligated to. It wasn't, right?"
"And what is it you do for the school, exactly?" Harry cut in.
"Sorry, I got excited," Potter soothed, fingertips skirting through Draco's hair. "I'll make it up to you."
, Mother," Malfoy exclaimed and, without being able to see him, Harry could have very easily believed he was caught in the delicious throes of passion.
With a mischievous smile, Harry maneuvered his fighter to jump forward. In the same motion, he jammed a complicated move into the controller. Only a moment later,
"You have a few redeeming qualities. I think you're safe." Draco's words also came out quite hollow. Everything he wanted to say and do to Harry was tightly balled into an overused recess of his mind. He was desperate to appear professional. To appear to be able to stick to the rules. "Have a seat. Every file on the murders is here." He slid a hefty stack of folders across the desk. "
Once Harry hit their department, the chatter only worsened. Everyone around him somehow thought that since he was working for their boss, they were somehow working together. One guy even went so far as to congratulate them – both of them – on the amazing work they were doing. Even though he most likely had no idea what it was Harry was working on in the first place.
"You asked why Astoria and I started this organization? They're why. Their
"If you're quite done gawking, we have a lot to discuss!"
The dial tone still ringing in his ear, Harry cradled the phone and set it back on his nightstand. In its stead, he grabbed the framed picture of his parents that could easily be regarded as his most prized possession. Moving to London meant missing them more than anything. He visited still; at least they were only a few hours away. But train fare was hard to afford without an income. And he supposed he could call them more…. But talking to them over the phone only made his heart ache worse.
Just as he was settling back onto the edge of the bed, Draco glimpsed himself in the dresser mirror across the room. The shock of someone else's nakedness meeting his eyes stole his breath. This man was soft where he was sharp, full of life and comfort. Full of everything Draco had been trained to see as weakness. He was beautiful from his soft, dark hair to the tips of his too-big big toes. Irrationally, Draco found himself jealous that Potter would have this man's body in the most carnal of ways while Draco would never really be able to connect those feelings he'd experience with his own flesh and blood.
"Alright, how many have you had sex with, then?"
Fucking gorgeous and Harry's alone.
I have to add, the end of this chapter feels like a finish but it isn't. I assure you I am not yet done. Definitely stay tuned for more!
. For the real thing.
earlier. Not after the way it made him feel.
Although he tried to pretend that his directionless life didn't faze him, Harry was actually starting to get a bit frustrated with himself. It was half of why he kept quitting jobs. Nothing felt…
He was still drunk when he stumbled out of the strangers' home, his awareness low as he walked face-first into a flourishing, lion-shaped bush. "Excuse me," he muttered, patting its foliage gently. In an attempt to gain his bearings, he shuffled around in a circle. He took in the houses to the right, the beginnings of a string of businesses to the left, the challenge of descending the stairs ahead.
Draco Malfoy didn't deserve Harry Potter. He didn't deserve to be cushy and happy. There was nothing good inside of Draco.
Every bit of color Draco had in his skin flushed away as he felt his heart stop for a moment.
Despite this, Potter usually went about his day as usual. He went to work and he went out with friends. He pretended not to notice a significant rise in the population of any area he happened to be in. He was a good sport. He was a good guy. That was why people followed him so closely, wasn't it? He was just so
empty.
Somewhere behind him in the yard came a heavy sigh. "He's not on his own, Draco. I'm watching him. Already noticed the hives. He's had some allergy medicine – he should be fine in a few minutes." Astoria shuffled through the grass, coming to rest right behind Draco's head. She leaned into his direct eye-line, the absolute definition of steamed. He was willing to bet she hadn't slept well since he left. "You don't have to pretend like he doesn't get properly parented while you're away."
With the door to his back, Draco let a full-fledged smile slide over his entire countenance. He was going home. The one wish he had secretly harbored for seven years. Obviously, he had never dreamed it would be under these circumstances…. But he couldn't find a reason to complain with the outcome. Slowly, he peeled himself up off the door and threw the file onto the desk. It took all of his restraint not to send an ignition spell at it. "Fuck this," he whispered, up-righting the pictures he'd tipped over one-by-one. The last one he grabbed happened to be of Teddy, Harry, and Charlie on the couple's wedding day. Smiling and laughing like not a thing could be wrong. Like it was the happiest day of their lives. Scoffing, he nearly set it back down hard enough to shatter the glass in the frame. A split second before it hit the wood surface, he stopped himself and pulled it close again. "And fuck
"It's important, Fleur. If you get him for me, you can go back to sleep."
But Harry had never been much of a rational thinker. He wasn't a planner. The skill of calculating wasn't one he possessed. So there he stood, without a plan, in front of the house he could never look at the same way again, shaking. Shaking with anger. Shaking with uncertainty. Shaking from the restlessness that comes from holding back the desire to throw a killing curse. He could count on one hand how many times he'd felt so vividly fuming, but it had never felt like this.
bringing every single fear he'd ever had for his godson to sudden and vivid life.
It wasn't Draco's fault. He just couldn't help himself. Sex was literally in the air…so something was bound to happen. And Potter was a fine enough looking bloke…. And it was his birthday, dammit! So, yeah, he kissed him. And when he realized what he'd done, he pulled back and looked up at Potter with an obvious eagerness for more.
Shea's lifestyle being what it was, all he had ever asked for was honestly.
An annoyingly loud screech accompanied Potter's decision to sit down anyway, much to Draco's surprise. He pointedly kept his eyes elsewhere until he had another stout in hand, chasing down his previous one with a couple shots of whiskey for good measure. By the time he did finally take the leap to meet Potter's gaze, he found that the man had already unpacked the contents of his takeaway onto a placemat of napkins between them. Like a picnic in the middle of a crowded bar.
Harry came to realise that the worst thing Draco could possibly say was actually yes. A no would be simple and final and probably help Harry move on. After all, there were plenty of other well fit blokes out there. If he resolutely knew Draco wasn't interested, maybe he could finally start to notice some of them. He would be doing Harry a favour if he just said no….
"The two of you live together?"
"S'pose I'll come back on Wednesday, then," Harry rushed to say, shoving his hand deep in his pocket the instant it was released. "Leave you to your celebrations."
someone must be able to see that.
He should ensuring the boy's safety.
Draco pulled back, only enough to better see into Potter's eyes. He was smiling and Draco could feel him softly chuckling. "I- No. No, I'm just…." He frowned. "What?"
Harry Potter was upstairs in Draco's own house, making himself very much at home. It was in the guest room, so that didn't really count in the way he had hoped…. But it was still something. He was still
This whole plan banked on Draco being the perfect little Pureblood he had always bragged to be. If he kept to that code of protecting your own, Theo was in the clear. And by the look of unbridled shock on Potter's face in that moment, Draco was doing just as he was expected to.
. What they gained from one another often came in uncontrollable outbursts or panic attacks. It was usually gleaned from trauma and accompanied by blood or tears.
"What do you want from me, Harry?"
(Also, long story short, I posted this chapter when AO3 was having issues Sunday. Took it down and reposted it this morning.)
"Did everything go alright with James, then?"
The guard on his door slowly shook his head, waving his wand in a memorized pattern over the door handle. "Good luck, Mr. Malfoy," he grunted and pushed the door wide open.
With his "homework" in mind, adding to the already muddled mess and making him woozy, Draco left the office for another week. He left and went about life as was expected. As if he had never been there in the first place. His seeking therapy wasn't exactly a secret amongst those who knew him, however it was expected for him not to speak of it. They, most especially his mother, wanted him better. But they did not want to hear about his progress or even what his problems may be. They wanted him to skip right over the whole thing and "become himself" once more.
The graceless snort which erupted from Draco's nose ended up drawing more attention than Potter's little toddler antics as several people, the bartender included, turned around to see what could be so funny. He waved them off with an "everything's just fine" grin before dropping his forehead into his hand. He wasn't near sober enough to keep from dipping into delusion about this night and how perfect things could be if they just….
him. How could he ever deny that desire? "I would have thought the great and honorable Harry Potter always tops," Draco snorted.
"Yeah, that's why we didn't work out…."
At the same time, however, he also felt like he was somewhere he could finally rest. He felt surrounded by comfort and warmth. It was something he'd been without for so long that when he was now faced with it again, he almost wasn't sure what to do with it. This safety felt too good to be true.
"Well, this took a bit of an awkward turn," Deacon laughed, his expression not quite matching the mirth. "I apologize for the distasteful joke. As Draco said, we are only here in a professional manner. Perhaps we should stick to only that topic of conversation." Very slowly, he settled into one of the chairs on the other side of Harry's desk.
They shared a weighted silence as Charlie walked closer to the fire. Harry took a moment to examine the little house he knew so well but had never actually been to. He supposed he only really knew this one part of it. The sitting room that bled right into the kitchen. It always seemed so cozy to him. He could definitely understand why his husband chose to spend most of his days here. And why he insisted his family never needed to visit him there. It was his own private heaven. He could fill it with anything he chose to. Books and discarded clothing were spread everywhere – a bachelor-like chaos. And the place always smelt of coffee and sweet walnuts.
Potter honoured his request and graciously ignored his question. "If you could call it that, we 'broke up' shortly after Christmas. So, yeah, I'm back at my lonely, oversized home on Grimmauld Place. As you can understand, I'm not too eager to get back to it, hence the whole…'walking you home' ploy." He grinned up at Draco, bumping their shoulders. "It's just as much for my sake as it is yours. I keep your drunken arse from getting taken advantage of, and you keep me from going bonkers all by myself in that house. Win-win."
When the silent tension finally became too much, Harry ran his fingers through the familiar blue locks again and made quick work of excusing them. "We'll be just outside. If you need us ring the bell, okay?" When Teddy nodded, he set the glass back on the bedside table and made a speedy exit with Draco's hand grasped firmly between his own until they were in the hallway again.
"Oh, don't guffaw at me like that, Potter. You're the least subtle thing on the planet," Daphne continued, pulling her hair down from its messy bun before raking it back up again. "For the record, I am totally on board with the whole thing. Boy needs a proper snog, if you ask me. And the two of you really do have that tragic enemies-to-lovers thing going on that's so hot."
Somewhere behind the rush of blood in Draco's ears effectively drowning out the world, he could hear Potter crashing through his own orgasm. He hummed his satisfaction into Draco's collarbone, nipping at its curvature. He was mumbling things — sweet, delicate things. Things meant for
"You first," Harry whispered, his heart loud in his ears.
A few minutes of silent busywork passed between them as they pulled out the banquet tables as well as the round ones for seating. Only once all of them were assembled and they began to work on setting out chairs did Draco finally open the dialogue. "Did we move too fast for you the other night?"
Without a single question about where he had been these last couple of weeks or why he was there now, Luna set him to the task of weeding a row of wolfsbane. It was menial, mind-numbing work and exactly what he needed. He tugged at every thistle with a vengeance, almost feeling a deranged sense of comfort any time one managed to prick him through his gloves.
Or, was it even courage in the first place? This right here was what he'd been going through with his counsellor. They'd been working to help him identify those things he
"Have you ever been with a man?" Potter asked softly, his right hand settling on Theo's thigh.
Unsurprisingly, Delphini cracked the silence first. "We can all see and
me, Draco!" Astoria shouted. The sound of subtle stirrings echoed from upstairs, but a crying toddler was last on her mind. That crying toddler was half the reason she felt like this in the first place.
"You saw Uncle Draco today?"
"You shush," Charlie chuckled, the familiar hollowness sinking back into his tone. He wore a small smile beneath Harry's fingers but it too lacked depth. He peppered almost forlorn kisses to the skin and picked up the pace of his rutting. "I just…. I just want to be the one that completes you."
in the first place. He would certainly be lying if he said he didn't often think fondly on his little apartment. He had built three different lives there at three different turning points. His life with Teddy – raising a sweet little boy even though he knew nothing about doing so. His life with Draco – the first real love he had allowed himself to have. And his life with Charlie – something stable and expected of him.
Harry stood eerily still, like a deer stuck in headlights, fully aware he was flushing the colour of Luna's adorable little dusty-pink nipple. "No?" he just barely managed to croak out. "Why would anything be about him?"
Charlie grinned, watching from the kitchen as he dished up dinner. Teddy's giggles were only serving to rile the dogs up more and Harry couldn't apparently pet them fast enough.
Harry would never in a million years think to describe his life as having been easy. He would be the first to recognize that things had been exceptionally difficult for him practically from birth. He'd experienced more loss in his first eighteen years than an average person might in their lifetime. His life had been intentionally put in harm's way for the gain of those who were mean to protect him. He'd been hunted down and tortured and lied to more times than he could even recall. By Godric, he had even
Those words should have brought some sort of happiness to Draco. He wanted to be able to take satisfaction in the ultimate demise of Harry's marriage. But the situation called for a little more class than that. And he couldn't find anything but sympathy from the shattered look in this man's eyes. "It's not your fault," he reassured, even though he knew Harry wouldn't listen. If roles were reversed, he wouldn't either. He would be just as angry and feel just as guilty. The difference between them, however, was likely how much restraint it took to keep Draco from killing Weasley on the spot.
Had she known their world would find out like this, she definitely would have hesitated before entering into their little charade. "Fix it," Astoria muttered while standing. Just barely keeping herself from tearing upstairs and throwing Potter out of her husband's bed and out of their lives forever. This wasn't the woman she had agreed to be. "And go bring Potter coffee; he's going to need it before you show him what Rita Skeeter has to say about him this time."
As much as Draco wanted to give Harry that comfort, he couldn't. He didn't know what would happen. He didn't know if Teddy was going to be okay. He was almost entirely certain that the boy had ingested some of the poison. But he had no clue what such a little amount could do. He couldn't even comfort himself by pretending everything would be fine.
Draco paused before answering, his heavy swallow extremely audible with the stillness of the room. "No. I don't know if either of my parents were aware of her…
Answering suddenly felt like a trap. This whole thing – the ad and the not-so-normal addition of a telephone number – felt like he might be falling for a prank. A bit of a harmless one, but a blow to his self-esteem nonetheless. "Yeah," Harry whispered back, finger hovering over the hook switch. Just in case.
And the reality was – Draco Malfoy was still very much a git. But Harry was committed now and he supposed he should at least try to hear the git out. Even if it was just because he might have the opportunity to punch him if things turned out to be as much of a mess as they seemed to be.
For half a second, he played with the idea of just leaving. Just giving up. This wasn't his fight to win, anyway.
Except…McClain had a plan, too. Draco was so sure of it, even with little to no evidence. Otherwise, why would he have pulled a report with Teddy's name on it? And
Draco managed through the rest of his day on no less than ten shots of espresso and two Invigoration Draughts. By the time the sun was setting, he knew he was going to crash. It was inevitable. At this point, there was only the matter of where it was going to happen
It started with a woman here and there. Socially acceptable women who had actively sided with the right side of the war. Women who were just as saintly as he was and who would promote his image only in the best way possible.
And four years later, Shea was still there. Trying.
dream. But he shrugged, the movement a blatant lie; and he told her what she wanted to hear, a carefully selected half-truth, "It's starting to take me longer to determine what was real and what was just my imagination."
"Yes, I can."
"Is this something you could ever really heal from?" Draco hissed. Harry couldn't miss his shoulders tensed beside him. He couldn't miss the anger radiating off of him. "Your child is dead. How do you
The obscene sounds were so distracting…. Draco was so distracted. And he wasn't paying attention. His eyes were watering and he just couldn't
It would be foolish to deny that, yes, Shea and Harry getting intimate did sour Draco's stomach a bit. But he couldn't exactly pinpoint why. "I don't know. And now isn't the time to talk about it." He was itching in his skin. This wasn't a conversation he was ready to have. Not any single part of it. "Let's shelve that discussion for later, okay? I have a favor to ask you before I leave."
"You want me to change my mind about revoking Draco's custody." It wasn't a question.
In the meantime, despite his best efforts to quell the fantasies, Harry's imagination kept running. Every rational bone in his body knew that last night was a fluke. He'd caught Draco at a vulnerable moment, a moment he'd sort of taken advantage of. But he still couldn't keep the what if's from tumbling around in his head.
Beside him, Draco was shaking with chuckles as well, looking so damn proud. "Thought you'd like that," he somehow managed to work out breathlessly. "I'm convinced they're joke votes. Still, it makes for quality entertainment watching that percentage steadily rise these last few days."
Draco winced at the pet name. It felt like a sharp slap even with the sweet tone behind it. He didn't look up at Shea – he didn't want to see that same anger inevitably still in his eyes. So all he could manage was to sit there on the edge of their bed, hands knotting in his lap like a nervous child. "You're talking to me again?" he asked on a cautious breath.
too much. It would be entirely unfair to rescind that promise so short after making it. But not helping here…with that guilt now sitting on his conscience, that also felt inherently wrong.
"Did you miss Mashed Potato, too?!" Teddy asked eagerly, looping his arm around the dog's neck. He'd been allowed to name the dog, his gift once the adoption was finalised. A three-year-old should never be given that level of responsibility, especially not one with such an uneducated palate.
The good Pure-blood in Draco shuddered at the idea of seeing such history replaced by something distasteful from a shop full of mass productions. The other half of him wished he could see Potter in every corner he looked. He wanted to be able to bask in him, fully immersed in a world he had crafted.
"Thank you," Draco said gruffly, all but tearing his arm away. He needed to harden himself. He needed to be that image he presented to the world – cold and aloof. It was that personification that would get him through this harrowing process. It was that personification that could avenge Teddy's assault.
So, he stayed. He helped Hermione make crisp sarnies — their go-to food when alone because Ron couldn't stand the idea of salty crisps polluting a perfectly good peanut butter sandwich and always gave them guff for it. They took their plates back to the sitting room, sitting cross-legged across from one another on the carpet and something about that moment just felt so nostalgic and perfect. He almost didn't bring up the article. He didn't want anything to change.
Harry remained in his seat, shirking down a bit. Their working relationship was so hostile…. "You see, a simple owl would do," Deacon seethed, waving his hand in the air. His impatience clear as day. "But since you've waited, what is your oh-so-important theory?"
. I mean…not tonight. I don't think, anyway." He made a frustrated noise and clenched his fists. "No. But I might be interested in less clothes? And maybe we could see where things end up?"
him. Or something. To drop this act of anger and be the man he stuck around for again. With a simple wrist flick, he beckoned for the rest of the dishes to settle into their rightful places at the table. With this out of the way, he settled Scorpius into his high chair before sitting beside him. "Where's Astoria tonight?"
…when it should have been about
"First times are messy," Draco whispered, leaning in to set his teeth to Harry's earlobe. The stress of Harry's own resistance began to melt away beneath the ministrations, his fingernails digging into Draco's t-shirt in a show of undeniably returned affection. "But they can be lovely, too," he added, now working those little bites down the thick of Harry's neck.
And, often, he would find a quiet corner and attempt to relive the dreams he had denied himself the night before. Sometimes alone, sometimes with any warm body willing to play along.
Luckily, Draco was steadier on his feet. In the silence, he offered Rita some of the tea and begrudgingly fixed it to her exact, fussy instructions. Only once she'd taken a sip did he relax back into the arm of the sofa with a rather pleased expression on his face.
"Oh, most definitely," Draco confirmed. "But neither of us possesses a body the other would like to make love to, so…." He trailed off with a smirk, once again gesturing towards the stairs. "Divorces are messy and expensive, and living with your best friend really isn't so bad. Except that night she brought home a screamer. That was the
Charlie didn't meet Harry's eyes in the fire again. He kept them turned down to the carpet, to that same distracting stain, and spoke with as much control as he could manage. "Do whatever the fuck you want, Harry. Just…do me a favor and don't come crying to me when Malfoy fucks everything up for you again, somehow."
Except…Teddy wasn't waiting for him.
He must have noticed Harry staring. Honestly, Ron was a bit more aware of his surroundings than Harry had initially given him credit for. From the outside, he appeared to be all muscle and little brain. A typical clueless guy. But he saw more than people probably realized and he had more heart than he might wish to let on, as he most often masked his genuine feelings with a joke or a jab. "Thanks," Harry muttered in reply, feeling the back of his neck heat up in an obvious show of embarrassment. "But I'm not really interested right now."
What was it about Harry Potter, anyway? How was it that any subtle suggestion from his lips could bury a flourishing seed of hope inside a person? How did he go from a mere child to the persuasive
Harry followed him to said office, glancing backwards a moment. "What did he do to be deemed incompetent?"
Well…of Draco, really.
But on the surface, he couldn't stay angry. "I might be willing to come out…if you'd like to try and wake me up…."
For a moment, Draco merely blinked up at him. Slowly, like delicate paper being unfolded, he rose from his languid pose in the chair. He pulled off the ribbon tying his hair back and carefully marked his spot in the book before placing it on the coffee table. All of this he did with short, staccato movements like maybe he was tensed and holding himself back. Instinctively, Harry took a step backwards. "Do I?" was all Draco whispered in response, his voice sharp as ice.
A waitress graciously interrupted their silent tension after only a few minutes, effectively pulling Harry from his own head and back to the task at hand. He wasn't here to wallow in what he'd lost; he was here to mend what he'd broken.
. "I mean…just one second?"
They loved this pub – The Half-Blood. They came here whenever an escape from reality was needed. A Muggleborn witch had opened it just shortly after the two of them began dating. It was the location of their third date – or fifth date, depending on who you were asking. (Only Draco counted their initial one night stands as 'dates', the sap.) The owner had crafted her cozily lit tavern as an amalgamation of both her cultures. It was filled with many Muggle items, all of which were enchanted in some way. The jukebox was Harry's favorite. There were songs from both their childhoods and Draco never hesitated to sing or hum along to what he knew while they ate or drank…or danced, which only happened on rare occasions like that particular night.
Harry frowned at the curious wording and recalled Astoria's conversation earlier. "Your wife mentioned a situation; she assumed I was here to help," Harry took up a chair in the corner upon Draco's guidance. Draco sat across from him and pulled his leg up so his ankle rested across his knee. He made no effort to give an explanation, which was fair since Harry hadn't yet dared to ask a real question. "So, the two of you run this thing?" He steeled himself, knowing that if Draco was to divulge any personal information, it would be expected for Harry to do the same. But this was the biggest question niggling at Harry's brain. Something he just couldn't quite get a grasp on because none of the facts he had made any sense.
"Right. Now that's settled," he huffed, crossing the rest of the way to the fire, "get on with it."
In a way, this was true. It just wasn't the type of work be pretended it was. Official work. It was…emotional and physical work. Work that cleansed his soul and made coming home bearable. Work that left him drained, not just in the physical sense but also deeper within.
For only a brief second, Harry looked at Draco with a million more questions in his eyes. Draco would have to answer to every single one of them eventually. But both of them knew that now was not the time. He waved Charlie closer and the man, barely dressed in just a dressing gown, easily picked the boy up in his arms. Held him close to his chest and pressed his forehead to the top of his head. There was the threat of tears welling in his eyes, but he disapparated without a single break in his stone-faced composure.
you. Not back then. And I just need you to know that I'm—" Potter's voice cracked and broke off. Draco just barely resisted turning around before Potter whispered, "I'm sorry, Draco. I'm so, so sorry."
She always spoke of Draco's problem of the week in plain terms which made them sound so easy. She made them out to be merely a crack in the sidewalk to be stepped over rather than the natural disaster wiping away Draco's very self.
Harry shrugged, his body language matching his fixed frown. "We didn't finish our fight."
Or, more likely, it could change nothing.
With a snort, Draco moved his left arm under the table. His faded Dark Mark was covered – as it often was – but that didn't mean they both didn't know it was very much still there. Only a ghost of what it once was, but still a daily reminder of his past sins. "I can assure you, I don't."
"Has he been fucking you?"
For the longest moment, Hermione just nodded. She'd seen her best friend through a million stupid mistakes. This was nowhere near as dumb as the time he stole his dad's motorcycle and crashed it only a street away from his house. Or…maybe it was about the same level. He could see all the gears turning behind her eyes. She was worrying about everything he hadn't even thought to think of yet. "You don't even know this man," she said quietly. "What's his name? I need to know his name if you're going to end up
And he couldn't exactly deny that the odd seating area did afford him exactly what he was looking for in spades. With a sigh, he grabbed the telephone again and fell into one side of the chair. For a long moment, he merely enjoyed the comfort of being alone. The scent of milky lavender still lingered from Malfoy's bath earlier, calming him with every breath inward. He hadn't realized just how drastically the stress of the day had drained him until he was able to process it on his own. He very easily could have fallen asleep right there — which he considered for a moment simply to avoid having to sleep beside a literal stranger for the night.
Nodding once again, Harry pulled himself up, as well. "Home it is."
Before he could pull himself together, Draco quickly closed the distance between them. Whispering, "Stop talking for two seconds," before crashing their mouths together.
Harry snorted, settling down beside him. "I'm sure we won't ever have to worry about that. Even if Charlie does ever tire of me, I don't think I could settle down with any woman." He left an unspoken reasoning just hanging in the air. They both bristled a bit at it, but otherwise called no attention to it.
going to vomit.
A sickly grin took over Draco's features, showing Harry a glimpse of that boy he once knew. "Because you're a lying snake, Rita Skeeter." When Rita opened her mouth to likely object, Draco continued in an even louder tone. "Don't play innocent with me — I've heard the stories of your Slytherin schooldays from my Aunt Bellatrix. You two were quite close as far as roommates go, weren't you?"
"Nymphadora. You have to know I mean your niece; it's not a terribly common name."
," she held up an adorably stubby finger, "lolly, mumma. Okay?" Only once her mother had nodded did Rose give in and follow Anita out of the room on her own two feet, thank you very much.
Serving drinks was Harry's life now.
Right?
Home just didn't feel like home any longer. Harry wasn't quite sure what had replaced it or if it ever even
"Yes, ma'am?" Hermione's secretary, admittedly the most attentive in the office, wore an '
. I can name them all. I can tell you where I found the potion. All of it. I'll be proud to go down for this. Especially if that means someone else will know about it and take up in my stead. This won't be the last of our cause. Mark my words. Our comeuppance has only just begun, Malfoy. You best get back on the right side of history before it really is too late."
to be. Before the mess and chaos returned. Before the world caught back up with Harry and reminded him he wasn't meant to have an easy life.
Slowly, half afraid it was all a dream or nightmare, Draco peeled his eyes back open. He couldn't focus on anything but his hands, stunned to see the bouquet so perfectly nestled within them. He flexed his fingers around the flower petals, growing over-warm with a hybrid feeling somewhere between indignation and indignity. He looked up for just a second, gaze cutting hard to Luna peeking around the edge of the flames. She looked so damn proud of herself and even went so far as to knock her head in Harry's direction.
"I was making spice cake," Draco stated, rather matter-of-fact. He always spoke like what he had to say was obvious. It was equal parts annoying and endearing.
Draco shook his head vigorously, his lips peppering soft touches on any inch of Harry's skin he could reach. The side of Harry's hand, the tear-drenched curve of his cheek, his bottom lip that wouldn't quit its quivering. "Today has been too much. This week…has been too much. We threw all of this at you too fast. You're exhausted and you're losing your grip. Take deep breaths, Harry. I need you to calm down before we go back to the office."
Harry's flat felt full of light once again and he couldn't help but to feel silly about hunkering down in here for so long, especially since everything appeared to be mostly fine. He was even thinking of seeking out those nasty opinion articles, simply not feeling afraid of them anymore. Not really. If anything, they might be amusing. Especially if he could pick them apart with Draco by his side, making him feel more at ease and ready to handle anything.
And it took him a moment, but eventually the wheels started turning. He stared down at her hands, taking in the way they curled protectively over her jumper. As soon as everything began to click in his mind, his gaze flashed quickly back to her abandoned glass. Now that he thought about it, he hadn't actually seen her take a drink. "You're pregnant again?" he breathed out on a half-laugh. It almost seemed too good to be true that something beautiful was busting through the cracks of this torrential storm.
"Yes."
"He's right! We could find someone else. We had some back-ups…."
All of Harry's building fears came to fruition when he heard his bedroom door creak open. He swore under his breath, cracking the door to the toilet just a hint. Even from his limited view, he could unmistakeably make out Hermione's cloud of brown curls. His heart quickened as she moved freely through his room, babbling to the form on the bed. "By the looks of your table, you must've had a late night. Or a few of them."
"And what
Scoffing, Harry stared down at the floor. He counted the scuffs in the hardwood, trying to avoid recognizing that Draco was probably right. "I really don't know if that's smart."
Although Draco couldn't see it, he was sure McClain was smiling. There was the deep timbre of just one, soft scoff echoing in the still air. "I have to carry on with my mission. I had hoped you would understand that…."
The wedding itself was, admittedly, beautiful. Draco had certainly never thought of Hogwarts as a romantic place, especially not after the war and his own hand in it all. When he'd attended his "eighth" year, many wings were under construction, serving as a constant reminder of his sins. It had been haunting.
He probably didn't even know his face looked like that. Smug. Angry. An 'I knew it' not all that far off.
"Uncle Draco!" he exclaimed, completely ignoring his godfather in favor of jumping up to greet the other man. His excitement unchecked in the way he hugged him. Like he was afraid he could disappear at any moment.
It was starting to become a solid fact that Draco Malfoy was a sleepy drunk. Within twenty minutes of their serious conversation, his eyes were sliding closed as he shuffled off towards Harry's bedroom. Harry, with his fuzzy head full of selfish thoughts, didn't even try to stop him. If anything, he encouraged the idea of a nap — "Just a short one to… to clear my head, y'know? I should head home soon…." — knowing full well Draco wasn't going anywhere until the morning.
That happy smile pushed itself back onto Draco's face before he could even think about stopping it. And all he wanted for the rest of his life was to listen to this man say those words over and over again.
Really, Harry was expecting Charlie to run away. He was expecting the response he always got. The hasty apology and the retreat. It was just the response he had come to expect in the last four years of their marriage. It was predictable like the rising of the sun each day. It just was what it was and he was already ready for it.
"Don't same-gender-loving people and transgender people and…and all those in between deserve a place to go where they feel welcome? Is it really so strange that I, apparently of all people, might want to provide them with such a place?"
Harry flushed deep red down his neck and up to the tips of his ears. He found it difficult to meet Draco's eyes any longer and forced an amused noise from his throat. "N-no," Harry sputtered. "No. My maidenhood remains firmly intact; you have nothing to worry about."
her and get caught? Does this seem easier to you than just, perhaps, doing your job? Even if the way you went about it might have been shady, at least you wouldn't be sitting here facing murder charges…."
Not that last week was supposed to have even happened in the first place. It was a fluke. A lovely, horrible fluke.
"You actually came."
"Harry? Cake?"
Until in the barest morning light he caught the black ink on his wrist. In the same instant, the unmistakable sound of Draco's humming signified he had started breakfast.
, but if they were it would only discredit my own sexuality. Or the validity of it. I don't want anyone to see me as anything like her. I don't want to feel like I'm less than human for it."
?" The girl was made of pure sass peppered with psychopathic tendencies. She was salt and vinegar and all other disgusting things little girls should never be groomed into. Not that Harry would ever presume girls should be one thing or another…but they should never be as full of sickly acid as this one was. Not that any person should be, but least of all a
Draco smirked. "Since when does the great and powerful Harry Potter worry about rumors?" He didn't remove his hand. If anything, he pressed a bit harder.
Or maybe….
His head spinning, he settled back against the wood of the door for a moment. Trying to settle his raging thoughts. Trying to make sense of this day that had started so normal. Luckily Draco hadn't gone far because Harry just didn't have the composure to go searching. "Where did you send Gina?" he asked. The other man had settled into his assistant's desk, seemingly in the middle of writing a letter.
Not that he didn't look damn good, but Draco hardly found it appropriate for anyone to show up at a wedding in a pair of jeans. Even if the accompanying short-sleeved dress shirt did strain deliciously against one's chest, effectively pulling all focus away from the faded trousers he paired it with. "What's wrong with what I'm wearing?" Harry looked down at himself, smoothing his palms over the cobalt blue linen. "Hermione said it brings out my eyes."
The room was deadly silent. A pin could have dropped and the sound of it would have easily been swallowed up by the darkness clouding the air around them. Hermione's face was flat – she was adept at keeping her emotions back until she was ready to share them. Until she had fully processed them. "Harry...," she started, still holding herself in check. "That's quite an accusation for someone to make."
He heard Draco's footsteps coming closer, but kept his eyes trained downwards. If he looked up, he was sure to cave. He was sure to give up this fight and fall back into what felt safe. Which inherently wasn't a bad thing. It just might not be the
He heard Draco moving behind him, growing more and more embarrassed by every step. "Well, I was. Suppose I thought you would continue to come around after Skeeter's article was published, but we hadn't seen you in a while…." Harry looked over his shoulder when Draco paused, catching him frowning at a pile of discarded beer bottles littering his armchair. "My first thought was that you used us and moved on, so I figured I would check into my theory. I'm not sure whether to be relieved that it appears I was wrong, or disappointed in your cowardice."
The backs of Theo's knees hit the edge of his mattress and he had to shuffle to keep himself upright. He hadn't even noticed that they were travelling. That Potter was guiding them back towards his bed with an obvious one track mind. The realization thrilled him even if it was too fast and too rash. Even if they hardly knew each other and even if Theo had conned his way into this beautiful thing he was about to have.
"I needed to know if it was true…."
His jaw squared and ready to snap, Deacon leaned over his desk. He hadn't sat down once in the last half hour. He just stood there, scolding them like they were his errant teenage children. "You see…I haven't decided that yet," he seethed through his teeth.
Harry heard him breathe out slowly, the weight of something clearly hidden in it. Likely anger at him for not performing in the way he had hoped. "They won't bother us until dinner. My father has some…
In the dark, Draco couldn't be entirely certain but he thought he saw a blush take over Potter's olive complexion. This made him smile wider. Potter shuffled on his feet and turned to look around the club. Fully taking everything and everyone in. Unashamed. "It's a good place to lose yourself, isn't it?"
It was Ron's turn to take a moment to process his words. As he stood there silently, his gaze focused adamantly on the register, Harry's heart beat furiously. It was one thing to think about that word having been used, it was another entirely to voice it aloud. In his head, it had almost sounded like a romantic notion, even though it definitely still freaked him out. But telling someone that it had happened? That twisted the situation too far into the realm of uncomfortable and weird.
"Calm down. They're just using it to track your vitals," Draco cautioned to Harry's right. His hand was placed just-so on the thin mattress, like perhaps just a moment previous it had just been holding Harry's own.
Pencils in hand and Teddy crying himself to sleep in his bedroom, Harry stayed sat in front of the fire. He had reconciled to calling Charlie, after all. Not that he felt much like doing that with all of the less-than-great news he had to deliver. So he just…
word. Following him home after school and throwing rocks at him. Some people shouldn't breed, boys. That girl's parents shouldn't have bred. They created a monster. And I wouldn't blame my son one bit if he
Needless to say, he didn't sleep a single wink that night. There was far too much eating away at Draco's heart to sleep. Far too much to even consider it. And most of those things, he had no control over. Shea, the case, Astoria still not being home, the way Scorpius whimpered in his sleep through the baby monitor.
Harry couldn't help but to feel they hadn't earned it yet.
"I know you look at me like I should know what I'm doing with all of this, but I simply don't. I've never done this before — the whole…relationship thing." Draco paused, exhaling his insecurities. "That's what you are to me. You're something new; you're something to embark upon." He lifted his head, the apples of his cheeks just barely flushed pink. "I swear I didn't mean that to sound as sexual as it might have come off."
Deacon wasn't mad, he was disappointed. He said so at least five times. But Harry couldn't blame him.
"And before you get upset with
the actions Draco had taken to go further than to
Hermione's response was quiet. "Like…like Vivian Ward?" Soft. Like she didn't quite believe what she'd heard.
"Just fucking arrest him," Harry snapped as soon as Draco met him at the door. He also snuck a look in Charlie's direction, likely just making sure he hadn't taken off. "And find me a Time Turner so I can go back in time and never marry that piece of shit."
The previously placid expression on Astoria's face shifted drastically dark. She sat up straighter, facing Harry as head on as possible. "I'm sure they would have found a different pure-blood golden son to marry off their disgraceful
"The Ministry found evidence of someone hurting Teddy. Aside from what happened last night," Harry said solemnly, eyes still peeled for any sign of recognition where only a stony expression remained. "And Teddy gave up your brother as his abuser. Bill's been arrested."
Not that any of it felt much like solace. Draco didn't sleep. He hardly consumed anything but coffee and alcohol. He spent every moment
But the ache in his head was too insistent and the taste of bile on his tongue too obvious to ignore reality. Harry opened his eyes and took in the mildly-familiar flat. He'd only been here a handful of times, the ease of his own, empty house too perfect to pass up when they'd craved intimacy.
Anxious?
The front door slammed shut down below them, the force of it shaking the window at Harry's back. Malfoy leaned over to press his palm into the glass, closing his eyes until the vibration settled. "I'm being 'honest' with you." His long, slender fingers curved into air quotes. "And I consider that cat to be the most honest part of my life."
"Should you choose to break any of the rules set forth, bear in mind that my aunt kept meticulous diaries throughout her school years. Have I made myself clear?"
"You don't have to say it." He massaged at his temple, wishing his head would stop spinning so he could feel grounded again. "It was naïve of me to assume you had asked me to this wedding as your actual date. It was
Draco couldn't stop his loose muscles from returning the smile. "And here I thought you were just being chivalrous." He raised his voice, shouting at a much louder than appropriate volume considering the late hour, "Alert the presses — Harry Potter is a selfish twat!"
"You didn't tell us you were bringing a
If Draco's hands in his own didn't feel so warm and perfect, if his humour wasn't so entirely welcome, Harry might've gone through with leaving. Despite how he was squirming in his skin at the accusation, he found himself echoing that mirth and rolling his eyes. "As if Salazar Slytherin would be so proud of you. Sure, you have the whole sly and cunning thing down pat…but I feel like that's cancelled out by, well, all the rest of you."
is alive."
"Shush, let him answer."
"He means we're roasting our own dinner," Harry clarified in between muttering a retardant charm over Teddy's clothing. It was such a simple gesture, but one which made Draco's throat feel tight with emotion nonetheless.
"Is this really an appropriate conversation to be having in front of a child?" Narcissa sighed while massaging at her temple.
A transgender woman who only recently began wearing dresses to work at the Ministry had been received several alarming threats through their interdepartmental memo system. She was terrified to go anywhere alone within the building.
"He won't," Harry muttered more to himself than the others. "Hex me, I mean."
! God, no. You think I would really do something like that?"
"Forgive me for salting your wound, but that didn't look like it went well…."
Three days previous, Draco was in his home. He was pulling off Harry's wedding band with his teeth. He was on his knees, Harry's fingers coursing through his hair. Mussing his perfect image. His cheeks were hollowing out around Harry's cock. He had looked so sinful when their eyes met.
"He's probably not coming back," Draco muttered. The universe had been hanging in a precarious balance since the two of them even thought about dating. Just tipped enough to allow a glimpse into a reality that should never exist. Just enough for a taste. Just enough for Draco to get his fill of 'what if's and 'maybe's. Just enough for him to taste it and crave more.
With a soft sigh, he pulled himself from the secluded booth and made for the bar again. This empty glass was his third gin and tonic. Now would probably be a good time to stop. His intention was to leave the glass and then leave the club. But the instant he caught the bartender's eye, words betrayed him and he asked for another.
