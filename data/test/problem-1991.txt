Draco hesitated. He wasn’t sure how much he should share with Pansy. If it was all in his head, which he suspected it might be, it might sound a little…obsessive. And he wasn’t
The room seemed to be on edge, everyone leaning forward in the circle waiting for Malfoy’s first dare. Malfoy was staring at Harry with uncomfortable intensity.
“Is that a maybe?” Harry hedges. Actually having a real conversation with Draco Malfoy has put him in dangerous territory. Because now Harry’s even more desperate to spend time with him. And if Malfoy says no…
, he had, it certainly wasn’t in a cold sterile hospital room with Draco wearing nothing but a hospital gown and Harry fully clothed.
As soon as the waitstaff disappeared without taking an order - apparently Malfoy was “waiting on someone” - Malfoy turned to Harry, catching him staring. “What?” He snapped.
Harry finally understood. He took a few careful steps forward until he stood directly in front of Draco. “Malfoy, I think you’ve misunderstood. What I wrote–“
Yes, I know it's been 5 million years but I've finally finished this story! If you're coming back to this story after reading the earlier chapters when they came out, thanks for sticking with me anyway. You have incredible patience. I hope it lives up to the suspense and that I properly fixed all the plot holes I fell into. ;)  Much love, QT.
“You really shouldn't–” Verity calls after him but he’s already far into the house. He discovers a library and follows it through to a vast study. Malfoy sits at a desk in the centre, his back to the entrance. Harry’s about to call Malfoy out for ignoring him when he hears Malfoy singing.
Draco tried a different approach. “Are we friends?” The question seemed so childish when said aloud. If he could have, Draco would have snatched it back out of the air.
Rather than leading him up to one of the Hotel rooms above the ballroom (which Draco had hoped he’d have access to as wait staff), Potter led him out onto a small balcony.  The view wasn’t particularly extraordinary but Draco did appreciate the cool night air on his heated skin.
“Why did you bring this to me?” he whispers waving the note. “It’s addressed to Narcissa Malfoy, not me.”
Draco darted backwards, quickly jumping behind the couch to keep his distance from Harry. “Can’t we just have a mature, romantic,
Draco’s first patient of the day was a charming older witch who couldn’t stop casting summoning spells with every word she said - spell malfunction ward. Draco’s second patient was a young father who claimed his whole family couldn’t stop reenacting their ancestors - historic curses ward.
“Can’t Harry Potter be bad, just this once?” Draco whispered. “I promise you’re not taking advantage.”
Malfoy nods mutely and they start the journey to the Great Hall together, side by side, like friends but not. To be fair, Malfoy hasn’t directed any sneer Harry’s way yet but it’s only a matter of time. Malfoy walks with his usual haughtiness, but his eyes betray him as they flicker frantically between passing students. A couple of students stare but Harry returns the favour and they quickly look away, embarrassed at being caught.
“All the fake smiles and polite chatter, all this not saying what we mean.” Merlin, Harry hated it. And after the taste of something else, something real, how could he ever go back to it?
Malfoy had the advantage of the headstart. He was closing in on the snitch and Harry knew if he didn’t do anything the bastard was going to win. So, he acted instinctively. Thinking only of the win, he raised one hand from his broom, stared Malfoy right in the eyes, and blew him a kiss.
But nonetheless, it’s perfect. And really the hospital isn’t all bad. The gown is of course. The gown is all kinds of hideous. But Draco can make it through. No, he’s
The journey up to Malfoy’s private dorm is tedious in the cloak – he has to be careful to avoid all passing students which isn’t easy when they can’t see you and move unpredictably. It’s a necessary evil though. He doesn’t want to be spotted on his way up and interrupted, least of all by Malfoy, who must be around somewhere. It’s surprising that his dorm is empty at all considering Malfoy usually hurries there after classes end for the day. So Harry will be quick. Or as quick as he can be dodging students through the halls of Hogwarts.
Harry falls back in his seat. Narcissa would never betray her son. If she’s tipping off Magical Law Enforcement, it can only be because she’s worried for his safety.
At this point, even a green apple, which Harry is right, was once his favourite, isn’t anything that Draco can think positively about. It’s food. It’s repulsive. It’s wrong. But Harry Potter’s light, now there’s something very right about that.
“You are literally in denial about everything, Draco. I can’t even talk to you.” She says turning back to her own burger. She takes a bite and sighs into it. “Nothing beats pub food in London,” she whispers to herself before turning back to Draco. “And we’re not leaving until you eat at least a quarter of your burger.”
Shit. Draco was an idiot. He’d completely forgotten it was November third. He’d been thinking about the day all week. And all the day prior as well. But this morning, he’d gotten up and headed straight to his favourite coffee shop without thinking. He’d sat down at his usual spot by the door with his usual caramel macchiato (with extra foam), forgetting there was nothing usual about the day at all.
The other Draco pulls away from him and Harry takes a good look at his face, as if to find some distinguishing factor, but every inch is the same as the violent Malfoy who threatened him with a knife. And Avada Kedavra-ed him twice. It’s disconcerting, and Harry finds himself taking a step back, away from both Draco Malfoys.
“So, it’s only fitting that you catch up quickly,” Malfoy mumbles into Harry’s neck, starting to shower him with small, gentle kisses.
Malfoy makes a strangled sound of pain but manages to maintain his posture this time. “More,” he whispers between pants. “Distraction. Please.”
For a second, Draco considered waking him up, or taking him back to the Gryffindor Common Room - if he could find it - but then he remembered this was Harry Potter. And he was Draco Malfoy.
Harry didn’t bother to reply to that. Polite small talk rarely required an actual answer. But there was something he needed from Draco. He really hated to ask, especially when Draco was playing this game. “Can you stay and look after Teddy for a bit? I’m going to be at this for a while.”
Malfoy leans back down and claims Harry’s lips, soft at first, but the wanting quickly gives way to something harder, and soon Harry is a mess of desire, fighting against Malfoy’s legs for more friction. It’s Malfoy who pulls back, laughing, as he releases his legs and rolls onto his back beside Harry.
“Anything in vials, leave to me,” Malfoy says, cross-legged on the floor, as Harry walks in. “Can’t have your meaty hands breaking everything.”
“I’m not sure, Malfoy. You’re the one flirting with me this time.” Potter says, his tone feigning innocence, his expression more smirk than smile. The bastard!
“Yes, I will. I’m getting to that.” Malfoy tightens his grip on the knife and brings it back down to Harry’s throat.
Potter just wasn’t letting Draco have his deflection today. When did he get so perceptive? Or had he always been this way, secretly noticing Draco’s behaviour and reading him like an open fucking coffee book? Shit. That was so like Potter.
much better than Draco. Both minds were thrilled at the challenge presented, all the same. “You haven’t beaten me yet,” he reminded Potter, waving the snitch between them, the proof of his win.
Harry would love to be as confident as Hermione but they haven’t exactly learned anything. “We still don’t even know what ingredient – “
“Oh yes,” Malfoy interrupts, “you got me! I find life isn’t worth living unless I’ve committed at least two crimes before breakfast.”
Of course, it’s Malfoy who drops his gaze first. He obviously has more control than Harry. Who is fucking losing his mind. To his body. To his traitorous horny body. Over one dream. One tiny sex-ish dream. It’s fucking ridiculous.
Look, it’s not as if Malfoy bullies Harry or his friends anymore. Living through a war ages you and puts things like childhood rivalries in a very different light. But they’re not friends either. They’re classmates. Ex-enemies. One time Harry said hi to Malfoy when he ran into him alone by the Great Lake. Before promptly turning back the other way to avoid standing in awkward silence. That’s as far as their “relationship,” for lack of a much better word, goes
“You were there last night. It was real. I know it was,” Harry pushes. There’s no need for Malfoy to keep up this cool act. They know. They both fucking know.
Harry quickly pushed back some of the more humiliating thoughts that had started to run through his head at the sight of Malfoy and tried to remember Snape’s Occlumency lessons. “So this is your grand gesture,” he said cooly (or as cooly as he could with his pink face betraying him) “A bit of hair dye.”
Harry’s mouth gaped and closed a few times before he was able to get the words out. “I’m not showering with you.”
Draco leaned into Harry as he reached his high, coming over Harry’s hands and the trousers that, frustratingly, Harry was still wearing. He breathed in deeply as he came down, the blood returning enough to his brain so he could understand the implication of Harry’s words. Draco Malfoy was now dating Head Auror. Harry Potter was now his boss. So many fantasies. So many possibilities. But first, he couldn’t wait to try out Harry’s new desk.
Harry looked up quickly - he hadn’t expected that. Although perhaps he should have. “You’re not going to cure me?”
“It’s fine.” Draco says as he quickly picks them both up and hastily cuts into a meatball. It’s exceedingly dry inside. Draco has no intentions of eating it, but he pushes it around his plate regardless. He senses Potter still staring at him, so he carefully twists his fork and nibbles on a piece of spaghetti. It tastes like dry toast. He wants to gag, but Potter’s eyes are on him so he covers it with a small cough.
At least it prompted Potter to finally do something. And that something was…shit…one hell of a something. Draco didn’t consider himself a sensitive person, at least not physically. He’d experienced enough pain to render his skin considerably tough for an 18 year old. But, shit, pleasure.
Malfoy shrugged. He didn’t seem phased at the accusation. He had kicked off his shoes and was pulling his Quidditch trousers off. Right there in front of Harry! “And what are you going to do about it?
“I know you’re watching me,” Draco mumbled, his eyes still closed. One of his hands found Harry’s and held it, tracing the new band on Harry’s ring finger.
Malfoy stopped at a shower cubicle and turned to face Harry fully. He had on the same smug grin he’d been wearing when he caught the snitch. “Then what are you doing here, Potter? Why did you follow me into the locker room? Your wand's not out, so you’re not going to curse me. If you wanted to punch me, you would have done it by now. So what
“You did this to spy on my technique?” Interrupted Draco. “That’s- thats-“ The word ‘cheating’ couldn’t quite make it’s way out of his mouth. Not when those very “tactics” (whatever Potter meant) were exactly that.
That was it. Draco couldn’t take it any longer. He stood up and swivelled around to face Harry, who, infuriatingly hadn’t even bothered to take his shirt off yet. “Harry, this is hot and all, but can you stop playing and just fuck me?”
“And what did you find out? Nothing. You risked everything for nothing.” Hermione drops her head back to her paperwork, allowing her words to sink in.
Arms wrapped themselves around Harry from behind and he sunk into the embrace, grateful for the warmth.
Professor Slughorn stops fiddling. “Try not to draw attention to Mr Malfoy’s behaviour. The last thing we want is for other students to fancy themselves muggle detectives like yourself.”
“We’ll monitor his Floo network with a spell,” Hermione suggests, adding her own neat sticky notes to the case file. “We’ll monitor his magical barriers with a spell. We’ll monitor the skies around the Manor with a spell. We’ll monitor the number of people in the Manor at any one time with a spell.” She looks up at Harry. “And then we’ll come back to our warm comfortable office and wait for anything to change. We’re wizards, Harry. It’s really that simple.”
“I don’t,” Draco said quickly. He was just making a point for merlin’s sake - did Potter have to be so…so…urgh.
Harry was a little taken back by the directness, and still not sure of Draco’s intentions. He couldn’t think of an answer. “I don’t know.”
“The answer is that they are all as likely as each other. We have no idea how asphodel root will choose to react with the ingredient. There is no pattern to it. Like I said, no formula.”
Being well graced in polite society, Draco was forced to delay his departure to appease all the Weasleys – somehow, they seemed to be multiplying.
Harry hears Malfoy sigh beside him. “If I knew it was just going to make you this fucking jealous, I wouldn’t have bothered.”
Malfoy hesitated a moment – Harry suspected he was also battling the same internal struggle – before agreeing with a quiet: “Okay.”
“You’re not my date,” Draco corrected, taking a small step back. Potter was a little too intense. A little too direct. Draco wasn’t used to it. And he certainly wasn’t used to being called out. It felt strange that he didn’t hate it as much as he thought he should.
Potter chuckles to himself as he picks up a fork. Draco allows him the chuckle. He knows Potter knows he’s been concealing his own eagerness but somehow that’s still better than saying it aloud.
“-wake up soon, I am taking him to the hospital. I don’t care what he says. Merlin, I thought he was…but I think he just fainted.”
Although, it was Draco’s proposal, so Harry probably shouldn’t have been the one overthinking the symbolism. He shook it from his head. It didn’t matter when or where Draco proposed. It only mattered that he wanted to. And Harry would gladly say yes.
Coming to for the second time is much more pleasant. In place of a hard floor is something soft and familiar. His mattress. Which means Potter must have carried him up the stairs. Before he can get too upset about missing that, he remembers his vision. He opens his eyes in a panic. It’s blurry but it’s there. Colours and shapes…and movement. Potter’s pacing at the end of Draco’s bed, phone in hand.
Ah. Or she’s just very aware of the terrifying power she has over Draco. “Fine. But don’t – “ His eyes dart to Potter who is watching him curiously – “Just don’t. I mean it.”
“Here you are, Mr. Potter,” says the maître de gesturing to Draco’s table before looking around slyly. He turns back to Potter with an excited smile. “And can I just say, Mr. Potter, I am so very thrilled to have you here. If there’s anything you need, anything at all, I will be – “
When he arrives, he is pleased to find the door slightly ajar and the sound of the Professor’s humming leaking out. If Slughorn is in a good mood, it will be that much easier to extract information from him.
Malfoy’s eyes threaten to bug out of their sockets. “Wait it out?” He repeats incredulously. “Wait it out!? You want me to wait this out? Are you fucking kidding me, Potter?” He lets out a frustrated growl. “Why do you have to be so noble all the time?” He moves in closer to Harry. “I know you want me so let’s fu – Granger!”
Harry stood up, slipping himself into the very small gap between Malfoy and the bed. Once he straightened up, Malfoy’s face was centimetres from his, close enough he could feel Malfoy’s warm breath as he stumbled over his words.
“How could you possibly– ” Malfoy swivelled around, a light pinkness growing at the edge of his cheeks. “I have no such spot. Perhaps you’re not as clever as you thought.”
“I’m surprised that I’ve never heard of him. I’m acquainted with most of the Potions Masters across Europe.”
.” Harry hedges. He knows Malfoy fucking knows. He doesn’t know how. But he knows he knows. “In my dreams.”
In all honesty, he’s quite relieved to finally be sitting. Potter’s presence, like always, has made him ridiculously exhausted. If it wouldn’t be considered exceedingly rude, Draco would have already plonked himself on the chaise longue he saw when they passed the sitting room. Still, a chair will do. A chair at the head of the table.
So, when Harry’s eyes open, his brain is much further behind. He’s not really seeing Malfoy pacing in front of him, or hearing Malfoy’s current rant, he’s sort of just floating in a very blurry, muted bubble. Until it pops and Harry’s senses are assaulted all at once. Taking in his surroundings once more, and that old burnt smell, it suddenly clicks where they are: The Room of Requirement.
Harry wonders if he should have clarified he was hoping the match might double as a date. He wonders if Malfoy still would have agreed.
Harry loses some of his arousal when he is brought back to reality. He is supposed to be healing Malfoy but they both seem to have forgotten. He brings the bottle of dittany back up to Malfoy’s chest – still keeping Malfoy distracted with his other hand – and taps one last final drop.
Of course, Pansy came to find him when he didn’t show up for breakfast. He should have expected that. She strode down into Draco’s dormitory without any regard for privacy, but she had also brought an apple, and Draco was starving so he let it slide.
Malfoy’s head raises ever so slightly and he locks eyes with Harry. And Malfoy’s arm keeps moving under the sheets. No. No. This is not right. Harry should drop his gaze, he shouldn’t watch while…but he does. He stares right back at Malfoy, even while Malfoy’s hand moves faster, when the panting gets louder. Right until Malfoy moans out one word before his hand grows still.
“When you two are finished canoodling,” – Pansy winked – “you should come back inside. It looks like they’re going to start the speeches soon.”
Draco calmly set about mixing his paints. He’d perfected a particular shade of green only the day prior, and he wanted to get it exact. He had plenty of time to get it right before he needed to begin sketching. Quidditch practice didn’t start for another twenty minutes or so.
Draco kept his eyes on his knees which he had propped up and crossed over in front of him. He was curious as to who or what Potter would dare, but he knew if he caught Potter’s eye, he’d just start blushing, and that was not something he wanted anyone to see. Not something he wanted
that make us who we are. I watched the good and evil sides of you fight and it was your good side that won.
“I didn’t mean - whatever, Potter.” Draco waved a hand dismissively. “You’re not supposed to be in here. I could dock points.” He gestured to his prefect badge lamely. Merlin - why did he have to always act like a total prat around Potter? No wonder Potter hated his guts.
It’s not exactly how Draco pictured Potter would first spend the night. Not that he had pictured it of course. But let’s just say if,
Harry hopes in another few years, it may yet heal completely. But, regardless, Harry will spend the rest of his life making it up to Draco Malfoy.
to be,” Harry said sulkily, looking back up at Draco. He knew he was being childish but he didn’t particularly care. This had been brewing all night, and eight and a half glasses later, Harry wasn’t so concerned about consequences.
“An erratic heartbeat,” Draco repeated - he was making a habit of doing that. “You’re probably just unfit. It’s not un-“
“Um,” Harry said, turning back to Malfoy. “I just mean, you can have it. I’ll bring it to you, at the Manor.” Malfoy winced. “Or at the Ministry, if you like,” Harry corrected, quickly changing course. “Do Ministers get lunch breaks?”
In the cage, there is only one Draco Malfoy, hair shooting up in weird angles, as if he’s been struck by lightning. His shirt looks like a patchwork design, almost as if the spell didn’t know which clothes to keep him in. And his eyes dart around the room frantically, landing anywhere but on Harry.
spell,” Draco accuses, raising his head to fix Harry with a glare. The malice in it would be harsher if it weren’t for the tears running down Draco’s cheeks.
There was a loud swoosh behind Harry and when he turned, he saw George on the floor, tears falling down his face in laughter. Except he was completely silent.
Harry wakes up in a cold sweat, his breathing labored. He takes a quick look around to make sure he hasn’t woken his dormmates, before settling back into bed, stubbornly ignoring his body’s inappropriate reaction to whatever the fuck that just was.
,” Malfoy corrects, smiling pleasantly at Harry’s friends and holding out a hand. Ron and Hermione both shake it.
Harry wasn’t scheduled to be back from his overseas Auror operation for another day. He’d been planning to owl ahead but then decided to surprise his husband instead. Harry had been working so much, they’d hardly seen each other since Christmas. Harry often debated whether he should just retire and spend every waking moment with Draco. He loved his work too. Just not as much.
“Like now, you mean?” Draco countered. He was only teasing really - Potter had softened him up with his drunk ramblings - but Potter must not have picked up his change in tone.
Harry rolls his eyes. Really, it’s a simple potion for eyesight. There’s nothing remotely poisonous in the ingredients. “You’re not going to die.”
Malfoy’s face screws up. He takes a step forward, using his slight height on Harry to his advantage. “You clearly don’t know anything so why don’t you keep your mouth shut?”
Harry couldn’t help but laugh a little at that. Draco’s dramatics could be frustrating but they were always entertaining. “Stop being ridiculous. When are you going to stop playing?”
The moon is almost full. Its light burns Harry’s skin through his dorm window, a persistent ache that won’t be ignored. Still, he doesn’t move. At this time of the month, the light will find him no matter how hard he hides. Facing it is easier.
Harry drops his head. “Sorry.” Dread eats into him from every corner of his body. He feels light-headed.
And when finally, he’s taken the last bite, he gives one last smug glare to Potter – although he’s not sure of Potter’s reaction because his eyes won’t focus – and storms out of the house. If Draco were thinking straight, he’d congratulate himself on a dramatic exit. But there’s a whirling sound in his ears and his brain is concentrating on simply holding Draco up. He’s dizzy and disorientated and sick. Very sick. In fact, he’s going to
Harry lets the weight drag him to the floor beside Malfoy. And then he asks the question he doesn’t want to, but
Draco meant to scoff but an entirely different sound came out of his mouth. “If you had any decency, you’d fold them neatly by my robes.”
Potter’s hand found Draco’s and pulled him down onto the bed. “A simple ‘I love you, too’ would have sufficed, you know?” he whispered before bringing his lips up to Draco’s.
Harry’s legs snapped shut (to Draco’s disappointment) and he stood up. “Peters had me go over his entire caseload for the next month,” Harry said, as if Draco needed an explanation. He knew Harry wasn’t the type that fucked his employees in his office - however much Draco wanted him to be.
Potter stood exactly above Draco and looked down at him, blocking his view of the night sky, and impeding it with everything Draco wished to avoid.
Ron attempts to stifle a laugh from where he sits beside her at the Gryffindor table but is unsuccessful. Hermione shoots him a dark look before turning back to Harry. “No need to sass me, Harry. I’m trying to help.”
“She’s asked me to have dinner with someone every night,” he says in a hushed tone. “I’m not allowed to eat alone.”
“Harry,” Draco says. “All I’ve wanted all these years is to find a way to be with you. You must know that I love you more than anything. But after everything my family’s done, after everything
“Yes,” he says after a second. Draco strains his ears but he knows he has no hope of hearing. He can only hope Pansy is not in the mood to embarrass him tonight.
. He hopes it comes across. It does. Potter takes a sip, or pretends to (oh no – he definitely takes a sip, his face screws up in hardly disguised distaste) and places the glass down. Draco gives him a curt nod.
And then he folded them - the incorrect way but Draco let that one slide - and placed them on the chair where Draco’s robes hung. It would have been childish if the act itself hadn’t left Draco completely naked. With a completely clothed Potter. Draco had no way to hide that the situation had left him quite seriously aroused.
Just as Draco’s pondering this, as if accio-ed by his thoughts, who else but Harry Potter appears in the door of the hospital room, looking horribly flushed and sweaty.
get to suck Potter’s dick. “I mean,” Draco clarified, trying to downgrade his obvious interest. “I don’t
“Excellent,” Percy said pushing past Harry. “Now we simply must get a move on. Come along, father. I’m sure Mr Malfoy doesn’t want to be late on his first day.”
Still, regardless of all that, this is stupid. Stupid because he’s going to have dinner with Harry fucking Potter. Stupid because the restaurant they have picked is far more romantic than Draco realised. And stupid because the only reason he’s here is to avoid being hospitalized. A condition from his mother’s doctor: He must have dinner with someone every day so that’s he’s not tempted to skip it.
for working out how to make staring at each other’s butts possible even without their own eyesight. God bless you.
Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s hands and swivelled the both of them around so he had Draco pinned to the wall. He held their hands against the wall by Draco’s head and pushed his hips forward, so Draco could
Malfoy appears unphased by the revelation. “Oh, yes,” he says, setting his knife and fork down delicately. “I thought it was an improvement. If people suspect I’m sleeping with Potter, it helps my social standing.”
On the other side it’s dark and quiet. Not quite the environment Harry expected a cry (or letter) for help to have come from. Still, he’s not about to quit now. If Draco is in any danger, Harry has to help. When his eyes adjust to the darkness, Harry realises the fireplace has dropped him into an empty bedroom. Is this where Draco sleeps then? But why does it have to be here at Malfoy Manor? Sure, the room is much larger and the bed looks much comfier than the tiny dorm at Hogwarts, but Harry seriously doubts a student’s comfort needs warrant activating a fireplace for free travel back and forth.
“When you’re out of hospital, you can choose where we go to dinner first,” Pansy suggests, and then her lips fall into a smirk. “That’s if you haven’t already got plans with a certain saviour?”
Harry’s brain is about to short-circuit. There’s too much he doesn’t know. That he doesn’t understand. And there’s one bit that he doesn’t get at all. If he turned Malfoy into
“Blaise told me of course,” Pansy said to Draco as her eyes unsubtly surveyed Potter. “I think you’ve made him a little jealous, actually. Good for you. I thought you would still be pining for him after– “
“How long have you had her?” He asks as he peels back the lid, and shakes the food out into Pepper’s bowl. She’s pushing her way into eat before he’s finished and Draco accidentally gets a bit of meat on her head. He quickly brushes it off before Potter notices.
fussed by, was the dare Potter received from Seamus just after midnight. (The traitor - Draco had thought they’d become good friends this year.)
“Isn’t there a potion?” Harry asks. He’s sure Ron mentioned something about this last week but he was only half-listening. It had been the day Malfoy flew paper cranes around his head in Potions and earnt them a shared detention, and Harry had been too focused on perfecting his glaring technique.
The thought of Ron going after Malfoy isn’t completely unwelcome. There’s a part of Harry that’s angry with Malfoy, angry that Malfoy put so much into that kiss only to reject Harry. That part of Harry is very eager for revenge. But the rest of Harry, the larger part, is sad. And very much in love with Malfoy.
, Potter,” Malfoy yells. “And for Merlin’s sake, please tell me they taught you something other than Expelliarmus in your Auror training.”
Fuck. “They’re long,” Harry said because it was the only explanation he could think of. Inside, he was screaming at himself for opening his mouth at all. He felt his face heating up. Why had he said that?
Draco sat up, a familiar anxiety settling in his stomach. He’d been at college less than half an hour and, of course, he’d already made an enemy of his dormmate. “Well,” he said defensively, “what was I supposed to make out of
Harry spends at least ten minutes chasing one particularly enthusiastic eyeball around the cupboard. He finally catches it in an ill-considered lunge that, although successful, also sends his foot crashing down over a cache of vials beside Malfoy.
“I don’t care whose bed we do it in,” Draco said, and then started giggling. Actually giggling. It reminded Harry very much of Teddy -  the giggling, not the casual explicit flirting.
Draco was on his feet and twirling around in an instant, his wand pointed at Harry, the flames faltering sadly behind him. Perhaps surprising Draco when he was armed hadn’t been Harry’s wisest move.
the time, to consider how jacked Malfoy was. Pulled back into Malfoy’s body (and subsequently, his very, very
Some wizards had a different view. That the strength of a singular focus could work itself like an unconscious spell, creating magical power in a word, an idea, a date (for example), that you never intended.
him. And Draco was – at least he hoped, he was a little too dazed to concentrate properly – kissing him back.
They had stopped dancing now. Draco wasn’t sure who had stopped first, all he knew is that he still had one hand in Potter’s, the other on his back, and he couldn’t move. Couldn’t look away from Potter’s eyes. He wanted to say yes. He was
out of his dorm, Draco realised that maybe, just maybe, Pansy knew more than he gave her credit for.
Malfoy looked away, immediately disinterested and Hermione stopped the pretence and ran to Ron, settling into his lap before finally kissing him. The room groaned again.
“Please don’t replace one denial with the next. I can’t bear it.” Pansy says flinging her head into her hands dramatically.
When Draco finally turns up in first period Potions, Harry moves lightning fast, taking the seat beside him before his Slytherin friends can. He hears the snickers of Parkinson and Nott behind him but he doesn’t care. He’s been losing his mind the last few days without Draco.
Draco acted quickly, detangled himself from Harry and apparating to Teddy’s side where he had fallen in the dirt, while Harry calmly walked the five metres.
“You don’t have to call me that,” Draco reminded him. He didn’t much like sharing the same title as his father, and he certainly wasn’t Dobby’s master anymore.
But Draco must not want to give his game away either because he comes back with: “You look tired. There are bags under your eyes,” in the most casual
“I don’t need help,” Draco says through gritted teeth. Why must everyone treat him like a child? He can look after himself. “And I’m not going to the hospital. I’m already seeing a doctor.”
Draco circles his finger around the rim of his wine glass. “So, you’re still allowed to threaten innocent civilians?”
Hours later, Hermione has completed all their week’s paperwork. Harry has added a date to a blank piece of parchment of which he has no use for.
Harry walks further towards the light, to the bed. He can’t help it. It is as if he’s being drawn in, beckoned, called to. Who is he to fight such a divine call? But this is where the trouble starts.
Professor Slughorn enters the classroom. With a curious look at Harry sitting next to Draco, he starts the lesson, explaining the potion they will be brewing. Harry isn’t listening.
“Good,” Draco said. It had been what he’d wanted to hear. So why did it make him feel slightly nauseous? “That’s…good.”
Come to his birthday dinner? Draco had never asked Harry to anything before. Did that mean Draco thought of him as a friend? Harry’s surprise, and an excitement he’d never admit aloud, must have been obvious in his face because Draco quickly clarified further.
“Harry thought perhaps the people who raided the Ministry were also responsible for the attack here.’
“Perfect. We’ll have that.” Draco says quickly, handing over the drinks menu. He can’t bear to look back down at it.
Harry stares up at Malfoy’s mud soaked back. He seems to have forgotten about his robes. Was he really just using Zabini to push Harry away? It doesn’t make any sense. Not to mention it was a horrible plan that failed miserably.
Harry pulled Draco’s hands into his own, intertwining their fingers. More warmth spread through Draco’s body. That’s when the answer dawned on him.
“If you can really mean it,” Harry challenges. He regrets it a little when Malfoy takes a step towards him, his face reddening in anger. He really needs to learn to tone it down on the sass when he is the one tied up and wandless.
“I would hope that’s most people's type of place.” Draco says with a shrug, feeling more like a jackass with each passing second. “Pansy probably wants to see me anyway.”
He stashed the ring back away only when he realised he was running late for work, but he couldn’t stop thinking about it. He couldn’t wait for Draco to propose. He couldn’t wait to say yes.
” Potter said in that teasing voice that Draco loved as much as he hated it, “that I was being inappropriate.”
. Draco had always though giving a blowjob was about giving pleasure and receiving just about receiving pleasure, but he was starting to see how wrong he was. One of Potter’s hands was curled so tight in Draco’s hair that it made his scalp tingle. The other, quite the opposite, was tracing gentle delicate patterns below his ear, sending lightning fast shivers across his whole body, reminiscent of the dared hickey(s) Potter had left on Draco’s neck two years ago.
Muggles would call it a self-fulfilling prophecy. You anticipate something to happen so strongly that you end up seeking it out yourself, creating your own destiny and yet still calling it fate.
“Oh!” Hermione’s face reddens. She clearly has read something about it. “Yes. I’ll just leave then.” She turns to the classroom door.
Harry ran a tentative hand over the mark, and Draco was surprised when it didn’t burn. It always burned. But Harry didn’t seem content with that small miracle. His face knit together in concentration again and he bowed his head down to the Dark Mark.
Draco was right of course. Potter returned immediately after practice, flushed and sweaty, expecting results. Draco didn’t have much to show yet - he’d spent most of his time working on mixing the right shades of green. But at the same time, he was almost certainly showing too much. Potter stared at the canvas for far too long.
“I’ll handle it,” interrupts Narcissa briskly, already heading after her son. She pauses at the end of the corridor and turns back to them, looking between Professor Slughorn and Madam Pomfrey. “Thank you for curing him. I am in your debt,” she says in a much softer voice, before racing back after Draco.
It was Potter, home early, his face flushed and eyes ever so slightly out of focus behind his glasses. They landed on Draco with instant recognition.
Malfoy’s face changed, indignant accusation replaced with whatever the feeling was that made Malfoy blush like a fire engine. That was interesting.
Harry blanches at the jab. He’s been struggling in Potions ever since he spilt his potion on Malfoy. His fear of fucking a potion up again and hurting someone has made it impossible to concentrate properly. He finds himself checking the recipes over and over to ensure he’s adding the right ingredients. But then he’s stirring clockwise instead of anti-clockwise, or adding a dash instead of a sprinkle of something, or dicing instead of slicing. Before the incident, he had been on his way to obtaining an O for Outstanding from Horace, even without the help of the Half-Blood Prince. Now, he’ll be lucky to get an A for Acceptable.
Draco resigned himself to that fact and focused all his energy into the painting. If Potter liked it, Draco might just show him all the other finished canvases locked away in his dormitory too. It was about time someone else saw Draco’s work. And who better than Draco Malfoy’s muse, Harry Potter?
“Because,” Malfoy looked up into Harry’s eyes, his voice a whisper, “how could I think I’d ever have a chance with you?”
“Harry,” Draco said Harry’s name, more breath than vocal chords, holding him tighter still. Harry knew exactly how he felt.
Since the first incident, Harry has begun to notice Draco more and more. He is only just starting to realise he’d spent the whole eighth year ignoring Draco. How could he have missed the way Draco took absences midway through every class? Was he really so wrapped up in himself?
Malfoy crosses his arms. "I've been keeping this secret for years, waiting for the right time to tell you. And you think you can
Of course, Draco wouldn’t have minded if Harry threw his weight around a little. The fantasies Draco had of Harry often involved him doing just that - albeit with a few orders that would be highly inappropriate for the workplace. But no matter how obviously Draco pined, Harry still didn’t seem to notice. He really had no idea of his effect on people.
. Maybe it’s only small but it must be there. Or why else would Malfoy have kissed him like that? Why else is Malfoy watching Harry from behind his Defence Against the Dark Arts book, attempting (and failing) to be discreet?
“What has that got to - “ Draco’s voice faltered and turned into a moan when Harry wrapped a hand around his dick and started stroking him. With how turned on he already was, Draco knew it wouldn’t be long until he came. It wasn’t exactly how he’d wanted to finish but at this point, he’d have taken any form of release.
day when it fucking mattered, he’d left the house in a daze, just for a quick, lazy coffee. He’d run a comb through his hair at least, but still! He wasn’t even wearing a collared shirt for fuck’s sake. He looked positively pedestrian.
“I don’t know. I just do.” The same way he knew the exact gel Malfoy used on his hair every morning (Merlin’s Magic), the same way he knew how Malfoy liked his eggs (poached), and the same way he knew Malfoy’s favourite colour (red).
. That’s why it was delivered to him. On the back page, there is a single word, drawn in a messy italic scrawl:
Percy poked his head into the bathroom. “Quiet down, you two. I’ve an appointment with– what on earth did you do to your hair, Harry?”
“Yeah,” Harry said automatically, but as soon as he did, he felt exposed so he coughed and added as nonchalantly as possible (so not very): “if you want.”
“Bye, Potter,” Blaise said sweetly. “Draco looks forward to the opportunity to hear your parseltongue once more.”
Surprise flitted across Malfoy’s face before he contained it. He nodded. “Good. I’m glad you’ve finally developed some sense.”
“Now, Potter, Granger,” Malfoy says with false sweetness from his chair by the fire, “please tell me how I can assist your investigation.”
Except when Draco went to pull back the first time, he decided that perhaps he’d give it one final suck up and down, for his own benefit,
“Miss Perkins,” Harry began gently, “Please return the bubotuber pus to the storerooms. You are not to touch top shelf ingredients until fifth year. Mr Calloway, please do not place your cauldron on the open flames upside down. It will become damaged and I’m sure your parents won’t be keen on replacing it out of their pocket. As for the rest of you, there’s only twenty minutes remaining of class, I suggest you make headway on your potion. What is it they are supposed to be making, Professor Malfoy?”
Draco smiled, warm and soft at every edge, and he leaned across the table, taking Harry’s face in his hands. Harry was right – they
“Fine,” Draco answers automatically except his throat is dry so it comes out a little choked up. Not exactly what he was going for.
hard, actually. Although I’ve never heard one from your mouth so perhaps you don’t know that. Merlin forbid, the great Harry Potter ever do anything wrong.
being a bit ridiculous but there was no need for Potter to lose his cool completely.  He couldn’t very well continue their argument when Potter was laughing.
“I’m attracted to you,” Harry repeated. It was too late to retract it. “Happy now, Malfoy? That’s why I watch you. The way you are with Teddy - it’s
Harry stares back at Draco while the sound of the train’s departure roars in their ears. As the train exits the station, the sound fades to a whisper and then to a silence between them. Finally, after years, there’s nothing in their way.
“Yes, of course,” Potter replied smoothly with a charming – not that Draco was charmed at all, just in general – smile. He leaned into Draco’s side as Pansy walked away, his breath warming Draco’s ear as he whispered: “Unless you’d prefer me to be
When they split apart, Draco had no time to talk to Harry, as they were both pulled into separate hugs by Weasley family members. And it kept going – Draco received hugs and pats on the back from what seemed like everyone at the party.  There were words of encouragement too:
interested. But I obviously didn't account for your arrogance. It won't happen again.” He turns away, gesturing for Zabini to follow.
kiss. But he supposes it was important to Draco, so it should be important to him.  “You can do it before our next kiss,” he suggests, hoping the next one will be sooner rather than later.
Draco drew his eyes up from Potter’s jaw - had that widened as well? No, Draco was reading into things now. He hadn’t seen Potter in months. Not since the end of school. A lot had changed, but plenty hadn’t. The hair - that made Draco feel slightly better about his own - so untamed and unpredictable, never committing to a single part line, the smile, cheeky and knowing and above all, warm, and those eyes, just as piercing and still framed by those boyish round glasses.
And then Draco is falling both metaphorically and physically, and in at least one of those instances, but probably both, Potter catches him with gentle hands. It would be romantic if it weren’t for the fact that Draco was far too out of it to appreciate it at all.
“The less people that know, the better. He deserves to live a decent life just like everyone else, no matter how he was born. So, will you bind my hands, or am I to be peacefully escorted to the Ministry?” Malfoy asks conversationally.
Draco closed his eyes after saying it when he realised he didn’t want to know Potter’s reaction. He wasn’t being smooth anymore. Just sappy.
After that, it was back to dares again, which were almost always some variation of kissing someone else in the room, as if there was no other possible dare.
He doesn’t even realise he’s reaching out to touch them when Malfoy’s voice freezes him in his tracks.
Harry knows he’s not here to play chess. He’s here to solve the mystery of Malfoy’s behaviour, of his late-night trips, but it’s not as if Malfoy is going to floo off in front of him now. So, what can it hurt if he plays a harmless game of chess? If anything, he needs to be building Malfoy’s trust in order for Malfoy to reveal more to him. Yes, that’s it.
Malfoy smirked. “Not now, you daft idiot.” He pushed his hair back behind his ear. Harry’s eyes followed.
“Harry, dear,” she said, looking up, “would you like some– ” her voice turned squeaky as she took in his appearance– “breakfast?”
Draco pulled back before Potter could land the kiss and took a deep stabilising breath. “I love you.” He was still testing the words but the moment they left his mouth, he knew they were genuine. He only wished he could see Harry’s reaction. “You can kiss me now,” he added and closed his eyes.
Harry makes sure he’s alone before opening the door and stepping through. He can’t have any first years reporting a mysterious opening door and drawing attention to Malfoy’s location. Slughorn did say it was better the less people that knew. Although, Harry supposes a self-opening door would be one of the less alarming things to witness around Hogwarts.
Draco turned back to find Potter hurtling towards them, the snitch at the edge of the pitch where they sat in the stands. With his Quidditch robes flying behind him and a fierce determination in his eyes, Potter looked like a dream. In fact, Draco had had this very dream, maybe with a few minor adjustments to the rest of Potter’s clothing. (What clothing?)
“Potter,” he greeted automatically, his voice cold - a reflex.  He turned around quickly, his pencil falling into the grass.
Mrs Dunberg nods mutely, and opens the door wider, gesturing for them to enter. Her fingers are long and bony with nails clearly bitten down to the skin. The rest of her body is covered in long scratches. A terrible image of Malfoy, half werewolf, half man with claws as long as his fingers springs to Harry’s mind unbidden. He shakes it away. Mrs Dunberg escorts them into a small sitting room which must also double as a bedroom since there is a dirty mattress lying in the corner. She takes a seat on an old sitting chair.
He looks around for his next dueller and is surprised to see Malfoy duelling two masked figures at once. There is no sign of the other intruders. He’s just about to assist Malfoy when something – someone – hits him full force in the chest, taking him barrelling to the ground. It’s the attacker he disarmed.
Harry nods. He tries to think of any other questions not involving Draco Malfoy but comes up blank. There’s no avoiding it. “And -” he takes a breath and gestures towards the Malfoy covered in ropes - “who is
Draco didn’t have time to play coy tonight. He made a beeline straight for Potter, only pausing to receive two glasses of champagne from a passing waiter. Potter looked up as Draco approached, narrowing his eyes at the glasses.
A husky sniffling sound brought Draco back to the present - the niffler! It had crawled out from underneath Hagrid’s stove and was shuffling to the snitch, making its greedy little noises as it did. Draco reached for his wand - with his uninjured arm this time - but Potter stopped him with a raised hand. Draco obeyed automatically, but immediately wished he hadn’t. Since when did he follow Harry Potter?
“That’s not what you said,” Potter said seriously, his intense gaze holding Draco in place. “You implied you wouldn’t entertain the thought of sleeping with me simply because you think I’m a lowly waiter beneath your status. Correct me if I’m wrong?”
It first happens on a perfectly ordinary Tuesday night. Harry is completely unsuspecting and unprepared when he falls asleep. His dreams are usually rather plain bar the occasional war-related nightmare, however he’s been getting less and less of those. The pain and guilt still seem to resurrect themselves during his waking hours though. It’s a little harder to shake those feelings off when you’re walking through the very castle where it happened, where so many people died.
like that?) and two, he hadn’t intended on bringing Draco (or anyone else for that matter) home. Which was charming. Merlin, Potter was just so fucking charming.
Coming down from his orgasm, the sound of his and Harry’s heavy breathing suddenly became amplified in Draco’s ears. He really hoped the office actually was empty - they hadn’t even spared a thought for silencing charms. He’d be sure to think of that next time.
Irritation prickles at the back of Harry’s neck at his best friend siding with Malfoy. “Fine. It’s none of your business,” he amends. “Happy now?”
Draco, for once, was left speechless. He could see his mouth gaping through Potter’s eyes but he couldn’t work out how to close it.
have been staged. Harry is almost certain of it. Malfoy isn’t the messy type. If he left it unmade, it was only so Harry would see it. And why would he want Harry to see it unless he needed Harry to think he slept there? It’s the only explanation.
Harry watches Malfoy’s eyebrow descend back down his pale face. Their faces are really very close.  Harry can see every small detail, like the way Malfoy tightens and relaxes his jaw repeatedly and the way his eyes dart frantically over Harry’s face as if he is looking him over in just the same way. Harry looks away, suddenly uncomfortable. “Why are you here?” He asks to his lap.
If the lack of visitors could confirm Malfoy’s innocence, of course, Harry would be pleased. But it doesn’t mean anything. It could mean Malfoy is lying low for a while. It could mean the conspiracy meeting isn’t until next week. It’s frustrating.
He leant in closer still and gently removed Harry’s classes. “Why don’t we give it a bit more spirit?” he whispered.
Harry hesitated a moment too long, before following, Malfoy’s words hitting him. “That’s not what I – wait – Malfoy – don’t.”
Potter - Harry  - blinked back at Draco, his face the depiction of innocence, clearly feigned. “It’s my name.”
Harry isn’t new to jealously. He felt it when Ginny was with Dean Thomas. But this feeling is much worse. Because now that jealously is coupled with unbearable hopelessness. Harry knows that somewhere within that touch exterior, somehow, Malfoy cares for him. Draco told him so himself. True, it was under the influence of a potion, but it was real. It had to be real.
Malfoy cleared his throat. “I just came by to say hello. I thought it was polite given we work in the same building now. Which, of course, you already know.” His eyes darted to the waste basket. Shit.
And then Draco’s face is at Harry’s, the gentle pressure of his lips bringing with it a forceful spark that electrifies Harry’s entire body. Harry can feel the wetness of Draco’s tears spilling onto his own face. He pulls away.
Harry ends up - much to his delight - pressed up against the wall of the corridor, one of Malfoy's hands gripping onto his shirt as if he might rip it off at any moment and the other in Harry's hair. And his mouth, merlin,
Their first task is a simple stakeout outside Malfoy Manor. Narcissa Malfoy had reported that a number of known werewolves, and many who had been involved with Voldemort before fleeing, were often visiting the house at odd hours of the night.
It did. Potter obeyed and slid Draco’s briefs down his legs, a little unnecessarily handsy over his arse (not that Draco was complaining) and teasingly slow down his thighs (not that Draco was complaining). Potter must have taken Draco’s words to heart because he didn’t let go even as Draco’s underwear passed his knees. He held onto them still at Draco’s ankles as Draco awkwardly extracted his legs, so that they never once touched the ground.
Draco’s words cut off in favour of a deep sob that launched itself from his throat. A new round of tears streamed down his face. He dropped his head, rubbing at his face furiously.
When Harry let Draco down into his bed, he tried to do so as gently as possible, as it appeared that Draco had already started to fall -
They reach an alcove around the corner from Slughorn’s office and Harry, figuring its safe to do so, pulls the invisibility cloak off himself and Ron. Hermione doesn’t even blink as they come into sight.
Draco’s jaw tightened. He didn’t usually like being laughed at but when Harry did it like that, staring at him like he knew exactly what he was thinking, it sent a particularly strong feeling to his groin.
Something lodges in Harry’s throat and he is physically incapable of answering the provocative question.
Harry looks up to find Malfoy staring down at him in anger, which doesn’t seem to make sense considering the circumstances. Malfoy releases Harry from the spelled smoke and throws Harry’s wand to the floor, before striding from the classroom.
“But you’re not helping by being antagonistic about it,” Harry finishes. One hand drops down to feel his wand through his trouser pocket – just to know it’s still there. Malfoy’s eyes flicker down as he does, catching the movement.
As Harry knew he would – the broomstick was charmed only to hover not fly, and Teddy had already fallen off many times - Teddy jumped up laughing, no damage but the dirt on his face. “Did you see that, daddy?” He said to Draco excitedly. “Did you see? I did a wonky fete!”
“I asked you to trust me,” Malfoy says which really should be an accusation, and considering Harry’s behaviour, it would be justified, but there’s no malice to Malfoy’s tone.
Just as Harry was about to close his eyes, Malfoy opened his and pulled back slightly. He laughed when Harry’s face dropped.
He was still staring when Potter looked up, his eyes falling on Draco’s. Draco quickly turned his head - making it more obvious he’d been staring - and continued on towards his chair. It was no couch, but it would do.
If his father found out he had lost the pin, he would be in the deepest pools of absolute shitville. It was an heirloom worth more than Hagrid’s entire life, if the pathetic hut he had followed the niffler into was any indication.
As the sun rises, Harry sits there, with Draco Malfoy leaning on his shoulder, wondering if he’ll ever be this close to him again. He looks down at Draco and studies his face. Yes, it is identical to the other Malfoy. They’re part of the same person. But he was wrong earlier. There is something visibly different. It’s not their features that set them apart, it’s the way they use them. The way this Draco can look so sad, so vulnerable. And the way he can smile, so sweet, so genuine, exactly as he does now.
Draco wasn’t giving anything away though. Over dinner, they spoke of work and Ministry gossip, and Draco even mentioned the laundry at one point, which seemed far from proposal dinner talk. Harry was beginning to think that perhaps he had been reading into tonight too much after all until one of the wait staff accidentally dropped off the wrong bill at their table.
Slughorn shuffles in his seat uncomfortably before fixing Harry with piercing eyes. “Do I need to remind you that it was
Draco held back his excitement at the question, his rapidly increasing heartbeat the only tell. Potter would have to work harder for a more obvious sign. “It’s expected I attend, Potter. Of course I’m going.”
And so when the last of the sun surpasses the horizon, Harry wants to shove it right back down. Because he’s not ready for the day to start. He’s not ready to give up Draco Malfoy.
The interview had gone well – Malfoy had been quietly studying Potions in his time abroad and was always something of a prodigy anyway – but when it came to the actual classes…the students were ruthless. They weren’t as forgiving as Harry, not as eager to show an ex-death eater their respect. It didn’t help that Malfoy overcompensated by being a pushover – he must not have wanted to give parents any reason to accuse him of cruelty.
“I did. I do. I don’t know.” Harry shakes his head and pushes matted hair from his eyes; the transformation always leaves him worse for wear. "It’s not that simple, Hermione. There’s so much I have to hold back.”
Harry smiles. He didn’t need the apology to forgive Malfoy but he suspects it meant more to Malfoy to say it aloud. And now that it’s over with…he leans in to Malfoy’s lips ready to start another frantic snogging session.
“You wouldn’t let me go,” Harry explained, wondering why he bothered. He was certain Malfoy wouldn’t believe him. “That’s why I had to wake you up. You were…holding me down and cuddling me.”
Clients? What kind of clients would a werewolf be taking? Harry remains still. Perhaps he should have listened to hypothetical Hermione’s advice.
The room spins. Harry focuses on Malfoy’s face, waiting for the punchline. “But Teddy’s not– he never showed signs of– you’re lying.”
With the pain still radiating in his arm, Draco pulled himself into a sitting position and slumped against the corridor wall. If it was a stinging jinx like Draco suspected, then it would have been one of Potter’s Gryffindor crew. They’d grown rather audacious in their saviour’s absence.
Don’t stop,” he said to Draco. Distraction or not, being kissed on the neck was a particular weakness of his, and he wasn’t about to give it up that easily.
Pansy rolls her eyes and sticks her tongue out at this. “You know I hate it when people talk cryptically.”
But the more he thought about it, the angrier he got. He had the snitch first. It was his. If Malfoy hadn’t cheated – because that’s what it was, cheating! – then Harry would never have lost. Malfoy was a cheater and Harry was going to make sure he damn well knew it.
Over the next few days, he monitors Malfoy closely. Malfoy never appears at mealtimes, only for classes, and at the end of the day he disappears as if in a rush, hurriedly leaving before his friends can catch up to him. There is definitely something wrong.
Fuck. Fucking fuck. Fucking fuck fuck. Well, he won’t be so cocky tonight. Or perhaps he will be cocky, very cocky, but in a completely different way. And Harry’s alright with that. Because he’s pretty sure that while he’s getting off with Draco Malfoy every night, he can win over Draco Malfoy in the morning, day by day.  It’s a challenge. And Merlin knows, Harry Potter’s more than a match for Draco Malfoy.
, Malfoy,” Potter accused, ignoring the joke. “You ignore me, almost constantly, except for one day, and then you wonder why I’m so…so
“When I what?” Harry prompted, his eyes glued to Malfoy’s face. There was an adorable pink tint to the sharp edges of Malfoy’s cheekbones.
Harry ran a hand through his new hair, feeling off balance when it continued further down his neck than usual. “I’m not sure what happened. I think it’s some sort of accident. I thought Mr Weasley– ”
One day, instead of sitting idly in the quiet Potions study room, he started flicking through one of the Potions books, which turned into looking over the ingredients in the cupboard, which turned into brewing a relaxation potion. It turned out terrible of course, and Harry was far from relaxed, but after that he didn’t need to lie anymore. The excuse became his reality.
He knew it was coming, but Harry still groaned when Pansy Parkinson announced it was time for truth or dare. “What are we? Twelve?” He muttered to Ron.
“Are you going to come on me, Potter?” Draco teased, egging Potter on, hoping he’d hit the right mark with his tone. He wanted it to be sexy but voicing dirty talk always had the risk of turning silly.
“Of course not, Travers,” Hermione interrupts diplomatically. “However, in this particular case, given the age of the afflicted person, and the negative press attention, wouldn’t it be in everyone’s best interest if we were to provide the potion?”
But it was nothing compared to waking up the next morning with Malfoy, the real Malfoy, snuggled into his chest, an arm tightly clinging to his torso.
The woman on stage – she had finally introduced her name as Hermione – was still talking, boring the crowd with the obligatory romanticizing of the year’s politics and all that the Mayor had done for his community, etcetera. It would have been more convincing had the Mayor bothered to attend the event he was hosting.
The bang like a cannon-blast as Voldemort’s spell backfired moments earlier still rings in Harry’s ears. So loud he can’t hear the voices of Hermione and Ron as they envelop him, or anyone else remaining in the Great Hall for that matter. He knows from their faces they’re shouting –  screaming even –  but the chants and cheers are lost on him.
Potter to hear him - he wanted Potter to hear the moment he came all over his face - or the image of his face at least. Not that he would ever let Potter know exactly what he was doing.
And then, if you would believe it, which you must because it’s happening, Malfoy brings his hand back and (gently?) strokes his dick from the outside of his underpants. Which is so ridiculous and teasing that the only explanation is that he’s putting on a show especially for Harry. But, wait, of course he would be doing that. This is Harry’s fucking dream. Well not his
“It means,” Harry said, answering Draco’s unfinished question, “the next time I fuck you, it’s going to be over the Head Auror’s desk.”
?” Harry interrupted, his mind ticking over into overdrive. Draco had been talking about having sex with
FUCKING MOTHER OF MERLIN’S BABY,” Malfoy yells, swaying forward slightly – Harry holds his shoulder firmly. “Please tell me that’s it.”
The snitch fluttered in front of his fingertips. Just one inch further and he’d have it. The snitch would be his. Gryffindor would win, only by 30 points – the Slytherin chasers were impressive this season – but still a win all the same. Harry shifted his body as far forward as he dared – careful not to tilt the broom forward and lose his balance. He strained his arm to grasp –
“It sounds like you don’t really know what you mean, Potter, so I’d advise you to stop wasting your breath. This conversation is over.”
It’s definitely Malfoy making the sounds now – staggered moans between panting breaths that Harry can feel on his neck. Harry’s own eyes close as he loses himself to the moment. His cock is pressed up against Malfoy’s thighs and hardening with each sound. He wants to touch himself the way he’s touching Malfoy but when he brings his other hand between them, he remembers it’s not empty.
Harry nodded quickly, scrambling to his feet. He could see Draco doing the same on the other side of the table.
Harry couldn’t even process the fact that Draco had managed to cast a non-verbal spell while  simultaneously saying the incantation to another spell aloud, because he was still hooked on the wink. Draco Malfoy had winked at him. A somewhat drunk Draco Malfoy had winked at him.
Potter looked around, a glint in his eye revealing the promise of a challenge before he spoke. “Shame there are no witnesses.”
Hearing Draco’s whispered voice in his ear brings Harry back to an earlier time. It’s both vivid and distant all at once. Harry allows the memory to fade as quickly as it comes to him - clinging onto to such things never helped in the past.
Granger was soon laughing too and Draco grew angry. He didn’t like being made the fool. Especially not by the perfect golden trio.
“Look at me and Ron,” Hermione adds. “We wasted all this time tiptoeing around each other before admitting our feelings and we could have died today. Just like that.” She nods at Harry. “You
Malfoy pulls away, leaning back in his chair once more. He folds his arms. His voice is insincere when he speaks. “My deepest apologies, Auror Potter. How may I assist with your investigation?”
And when it comes (yes pun, motherfucking pun here) to the end, and Malfoy leans down and presses his lips hungrily over Harry’s for the first time while they both finish into their hands and over each other, Harry could just fucking melt. In fact, maybe he does. Because the next thing he knows he’s waking up in his own bed. And it’s really not the bed he wants to be in right now.
“Is that what gets you in the mood?” Potter continue to joke, but his voice had taken on an excited edge. “Would you prefer me to be quiet?”
Potter laughed. “My apologies for keeping you waiting, Malfoy. Slow isn’t really your style, is it? Would you rather I start straight at my cock and stroke myself for you? Can you hear that? That’s my hand sliding up and down my cock already. Is that what you wanted, Malfoy? Are you going to touch yourself in time with me, Malfoy? Go on, Malfoy. I’d love to hear you too.”
They continue work in silence except for the occasional whisper of a summoning or cleaning charm. The ingredients stored in the cupboard vary significantly in ick-factor from benign plant powders to live newt eyeballs that keep attempting to roll off the edge of the top shelf, coating everything in their path with a film of sticky eye-goo.
Draco held back a gasp. Harry was in Draco’s office – in the middle of the Ministry of Magic – atop his desk, completely naked.
“Sorry– I mean, never mind.” Harry keeps his eyes well above Malfoy’s neck. “Do you have any dittany?”
Madam Pomfrey’s lips twitch. “I was able to take some of your potion from his clothes but it had already dried out. It’ll be difficult to work out the antidote with only that, but not impossible. I’ll have to speak with Horace. You should go back to your dormitory, Mr Potter.”
Draco finally looks at Potter who is staring at him, eyebrows raised, mouth slightly ajar. He looks ridiculous. “Relax, Potter, I’ll pay for it.”
Malfoy shrugged. He disappeared down a spiral staircase by what looked to be a floor to ceiling aquarium, but Harry suspected was the middle of the Great Lake. Harry followed to find Malfoy bending over a trunk. His hair had fallen forward revealing the pale skin at the back of his neck and the pink edges around his ears.
“No, I’m not,” Harry said shaking his head, lips widening into a slow smile as he worked something out. “I think– I think it’s you.”
“I’m serious,” Malfoy said. He passed the firewhisky back to Harry. They’d almost drunk half the bottle. “Sometimes it’s like there’s a ten-foot wand shoved right up your– ”
Draco said, tilting his head thoughtfully and blinking through eyelashes Harry only just realised were strikingly long. “I know what I’d say to you.”
“No, don’t leave,” Harry calls out desperately. If he’s left alone with Malfoy... “I don’t want to – “
Harry resists the urge to roll his eyes. He is determined to be a mature adult even if Draco isn’t. “Malfoy, don’t be dramatic.”
Harry and Hermione perch themselves carefully on the torn-up couch opposite. “Is Mr Dunberg home?” Hermione asks.
me. You must know I’m right. Look at you. You’re a skeleton. If I’d known you were this bad, I’d have come back sooner. You need to go to hospital.
Malfoy looks past Harry’s shoulder, avoiding his eye. “It doesn’t change the fact that you’re in love with someone else. You’re not in love with me. As I really am.” Malfoy takes a shaky breath. “I’m not perfect like
Harry watched fondly as Draco pulled a giggling Teddy into a tight embrace, peppering raspberries all over his face. At first Harry had been surprised how affectionate and loving Draco was, both to him and to Teddy, but the more time he spent with Draco, the more he realised it made perfect sense.
Malfoy didn’t even look embarrassed by this. If anything, he seemed to enjoy making his situation even more prominent by leaning up against the wall beneath the showerhead and jerking his pelvis forward. “I meant everything I said on the pitch.”
“And…um - “ Draco hesitated. Was he really going to do this? - “What are you wearing?” Yes, apparently he was.
Harry couldn’t understand it. He directed a gentle half-smile at Draco, trying to quell the inexplicable tears. Draco stood up, still clutching the letter in one hand and ran from the Great Hall. Heads turned as he did; students whispered to each other, rumours already beginning. With his heart still throbbing low in his chest, Harry followed.
And this isn’t Harry’s fantasy dream. Merlin, it never was. This is the real Malfoy. Waiting for Harry. On all fucking fours. Like, what even is this? And he turns his head to look Harry with a smirk, a fucking smirk, the bastard. He knows exactly what he’s doing to Harry. He always has.
Harry goes to walk to his desk but Hermione’s already standing in front of it. He looks up at her with a weak smile. “I had a shower?”
It was Malfoy’s time to blush, although Harry felt vindicated to see that when Malfoy blushed, there was no hiding it. Not with those tall cheekbones and deathly pale skin. “I don’t see how that’s any of
“Boring!” Pansy called out, irritated that her plan hadn’t been successful. She didn’t know that Potter had asked
Malfoy stops moving and smiles. “What I want and what I should want are two very different things.” He turns away and stares back at the fireplace. “How can it be that I’m still so selfish even without…”
A small sad smile appears on Malfoy’s face before it is quickly replaced with something bigger. Could this be a genuine smile from Draco Malfoy? “Are you concerned about me, Harry?’
“It was awful. He brought roses!” Teddy added as he bounded into the room, taking up his favourite position on Harry’s desktop - right on top of his important case files.
Again, Draco, tried to close the curtains, but Harry was much stronger. Much less tired. “I don’t want your help,” Draco said, and then because he could feel his glamour slipping, “Leave me alone!”
Draco swivelled around to greet Pansy, making a quick silent appraisal of her outfit – a slinky black velvet number with a surprisingly conservative but flattering high neckline: stunning, as always. “How did–”
poorly of Draco? “I have better manners than you,” Draco pointed out. He resisted the urge to bring up Potter’s lack of coaster. That may have come across a little
Harry’s senses are overloaded with Draco, fresh spearmint – his breath, dazzling grey – his eyes, heat, electricity, spark – his body so close, all but touching, and absolutely and completely kissable – his lips. Harry tries not to stare at them, he does. Because he already knows he can’t. There’s no temptation strong enough.
Harry turns back to Malfoy and takes in the wound: four deep scratches in the middle of Malfoy’s chest that disappear over his right shoulder. The surrounding skin has been cleaned meticulously and none of the slashes are bleeding, but they’re still too wide. Whatever anti-bleeding charm Malfoy has cast cannot be anything but a temporary fix.
Now, Draco had sucked cock before. He hadn’t just been sitting around pining after Potter for two (nine) years or something ridiculous like that. But he’d always wondered about Potter’s cock. Potter’s cock sucking skills had popped into his head the first time he’d
Draco snorted. As if Potter should be the one to get off after the state he had left Draco in last year! “How romantic.”
The days in the Hospital usually went quickly as there was always a constant stream of patients to be assessed. Draco was hoping this particular day would be the same, as it was November third, and as soon as he got home, he was going to call Harry Potter.
Harry waits for the challenge. Waits for Malfoy to tell him he was going easy on him, waits for the declaration of another game in which Harry will surely lose.
Though Harry supposes it is rude of him to judge. Malfoy is doing it in his own bed. Harry’s the one who shouldn’t be here. Wait. Hold up. He isn’t here. This is a
Harry looks over the cut. It covers most of Malfoy’s back and continues across his chest. It’s a lot of area to cover. “I think I’m going to need to add another four or maybe five–”
“Please don’t say anything, Harry,” interrupts Draco once more. “It’s just going to make this harder. Just let me…I need to tell you something before they cure me. It’s important.” Draco’s eyes are wet now, and staring into Harry’s intently. ”He’s…I mean I’m going to tell you it’s not true, but I like you, Harry. I’ve always liked you. Before all of this. I don’t want to live the way I do. I’m scared and stupid and a coward, but you can help me, Harry. Maybe, I’d do it for you, Harry.”
Harry’s hands fell away from the hem of Draco’s long-sleeved shirt immediately. There was no disappointment or question in his face, only a flicker of concern that he quickly covered. Harry knew how much Draco detested pity.
“Yes, of course I’m aware, Potter. Her prejudices are ingrained but she’s doing the best to make up for it now. Please refrain from judging her.”
Harry laughed. “That’s nothing to you. Selfish. Arrogant. Inconsiderate. Entitled.” The words came out easy after years of holding them back.
Malfoy’s moans slowly become higher pitched, his pants heavier; there’s precum all over Harry’s hand and he knows Malfoy’s close. He keeps a steady rhythm to his strokes to help guide Malfoy there, and watches his face so he can catch the moment.
Harry couldn’t imagine Malfoy taking any muggle classes, let alone getting his hands dirty making pottery. But whether Malfoy was lying or not, it didn’t matter. Because: “You didn’t say Potter.”
“I’ve been doing some reading. Asphodel root works differently depending on how it’s used and is very susceptible to the magical properties of other ingredients. If we can just work out how it reacted to the other ingredients, we can hypothesize what happened to Malfoy.”
“I can do whatever I want, especially when I’m being ignored.” Draco turned and headed back down the stairs. He wanted to run away but he had to preserve his dignity. Instead he would walk calmly to the apparition point, disapparate to the Manor and never leave home again. Perhaps he was being dramatic, but what else could he be when he felt like his heart had been stomped on?
Without any other option, Harry ducks into the first room he finds and hovers behind the slightly ajar door, waiting for the footsteps to pass him. Harry listens, holding his breath, as whoever it is climbs the stairs. Just before the footsteps reach him, a familiar female voice whispers, “Incendio,” bathing the corridor in light, and allowing Harry to see clearly a woman with long blonde hair passing by him: Narcissa Malfoy.
“Have you found out what’s wrong with him?” She asks, looking thoroughly exasperated and impatient with him. Which he supposes he deserves, especially consider his answer.
Harry watched his younger self from the memory grow more and more frantic when the spell didn’t work and blood continued to pour from Malfoy’s wounds. There were tears in Harry’s eyes – both watching and living the memory. He hadn’t expected how much seeing this memory would still affect him. He turned to the older Malfoy, who stood beside him, watching the scene with an unnatural stiffness.
But before he was given the spotlight, the content of the dares made the choice a little bit harder. Draco wasn’t fussed that Weasley had been dared to take off his pants or that Pansy had already kissed Luna twice - once on her turn when she dared Luna to kiss her, and then once on Luna’s turn when Luna did the same thing back. (It was technically against the rules to dare someone who had already had their turn - but with Pansy in charge, no one was going to question it.)
Harry watched Malfoy eye the grass around them. It was slightly wet from the rain earlier in the morning but nothing to make a fuss about. He let out an exasperated sign and looked back up to Harry, gesturing wildly with his arms. “Why are you standing there?”
Draco woke up in darkness, his surroundings taking some time to make sense. He had fallen asleep. He wasn’t supposed to have fallen asleep. Shit. He went to get up - he had to check the time -  and only then did he notice the arms wrapped around him, weighing him down.
Draco smiled in that way he often did when he thought Harry wasn’t looking. Except there was no mistaking Harry’s gaze.
He let Potter release the snitch, and followed him up into the air, not failing to notice that he kicked off the ground half a second later than Potter. Whatever. He fixed his mind on winning.
Come sunrise the next morning, Hermione’s waiting at the base of the Whomping Willow when Harry surfaces.
“No need, Potter,” he says again, and his hand lingers for another beat before he turns back. Now, he approaches the bed, his long fingers trailing the edge of a bed post. “Were you looking for a repeat performance?” he asks, back to Harry.
“It’s not so much the restaurant itself,” Potter continues when Draco doesn’t reply – Zabini told him flat out yesterday he was horrible conversationalist and worse listener. “It’s just that it’s right beside the auror apparition point so I walk past it every day. After we try the food today, you never know, I might come here every night, or never again I suppose. I guess there’s a lot of weight on what I order. What do you think you’ll order?”
Harry hears the sound he makes with a sharp intake of his breath at Malfoy’s suggestion. His hand pauses on Malfoy’s shoulder, frozen. They stand like that for the longest moment of Harry’s life until Malfoy breaks the silence.
Draco waited impatiently, scanning Potter’s face for any tell of how he might choose. Potter was still staring back - not giving away anything. Until he raised an eyebrow - as if asking Draco:
Draco realises Potter is speaking to him. He tunes in to catch an update of Potter’s day. Training. Training. Dark spells. Training. It’s fascinating once he starts to really listen. Potter is learning about magic Draco wasn’t even aware existed.
The Malfoy by Harry sighs and turns to the intruders, wand raised to them, but keeping the knife in place. “I just asked for one day in peace. One fucking day to work out how to fucking kill you. Is that so fucking hard?”
Malfoy broke the silence as they waited for the final moving staircase down to the ground floor to swing into position. “You have mild hay fever and you’re allergic to shellfish.”
Harry shrugs. He is glad at least that Hermione shares his frustration in not knowing, but he wishes more that she would have the answer.
Draco panicked. Denial hadn’t worked. Neither had any of his excuses. And now Potter was directly asking him a question he could not answer. So he yanked the jersey up, cringing when it caught around his head and he had to squirm it the rest of the way off. He tossed it behind Potter and then answered the question honestly. “I’m not wearing it.”
, so as not to anger his woozy brain and lead it to further dizziness. Potter’s mouth is moving but the words themselves remain unfocused, so Draco makes up his own.
The proud son of a bitch. Despite Malfoy’s claim, Harry is quite certain after a kiss like that, an apology will be forth-coming. He just has to make Malfoy want it enough.
Potter rolled his eyes and pulled out his wand. Draco reflexively took a step back. But Potter only tapped his glasses, transfiguring them into narrow rectangular frames, far more stylish than the big round spectacles he usually wore - although somehow far less flattering. “How about now?” He asked.
“Malfoy,” Potter said, clearly not having thrown away the key to his lips at all. “Are you making me wait on purpose?”
“We didn’t have sex,” Pansy said with obvious disappointment. “I just offered because she spilt crab cake on this one and she was practically sobbing about how much she needed to impress her new boss. It seemed like the right thing to do.” She looked down at herself and rubbed at a small stain running along the centre bodice. “But that’s before I was reminded how bad I look in peach.”
Harry looks between Zabini’s smirk and Malfoy’s apologetic frown. His insides are squirming uncomfortably. He knows he has no claim over Malfoy at all. But it still feels like a betrayal. Last night he was tossing and turning, all the while Malfoy enjoyed the comforts of someone else. It hurts.
Malfoy’s face is so sincere, Harry wants to believe it. He wants to trust Malfoy. Before he can make up his mind, a familiar feeling in his pocket interrupts his thoughts. The Homenum Revelio charm must still be working.
Draco shuffled up higher on the bed while Potter watched him, still standing by the side. Potter’s eyes were dark and lidded - it made Draco feel dirty just to be looked at like that. Feeling a bit brazen under that very look, Draco let his legs fall open to give Potter the best possible view of his cock. He hoped it might encourage Potter to get a move on and join Draco in bed.
“Nothing,” Harry answered Malfoy. Which was basically the truth after all – Malfoy had been the one holding Harry down and pushing
Draco’s hand springs up automatically. Unable to see Potter or the phone, he blindly flails his hand until he hears the phone drop from Potter’s hand and clatter to the floor. “No hospital.” He manages to say before he loses consciousness again.
Draco stiffens. Yes, he knows what he looks like. He’d rather not but it’s not as if he has a choice in the matter. Mirrors are often difficult to avoid. He’s not surprised that Potter finds him as disgusting as he finds himself.
Instead of leaving Draco’s office, Potter dropped back into the patient’s chair, leaning back with an infuriating pout. “What about if I’m
Potter continued to stare up at the canopy, even though he must have been able to see Draco staring in his direction.
Harry’s brain short-circuited. He must have stood there blinking at Malfoy for a solid five seconds before he was able to ask: “All of them?”
is Hagrid,” interrupted Potter in the cold, serious voice he reserved for showing off what a flawless, noble prick he was.
,” Draco interrupts again, knocking past Harry violently. He strides down the corridor alone heading to the entrance. Harry considers following him.
Draco tries to concentrate on the Doctor talking to him but there’s something distracting him. Something he feels like he’s missing. Something he should be doing right now. He checks the time. Just after 7pm. Dinner. He’s missing dinner. And it feels strange.
He watched through his peripheral vision as Malfoy practically sprinted up the stairs to his dormitory. He couldn’t help but think that he’d stumbled across a rather marvellous discovery today.
Unfortunately, Potter didn’t seem phased. “I’m not begging,” he said simply, leaning back into his chair and spreading his legs the tiniest fraction.
“This doesn’t feel like the past,” Draco said as his eyes followed his younger self leave the memory, supported by Snape.
Friday had already been a particularly stressful day for him. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement was under scrutiny for a number of unsolved cases and all the aurors were working overtime. Harry hadn’t even realised the time until Draco and Teddy turned up at his office.
Hermione casts a quick spell and a cage surrounds Malfoy. She gives Ron a stern look. “I’ll be fine, Ronald. Just be quick.”
Straight up to his dormitory, Harry tears through his trunk for the map, not concerned about the mess he is making as he goes. At last his hands grip an old piece of thick parchment. “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
Harry knew immediately whose hair it was. He had stared at that slicked back platinum blonde hair too many times to not recognise it. Only problem was, it was on his head, not Malfoy’s.
But now, he watches Draco on the map constantly, tracks where he goes, like sixth year all over again. But it’s different this time, he won’t hurt Draco again. After what he’s seen, he could never.
Potter didn’t even glance at it. “Now that you’ve shown me your tactics and the way you fly, I’m pretty confident I can -“
Of course Draco noticed that and swiveled back around. Teddy quickly changed his face to an innocent smile but he was too late. Draco had caught him.
Last night in the dark dim lights of the pub, he could hardly focus on Pansy’s face, but he hid it as best as he could. Pansy would properly attribute it to “sickness” and wheel him into the hospital herself. But what does she know? After being forced to eat that burger last night, Draco had felt sicker than he could recall in some time. His whole body repelled it. Every cell. Clearly, Pansy is the one who doesn’t know what she’s talking about.
to help. It’s almost selfish of him. He needs to help Draco to make himself feel better about the damage he has inflicted. But at the same time, anything he can do to minimise Draco’s pain, he will.
Harry’s jaw tightens at the word. Draco makes it sound like a bad thing. A terrible burden. “So what if they are?”
, it’s not finished. He has no idea what the effects will be. It could be dangerous. So, out of obligation, he asks:
Malfoy and Harry are supposed to hate each other. They’re arch-enemies for Merlin’s sake. If they don’t hate each other, then what do they have?
