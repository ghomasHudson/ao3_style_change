As he walks around the edge of the roomhe spots his parents and he turns swiftly hoping they wouldn't notice him. He could hide in the kitchens and  hope they won't  find him. There would also be the added benefit that he could at the very least enjoy some food without worrying about what girl among the crowd might be his future wife.
"It's charmed to only be accessible by broom if you're magic." She says and they look at her confused "If you're magic? Do you mean they let in muggles?" Draco asked, utterly shocked by this news. She rolls her eyes at their incredulous expressions "Only muggles who already know about the magical world like family of muggleborns."
He tells his mother about how he saved the muggleborn girl, how they put in the paper that they said he was imperiused. He wrote that he would double his efforts to fix their legacy, he would do everything she said, he would smile at muggleborns and be as friendly as he could possibly be.
"If it makes it any better, they were probably aiming for me." Draco says leaning back in his seat. "You're a slytherin, but you didn't directly aid the dark lord." He says looking over at the books along the shelf.
"You know, when I met you I knew, even behind all of the sneers and the haughty attitude I could tell it wasn't really you." Blaise says their footsteps falling in sync.
"You would undoubtedly die a horrible death, you couldn't possibly charm your way out of an entire angry mob" Draco retorted, hoping the challenge might shift the topic away from him, or at least away from the party.
"Mate! Calm down!" Crabbe yells swooping over to Draco nearly missing a pin as it flies over his head. "Draco!" Crabbe yells but Draco refuses to look up as he tears out the pins halfway up his trousers. He's crying and it's too hard to see the pins anymore. They prick his fingers drawing blood but he can't bring himself to care. He doesn't even realize when Blaise grabs the front of his broom guiding him down to an empty field. Not until he feels the rough grass around him. He breathes in big sobbing breaths and his hands clench around fistfuls of grass and he rips them out of the ground cursing.
"Seriously, have you ever met Hermione?" Ron retorts laughing slightly which doesn't help Harry's mood. Even Draco who has had very few interactions with her knows she is brilliant but extremely stubborn. Ron looks over and seems to have just noticed him there and shoots him a glare which Draco returns. He huffs and quickly turns back to his potion, not wanting to get involved but still being too curious to leave.
Harry stops to check the map and Draco peers over his shoulder confused when he sees the names of people milling about but Harry stows it away before he can get a proper look. They walk quickly through the now empty corridors and Draco can't help but notice his palms have grown sweaty and his heart refuses to slow down. With every single breath he can smell Harry's shampoo. He wants to be angry, he should be. That's the person he was told to be. But Harry came to save him even after they fought. He'd always thought Harry's gallantry was idiotic, but being on the recieving end it feels different.
"You know pureblood rules." She says shaking her head. "You can't be with him." And something in her voice makes him look up. A certain yearning that makes him feel a little less alone. But just as quickly as it appeared does it disappear. They look at one another for a moment and Draco tries to figure out if he had truly heard what he'd heard. "Who is it?" He asks but herexpression has turned stoney. "You know your place and I know mine." She says sternly.
"No I-" He started but was promptly cut off by the opening of doors. Immediately Draco's back straightened in his chair, hoping that it wasn't his parents. But to his relief it was only one of the servants and so he slumped back in his chair.
"I'd rather die again than have to deal with that hag for a whole year!" He yells chucking his books onto his bed. Draco watches as he has started grabbing his spare cloaks, gathering them all up in his arms. Ron holds out a hand to Harry to stop him and says "I'd normally be all for this but-"
She doesn't seem to have any visible injuries. He touches her throat and it takes him a moment to find her pulse but when he does he turns to Pansy and says "Go find Madam Pomfrey!" and there is a pause in which Pansy doesn't move.
He still has some time before the great hall opens for breakfast. He stretches then begins to quietly prep his potions kit to make a sleeping potion for tomorrow night. After a minute he decides to start a healing potion as well. They're both quite simple but the challenge of making two would help keep him from falling asleep while brewing. Not to mention a healing potion would be a perfect gift for Pansy.
"How do you know about Potter's party?" Blaise asks surprised and Pansy only grins wider. Though from across the stable scrambling and cursing can be heard as Crabbe and Goyle shove things into the carraige. "What are you doing out here?" Crabbe says nervously approaching them as Goyle slams a bag into the back of the carriage. "I invited her." Draco says and after a moment of conflict they both seem to decide that time is more important at the moment. "Fuck, fine. Just get in." Crabbe says waving them inside.
She goes back to flip through clothes and he sighs looking with her. "What about this?" He asks pulling out a black piece of clothing he doesn't quite understand how to wear but he's already tired of shopping. "You want to wear that?" She asks seeming surprised "It would show your knees! The scandal!" She says laughing. He looks at the fabric confused. She shakes her head "It's a skirt, it's kimd of like the bottom part of a dress." She says laughing once more
When he woke up the next morning Harry was gone. The little vial was still there but there's no point in taking it back now. He took his own potion that his mother had gotten for him as he gets ready. It tastes a bit chalky though not awfully so. When he got to breakfast it felt like he was being ignored, even though he and Harry had never been on speaking terms. He couldn't even catch his eye. It wouldn't bother him so much if Harry hadn't refused his apology, not once but twice. Granted he never heard the first of the two but Draco felt as though it should count.
"What about you? How'd it go with Potter?" Blaise questions as Crabbe rubs the back of his head. Draco shrugs, he'd truthfully expected to end the night in a duel. "It was surprisingly uneventful other than a single hex." He says "From him, or you?"Blaise asks with a sly grin.
It takes several rewrites to leech out every ounce of desperation, the near pleading of his words for her validation. He would hate for her to see him waver. Its just that he doesn't entirely know who he is or what he is supposed to do. But he knows he loves his family, that they sacrificed everything for him. Surely he just needs her reassurance then all of his worries will go away.
"I think we'll be able to make it before it's too dark" Goyle says glancing out the window. "We would have time to shrink all of our trunks and rent a few brooms, maybe even find someone with a portkey-" but Pansy shakes her head.
It only takes a glimpse over the rack of clothes to recognize the men. They tower over the muggle shopkeeper and Draco gasps sharply tugging at Pansy's arm. When she spots them she curses under her breath and the both of them crouch down to hide. "How did they find us?" Draco hisses but Pansy shakes her head. "We can worry about that later, right now we've got to get out of here." She whispers and the two of them rush off to find the others.
Her smile only dims for a moment but instead of being directed at him it is at the anxious boy next to him. "Are you feeling alright dear?" She asks and he shakes his head quickly "I'm fine!" He squeaks, looking nervously over at Draco. His hand holding a brush has started to quiver slightly. There is the scrape of a chair from the back of the room and before Draco can decide what to do Harry is next to them.
Now that he's aware of it he can't stop thinking about it. Each time Harry turns or speeds up even slightly he can see where whatever it is that he's using to keep them concealed drag up and reveal their feet. He has to keep scurrying forward because the idea of getting caught is nearly as bad as the thought of centaurs capturing him.
He has never been the son that his parents wanted him to be. He wasn't the soldier the dark lord wanted him to be. He isn't the person the wizarding world wants him to be. So if he fails at everything, then what is the point in trying? An overwhelming sadness hits him and with it, a burning rage. His hands shake and his stomach twists violently. "Don't pretend like you know me." He says through gritted teeth as he stands, pulling his wand on Harry who promptly pulls his own. Anger burns through him and he can feel it everywhere at once. "You've got no idea what it was like! You've got no idea the kind of pressure-" He starts but Harry's face darkens as he cuts him off.
It's a long letter which shows just how lonely she is at home. Nearly three pages of almost nothing but complaining about the house elves and questions about school. However she does say near the end. "I know for a long time your father and I told you not to smile. I don't want you to worry so much about your dimples showing through. I found a stronger potion for you that will last longer." This is followed by several lines complaining about the house elf who took so long to get it. Then she ends the letter by saying "I want you to smile more, particularly with our enemies. Let them see that the war ending has not phased you. The mudbloods want to see you miserable and I simply won't allow it. You want them on your side so you should distance yourself from your friends for the time being. Instead smile at mudbloods, smile at blood traitors, smile so much that your cheeks begin to hurt. Because you my love are the shining future of the pureblood legacy." He opens the box to reveal two pearly potions tucked inside. It's unclear to him whether to feel happy or be crushed under the weight of his mother's expectations. The idea of her encouraging him to smile feels ridiculous but his mother's name is at the bottom of the letter in her swooping signature.
However he doesn't have to wonder for too long because the morning after he got that letter Mcgonagall walked up to the podium in the great hall and said in a strained voice which sounds so different than her normally authoritative tone. "I have some difficult news to share. As of today, I will no longer be your headmistress."
As soon as the sun starts to rise and the shops along diagon alley begin opening each of them roll out of bed. They griped every step of the way complaining about every minor inconvenience but upon arriving at the shops they split up in different directions. Blaise went to get shrinking trunks, Crabbe and Goyle split up on the hunt for food while Draco went for brooms and Pansy headed to get them all different clothes. They were supposed to meet up with Pansy as soon as they were finished to be properly fitted.
The Hogwarts Journal which hardly anyone had even read until this morning was all anyone could talk about. Were it any other year Draco would have basked in the attention. But this year all he wants is to get through school with grades good enough to get him an alchemy internship. No unnecessary attention, no drama, no death, just good grades and a future with a stable income. But of course that isn't what he's going to get.
As they walk he spots Harry in the hallway and the forgiveness that he desired has vanished. Harry absolutely knows the article in the prophet is entirely lies. Forgiveness can wait for another day. He speeds up nearly dragging Pansy with him.
"I've gone the last several years but I couldn't manage to sneak away this year." She smiles looking out the window "My fiance will be there" She says with the biggest goofiest grin. Though after a moment she seems to snap out of it. "I won't bore you with the details" She says seeming to draw back slightly. "There's an inn off of diagon alley that would be a good place to rest and we could buy different robes."
"You didn't notice the servants scurrying about? You must be dim." Blaise teased and after a moment of Draco staring at him blankly he laughed. "You really didn't notice?" But now that Draco thought about it the servants and house elves had been rushing about more so than usual the last few days. They'd even let him sleep in, which he'd thought was just a stroke of luck. He leaned in his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "What do you think they're planning?" And he looked at them expectantly hoping that they might just take the bait. He is curious after all, and distracting them was just an added bonus.
In truth he did very little during the war. At the time he felt that he should have been doing more. But every assignment he was given, he failed. He never went through with killing Dumbledore and his biggest contribution was sneaking a few people onto the hogwarts grounds. If anything, his involvement had been a detriment, by dragging his feet in killing Dumbledore it allowed him time to search for horocruxes. He rubs his eyes and sighs heavily as the moment of his death flashed in his mind.
"But it's so short!" He says surprised. "You're going to be in for a real shock when you see what some of the people at the party will be wearing." She scoffs. "Is it really as great as you've made it seem?" He asks and she smiles "It is without a doubt my second favorite place in the entire world."
"If we keep this pace we'll make it to the party before dusk and-" Pansy starts but Draco quickly cuts in. "BY DUSK?" He yells looking around at the others "I'M NOT WEARING THIS THING TIL DUSK!"
"Saving you, you ungrateful little git" Harry spits holding his stomach as he straightens himself. "I think I'll leave you here instead"
He can't help but think of his own friends, two of whom would soon be leaving. At least with them still at school he can delude himself into thinking he might be able to fix things after his mother's plan plays out. He hears a tap at the window and Neville opens it only to be greeted by Draco's owl. He assumes Harry tells him so much because Neville glances to Draco then goes back to his place among the pillows on Harry's bed.
"Is it so obvious?" She sighs tugging at the sleeves of her dress the lace on one side snagging against her ring which makes her curse under her breath.
Upon looking over the shirt he decides the color isn't horribly offensive to the eye. It is a soft pink button up shirt. He tries not to look too closely at the stitching or the lessons his mother had given him on the importance of cloak stitching will return to him. Instead he drapes it over his arm and walks along the aisle. Eventually he finds another shirt which he doesn't absolutely and brings it to Pansy who nods and says "I'm not opposed to it" instead of approving.
She seems so calm but perhaps she knew longer than him, or perhaps she is genuinely pleased. Though it is a wonder to think she could possibly be pleased to be wed to him. More likely is that she is playing a role for the sake of her family. Money and power are always the motivators when it comes to the actions of royalty. It is sad to think she could be motivated by anything else.
"I'm not a war criminal, dumbass!" She says sitting up to smack the back of his head. "I'm a war accomplice at most!"
"During one of your family's parties I'd climbed your garden wall and I saw you rummaging around in the bushes asking the fairies if they'd seen a frog." He says laughing and it makes Draco smile.
"DO I GET A SAY IN THIS?" He yells this time, and he does in fact slam his hands on top of his father's desk but neither his mother nor father flinch. They are looking at him silently and it feels as though they have become statues again. These aren't his parents, they wouldn't marry him off to a girl he's never met. He knew he would end up in an arranged marriage, but he is too young to marry, and courting takes time. His stomach does a flip when he sees no remorse from his parents. Their faces are vacant and he is so filled with anger and adrenaline that being met with their stony expressions only fuels him further.
"I'm...betrothed?" He repeated sounding bewildered even to himself and his mother nods to him. "To who?" He asks, his voice rising quickly into hysterics.
As they fly over the city Draco can't help but notice the tiny pins poking him every single time he moves. But if they have to land for him to change they'll lose valuable time. "Pretty sure I'm being stabbed by five pins at once" Draco groans trying to get comfortable on his broom. Crabbe looks over and bursts into laughter only now realizing Draco was still in an unfinished suit. "Be stabbed, be naked, or be caught!" He says laughing and Blaise turns around with a grin. "Add a few drinks and it sounds like one hell of a night!" And they all laugh.
"And the first?" He asks and she is silent for a moment purposefully not looking at him. "The lover I mentioned..with...with her" It takes a moment for Draco to process this. Same sex couples in the wizarding world are nearly unheard of. And those who are open about it are severely ostracized. "Her?" He asks unsure if he heard correctly.
He often found himself holding his wand in the same way in when the dark lord was living in the manor. Every noise in the night made him jump and even after he was defeated it still plagued him at times. Draco had to wonder if he was the reason Harry was doing this. He decidedly left the potion just in case he'd take it and went back to bed.
"That was my mother's idea, I was just as surprised as anyone else" Draco says trying to look at Harry's face instead of his chest. "Oh of course!" Harry says sarcastically "You're never to blame, are you?"
There is an uproar from the students but Draco can only feel relief that his mother's plan doesn't involve murder. He turns intending to share this with one of his friends but he deflates when he sees sitting beside him instead a second year he hasn't spoken to more than once. He feels a pang of regret in ignoring his friends, but if he were to try to talk to them now then they'll want an explanation that he doesn't have. Mcgonagall waits until the student body quiets, her eyes scanning over the crowd. Draco isn't sure if her eyes linger on him for a split second longer than anyone else or if he is just imagining it. There are still murmurs but she speaks above them. "Due to the number and severity of injuries on hogwarts grounds I have been forced to step down from my post. The ministry has sent a replacement and I hope that all of you will take this news in stride." The last portion has to be spoken loudly to be heard over the students.
He gasps softly when he sees her. Her skin is pale and her cheeks are sunken. Her health seems to be rapidly deteriorating and her breathing is uneven and ragged. "She's dying." He says and it feels as though there is a weight on his chest. She reminds him far too eerily of the corpses that had been strewn around hogwarts during that final battle. He can feel the headmistress' gaze on him, he can feel her calculating his every move. It is unsurprising that he is still a suspect in her mind.
"Potter" He says by way of greeting and it sounds harsher than he'd intended. He is met with a scowl and a disdainful "Malfoy" spat back at him. There is a moment is silence and it feels as though his wand is burning a hole in his pocket. "I'm unarmed, if you intend to hex me then get it over with, golden boy." He says trying to keep him tone flat though there is the hint of a snarl that he can't quite rid himself of.
He quite desperately needs silence but the idea of being alone with himself sounds like a horrifying prospect. Even his friends would force him to talk about what happened with the headmistress. And if he let slop that Harry was even remotely angry with him they would want every detail.
"You should really be getting your rest after that fall I think-" Blaise starts but he stops at the sight of Pansy tipping back her glass of firewhiskey. He smirks, watching her and she promptly kicks off her heels. "There's no time to waste!" She says with mischief in her eyes as she grabs up the hem of her dress and pushes her way into the hall. Blaise looks at Draco as if he's mad though he seems taken with her brashness. "You intend to bring her?" He asks of Draco and he nods hurrying back out to the hall not wanting to argue about it.
"Yes, of course I do" He says, genuinely troubled and when he reaches out to touch her arm she glances over at him and sighs. "How am I supposed to be mad at you when you look like a wounded puppy?" She grumbles pulling her arm away. "Whatever. I told you, so whether you're going to say goodbye to them is your choice." Then she turns and storms off. He sighs trying not to feel guilty but failing miserably. It isn't until he pushes open his door that he remembers why he was wary to go back to his dorm.
As a group they would always gather at Malfoy manor, as it was the largest of all of their homes and there were never any siblings around to pester them. There weren't nearly as many listening ears and mouths willing to snitch on them and their exploits. Though there were servants, but they could always be bribed. It's not as if Draco had anything more than a handful of passing flings and drunken nights to be exploited as it is. But it is best to have any rumors contained, especially when his friends are often such scoundrels. They are pureblood aristocracy too after all, and it would be tragic to tarnish their reputations.
"It was thunder!" He yells scrambling to the furthest corner of the room. "It was only thunder!" He says again holding out his wand toward Harry ready to cast a bind on him if necessary. He is already worried simply disarming him would get him a detention at the very least. But thankfully Harry stops still looking dazed and he says "Thunder?" taking a moment to look around the room. He stands up straight and sighs heavily seeming to come out of the fog of sleep. "I'll have my wand back." He says holding out his hand and after a moment of hesitation and a scowl from Harry Draco hands back the wand.
Draco can't help but laugh at her lack of decorum. It's no wonder she has a big dowry, to most suitors this would be horrendous behavior but to him it feels the most genuine anyone has been with him in ages. He doesn't wish to marry her but her company seems tolerable. She closes her eyes and sighs turning her face up to the moon for a moment she whispers something too quiet for him to hear. Though he has a feeling it isn't meant for him in the first place. "I would introduce myself but I'm sure your parents told you my name already" She says stretching her bare feet out in front of her.
From experience he knows that if he goes after her she'll be angry with him no matter what he says. It's better to let her cool down then give her chocolates as an apology. Draco sighs running an hand through his hair feeling guilty. It's not as if he doesn't feel for her, they're going through the same thing right now. But eventually people will remember that not all slytherins were helping the dark lord. But his family was, and that will follow him for the rest of his life.
"I uhh, I had a lot more...traditional beliefs" Draco says wanting to get up and leave but not knowing how without seeming incredibly rude.
The next morning it nearly takes everyone to drag Draco out of bed. Normally the servants wouldn't wake him before noon, any earlier would take tremendous effort and often bribery with sweets. He neither wants to get up nor go shopping for muggle clothes. But with lots of grumbling he puts on one of the cloaks he had packed and trudges behind his friends as they walk through the town. It's a quaint place with brick buildings and murals on the sides of storefronts.
Before he's realized who he's looking for his eyes fall on Harry. He and his friends seem to be crushed between people clamoring to get closer. Everyone wants a moment with the savior. For a moment there is a stab of jealousy in him but he pushes it aside. He'd always hated the story of the boy who lived. His family always had their own telling, though it was likely just as accurate as the glorified one that had been spread around.
Draco shoves his trunk into his pocket then climbs onto his broom. "Fucking idiot" He hears from the hall as he climbs onto the windowsill. "Alohomora" Says the man and Draco flings himself out of the window, his broom plummeting several feet in his panic. He quickly rights himself and shoots upwards hoping the men won't see him. His heart hammers in his chest as he rises up to the height at which his friends hover.
They sit in a comfortable silence and eventually Draco falls asleep. He doesn't know when Pansy leaves but it's still dark when he wakes up. The sun is just starting to rise over the horizon as he get up. He can see Harry sleeping on the other side of the room. He quietly sneaks around the room getting ready in the hopes that Harry won't wake up. He's already got to deal with whatever will come from the witch they'd found next, he can't really deal with being hexed and possibly expelled in the same day. He grabs things and rushes out of the room not wanting to be around Harry any more than necessary. He is already trying to suppress whatever feelings he has for him though it is harder now that he is aware of them. Though he can't quite sort out what exactly he wants from Harry. The conflicting nature of their rivalry with this new found attraction is strange. It is easier to be angry with him than confront his own thoughts and feelings. He has buried his emotions so many times that it feels second nature.
This is an all consuming question. He can't so much as glance in Harry's direction without feeling his face heat up. To his overwhelming embarrassment he catches the eyes of a muggleborn girl staring at him. He instinctually wants to cover his cheeks but instead he lies his head down on his resk hiding his face. His stomach churns and he wants to scream but he can still hear the piano and the picture of Harry playing won't leave his mind. It bothers him, he shouldn't be feeling anything but hatred for Harry. They're enemies, they always have been. But for some reason Harry won't leave his head. As soon as class is done he bolts for the door, needing to be as far away from Harry as possible.
Pomfrey grumbles under her breath angrily as she continues her treatment of the boy. "Would she really..." Draco starts to ask but then trails off knowing that her threats aren't empty. "She would" Pomfrey huffs "I have cared for the children of this school for years and this-" her words devolve into more grumblings.
He lays there for a moment longer before he rolls out of bed and goes to fill a bottle with water. He has always found the gardening portion of potion making to be calming. In the process of making a potion one false move and the whole thing could go sour. But plants are forgiving, if you don't water them then they may wilt but if you give them love then they will flourish. The stream of water stops suddenly as he looks down at one of the many wilted plants and his heart aches. Maybe with some love and water he can grow strong as well. He carefully waters each of them then grabs a paper ink and quill.
"Draco, it's okay. You're far away from home, you don't have to be perfect." Goyle says sitting next to him in the grass. He tries to take control of his breaths and he scrubs his palms against his eyes. "Sorry" He says quietly feeling ashamed of himself. "Don't be. Come on, we'll go find an inn and make the rest of the trip in the morning." Crabbe says pulling Draco to his feet. He nods quietly refusing to look anyone in the eye as he crosses his arms over his bare chest.
Curses are easy to understand, they all have patterns and logical solutions. It's humans that are complicated. If people were like curses or potions with a list of rules where every action has an expected reaction life would be so much simpler. Three tablespoons of dried magarth and he could fix the perception people had of him. Or a pinch of jorlin and he could figure out why Harry makes him so jumpy and nervous. But it's not rhat simple.
"To whom." His mother corrects out of habit but she seems to realize now is not the time for a lesson and sighs. "Pansy Parkinson, she is a lovely girl." She said in a reassuring tone, though it was not reassuring in the slightest.
He practices his smile as he puts on his suit, though it feels like shackles. Once its all on he looks at himself in the mirror. He is handsome, but it doesn't feel right. He tugs at the sleeves wishing he could leave right this minute. But he sighs and puts on his favorite cufflinks preparing himself to feign happiness. There's no way he could do this for the rest of his life. He would be miserable, and if he's being honest with himself, he was always miserable.
There seems to be an endless array of clothing. Pansy turns to address them as if they are her troops. "Listen up! Crabbe I need you to take the shirts, Goyle you take the trousers, Blaise you look through the accessories. If you find anything that looks decent then bring it to me." She says pointing them to their respective aisles. "The faster we finish, the faster we get to the party!" She turns for a moment then quickly turns back "If anybody brings me cargo shorts or a polo I will genuinely hex you"
He whips around to see Potter looking dazed and frantic. Without giving him time to cast another spell Draco raises his wand and quickly says "Expelliarmus!" And Harry's wand comes flying in his direction. Harry charges forward but Draco manages to snatch it from the ground.
He and Pansy wander down the halls unsure where to go with his dorm full of annoying do gooders and her dorm occupied by a hostile witch. However, even the halls seem to be filled with people that openly hate them. During the war at the very least they could delude themselves into thinking that people simply disliked them. But fear and respect aren't the same thing, losing the war has made this abundantly clear.
He manages to grab her though he stumbles back and she promptly lets her body go limp. He hesitates but after repositioning her in his arms he rushes toward the open doors. She's hesvier than he would have thought and by the time he crashes through the doors he doesn't have to pretend to be winded "Lady Parkinson has fainted!" He says satisfied with the panic in his tone and the flurry of motion at their arrival. There are suddenly worried eyes turned toward them. His mother comes rushing forward "What happened? Oh poor dear!" She says waving over a house elf. "She fell into the fountain and-" but before he can finish Pansy is being lifted by magic from his arms. He can see her stiffen slightly but only for the fact that he knows she hasn't truly fainted.
He has buried every grain of kindness in himself so deeply that even a simple statement like this feels as though he has exposed himself. Seeing Harry's face has only made him embarrassed, wondering whether he should have said something biting instead. He quickly takes a seat at his desk and his shoulders curl forward wanting to bury himself away again. He tries to go back to stirring but he is far too aware of Harry's footsteps behind him.
"Of course I'm afraid," She says lightlt and she shrugs "But someone taught me that fear can be snuffed out by joy, and love, and hope" She says and her voice seems far off as if she might be talking about a lover.
Draco falls in and out of sleep, even the slightest noise jolting him awake. He's used to sleeping in the silence of the slytherin dorms which are built underground. There is only ever the occasional chatter of merpeople as they pass the windows that look out into the lake. And at home, where the manor is so expansive and shielded by charms, hardly even the wind can get through. As he tosses and turns it feels as though there is noise everywhere, though one that continually worries him is the soft breathing from across the room.
Draco can hear Blaise mutter to Goyle "What the fuck is a cargo short?" To their mutual confusion. But Pansy looks at them pointedly and says "It's ugly, now go!" and they quickly split up to search for clothes.
"If you don't mind I'm going to change and go check on my betrothed" He says tersely before turning away from her. He expects her to tell him off or nag him relentlessly but there is only silence from her. Sometimes he is reminded that this may not have been the life she had envisioned fir herself. And this is one of those times. When he reaches the stairs he looks back to see her staring down the hall after Pansy.
Draco stands awkwardly looking at a horrendous  shirt with brightly colored fruit.  "What am I supposed to do?" He asks scowling at the offensive fabric.
"Why did you-" Draco starts but Harry cuts him off with a shush. The hand on his hip feels as though it's burning into him. There are several more moments of silence before Draco pushes his hand away.
"I'm sorry, I didn't address you." She says, her smile never wavering. It's disconcerting and Draco has to wonder if this is how he makes people feel at times. "Five points from ravenclaw for each of you." She says shooing them away from the bed and she then turns to Draco as the group of ravenclaws leave, several of them still looking back toward their friend.
He's managed to make it most of the way through the day without running into any of them. He has one final class then he'll have to figure out how to avoid Harry even though they share a room. As his class is a muggle subject he's not looking forward to it very much. It always seems that they speak in a forgein language. The teacher will at times say utter nonsense and nobody else seems at all bothered. It feels like some sort of elaborate prank.
Crabbe and Goyle are both dukes with important family ties and money to spare. They're somehow loosely related to the Malfoys though neither side could quite tell you how. They've got the same sharp nose on them and have got to be at least distant cousins. Blaise is a first born although not a sole heir, he has five siblings as well as six half siblings. His father has mistresses to spare and Blaise takes after him in this regard. He could charm the clothes off of nearly anyone and he uses it to his advantage at every turn. It only makes it worse that he is atrociously handsome. He has said time and time again that if he is ever cut off, which is very likely considering how shameless he is, that he will simply find someone willing to pay for his lavish lifestyle in exchange for a good fuck. It's hard to tell whether or not he is joking or not.
Upon opening the doors he can see his father standing behind his chair and his mother was looking prim beside him. It's as if they were statues standing there among the books around them and the window back lit them making them appear almost as shadows. He had seen them do this before but mostly as a precursor to important business transactions. It was meant to intimidate and Draco had to admit that it was in fact intimidating, even more so, as both of them are taller than Draco making them feel as though they are glowering down at him. Immediately he was on edge, surely he hadn't done anything dire enough to be deserving of punishment. "Good afternoon, Mother, Father." He bowed slightly and took a seat, they stayed standing for several moments more and it only made him feel smaller.
"I may be sinful, but I've obviously been blessed by god." Blaise says gesturing to himself then settling his elbows on the table and his chin in his hands to frame his face. He looks wide eyed in faux innocence at Draco and he nearly laughed, as Blaise is the least innocent of any one of them.
"No! You look nice when you smile!" Harry protests which only makes Draco's face heat up. He looks away embarrassed but Harry says "I'm not done! Just give me two more seconds of smiling" He says but Draco shakes his head his face returning to his normal impassive expression. Harry huffs but continues to draw.
To think his mother would do something so drastic without so much as informing him is unsurprising. He's never been kept in the loop when it comes to his parents plans. He hardly even knows how they make their money much less what they plan for his own life. You would think he would get some say in it but that has never been the case.
He accidentally drops the brooms several times on his way to the cloak shop and it feels like every eye on diagon alley is turned toward him. Thankfully there aren't many people, but it doesn't make him any less anxious each time one clatters to the ground. Being noticed is the last thing he wants right now. He's thankful though when he finally makes it into the cloak shop and he can see everyone but Pansy already dressed. He drops the brooms next to them with a sigh. "Next time I get snacks" He says snatching a cookie from Crabbe who tries to grab it back but Draco quickly moves to the back of the shop.
"What is your purpose on our land?" One of them bellows, his voice low and commanding. Draco scrambles to his feer and he looks around at the group of a dozen centaurs hoping for a sympathetic face among them. But surely they must know who he is.
There were several snide comments thrown their way. Draco had to grip Pansy's arm to keep her from replying. But when a hex whizzed between them they quickly decided to take refuge in the library. Just a few halls away they slip between the shelves to find a table hidden away from the rest. They sit heavily on the chairs, already feeling tired. "That's the second hex today" Pansy huffs dropping her head in her hands. "I don't know if I'll survive to the end of term."
As she frees her hand he shakes his head "The miserable recognize the miserable, I'm sure you noticed my own lack of enthusiasm." He says unsure whether she will find it funny or take offense but she scoffs shaking her head.
"I'm absolutely terrified. But I've gotta start making decisions for my own life at some point." They talk amongst themselves about the future but Draco can't seem to bring himself to speak. If he let himself choose his life then what would it look like?
They smile politely at one another though they both know it's only a facade. Draco extends his hand to her under the watchful eye of his father. "Would you care to dance?" He asks with a bow and lightly she places her hand in his "That would be splendid, thank you" She chirps and it would have almost been convincing if he didn't know she was just as trapped by this arrangement as he is.
Harry glances up from his papers not even acknowledging the piercing glare from Draco. "Ginny, Luna" he says holding up a notebook. "Gimme a hand?" He asks and Ginny sends Draco a scathing look before she gathers up her papers and crams herself onto the bed next to Harry. Luna on the other hand looks at him for a moment then says "You really should do something about all of those frimbles" She says in her dreamy voice before she moves from his bed.
But the group has seemingly made up their minds already. They start to close in on him and he knows if he's going to escape that this is his only chance.
His things had long since been packed and Crabbe had come to hide them in the stables. It still doesn't feel quite real and perhaps it won't until he has left. But he puts aside his thoughts of escape and marraige to keep himself from trudging his way downstairs. He is careful of his posture not wanting to give any reason for attention to be drawn by his parents. He can hear music playing softly in the ballroom and its hard not to roll his eyes at the familiar tune. It's played at every single ball they've  had since he was a child. He knows every step, every turn, every breath of the dance that goes along with it and when he enters the ballroom he can see those who have already arrived moving in unison. There is even a young boy practicing in the far corner of the hall and Draco wishes he could warn him. It makes his heart ache knowing that he did the same when he was young. He has always been so eager to please his parents and he has always trusted that they have the best for him at heart. But with the slow familiar ballad he can only imagine it as a song of mourning.
He's struggling to float an ivy up to balance on top of the shelf when the door swings open and he jumps nearly flinging the plant at the door. But instead of an irate Potter he is met with a smug looking Pansy. She managed to catch the plant with her own floating charm just before it hit her and Draco huffs and pulls it from her charm shoving it onto the shelf. "Somebody is a little jumpy!" She laughs "I was coming to see if you and Potter have killed one another yet but I wasn't expecting to be attacked by a plant!" She says with a grin.
"Come on Pansy" Draco groans but she crosses her arms turning up her nose at him. "You're a selfish inconsiderate prat who has no concept of-" She stops when he slides the vial in front of her.
He quickly downs the potion trying not to worry whether or not he'd just been caught. Surely the smile hadn't been big enough to expose him. But either way there's no way of knowing how Harry will take his unintentional jabs. It's not as if he was throwing insults like they would when they were children but it seems they have a fragile and unspoken truce. If he's just broken it then the rest of the year will be hell.
"Yep!" She says with a pop of the p, "It's great isn't it?" She says grinning "I couldn't get them to drop the whole
They each kick off the ground rising as quickly as they can to get out of reach. Draco wobbles on his broom for a moment not having ridden one since he was a child. Spells ate yelled beneath them but luckily they fizzle out before they reach high enough.  "Time to grab our stuff and go!" Crabbe yells over the wind and they all turn in the direction of the inn. As they draw close to the inn they can only hope there isn't anyone waiting to ambush them.
"Rich people can dress down but poor people can't dress up it's as simple as that." Pansy says with a shrug. "We can find you some muggle clothes in the morning." She says to draco as she takes off her cloak and flops down on one of the beds. "Now, each of you gets two questions about muggle things then we're going to sleep." She says watching as Goyle delightedly picks up a pen and clicks it. "What does this thing do?" He asks with a big grin.
So many died and yet he survived, it seems like a waste. He had always simply wanted to protect his family, make them proud and uphold their name. He had been trained to duel nearly as soon as he could flick a wand yet he has never been able to kill. He is too soft to be a Malfoy. Were he not an only child he felt he would have been burned from their family tree the night he couldn't bring himself to kill Dumbledore.
How is he supposed to explain it away? Most people don't  know what it looks like for someone to be under an imperius curse. But Harry certainly does and they'd interacted enough over the years that clearly he was a git of his own free will the entire time. He could tell the truth but why would Harry believe he didn't have a hand in whatever his mother was scheming?
"I think I'd rather be with my hex happy roommate than with you right now." She says crossing her arms over her chest. "That's a lie and you know it." He says in a tone that was meant to be playful but instead came across self righteous. He opens his mouth to correct himself but she is already standing to leave.
Draco is running as fast as his feet will carry him afraid that if he stops his tears will return. That Harry will be behind him with a hex, or the dark lord sneering at him with a threat on his tongue, or even his parents who mean well but have controlled and pressured him from the day he was born. It feels as though he is running away from everything. Or maybe he is just running from himself, and the repressed emotions inside of him. There is an overwhelming shame in him that he'd broken down and cried in front of Harry. The person he'd always considered his enemy is the only person that has seen him cry in years.
"Studying" He says absently trying to wave Harry away. "Homework" He says stretching over to poke Draco in the arm with the end of what Draco has learned is called a pencil. "You can do your portrait next" He says and Draco sighs turning toward Harry "Fine, ten minutes." He says turning toward Harry.
"So you're already in love? I assume your parents don't approve of him?" He asks pulling her away from a rose bush so her dress won't get caught.
"Why on earth would we be kicked out for being too rich? Crabbe laughs but Pansy is entirely serious. "The whole point of the party is that anyone can go and be accepted. If people were allowed to flaunt their family wealth it would automatically create a hierarchy. People are allowed to wear anything from costumes to almost nothing and it's allowed but show up in a well fitted brand name cloak then you'll be turned away at the door." She says and stops in front of one of the doors and she quickly slides the card along a little machine and there is a click. "I doubt you have anything that's worth less than a small house." She says looking back at Draco as she walks inside.
"Oh yes of course I just have a few more questions." He says pushing even more. "Do you know the girl, or did you see any-"
When he was younger he'd found medical text books concealed under the covers of romance novels. He'd thought his mother vapid for much of his life, but the truth of it is that she is gifted on many levels. She would disagree but she rivals Lucius on intellect. If she were born a man she would be the head of her family. She would be a well respected and rich healer. But because she was born a woman she is simply her husband's wife. It's truly a shame to waste such a brilliant mind.
His mind races as he walks through the halls and servants rush around him. There is a  weight in his gut like a rock dragging him down to the bottom of a river. But as he stands in the doorway of the ballroom and watches servants arranging flowers for the meeting of his future wife a fire is lit within him. He never asked for this life, it was simply thrust upon him. He has been careful his whole life and this is what it has gotten him? His heart beats fast like the wings of a bird trapped in a cage. His stomach twists and he suddenly turns from the hall running as fast as his legs will carry him.
As the door closes behind him Draco falls back onto his bed with a sigh. He pulls out his hands twirling it between his fingers. Just having it in his hand makes him feel safer. How he's going to deal with this every day without snapping is unclear but the one thing he does know for sure is that it's going to be a long year.
She shakes her head swallowing a mouthful of food. "My dearest dumb Draco" She says on a sigh. "You didn't even read the whole thing. I told them to put in that you denied their interview, you have complete culpability. Its not
she turns to Draco grabbing swatches of fabric to show him. He's never liked shopping for cloaks. It has always just been his parents dragging him around to stores and him standing agitated as he is poked by pins. He also has a tendency to squirm which doesn't help. He picks out a dark fabric with a subtle design and as scissors and pins fly around him he tries his best not to move. Just as scissors zoom past his ear there is another loud noise at the front of the store and the blades nearly catch his cheek. The shopkeeper looks alarmed now and the pins drop from around him. She quickly moves to look and his curiosity gets the better of him and he quickly follows behind her trying to ignore the scissors trying to follow behind him.
He didn't really want to say that his mother had forced him to attend these classes even though it was the truth. But as he is about to answer a light shines across the room and Draco jumps going for his wand until he realized that the light created a picture of a woman on the board in front of the class. He twists in his seat trying to find the source but he hears Harry laugh and he turns back glaring. The professor starts talking about someone named Leonardo DaVinci, a very muggle name, and Draco slumps in his seat annoyed.
"I thought I was the hero!" Draco screams, his wand pressing into Harry's chest and his voice is shaking with anger and unshed tears. "They told me I would be a hero! That the wizarding world would be safer without mudbloods-"
"Potter and company have been crowding my dorm all day." He says handing off the bottle to Goyle. "I knew Ginny was up to something, she kept whispering with Loony." Pansy says and Draco looks at her surprised "Did you really just call her by her actual name? That's two points from slytherin!" He says and she sighs "She hexes me every single time I call her Weaslette! What am I supposed to do? I'm losing my edge!" She cries slumping down and scowling at the empty bed on the other side of the room.
As he reaches the great hall he takes a deep breath already smelling breakfast being cooked by the house elves. It's silent though and the candles floating high above flicker. So as he waits for the rest of hogwarts to wake he buries his nose in an alchemy book and does his best not to think about Harry Potter.
"Made you a healing potion just in case Weaslette attacks you again." He says and she looks down at it for a moment. "Is it just because I'm mad at you?" She says haughtily, still acting as though she won't take it even though he knows she can't refuse a gift to save her life.
He can hear his friends laughing when he returns but upon seeing his stricken expression they sober. "Has someone died?" Crabbe asks looking at him slightly startled. Draco's expression is far off as he speaks still not truly believing the words as he says them. "I'm....betrothed" Draco says and there are exclamations of indignation from all of them. They speak over one another and Draco sits heavily in his chair feeling both numb and ready to burst in the same moment.
They jog the rest of the way there to catch up. Upon arriving they can immediately tell this town is entirely muggle. It's entirely devoid of a broomsticks propped at doorways, of house elves scurrying around to do chores and the lights in the houses don't have the flicker of flames lighting them from the inside. They look curiously at the little houses as they pass every once in a while seeing the figure of a muggle through a window. Pansy rolls her eyes as they point out things that would be normal to muggles.
"Draco! You absolute idiot!" She says laughing "You're trying to tell me that when you would stare longingly across the great hall you didn't have a crush on him?" She says in a disbelieving tone. "I've never stared longingly!" He huffs.
He just has to secure an alchemy apprenticeship after he's graduated. Eventually people might forget his place in the war and he wouldn't be utterly despised by the wizarding world. The only downside of signing up for so many classes is that he has to actually attend every single one of them. To make matters worse his mother had insisted that he also take muggle classes as well.
"I really don't know anything. We just found her and I was trying to help and-" He starts but she stops him with the wave of her hand. "I'm aware that you didn't attack her directly." She says though the phrasing she used is not comforting to him in the slightest. "We have a new form of security that allows us to tracks spells. There weren't any spells performed in that hall all day much less in the time that you were there. But that creates far more questions than it answers." He is quiet hoping she will spit out whether or not he is being accused or not. They walk up a flight of stairs and he quickly realizes where they're going.
"What's that?" He asks looking curiously at the potions. He's always loved potions and if anything can distract him then this is it. "Drimuff" She says double checking before putting it into Mary's iv. "Isn't that to ward away dreams?" He asks and she nods. "That's right." She says flicking the next one she has to wait for the last of the drimuff to drain before she adds it. "It'll help keep her from falling too deeply into sleep and hopefully wake her in time."
"Keep quiet and stay under the cloak" Harry whispers grabbing Draco's arm and pulling him up. He inspects a paper for a moment
Purebloods view dimples as weakness a sign of weakness and dirtied blood. If tou have dimples then it is simply assumed that you are a blood traitor. Knowing this would ruin them Draco's parents taught him not to smile. Even when he is dosed with potion if he smiles he is scolded fiercely. He didn't even realize this was abnormal until he met other purebloods and found that they freely smiled. But he had to think of his family, if another pureblood saw him their family would surely be disgraced. As the sole heir of his line he holds the weight of his family legacy on his shoulders. And the mistake of forgetting his potion just once could ruin everything they worked for.
"Good afternoon, Sir Malfoy." She said quietly bowing slightly at the waist, Draco couldn't remember her name even though she had been working in the manor at least a month. Though he was gratefully spared as she continued on "Your parents have requested your presence in your father's office." Draco restrained himself from groaning, though his friends didn't do the same.
"Can you stop pulling me?" Draco huffs and Harry shoots him a glare. "I said no talking" at this Draco glares as Harry pulls him around another tree which knocks against his shoulder. "You're dragging me into trees!" Draco argues and Harry huffs "Then just stay close! Our feet can already be seen if we're not crouching." Draco looks down at their feet and sure enough there seems to be a line which stops just over their ankles. He quickly moves toward Harry until it touches the ground.
"Draco" she says nodding to the gauze and he quickly moves to the edge of the bed to press on the wound. "Did you see who hexed him?" Pomfrey asks checking his vitals. But the girl at the foot of his bed quickly says "He wasn't hexed! He was in front of the class, everyone would have seen!" This makes Madam Pomfrey pause. "He wasn't hexed?" She asks again and several of them shake their heads. "He was having trouble with his presentation then he just fell and his head hit a chair on the way." Pomfrey looks at the comatose boy quizzically as if he is a puzzle that she can solve. She is listening to his heart when the door to the infirmirary opens once again and behind them is Headmistress Umbridge.
"I didn't do this, I couldn't." He says unable to look away from the girl's face. "I was trying to help, that's all." He jumps when he hears madam Pomfrey speak next to him "And you did dear, I don't know if she would have survived had you not found her when you did." She says carrying potions to the bedside table. He is quiet for a moment "But she will survive? She'll wake up won't she?" He asks and worry slips into his voice. That worry only increases when she doesn't answer immediately.
From time to time he has smiled at himself in the mirror and it looks strange, as if he is staring at an entirely different person. It feels disgraceful to look at himself before he has had his potion in the morning. Sometimes when he was younger he would pinch at his cheeks in an attempt to make his dimples  go away, but to no avail. Eventually he resigned himself to the fact that he was forever stuck with them. That for the rest of his life he'll have to be careful.
"No!" Draco says frantically shaking his head. "Please, Merlin no! Which way?" Draco asks looking around for a way out.
There is shock and anger throughout the class. However the professor, a young red haired woman seems unphased by his presence. Draco wants to sneer at her, as red hair just seems to have that effect on him at this point but she is grinning cheerily. "You're late, though the halls are ridiculously hard to navigate and it's only the start of term so just take a seat." She says waving him over to an empty seat with an anxious looking kid. "I got lost twice on my way here this morning" She says laughing then she sets an empty nameplate in front of him. She has a strange accent that he's only ever heard once or twice in passing and he can't place it. Though he hasn't traveled much anyways.
The storm begins to pick up as the minutes tick past and Draco picks herbs from his plants to steep them in his cauldron. Eventually the sleeping potion starts to take on a pearly sheen. But just as he is about to add lavender buds there is a loud crack of thunder. Instinctively he flinches away and in that same moment a spell flies over his head. The books burst off of his shelf behind him.
Once they make it out of the forest Harry makes a detour to stop in Hagrid's garden. He straightens and with the wave of his wand and a muttered incantation silvery light spills out of his wand. "I've found him, sorry for the trouble. I'll be around for tea sometime soon." He says and Draco looks at him confused. But this is quickly overshadowed by the shimmering stag that comes out of Harry's wand. It's undeniably beautiful and Draco watches with wonder.
He rips it up hating how cryptic she is being. It feels as though he is once again a pawn in someone else's game. He has to wonder if it is a threat towards the headmistress. He has never liked her but is he supposed to step in if to stop whatever his mother is planning? He already let Dumbledore die, can he handle letting her die as well.
"At least he hasn't jinxed you yet, I can't say the same for my roommate." She grumbles flopping down on the bed next to him.
Draco sits still for a while feeling awkward as Harry draws him. He's not sure where exactly to look. So he fixes his gaze on the far wall and sits stony faced the same way he would for family portraits. "Do you always scowl?" Harry asks and Draco rolls his eyes.
Harry takes a step closer nearly nose to nose with Draco who refuses to step back. "If you try anything-" He sayss leaving the threat unfinished. Draco stays silent wishing he had a threat he could throw out as well. But instead without his gaze wavering from Harry he says "I understand." Through gritted teeth, as if it is painful to do so.
He tries to read further but it makes him feel slightly ill. He only manages a third of his breakfast before he gives up. Pansy comes into the great hall smiling and says "Did you see the article?" She asks grabbing a strawberry from the middle of the table. "You're welcome!" She says in a sing song voice before popping the fruit into her mouth and taking a seat next to him. "That was you?" He asks still unsure how to feel.
"Who?" Draco asks and Harry scoffs. "Seriously couldn't tell if you're joking if someone paid me." Though Draco wasn't joking at all. Even though most of the class had been about DaVinci and the Mona Lisa he had been far too distracted by Harry merrily mixing paints next to him. He bites his lip remembering his mother's advice then before he can talk himself out of it he sits up and smiles. It feels entirely wrong, particularly to be smiling in front of Harry. When Harry looks up his mouth cracks into a goofy grin that makes his heart jump up into his throat. He swallows nervously his smile quickly falling away.
Once they sat his father steepled his fingers in front of him and his mother sat straight backed with her hands in her lap. Still they seemed statuesque and he tried to mirror them, his back straight and his hands folded in his lap. "Draco, we have some news to discuss with you." His mother started, her tone light. Draco nodded feeling a growing tension in the room though he wasn't sure if he was only creating it in his mind. "Well, we'll be hosting a party tonight, your clothes are laid out for you and-"
"Pansy I'm being serious!" He says and she sighs rolling her eyes. "Fine, what is it?" She asks closing the door and plopping down on her bed. He suddenly goes silent wondering if he should actually go through with telling her. He looks around the room again and fidgets for a moment "My roommate is gone, happy? Come on, spit it out."
Each time he manages to fall asleep he is jolted awake by the wind whistling, a branch tapping against the window, or the deep seated fear that he might be attacked in his sleep. Eventually he is awoken by the pattering of rain which refuses to let him drift off again so he gives up and trudges over to his desk.
He moves to the window absently handing a treat to the owl. He was hoping it might be Crabbe or Goyle saying their goodbyes but instead it's his mother. It is a letter scrawled quickly, he can hardly recognize her handwriting. Where it is normally curling with care it looks messy and almost haphazard. She has continually grown colder towards him and were it not for her name on the envelope and the familiar slant of her letters he might think it was forged by someone else.
He's never had to pack for himself, he'd always had the servants do it for him but now is as good a time as any to start. He grabs two bags that are small enough to carry and sits them on his bed beside his suit. Then he quickly begins filling them. He has to pack and repack three times to decide what he should be bringing with him. It consists of mostly clothes and money though there are a few trinkets he can't bear to part with. Looking over the bags he nods in satisfaction then hides them under his bed. He'll have to ask Crabbe hide them near the stables before the party.
He listens at the door for a moment, listening for the pop of the house elf disaparating then he pushes open the door. Pansy who is sipping a firewhiskey still in her wet gown startles at the sight of him and nearly spills her drink. She takes a moment to right herself then huffs "Merlin! I almost lost my drink!" She says raising the glass to her lips to take another drink.
The attention from the article is polarizing to say the least. The first time someone actually walked up to him to ask about what happened it was jarring. There were even a few first years who knew the girl that had been hexed that came up to thank him. He was so surprised that he could only managed a sentence of halting sympathy. Though many people were still avoiding him there seemed to be slightly less hostility than there was when they started term.
He tires quickly after having run so much but he pushes forward as he can still hear them. He hides himself behind a tree taking a moment to gulp lungfuls of air. He's about to run again when he feels something yank him roughly to the side. Without thinking his hand balls into a fist and in very muggle fashion he punches whatever it was that grabbed him. Only after he sees Harry doubled over does he recognize him.
"You don't have to go that far" Blaise says, for once trying to be the voice of reason for Draco as opposed to the other way around. "You'll lose your inheritance, you know how strict your parents are." But Draco shakes his head resolutely "I don't want their money if it means I have to live my life by their terms." He looks around the table and the excitement has turned into worry. "If you're truly my friends then you'll help me get out." His voice breaks slightly and the desperation behind his words is apparent.
He stands not wanting to wallow any further and he picks up his book to go check it out. The librarian is an old witch and she smiles gently. He is taken aback for a moment as this is one of the first smiles he'd recieved from a stranger in quite a while. It made him want to smile back but the potion that keeps his dimples away only lasts for so long. If he were to smile there's no telling if they would poke through or not so he simply nods and takes the book with him.
But instead of looking at all defeated Pomfrey's expression only grows more defiant. "If a child dies due to lack of medicine, that will be entirely your fault." Pomfrey says clearly angry. But instead of responding Umbridge just tuts and shakes her head as she turns around and leaves.
There is a hesitation before he gets up but quickly he searches through his trunk. Harry turns to look at him and then he finds it. A little vial of dreamless sleep potion. He takes the potion and places it on Harry's bedside table. He's always found it easiest to apologize with gifts. It may also be a 'please don't tell anybody that I cried and then you had to save me from centaurs' bribe. It's quite a small gift but it will have to do.
To lose a war is a terrible thing, particularly when everyone you have ever loved loses alongside you. If he could go back he wouldn't waste his time scheming ways to insert himself into the battle. He should have protected his family and friends, though they would undoubtedly refused to have listened. He and all of Voldemort's other supporters  were childishly hopeful that he would carry them to an idyllic future. Draco wanted his approval so desperately but the dark lord trusted nobody. It seems the harder he tried the more that he was hated.
She starts to explain the uses of different herbs and how they interact with one another. How egg shell can protect you, and sunflower seeds can bring you happiness. As she speaks he can feel himself relaxing. He may not know how he feels about Harry, or what side he might be on in a resurgence, but he knows potions. That is one thing he can be sure of.
"We can only hope it won't backfire." She says with a shrug folding up the paper. "She didn't tell you?" She asks and Draco shakes his head. "Typical. We fight in a war and we're still not considered grown up enough to hear our parents plans." She huffs and Draco looks at her curiously, eager to push the article out of his mind.
He vaguely registers running out of the school but feeling his shoes hitting the ground is the only thing that is keeping him together, so he just keeps running. There are tears streaming down his face again amd he trips and scrambles up only to keep running. He wipes at his eyes but slowly realizes there's nobody around to see him. Instead when he stops there are only trees looming high above him. Fear instantly grips him as he turns to search for a path out, but there is only the ominous noises of the forbidden forest surrounding him.
Though after the war, something he had never considered was how their relationship might change. He'd expected Harry to take a job as an auror and that in the future they would only interact in passing. Perhaps an awkward conversation or two. He would see Harry on the streets and either they would avoid one another or perhaps a small nod would pass between them. At the very least he expected not to see him during the entirety of his seventh year. With his parents in azkaban he had to do everything in his power to recover their reputation, and the lack of distraction was a welcome change. But something he didn't expect was to get to hogwarts for his seventh year only to find that Harry Potter is his new roommmate.
"Come on, it's simple! We just tell our parents we're each staying at the other's homes. They aren't too fond of one another so that will buy us a weekend at the very least. If we leave tomorrow we'll have plenty of time to get there for the first weekend of the party then we'll return and they'll be none the wiser." Crabbe said pushing back his chair and standing as if the matter is settled.
"It was you wasn't it?" Harry says and Draco tries to look innocent, something that doesn't come naturally to him even when he is. "I don't know what you mean" He says wishing Harry would move out of the doorway.
"How do you do that?" Draco asks a little stunned. "You're not worried that they'll be pissed or cut you off or something?" Draco asks and Crabbe shrugs.
Through the war he tried to be strong, he tried to follow orders. He wanted to show his parents that he is capable of carrying on their name. But he failed time and time again and after they lost the war he had to look back and wonder if what he'd done was right. In the moment he'd always believed that he was on the right side. He had the support of family and friends and he had never known anything else. He was always told that the dark lord would bring peace and prosperity. His life had already been laid out for him the moment he was born, even with his unsightly dimples. He knew who he was and where he belonged and he never questioned it, that is, until Potter came along.
Draco can't help but be curious why she would want mens robes but he can't question it in front of the shop keeper so instead he says "I'd like a suit of the same cut just a darker fabric when you're finished" And he shoots Pansy a look which she pretends she doesn't see. After some time her suit has been sewn and Pansy smiles at herself in the mirror. "Tell your brother I will tailor eet for a good deescount" She says and Pansy nods smiling but as she is about to speak there is a loud scuffling and muffled voices from the front of the store. "Of course" pansy says quickly then bolts toward the front.
He can't pull his eyes away as Harry hits the dummy again. His muscles shifting with each movement, Draco closes his eyes feeling embarrassed but with each hit he can see Harry behind his eyelids imagining his strong arms. He tries to push the images away, but with the next hit there is a grunt that for a split second makes him imagine Harry's lips soft and slightly parted. His eyes pop open and he says quickly "Potter!" Needing the onslaught to his brain to end. For the first time Harry looks over at him, his glare piercing. He fumbles for a moment trying to remember why he wanted to talk with Harry in the first place. "I uh I wanted to apologize" Draco stammers and he wants to die on the spot.
"Mr.Malfoy I'm disappointed to see that you're not in class as well." She says. "And to my knowledge there aren't any shared classes between ravenclaws and slytherins at this time, do you care to explain or should I just presume you were wandering the halls and give you a detention?" Draco splutters for a moment, he's still not used to being chastized, particularly by Umbridge who he'd thought was fond of him due to his time in the inquisitorial squad. But before he can come up with an explanation Pomfrey cuts in. "He started his apprenticeship with me today. I left the file for Mcgonagall, I do hope that you've gotten to it by now." She says with the perfect mixture of confidence and condescending.
Draco ducks into an alcove when he sees a flash of red hair and he waits as the female Weasley passes. It's tiring to continually hide like this but it feels preferable to being hexed into oblivion. She has a nasty jelly legs jinx that makes your legs ache for days afterwards. And if just one of them knows then surely all of them know.
He looks around once more and starts in the direction he thinks he came from. Everything looks the same and with every step twigs crack underfoot and he's certain he'll be attacked. He can hardly breathe as he moves through the forest. His eyes trace along what would be the horizon were it not for the gnarled trees surrounding him in every direction. There isn't a trace of light to tell him the way back to hogwarts.
Not wanting to think think about his father he heads to his trunk deciding that whatever happens it would be Harry that requests to change dorms, not him. The room is cramped and lacks the grandeur of the slytherin dorms but if he is going to make it through the year then pure obstinance will see him through.
