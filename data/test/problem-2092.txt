Shrugging off Myrtle’s questions, ignoring her completely, Draco pushed through her out of the toilet stall, scarcely noticing the cold. He left Myrtle behind, composing a letter to Borgin in his head, the spectre’s chill deep and spreading within him.
They had been snogging for the past two weeks now, once a day, twice if Draco was lucky. It seemed Potter had his timetable memorised because he always knew when to catch Draco in the breaks between lessons. At night, it would be Draco, consulting the Marauder’s Map, who would seek Potter out.
“Imagine if every criminal walked around with a calling card – how useful that would be,” Draco said.
Eventually, the Hat slides over his head, blocking out the intrusive stares of the other students. He heard the swell of chatter, until the Hat speaks and drowns everything else out.
Zabini fell into a huffy silence, irritated that Draco should bring up Pansy. Draco suppressed a smirk, stuffing his hands into his pockets. So he was right then: Zabini did fancy Pansy. He was keeping away from her to protect her – how clichéd! Perhaps after Draco was done with the Cabinet, he could do some research on Zabini’s curse.
She takes him into her arms, holding him tightly. Draco squeezes his eyes shut briefly, clinging to the warmth of his mother’s embrace, but he keeps his hands tightly clasped behind his back. He doesn’t reach out for her. She pulls back, her brows creased.
down? He must have been gagging on the old fool’s cock, of course!
‘Then a simple shove should do it,’ Yaxley hissed, prodding Draco in the back. ‘Go on, Malfoy,
The other man stops, blinking his large, dark eyes. ‘Isn’t he? Salazar, we thought that the two of you have been together since Hogwarts. Aren’t you living together?’
By the end of the night, when the house-elves are putting out the fires and hanging up sparkling clean pots on the walls, Harry hasn’t found out why Malfoy asked him to dinner, but he knows now how Malfoy’s eyes gleam silver when he laughs, and his laughter tastes like having his favourite stew warm in front of the fireplace.
Behind Potter, Weasley made a noise of protest, raising his wand. Granger grabbed him, hissing at him, ‘
Sirius was attacked by killers sent by his family—or what remains of it after the war. Harry knows that Sirius’s family, the Blacks, were bad people: Dark wizards who supported Voldemort, the man who killed Harry’s parents and waged a war on the wizarding world that lasted eleven years. This, he heard in little by little, whenever Minnie or Moony mentioned it in the passing. They don’t talk about it, because Sirius doesn’t like to.
‘I rather envy the child now. Between the two of you, he will be quite the spoiled brat,’ the male Veela says.
When he finished speaking, Draco looked at Harry, realising towards the end that this father he was speaking so glowingly of was, after all, a Death Eater. A murderer who had fled the country rather than deal with the aftermath of their wrong choices. He pulled back a little, waiting for condemnation, holding his breath, suspending hope.
Harry looked up and smirked to see the need written clear across Malfoy’s borrowed face. ‘No need to be so rude.’ Without further warning, he dipped his head and wrapped his mouth around the head.
He hears Harry’s thoughts clear as day:
A thought flashes across his mind, blinding in its clarity: this is the reason why Harry himself has such an acute sense for Draco, why his wand with its Veela hair core heats up in Draco’s presence. They say omegas and alphas are naturally drawn to each other—their biology demands it. Harry is after all, omega, and Draco is alpha, Veela,
He flashed a grin at Potter. The other man snorted, and nudged Draco’s foot with his foot. His bare foot. The mere touch heated up Draco’s skin. Draco swallowed his gasp, and moved his feet away. Potter looked disappointed.
get up,’ Harry’s eyes flick up, over Draco’s shoulder. ‘Fuck.
Harry doesn’t need to know. Draco doesn’t care to have the sort of relationship Sirius and Remus have: he is revulsed by the thought of romance and kissing and sex. It feels filthy, mud he cannot scrub from his skin, like the accidental-not-accidental touches from strangers that linger. He doesn’t need that, so he doesn’t see how the soul-bond would change his friendship with Harry. As long as he can still protect Harry—that is the only thing that matters.
, she writes in her neat, square print
He strode forward, pulling his left sleeve up. Under the faltering light in the shop, the Dark Mark appeared alive, the snake undulating across Draco’s skin. Borgin became even whiter.
He made for his favourite coffee shop, a tiny place with five tables down a side street. As usual, there was no one else there but the sunny, half-blind, ancient owner. She called Harry dearie and always gave him a large, homemade, gooey chocolate chip cookie for free. He settled down at his table by the window, wondering how he could get out of the dinner; it would be his third time in a row now. Mrs Weasley might just march down to Grimmauld Place to drag him out by the ear.
He didn’t think it would be this difficult, saying good-bye to his parents, the sound of his heartbeat drowning out the
His cock hardened further. His throat was tight. He could only shake his head. He lined his cock up against Potter’s cleft. Potter’s eyes widened. Then Draco started moving, slipping his cock in and out between the cheeks of Potter’s beautiful arse. Potter relaxed instantly, dropping his head back onto his arm, tightening his arse obligingly.
lucky to be born in a family such as ours.’
‘Not true,’ Harry said a little quickly. ‘He didn’t.’ He shot a warning glare at Zabini. ‘Malfoy – he wouldn’t do a thing like that. I was with him out of my own free will. That bollocks about a love potion is only that – bollocks.’
Draco froze, wondering if he could just duck into the Room. He realised that would reveal the Room’s location to Filch and sighed deeply. Filch was already pelting up the corridor to him, accompanied by Mrs Norris as always.
He reaches out and takes Draco’s hand – all balled up in a fist, his skin cold to the touch – between his two hands. Draco stills. Harry takes a deep breath, looking up beneath his lashes. Draco’s face is blank, devoid of emotion. For all of Harry’s fears, the fact remains that Draco is
The old man waves a hand impatiently. ‘You don’t need to know how—you’re a Veela!’
,’ Ron sighs. ‘You should have seen it, Draco.’
It is easy enough to find Voldemort in the burned-out husks of Hogsmeade. His monsters are sleeping or fighting with each other; some of them try attacking, but Harry’s spells are dead-on, and Draco easily claws them aside. They slip through the night, leaving behind wails of pain and rage—heralding their arrival to the Dark Lord.
Harry’s face pales, and then flames. He puts his quill down, passing a hand over his face. ‘Besides the fact that I don’t particularly have anyone I want to have sex with, you know people will be able to tell I’m omega just by
Malfoy gives him a sly look. ‘You need not look far from home to find one such specimen.’
‘Thank you!’ Harry says, taking the present gleefully.
Potter raised his eyebrows. “You sure?”
is how crazy I am about you.’
‘Would you?’ Harry brightens up, looking from him to Moony, who is wearing a slightly aggrieved expression.
“I had to tell my boss, Robards, and Ron, who’s my partner and together with me on this case. Don’t worry,” Potter added hastily, seeing the horror-struck look on Draco’s face, “cases are confidential, and we don’t discuss it out of the office. Although Hermione probably knows by now,” he shrugged sheepishly. “She knows better than to spread it around, though.”
Harry stared back, a hint of fear in his eyes. Draco’s heart wrenched in his chest. He couldn’t have Harry scared of him, scared of falling prey to this damned Veela charm. Draco scrambled to his feet.
‘I’m afraid that’s not a secret you’re privy to, Potter,’ Draco said snottily, shoving himself up against the wall. ‘Especially not after you forcibly pushed me down.’
‘Colin was very fond of you,’ Mr. Creevey continues, his voice gentle now. ‘You were so kind to him when he was a first year. You helped him immensely, Mr. Bennet – perhaps more than you realise.’
Forever.
“No, I
Yaxley sat up quickly, face bright red as titters of amusement curled around the room. He glared around at the others, but he had never been popular. Leaping to his feet, he drew his wand.
Draco stopped trying to pull away and stared at Potter in utter astonishment. ‘Of course not,’ he exclaimed, offended. ‘I’m hardly as pathetic as that. I have no intention of changing myself to become someone more palatable for
Potter’s house was exactly like Draco could have imagined, and more.
decency, that there were certain levels you would never stoop to. Morgana’s sagging tits, Malfoy, I thought there was hope for you.’
‘Severus,’ Draco’s whisper was hoarse and painful; he tasted blood in his mouth.
‘I did not think they would deign to associate themselves with Muggles,’ Ron adds.
sizzling through him, lodging in his chest. He chokes on the omega's storm-washed scent: water running clean and cool. They crash together, arms pulling, hands grappling, ships colliding in the night, buoyed by the fervour of a storm.
‘We don’t talk about sex!’ Draco says, mortified.
Draco inhaled deeply, catching the fragrance of the fresh autumn scent of the woods at the Manor, Quidditch leathers, and something that he thought he had scented just a few minutes ago outside the classroom. Potter passed him and the glorious smells wafted, momentarily intensifying.
The body in his arm convulses, and abruptly, Draco feels Harry again: his soul, his being, his entirety flooding his senses. The warmth of his skin, the headiness of his melting-caramel scent, the light of his joy—Harry is pressing against him, arms around his neck, face angled upwards. ‘Draco,’ he says his name like a kiss, gentle against Draco’s face. ‘Draco, I came back.’

– to be dragged into them again. It was futile wanting a man who would never give him a single thought, and Draco had had enough of futility and non-choices.
The Headmaster’s little protégé.
She gave him a sympathetic smile, as if empathising with his inability to be a proper person with functioning emotions. ‘Thank you. She always looked forward to matches against you – you presented her with a problem she couldn’t solve and there was nothing she liked better than solving problems. Anyway, let me introduce you to the rest of the committee.’
Draco shakes his head. ‘Hermione wouldn’t wait around when there are other blokes interested in her. She shouldn’t.’
Harry watches Draco’s face, whose eyes are closing; Draco has brought his hand up to his cheek, pressing it against his pillow-warm skin.
It was a gratifying feeling to know that he had managed to seduce his rival. Potter was the one who had pushed him away earlier, who had rejected him because he was
‘Draco, it’s fine. You didn’t hurt me, you know.’
Potter did not look amused at his quip. “Yeah, well, this attack on your life is a very deliberate, very well-planned one. It isn’t a casual opportunistic attack. Ron and I think we need to start looking at these death threats. See if any of them have decided to take it beyond letters.”
Swallowing hard, grinding his sharpening fangs together, Draco watches the other boy’s reflection. Potter has averted his green eyes, keeping them on Madame Malkin, as she reads out his measurements. He gnaws on his bottom lip, shoving his glasses up. Their parents are now talking about Florean Fortescue’s ice cream with forced jocularity, but the two boys standing next to each other are silent.
‘We were all walking up the hill, back to Hogwarts. Bell and her friend were in front of Potter, Weasley and Granger. They saw the curse take her – they were the ones who ran for help,’ Zabini said. ‘Why are you trying to curse Bell, Malfoy? Is this some stupid tactic against the Gryffindor Quidditch team?’
; hypocrites, the two of them—and then baffled, when Harry says he and Draco are not
‘No, I suppose most people don’t,’ he replies wearily. ‘Sirius told me, before we started school, because I need to be careful in the showers. I thought you would know because you’re alpha and raised in a pureblood family—your parents—’
There is nothing their parents can do after that, but to put Draco’s things in together with Harry’s and the other brown-haired boy, Neville’s. Mother manages to hide her surprise well enough, but Father looks disconcerted, glancing repeatedly at Black and Lupin. Draco steps up into the compartment, ostensibly to help his parents arrange his things, and Black grabs Harry’s arm, bending over to hiss into his ear. His low murmur reaches Draco’s Veela ears easily enough.
The fireplace blazes, the flames vividly green, and Dumbledore steps through, followed by a stout witch carrying a large doctor’s bag. After a brief scan of the empty kitchen, Dumbledore nods at the stairs, saying tersely to the witch: ‘They’re upstairs.’ She disappears without a word, sparing Harry a curious glance.
Thirdly, Harry was sodding
. After Harry has fallen asleep and Draco is on the verge of dreams, he hears the door creak open.
His friend stared at him as if he didn’t know him. ‘What have you done?’ Zabini repeated through unmoving lips. ‘
have you done?’
Harry whips around, his eyes wide behind his glasses. He opens his mouth, but pauses; something in his eyes shifts, and Draco feels a veil drawn across their bond, like a mooncalf shying away from exposure. He swallows his alarm. Harry is intertwining his fingers with Draco’s, his face impassive.
‘My ma was a great cook, she taught me how to cook. I baked these muffins, have some, Potter, they’re good. I do rather well with pot roast too. That’s Zabini’s favourite. He thinks I should carry on with the restaurant once he gets the sanctions on Knockturn lifted. Millie – Millicent Bulstrode – has a shop here too; her parents sold herbs and they broke now because they can’t do business. They don’t sell anything
His voice was a weak shattered thing in the enveloping darkness. Snape froze for a moment, but when Yaxley called again, he made his way to the doorway. He still wouldn’t look at Draco. Draco spat out a mouthful of blood.
‘I make no excuses for my past offences, of course,’ Sir William says to Harry with a gallant bow. ‘But I confess that I had the false idea in my head that you might not enjoy yourselves with us! I understand that the Bennets, Weasleys, Lovegoods and Diggorys are perfectly pleased with their own company.’
‘Ah,’ he says blankly. ‘Well, the truth is never pleasant to hear. Fine. I am very sorry to have taken up your time, Potter. Point me towards Hogsmeade, and I will leave you alone.’
at least, Harry will not let anyone destroy.
Draco pulls Harry’s trousers and pants off in one smooth movement, and he sees for the first time Harry’s cock, fully hard and dripping with precum. His mouth waters. Oh, this doesn’t compare to the flaccid cock Draco has glimpsed in the showers
Harry tries not to think too much about things ending—mustn’t give it any attention, or Draco would feel it too, and ask uncomfortable questions—especially when people insist on carrying on life as usual.
‘It doesn’t hurt,’ Harry assures him, smirking in amusement, his cheeks still red. ‘It’s not like the potions—at all, trust me. It’s …’ He screws up his face, embarrassed. ‘Merlin, do I really have to say this?’
‘Thank you,’ he says lamely. ‘And I’m sorry.’
He whipped around, impatient, glaring as she reached his side, breathless with exertion. Further down the hill, Goyle and Crabbe were hurrying to catch up, loaded down with bags of sweets. Zabini was still down in Hogsmeade, spending the day with one of his Ravenclaw mates.
? I will not let you diminish my father’s courage, Potter. Do you hear me?’
‘I’m sorry, Draco,’ he said the night they had a fight about Harry letting Voldemort into his head. ‘I wasn’t thinking at all, about how it affects you. I—I’m really sorry. Do you feel—no, I mean, I know how much you and everyone worries about me. I shouldn’t—I really should know better.’
Harry gave a half-shrug. ‘You’ve helped me by allowing me to help,’ he said honestly.
Mr. Henry Bennet is of the firm opinion that there is nothing fairer than the English countryside on a fine summer’s day such as this. His gaze sweeps across the verdant fields, the round green trees, and the quiet country lane with warm appreciation. He is secure in his solitude on the way back to Longbourn from Netherfield Park.
‘You want to be in Gryffindor, eh?’ a deep, gravelly voice says, directly into Draco’s mind. ‘Curious … with a mind like yours, I’d have thought you’d choose Ravenclaw or Slytherin. You are difficult.’
’re fucking insane! I don’t know what you think Potter and I were doing, but we’re not fucking snogging. We were serving our detention all right? Filch gave us extra for breaking all those desks that night.’
Draco didn’t reply, merely stared. Potter stared at the Headmaster incredulously.
‘Don’t encourage them!’ Moony looks at Harry anxiously. ‘You shouldn’t be rushing into such things, Harry. Wait until you’re older, until this—this is all over.’
Draco glances at Mother, his eyebrows raised. ‘Do you reckon Father’s being sarcastic?’
“I’m not,” Draco said. “I’m a realist.”
Lucas Norton didn’t seem to have a destination in mind. He wended his way up Diagon Alley, heading in the general direction of Gringotts gleaming white and gold at the end of the street. He entered a bookshop and came out a book-shaped bulge in his coat pocket, and stopped by a bakery for a scone. Harry hung back, knowing that the Charm, which tugged on his wrist like an invisible string, would warn him if Luc tried to run.
He looks further down the beach. There is a boat in the water, its hull resting on the sand, and people are getting on. There are others sitting in the sand, watching the boat, most of them alone. One or two are looking at him with vague interest, as if trying to figure out if they know him. They look away after a while.
“Sure.”
The night air gusted around them, stealing under Draco’s robes. He shivered and lifted his hand a little higher. He would have to finish this soon.
‘You’ve broken Potter,’ Millie said, sounding awed.
‘Oh, no, no, it has been a
‘Welcome, Mr and Mrs Malfoy,’ the male Veela greets them, his voice a deep melodious baritone that makes Narcissa blush.
‘Because I don’t think I can stop if you touch me,’ Potter said, his voice ragged.
“It’s all right,” Harry added before Draco could speak. “I have done horrible things to you as well. We’re even.”
clearly know. No, no, it doesn’t matter whether they are soulmates or not. The bigger problem here is that everyone knows Draco Malfoy is alpha. If they see the way he behaves around Harry, it is only a matter of time before they start wondering why.
! She made me write lines, but she wanted me to use this torture device—a quill that cuts into the back of my hand as I write! I refused, of course, and I stated very clearly the code of conduct that stipulates the punishment students are to receive in situations like this.
. It isn’t odd at all for Harry to be so captivated by Draco.
‘Yes, Draco?’ Mother asks a little too eagerly.
Potter’s nose broke, the blood splattering everywhere. Potter’s eyes rolled in pain. Something within Draco wrenched painfully. He ignored it, bending down to yank the Cloak out from under Potter. He threw it over Potter and the bloodied gallant hero disappeared.
‘I’m sorry,’ he mumbles, sweating beneath his clothes. ‘I’m sorry, I won’t do it again. I’m really sorry. Please – please don’t send me back. Please.’

Harry takes a deep breath, and bursts out: ‘There’s more. I’m going to tell you something, but it’s important nobody else knows. You can’t even tell the others, or your parents. It’s
‘No,’ Regulus brushes his question aside impatiently. ‘But if the Dark Lord is still alive, everyone is still in danger! What have you done, boy?’
Sirius is sprawled across the floor, his head in Moony’s lap. Moony has a hand on Sirius’s forehead, his back straight and stiff, as he runs his wand up and down Sirius’ body, murmuring a steady stream of spells. Harry stops by the grandfather clock, uncertain. Sirius is groaning. Moony moves a little to the left, and Harry has a clear view of how Sirius looks.
‘Draco,’ Harry groans, canting his hips upwards.
,’ she bellowed, slapping a hand on the table, startling Harry. ‘How
‘You go ahead. I think I’ll take a bath at the Prefects’ Bathroom,’ Draco said to Zabini, who – in a mark of his annoyance with Draco – nodded curtly and went down the passageway.
Draco continues talking, his voice airy and his footsteps loud and obnoxious in the quiet forest. ‘As you can imagine, my mission is exceedingly urgent. I can assure you, Potter, that a meeting in the Forbidden Forest was at the very bottom of my list of expectations for today.’
Draco stood in the doorway of his childhood home and stared at the creature that had taken it over. The monster that wanted to take over the rest of the wizarding world. Lord Voldemort stared at him with cold, pitiless red eyes.
Draco thinks of refusing—
Mid-way through the conversation, a little third-year girl knocked on the door. Red-faced, she mumbled something indecipherable and thrust a scroll into Zabini’s hands. She bolted immediately after.
“Thanks for agreeing, Theo,” Draco said when Weasley finally left the flat, beaming and whistling.
‘I’m afraid our conversation does not interest the children,’ Mother says to the other ladies, nodding at Draco and Pansy with a benevolent smile. ‘Rose, what do you say to Pansy taking Draco on a tour of your lovely gardens? I think there would be enough there to entertain the children and keep them out of our hair.’
Cursing, he struggles to regain his composure, the bloody feather crushed in his fist. Circe’s fucking pigs, he has been doing
‘Yes,’ Harry says, gazing down reverently at the tangible existence of his connection to Draco.
‘He won’t intercede with Dumbledore on our behalf?’ Mother asks, and sighs. ‘Oh, perhaps I should have gone. He has always liked me better than you or Bella.’
, called you the love of my life. Do you want to know how I managed to get them to write such tripe? I bartered, like a proper Slytherin would. You should be proud of me, Draco.’
of tattered black robes, the Dark Lord died in a gentle expulsion of grey ash and smoke.
Draco opened his eyes again. Warm and dazed in the afterglow of a magnificent wank, he looked straight in Potter’s direction and said, ‘Did you like what you saw, Potter?’
and you’re fucking disgusted with yourself. So you’re trying to pretend you’re doing something good, you’re trying to get me to join
"Ugly," he repeats, closing the distance, crowding Potter against the moss-covered stone wall fencing the garden in. There are bird twittering madly in the twisted woods beyond the wall. "Do you think I want pretty?" His voice is low, trembling. "Do you think I want

Between them, Goyle and Crabbe hauled the luggage up onto the racks, Crabbe scowling at Draco. Crabbe had a none-too-subtle crush on Pans, and despite knowing that Draco was gay, he didn’t like how Pans clung to Draco. Not that Crabbe stood a chance in hell with her.
‘There is a bet going around the office that they might be.’
The worst of his agonies: two lines on his back, slashing down in an upside-down V. The skin is smooth there, no outward sign of trauma. The pain is deep down in his bones, a hot ache that throbs with every movement.
,’ Potter snarled, about to charge Draco before Dumbledore held out a hand. ‘Professor, I can take him –’
‘Draco?’ Mother turns, puzzled.
‘How wonderful it must be for rich women and their lucky relations – to have the liberty to choose to be single for as long as one wishes,’ Lizzy remarked once.
To remove all pride he could have had in his pureblood wizard status. To reduce him to a state no better than a vampire or a hag. Draco inhaled deeply, squeezing his eyes shut briefly.
‘Don’t move,’ he says hoarsely.
Mr. Blaise Zabini is a tall, well-built, dark young man dressed in a beautifully cut coat accentuated with a bright, patterned cravat. He gazes around the room with frank curiosity, whispering at points to the lady at his elbow, Miss Pansy Parkinson. The lady is by no measure the handsomest woman in the room, but she commands a degree of cautious attention for her air of stout confidence and slow, sly smile.The last gentleman, Mr. Draco Malfoy, gives a striking impression: white-blonde hair fashionably tousled; dressed in dark clothes that seem almost plain, but upon closer inspection, would reveal themselves to be made from rich, vivid materials worth at least ten Galleons a metre; and a cold, reserved air that wards off the slightest attempt at approach.
Harry felt oddly nervous as he awaited Hermione’s answer. They were sitting on the floor of the sitting room, sipping their drinks as they watched Teddy bang figurines of trolls and dragons together gleefully. The baby squealed in delight whenever the troll emitted a groan of pain. Harry couldn’t decide to be proud or concerned.
The sneer deepens as Eltanin watches, and realises with violent, terrified exhilaration that this omega is the thing that has come.
. How could I be? Your father is dead. No, I’m angry with myself.’
Draco doesn’t stir when Harry gets up.
‘Your intelligence is wrong, Blaise,’ he calls out without looking. ‘This is most certainly not the library.’
Draco’s head is spinning. He has never experienced such a thing, the sensation as if the very earth is sliding beneath his feet. People are saying such things about him and his family? He clasps his hands together to steady himself, focussing his mind on the heat between his palms. ‘Of course I’m real,’ he blurts unthinkingly.

Draco stares at him bleakly.
Slowly, Flitwick – little Flitwick, kind, bumbling Flitwick – slipped to the ground, landing on his bum, staring blankly at nothing. Around the Great Hall, there was gentle movement: the release of tension, the gasp of relief, the trickling of disbelief.
He does not think about it for the most part – until now, when the thought of Malfoy conjures worries about his lack of experience for a reason Harry does not want to know. He
The wind wails down the sloping sides of the wizarding graveyard, scattering pebbles and desiccated plants. The moon appears from behind the clouds, blazing down upon the stone cauldron. The night is not wicked, but gods, how much the moon loves to lend its power to the Dark Arts.
Harry found him in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
Ron groaned, and chucked a cushion at Harry. ‘Bloody hell, Harry! I bet that you would make the first move. Why in Merlin’s pants were you dragging your feet for?’
He could just see the Weasleys from here; they were half-blocked by a crowd of Hufflepuffs. He was searching for Potter before he even realised he was. Potter stood a distance away, talking at the Weasley patriarch. Weasley was nodding slowly, Potter looking increasingly frustrated as he went on.
‘The Map,’ Potter said, holding his hand out. His eyes were filled with black loathing, his upper lip curling as if Draco was something rancid.
‘I would thank you, Moody, not to volunteer to put my son in danger, when the adults were too weak to stop You-Know-Who the first time round,’ Remus replies, a growl starting at the back of his throat. Sirius has to put a hand on his shoulder to calm him down.
Harry cuts him off, barrelling on. ‘You shouldn’t be apologising. What the bloody hell are you saying sorry for? I’m the one who should be sorry—sorry that I’m not stronger. If only I could have shut Voldemort out—or if I have gone that night too. Maybe I was supposed to kill him then. I could have stopped it.’
Draco opens his mouth, but there is nothing to be said. What can he say in the face of such a bald confession? He shakes his head, shrugging off Harry’s hand. ‘I’m a Veela, Harry. Let me show you what that means.’
surprised when Lizzy deigns to give the gentleman her undivided attention as well.
he thinks, and can go no further.
‘Salazar, I had no idea you’re the sort who needs to ask,’ he says. ‘Did you ask Granger and Weasley too?’
, Harry thinks viciously, dumping his things on the floor and throwing himself onto his bed. He squeezes his eyes shut, balling his fists. It’s wrong – he knows it’s wrong – for him to be so angry. He’s being unfair. Draco is his best friend, but just because Harry isn’t having any sex himself, he can’t expect Draco to do the same. That’s just bloody mad – and unreasonable, since as a Veela, Draco thrives on sexual energy.

"Doesn't matter," Potter finally snarls. "I will hurt all of them—and you for daring to betray me."
Potter was wearing the clean-cut navy-blue robes of the Aurors. Draco wished Potter was instead wearing the Muggle clothes he had seen him in at Diagon Alley that day. His lean arm muscles had looked very satisfying in that faded blue T-shirt.
"Are we not?" Potter takes a step closer. "Our souls are made to match."
Draco was sobbing, heaving painful sobs ripping at his chest, fists pressed against his eyes. Myrtle murmured worriedly, desperate for his pain to stop. Once or twice, she came too close and Draco shuddered, hard, the chill painful on his skin.
Draco turns, the annoyance on his face clear in the light from Harry’s wand. ‘For the fourth bloody time, Potter,
‘What are you doing here?’ he asks. ‘Go home. Go back to your mate.’
They fall silent, and in the silence, Draco hears his heartbeat pulsing at his temples. His muscles are trembling at the effort of keeping him in place, and he is frozen to the bone; there is only so long even his Veela body is capable of bearing the strain.
“Healer Mitra didn’t mention anything else,” Draco frowned as well.
The piles of rubbish are close around them, the air dusty and tepid: row after row of cupboards missing doors and badly scratched desks and tilting chairs. Draco dashes perspiration from his eyes, glaring at the endless mess. The noises of Voldemort’s forces are closer: the attackers must be in the castle, baying for blood.
Draco wants to believe that Harry has changed his mind because of him, because he doesn’t want Draco to be tainted across their bond. That would mean that Harry knows and accepts it; he hasn’t come cursing and hexing at least. But so what if he does? What does it change, when Harry still has to hide his omega status?
’ve been following me.’
She grins down at him, picking up the broom and holding his hand with the other. ‘Do you have another favourite pudding you haven’t told me?’
‘I can do it, Mother,’ Draco said quietly, ignoring the quivering in his limbs screaming to cling to Mummy. ‘I will serve the Dark Lord well.’
It was Draco’s first time in contact with Muggles, and he had found them no different from any proud but overwhelmed parents of a precocious child. His own mother had often worn the same “That’s wonderful, dear” expression the Muggle woman had.
He was smiling when he opened the door and came face to face with Zabini. The world shifted beneath his feet and he thought he was falling, a Freezing Spell cast straight into his chest. Zabini was staring at Draco as if he did not know him, his face pale.
Hermione laughs at him later (while Ron cringes), but he honestly couldn’t have imagined that Ginny fancied
Harry’s lips were soft and warm and tasted of elf-made wine. After the brief touch, they pulled away, eyes still locked onto each other. Then Harry looked down, an embarrassed tinge to his cheeks.
Draco nods fervently, and says: ‘You’re not weak. You’re a Gryffindor—you’re bloody brave!
Potter’s head snapped up and Draco’s breath hitched in his throat. Potter’s eyes were blazing with raw volatile rage, searing as dragon’s breath. It was the same dark creature Draco had glimpsed in Madam Malkin’s when Narcissa had brought up Sirius Black – the same dangerous creature that promised violence and Draco had stupidly provoked it.
These are unwelcome realisations. Harry turns away from the gentleman before him, an agitation stirring in his breast.
wish to speak of the war? It is in the past. It is over. The dead are buried. Why does the living insist upon clinging to them? Memorials and anniversaries and rituals – I have no need for them! Let the dead stay buried! If

Theo bent over, and neatly plucked it out of his grasp. He knelt next to Draco’s head, and forced Draco’s head up by yanking on his hair. Spit landed on Draco’s face, warm and wet.
, you selfish prick.’ He stepped around Harry and walked away.
‘You have disappointed me,’ the Dark Lord finally said. ‘You have proved yourself to be as weak and stupid as Lucius. How unfortunate for you that the tasteless adage “Like father, like son” should prove true for you.’
Something has changed in the night.
. It had been more than three months since Lucius was returned to Azkaban and before that, he had been tortured daily, extensively.
Draco nods.
He has known separation from Draco, but not like this—a butcher knife sliding between his ribs, cleaving him into two, one half that was with Draco and the other that wasn’t. He couldn’t sense where his soulmate is in the world—he couldn’t even tell if he was still alive—he couldn’t do what Draco did in their fourth year, rescuing him from Voldemort. Harry is, after all, only human.
Draco thought of his mother – of strong, beautiful, flawless Narcissa Malfoy – in pain and screaming, writhing on the floor like an augurey which wings were being slowly ripped off, and the pain he thought he was used to, that he could no longer feel flared up, blinding and breath-taking.
“He told me that a lot of interbreeding went on in those days. Wizards were mostly living in isolation then, and there weren’t many fully magical villages. Wizards would take up with giants, Veelas, vampires, and other beings.
Malfoy looks at him. He is still looking down, but he feels Malfoy’s eyes boring into him.
Harry hoards these stories like a feral dragon guards its dented crowns and gold rings, baubles that will never fit him, but he fears losing all the same. He has always known Draco’s brilliance, of course. Now, the world sees it too, how brightly his mate shines beyond his mere appearance; how Harry’s so-called glory is only for killing one madman amongst history’s countless number of madmen, but
‘Yeah?’ Potter traced his knuckle up Draco’s jawline. ‘Would you have to give something very important or very expensive up?’
It will suffice to say that Harry’s relationship with Malfoy is a strained one. There is the historic rivalry between their Houses of Gryffindor and Slytherin, the former to which Harry, Ron, Hermione, Lizzy and Lydia belong. Most students maintain a mere pretence of competition in homage to tradition, but the enmity between Harry and Malfoy was genuine on both sides. For Harry, it stems from disdain at Malfoy’s arrogance for a station in life
“No!” Potter leaned forwards, and his muscles under his T-shirt bulged very nicely.
Walking away when every inch of his being screams out to claim Potter is like having his skin peeled off inch by torturous inch. Draco scrunches up his face, suppressing the swell of impotent rage, his palms jammed against his eyes.
what he said? Tell me.’
Hermione had looked uncertain, and would have said something if Weasley hadn’t shook his head and muttered something to her about
‘No, no, people know I’m alpha, you see? If they link us together, what if they think you’re omega? What if they find out? I can’t—I can’t let that happen. But if they see I’m dating other people, they wouldn’t think we are, would they? They wouldn’t suspect you, and we can remain friends. That’s fine, that’s normal—isn’t it? I—I’m
And somehow, seven years later, here they are: having dinner together. They have been for the past five weeks, sometimes on Saturday, most of the times on Friday. Frequent enough for Ginny to leer, ‘Is he your boyfriend now?’ Ernie, who was once more walking past their group in the corridor, replied over his shoulder, ‘Yes, he is!’, flashing Harry a shit-eating grin.
"Well, this is the start of a healthy relationship," Eltanin announces with mocking gaiety.
“No, you don’t,” Harry said, and they both knew he meant Draco hadn’t apologised to
you, Draco?’
Now, hearing about his rebirth as a Veela, he experienced the same unravelling of his mind, the floor-disappearing feeling of self-assurance cracking.
McGonagall strides forwards, taking the Hat from him, and says briskly: ‘Welcome to Gryffindor, Malfoy.’ She gestures him towards the Gryffindor table, smiling.
‘No, wait,’ Harry blurts, reaching out to grab Draco’s hand.
creeping over his skin like a weak Tickling Hex.
him. Harry had wanted him as much as he did, and he had thought
She manages to suppress her flinch. ‘Yes.’
‘You know Harry and I are soul-bonded,’ he says.
His guest arrives on time, ducking into the corner booth Harry has chosen and apologising for making Harry wait. Harry stands, helping the other wizard out of his coat.
He is naked because he has ripped his clothes to shreds while transforming, so Harry sees the hard muscles hardening and rippling beneath Draco’s pale skin, as his best friend springs forwards, looking half-demented with fury. Harry barely manages to dodge the attack, throwing up a Shield, which Draco’s claws scrape against with a screech.
Draco stares, looking as if Harry told him his mother looked like a hippogriff’s arse. ‘Fuck off, Potter. Do you think
‘I knew … so he wasn’t able to be a very effective spy after all …’
Mother gave him an unimpressed look. Without speaking, she had managed to make Draco feel even more like a petulant toddler.
here now, and Harry does not know what he can or cannot dream for anymore.
Malfoy is now. He’s not showing off in class, or being an obnoxious git. And he doesn’t eat in the Great Hall – did you notice? Isn’t that a
Harry rose to his feet, shaking out the cramps in his thighs. ‘Turn around.’ Goyle did, his face wobbly with fear and dread. The big man looked as if he were about to burst into tears.
As suddenly as the pain appears, it disappears, and Draco can breathe again, albeit with despairing bewilderment.
‘The old knick-knacks we have lying around the manor,’ Draco explains. ‘Where should we go? The Ravenclaw common room?’
Something has changed. It feels dangerous.
‘It is silly for one to assume that there are impossibilities,’ Hermione rebukes. ‘Why, simply cast your eyes at the man I now call husband.’
Voldemort’s forces have withdrawn, leaving behind an eerie silence underscored by the moans of the injured and dying. Tonks is dead, and so is Fred Weasley. Remus has been grievously injured by one of Voldemort’s werewolves, who also savaged Bill Weasley. Hermione was relentlessly subjected to the Cruciatus Curse by Bellatrix Lestrange, before Mother and Aunt Andromeda leapt into a duel against their own sister.
Harry turns to see Zabini, looking spectacular in burgundy robes and a smirk on his face.
‘It’s about the Dark Lord,’ the other boy whispers, eyes hardening into stone. He nods decisively, and pulls his chair closer, their hands still clasped together on the bed by Harry’s hip. ‘Tell me everything.’
He is waiting with a rope-bound figure at his feet. Death Eaters surround him, wands raised towards Draco and Harry. Everywhere else, giants, werewolves, vampires and hags linger in the shadows. Jeers and bays echo off scorched walls, as they land in the middle of the ragged circle. The prisoner jerks, and light falls across Snape’s face bleeding from a cut above his eye.
‘Hmmm …’ Potter nuzzled the underside of Draco’s chin with his nose. ‘Godric, Ron will kill me for this, but I’d rather give you a blowjob than go for practice.’ Draco’s cock twitched in interest. ‘The team’s a mess and … I’m terrible at being captain.’
But – but
“I don’t really know much about it,” Healer Mitra admitted. “It isn’t within my area of expertise. I really could arrange for a meeting with a Veela for you. There are a few in England.”
. Draco began moving his finger in gentle, circular motions, his other hand steadily stroking his cock.
‘No, no, I didn’t.’ Draco reaches out, covers Harry’s fist clenched on the table top.
Harry tugged Draco in by his wrist. He wrapped his arms loosely around Draco’s waist, leaning his forehead against his, their noses brushing. He stared into Draco’s eyes that made him of thunderheads, dark and volatile.
Four bubbling cauldrons stood near the middle of the room. Draco peered into them curiously as he passed, pausing as most of the others did at a gold-coloured cauldron. The vapours emitting from that cauldron smelled absolutely divine. He noted the mother-of-pearl sheen of the bubbling liquid – Amortentia.
. How can you be so bloody stupid, Malfoy?’
Draco obeys, squeezing his hands into fists, focussing his mind on the rush of air through his nose and down his throat and out of his mouth again. His heartbeat is thunderous in his ears, but he feels he can think again, through the screaming terror that he cannot feel Harry’s presence. He opens his eyes to see the two professors watching him, Dumbledore with an odd glimmer in his wise blue eyes.
‘Good,’ Snape said briskly. ‘Shall we return to the party then?’
They would win tonight, and finally—
‘You’re wrong by the way,’ he said casually, hitching his bag on his shoulder. ‘You’re not a battlefield against Voldemort. I’ve already won you. You’re mine.’
He blinks, his hand flying to his mouth. ‘Do I? I – I didn’t notice.’
Harry raises his hands, presses his fingers feather-light against Draco’s chest. Draco shudders, pleasure sparking across his skin. Harry reaches out a hand, hovering over Draco’s beak, and hesitates, a question on his face. Draco closes his eyes, knowing he is well and thoroughly conquered by this improbable man. He dips his head and Harry presses his palm to Draco’s ice-cold beak.
‘Well?’ Aunt Bellatrix demanded impatiently from behind him. ‘Is he Potter?’
The others are close on their heels.
‘What could
Draco shakes his head, amused. ‘No, Mother doesn’t make mistakes like that. You could write her to ask, but she might take it as an insult. It’s not like we can’t afford to give it to you.’
? You do seem to have quite decided opinions on that matter.’
‘What did they do to you?’ Draco asked softly.
‘You’re the only son,’ Ron points out. ‘Don’t your parents expect it of you?’
‘Oh,’ Draco says, unease twisting his guts.
‘Never thought of you as a ponce, Potter,’ he said. ‘You like taking it up the arse too, Potter? Would you like me to fuck you?’
The empty street gleams dully under the soft moonlight filtered by the occasional cloud. The village is still, deep with the solitude of the countryside. He tilts his head back, taking in a deep lungful of cold air, the black sky glittering with stars above him. It feels as if the night is within him too.
Draco gave a sharp bark of laughter. ‘Well, you’ll have to go back to the female Weasley and have ten red-haired children, won’t you?’
He led the way past a troll-leg umbrella stand, and down the hallway and narrow staircase into the kitchen.
. The lights are flickering on throughout the cottage, small and cosy with dark wood furniture and embroidered upholstery—and Harry’s warm caramel scent. The omega stops in the sitting room, a fire flickering in the hearth, and turns to face Draco. There is a hint of sour embarrassment on his scent now. Draco frowns, cocking his head.
image.’
‘So, you want our child,’ the man says, examining them carefully.
Harry huffs, twisting around to look up at the blond. The other man glares down at him, hands on either side of Harry’s head. Harry sees his beauty painted by moonlight: pale skin, eyes silver as daggers, flushed cheeks, kiss-swollen lips—and desire crashes through him, destroying all other thoughts. Oh, this is easy, far easier than he could ever have imagined with this man he once loathed.
The werewolf and a few other Death Eaters were assigned to aid Draco, much to their deepest displeasure.
Harry doesn’t reply, and continues rubbing at his neck. He knows what Zabini means: the abrupt pain that spears him through his chest, his skin crawling with the certainty that this is wrong, so very wrong, and he must go and leave this dangerous man. His heart is palpitating in his chest, his eyes watering. The sensation subsides after a while, and he glares at Zabini.
The rest of the restaurant was pretty much kept the same, including the large industrial kitchen Goyle led Harry to. He gestured for Harry to take a seat at the scarred wood-topped island and began fixing tea. Harry hadn’t heard Goyle talk much in school, but he was now learning that when Goyle was nervous, he talked.
‘Oh, no, I hardly waited at all! It is a small matter.’
He ruffles the top of Harry’s mop, adding: ‘You certainly have your mother’s brains.’
for once. He took a deep breath, seeing Zabini’s stone-cold expression and Goyle’s uncertainty.
When Potter finally dipped his eyes down and took a draught from his glass, the tension in the air dissipated. There was a feeling of a significant decision being made.
Draco stood, staring after him, and wished Potter hadn’t said anything after all.
! He wouldn’t listen to us and see what happens? Of
“Right,” Potter said, sitting down at the table. “I figure we should set some ground rules first.”
“It wasn’t always
This is not how he has imagined their reunion.
Bingley is reluctant to take his leave, looking about wistfully, but Darcy dryly reminds him of an appointment they must keep in Meryton, and chivvies his friend along. Malfoy draws Harry aside as Mrs. Bennet and Lydia walk the other two gentlemen to the front door.
Also, Potter

Draco lies broken in the dirt, his wings crumpled beneath him. There is a bone-deep ache that shivers in his wings, that he feels to the tips of his feathers. He thinks dully that he must move—but where is he going? It is dark around him now, the forest exchanging the flurry of the day for the stealth of the night. This is the third time he watches this change from the ground—or is the fourth? He has lost count.
It was grinding work, seeking out people who might be able to attest to Malfoy’s innocence and structuring his petition to the Wizengamot. His friends had asked him repeatedly why he was doing this for a man who is nothing to him. He often replied that he merely did not wish to witness injustice. When he were more truthful to those close to him, he admitted that it was also galling to see how far Malfoy, his erstwhile rival, an individual who once met him blow for blow, had fallen.
him. It didn’t take long before Draco climaxed: it was a heady mixture of Potter’s gaze, the skin memory of Potter’s lips and hands, the perfunctory sounds of Hogwarts in the late afternoon echoing down the stairwell. This was illicit;
Draco strode past dusty, dead shops. He didn’t hesitate before pushing open the door of Borgin and Burkes. The bell tinkled above his head and Borgin, who was peering down at a display case of precious stones, looked up. He blanched when he saw Draco.
‘Nosebleed,’ Draco says with great nonchalance. ‘I’m fine now. The bleeding’s stopped.’ Blood trickles down his spine. ‘Don’t worry.’ He rises from the bench, forcing Potter back onto his feet as well. ‘Come on. I still need to get that drink and I
“What, Harry?” Draco said teasingly. “Harry, Harry, Harry, Har-“

newsroom.
Moony or Dumbledore hadn’t said they could sense omegas. Harry twists his sheets in his hands, wondering how else he might have accidentally revealed himself. But it is true that Draco is ridiculously powerful. He does magic differently from the rest of them, to Harry’s fascination and Hermione’s consternation: he often disparages the directions in spell books, using his magic in ways they cannot even imagine, to work the same effect. He has a wand, but leaves it in his satchel most of the time.
‘Draco,’ Zabini said and Harry would always hold a grudge against him for that.
It turned out there was more Draco could learn about pain.
An underfed owl landed in front of Draco, a water-stained letter clamped in its dull yellow beak. Draco blinked, trying to focus his sleep-deprived vision. The owl dropped the letter on the table, hooting angrily. Goyle tossed it a bit of bacon and appeased, the owl winged away.
—’ Draco chokes out.
Dumbledore merely blinks those clear blue eyes at him, and gestures to the Floo powder bag. ‘Shall we?’
Malfoy chuckles. ‘
Time freezes for a heartbeat – long enough for Harry to take in Draco’s dishevelled robes and muddied boots, his hand tightly fisted around his wand, and his rapid breathing. The moment breaks, and Draco is surging forward, eyes glittering like mirror shards. He exclaims, ‘
‘Ernie too,’ Draco chuckles. ‘But I didn’t think this was possible. Not with

‘Why?’ Harry asked blankly. ‘Wasn’t I just a baby?’

Potter smiles uncertainly. ‘It’s all right really, you don’t have to stay. It’s not like – well, we don’t any time alone just the two of us, have we?’
‘Yeah, if she can look at my face without wanting to punch it,’ Draco said drolly. ‘My turn, Potter. What do you do in Dumbledore’s office for so many hours?’
‘No, I’m glad I could help,’ he replies.
,’ Potter’s voice rang out, ‘
Potter sobered, leaning in close to examine Draco’s face. ‘You do look very ill, Malfoy. Have you been sleeping more than three hours now?’
‘I hope it’s a myth unicorns can only be approached by virgins,’ Draco says with a smirk. ‘Because you might just be out of a job tomorrow.’
Draco caught Weasley looking in a little before lunch, his freckled face screwed up in suspicion. Draco called out: ‘Want a Chocolate Frog, Weasley? Don’t worry, I won’t charge you for it – I know you can’t afford it.’
Narcissa and Lucius are barely listening. They are cooing over their new little boy. Adopting a Veela child was not their first choice—even if Lucius’ grandfather was himself an adopted Veela baby—and they took this path only after trying for years and years for a child to no avail.
‘No … not yet …’
“Well, he knew you had Veela ancestry. The potion we used –” At this point, Healer Mitra shifted uncomfortably, but apparently decided Draco deserved full disclosure and plugged on, “ – the potion we used is based on the one You-Know-Who used to create a rudimentary body for himself.
Granger turned to positively beam at Potter, shooting him a fatuous expression that did not suit her plain squirrel face at all. Draco felt rather sick to his stomach. It seemed Weasley shared his sentiment, because he frowned unhappily at Potter.

He licks his lips, tasting the ash on them, eyes fixed on the cauldron. He has not moved from the spot he landed in. His limbs are quivering, bone-deep. He cannot move. Salazar, he has come to the final moment, and
Granger’s frown deepened. “Harry – “
Considering the noisy group playing Exploding Snap in the middle of the common room, it was fairly amazing how Malfoy managed to focus. He turned a page, shifted his position, and bent closer to his book. Harry looked back at his friends. Hermione was watching him shrewdly, while Ron looked rather resigned. Harry frowned.
He storms off, the portrait hole door swinging shut behind him. Harry stares at Neville, who shrugs and says: ‘I have to agree with him.’ He groans, hiding his face in his hands. They are playing Exploding Snap in a corner of the common room, which is noisy enough with the after-dinner crowd that nobody notices their argument. Hermione is studying in the library, and Ron is for some reason, with Lavender Brown.

soul was destroyed.’
Snape seems to detest Harry too.
Carefully, he turns Harry over, the fragile body rolling without resistance. The green eyes are still staring sightlessly into the night. Draco holds himself still, concentrating on holding himself together; taking his unanswerable rage and forging it into a sword; beating his terrible grief into submission and forming a shield. He cannot fall—not now. There is still Harry’s mission to fulfil.
Draco has been watching Harry, watching the tensed line of his neck and his arm, the fist on his lap. Harry tilts his head a little, as if he’s waiting for Draco’s answer. Recently, it seems like Harry knows they are bonded.
The tunnels are made of smooth black stone, fetid water trickling down the middle. They twist away into many different directions, dark and endless as the ancient serpent they hide. The air is cold and dead, stirred only by the frantic beating of Draco’s wings. He doesn’t need to watch where he is going: an invisible rope leads him to Harry as surely as a leash looped around his neck.
‘Oh yes, it’s the thing friends do for each other, is it?’ the other man retorts sarcastically. ‘Don’t lie to yourself, Remus, you know what I’m talking about.’
. I’ll keep you safe. I’m going to kill him for this.’
Eltanin meets Potter's gaze now. The omega is inscrutable, mouth pressed into a flat line, and all Eltanin smells is the storm, the wind scattering loose black leaves. Blood pools in the lines of his palms.
like this.’
Draco looks down at his hand, flexing his fingers. He has a feeling that Nev will be positively furious with him if he finds out what he did to Zabini, so he tells only Harry, who is struck by the realisation that Zabini is hiding his alpha status. ‘Strange. You’d think a Slytherin would be happy to prance around being alpha and powerful,’ Harry says. ‘Anyway, show me how you transformed only your hand. That’s bloody useful!’
Harry flushes, hand pausing in mid-stroke of Draco’s hair. ‘I keep forgetting how little we talk about omega physiology.’
‘Great!’ Potter breaks into a sudden grin, one of those blindingly genuine grins that cut Draco like a knife.
Outside the castle walls, an ominous booming echoes across the grounds: Voldemort’s forces are pounding on the magical ward that surrounds Hogwarts.
His words faded into the darkness, lost syllables, lost vowels, reaching out for a boy who was no longer there.
Thoughtlessly, even though Potter had pushed him away every time he tried touching him, Draco slipped his hand between their bodies and palmed Potter’s cock through his trousers. Potter’s reaction was astonishing. He tore away from Draco’s mouth, gasping, arching his back and pressing himself harder against Draco’s hand.
Draco doesn’t want to date Harry, doesn’t think about kissing him—or, Merlin forbid, mating with him—because it disgusts him. It feels like a betrayal to reduce their friendship to carnal desires and actions. He would not do it, would not corrupt the trust and affection between them with sexual desire. So, they mustn’t talk about being bonded, even if they think the other does know.
– does that mean Harry is fine with him now? He seems back to normal, scarfing his pancakes down three layers at a time and doused in maple syrup in his usual manner. Draco bites his lip, setting the tea mugs down, and takes his seat from across Harry. He starts eating his pancakes, dipping his cut-up pieces into a saucer of honey.
‘All right, all right,’ he says desperately, ‘if you will go, at least let me stay with you until the Dark Lord has been killed. Let me protect you for the time being. Let me do this one thing—please, I’m begging you. You
Not anymore.

The surprise disappeared, an ice floe disappearing into the Antarctic Sea. Lord Voldemort raised a hand, bent a long, white finger. ‘Jackson.’

The fireplace flares, as early dawn begins to steal into the common room. They perk up from their half-sleep. It is Dumbledore, blood streaked on his craggy face, beard singed in patches. He looks straight at Draco.
Hermione is staring at Harry’s body, her face blank. Slowly, she raises her head to look at Draco, and comprehension flashes bright across her face, and she cries out, staggering back. ‘
‘I’ll decide that,’ Draco retorted; no, Lord Voldemort had already decided that Draco needed some
‘How can I hate him, Luc?’ Harry wanted to know. ‘How can I when I still want him so fucking much it hurts to even breathe in a world without him?’
‘What happened?’ he demands and his eyes land on Draco’s bloodied fist. ‘You’re hurt! Who hurt you?’ He rushes in, dropping to his knees by Draco’s feet.
“I keep to my room and the kitchen, and out of the way when you have friends over. I’m quite fastidious about cleanliness so don’t worry,” Draco said, avoiding looking at Potter by studying the spice wall.
‘What?’ he asked muzzily, rubbing his eyes.
Another figure appeared in the open doorway. Snape rose to his feet, gently laying Draco’s head onto the ground. Draco watched through half-lidded eyes as Snape argued with Yaxley, who had clearly been sent to make sure Snape hadn’t made a mistake.
Harry sniggers, and something loosens on Draco’s face, his smile widening, as he peers up at Harry cautiously—and Harry cannot help but think how beautiful Draco is. Dismayed, he pushes these traitorous thoughts aside. It’s more important to decide what he must do now that someone knows his secret.
For a moment, just behind Zabini, Draco thought he saw a white trainer appear and disappear in mid-air. He frowned, puzzled. He squinted, but no, there wasn’t anything there. He must have imagined it.
, and I don’t fancy wasting the time I have with you.’
Draco worked his jaw, closing his eyes briefly. He breathed in deeply through his nose, through the pain that speared him deep in the chest.
It was like the release of the final breath as he was sinking to the bottom of a blue-black ocean. He had no more air left in his lungs and he would drown.
Harry watched him from under his eyelashes, not wanting to make it so obvious that he was looking at the man. After spending so much time with Luc over the past week, Harry saw the brilliant, razor-sharp personality hidden beneath his mild appearance. There were moments when Harry mistook him for another man and had to stop himself from reaching out.
Draco wants to look away but Potter’s eyes are impossible to turn from. They are molten and intense, heated with an emotion Draco must be imagining. It is unreal. How can Potter be saying such things?
‘Harry,’ she said calmly. ‘Come here.’
‘He killed himself,’ Draco whispers through bloodied fingers.
‘No,’ Draco admitted, involuntarily shivering at the memory of the ice-cold water.
Harry was licking stripes up the shaft to the engorged head, fondling Malfoy’s balls as he went. He slid his tongue into the slit and without warning, because Malfoy was biting down hard on his bottom lip, Malfoy was coming, his scrunched-up face falling apart in complete release and Harry understood a little of what Malfoy meant by “the way you look”. There was warm spunk all over Harry’s face, some even landing in his hair. Malfoy exhaled breathily and swore colourfully enough to make a sailor blush.
Harry reckons it is inevitable that they have come to this: Malfoy pinned beneath him, breathing rapid and harsh, Harry sweaty and trembling, rutting his hard cock against Malfoy’s thigh. They are naked, and Malfoy’s elegant braid has come undone, his blonde hair pooling beneath his head. Harry leans in, tugging on a fistful of that lovely blonde hair, and presses his throbbing lips against Malfoy’s collarbone.
And Snape completes this wretched picture: a black-robed spectre looming at the foot of the bed, face pale and bloodied, eyes cold and emotionless. He turns before Harry could decide to blame him, and strides over. He ignores the way Draco steps between them, thrusting his closed fist over the blond’s shoulder into Harry’s face.
shy. He reaches out, unable to pull his eyes away from Harry Potter’s unwavering gaze. Time stretches out: eternity long enough for Draco to breathe Harry Potter’s distinctive scent, to feel a pulse that beats like a second heart in time to his, to see that he will now always be pulled inexorably in Harry Potter’s wake.
Smirking, enjoying the looks on his friends’ faces, Draco sketched out the bare details: a German who came visiting, yes, rather good-looking, you want to know
The Boy Who Lived gives her a smile that is almost shy, and glances at Draco. ‘You’re okay with it?’
Harry stares down at the table, studying the crumbs that lay like grave dirt between them. His fists are clenched in his lap. He feels the words bubbling up within in, sour and acidic and poisonous. He must say them. He must speak the truth, and when the world’s judgement comes in the wake of his revelation, he must embrace it, for that is what he deserves.
Draco almost cums right then and there. Even the sensation of his hand unrolling the protection spell over his dick almost tips him over the edge, but not yet, not yet, not when Harry is waiting for him, wet and desperate and begging for his cock.
He leaned back in his seat, drinking his beer slowly, listening to Ron and Hermione chatter as they waited for the rest to arrive. Around them, the Hog’s Head was quiet, Aberforth somewhere in the back rooms. Harry ignored the furtive activity in the shadows. He wasn’t an Auror at the moment; just a regular bloke meeting old schoolmates for a catch-up.
Harry, standing at the back of the hot, crowded room, couldn’t hold in his snort. The witch standing in front of him looked back, but shrugged when her eyes passed over a seemingly empty patch of wall. Harry shifted carefully. It was stifling under the Invisibility Cloak, but he couldn’t risk making his presence known before he decided on what he should do.
too. He’s Malfoy’s boyfriend—could be worth something.’
He went out through the wall and left Potter behind in the stairwell.
‘Yeah. Yeah, I’ll be home. That sounds brilliant,’ Harry says. ‘I’ll be home late tonight, so I’ll see you tomorrow morning, yeah?’
Harry hesitates. ‘Where are we going?’
Draco shuddered under Harry’s careful touch, desire pulling his stomach into knots. He ached terribly with the temptation, wanting nothing more than to lean in, to press his lips against Harry’s, and see what fireworks might fly. Instead he grabbed Harry’s hand, and held it. Harry frowned a little in disappointment.

Harry’s eyes widen.
She gripped the table’s edge, staring at the wizard with bright, green eyes. ‘Albus …’ she whispered hoarsely, and stopped, shaking her head. Without another word, she swept out of the kitchen, all the glasses in the room shattering in her wake. Harry ducked, throwing his arms around his head. When the clinking stopped, he lowered his arms and stared wide-eyed at Dumbledore, who was looking after Minnie.
this.
Harry lights up. ‘Treacle tart?’
‘Maybe,’ Draco replies, a little breathless—Harry’s mouth is close enough for their breaths to mingle—and he reduces the distance between them to nothing, and presses his lips to Harry’s.
Harry will take his feelings to his grave. He will not impose them upon Draco. But he knows he hasn’t been doing a very good job of holding them back, if the worry on his godfathers’ faces is any indication. As Hermione says, this isn’t healthy for Draco or him. Harry doesn’t want to avoid his best friend because he’s a sad little virgin who can’t keep his dick under control.
Draco wouldn’t look at him. He knew that if he did, his self-control would splinter, and he would wrap his arms around Harry and beg to be touched. So Draco didn’t look at him, and silence broke whatever intimacy they had shared last night into jagged, painful pieces.
Ron and Neville give him identical looks of revulsion. ‘No, thanks!’ Ron says empathetically. ‘No offence, mate. Nothing against you, I just don’t go for blokes. And besides, didn’t I tell you? I’m seeing Lavender,’ he says to Draco.
Harry agonises over what he should do. Oh, how he wishes Lizzy or Hermione were here to advise him! Does he tell Jane that Bingley is in London? However, the knowledge is of no advantage to Jane. Shall he call upon Bingley then? He could discreetly enquire after the gentleman’s abrupt departure, but he fears that Jane might think poorly of him for sneaking behind her back. He does not want his sister to think him a traitor! After all, how does he know she
Yaxley stared at him and slowly nodded. He released Draco and Draco coughed, rubbing his neck. The burly blond waved with his wand, indicated for Draco to lead the way. The eyes of the others on his back, Draco hurried down corridors and up stairs.
He looked back at Goyle, who was watching him tremulously. ‘You live here?’
‘I—’ Harry looks around helplessly, as if a bit of Voldemort’s soul would be lying around.
Draco grins, dagger-sharp. ‘I took my other form, and ripped his heart out. He Petrified me, but it turns out your wizard spells don’t work too well on Veelas. So, it stands to reason the Dark Lord’s magic wouldn’t work that well against
He opens his eyes, reaching out to lay his hand over Draco’s on his cheek. Draco’s eyes are fervent, his face open and honest with his eagerness and vehemence.
Harry is shaking his head. ‘No, don’t be ridiculous.
‘I am embarrassed to admit that I was impolitic in my last meeting with Malfoy. I would like to make it right by him. Perhaps you might be so kind to advise me on how I might achieve it.’
Malfoy glares. ‘You forget your place, Potter. Is this how you speak to your Crown Prince? It’s nice to see you too. Let me in.’
‘Hullo,’ he said, dropping into the seat next to Goyle. ‘How were your summers?’
Neither Voldemort nor Flitwick missed a step. They were smooth and graceful and Draco, unable to look away, threw up a little in his mouth, nauseous with the crippling cramps in his stomach.
‘I know that, you git. I mean, what does that have to do with dating, since people believe you’re beta anyway?’
The world still had
Potter rose up, bracing himself against Draco’s chest. ‘If all you want from me is blowjobs, why do you look at me like that?’ The words were poison-tipped barbs lodged in Draco’s lungs. He thought he could hear his breath rattling in his hollow rib cage.
he reminds himself.
to die. I was a Horcrux—Voldemort doesn’t know—he probably does now, but that’s not important, I—I’m so sorry, Draco.’ His words are fervent, deeply meant.
His hard, aching cock nudges Harry’s, both of them dripping pre-cum, and Draco cries out, white-heat pleasure shooting through him. ‘I’m not going to last long,’ Harry whispers into Draco’s hair, grabbing his hand and guiding it between his legs, behind his balls.
‘Harry. Harry? Are you all right?’ Minnie asks gently.
‘Do you hear me, Mr Malfoy?’ Flitwick squeaked sternly.
Harry covers his tired eyes with his hand. ‘I’m going to Grimmauld Place for dinner. You go ahead.’
Harry hesitates, looking at the stairs. He hears Moony and the school nurse talking, and there is movement. He tenses, his shoulders drawing up to his ears, thinking that they are bringing Sirius down to the kitchen, but he hears them moving up the stairs instead. He exhales, glancing askance at Dumbledore, wondering if the old man sees how much of a coward Harry is being, because the very thought of seeing Sirius, bloodied and broken, makes Harry nauseous.
Draco tastes Harry’s panic, sharp and acrid, but he isn’t thinking of blame or forgiveness. What does it matter that Harry left, when he is here now? He is trembling, from the tips of his wings to his feet, his heart pounding like the drums of war, striking him to his core. Harry is alive.
They were waiting in the Formal Drawing Room, which Mother had only used once fifteen years ago to receive a visiting Italian countess. The Death Eaters stood against the panelled walls, cloaked in black robes and shadows. A single figure stood in the middle, in front of the Dark Lord sitting in a high-backed winged armchair.
‘That explains it,’ the blond smirks slightly. ‘Salazar, we won’t be sleeping in her bed, would we?’ There it is again, the twist on
‘What shall we do?’ Mother’s voice is faint, like she is whispering.
and he didn’t care about Malfoy’s reasons – not right now – and he wanted to make the fucking
At the same time Snape said, ‘
The boy Draco met at Madam Malkin’s.
Draco had ripped aside the curtains, and was trying to undo the catch. The sound of the bustling street of Muggles below was muffled by the warding spells.
‘No, it’s fine,’ Draco waves him away; it’s far more likely Neville will take his head off in this state. ‘I’m already healing. I have to go after Harry.’
It is a week later, when Harry comes home from work, marked by the scent of an unknown alpha, that Draco finally cracks.
‘Of course, mate,’ the blond says, tucking hair behind his ears and leaning in closer, a smile growing on his face. ‘I see better than anyone how stupidly heroic you can be, forever trying to help someone.’
If it weren’t his … he thought back to his fight with Potter and how Granger had tossed their things higgledy-piggledy into the respective bags. So this had to be Potter’s.
Weasley. You’re jealous of him.’
So Harry has to tell him that
The Veela jerked her head towards the door, where Potter was waiting outside of, and a conspiratorial smile spread over her face.
‘I don’t want to be dead even more,’ Draco replied and pulled away from that touch.
Zabini turned yellow under his golden-brown complexion. ‘You wouldn’t dare. Don’t you fucking dare, Malfoy.’
‘You’re an idiot,’ Draco finally says, and Harry feels Draco’s body relenting, leaning into his embrace.
‘Are you weeping for your tart of a boyfriend, Potter?’ Yaxley had screamed at him. The Death Eater was struggling against the chains that held him to the iron chair in the centre of the courtroom. The man looked utterly wretched, his matted, stringy hair hanging in his skull-like face. ‘We all know how you spread your legs for a
‘From people who presume that marriage is the sole purpose of life, I imagine.’
Draco spun around. His Heart’s Desire stood before him, wand lowered, face ashen with horror.
Draco takes a drink, considering.
She shakes her head, and shuts the door with a wave of her wand. ‘Calm down, you prat. You will only upset him further by going after him now.’
‘There was blood,’ Neville adds reverently.
One, he sees in the mirror that the woman, Sirius’ cousin, is not offended by his rudeness; in fact, she’s smiling. She’s pleased to have been even addressed by Sirius.
‘Thank you, Professor Slughorn,’ Draco said as Filch slinked off, muttering mutinously under his breath, shooting evil little glares at Slughorn and Draco.
It’s a good thing he has taken the trouble to learn how to transform at will. With a few powerful down-strokes of his white wings, the top of his head is level with the windowsill. He grunts, catching onto the very edge of the sill with his claws. He brings himself close to the cold, rough stones, digging his claws in.
him,’ Snape hissed. ‘Fucking Potter,
He ignored the knowing looks his friends shot him. Zabini was frowning and Parkinson had to drag him away. For some reason, he was very protective over Luc.
Harry leaned forward, closing the gap. His forehead pressed against his, their noses brushing. Harry’s hand cupped his cheek, thumb stroking his cheekbone. It was a lightning bolt of disbelief, an unravelling of fear. The gentle touch reached into Draco’s chest, touched something deep within him, and wrenched at his heart.
Slightly more bearable: spiralling out, down his arms and legs, scratches he inflicted on himself in his sleep, trying to get at the constant
about it. Apparently, that Healer of yours told him it might have something to do with how you’re always making moony eyes at Harry all the time. Oh, come on, you do. The way you two look at each other – it’s like the rest of us might as well fuck off.
‘How many months has it been?’ Potter demanded, releasing him. ‘How did he … how did he give it to you?’
‘No, it’s clear that you must stay here,’ Dumbledore interjected before Sirius or Moony could say anything. ‘Any information you can give us about the Dark Lord would be useful—if you do wish to join the Order.’
‘Yeah …’ Draco said. ‘You didn’t need to keep a lookout past twelve you know. It’s only going to be more suspicious if people saw Zabini lurking out here.’
He stared at her, dumbfounded, and then reached over to pat her hand. ‘I’m all right, Mione. I’ll be fine without Ron. He’s always coming over for dinner anyway.’
. You are stronger than any of them could have imagined—what you have endured and survived is greater than any of what those indolent creatures know.’
They parted for the space of a breath and Potter dragged him in again, glasses skewed, eyes wild and unseeing. He pressed Draco down onto the desks, table edges digging into Draco’s back, but any discomfort was worth it because Harry Potter was
The worst thing that could happen would be that Harry thinking the bond is the only reason he wanted to be friends with Draco in the first place. He asked Harry before years ago: ‘I was quite rude’ —ignoring Harry’s derisive snort— ‘why did you even … offer?’ Harry looked puzzled, and said with a shrug: ‘Well, I didn’t want you as an enemy. Thought I had better get you on my side,’ and he grinned.
He senses Harry immediately: rage howling and clawing, pinpricks of pain where Harry has been cut. They are in a graveyard—that is the only thing Draco makes out before he leaps into the air, releasing Dumbledore and McGonagall. ‘Draco!’ McGonagall shouts, but he is already winging through the darkness to the glow at the other end.
‘Do you wish you
‘Well, I thought I would find you at Hogwarts, where they told me you live now. Only when I arrived by a very circuitous Floo route, Longbottom told me you are on a hike in the Forbidden Forest – for research, he said it was.’
, you are against us, do you hear me? We will not hesitate to kill you if we should meet in the future.’
They strode out, the door slamming shut behind them. Draco could feel Potter’s eyes boring into his back as they went. Mother took Draco’s arm, pulling him close to her. They walked down the crowded street, looking purposeful and self-important.
The space between his shoulder blades itches, the ache in his bones now the yearning of wings to be set free.
. I was—I told myself I wouldn’t die like this. I—I did what I had to do to escape.’
Draco rolled his eyes, suppressing his grin. ‘Yeah, yeah. I suppose I do have you to thank for distracting Slughorn so I can steal the potions.’
‘Yes.’
Draco gapes up at him.
‘I’m not smirking,’ Harry replies mildly, pursing his lips; he must have smiled unconsciously, thinking that Malfoy looks rather lovely really, with his eyes sparking with anger and his cheeks flushed.
Draco opens his mouth, his chest flooding with warmth, but whatever he might have said—
Moony and I might get you a little reward?’
Draco couldn’t get the words out, his mouth too raw and painful. He couldn’t be sure he even remembered how to talk. He managed a low grunting, the chains clinking as he moved with greater agitation.
Draco couldn’t talk, making only distressed noises like a bird in a trap, and Harry stroked his beak and murmured reassurances, as Draco’s eyes fixed on him. He cannot remember what he said, but it worked, because with an effort, Draco shifted back into his human form, far too thin and pale. He still wouldn’t speak, but he allowed Harry and the house elves to take him to the bathroom, clinging to Harry’s hand as the elves bathed him. Harry watched the water dark and murky swirl down the drain for almost an hour before it ran clear again.
There was deep still silence.
Potter is staring at the neat rows of tomato plants, arms crossed over his chest. "Yes, what was left of them, after we burned the palace down."
‘This is the memorial,’ Minnie says softly, gesturing to the House point hourglasses.
!’ The others snigger. Harry grins to see Ron and Hermione getting along better than ever. He reckons that Ginny is right: it’s easier when the two of them have decided that they would only ever be friends, and see other people. Hermione has been going out with Fred for nearly a year.
‘Kingsley
Harry gave a low, rumbling laugh. “Well, I figured the only way I can get you to open up to me is if
in vogue at the moment, Draco thinks he would rather not be friends with their sort. He tells his parents as much.
about Harry.
Harry shakes his head, and tries again; the distinction is important to make. ‘But we aren’t boyfriends or lovers or whatever. It’s only—because we were apart for so long. It’s only because we’re soulmates.’
His best friend is silent for a while, his body trembling in Harry’s hold. He looks up, slowly, torturously. His silvery eyes are wet and shining with tears, and when he reaches to grab Harry’s arms, his hands burn against Harry’s skin.
Whenever their eyes met, Potter would blanch and hastily turn away, looking as if Draco was a Hungarian Horntail. It was clear his behaviour bewildered his friends; Weasley would glare accusingly at Draco, at which Draco would give him his best
“Ron and Hermione will be coming over in a bit. Ron and I have to run over some standard procedures with you, arrange the schedule for who’s guarding you during work and all … They’re staying for dinner. Would you like to join us?” Potter sounded excruciatingly awkward, as if he could not imagine anything worse.
I’m different – but you keep on calling me
‘Really?’ the prat mocked. ‘Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, are you?’
Draco is mostly relieved to see Harry behaving normally. Harry has been tensed around him for the past few days, a sudden hard light in his eyes, lips pursed. The emotions that thrum across their bond are too ambiguous for him to make out more than vague anxiety. Draco worried at first that it might have been something his parents said, or something in the manor: something that might be horrible to a person who didn’t grow up in a bigoted pureblood family.
doesn’t come to him.
Halfway through their journey, they are joined by a Muggle-born first-year with bushy brown hair and an overbearing bossy demeanour. She is dragging two boys – an apologetic-looking plump boy and a bewildered redhead – with her, saying that they are looking for Neville’s – the plump boy’s – lost toad. Draco is inclined to ignore her, but Potter is absurdly kind.
are you bothering when it’s obvious you don’t even like me enough to tell anyone about us?’
Draco swallows past the lump in his throat and pulls off his robes, the slithering of cloth absurdly loud in the graveyard. He holds it out to Potter. The boy stares at the bundled cloth for a few seconds before reaching out for it. His fingertips – ice-cold and wet – brush the back of Draco’s hand, and Draco is stumbling back before he realises it, his skin crawling with revulsion.
‘I am afraid not. My mother does not like house elves,’ the dark man replies. ‘She has everything working by magic at home – quite a fascinating set-up, but my mother is creative with her magic, as you can imagine. But – house elves – it so happens that thanks to my
The moments stretch out between them: the space of a breath, or the length of a universe’s rebirth.
“I was thinking … I don’t particularly feel like cooking tonight. I’m thinking of heading over to visit my godson.”
The older man is surprised. ‘Ah, you don’t know what it means. Well, that is fine. I am Mathis, and you will be coming with me. This is quite enough of acting the child. What are you thinking, throwing a tantrum like this!’
Draco nods, unable to tear any more attention away from Harry groaning in his arms. Snape is crouched over them, the tip of his wand pressed against Harry’s temple, murmuring spells under his breath. Behind them, Hermione is sniffling.
An hour for homework and then he would have to sneak out to the Room of Hidden Things. Another night with the Cabinet – not that he could sleep, knowing that he had the Cabinet to work on.
The prophecy of Harry and Voldemort is an open secret now. ‘But this works in our bleeding favour!’ Moody exclaims. ‘The boy has the power to defeat the Dark Lord—power the Dark Lord knows not—we only need to clear the way for him to do it.’
‘Since you know that I’m a Veela, you should also know that it’s only my Allure working on you. You don’t really want me.’
The other Death Eaters were watching Draco avidly for a response to Yaxley’s taunt. From the corner of his eye, he saw his mother shake her head slightly. He ignored her and closed his book. He shifted his position, facing Yaxley. Everybody in the room stiffened, feeling the change in the tension.
‘Apparently, I’m supposed to listen to it underwater. Cedric says that the Prefects’ bathroom has a bath, and he’s given me the password to get in,’ Harry explains. ‘Anyway, I’m not planning on going to the Ball. Think I might not be up to it on Sunday.’
When Sirius and Moony heard about his invite, they insisted Harry bring Draco along the week he is staying with them. ‘They’d try to be nice, do you think?’ Harry asked Minnie anxiously. She pursed her lips and told him she’d write them a letter. But that is next week; now, he is walking through the woods to a place Draco calls his secret hideout.
‘How terrifying. You win, Potter,’ Luc smirked.
He had to go to the Prefects’ Bathroom now since Potter would have had heard. No matter: it would be easier to wash away the blood in a bathroom after all and Draco swore silently that there
‘No, I reckon not,’ Harry said. ‘We aren’t on the same teams in the first place, you know.’
Malfoy may sort Slytherin, as his godfathers say, and Harry needn’t see much of the other boy, because he will surely be Gryffindor. But they will still be in the same year and in the same classes. If school is going to be as smooth-sailing as he is determined for it to be, he will need to confront Malfoy before that unfounded dislike of his gets worse.
had kissed him first, hadn’t he? Rage – hot and charging like a bull – swept through Draco. If Harry had not fucking kissed him, Draco would not have caved. Draco would have maintained his control, and resisted kissing this man he so dearly wanted.
“Don’t I get an apology?” Potter asked, those forest-green eyes fixed determinedly on his. “You haven’t thanked me for saving you all those times either!”
Harry melts into the kiss, his body pliant and eager, as Draco wraps his arms around him, pressing him backwards into the cushions. Their lips move against each other with pleasurable friction, Draco biting down gently on Harry’s bottom lip. Harry gasps, mouth falling open, and Draco groans into the heat as their tongues meet. He pushes his hand beneath Harry’s T-shirt, the skin warm beneath his palm. Harry arches his back upwards, pressing his body closer.
back?’
Draco’s chest was deep and hollow. He clenched his fists, drawing the blanket up his waist. ‘The Dark Lord gave me to you?’
But Draco does not see himself from the outside: his shoulders bowed under the weight of wings he does not want; his face ashen and eyes dull; his embrace around Harry tight to the point of choking. Harry wants desperately to think this is okay, this is fine—
