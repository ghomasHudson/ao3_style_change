“I wasn’t lurking,” Nick mutters under his breath as he walks back to his own desk. “Another time, then,” he mouths at Draco over his shoulder.
The second he stepped out of the Headmistress’ fireplace, his eyes fell to Dumbledore’s portrait. It was empty, for which Draco was eternally grateful. One awkward conversation was more than enough.
Draco doesn’t answer and averts his eyes, in fear of Potter noticing he just had a moment of weakness.
Potter’s fingers were tentative as they rubbed him. He heard Potter mumble something else before he suddenly felt a rush of magic shoot through him. Ah, right, cleansing and protection. He gasped and closed his eyes when Potter applied more pressure, sending a powerful tingle up his spine as he circled Draco’s rim.
“I didn’t do anything,” Harry says, furrowing his brows. It’s the truth. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have—Oh no.
Harry blinks, his mind foggy and disoriented. Shit. Why couldn’t the dream have lasted a little longer? Now, he’s utterly confused, kind of embarrassed and horny. Great. He screws up his eyes and tries to summon the image of Malfoy smiling at him. Why didn’t he say anything? Why did he just smile? Is that a good thing?
Shit, what is the knucklehead dreaming? It—It sounds—Well, he could also be in pain. It sure feels like torture to Draco. Especially when his legs are suddenly tangled with Potter’s and his stomach is tied in knots as Potter has the audacity to keep moaning right into his ear.
“Because,” Potter yells, throwing his hands in the air. “I didn’t know what I was agreeing to! And I wouldn’t have—” He pauses, his face suddenly unreadable. “Did I hurt you?”
“But I was pretty sure you wouldn’t believe me if I just told you. So…” Screwing his eyes shut, as though that makes it any less embarrassing, he starts swinging his hips from side to side.
Sod the damn card, Draco wants to say. But he stays still and closes his eyes, enduring the blissful torture of having Potter’s tongue pressed against his lips. The bastard even starts teasing him, flicking his tongue at the corner of Draco’s mouth and tracing the line of his upper lip. Merlin, this is unbearable.
Draco studied him closely as his face twisted into something unreadable. He seemed to be considering something. When he finally spoke again, his tone was a lot gloomier.
It was a good thing Draco wasn’t paying attention to Harry right now. His hands were shaking so bad, he almost dropped his wand. Apparently, having the same revelation twice didn’t keep him from being completely overwhelmed. It was weird. He was just watching Draco clean the sofa. And yet, it put everything into perspective. Because if this was what his life with Draco would be like, Harry wanted it.
When Harry opened his eyes, he saw Malfoy was staring at him. He looked flushed and ruffled. He had never seen him more handsome. Harry pressed himself closer to Malfoy, even though there wasn’t any room left between them.
“No, that’s not it,” Harry says. “It’s, um—The, err, dynamics of our friendship changed a little, that’s all.”
“What?” Harry exclaims. “Who doesn’t like chocolate ice cream? You’re weird. Okay, err… is it… butter pecan?” One tap.
Potter looks up, his brows furrowed and his mouth set in strange line. “Why are you so eager to set me up with someone?”
He can barely concentrate on his essay, being hyper aware of the way Malfoy breathes in and out, in and out, and how his right leg twitches every now and then. The urge to put his hand on Malfoy’s leg and tell him to calm the fuck down is so strong, Harry almost gives in. It takes everything in him to keep his eyes on his parchment, to defy this very strange invisible force that pulls him towards the boy sitting next to him.
Feeling much bolder and encouraged, he put a hand on Potter’s chest and leaned closer, until their noses were touching.
“You’re such a git!” He kisses Draco’s hair, pulling him close. “But you’re my git and that’s just one of the things I love about you.”
Harry stares at her, feeling like someone slapped him across the face. He suspected Hermione knew, but having it laid out like that…
“I already have a few candidates lined up for his position, but—” She gave him a piercing look. “—it has come to my attention that you have become quite the expert in this particular field.”
Draco’s insides boil at the thought that he’s nothing more to Potter than some interchangeable bimbo. Honestly, he should have been the one to destroy the Owlery. Draco’s virginity doesn’t concern Potter. It only concerns Draco. It was his decision what to do with it.
Draco knits his brows together. “I don’t know. I—” Suddenly, a thought flashes through his mind. A horrible thought. “Shit!”
Draco let out a sigh. “I’m not obliged to keep them updated about my virginal status, Potter. Besides, I really don’t care about what my father has to say anymore.”
wants to bite Potter’s lip. “Okay, hold still,” Potter says quietly and reaches out to cup Draco’s cheeks.
“Is this about last night?” Draco asks. The look on Potter’s face is so intense, it makes Draco’s head spin. “It is, isn’t it? You were acting weird.”
“Now,” Draco said, shooting Teddy a stern glance, “care to tell me how in Merlin’s name this,” he pointed at the koala, “ended up in your room?”
It must still be nighttime, or at least very early in the morning. And Harry has to go to the bathroom.
He had asked himself what could have happened a lot since then. Maybe he was stupid for thinking that, about to make a fool of himself, but Harry was tired of wondering ‘what if’ and questioning everything.
“Oh, sorry, I’m squashing you, aren’t I?” Potter said. He propped himself up on his elbows, then on his hands, in an attempt to lift himself up.
“Nick told me he saw you talking to Robards,” Draco says. “You don’t need to explain anything. I knew you’d ask for a new partner sooner or later.”
“Okay, just… try not to talk about your sex life, okay?” He slowly removed his hand from Ron’s mouth, watching him carefully.
Intending to let his arm fall to his side and step away, he lets go of the soft fabric, but his fingers sweep over something that makes him frown. It’s not fabric, it’s skin. Someone’s chest. But it feels… strange. Unthinkingly, he lets his fingertips follow the bumps he feels. Long lines, raised and uneven. His frown deepens, and he quickly withdraws his hand. For a moment, he forgot he was touching an actual person. A person who is standing perfectly still, probably feeling extremely uncomfortable after being groped by Harry.
Harry waits, stock-still, not daring to breathe. His eyes dart down when he sees Draco moving his hands to his trousers. It takes him a second to register Draco is undoing them.
“We— I mean, we can never be together… officially,” he says quietly. “I can’t— The way I—” He lets out a shuddering breath. “I can’t be— I can’t be with another wizard. It’s not—”
“Actually…” Potter hesitated, shoving his hands into his coat pockets. “I’m— I’m not feeling so good.”
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco said, irritated. This whole bloody situation was so conflicting. On the one hand, Draco liked having Potter around, especially having him to himself. But on the other, that was exactly what would undoubtedly get him into trouble. What would happen when Potter was finally ready to leave? Would he go back to his old life? Would he go back to resenting Draco?
“Shocking,” Harry laughs, clapping Ron on the shoulder. “Come on, let’s see if Hermione already finished her homework for the entire year.”
“Oh!” Draco shudders as Potter sucks and licks. He only realises he’s still wearing his cloak when Potter opens the clasp and it slides down to the floor. His fingers move to work on the buttons of Draco’s uniform, taking their time with each one, until it joins the cloak by his feet. His shirt is next and Draco’s heart jumps every time Potter’s fingers graze his skin. He never would have thought someone else unbuttoning his shirt could be this sensual.
“What?” Potter snaps, and it makes Draco halt. He looks him in the eye, not liking what he’s seeing there.
“Who told me my past doesn’t define me? Who told me I could be more than what everybody expects me to be? Were those just empty words?”
Draco let out a contented sigh. Who would have thought having Harry Potter as a flatmate would have such benefits?
Draco snorts at his babbling and takes a quick peek at Potter’s crotch. It’s hard to tell, but he thinks there might be a little bulge. Huh. He’ll have to try harder next time. But it seems he succeeded at least a little. Potter grabs the firewhisky and pours it into his glass quite frantically.
Harry chuckled when Draco mumbled, “Sentimental,” under his breath. They made their way into the kitchen where they were greeted with a bunch of balloons and confetti.
He had sworn to himself it would never happen again. Never again would he give in to temptation. But all it required was Potter’s soft gaze, the vulnerability in his voice, for Draco to snap. Thank Merlin he had come to his senses before it had gotten completely out of hand. He’s not to be trusted around Potter. But that won’t be a problem much longer now, will it?
“Who’s a good Niffler! Yes, you’re a good Niffler,” Harry croons at her and gives her another piece of pumpkin. He looks back at Malfoy, who is frowning at the note.
“Okay,” he murmurs, and feels Malfoy relaxing against him. This is so bloody confusing. Why would Malfoy want this? Why would he want to hold Harry?
Tom showed them to a table and, as soon as they placed their orders with him, a torturous silence stretched between them.
“I’m not sure if I do on this one, but I guess you can’t be stopped, so…” She squeezes his hand, before she lets go of him. “Be safe,” she hisses in his ear.
“Is that what you’ve been doing?” Draco asks, raising an eyebrow. “Maybe you’ve cut him too much slack.”
“Just stay quiet and come with us,” Pansy said. “If you resist, I swear, Draco, I’ll put a Body-Bind Curse on you!”
Harry doesn’t even have to ask what she’s talking about. He looks down, his stomach twisting at the sight of the Grand Staircase basically being transformed into one gigantic lavender field.
The Niffler blinks and tentatively sniffs the air as though it’s trying to catch Harry’s scent to determine if he’s friend or foe.
“Fuck!” Draco grabs one of Potter’s thighs, dizziness crashing down on him. His fingers instinctively find the buttons of Potter’s trousers to release his cock. Draco pushes down his pants impatiently and sucks the tip into his mouth.
“I thought we had something,” he whispered. “I—I thought—” His mind was screaming at him to stop, to not make himself more vulnerable. But what else did he have to lose? “Maybe I should have been more open about my feelings,” he murmured. He pulled back and tipped Potter’s head back, forcing him to look at him. “We could have found a way. Together. We could have—I mean, I didn’t really know what we were doing, but… you didn’t even give us a chance. Do I really mean nothing to you?” He stared into Potter’s empty eyes, panic and trepidation coiling in the pit of his stomach. “You selfish bastard.” He buried his face in Potter’s fur, his resolution not to break down sobbing crumbling more and more.
Draco studies him, drinking in Potter’s handsome face and his soft expression. Even before Draco really got to know him he was attracted to Potter. He never would have admitted it back then, but there was also no denying it. Getting to know this other side of Potter, one he never knew existed when they were in school, was completely overwhelming. Draco has never met anyone with so much warmth and passion in them. How could Draco not fall for him? He really never had a fighting chance. And as frustrating as being in love with Potter is, Draco wouldn’t want it any other way. There’s nobody else out there for him. It’s simply out of the question.
“It’s about Potter,” Draco begins. “And I’d appreciate it if this conversation stayed between the two of us.”
“Excellent,” Seamus said, clapping his hands. “Now we just have to decide who you’re going to turn into.”
“That’s my bed,” Malfoy says in an uncharacteristically abashed tone and points at the bed by the window.
“I probably shouldn’t have said anything,” he murmured and swiftly walked up to him. “I don’t want you to think about what those sick bastards did to you. Ever.”
He takes another deep breath and immediately wishes he hadn’t. The full force of Potter’s scent hits his nostrils and, inexplicably, it makes his stomach jump. Not in an unpleasant way. Draco jerks, startled by the traitorous behaviour of his own body.
He watches Draco, day after day, making his way to the Room of Requirement, carrying a bag. It drives Harry mad. He knows he can’t get in there, while Draco is in the room, so he waits after Draco has slipped out again. Harry stares at the wall and concentrates hard.
He remembered his surprise when Blaise had hugged him for the first time, when Pansy had held his hand for no apparent reason at all. It had taken some getting used to. He still wasn’t completely comfortable with it sometimes. He had a hard time reciprocating. But it wasn’t like that with the koala. With Baxter, it was easy. He didn’t need to wonder about some ulterior motive with the koala. It simply wanted to be held, feel Draco’s warmth, he supposed.
“What, you enjoyed that?” Two taps. “Clearly, you’re insane,” Harry says in a teasing tone. “Shouldn’t really surprise me, though. I mean, you went with Pansy Parkinson. That tells me enough about your taste. Oh, Merlin, please don’t tell me you kissed her at the end of the night? You did, didn’t you? Ugh, it must have been dreadful! Honestly, how could you—”
Harry’s mind reels as he finally realises it’s Malfoy’s collection he discovered in the Room of Requirement. But why is he getting rid of it?
Sirius just smiles. Potter turns around and nods at Draco. His fingers shake as he drops the stone back into his pocket. The moment it leaves Draco’s palm, Sirius’ figure vanishes.
Draco wanted to roll his eyes, tell Potter to bugger off, but… he knew what Potter meant and if he was being honest, the offer was rather intriguing. But could he really risk it? There was a reason he had mostly avoided Potter all those years.
There was just something about this animal that made Draco’s chest feel warm. He brushed his finger against its forehead, smiling when it opened its mouth as though it was chuckling. Shaking his head, Draco briefly touched his nose to the koala’s.
As it turns out, holding Ron’s hand only makes matters worse. Much worse. Harry feels extremely stupid when he blindly reaches for Ron’s hand, instead of letting his friend grab his arm, as he guides him to the showers the next day. Ron seems startled at first, but doesn’t comment on it as they walk down the corridor. This definitely feels… different, Harry decides after a while. Ron’s hand is too warm and too big. It doesn’t fit quite as nicely as… the other hand. And, to Harry’s disappointment, it doesn’t make his heart skip a beat and the fluttery feeling in his chest fails to appear as well.
When he finally arrives on the seventh floor, he takes a deep breath. He has tried this many times before. This might turn out to be another failed attempt, but he has to try. He starts pacing back and forth in front of the blank wall he has visited so many times, concentrating hard.
A few days later, Harry gets his answer. He’s under his invisibility cloak again, following Malfoy and Zabini. They’re chatting about something Pansy did yesterday. Apparently, it was rather scandalous. Harry’s heart stops, when Zabini suddenly says,
“What are you talking about?” he manages to say, shaking his head. Dumbledore doesn’t answer at first, not until Draco’s eyes find his.
If only Draco knew! But even if Harry decided to tell him, he wouldn’t even know where to begin. Just thinking about it made him so nervous, he felt like throwing up. Oh, wait, maybe that wasn’t nervousness… Yeah, it definitely wasn’t nervousness.
Draco can feel panic bubbling up inside him. This is it, this is his chance, a perfect opportunity to confess his feelings. Potter is practically presenting him with everything he needs on a silver platter.
“Sometimes I wonder how you’re still alive,” Draco sighs, “if your first instinct is to throw yourself in front of others.” He gives him a sidelong glance. “You did it in the potions smugglers’ house as well.”
“Oh!” He definitely remembers that. “But then… don’t you think Ron is right? Don’t you think it’s possible he vanished his hearing and… my eyesight?”
“Go on,” Draco said, leaning forward and nudging his plate closer to him. Potter’s eyes immediately darted… where? Oh. Draco cleared his throat and rearranged his dressing gown, covering his exposed collarbone. “You’re making me nervous, sitting there without eating anything.” Well, at least half of that sentence was true.
Much like in his dream, Malfoy pins him down and kisses him like Harry is the air he needs to breathe. He can definitely relate. It feels like his body
“I don’t think I’ll ever get used to that,” he continues after a moment. “Seeing him, I mean. It’s so strange. It’s like, when he’s angry, I get angry. And when he tortures or kills someone…” Harry’s voice breaks, but he pushes himself to keep going. “I can feel what he feels. And in these moments, he feels… gleeful.” A shiver runs down Harry’s spine and from the way Malfoy is squeezing his hand, it didn’t go unnoticed. “I just can’t imagine how someone can feel like that while they’re— It makes me sick.”
Draco tries to swallow his disappointment at Potter’s tone; he sounds like it’s the most ludicrous idea.
“So…” He exhales loudly. “I’ve had sex with them, but they never—I never—” Potter bites his lip again as his eyes find Draco’s.
“I—I don’t—” He breaks off when Malfoy yanks at the bracelet, but instead of tearing, like normal flowers would, the bracelet doesn’t budge.
Draco snorts. This is getting utterly ridiculous. He startles when Potter lets out a grunt and his head drops to the side. Draco unconsciously leans forward. It’s still not what he meant to say, but Potter does have a rather appealing jawline. And, he supposes, his mouth isn’t that unpleasant to look at either. And—
“There’s no point in delaying it.” Potter jumps out of his seat and before Draco knows it, he’s out the door.
He feels Harry kiss the tip of his nose and can’t help but grin. He pulls Harry back into a tight embrace and relishes the feeling of Harry’s body shaking against his, as Harry laughs out loud.
Draco feels sick. His stomach gives another twist, but Draco refuses to show weakness. He will not be sick. No. He hears, rather than feels, his jaw cracking as he tenses his muscles further. His arms are shaking now. Unthinkingly, he turns to the wall and punches it. Hard. He feels no pain, but there’s another cracking sound.
They stare at each other, the air almost crackling around them. Without thinking too much about it, Harry reaches out and gently puts his hand on Malfoy’s cheek. Only mere seconds later, Malfoy’s eyes widen. And then he hiccups.
Draco braces himself, draws his wand and tries to ignore the pounding of his heart. He concentrates on the scrunching of the snow beneath his shoes, until they’re so deep in the Forest, the ground is barely covered with it. He narrows his eyes, trying to adjust to the darkness. One would almost think it’s nighttime.
Harry looked between Malfoy and Hermione, not understanding what she was telling him. It must have shown on his face. Hermione sighed and shook her head.
Harry hadn’t been sure if it was strange that he didn’t feel the urge to get back together with her. He wasn’t sure if that was due to everything he had gone through or if it was something else. Because he did feel something else. Something he had been feeling for a while but hadn’t been able to put his finger on. Maybe he even had been deluding himself, not wanting to admit his own feelings.
“I did find it. And now I need your help.” He lowers his voice, suspecting Malfoy is trying to listen in. “I need permission to go to the Restricted Section.”
“But you did it anyway, you let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts and you let Snape kill Dumbledore!” He grabs his wand and jumps off the bed. “I see Voldemort rewarded you for your success,” he growls, pointing his wand at Draco’s cheek. “Did he send you here? Is that it? Are you here to kill me in my sleep?”
At the pumpkin patch, Potter reaches into his little bag, rummaging with a frown on his face, until he produces something bright orange.
“I’m sorry, but can I please see them now? Madam Pomfrey hasn’t allowed anybody in yet. But please, Professor, I—”
Harry cocks his head, his eyes flicking from title to title until he spots something that makes him pause. He quickly grabs the book and flicks through it.
The way Potter was staring at the ground and fumbling with his scarf was unnerving. Draco could tell he wanted to say something else.
“So… last night…” Draco began, already feeling foolish. But he had to know. “Did you kiss me because… you felt sorry for me?”
He turned on his side, hugging his knees close to his torso. Why, why did it have to be like this? Why wouldn’t the universe stop torturing him? He knew he didn’t deserve happiness. But did he really deserve to suffer like this?
“On the contrary. I’m just saying it doesn’t have to be perfect. It will be perfect for him no matter what.”
But, now that he thinks about it, he hasn’t seen Parkinson by Malfoy’s side for a while, nor Crabbe or Goyle. Malfoy usually takes a seat beside that Zabini guy in classes these days and doesn’t engage in any conversation at meal-time. Harry sensed something had been off, but this… this is a whole new revelation. Because… maybe that’s why he talked to Myrtle.
“Oh, well, if you insist.” He watches Potter closely as he unbuttons his shirt, revelling in the fact that Potter is unable to look at him. “Done. Your turn.”
It’s something Seamus hadn’t shut up about for weeks, making Neville blush so hard, Harry thought he was going to implode. To be fair, Seamus described it in such graphic detail, Harry shifted uncomfortably in his bed, unable to make eye contact with any of the other Gryffindors. Aside from wondering who Seamus had shared this ‘fucking brilliant’ experience with, it had piqued Harry’s interest. And, even though he imagined himself being on the receiving end of this, he feels a new wave of desire washing over him at the thought of doing it to Malfoy.
“Potter,” he barked. “I don’t know how to get it into your thick head that I don’t want to talk. About anything. I don’t even know what you’re doing here. You have plenty people to talk to, so why do you insist on pestering me?” His eyes wandered about the room as if he were looking for something. “Where is the rest of your little trio anyway?”
“Do you—Do you want to see?” Malfoy asks, and Harry thinks he’s never seen anything more charming than the blush on his cheeks.
“Try one,” Celia said, her blonde curls bouncing around her shoulders as she grabbed a cupcake and practically shoved it in his face.
Granger’s mouth falls open and from the looks of it, her eyeballs are about to fall out of their sockets. “How—How—”
With a jolt, Harry realises that it is. “It’s usually not,” he says hastily. He doesn’t know why he feels such a strong urge to point that out, as though he needs to defend himself.
The way they interacted with each other now was so comfortable and sweet (minus the occasional fighting), Draco was genuinely happy with how things were. It almost felt like they were a couple. A couple nobody knew about…
what he had in mind. It doesn’t matter anyway. The way Malfoy is holding his hand right now is nothing like that. It feels… almost tender and reassuring.
“Are you okay?” Potter asks. “How do you feel?” He lies down on his stomach, beside Draco, and reaches out to brush some of Draco’s hair out of his face.
As if on cue, Harry suddenly finds himself outside the castle, in the glistening sunlight. Heart thudding in his chest, he listens to his own voice.
“No.” Determinedly, Draco pushed back the duvet and moved to make room for Potter. “Now get in here. And promise me you won’t turn into a koala.”
“I understand you perfectly,” Draco snaps and moves to step around Potter. He scowls when Potter reaches out and holds him in place.
He sat down on the bed, facing Potter, but before he could say anything, Potter let out a dreadful gasp, his eyes fixed on Draco’s chest.
“Malfoy, what’s going on?” Potter glowers at him over the dividing wall, his palms planted on his desk.
“Can’t see?” Ron sounds dumbstruck. “But he can hear? Do you think it has something to do with that blue light?”
“Well, I wish I could say the same,” Draco scoffed, trying to at least gain back some of his dignity. His eyes widened when Potter leaned forward.
“First of all, they’re not creepy,” Harry said. “And second, Celia loves them. You know that. That’s why they’re here in the first place. Stop hurting their feelings.”
Well, the room isn’t as tiny as Draco feared. But the beds are. Those aren’t the four-poster beds he remembers. They’re plain and narrow. Well, at least there are two of them. And a fireplace.
“Are you feeling okay?” she asks, her hand hovering over Potter’s shoulder as though she wants to comfort him, but is too afraid to touch him.
All of Draco’s suspicions melted away when Potter’s face twisted in shock. He had never been very good at hiding his feelings. Years of watching him, even from afar, had at least taught Draco that much.
“It started out with a few tests,” Draco shrugs. “Similar to what they did when I was on trial. Only this time, it was off the record.”
“Oh fuck!” Draco squeezed his eyes shut as he slowly pushed his cock inside. He paused halfway through, his head swimming. “Are you okay?” he asked, shooting Potter a worried look.
Draco tries to tune him out, pouring himself a second glass. His cheeks already feel pleasantly warm, although he’s not sure if that’s from the fire or the wine.
Someone’s walking past him, leaving the common room. It’s him. His muscles clench. He shouldn’t go after him. He doesn’t even know what to say. But it’s like an invisible force is pulling him out of his chair.
Malfoy’s fingers are still on his neck, Harry realises, as they slowly stroke his skin, and then, Malfoy finally presses his lips on Harry’s.
“I can’t believe you,” Draco muttered darkly. “You said it was safe. You even said it would be fun!”
“What happened?” Harry asks and immediately flinches. It feels like someone shoved nails down his throat.
Countless times he had taken a look at the Daily Prophet, only for Potter to stare at him from the front page. Draco always scowled back, sometimes he even stuck out his tongue at the picture. But now… It really wasn’t the same, seeing Potter in person. The most significant difference was, he always looked displeased in those pictures. Now, he looked… not shocked but… almost startled. Why, though?
“Please, forgive my bluntness. I seem to forget my manners with old age,” Dumbledore sighs, getting out of his seat. He walks over to one of the windows with his hands crossed behind his back.
Tentatively, and still a little dazed, Draco moves his free hand up to Harry’s face. His eyes follow the movement of his fingers as he slowly taps the corner of Harry’s mouth twice.
It seemed so long ago that he had been a guest to events like this himself, and had actually enjoyed himself. All these rich and pompous people were so incredibly boring and irritating, he couldn’t wait for this night to be over. All he wanted was their money, and he often wondered if they even cared what he was doing with it. So, yes, inviting Potter was smart, because it meant more money. The fact that Draco could watch him from afar was merely a pleasant side effect. But he had to be careful. It couldn’t be anything more than that.
.” Potter tried to keep a straight face, but couldn’t suppress a snicker. “I might even let you touch my
“I didn’t plan for this to happen,” Potter says. “It just did. And maybe I do find comfort in it. Is that so wrong?”
The second Potter is out of sight, the other Aurors begin to murmur. Draco can’t exactly blame them. That was weird. The worst part is though, from what he can gather, his colleagues are apparently under the impression this is
that he was gone. He had caused Draco and his mother so much misery. But it had instantly been mingled with regret, remorse and sadness. He hadn’t realised he still felt that way. He never talked about his father anymore.
“Yeah. Since we’re partners and everything,” Potter says absentmindedly, and his tone a little annoyed.
“Why do you care where I sit?” he challenges, trying to ignore the fact that basically the whole class is staring at them. Of course it’s weird for everybody else that he’s sitting next to Draco. He should have expected this kind of reaction. He holds Parkinson’s stare and leans back in his seat. “Just go back to your own seat, Parkinson. If Draco doesn’t want me here, he can tell me himself.”
“Times have changed,” Malfoy shrugs, as though this isn’t a big deal. Wow, he really is different, isn’t he?
Harry wakes with a jolt. Loud voices and footsteps fill the hospital wing. Panicked, he feels around the bed, only to find the other side empty. His disappointment quickly fades as he realises who just entered the infirmary.
“So…” Trying to make sense of this was giving Draco a massive headache, but he was starting to feel… strange. Still no sympathy. Not exactly. But if Potter was telling the truth, this was really messed up. “We still don’t know how you turned into a koala. And why. All we know is you ended up in a zoo.”
Draco almost screams when Potter sucks him into his mouth without warning, his hands reaching up to stroke Draco’s chest. He bobs his head slowly, with relish, and the vibration of his low hum makes Draco’s stomach tie itself into knots. Without realising what he’s doing, he places his hand on Potter’s cheek while more and more heat pools in his belly. Even when Potter releases his cock and starts kissing his abdomen, Draco is filled with so much want, he thinks he’s going to explode. He momentarily freezes when he feels one of Potter’s fingers moving to his cleft.
“Ugh. Fine!” Harry yanks his jumper over his head and gets to work on his trousers. He’s technically only obliged to show Malfoy his backside, but he figures he’d look pretty ridiculous with his arse bare and his jumper still on. He turns around and pushes the remaining clothes down.
he gets his voice back. Maybe he won’t. That wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world. But that would mean Harry won’t be able to open his eyes either, so… Ugh. He should have just stayed inside today.
He didn’t lie. He really doesn’t have anything against gay people. And yet, the thought of Malfoy getting it on with some random bloke makes Harry want to spew. Merlin, that’s… homophobic, isn’t it? He’s being homophobic.
“Yes, about that.” Dumbledore sounds unusually stern. “Severus, do you know what happened in that bathroom?”
For the umpteenth time, Harry wonders why he’s even trying. Clearly, Malfoy is a lost cause. But there’s just something that bothers Harry about this whole situation. He can’t quite put his finger on it, but he just knows he won’t be able to let it go.
Now Draco really wants to throw something at him. But he knows that would only get him into trouble. So instead, he takes his Charms textbook, opens it at random and starts ripping out page after page.
Potter playfully nudged Draco’s nose with his own and then, to Draco’s surprise, he slowly traced Draco’s bottom lip with his tongue.
As much as Draco would love to ignore him, he can’t deny he’s dying to know what the hell is going on with Potter. Maybe he could…
While Harry can’t disagree, he’s getting really tired of hearing those words. He knows he fucked up. Big time. He’s glad Hermione isn’t here or he’d never hear the end of it.
“Thanks. I guess getting your stomach pumped will do that to you. Although this was better than the Muggle way, I suppose.”
“Come here,” Potter whispered and brought their lips together. The kiss was sweet and unrushed. Part of Draco relished it, lost himself in it; but there was still this tiny flicker of doubt in the back of his head, reminding him that Potter had evaded the question and it would probably blow up in Draco’s face sooner or later.
Harry lets his head fall back onto the blanket and starts smiling like an idiot when he feels the weight of Draco’s head on his chest.
“Harry,” Draco said quietly. Potter stilled. His eyes finally focused on Draco. “Come here.” He stretched out his hand. “Please.”
Instead of answering, Draco grabbed his face and gently pulled him up into a kiss. He made a gurgling sound when Potter moaned into his mouth and pressed their hips together. Fuck, if Potter kept moving like that, the fun really would be over before it had even started!
“Who are you?” Good. His voice was low, threatening. He readied himself for the man in the shower to turn around, to attack him, but he didn’t give any indication he had even heard Draco.
Harry flinches at Draco’s outburst. He almost steps back when he leans forward, pointing a finger at him.
“I shouldn’t have done that. And I shouldn’t have— What I did to you… I think about it every day. And I want you to know I’m sor—” Before Harry can finish, there’s a finger on his lips. He inhales sharply and shakes his head.
Potter’s grin didn’t fade at Draco’s insults, but he waved a dismissive hand in the air. “That’s alright,” he said. “Even though that’s the most entertaining thing anyone has said to me all night.”
“Yeah,” Blaise grinned. “Oh and good thinking on the Jelly-Legs Jinx,” he added, bumping Pansy’s hip with his own.
Draco furrows his brows, concentrating hard on the person he wants to summon. He has no idea if it will work. That person isn’t technically his loved one, but he’s hoping their kinship will be enough.
“I mean if you are, that’s… whatever. Although I would prefer you didn’t turn my flat into a brothel.”
“Of course not,” Draco grumbles. He crosses his arms in front of his chest defensively. “What does it mean?”
Draco feels Potter’s legs jerk beneath his arse. He startles when Potter’s warm come oozes down his fingers. He finds himself unable to move; it’s like his hand is frozen on Potter’s cock. It takes another few moments until Potter has caught his breath while Draco just stares at his own hand like an idiot. He only realises Potter has grabbed his wand when he’s pointing it at his own cock.
Harry’s becoming wary, the persistent feeling of dread nagging away at him. Every time the door to the hospital wing squeaks open, he holds his breath.
To make matters worse, the flower incidents seem to be increasing. The Gryffindor table being covered in colourful petals is a daily occurrence now, as well as Harry’s potions being ruined. McGonagall even raises a sceptical eyebrow when everything he tries to transfigure ends up as a different bouquet.
For a tiny fraction of a second, Malfoy looks shocked. But then he snorts, tightening his grip on Harry’s scarf.
Harry tries to resist clearing his throat; Malfoy looks far too smug as it is. He doesn’t want him to give any more leverage.
Draco quickens the pace, pulling and squeezing feverishly, while soaking up all the delicious sounds falling from Potter’s lips like a sponge. He aches to touch himself, to jam his free hand down his own trousers, but he must stay concentrated on Potter.
Snickering, they made their way to the Slytherin common room, planning to wait for Draco and getting him to spill every juicy detail about his little rendezvous with Potter in the Hospital Wing.
“After I learned what Dumbledore’s plan had been all along,” Potter says quietly, “I started to reevaluate… my whole life basically. And the longer I thought about it, the more I felt like none of the decisions I made were mine. Not even becoming an Auror.”
The effect is instant. His skin is still stinging, his pyjamas still feel like sandpaper, but it’s much more bearable than it was before.
“Ugh!” Potter slams his hand against the wall, right next to Draco’s face; it takes everything in Draco not to flinch.
“I really thought you were dead,” he chokes. Draco stays completely rigid, but he notices that Potter’s arms are trembling. That might just be from the awkward angle though. Potter’s beard is scratchy against his cheek, and yet, the sensation causes warmth to unfurl in his chest.
“Draco, come here,” she calls out, and Harry stops breathing. Will Draco know it’s him? Will he betray Harry for the sake of his family?
“Oh!” He almost collapses when he feels, not Potter’s cock, but his tongue pressing against him. More embarrassment rushes through him. Potter can’t—It’s his tongue!
Feeling himself panicking, he shuts the book and jumps to his feet. And Dean thought this would help? This is… No, it can’t be. He’ll find a way to fight this.
Before he can let out a frustrated sigh, Potter suddenly convulses beside him. Draco’s eyes widen as he starts screaming at the top of his lungs. It sounds like the screams he had to listen to at the Manor. What is happening?
“Thanks for telling us,” Potter says, clapping a hand on Connor‘s shoulder. “We‘ll do our best to find her.”
Draco could practically feel all the blood draining from his face as the impossible, and yet somehow compelling, indications clicked together in his mind.
Potter visibly relaxed and resumed stroking Draco’s hair. “I guess I was a koala for too long,” he said pensively.
Draco sniggers. When Potter’s lips stretch into a huge grin, he wonders who just played who. But it doesn’t matter. If this is what his future looks like, he’ll take it. Gladly.
“Because you’re the one Blaise was asking me about,” Harry blurted. Fuck! He screwed up his eyes, not wanting to see Malfoy gloating at him.
The Fiendfyre. That had been the most confusing thing. Of course he couldn’t have let Malfoy die in there. Of course. But he had felt so desperate to save him, his chest aching at the thought of not gripping his hand in time.
Well, there’s still one last thing Draco hasn’t tried. It’s what he’s been avoiding all this time. His last resort, so to say. Honesty. The thought alone makes him shudder. Being open and honest about anything, let alone his feelings, isn’t exactly something that comes naturally to him. But he’s willing to try. For Potter. Ugh, he’s getting soppy already.
Malfoy seems a little less surprised when Harry shows up in the library the next day. And after a week of studying next to each other in silence, Harry even gets the impression Malfoy is less tense and guarded. As a matter of fact, Harry catches him glimpsing at his parchment several times, quietly huffing at whatever seems to be displeasing him, until he suddenly reaches over with an exasperated grunt.
He has been such a fool. How could he have thought that things could be different? How could he have let himself be deluded like that? That mark represents everything Potter hates. That mark is the reason this can never happen.
“You still don’t get it,” Draco says in a condescending tone. “That doesn’t change anything! I’m not the person you made up in your head! I have my beliefs and you have yours. End of story.”
Harry pulls out the coin he always keeps in his pocket and activates it. He holds it for days, even sleeping with the coin in his hand, waiting for an answer.
“Our tent,” he announces. He taps the bundle with his wand and it unfolds itself. Ironically, it looks like a deformed pumpkin.
His gaze inadvertently flicks over to Malfoy’s arched back. Merlin’s fucking beard. Well, at least he’s not naked. Yet. Harry can’t help but stare at him as he rubs his body against the pole, his lips stretched into a smug grin. He knows exactly how alluring he is.
Harry briefly closes his eyes, trying to calm his raging pulse before he musters up the courage to look down. Sure enough, there’s a circle of bright yellow flowers around him. Huh. So they’re different every time?
“Oh god,” Potter groans. “What have I done? What have I done?” Upon hearing those words, Draco’s fingers dig even deeper into Potter’s skin. Is the prat actually feeling sorry now?
“Because I didn’t know what else to do,” Draco shouts. “You didn’t want anything to do with me, you chose those bloody Weasleys over and over again, you—you—”
“Fuck!” His eyes snap open while his hands automatically move to grab Potter’s hips. He stares into green eyes, feeling like he’s being lured into a deep forest with no hope of ever finding his way out. It’s fine. He doesn’t want to anyway.
Making arrangements for their New Year’s Eve party had momentarily distracted him. Well, except for that one time when he was supposed to hang up the string of lights and had a full-on meltdown. It was so pathetic. What was wrong with him? He wasn’t some bloody coward! But he had no experience with these kinds of things and it was definitely out of his comfort zone.
It takes several minutes until Harry is breathing normally again, his mind reeling. They just did it again. Is that a good thing or not? Also, he almost said Malfoy’s name.
“Maybe I don’t want an out,” Harry says stubbornly. “I want you.” He narrows his eyes and Draco shivers at being scrutinised like that. “After everything I saw in the Pensieve, I thought—” Harry presses his lips together, as if he’s trying to keep himself from saying something he’ll regret. “If you’re doing this because you think you have to protect me—”
But now, as Draco stands in front of him, Harry is smiling at him fondly. Merlin, Draco just never tires of that smile. Even after all these years.
“I hate you,” Draco yelled. Fuming, he grabbed the shower head once more, took a step back and pointed it at the koala. It continued making horrible noises, covering its eyes with its paws and turning its back on Draco.
True. It was true. Still, Draco felt like he was hiding a dirty little secret. Which, technically, he was.
“Petrificus Totalus,” Draco shouts and the wizard who tried to sneak out through the back door falls to the ground.
“I don’t act like it’s a punishment,” he murmurs after a moment. He ignores Draco’s snort. “It’s just… It gives me too much time to think.”
Draco gives him a look like an irritated cat after someone tried to play with it. Potter simply sniggers.
It feels like Potter just slapped him across the face. Yes, he could have told Dumbledore that his precious protégé is showing alarming signs of being world-worn. He probably should have. It wouldn’t be the worst thing for Potter to get help, and yet Draco suspects that Potter’s stubbornness would get in the way.
“Well, I guess they can’t be blamed,” Draco shrugs. “They’re Muggles. They didn’t know they were trading in an excellent education for a barely tolerable one.”
Longbottom? Yes, Draco talked to him from time to time and even met up with him occasionally. He was one of his best suppliers when it came to potions ingredients. But… he recommended him to McGonagall? Really?
“Not much,” he said evenly, keeping his face impassive. “Just… living my life, I guess.” He picked up the wine the bartender had left for him and took a sip.
“If anyone’s going to kill you, it’s me,” Potter growls. “I still can’t believe you didn’t tell me—” He averts his eyes, his face twisting in pain. And then, he gets out of his seat.
Several moments passed until Potter crossed his arms in front of him, covering his stomach. Draco’s eyes darted up to his face. He had never seen Potter look so nervous. His eyes widened when Draco smiled at him and stroked his arm.
“What happened, Harry?” Granger asks, slightly pulling back. “McGonagall said you were injured, but she didn’t tell us what happened.”
“Don’t even think about it,” Draco said, grabbing his hand. Potter gave him an odd look; his eyes were pleading, but there was a tiny smile forming on his lips.
“Wait,” he murmurs, in spite of himself. He hesitates, feeling stupid. He knows what he’s about to ask is foolish and dumb. But everything is so confusing right now. He feels so vulnerable, which makes this all the more scary.
“May I say,” Dumbledore smiles as the teachers close the door behind them, “that it is a nice surprise to see you here, Draco.”
Draco pressed his lips together, feeling caught. He knew he holed himself up in the Manor far more than was probably healthy. But he liked it that way. Well, if he was being honest, it was also because going outside still felt strange and overwhelming sometimes. People still gave him condescending looks and whispered behind his back.
He deliberates faking a coughing fit. Maybe that will make Malfoy go back to his bed. But then… he’ll be back in his bed, Harry will be in his, and he’ll be right back to where he started. He exhales loudly, plucking up all his courage. He isn’t a Gryffindor for nothing.
Even when they’re fighting and they’re both in a bad mood, they briefly forget about it when it’s 3:50 on a Friday. Like right now. They had an argument last night about Harry getting a motorcycle. Draco just doesn’t get why Harry would want to spend that much money on something that will probably kill him. They both fell asleep with a scowl on their face and they didn’t talk while eating breakfast. Harry left the house while Draco was reading the paper.
“Ugh, I hope not! I have no idea,” Potter groaned and hid his face in the crook of Draco’s neck. His face emerged again with a scowl when Draco burst out laughing, his entire body shaking.
“I—I just—” He hesitates, averting his eyes. He can’t possibly tell Potter how anxious he’s feeling right now, how his chest tightens with every breath and the only thing that’s going to calm him down is diving into the stories his mother used to read to him as a child.
“Oh!” Draco tried to hold still. This was bloody embarrassing. If he wasn’t careful, he would come any second.
Draco insisted on getting the tab and after they stepped outside, he stared at Potter’s outstretched hand.
“Oh, Hermione,” Harry interjects, remembering his earlier conversation with Dumbledore. “Ask him what spell he used!”
“No,” Harry retorts. Somehow, it sounds more like a question than a statement. He clears his throat, hoping to sound more dignified as he says, “At least I’m not incapable of showing my feelings.”
“Ooooh,” he said, and suddenly took several steps forward. Draco backed away, but startled when his back suddenly hit a wall.
“You think you can buy me?” Draco shouted. “You think you can just shove your money at me and all will be forgiven and forgotten? I’m not some dirty whore!”
“Still, there’s no need for lack of table manners,” Draco said cooly. “We’re not playing until I’m done.”
“Good. Not for the last time tonight.” Malfoy smirks, tugs at Harry’s hair and rolls his hips once more. “We’re going to have so much fun, Auror Potter.”
“Come on, you must be hungry,” Madam Pomfrey says. “Here’s some porridge. You shouldn’t take these potions on an empty stomach."
He jumped, his head whipping up so fast he suddenly felt dizzy. And… confused. Was he… seeing things? Was he just imagining Potter standing in the doorway? Or… was he actually going crazy?
“Bloody hell, I heard you’ve been starting fights lately for no apparent reason,” Potter squeezes out while Draco still tries to get him off him. “What is the matter with you?”
“He needs to wake up, so I can give him these potions. Miss Granger, I think you should go back to your dorm and rest. No, Miss Granger, there’s nothing you can do at the moment. Come back tomorrow after classes.”
“Draco,” he breathed against his neck, and suddenly, his hands were everywhere. Draco squirmed and gasped as his entire body started to tingle, kicking his senses into overdrive. Potter’s touch was scorching, his scent was overwhelming and the way he kept grinding his hips against Draco’s arse was just downright obscene.
“There’s no other way.” Potter leans forward, until their foreheads are touching. “Look, I don’t—I know this is going to sound stupid, but… the thought of coming back to you is—it’s—”
“Oh god,” he groans, and his voice doesn’t sound like his own at all. “What have I done? What have I done?”
His mind keeps debating this, going back and forth, until he finally drifts off, unconsciously pressing himself closer to the body behind him.
A few days later, Draco notices the door to the attic is ajar. Frowning, he moves to close it, when his gaze falls onto his painting. His frown deepens as he remembers his desperation in sixth year and how the Room of Requirement had seemed to understand it and had provided Draco with something he could express his feelings with. The dark green and black streaks still make him feel hollow inside. He never finished the painting. The bottom right-hand corner is still untouched. Only… now there’s something there. Draco moves closer and his eyes widen as he sees Harry’s scrawly handwriting, gleaming in scarlet. He needs a second to collect himself. When he goes back downstairs, he finds Harry in the kitchen, making dinner. Draco steps up behind him, wraps his arms around his waist and buries his face in Harry’s hair. Harry leans back against him and makes a pleased sound. Draco inhales deeply and then murmurs,
Teddy’s face fell. He looked down at the koala and tentatively petted its head. “I know you like me,” he murmured, stubbornly. “I like you, too.”
Draco grunted as he fumbled with the collar of his dress shirt. His face was contorted in distaste as he felt little beads of sweat running down his neck. Ugh, disgusting! Potter had already pointed out that it was far too hot outside to be wearing a dress shirt, but Draco refused to wear the kind of sordid clothes Potter seemed to love so much. It suited
“Is that a complaint?” Draco said in a challenging tone. Harry wouldn’t have needed to see his face to know there was a smirk on his lips.
That’s what Potter told him many years ago. It took a long time until Draco was finally able to believe him. Becoming friends with him wasn’t exactly a walk in the park, but before Draco knew it, Potter had become one of the most important people in his life.
“Don’t go, yet,” Harry murmured against Draco’s chest. “Can’t we stay like this a little longer?” Draco found himself unable to answer, which, apparently, wasn’t that big of a problem. Harry seemed to take his silence as a ‘yes’ and sighed contentedly into Draco’s chest. Okay, as shocked as he was, this was definitely something Draco could live with.
“Please, make yourself at home,” Draco muttered sarcastically as the bags started to unpack themselves.
“That’s why this is so hard to figure out,” Hermione continues. “I brought back more books from the library, but I’m making so little progress. I already told McGonagall what I found. I hope the teachers know more about this. ”
“Oh.” Draco shifts uncomfortably. If he remembers correctly, aunt Bellatrix was the one who killed him. He was her cousin. And his mother’s cousin. Draco didn’t know him. At all.
It wasn’t the first time he had dreamed about Potter. But never had it felt so real. Never had it been this devastating to wake up, to realise it had only been a dream. His cock seemed to agree. Apparently, there would be no need to take care of it.
Draco quietly snorted as he and his mother resumed their breakfast in silence. His head whipped up, however, when he heard something over by one of the windows. Had Baxter escaped his room? His panic quickly subsided when he spotted an owl outside. He walked over and opened the window. He didn’t recognise the owl, but he took the letter that was tied to the owl’s foot and watched as it swiftly took off again.
Potter didn’t respond immediately. He bit his lip and put his hand over Draco’s on his face. “I— I know what I want. At least, um—”
“What do you think you’re doing?” he snapped, slapping Harry’s hand away and smoothing down his robes.
For a moment, there’s this tiny flicker of hope in him, that he hasn’t actually said that out loud. Why,
Draco gasped for air when his face was finally fur-free again. He turned his head to find the koala nestled against Teddy’s torso, shooting him a dirty look.
Draco gulped. Who was this? Who had broken into his house? And who would break into a house and use someone else’s shower? Was this a homeless person? Was he dangerous?
Harry groans inwardly. He can’t believe he actually wants to hear what Malfoy has to say. This is so ridiculous. Even when they’re being completely civil with each other, they can’t have a normal conversation. But as the tapping on his hand continues, an idea takes form in his head.
“Potter, you—” Why is he even surprised? Of course Potter has no fucking clue. The imbecile. “Goblin wine is famous for its strong effects on humans. In small doses, it can be quite pleasant. But it’s highly addictive and people tend to overdo it, which leads to this.” He gestures down his body. “That’s why it’s illegal now.”
Potter sits up and looks down at his hands. “After we left the restaurant, he pulled me into an alley and started grinding up on me.”
“Kim means seaweed and bap means rice,” Potter explains. “You can pretty much put anything you want in there.”
Dinner was a quiet affair. Potter seemed to be lost in thought, even after Draco proposed they take a walk around the garden. They didn’t speak much and mostly kept it to small talk. Potter had been especially quiet after Draco told him Teddy would be home in two days. Worry had been written all over his face. It was all Draco could think about when he went to bed. Little did he know it would keep him up for hours.
The keeper let out a breathy laugh and tentatively tried to unwrap the paws from around Teddy’s leg. “Tell me if you feel the claws,” she told him. He nodded silently, but with a very sour expression on his face. He clearly wanted the koala to stay where it was.
“It‘s on the grounds, isn‘t it? Who- or whatever is taking these children isn‘t inside the castle,” Draco murmurs.
Silently, they watched the clouds roll by, side by side, until Draco felt warm fingers on his arm. He turned his head, only to find Potter smiling at him.
“By going out with us,” Blaise said, pulling Draco out of his armchair. “Honestly, I get it. You’ve had some rough stuff going on. But Pansy is right. You broke up with Astoria for a reason, and now, it’s time to embrace it.”
His own footsteps boom inside his ears, mingling with the sound of his racing heart and the screams and laughter that keep getting louder and louder. He zooms through the Entrance Hall, his eyes barely taking in the destruction around him until he finally steps outside and finds himself amidst students, teachers and parents crying, laughing and hugging each other.
“Fuck,” Potter almost yelled. Draco did it again, pressing the flat of his tongue against Potter’s rim. But what now? Draco thought hard, until he decided to move his tongue like he did when he was eating ice cream. That couldn’t be too wrong, right? “Oh fuck, Draco!”
Harry says nothing, deciding not to correct Slughorn on his rash assumption. Why does everybody seem to think this has something to do with Harry’s feelings? It doesn’t. He still doesn’t know what triggers it, but it seems to be happening spontaneously and at random. He doesn’t even realise he’s doing anything until it’s too late to cover it up.
“This isn’t just dinner,” Harry said in awe, gazing around the candlelit room. When his eyes landed on Draco again, he noticed how tense his boyfriend was.
.” Weasley grumbles something else under his breath as he sits down opposite Draco. Potter watches him with a mixture of apprehension and sternness and seats himself at the table next to them.
He feels something ice-cold in the pit of his stomach. It spreads rapidly through his body, like poison. Breathing becomes difficult and painful.
Harry laughs in spite of himself and shakes his head. “Right, it’s only living creatures I’m supposed to take care of.”
“Are we interrupting something?” she asks, one of her eyebrows raised in sceptical disbelief. Zabini is leaning against the doorframe, his expression a mixture of feign bewilderment and amusement.
He wills himself to act normal as he walks back out and hands Malfoy his tea. They drink it in silence and Harry awkwardly accepts the treacle tart Malfoy offers him.
Not thinking about consequences, Harry runs after Malfoy, pulls off his invisibility cloak and grabs his wrist. Malfoy startles and turns around. Gasping, he lets go of his bag, the contents spilling all over the floor. Harry can’t believe his eyes when his gaze falls upon several drawings. Of him.
Harry stiffens. “He’s here? Outside?” His stomach rumbles uncomfortably, which he tries to ignore. “Is anyone with him?”
“My mother was a Muggleborn,” Harry says quietly. “I’m a Half-Blood. Does that make me filthy? Do I disgust you? Did you have to force yourself to touch or kiss me? Why did you even do it?”
He locked himself up in his lab for hours, working on his potions, trying to concentrate on the task that was awaiting him. He still wasn’t sure he was cut out to be a teacher, but if McGonagall believed in him… There really wasn’t a bigger compliment, was there?
Harry grunts and presses his fingers against his temple. Probably. Researching Nifflers is getting him nowhere. The only thing he discovered so far is that he’s definitely not as fascinated by these little creatures as this Newt Scamander bloke. But what should he look for instead? He needs a spell that would tell him the Niffler’s whereabouts, what it’s doing, when it leaves its burrow…
Having lost his appetite, Harry vanishes the scrambled eggs and tries to decide what to do next. If he goes into the living room, the noises from Malfoy’s room will only be louder. But what the hell is he supposed to do in his own room?
“I never thought you were that naive,” Draco murmurs, shaking his head. “You really think it’s that easy? That I can just decide to turn my back on him?” His eyes find Harry’s again. They’re full of terror.
“Now, black tulips usually mean power and strength,” she continues. “But in your particular case, we think it means something else.”
If Draco’s jaw keeps dropping like this, he’ll have to let Madam Pomfrey take a look at it sooner or later. What is Potter even talking about? He isn’t going anywhere.
“Fuck!” Gritting his teeth, he rushes over to examine the empty wine bottle. “I knew it. Shit. Shit!”
Usually, he can deal with these kind of things on his own, but he’s tired of it. He’s so sick of being regarded as the Chosen One, a hero, when, in reality, he can barely hold it together. He doesn’t want his friends to see this side of him. They’ll start to worry, make a big thing out of it. They’ll try to help him, probably give him lots of unsolicited advice, whereas Malfoy might just laugh in his face. But, Harry thinks, that’s probably unlikely, given how scared he seemed when he talked to Myrtle about Voldemort.
“Oh, look at that,” Draco said, gesturing to Potter’s empty hands. “You don’t have a drink. I’ll get you one.”
“Merlin, Potter,” Malfoy sniggers and wraps his arms around Harry’s neck. “You get flustered so easily. You’re an awful spy.”
From this day on, whenever Draco comes home grumpy or moody, Harry will excuse himself quickly and return with a bouquet of sunflowers, or daisies, or hydrangeas… sometimes Draco doesn’t even know the name of the flowers Harry gets him. The only thing he knows is, it warms his heart when Harry is standing in front of him, smiling almost shyly, with a big bouquet in his arms.
Harry trusts Dumbledore. With his life. If he isn’t able to figure out what’s going on, nobody will. He waits for the incantation, holds his body as still as possible. Suddenly, he feels a weird tingling sensation on his face. Dumbledore must have used a nonverbal spell. The tingling increases, and it gets uncomfortable. Harry wrinkles his nose, and just as suddenly as it came, the sensation is gone. His heart rate picks up in anticipation of what Dumbledore is going to say next.
“Whatever,” Harry interrupts him and sits down opposite of him. He gives Malfoy a speculative glance and takes a sip of coffee. “So… what, are you like… a street worker?”
“Yes.” Malfoy takes Harry’s hand and stares at it like he’s seeing it for the first time. “Because, apparently, you love me.”
“I’m not so sure, actually.” Draco’s eyes dart over Potter’s face. “Do you feel… different?” He holds his breath while Potter slowly sits up, the frown wrinkles between his brows deep and somehow foreboding.
“So we don’t know if they ran away or if they were kidnapped,” he mutters. “Is there anything else out of the ordinary you noticed over the last few months?”
The kiss turned from tender to heated within seconds. Draco bit back a moan when Potter’s hips started grinding against his. His cock was already half hard and if Potter kept moving like that, Draco was sure he’d be coming in his pants in just a few minutes.
“I’m the one who has to live with him,” Harry points out with a grin. “Besides, I haven’t seen him yet, either, remember?”
Draco could practically feel the sadness in his voice. This was the moment, he thought. This was the moment Potter had been afraid of.
“Even though it was kinda drowned out at the time, I keep remembering how I felt at the thought of coming back to you.”
It feels like everything inside him is turning into ice. He’s frozen, but he feels beads of sweat forming on his forehead. The cold hands are still steadying him, but now they’re also tentatively pressing into his skin, as if Malfoy is readying himself to shove Harry away at any second.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Alright, how about a Seekers game, then? The winner gets to see the losers arse.”
That—What the—Merlin. He’s doomed. Potter will never understand how he feels. This is hopeless. Honestly, maybe he should stop trying. Clearly, they’re not as meant to be as Draco thought. But…
He tries to find a comfortable position once his head hits the pillow, but is rudely interrupted by Potter, who lies down beside him and covers himself with one of the sleeping bags.
“Tell him: fuck off, you’re a coward and I don’t need this.” He gives Draco an expectant look, until Draco slowly nods and follows him outside.
“Whatever,” Draco grumbled and moved to grab the koala around its midriff. His mouth fell open when the koala kicked one of his hands with its foot. “Seriously?”
“How strange,” Draco murmurs. He takes a sip of tea, welcoming the warmth spreading through his chest. Potter hasn’t touched his cup yet.
“I won fair and square, Potter. I won despite a disadvantage! Or need I remind you that I was the one holding on to Penelope?”
virginity. Draco pauses. For a moment, he tries to imagine what it would be like if the roles were reversed. Would he be angry if Potter was a virgin and hadn’t told him? Well… maybe. But it’s different for him. Potter wouldn’t be disgracing his family, he wouldn’t go against his upbringing, renouncing everything his family and their name stands for. But Draco did. It’s exactly what he did and it’s hard not to feel guilty about it. He doesn’t want to. Having sex with Potter has nothing to do with his family. It has to do with Potter and him. Or, from Potter’s point of view, with Potter and anybody who’s interested.
At least until Malfoy enters the library and suddenly all of Harry’s thoughts revolve around him. Is he still angry at Harry? Is he planning something to get revenge? Shouldn’t Harry be the one still resenting him for becoming a Death Eater? Can’t they just both let go of the past and move on? Why is Malfoy always so stubborn?
Hermione almost looks apologetic, but she tries to cover it up by furrowing her brows. “I wasn’t,” she snaps. “Besides, I already apologised for that, didn’t I? That was ages ago.”
Merlin, this was too endearing. While stroking the koala’s back, Draco sat down in one of the armchairs. Closing his eyes, he pressed his cheek against the koala’s head and let out a contented sigh. Even though he was consistently chastising the koala for being so clingy, he couldn’t deny that he secretly loved it. He had always wanted a pet as a child. And no matter what his father said, those ferocious peacocks most certainly didn’t count.
“Yeah, but they taste awful, don’t they? Mum always had to force them down my throat.” Ginny laughs and Harry can’t help laughing with her. It’s nice to have an actual conversation.
“So weird,” the keeper said once more. “Alright, kid, I’m sorry, but Baxter wasn’t trained to be held by humans. He could seriously hurt you.”
“There’s nothing more you can take from me,” Draco says, raising his chin in defiance. “You’ve taken everything. My pride, my dignity,” he pauses, his heart hammering violently against his chest, “even my bloody virginity.”
Draco was just about to go downstairs when he felt the wards of the Manor warning him about an intruder. Who the fuck was coming here, unannounced, at this hour, on a Sunday? It couldn’t be Blaise or Pansy, the wards didn’t react to them.
“You’re such an idiot.” He took Potter’s face into his hands and waited until his eyes were focused on his. “This,” he softly brushed his fingers across Potter’s face, “isn’t why I’m in love with you. It’s a nice bonus, though. A very nice one.” He tapped his index finger against Potter’s temple. “
While Malfoy has his back turned to him, he peels off his trousers and pants before he steps into the shower. He makes an appreciative sound as the water washes away the sweat.
After a few moments, Draco has to relinquish his plan to keep his arm away from Potter. His shoulder is starting to protest. With repugnance coursing through him, he lets it fall back down, loathing his own body for how good the skin contact feels.
“I like it,” Potter said quietly. He had that look in his eyes again, the one he’d had the night before, right before he had kissed Draco. It would be so easy to just lean forward or grab him and pull him into a kiss… But it wouldn’t mean the same to Potter as it would to Draco. It was pretty obvious Draco was only some sort of experiment to him, probably to see if he really was into blokes. Granted, last night might have been more than that, but the only reason Potter had kissed him was out of pity. And that was the last thing Draco wanted.
Harry sighs. Even fighting with Malfoy would be better than this. Well, maybe not. But still, doing nothing—
“Hold on,” Potter wheezes. Draco releases his cock and watches him curiously as Potter fumbles around the bed table for his wand.
to be this close to Malfoy. Maybe he’s imagining it, but it seems like he feels less sore the longer they kiss and it’s like a huge weight has been lifted off his chest. It leaves Harry awestruck, along with the feeling of Malfoy’s muscles moving beneath his fingers and his now familiar taste that always seems to leave Harry wanting more.
“Um, you know I have to bring you in for questioning, right? You were selling illegal potions in here.”
Draco scowls at his relaxed face. It might not be a big deal to him—although Draco isn’t sure if he’s just saying that to lessen the embarrassment—but it sure is to Draco. He doesn’t do… things like that. It was very indiscreet and foolish. And it won’t happen again.
Malfoy slowly nods, a tiny smirk forming on his lips. “Right. Glad we cleared that up.” He turns back to the telly, completely ignorant of the thunderstorm that’s raging inside of Harry. Holy fuck. What is going on?
Draco snorted, shaking his head. Before he could change his mind, he opened the door and pulled Potter along with him. As soon as they stepped into the room, he let go of Potter’s hand and shot him a nervous glance. Potter was gazing at the ceiling with parted lips.
“This is ridiculous,” Draco mumbled while he picked the koala back up. “You have me wrapped around your little paw.” He leaned forward and briefly brushed his nose against the koala’s. He couldn’t help but chuckle when it opened its mouth and stuck out its little tongue. “You’re too cute for your own good.” He raised a disapproving eyebrow. “And you’re shamelessly using it against me.”
“I’ve had a room prepared for you near the kitchens. I’m very sorry about this, but it would be best if you could dine in there tonight. Otherwise, there’ll just be too much of a commotion.”
“Sounds good.” Harry waits for Hagrid to lead the way, but instead, he casts his eyes down to the ground, looking a bit uncomfortable.
It’s all he can think about the next day, and the day after that, and the— Well, you get the idea. There has to be a way he can show Malfoy he’s not a homophobic prick.
“Do you— Err—” He feels little beads of sweat forming on his forehead and his neck and he prays Malfoy doesn’t notice. “Is— I mean, err— Would— Um… Are— Are you asking if you can kiss me?”
Ginny considers him for a moment before she lets out a sigh. “Damn it, I wanted to yell at you for moving on so quickly, but—”
Draco leans his forehead against the Vanishing Cabinet, tasting something vile and bitter in his mouth. Tonight, it will all be over. Potter won’t want to see him again afterwards, and that, he thinks gloomily, is exactly the way things should be.
Draco purses his lips, trying to think of something. He gives Potter a lopsided grin before he pulls out his wand and points it at the grass.
“Why aren’t you with your Slytherin friends anymore? Are you avoiding them? Are they avoiding you? Are they giving you a hard time?” Harry couldn’t imagine why they would do something like that or why Draco would be the one avoiding them but he knew something was going on.
Draco blinked at him and Harry could sense a teasing remark about his cheesiness coming his way. Before Draco got the chance to open his mouth, Harry pressed their lips together, until he felt Draco relax in his arms.
