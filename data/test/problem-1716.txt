Harry wishes Malfoy wouldn’t talk about his cock while drinking through a straw. Fuck. Drunk Harry is so very
The whole thing made him feel claustrophobic. When he went to escape into the yard, Harry was crying on the back steps. Charlie hardly knew him, but he sat down anyway. "Alright?"
Laughing a little into his mouth and ruining the kiss, Harry says, "I'll figure you out eventually, you know."
Draco, with his shirt halfway down his torso, considers this. “You have that map, don’t you?” he asks.
"God, I hope not," Harry grimaces. "I don't know much about my family, honestly. I'm choosing to believe I'm less inbred than you are." He takes the map back pointedly and folds it up. "How were your holidays? I assume you stayed here?"
Draco knows the wine is by the sink. He can see it. Doesn’t stop him from bending over to search through the lower cabinets, and making enough noise that Potter has to look down at him.
into doing anything, I come here all the time. Sure you weren't hoping to run into me? Pretty good bet I'd be wherever Hermione was going."
,” Draco hisses, when Harry seats himself further — and beautiful, and if his mouth around Harry’s fingers was hot and tight and velvet, then his arse is a fucking vice laid with silk, clutching impossibly tighter.
. Just because you and Parkinson have no boundaries to speak of doesn't mean we all have. And you can't even just fucking apologise, can you?"
"Betrayal!" Ron exclaims. "Harry, what the fuck? You saw the ferret here and you didn't even tell me?"
“It’s rude to insult people while you’re groping them,” says Harry and tugs Malfoy’s jumper off next. He’s completely perfect, all pale skin and pink scars that Harry had prayed wouldn’t be there. He smoothes his thumb along one, then another. And he doesn’t know what to say, so instead he kisses him again. And this time he presses his hips against Malfoy’s, grinding his hard cock against him and dropping his hands to his hips to hold him still.
“Warming Charm,” Draco mutters. His mouth is fuzzy from the nicotine but he can still feel Potter through it, full lips that taste a little like toothpaste. “Let’s fuck here.”
Pansy lets out a laugh of disbelief that quickly loses its humour. "You aren't serious," she says. And suddenly Draco's foul temper is beginning to make more sense. "Oh ... my god, did you not finish somewhere else?"
Klaus meows again, probably meaning 'no,' and also to convey that he feels it's a shitty excuse. Following that he actually bites Harry's leg and then sprints away like a wild animal towards the kitchen. Harry's shout of "you little arsehole!" of course means nothing to him.
“That’s Sirius,” says Draco, pointing to the brightest star in the swirl above them. It’s a little dizzying, lying on the solid ground beside the fire, surrounded by the familiar scent of wine and warmth and Draco, but looking up at so much deep, dark sky. Harry pushes his knee further between Draco’s.
"Let me," Draco says, and that's when Potter bites at the soft seam of his shoulder, and he feels any semblance of control he still had over the situation he's orchestrated slip like silk through his white-knuckled fingers. "More. Touch me. Please."
if you don't finish, can it? "Also, I didn't kiss him or anything. It was so ..." he shakes his head, lets out a quiet, tired laugh, "like, afterwards, it felt like it hadn't even happened. I mean ..."
Draco watches his mother stand, the lines in her finely boned face that seem so much deeper than when he left her. “Of course I will, Mum.”
"I dunno," Harry shrugs. "It's not really a hard-hitting question, is it? You're free to piss off any time. I did originally come out here for Dumbledore's tomb."
,” and then his swollen mouth goes slack and he moans one, continuous note so anguished Harry knows he must be hitting Draco’s prostate. Harry’s hands are — where are they — hips, then cock, scant lace, the taught soft of Draco’s belly, thumbing over it, and stroking his cock again.
Feeling sick, Harry turns to make sure Lavender and Justin haven’t just heard the entire thing, and thankfully it appears as though they’d had more important things to get to than yet another Potter-Malfoy row.
“He does not love me,” Draco hisses. He regrets it immediately, the way his words make his mother flinch. He clears his throat. “I only mean to say, I am here for you and you only, Mum. I won’t tolerate him trying to get me back in his clutches.”
Seamus says, "You're welcome," and Harry looks very much like he's resisting the urge to kick him. Ron wouldn't stop him; Seamus can be a massive prick when he's high. Though he does agree with the sentiment.
With a last stroke of the hair across his forehead, she pulls out the chair beside his and Summons her tea. “Let’s talk more about your career, shall we? I’m so interested. Are you ... working closely with Granger?”
Draco shifts on the rug. His bare arse is sensitive (and doesn’t Harry know it.) Harry crawls down to prop himself between Draco’s legs. “I’m gonna suck you,” Harry tells him, taking hold of Draco’s cock once again and lazily pumping the base.
, it was average. Slightly above, perhaps. It was quite the stretch, but I'm sure that's only because there wasn't adequate lubrication available to us. In the lift."
Uncertain of what to do, he strokes the soft skin with delicate fingers. It feels right, until he realises it’s what he used to do to his pet Crup as a child. Perhaps babies and Crups aren’t all that different. It would explain how Weasley was able to take care of one.
“I think that’ll be ten points from Gryffindor,” Draco muses. He probably could’ve come up with something more cutting, but as Weasley leaves the room with a covert “bite me, ferret face”, he’s become distinctly aware that he’s now alone with Potter.
“Have you considered a career in literary analysis?” Draco says. “You know, if the whole Auror thing goes tits.”
Ron receives yet another blow to the head, which usually would have been in Harry’s opinion the height of comedy, but right now only feels like an attack on his team. He and Ron being one team, Hermione and Malfoy the other. It’s come to that, especially when Malfoy says
"How's that?" he asks. His other hand slides around to Malfoy's stomach, finding the navel ring again and pulling lightly.
He says, after a puff, “He was angry because I told Granger that it was a hate fuck, and she thought that was unhealthy, so he got in trouble. And I said that he should get fucked, or something, and then he said
"No," Draco says. "I was entirely embarrassing tonight. Blaise is right, sulking about Potter is fucking boring."
—so Harry splays one hand over the graceful dip of his spine, arcing and vaulting as he fucks himself back onto Harry’s cock, and gives it to him with graceless abandon.
Maybe it’s because he’s high, but when Malfoy calls his name ‘common’ Harry laughs. It reminds him of the Dursleys; he’s pretty sure Aunt Petunia accused him of the same thing once or twice or a hundred times.
He turns to lean against the counter, and gestures for Harry to pass Rose over to him. Says, a little gruffly, "Love you, mate. Support you whatever you do, yeah? But you don't deserve to be treated like shit, and if Malfoy's still doing that, I'll never think it's a good idea for you to get involved with him."
Harry laughs quietly through his nose, shrugging then and leaning over the rail on his elbows. There’s a joint (courtesy of Seamus) in his pocket that he decides not to take out quite yet.
Harry is absolutely gobsmacked. He stares in stupid, open-mouthed disbelief that turns into defensive anger and then quickly to helpless confusion and rather a lot of embarrassment. He blinks a lot and, absurdly, thinks back to fifth year when he and Fred — no, it had been George — had beat the shit out of Malfoy and consequently lost their Quidditch privileges.
"If you need medical assistance, I'm afraid you'll have to check in with the Welcome Witch on the ground floor. Mind, she gets a little snippy this late in the eve."
Ron knows Harry’s trying to start a conversation before he can ask about Malfoy. He’s much less subtle than he thinks he is, especially when he’s high.
Malfoy hums again. “Off the top of my head, you could drop trou for the paps. That’d pay your bills for a year or two.”
Draco’s knuckles whiten around the railing. “Ha, ha,” he says. “How convenient it must be to be able to mask all your attempts at stalking as righteous altruism.”
Draco waves a hand. "He came to Mungo's the other night. Pansy, he thought it was because he wouldn’t let us finish. On the lift.” After a moment, Draco says, “it’s not,” because he thinks Pansy should know that.
“Yes,” Harry says dully. He’s still trying not to look at Malfoy. Thankfully the witch seems to take a hint, because she lifts her eyebrows and says nothing else until she gets off on the next level.
Harry's head tips back against the wall, eyes squeezing shut as he feels the hot press of Malfoy's mouth on his cock through the thin fabric of his pants. His hand goes to his head, curling his fingers in Malfoy's prissy blond hair. "Fancy yourself good at this?" he says in a strained attempt at sarcasm.
Draco spreads his arms. “That’s me, Potter. Very nouveau riche. Pass on my apologies, will you? Only, I’ve got an engagement soon after six.”
The response takes Draco completely by surprise. He'd known that Harry would do as he said, and talk to the Ministry, and he knows that everyone there essentially worships the ground his ghastly trainers walk on. But still. He hadn't held any conscious hope that Potter would be able to help him. He's beyond help, isn't he?
Ginny rolls her eyes. She'd put her hand on his shoulder, but she knows Harry can be a little skittish when it comes to touch. "Harry, I really couldn't give less of a shit. If you wanna fuck Malfoy, go for it. Even I can admit he's far too fit for his own good. I just want you to do what you want to do, you know?"
Harry laughs. He pushes Draco onto his back, his head hitting Harry's pillow. "You're just mad 'cause you're a little turned on by it."
“We’re not,” Harry mutters. He sets his mug down, drops his head into his hands, and his voice is slightly muffled when he says, “I’m just sleeping with her.”
"Well I'm not asking you to make a case for them," Harry teases him gently. "I understand that you can't just stop loving your parents. I would give ...
“What does that mean?” Pansy asks before Blaise can even open his mouth. She’s sitting forward, properly interested. “Did something else happen?”
"Oh, fuck," says Draco. He's peripherally aware that Ron Weasley is asleep not five feet away, and that it might be fun to remind Potter of that, but he simply can't muster the words. Canting his hips up to get more, deeper, Draco lets his head drop back to the pillow and eyes fall closed.
leading, being in charge, giving orders if he needs to ... it's never felt like this, though. Especially not under these particular (sexual) circumstances.
Draco glances around them. It’s about seven on a Sunday, the staircases and sprawling landings are empty. He leans over and gives Harry a departing kiss, full on the mouth, with his hands on his jaw.
Malfoy laughs, Harry feels it in his shoulders. “You’re a wordsmith, Potter. You paint an exquisite picture.”
Rose starts wiggling again and making those little noises in his ear that he knows means she’s about to start screaming if she doesn’t get what she needs, so Harry stands with her and tries to keep her placated by stroking her hair.
in this moment, that it’s impossible not to think fleetingly of how close he’d come to death last year and juxtapose those two things. It fuels him, makes him groan as he pumps into Malfoy and tries to wrench an orgasm out of him before he comes himself.
“I’m sure he’d be flattered to hear you say that,” says Hermione. “Now, do you think you could elucidate the reason you invited me here? As much as I’m enjoying this reunion, I really do have a full schedule today.”
“Fair enough,” Harry allows grudgingly. “At least he’s not here anymore, I s’pose.” He goes over to Draco again and pulls him in by the waist, going for his neck rather than his mouth. The bruises, he thinks, are probably yellowing now underneath the Glamour and with that jealousy burning in his gut he’s glad to know they’re there. “Would it be too much to hope he was terrible at it?”
Harry has another thought when they’re closing the door behind them. “Your hair’s a box dye,” he says. “You’re really a blonde.”
He nearly tells Malfoy they should do this again some time but bites his tongue at the last second, because he can't be sure it won't come out sounding sarcastic. Instead, he leaves him with a simple "Night" that feels weirdly friendly.
“You know, Draco just spent the last couple years in France,” says Hermione as she hovers Mrs Weasley-amounts of food onto all their plates, which Harry privately thinks is a habit she’s picked up since dating Ron. And living with him. And becoming his wife.
Blaise snickers, and Draco slides from the low slung couch to the ground. This close, he can hear the steady thrum of music from the club below. “Apparate me from here,” he demands. “Tired.”
"He didn't realise," Harry says to a stranger passing them, who gives Harry a look that is both recognition (he can't go
“Obviously,” says Harry, somewhat gently. It’s funny: for the fact that he’d just been fucking him, Harry feels oddly unsure how to act now. “But we don’t really know each other, do we? I’ve got no idea what you want out of this. I hardly know what
“Why are you such a cunt?” he wonders without any real venom in his tone. He squints, though, in the direction Malfoy’s indicating and he supposes he can see some suggestion of a string of bigger stars. “So your namesake is just a
Not that Draco gives the most microscopic fuck imaginable what Potter thinks of him, but ouch, a bit. He’s spent the last few years of his life trying embarrassingly hard to secure a reputation as someone who. You know. Doesn’t duplicate people’s livers for illicit dealings.
Harry laughs and swipes a thumb along Draco’s bottom lip, wet with spit. “It’s just endearing is all,” he says. “How much you want me.”
Draco jerks his head backwards, the staircase into to dungeons he’d been heading for. Pansy says his eyes widen like a scared bunny when he panics. He keeps them at a determined squint. “Left it in my room. Not that it’s any of your business.”
—is attractive, Malfoy is here, and Malfoy is actually quite funny. In a way that would probably make Hermione anxious.
. But he's never been good at asking for what he wants. Only demanding. So instead he looks at Potter as steadily as he can, and rolls his hips against his.
"You like when I tell you what to do," he says quietly — more to himself, as a discovery. It works out nicely, since he can't think of anything he's enjoyed as much as he's enjoying bossing a horny Malfoy around. He tugs his trousers lower to rest below the swell of his (
They're only halfway through dessert when Rose starts crying from upstairs. Ron and Hermione argue for only a second over who will go check on her ("I'll do it!" Ron insists while Hermione says, "It's fine, Ron, I don't mind!" and they finally grin with pink cheeks and decide to do it together). And then they're gone, and Harry starts (angrily) hovering some of the plates into the kitchen without looking at Malfoy.
He loves this, Harry decides: the agreeable sense of control, the way Malfoy just absolutely liquefies once he’s given in. He knows he’s not going to last long so he makes every stroke count, slow and hard, tightly squeezing Malfoy’s gloriously long neck and sweating with the effort of both. “Harder?” he asks.
There's a sense of being exposed, so excruciatingly seen, that makes Draco's teeth click with a hate so intense he thinks he might scream. Nails in his palms to keep from shaking, he says, "Whatever deluded little gay crisis you're suffering, Potter, I didn't ask to be the object of it."
Harry smiles, pleasantly surprised. “Someone’s nice in the morning,” he says, and he drops his hand to Draco’s neck to thumb — excessively gently — at the bruising. It’s not
“I know Draco very well,” says Pansy. It’s a sharp turn away from any kind of subtly. “Of course, he’s gifted at what he does. He’s always been the smartest of us all.”
“Draco, you’re mad,” says Harry. “How much did this cost? Is it even legal? Fuck, this is like, fucking, ridiculously complex charmwork.”
Harry and Ginny's break up had lasted for days, and this was one of them. "Did you know I like blokes now?"
Draco lies next to Harry, who looks as if he's sleeping, with his eyes closed and dark lashes heavy on his cheeks, but is actually murmuring in Draco's ear. Dapples of moonlight fractured through water and window fall on his face, and the moss-coloured silk sheets bunched up around his torso make him look like some kind of Pre-Raphelite angel. Draco wants very much to kiss him.
“A Glamour should work alright. It’s just, actually —“ Draco holds the wand out again “— could you?”
Ron himself is sitting at the kitchen table with Hermione and Rose, and little Teddy Lupin. Teddy's on Hermione's knee, and Rose is in his arms.
"What're you riding these days?" he asks, rifling around in the shed and picking out two of Ginny's nicest training brooms.
It stings, and Draco is temporarily mum with disbelief. “Fuck this,” he mutters, and pushes his way out of the rickety, ruined door.
"Come off it," Draco snipes. "As if Pansy hasn't already repeated everything she knows. You're complete fucking twits, the pair of you."
"Pansy," she says. "It's nice to see you. I received your letter, obviously. Can I assume this is about Draco and Harry?"
Harry is Wizarding Britain’s collective son, and they may not like that he’s gay — they may have desperately wanted him to marry a carbon copy of his own mother (which is really weird, when he thinks about it) and return to that tragic little house in Godric’s Hollow and pump out a litter of Gryffindor sproglets for them to fawn over — but they’ll accept it. They’ll indulge him. Because he’s Harry Potter.
He’s explored the castle more times than he could ever count and knows his way around better than his first-year self could have ever conceived. Some shortcuts are ones he’s learned from the map, some from his own wanderings and rule-breakings, and he likes quietly moving through them with Malfoy, like they’re mates or something.
Draco clears his throat. "He rimmed me first. And don't get too bloody excited. He only had time for one go at it before the lift started moving."
There’s even a mask on the scorched ground. The inky, red-scrubbed mark on Draco’s wrist twitches when he sees it. Fuck, shit.
Awkward and messy as it is, Harry loves everything about it. Malfoy’s little sounds, the struggle of finding a good angle, the smell of sex. He trails his lips down to Malfoy’s neck and sucks lightly at the skin while he redoubles his efforts, paying attention to the faster breathing and jerking hips that tells him Malfoy’s about to come, and he’s far too eager to see it.
"Fuck," says Dean. "If Ron's gone all quiet we really must've had enough. Don't roll another one, Luna."
Unlike Potter (who had thrown off his robes without so much as a thought to what the sight of his browned, bare forearms would do to Certain People’s brain function), Draco knows exactly what he’s doing when he unbuttons his. Shrugs them off both shoulders, and stretches his arms over his head so they drop to the floor (the hideously thick lime green canvas will crinkle something awful, but it’s worth it for dramatic effect.)
He looks and Ginny and for a split second thinks he might finish his sentence, tell her that he doesn’t think he could do just a quick fuck with Malfoy. There’s something more there that he wants, but it’s quite scary to think about that.
Harry tries not to think about Malfoy looking good while he’s holding Ron’s child, since that feels somehow like a betrayal. Ron would definitely think so, anyway.
Potter’s fingers hardly brush Draco’s cheek, but it’s enough to make the Mark twitch. “No,” he says. “Private study.”
That was also the night that Harry realised he likes blokes. As it turned out, licking tequila off Blaise Zabini’s hip bone really did things for him. It was
since he's gotten off with anyone. He shifts and lifts his hips again and groans when their cocks brush. "Shit," he breathes. His other hand finds purchase on Charlie's shoulder. "Charlie, I'm not gonna last long."
"You're not evil," Harry says, rolling his eyes half-heartedly. "I was just being a prick, I didn't mean it. You're so prickly, you just — you don't let me take a breath without making it a fight. Believe me, I've seen evil and it's decidedly not you. So you can quit acting like I think you're the scum of the earth because I don't."
“Don’t be ridiculous,” says Malfoy. His cheeks are pink, but he’s looking at Harry now. “I know nothing of any book about your heroic exploits, and if I did, I wouldn’t go near it with a ten foot broomstick.”
Harry decides to ignore him. This can’t possibly take that long, it’s not as if it’s a Muggle lift running on electricity.
“You mustn’t keep these things from me, Draco,” says Blaise. He sandwiches himself on Pansy’s other side (Draco would be surprised at the sudden peace-making, if they didn’t bicker this way literally all the fucking time) and starts rubbing her arm in an attempt to warm it up. “I find it very upsetting.”
Really, it could have been worse, though. They haven't even acknowledged each other yet in the month they've been back, and frankly it's been kind of weird.
It's a less than welcome development, certainly, but Pansy forces herself not to become fraught with worry. They've been home a month — surely with time this reinfatuation with Potter will taper off. Especially if he continues being a douche.
Then he thinks of their surreal conversation a week ago up on the Astronomy Tower and all those things Malfoy had told him, and Harry decides to give him the benefit of the doubt that he’s just feeling like shit tonight and taking it out on the most convenient target.
“Mm hm,” says Draco. “I’m off.” He’s not, really, for another twenty minutes at least. But it’s either stay, and fall asleep in the middle of an Epinsky, and literally disfigure someone, or knock off a bit early. “Back at seven tomorrow. I’ll keep my pockets empty.”
Draco had been fourteen the first time Potter had intruded on a wank. At first, it was just lean musculature in Quidditch leathers. Then the sinewy frame got a face, and that face looked like Potter.
?” Harry echoes with a laugh. His brow furrows and he looks at Malfoy searchingly, trying to find something in his expression that’ll give meaning to that statement. He thinks of sixth year, of ordering Kreacher and Dobby to tail him, and grins to himself.
“Ladon,” Harry repeats, dropping Draco’s hand back to the rug and refocusing on the warm bulge in Draco’s trousers.
Harry laughs, mostly in disbelief, when Draco tugs his hand back towards his neck. He pins it to the mattress, says, “Be
George smirks. He lifts his feet obligingly but then brings them back down on Ron's lap. "What's the haps, little brother?"
"No," Harry says simply. "It wasn't. Not for me. But I guess with your life in Romania I can see how it'd feel that way for you." Which, yeah, that hurts a bit. He doesn't resent it — he knows Charlie doesn't mean it in a hurtful way —but still.
Klaus is a very different pet than Hedwig had been, and not just because he’s a cat. He’s friendly, is the thing. Warm and affectionate and follows Harry around the flat when he’s bored, purring and rubbing his ankles. Hedwig had been ... well, more like himself, really. Quite sarcastic, in her own avian way. He misses her still, but he likes to think she’d be glad he’s happier these days and not living with the Dursleys.
"No, Ron," Harry says drily, "I'm not fucking Percy. Thanks." He despises the fact that Ron has just unknowingly referenced something he and Malfoy talked about in the lift. In fact he despises this whole situation, plus the dig about fucking a bunch of Weasleys. It's been two, which is literally less than thirty percent of them. "I don't know if it's necessarily
Harry laughs, feeling somewhat delirious. There's not a single point of tension in his body that doesn't have to do with how good it feels to be fucking Malfoy, not enough space left in his overwrought brain to worry about anything other than not coming too soon. "I will," he says, sliding a hand up Malfoy's back in something like reverence, "just give me a second."
“Did I say anything?” Harry bites out. He sets a plate into the dish rack and it finally breaks, although he thinks that’s his highly reactive magic rather than the physical force he’d used. He sighs, uses his wand to clear it up, and rests his hands against the edge of the sink. He can’t turn around, because if he turns around Ron, like Malfoy, will see his (flagging,
Harry's much happier without his ex around, and so is everyone else. She really wasn't very nice, though Harry always insisted there was another side to her, and she just got a bit nervous or something around his friends. Ron and Hermione were of the private opinion that she was just a bitch, but they tried their best to be supportive.
There it is. And god, Harry has to fight not to let it show exactly how much it's getting to him. The
Hermione rolls her eyes, but as she watches Harry tuck Rose’s little plush elephant back into her chest, she’s hit with a wave of sudden guilt. Sometimes it feels like literal months since they all left school, since she and Ron got married by the little inlet on her parents property in Australia, with George as his best man, and Harry as her maid of honour. Sometimes, it feels like it's just her and him, yelling at each other across the common room, and she forgets that though they're still young, they're also kind of not.
He's found himself next to Hermione, and she's always great for a chat, always wanting to know about his work and the studies he's written on dragon welfare, which he's always surprised to hear she's actually read, so dinner is a lovely affair. By the time Molly serves the pudding, he's got his niece in his arms, Teddy's turned his hair red, and Harry's looking properly happy and a little bit drunk, with his feet up on Ron's lap.
Draco says, “It’s no trouble, Potter.” He shrugs off his coat and tosses it onto Potter’s outstretched forearms. “I find enriching the lives of the culturally inept to be incredibly rewarding. Mind the wool, will you? It’s delicate.”
"Quite," says Draco. He doesn’t bother make mention of the fact that he’s actually been home barely a month, because the demented coot will only find a way to twist it to his agenda. "A ghastly oversight on my part. I'll triage my diary. Make room for some family time in the new year."
"Our magic is being suppressed, yes? Well, you can't cast Stifling Spells in magical hospitals, for obvious reasons. Ergo — that means therefore, Potter — something else has to be doing the Stifling. And since the lift, which is powered by magic, has also stopped, we're left with the, I repeat,
Draco turns his head into the crook of his elbow. “I sort of fucked Potter,” he says, and squeezes his eyes so tightly shut that little folds of his shirt crinkle in his lids. “Just a little bit, though.”
He knows Draco’s thinking about something particular, it shows on his face, and once again Harry wishes he could just open Draco’s head up and look inside and read what’s going on. He’s about to ask again when his sarcastic-sounding little promise makes Harry laugh.
"I stopped causing strife and chaos five years ago, dickhead," he says, not without some bite behind it. He's about to rip into Malfoy further but Ron and Hermione come back, and he knows Hermione can tell by the looks on their faces that they've been fighting because she frowns at him sternly. He snatches at a napkin and wipes his hand off, resisting tossing it at Malfoy's head.
“I see,” Harry says. Because of course Lucius and Narcissa are not just racists but homophobes. It makes perfect sense. “Your mum and dad have always had interesting parenting methods.” He pauses, then says, “I think Dumbledore was bent.”
“Darling, we’ve been back home less than a month,” she says when she’s gotten control of herself. “It didn’t take you long at all, did it? Well, let’s hear it, then.” She grabs her tea again, recrosses her legs, and leans back in her chair. “Is he a terrible kisser? I’d have to assume so.”
"Blaise would just rent you out at his club to anyone willing to pay enough," Pansy says dismissively. It's what he does to
After the jarring twist, when they’re spat out a floor below the bedroom Harry was aiming for, Draco lands heavily against Harry’s chest with a winded
,” Draco says. He pushes himself off Harry’s chest and back to the foot of the bed, holding his rather surprised eye line the entire time.
Hermione lifts an eyebrow. She nearly says something about the 'client' Pansy was supposed to have been with before her, and how she'd seen no one coming out, and how that's impossible if this fireplace isn't connected to the Floo Network, but she decides to let it go.
“Fine,” he shrugs. Stressful, more like. Quite sad. Unexpectedly satisfying in other ways. “No worse than when I lived with the Dursleys, anyway. I always liked Christmas here, I almost wish I’d stayed.”
Draco pulls himself back, looking at Harry with his head pressed firmly against the wall and his pupils blown wide and heavy lidded. The corner of his flushed mouth hitches up slightly. “I do hate to be cliche,” Draco says. “But I must insist you make me.”
“I’m still angry with him,” Harry says candidly and sits down next to Malfoy. The honesty makes his stomach hurt. Until now he’s hardly admitted that to himself, always finding ways to distract himself when he starts thinking about it. “Been avoiding it, I guess.”
“I don’t want to be boyfriends,” says Draco, glaring at the little hitch in Harry’s mouth. “I just want you.”
be a bit bedraggled when he feels like it. Plus the colour has always been too close to Dudley's old Smeltings uniform for his comfort — all it needs is a cane. Right now, he would use it to beat Malfoy to death, probably.
“Ah,” says Harry. “Of course. Tell you what,” he leans down on his elbows as well, lifting a brow at Draco, “I’ll let it go for now, but you have to tell me something else about yourself.”
going on, and he loves it, the flurry of activity, but wow, it truly is utter chaos — but as everyone keeps telling him they've got a handle on it and he doesn't need to worry, he's found himself in the living room with Ginny. Which is nice, actually. It hasn't been just the two of them in a while.
Hermione nods. “Okay. Yes, good.” She supposes Harry has a point. She does have a tendency to revert back to that fretful mindset whenever she hears he’s done something reckless. It’s a hard thing to shake.
”Well. You can take the speccy git out of Gryffindor, et cetera,” he says. Weasley must’ve been scolded good and proper, because he says nothing but “ha ha,” and lets Draco pass back into the dining room. Granger is there, holding a bundle of soft blue blankets with moving stars on them.
“You’re welcome,” Harry says. “You’re awfully surprised for someone who’s spent most of their life getting whatever they wanted.”
Ron decides to indulge him, just for a bit. “Tragically I do. Both looked much too happy when they came in, didn’t they?”
"That's very kind," says Blewitt as he takes a mug out of the cabinet and fills it with steaming water from his wand, "but I really must be getting back down. I only came because you have all the good flavours up here."
"It's fine, I know no one liked her," he says sardonically. "The whole thing was fucked up. I dunno. I'm glad it happened, but. I'm glad it's over." He kicks some snow and mentally tries to prepare himself for bringing up the other thing he wants to talk about, but he can't get the words out yet. "Are you seeing anyone?" he asks instead.
In line with his recent endeavours, Draco’s been pretty transparent with Potter. Perhaps it’s a fallacy, since this whole conversation has most likely taken place in some bizarre, three-am wormhole that exists entirely separate from the reality where the two of them simply avoid each other, and smile tightly if forced to interact. However, Draco’s newfound moral strength has its limits. He’s not an idiot (unlike Fletchley, whom he’s frankly offended Potter would even ask about).
When he kisses him this time it’s not like last time, which had been full of uncertainty and anger. He’s surer now and he spends less time thinking, more time feeling. This kiss is slow and deliberate and he pays attention to the way Malfoy tastes (bitter tobacco, and something else underneath that doesn't have a name), the textures on the inside of his mouth, the little sounds he makes. Harry's voice is rough when he pulls away to say, “Let’s go inside somewhere, it’s fucking freezing.”
Harry laughs, but it's a pained, tired laugh. A little hysterical, too. "Grow up, would you?" he says. "And I didn't lick it." Why hadn't he licked it?
"So, what," she says in disbelief, "he pulled out and you went your separate fucking ways? You started, you may as well have finished!"
Draco’s sure it’s just the lack of proper lubrication that’s making him feel utterly split open by Potter’s (average sized, definitely) cock. That, and the way it’s being reamed into his spit-slicked hole.
Draco turns away from Potter, starts walking towards the water’s edge. “I know that,” he says, waving a hand over his shoulder.
A moment of silence, and then Pansy erupts into ringing peals of laughter that echo off the walls of the (spacious) office. She lets it take hold of her, deep, gut-splitting belly laughs that bring tears to her eyes and wet her cheeks. It’s highly relieving and just exactly the sort of delightful gossip she’d needed to lift her spirits.
The way Ron tells it, Harry chased his ex for a month or so before they actually got together. Perhaps that's the reason he's so resolute about it now. "Did he tell you that?"
So far he’s exhausted several possibilities — had Ron gotten his letter from the Aurors early (no), was there another secret Weasley sibling trapped in the attic of the Burrow (no, probably not.)
Charlie knows pushing it will only make Harry feel worse, so he doesn't. Instead, he says, "Before you said it was really hard to not go and see him."
In answer to the question, Harry merely shakes his head. Then he shrugs, and says, "It's complicated." He swallows. "I don't think you've ever met Draco Malfoy, have you? Lucius Malfoy's son?"
Harry watches him a second, thin and pale and apparently quite lonely. Vaguely, he wonders what tomorrow will look like when they inevitably see one another.
“Six,” Draco says, blowing past Potter’s pathetic attempt at niceties. “It’s stopped crying now, you can leave if you wish. I’m sure I can handle her for another two hours.”
Summers at Wiltshire had been perhaps the greatest joy of Draco's young life. The Manor's windows would be thrown open, with thin silk curtains that made shapes in the breeze and wide sills he could sit on while his pale skin pinked in the sun. Lucius would take him for walks in the fields of wild flowers, and turn their tissuey petals whatever colour Draco asked him to with a tip of his wand. His mum liked to sit outside with a careful array of protective charms over her smooth, porcelain complexion, embroidering under the East pergola or taking her tea down by the pond. When Draco sat with her, the house-elves would bring out jugs tinkling with ice cubes for afternoon tea, and cookies that had sweet violets pressed right into the dough. He'd lounge against the cool stones of the pavilion in the evenings, usually with Pansy by his side, until Narcissa demanded their presence at dinner or Pansy's terrifying bitch of a mother came screeching through the Floo.
Draco looks at Harry for a second, then tilts his head in a slight nod. He crawls back across the bed, lets Potter push him against the mattress and put one of his big hands on his jaw.
. Malfoy is, as Harry had accused him of before, gagging for it, and maybe it's a stupid idea for a number of reasons, and maybe he'll make a fool of himself, but he doesn't so much care anymore. Heart racing, he finds the flies of Malfoy's trousers and opens them, then slips his hand inside to find no pants underneath them. Just Malfoy's very hard cock, which Harry grips loosely and tugs. He kisses his jaw, asks, "What do you want?"
Draco can see Potter looking at him, tilting his head like some deranged Crup in his periphery. He tsks through a breath of smoke. “The Wizarding world needs their messiah, you need the comfort of a neat little life.”
Draco’s eyes fall to Potter’s hand on the crease of his shirt. His fingers, long and with a slightly crooked pinky, reach almost to the margin of Draco’s clavicle.
"Thanks," he says when a cup is set down in front of him. "There's sugar in the cupboard over the sink, can you grab it?"
"Well you've already done that so many times, it wouldn't hold much weight." Rose fidgets a bit and Harry resettles her, a soothing hand on her back and one under her bum. And, to fill an awkward silence he can't stand, he says, "How were your, er, holidays?"
He's starting to feel shagged out, utterly fucked, the way he usually feels when he's getting properly boffed, or giving a proper boffing. And Potter hasn't even touched his bare cock yet. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.
Leaning forward on his elbows, Draco says, “I’ll open up to you right now if you desist with the interrogation.”
“I don’t know. Anytime I’ve seen Lucius properly angry he’s been different. He never yells, you know. It’s fucking terrifying. But when I said that to him, he was completely incensed. I kept thinking, like, maybe he yelled because he wasn’t
Draco wishes Potter would learn at least a modicum of stealth. It's almost obscene how little effort he takes to keep every thought he's ever had from playing across his face. He says, "How empowering."
"Alright," says Hermione. "But he's still my friend. I'm not making any promises about him never being around here again, or whatever."
"M'not sensitive," Harry protests into Draco's mouth, lifting his neck a little to follow when he pulls back. "Just don't know how to read you yet."
When Potter rounds the corner, Draco feels a little twinge of satisfaction that always comes with being right. Like, he’d somehow suspected Harry might appear. And he has. Draco’s definitely not glad to see him.
Charlie wasn't his first — he'd lost it to Ginny, about a week after the end of the war. And after they'd broken up only a few months in (a drawn-out affair, but they'd survived it), he'd slept with a few random people until Charlie came home and captivated Harry completely.
When Ron found out, he said something like, "I don't give a fuck. Ginny might, though. Kind of weird."
Draco almost laughs. It’s not enough to be the Boy Who Lived, youngest Seeker in a century, the Chosen One etc, now Potter is fucking immortal, too. Childishly, it makes Draco remember why he hated him so much, and think that he still could, if he tried. He taps ash off his cigarette with more force than is probably necessary.
"Potter's over there," Pansy says when they walk into the pub, and sounds so happy about it that Draco wants to hex her. And Granger. Actually, he thinks he'd rather prefer strangling her with that bushel she calls a ponytail. It'd be more cathartic.
When Harry returns to the living room, Draco is frowning lazily up at him. “Did you spill wine on my floor?”
"Sober me," he says, making up his mind right then, because he's certain this wouldn't be happening if he weren't drunk. He could've side-stepped this whole conversation very neatly indeed, and his stupid, fuzzy brain wouldn't be making him feel things he'd rather not.
Charlie had a boyfriend in Romania. His name was Dominic, and they broke up after Charlie realised he'd rather spend time at work than the flat they shared. That was about three months before he'd gone back to England, and stayed there for two years.
"Isn't it obvious?" Draco says, and when Potter continues to look at him blankly (sweaty, and bare armed under his Auror robes, but that's entirely
Draco says, "I'm here for one night, Lucius, no longer." His father's hand is numbing where the fingertips grip at his skin, but he doesn't want to touch it to wrench it off. He presses his wand to the heel instead. "I'll do as I please."
Draco tries his hardest not to, but it’s inevitable. He always goes a bit pouty when Pansy gets sharp with him. “It’s. Do you remember when I took the Mark?” he says, as if any of them could ever forget.
“And you’re hopeless at knowing when to stop,” Hermione says (she doesn’t like to swear, unless it’s in relation to the Ministry and their ‘piss-weak stance on Elvish welfare’).
“You’re very perceptive,” says Draco. Who is wearing a thong. An actual pair of black, lacy knickers, like the kind Ginny used to wear, except impossibly
Hermione looks a little puzzled but hesitantly pleased. Ron is clearly terrified. Harry searches the pub for only two seconds before he finds Malfoy’s white blond head and mouths a furious
The victory Draco feels when Potter releases his wrists is cut entirely short by the thumbing at his scar. Nudging Potter's hand away with his face, Draco says, "Not very heroic of you to try and murder a crying boy."
“No you didn’t,” Harry says quietly, but with perfect confidence. No part of him believes it would have worked. “I did it once.”
“Fioncey. Fuck you,” says Drunk Ron. And then, instead of pulling Harry back into his chest, he drops him altogether and starts gesturing wildly towards the bar.
Malfoy’s not pretending Harry isn’t here at present. At present, he’s shaking off suitor after suitor and doing some passive aggressive elbow choreography just to get to him.
Blaise cuts off just as he's about to retort when Draco speaks up, but he gives Pansy two fingers for good measure.
?" Hermione says, sounding more aggressive than she really meant to because she's still keyed up at Ron. "Did you come over yesterday, Harry?"
Satisfied he’s finally found something to adequately rattle Harry, Draco laughs again. “Should I get us some handcuffs? A leather gimp mask?”
Harry reinforces his grip and laughs. “Maybe I’d’ve tried to help you if you hadn’t immediately attacked me,” Harry says. “Ever think of that? And don’t think I didn’t hear you try to cast a
“I’ll have to— things to organise,” says Draco. His hand flutters up to his hairline. “I’ll have to ask Pansy.”
He can’t blame Pansy for neglecting her tea. Dominique’s swill always tastes like some variation on diluted piss (although Draco’s has probably been spat in. So.)
After a minute of heavy breathing and rutting his hips softly through the come-down, Draco murmurs, “Yes.” The mattress he’s been pinned to for the better part of an hour is a little damp with his own sweat and come, but it’s warm and smells so thoroughly like Harry underneath. Turning slowly on his side and only then realising there’s a cock still inside him, Draco gives a satisfied little huff. “Sleeping here,” he says, eyes closed.
"Oh?" Draco tosses his fag over the balustrade and slides another from the pack. He doesn't light it. "Is it a haircut? That would be rather daunting for you."
“What the hell's going on?” he says, glad to hear the wails lowering in volume a little. “Where’s Ron?”
“I’ll believe it when I see it,” Draco says, and turns his face back to the sky/ceiling. “That’s Gemini. You can see Pollux at the tip, right there.”
On the verge of sniping back, Harry just manages to rein himself in. There’s no point letting Malfoy taunt him into yet another fight. “Why don’t you relax with the witty banter for a minute,” Harry says, “and make us some tea, yeah? I’m exhausted.”
They descend into a comfortable silence, and eventually she feels Draco's breathing evening out into the long, slow patterns of sleep. She stays with him another half hour, petting his hair and smoking cigarettes. If she didn't have a reputation to uphold, she thinks she'd find Potter herself and give him the verbal flaying of his life for fucking with Draco when he'd been doing so well.
Pansy rises from her desk and goes to stand behind one of the leather bergères by her fireplace. It's where she relocates when she has appointments with clients or business partners who are more friends than associates, or when she thinks it might be politic to flirt a little to tip an agreement her way. She says, "Come in."
It suddenly makes so much sense why Hermione’s been twitchy all evening, which actually, frankly, only makes Harry more irritated. She’s had hours to warn him, give him a chance to get the hell out and leave Ron to suffer by himself. He supposes Hermione had been worried Ron would bolt too, and it makes sense logically, but he still doesn’t understand why the fuck she bothered inviting Malfoy to dinner if she doesn’t want to do it herself.
Draco is as angular and sculpted as he looks, only softer. Soft under Harry’s lips, even at the jut of his jawline, and soft under the pads of Harry’s thumbs as they stroke the shallow dip of his spine.
“For fucks sake,” Harry says, adopting his disapproving-McGonagall pose once again. “Why don’t you just go outside, Draco? Or do a Transparency Charm?”
“Will you just wait a fucking second?” he says quietly and spins him around. There’s noise coming from the Great Hall to their right, still going full swing, light spilling out under the doors. “I’m not finished.”
, and at this point all Harry can smell is Malfoy's cologne because it's successfully filled the entirety of the small space.
"A rose by any other name and all that," says Harry. "It's alright, I'm lost too. You kill the psychopath whose been after you for seven years and suddenly your life has no purpose anymore. Funny how that works."
Harry thinks he might die (properly, this time) from the sheer amount of blood rushing into his cock. “Knickers,” Harry says in a pathetically strangled voice. He reaches out to flick the black, lacy elastic at Draco’s hip.
It’s not the reveal to Draco that it seems to be for Potter. Yes, he likes to be ordered around sometimes. He also likes a pretty mouth around his cock, and for it to do exactly as he says. Draco is
?” Beside them, one of the Hall’s arced doors creaks open and Fletchley spills out, lips attached to Lavender Brown’s. “Nauseating,” Draco mutters.
He recounted the previous evening’s events, and Pansy said: "Surely you're used to your little crush being unrequited by now."
Pansy was no help at all after the party in the Great Hall. Drunk and stroppy at being pulled away from Daphne, she had been reluctant to believe anything Draco told her was true. It was only the following morning, after slinking out of Daphne's bed, that she became more receptive to his hysterics.
Right. Sighing a little, Harry offers up, "So what did you get up to? Did you, er ... did you go home at all?"
Mother, perpetually the hostess, has always been incredibly talented at polite conversation. She could talk for hours about absolutely nothing, Draco’s seen her do it. He resents her small-talking him, though.
. Was that on the syllabus at Hogwarts? I don’t remember studying it in Astronomy, somehow. Granted, I didn’t pay
Fuck, but Charlie loves it when Harry says things like that. He sounds so vulnerable, and so kind of friable and open. He nips at the soft hem of Harry’s shoulder, and reaches between them so he can stroke his cock. “Yeah?”
"Lucius had been talking to Nott Senior in Azkaban. He's known Theo's gay since he was twelve, I mean," says Draco, "almost everyone did. Once he was released, Father came back to the Manor ranting about how their family had gone to waste. Never mind that Alphard is rotting in a cell for fifteen years, Theo's ruined the Nott name because he's a filthy sodomite. That's what Father said."
“Do it anyway,” Draco says, feeling half out of his mind with wanting. “Do it, Potter, get it in me, now.”
“That’s a great question,” Harry says, grinning. “I’m simply doomed to be common as we’ve established my name suggests.”
"Georgie always did have such a juvenile sense of humour," Charlie says, but privately he's happy to hear it. George usually slips a bit around the holidays. "Come here. Give us a cuddle."
If anything, Blaise is surprised it’s taken a whole month for this to happen. He doesn’t like seeing him this way, but also he’s hardly as much fun when he’s sulking. Especially over Potter.
Ron looks up from his chess set. He’s playing against himself, which Harry doesn’t really understand, but whatever. He says, “Funnily enough, I don’t.”
He heads around the front, and Molly's there snipping herbs from the pots on the window. He's usually only grateful for the way he's become all broad and muscled because blokes seem to really like it, but around the holidays it saves him the whole you're-far-too-thin maternal fretting thing that Mum inflicts upon the rest of the brood. So that's nice, too. She just drops her wand when she sees him, and pulls him into her and pets at his hair.
He leans into the hot spray and tries to focus on relaxing his muscles instead of the inevitable hardening of his cock which happens literally every time he steps into the shower or climbs into bed to try and will his mind to shut down for a few hours. Getting off with Charlie had helped for maybe two days. Then it was back to being sexually frustrated over Malfoy and the lack of sex he's had lately. Which is completely his own doing.
“Perfect,” Blaise groans. His head is tipped back, eyes closed. The same boy Pansy’s fucking has his mouth on Blaise, lips stretched wide and pretty.
Draco shifts his weight. “Unlike you, I like to consider my actions before I take them,” he says. “And, also unlike you, I’m not an idiot. You were the only one who could’ve killed him. So.”
He might chunder. He might literally throw up. Harry's always been tragically adept at picking the most ill-advised prospects possible (what with Cho being recently widowed, Ginny otherwise occupied and the sister of his best friend, Charlie in Romania for most of the year, and also, once again,
"No, not at all," Blewitt laughs, and Hermione can't help smiling. The sound is a bit contagious. "I only came to make myself some tea. Don't mind me, I'll be out of your hair in a minute."
Draco's always thought, from their few previous interactions, that Blewitt was criminally friendly. To still be so after they've both been on for almost twenty-four hours is literally just offensive. "Did you need me, Healer Blewitt?"
“Thank you,” says Draco. A small thrill runs through him at the point of soft contact. “Do you always take the trouble of helping your conquests conceal their battle scars?”
“No,” Blaise says defiantly. “We won’t. I can’t believe you’ve told Pansy and not me. Are we even friends, Draco? Potter makes you
Harry shakes his head, trying to rid himself of the mental image. "Gross," he says. "When was your first time with a bloke?"
That makes Draco annoyed. He’s not exactly sure why. He bites down on the moan of Potter nudging at his cock — gripping Harry’s arms, he shifts himself on top and says, “And no one ever believed me when I said you were a prick.”
But he doesn't get to, because there's the unmistakable sound of Ron pounding down the stairs and what Harry definitely doesn't need is Ron walking in on
to do is drop the ridiculous French food (it looks exactly like the pile of cat vomit he'd found on his pillow yesterday) to spite the both of them, revel in the satisfaction of watching it splatter across the hardwood floor, and then punch Malfoy in his smug cunting face. It's the coat on his arm that does it, transporting him back to fifteen when he'd been prone to becoming apoplectic with rage over very small things, which, to be fair, hadn't felt small, and nor does this. But he's
“Like,” says Harry. Frost on a Quidditch pitch. Milky tea in his favourite cup. Clouds. New sheets. A window mantled in rain. “Diluted piss.”
Harry’s being stubborn. He should’ve expected it. “What’re you saying? You want to start things back up between us?”
at me, Harry, please. Of course, you’re an adult, how you conduct your affairs is entirely your business. But when it comes to Draco, I think I have the right to be more than a little concerned. You’ve always been self-destructive around him. I didn’t say anything when Ron told me about the two of you because, call it wishful thinking, I’d hoped you may have at least tried to be more constructive before entering into a sexual relationship together. From what Draco said, that’s clearly not the case.”
If she pulls it this time, Draco thinks he might have to impale her with that nail file she always seems to be using instead of doing any actual work.
Harrys leans in and kisses him, a hand on his jaw. He’s starting to taste familiar. “I, erm — I had a lot of leverage,” he says. “I’m gonna do the Auror training program after all.”
"How fun," Draco says. "It's like a Muggle confessional. When we were seven, I pushed Pansy into the Wiltshire Pond and told Mother it was the wind."
When he comes, it feels not like the satisfying climax that comes after a steady build, but instead like something ripped from him when he wasn’t quite ready. Draco feels entirely out of control, his mind gone spacey from overstimulation and catching up to his body with a choked, “Wait, fuck.” It’s almost better, because hadn’t been clenched in anticipation, and the raw shock of it rolls through him with the orgasm itself. Draco comes, moaning in his own pleasure, vaguely aware of Harry’s cock still pounding, harder and faster, inside of him.
is buried in. Same thing, though. Right now, it’s very much a part of her. “Good boy. Isn’t he a good boy, Blaise?”
Heat rushes to Hermione's cheeks. "Oh, spare me, Harry. I thought we'd talked through this denial of the way you behaved in sixth year, and yes, I know, you were right about that in the end, but that doesn't mean it wasn't worrying watching you neglect literally everything else in your life to run around after Draco. You lose your head around him. Don't waste both of our time by denying it."
So no. Granger is not Draco’s friend. But that doesn’t stop her from doing ridiculous things like inviting him to dinner and hugging him when he arrives. It also doesn’t stop Draco from doing ridiculous things like accepting the invitation, and burying his face in her absurd hair.
Mother has always been stubborn in her blindness to Lucius' flaws. Some would see it as admirable, probably, but it makes Draco sad. He hates to see her being so weak, when he knows she doesn't have to be. "How kind of you," he says cooly.
His stomach clenches horribly (anger, and other confusing things) when he finds him standing with a clipboard outside a room. Harry goes up to him, heart pumping, and he stays silent until Malfoy finishes what he's writing and looks up.
knows she'd meant it entirely as an endearment, and when he's finished ranting says, "You need to stop equating dignity with sex, Draco. There's nothing
"Not for Seamus, it isn't," Dean says grimly. "Ron, d'you remember that night he kept waking us up having conversations in his sleep? Harry, you were in the hospital wing. He kept —" he starts laughing suddenly, "— he kept saying, 'please, not the pudding, not the pudding!'"
Harry blinks. He watches Malfoy stand, surprised by the reaction. “I was taking the piss,” he says slowly, frowning.
So Charlie and Harry started shagging. Quite a lot. Harry split his time between the Burrow, Charlie's flat, and Grimmauld, where he lived with Ron and Hermione. Well, sort of. The three of them slept there, but that was pretty much it.
Harry snorts. He doesn’t see much value in pointing out that Malfoy has ignored him literally every other time they’ve come across each other since his trial. (Except for when he flipped him off, once, but Harry rather thinks that does more for his case than Malfoy’s.) “‘Course not.”
Harry rolls his eyes. He thinks about how surreal this is, chatting with Malfoy at three in the morning on the Astronomy Tower about their lives with only some half-assed witty banter to recall the animosity that’s always existed between them. “Alright, so. Temporary but indefinite disownment. Why?”
The noises don't help but Harry stays resolute. He'll be fucked if his iron will fails him now. "Well?"
But when Malfoy starts tugging at his jumper, Harry still pulls away from his neck and stops his hand. He's not even close to drunk enough for this to go any farther on the stairs in the entrance hall. Quite frankly he doesn't think there's enough alcohol in Britain.
"Fuck," he breathes; he can hear something close to a whine in his own voice now. He tips his head forward against Malfoy's, breathing on the back of his neck. "My magic. I can't Conjure lube."
“Merlin,” Ron says. Laughs like a twit. “You’re even thicker than me, sometimes, Harry. Of course not. We’re eighteen.”
The study was an impressive effort, Harry thinks, for his current state of intoxication. Thirty percent alcohol, seventy percent Draco scrabbling to pull his trousers over his knickers as Harry ducked them under the velvet ropes strung across the arch and Apparated them to his flat.
more often than his own name, and likes to use the expensive(!!) hide rugs in his living room to break in her new heels. He’s friends with Blaise, who always slinks away from the bar before he’s paid his tab, and brings hookups back to Draco's apartment when he’s not there (and sometimes when he is, too, but Draco’s tried very hard to erase those occasions from his memory).
Malfoy looks not quite real in the moonlight with the softy falling snow as a background, nearly but not quite the same colour as his white hair. Going up next to him like that first night, Harry leans over the balustrade and glances at him. Then he takes the book out, and he hands it over.
And that was where Harry walloped him with a pillow and did some very useful reading on Self Obliviation. He’s suffered enough for one lifetime.
“Well the Wizarding world can eat my arse, frankly,” says Harry. “I don’t owe anybody anything. I died for them once last year and that’s all they’re getting.”
,” says Harry, glancing sardonically up at Malfoy, rolling his eyes, and pushing his sweaty hair off his forehead. “And I’d be grateful for it considering the current view is giving me indigestion.”
. I'm not going anywhere near Potter and his mediocre cock ever. Again," says Draco vehemently. He means it, he really does. Despite the fact that he'd sort of, er, goaded Potter into fucking him in the first place (which Pansy really doesn't need to know), he's adamant that it won't happen again.
When they start going at it like this, they're actually worse than Rose at her shrillest. And Rose can be quite shrill, with the impressive lung capacity of an Olympic swimmer. And it's worse than it was at Hogwarts, because they're married now so they're comfortable with one another and don't really hold back.
Pansy smiles lasciviously. "It's always worth a try," she says. "It's in my desk if you change your mind." And, returning to the point, "Anyway, it isn't about begging — well, it
“You did this —” Harry gestures to the inky, twinkling blackness swirling where Draco’s high, white ceiling and poncy (
"My godfather's old house," says Harry. "It's where I'm staying until I find something else. It's in London."
In his gut Harry feels a ghost of the old hatred. It’s Malfoy, after all. Bratty, malicious, elitist, bullying Malfoy who always got so much joy out of shitting on Ron for not having money and Hermione for the status of her blood purity.
Harry hums around Draco’s cock in approval, bobbing steadily with one hand wrapped around the base and the other fingering him into pure liquid want.
,” says Harry. “And if you’re wearing pants, then—”  he gives the bare globes of Draco’s arse (God, it’s brilliant) an emphatic squeeze.
"Oh, shut up, Ron," Hermione says. She whacks him on the back of the head with her wand, eliciting an exaggerated shout of pain. "And it's tapenade."
Draco huffs and squirms around until Blaise gets the hint and slides off his lap. He knows his arse is an exceptional specimen, but he does get awfully sick of Pansy and Blaise fighting over it.
as a dinner guest over Malfoy, and it’s absolutely essential Malfoy not come any farther into this flat without being aware of how completely offended Harry feels, down to his bones, about these circumstances. “Harry,” says Hermione pointedly, “can you please take the food so Draco can get his coat off?”
, Malfoy," Harry says as Malfoy closes the door, lowering his voice again so the Healer outside doesn't hear them. He's not a prick; he doesn't want Malfoy to lose his job. He doesn't
A breeze picks up and for a moment Harry can smell Malfoy on it. Some expensive cologne, probably. It's kind of nice.
He speeds off to the west without a word, knowing Charlie will follow and enjoying the freedom in that. It's not a long ride: he chooses one of the taller hills that overlooks the town of Ottery St Catchpole and all its twinkling lights, pretty enough to go on one of those Christmas cards he remembers Aunt Petunia always placing round the house before he went off to Hogwarts.
There’s a cobra lily trying to curl itself around his ear. Draco flicks it away. “Everything’s splendid. Tell me what you think of the book, will you?”
"Yeah," George laughs. "Guess so. Probably good she does, though, if you ask me. He never really stopped being a bit of a loose cannon."
“He does love his empty threats,” Pansy says to Draco as Blaise pulls ahead of them towards the entrance. “I could give him Hippogriff piss to sell, run him out of business, and he’d still demand I fuck him. He’s worse than you sometimes, Draco.”
“You know, if those wrinkle,” says Harry, gesturing to Malfoy’s robes, “you’ll look only half as poncy as usual. And, really, that would be
“As always your wit thrills and beguiles me.” Draco feels the familiar, pleasurable sensation of malice enveloping his tongue, sharpening all his edges. “Is it that word of the day toilet paper Granger’s put in the bathroom?”
Draco knows what she means, but he says, "The only feelings I have for Blaise are vexation and arousal. Often at the same time. Very occasionally platonic affection."
“Course,” Ginny says. She’s extremely iffy on Malfoy as a person, but she kind of likes that Harry is doing something for himself and himself only. “But I would never have a Malfoy crisis,” she adds. “I’m far too well-adjusted.”
“How old are you?” Harry snaps, dropping the dish he’s holding in the sink. It clatters alarmingly against the others but doesn’t break. “The wine is right fucking there, do you see it?” He grabs it himself and shakes it in Malfoy’s face. “Here! You absolute fucking brat! Shall I feed it to you as well? Do you need help with that, Malfoy? It’s just not all of us grew up with house-elves wiping our arses for us.”
“It’s going to be very helpful in this new case study,” Hermione snipes at him, and then puts on a smile when she looks at Malfoy. Harry raises his eyebrows at Ron, who mimes gagging in full view of both of them. “You were telling me about your work with that man in Paris who tried to perform a Doubling Charm on his liver — I’m dying to read about it, I wish they would hurry up and publish the article.”
"Is it?" he says, tugging the belly ring again. This close, he can just see Malfoy's tongue between his pink lips. He wants to punch him and he wants to taste the inside of his mouth. It's very confusing. "What verb would you use, then?"
the Weasel would've told Granger. She's no better than Pansy. "And, no, Potter, as you're not an employee of St Mungo's, I had no fucking clue you'd be here tonight. If I had, I wouldn't have come. Or I'd at least have brought a bucket. Are we done?"
“I need a Nausea Potion. Honestly, Pansy, how you get anything done with that bint’s head so far up your fucking arse is beyond me.”
bit. "What do you call your obsession with me our first five years here, then? Is that stalking too, or something else entirely?"
“What’s better than that?” says Blaise, but they finally come to the restaurant and Pansy opens the door to let them both through ahead of her. They take a lift up to the seventh floor and when the host tries to tell them there are no tables, Blaise slips him a few notes and soon they’re sat outside at a table overlooking the city, with heaters around them to keep the area warm.
"It's the same thing in this case, you treat him like a little doll after you're finished, it's very cute—"
He heads back outside to find Harry watching smoke furl above him, and looking just as Ginny said. Out of sorts.
Pointing at constellations has always struck Harry as comically useless. Or maybe that’s just because he’s bad at seeing them.
“Fuck off,” Draco mumbles. “How hideously twee. I just ... fuck, I might need to be drunk for this conversation.”
He gracefully ignores the jab about his parents, partially because it’s completely true but also because he doesn’t wish to talk about them any further. Had he been fifteen, or sixteen, his father’s reaction would have been no surprise, and his mother’s compliance a hurtful but predictable betrayal. However, after the events of the last year, Draco had briefly entertained the delusion that priorities may have shifted.
Harry blinks at her, then looks to his left and sees Ron doing the same. Their chess pieces begin shouting at them, but neither notice.
“Mmph,” Weasley says, reaching for a (fifth? sixth?) spoonful of tapenade (which he most recently called tapenyoke, and Potter almost choked on his beer) “if she had been a Malfoy cousin, Malfoy would be married to her by now.”
"Well I don't," Ron says. "Harry, Malfoy's been a shit to you as long as you've known him. To us, too. I know Hermione likes him, and for her sake I'll try my best with him, but Merlin, she's a better person than I am, forgiving all the things he's done. It still makes my blood boil, you know? The way he used to talk to her. To you, too."
hex it out of him, and he plans to enjoy it while it lasts. “I’m not telling either of you,” he says. “There’s really nothing to tell.”
Blaise huffs out a sigh against Draco's ribs and sits up, still straddling him. If he had even a sickle for every time Draco wouldn't let the subject of Potter drop.
"Whatever, just shut up about Malfoy, alright? The both of you. I'm so bloody sick of the whole thing."
sky now, loads of charms and enchantments protecting it and its occupants from the elements. There had been a decision made not to finish repairing it as some sort of tribute to the Battle of Hogwarts.
“Shut up,” says Harry. He squints harder. Malfoy is wearing eyeliner, and something shiny on his cheekbones, and something glossy on his lips, and he’s draping.
"True," Harry agrees. "I"m really not very well-adjusted." It's a joke, but it's also not a joke. And it's not one he'd have made in front of most other people, who would have taken it much too seriously. "I'll be alright, though. If it makes you feel any better, I doubt anything will happen on that front."
“Mm. Hideously expensive, but I’m happy with the results,” Draco says. He ponders the night sky above him lovingly.
wanted?” Harry repeats, shocked into a bark of laughter. Draco looks pouty, like a child. “You know you sound like Ron did fourth year. You can’t possibly think any of the attention I’ve gotten was worth it.”
Draco, always quite a hypocrite, thinks of Potter appearing next to him with equal parts dread and desperation. He might try and smack him, but he also might cry, and he also might get on his knees.
It’s a good question and when Malfoy asks it Harry realises that’s exactly what he’s doing. Swallowing hard, he uses slightly more pressure, just enough so he can feel his palm pressing into Malfoy’s Adam’s apple. Fuck, he’s hard. “No,” he says. “I was thinking aloud.”
much shit between you, like a mountain of it, d'you think anything between you and that person has to be inherently toxic? Unhealthy? I mean ..." he licks his lips, "d'you think that's just bad soil at that point?"
Right. That's that, then. Not bothering with his wand, Harry magically plucks the clipboard out from beneath Malfoy's arm and snatches it out of the air. On the other side of the corridor, he opens a door that doesn't have any patient information on the outside.
Draco resents being told what to do, but he supposes, if they’re both stuck there, they may as well have some tea. He’ll just spit in Potter’s cup, or something.
terms, definitely not like this, and that prospect is looking thin now. Plus he's reminded that Malfoy is the fucking worst and no amount of begging and whinging with a cock up his arse can change that. "We're gonna have to see each other, you realise that, right? Since you've decided to be mates with Hermione?"
Ron rolls his eyes. “Yeah, cheers to that. Wish Fred could’ve heard about the Malfoy thing, he’d have knocked some sense into Harry right quick.”
Harry could be all bright when he was properly happy, all sarcasm and beautiful golden skin. On good days they'd fuck in the kitchen, on the bench. In the shower, on the balcony (just once) or pressed up against a wall. On bad days Harry would come over in the evenings. He was usually quiet, but sometimes he'd talk after they fucked — always in the bed, when he was like that.
"Not that serious?" Harry echoes blankly. "You think I do this stuff with anyone I'm not serious about?"
He doesn't so much appreciate being called naive but Harry's brain is doing too much processing to get too upset about it. The Slytherins have full-on orgies, apparently. Goes well with the coke Malfoy mentioned once.
"Yes," Draco deadpans. "Potter's a lesbian, and the real reason he pulled out so abruptly is because he caught sight of my cock and went immediately flaccid. No, you fucking idiot, he's— shit. Let me put it this way — and don't laugh, or I'll tell Blaise you were the one who got Kahlúa on his mesh top — he got me to say
She rolls her eyes. Magically pinned to the wall, of course. "And? Did he fumble through it like an oaf? How big is he? Details, Draco, how many times do I have to ask?"
Up and down his arms Harry gets goosebumps, his cock hardening against his thigh to make an entirely obvious bulge in his trousers. He kisses Draco again, longer this time and with a tease of tongue, but still pulls away in the end. "What about that exactly," he says against Draco's lips, "doesn't count?"
“That’s enough, Draco,” Narcissa says sharply. It makes her throat feel tight with panic. She looks across the room at her snapdragons, away from the mark on his face. “Please. Accusing your father of — to say such a thing — it’s
Draco gives him what starts out as a smirk but, seemingly unintentionally, ends up a lopsided smile, and Harry makes his way into the kitchen and tosses his robes over a chair.
angry.” Looking up at Harry, Draco suddenly realises how he must sound. It’s childish and naive to keep looking for the good in his father that so clearly deserts him. He adds, “Really, I think Azkaban fucked him in the head somewhat. I don’t know. I wouldn’t count on an invitation to Christmas at the Manor this year, if that answers your question.”
Christmas at the Burrow is one of Harry’s favourite things in the world, and it’s at its best when every last Weasley is there. Charlie hadn’t been, the last two years — probably for the best, since he, Harry, had been with Nat. And for some reason, the prospect of Charlie and Natalie interacting (because she had joined him at the Burrow for Christmas) was less than appealing. The tension between her and Ginny had been bad enough.
“I realise you’re being protective because you care about him,” she says, in a much softer tone than she’s used thus far. “I feel the same about Harry. He’s been out of sorts about the whole thing as well and I was a little wary at first when he said he wanted me to go out of my way to warn him when I’ll be with Draco but I think he’s right, just trying to take care of himself. So while I won’t promise to keep a distance from Draco, because he’s my friend and I don’t think that’s fair to him, I
“Of course not,” Pansy says, and strokes the hair off his forehead, and Draco knows she’s being patronising.
speaking to him is Malfoy. It’s been two weeks. And he’s been very satisfied with the indirect answer he got to that rather bold assertion, but he feels guilty now too. And if he gets any drunker, he’s going to do something stupid probably.
He does, and as much as Harry loves listening to his voice, he thinks the whole rant might sound better if it were interspersed with a few whines. A moan, or two. Harry’s not fussed.
“Right,” Harry says, taking Malfoy’s pointed silence as an acquiescence. Trouble is he’s got no idea what to say. “Look, as you’ve probably gleaned for yourself, I’ve never actually — erm — done anything with a bloke. I’m sort of …” He sighs heavily, lifts his glasses and pinches the bridge of nose. Then he looks at Malfoy again and says, sheepishly, “I just want to be honest with each other as much as we can. And I don’t want to … erm. Hurt you. Or whatever.”
He's in a state of aristocratic disarray, and Harry didn’t know there was such a thing until now. His hair is all gold at the roots with sweat, and the shimmery stuff from his cheekbones is smeared across his nose. “Hm?”
"Shit," says Draco, not realising what he'd said until Potter comes closer. Asks. Fuck. "Will it quell your fervent hard-on for morality if I mollof–mollify your conscience? You're forgiven, Potter. I don't give a shit. Fuck off."
He snorts. When he’s offended, it usually comes out as derision. “Unfortunately livers don’t go for a jot of what they used to, or I would have brought caviar.”
It's then that Harry realises Hermione has decided he deserves to suffer for whatever reason, because she's taking her place next to Ron and the other chair is across the table, next to Malfoy. He grits his teeth and takes it, glaring at her.
It was good, because it had an end in sight. And it was Charlie, a Weasley, Ron's brother he'd never
“It means impermanent. Transitory. Ad interim,” says Draco, because it’s fun to watch Potter’s neck get all indignantly flushed when he’s patronising.
"Great," Harry says sarcastically, "have fun with him. Just make sure you let me know so I can find something else to do that night."
momentarily surprised to see Malfoy in his bed, soundly asleep and looking remarkably soft and vulnerable. Feeling slightly weird about it, Harry delays the inevitable for a minute and takes some time just to look at him like this, the duvet halfway down his torso and his white-blond hair splayed messily over one of Harry’s pillows. He’s very pretty. Too pretty to be as mean as he can be, or to have gone through what he has.
good at this, and he, Harry, isn’t totally prepared to have the depths of his mind plumbed. He thinks of Hermione scolding him recently for putting off studying, of Christmas at the Weasleys’, of playing Quidditch with a new broom. But he’s never had good control, and soon enough everything he doesn’t want to think of is rising to the surface: walking into the forest with his heart pounding out what he believed to be its last beats; kissing Cho after she’d been crying about Cedric; and the really embarrassing stuff — the contentedness of holding Draco in bed after fucking and before sleep, the way his hair smells, the way his mouth tastes, the way Harry’s stomach always explodes with butterflies any time Draco looks at him from across a classroom or the Great Hall. He tries to block it out and can’t, and so instead he closes his eyes and shakes his head and says, “Alright, alright, enough. Fuck, you’re good at that.”
,” Pansy insists, though she’s still smirking. “Just looking.” She sticks the sushi in her mouth finally, chews, swallows, and then knocks back the rest of her drink. “I’m gonna do it,” she says. “I can’t watch Draco pine over Potter or whatever he’s doing, it’s unhealthy and more importantly, he’s no fun when he’s doing it.” She picks up another maki and holds it up to Blaise’s mouth. “Now open up, pet. We did come here to eat, did we not?”
begun going back to work just yet, mostly because Hermione's been fretting about it, but when Heidi (the store's assistant manager) Floo-ed this morning in a panic rambling about George having an allergic reaction to a new product he was testing and Tess, the manager, being completely unreachable on her day off, Ron had to say yes. So Hermione had come home around eleven, in the middle of a shift at the hospital, while Ron went to take over at the store, and after calling nearly every one of their friends who she thought might be available last minute and finding absolutely nobody able to watch Rosie until the late afternoon, she'd done what she had to do. Without telling Ron.
Draco smiles that lopsided thing that, despite its own best efforts, is far too genuine to be a smirk. “As much as it soothes my aesthetic sensibilities, this rug is murder on my bare arse. Onward, yes? To the
“Shit,” Harry mutters to himself, and then he pushes off the wall and goes after him. Malfoy’s halfway across the entrance hall when Harry catches up and grabs his arm.
Groaning against Draco’s neck when he feels him start coming, Harry pumps him through it with quick, sure strokes that become wetter and more slippery as come coats his hand. Eventually he slows and finally stops, kissing his way across Draco’s jaw as he does and finding his panting mouth.
His mouth moves much without his permission — he meant to look, he really did — but suddenly his tongue is prodding at Draco’s hole through the lace stretched across it, and Draco’s whines of protest become
, and of the two people I’ve slept with you’re the only one I left enough battle scars on to bother.”
Draco said no when Granger asked him to watch the baby. He said no, and then Granger said please, and Draco said
“Hardly,” Draco says, and the haughtiness he’s trying for is a little undercut by the obvious desperation. Potter’s wanking technique is hardly elegant; it’s rough and rasping and every pull makes him push his hips further against his fist.
not so much of an issue usually, seeing as he's not sixteen and hormonal and constantly horny anymore. It's Malfoy that's the issue. Apparently. Which, actually, doesn't make the situation any less humiliating. He shouldn't have tossed the robes, he thinks grimly. He needs to get control of himself, and fast.
Pansy pinches the bridge of her nose. "This whole thing is absurd," she says. "Surely you know that. I don't even— Where did this happen? When did you see him?"
"Tell me more about St Mungo's, Draco," she requests. "You've told me all about Paris, but nothing about what you'll be doing while you're home again."
It hits Draco then, when his abdomen begins to coil, what he’s actually doing. His Healer’s robes are bunched at his feet. He’s about two seconds away from coming all over them. He’s at
-ing another beer from the kitchen and popping the cap off, "he invented this completely insane spell that made anyone who came within a few yards of the cursed object start fighting, pretty violently usually." He takes a sip of his beer and then points it at Malfoy, straight-faced. "You're like the human embodiment. Causing strife and chaos wherever you go. They don’t usually fight like this anymore."
I was about to die when I went, so.” He shrugs. “That and the bruise-that-never-goes-away on my ribs counts well enough for me.”
,” Pansy fairly orders him. “Now, Draco. It’s almost one in the morning, I don’t have time for your histrionics. If you’ve done something illegal you can go to Blaise, I’m too busy right now for this.”
Mother looks a little pained as she says it, but Draco appreciates the effort. “Yes. She’s head of the ward, you see. I often seek her consultation on my patients.”
. Draco says, "I think you like the thought of that a little too much. Do try not to drool on me," and then yelps when Potter starts pinching a bridge between his hip bones.
It’s almost unbearably intimate like this. He can see every expression pass across Malfoy’s face, can watch him make those little noises, and he can bury his face in Malfoy’s neck so that he’s all Harry can breathe or taste or feel. He mouths at his neck as he pumps into him, alternating fast strokes with slower ones that disrupt the pace and his rapidly-approaching orgasm.
is an admittedly sound argument, but Harry resists. By the absolute skin of his teeth, he resists. He throws on his Auror robes in spite of being covered in sweat for good measure.
“Hey Malfoy. Is the talking-like-ponce a pureblood thing, or is that just. You know. Cause you’re a complete prick.” Weasley holds out his hand and Potter smacks it enthusiastically, the two of them snickering like Ron had said anything remotely clever. Draco talks like an aristocrat because he is one.
Draco flicks his unlit cigarette to the ground and says, quite seriously, “Enough with all the earnest prattling. Just kiss me like a normal person.”
Because you’re right. Because I wanted you, and you knew it. “The same reason as always,” Draco says, voice low. “Because you’re a completely incensing pillock.”
Harry fucks his finger in further, twisting and curling and twisting and curling and sucking Draco further every time his words go broken and babbled.
Harry makes a disgruntled noise. He’s been told he has a very nice arse (on more than one occasion), thankyouverymuch.
Oddly enough, Harry thinks he kind of gets it. ‘Boyfriends’ sounds fucking ridiculous, to be perfectly frank. Especially in the context of the two of them.
An hour or two in and Potter's sideways glances at Draco have become, in a direct parallel to every drink he downs, increasingly unsubtle. Idiot. Draco's quite pleasantly drunk himself, enough to have further pondered the theory he'd thought up in one of the few sleepless nights he'd endured after that Tuesday — was it a coincidence that whatever weird, tenuous little kinship he and Potter had shared had ceased the second they'd brought it into the daylight, or was it a perfect metaphor?
It’s funny in a cosmic kind of way, like if he could step outside of his body and enjoy the stupidity of it from without. But Harry doesn’t laugh, because he’s tragically tethered to his mortal carcass, which is currently sagging with the weight of his apparently tangible emotions.
At that Harry lets go, but he’s mad at himself for it afterwards. He says, “You’re one to preach about suppressed emotion,” and takes the liberty of lifting Malfoy’s shirt off over his head. He runs a thumb across a long, thin scar on his chest. “Although you
"Because he thinks he shits gold," Blaise says before Pansy can give her two knuts. "Establishing his moral high ground, that's all, Draco. Maybe trying to get another fuck out of you, one where he can actually finish."
He tries to drive himself backwards, but Potter is resolute. A menace, keeping him still there. A cunt. Torturing him from either end as he tugs on his belly ring.
Instead, Draco makes a soft little sound of satisfaction and Harry frays at the seams with wanting him.
Harry's grin disappears and he feels awkward suddenly, too aware of their history and the dark turn things had taken the last two years. He wishes fervently he hadn't said anything. He doesn't want to think, or
“Lovely, thanks.” Yeah, not really, but Hermione suspects Terry doesn’t really want to hear about Rosie’s reverse cycling so late in the day.
He’ll have to workshop some truly devastating insults to get him back for this — for making him obey so mindlessly, making him feel so good.
“Thank your fucking stars he hasn’t got your wife fooled, too,” Ron says. He doesn’t really mean it, because as if a slimy prat like Malfoy could ever pull one over on Hermione, but whatever. He’s ranting. “Even when Harry inevitably gets over the fact that he’s, you know, blond and an arsehole and therefore exactly his type, I’m still at risk of coming home to find Malfoy sitting at my kitchen table. Fuck me. And fat chance, since when has anyone ever been able to talk Harry out of anything?”
Lastly, Ron's good at giving him space when he wants it, and more importantly, being there when he needs it, even when he doesn't know how to ask for it. Like tonight.
Biting his lip first and then forcing the words out, he says, "Come and stay with me after we graduate."
The Elves aren’t up at this hour (unlike the majority of eighth years in the common room, who are most definitely awake and high and hungry, and practically kicked Ron and Harry through the portrait hole to nick some food for them from the kitchens. Ron said, “Haven’t we done enough for you?” and then Seamus closed the door in his face), so they set about helping themselves.
"Ah, ah," Harry lilts. "Thought we established I'm the one giving commands right now. What happened, Malfoy, you used to be a quick learner in school, didn't you?" But he dips his fingers between Malfoy's arse cheeks, and the grip on his waist strengthens when he feels his tight little hole. Slowly, he presses the tip of his middle finger inside and then stops. "Your hands," he says. "On the wall. Where I can see them."
had a chance to get to know, and that made him safe and familiar. They'd bonded over Seeking and a shared sense of humour and eventually sex. And he'd known it was temporary, but Harry had still gotten a bit attached. Charlie was hard not to get attached to.
“Brilliant. You jot down a little list of everything we can do together that doesn’t feel too homoerotic for your comfort, and we’ll get right to it.”
Throwing his head back in a little groan, Draco says, "Fine. I'll tell you whatever you want to know, and then I would like another fucking."
Lifting his neck, Harry meets him in a kiss that feels different than usual, hand moving to his jaw. “I know you can,” he says.
"What the hell," he says, "I wasn't finished with that pudding, Harry. And quit doing our dishes, how many times do we have to tell you?"
Something about the way Malfoy’s looking at him makes Harry’s chest feel tight. But it’s the obviously-rhetorical question that really gets to him, because he realises suddenly that his suspicions weren't quite right. Malfoy didn't just want to shag him.
Harry presses his thumb and forefinger into the bridge of his nose, and then his temples. Ron once told him that it’s exactly what Professor McGonagall used to do when they were called into her office and she was too tired to scold (and he’s right), but sometimes that’s how he
He’s pretty sure the professors all know what’s going on and that they’ve collectively decided to let it happen because they feel guilty for how shit the last year has been.
At first Harry has no idea what he's babbling about, then the dilation of Malfoy's pupils and the returned rosy flush of his cheeks clues him in. He very much can't help smirking. "Take care of
“You didn’t really think we’d care more about Granger’s child than your half-finished tryst, did you?”
Harry mouths up to his pulse and bites down hard while his hands go to work undoing and then slipping inside Draco’s pants. “I’d venture to guess I’m a bit quicker,” he says, fingers curling around his cock. “Beat you every time, didn’t I?”
women who are always stopping him in the street and telling him how dashing he looks in his Auror's robes. Because Draco isn’t nice. Draco is an arsehole.) “Merlin!” he squints. “You’re right, Harry. I can’t believe I didn’t notice.”
. And fuck,” Ron sighs. “Let’s not go there. You just worry about what you’re gonna say when Harry inevitably puts the moves on you, next.”
It didn't go very far in making him feel better, but it was still nice to hear outside his own head.
Granger's presence had made Draco literally jump under the cloak, and now, on the other side of the portrait hole, he tears it off and throws it at Potter.
“Dunno,” Harry shrugs. “Ginny? She was good, you know. Before. Safe and familiar and all that, and she’d always liked me.” His hand goes to the back of his head, rubbing awkwardly, and he sighs. “Now I’m just leading her on.”
Finally, forcing himself to speak even though he’s brick red and can’t remember the last time he felt this humiliated, he says, “
The clipped tone makes Harry tense. A hand goes to the back of his neck and he watches Charlie's face, trying to examine his expressions in the weak light of the town's glow.
tell me you’d rather stay friends? Do unrequited confessions get your dick hard, or something? Fuck off.”
, fuck) arse. It takes every bit of his strength to only skim his fingers along the cleft, barely dipping between.
Dominique may be a useless little sycophant, but she’s awfully quick. “You can’t go in there, Mr Malfoy,” she says, hand curling around Draco’s on the knob of Pansy’s heavy mahogany door. “She’s on a Floo call.”
“So good for me, Draco— fuck,” Harry hisses, kicking his thighs wider and fucking into him fast and deep. He hears a tinkling smash, and suddenly everything smells like wine, as well as sex and sweat. Ah, fuck. It’s not on the rug, just the floorboards, but still. Dead. When Draco comes out of his haze, he’s so very dead.
He stays downstairs in the living room after everyone else has finally gone up to bed, and he's not surprised when, ten minutes later, Ron comes back down as well.
you,” she says, pointing accusingly at Harry, who throws up his hands in bewilderment, “had better be nice to him.”
The sensation of Harry's hands tangled in his hair, directing him just slightly, makes Draco's cock perk up once more in his come-soaked trousers. Saliva gathering at the corners of his mouth, he takes Harry's length once, twice more before pulling off with a wet pop. "You can, if you want," Draco says, voice a little hoarse.
with Granger and Weasel? Very bougie." She grimaces a bit, imagining the hovel they call home and all the associated smells. "So ... all right, Potter's got a hard on for you, completely unsurprising. You antagonised him, also unsurprising. This turned into a shag in the lift
Draco’s loathe to admit Potter’s actually quite funny. Even Pansy and Blaise would’ve laughed at that. He says, “Charlie? Is he the one with the lush forearms?”
Draco leans forwards on his elbows, eyes on Polaris above his own dragon. "Not a Malfoy," he mumbles. Then, louder, so Potter can hear: "Yeah, you're welcome."
Harry releases Draco’s cock, and is met with an irritated mewl. “How about this,” he says. He tugs at Draco’s waistband and he lifts his hips obligingly, letting Harry pull his trousers and pants down to his delicately muscled thighs. “On your back, pet. Good.”
He quickens the pace and keeps the movements closer to the head, thumbing over the slit. Trying for that same level of incoherency as before (so he can't finish that thought), Harry kisses the spot under Malfoy's jaw that so pleased him earlier and says, "Aren't we too old for name-calling?"
It’s a thrill having Malfoy do what he’d asked, and he looks so fucking good bent over the rail with the moonlight turning his skin nearly translucent. “Stand up a second,” Harry says, and when he does he circles his arms around Malfoy’s waist in order to undo his trousers and pull them down his hips, kissing the back of his neck as he does. “I’ve got very little idea what I’m doing,” he mumbles into his skin. With one hand he traces the curve of Malfoy’s arse and dips briefly between his cheeks. “You have to let me know if I’m hurting you.”
Despite what Harry and Ron might think, Hermione really doesn’t enjoy dishing out a scolding, unless it’s incompetent Ministry officials from one of the various boards she serves on at the receiving end. She does it because she cares, and because if she left Ron and Harry to their own devices, they’d let each other get away with everything. “He told me what happened between you last Tuesday,” she says, and leans forward on his desk. “Harry, how could you?”
It looks evil. That’s the best word for it. Red like Karkaroff’s had been, but so much more out of place on Malfoy’s forearm. Harry smoothes a cautious thumb over the very bottom of it, curious about the texture. Nothing happens, and it just feels like skin.
“Right. Right, we’ll do that,” says Hermione. She pushes the sleeves of her cardigan up to her elbows. Presses a palm to her forehead. “Although...”
Naturally, Draco was a bit cross with her about that come Monday morning. Harry, too. To be expected. What Hermione didn't expect was what Draco told her over biscuits in the tea room on Thursday afternoon, when he'd finally emerged from his strop (though, Hermione suspects it had more to do with the Jaffa Cakes she offered him than genuine forgiveness).
," Draco says. “Shut up, shut all the way up, both of you.” He’s trying to think, and it’s hard enough already without their bitching.
Of all the fucking impertinence, cornering him in his place of work (while he's doing his fucking rounds, no less) has got to be the most egregious.
What it’s actually giving him is an extremely uncomfortable erection that will make it impossible to continue sitting on the floor much longer.
Hermione sits back on their little, cushy couch and beckons Ron next to her. "I'm not sure. It's got to be something, though, right? I mean, I know he hates to be cosseted, but we've left it alone for weeks, and he only seems more mixed up."
“Consider yourself lucky you’re not mates with Malfoy, then, because he had absolutely no problem sharing much worse with Hermione. And don’t act like she hasn’t told you.”
"One go?" Pansy repeats, losing steam before she can properly get excited — as he'd warned. "You mean, like, one round, yes?"
Draco’s snippy tone only makes Hermione smile and she pats his cheek affectionately, just to see him pout. It’s endearingly different than that sneer he wore around Hogwarts.
“Shut up,” Ron says, because George is right, and he is tired. Last year he’d stayed up with Hermione because she was going through the worst of her pregnancy nausea, and then been so out of sorts the next morning that he received an Official Scolding from his mum. But that’s neither here nor there. “Move your feet so I can sit.”
He's managed to put the whole affair largely out of his mind through an extremely effective regime of ignoring Granger, pelting Pansy with whatever he can reach whenever she brings it up, and engaging Blaise's services with a higher frequency than he has in months (if Draco can pretend that the erections he wakes up with in the mornings are the result of an excellent shagging from his best friend the night before, and not Potter pressing him against the wall of a lift, then he's very happy).
When they get there he leaves Draco outside the common room portrait, quietly gets the cloak out of his trunk, and sneaks back out.
Harry closes his eyes and arches and gives into the pull of his body, letting the pleasure turn his insides to liquid and falling gratefully into an orgasm that hits that elusive peak and makes his hips stutter. It’s harder than he’s come in months, completely ridding his body of tension for a few moments as he rides the crest of it and then drifts back down with his limbs tingling a bit. He tugs Charlie down by the shirt into another kiss that’s sloppy while he tries to catch his breath.
Ron looks absolutely deranged, raving about leaving their child in the hands of a Malfoy, and betrayal, and shame on their house, and all sorts of other really excessively dramatic accusations that just barely make sense. Hermione's hardly any better; her hair's gone all especially frizzy like it does when she's worked up and verbally sparring someone.
Harry grits his teeth and tries valiantly to keep himself in check when Malfoy starts mocking him, like it’s a law of nature. He thinks it really might be.
Pansy gets an arm round Draco's waist and Apparates them directly into his bathroom. It seems easiest, given how drunk he is.
Maybe it’s because it’s so ridiculously skimpy. Or because Draco’s arse is a particularly impressive specimen. But no. Harry knows what it is. It’s that it’s Malfoy — that’s why he drops to his knees and stares like an—
Draco. She should have known. Pansy grins as most people around them start reluctantly obeying the instruction, gathering up their clothing and leaving the room with glares at him and confused looks at Blaise. For his part, Blaise is still fucking the mouth of the boy between them, and only when he finally groans and shudders and Pansy can feel their shared conquest clenching as Blaise comes in his mouth does he finally deign to open his eyes.
Draco moans, his hips shift back, pushing further against Harry’s mouth, and he’s, God, he’s collapsed to his front on the desk, and his hands are reaching back and—
Malfoy opens his eyes and grins up at Harry. “What a lovely metaphor. I’m going to steal that. And for all your complaining, Potter, your cock is awfully hard.”
Harry can feel Malfoy looking at him finally but keeps his gaze on the floor, laughing when he mentions Ginny but leaves her unnamed. “Not really,” he says when Malfoy’s finished. He looks at him now, hiding nothing on his face. Not the resentment, or the anger, or even the longing he’s been feeling the last month. “And I ended things with Ginny. Officially. Much to the annoyance of everyone who agrees with you that that should be my future. Funny enough, though, after the fucking shithole that’s been my life since the day I was left on my aunt and uncle’s doorstep, I’d like to make some of my own decisions for a while.”
Draco pushes himself up to lean against the buttress behind him. "I'm not interested in being fuck buddies."
He feels like the worst kind of stalker when he takes out the map to look for him Saturday night and finds him up on the Astronomy Tower again, then sneaks out of his dorm with half a plan and a nervous kind of anticipation making his stomach do somersaults. That he can deal with, though — at least the agony of indecision is finally gone.
It’s then that reality fully sinks in and he remembers how many of his friends are directly outside his bed-hangings and spends a moment praying they didn’t hear anything before he comforts himself with the thought that there’s no way Ron wouldn’t have come busting in like a bull if he’d heard something.
Bollocks. Drunk Ron is (what was it he said? Irrefootably?) correct. At the far end of the bar, a line of shots in front of him and a dark-haired bloke behind, is Malfoy.
“I think the two of you should know,” says Hermione, returning from upstairs where she’d put Rose down, “that I invited Draco over for dinner and he'll be here any minute.”
“He’s your father, Draco,” she says. Her voice sounds high, strange. “We both want you here. He loves you and he’s missed you. That’s why he’s bothering you, darling. Humour him, won’t you?”
“You know you’re being really annoying about this,” says Harry, inspecting a platter of chocolate-covered biscuits. “Don’t you?”
“No spiel,” Ginny says. From the kitchen, Mum’s reprimanding Charlie for the size of his julienned carrot sticks. “Just curious.”
He snaps a bit, but Charlie could've expected that. He knows how much Harry hates being counselled. He likes being handled like a delicate thing even less, though, so Charlie tries to be as frank as possible. "One last red hot go at it, I guess. I dunno. It's up to you, obviously, but you seem kind of in too deep to just deny it."
, managed to actually be worse than anticipated thanks to some clown in Kent putting Muggles under the Imperius Curse. His head was so far out of the game that said clown got Harry with a Stunner when he and Terry Boot (his partner) ambushed him. It hadn't mattered — Terry took him down smoothly and Harry got nothing worse than a bruise on his leg and his ego.
Draco palms him again through rough, well-worn denim. “You're very hard, Potter.” His voice is too hopelessly breathless to be taunting, but Harry knows that’s what he’s going for, anyway.
“Mm,” Harry says, following Draco’s hand — a pale, elegant line moving above him, letting himself melt into the smooth, polished sound of Draco’s voice and the taste of his expensive wine (which tastes
, who’s here and standing across from him), but is really just him loosening the knots of creeping panic in his shoulders. “Some emergency, or something. Not sure, wasn’t quite listening.”
“Does it have to be about forgiveness, though?” he says after a few moments. “Why can’t it be about ... I dunno. Accepting the past. Dumbledore told me ...” He sighs, shoves his fingers through his hair. “He said that remorse is really important. If ..."
“No,” says Harry, ignoring the part of himself insisting Malfoy's right, he's got major fucking issues, he's a completely broken person, “
"No," Harry says instantly, without any thought involved. His stomach lurches horribly. His face is hot. The thought of it has occurred to him in the last few days, sort of like a theoretical concept, a strange and impossible and not-very-comfortable abstract idea that he doesn't linger on because it feels wrong, somehow. And he doesn't even know what the fuck that would look like. "This is why I don't wanna talk about it, I don't
“Still didn’t catch that,” Harry says against Draco’s neck, and finally he nips at the skin like he’s been wanting to. It’s salty with sweat and addictive and next time he takes a mouthful he sucks hard, still mindlessly moving his hips.
pace, especially when it gets Malfoy to breathily admit things like how good it feels to have Harry's fingers in his arse.
he’s doing, he’s pretty sure he’s getting what he wants. Which is Slytherin enough for the time being.
, Pansy, that I shouldn't have let him see me like that. I shouldn't have— fuck, I shouldn't be able to make my own decisions. You make them for me. Actually, no — you'd abuse your power far too much, you fucking sadist. If only Blaise weren't such an idiot, I could make him do it. "
"Excuse me?" Hermione says, startled. She sits up even straighter, indignation simmering low in her belly. "What exactly does that mean,
"No," Draco hisses. "I understand this is all very amusing to you, but I can guarantee it'll be significantly less so once I've literally murdered you in cold blood."
"Draco," comes a jovial voice from the door, and Hermione turns to see one of the Healers from (she thinks) Potion and Plant Poisoning come into the room. He's very handsome, which is about all Hermione knows about him other than what floor he works on. "Good to see you. Culpeppers's doing very well, I meant to let you know. And ... Granger, is it?"
“Okay, Harry,” Hermione says, because while she does trust that Harry’s more careful now than he used to be, and definitely more mature, she’s not quite sure she believes him about not hating Draco after Sunday night’s display. He and Ron really were complete berks, at that dinner. Certainly it’s not the kind of proper, virulent loathing that drove him to do so many ridiculous things in school. Maybe something left over from that. “I don’t mean to scold, you know. I just get a bit hyper focused when I’m worried.”
. They're in a fucking lift. He uses his tongue to press globs of spit inside, fucking him with it steadily, until his cheeks and fingers are wet and he's so hard he genuinely believes his brain is in danger for how little blood it's receiving.
Someone else certainly might have been intimidated walking into the enormous office building in the heart of London where Pansy's business is located, up on one of the highest floors. Lavishly (but tastefully, admittedly) decorated and with the sort of bluntly attractive girl at reception who is probably intended to make visitors feel insecure about themselves, the whole thing feels very foreign to Hermione, but not intimidating.
Harry can only roll his eyes, but he does unhand him. “What the fuck is this, Shakespeare? Look, all I meant was that … I mean, you said not to involve you in my ‘gay crisis,’ right? So does that mean it’s a one-time thing or does that mean fuck off until I know if I like you back?”
Fuck. Harry looks so completely forlorn that Charlie is really very hesitant to give him anything other than reassurance, but the things he’s saying ... they don’t sound good, exactly. “Mate, I dunno what to tell you. I— is it more of a physical thing, or do you actually like the bloke?”
It’s Malfoy’s smug mouth, but it hits different when Harry has him so thoroughly pinned to his mattress. He likes that control, and he decides to explore it a little.
Draco feels rather stripped bare up here. He can’t help but be honest. He says, “If I knew I’d tell you.”
"Gin," he says, stretching his arms above his head and yawning, "promise me you won't have kids until these ones get a bit older."
It’s hard, but Harry ignores the whine. He could have told Malfoy he sounds like a child throwing a tantrum but chooses the higher ground, simply because he’s just not in the fucking mood. Not when he’s still on the uncomfortable side of semi-hard.
The Hunt (a fittingly stupid title, in Harry’s opinion) was published two years after the war. Quasi-biographical, but mostly centred around Harry, Ron and Hermione’s titular search for Horcruxes in that one long, horrible year. When it was published, the three of them bandied together all the wine they could find, settled down on Ron and Hermione’s living room floor, and read it aloud. For a “horridious cow with no moral compass” (quote Hermione), Skeeter’s account was surprisingly accurate.
"Jesus, Hermione," Harry says as he rights himself and Terry dissolves into laughter. He chucks the Quaffle at him, which shuts him up. "I mean, hi. All right?"
“Doubt me if you must,” says Harry, reaching for his wand and handing it to Draco. “Believe me, I’ll enjoy gloating.”
“Yeah,” Draco says. His lip curls into that ugly snarl he’s hasn’t felt in a good while. “Maybe next time, figure it out before you get my mouth on your cock.”
“Thrilling,” Harry mutters. He pushes his sleeves, which have started sagging, back up to the elbow and grabs his beer. “Are we sure Malfoy didn’t encourage him to do it? So he could sell the extra liver on some black market? Sounds like classic Draco to me.”
Draco says, "That's foul. Do you think he was infatuated with you by association? Would've driven him to cruelty to know he couldn't have you."
His eyes drop to Malfoy's throat, completely unconscious, but he becomes aware he's done it after the fact and looks away again, irritated and too warm. From the beer. He's had, like, three of them.
Harry snorts and Ron laughs out loud, clearly remembering it as well. “Yeah,” he says, “they were Transfiguring garden gnomes. Completely twisted, that woman. The husband was the one who tipped us off.” He turns to Malfoy (and feels a twinge of irritation when he spots the slight flush on his cheeks from the wine, which is ... not unattractive, or whatever) and says, “I think you’d’ve really liked her, Malfoy, she was supremely evil and all posh and annoying like you. Blond too.” He goes so far as clinking his (second) beer against Malfoy’s wine glass. “Maybe she’s a long lost Malfoy cousin.”
He has to unbutton his trousers before he gets to his knees, making room for his painfully hard cock. He tugs Malfoy's further down his neverending legs and without much preamble pulls his cheeks apart, swallowing at the sight. "Keep your hands on the wall."
Annoyed with Hermione all over again for letting this happen, and now at Ron for misbehaving enough that she's decided to take him away for a patented Hermione Lecture, Harry looks deliberately away from Malfoy and grabs for his beer, which he finds empty.
. I would be so, so pleased if the two of you were able to get along, you know that, but I worry that you're entering into this thing when there's still far too much hatred between you. Harry, it's unhealthy."
"I don't hate you," Harry says quietly. It would be easier, probably. But he doesn't. If he did, he thinks he probably would've fucked off by now. "I haven't in a long time. I don't know what you told Hermione, but that wasn't a hate fuck to me. I'm not like that."
The remainder of the meal is tense, only Harry thinks that might just be between himself and Malfoy. Ron's holding back on the mocking front and Malfoy and Hermione have slipped back into their easy repartee but he can feel Malfoy ignoring him in an active way, and Harry's still just hard enough to be uncomfortable and can't stop sneaking glances at his profile.
who’d gotten him there. “So he dommed you into a pathetic little cock drunk daze and then left you hard and wanting, did he? Poor Draco, you deserve better, darling.” She smirks. “What’s the plan, then? Jump him at
She looks down at her cup, thinking not for the first time about that moment five years ago when she’d put all her faith into that boy and lied to the Dark Lord, scared witless, only knowing she needed to find a way out of there to look for Draco.
“Really?” Draco says. He reaches over and pulls Harry’s glasses off his face, sliding them onto his own. (Harry sometimes thinks his life would be easier if he just shacked up with one of those perfectly
Draco can feel a migraine coming on in earnest. “Yes, tried. He caught my hand, and asked me why I was so angry at him.”
“My Teenage Wedding UK!” Harry says in desperation, and Ron laughs and piffs his rook at him over his shoulder.
"Dear god, Draco," Pansy sighs. It shouldn't be surprising. She's truly never understood the two of them and their insistence upon complicating a very obvious mutual dislike. "I don't suppose you told him to fuck off?"
“No problem,” Harry says, a little surprised. He gets up again from the chair, nearly says something else to the effect of
"It's all right, darling, his mother couldn't stop his tantrums either, I'd hardly expect you to. Come in, Draco," she says to him, gesturing him into her office. "Dominique, fetch us some tea and you can leave for the night."
Pansy believes that some fault likely lies with Potter — he's a hot-headed moron and probably has very little control over his urges. She also believes that
"Hell yeah, thanks," he says, leaning over Ron to see the food. Neville's treacle tart rivals Molly's or the ones from Hogwarts and usually he'd be a lot more excited about it considering how much he's smoked, but Harry's pretty sure there's not enough marijuana in all of Great Britain to get him to stop thinking about Malfoy, so.
“Oh, that’s very funny. I think Goyle’s straight. He’s had a hard on for Daph since we were fifteen, so there’s another thing you can bond over.”
"Let's talk," Harry says. His tone is falsely light, suggesting that it won't stay that way long if Malfoy tries to argue.
useless, though." She hesitates, still stroking his hair, debating asking the question she wants to ask. "Do you have feelings for him?"
Harry's eyebrows raise. "Yeah," he says. "There was this whole crazy thing when I was fourteen where I had to spend an hour down there, maybe I'll tell you about it sometime."
"Oh, I am keeping up," Harry says. His voice is lower, although he hadn't done that on purpose. He's also harder than he can remember being since the first few months of his last relationship.
When Harry walked over, Malfoy tucked his feet under himself. Harry realised Malfoy was making room for him — he thought Harry was trying to sit down, when in actual fact Harry was just trying to read the title of the book Draco seemed so engrossed in. It seemed like something Harry should know, for some reason. He knew what Malfoy sounded like when he cried and what his insides looked like. He knew the way Malfoy’s face went horribly twisted when he was scared, and the size of his fingertips by the bruises they’d left on his rib cage. He shouldn’t know that stuff, and not what kind of books Malfoy liked to read. That would be weird.
Draco is, in fact, wearing pants. However, they cover about as much skin as a piece of the fucking cooking twine Molly uses to truss up her Sunday roasts.
“Gladly,” Draco says, reclining on one of the only things kept from the Manor when he packed everything up after Narcissa moved to France. A sprawling Kashan rug, with intricate swirls in dark teal and navy and pale gold.
Ta, Blaise and Pansy. He’d only gotten his navel pierced as an ode to their friendship (Pans’ a black ring, Blaise’s gold) on one particularly drunken tromp through the night-time city.
“No,” Draco says, the pretty flush on the back of his neck to Harry as he pulls him through pulsing music and writhing limbs and several spots slick with spilt drinks that Harry has to try his hardest not to trip on.
bedraggled, thanks. The Auror robes are in fact so pompous and stuffy he sometimes thinks he might have to quit the force just so he
to come," Pansy says, all tinkling laughter and dark eyes. "We don't do pubs as a rule —" she gestures around vaguely "— sort of bourgeois, don't you think? I told him he
There’s the faint sound of stirring from Ron’s bed but it quickly turns back into snoring and Harry wastes even more time indulging in his impromptu company, watching Draco watch him and wishing he could see inside his head. “What are you thinking about?” Harry asks.
"I asked you a question," he says. He pulls his finger out and forces in a second when he slides back in, still foregoing lube just yet. "I'd answer it if you want me to fuck you eventually."
as they go, Harry leads him up to his dorm where they’re instantly assaulted with the sound of Neville’s snoring. Another
“So that’s a no,” he says awkwardly. “Look … Malfoy …” He swallows. “I don’t — erm, what would you want to happen, exactly?”
Draco drops his head back against the wall behind him as Potter’s teeth scrape over the firm skin below his jaw. There’s no thoughts, just want, just his hands tugging at the hem of Potter’s jumper. “Fuck,” Draco murmurs, “Mm, fuck.”
“You’ve always known how to flatter yourself, Malfoy,” Harry says, grinning still. He can see how white Malfoy’s knuckles have gone, can tell he’s gotten to him a little. And he’s impressed, really, that there hadn’t been more venom in the retort, but that doesn't mean there isn't still something childishly Malfoy about it. And yeah, maybe it irks him the tiniest bit, because damn. He didn't
still care, just in a different way now. “I can’t help it I’m a natural flier,” he jokes, pinching Draco’s hip. “And I did do some pretty wicked stuff to earn those House points, you have to admit. Maybe if you’d been less focused on fucking with me and more focused on finding the Chamber
good names, those. I guess they just wanted yours to be equally as ostentatious. I s'pose you're the last Black now, aren't you? You could single-handedly destroy the tacky constellation tradition."
"Yeah, sure, he's a stubborn git, but he's moon-eyed over Charlie, everyone knows he is. If anyone can talk him out of a bad thing, it's probably him. Or Ginny," he muses. "I don't get it. You'd think Malfoy would just be bad memories for him. I couldn't look at that Dark Mark, Ron, I'd lose my fucking head."
“Don’t be daft,” Charlie says. “I didn’t mean that. Course I had feelings for you. It’s just— well, it was a bit of a distraction from the real world, wasn’t it?”
"Well, that's true," Luna says sensibly, which finally makes Harry burst out laughing. "Of course, they're not really potatoes, they're only called that because they're plump and brown. And they do get very cold in the winter, which is why they hide in people's jackets."
He could tell Ginny he didn't actually shag Charlie, but explaining to her that her brother had simply pulled him off feels not quite appropriate, so he settles on an eye roll. Also, he knows where she's going with this.
When he wakes up, Harry’s not surprised to see that the sun is just beginning to stretch its fingers over the horizon, but he
“Course,” says Harry. He yawns and drapes an arm across Draco’s waist, pulling him close and nuzzling into his shoulder, wondering suddenly, absurdly, what Draco likes for breakfast.
A not uncomfortable silence descends and Harry’s high brain flits haphazardly through all his peculiar encounters with Malfoy these last three months, the new things he now knows about him and some of the suspicions they’ve spawned. He’s told Hermione about it — the random encounters, not the suspicions.
"I'll spare you only because Blaise will enfeeble you himself when you tell him about all of this," she says. "And by the way, Draco,
"Very clever of you, Malfoy," Harry says tiredly, head tipping back against the wall. "Now if only you were capable of doing more than mouthing off and being an annoying know-it-all git. D'you know I think I'd fancy being stuck in here with Percy Weasley over you? I really do."
“Good. So full, aren’t you love? No room in that pretty little head of yours for anything but my cock, is there?”
Draco looks only at Harry’s hands as he settles them over the thick guardrail, worn bronze under its dark coating. His wrists are spare and bony like Draco’s own, but the palms are more square; fingers just as long, but knobbly, and nails bit down to the quick. They look like a boy's hands, with knuckles that have been popped and rough thumb pads. Draco’s never liked his hands. They’re very feminine. Long, thin fingers and so pale they look almost blue next to Harry’s.
Harry laughs, oddly relieved. He still doesn’t think he’s going to do anything about it — he’d meant it when he told Charlie he wasn’t going to chase anyone anymore, including Malfoy. But it’s nice to have someone’s blessing.
"Yeah," Harry laughs softly, only it gains a bit of traction when he actually thinks about it. "Yeah, that would've been pretty bad. To be fair, I wasn't breaking rules just for the hell of it, though. Everyone's always putting up red tape. If they just let me do what I needed to do, less rules would've been broken."
know him. Heidi could’ve just handled the store herself yesterday, you should’ve told me Malfoy was the only person you could find.”
The revised Muggle Studies syllabus now includes a study of Muggle popular culture. Including reality shows.
“How sad,” Malfoy says. He’s still lazily rocking to the beat in Harry’s arms. “An exquisite tragedy that shall be lauded alongside Shakespeare’s greats, I’m sure.”
"Of course not," Pansy agrees. She doesn't push it, because it seems pointless to make him admit it out loud if it is true, even partially.
It’s possible that everyone decided to leave Malfoy alone when he returned after three months awaiting his trial in Azkaban because they’d matured and forgiven, and stuff like that. Harry thinks it was probably more to do with the fact that Malfoy just cut such a devastatingly pathetic figure, all sad looking and thin and pale, that no one could really bring themselves to bother him. Either way, Malfoy came back, and no one seemed to care as much as they should.
Cheeks burning suddenly, Harry shrugs. "I mean ... I want you to have somewhere safe to go is the main thing," he says quietly. "I'm not trying to ... I do really like you. A lot. I dunno, I s'pose I didn't really think it through."
And Harry does move, torturously so, reveling in the clinging grip around his cock and the sight of his own spit smeared on its length. But no sooner than he pulls out and thrusts gratefully back in — once,
He wants it to last forever yet can't find the strength to slow down and drag it out now that he's started. Gripping Malfoy's hair to keep him in place and far too turned on by that sense of control, Harry fucks into Malfoy's throat half a dozen more times and only manages a groaned "I'm gonna come" before he's shooting down that gloriously tight, wet throat and feels Malfoy swallowing around him.
is for Potter to crawl back into the fucking hovel whence he came, and never tempt Draco with his wiry forearms ever again.
The space between them empty, Harry slots his cock against Draco’s with ease. It’s—oh, fuck, it’s hard, pulling his loose trousers taught.
"Saint Potter," Draco murmurs against Harry's lips. "Now you've risen from the dead, you must be drowning in pussy."
Harry’s eyebrows raise, surprised by the request. “Sure,” he says slowly, taking the wand back. His chest clenches again with emotion. There’s an implicit trust happening here that he dares not acknowledge out loud. He’s not well-practiced at Glamours but it doesn’t take too much skill to cover up what’s on Draco’s neck and soon the bruising is so faint one would have to be looking for it to notice. “There,” he says, returning the wand to his bedside table and smoothing a thumb over Draco’s neck. “Should hold up under all but the heaviest scrutiny.”
Harry frowns. He tries racking his brain, anything about Malfoy he might have noticed sixth year but deemed insignificant to his cause. But he draws a blank, remembering only seeing him around Crabbe and Goyle or Parkinson most of the time.
Malfoy hums around his straw. “Earning it back would hardly be strenuous, Potter.” Hm. Harry wishes Malfoy hadn’t asked for a straw.
"That's what Pans told me," Blaise says, and slings an arm around her. Draco takes a moment to loathe them both entirely before he speaks again.
When Draco makes to stand, still deliciously, beautifully naked and smelling like Harry’s tingling magic and rich dark chocolate, Harry frowns in confusion.
The manor is bitterly lacking, as it's been the last five or six years. There are no house-elves to decorate. Narcissa, always in sour spirits around Christmas, refuses to contribute much more than a tree. And without his wand, there is nothing that he, Lucius, can do about it.
The thing about nighttime wanderings is that the body gets used to them. Tiredness has evolved from a desire to sleep into a kind of dull torpor that lives far enough away from his brain for it to be ignored. Far more prominent is the restlessness. So Draco walks across the grounds until the forest seems to find him, spinous edges of a path that crawl towards his feet.
