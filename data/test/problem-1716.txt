Anyways, enjoy!
“I’m actually worried over here.”
Harry thinks, watching Draco and Teddy’s backs as they play,
She regards Draco a moment, the light touching her face. “How’s your mother?”
The files land on his desk in a heap, some of its contents spilling out and mixing with each other, but Harry can’t be bothered to care. Hermione and Ron are still out of the frame of his picture. The gray walls of his cubicle are unmoving and impassive.
“...Yeah.”
Harry blurts out, “Do you need help with those?”
In the back of his mind, he's aware that he hasn't spoken to Ron or Hermione in a long time. Or Draco. Or anyone.
Malfoy sits and flashes him an easy, graceful smile. “Forgive me, for being late.”
"What? Why would I h-"
He scoffs. “Have you looked at yourself? You’re a wreck, Potter.”
Harry can barely manage a nod. He sits at the table,
"So," Molly pipes up, "What do you do there?"
friends.
Ever since Harry mentioned offhand to her a few years ago that he was trying to get in touch with his Chinese heritage again - and the memories associated with it that his father had passed down to him - Andromeda has been expanding her culinary borders. All of her own accord, she started researching - buying recipe books, researching online, even going to London’s Chinatown to taste test and shop. And every two weeks or so, she’ll try her hand at an authentic Chinese meal for Harry.
“Oh,” Longbottom whispers, after they settle down, “and there’s Draco.”
They’ve moved in together, effectively, over the past few weeks. It all started when Harry was too tired and lazy to go back to Grimmauld Place after a late night at Draco’s place, and everything changed organically from there. They don’t really talk about it. Harry finds that they don’t really need to - sometimes he swears Draco is using
A smile touches Harry’s lips, like some inward joke.
The next morning is hell.
“I don’t need it. I’m getting better, Hermione, I already told you. Christmas went fine, didn’t it?”
Draco’s hand goes into his jacket pocket, and he clutches the smooth vial within. Hearing the shuffle of his clothing, Prasad looks up again. “A Muggle vehicle? That’s a first.”
His best friend flinches from him as if burned. The sympathy that once was etched into her face dissipates. When she speaks, Harry notices her lips quiver, “Fine. Fine. I’ll leave you alone. If that’s what you want.” She rises from the couch, throws a pinch of powder into the fireplace, and Floos away without another word, without even a look back.
However, before he has a chance to completely recover, another three snowballs fly one after the other in a perfect arc and hit his head, neck, and plumber's crack respectively. He hits the ground and squirms around in a desperate attempt to prevent the snow from intruding too deep into his pants. Harry whips around and sees Sophia standing there, casually tossing the fourth snowball up into the air and catching it with one hand. Behind her he sees the other team's offensive member she was facing off with; she's face down in the snow with her long, black hair spread out around her - unmoving.
“Yeah, well, maybe she didn’t know what was happening to
The git smirks at Harry again and stretches luxuriously before getting out of his seat and sauntering over.
"Incredible. Thank you, Harry. Without you, Merlin knows how long it would have taken me to find another copy."
“Yes.” “Nope!”
“Good night, Malfoy.” Harry calls softly over his shoulder, before turning and walking arm-in-arm with Weasley through their threshold.
“What?”
“Yes. And I’ve learned that healing isn’t always linear. There are ups and downs. And Ron and I want to be there for you in the lulls, but we can’t if you’re never honest ab-”
again. ‘6:35’ floats above him for a moment, mocking him, before disappearing.
"Thank you, Draco." Hermione and Draco share a meaningful look - not hostile, but almost friendly - for a few seconds before she breaks it and looks away.
"You owe us an explanation now, though, right?" Ginny looks at him expectantly.
“I-what-”
In fact, the question seems to completely catch Malfoy off guard. “I-uh. Well-” He splutters.
We! love! emotional! vulnerability!
“You’re welcome,” Draco says, holding Harry tighter. “Of course, you’re welcome.”
an Auror.” He smiles at Harry, but Harry doesn’t smile back.
“It’s complicated!” Harry’s voice comes out defensive.
"Of course we will," Hermione assures her. "Thank you for coming over."
Giving in to her demands, he works to push her harder, until she’s swinging so high that he’s afraid for a moment that she will flip over to the other side completely. She doesn’t seem to sense the danger, only squealing with delight. It’s her first time at a Muggle park, on a Muggle swing.
Harry splutters, “I have! Of course I have. I just-” Harry has to break eye contact with Malfoy; he’d forgotten since Hogwarts how intense his eyes could get. “-was surprised, that’s all. I didn’t know you liked music.”
Harry and Ron bristle in their seats at this, both of them ready to open their mouths and speak, but Jenny says it all for them, and less aggressively, too: "Why is that? From the neo-Death Eater and frankly, from the original Death Eater threat that I've seen and that most of us here has lived through, it seems pretty clear that the danger isn't toward the Wizarding community. Wouldn't it make more sense to warn the possible victims so they can actually take precautions?"
Harry swallows thickly, and when he speaks his voice comes out a little raspy. "Yes. I loved it." The "love" in the word "loved" almost gets stuck in his throat.
It’s bright and loud here. Both natural sunlight and the lights in the shop illuminate the surface, and Harry can hear the ambient noises of the coffeeshop through one ear and the busy London street through the other. It’s a strange pick for Malfoy, Harry feels. Not one that Harry would have guessed or even chosen for himself, but it’s still nice.
“I’ll try.”
The next day, Draco breaks up with Harry.
“It’s exquisite. I’m tempted to buy a bottle for myself.”
By all conventional standards, Harry is an attractive man: shoulders solid as a foundation, hands quick and darting like small fish, silver in the streams. But his voice - anyone would know he was attractive from the way he speaks. The strumming rhythm, the undergirding fervency - Harry Potter talks like a hero would talk. Like he is both speaking to the world and confessing a secret for your ears alone.
WHAM! A snowball directly hits Harry's face, covering his glasses and dripping down to his lips. Harry reaches up to wipe his glasses clean, but endures another hit to the face and a third to his left shoulder.
Without wasting any time, she climbs into his lap to join Lucy, who’s used to this and doesn’t object; she’s actually practically asleep on his shoulder anyways, and Rose’s scream only makes her lift her head for one sleepy second before setting it back down again. “Merry Christmas! Who’s this?” She points at Draco. Harry’s surprised - up until now, none of the other children have acknowledged Draco at all.
As Harry and Malfoy float their belongings up to the house, Harry hears happy voices and laughter coming from within. No one's in the yard - besides the garden gnomes and Crookshank, who's taking pleasure in chasing them as always. It looks like they're one of the last ones to arrive, but Harry's used to being late to Christmas.
“It’s okay, Andromeda.” Malfoy interrupts her and stands up. “I should be going, anyways.” The fear that Harry saw earlier was gone - hidden as something blank slides into place and replaces it. Malfoy grabs his coat - his
"Oh! That's right," Ron gently hits his palm to his forehead, "That was tonight."
“You have no choice,” he whispers fiercely into Draco’s ear, “You have to. For the orphanage. For the kids. The Aurors will protect them. I promise.” Draco shakes in Harry’s arms. “I promise.”
he’s heard a few slurs tossed around at office parties. Racial profiling is rampant in the department, too - which is why tracking down and persecuting the
Draco is unconsolable.
Draco Malfoy pops into existence in the middle of all the hubbub, startling everyone. Most of the Aurors don’t know how to react other than stare as Draco spots the kids and immediately rushes over. Harry follows close behind.
“Y-you need to tell them. The Aurors. They can help you.”
“You don’t have to help me. I-This…” Draco’s head drops. “This is a lot to ask of you.”
Draco turns his face away quickly. “No. Don’t be ridiculous.”
“Astute observation. Now come.” He pats the ice under Harry’s feet, next to his body.
"How did you find this place?" Harry breathes as they slide into their seats and the waitress hands them their menus.
Harry thinks wryly to himself. Hermione has been on friendly terms with him for an even shorter period of time - since last night, essentially. But aloud, he only says, “Yeah, but it doesn’t feel that way.”
“Catch.” In an arc of brilliant blues and greens and reds, the clothes soar through the air and land in an impossibly neat pile on Harry’s lap. The cat has vanished.
"Me too. We should try to meet up with Draco and congratulate him, at least." Hermione thinks for a minute and exclaims, "Oh! We didn't bring flowers."
“Are you ready to go? I have to be up early, remember?”
"I see."
"Yes. It was just a test run, but I believe the Headmistress is looking to install more short classes over the break in the future."
“Don’t forgive him.” Draco moves his head closer. “You say he was young, and so he was. But everyone was young once, too, but not everyone was like him.”
He continues: “That night, on the Tower, when you were going to kill Dumbledore. I was there. What you did-what you didn’t do. That was also a choice.”
“Hi.”
Ginny holds up a black tie - possibly the one remaining one of his that isn't horribly wrinkled from being tossed lazily onto the ground after the Ministry events Hermione and Ron still force him to attend.
He pushes it open and freezes. What looks like Keith Edwards has his back toward Harry, and he's bending down and rooting around in one of Harry's file cabinets. He hasn't heard him yet.
Awkwardly, Harry takes it. “Friends.” They shake, and something seems to shift - imperceptibly. “How’s your thing at Hogwarts, by the way? With Sprout?”
“Though we oversee twenty adult dragons in Snowdonia, a brood this plentiful only comes once a decade. The eggs themselves take up to two years to hatch, and once they do, the Wyrmlings inside reach adolescence after fifty years, and adulthood fifty years after that.”
Harry nods, then drops his forehead the last remaining centimeters between them - so they are standing forehead to forehead, so close their noses touch.
But what Harry found most unbearable was the sheer hypocrisy and outright
After Hermione secretly uses her wand and summons an impressive bunch of flowers, she gives them to Harry. "Bring those up to him."
The owl he sent with the letter preens itself lazily, clearly unaware of the life-changing letter it just delivered. Blood roaring in his ears, Harry almost knocks half the contents of his desk onto the floor in his haste to find a piece of parchment and quill. His response turns out barely legible due to his trembling hands, but it reads like this:
you last night?” Hagrid asks, his voice magnified and echoing around the hall. “You never came home!”
The fourth and final present seems to be a joint one from Ginny and Luna. It comes in a small box with yellow stars hand-painted on the outside; inside, it’s a smooth gray rock with flecks of white.
Hermione doesn't seem reassured. "Well, if you're sure...and serious."
"No. It's fine. Just let me sleep."
“Harry Potter! It’s Harry Potter!” Some kind of commotion breaks out from behind Harry, and when he turns to look, a groan escapes his lips, unbidden. A growing group of wizards with enchanted notepads try to huddle forth to speak with Harry, to get the Savior’s comment on the whole situation, and are stopped only by Robards’ level glare. Harry scurries away, ducking his head and hoping no one else will notice him.
Draco - the man - pulls on his gloves: his treasured, wickedly useful gift from Harry, and begins to work. He feels almost a dozen pairs of eyes on him, half dragon and half-human, but he refuses to falter. Slowly and methodically, he takes the first into his lap and begins chipping away - holding it between his legs like the notes instructed. Piece by jagged piece, the shell comes apart, and once there is a hole big enough, Draco punctures the sac within, and the baby, along with all the fluid, comes spilling into his arms.
“Yes, but that’s not what I wanted to say.”
He feels like he’s tilting sideways. “P-pardon?”
After a moment, he hears the rubber turning of her chair. “You’re going to be just fine, Draco. Just fine,” she says, before leaving - the turning of the wheels tapping its metal rhythm.
Neither of the two men speak for a few moments. Draco looks deep in thought, his eyebrows furrowing a little bit, and Harry - well - Harry isn’t sure
But he doesn't say anything or acknowledge it at all - the only indication that anything's changed at all is the red dusting his cheeks and the tips of his ears as he passes Harry and leads him to McGonagall's office.
Harry cracks his eyes open and sees the vague silhouette of a house elf hovering over him in the semi-dark.
Finnigan whispers, “I’ve never seen Orion so bright before.”
their brochures promise. This is their deliverable.
Something’s wrong. Malfoy’s chewing on his lip and fiddling with a ring on his finger -
“Of course.” Harry leads them to the side, away from children, the Aurors, and the reporters. “Are you okay? I’m so-”
"Thank you, I'm glad you found it interesting. I look forward to seeing you all in class tomorrow - I have something fun planned. And my 'lab' is currently my apartment."
"Ursa's Ultimate Collection of Unusual Artifacts." Harry adds in the silence of non-recognition afterwards, "It's in Hogsmeade."
“This will be our campsite for the next week.” Draco gestures to the middle cottage. “I will be staying there, and the other two have three beds each - however you would like to split yourselves. Get settled, and in an hour, meet back out here for supper. Let me know if you have any questions.” With that, Draco retires to his cottage and begins unpacking.
The shifting grains of sand unsteady their feet, but Draco stubbornly stabilizes himself, huffing a little under the strain. The last brood predates even Amira’s tenure at the Refuge, so the only knowledge they have about the hatching process rests in the detailed records of dragon keepers of decades past. And the one tasked with studying them, and with the delivery, is Draco.
The textbooks tumble out of Harry’s arms and land directly on their feet.
"Yes," Draco picks himself up from the couch, removes his coat, and begins rolling up his sleeves. The fire crackling in the fireplace illuminates him, scattering the colors of his shirt and turning it from maroon to red . "Get up, Harry, let's go. Molly, there's still time on the food, yes?"
He teases back, "I don't think you have any authority on that, either."
Grinning, Harry collects the textbooks -
Five years. Five years worth of hard work and forging connections with Muggles from all walks of life. Five years worth of studying music, composing, and conducting research. Five years of rebuilding his life from scratch and this isn't even all he has to show for it.
After a long moment: “Your position is an interesting and valuable one…” Kingsley begins, slow and hesitant as if he is choosing his words carefully. “...and I will endeavor to put it into action either today or tomorrow. But for now, we have these following orders for you all.” At that, he stops talking and looks to Robards expectantly.
The blonde closes his eyes and holds up a hand to his temples like he's about to faint and proclaims dramatically, "I have not known peace."
“Indeed.”
Harry’s hand is warm, so warm, in Draco’s.
"Yeah. My head's killing me, though."
The Dursley’s. Harry has told Draco a little about them - though obliquely:
Harry snorts out a laugh. “Wow. I almost forgot. Thank you.”
With his other hand, Harry slowly touches the scarred, twisted flesh of Draco’s left forearm. A reminder - for both of them.
Done with inspecting the tree, Luna bounces over and sits on the couch with them. Ginny pulls her into her lap and the two share a tender kiss. Harry looks away.
The students burst into laughter, unable to keep it in anymore. Harry rolls his eyes and catches Malfoy give him a cheeky wink when the student's aren't watching.
“So….” Harry begins but doesn’t know where or how to end.
"Yes," Draco smirks at Harry, and it looks so normal that his heart calms down and skips a beat at the same time. "We were rivals."
“Oh.” His shoulders slump a little. “Nothing I was just...wondering.”
“Will you call him? We left our phones…” The baby in her arms shifts and frowns in its sleep.
The rest of the evening passes peacefully and thankfully Malfoy-free. Andromeda continues knitting the amorphous mass of yarn in her lap, adding a little silver into the purple towards the end - all while gushing about Teddy and his spectacular marks in school. Harry leans back in the cushy couch and listens to her and the faint hoots of her two owls, Sherman and Bedelia, as they perch in their cages in the kitchen.
"Greetings. It's about time you took that off. It was extremely distasteful to look at. Such a garish color." When he talks, his moustache quivers.
Malfoy. And, like Andromeda said, it wasn’t that big of a deal. It’s normal for family to stick together, especially after the War. Harry, of all people, can understand that.
"You alright, mate?" Ron inquires, placing a hand on Harry's back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah I think so.”
Harry chuckles and hugs Draco closer. “Seriously though, shouldn’t we get married first?”
“Sounds good, I’ll see you then.” He pauses, awkward. “Goodnight.”
is his favorite part: reenacting the story and drinking in his audience.
“Comment.”
Harry tells a joke, sending his friends into an uproarious fit of laughter. He pays them no mind. He looks instead to Draco, a half-smile on his weary face.
Harry bolts out of bed.
When Harry turns his head, Malfoy’s sitting on the couch beside him with glasses on and not much else. “Harry.” He’s holding a bundle of fabric - his clothes.
Harry buries his head under his sheets until the darkness is complete around him. "Nope." No one will miss him anyway - except for maybe Ron. But even then he'll probably understand. Harry's missed work a lot in the past, so none of this is new. Sure, he was reprimanded by Kingsley himself when he skipped for extended periods of time in the past - probably because everyone knows that he's the only person in that damned Ministry that Harry is willing to listen to anymore - but nobody will notice one absence. Harry's been keeping good on his promise of punctuality and perfect attendance so far, so just one cheat day won't hurt.
"Alright?"
“Did you fall asleep?” Malfoy does not sound impressed.
All at once, a dozen faces turn and see Harry standing at the other side of the hallway.
“All done!” Prasad chirps. “Just remember to try to keep your magic usage to a minimum - the dragons get a little antsy when they see it. And as you already know, Draco here will be your guide for the next seven days. All the safety measures are outlined on page three, but you shouldn’t worry with Draco. He’s very experienced.” They beam at him. Longbottom looks slightly ill.
Sobs rack his body with renewed vigor. He scrabbles at Harry’s robes, clutches onto him with a vice-like grip.
[Reference over]
They all have drinks in their hands, which explains how drunk they look in it. Hermione is doubling over in laughter, almost spilling the contents of her cup, and Ron’s hand is resting on the small of her back, his face twisting in barely contained glee and amusement. Harry stands to the side of both of them, and he’s laughing too, but not as hard. He’s mainly watching his two best friends fall over themselves laughing with a smile on his face - eyes warm.
"I never knew you were so artistic, Draco," Luna muses while cutting the piece of chicken on her plate. Steam is still rising from its white breast.
It feels like all the blood in his body has collected in his head, behind his ears.
The cashier brings his coffee and Harry sips it gratefully while he examines the coffee shop and waits. The only patrons are a business woman eating a sandwich and watching something on her laptop and a teenage boy texting with a half-finished fruit parfait in front of him. The shop itself is small, with some tables lining the window like the one Harry is sitting at and some couches sitting on top of a plush rug in the middle of the floor. Classical music plays on the speakers, barely audible over the various machinery behind the counter. The smell of something chocolate-y drifts over to Harry from the oven in the corner and his stomach reminds him that he didn’t eat breakfast.
“By the way, have you gotten an owl from Hermione and Ron yet?”
“Sorry-” Harry begins before Hagrid cuts him off.
Several more hours it takes, to make the journey back. Now that they know what is possible in Snowdonia, the men watch the shapes in the dark more closely, as if convinced that, at any moment, those slitted eyes that have not moved in hundreds of years will slide open and pierce the night. Draco was like that in the early days, too. Half-afraid, half-hopeful, scanning each mountain face and fancying himself worthy enough to witness the waking of these creatures who have never woken for anyone before.
Draco makes sure to address each of them personally to thank them for coming, for listening, for donating. He looks exhausted - hair plastered with sweat, bags deep and cutting on his face, and shoulders slightly slouched - but still he forges on. At the donation table, Belle and Ava begin filling up what Harry counts as their fifth cardboard box of the night with notes and checks. Harry can only imagine what they've already received electronically.
I-! Why would-”
Sophia huffs and opens up the other book. “I was busy!”
He waves a hand. “I will be fine. Though the same could not be said for Weasley.”
He approaches and takes a seat next to Draco. The latter rests his head on Harry’s shoulder, and they watch the waves and their tumble.
"...I guess," Draco finally concedes. "Sorry, I know I should take compliments better. I just feel like the second half wasn't...what I hoped it would be."
After a moment of hesitation, Draco replies, “Yes. A little bit.”
But Robards doesn't seem to notice Edwards' peculiar demeanor. Really, judging by the way his narrowed eyes are still darting back and forth between Jenny and Ash, it just seems like he's still preoccupied by the interaction he had with them earlier. “Clarke and Weasley," he continues. Ron's hand tenses up a bit. Despite the fact that he's reminded Robards time and time again that he's married now and that his surname is legally Granger-Weasley, he's never bothered changing it. Hermione insists that it's not something to get too upset over, and Harry secretly agrees, but it continually bothers Ron. “You two will join the field teams, but with a focus on prevention and protection.” Alexandra Clarke, a round woman with long auburn hair who’s been Ron’s loyal partner ever since he joined the force, nods at Ron from across the table. Harry’s quite fond of her - she once baked Harry a batch of butterscotch cookies for his birthday, unprompted and without any ulterior motive. In fact, he wasn’t supposed to find out that she was the one who had done it, but Ron accidently let it slip to him almost immediately after they found the plate at his cubicle door.
The compliment seems to placate Malfoy. He huffs but turns back around and continues walking. “I’ll let you know when the next one is,” he calls over his shoulder.
There are no major content warnings for this work, though if you are sensitive to themes of grief, maybe give this fic a pass.
Cracking a wry smile, Malfoy answers, “No. Don’t you keep up with the celebrity gossip, Potter?”
He stops at the piano, places a hand on the side, and bows deeply to the audience. The audience reacts to this by screaming even louder. Draco picks up a microphone that Harry didn't notice was placed strategically on the piano and begins speaking. "How are you all doing tonight?" Somehow, his voice is deeper, huskier than normal.
"What?"
They disentangle their bodies and manage to stand up - neither having sustained any serious injuries.
It's Draco, but once Harry turns around and looks at him expectantly, he quickly drops his hand and turns red. "S-sorry. I'm not sure-I don't know why I did that. You can go on the tour if you want."
Harry admits, “It’s pretty bad. We’re keeping it out of the papers for now.”
He hesitates. “I’m listening.”
” Teddy checks Draco. “And checkmate.”
Harry looks at him, eyebrow quirked.
to say it without potentially pushing Draco away.
After a moment of reflection, Draco answers, "Around fifteen, I believe."
A pleasant tingle goes through his body as he reads his given name, written in the hand of Draco Malfoy.
“You look like it.” Draco adds, “No offense.”
know.”
At that, Malfoy stops and turns around. “Why?” His tone is questioning, even a bit alarmed.
On the opposite wall, the bar seems to be closed and Ava, the bartender is nowhere to be found. Harry wonders why for a second before immediately spotting a group of children seated a table near the front. The orphans. Pat is sitting with them, chatting and looking after them. Ava is talking to Dan with a wide smile on her face. Draco isn't with them, but Harry assumes he's busy preparing backstage.
The reporters almost within earshot now, and Robards is nowhere to be seen. Desperation claws its way out of Harry’s mouth.
“It is.”
“You hated Care of Magical Creatures.”
The conversation can easily end there, but something in Harry is encouraging him to press further, to find out more. “And once you find something…” He trails off, expecting Malfoy to jump in, but he doesn’t.
“Your friends. They’re coming for a week-long trip today.”
Coincidentally, it’s zem who speaks up next, interrupting Kingsley. “If I could, Minister.” Kingsley nods to signal that ze can continue to speak. “Even if this is the case, I still suggest a warning of some kind. And then a request for the most vulnerable areas - the Muggle streets and neighborhoods with high traffic, or something similar. In fact, I have reason to believe that intel from our field agents may provide clues to their first target. Protecting people should be - and
Harry greets him with a gentle kiss. “Bed?”
Draco nods deeply, his lips curling into a genuine, pleased smile. Harry gets the sudden urge to read up on jazz, to learn its history, to properly listen to this music genre that he's had very little exposure to all his life (Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon despised it, considering it just another trashy,
Somehow, the entire club is quiet, everyone collectively holding their breath.
"Congratulations," he tells him, presenting Draco with Hermione's bouquet. It's well put together and beautiful - spiky leaves paired with blooming flowers of every warm color: reds, oranges, yellows.
Soon, there's a whole crowd of people - which is basically what the entire immediate Weasley family boils down to - gathered in their garden. It's dark out by now, but with a combination of enchanted Christmas lanterns floating here and there and nearly every wandowner's Lumos, visibility levels are actually pretty good.
“With Lucas.”
"My 'O' in Muggle Studies is finally going to be put to use," Jenny jokes, making Harry crack a smile. Truthfully, if she weren't already dating Ash, Harry would've tried to get close to her as well. She's always reminded Harry of Ginny in some ways - her strong convictions and spunk being two of them.
He sighs. "Just wondering. I always admired that about you - your protective nature."
Despite the potential disaster looming on the horizon, the Ministry seems fairly calm - like it's a normal Monday. The fountain is gurgling away as always; after the War, Hermione petitioned to have the old statue replaced. Her argument was that it perpetuated the oppression of non-magical beings as well as of witches - the witch in the statue was portrayed as less important than the wizard, after all - and Kingsley had agreed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione all supported the change, until it turned out the replacement statue was going to be of them, by popular demand. The public wanted it, and despite their efforts to stop it from happening, the public got it: a ten foot tall statue-fountain of the "Golden Trio" that now guards the front of the Ministry. It's really embarrassing to look at, but in all the years that Harry's been working at the Ministry, walking by it every morning to go to work, the initial mortification and annoyance has faded somewhat. Nowadays, Harry and Ron barely even notice it anymore.
Harry hesitates, then rests his hand over Draco’s, and the vial. “I’m sorry.”
“I-I don’t want to do it anymore.”
Malfoy yawns - he’s half-horizontal now, his head resting on the arm of the couch - and shifts his feet. “I think so too.” He holds up the last reading and Harry takes the hint and transfers it to the stack too.
“Isn’t it amazing? That humans have lived here for thousands of years, and now it’s our turn?”
Although George and Angelina married a considerable number of years ago, they did so at a busy time for both of them: her career as a Curse Breaker was just taking off, sending her to all parts of the globe on missions, and Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes was opening store after store all over the United Kingdom. As a result, they didn't see each other often for several months at a time. Harry remembers feeling bad for them, mostly because he and Ginny were in the same boat - with her traveling everywhere with her Quidditch team, playing games and doing publicity tours, they rarely had time for just the two of them. But Angelina and George are strong people, probably the strongest that Harry's every met, and they only seemed to have minor spats during that time.
Fatigue rolls over him, clouded and heavy. He takes himself to bed, but still is without rest. By the thin light of the moon, escaping its cloud cover, Draco catches the glint of the vial on the bedside table, and its unmoving contents. He touches the mottled flesh of his left forearm, the shape familiar to him even in the dark: here, the eye sockets, here, the figure eight of the snake, and here, its open mouth.
Malfoy and Harry spend the next fifteen or so minutes chatting about the details of the situation in hushed tones - even though the Muggles around them wouldn’t understand or even care. Malfoy is an attentive, engaging listener, and the more he learns about the neo-Death Eaters and their movement, the deeper the furrow in his brow gets.
Harry’s initial plan was to remain until Christmas Eve - Friday - all along, so “Yeah. Until the end of this week.”
“Fuck!” Harry exclaims, shooting to his feet.
"There!" Arthur half-shouts in triumph, staring around at his family defiantly. "Draco agrees! Jazz is a fantastic invention. And I honestly think the Wizarding community could benefit greatly from its healing power."
Prasad lays their hand on Draco’s arm, their touch gentle, and their brown eyes warmer than Draco has ever seen them: “You deserve it, Draco. And he wants to give it to you.”
“In the myths, it was one of the giants who tried to overthrow the gods. Ultimately, Athena - or Minerva - slew it, and threw it into the sky - freezing it in its coils forever.”
Neville stares out the window.
Draco braces himself.
"Robards," Kingsley says sternly. "Control yourself."
They stop at the door and Harry glances over. "Are you ready, Malfoy?"
“Wait.” Sophia touches Lucas’ shoulder. “What are we looking for again? Did we even decide on a
Molly is the first one to break the silence. "Merry Christmas to you too, Draco. Welcome to the Burrow." To Harry's immense relief, she says nothing more and simply smiles the same kind smile like always and gestures to the massive, cushy couch they bought a few years ago to fit all the new family members. There is only one spot left, and it looks like a squeeze for two people. "Sit, sit, the food isn't going to be ready for a while."
His head tilted up, face twisted, eyes searching, Draco waits.
"I was tampering with the case files. That was the other part of my job."
“What do you want?” The man asks him, his arms folded, looking at Harry, unimpressed with what he sees.
“Yes.” Draco waits for the barb. He is not afraid. Harry Potter cannot say anything that he hasn’t already said to himself.
“Yeah, what are you working on now?”
“My father died earlier this year,” Draco explains. “This is half of him.”
“Look at you, Potter. You’re practically asleep already.”
“Thank God….” Harry can barely hear Draco’s voice above all the ambient noise. “Thank God…..”
“B-but that’s different.”
"We both are," Angelina answers. She and George smile at each other and intertwine their hands. "And then we're spending our late honeymoon in America."
Thank you for reading :)
But right as he hesitates, his mind races, the house lights dim. "Oh! It's starting," Ava passes Harry the drinks. "You should go sit. We can talk afterwards."
“See?”
But Harry quickly finds that others had the same idea. A group of ten students pass Harry and swarm Malfoy.
Clutching at each other and trying not to collapse in a heap of limbs onto the ice, the two men struggle and curse, trying to find their balance again but not daring to let go.
"Yes, I know, I know," Robards snaps, irritated. Harry suspects he's more angry that Edwards got snot on his robes on the way over than anything else. "Stay on topic."
"You have yet to receive an assignment, correct?"
"Excellent," the blonde's response comes without any hesitation or pause as he winds his scarf around his pale neck. "I will see you all there tonight at seven." He reaches into his breast pocket, pulls out a neatly folded square of paper, and presses it into Harry's hand. "That's the address. And Merry Christmas."
“No.” Harry stands, too. “The beds are wide enough for two people.”
"Thank you, dear!" Molly calls out without taking her eyes off of what looks like a pair of mittens slowly forming under her skilled hands.
Harry backs out of Robards' office, goes back to his cubicle, and finds he can do nothing but laugh hysterically, clutching at his desk. On his desk, the photo of him, Hermione, and Ron glints under the harsh light. The trio is back together, looking happier than ever.
Yes, this is good. He isn't going to apologize - not until he's sure that they've learned their lesson, anyways. He just needs some space in the meantime. Harry waves his hand and reorganizes the files to the best of his ability; they silently settle back on his desk in a neat pile. He repairs the quill, but he can still see a little seam where it broke.
"Not at all, Ma'am."
“Really? What gave it away?”
“It’s a good place,” Draco says simply.
But now that it's the next day, the prospect of facing the entire Weasley family plus their spouses and children during Christmas is daunting, even for Harry, who's known them for most of his life. He can't even imagine what Malfoy must be feeling right now.
“Why?”
"You love it."
and pouring water comes from the kitchen area, but Harry can’t bring himself to look.
Hermione gasps. “That’s incredible, Draco.”
“Don’t,” Harry gasps, “move.”
“Shh.”
She gives him a look. "Of course." With a tap of her wand, the fabric turns the exact shade of green that he had in mind - Slytherin green. She tosses it to him, and he catches it gingerly and begins to tie it.
"The moon." Luna points.
It’s not solitude that Draco seeks, not its familiar coldness.
You never taught me how - is what Draco would say now, if there was any use.
Harry wants to reply. Wants to tell him “Of course I’ll invite you again - in fact, I want to invite you every year from now on not only because I want to but also because the Weasleys would probably kill me if I don’t,” but he can’t. Because, before he knows it, he’s asleep.
“It’s fine.” He smiles at her and lifts the baby out of her arms. “It’s the perfect chance for me to spend more time with the little ones.”
“I’ll start packing.”
They paddle onwards, conversation flowing freely. Save for them, it’s quiet - a few Muggles walk the shore with their umbrellas out, and the rain comes and goes, but no birds call, and whatever fish that swim the reservoir have gone deep into the murk.
“Does she visit often?” Harry wonders if this is dangerous territory, but his curiosity gets the best of him.
But the inside isn't too stimulating. The ceiling lights strobe the blue and purple that he saw spilling outside just moments before, there are small round tables placed here and there on the main floor, a bar runs along the far side, and the stage is front and center - but only raised a foot or two off the floor. A whole crowd of Muggles are seated already, and they contribute to the light, ambient conversation and gentle clinking of glasses.
“Oh my.” Malfoy sits back into his chair, sandwich gone and coffee half-finished. He’s gone a bit green in the face. “I haven’t heard of this.”
“Merlin,” he interrupts her, “you’ve been
“Tea?” Hagrid holds up a cup.
“Don’t be.”
“You’re welcome.”
“No!”
“Yes?”
She checks the label and reports back, "Grandma."
curse the Friday before last. I don't think I need to say this, but this is nearing an emergency situation - and not just because he escaped."
Malfoy turns his head to look at Harry. He looks amused, though Harry’s isn’t sure what’s so funny. “The snow is so obvious on you.”
neo-Death Eaters has been an excruciatingly slow process - and once in holding, suspects, especially non-white ones, face outright torture like Unforgivables - all of which is hidden from the top brass, of course.
At the end of the night, Ron ushers a yawning Rose to bed and Hermione sees Harry to the Floo. Before he can escape, she pulls him into a hug. “Tell me if something comes up, okay?”
"Incredible, fantastic performance, as always. I'm so sorry to hear about the orphanage..." An elderly Muggle woman says.
Harry glances at the name on the case file. “Our guy, Jack Willows?”
“Alright, ‘arry?”
Giving Harry a slight smile and handing him the change, she says, “Perfect. I’ll bring it around soon.” Then, she gestures to a table near the front window. “You might want to sit there. That’s his favorite spot.”
Around the room, all the Aurors nod their heads solemnly. They all realize that the meeting has been mostly inconsequential, which means there haven't been concrete updates to the investigation. The haggard, sleep-deprived faces twist in frustration as they realize that their efforts aren't leading anywhere yet.
Harry doesn’t even remember the last time he went out for drinks with any of his
was the one who vouched for Draco and Narcissa during their trials, after all. When did he stop caring?
"Why are you asking?"
“I’ll go with you.”
Harry braces himself.
Draco turns to Harry then, gives him a wry smile, and subtly gestures to the family members gathered around the table. "Do they always respond this way to a pregnancy?"
Harry takes Draco’s hand. “What’s wrong?”
Grimmauld Place is dark and quiet when Harry stumbles back in. The ancient, Black furniture casts warped shadows in the moonlight, so Harry quickly spells the curtains shut. He pads into his kitchen - trying to be quiet for Kreacher and Spotty, both presumably already asleep - and glances at his liquor cabinet. He usually indulges after dinners with Hermione and Ron, but
They wash the dishes together, like usual, shoulders touching. And afterwards, Draco leads Harry to the couch and sits both of them down.
“Yes,” Draco tells Harry, “You can kiss me.”
"Stop the fort!" Stella yells from across the playing field. She ducks to avoid a snowball to the face and sends one right back at her opponent in retaliation. It lands perfectly.
He stands. "Ready."
Briefly, Draco closes his eyes, and imagines it: the stinging grit, the sucking tides. The sun in his eyes. The water, taking him in, and his friends urging him forward. Harry Potter’s voice in his ear. Harry Potter, buoying him.
Malfoy catches Harry's eye and smirks - and it's the kind of egotistical,  self-righteous, and petty smirk that he used to give him all the time in Hogwarts. It's a throwback, but not really a sight for sore eyes.
It’s a little fast, and Draco’s mother made sure they knew that she thought so too when they had dinner together a week ago, but Harry has never been happier. What used to be tedious chores - laundry, cooking, cleaning - have become enjoyable with Draco there, doing and complaining about them alongside him. It’s still difficult for him to get up in the morning knowing that all that awaits him at work is a bland office and mountains of paperwork, but when Draco wakes him in the morning and all but orders him to go, Harry finds he cannot refuse.
"Yep. It's a popular one already, if you couldn't tell. Lots o' kids chose to stay just because of it."
“Definitely not. Hermione still reads some from time to time, just to keep up with what’s being said, but she tells me all the time how garbage it still is.”
Teddy scoffs and moves one of his own knights in retaliation. “I’m just not a little kid anymore. You were at my twentieth this year!”
“You haven’t told Molly yet?”
"No. At least I don't think so."
“It could have been either Neville or me - we both qualified. But Voldemort chose me. And from then on, everything about me revolved around him, and the War that was coming. Everything still does, really. I will never be free from it. I’ve never even known that freedom.”
A sound, a growl, erupts from one of the adult dragon’s throats. A line of smoke begins trailing from its nostrils. The babies squeal and toddle over, their limbs still awkward, their infantile wings flapping unevenly. Once all five of them gather, the adults take each of them in their mouths by the scruff of their necks. They bow their heads to Draco, unfurl their wings, and take off in unison. The beat of their wings is so powerful that it sends the shell pieces and food pellets scattering, and Draco must press himself to the ground for fear of being blown away.
"I-I don't know," Harry stammers, like a fool, "Just wondering. Glad to hear she's well. And you said she’s close to the sea? That’s nice.”
“Thank you. I can’t believe you found this.”
Draco settles in, as he has so many times before. He takes out the cooking supplies and the ingredients. He places the vial on the bed stand. He regards it for a moment, then turns and goes to start on the cooking.
“Harry, it’s okay.” Draco cups Harry’s face. The tears that were in his eyes earlier have all but disappeared.
“I-uh-wh-?” Harry suddenly realizes what he means as the true gravity of the situation they’re in settles on him. “Oh.
Both of their careers haven't slowed down much since then - quite the opposite, in fact - but with their professional success has come more flexibility in regards to their schedules. They often had to miss family get-togethers like Christmas in the past, but now they can actually take some time off.
Hermione pipes up, looking at Draco, "Are you active? In the musical-magical community, I mean."
Narcissa smiled, her blonde hair falling all around her as she leaned over him. The light spilling from the hall barely reached them.
“It won’t. It’s not.”
“Draco?”
"No, not normally, but my boss gave me special permission to take off for another job of mine."
After waiting around for a response for a few minutes - all the while squinting a little bit from the sunlight that insists on streaming into his room - he casts
Draco obliges, stepping into the riverbed, feeling the ghost of water flowing over his feet. They follow it downstream for a while, going home.
Draco casts him a glare over his shoulder and taunts, “Whenever you’re ready,
"Thank you for your enthusiasm. Please relax and I hope you enjoy the rest of the show." His little speech down, he takes a seat and begins to play.
“Oof.”
“I know.” Draco looks as if to say something else, but seems to think better of it.
“J-jazz?”
“...You remembered,” Draco finally says.
“I’ve had a long time to do it.”
A sense of calm settles in the club. Faces relax and turn toward the light of the stage. Legs stop shaking and hands unclench. Even the baby is completely silent and still.
he says.
They walk in silence for another corridor before Malfoy interrupts it. “Please extend my sincerest apologies to Longbottom. And reassure him of the truth.”
It’s a busy week - both Prasad and Walker are out on extended camping excursions, leaving Draco and Amira at base, alone, to prepare for five new baby dragons.
“Y-e-s?”
“Collect your belongings, and you can get settled.”
“Yeah.”
The doors close, and the light that spilled from within slides off Draco’s face.
"Maybe McGonagall is trying to introduce a few bits of Muggle culture..." Though why so many students would be interested remains a mystery to Harry. The War may be over, but prejudices remain as difficult as ever to let go.
Her eyebrows lift. “Draco? Not yet, no. Are you meeting him?”
A silence. Draco contemplates making his excuses and retreating when Harry speaks again:
“Where are you headed?”
“I know, I know.” Little by little, Hagrid comes out of the shell he’s retreated into. “I was thinkin’ this summer would be good. I’ll take her down ter the sea or sommat.”
Rubbing circles into Draco’s palms, Harry waits for his husband to collect his thoughts.
The Amber Tap is a modest brick building wedged between two other, larger clubs. It seems less assuming than the other clubs on the street, but it's the only one with a line poking out the door. From inside, Harry can see blue and purple light strobing gently and hear subdued conversation. No music, but Harry supposes they're waiting for the actual live music to start.
"I hope he puts something on for us next, I would love to contribute to the cause."
Thankfully, it's not a long ride to reach their floor. The lift dings open and the voice announces, "Department of Magical Law Enforcement, incorporating the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services."
(See the end of the chapter for
It takes some time - time that Draco fears they don’t have - but he does it. Eventually, it’s just him in the center of the crater, eggs as big as his torso scattered at his feet, and everything he should need beside him.
Draco waves his hand. "No problem at all. I'm there every night of the week, so you could just stop by anytime you'd like. The one tomorrow is just the Christmas special."
“Anyways,” Ron shakes off the memories of that night, “We’re thinking about names.”
His throat constricts; if he’s not careful, he’s going to begin crying too. But he’s done crying, at least in front of other people. “That doesn’t fucking mean anything to me. How do you think your ‘sorry’s will help me? And your endless nagging?” His lips curl viciously. “Did those Muggle books tell you that would solve this? ‘Cure’ me? I thought you were smarter than that, Hermione.”
“I know you,” Harry says simply, easily. Not a boast or a rash, infatuation-fueled statement - just a truth.
"Holy shit."
’s logo emblazoned on it.
Hermione stands up and heads for the door. She’s dressed already as well, in a velvet-looking black dress that goes down to her knees, but has a diamond cutout on her chest. “I’m going to check on Ron.”
She continues. "I've gotten multiple requests for you to stay - practically an entire petition, in fact." A dramatic pause. "And I seek to honor their requests - but only if you're obliging."
Desperately, Harry looks to Malfoy for help, but the git is feigning deafness and playing with the baby. “Er, yes. We went to school together.”
"I think so," Ginny ventures, ignoring George and answering Angelina’s question, "Unless anyone else has any other objections." No one does.
"Oh!" Hermione's jaw drops. "You were
"Logically," he responds, voice crisp and composure mostly restored.
The kids, with some coaxing by Arthur, leave the living room - new toys still in hand. Harry looks at Lucy, who has been walking her new stuffed hippogriff up and down his arm, shoulders, neck, and head for the past few minutes. "Breakfast?"
Harry winces in embarrassment. “Sorry, mate. I don’t understand,” he looks around him, at the drab gray walls of his bathroom, “I didn’t have
“Little Palace, Viet-Naan - a wonderful fusion place - and Verde, among others. They’re are the ones I visit most often. I’ve even treated my mother at a few of them before, when she visits.”
The cord wraps them both up, now - a hot wire. And it still sings. When Draco presses close, he hears it, rising from Harry’s skin.
Harry is lost.
Kingsley beings speaking without any preamble, his tone somehow more serious than the message he sent. “There’s been an attack.” The Aurors shift nervously. “The neo-Death Eaters claimed responsibility for it through a note left at the scene -
Harry has to suppress a laugh at Malfoy’s attempt to hide his inner gossip. “It’s really nothing.”
He sits up, and with one hand on Longbottom’s shoulder, gently shakes him awake. Longbottom grumbles and wipes at his eyes.
"Go!" Sophia yells as she scoops up an armful of more snow and begins sprinting toward the opposing team’s half-finished fort, giving Malfoy a wide berth.
Ron puts an arm around her. "We have an announcement to make."
She nods and muses. "A night of promise and excitement."
"We don't want you to get hurt. Or, actually, we don't want
Two days pass, and Snowdonia thaws a little, at their feet. Draco leads the group panting up hills, scrambling down valleys, and wading through streams. They catch fish, they climb the scraggly trees, and they laugh at each other among the branches.
“Cedric Diggory ring a bell?”
“Play anything, then!”
“Oh.”
“Right.” But then Harry remembers. “But I also didn’t eat that much for dinner, or for lunch. Or for breakfast…” he trails off reflecting on his extraordinarily poor life decisions. It’s a wonder that he even had anything to throw up at all.
Draco nods. “Muggles can be quite resourceful. And it happens to be in our favor, as our dragons use it frequently.”
Rose joins in, too, chanting. "I want to go! I want to go!"
Draco steps forward, careful to keep his movements slow and deliberate, and holds out his hand. “A pleasure.” They shake. Longbottom’s hand is cold and damp. “We can set out at any time, so let me know when you’re ready. Or if you have any other questions.”
Malfoy allows his hand to be held for a split second longer than Harry thought he would. “I look forward to it then,” he says without a single note of sarcasm in his voice. He promptly turns on his heel, disappears down a side alley, and is gone with a
And even though he must be tired from the straight two hours that he's been performing, he still doesn't lose his composure in the face of everyone begging for his attention. He gives them what they want - picture, autograph, hug - without ever letting the smile slip from his face.
"W-why?"
“Thanks.” He leaves.
A round of laughter makes its way around the table, not only from the said children, but also from her grandchildren - at least the ones who have been following the conversation. Harry has to hide a laugh behind his glass of water, and Draco smiles too. He seems more relaxed now, his shoulders no longer tense, his legs no longer crossed nervously, and his hands no longer fidgeting at the buttons of his shirt.
Harry knocks. He waits for a full minute. There is no sign of movement from within, and the piano music continues. He tries the door and his heart drops when the knob turns easily. He dashes in, blood rushing to his head and right hand going for his wand.
She beams back. “I’m free.”
Their heads.
Hesitantly, he agrees, setting the drinks down and taking his seat. In the distance, Harry notices that the rest of their group have emerged from the restrooms. Belle follows his gaze and understands.
“Alright.” Harry stands, deposits Lucy into Ion’s outstretched arms, and grabs Draco’s hand. “Let’s go.”
Madame Maxine may be making an appearance as well, taking Hagrid along with her. Ever since becoming acquainted at her and Hagrid’s wedding, she’s been quite taken with Draco - they have tea every other week. Harry thinks they have some kind of French heritage-related kinship.
But Jenny isn't backing down. Though Robards has wasted no time in raising his voice, standing up from his chair, and pacing angrily back and front in the front of the room, Jenny remains seated in her chair, her voice the same level, same tone, and her face the same expression as always - cool, collected, somewhat indifferent but not uninterested at the same time. Harry supposes that to go on the ultra-top-secret missions - which are rumored to be spy missions to the Ministries of different countries - she has had to learn how to keep her cool no matter which balding blockhead tries to speak over and silence her. "I agree with you that our tactics during the Second War were ineffective. But all that tells us is that we need to change it. And that's precisely what I'm advocating and have been advocating for since the First War, which you would know if you had been there for either of the two." She pauses a little bit to take a small sip of her water, time perfectly to let the insult fully sink into Robards' brain. And when it does, the effects are immediate and obvious: reddened ears, the clenching of the hands, and his quickened breath.
Harry turns to the horizon, to their friends and their flashing limbs. Above, the clouds part and unveil the sun.
Harry’s voice, when he speaks, parts the heavy summer air. Half-proclamation, half-confidence, all melody: “Because it’s you.”
Before Ginny can respond, a few more adults straggle in, bleary-eyed and no doubt very hungover: Molly, Arthur, and Fleur. Harry's ambient headache throbs in solidarity with theirs.
“You’re going to do great.” She and Teddy are beaming. “Harry, do bring me back some souvenirs. I’ve always wanted to visit Austria.”
Fat tears squeeze out of Hermione’s eyes but she stays silent, never taking her eyes off of Harry. When she opens her mouth to speak again, it’s only a whisper. “I’m sorry Harry. I’m so sorry.”
“I just haven’t been in contact with him in a while, that’s really it.”
“Well. She’s well.”
"Those were baggy."
Next chapter is the Epilogue!
The kitchen isn’t sealed off from the living room, so Harry can see the black counters and a dining table with nothing but a maroon tablecloth with white trim thrown over it. The bathroom door is closed and the bedroom, which Malfoy has entered, seems to be similarly red-themed like the rest of the space - at least from what Harry can see in the small crack between the door and its frame.
"Good evening. How are you two doing tonight?" Harry recognizes her as Belle, the owner of the club.
Malfoy drags the bench out from underneath and sits though it groans in protest underneath him. The kids gather around, opting to sit on the floor rather than the kitchen chairs. Harry plops down on one of them and the woman from before rejoins them, taking a seat in a chair beside him with the baby quiet and still in her arms. She has two other children in tow - one a toddler and one who seems about the same age as the older girl who received the notes.
Something claws up Draco’s throat and makes its nest there, refusing to be swallowed back down. He accidentally meets Harry’s eyes across the flames, and the momentary touch stings him.
"Harry! Draco!" Hermione calls up to them from below, her wand out.
"Yep." He pops the 'p' at the end with his lips, drawing Harry's attention there.
And when he gets there, he understands why he was in such a rush to leave. And why he insisted that Robards come with him. Gathered at his doors - which are closed, thankfully - is a massive horde of reporters from all sorts of different Wizarding news outlets, many of which Harry has never heard of before. What appears to be the most pushy one has a shirt with
“You and Draco ever go ice-skating? Was it big enough?”
“For class today, I want you all to pair up: physics textbooks with the urtexts, and as a team research one of the many links between music and magic that you read about in preparation for this class. Chord progressions - both Western and Eastern - Majors, and Minors - all and more are available as options to look into. Feel free to consult any arithmancy notes you may possess. See me if you have questions. I am happy to help.” With that, Malfoy takes a seat at his desk and pulls out some parchment.
“Even when
They all shake hands with her and exchange greetings and pleasantries.
“Harry?” Draco says from the bed as Harry’s doing some last minute packing.
Longbottom bobs his head, looking back out at the view: the mountains tall and jutting, the valleys dizzying. Over the edge of the path they walk is a steep drop, leading to a river, curving around a distant hill and out of sight. The sun has begun its fall, though its light remains strong. Something calls across the valley, its echo lonely and small.
“Why didn’t you ever play at Hogwarts?”
Harry glances out the window and spots Rose, Hermione, and Ron outside. Rose is playing with her broom again, with her parents trying to spot her. Harry watches as she tumbles from her broom, laughing and smiling while Ron and Hermione hover anxiously.
Whatever Draco thought Harry was going to say next, this definitely did not enter the realm of possibility for him. His eyebrows rise high, then higher, then higher again. His eyes are wide, and Harry swears his hair starts standing on end too, like a cat.
“I think you need the opposite of that to make kids happen.”
It can’t be, it must be.
The first thing he does is crush all of them into a group hug. The children huddle with him, some breaking out into tears. The baby is awake now, and wails in Angelica’s arms.
The house is too quiet. Now that Kreacher isn't preparing food any longer, Harry doesn't even have the ambient noise from the kitchen to vaguely keep track of time. His perceptions seem altered, unstable, and Harry feels his stomach slowly tie into knots as his heartbeats beat by.
Harry wishes he could stand and clap for the woman, but Ron’s firm, restraining hand on his thigh indicates that it might not be an entirely appropriate time for it.
"I know," Harry says miserably.
Harry gives her a quick nod in response.
He receives the news via owl. A note, written in his mother’s shaky hand:
“What do you mean, you ‘haven’t been in contact with him’? You two are friends.”
Toys practically cover the floor of the playroom; everything from Legos to dolls to toy cars pile on top of each other. A few squashy-looking armchairs stand in the corner with a tarp thrown over the top, creating a tent of some sort. When they enter, three children tumble out.
When he’s done, Draco turns and spots Harry. He’s in front of him in a flash.
At one point Harry even takes the Map back out to check on Malfoy’s dot - just as he used to do in fifth year. The dot is resting comfortably in the spare room in the Astronomy tower. Harry keeps staring at it in hopes that it might give him some clue as to what is going through its owner’s mind. He thought he had Malfoy figured out from their meeting yesterday, but he never even gave a
“And I know this isn’t an excuse, just a reason, but I pushed you away because...I was afraid. Of disappointing you.” Harry takes a deep breath. “Because I was turning into someone I wasn’t proud of, I thought it would be better if you...weren’t around. To see it.”
“I’m not hungry.”
“D-draco, you didn’t have to-” Harry begins, but Draco cuts him off:
It’s surreal, Harry thinks, to be on the other side of the glass, to be the one giving comfort in the relationship. He struggles against guilt -
And they do just that. In the end, Molly and Arthur are the only ones outside of their group of friends who are going tonight - the rest of the Weasleys are either too tired from last night or already gone - like Charlie and Ion, whose trip back was rescheduled to today due to an incident at the reservation that required their immediate attention.
“This isn’t pity, Malfoy.”
“Merry Christmas, Rose.” He smiles fondly at her.
"Y-e-s?"
He leans forward with interest. “Is it fun? What do you do? How long have you worked there?”
"But-"
Draco smiles gracefully. "I should be thanking all of you for coming and supporting the kids. Thank you for caring."
It's Harry's turn to laugh now, and right as he begins to, he spots a glint of gold in the distance and almost chokes.
Harry doesn't remember the last time he was so captivated by music. Or by anything, for that matter. It seems that every time Draco's fingers touch the keys, more than just music springs out: joy, light, warmth. These abstract feelings engulf Harry in waves but he finds that he already knows how to swim, how to breathe easy in them.
Suddenly, her attention snaps back to Harry. “Uncle Harry! Can we go flying now?” Without even waiting for an answer, she screws up her face and begins begging: “Pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease-”
, Harry thinks.
They dig in. The soup is good (potato and chicken), and in between sips Harry thinks about Malfoy, and about how best to bring up their
It reminds him of the night before, when Harry had walked in on Malfoy playing the piano for Andromeda.
“Er-I guess I’d better-” Harry makes for the door, but Malfoy grabs his wrist.
Harry takes her hand and shakes it, gripping it firmly. "Harry. We're friends from school."
"Are we ready?" Hermione asks. She's added a black and white striped shawl to her look, and she tosses it over her shoulder.
“My pleasure.”
but will always prefer the smooth roll of a pen any day.
A pang of guilt racks Harry. He had been so caught up in Draco and Hogwarts that he had completely forgotten about the news until they announced it.
Harry whips his head back around. She's done, and the drinks are lined up on the bar.
He presses a kiss to the base of Draco’s neck.
- and follows close behind.
"Do you bartend?" Ginny looks him up and down. "I could see you as a bartender."
"Very well." And with that, Kreacher apparates with a pop.
NOTE: Please mind the suicide attempt mention content warning in this chapter in particular. As it was previously, the mention in question will be clearly partitioned off, and not reading it will not significantly impact your experience.
"Thank you. Coming, Harry? Or would you like to forfeit now?" His voice is taunting, teasing, and he's saying and doing all of this knowing full well what Harry's reaction will be. It's at times like these that Harry fears that Draco is actually fully aware of the effect that he has on Harry - and is playing it to his advantage.
Draco nods. “Alright. Help me get the supplies.”
Draco sits up.
Time passes, and soon, heavy with wine and shitty vodka, breaths slow and ease into sleep. Beside Draco, Harry lies flat on his back, his eyes fixed on the sky. Where their arms nearly touch feels like a line of heat.
Malfoy doesn’t respond, just continues to sit on the couch, still completely naked. Harry throws the clothes back to him. “Put those on.”
Draco is glaring at him now, tears still leaking out of his eyes. “You think I ha-haven’t already thought of that? When they throw me in Azkaban wh-who will help
"Sure. A-and you can call me Harry."
When the door opens, a cheerful-looking young woman stands in the doorway with a baby in her arms and a toddler clutching her skirts. “Draco!” Her eyes flit to Harry. “And a friend. Come in, come in. Sorry for the state of things; Steven made a mess on the floor again.” As soon as she closes her mouth, the baby begins to wail. “Oh dear, I think it’s time for a diaper change. Come in, come in, I’ll just be a moment.”
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?”
“And?”
He’s bored.
It happens on a Thursday night while they’re clearing the table after a particularly tasty stir-fry dinner.
“Mm, hey.” Right arm, left arm, Draco stretches and pops his neck.
“I have to warn you,” Harry begins slowly, “that the training is extremely difficult.”
"You came on a really good night then - Draco, our performer tonight, is a real fan favorite."
The light of the candle flickers across Draco’s face as he speaks, drawing Harry’s attention to the sharpness of his cheekbones, the fullness in his lips…
“No. Jack turned himself in.”
“Ready, Draco?”
“Not that I blame you. Many have had your exact reaction. It’s the War Orphanage that I was assigned to volunteer at as part of my sentence, ten years ago. Though most of the kids have aged out. Now, it’s mostly a normal orphanage.” With one fluid motion Malfoy brings his coffee to his lips.
After exchanging farewells, Draco waves his friends off, and closes the door. He hesitates a moment, then joins Harry in the kitchen, where the latter is putting the last of the dishes away.
"Yes! Yes!"
She looks up and over her glasses as they enter. "Ah." She reaches into her drawer and pulls out a brown envelope and holds it out to Malfoy. "I've received rave reviews."
Now that her job of preventing Harry from making grievous fashion choices is done, Ginny walks over and joins Luna on the window seat. She gives her a quick peck, leans her head on her shoulder, and asks, "What are you looking at, love?"
"Here." He slides a stack of files across the table to Harry. "Do you mind processing the intel on the members as they come in and make sure our records are up to date?"
“...Goodnight.”
Ginny snaps, “She’s my date, Harry.”
He could play this game. Draco fancies he could even play it well. And they were on his home turf, now. He hoists his pack higher on his back. “Good. Follow me.”
"Beyond belief. The Christmas performance is always the worst one. So many high expectations."
Wizardkind has long played a critical role in the perpetuation of the dragon species. Perhaps in response to the worsening air quality due to the Muggle Industrial Revolution, dragons began laying broods with thicker and thicker shells to protect the embryos inside. However, the eggs eventually reached a thickness that the babies inside are unable to break through - leaving them trapped inside, starving to death.
Harry feels his body heat up with anger. Mostly because he and everyone else in the bloody meeting room including Robards know full well that when the Second War was becoming a reality, he chose to fuck off to America the whole time to go into hiding. He didn't want to deal with any of it, and Harry privately suspects that he actually sympathized with the Death Eaters, but wanted to position himself like a vulture to swoop in and take over whatever's left at the end of it all. If his suspicions are correct, then Robards has even
Affronted, Harry cries, “
“That’s probably why. It hit you hard.”
A photo is taken of them - by which news outlet, Harry doesn’t know. He doesn’t care.
“I want you to have them.”
“Ye-yeah.”
They go back to discussing strategy in hushed whispers and Harry takes the opportunity to glance over at the other team - and most importantly, Malfoy.
Harry opts to stand to the side and wait for the line to die down before approaching. After a few minutes, Draco emerges from backstage and his fans swarm him. This time, however, they don't seem to be asking for autographs.
Harry eats his breakfast (a single fried egg and a glass of almost-expired orange juice), does his laundry for the first time in weeks, and attacks his kitchen pantry with plenty of
"Excellent. Harry, mind bringing the brooms over?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah. Of Death Eaters. We call them ‘neo-Death Eaters.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wh-what?”
“The good and the bad,” Harry whispers.
The emotion rising in Draco is so great it's like a dam bursting.
Draco Malfoy’s eyes widen almost comically before he quickly regains his composure. They nod civilly in a silent agreement:
"Yes, and he's just as amazing as your friends probably said. And nice too - I met with him once backstage, got his autograph, and talked for a bit. He's a good bloke, I think. Humble, too."
“Why me?”
"Haven."
"Yes, and it's quite rewarding, at least for me. I enjoy engaging with my audience - especially the regulars"
“You’re right, it’s not the same.” Harry presses a kiss to Draco’s forehead. It’s sweaty, but familiar on Harry’s lips. “But that doesn’t make it hurt any less.”
Though he resists it, Draco feels himself slipping. He’s not as young as he once was; the floor could wreak havoc on his back, and they still have three days of hiking to go.
"Yeah, he actually invited me. Us." Harry winces a little at his mistake.
This seems to catch Malfoy off guard. “A-an orphanage. I’m going to volunteer.”
The children groan, but leave him alone once Harry promises to play with them after dinner. Lucy, however, stays with him.
ed the whole time.”
Lucy and Rose are not alone - most of the other children express either mild or intense interest.
The other nod in agreement. "He's not as bad as he used to be," Ginny muses. "I didn't want to hex him every second he continued talking, for example."
“How’s Malfoy?”
“Why? It’s cold!”
“Yes, even then.” Draco closes his eyes, and feels the breeze as it picks up. “I don’t want to be trapped, never changing.”
She looks between the two men, both earnestly trying to curry her favor, and laughs - completely tickled by all the attention.
When Harry gets back home - no, to Draco's flat - dinner's already ready and waiting for him. And so is Draco. As they eat, Draco asks about his day, chats about progress he's made in his research - perhaps a little excessively. In fact, it occurs to Harry halfway through the meal that Draco's more chatty than usual.
Harry also vaguely remembers Ron talking to him about it too, but as Harry didn't really give a shit whether or not the Ministry of Magic's research department matched up to others, he wasn't really listening.
The blonde man simply groans underneath Harry and doesn’t open his eyes. Frantic, Harry feels around the back of Malfoy’s head for any blood or other signs that his skull might have just smashed into the ice, but finds nothing. His hair is, indeed, as soft as it looks.
“Harry!” It’s Teddy, yellow-eyed and blue hair styled into an elaborate braid. “Come in, quick! I’m about to beat Draco at chess!”
Harry does the same.
They’re all shouting at and over each other, each one trying to be the first outlet to break what they probably sense is a juicy story. But Robards - though he is an asshole and a tyrant - is the best in possibly the entire Ministry with dealing with the press. He’s been doing it for several decades, after all.
“Yes,” Rose answers quite seriously. “You said last time that you were going to teach me how to fly!” Hermione groans; Harry had gotten Rose a toy broomstick for her fourth birthday earlier this year and she hasn’t stopped talking about it since.
Harry lifts an eyebrow. “Yeah sure, I’ll drop by around seven.”
“I guess soon that’ll be my maiden name soon,” he jokes.
The true horror comes when, spreading like a second skin, his old, old fantasies live again. The yearning he’d felt daily, hearing their laughter tables away, watching them walk the grounds together from a window up high. His shameful desire, the endless
“Who other the Minister is in his office?”
“May I have a word?” His upper lip is quivering.
Robards, who has been silently sulking behind Kingsley this whole time, adjourns the meeting, "That's all we have for you this morning. Remember, stay focused and report anything - and I mean anything - suspicious directly to me. Don't wait. We need to get them before they do real damage, got it?"
"Harry! Harry!" Victoire, Bill and Fleur's oldest daughter, tugs on his free hand toward their massive heap of toys in the corner. "Come play with us! We're just starting."
you want Uncle Harry to teach you?”
“No.”
Kingsley opens his mouth to speak, but Robards cuts him off, visibly irritated now. Sometimes, Harry swears he just gets off by riling people up and then debating them. "It would cause massive panic. Muggles wouldn't know what to do with the information - look at what happened when we told them about Sirius Black all those years ago. Their Prime Minister couldn't do anything! And during the Second War, too! Muggles can't defend themselves against magic!"
Draco swallows, his throat dry. The gloves grow warm in his hands. “Is this why you left her?”
“Of course. You
"Thank you. I take it you enjoyed it?"
"Yeah?"
Harry grins. “Just tell me what’s what, Draco.”
“I’ve got you, I’ve got you,” Harry murmurs.
Finally: “Okay. I’ll consider it.”
The atmosphere is slightly more relaxed today, with some light conversation happening between the men behind Draco. Harry, he notices, doesn’t contribute much. Longbottom, once again, walks beside him at the front, asking him questions about the flora and fauna around them, and about the geography of the land.
vomit. The piece are beginning to come together now. “I Side-Alonged you. But only after you threw up in the alley.”
“Friends?” Neville holds out his hand.
“What about you?” The dreaded question.
“She wants ter get married.”
“It is,” Draco says, pleased, “I thought so, too, when I first learned.”
And with that, Draco carefully sets the microphone on the piano and sits on the bench. His hands are piled in his lap and his eyes are closed.
They're cheering?
They’ve prepared for this. They knew the call would be coming any time - in the recent week, the once-flawless obsidian surface of each of the five eggs has begun to show small, white cracks.
A few minutes pass with only the crunch of their boots on dirt and gravel for conversation. Then, Longbottom asks, “How did you get into this line of work, Malfoy?”
Draco takes a deep breath before continuing. "As you probably already know, they lost their home - the Harmony Orphanage - a few weeks ago. This concert is to raise money to buy a new, better home for them."
"S-o-o...." She begins, her voice drawing out that one vowel for an absurdly long time before she actually starts talking. "How was last night?" When Harry looks over at her, she's wiggling her eyebrows at a pace that he could never hope to mimic. Her voice has entered suggestive territory, and Harry has a growing suspicion about what she's referring to.
Malfoy is red in the face, his hair sticking out at odd angles. “You too.”
It’s completely frozen over - ice maybe six or seven feet thick - and the afternoon sunlight glints off of it. Footprints and imprints of faces and bodies in the snow indicate that Malfoy wasn’t the first to have the same idea, but there doesn't seem to be any students around right now.
Only a few people are seated at the bar, to Harry's surprise. The bartender, a young, fresh-faced woman dressed in a flowy blouse and a white hijab greets him as he walks up.
Upon impact, the snow explodes - sending bits of it all over his fellow fort-builder's face - sending him toppling over to join his compatriot on the icy ground.
And his father. After the Kiss and the seven years that followed, sitting patiently at the door, waiting for the reprieve of Death to come knocking.
over the break?"
Outside the window, Harry can see that a fresh layer of snow has fallen overnight. Now, he suspects it almost covers the front door. But it's not snowing now - on the contrary, it seems like a nice day, sunny, with minimal wind. A redbird perches on the window ledge and regards him through the glass, cocking its head.
Harry muses. He’s only been there once or twice in all the years he’s lived in the neighborhood. Harry makes a mental note to visit sometime.
Carefully, he draws the egg pick from one of the bags. It’s a slender thing, shaped like a pickaxe, but with one blunt end and one end like a hook. He feels the dragons above track his every movement.
It’s only at this point that Harry realizes that he’s practically straddling Malfoy. Harry scrambles to his feet with some effort, and offers a hand. “Sorry.”
“Was any of it true?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well," Draco down at the table and starts tracing the pattern in the tablecloth. "It was the first time I have ever applied my research. About the magical capabilities of music. But I feel like-." He stops and takes a deep breath. "I feel like it didn't work too well."
every ten minutes that he bought one for him. “It is. You wanna come down?”
“Okay, got it.”
Finally, the crowd thins out and the line shortens and Harry can finally see him up close.
“Set these down here,” Draco instructs Walker and Harry, who obey. Then, he runs up to Prasad. Behind them loom massive shapes: five grown dragons, sitting on their haunches at the edge of the nest, their slitted eyes luminescent and cutting in the heavy dark. In the crater is Amira, preparing the eggs for delivery based on their varying levels of readiness - just according to plan.
Beneath the Christmas tree are scattered dozens and dozens of presents - big and small and with wrapping paper in every pattern and color imaginable. It's a true testament to the Weasleys' growing wealth that they are able to compile so many gifts each year. Arthur has been promoted multiple times since the War, Molly has begun to sell custom sweaters with impressive commercial success, Bill is a regional manager for Gringotts, Fleur is a model for a popular Wizarding cosmetics company, Charlie and Ion are eking out a good living at the dragon reservation, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes is a smash-hit abroad, Percy is a higher up in the International Magical Office of Law in the Ministry, Audrey is the youngest member on Wizengamot in centuries, Hermione is a leading activist and speaker for nonhuman creature and werewolf rights, Ron is an Auror, and Ginny is the internationally acclaimed Seeker for the Holyhead Harpies. The days in which the Weasley's were known solely for their poverty are over.
"Isn't that a sign that you're doing something right?"
Harry takes a seat at the Head Table next to Hagrid. “Good morning.”
Once safely on the ground, Draco and Harry lie in the grass for a bit, breathing heavily.
Though the sun has long set at this point, when Harry apparates to the scene, he has to momentarily shield his eyes from the sudden influx of light. Fire. The building in front of him is on fire and looks like it has been for quite some time; the entire right half has caved into itself and ash and soot and sparks shower onto the street below.
“Great! I’ll-uh-pick you up at four tomorrow?”
"How's Gawp?" Hermione, in a desperate attempt to change the conversation,  continues her questions.
Draco frowned.
With one hand on his friend’s chest, Harry stares out, his profile serious and hidden. Draco follows his gaze, but sees only the pale edge of the world.
The reply comes easily: “Of course. Always.”
But before Harry has any chance to defend himself, someone taps him on the shoulder. When he turns around, before him stands Neville Longbottom.
Harry’s stomach ties itself into knots at the thought of all his plans coming to fruition, and it’s not just because of the stress of planning a party involving both Muggles and Wizards. He’s got something special planned, and he hasn’t told anyone quite yet - not even Ron or Hermione.
“Do you want to go?” He asks.
“I-what?”
Thankfully, his cubicle is nestled in the corner of the floor, away from all the hubbub. Because he's not actually involved in any of the efforts to apprehend the Death Eaters, Harry's surprised to find a memo hovers outside his door when he reaches his door. He snatches it out of the air, pushes open his door, and collapses in his chair. The memo reads:
Is this where you’ve been this whole time?!” Neville’s getting agitated now, his voice getting louder. Harry glances nervously around him and hopes no one is eavesdropping.
Harry feels a blush spread from his neck to his ears. “Was I really
Hours fly, and the sun slides down, down, down, until it kisses the earth once more. They arrive at a small plateau, the grass here wild and thick, and settle in - the group of men visibly relieved.
He pulls his arms out, and wipes at his sweat. “Have I?”
“Ye-yeah? I’ve just been wondering what you’ve been up to.”
"Incredible...to think that this is what he's been doing since Azkaban..."
Suddenly defensive, Harry retorts hotly, "I just want to. You all just said so - he's changed-!"
There’s a shush of fabric as Harry turns his head to look at Draco. “You really hate that idea, don’t you?”
They exchange slightly panicked looks. “We’re...building up to it,” Hermione says.
“I need your advice on something.”
was becoming too much.
Draco gathers the cards and fits them neatly back into the box. He tucks them into his pack, and when he’s done, he stares out the dark window, refusing to make eye contact. If Harry Potter has something to say, then he can say it first, and Draco will wait. He has learned to be quite good at it.
“Malfoy.” He opens his eyes. Harry is staring down at him, his face shadowed. “Thank you. For what you said, and for this trip. You really helped get my head straight.”
"Great. Meeting adjourned," Robards practically growls at the end before storming out the room. Kingsley lifts an eyebrow at the aggressive display, but gives no other indication that Robards is acting strangely in any way. Harry wonders what their one-on-ones must be like. Perhaps it's better if he didn't know.
Same floppy hair, maybe a little thinned out now, same round eyes, same broad shoulders. The one thing Harry can’t verify to be the same is his smile, mainly because Neville’s
Friday at 7pm can't come fast enough for Harry. If time were crawling along before, it seems to be barely inching its way now. He can't properly focus on his work - not that he really could before, but it's even worse now. Ron doesn't eat lunch with him anymore to distract him. Thursday is unbearable. Friday is almost excruciating.
By contrast, Harry's wearing a mustard-colored sweater that hangs a little too loose at the arms and that Ginny once called "uglier than Umbridge and Voldemort's lovechild,” some bootcut jeans - which he has also endured a lot of hate for, mainly from Ginny as well - and a loyal, but worn out, pair of runners.
“You too.”
Harry’s stuttering now. “W-wait. I don’t understand..?!”
Harry sits up. “I’d better get them in their beds.”
Only after Harry’s taken a shower, brushed his teeth, and climbed into bed does he think about Malfoy again. He remembers how he treated him - and now, hours later, Harry no longer understands why he reacted so violently. It was
Second stop is Hagrid’s hut, where Harry says his goodbyes to his half-giant friend and his dog, and they exchange presents before they leave. Harry gifts Cane a new collar as his old one is barely hanging on by a thread, and Hagrid a pair of giant couple’s mittens - both wrapped, of course. Hagrid’s gift to him is small, but comfortably weighted. The two promise not to open each other’s presents until the next day. Malfoy is surprisingly calm during this exchange, and though he and Hagrid don’t exchange any more words than ‘Hello’ and ‘Goodbye,’ he
“I wanted-” Harry stops. Wets his lips. “I-I wanted….to work.” He finishes lamely.
A snort. “Fuck off.”
He sighs and pushes the hair out of his face, giving in immediately because he knows from experience that Harry won’t let up until he does. “Fine.”
"What are you playing?"
She whistles. “Sounded like a fancy one. Draco told me it had a lake on campus?”
“Y-you first.” Malfoy gives Harry a little push from behind, suddenly acting nervous.
Looking at Lucas, a young, black, talented kid, Harry feels a tightness in his chest. If he becomes an Auror - which is already assuming he’ll be able to brave the training and initiation process - he’ll no doubt wither away like Harry has. The one difference would be that Harry is privileged enough to, even after all his failures and mental breakdowns on the clock, still be offered a cushy Auror-in-name-only job. Hell, Harry could survive for the rest of his life just by living on his parents’ money and the free shit offered to him in exchange for endorsements and public appearances. Harry hazards a guess that Lucas doesn’t have the same opportunities.
He falls.
Happy Friday! By this time next week I'll be in China visiting relatives, and I'll be over there for a few weeks. I'm expecting my update schedule not to change too much - still Mon/Wed/Fri - but the timing might be very off due to the massive time zone difference so I apologize in advance for that. Anyways, please enjoy Chapter 14! :)
He's the first one out of the office when five o'clock rolls around. As he passes his coworkers' cubicles, he peeks in and sees them sitting on the floor, robes off, stuffing their faces with a quick supper while poring over reports. A few cubicles are completely empty, untouched. Ron's is a veritable mess, but Harry can't tell if it's any more so than usual. With some effort, Harry forces himself to keep moving.
"It's kind of...hot."
“Maybe? I-uh-we were just at a restaurant so he might be back home now.”
It’s a simple space, Draco knows it. Not much decoration, and only the bare minimum of furniture: a loveseat, a coffee table, a dining table, and two chairs. In their shared bedroom stand two queen beds, separated by a nightstand. They face a large bureau, which Draco supposes they will have to share, and the far wall opens to the back deck, where two metal chairs stand, overlooking the communal vegetable garden.
A beat. Draco takes a deep breath. “What are you doing here, Potter?”
“Oh.”
"Oh!" Hagrid swallows and sputters a little in his haste to answer. "McGonagall didn' tell yeh?"
And he begins.
As some sort of compromise with himself, Harry leans against the wall and digs out the Marauder's Map that he had stuffed in his back pocket. The dot named Draco Malfoy, flanked by several other dots, moves through the castle at a steady pace. It’s not an illusion. No charms or trickery. That’s Draco Malfoy in the flesh, looking equal parts dignified and approachable in his long, flowy robes. Harry suddenly isn't sure what he's looking for, so he folds the Map back up and makes his way back to Hagrid's hut.
Draco waits from Harry to catch himself and step back, but he doesn’t. Their heads are so close that their breaths seem to mingle in the air.
Harry, sounding abashed, says, “We didn’t really think about it when we booked the trip. The wedding just happened to be scheduled for the spring.”
The final piece is sad. Harry doesn't know how jazz can be sad, (he thought that was what Blues were) but Draco pulls it off. The piece still makes everyone want to sway and dance, but the notes follow one after the other glumly, wistfully, yearning for the ones that have already been played.
Eyes narrowing, Harry asks, “Why?”
Sunlight streams in from all sides. The lobby is empty, save for a few dusty couches, the receptionist desk, the temporary receptionist, and Draco.
His brain taunts him by bring back the fantasies he used to have when he was still dating Ginny, or even when he was hunting Horcruxes. A big family. Ginny by his side. Their children would be friends with Rose, of course. They’d all meet at the Burrow for Christmas and the children would play together with their presents while the adults would chat and drink in their new sweaters.
The children ‘ooh’ and ‘aah’ at that, and their parents, the adult Weasleys, grin. What they know and the children don't of course, is that the Malfoy and Weasley families have been rivals and enemies for decades now, but to the children, the divide is an artifact of the past. Suddenly, Harry feels old.
His voice comes out several octaves higher and more strained than Harry’s ever heard it. “I know that!”
Harry doesn’t need to be told twice. He shoves the papers back into the folder and pulls on the robes draped over the back of his chair.
"Now pick a color."
Hagrid tries his best to explain it to Harry, but the half-giant doesn’t have a good enough grasp on the topic himself so his efforts are in vain. At the end of his explanation, all Harry can gather is that there’s magic in music somehow.
This time, when Malfoy closes the door, he’s waving Harry goodbye with a stiff smile and blush on his face.
"And he's much better than his father was at his age, that's for sure." Arthur shudders as he seems to think back to his encounters with young Lucius Malfoy.
Harry checks a few of the decorations with the more complex spells - silver tinsel twisting in the air like dragons, a Christmas tree on the second floor corridor charmed to bellow out various Celestina Warbeck Christmas hits, and the smattering of mistletoe clippings hanging in doorways that quiver in anticipation when people come close. At one point, Peeves bursts in through the ceiling and promptly crashes into all the tinsel and knots them together. It takes Harry almost an hour to untangle them, even with magic, and once he does, it’s suppertime.
He smiles slightly, and turns toward Draco again, his face like ash. “How did you do it? Know me like that?”
“....Fine.” Since when has Harry ever been able to resist Draco Malfoy?
from time to time so he doesn’t get blown off course. He hasn’t missed Christmas decorating upkeep with Hagrid for the past 6 years, and he doesn’t plan on starting now.
"Just trust me." Ginny pats his back. "Let's get Mom and Dad and go, or we'll be late."
Harry doesn’t hesitate for a moment and wraps Hagrid in a hug and laughs into his shoulder. “It’s about time!”
, he decides. Hangovers are taking him longer and longer to get over, as he’s discovered in recent years. Harry doesn’t want to risk showing up hungover to his meetup with Malfoy.
Harry hesitates, but Malfoy doesn’t. “An old friend,” he replies smoothly.
“Welcome to Snowdonia Dragon Refuge!” Prasad calls, their voice downright saccharine.
But all of that doesn’t stop him from already feeling the hangover beginning in his temples. He groans and splashes some water on his face.
“You’re shaking.”
"What?" Harry almost forgets to whisper. "Draco did this? Why?"
They don’t even turn to look when he approaches. Angelica, the oldest girl, is standing silently holding a sleeping baby close. Dan, the oldest boy, is holding hands with two of his orphan siblings and staring at the ground. The rest are huddled around them, clinging onto each other’s clothing. Their caretaker, Pat, is relaying what happened to an Auror Harry recognizes to be Jones, the newbie who only ever wears Muggle suits to work. In fact, he’s in one now, looking entirely out of place among all the haggard faces and the scarlet Auror robes.
want?”
Draco laughs a little at that. He looks so pretty, holding the bouquet up against his green suit. "Thank you. Thank you all for coming. Sincerely."
He doesn't do any work for the rest of the day -  too busy drumming his fingers on his desk, biting his lip, and glancing periodically at his door, convinced that someone was going to bust in at any second.
But the nerves are getting to him today, Harry supposes. He opens the fridge and cabinets and even pokes around in the pantry that he can never summon up enough courage to clean, hoping Kreacher has been secretly hoarding an emergency ration of cornflakes. No such luck. All Harry finds is a carton of eggs with only one remaining. Harry is considering frying it when Spotty clicks her claws against his window.
Early summer, and Draco is sitting inside, out of the afternoon sun. He organizes their files and records behind the receptionist desk, and inwardly scowls at the haphazard sorting system that is no doubt Prasad’s doing. From his right, down the hall, he hears movement in Amira’s office - likely trying to get the onboarding material in order.
“Luna? What are you doing here?” Yet another friend he hasn’t seen in some time.
Draco stares at his gift. The craftsmanship is sublime, and the charm work is complex. With his thumb, he rubs the inside lining, and it’s smooth as cream.
"Where did you get this?" He finally speaks, his voice a little husky - maybe from sleep.
Hagrid lets out a booming laugh at that. “Muggle culture? Musical Theory is abou’ magic, ‘arry.”
Malfoy takes a minute to compose himself. It’s late, and through the window Harry can see that a snowstorm as picked up outside. But other than the faint whistling of the wind, this wing of Hogwarts is extraordinarily quiet.
Draco imagines it: him, dressed up, mingling among the dozens of Weasleys and Weasley-adjacents, and trying the finger food. Watching Harry wait for someone else. Listening to his vows for someone else. Watching him kiss someone else.
After discussing their trip to America for a little while - which cities they're visiting, what attractions they're seeing - a comfortable lull in the conversation descends on them. Harry looks over at Draco; he seems to be happier now that the conversation has moved on from him. Harry knows that everyone was just curious because no one had spoken to, or even seen Draco Malfoy since the War, but all the focused attention seemed to have tired Draco out quite a bit. Harry knows all too well what that feels like, so he squeezes Draco's hand in sympathy. The blonde looks at him, surprised, but not alarmed, and squeezes back. Harry can feel multiple people watching, trying to be subtle about it, but failing - Ginny being one of them
Harry looks up, then, and it’s only then that Draco realizes how close they are - Harry, leaning in, and Draco with his back to the doorframe. Those eyes of his, so very green. And in their depths, Draco sees himself reflected - small and nervous.
“W-Wait!” Malfoy flounders behind him and hugs Harry tight at the waist. “Okay. Now I’m ready.”
Draco sighs and touches Harry's face, shutting him up. "Let me finish. Then you can jump to whatever conclusions you want."
They sit in silence for a little bit, and during that time a gaggle of teens enter the cafe, order, and settle noisily in a booth in the far corner. Harry wears away at his bottom lip and all the while Neville continues staring out the window at nothing, not meeting his eyes.
He's digging through his pantry for an empty jar at least when he hears Draco say from the foyer. "It's just how I remember it."
Neville furrows his brows. “You two are dating, right?”
“Your friends, I heard?”
He shakes his head. “It’s not your fault. It’s all of ours.”
"Tempus." The time floats in the air in front of the two for a little bit before they pass it while walking and it disappears behind them. "Not late - yet."
Cheers.
“But if you pull some shit like this again, you’re in for it.”
“Yup. Apprentissin’ for Sprout now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Alone now, Hermione’s smile slips off quickly. “How are you feeling?”
“And you? What do you think?”
Despite his efforts to imagine what a "Musical Theory" class with Malfoy could be like, Harry can't conjure up anything. Perhaps Malfoy is teaching them piano? Or other instruments? A sudden image of the Hogwarts student body in dress robes playing an orchestral concert invades Harry's mind.
Unable to come up with a good response, Malfoy opts to just lightly punch Harry on the shoulder instead.
But there's nothing that could cheer Harry up now.
"Good evening," Draco thrusts the bouquet toward Harry, "Do you have a vase?"
"You made sure that wasn't the case."
The End! Thank you so much for reading, it really means a lot. I hope you've enjoyed the story and the characters as much as I have writing them!
Gordon and the extremely freckled boy named Robin nod and resume discussing something quietly among themselves - fort-building tactics, Harry assumes.
They cackle, their somber mood dissipating as fast as it had come. “The look on his face!” With that, they go back to their paperwork and administrative duties, muttering under their breath with a wide smile still plastered on their face.
The answer is immediate: “At the altar. Seeing her walk up.”
Ah....love...
Ava opens her mouth as if to respond to that, closes it, but then opens it again after a moment of hesitation. "Sorry - I don't mean to presume, and I know that Belle and I hate when people do that - but are you two...together?"
Harry wraps Draco in tighter, his arms like calm water, and gradually, Draco collects himself.
Very few of Malfoy’s personal effects seem to exist here. The only sign that the someone is currently inhabiting the space are the stacks of books on the table.
“Don’t,” Draco whispers, closing his eyes. That old pain, so old it’s like the ground on which Draco walks. Transparent and fragile: a bed of glass flowers.
“Nothing.” He adds, “I have the annual Christmas concert on Christmas day but that’s about it.”
Harry’s voice rises a few octaves in pitch. “Um. Maybe? How did you know?”
Andromeda settles back into her knitting, saying, “Oh it’s no problem. He’s just a little shy. Maybe…” she looks up at Harry with a little mischievous light in her eye, “next time? We could all have dinner together sometime later? When Teddy's here, too.”
Harry scrunches up his eyebrows. "But I'm being serious about what I say...?"
“When you lied, at the Manor, and didn’t give me away - that was a choice, too,” Harry says, tracing the eyes.
“Excellent.” Harry surveys the players. “Five on five?”
Gordon and Robin catch Harry and hold him as he lays there, catching his breath.
While Draco busies himself with the extensive looking list of wine on the back of the menu, Harry scans the food items for something he recognizes only to quickly fail because the entire menu is in french.
The chatter from inside stops all at once. Harry can hear a muffled "Is that-" before the voice is shushed by what sounds like several people at the same time. There are footsteps, and suddenly the door is flung open and it’s Ginny standing before them in the doorway.
Malfoy is silent. He just stands there for several moments, mouth slightly open, before turning back around and continuing to walk.
"His work with music is especially interesting," Hermione adds. Then, her smiles fades and slips off her face until she just looks sad. "Harry. What are you thinking?"
"Whatever," Harry mumbles.
“...Really.”
“Draco!” They run to Malfoy and crowd around.
"Good game."
"Really? That's really rare these days, I think. Humble talent? Such an unappreciated virtue, in my opinion."
His eyes are blown wide, wide enough that Harry can see his own face reflected in its gray. Draco’s mouth hangs a little bit open, his cheeks, ears, neck - all red.
He begins explaining the basics, and by the end, Harry thinks he has a pretty good grasp on Malfoy’s work. He first became interested in Arithmancy  in Hogwarts, and after he finished serving his five year sentence in Azkaban, he began making and playing music again and realized that music theory greatly coincides with some aspects of Arithmancy. “In fact,” Malfoy told Harry, his eyes bright, “Most successful musicians all around the world have been witches and wizards!”
Putting a hand on her stomach, Hermione opens her mouth to speak, but Molly has already caught on. Her mouth opens, and a shriek comes out.
“I know!” Malfoy stares at a knot in the wooden floor by Harry’s feet instead of actually making eye contact. “I was just...curious - about what he said to you at breakfast. You don’t have to share if you don’t want to, but,” he meets Harry’s eyes and puffs out his chest a little, “I think personal conflicts among faculty are ultimately a detriment to harmonious learning environments.”
“Draco…” Belle and Ava and Pat have already given Harry the rundown of how to deal with Draco when he gets like this - so focused on his work that he forgets to eat, to sleep, and to talk to anyone. The key is that Harry needs to be firm.
And judging from the hectic state of the entire department, no one would notice if Harry were to slack off a little bit, cut some corners. In fact, they still might not even notice if Harry left work altogether.
“Surprise!” A shower of sparks, green and silver, rain over Draco and settle like stars on his cloak.
They rise, and in no time, they are gone: a V heading inland, toward the climbing sun.
“It seems like fun.”
He did not envision this: doing paperwork for a living, going asleep alone every night, and living only because he doesn't have enough energy to do anything else.
"....Fuck off. Don't you have work you need to be doing?"
They end up in Malfoy’s mini-apartment on one of the vacant floors of the Astronomy Tower, and Harry tries not to think about the symbolism of the location.
“Hey, Lucas - and please, Harry is fine. Great job by the way. I learned a lot working with you and Sophia, even though I probably wasn’t much help.” Harry laughs.
Molly shakes her head. "Don't be sorry about that, dear. We were just concerned because, well, you haven't brought anyone over in a while."
“Then you’re back to work?”
“But you don’t have to.”
It feels like he’s been hollowed out.
“You’re doing well, Draco.”
“The place you mentioned earlier, what is that?”
“O-okay.” Draco whispers. “Okay.” He withdraws from Harry’s hug, leaving him cold. His mouth is set in a tight, grim line. The fire has mostly burnt out by now, but the glowing embers it leaves behind still cast shadows across Draco’s gaunt face.
"Same to you. It was almost like-"
He looks like he hasn’t slept.
It’s strange: without the distorting flow, Draco can see the twists and drops of the river more clearly. The piles of gravel, deposited along the sides during slow flow. The twigs and branches piled up, forming natural dams. Dozens of times Draco has walked this stream - washed his hands and face with its bounty - and all this while he didn’t know it at all.
The fire burns low, leaving only coals.
He cuts Harry off with a snarl, “Given my h-history? You th-think they would believe that I h-had no hand in th-this?”
“Uncle Harry!” - that’s the only warning he gets before a ball of energy collides into him.
Harry and Hermione try not to snort at that. Jazz is a Muggle genre invented by African Americans. Draco is the purest a pureblood wizard can be and a white, British man to boot.
Harry has to think for a little bit before answering. "I don't know. Something similar, I think - and I'm not just saying that. Grimmauld Place is a bit big for me. A cozier place might be a nice change of pace - something like Hagrid's hut could be nice, even."
Harry flings his door open and Draco Malfoy is standing there, in the flesh, on his doorstep with a bundle of flowers in his hand - Lilies. He's dressed up in a smart fitted shirt, slacks, and overcoat combo, and suddenly Harry can't meet his eyes.
“You won’t be thrown-”
Ginny winces. "How much did he have?"
Harry looks up, exasperated, “Like I said, we’re-”
P.S: taking applications for ppl willing to snog on a lumpy couch with me :,)
Though Harry's craning his neck, squinting his eyes, trying his absolute best to spot the Snitch, nothing sticks out to him. Not much movement, except from the gnomes beneath them, who are looking up at them warily, and from the Weasleys, who are still standing there watching them. The children wave, and Harry gives them a quick wave back.
But a hand grabs Harry's again. "I'll owl you," Draco promises, looking into Harry's eyes earnestly. But all Harry can focus on at this point is how their hands are touching. Harry feels a sort of deja vu.
“The very one.”
More cheers, louder this time.
“No. I only caught a little bit of what they were talking about.”
Harry spells the time and curses.
The sobs rack his body so hard Harry wonders if they're enough to break his
Since it’s Christmas Eve and the house-elves are preparing a big, fancy dinner tonight, touch-ups of the decorations is high on the priority list today. After a quick trip to Hogsmeade to run errands, Harry’s finally doing what he came here for in the first place. Hagrid teases him before they split up once they get to the castle, “Finally got yeh back from Malfoy.” He chuckles at his own joke and pounds Harry’s back - which almost sends him flying - and walks off and down the hallway.
Just then, with a pitter-patter of feet, Rose runs into the kitchen.
The double entendre seems unintentional, but it’s not lost on Harry. “Sorry-! I was just...surprised is all.”
After a long moment, Harry stands and makes for the door. As he turns the knob, he pauses, but only for a second. The door clicks shut, and Draco is alone.
"The Amber Tap. My next performance is tomorrow night, coincidentally."
All the words that had been bubbling up, frothing in his throat, die on Draco’s tongue. The slump of his shoulders, the deprecating smile - Draco has only seen Harry like this once before. A man, defeated by love.
With the combined help of Prasad, Walker, and Harry, they manage to move all the supplies to the edge of the nest. From here, however, Draco must move the rest by himself, and he must trade off with Amira to do it. The dragons are already wary of so many wizards in one place - and in such proximity, too. They only trust one at a time to approach the clutch.
One sleek, blonde eyebrow quirks up. “No.”
Clarke, Ron’s partner, walks up to them and she and Ron become immersed in conversation and discussion of the equipment they want to bring, etc. While they’re doing that, Harry realizes that he wasn’t given anything to do. Not a single responsibility.
Audrey nods at Draco. "I'm sorry we won't been able to make it this time, but I'm definitely interested." She nudges Percy and he stutters out his agreement, but it’s obviously half-hearted.
"Potter," Malfoy chides, "sometimes it's refreshing to ease off our reliance on magic, isn't it? Sans-magic tasks humbles us."
A blonde eyebrow lifts and the hint of a smile play on his lips. “Are you sure? Don’t you have something better to be doing with your time?”
“It was a hobby of mine, when I was a child. My father thought it would instill culture in me,” He chuckles and traces the rim of his coffee cup.
The waitress comes back with the wine and pours them two glasses before Draco can reply. When she leaves, he takes a sip from his glass and Draco does that same, but not before swirling it around a bit and taking a whiff.
"Poor dear, that's a lot of children for even two people to handle." Molly adds, smiling wryly and looking pointedly at her children. "Arthur and I could barely handle seven!"
Huffing and red-faced, Longbottom pierces the silence, “A-are we really going to the peak? It seems like...like a long ways away.”
“Perfect.” He announces before marching back to his desk and gathering up his belongings. “You’ll have to help me, then.”
“I know what you’re thinking, and it isn’t true,” he says.
“Would you ever want children?”
“Oh! I’m terribly sorry, dear Draco-oh.” She spots all of them. “Hello, everyone.”
“Well if you were keeping up, you would’ve caught that we’ve lost the Manor. My mother’s living in a quaint little cottage in the English countryside, now.” He pauses before changing the subject, “I remember the press was in an uproar around that time about you, now that I think about it.” Harry quirks an eyebrow at him and Draco hastily adds. “More so than the usual - ‘Harry Potter spotted having a spot of tea at half past three instead of three, his usual time!”
After taking a deep breath, Harry steels himself and knocks on the door.
“Please.” Hagrid pours. “How’s Madame Maxime?” There’s a clink and a splash as Hagrid’s hand falters, the tea landing outside the cup.
play with Cane while Hagrid and Harry talk.
Hermione doesn’t drink for obvious reasons, but Charlie, and Ion are the only other ones who abstain, partly because a Burrow Christmas without any sober adults is a disaster that no one wants to remember or repeat ever again, but mostly because Ion doesn’t drink because he’s Muslim, and Charlie has sworn it off as well since they first started dating. “I never did like the taste, anyways,” Charlie once confided in Harry the first time he introduced Ion to the family.
The two men trudge through the grass and funnel into Draco’s cottage. Draco’s coat, nightshirt, and pajama bottoms are soaked through, and Harry isn’t much better off. Draco lends Harry some clothing, and the pair take turns taking hot showers.
"That must be Bill," Fleur says while staring at the ceiling before following Molly into the kitchen.
It’s Harry who lets go first. “Thank you guys for staying with me. But you all need to get back too.”
Without any hesitation, Malfoy gives them the same gentle smile that Harry saw yesterday at the orphanage.
“Yes. Like being a Death Eater.”
"Shall we sit here?" Arthur asks the group, his hand resting on the chair back. It's one of the tables farthest from the stage, but seeing as the group didn't think to get here early like everyone else, they will have to settle. Once seated, Harry is tasked with getting drinks.
When Harry glances over to the orphan's table, he sees Pat rubbing at her eyes.
“My apologies,” Malfoy says with a twinkle in his eyes.
“I thought you were just having me on!”
"Stop...what?"
Once it's secured in place, directly under the spotlight, the same stagehand who pushed the piano it completely on his own goes back offstage and proceeds to to add a piano bench to join it. Next, with one fluid motion, he opens the top and props it up with a thin stick. Harry's amazed it doesn't break as soon as he takes his hands off. Finally, his job done, he leaves the stage the opposite way he came, and the stage is empty again, save for the new piano and bench combo.
“And-” Draco begins, but abruptly stops, tears rapidly collecting in his eyes.
"He's teaching a special course right now. Just for the holidays. Musical Theory, or sommat like that."
“Ha ha,” Harry says dryly, but he still hugs her back tightly. Ron gets in on it too, and the three of them just stand in the bathroom in a group hug for Merlin knows how long.
Draco nods, almost mechanically. “Yes. That’s fine.”
Hagrid settles back into his reclining chair with Cane gnawing at an alarmingly large bone at his feet. The fire crackles loudly, sounding like an invitation to Harry.
Ginny is the one to release the Snitch, since she also volunteered to be the referee. With a golden flash, it's gone from her hand immediately, but Harry's keen eye has remained intact through the years. He subtly follows it from the corner of his eye, but tries to make it seem as though he's lost it. Glancing at Draco, he realizes that, either the blonde's doing the same thing, or he actually doesn't know where the Snitch is.
The moon is high but clouded, so the light is but a sliver in the sky. Draco - the constellation - is shrouded. Perhaps it has slithered off the starred dome altogether.
And when it’s over, Malfoy stands up, smiles, and bows amidst applause.
“I wouldn’t want to be a constellation,” Draco admits. “With just one person, on display to the world, but unable to reach down.”
“Go ahead.”
He relaxes a bit, leans back in his chair, and reaches down to stroke Cane. They listen to the crackling of the flames for a bit, and, in the direction of the Forest, Harry hears rustling trees and wonders if it’s Gawp. Cane snores openly and his chest rises and falls with an intoxicating rhythm. Snow has started falling again, and the snowflakes cast shadows with the light slanting through the window.
She shakes her head sadly, as if in mourning. “I’ve been reading some Muggle literature, and they say that mental illness can be complicated.”
He's never really met with any of the neighbors on his street. They sometimes host block parties or sell cookies and lemonade in the summers, but Harry's never been. He justifies it to other people - mostly Hermione - by claiming that his neighbors might be freaked out over a neighbor they never knew they had joining their events, but it's really because he's never in the mood to shoot the breeze with random Muggles.He’s barely ever in the mood to shoot the breeze with his friends.
The next day, Draco wakes more refreshed than he’s been in a long time. Outside, the rain continues, a tapping at the window and on the roof.
“By the end, me and Ginny weren’t even sleeping in the same bed,” Harry continues. “I-I think I knew, deep down, but didn’t want to say it. I thought I could wait it out.”
Draco smiles. "Even when living in the Muggle world, I couldn't quite leave behind my upbringing. My mother loved to cook French cuisine - it was the only cooking she never allowed the house eleves to do growing up."
“Keep it under your pillow,” she instructs him, “and the nightmares will not reach you.”
"I am anemic. If I make a mistake, I might die." Ion passes the phone to Draco, and the blonde takes it gingerly and inspects it.
“Hm. I’m-”
“Oh. I see.” Draco pauses. “I owe them a ‘congratulations,’ I suppose.”
Harry scoops up some more snow and uses his chance to run forward, past Malfoy, and exercise a pincer attack with Sophia on the opposing team’s fort.
"But we're not-"
“Draco?” Harry asks, walking in front.
"Yes. Though I have never heard anything about music before."
Malfoy sniffs and sticks his nose up. "Ever since you came back into my life - what - a week ago? I have never known monotony."
As he sets aside his other gifts, Harry suddenly remembers that he both forgot to open Hagrid's present and to give Draco his. He takes his wand out and summons both, and the two packages come zooming obediently down the stairs and around the corner. They must have somehow made their way to the bedroom without Harry noticing. Or maybe he carried them up there without remembering.
"I'm back-oh," Ron stops when he sees Belle hovering over their table. In his arms are their drinks.
Cold chills sprint up and down Harry's body, making him shiver even though his covers are warm. Reluctantly, he gets out of bed and begins to get dressed, but his mind is still racing. The rising trend in neo-Death Eaters - all mostly young, white, wizards resentful of the continual intermixing of the Wizarding and Muggle communities and whites and nonwhites - has mostly meant more paperwork for Harry, but he had assumed that they would come to their senses eventually. The War hadn't happened that long ago, after all, and he thought that the Wizarding community wouldn't be willing to go down that road quite so soon. But the movement his rapidly barreling toward a fever pitch, and if Willows and his gang are really planning something serious...
"Good morning to you too."
“What do you mean?”
Arthur, Molly, Ginny, and Luna end up going to use the restroom while Ron gets more drinks for them. When it's just Harry and Hermione at the table, a tall woman approaches their table.
He wakes Harry, his body is still warm with sleep. Wordlessly, they get ready; Draco pulls their clothes out of the dryer, passes them over. Harry takes them, mumbles something, and ducks out of the cottage to return to his own.
“She knew and she did
. The ice they’re laying on vibrates.
The audience responds to him with vigor, quite a few of them shouting out "Great!" "Well!" or even just letting out a long, high whistle.
"Fuck-!"
"But they're nice people," Draco adds thoughtfully, "Many of them have expressed interest in my research - not that I told them about it, but I’ve proposed the hypothetical to them."
Malfoy’s face is unreadable. For a moment, Harry panics, thinking he has offended him, but it melts away when Malfoy’s face breaks out into a smile.
"I can't help it," Draco sticks his nose in the air, "It's the Slytherin in me."
Draco feels a headache approaching, like when he stands on the tallest hill and spots the darkening clouds from miles away. Prasad chuckles. “Good luck, Draco.”
It has never stopped being weird for them to be close to each other or interact after the divorce, but it's definitely a Harry-specific problem. Ginny was never truly in love with him - that's what she told him when she filed for divorce. It was understandable, as she was always only into girls, but Harry isn't gay, and he, at least, was in love. So it stung. And it still stings a little bit - even now, all these years later. But being with her as a friend and as a family member causes significantly less anguish for him now than it used to, so he counts that as a win.
"Well," the man sniffs and purses his lips, "no, unless you count when the other young man woke up and covered me."
"It worked."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Harry!" She pulls him in for a hug. She smells just as she always does - like her shampoo, which is cinnamon-y, and like her perfume, which soaks her body in vanilla.
"Uncle Draco, come play with us!" "Can we go flying, Uncle Draco?" "Come look at this, Uncle Draco!"
The look on Ron's face shuts Harry up quickly.
"What, the one who turned himself in last week?"
The salt stings his eyes and throat.
He closes his eyes, and makes a wish.
As soon as Harry reads the note, and rereads it, and rereads it again, he slams it down onto the kitchen table, startling Spotty into finding another perch on the back of a chair, and starts cooking his breakfast with newfound strength.
Ginny walks up and gives him two thumbs up. "Yeah, it was really good."
Draco seems to have recovered. "Alright, let's get to it. Did you want to fly now?"
“Harry? Draco?” She points to the jug.
Suddenly, the toddler starts tugging on Malfoy’s coat. “Play for us!”
Ron and Hermione are sitting to their left, and Bill and Fleur are sitting to their right. Hermione smiles at Harry and reaches over for an awkward half-hug with Harry's other arm keeping Lucy balanced on his knee. "Merry Christmas. How was Hagrid?"
Both of them had woken up late for breakfast. They dash down the halls of the castle, passing the rows of portraits peering curiously at them from their frames. The mid-morning sun shines through the windows and cast long shadows in vaguely Harry and Malfoy-esque shapes on the walls.
“What?”
Malfoy gets several facefuls of snow and drops to his knees while he tries to spit it all out. Harry runs up to him. Kicks down the fort. Grabs the wands. And runs.
Not looking up from the homework Harry’s grading, he asks, “Are you done?”
“Maybe a bit.”
He pauses, and sits back. He doesn’t want to turn, doesn’t want to look upon her face.
Hermione asks, her eyes bright. "Are you thinking of getting it published somewhere? If it's what you say it is, I don't think anyone in the community has done what you've done."
They stand in the hallway for several, long moments. “I’m sorry. Again.” Malfoy’s brows are furrowed, he’s chewing on his lower lip. With what seems like great effort, he continues, “I shouldn’t have assumed.”
Harry walks over to his desk, plops into his chair, and scrambles to find a bit of parchment and a pen that works; he uses quills at the Ministry to show that he
Draco buries his head into Harry’s chest so forcefully that it knocks him breathless. Slow and heavy breathing, then - sobs. Like a shower of stars, Draco’s tears come rare and fast and shining.
Today, Harry hasn’t looked his way once, and why should he? There was nothing to see, anyways - just a man, alone.
I'm sorry for uploading late! I've been caught up in IRL things. Hope y'all's weekends go well!
Sophia grins. “Much more that just
Harry says little, but he doesn’t have to. The way he looks down at Draco, the way he whispers a word, and a spell gently dries his hair and clothes, is enough.
“So?” Malfoy bites out, turning on his heel to continue walking. Harry easily keeps up.
"I'm so sorry." Harry tosses his napkin on the table and stands. "I'll make it up to you."
“See? It’s nice, isn’t it?” Malfoy’s breath comes from him in puffs of steam. When Harry looks over, he can see each individual snowflake that has gathered on Malfoy’s eyelashes.
"That was so cool, though!" One of the other children - Dominique, Bill and Fleur's youngest daughter - pipes up.
Harry winces. “Sorry. I mean, can I go with you?”
“I’m gonna need the report in tonight. A team is dispatching them tomorrow.”
“Where to, today?”
"Ugh. No." Harry turns onto his other shoulder and shuts his eyes firmly again, willing himself to sleep for just for a few more moments. A headache has taken up residence in his temples, but no matter how many eviction notices he sends, it still doesn't leave.
“Yeah…” Harry concedes, but then adds, “But not for lack of trying.”
“See you tomorrow then? Don’t tell Hermione I told you this but,” Ron pauses to look around for eavesdroppers, “We have something to tell you. A surprise.”
Harry glances at Ron who's standing on the other side of the room, back against the wall and his arms folded. He was out in the field too, it seems, judging from his mussed hair and the puddle of melted snow pooling at his feet. His eyes are resolutely trained on Kingsley and no one else. If he notices Harry looking at him or even Harry existing in the room at all, he doesn't show it. Harry feels cold all of a sudden.
Chatter in the club resumes immediately as people get out of their seats to get drinks or to approach the side of the stage and try to meet with Draco when he leaves or to gather their belongings and leave for the night. Harry looks around at the other people seated at his table.
A simple statement. So simple, it’s almost bare of any feeling, like branches in winter. From anyone else’s mouth, the words would drop to the floor - a stone - but from Harry’s, they bud and unfurl. Draco hears the blooms open; he hears them gather on the ground. Then, he hears the way the tree swells with summer.
The funeral is private, but that doesn’t stop word from getting out. No one shows up to jeer - after about three years of that, people decided it wasn’t worth the bother anymore. Not like the Malfoys are ever doing anything interesting.
"My house?"
“This was an enjoyable Christmas.”
He pockets the stone gratefully, and it sits on his thigh with a comfortable weight.
“But I thought you-”
Unwinding her scarf, Hermione sounds breathless when she speaks. "Oh, I didn't expect you all to be up so early. Good morning everyone."
, he would say.
“And now I’m researching definitive connections between magic and music.” Malfoy finishes with a little flourish with his hands.
He’s yelling right back at them, his face red, sweat pouring down, and several neck veins standing out starkly against his otherwise pale skin, but he’s still tight lipped about anything and everything.
He stands, stretches briefly, and heads downstairs to find something to eat. Recently, Harry has found himself skipping breakfast most days. Either he wakes up too late and has to quickly apparate to work, or he wakes up too early - 5:00AM, 6:00AM - and feels too queasy to eat until lunchtime.
Draco isn't wearing the sequined suit anymore, and has donned a green velvet one instead. It's just as gaudy and loud, in Harry's opinion, but infuriatingly enough, Draco pulls it off well. Paired with the messy blonde hair, Draco looks...good. Unfairly and effortlessly sexy.
Harry flicks his wand, and a wordless spell yanks his bags from his car like on a string. They step inside the cabin.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Of course I did," Harry assures her while trying to balance Lucy on his hip, "I do every year, remember?"
“Yes.” Slowly, leisurely, Draco extricates himself from Harry’s embrace and stands, stretching out his legs. “Let’s go, sleepyhead.”
“Actually,” Ron continues, “I should probably tell her that you’re sane again-” He opens the door and Harry sees her; she’s sitting on his bed, reading a book. It’s not one of his, he knows that for sure since he threw out most of his, so she must have been carrying one around in her purse the entire time. Classic Hermione. “He’s conscious,” Ron announces.
“A bit of spontaneity is good,” Harry says, hypocrite that he is, knowing full well that his own weekly and daily routines haven’t changed in nearly a decade.
Robards sighs and stands. "You have his wand, right?" he asks Harry.
For almost two hundred years now, dragon caretakers across the world have been assisting dragon hatchings, and dragons have learned to accept it. Draco is about to continue the tradition.
"Oh!" Hermione's jaw drops and Ron pumps his fist in the air while a few others - Bill, Charlie, Molly, Ginny, and Arthur - cheer. Especially since the War, the Weasley clan has remained close with Hagrid, and quite invested in his happiness and his relationship with Madame Maxine. Molly even knitted her an extra-large sweater with the letter M emblazoned on the front, which, for whatever reason, the extremely fashion-conscious giantess adores and still wears every winter.
“Not like
“I-I’m sorry,” Draco hiccups, “I’m sorry.”
The few who are still cognizant of their surroundings answer back and bid them goodnight, but most don’t even notice as Harry half-drags Draco out the room.
Instead of answering, Draco just continues to cry, turning his face so that the children can’t see.
Before them lies a pit dug in the sand, just wide around to fit a gray dragon coiled around the perimeter. The dragon shines dully, its scales like slabs of stone, and its stomach rises and falls as it sleeps. Nestled between its horned head and its slick tail are five eggs: black as obsidian, and just as smooth.
“How much did you hear? The nights I woke you up.”
“This way!” Draco calls over the downpour.
Their group sits on the unoccupied side of the table, and Hermione and Ron pull Rose onto their laps to squeeze in. Harry does the same to Lucy, who's once again stuck to his side. Draco sits to Harry’s left, close enough so that their shoulders touch a bit.
“Kingsley.” The Minister of Magic looks up from the pile of papers in front of him.
Correction: he dives and skids on the snow the last five feet.
"We got in a fight, that's all."
"I see." She moves closer and extends her hand to him; when he takes it and shakes, he feels its softness and the smooth golden rings on her fingers. "I'm Belle, his boss."
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Draco names, teaching Harry their names and tracing their shapes on the back of his hand. He conjures for him the story of mighty Perseus, Gorgon Slayer. Draco details his journey back - how Perseus caught sight of the maiden Andromeda, chained to a rock at sea, and slew the sea serpent Cetes to marry her. He draws for Harry their constellations, how they will wheel side by side forever: a collection of stars, disparate, but facing each other.
Though
Harry realizes,
Harry nods.
“Well,” she checks her watch, “he should be here any minute now. He usually comes in a bit after noon. Do you want to order something while you wait?”
“It just doesn’t seem like Aurors actually care about the people who are getting hurt.”
"I-uh-alright?" Draco stutters, his composure a little off-kilter.
"Getting involved with Draco, I mean."
“Can I get a comment on the rumor of the escaped prisoner?”
sorry. How rude of me for not introducing myself.” She sticks out a hand. “I’m Patricia, but you can just call me Pat. I’m the caretaker.”
And when Draco does finally appear on the stage, striding across with his powerful, long legs - seemingly elongated by the elevation of the stage - the crowd goes wild. Cheers, hearty claps, and indeed, some standing already.
“I see.”
But nothing comes. Life goes on much as it did before; Kreacher gleefully makes him breakfast, Harry throws his scarlet Auror robe on top of a worn T-shirt and jeans combo and heads to his office.
The receptionist chirps out a greeting at them, and they greet him back to be polite. A few other wizards and witches call out to them as they pass and as they ride in the lift, but Harry mostly lets Ron talk to them. Ron knows Harry doesn't like to deal with them, and he's a good enough friend to shoot the breeze on his behalf - "How was your Christmas? Mine was great, did I tell you Hermione's pregnant?" and "Do you think it'll snow again?" are two prominent conversation starters today.
"Are you-" Draco begins but shuts up immediately.
All that is left is the channel carved into the earth, and the bare rocks beneath. Harry jogs forward and jumps in. A sound rings out - the bottom of his boots clicking against stone.
“You always get the worst ones, don’t you?”
Looking around, Harry supposes there isn’t any other place for Malfoy to sit, but
"Harry." Harry resolutely refuses to look at his best friend, even though his voice has softened imperceptibly. "We love you. She still loves you. I just want you to apologize."
The men trek off - Thomas and Finnigan to their cottage, and the rest to theirs.
One hand still gripping the gloves and the box they came in, Draco rests his other, after a moment’s hesitation, on Harry’s arm.
“Where
Grimacing, Harry replies, “I don’t blame you.”
Friday. 7pm. Harry doesn't know where exactly it will be held but he has a good enough guess. He doesn't even know exactly what is happening at that time and place but he knows that Draco is going to be there and that's enough to convince him.
"Good morning my dears," Molly greets them through a yawn as she flops onto her favorite armchair and pulls out some knitting she's working on.
"Good evening," he speaks into the microphone.
“I-I mean-”
"Merlin, did I really just say that?"
'Til next time!
He doesn't have any words for her, only a slightly strained groan. His eyes are shut tightly, and even in the dim light, Harry can see that his face is red - either from exertion or from embarrassment, it's hard to tell.
Thankfully, he proceeds to do just that with minimal extra teasing. When the waitress comes back, Draco orders his fancy wine (You’ll love it, I promise, it’s one of the vineyard’s best years), a dish for himself called ‘Moules Manieres,’ and Harry’s dish, which he described to him as ‘a hodgepodge of meat and potatoes.’
