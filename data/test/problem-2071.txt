There was a flash of red hair, two different tones, and whom Harry knew to be his mother emerged from the smoke. Her green eyes bore into his, a shade bluer where his were more yellow, and she smiled so, so warmly at him. Lily raised a slow hand and trailed warm fingers across his cheek, then reached backwards with her other hand to pull another figure from the mist. This was a man with the same unruly hair as Harry, and James smiled toothily at him and winked behind almost matching glasses. The flash of darker red flickered behind Lily, as well as a blonde head, that came and went as often as he blinked. But beside James came another man who looked like him, but with darker, inkier hair, and a woman with hair the color of chocolate. They smiled at Harry and brought themselves around him to enclose him in a familial embrace, the likes of which warmed him even more that Rose's hugs did. Harry didn't know if it was possible to cry during the visions. He was sure he would find out.
"Ready?" Rose asked. Harry gave a smile similar to her smirk, and they ran into the pillar and through the barrier.
Harry let out a little laugh that came out more choked than he thought it would, and then there was something coming out of his eyes. He held the journal out as not to cry on it and wiped at his face, turning his nostalgic expression onto the man beside him.
on it and enlarged it slightly before gathering Hermione's kinky curls and tying it back in a half bun. "It's imperative that those with long hair keep it tied back when they brew. There are too many potions and poisons that can be created with a single strand of hair. If anyone has need of hair ties or does not know the spells to keep hair back, please see me after class." She turned back to the Gryffindor. "You're potion is looking great, Hermione, best of the First-years. Five points to Gryffindor."
Harry felt his eyes mist as he smiled at the note. Aunt Rose was so much nicer than Aunt Petunia. Looking into the bag, Harry decided to take out all the presents first so that he could put the trash in it as he unwrapped them. Just as he took out all the presents, which turned out to be seven, the compartment door opened. Standing there was the same boy from the robe shop, Draco.
Here Harry gave a smirk. "Well, while that does answer my question, I really wanted to know more about you and my parents." The request was soft, but Harry's face was sincere. Rose gave a warm smile and crossed her ankles, linking her hands in her lap.
Remus' gift was one Harry recognized immediately. The smell was potent enough that Harry likened it to the potion Rose had made earlier that day. The color was a burnt orange and there was a set of twelve in the box. Remus smiled very tiredly at his aunt and insisted in a small voice, "You didn't have to do this."
she realized it was nearly lunch time, so she left her other robes on her bed and walked to the Great Hall.
Harry laughed at the boy. "Of course not, come on it. I'm opening birthday gifts." He gave a kind of nervous and excited laugh. "I've never gotten a birthday gift before."
"Thank you for your patronage," Mx. Mordre nodded to them both and waved her hand again, the bowls disappearing and leaving her counter bare once more. "It will take half of the day. Come see me before sunset. Good day." And then she took her materials to the back.
Harry touched it lightly with his fingertips. "Thank you," he said. Rose hopped down from her desk, casting another
"Do go on then, Potter. Don't keep us in suspense," Blaise blinked with a dry drawl, and Harry had to withhold his second snort.
to levitate the troll's club and knock it out with it, and all was silent. Rose pointed her own wand at the troll and magical ropes shot out, wrapping around the lumbering creature and ensuring that if it got up, it would not attack anyone.
Rose rolled her eyes and looked at her friend. "You jest," she stated, and forked a piece of baked cod into her mouth. She turned away but Severus watched her a moment longer before returning to his own lunch. "And it's probably because of my Muggle clothes. I went out today."
to watch her. Harry raised an eyebrow and resumed his seat beside the other man, taking his tea to warm his hands.
Rose hummed, pointer finger stroking her chin. "It's December, so something warm and filling …" She wandered back into the kitchen and started rummaging, so Harry hung his cloak over the back of the desk chair, looking around the (
Seeing Harry walk in with Draco set her mind at ease just a bit, enough so that her shoulders relaxed. The crowd of First years creeped closer in anticipation as Minerva stepped up to the stool with the Sorting Hat. He sang his song as he did every year, and the children clapped. One by one, the eleven-year-olds were sorted.
"Uh, yes," Harry responded, taking in the boy as much as he was him. Rose raised an eyebrow and stepped away, chatting with Madam Malkin while her nephew conversed. He didn't brag about him being rich, didn't stuff it in Harry's face like Lucius had done to others when they were in school. Perhaps Draco wanted to be friends with Harry? That'd be … nice.
"-this?" George flaunted the parchment, and Rose recognized it immediately. It was the map that James, Sirius and Remus worked on with some tips from Pettigrew.
Harry smiled. "Yeah, she said that's where she got a lot of the crystals. Are dragons rare? Do they really breathe fire? Have you ever seen one?" he asked in rapid fire, and soon the boys became lost in conversation.
didn't even fill his trunk all the way anyway) so he packed it all into his trunk and briefly visited the owlery to inform Hedwig of his plans; the owl hooted at him and flew off, presumably to his aunt's flat.
"We've also noticed that you and Professor Snape spend a lot of time together in each other's rooms-"
Two had Harry's name on it--his full name. One was from Snape, which surprised him more than seeing him that morning at the Malfoys'. Inside the black box, underneath the green ribbon, was a detailed Potioneer's journal with all sorts of notes scribbled in the margins. Before closing it again, he noticed the same ownership as the book in Rose's lab.
The next morning, Harry awoke too early. He tried to sleep later at Hogwarts, but the instinct had been drilled into him and he found he simply could not remedy it. Besides, getting up earlier made it so he was the first to the bathroom, and he got to enjoy the hot water. It was the same at Rose's. Harry stretched his arms up above his head and swung his feet over, stepping onto the cold wooden floor. He shivered minutely before smiling to himself. The first term of Hogwarts had gone splendidly and now he was spending Yule break with his aunt. Hedwig was still snoozing on her perch so he didn't disturb her, but he did make a trip to the bathroom. It reminded him of the dungeons, save the enchanted-warm floor. Returning to his room, Harry plucked the shield book from the bookcase and sat on his bed, intending to fully immerse himself.
After they gathered themselves, Rose opened her large box that came from Hogwarts. She explained that it was the standard Yule gift for teachers, full of quills and parchment and inkwells. A separate box included personalized coupons to Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley and all her other favorite shops. She also received a photo album from Charlie Weasley, whom Rose had helped get a position as a dragon keeper by using her contacts in the Sanctuary. He was apparently in Romania now, and the album included photos of him and all the dragons he'd rescued. He also included a thank-you note, to which Rose smiled at. There were other small parcels of candies and such from Rose's favorite students, letters that were really pleas for extra help in their studies, and something that wasn't quite a Howler from especially anxious Seventh-years.
“That’s just it,” he said, “In exchange for Lily and James’ lives, Voldemort was defeated. Harry, your nephew, survived.”
They then took Harry to the train station, as he needed to return to the Dursleys. "I can keep your things in my apartment, Harry. Is there anything you want to keep with you?"
Rose stopped dead and slammed her and on her desk, causing green sparks to fly, and snapped her head to the lion. "Do
, she thought as she decided to have a talk with the man once she got back. Maybe she wouldn't even speak to
"James' Invisibility Cloak," Rose breathed, staring at the item as if it offended her. Harry blinked down at where his body was, but not visible. His father had owned an invisibility cloak?
"Prefects, escort everyone to their Houses! The Feast will be brought to your common rooms as the troll is taken care of."
"Why something like that would be within the walls of Hogwarts escapes me," Blaise mused, stroking his chin.
Waving her wand moments after stepping into his quarters, Rose's feast ensemble was replaced with a soft oversized sweater she'd gotten in Muggle Paris a few years back, and had subsequently left in Severus' room. She collapsed onto the bed with a combination of a huff and a sigh, and Severus took a seat on the edge of the mattress.
Rose nodded at him. "While Severus and I have Masteries in our own subjects, we spend so much time around each other that we basically know enough of the other subject to have a complex understanding of it." Well, that answered his question. She suddenly shifted and ran a hand through her hair, sighing a little. "Do you think the flat is too small? Should I move into somewhere larger? I gave you the guest bedroom, but I feel like you should have more space. What do you think?" She turned to her nephew with worry knitting her brows.
Rose helped Harry onto the train and promised he'd see her at the Sorting. Once settled, Rose's expression visibly darkened and she stormed back to the bike, unconsciously parting the crowds with the emotion-fueled density of her magic.
He saw the pinched, worried look on Rose's face and wanted to smooth out her eyebrows. "I know," he stated softly, and Rose nodded. She sat the helmet on his head and strapped it for him before she climbed onto the bike itself, adorning her own helmet.
"This year I will be introducing the concept of using spells and crystals to defend yourself." She made to say more, but a student raised their hand. "Yes, Miss Glendower?"
Rose smirked wryly at the spat words, and even Severus looked amused. "Do not worry about the Weasley boy, Mr. Potter. Once someone harms a friend of the snakes, they all rally against them. Trust me, I know." Rose snorted at her friend. After Severus and Rose had become accepted by the Slytherins, they were protected fiercely as they quickly excelled at Potions and Defense respectively.
Severus pulled Rose's hair out from under her head and let it dangle off his lap, already curling back from whatever she used to straighten it. "I think you should give the man a few weeks or so to adjust to your schedule and routine so you can see how he reacts to you. The conversation we had just before the feast began also has me troubled." Severus swept Rose's fringe off of her forehead to reveal several sunspots. "While the three of you - you, Lily and Petunia - never hid the fact that you were at odds, I highly doubt that you or Lily would make something like this up if the events that led up to it had been slightly different. Petunia has
Draco took it with surprising grace. "Draco Malfoy. And it's Harry Potter, right? Professor Rose is your aunt?" Harry nodded, hoping Draco wouldn't act like those people from Diagon Alley. Draco saw his expression and smirked a little, reminding Harry of Rose. "I won't pester you about the whole Boy Who Lived rubbish- no offense, sorry. My father told me you probably wouldn't like being reminded."
Rose tilted her head up and stared down her at the boy, channeling Severus. "Ten points from Gryffindor, and
Harry's face froze for a moment as the words sunk in. He could take pictures, moving snapshots like the ones of his parents and family, and display them around the flat he now
Outside of the room, the moonlight was tranquil and Harry felt at peace. When they passed by windows, he truly thought that his aunt was
As if the twins had known what he was doing, they offered him some kind of fake ear that they said would let him eavesdrop where and when he wanted. Harry balked at them, but they disappeared as suddenly as they'd appeared and he couldn't ask them more or thank them. Harry eventually settled on just shrugging, stuck one ear under the door of his compartment and set the other on his shoulder, partially hidden by the collar of his cloak. He was joined by Blaise (going home to Italy and his mother) and Parkinson (who was sorely missing her own bedroom) before the train started off. Draco was also returning home and had asked him to visit over the break, but he was riding in a different compartment. Crabbe and Goyle were asked by their parents to keep him safe, or something; Harry still didn't quite get the whole vassal/servant tradition thing they had going on and hadn't questioned it much. His ride was spent mostly reading about large creatures who had no business being at Hogwarts, with Blaise reading something in Italian that didn't look like a textbook and Parkinson writing in her diary. He paused briefly to open his lunch (which was surprisingly and pleasantly a chicken meat pie and diced potatoes) and while he was eating he heard something very interesting.
Rose’s brows knitted. Hagrid hadn't told her he was leaving for Harry. Dumbledore hadn't said anything about when the letters were sent or offered to take Rose to see Harry; hell, Dumbledore never told her where Petunia lived, or she would have gone there herself. “What do you mean he’s not been receiving his letters?” She rolled her eyes. “Don’t tell me that Petunia and Vernon refuse to allow him to learn of his magical heritage?” Rose downed the rest of her butterbeer and picked up her cat, who walked around her shoulders before settling into the hood of her royal purple cloak.
"Those were a gift from the couple I saw at the Muggle store. They're actually Muggleborn wixen, so after you wear them once, they will form to your feet and then grow with you."
It was years later, and Rose and Severus were closer than ever. Rose was having a blast teaching her students about how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, and a certain pair of Weasleys brightened up her classroom tremendously; as soon as she saw them, she knew they were Molly’s kids. However, she knew this would be the year Harry would start at Hogwarts. Thinking it over didn't take long, and she told herself to inform Dumbledore that she'd like to simply be an assistant professor or a tutor this coming year. She didn't think she'd be able to focus on teaching since she'd be fawning over her nephew, making sure he was completely happy at the school as she was.
Harry glanced out the window in the kitchen. There was snow drifting down steadily and there was sure to be a few inches on the ground by morning. Rose, Harry was both surprised and unsurprised to see, penned the reply on a lighter, thinner piece of parchment ( that still wasn't copy paper ) with a black-inked Muggle pen, one that glided easily on the paper. It was finished quickly and sent back through the Floo with an utter of "Amelia Bones, Ministry."
"You eat a lot of sweet things," Harry mused as he glanced at her. Rose hummed around a full mouth and shot him a smirk. They passed the stacks until Rose stopped at one.
The weeks passed slowly for Rose, but quickly for Harry. Him being friends with Draco and slightly protective over the blond opened up the floodgates, per se, and he found himself acquaintances with most of his house. Blaise and Theodore were quickly becoming his best friends along with Draco, who learned not to push for details about his past. His classes went well and Defense was starting to become his favorite subject with Charms coming in as a close second.
Rose scowled and took a lighter piece that obviously wasn't dark chocolate, and bit into it. The sweeter chocolate melted on her tongue and the taste of raspberries erased the leftover bitterness. She grunted before standing, taking one more piece of milk chocolate. "Dark chocolate's gross," she aimed at Severus, who gave a smirk. Rose started the walk to her Defense classroom, and vaguely registered Harry following her. She popped the chocolate square into her mouth, another raspberry, and made her way. Harry fell into step beside her. "So, what did you have trouble with?" she asked her nephew.
After class, there were a few girls and even a couple boys who needed a way to tie their hair back, and Rose taught each of them the spell she used daily. She was unaware of any wizard store that had hair ties but informed them that they could find some at literally any Muggle supermarket or drugstore, and cheaply.
"Harry, I got you something," she said, reaching into her jacket pocket. She produced what looked like a mini gift bag. "It will Unshrink when you get to your compartment, but inside is all the birthday gifts I got you that I couldn't send you. Now, obviously-" Harry's heart was fluttering so much at the idea of birthday gifts that he nearly drowned Rose out, "-I didn't include the baby stuff I'd gotten when you were younger, but there should still be enough there that'll make you happy." Rose kneeled and offered Harry the bag.
Rose promptly fell onto her new bed at Hogwarts. Tomorrow, she would be starting her first day as the professor of her favorite subject besides Potions. Without sitting up, she took her wand and flicked it, and all of her clothes and possessions flew into the closet and the dresser. She sighed and tucked her wand into her boot. She stood back up to change into something suitable for bed, then fell back into it, this time under the covers.
Both of them nodded, which was a welcome surprise. "Someone is saying that's what they saw, and that Hagrid often referred to it as 'Fluffy'."
The heels on her boots clacked loudly as she practically marched into the Great Hall, where several of her returning students stopped to watch her in awe. She nodded at those who waved as she passed, but said nothing to them. Soon, she reached her seat beside Severus, who was wearing a nicer set of black robes for the feast. "You look lovely tonight, Rose, as you do at every feast."
Vernon, along with the other Dursleys, had been silent up until now. “Stop!” he commanded, “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you from telling the boy anything!”
Harry didn't stumble as much as he did last time he took the Floo, and he counted it as a victory. Flooing was much better than Apparition, in his opinion. Rose steadied him as he got out, nibbling on a leftover cinnamon roll from breakfast.
"Oh?" Severus asked, prompting Rose to voice all of her thoughts in detail. They ended up talking well into the night.
and that fit you." She nodded at the closet door. "The closet will separate your Wizard and Muggle clothes automatically, and I'll teach you the spell to summon the different wardrobes."
"Hello again, Harry. How are you?" she asked, smiling down at her nephew. "Sorry it wasn't me who picked you up, I was enjoying the morning. I hadn't expected Hagrid to get you."
As soon as she landed, she heard the crack of a house elf popping into her room. "Pin has brought list for Miss Rose!"
Harry tucked the box into his pocket and threw all the trash into the bag, which Shrunk and Vanished like Rose's note said. He returned to the other seat to put his books and pens into his shoulder bag.
Hermione had gotten him books, to no surprise. The subject was animals, both Magical and Mundane, and Harry realized he could use them to figure out what Rose's Animagius form was. So far, she had dropped no clues and he didn't know what exactly to look for either. The Weasley twins, Fred and George, had sent a box of "Wizardly Wheezes," whatever those were. They turned out to be prank sweets with a log of what they were and how to use them. Harry was sure Blaise and Draco would get a kick out of them.
Lupin--Remus--gifted Rose a box of chocolates, the variety of which had her smiling behind her wine. (
Rose sort of snorted. “Three years without a letter or a visit? Dumbledore, we both know you’re not just here for chat and tea.”
"And he proposed!" Marcy lifted her right hand - as Magicals wore their engagement rings on their right hand and their weddings bands on their left, a Pureblood tradition - and on her finger sat a gorgeous silver band with two stones representing Ravenclaw. Vivek Allen was also a Seventh year Ravenclaw, but he didn't take Rose's NEWT class.
"9 ¾?" Harry repeated as they passed Platform 8, then 9. There was nothing between 9 and 10. "Is it hidden from Muggles?"
Without opening his eyes, he reached up and over the logs to grasp Rose, who was waiting for him. As soon as their hands met, the logs between them
She smiled at Severus before turning to Poppy Pomfrey, who was seated just a few chairs to her right. "Poppy, I must ask you check on a student tomorrow after breakfast and prepare to brew several nutrition potions, if you would."
"Hermione, do you have a hair tie?" she asked. The girl groaned and switched stirring hands to dig a broken tie from her pocket.
"So … Dumbledore had something of my father's, and saved it to give me at Yule?" Harry looked back at the parcel. There was a faint twinkling on the brown paper, down at the bottom. "Why would he wait until Yule? Why didn't he give it to me at the beginning of the year? Or--" Harry brought his head back up and looked at Rose "--why didn't he give it to
Rose nodded. "It will be my nephew, Harry Potter." This wasn't said too loudly, but she noticed a few of the older students who sat close to the staff table were listening in as well.
The (Magically legal) adults waved their wands and the floor was soon clear. The way none of them reacted to the use of a nonverbal spell caused a smirk to appear on Rose's face. "Very good. Five points to all houses for excellent use of a nonverbal spell. Now-"
“Er-no,” Harry said, shocking Hagrid. Rose, however, already speculated this. “Sorry,” he added after seeing Hagrid’s face.
"Of course," Rose answered, "Marcy's like a niece to me and I've always liked Vivek, so of course they'd invite their aunt and cousin to their wedding."
It was Harry's turn to smile. He wanted to get that second wand and perfect the shield spells as soon as possible. He nodded and set the letter down to get a quill and parchment, but then he remembered that Rose had the Muggle equivalent. "Do you have a pen and some paper?"
Rose smiled at that as she stacked the bowls to dry. "That's nice. Let me know when you want to go out and get him something and we'll make a day of it. Probably get your second wand while we're out."
Rose nodded. "Most Magicals wear some sort of jewelry that includes crystals with magical properties, even if for some it is a statement of fashion or wealth. For example," she gestured to her own jewelry, "I wear a necklace made of Rose Quartz, which gives me a number of benefits including sleep aid, health boosts, calming notions, and several others. I have one Garnet earring to repel things Dark in nature, because it's my birthstone," this made a few of the girls smile, "and I have one Labradorite earring to protect me against ill-wishing curses." Rose flicked her wand and the words on the board were replaced with several drawings of crystals, all in different colors. "Those who wear crystals for their Magical benefits usually focus on those which will aid them the most in their careers. For example, Aurors will use crystals which protect against curses; those who use lots of magic everyday, such as cleaners, will use crystals that expand their magical capacities and delay their magical exhaustion. You may notice that your teachers and even your housemates use crystals to help them."
Rose returned to the snake den to see Severus and Harry standing outside, the former leaning on his right leg. "Hey, you okay to join us for the ritual, Muffin?"
Poppy, as well as several other professors, gave a small gasp. "And you are sure he will need them?"
"Indeed. I'll take the pudding and get Snape back to Hogwarts. I'm sure your aunt will be fine, though." Remus drained his glass and took it back to the kitchen manually, then managed to tap Snape's shoulder without being glared at. The Potions Master stood with one last sigh in Rose's face and left his glass on the coffee table, and took his gift. Remus had in his hands the Shrunken box of leftover bread pudding and his potions and gently led Snape to the door, where he would Apparate said man to Hogwarts.
to keep up the tradition. And now that I'm not a student, I can wear whatever I want. It's a sort of ode to my sister in that regard."
She looked over and gave Harry a very Slytherin smirk. "Hang on," she said, and Harry barely had time to do so before they took off above the small town he grew up in. His childlike laughter warmed Rose's thawing heart.
"My sister Lily got it for me as a graduation gift." She took a steadying breath and turned back to the board.  "Now, alongside crystals …"
“DURSLEY!” Hagrid exploded. He glared angrily at Vernon before looking back to Harry, looking how Rose felt. “But, you must know about your mum and dad. I mean, they’re
Harry chewed his sandwich, eyes concentrated in thought and eyebrows slightly knitted. "Everyone thinks I'm special," he said after a minute. "All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Olivander ... but I don't know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what happened when-" he stopped himself from saying Voldemort's name again, "Sorry- I mean, the night my parents died."
influential." The rest of the student body was sorted fairly quickly and Dumbledore stood as the applause died down.
Rose helped Harry fit his things into the side car and settled him in, casting a nonverbal charm to keep Harry's things from falling out with a quick point of her finger. Before handing him a helmet, she gave him a long stare. "Harry?" she started, unsure. The boy looked up at his aunt. "You know you're not a freak, right?" Harry looked down for a moment before looking back up and nodding.
"I am always running out of quills," she said sagely, too sagely for how much wine she'd had, "and I figured you were in the same boat." Snape merely nodded stiffly and closed the box once more, setting it aside for the moment. Harry thought the man was a bit amused at Rose but unwilling to show it blatantly, and Harry wasn't so versed in Slytherin faces yet.
The scene he was greeted with when he returned from the loo was seared behind his eyes for years to come.
But then something else caught his eye. It was a plain, unassuming brown thing wrapped in twine, half-hidden from the eye. Harry's eyes squinted as he tilted his head at it. There was a note tucked under the string, but there was no suggestion of a sender. The package was a bit wrinkled, but not from wear. For a moment Harry thought it would be some kind of cloth or fabric before he shook his head and walked to the kitchen. There was no use contemplating it when he would be opening it later.
Just as Draco was about to say more, their compartment door opened. In it stood a redheaded boy, though his hair was more orange than Rose's red, and a girl with bushy, untamable brown hair that reminded him of his own. The ginger sneered at them none too subtly.
The boy nodded and returned to his sandwich, so Rose sent a smile to Draco as well before taking her seat beside Severus. She pulled her hair back into a loose ponytail and took a sip of water.
"Well, I have papers to grade. Hey," she stepped beside him and hovered a hand over his shoulder until he looked at her, and she set it down softly, "I normally light candles for James and Lily on Halloween, and there's another ritual that Severus and I perform for them. You're welcome to join us if you want, Muffin."
Rose narrowed her eyes playfully. "How do you know that name?" she asked in mock of Severus' drawl. It made Harry laugh.
Rose awoke with a smile on her face, knowing this would be the day that she would get to show Harry Diagon Alley, where every witch and wizard hung out. Her cat, Mewt, was lounging on the floor, lying on his back and looking cute. Rose yawned before heading towards the shower.
"Those Weasleys keep staring at us," Severus muttered into his fish, and Rose let out a snort without looking up from piling her plate. "And more people are staring at you than usual."
hated magic, as she was the only one of you that couldn't perform or sense any." The soothing motion of sweeping through her hair set to tire Rose. "Besides, the young Draco Malfoy is my godson and the headmaster has not said anything to me." He didn't say anything about the fact that it was Dumbledore who placed Harry with the Dursleys in the first place, nor that Rose had all but begged the old man to keep him in the magical world.
Rose walked up to the door and knocked three times. The conversation she could barely hear stopped. She then heard some murmuring and running. The door opened and Harry stood before her, looking disheveled but very excited. "Did they treat you any better?" she asked him quietly.
"Did you know that your aunt and my father were at Hogwarts together?" Draco asked in a softer tone than he used with Ronald. Harry shook his head. "My father said they didn't get along at first since she's a Muggleborn, but Mother told me that it's because Professor Rose told him off that they actually became friends." That made Harry laugh a bit. Sounded just like Rose.
“You never told him?” At first he was quiet, but then his anger built up, “Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left for him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! And you kept it from him all these years?”
Rose looked ahead and saw the young boy, and managed to keep her grimace under her mask. It was Draco Malfoy, Lucius' son. Severus was 'friends' with him - in her opinion, but the boy had become Severus' godson - and Rose herself hadn't spoken to him since graduation. She smiled, since she was a professor at the school and needed to be professional.
They reached the Defense classroom and Rose opened the heavy door, ushering Harry inside. It felt different than it did during class, but Harry chalked that down as it being empty. Rose strutted to her desk in the front and sat atop it, and Harry sat in one of the front seats.
It was enough to send the weary man into a fit of unexpected laughter. Harry smiled at their antics. That right there,
"Well, Muffin," Rose croaked, voice just as rough as Harry expected his to be, "let's get clean and eat something, then we can nap."
And as he slipped from the smoke that thinned with each passing hour, he heard them speak in unison.
Rose smiled widely and giggled a bit. "Rosewood," said said as if it should have been obvious. "Rose Quartz in the core." Harry rolled his eyes at how much irony his aunt carried with her.
They stopped at Gringotts so Harry could withdraw a good amount to buy gifts, then made their way back down to enter Madam Primpernelle's, which turned up an eyebrow. Harry knew that Blaise was running low on that hair gel he needs to use for whatever reason, and that he can only get it in Diagon Alley, so he picked up a full set of six jars. Draco also had a habit of using hair gel ( just not the expensive one Blaise did ) so he picked up a half-pack for him. He also wanted to get the blonde a couple of unique cloak pins, since all of his were ( while high-end ) bought by his father. Harry also knew that Draco and his mother frequented Twilfitt and Tatting's ( the sheer amount of time Draco could go on and on about a robe shop astounded him ) and picked out a silver snake pin with a single emerald eye. Just as he was about to head to the counter, an extra special pin caught his eye; it was a piece of agate with two thin streams of gold running through the crystal, and the pin itself was also gold. Harry smirked and picked it up as well, willing to pay the sixteen galleons for such a piece. Theo was more of a reader than anything, so he wanted to wait until they were about to leave to get him something. Parkinson had talked sparingly about all of her quills being hexed, so he wanted to pick up a pack of the no-dip quills Rose got him. Greengrass had mentioned she wanted some colored parchment, so he picked up a roll of lavender, rose, mint, and peach, hoping it would please her. Millicent Bulstrode was the one person Harry talked to the least ( save Crabbe and Goyle ), so he was unsure what to get her. He walked into Sugarplum's Sweets to get them the widest variety he could afford as he thought about Bulstrode. She was quiet and reserved, but did listen to their conversations and add her input in the form of snorts and grunts. Maybe a scarf, or a pair of gloves. Harry then remembered that she was very good at Potions, so he darted to The Victor's Apothecary to pick out the nicest set of potions tools he could find.
"Oh, Marcy, I'm so happy for you!" Rose enveloped the girl in a warm hug. "Chrissy would be so proud." The two of them shared a deep breath. Marcy's father, a Slytherin a couple years above Chrysanthemum, who was already a few years above Rose, had proposed in her last year as well, and became a widow during the same summer Rose lost her siblings. "When are you two having the ceremony?"
Rose chirped her own laugh and pulled back, wiping Harry's cheeks before her own. "I used to call you that when I'd visit Lily and James. You looked like one of those popping pastry cans, you know the ones? I called you that the first time I saw you and it just stuck. Kind of like how Sirius and Remus called you pup." Rose sniffed and wiped her face again before standing and taking Harry's things before sending the trolley away. "Let's get you on the train, okay?"
And that Dumbledore. He never checked in on Harry or told him about magic? The Dursleys wouldn't, the wizard should have
The other professors started murmuring in aghast tones while Dumbledore gave a light sigh. "Are you certain that you are not being too overprotective of your nephew? You and Petunia never got on well, after all."
"Welcome class," she spoke with a thin smile. She looked a little worn compared to the glow she seemed to have last night, but Harry suspected only he really noticed. She wore a floor-length emerald dress that was dashed with white, black and red designs and her hair was tied back in a low ponytail. "Obviously I am not Professor Snape, but he is currently unwell, so I am taking over his classes for the day. Professor Quirrell will be teaching Defense." A few of his classmates snickered at this, behind their hands of course, and Harry noted the writing on the board. It was his aunt's, not Snape's, so he had not even been to his classroom. "As Professor Snape has been preparing you, we will be brewing a Cure for Boils potion today. I urge you to be very careful in your brewing and to not hesitate if you require any assistance."
"So, when can I become an Animagius?" Harry asked a few hours later. It was getting closer and closer to the time they were meant to pick up his second wand, and Rose was trying to decide whether to get another cup of tea or a coffee at that point. She looked up at him from her empty cup and blinked for a few moments.
It made Harry feel a conglomeration of emotions again. And again he decided that he was happy. Marcy also sent a box of milk chocolates, half with lemon and half with rose. They made Rose smile again and Harry wrinkled his nose at the lemon. The fact that Rose didn't get angry at him for not liking her favorite sweet was amazing to him.
when all his books were on the shelf ( though it was still mostly bare ) and his journals and quills on the desk. Mewt had snoozed on his bed whilst he was unpacking, so there was cat hair collected in one spot at the end of his bed. It made it feel real and lived in, so he couldn't bring himself to clean it off. The picture of his mum and Rose brought a warmth to his chest that made him feel more complete. He hung his bag on the coat rack on his door with his cloak and stored his trunk under his bed, and it felt
Rose looked down at Harry, who lifted his wand from his pocket. Rose held it in between two flat palms for the wandmaker to note. "Hm, yes. Eleven inches, and does it suit you well enough?" Harry wasn't expecting to be asked a question directly, but he nodded regardless. The witch narrowed her eyes and looked him over, and he resisted the urge to smooth his hair down over his scar. Eventually, she nodded and waved her hand to summon a rack of different woods. "Hold your hand over the woods."
to give him things. It was evident in the love she exuded for him through the gestures and the food. And the other gifts, but they were for his birthday and Harry was ( still ) trying to convince himself that it was
Rose's bread, and it effectively disappeared in the next few days. Rose wasn't even angry, she just laughed and ate it nearly as fast. As promised, they went out for a shopping day to get both Harry's out-of-school wand and presents for his friends. Rose dressed in a shorter, more casual dress than she wears at Hogwarts in a heavy black fabric to keep her warm. Harry decided to go with one of his darker robes - a green one - to wear with a pair of dragonhide boots from his Wizard closet. They pulled on similar black cloaks with silver fastenings at the door and moved to the Floo, which they would take to Flourish and Blotts.
it said. Harry rose an eyebrow as his aunt went back to the desk to buy it and Shrunk it to fit in her pocket. Rose gave him another smirk and a wink when she returned and shuffled them out the door. "Alright, let's go order your wand first and shop while it gets made." They took a turn into an alley that was much darker and gloomier than Diagon. "This is Knockturn Alley, and I don't want you coming here without an adult, okay?" Harry nodded obediently. "Good. This is where we'll go." They stepped up to a shop with a sign that said
Draco frowned but said nothing. He closed the door and sat opposite Harry, peering at the pile of presents. "Happy Birthday," he said.
"Did you read the note that came with this one?" Draco asked, holding up a moderately sized box. Harry shook his head and took it when Draco handed it to him. It was written in Rose's elegant scrawl.
Harry glanced down. "That's true," he said softly before shaking his head. "Want to help me open these?" Draco smirked again and nodded, and the two got to work.
Rose was, once again, surprised. Yes, she loved her DADA class, it was the only place she could lash out at Severus without getting in trouble. “Professor?” she asked. “Well, I guess that would be nice, but I’m only just over 20 years old, plus most of the other professors had me for a student, right? Wouldn’t that be weird?”
Draco and Harry were in the library during their after-lunch free period working on Defense. Rose had assigned a bit of reading into basic protection spells and crystals. "So, Professor Rose seemed quite irritated in class, don't you think?"
"Hello, Mewt. Lovely home you have." The cat mewed again and he scratched under his chin, getting some very loud purrs for his troubles. Mewt then jumped up onto his desk and stretched out, flexing his claws adorably, and laid down on his back. Harry tentatively patted the cat's revealed stomach (it was
On Halloween morning, Rose sauntered into the Great Hall dressed to the nines. She wore a short black dress with a high collar and long flared sleeves, orange and purple striped tights, oversized black slouch boots that had pointed toes and thick heels, and a wide, pointy witch hat. She had black lipstick on her lips and shimmering silver stars around her eyes, and she smiled at all who looked up as she passed them and sat down in her chair at the staff table. The entire ensemble was quite eccentric to those of Pureblood families, but those who had grown up in the Muggle world knew exactly what she was doing, and kept sneaking smiles and smirks at her all day.
"Ya' sistah!" Rose said just as loudly. She walked into the living room sassily, crossing her arms at the sight of her sister and her husband. "Harry, are you all packed?" He squeaked out a reply, then vanished. Vernon glared at her warily. "I want custody of Harry," she said with a normal tone.
for me without my knowledge or consent. I don't need one, nor have I ever mentioned needing one." At this Rose picked her head up from her temporarily-tamed nest of wild curls. "Did I?"
"It seems like you have an idea already," Harry murmured back as they eyeballed the shops. Rose gave him a smirk.
The Third-year flushed and lowered his head. "S-Sorry, Granger. Thanks for getting us points," he mumbled.
"Half the school thinks we are together, including our coworkers," he said, fixing a pointed look to Irma across the way. To his left, Minerva coughed politely. Rose stabbed the fish again and brought it to her mouth just as an unfamiliar owl swooped and landed on the back of her chair. She patted her mouth with her napkin and took the letter from the small brown bird, and offered a piece of her fish. It hooted in thanks before taking off again, through one of the open windows at the top of the Hall.
"Okay, so I didn't want to overwhelm you again, but I went out and got you a new wardrobe. Most I put away, but I did leave these out for you to open yourself. You can set your trunk and bag on the bed and I'll take you down the hall?"
Lupin sat in the other armchair, the one beside Harry, with his own glass. Rose took a breath and leaned away from Snape, turning her gorgeous smile onto them. "Presents?" she asked and waved her hand. The boxes stacked on the floor under the tree floated to the coffee table.
Rose nodded. "Yes, I think it was a Hermione Granger. She had excelled in Charms class with the Levitation spell, and others mocked her for trying to help them with their pronunciation." Here she sighed. "Harry must've went looking for her. Kid's heart's too big for his chest. Let's find the troll and make sure no students are harmed."
Rose laughed at the cat. "Hello, darling," she cooed as she scratched the black kitten's head, who purred loudly at the attention. In the corner window sat her own owl, a dark-feathered beauty she'd had since her school days. "And hello to you too, Diablo. How was your flight?" The bird hooted at his owner and pecked lovingly at her fingers. Rose summoned a few treats from the bag in her drawer. "I'll need you to send off a few things for me." From her pocket, Rose produced the letter she'd written to Amelia as well as the vial containing her memories and another letter she'd written after a second thought. "The first needs to go to Amelia Bones in the Ministry, and the second to a personal friend, Remus Lupin. Can you do that for me, darling?" The owl hooted and shook his feathers before accepting the mail and flying off into the approaching night.
her way to the desk in the front of the room. "Good morning all, and welcome to Defense Against the Dark Arts, commonly referred to as Defense or DADA." The names of the class appeared on the board with a wave of her wand and she turned to address the students, who looked either nervous or excited. "My name is Professor Rose Evans, but please use my first name as opposed to my last, makes me feel a bit younger," she said with mirth, and the students all gave her smiles. She saw that Harry and Draco were sitting next to each other near the front, and as she took attendance noted that Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson were sitting in front of them with the Crabbe and Goyle boys behind. She'd purposely arrived a bit later so Harry could still arrive before her after his check up with Madam Pomfrey. He smiled up at her.
Draco and Harry smirked to themselves as they made their way back to their table, nearly laughing aloud. "Apparently your aunt likes someone," Draco said as they sat back down.
Then, Minerva called Harry's name, and a hush fell over the Great Hall. He stepped up cautiously before sitting on the stool, hand running over something at his collar; Rose smiled when she realized that he was wearing the necklace she gave him. The hat tilted this way and that, talking to himself and to Harry, before it straightened and roared, "SLYTHERIN!"
The elf nodded enthusiastically. "Of course, Miss Rose! Anything for Miss Rose!" And the elf popped back to the kitchens. Rose tacked the list to her message board and waved her wand to take her earlier note down. Casting a
There was silence for just a moment before the Slytherin table roared. Rose gave proud smile as she clapped, watching Harry go and sit with Draco. Next to her, she heard Severus give a quiet snort. "When I saw him, I was so sure he would go into Gryffindor like his parents. He's only known you two months, and look where he is," the man murmured to her.
“That is enough!” Rose heard. She stood from the ground and looked behind her. Vernon was still standing with his gun, but now Petunia was standing with him. Rose's new cat hissed at Petunia from his perch on Rose's shoulder, causing the witch to pet him to calm him down.
Rose nodded, her smirk leveling out into a smile. "Perfect for the season, in my opinion. So," she gestured to the bags on the floor with one hand, "wanna open them?"
Severus came strutting towards her once he saw her sitting in the Three Broomsticks, cat in tow. “Rose, Dumbledore has informed me that Harry Potter has not been receiving his letters. Once the owl arrives with them, they are just thrown out. Hagrid was on his way to wish him a happy birthday.”
Rose laughed at him and patted his back. "No, you wouldn't know. It's usually in the First March curriculum."
The other was wrapped in simple brown paper and tied with string, but Harry was no less excited to open it. After untying the string and setting the box lid aside, the small Slytherin found another journal. This one was bound differently than the other one; the Potioneer's journal had a stiff black cover with nary a crack in the leather, aside from the spine, while the second journal's was tawny and worn and loose. Scrawled on the inner cover was a beautiful hand that Harry had seen before.
However, just as they stood, the doors to the Great Hall groaned and Quirrell ran in, clothes askew and out of breath. "Troll in the Dungeon! Troll in the Dungeon!" He made it halfway to the head table before slowing and trying to catch his breath. "Just thought you should know." And with that, he fell onto his front and fainted. There were maybe a couple seconds of stunned silence before everyone started roaring with panic. Dumbledore stood and raised a hand to order peace.
Only one problem arose between the two. They were sorted into different houses. Lily into Gryffindor, and Rose into Slytherin.
This made Harry look up again. "Aren't I not supposed to perform magic outside Hogwarts until I'm seventeen?"
Hagrid took them to the Leaky Cauldron, which was empty. Harry was quiet the rest of the way, and Rose worried about him. She knew it was a lot to take in if one had not been raised in the Wizarding World, she experienced it herself; in fact, her sister had been the one who was furiously excited, running and jumping around when they got their school supplies, and Rose had been quiet, just as Harry was now. As they sat down to eat, as there was time before the train left, Hagrid voiced Rose's thoughts.
Rose gave him a pinched look while his head was down. She didn't want to think about Petunia's horrid parenting skills during such a festive time. She glanced back down at the menu in her hand. "How about something simple to start? Sweet and sour chicken from the Chinese place is just fried chicken with a dipping sauce. Fried rice goes pretty well with it. How's that sound?" Harry nodded mutely as he straightened from the island and hooked his hands together in front of him. "Alright. Then I'll get a wonton soup and a house fried rice," she murmured almost to herself. She circled the items with a pen and moved to where a phone hung on the wall. Harry hadn't even noticed it. Did Rose live in a Magic or Muggle neighborhood? Was the Chinese place run by - wixen, did she say? - or Muggles? While she was ordering over the phone, the fireplace flickered with green flames and a letter shot out of it, landing in the basket on the floor. Harry tilted his head and walked over to it. It had Rose's name written in black ink that didn't swirl as much as McGonagall's. Who could it be from?
Harry blinked at her quickly and jerked his head. "No?" he said with a tilt. Was that even a real word?
"Hey, Muffin," Rose greeted with a smile. "I'm making my signature bread to see if you like it. If you do, I'll make it again for Yule. Remus does so love his bread pudding." She took one of the towels and wiped the counter, then placed the bowls in the sink. Harry noticed her wand was stuck in her hair, which was tied up in a bun.
"Your aunt and Snape have been friends for a very long time, Haythim," the man said quietly, watching the other two just as intensely as Harry was. "And it slowly turned into love, though neither one of them will admit it. I thought they'd kill each other Fifth year, but they didn't. Came pretty close, though."
"That's me and Lily, as you probably guessed. James took that during the summer before Sixth year, when we were practicing and letting out steam. The day after we got our OWLs results." Rose grinned to herself at the memory, at her and Lily's nearly identical scores.
Rose showed up at her sister's house early on the first of September. She'd borrowed Hagrid's motorcycle since it had a side-seat, and she put the rest of Harry's things in it. She did not want to draw unwanted Muggle attention to herself, so she wore black jeans, a purple T-shirt with the words
on it in gold lettering, and black biker boots. Her black leather jacket had a rose patch on the back. Her normally wild fiery hair wisped about her when released from the helmet and fell down her back in curly waves. She hummed to herself, tempted to buy a bike for herself.
After dismissing the class, Rose was approached by one of the Seventh year Ravenclaws and daughter of one of her close friends, Marcy Potté. Her mother Chrysanthemum had died in the war and made Rose an honorary aunt, and had named her daughter after Marcy Sterling, whom she'd always been close with. "Marcy, how was your summer?"
Severus shook his head. "I said I am fine, Rose. My small injury will not deter me from the ritual. Shall we start?"
"Good afternoon everyone," Rose greeted her NEWT class. Since the number of students was only just higher than her average class, they, from all four houses, were put in the same period. "If you would, push the tables and chairs out of the way. First lesson of the year is going to be practical."
that Rose started to tear up. She cleared her throat in lieu of sniffing and felt Harry nod against her. She let him go and wiped at her eyes, ignoring the fact that he was doing the same. "Well, I'll write back to her and tell her to go ahead and cement the date. The weather must be bad is she used the Floo instead of her owl."
The next morning, after a good hot shower, Rose was walking down the many marble staircases and into the Great Hall wearing green robes. It was wondrous, she thought, to be walking in these halls after so few years. She smiled to herself as she took her seat at the staff table, alongside many of the professors she had.
The three looked up in shock at Rose's soft words of praise, and the group split again. As Rose walked Granger back to Gryffindor Tower, the girl thought of a hundred different ways to thank Draco and Harry. Harry had seen her before Charms and had wished her luck in that bloody class, expressing his admiration for her dedication and intellect. When he'd found her in the lavatory crying, he ranted about how much of a git Ronald was and that he should make sure he can cast properly before mocking others. Draco had been mostly silent, but he'd offered a sneer and mocked Ronald as well, not forgetting the first day when the four of them met on the train. He hadn't mentioned anything about her blood status as many other Slytherins would and had in face saved her life with the very spell she'd ran off crying about. He'd even offered a - though very tiny - smile at her before the professors took them away! Hermione raised her head and went to say something to Rose about it, but found the redhead to already be looking down at her.
The boy gazed at her with his brilliant verdant eyes, and nodded, smile creeping upwards. He raised a hand and squeezed it over Rose's. "I'd love to." Rose smiled back and opened the heavy door for him, and the two slipped out.
"Er, well, I'm right-handed," Harry said shyly. He held it out, like Olivander asked him. Harry then tried many wands, but finally found one that agreed with him.
Rose smiled. Another Wizarding tradition Harry could witness, and he could learn a lot from the Pureblood couple. "We'd both be delighted. Congratulations again, Marcy. I'm sure your father is very proud."
"It's a Wizard camera," she said softly, her grimace morphing into a smile as she went, "I thought you'd like to take some pictures of your own that we can hang on the tree next year, or that you could put in an album or something." Her brows furrowed as she looked at her nephew slightly pleading.
"Signature bread indeed," her nephew smirked as he took the printer paper and black-inked pen. As he penned his reply and similar excitement for both Yule and Christmas, Rose brought them both a cup of rosemary tea.
Rose hummed and ran her fingers over her Garnet earring. "Curiouser and curiouser." Then standing, she tied a cloak around her shoulders, smirking at the face Severus made at her. "I have to finalize my syllabus and then I'm going to tuck in." She leaned over to where Severus was still sitting on his bed and pecked him on the cheek. "Goodnight, Sev."
Rose smiled at him and stirred the sugar into her coffee. "Of course, Muffin." The toast popped out and a butter knife flew out of the drawer to spread it. Rose held her hand out and the plate fell into her hand, and she placed it in front of Harry with a smile. He smiled back in thanks and started to nibble on it. Rose's buttered toast floated over sprinkled with sugar and she took a large bite when she cold reach it.
Rose laughed. "Yes, I suppose that's true. I'm closer with my magic than most people. Twins are a very magical thing, did you know? And Magic is very patient, working in strange ways. I've noticed myself getting stronger every year since Lily was murdered, and I long for the day to avenge her. But, for now," she glanced at Harry and gave him a smile, "I will do good by her through you, Haythim James Potter. My nephew."
“You don’t know who I am?” she asked. He shook his head. Rose immediately glared at Petunia, who was also starting to cower behind her husband. “I am your aunt, Rose.” Her eyes didn’t leave her sister’s.
Severus snorted. "No, not to my knowledge. Though it does seem rather peculiar that he would hire someone for the position you had contemplated retiring from, though you never explicitly said you would be. Even more so is that Quirrell was previously in charge of Muggle Studies."
She watched him like Snape watched Longbottom in Potions, though with less disgust and more anxiety, as he picked up the small purple box; the anxiety had appeared when he'd unboxed the Dreamless Sleep and persisted like Ripper with a bone. The black ribbon unraveled with a gentle touch and the box unfolded. Harry smiled at it and vowed he would never tire of magic, especially minor occurrences such as this. Inside the box laid what looked like a camera. Harry lifted the maybe-camera and sought Rose's eyes again.
The boys shuddered and ran in front of her into the Great Hall. Rose shook her head and walked along the outer table, where Harry and Draco were sitting. Harry brightened as she approached. "Professor, do you still have time to help me?" he asked.
Rose set the bags down, which then flew to her closet, and turned to take the list. "Thank you, Pin. What did he go for the most?"
There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. Rose still could not believe her sister and brother-in-law did not tell Harry anything,
Back on the train, Harry could hardly wait to open his presents. Once he was seated the bag grew until it was nearly the size of Harry himself, with a note attached to the straw handles. Harry took it and started to read the beautiful scrawl he promised he would memorize.
"Thank you," he managed to croak. If his eyes were watering, he couldn't feel it. Rose's own eyes might've been watering too, but she hid her face in his hair as he did hers and she held him fast to her. It was an amazing gift, as well as his other gifts from all his friends, but this … Having his
Then again, he knew very little about what really happened that Halloween night ten years ago--besides the fact that his parents were murdered and that Voldemort bloke had vanished along with them ( whom none of the adults would talk about and he could only get so much from the children of those who survived the war ).
Sighing again, Rose popped a few bones as tension left her shoulders. If she could get Remus to visit over the Winter break, then the three of them could spend a wonderful Yule together. She stroked the pink stones around her neck and thought briefly of her sister before shaking her head and turning to her vanity and closet. Waving her wand, a few robes and dresses flew out and awaited Rose's judgement. After thinking a moment, Rose picked a sleek black dress that ended at her calves. She floated it over next to her vanity and stuck it there before sending the others back into the closet. The dress she chose was slightly sheer and had three roses embroidered at the bottom, had a purple belt around the middle, long sheer sleeves, and a halter top with a few Jet crystals sewn into the front. Rose picked out a pair of thigh-length purple boots that fit like stockings and had thin heels to go along.
Harry felt weightless in the magical smoke, floating with no tangible destination. He didn't know what he was headed towards or what awaited him, but he trusted the magic. It felt like home. A mere five months ago he wouldn't have any idea what
. She then decided to walk outside the pub, leaving money at the bar, and tucked her book into her robe. She saw a familiar lumbering giant walking with a young boy nearly a third of his height, who was also the spitting image of her late sister and brother-in-law. Rose huffed to herself. She caught their eyes and waved gracefully, happy Harry had made it safely. Hagrid smiled at her, then ducked down to whisper something to her nephew. He nodded, and started to walk towards Rose, Hagrid going a different way. She watched him with swirling thoughts.
"Yes," Harry spoke, cutting Rose off. "I want to live here, with you. I want to stay in the Wizarding world." His eyes were teetering on misty and he took a breath to calm himself. "If you would have me, that is."
“Hagrid, you didn’t have to knock down the door,” she said with a faint smirk on her face. Once the dust cleared, she looked forward and saw Harry. Her breath quickened. “Harry,” she said in amazement. He looked exactly like her sister. She walked more inside the shack and stood right in front of him. Crouching to his level, she placed a hand on his head. “You look just like your mother.”
“Oh, shove it,” Rose sneered. Hagrid plucked the gun out of his hand and bent it like a paper clip. This amused Rose since she disliked Vernon greatly.
"Hi, Aunt Rose," the girl started, a spitting image of Chrysanthemum with long black hair and blue eyes, before she broke out into a huge grin. "It was wonderful. Vivek and I visited Mother in the Potté cemetery and enjoyed a nice picnic."
"And that should be the last one," Rose said as she strung up one last snowflake to the tree. She stepped back from it, smoothing her hands over her soft black leggings, and stared up at her masterpiece. Harry joined her a couple steps back and gazed up at the magic tree. It was truly spectacular, and more festive than Aunt Petunia ever got. He looked back up at his witch aunt, who had changed into a sweater opposite to him- green with thin black stripes. "Now," she said, turning to him and giving a smile, "dinner. I don't really feel like cooking, so I was thinking takeaway." She walked to the kitchen and pulled open a drawer full of menus. She hummed as she looked through her choices. "Thai, Chinese, Mexican. I can't choose. Harry, come help me."
Rose took Harry to the first bedroom in the hallway, and he was in awe when she opened the door. The room was mostly sparse of any personal touches, but there was a picture hanging on the wall that looked like an enlarged magic photo; it was of Rose and another redheaded woman ( his mother, he gathered from his Halloween visions ) laughing and sending spells at each other. The bed was in the middle of the room, fitted with cream sheets and topped with a silver comforter. On the left was a light wood desk with a window and owl perch; Hedwig was already making herself comfortable on it and nosing her beak through a bowl of treats Rose had set on the desk. On the right was an empty bookshelf, and on the wall sharing the bed there was a door that led to (presumably) a closet. There were a few shopping bags at the foot of the bed with a logo Harry didn't recognize, and sent a look to his aunt.
"Thank you Pin, again. I'll want another list by the end of the year, just the ones he liked the most though, like top twenty. Can you do that?"
"I assigned some reading for my classes, so here's my list for this week in case any of them turn up missing or harmed."
Hagrid wiped his chin and answered, “Call me Hagrid, everyone does. An’ it’s like I told you, I’m the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. 'know all about Hogwarts, o’course.”
"One that eats far too much," Rose joked, and the other students laughed, having seen the cat practically fall into Rose's soup at lunch. "Now, I know you all finished your summer reading, so I want to see just how good your wards are before we get into all the fun jinxes I have for you." Her smirk was mirrored by her Slytherin students. "Two rows, all facing each other, and cast the wards you feel most comfortable with." She watched as the students took stance across from each other and cast their wards, colors ranging from red to purple. "Very good, very good. Now I am going to verbally and nonverbally cast a
