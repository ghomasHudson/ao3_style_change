“You’re thirty-nine,” Remus said, his voice unsteady. “You’ve been gone two and a half years.”
The door creaks as the spell hauls it up to its proper angle, against the broken lower hinge. As Padfoot watches, the line of silver hammers around the perimeter of the hinge, leaving a line of silver nails in its wake, reattaching the hinge to the splintered wood of the door. But then the line dissolves abruptly in a shower of silver sparks and the door falls free of its hinge once more, askew in the cabinet’s frame.
It’s a hotel. I think that’s what it’s called.”
"You don't know how the contract really works." Ron wore the smug expression of someone who knew something you didn't and was going to make you sweat to get it out of them.
"That he has." Flint smiled at Draco, not unkindly, which was somehow even worse than Nott's taunting. Both Flint and Nott took for granted that this was Draco's lot now, to be on his knees before them. Flint was the kind to treat his servants well, while Nott was the kind to treat them poorly. But there was no question in either of their minds that Draco was, and would forever be, their servant. And they hadn't even heard the news that he was going to be burned off his own family tree. Another sob fisted up in Draco's throat; he choked it back again.
"Isn't it funny that Fred and I have different wands?" said the twin-who-must-be-George.
Theo snorted. "Seven sucks every single week, for each of us? One a day? You really are desperate."
"Nothing. He said I should talk to you." Potter's hands stilled on Draco's sides. "Are you angry? That I asked?"
“Always knew George was a poof,” he said. “He was always just a bit too into it, wasn’t he. He always… wait, hang on a tick. If it was supposed to be George then how come… oh, shit.” He stared at Harry, looking stricken.
“Because I promised Dawlish I’d give it to him.” It was all crashing down now. Draco tried to breathe, but he felt as if a load of stones had settled on his chest.
The anger roared back in, fast as fiend-fyre. "You
“How old am I?” Sirius turned to Harry, eyes darting over him in concern. “How old are you? How long have I been gone? Oh Merlin, I—” he broke off and put his head down on the table, and the sound that came from him sounded very much like Padfoot’s whimper. Harry and Remus nearly banged heads as they both reached out to hold him, arms tangling across Sirius’s back.
"Just because you have a cool boggart. A boggart who's actually dangerous." Draco tried not to snicker too but it was like being with Pansy or Blaise—laughing felt safe in here. Fun. Not cutting, like in the common room.
“Yeah?”
. Draco could feel Potter’s magic brushing against his, asking to be let in. He felt his own magic open in response, a trembling stretch inside him that left him full of empty spaces where Potter’s magic could enter. When it did, Draco gasped at the influx of power. It was like a double shot of firewhiskey inside him, intoxicating and burning and so bloody
"And thank goodness for that." Zabini toed off his shoes and threw himself on the bed with nonchalant grace. "Draco owes me a suck and I much prefer the comfort of a bed."
Harry’s Quidditch reflexes took over--no forethought, just pure fluid motion. His left arm shot out and linked through Draco’s as his right arm swept his wand and he shouted the words of their destination. And then the Manor library vanished around them as he and Draco were tugged away, into the stomach-dropping lurch of Apparition.
Malfoy frowned. "Contracted, then. In any case, regardless of whether I understood the nature of the matter, I owe you a favor." He looked away, looked burdened to be honest. "Of any size, of course."
"Of course, Harry Potter, sir. Widley will be bringing them at once!" She disappeared with a pop, her toga fluttering as she went.
Harry's magic pulsed around him, black and fierce. "Tell me what the fuck is going on--!"
Potter's face softened. He took his glasses off, tucked them out of the way, and rubbed his nose.
"I never would have thought it," his father said slowly, as if it hurt to speak. "My own son, attempting to dethrone me in the most cowardly way possible."
“Fuck, Draco.” Harry’s voice sounded so awestruck that Draco opened his eyes before he could stop himself.
Harry yanked his hand off his cock, feeling guilty. Had Nev noticed? Was he mad? The contract had been about servicing your dormmates, not using your friend's knob to figure out your own desires. "Er? What? No good?"
Harry looked on with an avidness he didn't even try to hide. Forget merely fit--McLaggen was fucking gorgeous, with tight abs and wide shoulders and thighs thick with muscle. Harry drank all that in and his mouth watered even more as the pants came off. McLaggen's cock sprang free, half-hard and thickening as he watched.
Their rude replies barely registered; Draco was used to those now. All he listened for was the 'yes' and he had that—they weren't going to stop him. The image of the bed he'd shared with Harry in the hidden curl of the Gryffindor tower seized him with a physical need. He wanted to be there. He felt, somehow, if he could just find his way back to that bed then he could find his way back to that time when Harry had been holding him, whispering words of love in his ears.
Hermione nodded to him, Head Girl to Prefect, and Harry relaxed. Maybe between the pair of them they could keep the Gryffindor/Slytherin murder rate reasonably low. Anyway, it wasn't his problem. What he really needed was to get over to Malfoy—
brother. Stupider, too."
“You said the key was in the Librarian’s tomb.” Harry stared at the rectangular stone base that removing the mattress and bedclothes had covered. “His tomb is right here. Under his bed. He’s buried in there.”
Sure enough though, a moment later, a little elf popped into view, a fresh pillow clutched in her hands. "Your pillow be all wetted, but don't you worry sir, Widley is here!" She switched them out, the plump new pillow replacing the old one, which disappeared off to wherever Hogwarts pillows got cleaned. She beamed at Potter. "Is there anything else Widley can be for you doing, sir? Anything at all?"
"Of course." Harry had a sudden urge to lean over and kiss Malfoy. "What's the misunderstanding? What does Zabini mean about you telling me something?"
He didn’t deserve this. Happiness was for good people. Harry deserved a princess in a tower, not a failed boy-villain with scars on his chest, a mark on his arm, and a chin that was far too pointy to contain a heroic cleft.
"And you thought your old man was too weak to fight him off?"
"So, I have no doubt that Draco here has assumed that you like cock for the exact same reason he does." Zabini's eyes half-closed with pleasure as Malfoy licked his way from bollocks back up along his cock.
Remus, bless him, let Harry’s slip of Draco’s name pass without comment. Harry pulled Sirius’s jacket on, needing its warmth and weight. “Draco’s the one who lied to me. He’s the one who acted like he loved me when he always really meant to leave me.”
"You're new to this. All blokes do it when they suck you off. Birds don't, not that I've noticed so far at least. Hannah Abbott slapped me when I told her to, can you imagine that?" McLaggen pressed down on Harry's finger. "Give me two now. Go deeper."
It was all the twins's fault. Of course. It was a canary cream of an idea, a ton-tongue toffee’s worth of madness and in any normal year Harry would have laughed it off as he trudged up the tower stairs to his nice dull dorm room bed.
"You're not welcome here anymore," said the second one, a boy with a turned up, piggish nose.
"You mean can we ask an unlimited number of follow-up questions exploring the answer?" Draco thought about it. "Yes, that's acceptable as long as the answering party can call a halt to it at any time."
“Give it to
"I think this type of contract, whether written or oral, can't be enforced without willingness on both sides, not and remain moral—"
It was not a comfort now. As the staircase finally ended in a narrow, dank hall that only became yet another staircase, the air became ever more hot and humid, and the stairs themselves developed into increasingly curving spirals, twisting intestine-like. The steps beneath his feet were slick, his shoes slipping, threatening a long and painful fall. Still, he didn't want to touch the curving wall for balance-it glistened with moisture, pearly and faintly red.
Can’t think
“You won’t change back, then?”
But then—nothing. Literally, more nothing. He seemed to hang in a strange space which was somehow both tiny and limitless, like a soap bubble suspended in deepest space. Was this what had happened to Montague, after the Weasley twins had stuffed him in that malfunctioning Cabinet?
“Draco?”
Chapter 28
“I promise,” Harry said, and then Draco was kissing him, his lips opening Harry’s lips, his tongue slipping between them for a taste of Harry’s tongue and then withdrawing, and then Harry was pressing into him, his mouth hot and hungry, his hard cock rocking into Draco’s and his naked skin hot against against Draco’s skin, dragging softly against his body and then gliding as their bodies grew slick with sweat.
Which was taking a long fucking time. Typical. How in the world anyone could bollocks up drowning was beyond him but he seemed to have somehow managed it. Ahead of him, he could just see a misty greyness which must be the water of the lake. He kicked, trying to force his way toward it. If he couldn’t drown properly, perhaps he could at least swim to the surface and try in some other fashion. It seemed to work--at any rate, the mistiness seemed closer and so he kicked harder and harder, feeling for all the world like he was swimming.
"Both of you: shut it." Zabini wriggled his hips, getting comfortable. "Now. On your mark."
“You love me?” Harry asked again, and Draco understood that. How a person might not believe they could have the thing they wanted, might need to hear it a second time, and a third time too, and then again, before believing it was true.
. What he has now is just as real. Realer, maybe. They changed him when he hit puberty. He never had the chance to do much more than snog a few girls before he lost his taste for it."
It was the next patch that made him nervous as he hurried past, trying not to tread too close behind Dawlish. These were Jupiter Fly Traps and they loomed over the pathway, as enormous as the name implied. They liked larger game and Draco turned slightly, avoiding the green hairs that protruded from an uncomfortably close variegated maw. Another one just past it must have already fed today, some sad squirrel or something—a pulsating red spot glowed a little off-center half-way down it, marking the spot where the corpse was being digested.
Rubbing his elbow, Draco straightened up, threw back his thin shoulders, and started down the path, trying to look like a wizard whose magic--whose nerves--were more than equal to the task before him.
"I, er." Malfoy stopped, then seemed to brace himself. "I want to know why you've done this. All of it, from saving me in the dorm to wanting me in your bed. What is it that you want?"
He held it up, proud, for Draco to see. Draco’s smile was obviously forced, maybe because Harry had once again beaten him at a Seeker’s game? It didn’t really matter—now Draco was transfiguring an old vase into a lidded jar.
There wasn’t much to see. Or rather, there was plenty to see, if one liked seeing mist, as that was all there was. There was no visibility past a foot or two—the air was silvery grey, filled with a fine light fog. Light shone from somewhere, enough to illuminate the fog at any rate, though the source was unclear. Maybe the mist itself was glowing? Draco reached out and touched it, cupping his hand around a fistful of fog, which sat tamely on his palm, then flowed off and over it, like fine-grained sand.
And what if—Harry could barely think this—but what if he was the one who lost? What if he was the one on his knees, cock after cock pushed down his throat, learning how to suck and lick and please a man? It wouldn't be his fault—everyone would know that he didn't want it. It was just damn bad luck.
that place. Of course, it wasn't the house's fault. It was my Great Aunt Walburga. My mother had to take me over there sometimes—family obligations—but she was so absolutely horrible that you can't imagine it."
It takes the boy forever to understand that he should follow Padfoot, but then they’re off, and Padfoot is leading the way! He takes the boy straight to the cabinet, where he gobbles an old sausage in celebration and then retrieves the Remus jumper and worries it back and forth in his teeth because this boy must be made to understand the importance of the jumper.
? That nutcase who escaped from Azkaban when we were third years?"
Draco stilled and the words worked inside him.
“I’m expecting Lars and Liam Travers for Sunday brunch,” Slughorn said meaningfully.
now through here, corridor, tattered rug,
"Father, I know about the werewolf they chained in your cell."
Ron stepped in the way, a hand coming up to wrap around Harry's. "Oi, mate! What's the matter?" he said, looking more baffled than worried. "Not that I don't understand wanting to murder Fred on occasion but Mum's going to want to know exactly what he did this time."
going to be his last few minutes on earth, he wanted to know what it felt like to kiss Draco Malfoy.
As he passed the door to his room though, he found himself taking hold of the heavy brass knob and pushing the door open, slipping inside. He locked the door behind him and leaned against it. His breath was coming in gasps as if he'd been running.
“Fuck off, George.” The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he had time to think. “And you too, Fred. The both of you can fuck right off.”
“Don’t say half-breed, Kreacher. That’s an order. So Remus is here?”
“That’s more like it,” Blaise said. “Even if it isn’t true. This is all about you and Potter isn’t it?”
Harry was gazing down at him with his mouth half open, his eyes soft. And Draco didn’t mean to, but when their eyes met, his orgasm hit.
“You were going to tell me,” Harry said, his voice low, “how I should get you off. You want me to suck you?”
But even as he spoke, he felt a tug of guilt in his stomach. How was he ever going to tell Ron how he felt about Malfoy?
"Excuses, excuses." Malfoy licked his lips, deliberate, provocative. "A true cocksucker can overcome that."
“I came out in the bowels of some bloody little alcove under this kitchen. The whole place—the mist, I mean—was filled with one-way Vanishing cabinets. I was Padfoot there, I don’t think I remembered I was a wizard, and one day I was nosing about and I smelled you, Moony, and tracked it to a jumper all full of holes that had come through one of the cabinets—”
If she were the type of girl who liked horribly creepy life-sized dolls, Harry wasn’t sure he wanted to meet her. Then again, who knew what the toy situation had been in the 1600s—maybe you had to take what you could get.
He ignores the boy’s mildly exasperated shove and a muttered, get off, you and snuffles his way up the inseam of the boy’s trousers to the vee of the boy’s crotch, and
"Wait, what—" Harry squinted through the faint haze of the charm.
Ever since the night of the contract, though, Ron had thawed a little. In an annoyingly superior way, like Harry was a stupid little brother he had to look out for. Reminding him to bring his broom to Quidditch practice. Telling him not to leave his things all over the floor. Checking to see if he really had all the required inches for his Charms paper. Annoying, inexplicable shite like that.
"Those of us who have to pass our NEWTS with knowledge rather than fame understand that bubblehead charms enclose a pocket of air, right? The pocket of air surrounding your head, to be precise. The air which in a not inconsiderable amount of time will be nonexistent in this room. If, while we're drowning, you wish to enclose our heads in an extra bubble of water, however, then it's a marvelous charm. Go right ahead."
, Harry told himself. Just think of her by her name, not her current circumstances.
Draco bristled, hard and fast. "Being the heir doesn't mean a daily tete-a-tete. If you're insinuating we weren't close--"
Rows of trellises, covered now with the brown remains of summer, hid the back of the garden from view. A thin whistling tune came from the corner beneath the trees. Harry hurried in that direction, avoiding the clumps of worms who seemed to be soaking in something very like milky tea. That was Britain, he supposed. Even the earthworms needed a cuppa before work.
“I know. I just don’t care. If you want to save your dear father, you’ll find a way. Deliver the key by the next full moon and your father will have a more peaceful evening.” Dawlish grinned. “You’re resourceful. You proved that in the war.”
Feet pounding the empty Sunday morning corridors and his breath coming not coming, not enough, but he was running still and if he could still run, he was still alive.
"Hermione," Harry said, looking at the small door set under the turn of the steps. He wasn't sure if he wanted to frown or grin. "It's a closet. Under the stairs."
“Draco Malfoy is receiving a guest in the Fettucine Garden,” the elf announced, her tiny face bright.
The only difference was that this time, Draco couldn’t be happier.
Harry stayed a few feet behind them as they wended their way back downstairs, not quite able to bring himself to walk with Draco and the scary monster-doll…no, don’t think of her that way, she’s just a long-dead girl…now embodied in hard wax…no, don’t think of her that way either—
Harry entered a clearing and stopped. Malfoy was just in front of him, turning over the soil with a well-worn shovel. The early morning sun was dappling his hair, turning it an even brighter gold, and now that Harry was here the awkwardness had rushed back in. How could he say that he had hurried out here to find out if Malfoy liked cock every bit as much as Harry did?
“If you weren’t such a git about it, maybe he would have,” the twin who was George said. He looked appraisingly around the room. “Got yourself sorted then, Harry? Nice digs. A bit cramped, maybe, but I wouldn’t mind dropping by for a visit sometime soon.” He shook his head. “We’ve been sadly neglecting your oral education, but I promise we’ll make it up to you in spades.”
"Very funny," he whispered to the Room of Hidden Things. "I get it now, okay? I know what I want. It's not hidden anymore." Well, at least not to himself. He still didn’t see how it was anyone else's business.
He couldn't go back out there. Not like this—it would be the end of him.
“... reversal spell … If I get the bloody thing fixed at all … unlikely to hold…”
Harry startled and his heart kind of wiggled in his chest but he tried to give the elf a friendly nod. Sometimes he wished house-elves could be taught to send a warning chime first, some kind of a count-down type thing: like five, four, three, two, one—elf!
“Oh, I do like those American cop shows on the Muggle telly,” the Auror said, with a grin that suddenly made it eerily clear who she was: her smile was just like the one he’d glimpsed in the portrait of a young Andromeda that his mother kept hidden her dresser. “But don’t worry,” Tonks continued, “we’ll caution Dawlish properly back at the Ministry.”
Harry went ahead and wrapped his arms fully around Malfoy, because Malfoy was shivering and it was the right thing to do. Plus, something about body heat, right? "At least you got to spend the last hour of your life telling me how stupid and wrong I am. That's got to be pretty nice."
“You’ll need to take me, Draco. The Librarian never opens his tomb for the living and there are no paintings on his wall for me to go to.” Cassie’s smile shone bright, lips parting to reveal nice straight teeth, each one painted with a single brush-stroke. How did the portrait-makers do that, Harry wondered, how did they add details which weren’t revealed until the subject moved and spoke? Did they put that layer on first, so that for a moment or two, there was nothing on the canvas but pearly white teeth, smiling in an empty face?
Harry shouted in desperation, and the snake exploded in a thick ribbon of flame.
Finally, there the village was, ahead of him. Vague shadows resolved into clearer shapes of underwater houses, spread apart at first then closer and closer together and he had to be near to where he'd seen the first cabinet fall. The water churned in front of him and a merman appeared, spear pointed directly at Harry.
"Come on, then, Malfoy," he said with a tug.
Harry didn't understand. Wouldn't it be worse if Harry didn't want to fix it? Wouldn't it be taking advantage? "I asked you where that key is. Tell me."
On an impulse—probably a very bad, very stupid impulse that prioritized naked skin over naked truth—Draco leaned forward and took the chocolate between his teeth. He let his tongue swipe out and lick along Potter's fingers.
“It’s not because of you,” Harry said.
“Okay. Tell me something, then.” That grin again.
Ron waved that away. "You signed a Weasley-Twin magic contract." His hand, when he dropped it, came to rest on Harry's thigh. "That makes you stupid by definition."
Draco drew a deep breath and relaxed into Potter's arms, not even caring how pathetic he might look. It had been a bad bloody few years and was it so bad to want to feel comfort like this for a little while? "My turn?" He considered his options while he felt Potter nod yes. "Hmm. Okay. I'd like to know how you got your name in the Goblet of Fire fourth year. Everyone under seventeen tried but you were the only one who managed it."
“Dear, dear. Panic attack, is it? Nasty things.”
“You saved him, Draco. He’s all right, he’s home with Remus.”
“Watch the floor,” Draco called over his shoulder. His wand was out, moving in a pattern Harry would have sworn was a floor-sweeping spell. Ron had done one just like it whenever Molly’s steps sounded on the stairs heading towards his room—a flick and a swish and a special mad twirl and all the dirty clothes and general mess would sweep neatly out of sight.
Harry tugged off his jumper, and then his Henley. Bare-chested, he spread his arms wide. “Whatever you want,” he said. The hair under his arms was thick and black and Draco wanted to bury his nose in it. Instead he reached out and ran his hands down Harry’s naked torso. Harry’s skin was as warm as the firelight and he leaned into Draco’s touch. Draco pressed his palms against Harry’s abdomen, the dimple of his navel and the soft curling hair below it, loving the feel of his body. Then he undid the button of Harry’s jeans and fumbled with the flies until Harry laid his hands over Draco’s and, gently pushing his fingers aside, reached out and undid Draco’s flies instead. He slid his hand in between Draco’s trousers and his pants, cupping Draco’s erection through his briefs. “Whatever you want,” he said again, and dropped to his knees on the carpet, gazing up at Draco, his face alight with desire.
," Malfoy said brightly, letting his arms hang over Harry's shoulders like they were the oldest and closest of friends. "Seeing as how you obviously don't know how bubblehead charms work."
Draco was looking a little scared again and Harry willed himself to calm down. He wasn’t mad at Draco, God knows, or even at Cassie, or at anyone maybe except for the sheer weight of history which had been built here, stacked floor upon floor until it inevitably crushed the living.
“A little more now,” Draco panted, giving Harry’s hand another squeeze, and slowly, Harry’s finger slid deeper inside him. The sensation of that one finger was so much--Draco’s whole body was tingling with it, his balls were drawing up, caught in the deep delicious tension between his hand on his cock and Harry’s finger in his hole.
All right, suppose this
Blaise smiled. "Take your time. I vote for Draco, by the way. So that's two votes to Draco, and he wins."
Ron laughed. It had a bitter edge to it—the sound of long, painfully acquired experience—and Harry's stomach started to sink.
Malfoy groaned. "I'm about to die in water fish have
Harry shouted, and Nott shuddered to life again, his eyes snapping open and his feet shuffling as he struggled to regain his balance. Draco pushed himself free and turned on his knees, his mouth wet and his eyes wild.
Malfoy nodded stiffly. He raised his wand and pointed it at the door. "We need to concentrate our combined magic on the smallest possible area. Drill a hole and the water will rush through, helping us break it."
Dean obligingly pushed Harry between the two of them and pinned his arms, holding them tightly back and crossed at the wrist.
if you want to play.”
Draco blinked, his eyes suddenly wet.
,” he finished.
“Fuck, Malfoy.
Harry shifted around a bit, taking hold of his cock and easing it to the furled edge of Draco’s hole.
"Good." Potter said around a bite of pie, manner-less beast that he was. He finished the bite and tried again. "I mean, yes, it's good your mother cared about him but also, Regulus had a lot of good in him. You wouldn’t believe how badly he narked off Voldemort. He stole this thing, a—well, never mind what it was, it's too complicated to get into right now—but anyway, Regulus tried to hurt Voldemort by taking something very important to him. That's how he got killed."
Harry tuned out as Draco chattered on about the superior features of the Slytherin quarters, and the clearly unsanitary nature of Gryffindor Tower, especially in regards to the inevitably caked-on filth of centuries of adolescent bodies. He trailed behind Draco into a second, smaller ballroom off the main ballroom, some kind of emergency back-up ballroom, he supposed, in the event that the main ballroom was somehow unable to perform its duties…seriously, Harry didn’t know why anybody needed a room like this. A melancholy feeling was rising in his gut—how could he ever understand Draco, the person he was falling for more and more every day, when he couldn’t even understand the house he’d been raised in? When even living in the same castle their worlds had been so different?
So instead of speaking, he leaned forward and kissed Harry, soft and quick on the mouth. Harry sighed against him, his arms going around Draco, holding him in place, keeping and deepening the kiss. His lips were soft and earnest, as eager as his blow jobs but significantly more skilled; he hummed against Draco’s tongue, lightly nipping his lower lip while while he reached around behind Draco and pushed open the door of their room. Then, still kissing, he began walking Draco backward over the threshold, entirely unaware that he was being lied to because he was a sodding, trusting, Gryffindor fool whom Draco was going to entirely fuck over tomorrow night when he gave the key to Dawlish.
Draco sucked in a sudden, surprised breath. McGonagall was angry but not at Slytherin? She was furious with her own Gryffindors for causing the problem? Even more startling was the fact that Potter was nodding along to all of this.
He heard the door open and footsteps crossing the room. The bed squeaked behind him as someone sat down on the edge of it. Harry waited for someone to pull him out of the jacket and make him come downstairs and talk—that would be Hermione. Or come downstairs and eat—that would be Ron. Nothing happened. He could keep breathing into the leather as long as he liked. Whoever it was would give him time and knowing that, he didn’t need to look, he knew who it was.
The dog's ears pricked up, grey eyes focusing on him with an expression of near-human intelligence. It picked itself up off the ground, gave itself a thorough shake, then trotted off a few steps.
Draco nodded, already drawing his wand.
Ron snorted and pulled back. "They don't kiss me on the mouth, that's for one thing." Ron put his hands on Harry's shoulders and gave him a gentle shove downwards. "They made me go a little lower."
Could he possibly convince McLaggen that having Harry's cock up his arse was a normal part of a 'bloke blow' too? Probably not. Even Oliver wouldn't have been able to get that one by the prat.
Except that didn’t sound very Gryffindor. Or very Harry. Besides, Harry was currently lying on top of Draco, which was pretty much the opposite of kicking him out of bed. Draco gave an experimental wiggle, but Harry didn’t budge. Never mind getting kicked out, Draco couldn’t leave if he wanted to.
"Does anyone wish to alter their offer? Give more, ask less?"
Oh. Of course. Harry was being the idiot here. McLaggen wanted a finger up the arse. Probably. Harry stalled for a moment, wetting his finger again. What if Harry guessed wrong? Would McLaggen deck him one? Would he sound like a complete berk if he asked?
“Is that,” Draco asked tentatively, finally calm enough to step back from Blaise’s hug, “why you took up this?” He waved at the room, taking in the x’s and y’s and asymptotes and linear progressions and whatever else made up the complicated swirling topography of the walls. “You want to make it all make sense?”
Padfoot begins to tremble all over.
He got back into position and seized Neville's cock, holding it still while he sucked the head into his mouth. Neville gasped and shook.
He hit the wall with an oof but it didn't hurt quite as much as he'd expected. The thing he'd hit was softer and paler than dungeon stone and it was standing on its toes to hold its head above a rapidly rising water level. It was also so soaked Harry could feel every line of its lean male body and finally his mind registered the fact that he was plastered against a very scared, but not yet drowned Draco Malfoy.
“We both went,” Remus said. He lifted the glass to his lips, saw that it was empty, and set it down again.
Ron gave a cry of triumph and leaped up. Harry, startled, looked from the wand to him and back again, and there it was: Ron was safe.
“Oh?” Draco wiped at his wet face and tried to remember if this were something he was supposed to know. His hands were still shaking and he felt entirely lost.
That's so wrong and yet so practical, Harry thought as the two of them went out, shutting the door behind them. That was Slytherin advice in a nutshell for you.
“You do still love me,” he said softly, slowly, as if trying out a phrase in a foreign language. “After everything. And you’re here. Trying to save me again.” He bent down and picked up the cup, still empty. “Tell me again,” he said.
Draco stepped back, the dog still hurling itself forward with desperate enthusiasm. "Okay, all right," he said, petting its thick, mist-wet fur, getting his fingers into the matted fur behind the poor thing's ears. "How did you end up here? Where's your people?"
Marcus's lip curled up and his hand went to his flies. "How about I give you a chance to convince me. You want this, Theo? You want it, Draco? Get over here and show me how much." He pulled his flies open and yanked crudely at the bulge that was growing there.
In the deep recesses of his dog mind something stirs. Another consciousness, tugging at the edges of his awareness like a jerk on a lead. But now the boy is asking to be shown around the mist land and Padfoot will show him! Will show him everything! And oh—
Harry wasn't going to think about how this major yet confusing fight with Malfoy had suddenly shot to the top of the Worst Day charts. Malfoy wasn't that important to him. At all. And he'd prove it.
Fred was already waving his wand at the cabinet and his smile had passed grin and headed into the realm of the frankly alarming. One final
This is what had happened: they'd had a crup, a fine pedigreed bitch who'd been bred to the Greengrasses's prizewinner. She'd had puppies, four of them. Three strong and healthy and one smaller boy, the weakest of the litter. The other pups had picked at the little one, snapped at him, kept him from eating. Draco had hated that—he'd scolded the other puppies, and stopped the biting, and brought the little one up to the dish to eat first, to make sure he got enough food.
Shit. Draco was choking.
Potter mouthed Draco's neck. "Really? You can't guess?"
Draco stared at him, a hint of quiver in his lips. “Honestly? You’d support that?” He laughed a little bitterly. “My father would hate it, of course. To the very hard line it would smack of surrender, because of course no one should be at Hogwarts who didn’t already know everything a proper Pureblood should.”

“That’s the one,” Draco called out as a toothy long-bodied rat with a green stone embedded in its forehead burst over the lid of the tomb. He grabbed for it but it slipped through his fingers.
"Harry, I came for, you know. A suck." By the sound of Longbottom's voice, his head was turning, looking from Potter to Draco and back again. He paused, taking in the two of them. "Er, Harry? Is this a bad time?"
Harry laughed too, his discomfort at the surroundings suddenly eased by picturing Kingsley’s face if the first item of business Harry brought up in their next meeting was that. Then again, Kingsley was smart and favored consensus over crushing the opposition—he’d probably love it.
"Come to humiliate me further, have you?" His father leaned back against the wall, a look of distaste rippling over his mouth.
“My father.” Draco stayed as immobile as Father in his corner. This had already happened, he had to remind himself, to keep from flinging himself between his father and the wolf. Had Father already been turned?  Or simply eaten? “What did you do to him?”
Once again, something tugs at the back of Padfoot’s consciousness. This boy is familiar, somehow. Padfoot drops the jumper and noses at the boy’s crotch, trying to sniff out who he is.
Ron looked mulish for a moment. Then he seemed to think of something and he stretched out on the bed beside Harry. Stole his pillow too and plumped it underneath his head, getting comfortable. "I've got enough older brothers. You're my first
Harry kept his head down as he passed the sculpture garden, ignoring the marble maidens who reached long white hands out toward him. He trotted past the rose garden too, clipped and quiet. Around the corner and finally he was in a place he'd never much bothered with, though he knew the lettuces and peas and half the other vegetations, as Widley would have put it, that fed the castle were grown right here.
“For fuck’s sake, what is it?” Zabini shook his arm. “What do you see?”
So there. That was some information, right? He was getting somewhere and he was not going to think about the way Ron's foreskin had pulled all the way back and how Ron was humping up into Harry's mouth, way past trying to be polite or gentle or anything but intent on forcing his way into a hot wet hole.
“Harry?” Draco said, looking up. A note of fear crept into his voice as he took in Harry’s expression. “What is this cup? What’s wrong?”
“I’m just saying.” Potter was still unsettled. “If you’re planning to get that key thing and change back to liking girls at the end of the year, you should tell me now.”
Hope leaped inside Draco, in that stupid little place that still imagined Father and Mother could someday be back together, safe at home, with all of the horror of the war behind them. The more painfully experienced part of him cringed—Dawlish was showing him this for some very nasty reason. “What do you want from me?”
“Maybe you’re right,” Remus said, in that teacher’s way which meant of course you were wrong but you needed to work it out for yourself. He turned toward the door.
Draco hadn't understood at first what the Dark Lord meant to do. He'd known there'd be a price to pay for failing to kill Dumbledore. He'd just thought it would be Cruciatus or some other torture. He hadn't understood when the Dark Lord had brought out the black velvet box and opened it, revealing the key inside.
"You came up with something that did." Malfoy's hand smoothed down the back of Harry's head, coming to rest against the back of his neck, warm and maybe kind of tender. "And the rest of it?"
"I'm not fond of towers," Draco said. He knew it came out stiff and formal but he couldn't bring up that night, of all things. Potter would just remember how much he hated Draco and probably push him out the window himself, at that.
Harry swallowed. He'd forgotten all of that as the months had passed. Well, he'd told himself he'd forgotten. Wasn't there something he'd kept fresh though--the feel of male arms around his waist, a male body pressed to his back? Hadn't that been what had led him to play the twins's game, in the end?
Draco has managed to save his father from Azkaban, but at great personal cost--when Harry discovers Draco has been lying to him, he tells Draco he never wants to speak to him again. And Lucius, humiliated at having to be rescued, tells Draco he’s going to burn him off the tapestry, effectively disowning him. Draco is devastated, and in his extreme despair he impulsively climbs inside the Vanishing cabinet in his dorm room, thinking it will Vanish him into the other cabinet under the lake where he will drown.
Padfoot whines. His belly is not being rubbed! This calls for drastic measures. He sits up and begins to bark. Is it working? The boy is putting down his wand, he is turning toward Padfoot! He is stroking Padfoot’s ear, he is speaking human words. Padfoot strains, trying to remember what the words mean.
he howled at the fire, but he couldn’t cast it wandlessly and nothing happened. The key blazed up, flames licking at its magic. The emerald embedded in the key’s head began to smoke. Draco hurled himself off the bed and plunged his hand into the fire, his fingers closing around the searing metal. He yanked it out and threw it halfway across the room, away from his burning palm.
Dawlish was already moving down the path, though. Draco sucked up his nerve and followed him. He’d grown up with a healthy respect for how dangerous plants could be—the Manor Gardens were good for that—and stayed to the direct center of the path. To the right, the Venus Fly Traps were opening in the sun, turning up their toothed green mouths to the sky. Those weren’t anything to worry about. They were too small to do any harm to a wizard. The Mercury Fly Traps on the other side weren’t dangerous either, if a little more annoying. They were buzzing already, bright silver traps darting back and forth, stems aquiver as they snatched gnats out of the air.
Fuck.
"Potter, they had the whole school on lock-down for a year because Sirius Black was trying to kill you. Dementors everywhere—remember them? The Gryffindor portrait that got knifed? Any of this ring a bell? That's not exactly saying happy families to me."
Malfoy gasped. Harry saw why a second later—a tiny hole had appeared in the door. It was working! Part of him wanted to stick his tongue in Malfoy's ear and go
“I ought to be Senior Officer by now,” Dawlish went on pleasantly, as if they were colleagues discussing work over a pint at the Leaky. “But it seems there are too many bleeding hearts at the top who don’t understand what chain-of-command means.” He gave Draco a sudden, sharp look. “I did my job under Voldemort just like you did yours, little Malfoy. And with a few key memories undetectably wiped, I’ll be Head Auror in no time. I thought we might start with your memory. Just to be sure the spells work, of course. Now hand over the key.”
"Consider it our apology to you--"
Harry didn't mind. It was kind of what he wanted, really—the chance to find out what felt good without having to be
“Illegally, with Mr. Potter--”
"Come on, Malfoy," Potter said. His hand, tight on Draco's, gave a little squeeze. "Haven't you ever wanted to see our common room?"
and then Padfoot is on top of him, his forepaws landing hard on Remus’s shoulders, throwing him backward. Remus goes sideways out of his chair and lands hard on the floor—
Draco drew a breath. Greg had been right. It was nicer than what they had upstairs. Sunlight spilled in across a white-sheeted bed that took up nearly the entire room. It was clean and fresh in here, not dense with the funk of too many boys in too small a space.
A sound like an enormous balloon being burst next to Draco’s head caused him to startle so violently that Harry rolled right off him. Draco kicked frantically at the covers, scrabbling for his wand. But it was only an elf, doing that fucking house elf Apparition that ever since the war scared the hell out of Draco each time it happened. Of course, since the war a lot of things frightened him that hadn’t used to. Towers. Dueling practice. Malfoy Manor. Snakes.
Harry frowned.
Draco’s wand was moving already, though. The bedclothes peeled smoothly off the bed, stacking themselves neatly on a chest of drawers. Then the mattress was moving too, sliding off the bed to stand against the wall, taking its bed skirts with it. Harry was too confused, too unwillingly interested in what exactly was happening to pull them away now. Cassie was bouncing up and down in place, excited, hands clapping as the base of the bed was revealed.
“Padfoot! Oh God—Sirius—”
Blaise gave a final look around the circle then threw his wand into the middle of the circle. It hung in midair, still at first, then with a pop it blurred into motion. Faster than the eye could see, it spun, sending a little flash of light over each of them in turn. Finally it slowed, until a dot of silver light shone on Greg's chest alone.
“I always have,” Draco said. “Even when I thought I hated you. And I always will. I love you, Harry.”
“It’s why I didn’t heal my jaw,” Fred said. “My penance for having endangered you. Hurts like a hippogriff. Of course, I do need to heal it before we go down to breakfast. Don’t want to draw any more of McGonagall’s attention.”
"Destroy the cabinet completely," Harry said, fast as the thought hit him. "No cabinet, no connection."
Zabini was faster than he looked, and stronger too. His fingers dug into Harry’s wrist.
They had gone down one final flight of stairs, ending in a hallway where the portraits wore robes that were utterly wizarding in design and yet still somehow screamed Victorian. Maybe it was the generally air of stuffiness: collars buttoned tight and high, the excessively ruffled robes, or the monocle on one particularly irritated-looking geezer who sneered wordlessly down at Harry. Maybe it was the distance they’d come down, about halfway back to the first floor which equated to about two centuries in Malfoy generation time, Harry guessed. Or maybe it was the newspaper the mutton-chopped old wizard in the portrait next to him was holding, dated November 1855.
Draco shoved his tongue in Potter's mouth. Best way to shut a man up, in his opinion. Besides, talking had never been their strong suit. Potter's tongue kept moving, as if it hadn't realized talking time was over. Draco wrapped his own tongue around it and commenced sucking. That earned him a happy shudder, then all of a sudden Potter was on top of him, down to his boxers and humping Draco with shameless enthusiasm.
It chilled him to the bone within minutes, charm or no charm. The token in his hand tugged him downward and he started swimming, letting it guide the way. Harry touched his wand and whispered a spell and his eyes adjusted, letting him see in the ever-more-murky light as the token led him deeper and deeper into the lake.
“There it is,” Cassie squealed. “The nest.”  Looking to Draco for approval, she leaned into the tomb, reaching a hard wax hand inside. Rat-keys stirred, tails lashing, spilling out of the tatty rags inside the rib-cage. Brass bodies flashed in the light as they scattered.
The boy scowls at him. “Merlin, What’s the matter with you? If you want to get out of this godforsaken place, be quiet and let me fix the cabinet.”
Malfoy eyed him warily. "What did you have in mind?"
“The loony? I’m pretty sure he’s standing right in front of me.”
"Eloquent as always, Potter." Zabini turned back to the wall, facing a complicated series of curlicues that had just started to smoke. He sighed. "This really would be a conversation best conducted with Draco. Still, I suppose I should be delighted that you're asking anyone at all. Stopping to ask questions was never your forte."
Malfoy had a funny look on his face when he sat up. His tie was still a little damp, dragging as it wrapped itself around his neck. "What do you mean he's your—"
“I am extremely disappointed in your efforts,” Dawlish said, and for one sick, surreal moment, Draco imagined it was his father who stood before him, scowling down at him and telling him he’d failed; that this was all a sick joke, a mad test, Father wasn’t in prison, he was right here, he was safe--
See, though, what did that mean? Thinking about Nev getting hard while rubbing off against Luna—that was rather brilliant. But if Harry was getting hard thinking about a bloke and a bird together, did that mean he liked birds? Or that he liked blokes?
“Remembered what?”
With that thought, he scooted out of the Great Hall before the last bite of breakfast had properly reached his stomach. The map had Malfoy outside the castle, down by the kitchen gardens for some reason. Herbology project, he guessed.
And yet here he was. They'd told him to meet them here by the lake just as dinner was starting in the Great Hall and curiosity had overcome caution. Plus, they'd promised this was their way of apologizing. How could he not turn up for an apology?
, he had said, and he'd meant it, but it was so hard to keep the wand steady, the hole enlarging. Malfoy was trembling with exertion but the fizz of his magic kept flowing, and it called to Harry's, twisting together into something bright and powerful.
Worse, he didn't even have an exciting job to look forward to. Sure, he was going to be an Auror—they couldn't exactly refuse him—but Dawlish had made it extremely clear that Harry was going straight into the paperwork division. Too important to risk in the field, Dawlish had said. Harry had wanted to argue but he also wanted to be useful and good and do whatever the department needed, so he'd kept his mouth shut and just nodded.
The mist dulls him enough to let him wander through it for hours at a time, knowing nothing, feeling almost nothing other than a hollowness. It is bearable. But the mist is not strong enough to undermine his senses for good; after a time (what time? There is no time here) and against his own will, the dog puts his nose to the ground and seeks the way back to the Smelling Place, the spot to which he always returns.
Draco felt a surge of gratitude toward Flint, and then hated himself for it. If he was so grateful to be treated with the barest minimum of humanity, how was he going to survive the rest of the year? The rest of his life? At the moment he wasn't even sure how he was going to survive the rest of the evening. He hurried down the corridor on the far side of the common room before Nott could stop him.
and then slowly curving into a grin. “I’m going to kiss you, Draco.”
Harry watched Draco’s face as he worked through it for himself, mist-wrapped, outlined with the dark edges of the Black family Vanishing Cabinet. The Black family had been good at making love disappear, he thought. Fear seized him again—would the Cabinet itself, through long dark association with Sirius’s cruel family, have some way of repelling love’s magic?
At last he gives up. He jumps out of the cabinet, torn between wanting to nose in the rubbish for scraps and wanting to get away from the miserable frustration of this place and let the mist dull him back to something bearable. And then something extraordinary happens.
Fuck, he was really doing this. He was telling Harry how to suck him off. It was shameful and it was brilliant, and saying what he wanted out loud sent a deep shiver of pleasure through Draco, heating his face and his groin at once. And it wasn’t like a contract suck at all. It was like Harry wanted to give him pleasure because it would make him happy if he could. It was downright Hufflepuff.
Yeah, okay, it was. Harry knew that. It didn’t stop the thrill that was building in his belly and tightening his balls. It was a bad, terrible, utterly non-boring, stupid, thrilling,
Draco shook that off. He'd managed before and he'd manage again. Instead of mooning over Potter, he should be salivating at the thought of all the favors he could get in return for something as simple and mechanical as a suck. Slytherin House's fortune might have ebbed, but there was still plenty of strings that his dormmates could pull.
Draco stared at Harry, and then at the cup, which now contained a swallow of water at the bottom. As Harry watched, still stricken by what he’d admitted, Draco raised the cup to his lips. His mouth moved and his throat swallowed. Harry held his breath. Draco swallowed again, and again, drinking far more than the bit of water the cup had contained a moment ago. He drank until water ran down his face and throat, darkening his shirt, and he lowered his hand at last, sighing with pleasure.
He wasn’t going to be an idiot about this, Harry decided. He wasn’t going to just listen to the ugly old voices which said all he deserved were lies and abandonment. If Draco had good reason for what he’d done—well, that changed everything.
Nothing happened. Or rather, nothing useful happened: the spell shot out of the end of Harry’s wand and directly through the invisible barrier. Draco thumped his hand against it. “It’s not working. Maybe it needs to be from my side. Out of the way, Harry.”
“Merlin. Is that what you Gryffindors do, sit around telling each other how you toss off?”
"Make a mess and a house elf will come and fix it," Potter said with a conspiratorial smile. "There's no official way to summon them but I've found this works great."
Draco closed his eyes a moment. He needed just that long to decide that he needed this night, to armor him for whatever came tomorrow once he handed the key to Dawlish and Harry cut him out of his life forever. If he could have this one night, maybe he’d have the strength to get through all those tomorrows.
"That's enough, Mr. Malfoy," McGonagall said crisply as she entered behind them. "I doubt your House is entirely blameless in this matter, whatever it is that occurred." She raised her hand and beckoned the rest of the Slytherins in.
“When I wank,” he started.
invited these snakes in?"
"The short answer is the twins—"
Ron shrugged. "Don't know exactly. But it's always something with the twins. I told you not to do it."
McLaggen smiled magnanimously. "Of course you're not. It's not you, it's me." He waved a hand up and down his body. "Even completely straight blokes like Oliver Wood and Percy Weasley and Marcus Flint  and, oh, any number of others, want to be with a man who looks as good as I do. Oliver explained it all to me after Quidditch one day and when I asked Percy, he agreed. So have all the others."
“Yeah.” Ron looked down at him, his blue eyes bright. “It was bloody perfect. How’d you do it? I didn’t think house elves could be bribed--Fred and George have tried it hundreds of times. What’s the secret?”
the cabinets into the corridor outside the Room of Requirement and," he snapped his fingers—
Seamus was saying something stupid that boiled down to
"Malfoy had nothing to do with it," Potter was saying—
“Should I pull out?” Harry asked, his forehead wrinkling in concern.
Blaise flicked his wand and the scroll duplicated itself, making a copy for each of them. Draco opened his and scanned it. Standard negotiation contract, really. Favors given, favors received, penalties for non-fulfillment of terms by any party here undersigned. Record keeping of all things promised and all things owed, spelled to be correct and up-to-date at all times. The only difference was the words in fancy script across the top: Contract for the Cocksucker.

His whole body trembles as the boy pets him, warm, human fingers reaching deep into his snarled fur, sending shivers of pleasure from his ears to the tip of his tail until Padfoot cannot help but squirm beneath the touches. The boy is speaking, and his words are words of praise. A feeling Padfoot cannot identify bursts inside his chest, sharp and delicious as a sausage in his mouth, and he rolls in it. He is being petted and praised and loved.
Dawlish pulled out a tiny stone pensieve. With a tap of his wand, it expanded to normal size, water sloshing slightly inside, spilling out drops of water which darkened the stone table where they landed.   His smile was turning toothy and Draco was feeling worse and worse about this with every passing moment.
Though, honestly, Harry couldn't remember seeing Malfoy in the Great Hall yet this term. He'd skulked back to school along with the rest of the Slytherins, though if anything he'd looked even more pale and worn than the rest of them. Harry might have even seen Malfoy get pushed a little, here and there, seen him insulted and ignored. Harry didn't care. It served Malfoy right if even his own House wanted to bully him and who cared if he didn't feel he could sit down to dinner with the rest of them? Maybe Parkinson would bring him back a roll or two if he was lucky.
Seamus snorted right into his butterbeer. “Who’d volunteer for that? Even the biggest poof in the world wouldn’t want to be on call night and day to suck off us lot. Have to be mad to go for it.”
“We were, because he fucking thought he should lie to me about the--” Harry made himself shut up. He didn’t want to get into the business about the key in front of Nott. “Can we talk in your room?” he asked Zabini.
Harry should go upstairs and talk to him. Warn him how the cocksucker was picked.
"Head Girl. Ms. Granger," Zabini said with a smile that actually looked more genuine than political. "Thank you for taking us in." He threw a look at the Slytherins that was clearly meant to quell any
Potter's glance strayed to the sneakoscope, which hadn't budged. Draco knew it wouldn't. He was telling the absolute truth about this. He tucked into his pie happily, waiting for the follow-up question.
“Harry?” said Ron’s voice.
Now what was he supposed to do? The coin box beneath the phone rattled as something slid into it. Harry pushed back the slot and fished out a silver badge emblazoned with the word ‘Love.’ He grimaced, but at least he was going to be let into the Ministry—the phone box was already sinking and a moment later he found himself at the far end of the Atrium.
"No, it wasn't like that." Harry sputtered to a halt. He couldn't explain to Malfoy how very much Harry had wanted to suck his cock, and how long he'd spent denying he wanted to suck it, and how nothing had made him do it except for an overpowering desire to have said cock stuffed as far down his throat as he could manage. At least, not in front of everyone.
But the top of the tomb was swinging open, swiveling outward neatly on some kind of unseen magic fulcrum. Harry didn’t want to see but he couldn’t stop it—inside was a pile of bones, flesh thankfully gone.
"We use magic to close the cabinet doors, we might not be strong enough to push them closed physically but if we use a force charm—"
Impossible. The Room of Hidden Things had been destroyed. A shiver crawled down his spine, reached his arse, then turned around and crawled right back up. The last time he'd been in here, fiend-fyre had been sweeping the room with a predator's speed. Malfoy had been plastered to his back, arms around Harry's waist, and they'd barely made it out of here with their lives.
"Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize." Harry winced. If it weren't for the Vanishing Cabinets, the Death Eaters would never have gotten into Hogwarts, and Greyback would never have been able to ruin Bill's handsome face. No wonder the twins bore a grudge, though really, if it was anyone's fault, it was Malfoy's. Still, if the twins wanted to rip it apart, Harry doubted even McGonagall would care. "Well, I mean, right. Ruin it completely if you like. Make it never work again."
“Father,” he said quietly. Father didn’t hear him, of course. This had already happened. When? Last night? When he was with Harry, when he was happy for the first time in, well, fuck, years, had this been happening? Sick guilt swamped him, acid and heavy and dark. “Is he—” He couldn’t finish that. Was this Dawlish’s idea of a condolence call, letting the next of kin know in the nastiest of ways that Father was dead?
His wardrobe? Was the vain beast running late for dinner because he couldn't decide what to wear? Here's a hint, Harry thought with a twist of the lips: try the school robes. Only a Malfoy could dawdle over getting dressed in a place which had a required uniform.
"Fred says it's not the wands that change, it's us. He says we're the ones swapping cores back and forth." George leaned back on his arms, looking utterly relaxed even though the wand had finally started to slow. "That's nonsense of course. Sometimes he says things that aren't true."
, blowing it apart. He'd just plucked the key out of the box and tilted it this way and that, letting it catch the light. Then he'd thrown it into the fire blazing in the hearth.
"Wait." Greg pointed at the chart without meeting Draco's eye. "He didn't say what size."
“Of course,” Dawlish continued, “if he falls, he’s dead. Or turned.” Dawlish looked at Draco with mild interest on his face. “Which do you think Lucius Malfoy would consider worse?”
Is that all it was? A stab of disappointment went through Draco. He hunched in on himself. "You nearly got Snape killed a few times. Did you offer him a naked apology too?"
But if he admitted that out loud, he really would start crying.
eighth-year blokes," Nott said thoughtfully, "and we're in your dorm."
Slurp.
Draco yanked his head up enough to see Theo standing there, looking cool and unrumpled and amused.  Marcus was just behind him, peering around to see what was going on.
Draco drew a breath and pointed his wand at the same place as Harry’s. The water was rising so quickly, but it was exactly what they needed. “I’m ready. But let’s do it like last time, only both of us holding both our wands.”
“I arrest you under suspicion of trafficking in Dark Objects, multiple counts of prisoner abuse, and bribery,” the Auror continued, stumbling a little on the flagstones as she cast a Levicorpus. Dawlish’s bound body was lifted a few inches off the ground, where it bobbed back and forth as he struggled against the ropes of the Incarcerous.
and the doors of the cabinet burst open. It didn't stop there, though—metal groaned and wood snapped and splinters flew as the doors tore at the seams. Harry felt a hand on his collar, George pulling him backwards, and not a moment before he was safely out of the way, the doors ripped completely free. They fell to the sand with a heavy plop, one after the other, fluttering a bit then stilling, like wings pulled from a fly.
“Tell me how,” Draco said--painfully, reluctantly, necessarily, as he pushed the stag off his lap--“to get my father out of Azkaban.”
backtalk. "Regardless of what may have occurred to create the need for it."
Draco raised his chin. "He was a busy man, Potter. He didn't have time to sit around discussing your family relationships with me. I'm sure he never gave it two thoughts."
he blocked. The spell called up a gust of wind that rattled the shelves as it whirled the wasps into a small tornado.
them one by one. It was almost enough to want Snape back, Harry decided as he sliced open a particularly nasty slug: Ron would never have dared to slack off in front of The Iron Lips of Sarcasm. Slughorn, on the other hand, didn't notice or maybe he just didn't care.
Sweat trickled down Harry's back. It wasn't hot in here, not now, but he couldn’t be here without smelling singeing hair and smoking wood and remembering air so hot it had burned his lungs. Remembering Crabbe, who hadn't made it out, who'd blistered into nothingness as the flames took him.
"Your turn, mate," Seamus said cheerfully to Dean as he zipped up and turned away.
Comments and feedback are much loved and keep the chapters coming!
“What do you think?” Harry asked, moving to stand beside Draco at the foot of the bed, close enough to feel the heat of his body, but not quite close enough to touch. “Do you think it would be a good idea?”
When Harry had caught his breath again, he became aware that things were landing on the table around him. He raised his head and saw that Remus was Summoning cups of tea and biscuits. However, some of the biscuits were landing inside the teacups rather than on their plates, where they sank into the tea and dissolved into soggy blobs.
"What are you talking about?" Malfoy scooted over and cuddled up to Neville, just to be utterly infuriating. He ran a hand down Neville's abs and teased the dark curls around his cock. "You're exactly the same as me. Don't deny it—they did it to you too. Obviously."
"No. I do, strangely enough, have some mattress space of my own. I meant 'us' in a House sense. Slytherins on this side of the room," Draco waved at the tightly-packed beds on the near side. Then he pointed to the other side. "Gryffindors over there."
"I can't—" Malfoy panted, limped a step and then collapsed. The stone door slammed closed behind them and Harry sank to the floor beside him, pulling Malfoy into his arms. The rumble of water was still loud, ferocious, but they were on the right side of the charmed door now.
Harry shot him a look then kind of shrugged to himself and grinned and reached into his PJ bottoms. It didn't take long, just a half-dozen fast tugs, aided by the feel of a long-limbed male body next to his own. He breathed his climax into Ron's shoulder, shaking against his best friend's skin, and came down slowly, warmly, comfortably.
“The key is at the Manor, according to your esteemed Father. In a room only a Malfoy-by-blood can access.”
Draco met Harry’s gaze. “I want you to do exactly what I tell you,” he said.
He shook through the end of his climax, giving his cock a final come-slick stroke for that last spurt, and fell back on the bed. He felt Harry’s finger ease out of him, and Harry’s other hand on his forehead, pushing Draco’s sweaty hair back from his closed eyes.
They went up and up the stairs, which fortunately weren’t shifting around with their usual maddening randomness. Probably even the castle snapped to attention at the click-click of McGonagall's heels. He'd never even been this high up in this part of the castle and he was almost puffing when they stopped in front of the portrait of a fat lady in pink.
The twins turned. They smiled, not quite as one. Rather, it started with Fred's mouth and spread to George's, like a wave rippling through water.
Seamus was already standing up before Harry realized another round had ended. The others were laughing about how Seamus would be no bother at all to the loser—there'd be nothing but whiskey-dick from an Irish souse like him, so he might as well be out.
Harry’s ears rang from the crack of Apparition as he landed in the alley behind the Ministry. He staggered a step, then hurried around the corner and into the red phone box. He picked up the phone and dialed, rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet as he waited for the Welcome Witch or Wizard to answer.
Potter leaned in close, a smile playing around his lips. "Come on, then. Don't make me carry you across the threshold, Malfoy."
A moment or two more when he thought surely, yes, he was getting closer, and then suddenly he was there. Sound roared in his ears, a wave-crashing sound as if he’d had a conch strapped to either ear. Time and space collided, coughing him out with a sound like a mthroat being cleared, and then he thumped to the ground with a highly undiginified oof.
He would do it in a minute. Harry pulled the blanket over his legs. He just needed a moment to collect his thoughts. Decide exactly what words to use. How to make it sound less than hideously embarrassing. He wriggled down in the bed and tried to come up with exactly what to say.
"I thought you deserved something as nice as we could manage. You'll have to share with someone of course and it's so small there's really no space for anything but the bed, but it's better than being squashed eight or more to a room."
(See the end of the chapter for
“I want you to fuck me,” Draco said, and the words seemed to ignite the air between them. He felt Harry’s hand tense against his chest as Harry’s magic flared out, wild and excited.
“That was
"You're going to need this," Fred said. He waved his wand and a bubblehead charm formed around Harry's head.
Draco allowed himself a smirk.
At first it’s merely his own piss he smells, marking the path, but as he draws nearer the other scents begin to prick in his nose, reminding him of his situation.
“Yeah. And I want to come with your cock inside me.” To say it was to call it forth; Draco’s balls drew up behind his shaft, the pressure of his building orgasm vibrating out to encompass the stretch of his hole, the heat of their bodies, the power of their magic mixing. Harry was moving his hand on his own cock again, the side of his thumb and finger slapping against Draco’s arse.
“He’s been moved to house arrest at his place of residence for now,” Tonks said. “Wiltshire, is it? With overtime Aurors at every window and door, so yeah, I’d say he’s safe. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to Get this wankstain into a holding cell. We’ll send someone round to notify your mum as well. Let’s go, John.” She nudged Dawlish’s bobbing foot with one of her own, which, Draco now saw, was shod not in standard Auror wingtips but in some sort of Muggle boots that reminded Draco obscurely of loud, dissonant music.
Draco realized what Harry meant to do just before he did it. He put up a hand to stop Harry, but not in time—Harry was already leaping through the Veil into the Cabinet. Water sloshed around his waist, but it was pleasantly warm now, and felt weirdly comforting as it soaked through his jeans. Draco flung his arms around him, and for a moment they clung to each other, Draco’s jaw pressed against Harry’s temple, Harry’s mouth lodged beneath Draco’s ear. Then Harry felt the water sloshing against the sensitive skin of his nipples and disentangled himself to move behind Draco, wrapping his arms around him from behind. We’ll do it together,” he said. “Just like before.”
Harry tried to speak. But he felt as if it were he who was under the lake, thousands of pounds of water compressing his chest. The memory of himself deep underwater in fourth year, struggling to save Ron and Gabrielle and running out of time, the pressure in his lungs increasing as the effects of the gillyweed faded--
“Grieve in peace?”
A crack of breaking wards and the bed-curtains flew open. Blaise stood there, taking in Draco's cock and Potter's mouth, looking like the cat that ate the cream.
"Stop being melodramatic." A finger—Pansy's finger—poked him.
Harry smacked it away. "This is my job. I don't need your help." Still, as he lifted himself up, putting a knee on either side of Neville's thighs, he let his leg splay far enough to just touch Malfoy's.
Draco trembled inside. Eighteen years of pureblood training kept the tremble off his lips, kept his spine straight and his chin high. It wasn't the sex—he liked that. It was the humbling. It was Marcus showing everyone that Draco was bottom of the heap now. That he could force Draco to his knees in front of everyone. He hated that but what was pride worth when your family was in danger?
“Here’s the thing.” Fred sat up and looked conspiratorial, something he did very well. “It’s a lottery type situation. Everyone signs the magic contract and the loser is chosen at random. If you want to get free blow jobs for the year, then you have to take the risk of being the blower instead of one of the blow-ees.  The odds are on your side, though. Everyone wins but one.”
have to let tears trickle down his face? He was the one who had used the cabinets to betray them, after all.
Draco held his breath as Dawlish fitted the key into the lock and tried to turn it.
. His traveling cloak came flying into the room and he caught it as he stood. “Let me go talk to Tonks right now--she’ll know who we can trust among the Aurors. We’ll make a plan to catch them at it.”  A flash of amber in his eyes hinted at the wolf beneath his skin. “This is exactly what we’ve needed to end the guards abusing werewolves like this.”
He broke into a run, eyes fixed on that lovely bit of dark dog-ness, the only relief from the endless mist. The dog-shape turned, its woof sounding surprised, even ecstatic, and then it was bounding towards him too. Draco felt a moment of fear—what if it wasn’t friendly?—but barely let his step hitch. He’d done so much running in his life, all to save his own skin. Today, foolish or not, he was going to run towards another living creature who might need saving.
it, and he was panicking, just like in sixth year. Draco scrambled to his feet, and broke and ran, tearing past the gate and through the garden, terrified for himself, terrified for Father.
Draco tried out his own truth, mouthing it into the pillow instead of Harry’s ear.
“I want us to fuck.” Draco turned his head away, his whole body tensing, trying to prevent him from speaking the words he so desperately wanted. Beneath his palm, he could feel Harry’s heart beating harder.
“Show me. I don’t want to hurt you. Push my hand, I mean my finger, inside you, yeah?”
Dawlish, however, was looking around the garden. “No elves,” he said with satisfaction, and smiled. “Didn’t want any prying eyes for this.” He reached into his robes.
It's me, it's Draco. Your
"I told you, the dungeon's all dried out." The girl had to raise her voice to be heard all the way from the second landing down, where she'd heroically retreated. "So you don't need to be here anymore."
“Then we got him onto the good stuff—“
“Love, right, got it,” she said instead, underscoring it with an unimpressed final emery scrape. The phone dinged as she hung up.
Just like that, he was hard. It wasn't the kind of revelation he wanted, to be honest. He didn't want to be on his knees, clamped in place by one dorm-mate, who was humming something that sounded like 'Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love' while another not-so-gently laved his cock across Harry's tongue.
Fortunately Nev didn't seem embarrassed. Relieved, if anything. He undid his flies and pushed his regulation school trousers down along with his boring white pants and then, there it was—Neville's cock.
"Please," Potter said, "I know we should talk some more but I don't know exactly what to say—I'm just starting to figure some major things out about myself, you know, and maybe I should have figured them out already, but to be fair I was very busy with other things—"
“And is Voldemort—”
Wait. There was a way to make this even better. Draco grabbed a pillow and shoved it between Potter's legs. "Fuck this, Potter. I want to watch you get yourself off while I come down your throat and I want you to remember this every time you put your head down to go to sleep."
“So on a scale of Azkaban to Hogwarts, it was maybe a five?” Remus asked, in a moderately successful imitation of his normal tone of voice.
--didn’t know any of that. He was kissing Draco’s jaw, his earlobe, his ear. He slid his hand up Draco’s bare thigh, finding his erection beneath his shirttails. He wrapped his hand around Draco’s cock and began a soft, teasing pull.
What a hell of a thing to have etched into your skin for all time. Draco involuntarily touched his forearm through his shirtsleeve. Of course, there were worse things to have burned into you.
“What?”
basiliskcur and lefthandofglory
“Do you know where it might be?” Draco asked.
Malfoy's fingers stroked down Neville's thigh. "That I can do this better than you, of course."
“Go on, I’m right behind you,” Harry said, resisting the urge to push Ron out of his room. He waited until he had started down the passageway, then Summoned the Marauder’s Map from his trunk, and began searching for Draco.
Malfoy was leaning his forehead against Harry's again. "Twat. Once again you display a complete lack of understanding of the magical object in question." The look on his face was almost fond, though he was probably just fond of the chance to call Harry a twat. "Think about it."
The boy swears.
Something gave and when it gave it went all at once. The hole went from tiny to massive as the center of the door blew out. Harry's heart leaped with joy and relief and triumph all at once but he had no time to think about it. Water rushed through the hole, pouring out in a wave that swept them both out of the room and past the accursed door, sides scraping painfully as they popped free. It was too wet and too tidal to properly stand and so together they slipped and skidded down the corridor.
"Dearly beloved," Blaise said when everyone was settled, using that slightly ironic tone that he brought to everything these days. "We are gathered today to resurrect a long-standing tradition that has sadly fallen into disuse. It is a dark day that we, of all Houses, should have to be reminded of tradition by Gryffin—"
He shot a look over at Malfoy, whose hand seemed to have left the bollocks and moved farther back. Zabini's hips were tilted up and yes—Harry felt a surge of lust shoot through him as he realized Zabini was getting fucked by Malfoy's hand. As Harry watched, he jammed his arse down, grinding on unseen fingers, while his cock stayed firmly stuffed down Malfoy's ever-working throat.
Draco laughed, the sound coming out a little wheezy. “My family has lived here since the tenth century, Potter. Of course it’s more than four stories high. How could it possibly fit us all in otherwise?”
The dog let out a sigh that could have been a mirror of Draco's. It trotted off another couple of steps, then looked back, seemingly expecting him to follow. Draco frowned. "You want me to come with you?"
Draco's cock popped out. Potter stuffed it back in but he couldn't seem to figure out where to put his hands, not and hold himself up at the same time. A graze of tooth—Draco winced—
“That leaves you, little brother.” George reached up and ran a hand over Ron’s knee.
Then the man’s eyes snapped shut. His face twisted, his back arched, and Draco could feel his agony even through the distance of time and memory.  The man’s arms went taut with strain and manacles clanked as he began to thrash. Skin ripped, fur sprouting forth, a pelt painted silver in the moonlight. His mouth opened and he screamed, a human sound which morphed into a howl as his mouth elongated into a muzzle, his eyes sinking back into a canine skull. Face raised to the moon, the man retreated and the monster emerged entire, poised on legs turned into haunches, snout turning this way and that, sniffing at the air.
"If you don't open this door by the time I count to ten, it's coming down!"
His eyes darted to the snake wrapped around the apple tree’s trunk, as green and bright as the leaves on the tree. Each tree had one, its own resident serpent and if you knew where to look, you could find the fang marks on each apple, just by the stem, where their venom was injected. Wasn’t symbiosis sweet? Nature at her bloody finest--animal and vegetable, coming together to share a kill.
Harry scowled and thought about it. Vanishing Cabinets had been used to escape from Death Eaters, right? But you wouldn't want someone at the other end to be able to accidentally interrupt your arrival, so once the connection was established, it probably couldn't be stopped until everything had come through, which in this case was the entire contents of the lake—
How did he feel about that? Draco interrogated himself slowly, approaching his sense of self as if it were a small, skittish animal. The pain of being alive was still there, throbbing around a Harry-shaped hole in his heart, but the immediate need to be done with life was already ebbing. He put his hands to the dirt, pushed himself up, and stood.
Thanks to maesterchill for the beta. And thank you, dear readers, for sticking with us, and especially for all your comments! We appreciate every single one, and they keep us on track and connected to the story during the weeks that real life intervenes and creates posting delays. We've already begun the next chapter, so there won't be as long of a wait this time!
“Fucking sappy Gryffindor. Don’t you dare come in here.” But Draco’s whole face was alight.
Malfoy had completely stilled. His lower lip was caught between his teeth and his face had a tentative joy on it that made Harry's heart feel a little funny, in a good way. "You're not changing? You're staying this way, liking cock? Your whole life?"
So what was he going to do? They had a tracking spell on him and the Manor was far too large to wander around in, hoping to get lucky. A thought hit him—if they'd put a tracking spell on him, then they had one on Father too. Draco brought out his wand and murmured a locating spell. A bluish glow lit up around him. That would be his tracking spell. Draco turned slowly in a circle, and there it was, a faint, yellow glow of light no bigger than a bludger. He could follow it to Father.
“This isn’t about me,” Harry said, feeling like he’d walked into that one, but now he was here, he might as well keep talking. “It’s about Draco.”
Draco dragged his thoughts away from Potter as fast as he could, but humiliation was already bubbling up again. He touched his chest idly, running a finger along the scar that zigged across his chest, mirroring exactly the one on Potter's forehead. It ached at odd intervals, flaring sometimes into a pain as wickedly intense as the first moment the spell had sliced into him. Other times, like now, it was no more than a dull throb, an itch, a reminder of what lay beneath his clothes.
"Limerick." Dean leaned back against the common shower wall, out of the direct spray of his own nozzle. "Silly-sounding name. Highest rate of sexual assault in Ireland. A study in contrasts, one might say."
Harry took his courage in hand and rolled over, coming face to face with Ron, who had turned toward him.
. Except, maybe that would have been a good apology from the twins, arranging for him to catch Malfoy fucking his own fist, choking out his relief all by himself. Harry could have watched and then he could have taunted Malfoy with little details and let him get completely paranoid about how Harry had seen him—
"I want to do the very best job I can, McLaggen." Harry schooled his face into his best 'I-am-painfully-serious' look. "Don't you think I need to see all of you for that?"
“Of course. Three different kinds, as a matter of fact.” Remus led the way into the hall and to the stairs. “Plus ginger too, I believe.”
Okay, he wasn’t going to think about Malfoy but anyway, with this everyone was going to be getting sucked. He wouldn’t have to come on to a bloke, try to guess who was or who wasn’t into that, get marked out as some poof when he didn’t even really know what he wanted. He could get his cock down another fellow’s throat and still be exactly like all the others.
Malfoy pulled him a little closer. Neither of them were talking about the 'wrapped close as lovers' part of this, but there it was. "Potter. Get me my wand."
"You like that?” Draco asked the dog, who seemed temporarily transported by the apparently marvelous smell of a well-worn jumper it had found. The dog's tongue lolled out as it looked up at him, and if an animal could talk, Draco would have heard a reverberating, heady yes, yes, yes.
He hadn’t really taken that in during their argument in the hotel, had he? He looked back at Remus. “Draco said--well, he said Lucius was being threatened in Azkaban by a werewolf. I mean, by the guards, using a werewolf. He said something about Dawlish, that Auror who’s monitoring Draco’s probation.” It was all coming back to Harry now. “He said Dawlish had stolen a grimoire from the Manor and was making him get the key to open it or else he’d let the werewolf tear Lucius up. Turn him. Maybe just eat him.”
“You almost killed me and Malfoy, do you realize that?”
Sodding Gryffindor show-off. Draco’s cock had no objection to the display, however. The power of Harry’s magic was a fucking turn-on. It always had been, even before Draco was old enough to get properly hard. He was properly hard now, though: between the snogging and that
Widley returned, whisking away their soup bowls while their laughs tapered off and they pulled themselves together. Potter's hand had strayed close to Draco's and he wanted to take it, to feel those broad fingers laced in his.
"Everything!" Harry smacked the apple down, sending little white chunks flying. "Why would you agree to suck cock for any reason other than that you secretly want to suck cock? Favors? Negotiations? What kind of Slytherin shite is this?"
Malfoy was already shaking his head. "Won't work. They're layered in protection charm on protection charm. Indestructible, at least in the time we have."
Granger looked principled and determined. Ready to argue with the Headmistress no doubt, which was just the pointless waste of curried favor that Granger would go in for. Weasley, on the other hand, was staring at the Slytherins like a pack of Acromantulas that had stopped by for tea.
“Not necessarily,” Blaise started.
Remus laughing now? Had he gone completely round the twist? Was the house doing something to him? Wand in hand, Harry hesitated. The last thing he wanted was to go back down to the kitchen, but he couldn’t leave Remus alone if he was in trouble, even if Remus had told him to go. An inarticulate shout, sharp and wild, echoed up the stairwell, and that decided it. Harry rushed back down the corridor and hurried down the stairs, the door swinging shut behind him with a smug click.
Draco nodded excitedly, his hand tight on his wand. “Okay, let me try.”
Is it possible that someone else might come through too?
The words buzzed in Draco's ears, a swarm of venomous insects. And his body seemed to be slowly petrifying itself; he was rooted to his spot, unable to move, or speak, or think, even, unable to make sense of what was happening. His father's gaze was full of a hatred Draco had never seen directed at himself, not even when his father had been at his most displeased.
"It's fine." Harry started to lie down a little, then felt really awkward and sat up again. Maybe he was supposed to be a little more business-like about this? "Just. Maybe you should?' He waved a hand too, in a gesture that he hoped meant 'take your trousers off'. He couldn't take them down for Nev, could he? It seemed a little, well, eager.
McGonagall’s voice jolted Harry back to reality. Professor McGonagall had drawn herself up in her chair and looking very fierce. “I can assure you,” she said, her voice ringing with conviction, “that Mr. Malfoy is
His mind flashed back to years ago, watching from around the corner as Dudley and his friends played some game. There's been a spinner attached to a paper square and one by one they'd flicked it. It twirled and when it stopped, they'd shrieked and argued and moved pieces around a board and he had never, ever been invited to play.
The Auror said something over his shoulder and a second Auror appeared beside him, a tall dark-haired witch with thin eyebrows that were currently drawn into a scowl as she gave Draco the once-over. Then she turned to the first Auror, a stocky ginger. "Put a tracking spell on him," she said, as if Draco weren't standing right there. "Send him in and monitor his movements. If he goes anywhere but straight to his father, sound the Alarm and we'll arrest him as well. That'd be a nice treat to bring the guv, eh, Pribbling?"
Dawlish stood, gave him a nod that was so professional it was an insult to Aurors everywhere, and strode off. Draco stayed behind, sitting at the stone table. He turned his head rather than watch that smug retreating back, trying to focus on the greenery instead.
No. Instead he was going to focus on the way the meatballs were plumping up nicely. There’d be a good crop ready soon. The marinara mosses, on the other hand, he realized as he stood up and made his way over to them, were still a little watery. Maybe more of that onion and garlic mash they liked so much? Or maybe some opera? They’d perked up nicely when he’d sung a little
“You don’t even
Harry's heart beat faster. They didn't have much time left but Malfoy couldn't think of any reason this wouldn't work and he was nearly as smart as Hermione. He grabbed Malfoy's hand and tugged him until they stood directly in front of the door. "Get your wand ready. They'll work underwater, don't worry about that, just put everything you have into it."
Malfoy kept one eye on Harry, bright and wicked, and started sucking Zabini's cock in earnest. Zabini moaned with pleasure and his hands tightened on the sheets. Malfoy was up on his knees now and his own cock was visible between his legs, hard and leaking.
Harry loved him. Draco could feel it as surely as he felt the tip of Harry’s cock pressing into his arse. Draco gasped at the shock of it, the stretch and the fullness. It was almost too big, and it almost hurt, and yet there was room.
“Exactly,” Harry said, though he hadn’t actually given any thought to how Expelliarmus worked.
"But--" Harry's head was swimming, as if the equations had worked themselves inside his brain and were merrily crawling themselves across every available thinking-surface Harry had. He shook his head trying to clear it. "Just tell me where it is," he said. "The key. That's what's needed to put him right."
"No, of course not. All of you snakes are gone."
“Sorry, what?”
unbraid it, find the scent, follow the scent
“I promised no such thing.” In truth, Draco scarcely knew what Harry was talking about--he was too overwhelmed by the fact of Harry on his knees before him, gazing up which such a look on his face--a look of flushed arousal and something else, something shining in his eyes, something that looked a lot like--
But here he was, in this new world, alone yet upright. This time tomorrow the moonlight would turn the man in father’s cell into a mindless, vicious beast, and Father wouldn’t be there.
, Harry thought a little wildly.
Cassie sniffed. “The house elves used to keep the floor in here gleaming.”
that load shot down his throat, even though Nev was clearly wishing with every fiber of his body that it was Luna's mouth he was bucking up into. Should Harry pull off? Maybe it would seem too eager, too weird—but before he could decide either way, Neville's hips were arching up, his back bowing. The sounds coming out of his throat turned deep and guttural, lower even than a groan.
“I love you,” Draco said desperately. “I always have. The key never changed that. I was bi before, this
hissed inside his head, like he had his own personal adder stuck in there. All he wanted was for Malfoy to prove he wanted Harry.
“A lube spell, you prat. Here--” Draco shut his eyes, concentrating. He could barely cast wandlessly, but if Potter didn’t even know what the spell was, a wandless cast would do well enough, not to mention look impressive.
Harry gave his hair a final sharp tug. Any minute now he'd have the courage—or lack of social grace, whichever—to just yell,
"I'm going to
His father's brow wrinkled in pain. Slowly, he shook his head from side to side. Draco stared at him, the humidity beading wetly across his head and chest.
The door banged open and the twins shouldered through, knocking Slytherins aside. "You wretched little snake," said the one who had to be Fred. He was at the bed in a moment and looming over Malfoy with loathing in his eyes. "Knew you'd find out about the contract and you didn't waste one minute taking advantage of him, did you?"
Minch straightened in his chair, seemingly uneasy in the face of Harry’s silence. “Hear you’re gonna be an Auror, Mr. Potter, right soon enough.” He squinted, looking suddenly wary. “This a check? You’ll not find any irregularity here, sir. Minch does things by the book.”
Back to Draco. Fortunately, the Vanishing cabinet does not spit him out under the lake. Instead, the cabinet deposits him in land full of nothing but mist. Draco is relieved he’s not dead and begins searching for a way back. While investigating his new surroundings, he discovers he’s on the other side of a Veil he once saw in the Department of Mysteries. He tries to get through it, but is thrown back into the mist. He resumes wandering around, trying to formulate a plan. Eventually he meets a stray dog, who, judging by his matted fur and protruding ribs, has been stuck in the mist for quite some time.
"Harry, please," Neville whispered urgently, "I'm close, I promise, just don't stop."
Draco had said. An image from an old nursery book of Dudley’s flashed into Harry’s head: the Pied Piper, playing a flute so very like the one that Draco held, with a tide of rats pouring toward him.
"Cold and wet, dear brother. Cold and wet! And we'll give our Harry here the very best seat in the castle, to watch our righteous glory and enjoy!"
Harry wasn't sure he was reassured it was George. Fred was meaner but George was deeper and of the two, deep was usually more dangerous.
Ron was still grumpy by the time they started Potions. Harry had to do all the chopping and dicing and stirring—Ron just sat there, pulling long gray hairs off his wand and
“Yeah,” Draco echoed.
Three left. Ron, Harry, and a twin he thought was George. That was a two-third chance of a Weasley cocksucker. He'd faced worse odds. Still, his stomach was twisting with anxiety and fear and anticipation.
The elf’s eyes grew wide and her ears drooped down until they touched her shoulders. Draco swore at himself. If Potter woke up and caught him being rude to this house elf, there’d be hell to pay.
“That. That’s good. Play with me. With my balls. Get me ready.”
By the time Draco managed to focus again—and he could be excused from paying close attention, he thought, on account of having just nearly drowned—Potter was saying something else about this whole incident being Gryffindor's fault, really, and therefore Gryffindor should invite the Slytherins to live with them while it was being fixed.
idea.
. The cabinet took on a faint glow of activation then Fred flicked his wand again and the cabinet dropped, smacking the water with a sound like a cannonball. Slowly its chilly glow disappeared into the lake. "Not too much time now, I don't think."
Ron looked up from the floor, his face anxious. “You mean it?”
Head down, he hurried past the fountain, trying not to attract attention. Lord knew he didn’t want to shake hands and pose for pictures right now. Luckily, it was leaving time and no one seemed to be paying attention to anything other than getting into an outgoing fireplace.
Harry looked at Draco for help, his heart beginning to pound. How could Draco stand there surrounded by so much death and act as if everything was fine? How could you make a future when the past was always talking to you? And how was Cassie any different from those awful pincushion hedgehogs they’d had to make first year, stuck somewhere between fabric and flesh, neither one nor the other? The whole Manor was like that, he realized. And all this death was working its way inside him, winding its lifeless fingers around his heart and lungs as surely as Cassie wanted to wind her hand in his. He needed to get out of this place before Death found him again—
"But what if the way I feel about Potter is because of the Dark Lord? Voldemort destroyed my key.”
The Weasel still hadn't managed to move beyond 'gobsmacked' but Potter was bouncing on his heels with enthusiasm.
“What do you mean, don’t worry?” Harry resisted the urge to preemptively cover his hair. “You’re not the one with a head of hair that literally everyone ever has told me looks like a bird’s nest. What if it looks like a bat’s nest too? A nice, tempting black-hatched, raise-a-family-of-little-baby-bats-in kind of place—”
“Go on,” was all Remus said.
He has nobody—
Shame slid along Harry's skin, hot and prickly. His neck was probably turning red. He hadn't felt this small and stupid since Aunt Petunia had caught him looking at shirtless pictures of footballers. "You don't like blokes? Is that what you're saying?"
He felt more than saw Malfoy's nod. Fingers tightened under his on the wand and at the same time, they both breathed out a firm
"That's wrong!" Harry stared at the wall. The equation had changed again. It didn't show numbers now so much as a scene. Malfoy, small, looking like he had the summer before they had started Hogwarts. Malfoy, trying to look brave as he sat on a bed in a hospital gown, staring at a thick-bearded man in Healer's green. "That's horrible! It shouldn't be allowed!"
Draco looked up, confused. This was what Dawlish wanted? He’d expected something a bit… well, Darker than a book of obliviation spells.
Fred finished getting to his feet, rubbing his jaw all the while. "You should have asked us first, Harry, we would have told you. I understand wanting to smack someone after getting blinkered by that albino worm but don't blame us—"
A host of objections flew into Harry's brain and he reached for one. "That's not fair! What if one of them just naturally comes quicker than the other? That's not about skill of the sucker. It's the bloke's fault."
Sirius?!?!
Seamus reached out and cupped Harry's jaw. Harry almost jerked back, surprised, scared even. There wasn't supposed to be any fondling.
, Potter. That’s French for
A nasty feeling was coming over Harry. His voice dropped lower. "What did Lucius do? Tell me."
“I love you,” Harry said again. “I fucking love you.”
“No!” Draco shook his head. “Please no. It’s good. It’s really good.” He began wanking again, trying to ground himself amidst the almost overwhelming feelings pouring through him. It was all so much. “I want to make you come,” he managed to say.
Harry grabbed Neville's cock but his attention was fixed on Malfoy. "What mistake? Put the cock—" he lifted it to his lips, "—in the mouth. That's how sucking cock works. It's not advanced arithromancy."
Draco laughed. “Anyway, they don’t start swooping around until twilight.” A gleaming white marble trail was snaking out ahead of him, like some kind of yellow brick road through a sea of shite. Gloopy bat literal shite.
When he reached the stone-flagged kitchen he pulled up straight. He stared. Remus was on the floor, hugging a man with wild hair and a wilder grin on his face. Harry’s knees gave way, like they’d forgotten how to hold him up. He folded into himself, knees coming up, arms wrapping around them like he was back in the closet. It was too much like a dream, like the ones where his parents came back, and then he woke up, and it wasn’t real. He couldn’t do this. It would all be snatched away from him again.
Draco shook his head, a little confused but not worried. “Not there. It’s the Flesh-Eaters’ Garden. There’s nothing for the kitchen in there.” Still, Draco felt his muscles tensing again as Dawlish peered at the untidy rows within the walled space. Maybe he’d been right the first time and Dawlish did want to catch him out? “Professor Sprout said I should only come in this space with her. I’m not supposed to work in there alone.”
Harry winced. “They wouldn’t have let you talk to him.”
Draco stopped, breath drawing in as the mist thinned enough to show what the dog had brought them to. It was a vast expense, filled as far as the eye could see with Vanishing Cabinets. Piles of refuse lay in front of each one, as if each one had vomited forth decades' worth of unwanted household debris.
"Father? Father, it's me." Draco took a few steps forward into the room. The laundry steam was already working itself into his clothes. Inside his robes, his shirt clung wetly to his back.
Flint looked at him curiously. "All right there, Malfoy?"
Harry stopped moving, looking questioningly at Draco.
Footsteps rang on the stairs and suddenly the door banged open, hitting the wall with an audible shudder. Draco wiped his mouth, checking for stray traces of come, before swiveling to see who it was who'd been raised in some kind of door-banging-open barn.
"But—" Granger's hands fluttered like memos at the Ministry.
“Do you?” Harry asked.
Seamus was in there. Dean too. They weren't doing anything interesting, though. Just soap and water and ordinary shower things.
He curled into a ball, shivering, his steam-soaked clothes now freezing against him in the evening wind. The equations in the Arithmancy room hadn't shown this part, the part that happened after the equation was solved. He thought of the chalkboard in the Muggle Studies classroom, where at the end of class the professor took an eraser and rubbed it across board until everything that had been written there turned to a fine white dust.
Remus’s cheeks turned pink, but he looked sternly at Harry. “Promise me you won’t do anything foolish.” But even as he spoke, his whole body was turning toward Sirius, and when his eyes met Sirius’s, they both seemed to forget Harry was in the room at all.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco would never, never understand them. He'd spent endless hours dissecting every last move that Potter in particular and Gryffindors in general made and every time he thought he grasped them at last—they respected only bravery, they cared only for their own side, they mouthed platitudes and then connived like the rest of the world—they surprised him. Well, Potter and McGonagall had surprised him, at least.
Potter's lips turned down in an actual sad little frown. Gryffindors and their visible emotions—it would be useful, if they ever felt anything that made sense.
"It's you, mate. You were having a nightmare." Ron's eyes were sympathetic in the low
Shrink them?"
Malfoy flushed. "Community service. Or did you forget?"
Ron flopped down on the unmade bed and then sat up again, wrinkling his nose. “Harry, mate. If you’re going to be, you know, doing your contractual obligations in here, you might brush up on your freshening charms.” Ron slipped his wand from the pocket of his pajama trousers and waved it over the bed. The scent of lemons and lavender filled the air, reminding Harry of the smell of the Burrow. He felt a sharp stab of guilt, made worse by the fact that Ron didn’t even seem angry with him.
. That made him stop and feel a little extra odd, extra anxious. Was he allowed to tell people they were shagging, no cocksucking contracts involved? And was he really going to call Potter Harry now? Was he going to call him that in public? Harry hadn’t said that Draco could do that. Was public Harry-ing automatically included in this declaration of mutual shagging interest? But it was more than that, because Harry had said “romantically.” Unless Gryffindors had some special definition for the word. They probably fucking did. If you were a Gryffindor, “interested romantically” probably meant ‘sweet talk the person into bed with you and tell them you’ve been wanking about them since fourth year and then after you’ve shagged them, kick them out of bed and never speak to them again.’
Neville groaned. "Luna," he whispered under his breath.
Draco reached between their bodies as well and began stroking himself. The feel of his own hand on his cock calmed him a little. Harry’s finger traced a slow circle around the naked wrinkle of his hole, then moved away again to play with Draco’s balls, his fingers teasing along the seam of Draco’s sac, pulling gently on the soft wiry curls as he watched Draco wank. Draco let his head press deeper into the pillow, his legs fall open. He was beginning to relax into the release of sex now, the tightness in his chest loosening as Harry played with him, his fingers alternating between cupping Draco’s bollocks and petting his hole.
“The key is with the Librarian.” Draco gestured awkwardly at the bed. “Cassie’s got the Librarian’s attention. She was right—the key we need is one of the ones which nests with him. He’s going to let me open his tomb and get the key.”
The water was up to his chin. He'd been so intent on the door that he'd barely noticed it climbing higher. Now it was lapping at the ends of his hair and inside, he could feel his magic tiring.
"Yeah. Yeah, that's good." The tension went out of Neville's body. At least, the bad kind of tension went out. His thighs were already tightening again. "A little faster though, maybe?"
“But Professor--”
--And releasing. Unsprung, pleasure pulsing through Draco as he came, shooting all over his chest, and Harry was coming too, swearing and shaking, his body rigid over Draco’s, his cock spurting in Draco’s hole. Harry let himself drop against Draco, his chest hot and damp, smearing Draco’s spunk between their bodies like glue.
Draco got his cock into just the right position too and gently lowered Potter's mouth back onto it. This didn't need to be rough but it was certainly going to be thorough. Sometimes the Slytherin just had to take charge, he supposed.
Draco laughed as he led the way forward. “No, of course not. I mean, we have a ghost or two—by the way, if you see a lady in white, run.” He rolled his eyes. “She’ll talk your ear off and she’s so dull I’d rather listen to a banshee. Come on,” he said with a hand wave, leading them down a small corridor and opening a door to a expansive, somewhat frilly in a 17th century way, bedroom. “I have someone I'd like you to meet.”
Right. Taking a deep breath, Harry forced himself to let go. Nott flung himself down on the sofa, clearly outraged but too afraid get into a fight--either magical or physical--with the Chosen One.
“It’s Expelliarmus,” he said to Draco. “That’s the right spell.”
Hermione waved that off. "It was the right thing to do. Especially if it was our fault." She turned to Harry, looking more worried. "It wasn't something you did, was it? I know the war was terrible but you wouldn't have deliberately flooded their dorm, would you?"
"I said, cut it out," Pansy whispered with an ever more pointy poke. "You know we love you."
Too late. Draco could see even before the key hit the floor that the emerald had vanished.
Blaise hummed as he worked. The letters danced as if to music Draco couldn’t hear and he longed, again, for a talent like Blaise’s. Maybe he could have found solace in some remarkable ability in the war years, if he’d had one. Well, one other than fixing failed charms like the one he’d repaired on the Vanishing Cabinet.
cocksucker. You're going to have to get your own."
“No, Draco Malfoy is lying in bed after being rudely awakened, wondering what you’re on about.”
It was empty, except for Malfoy, who wasn't wanking. Not that Harry wanted to see
“Draco? It’s okay just like this. This is so fucking good.” Harry moved his hand, his knuckles brushing against Draco’s arse as Harry took hold of himself, wrapping a hand around himself to keep from thrusting. “I love how you feel on my cock,” Harry said, his voice hoarse and low. “You feel so good around my cock. Draco. Just like this, I...Oh fuck, I’m so close already, I--” He broke off, his face tensing in an effort to stave off his orgasm. “Just from this,” he continued after a few breaths. He touched Draco’s cheek, his chest. “From you. I want you so fucking much, I...”
"Oh, and this," George said, adding a charm that would keep Harry warm in the lake.
“Perfectly understandable. So you got into a fight. Because…?”
Draco thought, because he couldn’t bear to let himself think his other feelings into words. Aloud he said, “Cast a double-strength
“Of course I’m right, Potter,” Draco said, with an old-school sneer that Harry now saw was a thin disguise over deep insecurity. He pointed his wand at the junction of Cabinet and Veil and called out, “Adhesio!”
Draco tensed. He knew what he needed in terms of favors and it would be a hard enough sell as it was. If there was another strong offer on the table, he was sunk. Blaise's eyes flicked to him. Would he take pity on Draco? Let him have this?
Thanks to maesterchill for the beta!
“The Vanishing Cabinet,” Harry said. “Draco went in there, didn’t he.”
“Sirius is dead. He can’t see anything I do anymore.”
Malfoy didn't answer. Just sniffed a bit. Harry wasn't sure if it was a scoffing type sniff, or a teary sniff, or just a water-up-the-nose type sniff.
"Now get him down on his knees. You kneel behind him too."
“I think it would be a very good idea. There’s so much misunderstanding. So much of a gulf that we haven’t even tried to bridge. The more reasonable faction of the Old Guard would be relieved that the Saviour is thinking of them at all. It would go a long way toward allaying fear in the old families if the things they know were officially deemed worth teaching.” Draco laughed, a suddenly open sound. “I don’t know if you’re a fool or a genius—half the Wizengamot will love you and half will hate you, which is probably normal for you, just this time you’ll have switched which half is which.”
Harry's head whipped around to look. Zabini was standing there in the door, looking cool and collected.
The next chapter will be posted Saturday, June 23. Thanks to everyone who's reading along with us! If you're enjoying this fic, please let us know! We love to hear from you, and your comments make our day. We're on tumblr too, at
Draco shivered. He knew Father’s answer: he’d rather be dead. Draco also knew his own answer: he’d rather Father was turned. Father would loathe being anything less than pureblood but how could being an ‘animal’ be any worse than being a Death Eater? Animals only killed for food, not crackpot ideology. “You said nothing had happened to him.” As if hours of terror were nothing. “What does it matter, then?”
Harry forced himself to remain seated. “I’m sorry, Remus. That’s awful.”
But he didn’t know what he wanted, just that he wanted it to be different with Harry.
He leaned forward and started at the base, licking upwards, getting it wet enough for his hand to easily slide up and down. He rubbed as he went, tongue making little circles, and when he reached the top he spent a moment lapping lightly at that sensitive spot just below the head. Marcus's legs were spreading and Draco pulled back just enough to blow a hot breath of air over his wet cock. Marcus shuddered, hot on cold, then before the first groan could even escape from his throat, Draco was plunging his head all the way down, taking his cock to the root.
“Of course you were,” Remus said, his words slurring a bit, either from the whiskey he’d been drinking or from the shock. “We knew that. It’s just, you know, being beyond the Veil is the same as being dead, in case no one ever told you that, you stubborn shaggy monster dog. Happy birthday, by the way. You always did have a flair for the dramatic.”
“You’ll get used to it after a while,” Remus said. “I did.” He looked up, his worn face creased with sorrow. “If you’re not going to drink with me, then go away, please. I hate that you’re seeing me in this condition.”
Harry’s aim was sharper, more true. The Seeker in him had it. The smart, sensible voice inside himself said to let it go. That nothing good would come of taking anything out of this house but Draco himself. But the Seeker won. Hadn’t it always? The rat-key scratched him but he closed on it anyway, ignoring the long raised mark that appeared on the back of his hand.  Wordlessly, wandlessly, he hurt the rat right back, smacking it with
George gave an inexplicable crow of delight. “But you’re a step ahead, young Harry! Well done!”
“Not after Pansy started coming,” the doll complained and oh God, her face was clearly the face from the portrait, Harry could see as she came into the light, with the same painted lips and pearly teeth. “She didn’t like me.”
“Don’t come in,” Draco said fiercely. “It’ll be the flooding dorm in Slytherin all over again. This time let’s have one of us on the outside of the problem.”
.  As always, thank you for your comments, kudos and recs--they keep us going and we appreciate each one so much.
Harry sneezed and goggled simultaneously, wincing as his eyelids tried to open wide and snap shut at the same time. He didn't see the twins but he did see, over there, a marble bust, and a little closer there was a pile of empty sherry bottles—
“Teach me to suck you,” Harry said, his breath hot through Draco’s pants. He mouthed over Draco’s hard-on, trying to draw the tip between his lips, Y-fronts and all.
A boy. There in the distance! Padfoot bounds toward him, toward a boy smelling of fear and shame and tears and snot, and Padfoot will make it better! Here he is to make it better! He leaps up in greeting, his forepaws coming to rest on the boy’s shoulders. The boy staggers backward under Padfoot’s weight, and Padfoot licks and licks him, cleaning off the tears and pain until the boy’s skin tastes only of astonishment and relief. And then, the boy’s hands begin to pet Padfoot behind the ears!
Wherever exactly that was. Well, it wasn't like he didn't know where it was in general, he wasn't completely hopeless, but he couldn't see it. McLaggen's bollocks were big—of course—and they were blocking the view.
Anyway, Harry realized with no small amount of satisfaction, he didn't need to ask anyone else. He could ask Malfoy himself. What was the point of having something as amazingly useful as the Maurader's Map if you weren't going to use it to track down pale pointy gits and ask them intrusive questions regarding their sexual preferences?
Potter moved somehow—it was too fast to feel exactly what happened—but all of a sudden Draco found himself face down under Potter, the rug's rough fibers rubbing against his cheek. Fuck, the rug was rubbing against him everywhere, not just his cheek. Even through his clothes, he felt it on his nipples, his cock. A grunt spilled out of his mouth and his legs spread helplessly.
“Especially around the bollocks, if you recall--Oi, Harry! Easy there.”
Draco rubbed his toes together, fast enough to start a fire. Maybe that way he could warm up. Maybe it had been done to Potter too? That must be it. He'd thought the Potters were too progressive for that, but then again, they were rich. Father said reformers like that talked a good line about getting the procedure banned, but when it came to protecting their own money, they still did it. Potter's parents were dead but his father's will had probably stipulated it.
cock, thick and hot to the touch.
thing yesterday. “I’m sure they can’t hurt you,” he said, starting right away on his plan to be more sensitive. “They’re not even very big, as snakes go.”
"That was a bloody long detention," Nott said, jerking his head in the direction of Slughorn's office. "Given you've been skiving off the contract all weekend, that makes it three sucks you're in the hole for. I'll take the first one right now." Nott's smile turned sharp and bright as a knife. "In the common room, I think. Flint said he'd bring me a plate from dinner. I reckon he wouldn't mind you doing him as well."
“And… and tongue me. Under the head of my cock. Like, Oh. Oh fuck, Harry, yeah. Fuck, like that.” Harry had it now. Draco gripped his shoulders, telling him with his hands and with the long sound leaving his throat that it was so good like this, Harry using his tongue and hand together, his mouth so hot and soft and wet on Draco’s shaft. And then before Draco could say what he wanted next, Harry was doing it. He trailed the fingers of his other hand along the seam of Draco’s bollocks, back over his perineum and to the soft hair ringing his hole. He stroked there, light and feathery and perfect, his touch calling forth bright shivers of pleasure from every cell of Draco’s skin. And then Harry’s hand grew slick with a wandless
Harry had risen to his knees on the mattress, and was staring down at Draco where he knelt on the floor, his whole body trembling.
There they were. Harry spotted them at last just past a shelf full of glass eyes, between a pile of feathered hats and a neat stack of unstuffed teddy bears. They were standing in rapt concentration before a pair of dark wood cabinets and—this couldn't be good--looking rather pleased with themselves. A desiccated apple lay on the floor in front of the cabinets, next to the yellow-feathered body of a dead canary.
!” Harry blocked the hex, which bounced back at Nott, causing him to stumble sideways, into a shelf piled with gardening trowels.
Draco looked up, startled by how easily Harry was able to say he’d be up for Draco’s prick in his arse. For a moment he let the image wash over him; Harry spread out beneath him on the bed, his knees hiked up to his shoulders, his cock rock-hard against his stomach, his hole on display. For Draco to enter, to do what he liked. Arousal and fear: the urge to take Harry, open him up and fuck him. And the power of it frightened Draco, a sudden pressure in his chest that felt like diving too far under water. He was afraid of having that power. He would do the wrong thing with any power he was given, he always had.
"Just one?" Blaise had leaned forward with interest, elbow on knee, resting his head on his hand.
Harry pushed his magic down, suddenly ashamed. He could get a little scary when he was mad, he knew that. Killing a Dark Lord didn't hurt your reputation either. He opened his mouth to call after Malfoy, then paused, and let him go. He'd talk to Zabini first. He'd find Malfoy later. Make sure he knew that he wasn't the one Harry was mad at.
Harry raised an eyebrow, awkwardness melting into the pleasure of seeing Malfoy with what looked like fettuccini stuck to his shoulder. "I'm sure a much better question is what are you doing here? I never took you for the kitchen gardener type."
"He ripped out Malfoy's desire to fuck? Malfoy doesn't like sex?"
Well, folks, it's here. The final chapter. After three plus years! Thank you so much to everyone who has hung in there with us. Your comments, recs and kudos meant the world to us and helped us keep connected to this fic over a far longer stretch of time than we imagined it would take when lefthandofglory first cooked up the idea way back in the winter of 2017.
Draco felt a sudden sickening clarity. He pulled out of Potter's embrace and rolled to the other side of the bed. He understood exactly why Potter was asking. It happened all the time. Potter was looking for some fun before he got changed back. A temporary boyfriend, one in the same boat as Potter: a pureblood who would be going straight soon too. A boyfriend who wouldn’t make a fuss when Potter ditched him for some girl.
Harry turned toward the creak of the bed without letting go of the jacket. Remus was on the side of the bed just like he’d thought, hands on his knees, leaning forward and looking down. Patient. Kind. All the things they said a wolf could never be. Harry shifted a little. “Aren’t you going to ask me if I want to talk about it?”
Inside his head, Harry went
“Draco’s not at Azkaban, Harry. Nor is his father. Malfoy senior has been removed from the prison and placed under house arrest in Wiltshire--”
Instead, Malfoy's hand on the back of his neck squeezed with what felt like a sudden happy shock. His magic spiked too, crackling all across Harry for a moment with a tingling joy.
. The ask box is open.
“What are you doing here?” Draco snapped out, moving on to the important question. Blaise had moved closer to him, his hand within squeezing distance. “There’s nothing you need to say to me.”
Draco woke face-down with something heavy on top of him. Something heavy and warm and breathing deeply. It was like being pleasantly smothered by the world’s most loving blanket, except perhaps for the hard cock nestled between Draco’s arse cheeks, which wasn’t a feature of any blanket he’d ever owned. Unfortunately.
Malfoy wasn't at breakfast either. The Slytherins kept to their own table but Malfoy wasn't over there. A desperate curiosity seized Harry. He wanted nothing more than to jump to his feet, stalk over to the Slytherin table, and demand to know the results of their cocksucking contract. Only the smallest hair of propriety held him back. That, and the fact that he really didn't think he could ask about that, even under
On the plus side, Harry thought as he went into his dorm-room, it meant he had a few free periods with no one else around and no stupid extra duties to attend to. He dropped his books and threw himself on his bed feeling pleasantly free for the moment.
“Then I’ll come in,” Harry said, and started toward the archway.
“Haven’t you done enough damage already? We’re going to McGonagall.”
"See?" Seamus said. "Now you get behind him, Dean, and pull his arms behind his back."
Potter slid his fingers down over Draco’s temple, cupping his cheek, his hand lingering there in what could only be called a caress. Draco tensed. Maybe now they’d reached the part of the dream where Potter chucked him out of bed and the whole of Gryffindor tower popped out from behind a curtain to jeer at him.
“But he--” Harry tensed when he heard himself—that so-revealing pronoun. He’d never told Remus about his suspicions that he might like blokes better than girls, and now he’d just spilled the beans. But Remus didn’t look surprised, which was more than a little annoying. Who wants to be known better by other people than you know yourself?
Draco shuddered as it turned a yellow eye on him. He hated snakes now. Humiliating for a Slytherin, but how could you live in a house with the Dark Lord’s darling Nagini and not be terrified of them? His heart sped up a little more as its forked tongue flickered out, hoping he’d come closer, but that was good—at least now he had a physical threat to excuse the thudding of his heart. Then it moved, gliding down the trunk and it was coming for him, he
“Well, I wouldn’t. Blaise, you know what the Dark Lord di—”
"It's me," Harry said as he watched his name etch itself onto the bottom line in firm black script. "Why is it always me?"
Malfoy gave him a scared look, then grabbed the shovel and hurried off. Harry knew that expression—he'd seen it on Malfoy's face at the age of eleven, running from a dead unicorn and the black-cloaked thing that hovered over it.
Harry breathed deeply as Sirius’s scent calmed him, soothing away the vicious stitch in his side he got when he needed to cry and wouldn’t let himself. To be fair, he thought, face pressed into the soft leather, if Sirius were here, he’d probably make things with Draco worse. Sensible advice hadn’t really been Sirius’s specialty. He probably would have recommended Accioing a load of custard into Draco’s pants or maybe going back to the Manor and pissing on a peacock. They’d have had a contest to see who could turn one from white to yellow fastest and then would have gotten chased back to the gates by a screeching, pecking, furious flock. They would have had to go to St. Mungo’s to get healed and they’d have lied their heads off when asked why they were beak-savaged, only to laugh about the whole thing later as they’d gone out and gotten trolleyed--
Draco stayed face down for a moment, contemplating everything in his life which had gone wrong. It took a while. After a bit, he realized it would be faster to count up everything which had gone right, which was depressingly concentrated in his younger childhood, which was now contaminated with the knowledge that it was all setting him up for the horrible fall from grace which was everything from about age sixteen until now.
Anyway Nev was really getting into his theme, which seemed to be
Harry wasn’t entirely sure, although he wasn’t keen to let Draco know that. He’d simply called out the first thing that had popped into his head. “Do you see a sign for something called the Lumi?” he asked.
Draco felt as if his throat was closing up. He sipped a breath of air and tried to get all the words out as fast as he could. “Dawlish has got a werewolf in Father’s cell, to torture him. But Dawlish said if I get the key to the grimoire he stole from the Manor, he’ll take the werewolf away.” The look on Harry’s face was terrible now, but Draco pressed on, desperate to make Harry understand. “But I know he’d just find some other way to torture him, and then Blaise showed me in the Arithmancy room that if I could just get Dawlish the key then I could free him, and I have to, I can’t do anything else, he’s my father, and Blaise said if I did it someone I loved--would never--and that’s you--” he broke off, because if he said another word he would start sobbing.
“Watch now.” Dawlish pulled them back until they were standing with their backs to the door. They had a marvelous view of the room, especially now that the moonlight had found its way across the floor, lighting up the space.
“But how did you get back?” Harry pressed.
“Right this moment?” Draco laughed at the question, which obviously had nothing whatsoever to do with his current problems, relationship-related though they might be.
. It seemed to be Neville's curse to be caught in the background of the most angstful moments of Harry's life. That year when Voldemort had been sending Harry nightmares, Neville had been across the room, watching with scared eyes. Neville had been there in the Hall of Mysteries, watching Sirius fall through the Veil. Neville had been there watching as Harry went out to die fighting Voldemort.
he left unspoken, because it sounded pathetic enough in his head without voicing it aloud. “I thought you wanted to get it to prove it was serious between us, that you wanted this to last but if you haven’t even decided—”
“I don’t think straight boys snog each other,” Blaise said softly. “Not even when they’re just messing about.” He looked back at Draco. “Voldemort took away the part of you that would have liked girls, but who’s to say you didn’t like blokes too? I think you were bi before. Like me. And when the Dark Lord destroyed your key, maybe he did break one part of you. But that doesn’t mean the part that’s left is broken. That’s still you, Draco. And I think it always has been.”
Dawlish stopped, fortunately, at a small stone table in the middle of the garden. The back half was even more unnerving than the front. The whole back wall were triffids, triffids, with their orangey tubular stems as large as a man, which was also their preferred prey, apparently. There was also something equally large and truly weird with waving tendrils in the corner called Audrey, and as for the innocuous-looking apple trees—well, those were the creepiest of all, as far as he was concerned.
The cup squirted another jet of water, this one soaking Draco in the center of his shirt.
Outside he could hear the room fill with seventh-year Slytherins and Gryffindors, arguing about space while Weasley tried to take control. Draco trusted in Potter's Silencio and didn't try to stifle the moans that started spilling from his lips as Potter got their cocks lined up. The friction was intense, fantastic, so perfectly different from his own boring right hand.
Harry tipped his head, watching as Draco ran his hand down the invisible wall holding him inside the Veil. Then he nodded. “Yeah, I see what you’re saying. We can do that. Reducto, like we used on the door?”
“Draco.” Harry’s eyes were bright. “You want that? You’ll let me?” When Draco nodded, Harry rolled on top of him, pinning him to the bed and rolling his hips slowly against Draco’s cock.
Remus had paused and was watching him with a quizzical look. “Harry? Is there something you know?”
“Right now I’m asking a Slytherin.” Harry’s hand slid down to the base of Draco’s cock and cupped his balls, rolling them gently over his palm.
Harry's cock twitched.
Draco shivered and pushed his tray away. It had been a shock when Father had taken the glamour off his arm and shown his Mark for the first time. Draco hadn't wanted to believe it at first but the alternative was, what? Not to trust the man who had fed and clothed him all his life?
“You sleep on top of your tombs. It’s not just the Librarian, is it?” Harry’s urge to save Draco from this sick, past-obsessed place had risen ten-fold. “That’s why every Malfoy needs their own bedroom. That’s where you’re going to be buried. It’s not really a Manor. It’s a mausoleum.”
Out of the corner of his eye he could see Malfoy. He wasn't bobbing up and down like Harry. Lazy git probably couldn't be bothered. Instead he had angled his head and taken Zabini's cock deep, so deep the tip had to be in Malfoy's throat. He was just holding it there, not moving. Well, how good could
Draco was nodding, yes of course. Instead of moving to the portrait to take it from the wall as Harry expected, however, he moved instead to the bed, flicking his wand and saying
Harry hesitated. He didn't want to go in the water, even with the charms in place. What he really wanted was to go back to the castle and into the Great Hall and have his dinner sitting beside Ron and Hermione. Hermione would nag him about his study schedule and Ron would chime in with something older-brotherish and he'd enjoy it and ignore it in equal quantities as he shoveled beef stew into his mouth.
"What's it to you?" Greg was up now too, trousers closed, and standing behind Draco. It was almost heart-warming, having Greg at his back again. "You're not even in this room. Weasel said you've got something better than this. You're the one shouldn't be in here, not us."
He almost turned on his heel to Apparate. It wasn’t the lack of a destination that stopped him—he was thinking he’d try Malfoy Manor. It was something off, something wrong by the standards of Grimmauld Place. What was it? A sound—laughter?
"I never did understand why Snape hated you so much. Don’t get me wrong, it was desperately amusing especially when it came to Potions, but I didn't get it." It was silly but Draco was glad to hear it--at least this wasn't the standard Potter apology package. It made him feel a little daring and he flicked his fingers peremptorily. "Also, keep undressing. I didn't tell you to stop."
“Oh, nothing yet.” Dawlish’s voice carried a hint of a smile. “Look--if he stands very, very still, pressed tightly into his corner, he’s perfectly safe.”
Potter stopped. "You're not mad, are you? That I inherited Grimmauld Place? Did you want it?"
He turned back to Dawlish, watching as he pulled a miniaturized holdall from somewhere in the folds of his Auror robes. A tap of his wand expanded it to the size of a carpet bag; Dawlish then removed a large, leather-bound book from its interior, its ancient cover worn to suede at the edges. The grimoire. It was held shut by a thin slab of iron that connected the entire front cover to the back, sealing in the pages on all three sides.
Not until he flung open the door the Map had led him to did he understand. Their bodies touching all right, but not because they were fighting. Draco was on his knees facing away from Harry, his head buried in Nott’s groin. Nott was leaning against the wall, eyes closed and robes open, his hand in Draco’s hair.
When he could make himself look up, McLaggen was beaming down at him. "Same time next week? I can't give you more than once a week—sorry, Harry, not even for you—there's just too many people who need what I can give them. It wouldn't be fair."
Neville gasped and his hips jerked hard as he tried to thrust. "Oh, god, Harry, yes. Don't stop."
“I’m so in love with you.” Draco wiped at his eyes. “Now look what you made me do, you Gryffindor arsehole.”
“Oh,” Harry breathed. Draco felt his hole squeeze closed around Harry’s finger, felt the solidity, the pressure. He felt the stillness. Harry didn’t move, and once Draco was sure he wouldn’t, he turned his attention back to his hand on his cock, the sliding pleasure coiling in his groin with every stroke.
Thank you so much for reading! Real life continues to make significant demands on both authors, so the next chapter will be posted on Saturday, August 4. In the meantime, your comments, kudos and recs keep us inspired and we cherish every one!
Draco tensed. Was Potter going to ask more about Father? He'd never understand Draco's need to help him. He'd think it was some deatheater-saving-deatheater thing. Not a son doing what was right.
The Knight Bus disgorged him before another set of high, dark iron gates, so that for a moment Draco thought he had gone nowhere. A moment more and the view resolved, of course, into the front gates of Hogwarts. They swung open slowly, giving him the first hint of welcome into what was already seeming like forever. Of course, there was no one here, just him and the cold iron curls that spelled out the school's name. It wasn't a real welcome, just a bureaucratic response—he was on the list of students and therefore he could come in.
