"So what should we call you?" Dudley asked between mouthfuls. Harry looked a bit shocked. She had thought that they would have hit her over the head with a frying pan. But she wasn't sure if they were just acting civil, since she was only there for a day. She hadn't even been on full terms with it herself. Was she any different as Harry or Harmony? She noticed that they were waiting for her to respond.
Blaise looked like he wanted to say something to Draco, then thought better of it. "Send me an owl, if you get bored." Blaise said instead. Draco nodded him off, and waited alone, as the last of his housemates made their way to the train.
The first few weeks of June found a subdued Draco Malfoy. He didn't even have the energy to be hacked off at the Gryffindor prats who acted as if they had won something. Who glared at him as if he was supposed to be sorry that the Dark Lord was dead. As if he cared.
"Focus, Harmony," Draco said, "know how I am blocking my memories and thoughts from you."
"I want to apologize." Harmony turned to the window, and shut her eyes. Why was he doing this? She didn't want to hear any more.
"I just needed to talk with wonder boy here," His voice stressed over boy and she wondered what Malfoy really did know. "Till next year, and remember what I said about the glasses." He left after dropping the glasses onto her lap and giving her a quick wink.
When it was time for Defense Against the Dark Arts, the Slytherins were obviously split in two. Draco knew very well where he would have been if not for Harmony. Leighton must have noticed as well as he looked at their guarded stances. "I hope you are all thinking happy thoughts," he said, "because today we will be practicing the incantation." It didn't look like his house mates were so enthused, but Draco felt otherwise. His spirits were uncommonly high, and he watched Harmony from the corner of his eye. She stood with her dorky circle glasses and rubbed the side of her face. Draco noticed that he wasn't the only one spying her. Ron had his death glare aimed at the girl looking boy, and Draco wondered if she noticed. Harmony was standing next to Nevile, and Draco wondered what a scene he would make if he went over to her. It's not like his friendship with her was secret, and as long as they didn't know the complete specifics as to why he was so interested in her, Draco didn't see the harm in going to the Gryffindor side. Half of his house already despised him, and the rest wouldn't dare talk to him.
"I think we cornered Longbottom and spilled ink all over his bags."
"Wah?" Dudley gave another not so intelligent reply. So Harry might want a bit of a fight.
He walked past all the destroyed finery, toppled paintings, and broken chunks of marble wall that used to be his home. As he made his way back to the elf, the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw children chattered at him, but he ignored them, not hearing the words that they said. All he could focus on was getting to Dobby and then getting Harmony to St. Mungos. As he walked, he heard footsteps and turned to see Ginny and Luna stepping out of nothing, as they pulled off Harmony's invisibility cloak.
"It came sooner than he expected." The office opened, and McGonagall went to the desk, where two packages sat. She opened them up and Harmony frowned at the seemingly useless objects. What use did she have of a cracked ring and a fairy tale book of Snow White.
The next thing Draco knew was that he was on a bed and in the worst pain he had ever experienced in his life. This was a hundreds times worse than when that mad hippogryph nearly took his life. His skin felt like it was burning alive and worse was the vomit that just wouldn't stop. The fever had wrapped his mind delirious and he gladly took whatever the nurse was offering. He could just barely make out what was happening around him, and voices echoed like bugs in his ears.
"Keep it, the night is still cold." He said, and gave a hint of a smile before closing the door. She meant a thank you for saving her, but this was okay. She stared determinedly in front of her, careful not to meet any of the three pairs of eyes that shot her glances. He was right, it was cold and the too big jacket covered her thin clothes.
"I'm going to Professor McGonagall's room," Harmony snapped at him, as if he would know where anything but the dungeons were.
"You heard Harry," Ginny warned, "leave."
"Yeah," Harmony muttered.
"I don't care if I get a years worth of detention, and I could do other things with this wand, like shove it up your pompous arse!" He gave her another smirk.
"Did someone curse you or did you lose some kind of bet?"
"Hermione!" Ron sputtered, "don't encourage them."
She didn't have her glasses on, but her Harry face was good enough as she made her way to the kitchen door. There was a stifled hiss from beyond the kitchen and Harmony knew that Kreacher must be up. "Great," Harmony muttered under her breath and turned to leave.
"Yes she does, except she has her father's hair." Snape though glared at her.
"What, done already?" Draco could easily imagine the sneer on his father's lips.
It couldn't be real. It was preposterous. He hoped beyond anything that Dumbledore would saunter in and laugh like it was some big joke. But the headmaster didn't come back. It was so unfair, his whole life was one screwed up disaster after another. He wished the tears (he told himself that they were manly tears of anger) that clung to his eyelids would drop dead in their tracks. He could not tell Ron or Hermione about this, at least not yet. They would not understand and he did not want their pity. How could he face the world, with all of its expectations and succeed? He would never be the boy who lived, no girl would date him now, and he was to be a sodding girl!
"Oh, really."
"Try it on me first then," Snape said, "and I will block you out." Draco did as he was told, and Snape did indeed have everything bottled up somewhere too deep for anyone to penetrate. It was like going into a black expanse of nothing, a deep ocean with something dangerous lurking there. Draco pulled away and felt a slight headache forming. "That is how your mind should be blocked." Snape said, "now try on Harmony." Harmony at first didn't meet his eyes, and Draco didn't blame her. He wouldn't want her plunging into his deepest thoughts and memories. When she did look into his gray eyes, Draco went right past her green windows and everything was there. he could sense her fear and the way that she tried to scramble her thoughts away. He could sense all of her emotions as if they were his own. Draco didn't want to go digging, but easily scooped up her memories as if she were a shallow pound, with her thoughts as fish.
Reality slowly returned. Draco did not feel excited about his upcoming match with the Hufflepuffs. Not when he no longer had a team to watch his back. Plus, the Hufflepuffs were so easy without Cedric. Cho Chang was hardly any competition either. Would catching the snitch even impress her? He doubted it. Draco touched the ground with his foot and dismounted. He followed his white foot prints back to Hogwarts.
When he looked at her, her face looked slightly amazed and then a light pink dusted her cheeks. Draco really wanted to know what she was thinking.
"I don't care," she leaned in for a kiss and put a hand on his chest. She felt wonderful against him, like the flutter of a Snitch's wings before his fingers clasped around the gold. He brought a hand to the back of her unruly black hair and deepened the kiss. She tasted sweet and crisp like biting into an apple. He could imagine the feel of her skin, just under her shirt, the heat of it. He longed to follow the curves, press against her... but of course that would be ungentlemanly. He stopped their joined lips, and pulled away as if waking from a memory.
"I'll decide later if I want to go," she said.
"Diary?" Harmony's eyebrows nit together in thought.
"I'll wait for you," Ginny said before the door separated them.
"Then it's settled," Draco made his way back to the room, where three people watched him. "I would like to join these lessons, professor." Leighton looked at Harmony, and seeing her shrug, he scratched his head.
They boarded the Knightbus, heading straight to the empty third deck. Harmony took a seat on one of the beds, and Draco slid in behind her, and immediately began lifting up her shirt.
"Just a locket," Kreacher said.
"Sorry, but I don't plan to ever fall for you, I am completely uninterested." Harmony said, not looking at him.
"You got the hots for Potter. If I didn't know better, I'd think the same as well. But you're not a poof, Draco. I can't exactly figure it out, but I know when somethings up."
Harmony wanted to yell in frustration, maybe to even call for help, but she had no idea where she was. Ginny had blindfolded her when she was ambushed in the common rooms. "Your glasses are here in this purse, which you will bring with you." Ginny held up a lavender bag. "It's a good thing that I retrieved your invisibility cloak, and snagged one of your dresses."
"Will you go out with me?" he asked once more and enjoyed the bewilderment in her eyes.
"You're trailing blood," Snape remarked. "Sit down." Draco had no choice but to lean against the wall as the man scrutinized his ankle. He had forgotten about his leg. Draco rolled up his pants from his ankle, and looked away from the tender mess. He didn't complain as Snape took a wand to it and bandages wrapped in tight circles around his leg. Snape helped him from the floor and steadied Draco.
"Draco?" she asked, "what, did you miss the train?" He looked down at the noticeably shivering Potter and grinned.
The peace was momentarily broken when the compartment door thrust open, and Ginny burst in, hugging Harmony. She pulled away to get a good look at her and gave a half smile. "Maybe I shouldn't have spent half my summer worried about you. Look at you!"
"It's silly though," Harmony muttered.
Harmony didn't know what to think. She wouldn't have cared if she was a guy, so what would make her see him as any different. Had Draco changed? She didn't think so. She was just studying him, she told herself. Such a rapt attention she would pay anyone. If it were Ron, surely then she would be doing the same. The image of Ron drained from her mind as Draco's shirt revealed the muscles which were more developed than she had thought. Her gaze traveled up to his face, to the smirk and keen eyes he presented her.
"Very well then, you both will have a detention, separately."
"You entered the Dark Lord's mind without even knowing it." Snape marveled at the girl's ignorance. "That must stop. Has this ever happened before?"
"There is a reason why you are the boy who lived and it goes beyond that of your mother's love that saved you. When you were born I told James and Lily to be wary of Voldemort and to not tell anyone about you but those closest to the family. I also urged them to keep your real gender hidden too. Harry you really are biologically a girl. I will tell you the full story in my office since this isn't the place of secrecy" Dumbledore looked away from Harry, but not before he could see the man's eyes shining and the seriousness etched in his features. Harry was at a loss for words; for like two seconds, when it hit him in the face.
"Yeah, all they need is you here Ron." Harmony said with a smile.
Mr. Malfoy laughed, and took a step, "I'd like to see you try."
"It's been a day," Draco said, "classes are cancelled, and -well Dumbledore's funeral is tomorrow."
"Wait up!" she called as the shops began to fall behind and the trees sprung up around her. She stopped when she noticed that the footprints were no longer dog tracks and instead boot prints. "Sirius!" she whispered loudly, though no one would hear her from Hogsmead anyway. Harmony huffed in breaths, scanning the area for Sirius. She saw him on top a boulder, with his feet dangling to the side. "Sirius!" she said happily, and rushed over. He waved at the girl and dropped down from the boulder with a smile ready at his human lips.
"No, Dumbledore's keeping your secret. We've already met."
"Ron." Hermione said in an undertone, that Harmony nevertheless heard.
"In Dumbledore's possession is a ring that he has destroyed. He told me only that it was yours, but I could tell that he was hiding more." Severus was treading in dangerous water.
"Harmony," he hugged the girl, bringing her close. Harmony took off the glasses that were on her face and willed her real appearance to show. he smiled down at her, and Harmony barely noticed the deeper lines that creased his charming face. "Oh, how I missed you," he said at last. "It's much too dreary to be cooped up in that house."
"What are you talking about?" Draco asked clearly amused.
"Alright," Leighton smiled, "I hope you are all in a good mood because we will be thinking happy thoughts today." Draco frowned at the older man, already anticipating something horrid. "As I have been told, two years prior there were dementors on school grounds. I would think that you all are informed of what a dementor is capable of. Now, knowing the spell that repels dementors could very well save your soul, but I am surprised that only a handful of students have learned how to do it. So do any of you know the name of the spell?" Leighton asked them.
The bookshelves loomed over his head in menacing columns while the darkness encompassed the endlessly large room. He figured that the restricted section would be in the very back, but before he could explore, he heard a curious noise. He turned in the direction and lauded his bravery only to take a step and fall on his face. "Oww, bloody wanker," he said and looked for the object that tripped him. It was a pile of silvery fabric, embroidered with a curious set of geometric patterns. Someone just had to leave it right where anyone could trip over it. He was instantly glad no one witnessed such a humiliation.
"Gah!" Ron uttered a faint squeal "….I don't see anything."
"Why would you ditch the party in the first place then?" Harmony shrugged her shoulders.
Nothing bad happened as they looked at each other, there were no crazy fathers, friends, or intruders. It was just them, and Harmony couldn't have enough of the drunk feeling as if punch had filled her to the point she was almost intoxicated. "So I didn't scare you away," Harmony kissed him and it took him a few seconds to actually answer.
Students kept still, wondering if this was all a farce, some kind of wicked joke their professor played at. "Why aren't you moving? Time is potions." They struggled up, scrambling to move and not be singled out in attention. Ron gave one desperate look at Hermione before straightening his frame and slinging to Millicent. Harmony regarded the very much comfortable Malfoy who waved her over to the back of the room. Even though he wanted to play nice, she still couldn't trust him. He definitely had a hidden motive, or at least something up his sleeve. She had to go along with him for now.
"Harmony, as a friend I want to help you in any way I can, but if that means following your wishes, and allowing something bad happen to you, then I can't do it." Ginny held out her palm to Harmony. "Trust me."
"Draco...," Harmony said, softly at first, but didn't know what to say. He lifted his head from her, and Harmony saw that his eyes were pink and caught the bright light.
"It's not about failing or passing," Draco said, "potions can be helpful."
But Harmony found that she had six months of habits ingrained into her. She was embarrassed to find that she started to miss certain things, only after a day. Not having anyone to hold, or kiss, or flirt with, was strange. Even worse, Harmony had plenty of opportunities to antagonize Ron Weasley, and she had no one to share in the fun. Where could a girl get an audience, or better yet, a Slytherin audience, when she needed it?
"Ha ha, professor, you mixed up the whole speech and gave me the girl version of the talk." Harry waited for Dumbledore to laugh and say some funny thing, like 'oh that's right, you are a boy, I totally forgot'. Harry was getting desperate when no such response came.
"Makes me wonder what you are thinking under all that hair," Draco said, "when most wizards or witches would do the obvious thing and use magic to get what they need." He hadn't moved away. Ever since she was young she had been used to small enclosed spaces, but this was different for her. She had never really gotten close to people. The choice was hers, to push away or let him do as he pleased. To follow and be lead, or to shove him away before anything started. She felt warmer, and wondered what he was thinking.
"Harry, you must stay with the Dursley family for at least a day, they must miss you dearly." Harry gave Dumbledore an exasperated look; the Headmaster would never understand that they would rather celebrate his death than be in his presence for an hour.
After dropping off her bags and stepping into the Pegasus Diner, they had ordered their food and were each in thought. "Professor, have you ever been married?" McGonagall was silent for a time and then sighed.
"Just ignore the oddities of the room, Leighton probably just wrestled with it and won," Harmony mumbled as she scanned around. They stood in the middle of the room and shadows fell across the floor from the setting sun.
He stopped at the Quidditch equipment room and Harmony almost bumped into him. He lifted the cloak from her and Harmony stepped away. "I remember you using this cloak," Draco said, "at Hogsmead one year."
"And a snake's poison?"
"What did you say to her?" Ron demanded.
She crumpled the paper and shoved it in her pocket. "It's nothing," Harmony mumbled to Ginny before she could ask. There was no sender, but Leighton would have used it in code. She looked across her shoulder to the Slytherin table, but there was no Malfoy present. The message could have been from any of her fellow students, male or female. It could have meant nothing at all. The food disappeared and the students rushed for their next class.
Ginny gave a crooked smile before opening the door to leave. "Harmony, It's not your fault, some things are beyond our control."
Albus Dumbledore arose from his chair, tugging his beard free from where it got stuck in his lower robes. He readjusted the blue silk with magical dignity and cleared his voice.
"For the same reason that you kissed me back," he said, and Harmony moved closer to grip the front of his robes.
Harmony drew in a sharp breath before closing her eyes. This could not be happening. Draco stood rigid along the wall, watching the two.
"It's pitiful, isn't it?" Harmony turned at the sound of the soft voice, and gasped as she recognized her mother. "The Horucrux that Voldemort never intended to make."
The extendable ears worked their way down to the crease between the door.
"I guess you can say that," Draco opened the doors of the dinning hall. "Potter isn't a complete arse."
The rest of the train ride passed uneventful, and the others soon forgot about Mafoy's intrusion, but Harry couldn't help but wonder if he really knew that she was a girl. She kept on envisioning Malfoy's steel eyes and feeling the ghost outline of his slight touches. It bothered her, but she forced her mind to bury it.
"You need to learn patience," Ginny huffed at him, "do you honestly think that Harmony will be happy if you storm in there?"
"He hasn't killed me yet." Harmony replied with a half smile. If she was in her caracal form, she would be purring, contentedly.
No, there was still hate in his heart.
"Anywhere really."
"A blue-eyed black lemur," Kingscross answered him, "or also known as the Sclater's lemur. Here Dash!" Leighton held out his arm, and Luna dropped from the tree, landing on his head. They stared at her, and Draco was surprised to see that she had wide ice blue eyes. There was something creepy about looking at the lemur, like there was a familiar face behind the unkempt fur, one with human intelligence. He could see the wisdom, even as it examined the top of their Professor's head.
"I don't care if you get three detentions if you skip. You are going!" Harmony frowned in protest.
Something latched to her wrist drawing her into a dark shadow. She was about to scream when cool fingers covered her lips. Her heart raced. The hand lowered. "You're late, Potter," whispered into her ear.
"Let's go to class," Harmony said as she slung her bag over her head, allowing the weight to shift on the convenient hollow of her waist. They walked undisturbed the entire way to potions.
He had been looking over at Harmony, still worrying and checking if she had recovered enough when he first saw it; a speck in the sky. Draco knew as he locked his eyes on it that there was something wrong about that dot of black outlined against the sun struck clouds. It approached and Draco heard whispers around him of "what is that?" and "It's not coming here-is it?" of the restless Slytherins around him.
"twelve rose thorns," he said in a bored manner, "a teaspoon of arsenic."
"How dare you," Voldemort snatched up his wand, "come here, imperio."
"Do you even know why you are a woman?" Harmony asked suddenly.
"What? What are you talking about, Snape hated Harry." Ginny said.
Wizard dancing with Sirius was much better than when they were learning to Ball room dance during the Triwizard tournament. Sirius knew all of the regulated moves and could teach her to spin around and know the proper steps at the right beat. By the end of the afternoon they looked like a decent pair, and he was able to show her some of his own moves that were fun to mimic.
"I can't believe that you were held prisoner by a couple of muggles. Next time, get captured by a Lethifold and a pack of werewolves, you'd probably stand more of a chance against them." Draco laughed.
"I know that you're right, he was giving her extra lessons. But what's Snape up to now?"
The snowy owl swept out of the open window and Draco followed, high into the air and above the clouds. The rush of the wind and the freedom of the open skies lifted his spirits for the first time since his mother's death.
"I thought I heard a rat behind me," Harmony said, "but I was mistaken, it was you." Draco grinned down at her, and chuckled.
Ginny was the first to pass through, and Draco had not even the time to acknowledge her when she gripped his arms and pushed him back. "Draco," she whispered, "what are you doing to Harmony? She is even worse!"
The door slammed open, its frame enveloped by Snape. He stared at the two, at the broken glass bottles, at the girl looking like his hated enemy, in the arms of Draco Malfoy. "What is going on in here?" he asked in a low tone, darkness cast his eyes in black.
"After the Triwizard tournament, er...Dumbledore told me, but it's a secret."
"No, I went through the forest looking for wounded animals, and then brought them in. None of them were harmed by me." Harmony analyzed a mouse who looked damaged beyond repair. As if it had been squished by a careless bear romping through the forest.
"Sirius," Harmony pulled away a bit, wanting a better look at her God Father, "what are you doing here?" He was so excited, that if he was still a dog, he probably would be whining.
Considering that she wasn't cursed at, harassed, or neglected at all, it went well. "It went better than I ever thought it could." Professor McGonagall turned to face her with concern etched into her wrinkled face.
"You OK Ron?" Ginny asked.
"What? No." Harmony denied.
"Professor Snape," Leighton asked, "what do each of you think he would be?"
He slipped it between his fingers and waited a good minute before unfolding the parchment. It was foolish thinking to hope, and Draco didn't allow a smidgen to show. It read:
Was everything he had done all for nothing? Maybe he did have to lose everything to be with Potter. He put his hands through his immaculate hair and cursed aloud.
"If you think you can just—" pain seared her forehead, burning and tearing at her skull. The room spun around, white glowing and darkness mixing in with masked faces. Screams filled her ears, deafening and agonizing; the mad laughter of a killer joined with his victim's dying shrieks. Everything glowed a blood red, she was laughing hysterically, pain struck her skull, her stomach, her organs-like invisible hands were tearing her insides apart. Whose crazed delirium was this? Her eyes burned with anguish and anger seeking out the man whose fault this was. There. He groveled at her feet, but he needed to feel her torment. Crucio wasn't enough. She saw his rat like face, and hate consumed her. "What have you done to me?"
Severus bowed and dismissed himself. He only nodded at Lucius as he left. And he could only hope that he had done the right thing.
"I will master it, and thank you professor." She would not learn it out of fear, or to gain power. She didn't want to be messed with anymore.
"Well," she began when she noticed everyone's stares. A groaning noise escaped the door as she leaned on it. "I am glad to see that all of our students have survived the summer and had not died in horrible brutal fashions." Trelawny scratched her unkempt hair with a long slim finger. "Now I know that each of you had exciting dreams that you scribed into a journal for me to grade, which you all will hand in at the end of class. Hopefully they are all pleasant, with at least one nightmare, or hornet." She said as she swatted a bee away from her face, which flew and rested on a windowsill. Student's eyes began to dull, as brain cells were induced to self destruct.
Harmony wondered if it was safe to do so. She looked behind her, to check if people were there even though she knew that they were alone. She looked at the walls, and the only painting was one with a sleeping blue baby. She brought a hand to her face, allowing the magic to dissipate and reveal the real owner behind the guise of Harry Potter. She didn't want to see his expression, but their eyes connected and she was all too aware of the focus his gray eyes fixated her with. She hadn't even processed that she may be making a mistake by showing him. "That's…wow." She quickly changed back to her boy face and hoped that he wouldn't say anything demeaning. Concentration forward, she marched ahead. She could almost feel the smirk that was searing into the back of her head.
"The back of the house," Dobby said, "near the china room and trophy room." Draco lifted a corner of the cloak over his head, and Harmony almost pulled him back, but stopped as the others did the same.
"So you mean at Madam Puddifoots with Malfoy here, that wasn't you? It would make sense why he has been behaving so well."
"Nah, then I wouldn't be a mystery. Bye boys." She left them and walked out the entrance to be joined by Dudley and some very annoying cat calls from his gang.
"Have a seat, he is still at the Great Hall." Draco moved the chair out for her, with a sheen in his eyes. With a paused hesitance she carefully stepped towards him, never straying from his eye contact. Draco then realized his fatal mistake. As impossible as it would seem, he was too close to her. The scent of her hair made him involuntarily breathe in deeper. She smelled of jasmine. Though she was tenaciously staring ahead, that thought didn't process. His eyes traveled over her fair skin, from her full pink lips up to the curve of her snub nose. She wasn't wearing glasses, and his fingers twitched as he crossed her cheek bones towards the arch of her eyebrow. He then looked into her eyes, and her eyes moved towards him. She was alluring. His breath caught when he felt how much his body was betraying him at this moment. He tried to look casually away, but he cursed in his mind as he saw from the corner of his eye that she wore a small smile. No, he had to control his body. Draco closed his eyes tightly; she would be the death of him.
"Tonight, meet me outside of the Defense Against the Dark Arts Room. Be there alone by midnight, and don't worry, I won't punish you for wandering the halls past curfew." Draco Malfoy got up. "Damn, prefects duty," he mumbled. "Don't forget," he said as he went out of the door with a smirk set on his face, "our rendezvous."
Green eyes regarded him, annoyed behind the round glasses. "Whatever you say Zabini."
"Please," Harmony whispered, too soft for them to hear. She didn't care any more whether she hurt their feelings or not.
Harry Potter was not happy. This was not directly because she was forced to stay at the Dursleys. This wasn't even entirely because she had recently gone trough a weird sex change which was making her cramp with pains and grow unmentionables. She sat on her bed staring at the letter in her hands written by Professor McGonagall.
"But the professor isn't here yet, the bear isn't real." Harmony blasted a stunning spell over her shoulder. Which unfortunately didn't work.
"You can't be dead," she said, "no, Sirius, please wake up."
"You mean anymore than you already do." Ron and Harmony turned their heads to face George and Fred. "Oh is the little Ronnie Pooh scared of mean old Quidditch tryouts?"
"Of course there are a few things that I would rather keep to myself, but it's not so bad as I first thought it would be with you. It's helping too," she said. "Thanks."
Ginny coughed into her wrist. Draco then caught himself as saw that the others were watching them awkwardly. "Alright," Ginny said, "...So now we should head back."
"And I care what they think?" Harmony asked, but really stated. Draco shrugged his shoulders before changing their directions and continuing on. She needed a class where she could let lose her stress and put her small frame to work.
"Shite," she muttered and leaned her head on his arm, "shite. shite. I really don't want the prophet after me."
"Can we not talk about him," Harmony shook her head, "it's kind of disturbing to talk about guys."
"Well, I already know how to cook," Harmony said with her hands in her pockets.
"He took off his shirt," Harmony pointed at Madam Hooch who began to speak.
"Let's go that way," Harmony pointed where the Death Eaters had come from. They ran, dodging broken furniture. Harmony put out her hand, when she thought she heard something strange. It was a piercing laughter. With a finger to her mouth, they crept along the blackened wall toward the only slightly ajar room. Her caracal form leaped to the ground, and slunk through the door. She could see the outlines of robed figures, black against the drawn, shredded velvet of the curtains. Her ears perked, as something large enough to be a body thudded and clattered to the floor, as the Death Eaters continued to yell hexes.
"They made a ten year old cook their meals, priceless muggles are, so did those hideous beasts not let you eat if you didn't do what they said, or lock you in a little closet," he joked a bit.
"Your father is protecting her," Harmony said, "and if anything else happens, we'll go and save her." He didn't think that they could stand up to the Dark Lord, but he wanted to.
"Sorry," Hermione blurted out suddenly, "it's not like it's your fault, I'm upset."
Draco felt the sting before he saw the blow. The Defense Against the Dark Arts Room was dimly lit, and they were practicing dueling. Not the kind that he had performed in front of his school mates in his second year, but the one where there were no rules. He had thought that he would be a decent fighter, but in actuality, he was a good hider. Throughout the room there were constructed walls, and ledges; so that they could corner someone or use it as a shield. Draco stooped behind one now, listening intently to his surroundings. Occasionally he could hear the blast of a spell colliding against a wall and the debris of splinters thudding against the ground, but otherwise this was a game of ambush. Professor Kingscross, as Draco refused to call him HoneyDukes, wanted them to open up their natural senses. "Let your animal side take over," he had said, but Draco was finding such a thing to be increasingly challenging. The beast inside of him was dormant. When he thought of a gaping maw, like that of a shark, it didn't settle properly within him. When he thought of powerful forearms, of that of a gorilla, tuffs of coarse black fur did not sprout across his arms. Draco could not even utter a feral note of any sort. Surely there was something wrong with the professor's teaching method. He had gone through numerous animal kingdoms, gone through all of the venomous reptiles, the malicious beasts, exotic creatures, and magical fay, but none matched his power animal.
"Allow me." Harmony stood still as Draco stepped around her. She met his gaze and calm smile. He changed their course and she stared at his back. She reached for him, he was so close. Her body reacted, and with a sinking certainty that was in her heated face she knew that she was falling for Draco Malfoy. Shite. This was not supposed to happen.
"It's wrong of him," Hermione said, "we barley see you anymore. Has something happened?"
"Really Ron?" Harmony rolled her eyes, "that's ridiculous. Just because we're acting civil-"
"My apologies," Draco said "But can you tell me how Harmony is faring?"
"You're an obnoxious wanker, you know that right? And I could care less for whatever you have to say because I would die a thousand times over before I quiver like the chicken shite you are." Harmony looked away from him and stared out the window.
She stumbled back, sore and exhausted, and put a hand through her hair. They probably would expect her to parade in the dead body, to end all of the fighting. But all she felt was numbness. She peeled the elder wand from Voldemort's vice like grip and stuffed it in her pocket, knowing that she had to bring it back to Dumbledore. She moved slowly as she retrieved her firebolt from the tree, and didn't even look at the dead body before taking off, steadying her broom, and soaring over the forest. It didn't take her long till Hogwarts was in view, with the fighting almost over as the remainder of the Death Eaters either littered the grounds, took off, or fought with the conviction that their Lord would never fall. At the sight of the dead bodies her eyes closed, and she knew that war had entered the castle.
"No Potter, you're not even worthy to fight me." Voldemort kicked the dragon and it reared up, anger making tendrils of smoke seep through its snout. It lumbered her way, tearing out trees, all the while Voldemort watched with piercing red eyes. The dragon over came her easily, and soon the felled trees made a clearing. She had no wand, and Harmony knew that with one bite it would be over.
"Should have told us, I could have given you advise," Blaise lip read, "on what? How to snog without breathing for five minutes? Oh look, Potter looks mad." Harmony stood up from her seat and glared at Draco before rushing out of the Great Hall with the photo tucked into her bag. "You couldn't have done the dumping already."
"Let's go get tea." Draco ordered, and the group headed towards Madame Puddifoot's Tea Shop, where Draco made sure that he got a seat next to Harmony.
Harmony could tell that Sirius was barely conscious. Blood dotted the floor, and his breathing was labored. With each second Sirius's face sheened with blood and sweat. Harmony was powerless to do anything. Move damnit. But her body failed to respond. Sirius was dying before her eyes, and she could only stand there. She looked at Draco again who was motionless as well.
The Dursleys had not been pleased when she had shown up a month early, announcing that she had no plans to return to school. It wouldn't have mattered to them if she had defeated twenty Dark Wizards. It turns out that the level of tolerance that they could show her for a day, didn't hold for long as the weeks went on. Especially when the Durselys were faced with the prospect that Harmony might remain indefinitely, with no foreseeable way of getting rid of her.
They went through stairwells and hanging portraits that stared at them as they walked. She heard a low pounding of beats, a rhythm coming from two steal doors. She concentrated on the quickening notes, she couldn't identify the melody, but it was soft and whimsical. She closed her eyes and smiled. "I did not know they offered music," she whispered, as to not to disturb the crescendo of trumpets and flutes that fluttered like butterflies to her ears.
The dirt was frozen under her fingers, and chunks of it shot into the sky as Harmony ran. Her lithe body dogged trees, and leapt over jutting rocks. Her eyes were almost completely dilated, looking like two hollow spots. She was low to the ground, crouched behind a fern bush. The Forbidden Forest held all sorts of magical fey, and Harmony let out her own mists of breath. She wanted to become part of the forest, the caracal part of her was taking over.
"As far as I'm concerned Harry Potter is dead. I came up with a plan. I'm going to move to London and live my life as a muggle and..." Harmony became distracted from recounting her brilliant plan as Draco stepped close. His fingers caressed her cheek as he stared at her red cupid lips.
"What? Why him?"
She wanted to hold his hand and slap her face at the same time. To touch him and push him away. She covered her eyes with her hands. This could not be.
"It is very nice of you all to take my class this year. It pleases me to see such interest in young minds for Divinations." Harmony glared at the ball, wondering what was worse, setting herself on fire or sitting through a years worth of Divinations. "At your seats there is an orb to practice your eye's ability to see, look into it now and the Sight will come to you." Students gazed into the glass, attempting to see something in vain as Trelawny perched at her desk.
"Harry," he mumbled, "that's too much."
"I thought of a nick name for you," Draco said softly as his patronus began to dissipate. He turned to her and put down his wand. "it's sly." He stood in front of her, and didn't even care that she looked like a boy.
Harry glanced up at him and muttered what Draco assumed to be an apology and continued on. To Draco, Harry appeared waxy and almost in pain, but he could honestly care less. In fact, Draco grinned as he thought that Potter deserved it. What, with how everyone practically worshiped Pott, and how he didn't have to do anything to gain his fame, well except for surviving a lethal curse. The whole Gryffindor righteousness and Potter's disgustingly high and mighty hero complex was- well, disgusting.
Harmony began to slow her pace and actually figure out where she was going. She looked at the moving figures on the wall and could swear that she had seen them before. Her mind actively retraced her steps, leading from the Divinations. She looked out from a hallway window and saw mountains. She rested her forehead on the warm pane of glass in order to see the castle grounds below. She hadn't even realized that her scar prickled with heat, as it burned alongside her mind.
"Leighton wouldn't," Harmony said, "unless we bribe him with honey dukes candy, he probably ate all of the ones I'd gotten him for Christmas."
"Headmistress McGonagall? That's- wow," Harmony closed her eyes feeling as the exhaustion leaded her down, she watched him for as long as she could, till her eyes pulled shut.
"She grew up hating her father, till she met Potter. Potter told her it was some other scumbag who betrayed his parents, not Black. He knew because Sirius Black is Harry Potter's god father. Then they became friends."
"That's hard to believe."
"I'd bury it," Draco muttered, "Unless Consenesco, Medimento, Fascius, and Ferula could work."
"Still, I don't want to risk our lives in such a silly way."
"He died a fool, groveling for the lives of worthless children. Will you do the same Potter?" Voldemort laughed with her head bent back and smoke streamed from the nostrils of the dragon. "There is no one to protect you here, Potter, you will be mine to destroy."
"It's OK, Snape uses a sledge hammer compared to you." Harmony gave a small laugh, but Draco doubted that she was joking.
"Oh, my glasses got a bit scratched up when I woke up, so I can manage." He desperately hoped that Hermione would not offer to fix them.
Leighton's girlfriend:
"I can't go back as Harry." Harmony whispered.
"Keep hanging with me, and you'll soon lose your prefects badge." She said as the students passed. They walked side by side through the halls.
"They can't do anything to me," Draco said, "the worst that will happen is that they will figure out what I care about the most and try to destroy it. So in reality, they will hurt you more, knowing that it will give them the satisfaction of hurting both of us."
"It's nothing important. Rest well." Ginny threw a light shoulder punch at Harmony before the two exited the common room.
The door shot open and Ron slid on to the seat across from Harmony with Hermione. Harmony brushed her head against the glass, the room was getting much too stuffy for some reason.
"That's none of your concern, but I am here for another reason." His father looked down at him as they conversed, watching Draco for anything. Draco did the same.
Harmony huffed out a storm by the time that she made it to the castle and her head spun from the cold. "Beat you," Draco said in a similar state against the wall.
"Then why befriend me?" Though she would never admit to it, she wanted to know.
"We should get back," Harmony said, "before they notice."
"Just dandy," Draco said in a flat tone.
"If you hadn't followed me, then he would still be alive." It's his fault.
"A great horned owl," Luna added.
"Oh Merlin," Hermione chocked out. Harmony looked at Hermione's troubled face before the Daily Prophet was passed before her. It read, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has Returned, and in smaller print, seen breaking into the Ministry of Magic. The news spread and fear along with it. Harmony gave back the paper for Hermione to read, and she realized that students were looking to her. Harmony's eyes searched for Dumbledore, but many of the staff including said Headmaster were absent. She had no idea what Voldemort had been planing, what he could want at the Ministry of Magic. She looked to the Slytherin table and saw that many of the Slytherins had mixed reactions. A good majority were in fear, some had tiny little smirks, and only one looked troubled. Draco Malfoy sat separated from his usual friends, whether from choice or from them ostracizing him, she did not know. He was reading his paper, but his brow was nit, and he was biting his bottom lip. "Harry."
Harmony and McGonagall fell into a routine of morning classes where they would go over proper lady like decorum in formal and informal situations. She was just glad that they weren't going over the biology of females or something. After, she would be allowed free time and was able to go outside. She brought along her wand in case and usually went to a café to do summer assignments. It had been two and a half weeks since arriving and she had only gotten vague letters from both Ron and Hermione mostly which read that they were well and of course wished that she was there and not with her dreadful relatives.
"So how do you guys normally have it locked?" The room that Proffesor McGonagall had given to her only opened when she turned the knob in a certain way. They were mostly the same.
Immediately his arms went slack and she pushed away from him. He was still in his robes and she saw his placid expression. She could imagine the scene they were making, all glued together and she began to fight her brain for excuses. Nothing was all she could come up with. It was the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.
He wasn't expecting any of this. He didn't normally notice girls. There were always so many other things to explore, places to travel. He could hardly remember the last girl he had bothered to kiss, and that was back at Hogwarts.
Draco waited in the girl's bathroom for Harmony, Luna, and Ginny, and failed ignoring the ghost who was touching him. He would have hexed the moaning girl if he could, but no matter how many threats and glares he shot at her, she was determined to be a wart. He didn't think that he had lost his menacing side, but the girl just floated around his head unfazed.
A small fear settled in him, that he would lose her. And the fact that he had that small fear was more frightening to him. What was happening to him? It was Bloody Potter. He couldn't just forget that. Why should he care to see her with other guys? It was idiotic. Incredulous. He was only annoyed because he had a mission and couldn't afford others to steal her away. But as he witnessed that someone had managed to sneak her to the dance floor, he was livid. It was a cold fury that made him step closer. No one had the right to touch her. He was nearly ready to pounce between the two, but stopped as he recognized the man. It was Professor Kingscross, masquerading as a student. And Draco backed off. He detested the other man's well built form, his height, his overwhelming power. And even Draco could admit that he was dishy. But what made him frustrated was that Harmony looked comfortable and delighted to be with him. They looked good together, like a couple.
"Well if you two have been trying a year, then it's obvious nothings going to happen," Charlie retorted, annoyed at the jab about the old man.
"Wah...Ginny," Hermione muttered, "Harry, it's not like that. Honestly." Hermione continued when Harmony failed to respond, "We just wanted to know, so that we could help." Harmony felt a migraine forming. "Harry, I'm so sorry about Sirius."
"Disappeared," Hermione said in a strained voice, "died maybe..." Harmony put the kettle on the stove, and then turned around to look at Hermione again. Her eyes were looking off into the distance as she attempted to blink back tears.
"Well of course you do, I am something like a big deal around here." Wow, Dudley's conceited parade could almost match Draco Malfoy's. Well Harry might as well have some fun.
She needed to change back soon, and not be caught inside Hogwarts. She figured that if everyone was outside, then she could find somewhere that no one was. The stair well had to do, and Harmony put on her glasses and stuffed her hat and mittens away before her face was male again. She went to the common rooms and hid Luna's gifts in her suitcase and draped her winter cloak on her bed. All she had to do now was wait for the Gryffindors to come back. She didn't want anyone to suspect her. She sat by the fire as the first students came in.
They spent the next few days working on different routines and styles of dance. Sometimes Snape would watch and berate Sirius for dancing like an inept monkey. She didn't mind so much being the girl in the dances, and being lead around in circles. It had been much the same as dancing at the Yule ball at any rate.
Blaise smiled. He finally had a worthy cause to focus his attention on.
"How long was the potion to last?" Harry asked, not sure if he wanted to know the answer.
"Kids have chores all the time, I just happened to cook and stuff."
It was close to the end of the year, so few professors had assigned last minute essays. He had one Defense Against the Dark Arts assignment, involving magical sprouting creatures, that he much rather put off. Setting his wand to wake him up later, he closed his eyes for a nap.
Draco leaned against the banister in a bored manner, and he turned his head when he heard the clicks from her high heels. She didn't meet his eyes as she pressed down at her dress, and felt as if her insides had flipped. "Hey," she said, "sorry I'm late, I couldn't leave my room, till everyone was gone," she rambled as she stood in front of him. Harmony wished that she had worn something over her bare arms and legs as the cool air permeated through the walls. He held out his arm and Harmony took it with a warm feeling dissipating the cold.
"So can I stay for another day?" Uncle Vernon reluctantly nodded his head.
"Very good," Snape said and Harmony's mouth dropped.
Harmony stretched her body, knowing that she had Magical Fitness class soon. They were going rock climbing today and had the wall transfigured into a cliff side. At least it was something that she could take her mind off of Draco.
"Detention!"
"I think she's waking up," Luna said and brushed away the girl's bangs. Harmony's eyes fluttered open and she sat up.
"I'm not your little house elf to order around," Harmony expressed with annoyance while dropping her bag to the floor. He gave a little snort.
She saw the surprise before a second later his arms wrapped around her. It amazed her how the tightening in her chest made her ease into his hug. It made her breath go faint, as her mind was preoccupied with his touch. He held her close, and all too soon he let go. "I'll take that as a yes then," she laughed and had to stop herself from hugging him next.
"Harmony!" she heard him shout, "wait." She didn't stop. She did not even allow herself to look back. Harmony picked up her pace.
"Albus Dumbledore, from the front door of course," the elderly man said with an aloof smile.
"If you hadn't followed me, then he would still be alive."
"At the count of three then. One. Two. Three." The two girls grabbed the rusty watering can at the same time. Ginny felt the jerk under her navel, which always made her think that she had been caught by a fishing pole and yanked far away, with the world spinning around her.
Harmony crumpled the paper in her hands and gave it back to Hermione. "Of course they would blame Sirius," Harmony muttered angrily, "when it was the Ministry's damn fault."
"What the, Malfoy get your hands off me." He spun her so fast Harmony fell against his chest. Her eyes traveled to what should have been his face, but she saw nothing. She didn't need to. "Let go," she lowered her voice, her arms were trapped.
"When I was just a bun fresh from the oven, an evil dark lord put a curse on me that turned me into a boy. Only love could break it, so I must thank you Dud, for saving me from my wretched life." Dudley sputtered like a chicken caught in the cuckoo's nest.
"You're good Potter, but you can't hide from me." Draco whispered and chuckled a bit. He hastily brought the curtain in place when he heard footsteps and dragged his legs to his bed. The door clicked open and two figures passed him.
All around the room were traps, pits to fall into, collapsing walls, oiled floors, and blinding lights; many of which Draco had set up. He kept a sharp eye for the others, while still managing to be concealed. There. To his left he could see the silhouette of a girl tip toeing away from him. Draco acted at once, slinking her way. Each step he took was sure footed and light, like that of a small animal scampering across a room. It wasn't until he was nearly five feet away that he stopped and melted with the black wall, it was a good thing for him too, as the girl came to a halt and looked back over her shoulder. They stayed motionless, she straining her eyes into darkness, and him staring at her. When she thought it clear she moved, and he followed behind her like a shadow, nearly touching her. Draco latched his hand to the back of her shoulder, bringing his wand to her throat. "Got you," he said with uncontrollable glee. The girl's head twisted painfully to the right, as far from the wand pointed to her neck. Draco smelled jasmine, it thrilled him. 'You are mine,' was at the tip of his tongue.
"Harry is also Lily's child, but I have done them all wrong." The room fell to a heavy silence. Okay, so Draco knew that Dumbledore was senile already, or at least suffering some mental disability, but if they both thought Harry was a girl, then something definitely was up.
"But why would someone do that?" Ginny asked him with the locket shaking in her hands as if it could lash out and kill.
"Harry," Ron said in all serious tones, "did you just say that you are going to Magical Fitness? The class filled with raging girls?" Harmony nodded her head. "You lucky bugger," Ron grinned, "but what will I do without you in Divinations? It will be so boring."
"Bloody Malfoy that is, I heard some of the first years talking about him in the great hall during breakfast. Makes me wonder why the girls go raving mad after him. Slytherin Ponce or Prat fits him like a leather glove. Ugh. Speak of the devil." Draco strut in the classroom, the image of immaculate perfection, well externally at least. Still with her head down Harmony caught herself following him with her eyes, but not before he noticed and winked at her. She closed her eyes tightly, not wanting to think of the previous night.
Something grabbed her, but she continued to fall through the darkness. She couldn't see anything, only herself.
There was something about the girl, that he couldn't quite put his finger on. He waited until Draco and Harmony left down one of the passageways to drop his act. He didn't even care if the pair of them could still hear him or not.
"Yes?" Draco asked, standing awkwardly before the seated man.
Harmony stuck out her hand and Draco lifted the locket from under his shirt. It was warm when it touched her skin, and Harmony slipped it over her head. "Better?"
"A model?" Draco asked.
"He surprised me too. Took him half a year to convince me that I could trust him." Harmony admitted. It felt good to confide in Hermione again. Like the old times. She wondered if it would be alright to tell Hermione, if some things could go back to the way they were, before the end of fourth year when everything changed.
"Nonsense," Kingscross called out, "The impact won't kill you, the pressure of falling will." They continued to scream. Draco had his eyes closed, but he opened them to see how far was left to his life. And Draco knew that Kingscross had somehow done the whole, missing the cliff by a few feet on purpose. But thankfully they weren't going any faster, and no they had not reached terminal velocity either. They were slowing down. Draco saw in front of him the portkey seashell, and it took all of his will power not to reach out and save himself. It went against all of his sense of reason, and he had to turn away from the temptation. After a few more miles, they came to a slow decent.
"He'd kill you if he found out," Draco said.
"It's only 3," Ginny said, "it's barely a lift." She passed her the high heels, and Harmony tried them on. "What size are you?" she asked.
"No, now is the best time, and no one will be allowed in."
"You look a bit different Harry." Ron piped out. Harry's eye almost twitched, but he forced a smile.
"Do not be so liberal with your words, Draco. Do you want to harm your family even more?" Draco looked anywhere but at his Professor who sat hunched on his desk like a vulture.
"We already know how to destroy it, right Ginny." Ginny leaned closer to the girl and held Harmony's hand.
"Give me your hands," he commanded as he put the dough into her palms. His own hands wrapped around hers as he pressed gently, squeezing them together. "You need to apply pressure so that there are no air bubbles," he explained. They were facing each other, with the cauldron between them. He looked into her green eyes before abruptly withdrawing his hands. The dough fell into the pot, and sizzled, making the potion turn an inky indigo blue. luckily the hue was close enough to the drawing in the book. He sighed in relief. She looked at him with curiosity.
"How do-?"
One thing she liked was roaming the shops on Diagon Alley, looking in the Quidditch shop, gift shop, and book stores. It was a nice change not having people point at her while walking and whispering madly to each other, like they were nibbling ears. She could not ignore the daily prophet so well though. She still made the front page, minus the dress and girly looks. The worst was seeing the Wizarding World's reaction to the Daily Prophet's slander. Most of them sneered at seeing her boy face in the paper. They were all so fickle, believing her to be a savior and then discarding her when she brought bad news.
He had been on her mind, more than she had cared to admit, and now he was here. In order to escape, quietly, she had to get Draco Malfoy out of here fast, before the muggles found him, or before he found the muggles. Neither of them felt particularly motivated to get going. At least not at first. The longer his lips were on hers, the more Harmony remembered how much she liked them there. His hands ran through her hair, as they kissed, trailing lightly down. When he held her tightly, pressing against her back, she couldn't hide a small hiss of pain.
Ginny passed the slip of paper over to Harmony to share the message. Harmony's eyes flicked over the parchment reading it quickly before passing it back.
"I am afraid that there is bad news," Dumbledore stated, "Voldemort has returned." Students gasped at his name, and they reacted in a similar manner as they had when she was a first year and Professor Quirrell had come in with the knowledge that a troll had been let loose in the school. "Hogwarts will continue through this year, and will remain safe for students. Classes will be canceled for the day, in order for students to contact family, and make appropriate arrangements. That is all." Dumbledore then sat down to eat, and students began to leave in packs.
In her excitement she had stood up and caught herself smiling. She was the only Gryffindor up, and realized the attention that she was drawing to herself. Others looked at her solemnly, as if she was some kind of traitor. "I should go," Harmony said, and waved at Ginny and Luna. They did think that she was his girlfriend and Harmony grinned as Ron shot her a glare. It didn't matter to her what they thought. She could cheer Draco's name if she wanted. They weren't really her friends anyway. Ron was a sorry git, and he could piss off if he wanted to. She left the stands and didn't stay to watch Draco circling the stadium with the snitch in his hand.
"Potter is perfectly miserable," Snape said, "what do you expect, Draco?"
"How do I look?" he asked her, pawing at his bangs.
"And of what grave importance is this, that I cannot even have a second to myself since arriving?" Snape muttered while picking at his black cloak.
"You're lying." the purple left him, replaced with a sheen of waxy white.
"Don't be a bother, for once in your life, Ron." Ginny said, "Let Harry rest."
"Why does Professor Snape give you all of those detentions?" Draco asked Harmony when she walked out the door.
"It's a very simple one," Ron said, "marrying the girl I love." Some of the Slytherins began to snicker, but Ron beamed past that staring at a blushing Hermione. Draco wanted to gag, and hex the stupid git.
"Shite," he choked out "You damn well owe me now."
"How is school? Are you getting into trouble?"
"That's right, you don't have Granger or Weasley behind you." Which was true, Ron and Hermionone would much rather busy themselves by seeing how long they could humanly snog for, than have conversations which tended to turn awkward with her. "Which is a good thing that you have me." Draco's hands slipped to hers, "I'll come with you to Professor Snape, and I will figure out anything that I can from my father." Harmony lightly held on to Draco by his finger tips. That simple contact made her arms tingle. "But on one condition, Harmony."
"A what, dear?"
Her reaction was perfect. She was a great actor. But there was more than that. There was a fire to her words, a confidence that Blaise found absolutely intriguing. He followed her.
The sky was a sheet of white and brightened the entire area. When Harmony stepped outside, she pulled her scarf close to her neck and trekked through the cleared path. She got to the Gryffindor section and spotted Ginny with Luna.
"Gah! It's gotten into my eyes," Draco squeaked, while rubbing his eyelids.
The moment that the dungeon lights extinguished, Draco knew that Professor Snape had returned. Outside Snape's office, Draco rapped swiftly on the frame and entered. "Professor," he said, "may I have a word?" It didn't mater that Snape still wore his traveling cloak, or that the man was overdue on his lunch.
"I think we need to do something fun," Ginny said, "outside." Ginny shut her book, and put a hand on Harmony's, stopping her from taking out a Charms assignment. "We've been cooped in here so long, that we're going crazy."
Harmony had the mind to stop them, to send Draco away, but something inside of her couldn't. She saw passed his reflection and watched the whiteness blur. She did nothing as he sat across from her. "Harmony," he said, "look at me."
"Exactly why were we holding meat in front of a bunch of hungry crazed hyenas?" Draco said in a voice of poorly concealed anger. "Were we to hold signs up as well, with the words 'eat me'?"
"Yes," she said, "I can see that. But why are you here now?" Harmony walked closer and dropped her book bag to the floor. She crossed her arms over her chest and glared at Draco as he began to fold his shirt. She couldn't help but look, and who wouldn't? He had a lithe and well toned body that wasn't grossly muscular. It was a stomach that she could slowly trace abs and muscles, as she followed her way down to the edge of what must have been his boxers. She trailed her eyes up, passed the snake of his locket.
"Is this becoming a club or something?" Leighton asked and stretched his right arm where there was a light scratch.
"I can see that you are busy," Draco said with a bored glance around the three girls, his gaze then fell on Leighton and his eyes blinked twice as he noticed Leighton's appearance. It was like a dark shadow engulfed Draco, in cold loathing. A slight sneer spread across his features. "This is unbelievable, you. I've seen you before. Merlin, it's a good thing I came, so I could report this."
"Very well," Snape said, "and if I witness another poorly constructed fight in my class, I will give you two a real detention. Leave." Draco gave a curt nod and thanked Snape before leaving the man.
Upon entering the class, Ron and Harmony only saw one last empty table waiting to be claimed, unfortunately it was the one right in front of the teachers desk. A look of misgiving passed through both of their faces. She then felt the Slytherin glares and wondered when the taunting would start. Tension hung on tight muscles. Many of the green and silver marked teens looked back at Draco Malfoy to take the lead. He looked bored and uninterested at his books.
"Really? Where?" Harmony followed him to the back of the room where there were stalls to wash. "Huh, when did these get here?" There was a flimsy moth ridden curtain that had to do, and Harmony thanked him. She retrieved her school robes and Draco handed her his towel.
It looked as if Ron was about to disagree with that, but a goofy smile overcame his lips. "It's true that I haven't gone on a date with her for some time," and Harmony could tell that some part of him did not want to ditch her, though the bigger and more demanding other part was urging him closer to Hermione.
"Yes of course Sir." Draco stood, but before he stepped away, he could make out the bags under the man's eyes and just how hollow the man appeared. "Thank you," Draco said and left, realizing that Snape had just risked it all by telling him the truth.
"Destroyed?" Harmony wondered, "why destroy it?"
"I have to go," she said, and she broke away. With one last look she fled for the door and threw the cloak around her.
"You're," Uncle Vernon sputtered out, "you're not allowed to do magic out of that, that school of yours."
He took a quick step back, to gather himself and check to see that everything about him was dishy and enticing. It was. Without a second thought, Draco slid open the door, and meet the green behind the spectacles. The intrusion set off an uncomfortably silence as Harmony's friends gaped at him.
"And he cannot buy it himself?"
"You better be right," she said and stepped through the room. The smile that Draco detested was gone from Leighton, and Harmony stuffed her hands in her robe pockets.
"Why can't you ask me properly?" She began to chop erratically, mixing things that were supposed to be separated.
"Alright, then lead the way," she said.
"I have enough people misunderstanding me," Harmony began, "there is nothing going on between me and Leighton." She put up a hand when it looked like he was going to interject at that. "I am taking these lessons to prepare for war." To her relief he did not say anything snide, instead he nodded his head with a calculating face.
"This wound is a bit worse, who knows which spell for this?" Leighton called on Luna.
"The Dark Lord severed his soul, and placed the pieces into different objects. It could be in anything, in a locket, in a diary, or even a tiara." Draco regarded the misery in those green eyes, and felt an ache inside. "My father was ordered to retrieve a tiara in Hogwarts and wanted to bring me back. I'm sorry that you lost your family," Draco finished, and Harmony looked down at her hands.
"I can't believe him, did he change in front of you?"
"I'm feeling great actually. That ended a lot better than I thought it would." She replied.
Harmony fiddled with her tea cup, taking another long sip. If anyone deserved to know the truth, it was Hermione. Even if she could only tell her parts of the truth.
Harmony lifted a hand away from her forehead laden with cold sweat. "I haven't done anything to you, I swear," said a different voice, one filled with concern. Where was she? Gray filled her eyes, she concentrated on that.
"Do you think that it was Voldemort?" Harmony asked and Leighton lifted an eyebrow.
"He'd profusely vomit if I did that, besides it's important that I meet up with him."
"What the fuck are you talking about?" Harry asked, and walked away.
Never tickle a sleeping dragon. Her answers had only added to his first spark of interest. She knew almost too much about dragons.
"I hate Valentine's day." Harmony said, "what? Are you two going?" Ginny grinned at them.
"I have some grave news," Snape said, "from your family. This is a letter which your Father has written. I can only guess the contents, but here it is." Snape handed him a folded up letter that did not have the usual Malfoy seal or wax stamp. It crinkled as Draco slipped a finger and opened it.
"Yeah, then you'll be all alone in 6th year." Draco brushed the hair from his eyes, and smiled from the corner of his lips.
"Draco!" Harmony growled. She transformed back into a girl. "So that ferret is yours," she said looking around for it. Draco looked awkwardly back at her.
He let go of her arms and cast that hand to her waist. She could reject him again. She would have done that easily too three months ago. She could have laughed at him and punched his sorry arse.
"Surprised?" he asked, showing a row of teeth.
"Hey," she said. "You think I'm a child huh, that I can't take care of my self, that I need people to rescue me, and shelter me from the evils of the world! What's WRONG with everyone, I'M NOT A WEAK LITTLE BOY!" She yelled the last part without thinking and huffed for breath while Leighton lifted his eyebrows in surprise.
"Think Draco would scare anyone as a ferret?" Ginny asked.
"Holy hell bent mother, she's possessed!" Ron covered his ears and eyes, fearing to be the next victim.
He packed everything from his room into his trunk and prepared for the train ride back. To his relief, the spots had disappeared, and he felt as good as new. Better even, with the prospect of tormenting Potty. He happily got on the Hogwarts express and with his gang went to an empty apartment. He had seen Potter briefly, but it discouraged him that he still looked the same. Draco felt certain that it was not a dream he had; it couldn't have been. Leaving his Slytherin pals, and Pansy's cries of distress, he went Potter hunting.
"I already know how to do that."
The Tube:
She was close enough that she could hear the animal scurrying, and Harmony dropped to the ground. Her muscles were taught as she pin pointed the location of the creature. She shot through the underbrush and her paws were outstretched ready to take down the white haze that was only now about to run.
"It's not your fault, Weasley just needs to grow up." Draco smiled at her. "It's too bad the weasel doesn't have an ounce of tact in his whole body."
"Thanks guys." Hermione let go of him and they continued to stare at him.
Even though she couldn't see him, she knew that he was smiling. And then light slapped her eyes shut.
"But is that even a man?" Ginny asked quickly with her wand poised in the air as the dragon swooped back their way. The figure on the dragon had blond and brown streaks in her hair, with a melange of facial features from multiple women. Harmony's stomach seized as she wondered how many hearts Voldemort had devoured to look like that.
"I thinks it's me who should be thanking you," Draco said. They stopped in front of the Great Hall, and Draco touched her jet black hair. He could almost read everything in her green eyes, and as if she noticed, she closed them. He smiled down at her, and he let his hand drop to his side and stray to her own hands. She didn't pull away as they had been practicing all night. She looked down at the hands that were holding hers. "Good night," he said, and let her go.
"The loo," Harmony replied while giving a coerced half grin. Of course she couldn't say exactly why she had been in there, not for the reason that it was inappropriate dinner conversation but because she was in there for her period. It had been an unwelcome surprise three days back when she found the blood once again. She couldn't believe that girls had this every month, it was the worst punishment she could think of. She had cramps now and the onset of a headache was beginning to form at the top of her head. It was almost intolerable. "What was the song about this time?"
Harmony sat on the stone steps leading to the Dursley's door impatiently waiting for Professor McGonagall. She was beginning to perspire under the large boy clothes that she wore. Hedwig comforted her from her cage on top of a worn out trunk. She gave a slight sigh as she could almost feel the eyes from the living room window too scared to do anything but separate themselves with a thin sheet of glass, and stepping clear from any thing that resembled 'freaky' or a chimney. It was almost ridiculous that she had to wait outside.
"Who are you?" Voldemort asked.
The two shot hexes at one another, and seemed almost evenly matched, until the Dark Lord shot a green light at one of the Hufflepuff students, and Draco knew that he had shot to kill. The wand was pointed next at his face. Draco froze, as all the blood drain out of him. He had never had to think about his own death before.
"I can't," she said at last in a bit of frustration. It was difficult to do, to use her mind like that.
"Start over what? Over four years of absolute dislike. What do you think?" She trailed her fingers against the walls as she walked and turned her head away from him.
"How long will these partners last?" Goyle asked with a raised hand.
"I don't get it? Why? He's an arsehole! He he's-"
"Stop it." She shot at him, struggling to get away. How did he get so strong? She wanted to howl with frustration. When did she get so weak? He held her tighter. "Ugg," she stopped moving, figuring that the faster she got this done the better. "You probably won't tell me how you found out that I am a girl, so tell me what you want and then leave me alone."
"Yeah, I almost cried in boredom when she started ranting about the gnomes in her garden," Ron managed from his vapid expression.
Heat condensed visibly in the room, swirling and suffocating. "Sit down now," a high pitched voice pinched from a taught mouth. Harmony and Ron jumped to an empty table, and many of the other students joined in on the game of musical chairs, wanting to sit with their friends. On each table a glass orb sat, waiting for an owner to gaze into its depths. Students stared at their professor, foreseeing listless days in her class.
"Because I need someone there who knows what's right," Draco said earnestly, "so that I don't give in to what the Dark Lord says."
"Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus." Harmony replied, quoting the motto of Hogwarts. "Dragons are beautiful, free, and people don't mess with them. That's why."
Harmony noticed with the usual low whispering there were high pitched squeals and giggling throughout the room. She also saw some people pointing towards the staff table, and then she knew why. A new face had joined the Hogwarts staff, a face with a charming smile. He had umber brown hair and from where she sat, she could see his honey colored irises and tan skin. He looked to be in his late twenties and also thankfully did not look like Lockheart's lost twin. She could agree with the girls that he was indeed striking.
The dragon roared in frustration, and Harmony heard the angry hisses coming from Voldemort. She vaguely wondered why she couldn't understand the hissy fit, when a killing curse hit the tree in front of her. She didn't see the bark turn black as she swept passed it, going deeper through the expanse of forest. "Face me Potter! I want to watch your head burned off!" A burst of flames hit her robes and Harmony felt the itching pain before her clothes alighted. Shite. Shite. Shite. As if she could stop, drop and roll in the air. The heat became unbearable, and Harmony was losing control of her broom. With a wand pointed over her shoulder, she felt the relief of water drenching her charred clothes. When she looked back, her firebolt was steaming with smoke and Harmony had no time to react as the tip of the dragon's tail slugged her into a tree. She dropped like a stone.
"So that's why you left the dance floor," Harmony interjected, "and did you figure anything out?"
Harmony rested her head against the cool glass of the train, failing to blot out the other occupants in the compartment. Her eyes appeared dark from another sleepless night, and she rubbed them from under her glasses. Going back to Hogwarts had not lightened her spirit. She wished that Ron and Hermione could keep their hands to themselves when they thought that no one was looking. It irked enough that she couldn't muster any warmth for them.
He didn't love Harmony. No, he didn't really know what love was. But he needed her. It was worse than terrible, but he cared for her, enough that it didn't bother him that she was Harry Potter. He laughed at himself. What was he becoming? He used to be so bad arse. She had changed him.
"Ew Big D, you were hitting on your freak of a cousin."
"Don't you have somewhere to go or someone else to bother." Potter looked annoyed, and Draco had to suppress a laugh at what Potter was going through. Turning into a girl! Priceless.
"Nah," Harmony said, "it's spiked."
Harmony shuddered, Goosebumps coursed through the skin on her arms. "What?" she gasped, as other students shot from their slumber to look on at Trelawny.
"Harmony, you almost done in there?" McGonagall called from the hall leading to her room. Harmony washed her face once more and stepped out of the bathroom.
"It's secret, but Dobby, this is important. I need you to apparate us to the Malfoy Manor." Dobby looked anything but enthused. His ears flopped against his head as he repeated to himself how unsafe it was. "We want to save the students and Draco's mum." Harmony didn't know how Narcissa treated Dobby, but the way that the elf had no reaction, hinted at it.
"Damn you," Draco said through clenched teeth. This was their professor's entire fault. The animals continued to cry out, and the low hissing hummed through the tall grass.
He lifted the sledge hammer way into the air before bringing it down again in a crack of splinters. "Oh, and if I see any of you using what I teach against each other when not in class, I will personally make you regret it." He wrenched the large hammer out of the demolished desk with the ease of an expert. "We won't be needing desks in my class." There was a stunned silence where they half expected their new teacher to start hurtling weapons at them. They also soon saw that all throughout the walls were covered with all sorts of blades, spheres, cross bows, knives, rods, hooks, needles, axes, hammers, and some weaponry from muggle wars. The unfortunate students at the front saw, from within the darkness of his closet, the silhouette of some kind of unmistakable torture devise.
"I don't even know why, just thanks."
The rest of the holiday Draco spent at Hogwarts was alone and terribly boring. He had never suffered his own company before, and it was the first time that he even questioned what it meant to be a Malfoy. All the years that he had been so proud. He didn't feel any better than everybody, in fact he felt dreadful. He had hurt Harmony. She hadn't even looked at him when she boarded the train.
"Yeah, juggling between three people. Two professors and one student, unless there's another guy I don't know about…Dumbledore..no, I don't think he's into little girls."
"When I got my message this morning, you addressed me as cub…can I be called something a bit more normal?"
"It's not me," Draco countered, "something's changed with her." Ginny looked at him closely and stepped away.
Harry started changing by pulling on a pair of pants that thankfully still fit her, though not for long she had to remind herself. She chose to stay with boxers and ignored the pink panties that she didn't even want to think how Dumbledore acquired such undergarments. There was no bra, but cloth for binding her flat chest down. After she got her shirt and tie on, she thanked Madam Pomfrey and left for the Great Hall.
"What are we to do now?" he asked her, "we aren't heading to the roof anymore." She felt like doing something crazy, and if she wasn't going to do something, she might just press into him in a bear hug.
"No, and I want to keep it that way."
"You look like Harry as well," Remus took a few steps closer and squinted in the dark. "Sorry, it's just that I have been searching for him for awhile now..."
"I thought we were going out to buy those things," and why did it matter so much what was on her feet. McGonagall ordered her to take off the sneakers and then transfigured them into brown flats with yellow and green flowers. Harmony was tempted to vomit right there, could it get any worse?
"Yeah," Harmony rubbed her eyes from under her glasses, "Hermione has the sense to teach him. I'm gonna see if any one else needs help," she said.
And then the plunge began. This was not like flying on a broom, zooming with a portkey, or teleporting by flu powder. This was a lot like falling to death. And at that exact moment, Draco knew that wings would not sprout from his shoulder blades. A chorus of screams filled his ears and his own vocal cords uttered his own cries. Manly cries of distress. "We are going to die!" Someone screeched. Though they had been falling for only seconds, the surface already crouched to spring on them. "The ground is right there, it's going to kill us!"
"What did you expect; an umbrella?" She laughed as if it was some kind of shared joke. Harmony frowned a little which made McGonagall in turn frown. "You have heard of Mary Poppins, right?"
Harmony folded her arms across her chest. "Well I was going to thank you, but considering I'm suffering from massive head trauma, I seem to have forgotten why."
"Maybe it's better if it isn't cancelled. The students need something to take the war out of their heads," Ginny said as Harmony once again lifted her head and watched the other tables with students chattering all at once.
"But you have to call me Honey Dukes then," Draco had to stop himself from gaping at the man, but something else happened even more expectantly. Harmony was smiling and soon Draco was chuckling too.
"Harry…" Suddenly the fear in those four pairs of eyes was too much for her.
Harmony slinked behind the stores on the narrow back alley streets heading in the general direction of her flat. there was not a single wizard out as she made her way and it was all silent, save for the pounding of her heart and the taps of her footsteps. The sky overhead began to darken to a stormy black gray, and she hoped that it was a wizard shower or something, and nothing more.
"Well what did he say?" Was Hermione always this nosy?
She steadied her broom, glaring at the Dark Lord, and felt her disgust mount. The dragon's scales shimmered the color of midnight and spikes aligned its back, making Harmony wonder how she was sitting without being skewered. Rows of teeth smiled back, gleaming wet with saliva and venom, ready to take an arm from her, in its thin, elongated body. In the dragon's eyes she could see her reflection,dripped with the color of blood and she clenched her wand tight. "Ah, Potter," Lady Voldemort smiled viciously, "it's so nice to see you." Harmony could feel the power behind the dragon's wings as the wind unsteadied her, and all she could think was, oh, not again.
"The Patronus chram," she said in a clear voice.
"That kind of stuff doesn't matter! You don't know him, Malfoy's are bad, they are just evil..." Ron tried to explain earnestly. He was clearly concerned about her well being. It was almost touching.
"What is wrong with him?" He wanted to scream for it all to stop.
"When I was seven years old," Leighton informed them, "I had unknowingly transfigured myself. It is surmountable, if you know what you are doing."
"What do you want?" Ginny asked, still testy from Draco.
"But you said-"
"Or what about Leighton?" Harmony looked back at her in surprise, "now he's a big catch."
Harmony was amused to see a poorly spelled rendition of the dementor attack the day before in the Daily Prophet. Not that she regularly read the Daily Prophet, the paper was conveniently discarded like used rubbish and left at the table where she sat for her afternoon butterbeer and macadamia nut ice cream. She barely noticed the paragraph long article located as it was in the back corner of page seven. The article announced that a certain Dolores J. Umbridge was sacked from her position in the ministry due to her involvement in illegal dementor activities that lead to the dangerous attack upon a young Helga Maywood, who was visiting Diagon Alley with a Hogwarts professor.
"Harry, get up!" Ron said.
"Well, I have a free period now, and I figured that I could use the weight room. Is there something wrong?" He placed his shirt in his newly claimed locker and smiled not so innocently down at her. Harmony narrowed her eyes and gulped, knowing that her face was heating up.
"It takes a lot to faze me," Draco said, "and I don't give up easily."
He flexed in the mirror and felt much better about himself as he replaced his silk pajamas with a school uniform. He spent a bit longer that day making sure that he was absolutely delectable. He found Blaise waiting for him in the common room, and walked with him to the dining room.
Harmony pulled everything out from under her bed and Ginny smiled when she saw the silver dress. "Good choice," she said, "hopefully Draco will be gentlemanly enough."
"Please tell me you have more," Ginny said, while Harmony shrugged her shoulders.
"As a kid, I had a stuffed animal of a muggle toy, called a teddy bear. I guess I thought that it would protect me from the evils in the world, so I used it as my protronus. But now I know what will really protect me," Leighton chuckled a bit, "myself." Nobody doubted that. "A good way to discover your power animal is to meditate, and to really know yourself. Without this knowledge, you may even reject that animal and never acquire your true form. This is a self discovery, and you may not even like the form you take." Leighton smiled a bit, switching his gaze from the girls to Draco for a brief second. "Sometimes you can look at someone and just tell what their animagus form would be." This irked Draco, but he kept his composure.
Harmony looked from Ginny to the little hand being offered, and a tiny smile lifted her cheeks. "Alright," their hands clasped, and she realized that this was the first time holding a girl's hand, and completely not caring about it. "just so long as you aren't joining me to be close to the new professor."
"Hey, where's Luna?" Ginny asked, "I could have sworn that she had got on the portkey with us." Indeed the girl was no where in sight, and Draco sighed, hoping that it didn't mean that they had to stay any longer in this God forsaken tropical forest.
"I don't know! The locket- it just," Draco stopped. He saw the open locket and Harmony's blank stare. "Opened." The vines wrapped around them, and Draco tried as hard as he could to hold on to her. A tendril cut into his throat, and he was forced to let her go and watch as she was dragged down.
"Hey, look at that pretty girl, she probably isn't from here or else I would have asked her out." Harry was so glad to have her broom as she flew around the dragon's head to confuse it. The dragon though just stalked her with its slit eyes and flicked its forked tongue as if it was tasting prey.
Harmony brought her knees to her chest and rested her head. What did any of them know? They hadn't been there. It was her fault. She had brought Sirius into that room, and she had been mental enough to kiss Draco. A bittersweet mistake. She licked her dry lips and laughed at how stupid she was. No one in their right mind would love her. No girl or guy. And if they did, they would die from it. It always happened because of her.
Had he miscalculated? No that wasn't possible. He scrutinized them. When both Potters hugged, he saw that male Potter was an inch taller. He looked at the boy's feet and saw the two inch heeled boots, and then went to Harmony's flats. When Harmony took off her coat, she wore a clinging shirt. Potter, on the other hand, was obviously wearing a bunch of layers. At least five, he estimated. Their voices were remarkably similar, Harmony's just a tad softer. But there was no hiding those same eyes and hair.
"Why are we here?" Draco muttered as he looked around the girls' loo with distaste.
"Is that with Snape's head, or with out?"
"All Blacks are Slytherins, my father was the only exception." Harmony replied and Blaise rolled his eyes.
"At least it doesn't smell like rotten food like last year," Dean replied. The majority of the students in the small room were Gryffindors and Draco leaned against the shelves.
"I'm fine," he said, "really."
"Harry, please open the door," Hermione said in her worry voice.
Harmony would undoubtedly say, "Draco and his girlfriend. He knows that I still want to be with her." The red head was so predictable as he believed what he wanted to hear all along. Draco could almost see the wand hit the target, as Ron nodded, glaring at him. So this was why they were tolerating each other. Why Harry refused to go to the dance. Draco and Harry were acting different because of this girl. It was so simple and the Weasley boy ate it up like another mouth full of pancakes. Hermione frowned in thought, but he couldn't catch what she had said. "Granger said, 'Harry, you did look like a boy in love," Blaise said next to him, with his eyes intent on the bushy haired girl, "what did you send to them? It's weird when you laugh at something from across the hall."
"Maybe he's not here," Ginny whispered, lowering her wand a fraction.
"I am not your date," she spat out words tasting like poison on her tongue. He looked down at her in amusement.
"What is that?" he asked.
"Sorry, never heard of you." His smirk lessened a centimeter.
But even that wasn't enough. Next came the decision that Harmony should be shut away inside, so that the neighbors wouldn't make the connection between the girl in the house and the boy from years before. She became trapped before she even realized what was happening.
"Dobby, I need to ask you a favor," she said.
"14 Sickles," the old man said, "but usually I would charge more." Ron happily handed the old man his change, feeling good that Harmony had enough for it. The old man pulled some wrapping paper from a pocket in his apron, and the gift wrapped itself.
"Merlin, Harry, what about everything he's done?"
"This is getting complicated," Ginny said, "let's go with flooding the dungeons. It's easier, since they live under the lake."
Harmony didn't look back as she stormed off, and went to her room. She threw her bag across the floor and lay face down in the covers. Harmony refused to move a muscle, and groaned into her pillow. The qiuiditch match was scheduled to start after classes, and Harmony knew she didn't have long before the bleachers would be filled and all of the good spots would be taken. She was tempted to stay there where it was warm and alone and watch the game from her window. But she knew that sounded pathetic, and instead, pulled on a plain winter cloak before locking her door. Other students had the same idea of going early, and were making their way to the field in a loud chatter. An overwhelming impulse filled her to make Ron angry, and Harmony had to stop or else pick another fight with him. She left the Gryffindor common room and made sure that no one was near. She tucked away her glasses and dispelled the magic from her face. She didn't want to go as Harry.
"Oh, right," Harmony replied as he whispered spells that immediately smoothed out her skin, removing the pain.
In the dark he could make out the few pieces of furniture, and he forced himself not to think of any graveyard. Before he could wish that it had been him instead in the dirt, a sudden wave of nausea racked his body. Harry grinned and sighed all too soon as it subsided to a dull pain, concentrating in his lower stomach.
"Er. Excuse me for interrupting, but this is Magical Fitness, right?" she asked. The professor turned around and Harmony was surprised to see Madame Hooch, whistle in hand staring at her. She was unmistakable with the yellow eyes and silver hair.
"Look, Frisker doesn't even need the locket," a wide smile filled the insufferable arse's face. The man held out his hands in a placating gesture when Draco glared. "It's a joke, lighten up."
"No," she couldn't mask the annoyance in her voice, "what is it now?"
Some of the torches along the wall had burned out, and a cool draft persisted to permeate through the concrete walls. No one was there to hear her footfalls or see her as a girl, and Harmony wondered if she needed such caution. But she had to use it. She was going to spend most of the night celebrating with Sirius. In a few hours it would be Christmas.
Ginny sidled up to Harmony, hooking her arm through Harmony's one free arm, causing Draco to scowl. "Hey Harmony," Ginny said, as if Draco wasn't there, "did you hear about the Hogsmeade trip?"
Harmony gave it her all, straining each muscle before she reached a point where should would have to jump in order to go on. She was very close, and sweat beaded her forehead. It was all or nothing and Harmony jumped. Her fingers just brushed the handhold when she lost her grip and desperately tried to hold onto anything. Her heart lurched as she felt herself fall, and as she began to drift down, she watched as Luna neared the top and scaled the wall like a monkey.
Bony wouldn't describe her any more, and Harmony felt more comfortable with herself. She felt right, and not overly self conscious about being small. It was getting close to the hour, and she heard as girls and boys laughed and passed her door. She hoped that Draco wouldn't mind waiting for a bit. She put on some of the nude color lip gloss, and smiled nervously into the mirror. She wondered what Draco would think, and pulled at the hem of her dress. She cursed as it rose once more to her mid thigh.
"No," she said.
"I just wanted to be with you," Draco could no longer hold the accusation in her eyes. He had to show her that he cared.
Draco obviously did not see the merit of prancing about in the Forbidden Forest. Not as a defenseless ferret at least. He snorted at Leighton's reply. "Then you should become invisible to us," Leighton said, and Draco bit back his anger, and shoved his fists into robes. He knew that it had been a mistake to show everybody his ferret form. Not even an hour later and he was already suffering from that.
"You'll understand someday," Ginny said, and Harmony hoped not to. "Alright, I'll start with your hair. That should be simple enough." Ginny sat Harmony down and had something like a straightener that passed through Harmony's short black hair.
"But there are so many people, Harry." Then he smiled, "well I can just picture them all." He began to giggle quietly as his hammer rained down on that poor desk. It never stood a chance. The room got louder as more and more students got into the beat and energy. Even Draco Malfoy dismantled his desk without his aurora of bored indifference. Many of the girls struggled with their hammers. Hermione's frustrated whacks could only do minimal damage, and unfortunately she was paired with Neville who looked with fear at the object in his hands. But the students found the fun in the destruction of school property. Harmony would have demolished her desk to dust - loved to even- but all of the splinters progressed to travel to a corner of the room where Leighton attempted to create an upright man, which looked to be a replica of a poorly constructed fat man creature with a long snout and gaping jaw. It would have looked menacing if not for the silly grin.
"I don't know. I really- Damn it." Draco muttered, "Snape said that the Dark Lord was angry because of me."
"Sorry to disturb you two," said a drawling voice, a voice that she all too well knew. She wanted to punch that face; she didn't want to see his arrogant smirk or his cold gray eyes. Just perfect.
Blaise watched as the fake Harry hugged Harmony tight, glaring at Draco, over her shoulder. Quite a nice touch. But would the others fall for it? Pansy and Nott look like they want to kill Harry, but Nott had no reaction to the girl. Everyone at the Gryffindor table was watching, as well as half of the Ravenclaws. And look at that. There were a handful of Hufflepuffs eyeballing their hug, this gossip was going to be around the whole school by dinner. Everyone was completely buying- Er what?
"Not that many young wizards or witches can master that spell," Snape said with a hint of bored curiosity. "A feat meant for something I presume."
"Did something happen?" Draco asked.
Claws pinned her shoulder down and Harmony waited for the bite to her neck. She could feel the hot breath of the dragon and the aching stabs as the roots dug into her burned back. When the dragon snorted in her face, she looked up in surprise. Its nostrils flared as it sniffed and went through her white collared shirt. "What? Why isn't Potter screaming?" Voldemort looked over the dragon's horns and peered down. The dragon prodded at her shirt till the Malfoy heirloom slipped out, and Harmony realized that it was the dragon necklace Draco had given her that spread a warmth over her chest. "What?" Voldemort screeched and began hissing angrily at the dragon. Harmony met the dragon's red eyes as she recalled Draco's words to her, it's said that dragon's blood or poison is at the center...
"I'm done," Draco announced.
"Well, he's probably not keeping track," Draco kept to her slow pace, and Harmony carefully set her head straight ahead. "Does your head hurt?" he asked, feeling a slight migraine at work behind his left eye.
"Like she said, she has a thing for dragons."
"Don't call me that, you ferret," came Ron's predictable response. Harry continued to observe Malfoy's hurt filled face. He was an exceptional actor; well he was good at fabricated pain.
"And you and Potter, there is something about about you two that you're hiding." Draco sometimes forgot how sharp Blaise could be. He wondered briefly why he had always hung out with the trolls Crabe and Goyle. They didn't do him any justice.
"Most people haven't seen a dragon close up." Harmony argued, "but you work with dragons in Romania, shouldn't you know better?"
"Guys I am fine," Harmony grumbled. Leighton still had his eyes on Harmony, and Draco could see that he cared for her.
"You girls didn't bring bathing suits did you? Well Ginny has a spare here that should fit you Harmony."
Christmas with the Weasleys:
"Alright that's it," he said, "let's get back." Harmony held half of the potions as they carried them to their desk. Draco set up the cauldron and Harmony followed Draco's instructions. Soon the sound of chopping and stirring filled the room and Snape sat at his desk, watching the students with disdain.
"Well if Mister Potter thinks he can follow this rigorous course, then he may join it," Harmony felt a breath that she had been unknowingly holding come out. "I will notify your head of house, and tomorrow if you return bring in a different set of clothes, you will change in that room," she said and pointed to a forlorn looking door that had a boy's locker room sign.
"Is that so?" Harmony said between some buttered toast in her mouth.
The anticipation of seeing Harmony, set Draco into something of a nervousness which he was not used to. His stomach turned as the train halted to admit the students on the platform. He took out his pocket mirror, to recheck that everything was in place. Draco gave himself a dashing smile before it snapped with a click, as footsteps began to pass his compartment. The silence of the train was soon replaced with chatter and laughter and Draco sat alone in his compartment.
"Yeah," Harmony muttered, and watched Draco closely. "But even so, I think that you should fly your heart out and catch that snitch. How else will you beat me?" Draco watched her lazily and took his feet off from the desk.
"Nope," Harmony shrugged her shoulders. "But that's typical."
"Oh, so it hasn't started yet." Dumbledore looked troubled, as if he had discovered that the very lost lemon drop in his jaw had dissipated.
"Sly," she said softly, "I like it." He was tempted to reach out and touch her, to feel her soft unruly hair. Her eyes widened as if she had read his thoughts, and she stepped back. "I, er." Harmony stumbled through her words and Draco leaned against the wall once more. "Congrats," she said at last. Draco smirked down at her.
"Your mother is in danger," Harmony said, "we have to get to the Malfoy Manor." Draco looked taken aback, before keeping his face straight.
"I can't," she said, "not now." What, did she want him to wait for her like a nice little dog? "Please go." This was all wrong, just humiliating.
She took a step back with wide eyes as their connection broke. "Wow," she said.
"Why are you soaked?" Harmony turned to see an amused Draco who had obviously finished his work out. He had a towel over his shoulder which Harmony eyed.
"Sure, if you know a good place for tea." Draco continued to hold her as they walked together into a shop she had never been in before.
"Why?" She wondered out loud, mindful of the four snoring boys. She sat atop her bed, waiting for twelve. It had only been two short months but this room didn't have its same appeal. Her surroundings were familiar, yet altered in some way. Like meeting an old friend again to find that though the face was familiar the friendship was gone. Or maybe it was the noise. Harmony didn't recall the snores of her slumber mates being quite so magnified.
"Yeah, how old are you really?" He gave another of his wide smiles.
He paused, casually looking through his bag, for a quill, until a few Slytherin stragglers passed them making their way to class. When the hallways were empty, he gave her an irritated look. "We've been through this before," Draco stated curtly, "I don't know where she is." He left her abruptly, walking away to class.
"I'm Harmony Maystone," she said weakly as the burning ice sensation lingered at her throat. "I was out at a café when I knew something was up, I ran through the back alley towards my flat, but I didn't know that they where there. The ice made me trip and my wand slipped somewhere, I don't really remember much after that."
"What?"
"At maximum till you would be twenty. You would also regrettably be much less developed than others your age." This didn't make sense.
"Sorry, I guess you're just going to have to wait." Damn him, she thought and slammed her locker open. Either she was going to have to walk all the way to her room to get dressed, or wait for him there to change and leave. But Harmony wasn't just going to allow Draco get the best of her and be late. She began to unbutton the first of many layers and shoved her black school robes into her locker. She dropped her glasses on her gym clothes, and grabbed the hem of her gray vest and started to unceremoniously pull it over her head. She nearly ripped off her tie, and when she got to her white collared shirt, she paused before beginning to unbutton that as well.
The screech from the dragon could have been heard miles away, and Harmony sank into the tree trunk as it pointed its head up. A livid snarl came from Voldemort as she kicked the beast in the neck, "you will obey me!" The dragon would have none of that, it twisted its body, throwing itself at trees, trying to shake the mad women off. Harmony pulled herself shakily up and went where she had last seen her wand. With it in her hands, she faced Voldemort who had wisely dismounted the dragon and was now trying to avada kedavarait. "You worthless traitor!" Voldemort howled. With the dragon gone, she snapped her head at Harmony and breathed in short gasps. "It doesn't matter, I still am more powerful." Their wands were pointed at each other and Harmony smirked at Voldemort.
"Why did he do it?" Draco asked.
"I see," Draco said.
"I think you better hear this." Draco got closer, while Luna poked the extened earlobe.
"You didn't respond to my letters," Draco said quietly. "Why are you here?" And why did you have to kill a man, was left unsaid.
