Harry’s mind turns back to every time they felt uncomfortable with those “Boy Who Lived” headlines, and they wonder if it was less about the articles and more about the word “boy.” Or if it was maybe both. They think about adding their gender issues to their long list of flaws.
Taking their name card, Harry walks over to the tables, looking for their seat. Hermione and Ron beat them to the table, but there’s already a blond head there, and Harry’s stomach tightens when they see Draco.
And Harry feels like an idiot now, but how could they have known? Harry had thought maybe Draco had been flirting, with the cuddling and the first names, but when he didn’t kiss them back…
“Listen, I’m not going to force you on the boat. But I’m getting on. And you know Molly’s going to be talking about this for the next few months, if not longer. We’re getting married, Malfoy, you’re not going to be able to avoid her.”
“What did they do to you?” Draco could feel the questioning getting annoying but couldn’t stop himself. He needed to
There was a bathroom attached to the bedroom, and Molly left them for the night. The Burrow was nicer than Draco had expected, but, well… “You can take the floor,” Draco said, half-joking. “I’ll sleep on the bed.”
Draco was trying to be as quiet as possible, not wanting to disturb anyone. But as he neared the kitchen, he heard hushed voices arguing inside.
“I’m sorry for using your name to get out of exile. I’m sorry for siding with Voldemort. I’m sorry for… for everything I said to you and your friends back at school. I’m sorry for—”
Harry furiously pushed the lift button for the Auror’s level. “He’s actually kind of funny. And sweet. And an
Harry feels exactly like he did when they told him he was gay. He sits down on Hermione’s bed in shock. “Oh my god,” he says. “Have I liked Malfoy since sixth year?”
“Well, I’ll get next time, then,” Harry insists. Malfoy blushes at that, and Harry’s stomach twists into a knot. He’s starting to think that he might be in trouble.
Molly finally left the yarn shop, arms filled with bags. She grinned as she saw Draco and Ginevra. “All set! Are you two ready to head home?”
The conversation flows as they talk about the new Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes products, and Harry tries to hold in a cringe every time Ron calls Harry ‘he.’ By the end of the night, Hermione’s giving Harry a puzzled look, but she just kisses them on the cheek and wishes them a good night.
Harry doesn’t know what Draco’s doing. But he’s here, and Harry needs to be the Gryffindor that he is, and be honest about... well, everything.
The snake’s name is Jean, and she’s a Maltese Fire Python. She’s just as large as she looks, maybe a few feet long, though she looks tiny in the gigantic exam room (
Potter looks disappointed, and Draco thinks that whatever this prank is, it must have to do with dancing. He may have accepted that he deserves Potter’s punishment, but that doesn’t mean he’s going to walk into it willingly.
“Draco, how about you tell them how we got together?” Potter smiled softly at him, but his eyes were annoyed.
And now they’re at Hogwarts. Again. And Potter doesn’t seem ready to let go of the fight. McGonagall is making her welcome speech, and Draco catches Potter's eye. Potter glares at him, then pointedly turns to McGonagall.
Harry stepped slowly up next to Malfoy, standing shoulder to shoulder with him. “It really is beautiful,” Harry yelled over the engine.
And then Potter was grabbing him by the shirt and shoving him into the closet door. “You’re using me for my name?”
“I don’t think Mother would be up for that,” Draco said quickly. “Really, it’s fine, we already have a plan for tomorrow and we wouldn’t want to impose.”
They’ve ended up playing Truth or Dare, which was inevitable, really. They always end up playing it at some point during these socials. Pansy usually starts it. She and Granger have unofficially become the leaders of the eighth year group, and they’ve become close friends, too. He never would have imagined.
“Well, there are some people who don’t identify as men or women,” Malfoy explains. “Some people fall in the middle. Some people fall completely outside of that binary. Some people identify with multiple genders. Some people’s genders are fluid. And some people, like Patil, don’t identify with any gender at all.”
Harry is ecstatic to get out of that hotel and back to Grimmauld Place. Kreacher is a sight for sore eyes.
Draco in years one through five, with his seemingly incurable hate crush on Potter, would have been insulted. But now? “Absolutely not,” he agrees.
They pull out their wand, pointing it at the bed. Something with… Harry can’t even come up with the first word of the spell.
Malfoy’s cheeks flush. “No, that won’t be necessary. I’ll Owl you your payment. See you around, Potter.”
It’s just Malfoy, though. It’s not like Malfoy didn’t spend all of his school years calling Harry an attention seeker. So it’s fine to try this out with him: he and they.
Granger looks at Weasley, who shrugs. “We’ve gone all the way,” Granger says matter-of-factly, as if expecting someone to be upset with her for this. A few people whoop, and Pansy grins. “Great, you pick who’s next,” she says.
Malfoy’s red in the face and turning towards the door. Harry grabs him and pulls him back around. They’re… too close. Malfoy’s eyes are wide. Harry takes a step back.
Draco’d had a year to get himself ready for his trial. But even after all that waiting, and all the days of the trial itself, judgment day still came too quickly.
He stood up and waited for Draco to follow suit, then left. When they got to their room, Harry sat down on the bed. Draco quietly closed the bedroom door and walked over to sit down next to him.
The waiter drops off the bill and Harry reaches for it, but Draco beats him to it. “It’s my turn,” Harry tells him.
"With that being said, we have hired a Mind Healer to assist you in your transition back into a calm, peaceful life." Draco swears McGonagall looks at Potter with that last line.
“Arthur here seems to think you just made up this engagement so Malfoy won’t get sent away. Is he right?”
“No! I didn’t even have snakes then,” Draco replies, looking steadfastly at his empty plate. “I thought it was…” and then he mumbles something Harry can’t hear.
a man. That means telling people, or dealing with feeling uncomfortable every time someone talks about them, and
, Harry begins in Parseltongue. Malfoy makes a startled noise. “Sorry,” Harry says in English. “Is this okay? I find it works to calm them down as I do the examination.”
“She thinks because the Muggles who raised you treated you terribly, you have terrible self worth, or something. Is that why you agreed to faking this engagement with me?” He tried to make the question sound sarcastic.
Dave looks hopeful, but it seems Malfoy still hasn’t fully grasped the concept of making appointments ahead of time. “No, thanks,” he replies. And then he takes the rest of the money- still quite a large wad- and places it in Dave’s hand.
The program leaders usher everyone out of the bar at ten, way too early for Harry to be as drunk as they are. Draco’s swaying beside them, too, because Malfoy somehow became Draco after spitting tequila on the bartender, and he grabs onto Harry’s arm for balance. They stumble into the lift together and over to their room.
“Dare,” he says. No way he’s answering any questions for the Gryffindors about the Death Eaters. Or the war. Or, really, anything.
Draco hopes it sounds genuine, because it is, and not like an insult, which it’s not, and it’s the most he’s ever said to Potter civilly. He’s relieved when Potter finally replies. “Apology accepted, Malfoy. Although I’m pretty sure you’ve got quite a few more of those to give out to other people.”
Malfoy grabbed it and immediately wrapped it around his waist, looking furious. His wet hair drooped over his forehead like a drowned rat. “Why are there no towels in this place?!”
“I’m sorry again,” he says as they amble down the path. The light is reflecting off the snow and Harry has to squint. “I shouldn’t have dared you to go to the Ball with me. It was Hermione’s idea.”
Draco still sits next to Harry during the teaching lectures, but Harry can feel his anger seething between them. They don’t try to talk to Draco during breaks or lunch. Harry skips dinner, leaving Draco to eat with whoever he wants to, heading up to bed instead. They don’t want to make things any more uncomfortable than they already are.
“I’m saying, the only reason he would have done that is if he cared about you. He obviously likes you
And then reality sets in. Potter would never ask him to the Ball romantically… which meant that after all these weeks of friendship, of getting along, Potter really was just stringing him along to play some sort of joke on him. Draco’s not going to fall for it. But he’s not going to back down from the dare, either.
Harry bursts out laughing. Dave looks like someone just stepped on him. “He’s okay, Dave, I’ll take it from here.”
The eighth years are arranged in a circle on the floor, and Draco squeezes himself in between Pansy and Greg.
Harry’d been with the Aurors for almost a year now. After the war ended, he’d tried to spend time with the Weasleys and with the Hogwarts rebuild, but this had only resulted in him fighting with Ginny and getting frustrated with not being able to help Hogwarts in the ways it really needed. The Auror department was a vast improvement from the awkwardness of Weasley dinners after the breakup or the anxiety from seeing Hogwarts so far from recovery.
know. That first day, Harry had told him he was a vet for Muggles, that he had never worked with magical snakes before. So Malfoy definitely knows. And of course Harry wants to help his snakes, especially if the Wizarding vets refused him service, but. Well. Malfoy didn’t have to act like it was
“That’s very nice of you to offer,” Draco replied, as polite as he could. “But I don’t think it’s necessary.”
Harry hides his face in his hands. “Yes. I’m sorry, Draco, I… I can’t just go to lunch, and be friends. I want more. I’m sorry. Just give me some time, okay? Give me a few weeks, and maybe....”
“Harry, look, it’s nothing to be ashamed of. We’ve known since… fourth year?” She turns to Ron, who nods.
They’ve been dating for two months when Draco gets Harry a ‘Blown to Slyther-Eens’ wall hanging, and Harry knows he
Harry was on the floor. He jumped up, threw his pillow on the bed, and bunched up his blankets in his arms.
“Esteemed guests, this is your captain speaking,” Peter’s voice called from the speakers. “It appears there’s a storm coming in and we’ve hit some rough waters. Please head to the lower deck and stay there while we pass through.”
“She looks fine to me,” Harry tells Malfoy, who’s gotten distracted again by the walls. “And she tells me she ate today. So, nothing to worry about. If she’s still overactive when you take her home, let me know.”
Harry laughs, not taking his eyes off Draco. “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that. You just come in here, looking like
. Harry had noticed them before, how could he not, but now he’s really looking at them, and they’re… the Dark Mark is on his left forearm, but the snake and skull are surrounded by beautifully detailed flowers. There’s no color to them, but somehow they look more realistic than, well, actual flowers. The flowers go all the way up Malfoy’s arm, beyond the sleeve of the t-shirt. His right arm is a sleeve of flowers as well, and Harry wants to see how far they go. If there are more tattoos, under his shirt. Harry realizes with shock- he’s bought Malfoy a shirt, with a snake surrounded by flowers on it. Harry’s bought him a shirt that’s basically mirroring his tattoos. Malfoy’s going to think he was staring at his tattoos-
Draco has a perfect view of the table, so he sees Potter getting stopped about fifteen times on the way over. Everyone wants a word with the Saviour. Draco’s getting exhausted and he wishes Potter would just get whatever this is over with so he can go to bed.
So when Harry opens the letter from Headmistress McGonagall, he’s not as upset as he might have been if he hadn’t spent those years stalking Malfoy. Still upset, granted, but you can’t just tell him he’s going to be forced to not only room with Malfoy during their Hogwarts-mandated teacher training retreat at a Muggle hotel, but also forced to partner up with him for any activities, without expecting any reaction.
in our department? Spies. We’ve only been around a couple of years and we’re the most transparent of
“That’s one way to avoid fighting, I suppose,” Hermione says thoughtfully. “Has he changed much since school?”
“Move over.” Harry pulled the comforter down and jumped in next to Malfoy, bumping against him as he quickly set his blankets on top and smoothed them out. Malfoy looked disheveled and exhausted, hair mussed and bags under his eyes. Still, he was wearing silk pyjamas, and Harry somehow felt underdressed in his own snitch-patterned ones.
“Well, it’s huge,” Harry tells him. “I spent months cleaning it up and now I barely even spend time there.”
He had only been down to Level Two twice since he started working at the Ministry; once to testify in the trial of Narcissa Malfoy, and once just a week ago to testify in Draco Malfoy’s trial. It had been odd to see Malfoy so quiet and composed.
Harry doesn’t wait for Dave to come get him. He pokes his head into the waiting room and sees Malfoy, wearing the new outfit, looking... fit. Malfoy looks absolutely incredible. The tight shirt looks even better on him than expected, and Harry can see the outline of his biceps through the shirt sleeves. The orange snake around his arm doesn’t look particularly gigantic, though Harry knows that doesn’t mean much. “Exam Room D,” he calls out. Malfoy follows him to the room.
Malfoy tilts his head, considering. “Okay,” he says, apparently approving. He puts the snake down on Harry’s table and lets him begin the exam.
"We should be able to talk about sex," Pansy chimes in. "Or adult stuff. Or- the war. Without worrying if Healer Man is listening in or if the younger years can hear us too. We deserve some more privacy."
have had it custom made, because there are Slytherin colors in the background and the snakes are making rather obscene gestures.
“They didn’t really do anything,” Potter said, resigned. “They mostly pretended I didn’t exist. Although living in a cupboard as a child was less than ideal.”
There are hundreds of people milling around, chatting. “Where’s Padma?” Harry asks. “Have you seen her yet?”
“I’ve been thinking, and… I’m going to start another practice, in the Wizarding world. For magical snakes.”
Harry realises his mouth is wide open and snaps it shut. “I’m… I… You know this is a Muggle practice, right?”
Harry tries to relax. He gives Gertrude another routine exam, and then uses diagnostic spells to check out her magic. He asks her questions, and she gives him vague answers. But he can’t really focus on Gertrude’s magical properties, not when Draco’s laughing at the comic on the wall of snakes unwinding after work.
They are, it seems. Potter’s holding onto Draco’s arm and leading them into the Great Hall, where music is already playing. It’s going to be some sort of humiliation in front of the entire school, then. Delightful.
“Is everything okay with Gertrude? Did you finally run out of snakes?” Harry asks as they walk over to Exam Room A.
Ron wisely kept silent for their ride, and stayed one step behind Harry as they walked as fast as they could to Gilbertson’s office.
“Goodnight.” Harry leans on their side, sinking into the sheets. They’re asleep before they notice the knot is gone.
Draco looks shocked. He takes Harry’s arms, and moves them away from his face. “Harry, what do you think we’ve been doing?”
“Right, right, sorry again,” Hermione replies, still sounding distressed. “Anyways, how are the training sessions going?”
“Could we perhaps continue this tonight? Over dinner? And I’ve been wanting to meet all of your snakes, too-”
Harry huffs a laugh. “Fair enough. Yeah, I finished training a few months ago. Went on my first mission. They were all excited to send me out into the field.”
They skip Friday night dinner this week, since the Ministry is holding a charity gala. Rose is staying with Molly for the night, and Harry waits for Hermione and Ron to finish getting ready so they can head over together. Harry usually brings Luna as his date to these events, but Ginny’s got a game tonight so Luna’s off in the stands cheering her on.
There’s a tall man with long, blond hair in the lobby, looking outside at the empty parking lot. Harry’s positive he’s slipped into a nap and is now dreaming, as he realizes the man is wearing a fluffy white bathrobe, an honest to goodness bathrobe, in Harry’s clinic, with striped black and white pants underneath. The bathrobe’s sleeves are rolled up to the man’s elbows and Harry sees tattoos covering his forearms. There’s a bright red snake wrapped around the man’s neck. Odd, Harry thinks, that the man didn’t use a carrier, but seeing as this is a dream, it rather doesn’t matter.
Harry alternates between chatting in Parseltongue with Melvin and chatting in English with Malfoy. Malfoy lets him run extra tests on Melvin- Harry wants to learn as much as he can about these magical snakes. Melvin’s a Vanishing Boa, but rather than actually vanishing, he can create the illusion of his prey disappearing, so that no competitors snatch it up.
“Erm, yes,” Malfoy replies, looking quickly at the ground and then back at Harry. “I found the Wizarding practices to be quite unwelcoming to someone of my, ah, history.”
Malfoy starts talking about Paris, his apprenticeship, and some unexplored Potions properties, and slowly, they both drift into sleep.
. And, as a reminder, you lied to the Wizengamot as well, so if you backtrack now, you’ll screw yourself too.”
Draco took a deep breath, reeling in his emotions. He needed to backtrack, needed to get less personal. “No wonder you’re so messed up,” he finally quipped.
And then he thought of his mother. His mother, who had sacrificed everything for him, and would now be alone, in the Manor, with no one. He wouldn’t be able to see her again for years, when her probation finally ended. Just a month after her trial, she was already a shadow of the woman who’d raised him, and he didn’t know if she’d make it until then.
“That’s what I thought.” Harry smiled into the darkness, feeling… content. Before he could overthink it, he stood up, gathered his blankets, and slipped into the bed next to Draco.
It’s a bit of an ordeal moving all the snakes in, but there’s plenty of room. They convert the guest rooms on the second and third floors into homes for the snakes, transfiguring the furniture into rocks and tree trunks to resemble the snakes’ natural habitats. Reginald gets the whole fourth floor to himself.
“Oh, it’s nothing,” Draco waves him off. They walk to the apparition point together and Harry’s not sure how to say goodbye- is a handshake too formal? Is a hug too familiar? They’re staring at each other, and Draco looks expectant.
“Sure, Molly, come in,” Harry called, as casually as he could. He scooched closer to Malfoy, trying to settle in a way that would make it look like they were comfortable with each other. Malfoy put his right arm around Harry’s shoulders, catching on to the plan to look like a couple, but it felt stiff and awkward.
“Blimey, I’ve heard of those!” Ron exclaims, mouth full. “Charlie was studying fossils in South Africa of some extinct dragon and they came across a nest!”
Malfoy’s mouth twitches, and Harry can’t hold back his own smile. A minute goes by, and Harry’s struggling to keep his expression neutral. Malfoy raises an eyebrow at him, giving Harry a full-on smirk. Harry can’t breathe for a moment, but then Malfoy drops the expression and starts laughing. Harry widens his eyes, trying to tell Malfoy to be quiet, but the pairs around them start laughing too, and Harry eventually relaxes. Three minutes pass, and then five, and finally, Betsy tells them to lower their arms.
Friday night dinners are Harry’s favorite time of the week. They rotate between Grimmauld Place and Hermione and Ron’s London flat, and it’s really the only time he gets to see his two best friends. Harry usually prefers the flat, with its organized chaos and toys strewn about. Harry’s spent so much time fixing up Grimmauld, and he’s proud of what it’s become, but it’s so… big. Empty.
It’s not a particularly big clinic, only a few examination rooms, the lobby, and Harry’s office. That’s all he really needs with a practice so specific. Harry still rushes to the lobby, though. If he has no appointments, then this must be an emergency walk-in.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says, looking softly at Harry. And he looks so beautiful in that moment that Harry has another terrible epiphany that they maybe should have had earlier: they want to kiss Draco Malfoy.
. Harry turned and smiled softly at Draco, entranced by a sliver of moonlight reflected on his pale skin.
Draco pushed back again and resolutely ignored the fact that Potter smelled like strawberries. “Er, yes, just a bit.”
But after a while, Draco gives up on disguising it. He likes Potter. Again. He wonders if he ever even stopped.
“Alright,” Harry says, mind already racing to connections between mamba anatomy and the latent magical properties of stinging hexes. “And what’s been going on with Gertrude?”
Harry laughs. “Honestly, that’s fair too. Well, I give you my word that I will at least try not to fight with him in front of you. And I’ll do my best not to set a world-ending crisis in motion at Hogwarts this year.”
“Draco, look, I’m sorry, I just- I know you had a terrible time tonight.” Potter has the audacity to look absolutely miserable. “I shouldn’t have made you come with me, I just…”
The castle created a new common room with attached bedrooms for the eighth years as soon as it heard the news they'd be returning. Two per room, which is nice for privacy. It seems they've laid out the room assignments so that people are mostly with their houses, but there was some overlap. Pansy, for example, is rooming with Granger.
Pansy grins. Draco wonders how it must be for them, living together. They seem to be… perhaps not quite friendly, but definitely civil. “Great,” Pansy starts. “Truth or dare. Granger, you first.”
"I hope you all enjoyed yourselves!" he shouts. "The next social will be two weeks from now. New activities, new fun!" Harry cringes, but as he walks back to the eighth year common room with the others, he thinks how it wasn't half bad. He kind of enjoyed himself. It isn't until he lays down to sleep that he realizes Malfoy never had a turn for Two Truths.
“They’re not going to send me to Azkaban,” Harry replied. “And you don’t have a choice anymore. I’m doing this. You don’t deserve exile.”
Malfoy closed his eyes tightly, looking pained. “Do us both a favor and find a towel before you do so.”
And now Draco gasps softly, and now they’re stopped in the middle of the road. “You do have a punchable face,” Draco says. “It’s also a face I’d like to kiss.”
It’s another pouch of Galleons, way too much, just as before. And there’s another item in the parcel too. It’s an embroidery hoop, and there’s a cross-stitched snake, a European common adder, with a witch hat on it. The word ‘adder-cadabra’ is stitched across the top. Harry grins. He doesn’t know how Malfoy knew about the silly abracadabra incantation, but it makes him happy to think Malfoy knows more about Muggles than he lets on.
Harry gets to pick the place this time, but he doesn’t really have any idea where to go, so he chooses the cafe they went to the first time.
Harry’s not surprised to see Malfoy here, but he is surprised when he walks over despite Luna being away.
“Draco!” Harry screamed, terror gripping his entire body. He ripped his shoes off, took a running start, and leapt into the water after Malfoy. After Draco.
Draco whips his head up to stare at Potter. He’s got a determined look on his face, and for one, glorious second, Draco thinks that Potter likes him back. That he’s got a chance. That Potter wants to go with him to the ball, as his date, because he likes him.
The other eighth years notice the change between them, and point it out. “Well I’m not hexing you either, MacMillan” Malfoy retorts one day, during one of their mandatory socials. “Should I start?”
don’t have to do them with you, and I’d like to work with other people. So, nice to see you, sort of, and I’ll talk to you later.” Padma pushes past Harry and Malfoy and starts mingling with the Muggles.
Malfoy just nods. The chatter around the room fades into nothing, and Betsy announces the next question.
Harry immediately takes him to an exam room, but he appears to be in good health. They put up signs, but no one comes by to claim him. Harry tries Parseltongue, but the snake isn’t very talkative.
Malfoy snorted in reply. “Granger, actually. Didn’t she tell you? She stopped by at the beginning of my probation last year, brought me loads of books on pureblooded bigotry.”
“Yeah,” Harry replies. “See, I have this big stupid crush on you, and she thought if I dared you then you’d go, and I was thinking, maybe I could dance with you, and maybe ask you out.” Harry sighs. “But with our truth or dare crowd, of course daring you was basically forcing you to go with me, and I would never want to force you to do anything, ever, I just… like you. A lot.”
A few weeks after his trial, he had a panic attack. He couldn’t get out of his head and Voldemort was there and the pain from getting the Dark Mark was fresh like new. Draco had grabbed the nearest sharp object he could find- a butcher knife from the kitchen- and he cut out the Mark as best he could before he passed out.
Harry decides to turn Grimmauld into the location for his magical snake veterinary practice. Between appointments at the Muggle clinic and study sessions for his Wizarding veterinary tests, he and Draco spend most of their time there, fixing the ground floor into something resembling a clinic.
Harry’s assistant pokes his head in. “Alright if I head home a bit early, Dr. Potter? Looks like there’re no more appointments for the rest of the day.”
“Ha ha, Ron, very funny, can you hear me laughing?” Harry replies, rolling their eyes. “No, seriously, like he’s fine. But I do have to spend most of my weekdays with him, so please, let’s talk about you two instead.”
“Her name’s Gertrude,” Malfoy tells him, brow furrowed. “Sorry, you meant her species? Or her condition?”
In, out. In, out. Potter surely does not want to talk about his deaths with someone who supported his murderer.
Draco started walking towards the Ministry lift, when a strong hand grabbed his arm and pulled him into a closet.
“Do you have a phone?” Malfoy’s expression is blank. “Telephone? Mobile? Cell phone? Fellytone, I’ve heard some wizards say?” Malfoy just looks vaguely baffled. “Okay, then your best bet is to make an appointment in person, with Dave.”
And then there’s a scream, and Harry jumps away from Draco with a start. Dave’s standing in the doorway, staring at them, horror in his eyes.
“It’s settled, then,” Molly announced. “You’ll get married at the Burrow. Monday is a holiday and Harry’s off work, so let’s move the wedding to Monday, and we’ll spend tomorrow getting the place ready!”
Betsy’s helpers come around, bringing a rope to each of the groups. They’re instructed to tie their legs together so that they each have one free leg and one tied leg.
“Er, Padma uses they and them pronouns,” Harry says, slightly uncomfortable. “But they’re good, and yeah, they’re teaching Transfiguration. They’re rather talented too, or at least it seems like it from the stories they've told me.”
Harry stares at him, waiting for someone else to say anything in dissent, but no one does. "Wrong," Harry grins. "I'm an excellent cook, though."
Breathing hard, Harry looks up at Draco's face. Draco bites his lip, then sits down on the bed and gestures for Harry to join him.
He leaned over to look at the clock, his hand landing on a piece of paper. It wasn’t even 8 a.m. Harry picked up the paper, grabbed his glasses, and read.
Harry clears his throat. “Ah, excellent, why don’t we go on to… Dave, which exam rooms have been cleaned?”
“I thought it was clever!” Harry raises his arms in surrender, but he’s still laughing. “Since the Muggles don’t know I’m actually talking to their snakes?”
“Remember, hold that eye contact,” Betsy says from her spot on the podium. “We want you to dive in deep,
Harry’s trying to remember the details now. He had only been open a week, and was slowly getting new clients. He hadn’t hired Dave yet and was working his own reception. Malfoy came in… Harry didn’t think he had a snake with him, but he left so quickly Harry wasn’t certain.
“None of your business, Malfoy.” Potter’s voice wasn’t unkind, but Draco could feel the tension in the air that he’d introduced with his question.
“Well, bye, then,” Harry says awkwardly, cringing at himself. Draco looks… disappointed? Harry gives a quick wave and apparates home.
Harry repeats the same examination he gave Gertrude last week, though it’s quite a bit more challenging with Bertha’s size. Harry needs to use both hands to check her spine and underbelly, but sure enough, there’s a nice, rabbit-sized lump.
"Good morning," she says formally. "Pansy and I have discussed our socials, and how the eighth year needs are different than the other years."
Harry opened his mouth to reply, but was cut off by Malfoy. “Under the Forcible Use of Dangerous Potions Law of 1746, it is against the law to force Veritaserum on anyone unless they’ve been arrested for a Tier 5 crime or higher. And Harry of course wouldn’t want to suffer through Veritaserum willingly just to satisfy your doubt.”
Draco is doing okay, though, all things considered. His grades are second only to Granger, although it’s not as impressive now that there are only fifteen students in their year. The socials are actually becoming enjoyable, and he’s starting to think not only of Potter as a friend, but Granger and the other Gryffindors, too. They’re almost charming, now that their determination and loyalty includes him, instead of being directed against him.
They gradually move up in the line until it’s finally their turn. Their competition is a pair of older men who grin at them as they step up. Harry gives a smile back. He turns to Malfoy, who looks more resigned than competitive.
Draco rolls his eyes, but he’s smiling. “Excellent job of pointing out the obvious, thanks for that.”
“More than big, I’d say,” Weasley replied. “As we’re his best friends, we supposedly have known about your relationship the entire time. We’re friendly. We call you Draco. You call us by our first names.”
Draco comes into the clinic again on Monday with a titanoboa. He’s got it transfigured as a grass snake, but as soon as Harry comes out to get him, Draco says, “Maybe the large exam room would be good.”
, it says, because there aren’t really any snakes that start with a D and Harry’s not about to skip to E).
Draco looks in question to Harry at the ‘he,’ but Harry just shrugs back. They’ll tell Ron and Hermione when they’re ready. But they know Draco won’t make a big deal about it if Harry doesn’t want that yet.
understand each other. The more you understand your fellow teachers, the better you’ll be able to understand your students.”
After Apparating into downtown Ottery St Catchpole, Draco found it was rather easy to avoid talking about Potter or the engagement, as Molly and Ginevra were perfectly capable of keeping up their conversation without his participation. Ginevra had cut her hair short since leaving school, and it suited her. She walked with confidence and seemed genuinely happy to be spending time with him and Molly.
They headed to the back of the boat, the sound of the engine loud against the stillness of the air. “Sorry about the noise,” Peter shouted over the engine. “But look at that view!”
Harry slowly pulled away from the kiss, smiling. Draco’s eyes were bright. “Yes, Auror Gilbertson,” Draco stated matter-of-factly. “I’m afraid I’ll have to retract my previous statement. Harry and I actually
“She looks great, Mrs. Harris. Call Dave to schedule her next appointment- this time next year would be good.”
It wasn’t until lunchtime that Molly actively brought Draco into the conversation. “Now, what are you and Harry doing for the holidays this year? They’re already coming up quick!”
It’s about three in the morning and Draco hasn’t been able to sleep at all. It’s like that sometimes. He just thinks and thinks and thinks and before he knows it, it’s morning. Tonight, Draco’s stomach is grumbling and he decides to grab a snack from the kitchens. He quietly gets out of bed and makes his way through the dimly lit common room towards the door. He’s creeping past one of the larger sofas when he trips over something big. And hard.
Draco was heavy and whimpering against him. Harry kept one arm wrapped tightly around Draco’s body, using the other to swim after the ship. The waves continued to jerk them up and down, and it was everything he could do to keep them both above water. His swimming arm was straining, but he had to get there. Had to get Draco onto something solid.
Potter just looks at him steadily. His hair is all over the place, and Draco can’t help but stare. “I wouldn’t call it even. Did I… did it leave scars?”
Hermione narrows her eyes, but nods politely. "Sure," she says. "I love surfing. I suck at chess. I've never left Britain."
Potter takes a step towards him, then another. He’s so close. Too close. Draco can feel his warm breath on him. Draco should turn around. Back away. And then Potter leans forward, slowly, and before Draco can register what he’s doing, Potter’s left a soft kiss on his cheek.
“Dr. Potter?” Malfoy sneers, but when Harry looks at him, he just looks mildly amused.  Any awkwardness from last time about being around Harry, or possibly being in Harry’s Muggle vet clinic, has disappeared.
“It’s Ron. And don’t thank me.” He and Granger — Hermione — began to walk towards the door, but Hermione turned back towards Draco before she went back to the party.
“Fine.” He pulls up his left sleeve, staring determinedly at the ground. He still hears the reactions. The gasps. Draco knows it’s not a pretty sight.
If you had asked him back at Hogwarts what his plans were for after school, he would have either said Auror, or laughed in your face at the idea of surviving past seventh year.
They talk for a while after they finish eating, about snakes, and homes, and where their friends have ended up. Malfoy insists on paying for the food.
Dave looks between the two of them. “Exam Room A is available, Dr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy, it may benefit you to have our office number. It’s much easier on Dr. Potter if you have an appointment-”
“Erm, no,” Harry replies. “It was his pet.” He hands Dave the much larger stack of money, the leftovers from what Malfoy had given him. “Here, take this, it was extra.”
Harry stands up quickly, and Padma and Draco both look at them in confusion. “All right, Harry?” Padma asks. “Maybe we should call that one the last round.”
“All right, well I’ll let you be, eat up! And meet us downstairs when you’re done, we’re decorating for tomorrow.”
“That’s better.” Molly patted the front of her apron, as if forgetting something. “Well, back to the house. Our guests will be here any minute.”
have mentioned - ‘I know firsthand what a difference can be made with the proper love and support-’” Malfoy sighs dramatically, placing his hand over his heart. “This is just touching.”
Harry had originally considered bringing up the subject to Hermione, since she’d mentioned reading books about it, but ultimately got nervous.
Harry James Potter is not without their flaws. But with Draco by their side, they’re coming to understand who they are as a person. And Harry knows that who they are is not a flaw. Not even close.
“Right,” Molly said, brightening. “Let’s talk of happier things! You’re getting married tomorrow, right? What will you be wearing?”
It was this flaw that led him to keep tabs on Draco Malfoy during his three years of Auror training. Malfoy had donated his obscene wealth to charity, stayed in a shitty, studio flat during his Potions mastery, and he’d even volunteered at Hogwarts for the rebuild. Overall, Malfoy was not only annoyingly good at Potions but also becoming an annoyingly non-bigoted, not-evil wizard.
“Coming to terms with liking blokes. It should have been obvious, I think I was half in love with Cedric Diggory back then, but how could I have known? It’s not like there were any queer people out at Hogwarts to look up to.”
Draco met his gaze and gave Harry a soft, grateful smile before closing his eyes. He shifted in the bed, moving so their arms just barely brushed together.
a grass snake.” He waves his wand at the snake on the table, who transforms into a gigantic, bright white snake, probably at least twenty feet long. The snake is now taking up the entire room, and honestly, “What the hell is this, Malfoy?”
It felt like hours before they finally made it back to the ship. Someone must have seen them go over, because there was a rescue boat and a crewmate at the water waiting for them.
,” were Kingsley’s exact words) to go to. Usually, at the events, Malfoy stops by Harry’s table to talk to Luna.
He takes Bertha and Apparates out of the clinic. It takes some time for Harry to convince Dave that he left out the back emergency exit.
Grimmauld Place might not have been made for one wizard, or even for one wizard and a shit ton of snakes. But two wizards and a shit ton of snakes? That seems to be the key to happiness.
Harry peeks through the glass window to look at Malfoy’s snake. Sure enough, it looks just like a wild grass snake.
And even gentler, as if she’s going to break him by saying the words, Hermione says, “And now you’ve kissed Malfoy, and you laid in bed for three days refusing to talk to anyone.”
It’s a copious amount of money, though, and Harry gives the leftovers to Dave again after converting to pounds.
, it’ll take you to their main office, and they’ll board you right away. The boat leaves in ten minutes; you’ve got plenty of time.”
Harry comes through Ron and Hermione’s Floo to see Rose running around in her diaper and Ron chasing after her. Harry takes in the scene, scooping Rose up into his arms with a chuckle.
When Harry comes up after leaving the bar that night, they expect to see Draco asleep. That hangover-induced migraine couldn’t have gone away quickly without a potion, and Betsy had spent the entire day lecturing.
Malfoy gnaws at his bottom lip, glancing at his snake in worry. “But, you know snakes, surely it can’t be too different?”
“What?!” Harry stands up, gives her an accusing look, then turns to Ron. “Do you know what she’s talking about?”
Potter bites his lip, and Draco has to look away. “I dare you…” Potter sounds almost nervous. “I dare you to go to the Yule Ball with me.”
“I had a nightmare,” Potter says after a few minutes. “That’s why I’m on the floor. It’s… grounding, no pun intended. I’m sorry for tripping you.”
Draco is shocked into silence for a moment. Harry Potter. Confiding in him. In the absolute dead of the night. “What was your nightmare about?” he tries to keep his voice steady.
Pansy makes a noise of annoyance, then sighs, then gives a small smile. "I've slept with six of the people at this table. Two of them were atrocious. One of them was excellent." The smile turns into a smirk.
"Basically, it's two truths and a lie," Vince explains. "List three facts about yourself, and your group has to guess which one is false and which ones are true. If you're already close friends with someone at your table, try not to ruin it. We want everyone to get a chance to get to know each other better."
Harry turned to Malfoy, who had paled five shades. He looked at Harry with wide eyes, then turned to Molly. “Yes, thank you so much,” he told her, voice sounding strained.
“No more blood purity bullshit,” Malfoy agreed, and he looked serious about it. Harry couldn’t help but smile.
Harry let out a sigh, relieved that Draco sounded calm now. He wrapped the blankets even tighter around them both. “No more boats,” he agreed.
They don’t want Draco to get embarrassed about holding them – Harry likes it. But they know Draco, and Harry knows he’ll get defencive, so they carefully slip out of Draco's arms and start getting ready for the day.
“So dead parents, that’s a no, but my clothes are fair game?” Harry’s mouth twitches up, and Malfoy’s does the same.
“Don’t pay me for this one, please, I should pay you for letting me study him,” Harry tells Draco as he’s leaving. Draco just rolls his eyes and gives Dave a stack of money, telling him to keep the change. Harry wants to argue more, but he knows he won’t win.
He swears and picks himself off the floor, turning around to see what he tripped over. It’s dark, but he can make out curls of black hair and knows immediately that it’s Potter.
“Not really. You’ve both always been hyperfixated on each other. I’m glad you were able to work through your pasts, though, you seem really happy together.”
“Ah, of course Harry proposed.” Molly settled herself down on a couch. “Now, Harry, how’d you do it? Was it romantic?”
After a while, Potter speaks again. “Look, Malfoy, you clearly don’t want to be here. Do you want to just go back to the common room?”
They stopped at shop after shop, checking out clothes and books and jewellery without buying anything. They’d ask his opinion on things every now and then, but seemed comfortable to let him follow along quietly.
Harry gulped, but he couldn’t find it in himself to reject Malfoy’s call for help. After a moment of silently cursing himself in advance for agreeing to this, Harry turned back to the Chief Warlock and nodded. “Yes, that’s correct.”
They miss all their classes that day, and get quite the scolding from McGonagall, and a detention with it, but neither can stop smiling. Not a single person is surprised when they tell the other eighth years they’re dating.
Padma crosses her – their – arms. “Okay, yes, we’re all here, yes, we’re the only three wixen at this event, yes, you two have to do all your activities together, but
“No, I’m having an honest moment here, let me keep going,” Harry interrupts. “I think you should schedule a session with Healer Vincent.”
Ron and Hermione are over for Friday night dinner, helping them come up with a good name for it. Draco suggests ‘The Snake Charmer.’ Harry grins, remembering that’s what Draco first thought his Muggle practice was for. But then Draco gets him a wall hanging with the new name on it, and it’s even more suggestive than the ‘Blown to Slyther-Eens’ one. Harry still puts it in his private office.
“I didn’t know if you were doing that with anyone else or just me,” Draco explains. “I should have asked you. But I figured I’d better be safe, so I only used ‘he.’ In case you didn’t want Patil to know.”
Harry’s expecting Draco to come in on Monday, and he does. He’s got Gertrude wrapped around his shoulders, and he smiles so brightly at Harry that Harry thinks he’s going to just fall apart right there, in the lobby, in front of Dave.
“No, at least not right now,” Harry replies. “I wanted to adopt one, but then I couldn’t choose which one to adopt, so I ended up not adopting any.”
“What about a teacher?” Draco suggests. “Didn’t you teach the Gryffindors how to duel, and all that?”
Harry nods politely, turning back to his speech. It’ll be time soon. Malfoy leans next to Harry’s ear, breath hot against his neck. “See you around, Potter.” And then Malfoy’s headed back to his table, and it’s time for the speech.
Potter looks up at him, baffled. Draco notices the tears drying in his eyes. He does not comment on them.
“God, I think Parkinson and I might actually get along,” Harry laughs, only stopping when their food arrives.
“Never have I ever had sex with a woman,” Parkinson winks. The group lets out a laugh, by now used to her incessant need to turn the games in the sexual direction. A few put their fingers down.
Malfoy still looks indignant, but relents from his defense. His cheeks lighten a bit. “Potter, would you like to get lunch with me this Saturday?”
The rest of the week passes relatively without incident. They wake up in silence, Malfoy Transfigures the bed back to normal, they listen to long lectures and eat in the conference room, Malfoy splits the beds up again and reads, and Harry goes down to the bar. Malfoy wears different versions of the same type of casual button-up shirt and looks incredibly unapproachable at all times. They don’t much talk to each other, but there’s no real animosity. Still, they haven’t had to do any partner activities yet, so Harry’s still a bit wary. He’s made a few friends with the Muggle teachers, but it’s a relief when the weekend comes and the teachers are allowed to visit home.
And it’s Friday. Harry’s considering leaving early himself. “No problem, Dave. Have a good weekend.”
Potter finally makes it back, holding two glasses of pumpkin juice. Draco takes his glass, but doesn’t drink it.
"Um, okay." He thinks for a moment. "I'm a really bad cook. I love treacle tart. And the Sorting Hat almost put me in Slytherin."
your fault, but also they kind of were, and I was hoping for a quiet year. I was hoping to actually be able to enjoy Hogwarts.”
Draco’d never gotten the Dark Mark, which he guessed was why his trial was one of the last. But he didn’t think for a second he’d be getting off free. Not after what he’d done. Been coerced into, sure, but at the time, he’d believed in the cause.
“No, not at all,” Harry replies, puzzled. “I just – I remembered you said you’re interested in men, and…”
Harry drags his Muggle suitcase out of the lift to his room. The door opens with a slide of the key. Malfoy is already in the room, placing clothes into the dresser. He’s in tight Muggle jeans, and his arse… Harry looks away.
Malfoy's jaw drops slightly. So do a few others. "You're as Gryffindor as they come, Potter," says Parkinson. "You must be shitting us."
They’ve been dating for six months when Harry’s new clinic opens. He passed his exams with flying colors, earning his Veterinary Healer certification.
They followed Arthur up the stairs to Ron’s old bedroom, where Gilbertson had already made himself comfortable.
Draco’s hand roams up Harry’s shirt and it’s cold against Harry’s hot skin. He shivers at the contact and presses even harder against Draco.
“Actually decent?” Ron snorts. “Are you in there, Harry? Is that you? Who is this man, and what has he done with my best mate?”
“You know how rich people get,” he says. “Eccentricity, and all that. I’ll be in my office, give me a holler when the first patient arrives.”
Harry had not been aware. But at this point, he didn’t care. Not after Draco nearly drowned. “We’re engaged for real, Gilbertson.” He turned to Arthur. “I’m sorry, Arthur. I know why you don’t believe us. But we’re getting married. Tomorrow. Now, we’ve had a rough day, and could really use some hot showers. See you at the wedding.”
wants to do. Plus, there’s the added bonus that teaching children is highly unlikely to result in a prolonged stay at St Mungo’s. Hearing from McGonagall about the open position had brought him relief for the first time in months, and even having to deal with the bigoted, teenaged version of Malfoy wouldn’t have prevented him from teaching. He can certainly handle adult Malfoy just fine.
Draco closes the distance between them, pushing the plates onto the floor and climbing over the table into Harry’s lap. They don’t make it upstairs.
Draco’s jaw dropped completely open. And then he grinned, and it was the most beautiful thing Harry had ever seen. “You’re serious?”
This Friday’s charity gala benefits children orphaned by the war. Hermione’s written up a speech for Harry, since he’s Britain’s Favorite War Orphan (capitals courtesy of the Daily Prophet, in their pre-gala column).
Molly opened the door slowly, holding a tray in one hand with two plates on it. She didn’t seem to notice how staged their positioning was. “I just thought I’d bring you two breakfast. One day until the wedding! How are you feeling?”
. Your only job here is to be supportive of Harry’s choice in partner. If you could just set aside the prejudice you have against the young man’s father—”
Potter isn’t talking to Draco anymore. Or really, Draco concedes, he’s not fighting with Draco anymore. They never really talked to begin with. Every time he sees Potter he can’t help but spit something out, but Potter’s no longer responding. He’s starting to realize that he…
Every time he feels his stomach tightening when he looks at Potter, he immediately fixates on something else. The window. Granger and Weasley arguing about soup. Longbottom’s toad. Because there’s no chance Potter will ever like him back. Draco thinks back to the night where Potter admitted to liking men, staring Draco right in the eye as he put his finger down. And he immediately needs to look at his shoes. The hardwood floor. His potions textbook. It was just a coincidence, he reminds himself. Potter only looked at him because he was across from him. There’s nothing to it. Draco refuses to think about the kiss.
By the time Harry makes it back to the room, the lights are off, and Malfoy appears to be sleeping. Harry gets ready for bed as quickly and quietly as he can.
Draco snaps back into focus. “No,” he replies evenly. Potter heaves a sigh of relief. They sit in silence again, but this time it’s almost companionable.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy,” the Chief Warlock announced. “For the crimes of Conspiring Against the State, Aiding and Abetting Death Eaters, and the Use of Unforgivable Curses, you have been found guilty. However, this court believes you acted out of necessity, not cruelty. Therefore, the court has decided that you will not be sent to Azkaban. You will instead be exiled from this country. You will be free, but you will be barred from ever entering Britain again.”
It’s Potter’s turn for Truth or Dare, and he picks Draco. Draco’s eyebrows raise; they haven’t picked each other in any of these games since the night of the tripping. The night they started becoming friends.
“Do we have to play their games?” Pansy cuts in. “As long as we’re getting to know each other, couldn’t we do our own games?”
Harry has seen a lot of snakes. Most of his clients are local, London-dwellers with exotic snakes, but he’s had people come in from all over the world. Harry hasn’t been a vet for long but he’s made a bit of a name for himself in the snake community, and he’s proud of it. He’s worked with everything from Malagasy Leaf-Nosed Snakes to Hairy Bush Vipers.
“Gossip with the snakes, is more accurate. They rant about their annoying owners. I rant about their annoying owners. Not that they’re really all annoying, but snakes do like complaining, so it’s rather enjoyable for them, I think. Especially if they’re the only snake living somewhere.”
Draco looks confused and even a little hurt by Harry’s tone. “Just wanted to make sure you were all right.”
Draco picked the restaurant again, a Mexican place in downtown London. Harry ordered enchiladas and they’re brilliant.
“A few Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws, too,” Potter replies. “And not just dueling. I dunno, I guess I enjoyed that. I don’t know if I really like kids, though.”
“Yeah. It was… needed. And it got me interested in race and blood status and sexuality and gender diversity, so I’ve read a fair bit about it at this point. So, er, basically, you’ve got men and women, right?”
Hermione smirks. "Nice to know you think I'm smart, Parkinson. But I do suck at chess. The lie is that I've never left Britain- I've done quite a bit of traveling."
“No, no, I insist. You should have people there who care about you both. Or would you prefer to have it at your family’s manor, so your mother could attend?”
Dave nods, still looking horrified. “Okay, Dr. Potter,” he says, leaving and closing the door behind him.
“I don’t like boys,” Harry retorts, but it doesn’t come out as certain as he’d like. Hermione taps the spot next to her, and Harry sits back down.
Draco laughs, then touches a hand to Harry’s cheek. “Yes, Harry, that’s why I asked you out three weeks ago. To lunch. On a date.”
“When was Stubby Boardman born?” Granger looks around wildly, then shouts. “Does anyone know when Stubby Boardman was born?!”
To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy walked closer towards the rail, taking in the brilliant orange and yellow sunset. “It’s beautiful!” he shouted to Peter.
Someone knocks on their door, and Draco opens it to find the very people he was thinking about. Pansy flounces in and sits next to Greg on his bed, and Granger stands in the doorway holding a clipboard.
Which was quite unfortunate, really, seeing as he had been trying to thank Potter. To apologise for everything. To ask for a fresh start.
“As we promised Healer Vincent,” Granger begins, “we will still be getting to know each other and playing games. The first one for today is called Simon Says. It’s actually a Muggle game-”
Harry tries to tell them how boring Betsy’s lectures are, but Hermione gives him a Look, so he changes the topic back to his friends. Ron’s experimenting with a new line of fireworks, and Hermione’s fighting yet another politician about yet another civil rights issue. They talk long enough that it’s dinnertime, and Kreacher brings more food out for them. Harry’s happy and relaxed, and he’s not looking forward to going back to the retreat tomorrow.
“Draco, dear!” she cried as she bustled towards them. Draco’s eyes widened at the friendliness. “Oh, is Harry keeping you? It’s so lovely to have you here. I hope you don’t mind, I’ve invited the rest of the Weasleys and some family friends over for supper. Everyone wants to congratulate you two on your engagement! And you’ll be married so soon!”
“I have,” Harry replies, unashamed. “I’ve been going since the start of the year. It’s helped loads.”
Draco opened his mouth to ask how they knew he and Potter had agreed to them coming so fast, but Potter shut him up with a hard stare.
Harry quickly pulls back, panicking. Draco's lips were soft and sweet, but he wasn’t kissing Harry back, and
Since it was a Saturday, the Auror’s department was nearly empty save for the weekend shift. Harry went into one of the conference rooms to finish the paperwork. Even though the Aurors sometimes used him on cases, he was still in training, and he didn’t have his own desk yet.
Potter gave a half-laugh. “You’re really not going to let this go, are you? Molly’s rubbed off on you.”
On the pillow, there’s a snake wrapped around a piece of cherry pie. At the bottom, the word ‘Pie-Thon’ is stitched. Harry grins.
He lays in silence for a few minutes, willing his body to sleep, when Malfoy speaks up again. “Does… do any of those gender identities… resonate with you?”
It’s everything Harry wants. Everything they need. Time stops moving as Draco pushes them onto the bed that’s fused itself back together. And then it’s hands, and heat, and heavy breaths.
“Nope, hates me. I solved one of his cases back when I first started training and he’s still bitter about it.”
Draco and it’s warm and it’s hot and it’s soft and it’s hard and Draco can’t help but gasp for air as Potter pulls away.
Harry keeps thinking about the money. It had to be at least a thousand pounds, cash. Dave’s expression was brilliant. And Draco- because giving Harry’s assistant an obscene amount of money for no other reason than that Harry had been doing it had definitely made him Draco now- had let him examine the magical properties of his snake. Harry wants to send a thank you.
Malfoy visits the clinic again the following Monday, and he’s wearing the clothes Harry bought him. Harry stops short, staring in awe. The jeans fit him perfectly, and Harry wonders if he got the size right or if Malfoy did an alteration charm. The green of the shirt makes Malfoy’s pale skin stand out, and good god, no wonder he was sorted in Slytherin, it would be a crime to see him wearing any other color.
After taking furious notes, Harry finishes up the exam and walks Malfoy back up to the lobby. Malfoy stops at Dave’s desk, and to Harry’s surprise, pulls out a hefty wad of Muggle cash. Dave looks mildly alarmed, but lets Malfoy know how much he owes.
Draco goes out to grab them dinner after the opening, and when he comes back he’s holding a bright orange snake and no food. “I found him by the Leaky,” he tells Harry, worried. “Do you think he’s okay?”
It's weird at first, but eventually they seem to collectively give in to the awkwardness, and by the time they're waiting for the next activity, there's actual inter-house conversations. Harry notices that Malfoy isn’t talking to anyone, barely even to his fellow Slytherins. It seems like he’s even taken a break from harassing Harry, at least for the night. They do a miniature obstacle course, they sort themselves by height and birth date, and finally Vince is giving instructions for the final activity.
Harry swallowed, trying to come up with an answer. “We’ve, er… we’ve been keeping it quiet, didn’t want to cause a fuss with Mal— Draco still on trial here.”
“Oh,” Draco replied, trying to come up with a reasonable response. “Er, I’m sure that Harry thinks of you all as family. It certainly seems like it.”
Draco gave Potter a quick panicked glance, and he seemed just as uneasy, but Potter nodded. “Sure, Molly, that’s fine.”
Harry’s jaw dropped open. He turned to look at Malfoy again, whose face was still. But Malfoy’s eyes were pleading with Harry. Eyes that once stared into a bathroom mirror, devoid of hope; eyes that had begged Harry to save him as a fiery inferno raged around them; eyes that now shone with desperation for Harry to go along with this.
“Yeah. I was going to a Mind Healer, and she thought it could potentially get better, but I didn’t want to have to deal with… facing that. Eventually realised I’d become an Auror because I thought I should, not necessarily because I really wanted to be one.”
Harry clears his throat again. He can’t quite find it in himself to regret talking about this with Malfoy. He knows Malfoy isn't an arsehole anymore, but he hadn’t realised Malfoy’d become decent these past few years. And then he surprises himself by actually answering the question. “Yes. Maybe.”
Malfoy comes in the next week too, and makes another appointment with Dave for ‘right now.’ He brings in Dorothy, a Canadian Rain Cobra. There’s nothing wrong with Dorothy.
Chief Warlock Grimsworth frowned, but nodded to the court scribe. “Very well. Mr Potter, you are dismissed. Mr Malfoy, you will be released today. Once we have investigated and verified the legitimacy of your partnership with Mr Potter, and you’ve been legally married, you will be permitted to remain in the country permanently. For now, you will be free to stay in Britain, but your investigation by one of our senior Aurors will begin as soon as you leave the Ministry today.” He flicked his wand, and the chains around Malfoy’s hands and feet dropped to the ground.
And then Potter pulled back, not meeting Draco’s eyes, and turned towards the crowded room. “And there you go. Molly, should we bring out dessert?”
After he closes up for the day, Harry stops by a Muggle department store on the way home. He tries to guess what size Malfoy’d be in jeans, then buys some ripped ones. In a spark of inspiration, he goes over to the t-shirt section. He finds a green t-shirt with a snake on it, hiding in flowers. When he gets home he wraps up the shirt and jeans to Owl to Malfoy.
“And, I had a panic attack in the middle of a wand fight. Almost died. Our targets got away. I tried another mission after I got out of St Mungo’s, same thing.”
The pairs ahead of Malfoy and Harry go, running to the obstacles and carefully stepping over and around them. Harry feels awkward with his leg against Malfoy’s, and he knows it’s only going to get worse once they have to coordinate around the course.
Malfoy sticks his nose up. “I’d like to think my sensibilities have matured slightly since my school years.”
A tall, gangly wizard in dark blue robes takes this as an invitation to stand, and McGonagall politely bows her head at him and allows him to speak. He looks to be barely older than the eighth years, but Draco knows he must have gone through the five years of healer training, at the very least.
“Can I help you?” Harry inquires politely. He’s nothing if not a professional, even if he’s napping. The blond man turns around and Harry immediately loses his composure. “
Harry smiled at him. “Things changed on the boat. And you can imagine how upset I was when I found your note this morning and realized that the person I was falling for, was going to leave the country. So, marry me, Draco. Because I’d like to date you.”
“They got stung, of course,” Ron replies, grabbing another scoop of potatoes. “Everyone was fine, they had a Healer with them as a local guide, but Charlie says it hurt like a bitch.”
“Look, I got them to agree on something! And you said it couldn’t be done.” Golstein is grinning, and Draco’s remembering the fight they had before entering the common room. Just a bet is all. Draco heaves a sigh of relief. They won’t actually make Potter kiss him.
The knot moves to Harry’s throat. Do any of those gender identities resonate with him? No, he’s a man. He’s a man.
“Yeah, well, you asked. So yeah, after I resigned, I got a letter from McGonagall about the Defence professorship,” Harry finishes. “Why are you becoming a teacher, then?”
“Well, I’m sure you’ll want to visit your mother. But every year, we have a nice dinner with just the family — Arthur and I, and the kids and their partners. Harry’s always invited, and of course you are too now, you’re part of the family! Isn’t that right, Ginny?”
He hadn’t expected Potter to show up at his trial, too. To speak for him so strongly. And now, on verdict day, the Wizengamot looked almost conflicted about what to do with him.
Harry shows Malfoy where the skin is, so he can keep an eye on it. “If it’s not gone in the next few days, let me know.”
The opening goes smoothly. It looks like he’ll have a lot more clients than he was expecting. He’ll split his time between the offices, he thinks, and hire another assistant for The Snake Charmer.
Harry entered the courtroom slowly, not wanting to interrupt. But everyone was quiet, staring at him as he entered. Malfoy was sitting in the solitary chair in the middle of the courtroom, just as put-together as last week in his fancy dress robes, but his expression looked slightly pained.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Glad we’ve got that cleared up. Anything else you’d like to discuss? Didn’t know you were a heart-to-heart at midnight kind of guy, but I’m glad you let me know.”
“Yeah, well, don’t be. I woke up with my head on a stranger’s shoulder. A bit awkward, to say the least.”
“Molly was talking to me about her friend who got us the tickets,” Malfoy snapped. “Potter, listen to me. I’m only going to say this once.
Harry’s gut lurched at Malfoy’s grin, but he laughed. “Not bad, Malfoy. What are you up to these days? Are you studying to become a barrister, or something? Not many people would know those random laws off the top of their head.”
Parkinson's eyes widen in surprise, but she doesn't retort. Hannah goes next, then Ernie, then Blaise Zabini, and then it's Harry's turn.
snake he’s ever seen, he did fight a basilisk after all, but. Well. If he had known the grass snake was going to turn into
“The war,” Potter answers, glancing at Draco. “I was in the Forbidden Forest, but this time I died for good. And I saw Voldemort kill everyone I love.”
,” Harry says firmly after their waiter comes over to check on them and gives them an odd look. “I didn’t really know what to do, so Hermione made a list of things I’m good at. Parseltongue was on there, and I just kind of thought. Why not?”
Normally, Harry sends his patients back to the waiting room while he completes the examinations, but really only because of the Parseltongue. Malfoy’s a wizard though, plus he already knows Harry’s a Parselmouth, so Harry figures it won’t hurt to let him stay for the exam.
“Alright, now you’re going to be answering questions. Your answers must be one line, with no context given.” Betsy picks up the microphone and heads down to the floor. “First question: why are you a teacher?”
Draco zones out as they continue bickering. Potter’s laughing at them, but keeps glancing at Draco, as if to gauge his reaction. Draco ignores Potter and watches as people walk by, half dancing as they head to the drinks table. After what seems like hours but is probably only a few songs later, Granger and Weasley head back to the dance floor.
“That’s… fascinating.” And it is. Harry’s starting to want to… learn more about magical snakes. Do research, maybe. He’s not sure, but the more magical snakes Malfoy brings in, the more Harry wants to know.
Gasps resound from around the room as he falls directly on top of Malfoy. Harry’s knee twinges, but he’s more concerned for Malfoy – Harry’s not light, and his fall is hard. He pushes himself up enough to look at Malfoy’s face, hoping this isn’t what breaks McGonagall’s rule of not hurting each other.
Malfoy thanks Harry profusely. “Er, sure, no problem, Malfoy,” Harry gets out. “Let me know if you have any more, uh, snake problems.”
And for some reason, that put a lump in Draco’s throat. “That’s — that’s very kind of you, thank you. I’m sure we’d love to visit.”
Padma orders them a round of tequila shots, which quickly turns into two rounds, then four, and Harry loses count.
Vince sweeps by them, stopping to say hello. "Eighth years are at the back," he says. "Didn't think it made sense to split you guys up into smaller groups, since there's only about 15 of you. Enjoy the social!"
Molly was grinning, and Harry smiled back. “That sounds great, Molly. That’s so sweet of you to think of us, isn’t it, Draco?”
“Oh, that’s a very kind offer, but I think I’m all set, thanks.” Draco gave his best attempt at a friendly smile. It wasn’t that he disliked Molly, she seemed kind enough and had even defended him last night. But she also seemed like… like she had a lot of energy. Too much energy for him to deal with. And walking through town with her and Potter’s ex was not his idea of fun.
"Got it in one!" Pansy shouts. Then, she lowers her voice. "Four of them were atrocious." And then she
“It probably helps that I get to see you geek out over my snakes,” Draco smirks. “They probably just don’t realize how much it means to you.”
Oh, sure, years one through seven had Voldemort, but they didn’t have forced social interactions. And, he guesses, the other years did have Malfoy, but not like Malfoy is now. He’s not the snarky kid who bullied Harry in the corridors. He’s not the depressed, quiet Malfoy from sixth year. He’s somehow… both. Malfoy is irritable, and he snaps at Harry every chance he gets, while still looking like a lost puppy. And the worst part is, he can’t say anything to Ron or Hermione, because he already did. (
Thursday’s morning icebreaker activity has the teachers paired in threes. To Harry’s surprise, Padma comes over to join them.
, can you believe it? He’s not performing tonight but he stopped by to visit McGonagall and he must be over a hundred years old-”
“Okay, I know you’re not drunk from three beers, so what’s going on?” Draco asks as soon as the door shuts behind him.
He’s wary of falling into Malfoy’s arms. Not even for lack of trusting him, he’s sure Malfoy wouldn’t try to drop him, but Malfoy’s, well, skinny. Potentially too skinny to not get knocked over by Harry’s bulky, Auror-trained body.
Draco clears his throat. “For everything, I mean. For being a dick to you all those years. For being… a Death Eater. There’s no excuse, I know, and you don’t need to forgive me, I just… I did what I thought was right. Which I now know was the exact opposite of right.”
Hermione quirks her lip. “We’re fine, Harry. Nothing as exciting as teacher training to keep us entertained.”
, and cared for each other. Harry was safe, and home, and he even forgot about Gilbertson until he spoke.
“Oh, his father? His father is in Azkaban, Molly, and for good reason. That’s not prejudice, that’s being rational.”
Harry’s too drunk to second guess themself. Taking their shoes off, Harry slips into the sheets. “Padma doesn’t have to deal with this.”
