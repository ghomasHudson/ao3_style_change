Draco fell asleep that night with his fingers gripped in between Harry's, and the night sparkling beyond their gray, empty ceiling.
Draco's fingers twitched vaguely, desperate to touch and pull closer.
Draco whirled around once he reached the desk Harry and he shared with the case files stacked up on it under a haphazard pile of
were linked. What did he not understand about that?" Draco placed the voice as Wilson's. Fair man, coming to Draco's deathbed, although apparently it was to shout about Draco's incompetency.
"Hm," said Harry. "Do you need a day to yourself, or would you like some company today?"
“She suggested it,” Draco said. He smiled slightly. “I don't believe I said one way or the other if I was interested.”
Harry's mouth dropped open as he followed Draco out. "
Draco sighs and winds the rest of his fingers through Harry’s. “Oh, Harry.”
in school, but he’d never actually read the book. His stance on the paper was to analyze a notorious story from an outsider’s perspective. The truth was that Draco hadn’t had the time to read the book before the assignment was due. The professor had told him, privately, that his argument was excellent, but he hadn’t fulfilled the prompt. Draco didn’t mind the slight dip in his grades; the compliment from the professor was reward enough.
Draco cried and blamed it on the pregnancy hormones.
Daisy hummed along as she pulled off Draco’s current shirt and traded it for one of the new ones. Draco was surprised to find it soft and loose, but oddly comfortable. He was right about the collar; the shirt dipped down to show his collarbones if he didn’t button it up all the way. Daisy tutted when he tried to do up all the buttons, and said:
“You don't even like coffee,” Harry said.
Harry sets a hand on his back and lets Draco rock back and forth. He hushes into his ear, but he knows Draco isn’t going to consoled, and it’s probably best to let him get this all out of his system. He’s scared, and shaken, as well as anyone would be, and Harry telling him to calm down isn’t going to do any good. So he rubs Draco’s back and tells him that he loves him.
Harry crawled up the bed and curled in next to Draco, his face pressing into the side of Draco's neck, one of his hands resting over Draco's stomach. Harry didn't waste any time. "The curse works itself slowly through your body, shutting down one function at a time until you're dead." Harry's hand tightened over the slight dips and curves of Draco's belly.
But there was something about the mountains.
“Archie?”
Of course, he does not say this to Draco.
“And now,” Harry went on. “You’re okay again, by some crazy miracle, and you still don't notice. You’re going on as if nothing’s happened.”
Harry placed his right hand on Draco’s jaw and pulled him up and forward until he was kissing Harry, wet with tears, sweet like candy, and undeniably, inexplicably perfect.
Draco talks when they hug, talks when they hold hands, when they’re wrapped together on the couch with a book in Draco’s hands and the telly on in the corner. Draco talks while he reads, cooks, knits, kisses, listens to the radio.
"Well," repeated Harry.
Draco looked up from his books, stuck his finger between the pages to mark his place, and then set it down on his lap. "Told anyone about what?"
"Yes," Draco said, and smiled at him. "But I promise I'll bring cut ones next time, so we don't have to conjure any."
And then Harry does understand. Draco has been hearing him all along, even against the tiding shouts of the waves, the begging whispers of the wind, the imagined leap over the crags and cliffs.
test in his hands.
“Yeah.”
There’s silence between them on the line. Draco drops his head down onto the wall and stays there, silent and alone in his apartment. He can’t bear to speak because when he does, he will know it will be over a speaker, and that there will be a second in delay before Harry hears his voice, and that the words will be accompanied by nothing but the static of the signal. He will not rest his hand over Harry’s knee, or drop his head down on his shoulder, or pull Harry’s face close to his own.
He turns and lets the thing between him and Draco tear violently as he walks away, back down the mountain. He deserves the pain.
It's a complicated question. He's here because America sounded better than Scotland, and because Draco seemed easier than the therapist Hermione wanted him to see. And also because Harry was lonely, and Draco is a warm body and a never ending stream of words. They never talk about love.
“Me too,” Draco said.
Harry squeezed Draco's hip and then turned to Mrs. Weasley with a broad grin. "Hullo, Mrs. Weasley. You look lovely tonight."
Harry looks over to one of his students, a slight teenage girl with her hair tied up into three ponytails. “Yes, Miss Wimblefon?”
Harry kicked off his boots and sat down in front of the armchair. He leaned his head against Draco's calf. "Yes, I'm glad I did it."
Harry brushed a hand over the top of Draco's head. "Darling, I really think he'd like to see us both this week."
“Apparently you were the closest to figuring it out.”
Things. Things Draco focuses on.
Draco shook his head wildly between Harry's palms.
Draco wondered if the sender knew what purple lilacs and hyacinths meant. Draco most certainly did.
"Do you think he will?" Harry asked.
Draco pulled his feet out from under him and turned himself around on the couch to face Harry. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and held him tight, hooking his chin over his shoulder, and pulling him close enough to feel the jut of his collarbones against his own. They fell back on the couch, twined together, and lay there, hugging, until the sky went dark and Harry dozed off.
"Stop it right now. I don't need apologies," she says. "I'm just glad he's okay."
Draco unfolded the letter and skimmed over the contents. Another inquiry on the Mortem case. Draco tossed the letter onto his desk and rested his head back. The headache was becoming almost unbearable, and he didn't have the bandwidth to deal with another case breach. It was all the ridiculous interns, trying to brag about their workload, and it was screwing up the Unspeakables' investigation plans. Every time they got close to finding an information leak, another intern would spill the latest news of their
Draco’s fingers twisted in the grasses underneath him. There was no point denying it. Even Draco was aware that his avoidance had been obvious. “Yes.”
Scorpius sighed and dug his fingernails into the dirt. Draco ran a hand lightly over the top of his head, letting his white blonde curls skim back with the movement and the slight breeze.
Harry looked down, at Draco's lap. Draco looked down too. There was nothing particularly interesting. Just the coarse gray threads of the standard issue Mungo's blanket, and Draco's hand, braceleted by a charmed ring that displayed Draco's vitals.
Harry watches him for a long moment from the doorway. The fall of his hair over his eyes, the curl of his fingers into his palm, the sway of his back. Something tight is still clenched up in his stomach. He could have lost Draco tonight. Easily. Just from pure bad luck.
Draco is so warm, so soft. Nice. A weight tethering him to the ground, to sanity.
Harry laughs. “Don’t you dare, Draco. Her mother will tear down the school.”
"Draco," Harry said. Draco almost lifted his head at the twinge in Harry's voice, but it was so hard to do so because his neck really was too sore to make any movement. "Draco," Harry said again, blind panic clear in his voice. "You're hot. Really hot."
Harry pulled back. "Are you okay?"
“It can act as a protective charm, if in dire circumstances,” Harry says. “A bubble of defense, if the two are physically close.”
"Okay, fine," Harry said. "I think the name Malfoy is stupid. But it's yours. I want something of you in my name."
When they left, both Hermione and Ronald hugged Draco close, which Draco found as odd.
Harry looked as if he regretted saying anything as soon as the words left his mouth. He clapped his hands over his mouth and whirled around so his shoulder blades glared at Draco.
“I rather thought the book was excellent.”
Despite the heat, the lemon trove was as wonderful as the first time Draco had come. The fruits hung from the trees, and glinted cheerfully in dappled sunlight when Draco skimmed his hands over the leaves, careful to avoid the vicious thorns protruding from the branches. He pulled them off as he went, stuffing them into his pockets, and then trying to hold too many in his hands when the seams of his trousers started to pop from holding one too many lemons.
“Oh!” Kit said suddenly, sitting up in her chair. “I nearly forgot.” She dug a hand into her pocket and pulled out a slightly rumpled envelope. Draco didn’t need Kit’s next words to know what it was. “Your father sent a letter.”
"Well," Draco said. "Bailey is old. He was head of the DMLE before the man who came before Robards. No one really knows anything about him except for the fact that he's qualified enough to fill in for six months." Draco sighed and twisted his wrist to set his case files in a new order through the air. "And because he's filling in for Robards, he really doesn't have to do anything except oversee that all the case paperwork gets filed, so一oh!"
Daisy jabbed a pin through the sleeve dangling a little loose around his wrist before turning her attention to what he was holding up. “Oh! Every young gentleman and lady needs a nice bag to carry their things.”
Draco dropped his things by the door and moved through to the kitchen. Harry looked back over at his shoulder and grinned at Draco before turning back to stir something on the stove. Draco came to stand behind him and pressed in close, setting his chin down on Harry’s shoulder and pressing his palms into Harry’s stomach.
"Yes, quite ridiculous, I know," Wilson said. "But the point is that Mortem was the name of the ring."
His face was all red and pinched, the color in his face dimly visible through the gray light behind the clouds. Harry thought he looked nice, but would never say so. Aside from it being unprofessional, Harry had no desire to be punched in the stomach on this particular night.
The lines around Harry's face had spread from the corners of his mouth to his eyes, in between his eyebrows, his forehead. Draco wanted to press his fingers into all their creases and smooth them away. Instead, he let Harry tug him close, push down the collar of his sweater with his chin, and bite teeth and mouth into Draco's flesh.
Harry nods. He's heard nice things about Oregon.
“Tu me manques,” Draco whispers. His courage fades away as quickly as it came. “You are missing from me.”
“Like I’m stabbing you repeatedly with a blunt knife.” Draco smiles a little. “I’m not leaving. I don’t think you’re wrong.” His thumb rubs the back of Harry’s hand, like a soft breeze soothing down the waves of the twisting rivers of Harry’s blood thundering through his veins. “I’m here. Right here.”
"I thought so," Draco said eventually, and held his hand out to catch the last of the rain.
Harry's breath brushed Draco's collarbone. "You will," Harry said, wrapping his arm around Draco's waist and spreading his palm over his hip. "We'll still have to change her name at court."
Harry swallowed hard and held his hand out in return. “Where’s mine?” he choked out.
When the ocean roars, Draco sings. His voice is lost to the waves and the wind, but his mouth is clear and his hair tangled around his ears.
Jane turns and takes off running up to the castle.
Draco stared at Harry hard. "Harry. We've been together for ten years. I've been in love with you for almost double that amount of time. There should be no doubt that I would've told you. Of course一of
I have no idea if this story is cohesive at all because of how I’m writing in increments, but I hope you like it!
"Me too," Harry says, feeling it so much in that moment. That tightness and the exhale of knowing Draco's safe in the next room all at once.
Her eyes pass over Draco. “Professor Potter, I have more questions for you.”
They waited.
Draco throws an elbow in Harry’s direction and raises both his eyebrows in question.
Inside their apartment, Harry walked into their bedroom while Draco followed close behind him and pulled open his sock drawer.
One moment he was standing in the kitchen, listening to the pour of tea into his favorite mug, basking in the quiet sounds of the kitchen clinking around him, and the next, everything went mute in one, silent, terrifying, fell swoop.
He sits down, drawing Draco down with him, until they're curled up together in the water with bubbles foaming up around them.
“I wasn’t being judgemental,” Harry said. His words came fast, honest and without filter. He caught wind of Draco’s expression, and said, “I really wasn’t.” Harry glared down at the dirt caked into his fingers. “I was surprised, but I wasn’t judging you.”
Harry left the room briefly before returning, Draco’s wand held out in his hand.
Harry swallows. This is the part of the conversation he’d been worried about. Not because he thinks Draco will judge him, or shun him, or think he’s weird, but because it isn’t what Draco wants. Draco wants this, and he likely wants it with Harry, and Harry doesn’t want it, so where does that leave him?
"The ocean drowns it out," Draco says, before rolling over and falling asleep.
"I think he believes that if he purifies himself, using the magic cores of the young witches, then he will be absolved of everything he did to get them there. Their purity will grant him the title of一the report says "Jesus." What is that?" Wilson pulled one of the paper's held up by Draco's magic a little closer.
“Okay,” Harry says. He lets go of Draco and takes hold of his hand. “Did you talk to the police?”
"Draco."
It was the first fight they'd had since they were twenty-two.
Draco looked at him. "Yes?"
Draco’s face turned red, and he was grinning, and there were tears coming down his cheeks, and he kept saying, “Harry, Harry. A baby. We’re having a baby. Harry, love, a baby!”
Draco narrowed his eyes. Thought about yelling at Harry and cursing him out. Decided he was tired. Then relaxed his face and held his arms out. In the end, Draco could forgive Harry for this one very large thing that, in the end, likely wouldn't matter very much. They had worked through worse.
"Just stay," Draco whispered. He reached down between them and found Harry's hand, intertwining their fingers and holding on tightly. "Stay with me. Hold the baby. Kiss me like you don't mind that I'm still fat even though the baby is out of me."
Harry pushes his chair back slightly. “It’s an irreversible connection with the person who loves you most in the world. It links you together. So, theoretically, if one half of the pairing was hurt, the other would know it. If something good has happened to one, the other feels their happiness.”
"Mortem," Draco said.
He nodded to the woman behind the guest counter. Her hair looked nicer today. He kissed Harry on the cheek before they got off on their different floors on the elevator.
Draco poured the sauce over a bowl of drained spaghetti noodles before dishing two servings and setting them down on their table. He pointed at Harry’s robes slung over the back of a chair accusingly.
Kudos and comments are much appreciated xo
I've been binging Gilmore Girls, and this is stupid, but I couldn't stop thinking about what it must be like to have to go to the hospital and give birth all by yourself, and yeah. This was created. I didn't put much time into it, but I hope you enjoy it all the same.
Harry nodded and hesitated before taking the parchment back from Draco and writing something else down. Draco pulled it towards him.
“Forget dim,” Draco says, looking out over the chaos. “This generation is entirely brain dead.”
They spent every minute together. Cavorting all over London, making and eating dinner, having sex, buying odd trinkets from second hand stores, taking baths, spinning around the living room with Harry holding up Draco's weight. Everything they could think of, and everything they couldn't.
“I don’t like it.”
"Right. Blaise or Pansy?"
"Thank
“Hello, Miss Wimblefon,” Draco says coolly. “May I ask you what you’re doing out of bed at this hour?”
In any case, Draco would rather not interact with Harry Potter considering his conflicted emotions and the strung up tension between them.
“Yes,” Harry says. “Everyone’s okay. It’s going to be okay, darling. Just breathe.”
Harry groans and rolls over on the bed. “How did you know?”
“Yes.” Draco wrapped his arms tight around Harry’s waist and pulled himself closer to Harry’s side. “To teach. Won’t McGonagall want you back?”
“Of course.”
Draco wouldn't have noticed it at all if it weren't for Harry.
Draco stopped walking and looked back at Harry. "Yes? Are you alright?"
Harry sent a letter to McGonagall, telling her that he needed a leave for the next two months. Perhaps McGonagall already knew about Draco because she didn't ask, simply granted Harry's request and wished him well until his return.
Harry doesn't know if Draco is the same. If he digs into the past while in the cheap hotel in the shower, if he digs his nails into his palms when Harry does something that reminds him of Hogwarts. He thinks Draco doesn't because Draco always seems to be smiling up into the bright sun and out at brown fields of nothing. Draco never seems to notice the tightness of Harry's jaw. Not when they're driving over the foothills outside of Boulder, or when they're clambering over a minefield of rocks at South Mesa Trailhead. Not even when they're sitting together at Proto's Pizza, and they have to look in each other's eyes as they talk.
“Earl grey?”
"Harry," Draco said softly. "Stop doing that."
Harry noticed when Draco choked on it, and looked at him questioningly. Draco shook his head and smiled. Coughed a little, and tried to indicate that it had gone down the wrong tube. Harry kept staring at him with concern etched into lines by his mouth that Draco hadn't ever noticed before. Draco took a large gulp of the wine and swallowed it smoothly to ease the expression on Harry's face. Finally, Harry looked away. Draco didn't see his mouth move much for the rest of the dinner.
But then the symptoms began to come on slowly, almost without notice. First it was the numbness in his toes that Harry couldn't rub away, and then his inability to feel hunger. Losing his ability to feel his eyelashes brushing across his cheek, and then the weird pinching in his rib cage that eventually faded away.
"What letters?" Ah, the voice Draco wanted.
Draco’s eyes flicked from the test in Harry’s hands to his eyes, back to the test, up to his face. “Are you-” he choked. “Did you-”
It didn't seem fair.
Draco shook his head and his cheek and hair mashed into the pillow. Not that it mattered much to Draco's appearance at this point. "I... we're nineteen."
Harry said, "Right," and then walked on, letting go of Draco's hand and walking right past him and on to his parent's graves.
"No, we shouldn't."
"Just a moment," he whispered, hoarse. "I'm..."
Jane sighs and kicks her loafers on the floor. “It sounds fine, but not worth the magic.”
"I got your owl when we were flying over Versailles." Harry shoved his hands up through his hair and stopped about a foot away from the end of Draco's bed. "I turned around right away. I thought I would make it in time. I thought - I thought labors took longer. Oh god, I'm so sorry. I wanted to be here. I wanted to be here so badly." Harry shook his hands out of his hair and shifted his weight from foot to foot. "Are you alright? Is the baby okay? Is it a boy or girl?"
Harry carefully wrapped his arms around Draco's shoulders. "No."
“What?”
Harry laughs and lets his weight merge into Draco’s. “There’s no rush, love.”
was the best he could do.
Jane giggles. “I’m in love. Can I give it a try?”
he signed over and over.
Harry drops his head into his hands and Draco rolls his eyes. Headmistress McGonagall stands up briskly and walks right out of the Great Hall. Hagrid bursts out laughing before knocking over the entire front table, and Professor Flitwick along with it.
That was partly true. There was Draco’s books, and his oddness, and his father to think about.
Draco didn't know what to do after that, so he hugged Hermione and Ronald back, and took Harry's hand to apparate them home.
When they went to bed, Harry cried again, hugging Draco hard in the shower, as he got his pajamas on, under the sheets. Draco stared straight ahead and thought of what it would be like after he was dead, when Harry would be alone. They were only thirty-three. Harry would grieve, but then he'd get over Draco. He'd fall in love with someone else, get married to them, have kids with them. He would do those things with someone who was not Draco. Draco had always thought they'd get to those things eventually. The family car and the babies and the whole being parents thing. But now it would be with someone else. And Draco knew, that as sick as he felt about it now, that's what he would want for Harry.
“Well,” Draco said, rubbing his forehead with the heel of his hand. “Yes. I won’t go into the details, but it can be fairly said that I didn’t have much of a choice.”
"What? Why not?"
"Oh god, I missed it."
Jane finally looks at him. “Professor Potter?”
Draco looked back down at Molly and her puckered lips, her pink cheeks, the tangle of Harry's curls over her ears. "Molly Malfoy-Potter."
Harry stepped out of the tub and stormed out of the bathroom, leaving a sopping trail of dripped water behind him.
Harry shrugged and threw his cloak over the back of the couch. "It doesn't make me happy."
"I wouldn't blame you," Harry said.
"I like the storms."
Harry took a sip from the mug of tea and then held it up to Draco's mouth to taste. Draco did not taste, but he drank.
In the end, it turns out to be the fault of a malfunctioning light. The girl has insurance, Draco has insurance. No one is hurt. Draco gets a little bandage over his eyebrow, but doesn’t need stitches. Harry is so relieved he could cry.
Draco looked up from his desk to see Wilson standing in the doorway of his office with his arms folded over his chest and his eyebrows drawn up in the middle.
Harry began to move towards him, and Draco backed up desperately. Harry didn't stop, just kept coming forward until he was crowding Draco up against the fridge. He placed his hands on Draco's face, cradling his cheeks and leaning his face in close. Draco thought he must be shouting.
"I'm not spending the night in a hotel."
he mouthed. He thought he might be speaking aloud, but he wasn't sure. Harry's mouth was still moving, so Draco tried again.
"Darling, I really don't want you to miss out一"
“Fine.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed and he turned his head back to rest on his folded knees. “What is it?”
“Breathe, Draco,” Harry says. “I’m almost there.”
“I am.”
Draco noted absently that her left front tooth was slightly crooked, and that her smile turned up her eyes far too much to be considered attractive. He had never seen a more beautiful person before, he didn’t think. Friendship forged love, he thought, and barely hated himself for being cliche. Draco looked away and folded his hands in his lap. He wouldn’t say these things to her, but there were other ways to show someone how you appreciated them.
It came around eleven, right along with the lunch post.
Harry didn’t need Draco’s directions to the intersection. He would’ve been able to find Draco by the convergence of flashing lights and ambulances, the glass and plastic and metal shattered across four lanes of black tar. Harry yanks his car to the side of the road and skids to a stop, already half out of the car.
When Draco signed for water before bed, Harry grinned blindingly and tackled him into the sheets. Draco couldn't hear, or taste, or smell Harry, but he could see his smile, brilliant and wide under him for hours after.
"Say something," Harry said. His eyes were red, and the circles under his eyes looked deeper from where Draco was lying.
With her gone, Draco took the time to run his fingers over all the clothes again, rubbing the material between his fingers and refolding all the shirts. He wouldn’t admit it to anyone, but he liked these clothes a significant amount. Apart from being practical, they held a certain casual fashion that Draco rather fancied.
"Well," Draco said because he was not sure what else there was to be said.
Draco couldn't respond for a long time. There was so many things he wanted to say.
A warm mouth pressed in at the back of Draco's neck. Breath fluttered over the hair at the nape of Draco's neck, but he didn't hear the words that came along with it.
"Catch the last bit," Harry said, holding his hand out further. "The sky is crying."
Not the voice Draco had been desperately wishing for for weeks, but a friendly voice all the same.
Draco tried to put his robes on and go to work, but Harry held on to his arm and begged Draco to stay home until Draco finally relinquished and let Harry lay him down on the couch.
and loped out to the front porch. As soon as he’d settled into one of the rocking chairs, it occurred to him that Harry would be able to approach him very easily from here, so he got up, and moved to the next place. The lemon trove seemed too far a trek for today, so Draco went back inside the house and up to his rooms.
Draco pressed his fingers into his temples. It was all very exhausting to think about. All of Lucius’ letters seemed to have this effect on him. Draco folded the parchment up and tucked it back into the envelope before tossing it onto a side table.
"Have you told anyone?"
Draco hummed. “It might ring a bell.”
“Draco,” Harry whispered. He still couldn’t speak, could hardly breathe. He was just standing and staring, frozen and bewildered.
The Healer came, and the baby came. Painfully, slowly. Draco screamed, and cried, and tried to ignore the fact that he was nineteen and giving birth to a baby all by himself in a dingy room in St. Mungo's.
He would tell her more about it some other time. As Draco had learned from experience, trying to absorb it all at once jumbled up the colors and meanings in one’s brain to the point that they were indecipherable. It was better to focus on one flower at a time. Lemons were the best place to start, the most delightful and intriguing. Draco still had no plans to tell Kit of the lemon trove on the estate, whether or not she was already aware of it.
"We should get married," Draco rasped.
"Malfoy?"
Jane Wimblefon tells the entire school that Professor Harry Potter and Professor Draco Potter are married at breakfast the next day.
It felt nice. The weight of Harry's body over his, moving around him and lifting Draco's legs, then bending his knees, rubbing his hands down his arms, all with gentle, watchful care. Draco smiled, dizzy and saccharine. Smiled, and smiled, and smiled. When Harry nudged his thighs further apart and pressed inside, Draco's mouth fell open in a small noiseless gasp, and Harry nestled his head into the bend of Draco's shoulder.
He rolled to face Harry and leaned into him without pause. This part was easy, had always been easy. The slip and glide of their mouths, the roll of their limbs, the tumbling into each other.
Harry twists and rolls over to face Draco, his face smiling and bright. “You know,” Harry says, touching their noses together. “I think you may be right.”
Draco shakes his head and shoves his face into Harry’s neck. Harry presses his hands over Draco’s back, down his sides, the back of his head. There's a relief in this, in feeling Draco's body alive against his. And a fear, that he's not seeing something - that something is still wrong.
Harry nodded; he couldn’t think of anything else to do. The only thing filling his head was the notion that there was a very small someone inside him at this very moment, and someday that thing was going to come out, and he and Draco would be taking care of a person. A very small person with very big feelings. He nodded to Draco, who had pressed his face into the side of Harry’s and was still crying.
Draco looked to Harry, who was staring straight ahead and now holding onto Draco with both of his hands. Harry's face was thin and wan, and his eyes glassed over.
Woohoo! I decided to add another part!
Just as Draco was leaving the library, a body stepped in front of him. Draco instantly knew it to be Harry’s without looking up. Kit and Daisy didn’t have his height, and Roy never withdrew from his cooking.
Wilson nodded and moved his weight to lean on the other side of the door frame.
Draco groaned. "Ow. No! I already said. Look around! There's no one here for me, and no one's coming."
Harry shakes his head. “I thought I did once. But I just....”
"You haven't been in to work for almost two months now," Wilson said, avoiding Draco's eyes by looking around at the walls, the floor, the bookcase. "Harry keeps coming in to get your work. Nice bloke, 'course. But I wanted to make sure everything was okay with you."
“So why were you judgemental when I spoke to you about the meaning of flowers?” Draco held his breath, and waited. Waited for Harry to stumble and let loose a nonsensical answer that Draco would have to comply with, whether or not it excused his behavior.
“There’s people here,” Draco says, panic running rampant in his voice. “A woman. She helped me out of the car.”
"It's Sunday," Harry mumbled, slightly behind him.
"Harry," Draco said, coming to stand beside him and closing the gate behind himself.
Harry stands there, Draco's hands on his hips, and waits. He does not understand. Does not understand what Draco wants, or why he is speaking to Harry in this way.
Draco nods desperately, his breathing still going hard, and tears streaming down his face. “I hit somebody,” he croaks.
"And then what?" Draco asked.
“Because she’s the exact same with me,” Draco sighs. “Always playing with that bloody hair of hers.”
The Healer held a sympathetic hand out for Draco to take, but neither Harry nor Draco moved toward it. The Healer dropped it, and began to write in the air again.
“It’s class time now,” Jane says.
Harry’s face relaxed around the edges, and his eyes flicked between Draco’s, too close to look at both at once. “You’re not?” His voice was soft. Sweet and vulnerable.
"Too soon," said Harry.
Harry follows, at a walk, until he sees pale white shoulders framed against the silhouette of crashing waves and dim moonlight. He touches his fingertips to Draco's spine and whispers that he hears him, if no one else can or will.
Draco set his hand over Harry's on the fence and twined their fingers together. "Come along," he said gently, and took Harry by the hand to lead him forward into the street.
"And also," Harry said, his voice quieter. "I would like to tell Ron. I will completely understand if you refuse, but I need someone to talk to about this."
Just then, Harry’s head lifted from where it had been downturned over a bed of struggling daffodils. Draco threw himself back into his rooms, nearly ripping the curtains off the rod in the process. He tumbled over the lip that marked the entrance to the balcony and fell face first onto the polished floors. Draco groaned, and hoped desperately that Harry wasn’t aware of what had just occurred.
"Why didn't you come?" Draco asks. "You always come to the sea with me."
Harry's hand dropped and he stared at Draco with wide eyes.
Draco stayed silent.
“Okay what?”
It was things like that, but it was also things like the Healer check ups he now had to go to. It was also the lying about where he was when he began to have to go to those Healer appointments during work hours. It was promising Harry that he wouldn't take any field missions.
Draco closed the file he'd been working on, and smiled. "Hello, Wilson. How are you doing this afternoon?"
Draco lets out another loud, wrenching sob.
Harry mouthed Draco’s name. Nothing came out but air.
"Yes. I'll turn down the covers. Would you mind telling Wilson I crashed and you put me to bed? If he sees me up, he'll want to continue."
"I'm so, so sorry, love. Tell me what to do. I'll do anything to make this better for you." Harry scooted closer to Draco and carefully placed his forehead against Draco's.
He wanted to absorb everything about Harry in these moments. In all moments, truthfully, but these ones especially. When Harry's hair stuck out in little tufts above his ears and the back of his neck, and his glasses sat on his nose slightly tipped to one side, one of his cheeks pink from laying on it. Draco wanted to be so close to Harry that there was no telling them apart, no pulling them away, no way to ever divide them.
“You’re not supposed to button it to your throat, Mister Draco.”
"Malfoy!"
Draco slid further and further down until his head was completely submerged in the water, and he could neither hear nor see anything. He stayed like that until he could no longer hold his breath, and then he came up for a breath, and then went back down again. He did this until the bathwater grew cool, and he was required to turn in for bed before he caught a cold.
Sorry I'm posting this a day late! Hope you enjoy!
"Yes! We should!" Harry shouted. Draco sat in the tub and stared up at him. "I am desperately in love with you, and I've wanted to marry you for
"Your coworker came up to me today," Harry said.
Harry swallowed. "I want to be close to you right now."
Harry tapped the plain silver band on Draco’s left finger. “Very.”
Harry snorted in his sleep.
“Harry,” Draco said again, and Harry pulled his head back a little.
"There, there, then," Harry murmurs, stepping in behind Draco and pressing close to his back. "You're alright."
Two days.
It wasn't until Harry and him were lying in their bed, tangled over and in between the sheets, that Draco finally understood.
Harry ran a slow finger down Draco's spine. Draco lay absolutely still in order to focus all of his attention on the feeling of it. It would be completely gone soon. Right along with一
Draco smiled and took several of the packages out of her hands and set them aside on the couch. “Very glad indeed.”
It was all very mundane considering the fact that Draco had nearly died, and then promptly came back to life. And the first thing he was doing happened to be finishing a case he'd been working on for months. Not resting, or snogging Harry, or calling his friends in relief, but going back to work.
Harry's head turned up. "Yes?"
Harry had wasted no time. He'd sat Mrs. Weasley on the couch, pulled a terrified Draco down beside him, and said plainly, "Draco is pregnant."
"It's okay," Harry said, looking at Draco with wide eyes, disarming and undiluted without his glasses.
Draco signed to Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco watched as Harry’s grip on their mugs tightened. “But why you?”
“You’ve got a bit of a problem with the interns down here,” Bailey said. “They run around with all kinds of information from the Department of Mysteries.”
“Yes, but.” Harry looked at him, his eyes hard and square. “I was expecting to go to bed alone tonight. You’re not processing. At all. Your mind is on this case, and you’re not thinking about the fact that you were dying for six months. And youーyou dying is likeーlike I was dying with you. I was watching you die, and you hardly seemed to notice, and it was killing me.” Harry shook his head a little, and his hair staticked up against the pillow. “You weren’t watching you die.”
His hands were shaking. Hard.
"I shouldn't have said that earlier," he said, nudging Harry's leg under the water with his toes.
Now, with this time on his hands in the middle of nowhere, seemed a fair time to actually read the book.
“At all?”
When he padded back into the kitchen, Draco was already seated, patiently waiting for Harry with his hands folded on the table and a serene expression on his face.
Draco hadn't even had time to recoil back on the couch before Mrs. Weasley was lifting him and hugging him close, patting his hair, and asking for his favorite dinners.
Draco’s hands went slack. The mug and tea kettle dropped from his hands, almost as if in slow motion. Draco watched, apart, silent, as they fell and fell and clattered to the ground.
Harry paused and held Draco closer. "Instead of being Potters-"
“No,” Wilson said. “Well, that’s all. Thanks for the card.”
“Baby,” Harry muttered. He wasn’t sure where to look so he looked back to the test still in his hand. “A baby.”
He remembers the day like it was yesterday, sunny and bright, Draco grinning so wide as he jumped out of the car and kissed Harry's cheeks over and over.
“I’m in love with you.”
Draco stared at him, cross eyed. "Four days?"
Wilson sent Draco a cryptic letter that wrote,
Draco bit down on the lemon. He wasn’t sure why; it was odd. And it was bitter, so bitter. Draco spit it out and let it dribble down his chin before dunking his face in the water in disgust.
"Draco," Harry said flatly.
It came as no surprise when Harry came home on a different evening, a week later, and said, "I'm taking a break from the Aurors."
Harry bolted up straight and stood immediately, staring openly at the Healer. He whirled to grab Draco's hands and beg with his eyes.
Colorado, Harry had learned in the three weeks they had stayed here, was a very brown place. Brown grass, brown trees, brown hills. The brown-ness of it all made him desperately miss Scotland and the rolling hills and mountains behind Hogwarts. There it was green, and the wind called like a siren from the breaks in the peaks. America, so far, was not like that. It was quiet and empty, mostly filled with suburban sprawl and never ending stretches of fields with cows and long stalks of indistinguishable agriculture. Harry did not feel the sirens calling from America.
"I can cover this," Wilson said. "Here's what we know. There's a smuggling ring in Brooklyn, New York, United States, and MACUSA is a wreck. They haven't done anything substantial in the last two decades aside from shuffle in fresh rounds of corrupt politicians every four years. The Mortem ring is smuggling young witches, exclusively pureblood. He's taking them to New York and collecting them there to perform a purity enchantment. His goal is to... purify himself, I suppose. The motivations aren't quite clear.
"He threw one into the fire."
With both of them out of work, they spent a large amount of time outside the apartment. They walked around museums and public parks, went to fancy restaurants and theatre shows with sign language interpreters that Draco couldn't keep up with. They had dinners with all of their friends, mostly Harry's because Draco's were out of the country. He finally sent letters to Pansy and Blaise about his condition, and although they both Flooed him to give their condolences and check in with him, neither of them bothered to come back to England. Draco didn't mind. If the positions were flipped, he likely would have done the same. What was there to do in a month that you hadn't already done in the lifetime you'd had together? With Pansy and Blaise, there was nothing left to say. With Harry, there was everything.
"Colorado," Draco interrupted.
Draco smiled a little. "Darling, you don't have to ask for that." Draco carefully scooted himself to one side of the bed, ignoring the throbbing ache in his joints as he did so.
, Draco had no intentions of acting on them, nor did he think he would end up in a position where it would be appropriate for himself to get involved with Harry. Or any men. Acknowledging Draco was attracted to men was one thing. Behaving according to that attraction was quite another.
Draco mouthed his name and stared up at him. Tangled black curls tumbled over Harry's forehead, his ears, his neck. Dark skin etched with lines and worry, splattered with freckles, and broken up by a nick on his jaw, a bolt beginning at his forehead and sparking over his eye and down the side of his nose. The planes of his cheekbones, the curving joint of his shoulder, the ridge of his clavicle. His eyes, behind glasses, green, green, so very green. His chin, set and marked with stubble. His sweater, stretched and loose, drooping off his frame to brush Draco's forearm. Bergamot, laundry detergent, the lemon that meant he'd been using Draco's shampoo. Something new that Draco couldn't place一a new body wash?
Draco inclined his head. The ceaseless questions about pointless inquiries were a regular part of his work life. As earnest and level-headed Wilson was about his job, he was not precisely known for his detective skills. Actually, practically none of the Unspeakables were investigative geniuses. The detective work was usually given to the Aurors before the Unspeakables were even made aware that the case existed. Draco privately thought that the Ministry would be far more effective if the Unspeakables were tasked with more than trailing after the Aurors, cleaning up their messes.
He hears Draco take loud heaving breaths, but the pattern of his inhales isn’t evening out or getting steadier.
Harry sets his head down on Draco's back, the place just above where his shoulder blades come to the center. His nose is just close enough to Draco's hairline to gently nestle into the scent of blond curls, lemon shampoo, and anxiety driven sweat. He wraps his arms under Draco's and presses his palms to Draco's chest to feel the rise and fall of his skin and the steady thump of his heart.
"For finally acknowledging my death?"
being a swooning maiden, but his recent actions were quite contradictory.
"My answer is no."
"Draco," Harry said. He tapped his fingers over Draco's knuckles lightly. "You don't get coffee from the interns."
一who wanted to be with him until the end of his life.
Draco weighed it in his hands. “It is nice. But what will I put in it? I don't leave the estate.”
Draco raises his eyebrows. “Harry.”
Despite his telling Kit of his
Scorpius stood and Draco carefully took his hands in his. "Hold on," he said. "Let's get you cleaned up a little."
Draco turned back to Wilson and continued. "The interns have been leaking the case information to the Aurors since we first opened it, which is why he would’ve gone after Robards instead of Sullivan. It’s further removed, attracts less suspicion. Now, what do we know about the case?" Draco flicked his hand and the Mortem case records crowded around him in a ring of legal papers.
Feeling lighter and happier with himself than he had since he’d arrived at the estate, Draco made his way down to the library. He only wished to stop in quickly and pick up a new book. He’d finished his first reads of all the books he could find on the language of flowers, and although he intended to study them further, he was in need of something fresh to focus on. He found something relatively new in
“Ah, yes,” Bailey said jovially, tucking his thumbs into his pockets. Draco wrinkled his nose at the sight. “Well, I heard that you were working on the Mortem case.”
But now was the end of his life. Four months were the end of his life.
Wilson's hand flew to his chest. "Merlin, Draco. Why didn't you say anything?"
Looking at her was like looking at a very fragile little sun. Something so very large and momentous and delicate that it completely changed the trajectory of everything around it, and pulled it into its own orbit, its own galaxy. The knot in his chest from before was nothing like this. Draco smiled down at the girl, rubbed his finger over her peach soft cheek, and cried. Harry held him tight and whispered in his ear, and the Healer eventually left. Draco was lost inside his daughter's little galaxy, spinning around her, her, her. She was everything now. She was all he saw. Draco wanted to look at her forever.
Harry was silent beside Draco, standing slightly behind him and holding onto his elbow.
The next morning, Harry made Draco pancakes before work. They walked to the Ministry together even though Harry usually liked to use the Floo (because he was always running behind) and Draco usually walked to the phone booth entrance so he could stroll through Muggle London (because he was always too early). But they went together and held hands and did not speak about
“Yeah?”
Draco bumps his head between Harry’s shoulder blades. “Well, then it will be McGonagall’s problem.”
Harry stood abruptly. His cheeks went ruddy, then blotchy, and his eyes squinted up tightly in the way they always did when Harry was trying really hard not to cry in front of Draco. "You don't know that, Draco!" Harry exhaled harder and shoved his hands through his hair, turning half away from him. "It's happening right now! What if I had been gone on mission when you collapsed onto the coffee table? What if there hadn't been anyone there to take you to Mungo's when you were burning up in the middle of the night?" He dropped into the small folding chair in the corner, shoved in beside a collection of half dead flowers. "You could've died. You
"I didn't want to know," Draco said, his words slurred and quiet.
Draco shrugged and scuffed his feet on the floor. "Quite difficult to talk about, honestly."
"Darling," Draco whispered into his skin. "My senses. They're going."
“That’s what I thought,” Harry says, and drops his head back down on Draco’s chest.
Right on cue, a bang sounded down the hallway, followed by the straggled yelling of poor Mr. Wilson, and the frantic running of a pair of young shoes.
“Why were you surprised?” Draco asked, although the answer was obvious.
Harry blows out a breath. “I’m so glad she’s okay.”
"Well, I hate the paperwork something dreadful."
"Do you need anything?" Draco said, unsure. "I finished the latest report on the Mortem case. It looks like we'll be closing up on it soon if the interns can keep their large mouths shut, but一"
Draco pressed his forehead into Harry’s belly, then his nose, cheek, his mouth.
Jane glances over at Draco briefly and narrows her eyes. She opens her mouth to speak again, but Draco looks up from his hash and stares at her with wide grey eyes. Too wide to really be attractive, people have said before. Harry likes them.
It didn’t matter what he would’ve imagined. This was what he wanted, more than anything else in the world, for the rest of his life.
Draco drank more tea first, then took a Calming Potion. He figured it might be from stress, so he took a walk around Muggle London before coming back to his desk. The itch grew to a scrape, then a grind, and then a blindingly painful grating that flayed Draco's throat every time he so much as swallowed or breathed.
Draco leaned back in his chair.
Draco grimaced, and Bailey clapped Draco’s shoulder and left.
Harry dropped a kiss on Draco’s head. “Don’t forget to give Archie the card from us, and buy him coffee for the next two years.”
"So you have no idea if they put too much cream in the coffee." Harry smirked.
“Harry?”
At long last.
Harry's eyebrows came together in the middle. "I know this."
“I’d say some harmー”
They sat, in the Weasley's garden, in the center of their wedding, with Molly wriggling across their laps, and their eyes on the party.
He couldn’t look away from his hands, the test in his hands, the
"Really?" Harry said, looking up. Draco nodded. "I'm proud of you."
Draco never much liked looking at himself. He was vain about his face, and his clothes, and his hair, but he’d much rather avoid the rest of his body. With the injuries, though, it was difficult to look away.
Harry tells Draco that he's too fussy (although he's not, not anymore) and that he's a fraud who cares too much about what people think of him (he's not a fraud, but he does care too much). Maybe Draco is tired from the sun and the altitude and the sprawl of Boulder, but he sits on the side of the trail without fighting and cries, and all the Americans watch them.
"It's not," Harry said. He threw a package of toilet paper at the cashier. "We need to talk about it more."
"Oh god," Harry said. "Thank god you're awake. Please never do that again."
"Well," said Harry. Draco nearly cried at the sound of his voice. He never thought he'd get to hear it again, but here it was, broad and deep and scoping around the vowels. "Yes, he is that." His voice was also hoarse.
The door creaked open, and Draco’s head poked in. “Is everything okay? Are you sick?”
Harry can’t hear Draco’s words over the gasps of his exhalations. “I... an accident... I was in.... I thought... oh god. I can’t breathe.”
When the phone rings, Harry stares at the name for half a second before picking up, something heavy already in his stomach. Draco shouldn’t be calling him. Draco should be driving to Pansy’s just now.
“Yes,” Harry mumbled. “A very small person with very big feelings.”
Draco nuzzles in closer behind Harry. “Someone should tell her that if she keeps tugging at that hair, it will all fall out by the time she’s twenty.”
Wilson hovered behind him, and Draco heard Harry’s bare feet enter the room.
Draco sighs and Harry blinks. “Can you explain it?” Draco asks. “I want to understand. I’ve always known I wanted to... with someone. Have sex, that is. I suppose there’s no reason to skirt around it.” Draco isn’t looking at Harry, he’s looking down at the olive green pillow tassels, but his feet are still folded up under his bum and his shoulders face Harry, so Harry isn’t worried. Not yet. “You don’t want sex?” he asks, to confirm what Harry’s already said twice.
Sorry it took me so incredibly long to finish writing this chapter, and thank you so much to all the people who commented on the last one! It helped me bucket loads in finding the motivation to finish this chapter <3
"You haven't even told me what the curse is," Draco said. "What it does."
Harry came home one day with a mug of earl grey tea and a shopping bag.
"Well," Harry said, dropping a cereal box a little too hard in front of the cashier. "We still haven't decided whose name we're taking tomorrow."
Harry shrugs and stares down at the simmering caramel liquid. "I did not think you wanted me there."
"Archie?"
"Please," Draco replied, holding his hand out as Harry passed by to trail his fingers over the edge of his waistband. "Thank you."
almost lost. And I’m not taking it for granted.”
“Anything.”
“Do you have a ring?” Draco asked while Harry pushed the keys into the door.
He couldn't get his eyes open. All he could see was the swarming darkness of the inside of his eyes and mind. He could hear though. That was something.
to his employees or supporters, he was inadvertently giving a clue to the nature of his own evil."
Draco let a soft laugh slip out of his mouth, and took the last sip of his lavender tea without replying to Kit.
“And you don’t like it?”
"Mr. Malfoy?" a voice interrupted at the door. "The little one's been all cleaned up. Would you like me to bring her in here?"
just go in. No one's coming."
"Good morning, Wilson." Draco smiled at the man. Wilson's shoulders were hunched over and his eyes folded in the corners. "How was your date night with your wife?"
For November in London, it was a fairly nice morning. Gray skies, no wind, a dusting of rain. Chilly enough for a cloak, but not cold enough for the fur lined one that Harry had bought for him last December. Draco smiled at the homeless man on the corner, handed him a biscuit from his lunch box (made by Harry, of course. Draco never knew what to pack for lunch). He went on his way, took the phone booth down to the Ministry, and smiled at the woman at the guest counter who looked as if three separate finches had flown through her hair. By the time he reached the elevator to take him down to the Department of Mysteries, there was a pounding behind his skull.
“Can you get the car off the road?” Harry asks.
Harry can't deny it. He seeks out the pain.
that you would link the two immediately."
“An accident,” Draco gasps. “I’m on 9th and Henley. Please...” He starts breathing hard again. “Harry.”
"Well," Harry said, before promptly bursting into tears and falling forward into Draco.
He breathed in relief and let unconsciousness steal him away.
Draco froze and slowly set the quill down again. He turned around to face Harry, but stayed in his seat. "How long have you been feeling this way?"
Draco looked between the mug and Bailey. “Good day, Bailey.”
A paramedic with thin brown hair pulled back in a ponytail nods at him. "Good to know." She watches Draco as she speaks to Harry. "This is quite normal for anyone in a serious accident. Is this his first accident?"
And there was light too. A dim gray light behind his eyelids.
Harry's grip in his hair tightened. "How do you know?"
Draco sighed. “Well, I suppose we can’t have everything.”
He doesn’t say it back, but he knows that Draco sees it. In his breath, and the turn of his head, and the press of his fingertips, Draco knows.
Harry sits up, drawing Draco’s mouth up with him before coming apart. Harry lifts his arms into the air and smiles down at Draco sprawled back on the pillows.
Really, Draco could be stupid at times. Why wouldn’t he turn his head away and pretend to be looking at something else? Then he would be able to pretend he’d just spotted Harry staring up at him, and could have made a snarky comment down to him. Instead, Draco had decided to fall back, as dramatically as possible, to get out of Harry’s sight. Well. He could hold a small sliver of hope that Harry hadn’t seen.
"Yes," Draco said, looking at Harry. "I'd like to meet her."
Harry laughed aloud, and held Draco tighter. “Whatever you want, honey,” he said.
Harry went home with him, clutching his hand and stinking like he hadn't bathed for a week (he hadn't).
“Tell me anyway.”
aware,” said Draco. He refrained from rolling his eyes. “It is a constant bother. Nevertheless, if you are concerned about the interns, I would advise you to speak with Sullivan, our department head, rather than me.”
“Okay,” Harry says. “Okay.”
Draco tried to open his eyes again, and slowly, very slowly, with the uncomfortable sense of something peeling back reluctantly, his eyelids lifted, and Harry's general shape came into distorted focus.
Harry jerked back. "No?"
Draco, abstractly, longed for the time when he was a boy, when the Unspeakables were known for their anonymity, rather than their inter-Ministry cooperation.
Draco looked at Harry, at the cross of his eyes without his glasses, the yellow gold of the night lights reflecting over his nose and cheekbones, the curve of his bottom lip chipped by the slight bite of his teeth. "Hyphenate?"
Harry turned his head to the side to kiss Draco, and Draco tasted sweet tomato juice, earl grey, mint, and a pinch of parsley.
He wanted to see Harry so badly.
Draco shifted to lie on top of Harry and let his weight drop into him, as far and as long as it would go. Draco wished that he could peel back Harry's skin and be absorbed into his muscles, tendons, cells, and flesh. Become one instead of two.
So they went.
“Those things don’t bother me in the slightest.” Draco shuffles closer to Harry on the couch. “Because it’s you. Because-” Draco laughs, his voice cracked and full of air. “Because I’m in love with you.”
Draco doesn’t argue, but he’s shaking so bad that Harry has to help fold his knees underneath him so he can sit down.
Harry's lips moved, half against Draco's, and Draco tilted his head back to see them. He was mouthing one thing over and over again.
, and it was nice.
Harry's breath hitched audibly, suddenly close to Draco's face. "Draco? Darling? Can you hear me?"
"How can he not?" Draco said. He ran his fingers through the sheets, skimming through folds, edging around creases, until he found Harry's hand. "You're Harry Potter."
Draco patted his back lightly. "I know, darling, but this is important to Daddy and I. And I promise that when we get back, we'll all go out for ice cream, alright?"
Harry’s eyes finally left his hands to find Draco.
He didn't mind. He was too focused on the senses in his body that had been deprived of him for months, finally trickling back in steady ribbons of awareness. Smell, taste, hearing, sight, touch. All his again.
Draco yelped and fell off the mattress. Harry shouted, and more footsteps scuffled around the room while Draco laid on his face, afraid to move or open his eyes. After a moment, mild hands soothed across Draco's shoulders and carefully rolled him over onto his back. Someone's knees nudged Draco in the side as they leaned close and murmured, "Draco?"
Draco shook his head. "It's terminal."
Molly wailed louder.
Draco stared. “Why, no. The Unspeakables do not require any additional assistance. Thank you for the offer.”
Bailey had continued on as if he hadn’t heard. “So I thought I’d make you a cup. As a show of interdepartmental cooperation. And you don't have to worry about poisoning,” Bailey said with a wink, “Because I made it.”
”’Course.”
Wilson threw his hands in the air and shouted, "Your illness, you idiot! The
“Thank you so much,” Draco replied, holding his hand out to skim over Harry’s hip as he walked by, passing Draco his mug as he went. He flipped the pages of the case file he had spread across the kitchen table.
A smell reached Draco's nose. He breathed in deep. Laundry detergent, bergamot, a hint of lemon, a very faint whiff of distant sex. All the smells that Draco had been falling asleep to for nearly ten years.
“Of course not,” Daisy said. “It’s not part of a three piece suit, now is it?”
“Yes.” Draco says very slowly. “My name is Draco Potter.”
Draco bent down and licked Harry's skin, one long stripe from collarbone to throat to chin. There was nothing. Not even the taste of his own saliva. Harry shivered.
alone means "the loss is slow." But when you put them together, it means "the loss of a slow death," which is, effectually, what he is performing on those witches in order to christen himself. He’s using it to drain them of their senses, their lives, vitality, and magic." Wilson pushed himself off the couch and walked between Draco's webs of levitating case information. "Neither acts as a curse on its own," Wilson said. "They must be together. The illness you had," Wilson looked pointedly at Draco, "Was
“I didn’t know you were married,” Jane begins immediately as they’re leaving the greenhouse. “Especially not to a man.”
Draco kneeled and picked it up. The wrappings fell open easily to reveal a stem of purple lilac tied to a clipping of purple hyacinth with crude twine.
Draco’s mouth turned up. “Yes, fascinating.”
Harry could fall over laughing.
“Oh, Merlin, I’m so sorry,” Harry said, helping Draco straighten up with his hands.
hot, but he didn't feel like rolling over or kicking the sheets off.
“I’m out of the car,” Draco says.
”That would be lovely,” Draco said, leaning in to kiss Harry one more time before turning back to their cramped desk.
Draco dropped his head back. "I think it's pretty obvious."
Harry rolled to lie next to Draco instead of on top of him. "I wish you hadn't had to go through it alone," Harry whispered, his breath gusting over Draco's face. "Was it hard?"
. But the water is too loud, forever stealing the world's attention, and Draco never hears the words.
"Did you take a long weekend?" Wilson asked.
Draco clutched onto
Harry stopped, froze right in the middle of the living room. "Draco," his voice broke. "It's always going to be too soon."
"And what was I supposed to link?" Draco rolled his eyes. "Mortem smuggled witches out of Europe to siphon their magic for his purity enchantment一what does that have to do with
"Harry," Draco interrupted. "None of those things will happen."
alone means dead.
The way they rose up from the ground out of nothing. How people lived on top of them, in houses built into angles so steep they couldn't be trusted. How everyone talked with flat vowels and bright teeth. When Harry looked into the rear view mirror of the MACUSA car they'd been given, driving out of Boulder, and seen gray rock climbing into the sky, gripping its teeth in to the deepening blue of space.
Harry puts a palm on the side of Draco’s face. There’s a cut over his eyebrow slowly trickling blood. Harry’s gut turns. “Which way was the other driver turning?”
Draco hadn't wanted to be pregnant, hadn't wanted a baby, when he first found out months ago. He hadn't really wanted it until the baby started kicking at his stomach from the inside, if he were being excruciatingly honest. But then, slowly, like threads tangling in a breeze, something had risen and grown from the inside. A tangle and tie of thought and feeling that had gathered and gathered until it was a lump in his chest. He wanted his baby... and he still couldn't look at her.
Draco sobs the whole way home in deep gasps and torrents of tears down the swollen red of his cheeks. Harry keeps a hand on his leg but lets him cry.
Harry couldn’t answer, just pulled Draco closer to him.
What else was there to say? It was one thing to know that you were dying, to know that you would lose all autonomy and sense in a matter of months. It was quite another thing to lean down to a body you knew better than your own, press your mouth to it, expecting the same taste that had always existed there. The drip of salt and sugar, the bitter tang of flesh, sweet in the aftertaste, the familiar give of muscle under teeth. And instead, taste only the absence.
Draco began to walk down the corridor and Harry stayed by his side, matching his steps to Draco’s.
"I'm not ready," Scorpius said, sticking out his bottom lip and pushing his hands further into the ground.
The food was nice, Draco supposed. It tasted faintly of salt, and nothing else. Harry pointed a wine out to him on the menu, and Draco smiled and agreed because it was, indeed, a nice wine, and it was, indeed, very nice that Harry knew which wine to pick out for Draco. But when the wine came out, Draco took a sip, felt blank liquid on his tongue, and nearly threw it all back up.
! I sent you a letter telling you that the Mortem case and
Draco found it amusing how fickle his father’s interest in him were. For months on end, he would have no interest in having to do anything with Draco. But then suddenly, on a whim, he cared enough to send Draco across the country and go rummaging through his belongings and discipline him with essay writing. It was all very confusing, being cared for only when it was interesting or convenient.
"Did it hurt?"
“You said that the enchantment only works if the user is truly in love,” she begins.
“You chose them.”
“Draco,” Harry exhales, into the collar of Draco’s shirt.
"Why?" Wilson asked.
Draco rolled his eyes and wrapped his arms around Molly, strapped into the carrier. Having her in his arms was so much better than having her inside of his body. Draco could remember all the weeks before she had been born, being alone and wrapping his arms around the stretched swell of his stomach, wishing and wishing that things were different. Things
Draco turned to see Harry standing in the door. His hair stuck out around his ears and his t-shirt - Draco thought it might have been one of his from school - hung off his left shoulder. Draco held out his hand, and Harry walked to him without hesitation, dropping his head onto Draco's shoulder next to Molly's immediately.
The financial record crisis had been averted for the most part. Draco didn’t greatly mind writing a report on the Malfoy records, although it would be incredibly tedious. As for the stash under the bed, Draco was both relieved and strung up.
Harry wants to pound the steering wheel of his car under his hands. He needs everyone to be moving five times faster, needs to already be by Draco’s side, run his hands over him, make sure he’s alive. Traffic inches along with the lethargic roll of the end of the work day.
Jane shakes her head hard. “What does it benefit though? Why engage in such complicated and dangerous magic? What does it do?”
Draco sighed, and his headache grew.
“What?” Draco lifted his head from where he’d had it propped on his desk as he traced the rim of his mug.
Draco set the bag down carefully and didn’t push the subject further. He wasn’t sure if he was allowed to leave the estate. He supposed nothing would stop him. His parents couldn’t drag him away from the nearby towns from where they were residing in Wiltshire, so the choice was his. But Draco didn’t want to go out, and have to deal with stiff letters from his father if word got back to him that Draco had been going against his wishes. Best to write to him about it first before taking off. Draco was expecting a letter from Lucius any day now anyways. In his next reply, he would inquire about going out to town.
"What is it?"
Draco marveled at this, the fact that Harry wouldn’t be bothered. Draco was the type of person to be bothered by someone lacing their left shoe before the right one.
over and over again.
. And now you're running about after some crazy case? You need to rest. And Wilson needs to rest too. His eyes are bugging out of his head. I think he only asked to use the loo so he could take a forty second nap before he has to come back and try and keep up with your brain."
Harry noticed everything. If he brushed his fingers over Draco's arm to get his attention and Draco didn't notice right away, Harry would grab at his hand and hold on until Draco's fingers turned purple at the tips. If Draco touched a hot plate for a little too long, Harry would yank him away and take him away to bed to press his skin so hard onto Draco's that Draco would never be able to let it fade away.
Draco coughed. "
Draco can’t talk. He usually does, all the time. But not now, not with this.
Draco couldn't resist rolling his eyes this time. "Because he was Adam Hornby. Considering this fact, it’s likely he wanted to push us off the trail, especially if we were getting close. No villain wants to get caught."
“No,” Draco said. “I’m not.” He rolled over to Harry, always closer to Harry, and kissed him. Whispering, close to his ear, “I’m not.”
"'Because' is not an answer," Draco snapped, and folded his arms tighter under his armpits. Draco was not happy to be here, he had said a million times. Draco didn't like the cold, or the wet, or nature in general. Harry wasn't really sure why he came along.
They left the cemetery, and Draco took them all to ice cream.
They sat in the bath together. Draco thought about having sex with Harry, but didn't move closer to him. He saw Harry staring at his collarbone, and knew that Harry wouldn't move closer to him either. Not now, at least.
It takes another four days after Jane faints in Harry’s office before she comes to confront him again.
Draco opens his eyes and stares at the wall, the tacky green paint close to his eyelashes.
Harry inhaled deeper and bumped his forehead to Draco’s. “Darling. I can’t hear what’s going on inside your head.”
Scorpius sighed heavily again. Draco smiled. He loved Scorpius's sighs. They reminded him so much of the way Harry sighed when he was tired or frustrated, and he couldn't help the sweet turn in his stomach when Scorpius did it, his eyes big and green in his pale face.
No response.
Draco kissed Harry’s shoulder. His skin was warm, so warm, and nice and smooth, and Draco wanted to cover all of it, again. “So when do you go back?”
Scorpius turned his face up to Draco from where he was sat in the front lawn. "But Papa. Daddy said I could play outside."
"Sweetheart."
Harry squirts some ketchup onto his plate. “Almost correct.”
Kit leaned forward in her seat, positioned under an umbrella that was currently open and casting shade over a patch of pink peonies. “What do you think it means?”
"I told him about the
Wilson followed close behind him, his clambering footsteps distracting Draco from the thoughts fusing together in his mind.
“It better,” Harry said, kissing Draco’s cheek as he passed behind his seat. “I’m off to work. Don't sign the card as Draco Potter, don't forget your tie, and don't worry about the laundry. I’m coming home at six, and I expect to know why in Morgana’s long tresses you were targeted by this Adam Hornby by the end of today.”
that he didn't even think to revel in the fact that he was running on his own two legs.
“Why?” Harry wails as he hits the ground with a great
The sheets rustled beside Draco, but he didn't roll over. It was hot,
“Draco,” Harry wheezed. Not loud enough for anyone but himself to hear. “Draco,” he tried again. It came out strangled and warped, but Draco heard.
"Do what?" Draco forced out. His voice emerged scratchy and harsh.
And still, every Sunday they went to the cemetery.
With three weeks to go before Draco's expected departure, he began to wish he'd accepted Harry's proposal. Draco, of course, stood by what he'd said. And yet, he wished for a ring on his finger, and to fall asleep next to his husband.
Harry smoothed a hand down Draco's shirt, running over his chest and down his stomach to settle on his hip. He leaned over Draco's plate of strawberry cake to press a kiss to Draco's mouth. Draco opened his mouth into the sweetness of Harry's mouth, and smiled.
“No harm done,” Draco said louder, and held out his hand.
Draco laughed a little. “You don't have to accept their late work, you know.”
Draco softened, and scooted his chair over to be as close to Harry's as possible. He leaned into Harry's side and smiled into his neck, above his collar and below his jaw. "Harry," Draco said. "I love you very much." Draco felt Harry's jaw shift with the force of his smile. "More than can be put into so many words."
"Quite tired, I expect," said the Healer, smiling jovially and clutching Draco's baby to his chest. "I quite understand. Well, congratulations!" He grinned and patted Draco's arm. "I'll clean up the little darling and let you rest, and you can get a good look at her in a little bit."
, he said, with his mouth. Draco had no idea if there was any sound coming out of him at all, but if there was even a chance that Harry could hear his voice, then Draco would take it.
"I'm not going to marry you right before I die," Draco said. He tried to pull his legs in closer to himself, as some sort of shield between him and the irresistible force of Harry Potter, but his legs wouldn't move. "It's not fair to you."
With five days left, Harry lifted Draco out of the wheelchair and crowded him onto their bed. Draco couldn't move many of his limbs without help beyond the turning of his head and general lifting of his shoulders, so he lay on the bed, and let Harry move him how he wished.
But the Italian only looked down at him – and when had he fallen to his knees? – and Harry knew he wouldn't, could see it in the darkness there of those onyx eyes that this devil would really stop at nothing to get his submission and … anything. Anything, if only… Ron and Mione…
"Anyway, I'm off." And she scrunched up her nose a bit as she threw the Burrow a last derisive glare. "Be careful with the mirror, Weasley. I'm sure you couldn't afford to replace it if something happened. Draco, Blaise, contact me as soon as you are back."
"Of course." Blaise nodded and pressed on, rushing through his words now that Daphne was listening while the relief of finally telling someone who could actually actively help swallowed him whole, siphoning off the tension and adrenaline that was keeping him working even through his tiredness. "You need to send an owl to Severus and tell him to go to my safe house and wait there for Harry. He'll complain viciously, but protect him nonetheless."
"I don't think this is any of your business." Blaise said, his chin raised haughtily, taking a somewhat twisted pleasure in the fact that they would be allowed into Potter's hospital room while his friends obviously were not and were probably not even informed about anything going on, either. After all they were not related to their wonder-boy.
Soothing magical sparks once again sprung to the surface of his hands, tingling like the comforting heat of a fire on cold skin.
No one would believe them if they said that the submissive had enjoyed their date, had kissed them passionately and of his own free will only half an hour before undertaking a reckless attempt to flee; not when they were the accused. After all he had even shown himself willing to hurt Draco and Blaise.
"He does that." Was his only explanation, the tenderness in his voice a little bit surprising for the younger Gryffindor. So far the two Slytherins hadn't been very affectionate towards each other in his company, too much of their focus had rested on him and Harry had somehow just assumed that it was the nature of their relationship, that they weren't really in love; after all, everything the Slytherins usually did seemed to serve a specific purpose, didn't it? But hearing the tenderness with which Malfoy spoke of his lover and remembering the way that Zabini had protected the blonde in the hospital without hesitation when Harry had bitten him made him reconsider.
And while his brothers and sisters drank and laughed and celebrated, Draco's gaze rushed over the multihued crowd in the street, unerringly finding the still unruly mob of black hair that had just left the Ministry. Deep pools of emerald stared back at him for but a moment, that fierce glare that made him think of a prowling wolf.
And just as if he'd not been rattled enough, Blaise suddenly leaned forward and, taking Harry's bent head between his hands, he pressed his lips against the Gryffindor's brow, warm, soft and absolutely shocking. Harry froze as an aura of magical power accompanied the dominant like the soft perfume of flowers. Heavy and sweet like lilies, beautiful, white lilies. This time Harry felt the dizzying warmth that seemed to seep into his very soul but he hesitated a moment too long to break the contact with the handsome Italian because of the gift he had just received, that demanded he give something back, yield something in turn; Harry just didn't know if this was the kind of yielding that was required. Indecisive for a moment, he brought up his hands, probably to gently press the other Vykélari away, but once his fingers folded around the dark skinned wrists, all he could do was hold tightly onto them, the very notion of moving away alien and incomprehensible. God, if he had just a moment more to
Neither Blaise nor Draco had ever spent enough time in Italy to form strong alliances of their own, most of Blaise's contacts were loyal to the Lanai family and to him, the somewhat estranged nephew and cousin and grandson, only by extension.
"Of course, if you wish." Blaise relented amiably and nodded towards Draco, who finally tamed his chuckles into a grin and vanished the mirror with a lazy wave of his wand. Almost, Harry did regret it not being there any more: firstly, he was no longer able to see what Draco was doing behind his back, and secondly… well, he somehow felt that there were still so many things to discover with his body's new appearance and he hadn't quite looked his fill yet.
When the house elves finally brought breakfast, Ives was still entertaining Harry with more or less embarrassing stories about the respective Malfoys and continued to do so throughout breakfast until Draco and Blaise returned a little bit over an hour later, and even though his hosts threw murderous glares at the cheekily grinning, red-haired submissive, Harry felt lighter than he had in a very long time.
And they did. His bones moved oddly against each other, not at all painfully, just in a weird, grating way that was neither pleasant nor really uncomfortable.
Nothing was left now, Draco noted as he stared at his reflection, nothing but his too fast breathing.
If the chairs at Hogwarts would have been anywhere near as comfortable, Harry thought, shaking his head slightly, the teachers would have had no chance of keeping their students awake.
"Don't interrupt me now! I will so regret this…" He said, shifting on his feet. Somehow the Gryffindor looked as if he really couldn't believe the words tumbling out of his mouth as he stared into space, wide-eyed and staggered by his own speech, one of his hands raking through his already tousled hair, leaving it as upset as he seemed himself.
"I can't force you of course." Draco conceded, albeit with a certain tenseness to his voice. "But it would be best if at least the two of you and your sister, Jenny..."
, beating against the eardrums with vicious, unnatural force.
Yet hate and malicious rage and the unquenchable desire for revenge streamed from the darkly majestic beast in suffocating waves, soaking the very earth and air around it. There was hateful intelligence in the white of its glowing eyes and Taide couldn’t help but shudder and cringe under the force of all that ominous intent.
Glaring at his mother and future parents-in-law, Blaise tapped his wine glass with his wand lightly, a bell-like sound filling the room. “May I have your attention for a few moments, please? Thank you. It was a wonderful evening, thank you all for coming and celebrating the news of our engagement with us. Unfortunately, at this very moment, a new Vykélari is unexpectedly fledging without elder supervision and both Draco and I are required to help him through the transition as Lucius’ substitutes. We therefore bid you all farewell and a good homeward journey. Again, thank you all for coming and for your gracious gifts.”
Blaise was angry and annoyed and oddly disappointed; maybe it had been a mistake to bring the two submissives together. Did Ives really have to drag Draco's family into the dirt in front of someone Draco had always tried to impress, always tried to live up to? What had the damn submissive been thinking?
"Two visits in one day." Adler remarked, his gaze resting on the youth standing before him, poised and tall. "To what do I owe that pleasure?" He asked as his opening move, pleasantly as ever.
, a boy whose emotional maturity, sense of justice and self-confidence made him stand aloof of the masses even though he was so painfully unaware of his fame and standing. The disregard of someone who was otherwise almost ridiculously generous with his affection and friendship, befriending a Weasley, for heaven's sake! Blood-traitors and mudbloods whose only redeeming qualities – at first glance – were their Gryffindor loyalty and braveness that bordered on stupidity…
Even though a part of him still twinged like an old scar in the first chill of the coming winter when he looked at the boy. Especially when his eyes were turned or closed and he seemed like the image of the one man Severus had always abhorred above all others. There was so much to dislike there: The boy had such an annoying,
Eyes dry and hard and skin crawling with the surreal surety of what he was physically and emotionally able to do once again and at a moment's notice, Harry raised his gaze to his target, his magic lashing out inside of him against invisible shields, hissing, growling and trembling with the desire to attack like a lion clawing at the bars of its cage, like a mass of cobras and mambas threatening and striking at thin air, like tendrils of power whipping and darting around violently and unpredictably just as accrued electricity suddenly discharging in storm clouds.
In the meantime Potter was still not breathing and Severus knew if he used his own magic or poured more potions into him, the boy would, for whatever reason, just further exhaust his own magic trying to get the foreign stuff out until he reached a level of magical exhaustion from which there was no return (Severus refused to accept the possibility that that might have already happened). Hell, if the boy's own magic wasn't so depleted, being a Vykélari he could probably just heal himself even while unconscious…
"Gladly, Healer…" Draco said, raising an eyebrow in question while they passed the group of red heads, who were still glaring daggers at them… well, at least the younger generation.
“He shows many signs of a Vykélari transformation, but not all of them, so w-we, we were unsure … and the change is too slow, he has not grown at all, so we thought it was a curse. B-but he started growing wings, then, a-and Healer Cowan still thinks he is not a fledging Vykélari, because his claws and canines are much too small and the markings on his forehead and around his eyes and on his body in general are somehow wrong, but I still think we shouldn’t rule the possibility out without any proof and I finally decided to go against his–”
Harry made it halfway around the lake when he finally sat down. The sky was clear for once and the cool breeze was a nice refresher. Harry watched as a tentacle shot out of the water and snatched a bird that had been flying overhead. He was distracted from that completely bizarre display by a mix of anxiety and annoyance becoming apparent inside him. Harry smirked, realizing how frustrating it must be to try and track someone down without a magical map to do so.
“So what spells are there to allow Harry to swim better, or dive farther?” Hermione asked, smiling at the two of them.
Draco was distracted, “No one. A few of our friends.”
“Honestly, I think it’s majorly fucked up that they took that little girl. I’m glad Potter brought her up,” Pansy said, Draco was surprised that there was ascent through the group at her defiant words. Draco’s love for her grew slightly. He could also still feel the simmering anger through the bond and was incredibly curious as to what it was about.
Draco had never felt the immeasurable feelings bubbling in side of him, like the minutes before a Quidditch match but multiplied by fifty, he felt his tongue dart out to moisten his lips before he pulled his hands from Harry’s and settled them on his hips instead. He walked Harry backward until Harry’s back thudded against the wall, his eyes darted from Harry’s green ones, down to his lips, and then Draco was on him.
“You sound funny, Pans. Pants. Pants?” Draco slurred, marvelling at the way the words felt in his mouth.
Draco shrugged, “Hasn’t stopped you last I checked.”
Chapter 30 and we just hit 30k hits!! How incredibly fitting!
“Sirius offered me to let him live with him once I found out the true story of what happened the night my parents died, but then Wormtail got away and Sirius is on the run. I don’t know why it still matters I go back there. But I’m rambling; I don’t want to rant about my terrible home life. That’s not why I asked you about yours.”
they will treat Harry badly. As I am sure you have always been aware of. Let’s go Harry. We know all he cares about is making you worship this school as a reprieve from those awful people. It’s fine, I’ll slum it with the muggles awhile.”
“Happy Birthday, Draco!” He smiled and Draco felt the happiest he had in a while. Maybe everything would be okay. At the very least, Lucius no longer had control over him. He was finally free.
“Went swimmingly.”
“I doubt they can actually keep anyone if you should fail, but we still don’t know if it’s a person you need to retrieve,” Hermione tried to calm Harry down, and Draco shook out his hands. He needed to pull his head from his arse and stop being a shitty soul-mate.
Harry gripped him back, “Yeah, unfortunately. It’s all pretty clear.”
“You taught up there, how is this Malfoy kid?”
“Fuck that,” Blaise spit through shivering teeth.
“Hey, Ginny! Luna!” Hermione called as she approached, and the two of them smiled over at her.
Draco smirked, walking him backwards, “No, the bit before that.”
She needn’t have tried, as she finished ordering Mr. Malfoy was on his feet, basically dragging Draco from the pub. The look on Draco’s face could only be described as resigned, whereas Mr. Malfoy looked enraged.
Hermione walked with the group, keeping an eye out for Ginny and Luna. She had promised to meet up with them, but had sent them on ahead of her. Hermione pulled her scarf more tightly around her throat. It was quite chilly and the wetness just seemed to seep into her bones.
Draco didn’t say anything, just readjusted so his head was on Harry’s chest. He listening to the soothing sound of Harry’s heartbeat and the feeling of his fingers carding though his hair. Slowly, Draco felt himself drift off into the sleep he had been robbed of the night before.
“Er...” Harry didn’t know where to even begin.
Draco turned to him with a smile, keeping his eyes glued to Harry’s and not the enflamed and swollen scar on his forehead, barely covered by his fringe.
“Is it always like this?” Draco whispered to Harry who was now sitting all of the way up, propped up by a mountain of pillows. Harry smiled for real this time and nodded.
“Draco!” He yelled, falling to his knees next to the couch. Draco knew he should pull himself into a more dignified position, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He felt completely and utterly exhausted.
“See, it’s still there. You’re safe. You’re here. We’ll get through this,” Draco did his best to quickly clean Harry off as well as he could. He was soaked from head to toe where he stood under the spray trying to get Harry clean.
“Theo’s the one that tipped me off that something happened to you. He knows about us; I assume he’s known for a bit, I had suspicions. Sorry I guess my mates are a little more observant than yours.” Draco paused, a soft chuckle on his breath. “I probably shouldn’t be riling you up, my apologies. Your mates are perfectly observant and not at all inadequate.” Harry realized he had instinctively raised to defend Ron without thinking about it and the feelings must have pushed through their bond.
Thank you again for the amazing support, it means the world. This week was an absolute nightmare and seeing your comments, kudos, bookmarks, and subscriptions were the bright moments throughout it!

“That was bloody brilliant!” Weasley gasped before breaking down into laughter, “Did you see his face?”
“Watcha working on?” Harry asked, setting down his things and collapsing into the chair next to him.
“I’m okay,” Draco whispered, staring into Harry’s eyes. Momentarily lost in the deep green of the irises. Draco should probably be worried about how easily he lost his train of thought, but at the moment it wasn’t at the top of his list. He noticed his cheek must be swelling because it was getting harder to see out of his left eye.
“How does it sound so pretentious from the Beauxbatons students, and so, not, when it’s from you?” Harry mumbled before hauling himself upwards and attaching his lips to Draco’s.
“Let me think on it, I’ll come up with something,” Draco sighed, “You two have to go, don’t you?”
Draco fixed him with a look, “Don’t worry about it. It doesn’t matter. I’ve made my decisions now I have to deal with the consequences.”
Harry paused from where he had been tracing Draco’s mark, “I imagine I won’t but a deal is a deal.”
“Good,” Draco muttered. He was done hiding what Lucius did to him. Everyone could know that Lucius did this. Draco was not covering for him any longer.
“Do you want some water?” Draco asked, reaching for a cup on the table his glasses had been placed. Harry nodded and did his best to lean up to take a drink. Draco wrapped an arm around his back, hefting him upwards to help him. With anyone else Harry probably would have been incredibly embarrassed, but somehow, he wasn’t when it came to Draco.
Draco choked out a laugh, fake gagging, “Hermione is brilliant, but ergh, no thank you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” Harry asked, stopping to look at her.
A few strands of Malfoy’s hair felt into his eyes, he impatiently shook them out of his face. Harry felt Malfoy’s leg hook behind his and suddenly they were falling backward, with a soft ‘oomph’ Harry’s back collided with the sand. Malfoy loomed over him pinning his wrists on either side of Harry’s head. Now that wouldn’t do, Harry rolled and he and Malfoy wrestled in the sand for a few minutes, neither letting the other one win.
Everyone was quiet for a while before Ron sat down heavily in the chair next to Harry’s bed. He frowned at Harry; his face much more serious than Harry was accustomed to.
“No need, you all packed?”
“You have every right to be, you worried me today. I felt you all the way in Herbology.”
“Mum would have liked you a lot. She would be proud of what you’re doing,” Luna said quietly and Draco busied himself with taking a bite of his food and not thinking too hard about her words. The last thing he wanted to do was get emotional in front of the entire Gryffindor house.
In a daze, Harry piled his things into his trunk. The last couple days had passed in a blur. Between watching Crouch fire his house elf, getting his wand back, leaving the camp site, and the panic Mrs. Weasley was in once they got back, he had been barely able to think more about Malfoy.
Pansy nodded slowly; her eyes fixed to the opposite wall.
“Wood, fire, and blue?” Ginny asked.
“Have you ever been able to communicate words or thoughts?”
“I’m not particular about what it looks like if it gets the job done.”
Lucius should not be in his study; Mother’s letter had specifically said he had a meeting at the Nott’s and Theo had confirmed.
Malfoy was most definitely his soul-mate. Harry stared at himself in the mirror, mouth agape. A massive sun tattoo covered the left side of his chest. The sun was woven full of reds, yellows, and oranges, with even some purple and blue making its way through for the most elaborate depiction of the sun he had ever seen. The colours were still massively bright against his brown skin; Harry wasn’t sure why he expected anything different after seeing Dean’s mark so many times. Dean was even darker skinned than he was.
That night Draco did not sleep well. He woke up frequently to the feeling of suffocating. Over and over he was forced to relive the terrible moments when Harry couldn’t get to the surface fast enough. By the morning Draco was exhausted and incredibly short-tempered. The letter he received at breakfast only served to worsen his foul mood.
“Fine,” Draco allowed and watched as she ran back down the alley. Draco sighed and let the tears he had been stifling, loose.
"See good as new! Now let's go. We cannot risk getting caught." Malfoy was anxiously cracking his knuckles again.
Hermione figured that the scarf must be helping at least a little as Draco’s hand came up to hold it more solidly to his cheek.
“I didn’t know about Sirius and Lupin until just this summer,” Harry complained, a distinct whinge in his voice. He reached over and pinched Draco hard in the ribs when he wouldn’t stop laughing at him. “Keep it up and I won’t help you.”
“And casting foolish curses and belittling Muggleborns accomplishes that? Pansy isn’t my soul-mate, she’s just someone to pass the time,” Draco said flippantly, slightly pleased by the shade of red Father turned at his use of the word Muggleborn and his tone. He had entertained the thought of taking Hermione’s wishes to heart, but had decided against it. He was leaving it all on the table today. He was over being constantly anxious.
“Go ahead,” Harry frowned, feeling the unease coming through the bond.
*Insert 1 million crying emojis* It's done everyone. I literally cannot believe I have clicked finished on this fic. I feel like we were just at the Cup! Seriously you all have become my own little family and I love you dearly. Thank you for sticking with me through this adventure, for giving feedback and endless encouragement, for loving these characters as much if not more than I do. I promise the next installment will begin posting soon. I hope you will all join me there. I already started writing and it's so much fun to be quite different than the books. It will be a whirlwind for sure!
“Oh, Harry, it’s gorgeous,” Hermione said, awe filling her voice. Harry couldn’t help smiling at her words, staring down at his mark, Draco’s mark.
“I’d honestly rather be by myself, Ron want to play chess later?” Harry asked, hoping that would be enough for them to let him leave.
Draco had never been one to manually change in front of his roommates, normally preferring to spell his clothes on, for proprietary’s sake, but he didn’t imagine Harry would change with magic. He absolutely could not allow for Weasley to see the mark. Draco knew Weasley would not rest before finding out who Harry’s soul-mate was, and he was sure to know the significance of how large their marks were. It would only be a matter of time before Weasley would figure out that Draco was Harry’s soul-mate.
“Let’s go find your other half,” Pansy whinged. Draco rolled his eyes and pulled his journal from his bag, quickly asking Harry to meet them in their classroom, warning him about Pansy.
Snape pushed on, “Are you prepared to lose your friends, your family? For Potter?”
“I asked if you’re all right, you looked weird,” Her hand rested softly on his arm and he smiled at her.
“Get it together! The last thing he needs right now is your weakness,” Severus spit, pulling Draco towards his personal quarters. Draco realized in shock that Severus was right.
Alexis
In truth, he wasn’t ready for his House to deal with Harry. He could take harsh words right now; he didn’t want Harry subjected to it.
It was a testament to their friendship that Ron was being as polite as possible, it also took Harry practically biting his tongue off not to make a comment about ‘the fun night’ Hermione had.
Draco’s voice was soft again and he was staring at the cushion of the couch, “I’m sorry if it was excruciating for you. Yes, Lucius cast it a few times. I’ll be fine. This is not the first time he has done it. I think he might have put a little extra into it though. Although it might just be the amount of time since I was subjected to it. I didn’t go home for Christmas as I normally do.”
“You’ve been getting angry more often than you used to,” Draco commented simply, without any accusation.
“You’re sure he’s okay? It was close to the worst pain I’ve ever felt,” Harry muttered and Hermione stopped dead.
“They’re muggles,” Malfoy said bluntly, raising his eyebrows as he stared at Hermione.
“What the hell am I going to do with you, Potter?”
Theo was slightly disappointed he wouldn’t be able to pretend he had no idea about Draco and Potter’s secret bond anymore. It was so nice not having to hear about it. Pansy constantly complained that Draco literally would not shut up about how Potter pretty much shit rainbows and butterflies. It would be fun to make fun of Draco to his face though.
“You can call me a Mudblood today if you need to. I don’t care. Whatever you need to do to keep your father from catching on or doing something.”
Harry blushed, “Sod off. I didn’t grow up in this world like you did.”
“We live in a hetero-normative, traditional, conservative society, that’s why. Technically you could bring a man; people just assume you’d only want to bring a girl. Regardless, one day we will go to a Ball together and we will dance, okay?”
Pomfrey pursed her lips, “I can’t just ignore what happened here.”
“You must be angry, your pompous side is coming out,” Harry teased.
Harry still had the bottle-cap Portkey. He hadn’t needed to use it once he got his wand back and was with Mr. Weasley. He figured it’s always useful to have a Portkey, although he wasn’t sure how long the charm would last on the bottle cap. He tucked it safely inside a pair of socks and pushed it into a corner of his trunk. They were packing; tomorrow they would get back onto the Hogwarts Express. Thankfully, Ron had yet to ask why Harry was suddenly particular about getting changed in the loo. Harry figured that wouldn’t last for forever, but he would take whatever he could get right now. The last thing he needed was the entire Weasley family interrogating him about his soul-mark. At least at school he only had to deal with four Weasleys and Hermione.
Harry smirked, “It’s fine. It was kind of hot to be honest. You definitely pissed him off though…”
Harry shrugged, things couldn’t get worse than his current situation, and stuck the candy in his mouth. He sucked on it and was astounded to see as the bruises slowly but surely faded away by the time he had finished the candy.
“It’s fine,” He said bitterly. “I didn’t expect her to come running to comfort me or anything. It just sucks.” He shook his head and looked up at Harry. “Did you enjoy the show this morning?”
“Eventually, maybe,” Harry said, a smile in his voice. Draco knew them meeting like this so often was a bad idea, but he couldn’t stop himself from doing it. Not when he felt how much happier Harry was afterwards. It had absolutely nothing to do with how much it brightened his mood as well, none at all.
Harry nodded once, his gaze back on the high ceiling of the infirmary.
Harry smirked wider, “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Not sure what you’re talking about, my neck is a bit sore, I think I got all wrapped up in the blanket last night. Look I’m starving. Let’s go get food.”
Suddenly, there was the noise of feet clattering down the hall and the sound of the door unlocking. Draco’s stomach leapt to his throat, panic surging through him. He felt a thump against his chest and suddenly Harry was no longer standing in front of him. Draco whirled at the door as Pansy and Theo appeared.
“Name your price. Free-reign on the prank, just nothing permanently damaging, and if you could avoid fallout to the rest of my house, I’ll pay higher. I also require your discretion. The whole point is that this does not lead back to me in any way.”
Draco smiled weakly, “Not sure that would help anything at the moment. I wouldn’t say no to some ice for my face if it could be managed.”
Poor Harry doesn't even know what bisexual is. Don't worry Hermione will enlighten him. We're getting super close to the Yule Ball, either next chapter or the following! Thank you so much for everything, life has been getting crazier and crazier and yall definitely help break the stress up. Hope you like this, have a great week!
I hope this chapter was everything yall hoped for, it was definitely a fun but tough chapter to write. As always thank you for everything, we're already almost at 500 kudos which just absolutely blows my mind. Also over 300 subscriptions, and about 150 bookmarks (my numbers are higher than what is shown, I'm assuming for private users). I never dreamed I would ever get a response like this one. You all make my days better.
“Mother has said something about perhaps getting lunch, but I’m not sure if I will be joining her or not,” Draco said simply. He actually had quite big plans for his birthday, but he wasn’t going to disclose those to the entire group.
Regardless, Harry was beginning to get worried at how frequently Draco’s emotions were depressed or cut off entirely (another thing Harry loathed Draco was able to do). Harry was becoming more and more preoccupied with what they were going to do over the summer. He didn’t think either of them could stand being apart for the entire hols.

Dumbledore worked fast when properly motivated.
“I’ve heard you aren’t susceptible to the Imperius Curse, we’ll see how you fair with this one!
“Harry!” Distressed voices screamed from deeper in the woods.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Going to let me steal your precious cloak? Or am I finally going to learn about your secret weapon.”
“Hi, guys,” Harry smiled at his two best mates, but ached for the warmth slowly fading with distance.
“Of course Saint Potter would be able to throw it off, why am I even surprised?” Draco commented dryly. Draco did his absolute best to keep the relief out of his voice. Based on who Harry was, it was probably for the best that Harry could resist the curse. Never mind the impressiveness of him throwing it off the first time it was cast on him. That is if it hadn’t been cast on him before, who fucking knew when it came to his soul-mate.
“We’re sure a large number of the school are facing allergic reactions this morning,” Fred agreed.
“A little cold is swimming in October, not freaking February, I’ll be surprised if it isn’t frozen! Do you want an icicle for a soul-mate, because that’s what you’re going to get!”
and the hit before forcing him out. No need letting him see any of the events afterward.
Suddenly there was an ear shattering scream as Fleur was pulled onto the shore. Draco hadn’t been paying attention to know how she got there.
"Are you ready to go back out there?" Draco asked, settling the towel around Harry's shoulders so his hair didn't get him wet. Draco had cast a drying spell on his own trousers and shirt but still left his shirt hang open so Harry could see his Mark. Harry kept reaching up and touching it briefly like he was trying to remind himself it was still there.
“I have gotten some questionable insight from your peers, Draco, care to explain yourself?” Father drawled; his tone frigid.
“You said it makes this awful screeching sound when you open it, right?” Draco asked and Harry nodded.
“Not all of us are born with melanin, it’s rude to comment on my lack-thereof!” He huffed and Harry stuck his tongue out at him.
“Stop saying things are fucking fine!” Malfoy burst; he pointed his wand at a rock and watched as it exploded. A fine dust blew past Harry’s cheek.
“Did they say you would have to fight it?” Draco asked, pausing his pacing to stare at Harry.
“Yeah well all you do is hole up in here by yourself, come back to the Common Room with us. I’m sure Snape will not begrudge you taking some time away from here,” Pansy complained.
Sigh, these boys *heart eyes*
By lunch he was squinting at his food with one eye open due to the sharp throbbing pain in his temple. He shot a glance at Harry and saw him laughing with the other Gryffindors. Weasley seemed to be re-enacting something that everyone was actively listening to. Draco stabbed at his salad, utterly annoyed that he was the only one that had apparently been plagued with nightmares.
Draco focused on their bond and realized that within a few moments he did indeed feel a peculiar cold feeling encasing his arm. “Er, yeah, I can feel it. It’s not like I’m personally cold though, it’s hard to explain. It’s not very comfortable, at any rate.”
Malfoy glared at him, “You wanted a walk,” He repeated, indignation clear in his tone.
Finally, after what felt like several lifetimes, like Dumbledore long lifetimes, Harry walked through the door.
“My father’s favourite pastime is cursing me, so no, I’d rather not.”
"Well, er, Mr. Malfoy, it's obvious you care deeply for Harry and Merlin knows he deserves to have someone in his corner in these uncertain times," Mrs. Weasley trailed off looking out of her depth.
“Fucking surprised they didn’t. Slytherins are much more likely over those powder blue twats.”
Ron scowled, “He doesn’t normally say things he doesn’t have a follow-up for.”
“Not sure that would help anything at the moment. I wouldn’t say no to some ice for my face if it could be managed.”
This was going to a place Draco definitely didn’t want to tread, “From what you’ve told me about them, they definitely don’t make a solid case for muggles.”
Draco always knew that Harry was a magnet for trouble and this year with the Tournament was definitely evidence of that, but he had always seen Harry as sort of indestructible regardless of his frequent Hospital Wing stays. Seeing Harry completely unresponsive in the Hospital Wing scared Draco shitless. Just imagining a life where Harry stopped to exist or a wayward curse made its way home, terrified Draco to no end.
Sure enough, Hermione was curled up on the couch closest to the fire, a book in her lap.
Draco sighed deeply, extremely put out, but did as he was instructed. Every part of his body yearning to rebel and peek his eyes open.
“I’m telling you he’s gone! Far away –” He burst before he was cut off as the worst pain yet bloomed in his forehead. Draco was sure it was going to split in two, he grasped at his head again and fell to his knees.
Draco rolled his eyes at her but continued on his way to the classroom, making sure they weren’t followed. They were one hallway off when Draco saw a tiny Gryffindor watching them. Draco pushed Pansy lightly against the wall, pressing his forearm to the wall above her head and placing his other hand on her waist. He ducked his head as if he were going to kiss her neck, and she giggled loudly. Draco moved his face closer to the skin there and waited a few moments before Pansy whispered that they were alone. Draco smirked, licking her before quickly pulling away.
“I’m just glad Harry figured out the egg as quickly as he did,” Hermione mused. “Imagine if he had waited until the week before or something.”
"Who are you and what have you done with Draco Malfoy?" Weasley asked, his face painted in confusion and shock.
“They said they’re taking something from me, something I’ll ‘sorely miss’. I don’t exactly want to lose anything I’d ‘sorely miss’.” Harry kept making airquotes around ‘sorely miss’.
“No,” Draco said shortly. Her lips drew into a thin line.
Harry was clad in a set of bottle green robes which he had accented with an unmistakable green tie. The Slytherin logo was gone but Draco knew what the colour of the tie he wore daily was. The tie went perfectly with his robes, and Draco would never have suspected it was a Slytherin tie had he not known previously. Harry was wearing his tie to the Ball, in front of everyone to see. Draco’s tie, Draco’s Slytherin tie on the Gryffindor Golden Boy. Draco finally understood the way Harry must feel to see his love bites on Draco’s neck. Draco didn’t understand how Harry didn’t tackle him in the hallways daily with the way Draco was currently feeling.
“Yes, my Father has. Something like that, anyway. My Mother has not, well I guess technically she did slap me once. I deserved it though at least. I aimed some choice language at her and some of her guests at tea. I pretty much knew what was going to happen before I said it, but,” Draco shrugged.
“No obviously they could be together! I mean I live with Dean and Seamus, I just honestly didn’t realize. Look at Mum and Dad’s marks!”
Ron blushed harder, his neck and ears turning bright red along with his cheeks, but shrugged. “It’s hard, but we’re – we’re not soul-mates. What right do I have to keep her from finding hers?”
“You haven’t said what was wrong with him?” He said through clenched teeth, already quite sure he knew what was about to be said. Panic was clawing at his chest again, barely held at bay by the rage flooding his body.
“Hermione! Something –”
“Hermione! Perfect timing!”
“So, you’re really coming to stay with me?” Harry asked hesitantly.
“At what point in the summer do you normally go to stay with the Weasleys?” Draco asked. He would have liked to let Harry enjoy the meal, but he really didn’t have much time to figure things out.
“How is that any better? What am I missing?” He rapidly looked between the two of them.
“I’m not a big fan of people healing me after Lockhart, it won’t kill me to have a bruise,” Harry shrugged.
” Harry whispered, tapping the parchment.
“Who, indeed?” Hermione commented quietly, sipping her cup of tea. Harry refused to meet her eyes, instead letting them drift over to a certain blond across the room. A rush of warmth filled him as his eyes met grey ones before they quickly flitted away.
"I'll be fine, I promise. They’ll be healed. Look, you can check once I take the potion. Trust me.” He still hadn’t moved a centimetre from when Harry had begun touching his soul-mark.  “To answer your question, yes, soul bonds are seriously intense and powerful magic. There’s no ignoring it once the bond has been sealed. It's why I couldn’t bear to watch you get cursed today and feared for you at the Cup. Things are only going to get more intense."
Harry bit his lip, “So she got word all ready?”
Severus stared at him a beat, his eyes widening minutely at Draco's use of Harry's first name, before staring down in horror at his arm. His hand flying to where Draco knew his Dark Mark was.
Draco shook his head, “No they have to listen to me as Head.”
“I wish I could bring you as my date,” Harry sighed bitterly. Draco frowned and bit his lip at the comment.
“Are you going to tell me where you were or should I continue to feign ignorance about the fact that you’re sneaking around the castle constantly?” She asked as soon as Harry made his way into the room.
“I figured it was the whole vanquished Voldemort thing,” Harry said dryly and Draco stared at him.
Draco squinted at him and Harry picked the map up again and pointed at the top, “Look, Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was up as quickly as he could manage, stumbling into the common area where the twins and the girls were in various levels of consciousness.
“I’m glad Ginny’s happy, but damn that girl is bonkers.”
“I have said that,” Hermione confirmed automatically. She cast a glance towards the door. It was obvious she was beginning to overstay her welcome. Her and Draco’s relationship had grown leaps and bounds since she had become aware of his and Harry’s bond, but she knew he would grow closed off if she hung around too long. According to Harry he wasn’t used to showing feelings in front of people.
Alexis
“Oh shit, wait, Professor Lupin honestly helped to create this thing? I knew he was brilliant, but this just cements it. Your godfather too.”
To LadaHathaway that guessed that he was emancipating himself, you basically got it right! This chapter was very difficult. I am not used to writing lore or descriptive scenes. I feel as though I flourish more with dialogue. I hope I did okay. So Draco is essentially 17 in the eyes of magic. We'll see more of what that entails in the following chapters. We really start to deviate from the canon here.
“You best think over your priorities before the next time I see you,” Father threatened. Draco thought the torture was over before he suddenly felt a different blinding pain than the one he had just experienced. The pain encompassed his left cheek bone as Father struck him hard across the face with his cane. Stars burst across Draco’s vision and he let out an involuntary gasp as footsteps faded away from him.
Draco grinned at her and lengthened his stride, practically sprinting down the hallway.
“Yes, well, Lucius can fuck off.”
Draco finally made it back to his room. He pocketed the Cloak and grabbed a few different things from his room before stepping back to the fireplace and throwing in Floo powder.
Draco stared at him before scrubbing his face, “Of-fucking-course you have an Invisibility Cloak. How did I not realize before? I’m so thick. Outside the Shack, Merlin, help me.” Draco wanted to stomp his foot, but was distracted by Harry laughing. “How do you have one of these? They’re incredibly rare.”
Draco sighed and dragged Harry over to the couch, pulling him against his chest as they cuddled. “I haven’t told you for a reason. I like what we have. It’s not a loss. Cursing Muggleborns was so fucking stupid, it’s so juvenile. There’s no point spending time with people who I no longer share the same ideals with. I still get to see Pansy and Theo loads, I just don’t have to fake niceties with people I dislike. The only thing I hate is that people think I’m with Pansy. I can barely stand the charade we put on. It makes me feel gross. I feel like I’m cheating on you.”
“Seriously, which of you did it?” Weasley roared, marching up to the Slytherins.
Harry was beginning to feel less groggy, but it felt so nice feeling Draco play with his hair and talk aimlessly to him.
I forgot something quite big happens in this chapter. So enjoy quite a major bonding...
Hermione, Weasley, his mother, William Weasley, and the black dog were still crowded around the bed that Harry had been sitting on when he got there, but they had been joined by the rest of the school-age Weasley's. Everyone's eyes were on the two of them as they came out. Draco did his damnedest to ignore the stares and focused on helping Harry back to the bed. The sheets were turned down and showed no evidence that Harry had sat on them in his dirt infested kit earlier, which Draco was thankful for.
“It is,” Draco muttered. Pansy stared for another moment before she abruptly turned and fled into the hall.
Draco snorted, “Of course she did. Pretty much every pureblood child in Slytherin, along with some other houses, wrote to their parents about it. As I expected.”
“I’m sorry, the last thing I want to do is keep secrets from you,” Harry sighed. “I’ll tell you what’s going on, but you have to swear to keep it secret. Like Padfoot level secret.”
First things first, coding italics and bold is a freaking pain in the ass on here so please love me for the struggle I just went through. Second how'd you like Christmas presents?? What do we think Harry took? I'd love to hear your guesses. If anyone correctly guesses I'll give them a shout out in the next chapter.  Yule Ball is next and it's a very fun chapter I promise. Also there is another bonding coming up. In a couple chapters my absolute favorite quote of the entire story happens and I can't wait for yall to read it. Like I kinda want to make shirts with this quote on it. Anyways. I hope everyone understood that Harry signed a moon because their marks represent the other, so Harry would be signing the mark that represents him, which happens to be on Draco's chest.
“From our dear little brother-“ George continued.
“Probably for the best,” Pansy agreed, pecking him lightly on the cheek before turning to engage Blaise about the essay he was writing.
Alexis
“I’m not saying it’s a perfect system,” Draco relented, “but it’s how Pureblood custom works.”
Something was definitely off. Draco was hiding something.
Hercules seemed to nod before setting off again. Draco pocketed the letter without another word.
“Don’t look at us,” Pansy spit at Weasley’s accusatory stare.
Harry sighed, resuming the tracing of the moon, “Might as well get that over with, you may want to let go of my hair though.”
“Not everyone has one though. You can’t go your whole life searching.”
“I hope you don’t mind if I join you,” A soft sing-songy voice said to Harry’s left. Harry looked over and saw a small girl with very light blonde hair and a complexion to match. She was also wearing  what looked like a butterbeer cork necklace, and was standing timidly next to the table. The girl had a Ravenclaw tie and was looking expectantly at Ginny who was seated next to Harry.
“Er, sorry. Been preoccupied,” Draco managed, feeling utterly scolded. He was quite glad the twins had collected the cards from the last hand all ready.
“Harry!” Hermione gasped, turning back towards him.
I cannot believe how close to the end we are. I finished editing everything today (thank you President's Day for giving me a day off of work), and there is officially just one chapter left in the first installment of The Sun and The Moon. I have never completed a long fic like this before, so thank you for sticking with me and your wonderful feedback.
What the hell were Fred and George doing here? Harry opened the door a few inches and the twins slid into the bathroom.
Sirius nodded to the group, winked at Draco, before leaving the room as well. Dumbledore gave Severus some instructions and he was about to leave before he stopped and looked at Draco.
Harry tried to scream, to make any noise at all but the silencing curse held firm. His only hope would be if the pain got so intense that Draco would feel it. He was sure Draco probably noticed the anxiety and fear coursing through his body now, but probably wrote it off as anxiety for the task coming up. The boys had already been kind enough to punch him a few times, but Draco probably wrote that off as hits during training.
Harry ran when he saw him slowly lift his hand. He was, fortunately, fast enough to push him to the ground before he could reach the cup. And without thinking, Harry grabbed it instead. He knew already that he had to activate the portkey to make it disappear, and it felt like the only way to prevent Cedric from trying to take it again. But, unfortunately, as he felt his body being transported, he also felt a hand grab his ankle. And when he landed in the expected cemetery, the Hufflepuff was there too, holding the Gryffindor's leg. He had failed. And the green light came before he could even move. The two boys were looking at each others as Harry witnessed the sparkle of life get ripped away from Cedric's eyes. The pressure on his ankle was released. And the Huffelpuff's body became still. Lifeless at his feet, he was dead again. No... there wasn't a single dream were Harry had managed to save him...
Malfoy whispered.
He felt his jaw tense, his face, as always, blank.
He kept on going with his conclusion, hoping that it would be conclusive, and enough for Harry to understand that he had nothing to fear from him now. His motive wasn't based on revenge since there was nothing he could do on the matter anyway. But the Gryffindor who had been dumb so far suddenly proved himself to be clever.
He barked loudly, then pressed his hand against Harry's wrist, nails in his skin as he tried to make him let go. Pulling harder then. Hard enough to free himself this time. Backing up quickly to be out of reach as he started massaging his forearm, holding it protectively against his chest, glaring at the Gryffindor with hate and resentment. Harry was almost expecting him to spit when he saw his lips twist so much with anger that it wrinkled his nose. The grey of his eyes at turned into a cold fire.
He finally said and Harry couldn't help but smile a little. Thinking of how good Malfoy must be at acting if it was all a lie. And finding him still able to subtly praise himself even it that vulnerable state.
But suddenly, he realized only then something he had missed earlier.
If the Gryffindor had still been his old self, he would have probably told him to go fuck himself and would have left with a hasty and dramatic pace. But he was now tamed, too discouraged to turn this into a scene.
He didn't shout but hissed firmly towards Harry's close face. Harry could hear is voice shake at the end even if the blond was trying to stay steady. Letting go of the black haired boy as soon as he was finished, he turned around and sighed, running a hand in his platinum hair again. Fingers stiff and trembling. His breathing was heavy, almost panting.
He said in a low grumpy and sheepish voice. Feeling like he was giving up on what little was left of his pride.
He nodded, not really affected by the idea of sharing dorms with the other houses. It wouldn't change much for him as he intended to stay as far away from everyone as possible anyway. He was already planning to avoid the common room.
He shouted back, lifting a hand to wave it as his silhouette became smaller on the bridge. Not knowing that, left alone in the courtyard, Malfoy smiled and laughed a bit, thinking of how strange their encounter was once more.
Finally out, he took his usual path to the astronomy tower. His head replaying over and over the conversation he had just heard as he was walking. Distracted and confused, everything seemed hard to process.
So, what did you think of this first encounter ? Let me know :)
She answered while sneaking inside, pushing the boy from the doorway as she did, her arms laden with books. Harry felt the uncertainty in her voice despite the light tone she was trying to give herself. He guessed a lie, or at least a very evasive answer that was hiding some other explanation that she was refusing to give him.
Harry shrugged, clearly not willing to ear Malfoy's justifications and blinding himself to his, pretty obvious though, innocence. Still letting his gut feelings control him, instead of using his brain.
Obviously he hadn't understood the blond's words, jumping on conclusions far too easy to make and yet far from the truth.
Cedric said again, low this time, sounding possessed by a need for power. A small creepy smile on his lips, he was breathing fast. Hypnotized by the object that would give him glory.
The Slytherin offered a meek smile and went to sit in another sofa. Careful to not invade Harry's space.
As soon as he sat foot in the courtyard, although he could only see the pavement under his feet, his heart started to race in his chest. Almost breaking trough his ribs and out of his body.
The boy simply asked, as a greeting, always keeping his words to a minimum. To open his mouth required too much efforts lately, to speak exhausted him.
Sirius shook and rose his head, turning slowly to his godson, eyes narrowed.
The blond hissed aggressively, but he was actually sounding tired and beaten down. Obviously hurt by the accusation, but Harry was blind and deaf to it. And he wasn't done with his incriminations. Even stepping closer to deprive the blond of the comfort zone he had take to pressure him.
If there was one face that Harry never thought he would see again here, it was the Slytherin's. Despite the darkness, he also quickly noticed that it seemed to have been damaged. A darker mark covering his right cheek that seemed slightly swollen. His eyes also looked far too bright, but from where he was standing, the Gryffindor couldn't say for sure that Malfoy had been crying.
He questioned with annoyance, looking at Malfoy with eyes filled with irritation. Wide, as to warn him not to push it.
Malfoy sighed, rolling his eyes before getting up. Clearly it was the cue to end the conversation here. Before it would turn bad again. A chance he didn't want to take. He had no idea why he had upset Harry so much tonight, but the experience was definitely not a good one and by all means he wanted to avoid a new confrontation. He was guessing that the animosity of the Gyrffindor towards him was related to something he had dreamt of, but for now, he would be content with not knowing...
He knew that surrounding well and his eyes easily found the shell cottage.
Ron took a last look at him, his eyes shining with rage. They stared at each other in silence for a moment. Both angry.
Ron stayed quiet, just looking at his best friend with a figure of despair. Harry could tell he was scared and that he resented him a bit for having fled like he did. Leaving them wondering in anxiety. The redhead was getting tired of the raven haired boy's moods swings, not knowing how to deal with his ups and down. Every time he was starting to hope, thinking Harry was finally getting better, his hopes ended up being crushed even harder.
At first, the nightmare was only supposed to be the introduction of it.
He only managed to mutter, in a shaky sigh. His shoulders felt so heavy. Not only had he wronged her in the past, but he was also feeling guilty for not having been able to come and see her after the war. He knew avoiding everyone made him an ungrateful asshole. He knew that, after all they had done to help him, it was unfair that he couldn't even look at them. But that's precisely why he couldn't do it. Because they had done so much... Too much. And as a result they all had lost something. For him. And he wasn't worthy of that. He had robbed them.
Still with his back turned, Malfoy took a deep breath and shook his head. Noticing though that Harry seemed to be more calm now, he took a mental note that being gentle and careful was useless and that the boy was in need to be shaken to be brought down.
The room was now empty, only Harry was left crying on the ground. When suddenly the day turned to night, and screams came from outside. Many voices were mingling in fear and pain. But the night was full of light, for the village seemed to be on fire when he glanced at the windows.
It warmed his heart a bit because, really, she was erasing all doubts he could have had about how much she loved him. And Harry felt glad to have her, understanding she would never go away. No matter what, their bond was strong, and that must have been what true friendship means. But on the other side, he couldn't say the same about Ron, who remained now silent, dropping his gaze at the floor. Making it clear he had nothing more to say. His silence made him look like he was acknowledging that she was right, but that he had also choose to remain stubborn and not yield. Which after a few seconds of piercing trough him with her eyes, she understood.
Harry sneered with irony and Malfoy growled with frustration, exhaling trough his nostrils before heading to one of the sofa to let himself fall in it, head buried in his hand, burrowed brows. The conversation was far from over but he needed a break because he was feeling like imploding. This was leading nowhere, and it was excruciating annoying. He was tired of having to justify himself, when he had, for once, done nothing wrong. But, also, he knew he had probably earned it. That constant mistrust about him, from everyone. But he wished things were different, that he could earn something else than this lack of faith. When Harry had told him the previous night that he trusted him, it had given him indescribable joy. Because he desperately needed that trust, someone to believe in him. To feel the faith, it was encouraging because then he believed that his life could actually someday get better. But now it had already been taken away from him, even he had done nothing to deserve that step back and be doubted again. Maybe that was the worst part, to have had that false hope. No hope at all would have been easier.
It was not even morning yet when he opened his swollen eyes. The room was now filled with snores and heavy breathing. One more heavy than the others. His. Body shaking, Harry was, with no surprise to him, pushed out of his sleep by a nightmare. Luckily, it seemed he didn't wake anyone. For once, he must not have been screaming... Maybe he was getting so used to those nightmares that he didn't get agitated by them anymore. How could he know though, he had been sleeping alone for months...
Hi everyone, hope you're all doing well !
She whispered with relieve but Harry stayed frozen, no longer knowing how to hug it seemed. He ended up grabbing her softly by the shoulders to push her away and free himself, feeling uncomfortable. One embrace for the day had been enough for him, even for the whole week and even maybe the month.
So it seemed to be a potion that would make him feel good... Or sell him the illusion that everything was good at least. The Gryffindor couldn't help but be reminded of muggle drugs, and he was a bit perplex about it. He had been taught that they are bad, that they turn you into addicted puppets and mess with your brain. And his brain was messy enough... No need to add to that.
The Slytherin finished and all of Harry's muscles tensed to those words that were too accurate. He felt his teeth clench so hard that he was almost afraid to break them. Malfoy was playing a very strange game and it didn't need more of it for Harry's temperament to yield. His nerves already on edge.
Harry shrugged, trying to have the last word, like an old habit. A childish way to answer because he knew that what he was saying is probably stupid. But he was troubled by the fact that Malfoy seemed to be right once more. It was actually a bit annoying... He was not used to it yet. The blond sneered and it made him pinch his lips with frustration as he felt like he was being mocked.
She had a point, unfortunately for Harry.
The blond conceded as he came leaning next to Harry with a heavy sigh. And the Gryffindor then took a glance. He looked unease. Fingers fidgeting in the void above the railing. Probably swarmed with memories. Harry could understand, he remembered vividly too... The atrocity he was asked to commit, but also how he was unable to do it in the end.
Hermione cleared her throat then sat up suddenly, heading for the stove, she filled a kettle with water and placed it on the fire. It seemed like an excuse to avoid facing him and buy time to gather her thoughts.
But the Gryffindor must have gotten lost in his contemplation, because the Slytherin ended up raising an eyebrow, to insist on the expectancy of an answer. Bringing Harry back to reality.
He finally confessed in a breath.
He didn't turn to look at the blond, just waited for his answer to appear.
She said, gesturing her arm to pressure him to take it. Which he shyly did, turning the flask in his hand to inspect it more closely.
It's gonna be astronomy tower time !
Unsurprisingly, Harry found a familiar brown head waiting on the doorstep. Long untamed hair and hazel eyes shining with constant thinking. Hermione and her determination to never miss a visit.. Yet, Harry found himself surprised to see her alone. Looking behind her shoulder, he was expecting to find the usual redhead, but there was not a single soul to be seen.
Sirius, Dumbledore, Fred, Lupin, Tonks, Dobby and even Snape... Would they all still be alive if he hadn't given a fuck about winning that doomed tournament ? Harry growled in frustration. Too many names on this sinister list.
A voice suddenly reached him, obviously close to him since he could understand it despite the low tone used. Is body jerked slightly in surprise, looking up to turn his head around and try to find who talked to him. Well, actually he knew exactly who he was looking for. That smooth voice, with a hint of amusement in it, and this choice of words... It could only be him. Finding indeed the blond smirking to his right, sitting at the desk next to his. Also alone. Two empty chairs between them. He was so focused on reducing his vision to a minimum whilst looking for where to sit, he didn't even noticed he was there. Grimacing at the snobby looks on Malofy's face, et growled annoyed. Clenching his teeth.
Hermione kept telling him.
He paused to think, trying to hold back new tears. Thinking quickly. He had to find a solution, one that didn't required magic, since he was apparently deprived of it. And it was pretty easy to think of. A door... to open a door without charms there's only one way. A key. There had to be a key somewhere.
Again, she was right. But it was a bit frustrating to hear that she could defend him better than himself, speak the words he couldn't but should have said by himself.
, he thought.
Malfoy stated after observing the reddened and swollen eyes of the raven haired boy. It was obvious that he had lost weight since the war, a lot, too much even. His face was dull and his new pale skin brought out the deep dark circles under is eyes.
Harry remained silent, lowering his eyes to his knees, he twitched. Maybe she was right. The alternative would have been much worse. But the boy continued to dream of other scenarios where the conclusions would have been gentler on them all. He felt Hermione's hand touch the back of his head, as if to appease him. But he shuddered and tensed up at the touch.
He stated calmly, still smirking. It was now Harry's turn to study him head to toe. A fire starting to burn in his eyes as the frustration was getting bigger. He hated to think that way, but Malfoy was actually smart, even if he was trying to pretend he was not... He had always been quick witted, always had the clever answers. With his elegant way of talking, he only needed words to appear superior. A skill really... Always so sly... Harry wished he could talk that well, outsmart him. But he couldn't. Conversation had never been his forte. Dropping then his head a bit, in small defeat.
He said throwing his bag over his shoulder. Turning to Malfoy as an invitation to follow him, he met his eyes wide and stunned. His mouth hanging open like he had just froze.
Searching for the eight year dorm, he was relief to see the common room was indeed empty. Taping the map once more, he closed it.
He admitted. He couldn't let the others see his flaws, especially those who watched him so closely, with the hope of seeing him commit the commissioned atrocities. They would have killed him on the spot, and his mother with, if they had seen his reluctance, his desire to flee and to join the opposite ranks. Malfoy had not had the luxury to scream for help. He couldn't risk having them finding out about his wish to escape. He loved his mother too much.
Biting his lips and dropping his eyes on his feet, he now felt awfully humble. Uneasy as he had allow himself to appear so weak and defeated in front of his old enemy. Worse even, now offering an olive branch. Like a child who was regretting his whim and would bend his back to apologies.
Harry shrugged, doubtfully looking at the cigarette then at Malfoy who sneered at him confessing it was actually ineffective. Making him confused as to why the golden boy was still using it. Harry hesitated a second before offering out of the blue.
He didn't need to elaborate, they both knew he was talking about the apology. And he could see Malfoy stiffen at the mention of it. Suddenly feeling uncomfortable. So vulnerable that the raven black haired boy was overrun by a strange guilt. Wondering then, if he would have noticed that side of him if he had only looked at him properly at least once before. If he had given him a chance, instead of just making him a villain and treating him like one without trying to understand. Swallowing his saliva in a loud gulp, again biting his lips anxiously, he then took a deep breath to find courage. Feeling like it was his turn to admit his wrongs.
The raven haired boy swallowed hard and shook his head to keep himself for staring any longer. Turning away as Malfoy started to bite his lip in reflexion. Bringing his gaze towards his own knees, it was more safe to look there.
She assured him in her soft tone, looking for something in her pocket before handing him a flask filled with a bright white liquid that seemed to sparkle. Harry looked at it suspiciously but didn't move to take it.
He denied automatically, bringing his arm again against his chest in that protective way. Swallowing hard as his breathing was threatening to take on a quick pace again. His heart beating fast at the mere mention of the mark. The idea of Harry seeing his arm, or what he had done to it, was terrifying him beyond reason.
Harry's eyes dropped to the ground, furrowing. He inhaled deeply before leaning back. And the Slytherin found some comfort in the way the other boy was obviously considering what he had just stated. He could see it was resonating in his head, making him think hard and re-evaluate things. The way the Gryffindor was nervously biting his thumb, gaze lost in his thoughts. Silent, because that was a prove he couldn't contest this time. And it was a strong one. A believable one. For the blond, it was a good sign. But he was holding is breath, waiting for confirmation.
The girl surrendered. Giving a firm stare at her boyfriend, who was ready to protest again, to make him shut up.
The Slytherin informed. Trying to make him think, for once, and realize that, after a war like this, there was no way he would be here if he was still representing a danger. And therefore, that it should be pretty obvious that he's sincere in his wish to become a better person.
Harry explained, turning his body fully towards him as he was watching him closely follow the instructions. Unsure of what he was doing and why he was doing it, the blond took a drag, but then immediately started coughing badly. Almost strangling on the smoke. Harry couldn't help but laugh a bit, quickly taking his cigarette back from the boy who was jerking from his cough before he would drop it. He almost went to pat his back, but restrained himself from doing so at the last second. He was still Malfoy after all and it would have been weird...
A (very) small comeback chapter :)
He said with a bored tone, walking nonchalantly before stopping only a few steps away from the Gryffindor. So close, Harry was now sure that the blond had cried and that his cheek was swollen with a bruise, like he had been punched. His rival's eyes then narrowed as if to analyse him and Harry frowned.
When he finally managed to calm down, breathing more steadily, Harry had wandered around the still empty castle. Everyone was still enjoying dinner in the great hall, celebrating the start of the new school year. He could hear noisy conversations echoing down the staircases, laughers and the enthusiastic clinking of cutlery. Everyone seemed so happy to be back. But the boy stayed alone, staring at the restored corridors with a heavy heart. Ignoring the warm greetings of the portraits, which rejoiced at his sight before grunting at his rudeness. He didn't care. He had quickly found the way out, now walking slowly along a path he knew only too well. His steps were guiding him towards the lake.
He could hear a low chuckle behind him as he walked slowly, not even knowing where he was heading actually. To the lake, or maybe the forest. Wherever, as long as he could be alone to cry.
Harry stated, trying to sound firm but the blond just shrugged.
Malfoy's voice seemed weak, as if stuck in his throat. But the raven haired boy managed to hear him anyway. This word that he never thought he would hear trough his rival's lips left him with a strange and disturbing feeling. And he found himself too confused to answer anything. Clumsily nodding his head before continuing his way, leaving the blond behind him. He hastened to join the castle, the word replaying in a loop in his head.
He really didn't deserve to be loved by such a gentle heart, he thought.
The raven haired boy felt uncomfortable with this honest conversation, the open hearted exchange with the Slytherin being very strange. Clearing his throat, his eyes riveted on the grass, he then moved forward to approach the water, passing Malfoy but taking care not to walk too close. He now had his back turn to him, realizing that he was still holding onto his wand, he hesitated for a moment to let go of it.
