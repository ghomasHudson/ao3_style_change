“This is a one time thing. Just while I sort out my new… situation.”
Draco let out a harsh bark of laughter before pulling Harry tight against him. “Oh my god, you great moron. You’re absolutely mad. A complete idiot, like I always suspected.” Harry closed his eyes, burrowing his nose into the crook of Draco’s neck, their nearness adding to the dreamlike haze Harry was in.  Draco clutched Harry tightly for another moment before pulling him back and looking him in the eyes. He shoved Harry’s still-wet glasses onto his face.
Draco, however, was unconvinced. He leaned back against the sinks behind him and turned away. “Stop spewing such rubbish, Potter. Just get out.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Well, Malfoy, hope you brought some less fancy clothes. Those don’t look well-suited to cleaning.”
“Would you like me to sing you a lullaby, Potter?” Draco groused.
He figured he had only been unconscious for a minute or two, but Harry knew something incredibly strange had happened, as he had woken up with Draco Malfoy splayed across his chest, and a cool, tingling sensation thrumming through his veins. He had just heaved Draco’s body off of his own when Madame Pomfrey and a terrified looking Zacharias Smith sped down the corridor.
Draco didn’t seem to know what to say to that. He gave Harry a long, searching look that left him fidgeting in his seat, and then turned back to his book without a word.
,’ he would probably say, ‘
Before he could even finish the incantation, the glass shot off the table with such speed and force that it smashed against the ceiling before anyone could react. Madame Pomfrey gave a cry of shock as the shards of glass fell, scattering across the floor. Harry blinked in surprise, then vanished the shards of glass with a wordless wave of his wand.
jars. Full to the brim of
Harry honestly could not believe the absurdity of the situation he had found himself in. He could only imagine the look on Ron’s face when he found out that Harry became physically ill when he was separated from Draco Malfoy. ‘
“Don’t worry, Draco,” Luna said, closing her own book, “I do think we’ve made some progress. We understand more about life debts, in any case.”
“It is not Luna Lovegood that I am interested in,” he said firmly, summoning all of his courage to look Harry straight in the eyes. Harry stared at him with wide, startled eyes, and swallowed thickly.
Draco knew only one person capable of such eloquence, and he forced himself to look up into the disbelieving face of Harry Potter. He forced one eyebrow to lift defiantly, forced himself to meet Potter’s gaze head-on. Forced himself not to melt into a Draco-shaped puddle of embarrassment on the floor.
“Have you thought about what you’ll do after Hogwarts, Draco?” Luna had asked.
He also, he found, was able to tolerate being increasingly distant from Draco with less severe side effects. Though a part of him knew it was wrong, he kept this to himself. Harry was worried that if given the opportunity to leave, Draco would do so immediately and without question. He selfishly didn’t want to give up the closeness that he had come to cherish.
Draco was fighting his return to consciousness, but knew it was a fruitless effort when the mediwitch came over to begin poking and prodding him with her wand.
Sirius’ ancestral home was looking far worse than Harry ever remembered seeing it. Every surface seemed coated in a gratuitous layer of dust and spiders lurked in every corner. The amount of work that needed to be done felt overwhelming. Rather than dwell on it, he made his way into the kitchen and put on the kettle, making himself a tea to calm him down.
He had spent much of his first few weeks back in the hospital wing, suffering the effects of various hexes and jinxes. Draco learned quickly the safest ways to keep himself safe: walk with your head down, and be alone, as it draws less attention. When you must eat, sneak your meals either in the library or the dorm. Speaking never ends well, and should be avoided at all costs. Following these rules meant he could get by largely unharrassed by his peers. The one person he had been unable to shake was, of course, Harry Potter. Harry had insisted on an extremely awkward and one-sided conversation upon their return to school, wherein he apologized for the fate of Draco’s parents, and asked if they could leave the past behind them and try to be civil with one another. Draco had stared blankly at him, bored and unmoved. He had nodded once, then continued on to his dorm.
Much sooner than he anticipated, it was over. Voldemort was gone in a flurry of ashes, the few die-hard Death Eaters that remained had Disapparated, and Harry had won.
“Obviously. You really think I couldn’t come up with a more offensive nickname for you than Scarhead?”
If Draco was surprised, he hid it well. He gave a single curt nod. “The Golden Trio is going off to hunt Horcruxes, I suppose?”
Draco pulled him violently aside, shouted “Protego!” and dove beside Harry as the books were deflected.
“You’re a Horcrux,” Draco said, voice hollow. Harry looked away, gaze falling on Ron’s horrified face. Harry stayed quiet. “No!” Draco yelled suddenly, startling Harry into looking at him in alarm. His pale, pointed face was filled with rage. “No, you’re not going to die, Harry Potter. We’ll find another way. There's got to be something we can do.”
“Smith,” Draco croaked. Nobody else was in the seldom-used passageway. “Go get Pomfrey.” Smith continued to stare uncomprehendingly at Harry, apparently too shocked to move.
“The school is going to be unimaginably different next year, I think.”
Kingsley surveyed the room. “Alright, then, you lot. You’re all set. A ministry official will be by shortly to set the wards and the tracking spells on the wands. You can floo directly to Harry’s home.”
He glowered, but shook his head, trying to rearrange his hair.
“How was I supposed to know that?” Harry demanded. “All I saw was Malfoy minding his own business, and you pointing your wand at his back!”
----------
Draco fell quite painfully to his hands and knees moments before Harry was thrown into the statue of Batilda the Bewildered. Draco registered a sickening crack as Harry slumped to the ground, unmoving.
Harry paused to think and then answered, “Anything you want to tell me. Your childhood, maybe? Pets? First ride on a broom? Your deepest, darkest secrets?”
Draco’s heart leapt to his throat. He was well and truly fucked.
“It’s too late,” Draco said quietly. “Dumbledore won’t help me if he knows what I’ve done.”
Where would they go? What did a future without the constant threat of Voldemort look like?
Harry smiled and pressed a kiss to Draco’s cheek. “Together?” he asked, looking at his favorite people in the world, though he already knew the answer.
“We?” Draco looked pointedly at the lone book by Harry, open barely past the index, and then the mass of books surrounding himself.
Draco nodded uncomfortably and moved to his own bed, sitting down on its edge.
It was an odd thing to say.
Draco observed him coolly for a moment, and then slipped into his room without a word.
“Wait, Minister,” Harry almost stopped at the look of sheer exasperation on Shacklebolt’s face. He donned what he hoped was his most charming and innocent crooked smile, and asked, “Won’t the Malfoys need to retrieve their personal belongings from their home? Seeing as they won’t be permitted to go shopping.”
Malfoy.’
“Shut up, Potter, I’m hilarious.”
Harry shrugged. “Well, fine. That makes one of then, because I am scared. All the time. Terrified, really. And the only thing that helps me get through it is knowing that I’m fighting for the right side. The side that’s going to win, one way or another. Because Voldemort-”
Draco couldn’t have stopped himself if he had tried. Without hesitation, without thought, he reached out and clutched Luna to him, burying his face in her hair. He felt her small hands rest on his sides, and he pressed a kiss to the top of her head. “Very glad,” he said, voice rough.
The first thing Draco felt when he awoke was an extreme fatigue such as he had never known before. He felt as though he had been running for days straight. His limbs were heavy, his head was throbbing, and a strange hollowness filled the pit of his stomach. He groaned in absolute misery.
Leaving Harry alone with Draco and Narcissa Malfoy for the very first time. Quite suddenly, he was overwhelmed with embarrassment at the state of the house. He felt his face flushing as he watched the Malfoys look around the home, looking posh and elegant and distinctly out of place.
“Napping already, Potter?”
There was a small sound then, halfway between a cough and a laugh. Harry turned and saw Narcissa smiling at him, tears sparkling in her eyes. She approached him slowly, then reached out and took his hands in her own. He watched in numb disbelief as she leaned down and pressed her lips to each of his hands. He felt a tear fall onto his fingertips.
Potter, but-”
He had to admit, he had been in worse company than Lovegood and Potter. Luna was mad, certainly, but she was also overtly kind and welcoming, which was a marked improvement from his usual interactions. And Harry, well… He had never had much trouble thinking of things to say to Harry, though in the past they were usually barbed insults and thinly veiled threats. This uneasy truce between them was new, but not wholly unpleasant. He could see himself tolerating these people under different circumstances, perhaps even enjoying their company. Maybe they could have even all been friends, in another life. In this life, however, Draco was wrung out. In this life, he was without magic, completely vulnerable in a way he never had been before. In this life he had learned to be silent in order to be safe, and the thought of trying to make friends filled him with such anxiety that he felt a cool sweat form on his brow.
The next time he woke, Draco was feeling quite a bit more rested. He heard hushed voices nearby, but was reluctant to open his eyes. Everything was much simpler in his hazy half wakefulness.
Ron rolled his eyes. “We can’t have one peaceful year, can we? We finally get the war over and done with, and you’ve invited the entire family of ferrets to be your roomies. I cannot believe this.” Though he sounded glum, he had a hint of amusement in his eyes. Harry elbowed him, grateful, because he knew that no matter what happened, Ron and Hermione would support him.
Luna nodded sagely. “Yes, that makes perfect sense.” Draco almost snorted. He couldn’t take a piss alone without Harry Potter losing his mind. None of this made any sense whatsoever.
you, I-“
Harry felt a flush creeping up his neck and coloring his cheeks and he smiled. “Oh. Well, er- no need to thank me, really, Mrs. Malfoy. You saved my life. And please, call me Harry. I find it’s a bit less awkward if the people I live with don’t address me so formally.”
Draco took an enormous bite of his apple and chewed thoughtfully for a while. “This does not make us friends.”
Harry’s lips quirked up into a small smirk. He opened his mouth to speak, and then, because Draco’s life was a never ending vortex of despair and humiliation, Professor Flitwick scurried up to the pair, applauding and cheering.
The idea had occurred to him, of course, that Draco might be in a similar position. Since the Ministry had taken possession of the Manor and his parents were in Azkaban, Harry didn’t know where Draco would go after school either. Perhaps, if neither had a place to go, they could find somewhere together. The thought held much appeal. Draco never brought it up, though, and Harry was too nervous to ask.
’ he had said to himself. ‘
Days tumbled into weeks.
Harry shifted and rubbed absently at the back of his neck. “It wasn’t that bad this time. I guess the further apart we are the worse I feel.”
“I’m not holding hands with Draco, if that’s what you’re all after,” Ron joked. Draco pulled a horrified face and Harry and Hermione laughed joyfully.
A low murmuring was spreading through the room as witches and wizards bent their heads low together to discuss what had happened. Kingsley held up a single hand, and all became silent once more. Still, Harry couldn’t look at the Malfoy family. Would they be glad for his intervention, or outraged? He did not feel brave enough to find out yet.
“No. It’s… it’s Narcissa Malfoy, actually, and her son, Draco. They’re going to live with us from now on.”
Harry grinned sheepishly. “Sorry,” he answered, “I wore my invisibility cloak, so nobody would get any funny ideas, what with me sneaking into your room every night.”
“I fear I’m going to grow old by the time you spit it out.” Harry huffed a genuinely annoyed breath this time and Draco pushed up onto his elbows. “Seriously, Potter, just tell me what’s going on so we can sleep.”
Draco stared at him. “What about me and Luna?”
“His- his
Harry shrugged, “I’m usually shit at it. Guess it’s the extra magic.”
His friends blinked at him before exchanging a significant glance.
Harry frowned, shuffling his feet a bit in discomfort. “Well, it wouldn’t be nearly big enough to fill this wall. I only know about my parents, and my muggle family on my mother’s side. I’ve seen pictures of my grandparents, but I don’t even know their names.” He was acutely aware of Draco and Narcissa’s gazes on him, so he forced a smile and hoped it didn’t look as fake as it felt. “It’s alright, though, it’s nice to see Sirius’ family on the wall. And it would be great if we could fix where they burnt away his name.”
Throat tight, he looked back to Kingsley. “I agree to your terms.”
Harry could see no choice now. He leapt from Hagrid’s arms, effectively ending his ruse. “Confringo!” he cried, aiming his wand at the nearest Death Eater. It was deflected with little effort, but it gave him the distraction he needed to dive over and hide behind a low wall. He heard the gasps and shouts from both sides, the cries of relief from his friends. He sprinted to the castle, still hunched over, as Voldemort attacked the walls covering him.
Harry looked chagrined, but closed his eyes and performed the charm. When he opened his eyes, he smiled warmly at the stag before him, the twin of Draco’s.
’ Instead of saying those things, he closed his eyes once more and turned his back to them all.
“No!” Ginny and Hermione screamed together. Ron grasped Hermione was one hand and Draco, who was swaying visibly, with the other.
Harry barked out a laugh that sounded painful and then hung his head. “Draco… I’m
A great gust of wind blew through the room with no obvious source. Draco pressed one hand over Harry’s, grabbing his other forearm with his free hand. He tried his best to make Harry’s wild, panicked gaze meet his own. “Potter, listen to me.
Draco could absolutely not believe that one person could have such horrifically bad luck. He had been told only hours prior that he had accidentally given away most of his magic and now he would be forced to spend all of his time with the one person he had given it to? And of course it was Potter who, in his usual fashion, had to make as big a deal of it as possible by not being able to keep the magic under control. How could his situation get any worse?
Harry sat back in a squashy armchair by the fireplace and felt as though if he closed his eyes he would be asleep within moments. He had asked the house elves to bring dinner to the dorm for himself, Luna, and Draco, as nobody seemed keen to brave the Great Hall. Harry had inhaled his food, and actually felt a pang of regret that there were no barbs from Draco about his horrible table manners.
“Well, he was hiding Lord Voldemort on the back of his head.”
Draco hummed  in agreement and closed his eyes, assuming the conversation was over.
Draco set the book back on the pile and tucked his wand carefully into his trousers. “Potter, this house is a catastrophe. It may very well collapse and kill us all in our sleep, or suffocate us in towers of dust bunnies, but… it isn’t Azkaban. So thanks.”
“First and foremost, a Ministry employee must go to your home and set up wards. These wards will allow you to come and go as you please, Mr. Potter, but they will alert the Aurors immediately if the Malfoys step a toe outside of the house. Should that happen, the Malfoys will serve out the remainder of their sentences in Azkaban. The only exception will be for a life-threatening emergency that requires a Healer from St. Mungo’s. Is that agreeable?” Harry thought it through, and then glanced at Hermione, who gave him a subtle nod. He nodded and agreed with Kingsley. “Next, they will have no access to their wands. They shall do no magic while they live with you.”
They stopped directly at his bedside, and Harry stared at him with wide, startled eyes. As though Draco was the one who had stumbled into Harry’s bedroom in the middle of the night.
Harry laughed and rolled over onto his back, pulling his hand away. Draco felt foolish for a moment about how terribly disappointed he was, and then Harry reached out with his other hand and threaded their fingers together once more. “That story will have to wait, we need to sleep if we’re to be any good in charms tomorrow. It is a pretty good story, though.”
Kingsley Shacklebolt stood, and the hall fell silent. “After hearing from all witnesses, we have completed our deliberation, and the Wizengamot has decided on the following punishments for the Malfoy family. Draco Malfoy, you will serve two years in Azkaban, where you will be allowed visitors and may communicate with the outside world by owl post. These luxuries have been afforded to you due to your meager efforts on behalf of Harry Potter.” Harry’s breath seized in his chest. “Narcissa Malfoy, you will serve five years in Azkaban. You will also be allowed visitors.” Harry could feel his nails digging into the wooden arms of the chair. How could this be happening? “Lucius Malfoy, you will serve twenty years in Azkaban, and will be afforded one visitor monthly. This concludes the Malfoy family hearing.”
Whenever he mentioned Draco to Ron and Hermione during their fire calls or visits, the two exchanged maddeningly knowing glances, as if to say ‘
The abrupt topic change took Draco by such surprise that the tears receded as quickly as they had come. “I talk,” he answered.
“Draco!” Harry shouted. The other boy did not hear him. His face was colorless, filled with horror as he lay on the ground staring up at the swirling black mass.
“What on earth possessed you to come out here alone, without at least letting one of us know where you were going?” Draco snapped. “You could have died. You almost died! And it would have been for nothing you great, useless sod!” He pulled his wand out of his pocket and cast a warming charm over them both.
As Harry prepared himself for bed, he figured that the professors had been mostly correct in their assumption that the rooms would be close enough together. He felt a bit queasy at times, figuring that this was most likely when they were both on opposite sides of their rooms, but it was rather bearable. After a moment of consideration, he lifted his wand and tried to rearrange the furniture a bit so that his bed was right up against the right wall, closest to Malfoy’s room. The magic flowed out of him with ease, and he lifted the dressers and bed as if they were no larger than the feather he had struggled to levitate his first year.
Harry stared, and it was like he was looking at a person he had never met. Harry had seen Draco’s eyes full of fire, hatred, contempt, amusement, and derision over the past seven years. Never once had he seen them full of regret and resignation. Draco looked defeated and vulnerable in a way Harry had never seen, flayed to the bone, exposed.
you that something terrible would happen if you carried on with your Draco Malfoy obsession?’ Hermione had gone on to write that she had done a bit of reading, and she too thought that the effects of the bond would wear off with time. ‘And really, Harry, you can’t deny that you brought this on yourself.’ Then, it appeared that Ron had taken over, and he had suggested several extremely subtle hexes that would be useful, since he was to be in such close quarters with ‘the ferrety git’ anyway. They had concluded by begging him not to take any further risks on behalf of Draco Malfoy, and said that they would see him soon.
Harry nodded and scampered up to his feet as well. “Alright. See you soon, then, Malfoy?”
“Draco, it’s lying to you! It’s not real!”
Before he could stop to think, he held his wand out in front of him. “
Ron stepped in front of both of them. “You took Harry from us, we won’t give you Draco.”
“So… we should both be fine then?”
“Good night, Harry. Sleep well, Draco.” She patted him fondly on the cheek before heading back down the steps toward the bedroom.
Kingsley sat down hard, and after a brief pause, everyone else sat once again. The minister sighed and rubbed his temples. “Mr. Potter, you must understand. We need to keep them under constant surveillance. The Malfoys must atone for their crimes.”
“Look at me.”
“Right, then,” said the Auror, “that’s done. We’ll just be out front for a bit setting up the wards, but we shouldn’t need to disturb you again.” He nodded and turned without waiting for a word, hurrying his partner along beside him as he left.
“Malfoy, are you okay?” Draco could hear the nerves in Harry’s voice, but couldn’t bring himself to care. What an absolutely horrid question. Obviously, Draco was not okay. He was practically a squib. He was exhausted, his head was aching, and he was sick of so much interaction after six months of virtual solitude.
Harry sat on the couch opposite Draco, starting to doze as he struggled to study. A few minutes later, he had given up all but the feeblest attempts to stay awake. Luna smiled fondly at him, gaze so warm and loving Draco felt as if he were an intruder for witnessing it. Luna went over to Harry, taking the book gently out of his hands and removing his glasses, laying both down on the coffee table. She sat down next to him, curling into his side like a cat, and his arm went around her reflexively, as if they sat together like that every night.
uncomfortable enough that he was unable to sleep. When he could bear it no longer, he had jumped out of his bed and went quickly to Draco’s door, thinking that surely Draco wouldn’t mind if he just rested on the sofa in the corner for a bit. He was so desperate for sleep.
“You know,” Harry started thoughtfully, “I’m not even mad at Snape. Not really.”
“Git.”
He reached out and grabbed Draco’s hand. Draco did not pull away.
He was being shaken, hard. He forced himself out of his fogginess, looking into the panic-stricken features of Draco Malfoy.
Harry took a few steps back and looked at his family. The only family he had ever known. The people he loved above all others. Hermione was sobbing, clutching Ron as he supported her weight. Ron’s usually jovial face was grim, so smeared with dirt Harry could hardly see a freckle. Draco was doing nothing to hide his despair, tears running freely down his colorless cheeks.
Good lord, he couldn’t even contemplate his own misery in peace anymore. He sighed quite dramatically to show how put upon he was and turned to look at Harry, eyebrow raised. Harry was squinting slightly, glasses already on his bedside table.
Harry bit his lip, feeling suddenly insecure and unsure of himself. “Er, well. I can’t sleep.”
“Maybe we ought to head to bed,” Harry suggested. “I’m beat, it’s been a long few days.”
Harry looked alarmed. “What is it, Professor?”
Harry hid his face in his hands, and began to cry.
When he was thirteen, taking notes during a Potions lesson, Draco Malfoy noticed him using a pen for the first time. (“What on earth is
He stood just inside, panting, until his brain caught up to the situation and he registered that Draco, Hermione, and Ron stood before him, all wearing matching looks of disbelief and joy.
‘I see you, Draco Malfoy. I, who knows you like no other.’
The sinking sensation he felt when Draco let out a derisive snort was comparable only to the time he had been knocked from his broom.. Draco was shaking his head, a far-off look in his eye. “Running all along the countryside with a bunch of Gryffindors and the Chosen One himself. I shudder to think what my father would say.”
“Oh for goodness’ sake..
Finally, Harry glanced over to the Malfoys. Draco was watching him, face carefully blank, paler than ever. Narcissa was weeping quietly, one hand pressed to her chest and the other to her mouth. They didn’t look furious, or even dangerous. They just looked scared. Harry felt as though they had endured enough fear for their entire lifetimes. “Yes,” he answered solemnly. “I understand. The offer stands. Please give it serious consideration, and remember that I would not be standing here today if not for them. They are not evil people.”
“Thank you,” Draco said quietly. He sighed and then pushed to his feet, wincing as he stretched his back. “If that’s all, I should be getting back. My parents will worry.”
A throaty chuckle reverberated through Harry. “I should be asking you that,” Draco answered. “You’re far too good for me, and you surely deserve much better.” Harry opened his mouth to protest, but froze when Draco pressed a finger gently to his lips. “However, I’m just selfish enough not to refuse this. I’m sure that I’ll want to be with you for as long as you’ll have me.”
Harry wrapped a hand behind Draco’s neck, pulling him toward himself, and their lips met for what would be the first and last time. There was no hesitation as Draco melted into him immediately, clutching the front of his jacket. Harry’s arms snaked around Draco’s waist, pulling him as close as their bodies would allow. Harry permitted himself to linger for only a moment, memorizing the taste and feel of the soft, pliant lips beneath his own.
Draco swallowed thickly as they separated. He opened his mouth to speak, but seemed unable to do so. He nodded instead.
“Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall started, forcing Draco to peer at her without moving, “What you have done is incredibly courageous. You sacrificed a great deal to ensure that your fellow student survived, and for that, I will be awarding Slytherin fifty house points.”
Two days? Draco forced himself to sit upright, though the amount of effort it took was alarming. The last thing he remembered was trying to keep Harry from bleeding to death, and the heat searing his palms. How had this happened? He looked around the hospital wing and found McGonagall and Snape conversing in hushed tones by the entrance, but when they noticed him watching them, they stopped talking abruptly and rushed over.
Then again, something about the thought of the proud, quick-witted, snarky Draco Malfoy wasting away in Azkaban for two years made his stomach lurch. No, he wouldn’t have been able to live with himself had he not stopped it.
The lesson ended before he could figure out what was wrong with his potion, but he bottled it up and handed it in anyway, knowing Snape would most likely give him an A or an O no matter what swill he handed in. He hoisted his bag over his shoulder, and with a quick nod to his godfather, set off toward Transfiguration.
“Don’t say-”
Luna and Draco exchanged a glance, Luna struck up a conversation about the magical properties of soil where troll dung had once been present, and that was that.
After taking a few bites of their desserts, Harry took them on a quick tour of the house (besides the cellar, in which Harry was relatively certain some doxies had taken up residence), finishing in the room with the family tree stretching across the walls. Harry watched as Narcissa and Draco walked the perimeter of the room, examining the branches of the tree and pausing briefly in front of some of the names. Draco looked a bit bored, as if he had seen his family tree a thousand times. He probably had, Harry figured.
Kingsley barked out a humorless laugh. “Aurors around the clock? Mr. Potter, my Aurors are currently overworked and understaffed, trying to hunt down the Death Eaters who fled. We don’t have the resources to do such a preposterous thing.” Harry’s brain was working furiously, trying to come up with any other solution. “Now, Mr. Potter, if that is all…”
Harry nodded and smiled at her, then turned and knocked on the office door. The door opened moments later, revealing Snape looking as morose and bat-like as ever. He stepped aside, an unspoken invitation, and the two boys slipped past him. Snape settled in behind his desk, and conjured two uncomfortable looking dark wooden chairs opposite him.
“What?” Ron yelped as Draco took a furious step forward.
Draco was feeling numb, the empty pit in his stomach seemed to become a growing void. “Permanent?”
, of all things? And he just had to go and summon the thing for the first time in front of almost the entire Hogwarts eighth year. Because Draco Malfoy didn’t do anything by halves, he absolutely did not.
Draco poked at his food, enthusiasm suddenly evaporated. “I used to think I’d like to be a Potions master, like Professor Snape, but recently… I’ve been thinking that I might like to be a Healer.” he had looked up at Luna and Harry self-consciously. Neither spoke, and he looked down once more. “It’s ridiculous of course. Nobody would want a Death Eater to be their healer.”
A pause, and then, “If you must.”
The surly boy shook his head. “Madame Pomfrey already patched me up, ma’am.”
“The Dark Lord lived in my family’s home for a year,” Draco said finally. Harry looked at him, saw the hard look on his face, and remembered the terror he had witnessed on the same face in Voldemort’s thoughts. “I know my family and I are bound for Azkaban. I’ve known for a long time. But… But I would rather spend the rest of my life in Azkaban than spend one more day in that house with him.” Draco clenched his jaw. Took a deep breath. Went on. “I know I’ve been terrible to you in the past. And your friends. I know that saying I’m sorry won’t undo years of hatred, but I want you to know that I do regret it.” Draco was speaking fast now, as though the words would simply stop coming if he paused to collect himself. “If it weren’t for you and your friends, nobody would have been able to stop the Dark Lord. My life may be forfeit at this point, but… Thank you. For stopping him. Nobody else could have done it, and many more lives would have been lost in the long run.”
Draco turned to him, brow furrowed. “Why on earth would I come back here? From the sound of it you’ll have me sleeping in a dingy tent with a rock for a pillow far before the new school term. Oh, that simply won’t do. I’ll have to look up some household spells to make the next few months somewhat bearable. Maybe Granger knows some- Good lord, Potter, are you crying?”
Harry entered the room, squinting to make out Draco’s outline, still in bed. The room was set up very similarly to his own, with Draco’s bed pressed against the far wall. This, Harry reasoned, was probably the reason the distance between them was so uncomfortable.
Harry’s throat felt unbearably tight with emotion. He nodded and glanced sidelong at Draco. “I’m not coming back next year.”
Harry was strangely reluctant to leave Draco’s side, but turned dutifully and headed off in the opposite direction, not waiting around to see if Smith would follow. He walked in a daze, feeling vaguely nauseated, until he had reached Professor McGonagall’s office. She had refused to take over the Headmasters’ traditional rooms, preferring her cozy office that she had used when she was teaching Transfiguration.
“Prat.”
Kreacher set the tray on the table and tugged anxiously at his long ears. “It is not every day that the Master is having such fine guests. My Mistress would have been most pleased to see Narcissa in the home of her ancestors. Yes, she would.”
Harry furrowed his brow as his heart dropped to his stomach. “Do you really think that’s all it was? Just a coincidence?”
Harry sighed. “Better. The further from the dorm we got the better I felt.”
McGonagall sighed heavily. “It appears as though Draco’s magic, which he used to heal you, is reacting poorly to being separated from him.” Harry and Draco exchanged a horrified glance, then stared back at the terse professor. “Until we get this all sorted out, I think it would be dangerous for you two to be apart- don’t give me that look, Potter, there’s nothing I can do about it. You’ll have to stay here tonight, and then arrangements will be made going forward.”
Surely, that meant something profound, didn’t it? He thought back to the silver doe that Snape had conjured, a physical tribute to the love he felt for Lily. Could this be the same thing? Could Draco
Draco frowned. They were summoning Patronuses in Charms, which he had always struggled with even when his magic was fully functional. Though he had all but mere traces of his magic back, he was absolutely exhausted from the constant studying, and he highly doubted he would be able to produce even a single silver wisp. The class spread out throughout the room, and he tried to duck into a lesser populated corner, hoping to spare himself a bit of humiliation.
“No,” Draco said sharply, in a tone that allowed for no debate. He straightened up and looked over his shoulder. “We need to get back to camp. Weasley and Granger need to know what happened.”
“Yes, sir.”
Draco stared at him in outrage and Harry had to bite back a grin. “Are you mad? The sun’s already setting, it’ll be dark soon, and it’ll be after curfew.”
Harry laughed aloud, a bit hysterical, the sound out of place in a hall filled with people recovering from battle. He pulled the three of them into a crushing hug.
Rage and disgust pierced through Harry as he spotted Smith. What kind of coward tries to cast when their opponent’s back was turned? He had no more than glanced at him when Smith suddenly stiffened and fell over, crashing to the cold stone passageway. Harry blinked in surprise and Smith sprang back up, whimpering and pinching his bleeding nose. It had been years since Harry had lost control of his magic like he had just done.
The dreamy voice of Luna Lovegood finally convinced Draco to return to the waking world and see what was going on. He suppressed a yawn and pushed up onto his elbows, looking over at Harry and Luna.
Harry smiled. “Well, yeah. It is yours, right?”
“How do you feel now, Harry?” McGonagall asked.
Draco also, Harry noted, looked genuinely happy.
“I’m not ready to see them yet,” Harry said honestly. “So many people died tonight and… And it’s all my fault.” His throat constricted and he closed his eyes, focusing on taking a deep breath. “I know none of them will admit it, but I know it’s true. I just can’t face them.”
Draco huffed, trying to calm his racing heart, as he knew every beat must be palpable to Harry. “Potter, it’s
They were sprinting, Harry with a firm grip on Draco’s sleeve, keeping him both upright and beside him.
Narcissa smiled. “Yes, thank you. That sounds lovely.” A door shut down the hall, and Harry turned to find that Draco had already retreated into what would be his room.
And then, as always happened when he looked at her, an overwhelming, mind-numbing guilt. The images of her, dirty and hungry and vulnerable, looking at him without fear or disgust. Her taking the food he offered her (far too little, always too little) with a small smile and a genuine expression of gratitude. The thought made him want to fall to his knees, to beg for her forgiveness. To run far away and never look back.
“I’m not going to kiss the hem of your robes, if that’s what you’re waiting on,” Draco snapped.
They were surrounded on all sides by the all-consuming flames. The wall of enchanted water he had conjured lasted hardly a moment before it was gone in a mist, as if it had never been there at all.
Harry loved Draco so much he felt it as a physical ache.
“I just thanked you!”
Kingsley watched him a beat longer, then nodded, apparently satisfied. He signed his name with a flourish, then gestured for the Malfoys to do the same. Harry watched as first Narcissa, then Draco signed the paper with shaking hands. Kingsley handed the completed paperwork to his assistant, who took it and raced out the door without so much as a nod of acknowledgment.
You need to calm down.”
“Depends. What do you want to know?”
Draco stared blankly for a moment, and then shook his head. “No. You don’t mean that. It’s the- the bond. You wouldn’t be saying this if we weren’t bound by the life debt.”
Draco has run forward just a bit, eyes wide with fear. “I love you, scarhead.”
and Harry, ever the Gryffindor, wanted to ease his discomfort. “It’s okay if you do,” he said softly, reaching out.
“Night, Harry.”
“And now?” Pomfrey asked.
“Are you trying to say,” Draco said slowly, still picking apart bits of Harry’s nonsense rant, “you’re worried Lovegood and I are going to run off into the sunset together and leave you by yourself?”
Draco huffed an annoyed breath and nodded brusquely. “Can hear fine. Still smarter than Potter.”
“I do not fear for my safety from Draco or Narcissa Malfoy!” He said, exasperated, a touch louder than he had intended. “They’ve had plenty of opportunity to kill me over the past seven years, when it would have been of far greater benefit to them.”
Luna laughed, an airy, breathless sound. “Quite right, Draco. Research has never been Harry’s strong suit. Luckily, I do love to read. Knowledge is limitless, and our most powerful source of magic.”
Harry’s seventeenth year, he never once found himself in need of anything to write with. He thought of Draco Malfoy’s pale, petrified face, and wondered if he still had the pen Harry had given him.
As soon as they stepped into Draco’s room (Harry now kept clothes in Draco’s room, all pretense gone) Draco turned to Harry with his hands on his hips. “Alright, let's get this out of the way,” he said with the air of someone who was about to ask for help moving a couch. “My patronus was a stag. A bizarre coincidence. Let’s not make a big deal out of this, right?”
He rested his chin atop her head and saw Harry watching them with a small, sad smile.
Kingsley watched him for a moment longer, and then nodded. “The Wizengamot will deliberate.”
After a moment of silence, Kingsley leaned forward. “Harry, do you understand what you’re offering? You would have two convicted Death Eaters in your home. Death Eaters that have proven themselves to be a danger to others. Before we could even consider such an offer, I need to know that you are fully aware of the implications of what you are saying.”
Draco had smiled a bit, withdrawing his hand from Luna’s. “What about you two? Off to conquer more dark wizards?”
Harry grinned. “I won’t apologize for that.”
Harry ducked his head and grinned. He really had missed Draco’s sharp personality, senseless as it was. “Prat. I just wanted to see if I could stay in here tonight.”
“You’re insufferable,” Harry sighed with none of his usual vitriol.
“Oh my God, you’re the worst,” Harry moaned.
Harry hesitated and then nodded, understanding that this was just one more thing that would remain unspoken between them.
Though he had directed his question to Professor Snape, it was Harry who stepped forward to answer. “You saved my life,” he said quietly. “I think I was dying, and you saved me, but… but something happened when you did it.”
All three watched with badly contained anxiety as the extremely old elf struggled to take the bag from Narcissa’s hand. “Er, Kreacher,” Harry interrupted, “Why don’t you let me take the bags, and you can just lead the way to the guest rooms?”
Harry signed, flexed his overworked hand, and passed the paper and quill to Kingsley. The man set his hard gaze on Harry. “Once we do this, Harry, there is no backing out. This is a magically binding contract. Now that you’ve had some time to think, are you still absolutely certain you’re prepared to take on this responsibility?”
“Together,” Draco responded, face softened with affection.
“I- I’m actually feeling a bit better,” Harry gasped, trying to sit up.
Narcissa gasped and turned to chastise her son, but Harry threw his head back and laughed. “I’m so sorry, Malfoy, I forgot to consider your delicate disposition when I offered you a place to live.”
wand tip lit feebly for a moment, and then went out. Okay. That could have been worse, he supposed. He closed his eyes and focused all of his magical energy, imagining it as a physical source (“
Harry? The thought alone made him feel like he needed to get up, to
“Wand?” He asked quietly. Harry withdrew it from his pocket and handed it to Draco quickly. Draco’s dread grew exponentially. Though the wand felt familiar in his hands, there was no answering hum of magic that he usually experienced.
McGonagall was holding Harry by the elbow. He was a trembling mess, pale and sweaty, hair sticking up in every direction. The very air around him seemed to be crackling with energy. The flames on the candles in the doorway were flaring uncontrollably and the closest bed seemed to be vibrating on the stone floor.
Draco turned to face him. “And when all my friends abandon me, and my family disowns me, and the Dark Lord himself decides I should be killed for my disloyalty, who will I have then? You?” he asked scornfully.
He gripped his wand tightly and murmured a soft,
Potter, Merlin. How does nobody else know that you’re a snarky git? Assume I know nothing that happened
It remained a bit awkward between the boys throughout the morning and much of the afternoon, as they dutifully followed the timetable left for them by Snape. It appeared that Harry finally received word from Granger and the Weasel as he, Draco, and Luna ate their lunch in the common room as usual. Draco watched his face darken as his eyes scanned the page. When he finished, he crumpled the letter and threw it into the fireplace, and declared that Hermione and Ron would not be of any help to them.
“Draco?” Narcissa asked, looking concerned. “Are you alright, darling?”
An awkward silence reigned, broken only by the halfhearted attempts at the Patronus charm made by nosy classmates. Draco cleared his throat uncomfortably. “Look, you’re the savior of the entire wizarding world, probably half the class will have stag patronuses.”
Harry hummed in acknowledgment. “Your names are both on the family tree upstairs. In a way, the house is really more yours than it is mine.”
Luna smiled and waved at them as they started toward their rooms. “Goodnight, Harry. Draco.”
idea ever.” Harry laughed, feeling better than he had in months. He turned and saw Draco was flushed and sweaty, his hair dishevelled, grey eyes sparkling. He was so beautiful that it made Harry’s arms ache with the effort of not reaching out to touch him. “I haven’t been on a broom since…” Draco continued before stopping abruptly, face turning pale and grim. And just like that, Harry was forced back to reality.
Harry could hardly touch his dinner that night. His stomach was in knots, the creature in his chest pacing in agitation.
Draco turned to him in surprise. “Why not?”
Then, one late night in the Astronomy Tower, he watched as Draco lowered his wand. His shaking hand reached into his pocket, and Harry could have sworn he saw the clicky top of his pen, just before Severus Snape stepped into the room and murdered Albus Dumbledore.
Harry’s hands were still shaking slightly as he clutched at his stomach. “I started to feel bad as soon as I left here last night. By the time I got to the dorm it was so bad I almost fell over. I don’t remember messing up my bed or the portraits.”
fine, I
When he was fifteen years old, the school was taken over by a tyrant who refused to believe that the Dark Lord had returned, and who also seemed to have a personal vendetta against Harry’s pens. The first time the squat witch had caught him writing with a pen, she had let out a delighted giggle and confiscated it at once. (“Oh no, in my classroom you will write with a proper quill.”) Months later, whenever he held his pen, the thin white scar etched into the back of his hand was on display. (I must not tell lies.) For various mostly-not-quill-related-but-they-certainly-didn’t-help reasons, his fifteenth year was one of the worst of his life, and he was not sad to see it done with.
“Because,” Harry answered. “We’re only sixteen. I quite think one war is enough to be fighting, don’t you?”
Draco sat up slowly, letting his eyes adjust to the dim, firelit room. He flexed his fingers, sighing as blood flooded back into his hand. When he looked at Harry and Luna, still curled around one another and looking like the most peaceful portrait that had ever been created, his heart felt too big to fit in his chest. Odd as it may be, these were his people now, and he felt he would never know a more profound camaraderie.
“Thank you,” Narcissa whispered, sitting in the chair beside him and not letting go of his hands. “Words can not express my gratitude to you, Mr. Potter. Truly.”
“Do you want to settle in for a bit? I can show you around the house later, after dinner. If you’d like,” Harry offered.
“Assume I know nothing.”
After that, the boys suffered through an agonizingly long day. Gossip had once again spread through the halls of Hogwarts far faster than any fiendfyre, and by the end of the day, it seemed that everyone knew about the twin Patronuses. It brought Draco back to the first day the bond had formed, when whispers and rumors followed their every step.
Draco nodded once and hoisted the sword. “Right, then. Open it up, scarhead.”
Harry smiled a bit. “I’m not sure how much you already know.”
Draco snorted. “You’re going to be sorely disappointed if that’s what you’re after. You already know all of my darkest secrets, and the rest is quite dull.”
“I wouldn’t say it
Harry’s second year, he brought three pens, two pencils, and a highlighter he had pilfered from Dudley, since his aunt and uncle refused to spare a penny toward anything that might bring Harry joy. He had hoarded these treasured belongings like a miser with his gold. He wrote essays with renewed vigor, wondering if next he should bring with him a notebook, because parchment was only slightly less ridiculous than the quill. (Measuring essay length in inches of parchment had absolutely baffled him when he first realized what was expected of him. “Was I meant to have brought a ruler?” he had asked. “Dear boy,” Flitwick had responded, looking worried, “What on earth is a roo-ley?” Harry had simply walked away, absolutely despondent.)
Harry had never seen Draco look so grave and determined as when they sped back toward the Slytherins. His two former best friends had shouted awful things at him, called him names Harry couldn’t have even imagined when Draco was his enemy, then set the room ablaze. Yet here Draco was, risking his life for them. Grabbing Goyle by the arm and hoisting his enormous body onto his broom. Waiting to make sure Harry did the same for Crabbe. Allowing Goyle to clutch the back of his shirt for stability as they all, together, raced toward the narrowing exit.
“Good lord, Harry, step back. It would not do for the savior of the wizarding world to die moments after defeating the Dark Lord by accidentally falling off a bridge.”
“Malfoy? Malfoy! Madame, I think he’s waking up!”
used to reside. Snape had told him to practice though, and here, safe and alone in his bed, was the best place to try it.
“I think he might surprise you, Harry.”
Five minutes later Harry was curled up on the bed directly next to Draco’s, staring intently at his profile. Draco was far too used to Harry watching him to pay it much mind.
It was good that Zacharias had come in the end, since it took the both of them to puzzle out what had happened. Harry had started off angrily, recounting to the Headmistress the completely unprovoked attack against Draco Malfoy.
————-
Harry had never seen Draco look so miserable, not even as he had left for the forest. His Adam’s apple bobbed, and he took a step backward. Ron and Hermione closed ranks in front of him, and Harry’s heart swelled.
Harry laughed quietly and felt himself relax into the soft mattress. “Night, Malfoy.”
Dizziness came upon Draco like a wave. Unable to resist, he slumped forward, his head thumping down onto Harry’s chest.
“I just need a moment with my godfather, Harry. I’m sure you understand,” he said, not unkindly. “Bring that vial to Dumbledore’s office. I’ll meet you lot there.” He had yet to meet Harry’s gaze.
“The Wizengamot has concluded its deliberation,” he announced. “We will agree to your offer, Mr. Potter, if you and the Malfoys agree to some conditions.”
Harry took in the other boy’s red-rimmed eyes, his pale, drawn face, his trembling fingers, and realized that this absolutely was not what he wanted. Not even close. He stepped forward, moving slowly, as one might approach a wild animal.
—————
Ron was holding three brooms up in triumph. He tossed one to Harry and one to Draco before pulling Hermione onto his broom behind him. In moments, the four were airborne, speeding toward the exit.
The Dark Lord cackled, a high, unforgiving sound. “Look at the snake, cowering behind his pet lions. How pitiful. Come now, Draco. Don’t make me kill your new friends before your eyes.”
McGonagall rubbed her temple in a rare display of weariness. “Professor Snape and I will work to arrange everything. Take tomorrow off from class, by Sunday we should have all the details sorted. Poppy, can you set an extra bed for Mr. Potter?”
“Merlin, definitely not.”
Harry felt as though his smile might split his face. He wrapped his arms around Draco, pulling him close and pressing his smiling mouth to Draco’s. The kiss was chaste and sweet, and Harry’s breath seized in his chest. It far surpassed any misguided kiss with Cho (too depressing) or Ginny (too much like kissing a sister), and he felt he could have continued to kiss Draco Malfoy for the rest of his natural life. Draco pulled back, though, apparently deciding that they still needed oxygen, and Harry pressed his forehead to Draco’s. “You’re sure about this?” Harry asked quietly.
“I am not scared,” Draco spat.
Harry looked to Narcissa, startled. “Oh! That’s right. I forgot to ask, you were Sirius’ cousin, weren’t you?”
Snape’s (and Hermione’s) idea that Draco’s magic would return to him with time and practice appeared to be accurate. With each passing day, Draco was able to cast increasingly complicated spells, and Harry’s magic was becoming far easier to control. When he closed his eyes and focused, he could still feel a vague undercurrent of Draco’s now-familiar magic, but it no longer felt like he could bring the castle down around him with a lazy flick of his wrist.
“Give it time,” Draco answered automatically.
“What, you don’t trust me, Potter? Still? After all this time?” Draco snapped irritably.
Harry frowned at him. “What?”
Draco looked at Luna with an appraising eye, and the corner of his mouth quirked up a bit. “How very Ravenclaw of you,” he said quietly.
It was silent for several peaceful moments, and Draco was hyper aware that neither of them had pulled their hands away from the other.   Harry’s thumb twitched and Draco’s grip slackened a bit, but Harry just stroked Draco’s thumb with his own. His touch was so soft and so tender that Draco could close his eyes and pretend that it was someone who loved him, who wanted to spend every moment with their hands intertwined like this.
“Wow,” Harry said drily. “That was the worst expression of gratitude I’ve ever heard.”
upset that my scar is so much cooler than yours, I would have made sure to remain fully clothed at all times.” Harry’s lips twitched into a suppressed smile. “Now go back to your room. Unlike you, it takes me more than thirty seconds to ready myself for the day.”
After a moment’s hesitation, Draco stretched his wand arm in front of him and cast a quick levitating charm on a dusty book from the pile in the corner of the room. The book flew up at once, and he grinned as he had it zoom about the room. Harry smiled and clapped quietly as Draco had the book do a poor facsimile of a bow.
Harry’s bit back a retort about Bellatrix, and nodded. “Yes, though don’t go talking about her too much, I don’t think they got on very well. So we’re going to need two bedrooms made up for them. Can you do that, Kreacher? They should be here soon.”
Draco scowled. “Not an invalid.”
. He screwed up his eyes and swallowed hard, thinking determinedly about Quidditch until the urge to cry had passed.
‘I know what it is you think you want. Who you think you desire. The one who you will never be worthy of.’
Luna had placed a gentle hand on top of Draco’s and he looked up into Luna’s twinkling glacial blue eyes. “I think you’re going to make an excellent Healer, Draco.” She smiled kindly, and squeezed his hand.
Lucius Malfoy took a shaky step toward the gathered students. “Draco,” he hissed. “You foolish, reckless boy. Repent for your actions these past years, and come here.”
—————-
Well, if he was going to die anyway…
He stepped forward and took Draco into his arms, pressing a kiss into blond hair as Draco folded into him willingly.
Harry ate most of his meals in the Astronomy tower in the coming weeks. If Malfoy showed up with his own meals more often than not, it was just an unhappy coincidence.
Harry wasn’t surprised. After all, Luna was a lovely, kind, and intelligent girl. Harry just sort of wished it had been he who had made Draco smile first.
“Malfoy!” He called out, voice notably loud in the still too-quiet room.
Harry strode over to where Draco sat, curled up in an overstuffed armchair, and snatched the book out of his hands, ignoring the undignified noise he made. “We’re going.”
touch. Though he knew it was a byproduct of the bond they had created, the thought was still bizarre and exhilarating. By the time he was able to rip his gaze away from Harry’s hunched profile, Snape had already repaired the jars and returned them to their rightful place on the shelf.
Draco turned and saw him then, and it was as if he had aged in the time since Harry had last seen him. He was dirt-smeared and disheveled as the rest of them, hair in disarray. His eyes were downcast, dark bags evident beneath them, and he had a small cut on the side of his face.  Harry thought absently that, though he almost certainly looked worse, it was strange and unsettling to see the usually pristine boy look as he did.  They spent a moment watching each other in silence. Harry wondered what Draco was thinking.
“At the Manor. You recognized us, I know you did.” Draco flushed a bit, but didn’t say anything. He didn’t need to. “You bought us the time we needed to escape that day. And… and last night, your mum lied to Voldemort for me. She told him I was dead, but she knew I was alive. She just wanted it to be over so she could get back here to you.”
The Malfoys carried only three suitcases between them which had been shrunken and tucked under their arms. Narcissa smiled at him as they swept past into the entryway. One of the surly looking aurors stepped inside. “We need to see the wand Draco Malfoy will be using,” he demanded, not bothering with formalities.
“Not an insult,” Draco shrugged. “Just a fact. She’s strange.”
“It’s
“Well,” Luna started, picking up an enormous slipper and eyeing it critically, “this is quite a bit more severe than I thought it would be, just from what Harry’s told me.”
They were impractical beyond measure. He had snapped no fewer than five quills his first week at Hogwarts. His books simply crushed them when everything was together in his bag. And don’t even get him started on the jars of ink. The very glass, very
Harry stilled, eyes fixed on Severus Snape as he breathed his final breath. Harry stood shakily, shoving the vial into his coat pocket. Draco stepped forward and knelt beside Snape, head bowed.
The class had started to practice and he glanced over at Harry. Draco wondered what Harry thought of when he summoned his stag. His Hogwarts letter? His first win at Quidditch? His first snog with the girl Weasel? He knew he probably looked sour at the thought, and he turned his attention to Luna as she produced a corporeal Patronus on her first attempt, the silver hare circling her and Harry once and then going still at her feet. She knelt and then sat there on the floor, cross legged, and began stroking the silvery form as if it were an actual living, breathing rabbit. Harry grinned at her, head cocked and looking extraordinarily fond. The smile made Draco’s heart constrict painfully, a wave of emotion so intense it rendered him dizzy for a moment.
Harry smiled. “Good night, Mrs. Malfoy.”
McGonagall studied him for another moment before nodding. “Yes, Potter. You may go. And ten points to Gryffindor, for protecting your classmate.”
Draco stared at him with wide eyes. “You’re giving me my wand back?”
Draco groaned and stood up, “Oh, Merlin, Potter, you are insufferable. Honestly. I should not be forced to suffer this.”
The thought made Harry’s heart swell.
Harry watched with fascination as Draco began to come out of his shell by tiny increments whenever the three were alone. By the night before their classes were to resume, Draco hardly even looked like he was being held hostage anymore. He and Luna had formed a quick but tenuous bond, as Luna was prone to do with most anyone. Draco, like much of the rest of the school, was no match for Luna’s dreamy smile, warm words, and surprisingly quick wit. He had even restrained himself with what appeared to be a Herculean effort when Luna wondered aloud if the Crumple Horned Snorcack had yet completed their annual migration. Him and Harry had exchanged the smallest of grins, and for the first time, Harry felt as though their relationship might not be so unfixable as he had thought.
“Shut it,” Harry retorted, but the corners of his lips twitched upward. “It’s just… you and Luna.”
Harry tugged on his sleeve again, sharp and urgent, and he saw the moment Draco understood it was him. Draco shifted a bit and turned toward the doors. “Fine, Mother. Just need to get a bit of fresh air. I’ll be back.”
Harry was, in fact, feeling quite unwell. His nausea had yet to subside, and his head was beginning to ache. He moved to push his hair out of his face and realized that his hands were trembling. “Just tired, I think.” This was true, though sleep was the furthest thing from his mind. “Listen, can I go check on Malfoy? I just want to make sure he’s okay.”
Harry, trying not to show his relief, answered quickly, “What are the conditions?”
bit had been about? The thought was so egregious that it made Draco slightly cross. What did he have to do to show Harry his interest? Be kind to him? Call him by his first name? Ask him out on a
“Oh, goodness,” she was muttering, quite disconcertingly in Draco’s opinion. “Mr. Malfoy, can you-
Draco has just drained an entire glass of water, but his mouth still felt bone dry. His tongue felt tacky and too large. He fixed his intense gaze on Snape, finding it far too uncomfortable to look into Harry’s earnest green eyes.
“Oh, yes, Master Harry, sir,” Kreacher said, bowing so low his long nose brushed the kitchen floor. “Kreacher will be most honored to prepare the rooms, yes, my Mistress would be so pleased. Kreacher will start at once.” And with another pop, he was gone.
“Oh, no, Harry, this house has never been ours,” Narcissa answered kindly. “I think you’ve made far better use of it than we would have, anyway.”
Draco shrugged. “My hands burned. I passed out.” Wholly inadequate though it was, he knew it was the best he was capable of.
“How novel for you.” Draco didn’t look up, just closed the book in front of him and pulled another closer.
Quite suddenly, the door opened and there were Narcissa and Draco Malfoy, followed by Kingsley Shacklebolt. The Malfoys had been freed of their bindings and they filtered into the room, quiet and solemn. Narcissa’s eyes were red-rimmed and bloodshot, but she looked no less poised than ever. Draco, on the other hand, looked as if someone had drained all of the blood from his body. Even his lips were pale, his eyes dull and downcast.
“It was!” he answered, still prodding gently at his nose.
When they parted several minutes later to go sleep in their beds, Draco noticed Harry glancing over at him with a troubled expression that he couldn’t quite interpret. After he had determinedly ignored it while preparing for bed, Harry lingered before sliding into bed next to him, looking distinctly uncomfortable.
Snatching the apple unceremoniously out of Harry’s hands, Draco began a thorough inspection of the fruit. “I’ve changed my mind.”
He pointed his wand at the glass on the bedside table. “
“Are you feeling well enough to stand, Potter?” She asked.
Draco sighed heavily. “I don’t know. I suppose not.” He chewed his lower lip. “I just don’t know what you want from me. All of your friends and adoring fans are inside.”
Harry turned to him, brow furrowed. “Do you really think I would have you come out here with me for that? Honestly?”
“Oh, dear,” Madame Pomfrey said, voice muffled by the hand partially covering her mouth.
“Company, sir?” Kreacher asked. “Your friends is coming to stay?”
Harry realized with no small degree of surprise that he was, A few silent tears had made their way down his cheeks without his knowledge or his permission. He swiped them away with his sleeves and closed his eyes, breathing deeply until he felt confident he wouldn’t start crying again.
“Just spying on me as usual, then?” Draco hissed. He held his arms out at his sides. “Well? Happy now, Potter? Is this what you wanted to see?”
“Yes, I see. We’ll be joining him,” Hermione said firmly and then brushed past the witch into the room.
He shook himself out of his thoughts. “Have you finished your Potions essay yet?” Harry asked, the first excuse that came to mind. “I’ve still got six inches of parchment to write, only I think I’ve probably botched the whole thing, if I’m honest.”
Harry stood under the invisibility cloak and surveyed the scene in front of him. The Great Hall was filled again with tables and benches, though now they had no discernable order to them. People sat with their friends and family, paying no mind to houses or age. Some were crying, some laughing, others hugging.
Draco leapt to his feet, scooping up the sword of Gryffindor as he ran toward Harry. For one wild, terrifying moment, Harry was quite sure Draco was about to run him through with the sword, but of course he didn’t. He brought the sword down hard on the locket to Harry’s right, and as suddenly as the chaos had started, it ended.
,” he whispered. The glass gave a feeble lurch, and moved no more. He furrowed his brow. “
“Okay,
He shrugged. “It’s kind of like… water. A river, or something. I guess I would have thought it would feel…”
“-going to be miserable. We won’t last a week.”
Draco closed his eyes and pressed both hands down on the wound, as hard as he dared. “You’re going to be okay, Potter. You are not going to die. Not after everything…” He was only vaguely aware that he was speaking aloud. It was more to comfort himself, anyway. “You are absolutely not going to die because you were being a brave idiot and trying to protect me. Absolutely not, I refuse to allow it.” His hands were growing warm now as he tried to visualize the steady stream of blood turning to a trickle, and then stopping entirely. “I promise you are going to live, Harry Potter. I promise you absolutely will not die today.”
“Malfoy, you git, answer us already so we know you’re not a vegetable.” Harry’s words were harsh, but his tone was concerned and unfamiliar.
Just as it was the night before, the closer to him Draco got, the more tension bled from the rigid set of Harry’s shoulders. He looked up and gave Draco a tired smile. Instinctively, Draco reached out and touched a tentative hand to Harry’s shoulder. Harry seemed to sag in relief.
Harry stood slowly, stumbling a bit before McGonagall steadied him. She led him further into the hospital wing, walking directly toward Draco.
Draco eyed the apple with disdain. “It takes quite a bit more than a piece of fruit to bribe a Malfoy.” He glanced surreptitiously over to the Slytherin table, where his so-called friends were pointedly not making eye contact. His shoulders slumped a bit. “I do have a History of Magic assignment I’ve been meaning to work on, though. I suppose I can come with you. Just this once.”
Draco blinked at the entirely corporeal, majestic creature in front of him and laughed. Slightly hysterical, quite unlike his usual low pitched chuckle. But it figured. It just figured, didn't it, that his patronus would turn out to be a bloody
“Malfoy?”
“I’m sure we could do that, Harry,” Narcissa said.
Another flick of her wand and Draco was being carried down the corridor, off to the hospital wing. Harry jogged to keep up, but Pomfrey held out a hand. “You and Smith are to report to the Headmistress at once.”
“My magic feels like bubbles, if I had to say.” Luna had approached in the soundless way she so often did, dropping into the seat between Harry and Draco. “I’ve always found it fascinating, the differences between everyone's magic. My father, for example, says his magic is more of a sound that only he can hear, and it reminds him of the call of a female jabbermyte.”
“It’s me,” Harry answered, “can I come in?”
’ and Ron would have called his ‘
“Oh.” Harry had forgotten he still had Draco’s wand. “Er, right. One second. Wait here.” He raced up the stairs and tore through his bedside table, grabbing the wand out of one of its draws, then hurried back down the stairs. Panting slightly, he handed over the wand. The auror inspected it suspiciously, then cast a series of complex spells on it with his own wand before returning it.
Where was he? He took a moment to think back and remembered with a start: the lake. The sword of Gryffindor. The locket, pulling him down, refusing to let him surface. Panic clouding his senses, and then, finally, ice cold water filling his lungs.
Draco shrugged. “Said he would be okay.” He couldn’t help glancing at Harry, who looked a bit dumbstruck. A thousand cutting retorts formed on the tip of Draco’s tongue, but he bit them back with practiced ease.
“But you-”
“I think your jokes are terrible, and that you are not funny at all.”
” Draco had sneered as he pulled an elegant eagle quill from the depths of his bag. Harry was quite used to people asking him about his pen, so he rolled his eyes and explained through gritted teeth that muggles write with them. Snape stalked over, scolded Harry for interrupting his class, and took five points from Gryffindor. Harry seethed, and Draco grinned.)
Draco’s grin spread and he said, without a hint of sarcasm, “I truly cannot wait to read your articles, Lovegood.” Luna beamed at him, then they looked at Harry.
Draco continued to stare.
Draco turned to Snape, eyes wide with alarm.The potions professor looked uncharacteristically worried. “It would seem, Draco, that you have saved Potter’s life by transferring a great deal of your magical energy to him.”
At fourteen, Harry had little time for schoolwork. How anyone expected him to prepare for death-defying Triwizard tasks as well as keep up with all of his lessons, he didn’t know. He was pouring over a book about water magic, trying to figure out how to breathe underwater for an hour (hadn’t Dumbledore told the school the tasks would be
Harry felt his eyes burn hot. “I think I’ve known for a while. And I think you have too, Hermione.”
A hush fell suddenly over the Great Hall, and Harry looked around for the source of the nervous energy in the room. He jumped to his feet the moment he laid eyes on Draco Malfoy clutching the strap of his messenger bag, lingering in the entrance of the hall. His shoulders were set defiantly back, pointed chin in the air. He set off, albeit at a slower pace, toward the Slytherin table. Harry glanced over just in time to see Pansy Parkinson set her book bag deliberately down in Draco’s usual seat. Draco had obviously seen it too, and his stride faltered.
“No,” Harry continued, “I didn’t have a pleasant childhood, but I’m here now and I never have to go back, so I try not to dwell on it. My life was much more interesting once I got to Hogwarts, anyway.”
Silence prevailed, neither of them knowing how to continue, or if they should. Harry was just about to suggest that they head up to their rooms when Draco asked quietly, still looking up at the sky, “Why did you save me that day?”
Three days later and Harry still had yet to see Draco.
He cleared his throat. “Kreacher?”
An intense pang of fear shot through him then. He had only narrowly avoided Azkaban after the war. If he was found now, kneeling over a dead Boy Who Lived, what would become of him? He had a wild urge to flee not only the hallway, but escape from the school entirely, perhaps even make a life somewhere in a new country. Looking into the pale, waxy features of Harry Potter, and knowing that his fingers were the only chance at keeping him alive, stopped him.
Without another word, Smith stalked out of the room, shutting the door a bit louder than was necessary.
“No,” Harry refused, despite every atom in his body screaming at him to say yes. “You three need to stay here. Once… once I’m gone, it’ll just be him. Together, you can defeat him.”
When Draco awoke, he thought he was still dreaming. As he blinked open his tired eyes, he found green eyes looking back at him, curious and alert and startlingly close. The previous night came back to him in a rush, though he was only half awake when he invited Potter into his bed. And now here he was, the Golden Boy himself, looking entirely unabashed though he had been caught staring at Draco while he slept. The thought made Draco flush as though he were the one who had done something shameful.
A moment passed in which Draco considered the sheer lunacy of the statement. Draco had been lying next to Harry every night in bed for months, holding his hand and touching him at the slightest opportunity, and Harry had it in his head that Draco wanted
Draco scoffed at the preposterous idea and pulled back the covers on Harry’s side of the bed. “Get in bed, you absolute dolt,” he demanded.
Harry yawned wide and stood from the table, stretching his arms above his head. Draco focused very hard on packing away his own things and not on the sliver of golden skin that was exposed when Harry’s jumper rode up. “Let’s clean up and get this over with then.” He eyed the books on the table and with a flick of his wrist, sent them all zooming back to their shelves.
“I can’t believe he’s really gone,” Harry remarked quietly.
“As Master Harry wishes, sir.”
Harry and Draco hadn’t been alone since the day of the last battle, and Harry was suddenly acutely aware of it. He went to put his hands in his pockets, and instead of his usual wand, he had two. “Oh!” Harry said, pulling Draco’s wand from his pocket. “Here you are, then. I told you I’d keep it safe for you until you could have it back.”
“Potter!” he was shouting. Harry blinked. Draco was soaking wet. “Harry, say something! Can you hear me?”
There, standing in the light of the early morning, hands linked together so they formed a chain, the four spoke a single word, together, and it was more powerful than any Unbreakable Vow that had ever been made.
Harry turned the page of his book perfunctorily, mind miles away. “You know, “ he said impulsively. “Your magic feels different than I would have thought.”
Draco simply hummed in agreement. He had, of course, noticed immediately that Granger and the Weasel had decided not to return for their final year. Harry had seemed a bit lost without them, but Loony Lovegood had not let him sulk for long. Lately, whenever Draco saw one of them, the other wasn’t far behind. Of course, Harry had a long line of people who would give anything to be his friend.
Hermione’s face crumpled. “I’ll go with you,” she sobbed.
The boys were silent for a long time. Harry picked absently at a loose thread on his ragged jeans, trying his hardest not to cry. He wondered again  what Draco was thinking, but dared not ask. He didn’t know what had possessed him to open up, but the longer the silence went on, the more fervently he wished he could take it back.
“Merlin, you’re obnoxious. Guess we’ll have to start in your room then, so you don’t keep me up at night with all your wheezing.”
Harry sank back into his seat only to be ushered out of it moments later by Hermione. “We need to catch Kingsley and sort out the details, Harry, come on.” The three had hardly made it into the hallway when they were approached by a harried looking witch with wild brunette curls and wide blue eyes.
Draco turned to face him, and his face was open and vulnerable in a way Harry got to see so rarely. “I’m sorry about… Well, about everything that happened. The terrible things I said and did. I’m very sorry. For what it’s worth.”
“That’s quite alright, Harry,” Luna said airily. “You still have
They all held each other then, crying and weary and not yet victorious, but alive, and even more incredibly, together.
, once or twice (a week) he donned the invisibility cloak and tailed him to make sure he was safely back in his dormitory at night, but that was far from obsession. He was in the courtyard one sunny day, twirling his pen between his fingers and staring at nothing in particular, contemplating if it was time to take out the Map once more, when Draco found him. He said nothing, just snatched the pen from Harry’s hands. He opened his mouth with an insult no doubt burning the tip of his tongue, when Harry interrupted. “You can keep that, if you want,” he shrugged. “You might find you like it better than writing with those ridiculous eagle quills.” (Draco hadn’t known what to say, looking completely off-kilter from Harry’s kind tone. This had, after all, been Harry’s aim. Harry was most certainly
“You great brute,” Draco muttered quite affectionately. “Why couldn’t you have been something less conspicuous, like a crup or a raven. A raven would have been quite nice actually.”
The elf appeared instantaneously in front of him with a small pop. “Master Harry is being home,” he said, golf ball eyes wide and focused. “It has been quite a while since the Master has come home.”
“Well,” Draco started slowly. “I suppose we get on with the sticky business of living.”
Draco stiffened and looked away. “I’m sorry, Potter. I know how important he was to you.”
Twenty minutes later, Kingsley rose to his feet, and without thinking, Harry jumped up as well. He saw Kingsley smile, just a bit, in his direction before donning the serious affect of the Minister of Magic once more.
Ron shook his head in outrage. “If you die for them I will kill you!” He must have sensed it was pointless to argue, so he turned and continued racing out of the inferno.
The night after the first time Harry had slept in Draco’s room, Harry had lingered awkwardly at Draco’s door when they would usually part to go to sleep. Draco studied him for a moment before opening his door, stepping in, and muttering over his shoulder, “Don’t wake me up when you come in this time.” Since then, they hadn’t spent a night apart. Harry’s room was used only to store his clothes. It was doing very frustrating things to Draco’s heart.
“I think you’re going to drive him to drink, mate,” Ron was shaking his head, bemused.
“Potter.”
Harry looked at him sharply. “Don’t insult her.”
“What? No!” Harry leaned forward. “I was going to say, I would have guessed it would have been like mine. Like fire.”
Draco fell asleep soon after, thinking about the wide smile he had seen so many times over the years. Never once had it been directed at him prior to that night. Suddenly, his situation didn’t seem quite so hopeless.
It had obviously been the wrong thing to say. Draco recoiled violently. “Well thank you for giving me your
After a moment's hesitation, Harry nodded and turned to Ron and Hermione. “Stay with him,” he whispered. “When he’s ready, find Nagini. Kill it. Use the sword.”
“Who is it?” Draco’s voice, rough with sleep, called out.
“Together,” Ron and Hermione agreed.
“Evil?” Draco was glowering at him. “Dark?”
“I heard you had a cloak like that,” Draco said quietly, instead of giving voice to any of his traitorous thoughts, “but I was never sure.” He lay back and tugged the blanket back toward himself, more to annoy Harry than because he really needed it.
Narcissa and Lucius looked worried and a bit lost as Draco walked away, but Draco never looked back. Harry fell into step a bit behind him, following him down the stairs and into the deserted and demolished courtyard. Draco looked around, making sure nobody else was there.
