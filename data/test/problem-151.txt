I shake my head hard, my loose hair- I ran out of pomade last week- falling across my forehead. He doesn't understand.
"Just take her, Potter." My voice comes out as tight as a bow string, threatening to snap and unleash an avalanche of bleeding emotion.
The food looked good and smelled edible which was more than I hoped for since I've never been a good cook, always getting punished for burnt meals at the Dursley's.
"I really like the Weasley's kitchen. I want something like that. And lots of space to move. It's crowded now with that gigantic island in the way."
An empty bus stop bench sits underneath the warm glow of a street lamp and old homes sleep all around. I sit, casting a warming and a small warding spell to repel any unwanted attention.
But that wasn't quite right either. I wanted his serene smile when he held Tasha and his snorting laugh.
"I saw Pansy Parkinson yesterday at the Ministry," Dean said, "She was just released from her house arrest I heard."
Saturdays are always lazy days around Grimmauld. Tools lay abandoned and the telly in what used to be the formal sitting room plays movies on the new vr. I've been putting off taking a shower and getting ready to portkey to speak to a
A towel is tied over my nose to block some of the fumes and Tasha is banned from the kitchen as I clean up. I've probably lost more than my share of brain cells from the fumes and I don't want the first thing I say to Draco is that I've killed his snake.
"I wonder why she's living with you then. Maybe its just her personality and she doesn't mind you at all? Cats are known to be like that."
"It's alright, I'll be back," Draco promises her and despite the language barrier she settles somewhat. He turns back to me and I offer him the cheque, which he grudgingly accepts and offers me his hand.
I find an alleyway between shops and ignoring the stench radiating from large trash box's, I spread the map over the damp concrete, the shadows cast by the building almost black. The sound of machines rumbling down the road seems to multiply in the alley.
Maybe I’m bisexual as well? Because I do think women are pretty. Hermione and Luna are very pretty but I would never date either of them for obvious reasons. Same reason I wasn't attracted to Ginny.
Three days ago, I saw Parvati Patil, who now works as an Auror, and she gave me her grandmother's recipes, including one for naan bread.
"Ah. First time rider I assume. Give me your address," He reaches a hand back and I deposit the sheet of paper there.
Luna sighs softly, grabs my arm and drags me out of Grimmauld and Apparates to the Portkey site, taking me by forceful side along.
Light footsteps approach and I collect myself just in time to see Luna Lovegood followed by Potter still in his towel. Water drips down his neck from his soaked black hair and kisses his wonderful pecs.
"I always look bored. And I like your stories." I force out in a cold voice, not sure why. Irritation flares and I take a gulp of my spicy wine.
She hurries off after another overly excited goodbye and leaves me with her 'nice boy' nephew Charles.
The idea has only hit my brain a moment before my fingers are in my mouth and I'm coating them in spit, rubbing them over my hole. I grab the pillow with one hand to rut into it properly and with the other I work a spit-slick finger up my arse.
The sound cuts through the quiet again, this time a distinctive animal noise coming from the front door.
But the awful ride isn't even in the forefront of my mind. I'm sitting in Harry Potter lap. I'm sitting, indirectly, on his cock.Morgan and Morgana what have I done to deserve this. I can't help feeling hot and the alcohol in my system is doing nothing to dampen the effects Harry is having on my erotic regions.
And Harry has so many friends, so much support and love. What use would I be, a drop of oil in the ocean. Insignificant and unwanted.
And I've always been curious about my Indian half, having little experience with that culture. I've never been especially close to Padma and the only real interaction I had with her was the awkward date to the Yule Ball fourth year. It was nice to see her though and she, like many others, is getting married in a few months.
"I would tell you how good it tastes, but I don't think I'll be able to taste anything for the next week." I say, pushing my numb tongue against the roof of my mouth. It may be a good thing if I have to many more egg meals, I don't add.
Potter shook his head sternly, his birds’ nest of curls coming alive, "No, I was thinking more like a rent situation. I enjoy her company but you raised her, right? So why don't you set a price and I can pay you for her. Not necessarily rent to own either, you can keep her as yours the whole time."
I wait beside a bus bench, card in hand, for the bus to arrive at 7:45 pm precisely. The bus stop was only a block away from my flat, a five-minute walk if I took my time, and figuring in the slow-moving bus, I should arrive on time for my 8:30 job interview.
My lips twist in a helpless snarl as I continue to look at the ground, palms stinging where my fingernails dig in. I squeeze my eyes shut in efforts to bury the heat pooling there.
"He doesn't have to, Luna," Draco mumbles to the floor and I feel bad a moment before I remember my reasons. I can't pretend to be his friend when I want more, it wouldn't be healthy for me or fair to him.
Remembering the family owned coffee shop, I quickly decided on the other job. It couldn't be that hard to strip beds, dust, and mop. There was no machinery involved so I should do well.
Is this a date? It seems like a date, the lighting is intimate and Potter is gazing at me through his glasses in a way that halfway makes my bits tingle but mostly makes me nervous.
The lull of painting the walls flat grey makes the time blur, only interrupted some time later by a ringing alarm I sense from the wards.
The owl that was perched on his head earlier swoops down in a wave of feathers and lands on Potter's strong shoulder. Now that I’m closer it looks...not unpleasant but definitely strange. The small owls’ feathers are half molted, patchy bald spots showing on its breast, and its expression is that of a young crup. It lifts one clawed leg and holds it in the air, balancing on only one knobby leg now.
"I opened up a magical creature shop in Diagon. You have experience already with Tasha so I would be happy to hire you to help take care of the animals."
I jog up the stairs and enter my bedroom, the thick carpet masking my heavy footsteps. Tasha's completely buried up to her nose, silently sleeping in my old jersey. I smile at her cuteness.
This is so friggin late i'm sorry. For some reason this was a really hard chapter to write but one of the longest so far! Enjoy :)
I could have said any of these things and they would have all been true. But what would my opinion matter when the rest of the Wizarding World praises him, but a drop in the ocean of praise Potter must receive on the daily.
I turn and debate whether I should set the dinner at the kitchen bar or the dining room. The dining room was still untouched, dark wallpaper and table long enough to sit twenty. But this is Malfoy, he may think eating in the kitchen would be too informal.
I exit the house, footsteps lighter with the promise of tomorrow and the rest of me weighing heavy with the anxiety of yet another job interview to potentially botch.
Ron takes the oven mitts off his hands and snorts, "I'm betting two galleons he was a right ponce, right Harry?"
Draco looks at me with fire in his grey eyes, but it didn't burn like anger, but passion. "What do you mean you can't? Why aren't you like everyone else? Why do you have to be so
I shut my eyes tight, willing my member to go down a bit. It's not much to notice, but knowing my luck, Harry will register what's happened.
That was nothing like this. His eyes were crinkled and nose wrinkling as he complains about her tickling him.
. If you must know, I had the single worst interview known to man. My coworker hated me at first sight, I broke a machine, and the manager slipped and barreled into me in the resulting puddle. I've had a headache ever since."
Tasha's companionable hissing calms me enough to stand up and pat myself down, checking my wand and pockets.
"No!" I shout, pulling the scorching apron away from my skin, trying to untie the tight knot behind my back and failing. The coffee puddles on the floor quickly and I panic, shooting out a hand to slam the lever back up.
I cast the spell, throwing the weight of my magic through my wand until the stubborn stove quivers and gives up with a
The burning tightness in my chest softens its grasp. I'll be able to have my own place, to be on my own for the first time in my life.
I'll have to return her. The sooner the better. She's only a baby, her species living almost to three hundred years old. She doesn't have any control yet, not able to return to her body after entering my mind unless she's in close proximity and encouragement.
How different would this view be if the war ended any other way? The Dark Lord was full of hatred for the Muggles, far greater than any varying level of resentment the pure bloods held. He wanted to rule over the Muggles, not simply be separate from them.
"I used to, but he moved to Hogwarts when I took ownership of the house." Potter is...shockingly casual. I stare at his back clad in muggle cloths. He's filled out since I saw him last. But as every wizarding tale recounted adoringly, he was on the run for a year by then.
I follow blindly though my mother’s ancestral home, all dark textured wallpaper and missing portraits.
"I actually went for a job interview earlier and it went pretty horribly. I apologize for my ill manners towards you this time and last." He says this stiffly, language stilted and proper. I want to shake him back into his laughing self.
Potter blinks his bottle green eyes framed by those hideous glasses. I wish I could say they didn't do something to me but they did.
I wanted to know what was so vastly different about him, why I couldn't ignore him, why he wouldn't leave my brain.
After only four days, my mind is constantly coming back to Tasha. How she's doing. If Potter is taking good care of her.
Potter nods along and I move closer to the counter, letting Tasha slide her smooth scales along my hand and twist around my arm.
His hand around his cock. It's probably long and thick, his fist a loose grip as he thrusts up into it. Big enough he would have to prep a hole really well before fucking it.
"Potter knows best does he? No more wine then." I scoff and slump down in the seat. Potter laces his fingers together and rests his chin on top of the knot, doltish grin aimed towards me.
I stare at the door, slipping my wand into my palm as I creep, feeling ridiculous, towards the sound.
"Oh, hello Harry, you're early!" Luna sing songs with a smile while jiggling the skeleton key to open the flimsy lock. "Did you get me a sour cherry scone?"
I turn on the shower and wait for it to warm up as I begin the process of removing my fur coat as well as the two layer of clothing underneath.
. It's not to hard to imagine his legs wrapped around me and his heavy breath in my ear for a drastically different reason.
"She likes being around the other owls. I'm not sure how she would react to being moved to such a different environment. She's had enough trauma I think...we all have."
His grey eyes shift to mine, "I don't have a cat, I have a freeloading no-good pest. I've given up trying to be rid of her. Or him. I'm not sure of the gender."
"Stop it or I will ruin your face." I groan. Not sure if I want to hit him or kiss him. In a Muggle restaurant no less, what a disgrace I am.
I almost drop the plate on Tasha, tongue burning and eyes watering as the hot food sears my mouth. The plate now on the table, I reach for the ice water pitcher and pour myself a glass, which I gulp.
Where did Potter learn to cook so good? I swear the first time I came to Grimmauld he said that he was pants at it.
The walls were bare and stained where Hermione and I ripped out the old wallpaper and everything was ready to begin painting. Casting a bubble head charm over myself, I get to work.
Leaving Grimmauld Place, I walk without such anxiety and my pride intact, 500 gallons in my pocket and plans on my mind.
"So you don't have a job? If you want you can work with me. I have been meaning to hire someone but I've been too busy." She says to Draco.
Despite having enough money to go grocery shopping, I haven't yet. I don't know what to buy and the Muggle packaging is confusing, to say nothing of the money struggle when it's time to pay. The different notes and coins bring my heart to my throat and makes my pulse race.
Both of our plates were cleared but Potter shows no sign of leaving. With my current state I know better than to attempt Apparating home so I'm left reliant on Potter. With that realization, I gulp down the rest of my wine.
"I work all day at the Ministry, Ron, and both you and Harry do as you please." Hermione leans back in her seat with an exasperated breath.
It doesn't react so I slowly close the door and skirt around the perimeter of the room, shuffling over my bed to get to the kitchen where the cold box hangs open, avoiding the threatening Kneazle.
Harry shoots me an apologetic glance, "She's one of the first birds Luna got after opening her shop. Luna takes in rescues all the time and Matilda caught a stinging hex during the war. She's very sweet still but needs a little help."
She waits patiently and I curse my stupidity further, cheeks now on fire as I shamefully admit, "It requested a stripper and I didn't kno-"
Words clipped and bleeding together in rich tones, sharp and soft and I wonder what he would sound like saying my name.
Dean and Seamus just bought a house to live in together and when I asked how they were getting on, Dean got a suspicious look about him. They've been dating ever since the end of the war, which forged their bond instead of tearing them apart like it did Ginny and I.
"Uh- sorry if I'm talking too much. Just realized how bored you look." He rubs the back of his neck with one hand and picks at his napkin with the other.
I grab my wand from the back pocket of my jeans and pop my bubble head charm, rush out of the room, bolting down the two sets of stairs and down the long central hallway of the first floor.
"How much do you want?" He asks and I'm instantly aware of the state of my stomach. I haven't eaten anything but a single egg all day since my stock pile is running low.
I focus out the rattling window and watch Muggle London pass by. It was...rather impressive considering they have no magic. The machines flashed brightly and some sort of excitement buzzed in the air. Pedestrians walk quickly, some talking to each other, some speaking into boxes held to their ears.
I fix what I can, wetting my hair and scrubbing my face, but my robes I have to transfix into more Muggle looking clothes. I was never talented in Transfiguration, so the end result leaves something to be desired, but it's as good as it's going to get.
When the food is finished, I turn to him, "You don't have to. I won't be offended- I mean, we're not close friends or anything."
"Don't say her name!" Charles shouts and I peel myself off the counter, quietly extracting myself from the scene. Once i've scooted by unnoticed I make a break for the door. I pass the flock of young Muggles laughing on the sidewalk and continue running. Hot coffee feels like fiend fire lapping at my skin, melting and burning away my scars, on the back of a broom and the feeling of being desperate and saved but still scared.
I wonder if Potter set Tasha's terrarium up, if he bought her a new day lamp. They're probably getting along just jolly, Tasha not knowing when to shut her gob when it comes to Potter.
For this being the first Indian dish I've cooked, it’s a rich red brown and smells amazing. I'll have to thank Parvati if it tastes anything like I hope it will.
The muggle paper had a section where they gave out jobs as well. Most of the listing asked for a telephone call, which was a box Muggles got into and used a machine to talk. I couldn't quite figure out to make the machine work or where to enter the listed numbers.
It looked divine. Like a luxurious meal compared to the strictly egg based diet I’ve been eating. The colors are rich, deep reds and warm browns, peppers and spices enough to shock my half-dead taste buds back to life. It definitely wasn't an English dish.
If only this was a date and he hauled me home at the end of the night. To tuck me in beside him with a kiss and tease me about my lack of alcohol tolerance in the morning.
She beams and wraps him in an enthusiastic hug, "Come by tomorrow, it's Ollivander's old building, quite hard to miss. Now we have to catch the portkey, Harry, come on."
Luna cocks her head to the side at seeing Tasha and brings a hand to her smooth scales. Large dragon hide gloves are over her elbows and her clothes are mismatched Muggle and Wizard styles. She takes Tasha from me and holds her up to look consideringly at her blank face.
"Father b-" I cut myself off from my automatic response. No, in the end the only thing my father gave me was shame and self-loathing. "Yes. She's an albino Blue Scaled Whistle-Tongue."
possible per say. I didn't enjoy sex with Ginny and had never been able to...imagine sex with any girl like I had just done.
"His magic was extracted, remember? I hear that's as bad as getting the Kiss, except you live." I stated evenly and Seamus nods in agreeance.
. He's still Malfoy. But different. He's more...vulnerable. I just can't help but think that he was this way all along. I keep looking back and remembering moments where the Malfoy mask lifted. He saved my life at Malfoy Manor, if he hadn't done what he did who knows which side would have won the war."
I Apparate into my apartment, half convinced I would splinch myself with my magic being drained from a day of
I smile, pressing my face into my swan down pillow, because despite the annoyances, I'm safe and out of that damned carpet bag.
Unable to return to the formerly lazy afternoon activities, I shut off the telly and settle Tasha is my old Quidditch jersey for warmth.
And I need to deposit Potter's check into my painfully small account so I can transfer it into muggle money.
"I'm glad you're getting along, I don't like it when my friends fight. You know, Harry and I are going out in a minute. Perhaps you could join?" She says with a genuine smile, but I’m too caught up on the idea that hit me like a Stupefy.
"Dumbledore was already dying. It was all arranged with Snape, it was always going to end that way. What do you want me to say? That I'm mad at you for trying to stay alive? That you did what you had to do to keep you and your family safe? If you're looking for someone to shout at you and scream and tell you that you're an awful person, it's not me because I was doing all of those things but on my side of the war. I forgave you a long time ago, Draco. It wasn't your fault."
"Fat chance of that," Ron huffs, forgoing dignity and choosing to scramble out of the ditch on his stomach. One of the scarves has started to slip down his face. "If we get stuck out here, I'd risk even Hagrid's baking over starvation. We'll see who's laughing when you're begging me to share."
Neville frequently keeps up correspondence with Harry and the others; he's taking a year to travel abroad to study foreign magical plants and their properties. Harry has already gotten postcards from China, India and Egypt, all accompanied by a moving photograph of Neville pointing with glee towards his new favourite shrub. Harry really hopes Neville has come away from his experience with the last one okay, he hadn't appeared to notice the vines already winding around his ankle...
They're running out of time, Harry knows that. The Quidditch match could end at any second and they both have to return to their common rooms before too long. Harry reaches out to prolong the moment, not giving himself time to ponder over why he even wants to keep Draco here. They've never spoken like this before, not so calmly, not without one of them testing the limits of the other's patience.
Harry had bid farewell to Hermione and Ron that morning, seeing them off in their own carriage before he waited in the rain for an unrepentant and late Draco.
"I dunno," he says awkwardly, glancing towards the window. Chunks of hail are hammering down on the pane of glass and he briefly sympathises with how miserable the conditions are for playing Quidditch. Even in spite of it, he tampers down the yearning ache in his heart for the thought of wind biting at his cheeks and cold rain creeping down his neck, the flash of a golden snitch inches from his outstretched fingers. "Ginny is a great captain, she knows her stuff. She motivates the team, her strategies are well thought out, everyone loves her. She has the makings of becoming an incredible professional player some day."
were, or because of this great tragedy that happened to me. Strangers decided who I was going to be without giving me a chance to figure it out for myself."
Then one dot catches his eye. There is only one Death Eater whose name shows up on the Map and he isn't in the Slytherin common room.
"Has it been working properly for you since you got it back after - well, after?" Harry asks, already knowing what the answer will be.
"Ploddy is certainly enraptured by you." Draco informs Harry, tone purposely light and casual like he's hoping to try and talk over the past flickering between them. "Tell me, is there anybody you can't charm the robes off of?"
The Slytherin raps his knuckles against the desk to break the spell, pulling free of Harry's gaze with an uneasy cough. He gestures in the general direction of the grandfather clock that McGonagall keeps in the corner of the room without once glancing over to it.
. He says it all with his monotonous drawl but it's undeniable. Harry takes what he can get and laughs heartily, the sound flowing out of him easy and natural. It's loud enough to draw several more heads in their direction.
"I make plenty. Mistakes that have cost the lives of people I love." Harry says seriously and for a moment, all the light drains out of his face. Draco shouldn't have asked. "And I'll keep making them for the rest of my life - unless I start listening to Hermione more. You just have to accept that your choices might have consequences outside of your control. I think I'm finally starting to be okay with that."
When it happens, it's softer than Draco expects. Harry doesn't hug him like he's trying to squeeze their two bodies into a single entity the way his mother had when the Dark Lord had situated himself inside their home, nor the fleeting press of arms that Pansy would sometimes offer in consolation in the Slytherin common room.
"I will, although I bet you're going to lose your mind when I do. It's completely mental - time travel and a prison break
"Hermione gave it to me when we broke up for the holidays. There's a note, it's addressed to both of us. She told me not to open it until the 25th but I won't tell her if you won't." Harry explains, tearing at the edge of the outer wrapping to shake out two smaller parcels within. "Here, this one is for you."
"Bludger to the face." Ron explains, wincing as he readjusts his hold on the tissue. "Must've happened around the last five minutes. Dunno what that bloody beater was thinking, everyone else was at the other end of the pitch!"
Harry can see that Hermione has already forgiven Ron before she says a word, the way the crackling energy between them is swept up and away from beneath the covered bridge by the wind, lost to the stormy skies. She steps towards him, deep brown eyes unguarded and wide, standing on her tiptoes to reach arms around his neck. And Ron - Ron is utterly lovestruck, folding himself into her without a moment of hesitation, his whole body curled around her as if she's the only thing hinging him to this earth.
"Absolutely," Harry agrees wholeheartedly, making to follow Draco back up the stairs but not before giving the room one final glance, turning his back on that particular darkness once and for all.
Draco doesn't refuse. He slips one finger beneath the edge of the wrapping paper and peels it away from the spellotape, taking tremendous amount of care so not to rip it. A grey scarf spills out into Draco's hands, rippling with strands of silver that highly suggest the wool is infused with its own magic, all Hermione's practice knitting hats for house-elves paying off with tremendous effect. She's definitely outdone herself.
Harry pulls a face. Draco's quiet jibes sting no matter how prepared he is for them. "Don't call me that."
Harry is grateful for Ron's choice of topic, for the relief of not talking about himself for a change. It had been endless, the journalists would never seem to leave him alone. If they didn't pester him, they'd  go after Hermione or Ron. They'd hunt down Luna, or Neville, they'd hound Hagrid. They talked to school friends or people who happened to be in his year but never spoke a word to him, they even tracked down Oliver Wood to do a piece on Harry's Quidditch days. Wood had taken the time to punch the man squarely in the face for his trouble.
The house had been so oppressive that, when they had finally packed their bags the day after Boxing Day, made that long walk down the driveway and through the ornate gates, a weight had lifted from Harry’s back that he hadn’t even realised he’d been carrying. He had turned to look up at Malfoy Manor one final time before Draco’s hand had grasped his forearm to Disapparate, somehow knowing that he would never step foot in that suffocating place ever again. He hadn’t felt sorry at the thought.
Hermione's face drops. She'd spent a great deal of the summer searching for her parents, who had up and left Hermione's childhood home and moved to Australia in the time she, Harry and Ron had been tracking horcruxes. She'd had very little to go on at the beginning and as the chill of autumn began to creep into the sunny days, Hermione had started to wilt around the edges. Through love and sheer grit, she'd finally managed to hunt them down two months ago and had immediately flown out to restore their memories.
Draco looks at him like he's out of his mind - then like he wants to punch Harry. He glances around the corridor but they're alone. "You don't mention that. Ever."
“I’d like to thank you for the Christmas present, Granger. It’s handsomely made and gladly received.”
The rest of Harry’s time at Malfoy Manor had been uneventful, the near-kiss placed carefully inside a box to be kept safe until they were ready to return to it. Those drab and dreary rooms of the Manor were no place for tender moments and though greatly welcomed - indeed, even longed for - it had been ill timed.
"It'll be dark before we play at this rate, Potter! What else would you like to know about the apple? The orchard from which it was plucked? Its state of ripeness? Get a move on!"
He affords a cursory nod to Ron and Hermione before spinning on his heel and half running out of the Great Hall. Ron watches him go, mouth hanging open slightly, shaking himself out of the daze by the other students rising to start the long day of lessons.
A solid trunk, undoubtedly containing the boggart, awaits rather ominously at the front of the classroom.
, and Harry can't help but notice the anxious twitches spasming through Draco's taut body on the occasions where they overhear the gossiping drifting from the train.
or else suffer the consequences of thinking that our family could ever stand alongside the Dark Lord and disappoint him. Those were
Draco doesn’t sound nervous the way he used to when it came to facing his boggart. He stares down the trunk with a cool, shrewd gaze, wand raised in readiness. Harry claps him on the back - Draco rolls his eyes at that - and steps aside, allowing Draco to have the honours of opening the trunk.
With others though - with Fred or Remus, with Sirius - it is inconstant. One moment, he'd be able to bear it, he'd grow used to their absence and learn the new foundations of his life - because that is what it is. All this death around him has taken him back to the start, a place where he has to navigate the uncharted territory of living without them there. His life is changed, a new chapter full of blank pages he is yet to find the narrative for. The rest of the time, he just wishes he could let the pages fall back through his grasping fingers to one of the old chapters again.
If Draco had given Harry time to brace for the attack, it still wouldn't have been enough to prepare him for the force of the spell that strikes him squarely in the chest. It lifts him clean off his feet. His whole body skitters across the floor, coming to an ungraceful stop when he collides with the teacher's desk, the tower of sandwiches threatening to collapse over him. Across the room, Draco neatly catches the spiralling wand with his already outstretched hand, as pleased as his marble face will allow him to look.
"With respect, neither did you." Draco points out gently. "Though I’m certain they would be happy that you've found a source of comfort. I don't think they would begrudge you that, Potter."
working on it. I just think it might be a longer-than-ordinary chapter because I want it to be worth your time reading!
Draco raises his voice, "And sometimes that can happen without you even realising it? Even when that person is being so overbearingly nice to you when you've done nothing to deserve it."
Hermione had been less forthcoming besides offering a firm vow of support and a stack of books dedicated to the study of boggarts but that only scared Harry more. For some reason, he didn't want to know what was going on inside her very intuitive head. It isn't like Hermione to keep information to herself.
"Oh, hey - speaking of sneaking around, what were you doing leaving Gryffindor Tower last night?" Ron says cheerfully, tearing Harry's attention away from the knight.
The next afternoon while the rest of the school are reviving themselves over lunch, Harry and Draco meet outside of the headmistress's office.
now?" Draco splutters and his look of sheer indignation alone is enough to send Harry into a laughing fit.
Harry absentmindedly follows his friends, puzzled over this predicament dropped unexpectedly in his lap. He can hardly believe it but he's going to help Malfoy - that much he is certain of - he just wishes he knew
"Hold on, you're a - you're a boggart?" he says in disbelief, even as the undeniable screams of his mother fill his ears and his vision clouds around the edges. "What in the - "
Draco is attuned to Harry's thoughts. "Only the finest rooms for our guests. I suppose we're lucky to have been spared a bed or two otherwise you'd have been sleeping on an extraordinarily uncomfortable chaise longue."
"Is that you?" Harry murmurs, already knowing the answer, staring up at one of the largest portraits in the room.
Beside them, in the middle of the courtyard where a fountain once sat before it was blown to smithereens, stands a towering statue; a phoenix, wings spread wide and its head turned skyward, soars from ashes and realistic, crackling flames that turn the light rain into mist. Even now, even as a frequent visitor to the monument, Harry still marvels at Professor Flitwick's beautiful spellwork. Below, a sleek marble block bears the names of not just those lost to the battle of Hogwarts but every single person who died under Voldemort's reign.
Lucius Malfoy falters the second his eyes land on Harry, taking a step closer but he doesn't fire any spells. Every muscle in Harry's body is straining against the confines of his skin, waiting for the opportunity to spring into action. Harry has bested Lucius before, he can do it again.
"The portrait gallery." Draco dismisses with a lazy wave of his hand, indicating to the long succession of the Malfoy line glaring down at Harry with strong distaste. "I beg of you: ignore them. They're never pleasant, not even to me."
"Presumptuous, Potter, to think you could know me at all. A schoolboy rivalry hardly provides the grounds for personal acquaintance. You and I might as well be strangers."
"But I haven't gotten you anything." Draco says, grip tightening on the wand like he's waiting for Harry to wrestle it from his grasp now that he knows there's nothing in exchange.
Draco can't even bask in the glorious realisation that Harry Potter just accepted his offer of a date because he thinks he can hear a noise.
When Draco looks at Harry, he doesn't bother to conceal the tear tracks on his cheeks. He thinks they're beyond that, somehow. It would be impossible for his younger self to believe that the only person he can trust to pass no judgement for his actions is the boy he'd sworn to hate for eternity and now, here he was, crying in front of him.
"Where the hell are you going?" Ron calls after him, leaning out into the aisle to stare after Harry hurrying away. He's loud enough that several people have turned their heads. "Pudding is coming!"
"Doesn't your mum feel, I dunno, a bit isolated being here all the time with no one else around?" Harry asks awkwardly, following Draco down a dark corridor. It's chillier in the house than it is outside, no wonder Draco is strapped down in that restrictive coat.
McGonagall wavers and casts a glance at the teacher's table, towards the headmaster's chair, silently acknowledging where Dumbledore and Snape once sat. She stands up straighter, her voice growing stronger.
No matter how Harry looks at it, he can't see any sinister motive in Malfoy's activities. He barely notices him in lessons, he rarely sees him around the school grounds, it's almost as if he has stopped existing; it's almost as if he's a ghost. Maybe all Draco needs if for someone to help
"No, it's not that." Harry pulls off his hat, one hand reaching up to tug at his scattered hair before he can think about it. "I sort of promised Draco that I'd go with him to Malfoy Manor for Christmas..."
Alone and not knowing when Draco might return, the strain which Harry had managed to keep at bay slowly begins to creep in. There's a tightness in his chest that he can't control, a low simmering ache that spreads like fire from his heart and claws into his throat. His pulse is jumping like he's on the fringes of excitement but Harry knows it's something much worse than that, some underlying panic that will turn his head dizzy and empty his lungs of breath if he lets it get the better of him.
Harry can’t help the quiet gasp that escapes his mouth. He can’t help the plunging, ice cold shock of it as he stares down at a version of
Draco flinches at the name but otherwise ignores the mention of the Dark Lord, "When has Saint Potter ever made mistakes?"
Draco must feel it too because he carefully extricates his hand from Harry's grasp, that all too familiar stain of pink spreading across his cheeks before he has chance to turn away.
"They better get a move on, I'm bloody starving." Ron says, craning his neck to look up at the teacher's table. "Is Hagrid giving them a tour of the castle or what?!"
"We're a right pair, aren't we?" Harry asks quietly, hypnotising him with that discerning stare. He doesn't let up and Draco can't tear away no matter how much he wants to; Draco's whole world becomes emerald.
Harry knows that Draco is seeing exactly what he is, a perfect parallel of the last time they had been here together when Draco had come to collect Griphook and Harry had been captive; Draco's fear had been clear to Harry even then, his shaking voice barking orders through the locked gate with as much conviction as someone who had a choice between only this or death. He knows that Draco is seeing not just how close the two of them had come to something perilous, but how far they have both been altered since that desperate time.
Harry wonders how he can possibly begin to ignore them. There are hundreds, taking up every space on the wall so that only slithers of dark wood peak through, like cracks in a plate. Multitudes of frames, in all shapes and sizes, all bearing some variation of a disgusted face and the same white blonde hair that Harry has come to eagerly seek out.
"What about you, Harry? Do you think it's a good idea?" Hermione inquires eagerly, turning to catch Harry slipping out of his seat. "Harry - Harry, where are you going?!"
Harry stares hard at that dot, chewing the skin around his thumb as he ponders over what to do. There's the old itch that flares up whenever Malfoy is concerned, one that he knows will not be subdued until he's sought out all the answers to his questions, and Hermione and Ron aren't here to talk him out of it.
behalf and yet you still chose to approach me all those months ago. Why? Why do you treat me like I'm - like I'm deserving of it."
Ron pauses mid-chew, makes a show of thinking over her question. He let’s it go with a casual shrug. “...Nah. Probably not.”
"To sweep the floor with." Draco says flatly, smoothing a stray strand of hair back into its rightful place. "Flex your imagination a little, Potter. I'm challenging you to a game of one on one Quidditch, obviously. That's no Firebolt but it's the best I could dredge up."
"Potter has always been a sore spot, from the very first moment he rejected you. I should have expected as much from you, unable to attract even the attention of someone as worthless as a mudblood loving half-blood."
And it's so simple, unpolluted by their history. The kiss will never wipe their slate clean but possibility fills Harry with something as close to the sort of hope he hasn't felt in a long time. Draco pulls back and now, there is no trace of uncertainty to cloud his expression but instead a smile of his own, tentative and sweet.
Draco takes a moment to absorb that, clearly deciding that Harry is speaking the truth because he pushes away from the wall, making no move to cross the threshold.
There are times when Ron thinks of Fred and withdraws, privately grieving; Harry had accidentally stumbled, unseen, upon him and Hermione in the garden at the Burrow that summer, to see Ron sobbing into Hermione's lap as she brushed through his hair with trembling fingers. Harry had retreated back into the shade of the house, all at once feeling Fred's absence, not knowing what to do with himself. He'd felt numb. Lost.
"I didn't say a word." Harry says, stepping up behind the trunk. "Do you remember in third year when Remus Lupin taught us how to fend off boggarts?"
"Violet Dickinson, third year. She's alright but she's not as good as you, although maybe after a few games and a bit more training she'll get there. Ginny was fuming after the whistle was blown, she's still peeved about Madam Hooch not calling a foul when - "
"Mr. Malfoy, we don't have all day." she barks, giving the tin a final insistent push closer. Draco grabs one and clutches it in both hands, returning to stare at his feet while McGonagall sits back her chair and scrutinises the two students before her.
Harry understands that loneliness, he knows it. He'd spent all those years at the Dursley's without a single kind word, let alone the prospect of a comforting embrace. He'd never known what it was like to be hugged earnestly, sincerely, not until Molly. Not until the Weasley's and Hermione, or Hagrid or Sirius. He hadn't realised how you could be dragged back from the edge by a caring touch, how it could help you find your feet again when you thought you'd been spiralling through the air.
"And that that is a demand - not a request - from the Ministry of Magic itself in exchange for Mr. Malfoy's attendance here?"
Ron blanches, nods curtly without saying a word. Harry knows that there is too much history between them for it to be as simple as an apology easily accepted, that he’d never ask them to pretend otherwise but it’s a start. Draco already looks less aggrieved, plainly grateful for even this much. It appears to give him courage for further conversation.
Ron's former jealousy drawn out by the horcrux is a distant memory but it makes Harry want to laugh just the same, that Ron could think Harry and Hermione would have ever made a couple. The world feels right with Ron and Hermione, they've always made sense to Harry.
"You don't have to hang about, you know. I don't mind getting about by myself." Harry says gently. "I'll definitely call if I need you though." he adds upon seeing the disappointment on Ploddy's face.
I shouldn't have gone back to Hogwarts. I know how it looks to other people, the sheer entitlement of it all. I'm tired though. Tired of having things taken away from me."
Harry looks around the common room, at faces both familiar and new to him; two fourth year students arguing with a portrait about the benefits of mandrake root, Nearly Headless Nick describing the Headless Hunt with fervour to a cluster of awestruck first years, a muggle-born explaining in detail how a lightbulb works to her guffawing friends from wizarding backgrounds, Ginny shuffling past with a wobbling shampoo bottle balanced on top of a stack of towels and pyjamas. None of it would have been possible if they'd chosen to stay passive, if they'd lay down and waited for Voldemort to crush everything they held dear.
an act. Draco always used his father a threat because, to him, that was the worst thing he could think to inflict on someone. He deserves our kindness, not ridicule."
“It’s fine, Draco -” Harry begins, catching the disbelief flit across Draco’s face. “Well, okay, maybe seeing your own dead body is a bit jarring but it’s happened before, believe it or not.”
As if on cue, a shrill whistle rings out as a final warning to board and Harry pretends not to see the watchful faces pressed up against fogged up windows, feeling as if he could be under a spotlight. If Draco had wanted a conspicuous departure, he'd certainly found the most effective one.
Harry shakes his head, willing Draco to shake off the facade. "Come on, Draco. You don't need to do that."
Malfoy is fast. The ends of his robes are whipping out of sight through the passage to the dungeons just as Harry jogs out of the Great Hall. He has to take the winding steps that sink down below the castle three at a time, the temperature growing noticeably colder the lower he goes. He only catches up with Malfoy when they're in the corridor that leads to the Slytherin common room.
Harry has kicked off the ground and - even on the ancient Cleansweep - already caught up to Draco by the time he's seized the tumbling apple.
Draco doesn't hear Harry's call. He doesn't appear to have the presence of mind to remember what he is even doing. His newly returned wand slips from his loose grip and clatters onto the floor, rolling away beneath the book shelf. The sun is long gone, its light replaced with creeping shadows that snap tenaciously at Draco's heels.
Harry squeezes his eyes shut, fending off the next twist in his gut. "A word of warning would have been nice!"
"I like to think of it more as stunningly down to earth." Harry says with a shrug, shifting his legs to create space for Draco to sit. "I'm surprised you're here and not out on the lawn pulling gnomes out of the bushes or something."
Ron is still in his mud splattered Quidditch robes, dripping all over the carpet in the common room, hanging over the back of Harry's armchair to spy the pages of The Quibbler in his hands. He has a wad of clumpy tissue pressed to his nose, splodges of scarlet blooming like grotesque flowers.
"No, Harry." she says gently. "I'm not mad. We stopped working long before you felt anything for Malfoy."
Their losses had been great, personal losses that sat as heavy as a stone in Harry's gut. Voldemort had been defeated, his followers scattered and rounded up, and there was no reason to fear anymore. Yet Harry felt a wrongness that he couldn't explain, not even to Hermione when she'd pressed him for more. She'd told him it would be good for him to talk about it, that he would feel better for it - and he had, he
"And yet your best is never good enough." the Lucius-boggart derides, softly laughing. "You're always trying to play catch up, aren't you? Always second to Potter..."
Self inflicted isolation, too. He'd taken himself away from his friends, from all who cared for him, locked himself away in the darkest prison cell of his own making because he thought they would be safer for it. All that had done was cause despair and pain to all parties.
“How we wound up here. If someone told me seven years ago that I’d have a crush on Draco Malfoy, I’d have probably hexed them.” Harry laughs, ruffling his hair. “I would have needed to beg Hermione to teach me a decent hex first but that’s not the point.”
Draco finishes meticulously folding his cloak and rests it on top of the nearest desk. When he turns back, he stares down at the juddering latch of the trunk, the look on his face close to tamped down trepidation.
Draco seemed to understand that, too. It was only when they were travelling back up to Hogwarts in one of the carriages, Harry drowsy and eager for his own bed as the castle had drawn ever nearer, did Draco’s voice snag at Harry’s attention and reel him awake.
The corners of Harry's mouth turn down."You don't have to do that all the time, you know. Go all...prickly like that. It's okay to let yourself be vulnerable.
taken some getting used to. Their trio had suddenly felt like a pair that Harry was intruding upon when Ron and Hermione had began to date. Somehow, it felt like they were moving on without Harry, starting something that he had no place in. He didn't want to feel that way, he didn't want to be an obstacle in the way of their relationship.
It had been difficult getting Malfoy to accompany him to see McGonagall but it was a necessity; Harry had dropped a note in Draco's porridge that morning detailing the plan, only to be tracked down and whispered furiously at by Draco in the boy's bathroom about secrecy and boundaries. It had taken the entire fifteen minute break before the bell rang again for lessons to convince Draco that it would only work if the both of them showed an amicable front to McGonagall or the deal would be off.
Draco looks down; long brown fingers, bony like the rest of Potter, cover Draco's hand. He doesn't have to see his own knuckles to know they're bone white; he feels the cool bite of the metal beneath his clenched fingers digging into the skin of his palms. The warmth radiating from Potter's hand seems to be spreading through the entirety of Draco's body, leaving behind a pleasant tingling.
I've got to begin looking for another job tomorrow, get one of those tube cards for the underground train.
"Oh!" He yelps and I jump, shoulder hitting the wall as I clutch the towel around my waist. His grey eyes are the size of saucers for a moment before he slaps his hands over them, "
I set it aside on the bed and stare at the glaring snake upon my arm, physical proof of my unworthiness. The ink still moves within my skin, wavering and glaring back at me with buried memories like ice water soaking my clothes.
The only person that can Apparate inside this house is the Lord, which is me since I inherited the title. It seems Draco can defy the wards because of his blood connection to the ancient house.
"I haven't either. It's really, really good. And... I think they have Muggle Indian restaurants here in London?"
I found Tasha in her terrarium, curled up in Harry's old Quidditch jersey. The sight was more than I was prepared for, the intense desire to curl up in it alongside her was barely manageable.
Hermione softens, her fingers uncurling from fists, "What's the snake doing here then?" She shrugs off her purple peacoat and plops down onto the couch beside me, reaching for the steaming tea cup.
Many of the creatures are fantastical, not average wizarding pets but exotic animals with magical powers of their own. Like Tasha, many of the animals are rare or not commonly kept in homes. Luna tells me of all the breeders she has made friends with across the continent, how often she travels to pick up creatures, and how she recently became the most popular magical creature shop in Europe.
Draco bites his plump, pale pink lip, "I'm not sure I can accept. I've been avoiding Diagon and all things Wizard for my safety. And if won't be good for your shop’s reputation either, hiring an Ex-Death Eater."
"Oh Harry stopped by earlier with her and was quite distressed. I'm glad she's doing alright. How are you?"
The Zabini's were acquitted of any charges- they never officially joined with Voldemort and took off long before the war truly started. Or so the Quibbler printed in their special edition paper. Luna's father's mad theories have taken off since the war and they were doubtful to begin with.
"I enjoy riling you up and having a bit of fun after all the years of fighting. Nobody gets under my skin quite like you."
"Er, I dunno if that’s a good idea," I say, slightly annoyed at Draco for pinning this on me. But Draco is still...Draco and my cock's still half hard.
I'm greeted with a dirt pile and rat bones that had been hiding underneath the beast which I Scourgify with a snap of my fingers.
"Oh good, I'm starving." Draco searches the table, then falters, "I think they forgot to bring the silverware."
Another round of laughter persists and my fingers dig deeply into the flesh of my palms. Heat rises to my head until I feel like a steaming kettle because
Distracted, I shrug on the brown leather coat thrown over the couch arm and grab a pinch of floo powder from the bowl.
I sit up from the couch where I already had 'research' and tea set out, "He's not. He did come by last Saturday though."
Her presence is a comforting weight in my brain, I've felt it so many times before throughout the war while under a Crucio or when I retreated into myself as I witnessed the horrors of the Dark Lords table.
"Don't worry about that. The only way to bring change is to challenge it, you know." She lets go and smiles brightly at the both of us, "What was the purpose of the war if all are still not equal?"
The second time she tries the lever, it releases and I breath a deep breath from where I'm propping myself up on the counter and rubbing my head.
"You are such a pretty cat," I say with a loud laugh, rolling onto my back to look at the ceiling and remembering seeing Harry's smiling face. Smiling at me. So tall and dark and handsome.
Potter's laughing, hand over his mouth and green eyes alight with humor, "I'm so sorry, I should have told you it was hot." He apologizes and I manage a weak smile.
Pushing down the violent desire to grab my wand, I spin and stalk off down the sidewalk from where I came. The cold air does nothing to cool my scorching cheeks, aflame with a toxic mix of anger and embarrassment.
Draco blinks, then frowns, "I've been cleaning animal cesspools all day and now I need to eat with my
I try to send Luna a look to drop it seeing her unhappy frown, but she drops it and instead says, "Since you know about the Muggle world why don't you teach Draco about it, Harry?"
Once the snake is handed over, Potter lays her over his shoulders and wordlessly conjurers a Gringotts bank note and muggle ballpoint pen.
He glares at me but it holds no weight, "Oh hush! It's just I know what you're doing and you've already done too much as is. I'll never be able to pay back my life debt to you, much less anything else. You saved the bloody
If only Potter really wasn't home, leaving me to quickly slip in and out so I wouldn't have seen his wonderfully tight stomach and strong shoulders free of his messy Muggle clothing, a sight that will surely haunt my dreams. And fuel more unfortunate wank sessions.
Potter makes a hissing noise and I look up to see Tasha curling around Potters broad shoulders, pressing her tapered snoot into his ear.
Draco nods and a painful stretch of silence forms. I want to breakout and say, 'Draco, you're so pretty. I dunno when I started to think of you this way but I suspect it was longer ago then I care to admit.' And then take his face in my hands and kiss him.
How am I supposed to take a cock up my ass if I can't even fit my fingers? Maybe it'd be a good thing if Harry has a small member. Not that I'll ever experience that particular pleasure.
I laugh a bit too loud for what the rambling story deserved, but Harry's green eyes are fixed on me like I matter. He's so charming, subtly demanding attention in a way that's so magnetic. A warm tug in the belly, the urge for him to be yours. Or to be Harry's.
A strong wind hits me and my hair plasters itself to the side of my face and eyes. I scrape the annoying strands away and bright yellow light floods my vision.
Harry sits on the opposite side of the couch. "She's been eating those little mice that you keep frozen? She tells me when she's hungry and I figure that’s been working."
"Did you eat all of your food?" I ask the cat/Kneazle, checking it's food and water in procrastination of going out. Luna gave me a bag of Kneazle food since she hasn't rescued or contacted a breeder and it was gathering dust.
His pointy nose wrinkles, "Is the tube like the floo? And no, I don't have a bus pass. Only Muggles are offered one."
I look at him for a long second and he focuses his attention to Tasha who preens, "Do you have a Muggle bus pass? Or a card for the Tube?"
I can imagine another's voice say my name in an admonishing way, playful smiles and inside jokes passed around over breakfast. Brushing my teeth at night as another finishes up a shower.
Most of the cages you have a charm, shrinking everything inside so the creatures are tiny and their enclosures spacious. It's truly a brilliant idea, saving space and guaranteeing the animals have as much room as they desire.
Also, I don't think this will be a 10 chapter fic but more of a 15 or so. Not super long, but not short either.
The driver has the address pressed flat against the turning wheel and a queasy feeling fills me at the sight of his lone hand holding the wheel. Machines are zipping by and lit signs fill the road like candy jars in Honeydukes.
Dean looks at me as if I've lost my mind. Seamus elbows him harshly and sends him a pointed, stone faced glare.
"You're so good with animals." I blurt and shrink into my robes, still dazed and endlessly embarrassed, hoping Potter didn't notice any distraction.
I find a seat on the couch and watch the reunion, not being able to help my smile at watching Draco being so drastically different than...Draco. He actually looks 18 for once, with his usual solemn face and blank grey eyes out of sight and replaced by joy. I've seen him laugh before. His face pinched and expression cold, backed by Slytherins with matching expressions of cruel appreciation.
The front face of the Indian place blends in seamlessly with it's undeniably English neighbors, but for the large window showing the inside.
Harry nods, his eyes not filled with pity but understanding.	"I get that, but why me? Why not pansy or another friend? Or give her to a trained professional. She's rather a rare breed, right?"
"She's right," I agree and place a hand to squeeze Draco's shoulder once, "You don't deserve to be mistreated, Draco. We won't let anything happen to you."
The middle aged, semi-bearded man chortles to himself, then takes a cup and spits a wad of brown gunk from his mouth. A shiver makes the hair on the back of my neck stand straight up. Is the muggle man
I bury a wild smile and nod, "That is a good idea. I don't imagine Luna sells very many of the rarer creatures."
The heat in my throbbing cock becomes unbearable and I moan loud enough to echo in the shoddy room, spilling over the shower floor and imagine that dark hand speeding up, milking me 'till I’m over sensitive.
Potter's shadow envelopes mine and I glance up into his face to see him focused on me with a faint smile. Dark stubble defines his jaw and I can barely see the silver scar branching across his forehead for the untamed waves of his hair.
"Years of obsession. You can't deny your part either." He tosses out as if it were nothing, "Malfoy, why would you want me to have Tasha? You've had her with you since fifth year, you can't just give her away. And to me of all people?"
I bite back my uncertainty and the smile threatening to grace my face at Tasha's familiar weight, and thrust my nose in the air, "I'll be coming around every week to check on my...property to make sure it isn't being mistreated?"
The transfer of Tasha isn't an easy one. She's a smart snake, incredibly so as her breed is quite magical, and seemed to pick up on the switch of residence. She slithers up my arm faster as Potter lifts her belly to reel her in. Potters warm hands were perfect for snake handling while I had to cast warming charms on mine for Tasha's comfort.
I take the lift to the third floor and find Hermione on the couch, still in her Ministry suit, and Ron carrying a dish to the table.
I press my fingertip to the glass and it hits the glass with one of its reptilian feet in return, turning its head fully to the side to see me better, it's eye shining with intelligence.
Taking Draco to a restaurant didn't have to be a date...right? Just friends experiencing something new together. In a friendly way.
I snort, slapping the magazine at her, "Oh shut it. I think I want to do the kitchen before we start on the guest room. You should’ve seen the look Malfoy had on his face. Though it could've been aimed at the microwave, I'm not sure."
The back of my head slams on the counter before I fall to the ground, Tammy sprawled on top of me. I yelp, shoving her off, the coffee on the floor burning my back. She scrambles up and reaches for the lever as a loud as the machine starts a loud beeping. It doesn't give, so she bangs her palm into the side of the machine and it sputters.
Harry shakes his head, "No. I've been thinking of taking Matilda home though. She's not much good for a letter owl but she likes me."
My stomach is full of fizz. I feel like I'm about to be sick with nerves because Harry Potter is carrying me. This will probably be the closest I'll ever be to this gift of a man.
The cold breeze cuts through my robe but I barely feel it for the adrenaline pumping through my veins. I fumble with shaking hands for my wand, walking as fast as possible in the opposite direction of the road.
"You do magic with your eyes, Harry. It's the only logical explanation. You look at people and a spell is cast."
"Really?" I ask, gears already churning on whether I should bring it up to Draco or not. He never mentioned his friends before, but given he's been living in the Muggle world and it's already so hard to reconnect, he may not be in touch with any of the Slytherins.
I shuffle my feet nervously, "Uh, no thank you. Maybe another time? I'm tired from a...job interview." It's not a lie.
The owl, Matilda, lets out a throaty quacking noise and Potter steps back, "'Tilda, do you need some water?"
"You're very..." I stop myself from finishing the sentence. The sun hitting Potters eyes lights the green on fire, his serious expression of his handsomely rugged face offset by the feather still perched in his raven curls.
I stare open mouthed at the door he disappeared through, a sinking feeling at the pit of my stomach.
I look at him a second, then press a hand over my mouth to stop a laugh from bursting out. "Are you even
I unlock my door, stumbling inside both from the fire whiskey coursing though my veins and the dizzying after affects of a trip on the Night Bus.
Tasha's hissing is a soothing background noise and her presence is a grounding weight while I find a suitable spot to sit and manage my panic.
Muffin flattens it's ears against it's skull, eyes flashing dangerously. Crossing my arms over my chest, I say, "I've fed you and given you shelter for weeks now and I really don't think you're very grateful."
My heart thumps hard against my breast plate, eyes locked with Draco's for a second. He breaks the contact, looking back down, "I really liked the food and I wouldn't mind trying more. And I haven't quite figured out the bus system so it makes sense for us to go together."
"Oh don't worry, I liked it, I mean- I like you- just...I really don't mind, alright? Luna, hold on!" She stops tugging with all her strength, obviously peeved I'm not in such a rush.
His stupid eyebrows stay in orbit, "I didn't say anything. Though I was going to ask why you're here with Tasha?"
I mostly feel like this was a filler chapter while still allowing some info. I actually had a minute of panic when I sat down at my writing laptop and opened it up to there only being a couple of sentences of chapter nine. In that brief moment I thought I had already posted chapter eight and hadn't wrote for so many days. My brain broke lol.
"Is Draco Malfoy here?" Hermione asks, her warm brown eyes filled with shock. Tasha's tank was set up against the accent wall in the remodeled sitting room. The large fireplace she had come out of was one of two fireplaces with floo accessibility in the old house. The intricate fireplace is one of the only remaining remnants of the old room, the mahogany wood holding the same warmth as the honey toned walls and soft furniture.
He reaches a hand out and I slap it away, "Stop making this harder than it has to be, you twat! You really think I’d be here unless I bloody had to? I'm trying to be a better person and I won't let you take that away from me!"
"I'm drunk, Potter, I find everything funny." I lie smoothly and stealthily feel of his chest and arms.
"I've never heard of that type of magic, but I doubt I can do anything of the kind." Harry says, clearly amused
We sat in a circular booth next to the empty stage and caught up as it was about a month when we saw each other.
go, but I can't stop looking at his face and his shoulders, wanking in the damned shower over him. I want his hands all over me and I want to sink my hands into his charmingly disorderly mop of hair.
I sigh and reach a hand out to scrub the animals neck, "You really need a name, you unfortunate creature."
Harry stops walking and I nearly have a heart attack at how loose my tongue has become. I grab a fist full of his hair and pull it, "So messy you could never be a true threat." I say, rushing to cover up my blunder.
Guilt rots inside me, a simmering sick guilt that floods my throat like I'm about to lose my stomach. I'm worse than the crowds of pining witches fawning over Potter, desperate to sink their claws into the Savior.
The door rattles again, the ward magic flashes an angry red as it blocks the spell. Despite there being no one according to the wards, someone is outside that door.
I stumble as she drags me a few steps down the hall, glancing back at Draco who hovers awkwardly, I say, "You can stay with Tasha as long as you like, you know."
Only in my socks and joggers I hurry inside the old wandmaker's shop. Front windows are now full of brilliantly colored birds and ‘
It's a much better sight than when I went into Magical Menagerie with Hagrid where all the owls were in cages hardly bigger than themselves.
I can't help but smile at him. He's so comfortable, so bold, and I'm desperate to say anything clever.
The kitchen window had to be opened by breaking the rusted lock or else I would've passed out from the overpowering smell of bleach and vinegar by now.
With a final Scourgify of the capybara's filthy excrement pool, I toss of my apron and run to the loo. My appearance is just as bad as I figured.
She seems to assess me, then kicks her boots off and grabs another 'research' magazine from the natural wood coffee table, "I'm just surprised. You've hated each other for years."
Draco is even more pissed than I thought, face ruddy and eyes shining. His feet are unsteady and he's eyeing the icy slush around the gutters.
The water streams over my shoulders and back, Muggle shampoo making bubbles swirl down the drain. I climb out and towel off, hair clean and laying neatly before I button my white shirt.
My hand engulfs his, the shake a bit clumsy as he's left handed and I have to switch to my left clumsily so we match.
and I Apparate off the doorstep and into the center of my apartment where I trip over my robes and bash my knees into the hard flooring.
It's Thursday- Tasha Day. Potter invited me to Grimmauld this morning and I hadn't given myself enough time to over think anything.
So Draco's going to receive a shock! He's naive. And Harry is realizing his growing feelings :) At least he's not in denial but he's in a tough situation.
I find myself holding it carefully, slightly shaken that an amount that used to mean so little to me now means food and shelter. A measly 500 gallons can change my life.
"Look Matilda, this is Draco." Potter goes to lift the bird on his hand but it viciously nips his finger and he draws it away quickly.
I beat the door with the knocker until my arm is tired and I feel ice forming on my soaked clothes. My desperation turns to anger. And without thought, I fling a stinging hex at the door. Seeing my magic be absorbed by the wards, I huff a cold breath and send a jelly legs, followed by a bat bogey . The door absorbs the childish magic with an angry red ripple.
?" I hiss at her with a smile, kneeling at the edge of the bed and she pokes her head out to peer at me.
Draco looks as if he's worked all day, hair fluffy and there's a dirt smudge on the edge of his jaw. Something about this Draco is driving me mad with want. Because
"Well, a Kneazle showed up at my door yesterday. I'm not sure who its owner is but I can't get it out of my apartment. It's very...insistent." I tell her, but a strange feeling stirs in my stomach, like I shouldn't say anything about the creature.
"Harry and I said nothing would happen to you so you can take off that robe. It'd be easier to work with the animals without it anyhow." She says, crossing her arms over her bright yellow blouse.
He throws an apron at me which hits me in the side of the head before I catch it and level a glare at that complete
"I'm what?" Potter asks and takes a step closer. My heart drum inside my chest, beating erratically, and my eyes can't quite meet his. The height and width of him is enough to make me flustered, hands fumbling and my thoughts scattering like the mice for the tree roots.
Potter smiling was something I had only seen from a distance and he is so...such a bloody Gryffindor.
I abandon my cleaning efforts for the oven and quickly take the gloves off before getting out my wand, racking my brain for some spell that might work on the ugly beast.
I sit up and straighten my robes to cover my legs. The Muggle vehicle is gone as if I had never seen it in the first place. Street lights have switched on in the time that I’ve lain on the ground.
I toss my jersey onto the bed and reach for a old, paint-splattered T-shirt. Tasha immediately darts for the jersey I discarded, diving into it and curling up into a content ball. The whole 90 centimeters of her doesn't quite fit, the bottom half of her body hanging out of the neck.
That's definitely more than I thought. My Gringott's balance could take the hit though, after the war I received more misguided 'donations' then I could ever spend. Hermione has been helping me sort out causes to fund and businesses to invest in to help build Diagon Alley back to what it was.
Either the restaurant has risen 5 degrees or the alcohol is stronger than I previously thought. My face is warm and my hands feel somewhat detached from my arms. Potter is saying stupid things and I can't remember the last time I've had as much fun.
Her face turns pissed and she snaps, "I can hear that bell from my office you know. And it's never busy on a Wednesday."
She lifts a huge stack of the magazines and slams them down on the sofa cushion that separates us, making them bounce the slick covers sliding all over the place.
Sorry for the long wait (as always lol) I love all the kudos and comments! And the date will be in the next chapter so stay tuned ;)
The couch is old, ugly, and completely covered in blankets which Tasha has made a game of slithering through. The movie
But it was a start. No upstanding Wizarding business would take me, and without one of those Muggle driver's licenses it was my best option.
All the manners ingrained in me since birth leave me as I shove past him with a scowl, looking for Tasha.
"Alright, I'll be back here next week, same day unless something happens." He breaks the shake off and gives me a tight-lipped smile.
I feel sour, thinking of Potter as I have been all night. If this was a date, if he was carrying me home with him, if he felt the same way. It's a sadistic twist of fate that Potter acts this way with me for the sake of friendship and nothing more. He is truly to nice and it's unfair.
I was the Great Squid if it had been dumped in the Forbidden Forest; out of my element and helpless.
He glances down and takes out his wand to spell away the apron, leaving him in a rumbled button down and creased slacks.
I don't know what time Luna's shop opens so I decide to leave at eight which gives me plenty of time to worry about my appearance and cook three breakfasts- the first one having burnt, the second batch of eggs not being totally unsalvageable, and the third plate of eggs being for the Kneazle.
A pathetic sniffle escapes me and I grab my wand from my forearm holster and Apparate to Grimmauld Place.
I scrub my hands down my face and allow my arms to flop down so I'm eagle spread on my king size bed. I wanted a queen but Hermione thought it was ridiculous to have a queen in the master bedroom.
The bus comes to a jolting stop and I shoot off a goodbye to Harry as I launch myself off the bus, heart beating out of my chest.
This seems too good to be true, working in an actual Wizarding shop with someone I admire no less. There are too many variables that can go wrong to get my hopes up.
I giggle some more, halfway aware I sound like a drunk idiot but the heat gathering in my bits wipes those thoughts away. I crawl fully onto the bed and struggle out of my pants, spitting into my hand before touching the wet head of my cock. I whine but force myself to go slow and light and I wonder how Harry does it.
Luna goes with them to the Pygmy Puffs, but not before saying to me, "You can look around and get to know the animals. Harry's still out back with the owls if you want to say hello."
"You've met my nephew Charles, hmm? You'll be working alongside him today, learning the ropes and such, I'm sure the two of you will get along like two peas’ in a pod! You both are such nice boys."
"It's a miracle I didn't get spliced", I note hollowly, my voice frail. The old houses shift and warp to allow room for the magical residence, it's foreboding exterior warmed by a welcoming foot map.
The spell is one I found in the Manor's library before it was confiscated, before I received my trial and couldn't leave that blood-stained place. Not wanting to see my family, I locked myself in the library with only my favorite house elf for company until the Ministry recovered enough for a trial.
"I think some of the Death Eaters got off light. Lucius Malfoy didn't even go to Azkaban. He's in France under 'house arrest' at his vacation mansion." Dean thumps his fist against the table.
I remember clearly walking in the road, seeing the Muggle car, and then...waking up on the grass? How?
Charlies scoffs, then rolls his eyes. Dragging his feet he turns to get the manager, and to my shock, mutters, "Fuck'n twink."
A rich, well bodied smell comes from the new oven and I open the door to check up on the two dishes inside. The
I broke it off and even though she could see the way we desperately clung to each other wasn't healthy, she was still hurt. I haven't seen her since she moved to Romania to live with Charlie.
is playing and I'm only half paying attention as Tasha keeps nudging and nipping at my feet underneath the blanket.
My eyes sting with unshed tears, my heart beating at my ribs, hands shaking and nerves shredded. Needing a calm voice to sooth my leaping insides.
I accept the sheet of parchment back and ignore the height of the man looming overhead. Eyebrow raised, I attempt to exert my confidence as I tuck the paper into my pocket.
My vision blacks out, tension exploding into relief as my hand struggles to keep up and I’m unaware of anything but the pleasure flooding my body.
"Yes, there are so many damaged animals out there, especially right after the war. I can't take many of the larger creatures like Hippogriffs but other places do."
Completely unrelated but I have a frigging embarrassing story to share. I'm never telling anyone I know. So I dropped a nail polish earlier. In the toilet. It sunk straight to the bottom and I could barely see it. I grabbed a coat hanger but that only pushed it further in. There was no way to get it out and I was NOT going to stick my hand in there. So I was kneeling by the toilet, pulse racing with adrenaline while I tried to figure out what to do. I rationalized that if I flushed it, it would MOST LIKELY not break the toilet. It was smaller than a dump so it could theoretically flush. I turned on the sink in case there was a strange noise and then flushed. The nail polish clicked the whole way down but it flushed. I walked out of the bathroom like nothing happened but I can still see the mental image of that nail polish hanging out in our septic tank lolll. What else was I supposed to do?
Harry stows his wand away in his back pocket - a terrible habit, Draco muses - and comes to stand near Draco at the railing.
Harry can tell that it was once handsomely decorated but the raid by the Ministry has left much to be desired. He's thankful to at least see a four poster bed in the middle of the room, situated close enough to the window to gaze out at the expansive gardens. There isn't much else of note besides an empty wardrobe with the doors ripped off and a black lacquered and gilt desk bearing a fine china bowl filled with water and a hand towel.
"Yes," Draco agrees, grimacing. "Yes, I think I'm beginning to see that. You're eternally bewildering, Potter. The truth is, I
He's barely made it off the rickety bridge leading out to the school grounds, caught between half dreading Hagrid's rock cakes and half daydreaming about the golden platters of gingerbread in the Great Hall, when an unexpected voice calls out to him, jolting him out of his thoughts.
"Potter, I need you to understand that I accept my share of responsibility. I'm certainly no angel."
It had taken Draco a while to realise that he was spared being berated not because she was ignoring him but because she felt like he was actually putting in the work. He tried not to feel too smug about it whenever he caught Potter's eye over the table when Granger was launching into one of her lectures.
The gargoyle leaps aside, opening up the passage to reveal the spiral staircase. Harry smirks at Draco, who is quick to rearrange his features into something passing as nonchalance when he pushes past and begins the climb up the steps.
Draco briefly wonders what it would cost him to refuse. On his list of Things He Would Very Much Like To Do, hugging Harry Potter scores pretty highly. On the other hand, could he possibly get through the experience without feeling so embarrassed that he'd have to hide from Potter for the rest of his life.
It isn't technically a lie. He's been struggling to sleep at all lately and when he does, he falls into some uneasy dream that will always wake him before too long. He can shut his eyes and see all the things he desperately hopes to forget: Hagrid's hut burning up, the sound of Fang howling inside. The Weasley's huddled around Fred's body and knotted together in grief. Hermione whimpering and clutching at a bleeding arm in Malfoy Manor. Sirius falling backwards through the archway in the Department of Mysteries, a surprised smile on his emaciated face. Ron storming out of the tent into the pouring rain. A makeshift headstone bearing Dobby's name, nestled amidst broken shells and seaweed. And always, that flash of green light and the sound of Voldemort's triumph.
who I don't even know. He's the guy everyone stops, it's who they're looking for. They want someone that doesn't exist, not in the way that they expect. He's the one they're searching for, some - some hero."
there will be. He wants to brush kisses like blossom petals across Draco's pale skin, trail fingers like green grass against his face, his arms, his hair. He wants to whisper birdsong into his ears and wash away the last traces of fragile cold with sweet rain.
Coming up triumphant, Harry returns back to the bed and sees Draco staring down at Hermione's parcel in his hands.
They've officially broken up for Christmas and Harry is standing on the drizzly platform at Hogsmeade Station, having caught the Threstral-pulled carriages up from the school in a foreboding silence with Draco. Draco, it transpires, is not much of a morning person and as a result, not particularly prone to conversation - not that Harry hadn't tried. Draco was gracious enough to throw him a few one worded replies, shrinking back into the shadows of his seat whenever the light flared upon his drawn face.
“You know what I’m going to say, don’t you?” she says now, absent-mindedly twisting a curl back into her ponytail, her concentration barely stirring from the essay. “You know that I’m going to tell you that you could have spared yourself this if you’d joined me and Ron in the library earlier this week instead of napping during your free period?”
She looks at me, cocking her head, "You can give me your resume and I’ll take a peek at it if you really want?"
I really need this job. But I really hate that fucking twat Charles already. My Malfoy pride has been at my disadvantage my whole like, though. I won't let it ruin this opportunity too.
Why is he so calm? Where is the Potter I knew from school? I could always count on finding a fight with him but now...he's grown up and I’ve become a pathetic mess.
Sitting on the toilet seat, I try to fashion a wrap from toilet tissue and a sock, wincing every time I move my sensitive ankle. I should have taken healer classes at Hogwarts or at least paid attention to Madam Pomfrey’s seminar Fifth year. It would have come handy in the war, but I was too busy being a total twat, hatching schemes to humiliate Potter.
The food runs out and Butterbeer is passed around, and despite how nice it is being around them, just the three of us, I leave with a feeling of incompleteness and Draco taking up all of my thoughts.
She gets up and moves away from me, sitting down at the other end of the bench. How rude. Though not incomparable to how I would act when faced with the unprivileged.
The owls are in a large aviary at the back of the store, the space was a strip of concrete between Diagon Alley and the windowless backs of Muggle buildings. The concrete's been spelled to grass and a large tree sits in the center, fed both by magical and natural light. The birds sit on the branches and play on rope toys all day long, owls of all different sizes and colors coexisting until they are adopted.
I sigh and pat my pockets one more time to make sure I have everything; I won't come unprepared and if that means bringing two pairs of dragon-hide gloves, so be it.
I quickly eat the treat and before I can second guess myself, I walk to the back of the store and find a door with a large owl painted on it, probably from Luna herself. My heart leaps into my throat and my hand shakes as I pull the heavy wood door open.
I should have taken the Tube. I should have gone with the corner shop job. Or looked somewhere else that was decently close by.
The foggy air inside the shower makes my gasping breaths a struggle. Water runs in heavy rivets down my back and between my spread cheeks like how I imagine a warm tongue would be.
"Ah, so you're headed to the op'site side of town. You'll have to take a few buses to get there. Taking a cab would be faster but'll cost an arm and a leg. "
"That one's a Shiny Bellied Goliath. It's very bright, like you're snake. And so pretty. It's endangered because it's skin is often used in hair potions, sadly."
And on Draco's first day at Luna's as well. I just saw Draco, standing there with his eyes vulnerable and face unreadable. Looking up at me and cheeks flushed as he not-quite tripped over his words, that poncy accent of his. I've never met anyone but him with an accent so...unique.
She shrugs, "Perhaps. Your head is full of Nargles again Harry, are you feeling alright? I haven't seen cousin Draco since the Manor. He always gave me cookies and bandages, you know."
He puffs out his thin chest, "A Muggle coffee shop. I figured it would be the best shot as it's only a short walk from my flat."
"So does Saturday sound good? I'm not sure where you're place is so you'll have to Apparate to Grimmauld. Or I can pick you up after Luna's, it's your choice."
Hermione shoots Ron a look and he huffs before sitting down at the table. The food looks delicious, the smell thick and unmistakably a Weasley recipe and three plates and butterbeers were already set out.
Harry grins, twin lines framing his wonderful smile, "I know, right? People come in all the time to look at them. Like a zoo, almost. I told Luna she needs to start charging admissions"
"Uh, no. Something's wrong with Tasha and I Apparated straight over." I rush over to her in my socks.
I hurry down stairs to let her in and near trip when I hear my name called from the direction of the living room.
"I've never heard her whistle." Potter says to me, watching curiously as she lowers her considerable weight from his arm to the counter top and towards me.
I sit up and take a deep gasp of air, pulling the cheque from my pants and spelling it over to the rickety table before I get the urge to shred it because I don't
She beams at me, "Oh you're precious. I'm sure you'll do just fine with Charles here teaching you! Now, I’ll be in my office sorting through paperwork. There’re two doors on the left in the hallway, one to the loo and the other to the break room. I'll be coming in to check how you're getting on."
I shake my head and duck away, speed walking with my head down through the filling up street. I glance up through my hood every few steps to stare at the changes Diagon has went through and what new businesses have replaced the old. It's all so painfully familiar, sending me back to shopping trips with mother and catching glimpses of toys I was not allowed to have. The chatter of happy witches feels like needles against my hidden scars, a painful reminder burning itself into my forearm.
That year I stayed up all night to sew that Dementor costume, my fingers pricked raw and bleeding by the end of it. It was rather shoddy work but I remember being very proud, excited to get a reaction out of Potter.
Hermione nods, "Alright. If that’s what you think, I support you. But it'll take some time before I'm ready to forgive him."
Potter dishes out the food and I accept my plate from him, bringing a forkful to my mouth greedily, hunger winning over my manners.
His eyes are still wide, brain obviously processing this information. "Alright, I'll look into this Muggle tube train. Thank you."
A muggle coffee shop wasn't ideal. I don't even drink coffee, having been raised on the ever-sensible Earl Grey with the occasional expensive Oriental tea for variety.
The jersey I had witnessed Tasha snuggled in, I wonder what miracles it would work if I wore it. It would smell like Potter, uniquely worn from the planes of his body and soft from hundreds of washings. I would have to constantly pull the too-long sleeves up to free my hands.
She bustles out of the hallway and pauses with a frown, "Charles, I thought I told you to show Draco here the ropes?"
His hands grip my shoulders and I heft him up by his thighs, trying not to think of how closely we're pressed together.
"A while ago. There are so many creatures here..." I trail off as a large eagle owl, just like the one I had my first years at Hogwarts, took flight from the tree. The bird was massive with a wingspan that looked to be as wide as my own arm span.
I drag myself to my bed and fall on top of the mound of blankets, burying my head until I can't breathe.
The night bus should be illegal. It should have been the first thing taken out in the reforms, without a doubt.
My actual name, not Potter, though that too is something coming from his posh mouth. The two syllables a memory in the Pensive, when Draco would shout across the Quidditch field, in the corridors. Always to rile me up and it always worked. The never-ending urge to hit his Ferret face transforming into the confusing urge to cradle his sharp jaw and taste his lips.
this, I think while I scrub shampoo into my scalp. Despite what Draco always said, I do in fact wash and comb my hair. It's simply unmanageable and I don't bother with it most of the time.
And there, his uncertain sincerity, is the change I can't get over. If I could Legitimus inside of his head to see Draco without his rigid armor, see the full expanse of the light shining through the cracks in his damaged mask. Or even better, if Draco by some slim chance, let me see past the crumbling facade willingly.
"Hello, Draco," I say and step aside to let him in, he glances at me nervously, cheeks pale and nose red from the cold.
With the birds being so happy and free to fly about, they choose their owners instead of the other way around.
He's carrying me as if I'm no heavier than a house elf. An airy laugh works it's way out of my mouth and he squeezes my legs, "What're you laughing about?"
The Night Bus takes off and Draco turns green in the face as the beds shift and tumble about. He clutches onto me and closes his eyes.
Sitting on the ugly green corduroy couch at Hermione and Ron's, I turn my tea in my hand nervously as 'Mione sits down.
I shrug awkwardly and push my glasses back up from where they've slipped. "It's the right thing I suppose. And a bit of a habit."
From deeper in the house I hear the old grandfather clock chime and I count the deep booms to ten- giving me six,
I was a lot more thorough in editing this chapter! Also, I don't live in the UK so the language is not 100% percent accurate. I hope you enjoyed the chapter! And Draco's shower wank ;)))
I pry open the gallon of primer, a neutral light grey to be painted over with the baby blue later. I stir the dull shade well and pour it into a roller brush tray.
?" I shout, pulling Tasha from around my neck and wrapping her seized body around my arm. Even the jostling of Apparating didn't snap her out of her fixation.
Draco's half asleep, I reason, as I find a seat and sit him down in my lap. He's not awake enough to brace himself properly, but he is awake enough to gasp and protest.
I huff out a breath, smoke rising from my mouth from the cold, "Get on my back, Draco, or I'll throw you over my shoulder."
Hermione takes the serving spoon and starts dishing out the food, "I saw Blaise at the Ministry today. I was picking up papers from the seventh subfloor for the Mermaid case and apparently, he's been filing there since the Ministry rebuild started. He was very pleasant."
Charmed instruments played in the corner and lights danced and darted around the room. It was brilliant.
I have a pair of yellow rubber gloves on have spent the last two hours scrubbing the kitchen. The ancient stove has a cooked-on layer of grime a centimeter thick, narrowed down from the three centimeters I started out with.
The floors are stripped of dirt and my hands are scrubbed red and raw from the Muggle cleaning products underneath the kitchen sink.
I smile and follow her up the twisting old staircase to a circular room filled floor to head height with lighted terrariums, some large, some small. Snakes, lizards, and frogs of all sorts lay inside.
"Yes." I lift the steaming glass halfway to my mouth to blow on it, then realize, "You didn't ask me how I take it."
good. And rational and handsome. I envy him, the half-blooded hero of the wizarding world, savior of all mankind.
Finally, the door unlocked and Potter hauled it open, only for me to thrust a familiar white snake into his face.
I have not. Had any visitors, that is. I've been busy with renovations, investing, and it's only been a year after the war. Many students, like Dean and Seamus, paired off immediately, and some are already starting families. Hell, even Hermione and Ron moved in together.
"Come on," Potter says firmly and steps back to allow me though. I clutch my hideous bag to my chest and for some reason can't find it within myself to disobey.
I wrap a whole roll of the tissue around my ankle and foot as a firm padding before taking the sock and trying to stretch it over without shifting the tissue. Once it's on, I place my foot down and try to put weight on it with a wince. It's not terrible though, especially if I add a cushioning charm.
I wanted his insults back. His mocking jokes and defiant stares, when he still thought he was a prince and ruling by divine right.
"What does it mean?" Luna asks with a confused smile, tilting her head so her long curls fall over her shoulder.
"-so Hermione went into the girls lavatory and took her share of the potion, only to realize it wasn't Millicent's hair that she got, but her cats. She was alright though, just funny looking for a bit."
I need a job to get her back. Even with the hefty price I calculated for Potter's rent, I can't rely on him. I can't rely on anyone.
. What was I thinking that a Muggle job would be easy? My Malfoy decorum could get me nowhere in this environment full of strange machines and rude nephews.
"I never thought of going to one of those. I'd like to see how other people make it and... since you like it too would you want to go with me?"
As comforting as her presence in my mind is, I'd rather be holding her, utterly spoiling her in affection. Does Potter give her his affection?
The owl cocks its head and pecks Potter's face hard enough for him to wince and a surprised laugh is forced from my lips. Potter's soft voice has already melted my wax core, I feel my body relaxing and my face going warm, almost all barriers broken down.
"Don't you have a home to be at?" I call to the Kneazle. It's pitch black coat is shiny and I can't see its ribs though it's healthy. It looks young and was utterly ignoring me".
I laugh and his arms snake around my chest for a better grip. I try not to be paranoid about him feeling the racing of my heart.
I don't deserve such a job, but I'm glad I have it and I'll be Crucio'd if I let anything muck it up.
All cleaning, shrinking, and vanishing spells have had no effect on the oven. It seems to have been a part of the house for so long that it holds all of the same protections. Just as I can't Bombarda a wall for a more open floorplan, I can't alter the stove.
"It's a step in the right direction," Harry says firmly, pulling out a couple of chocolate frogs from his backpack. He lightly tosses one to Draco, who scrambles to catch it. "Here, eat this. I know it's not the same effect that dementors cause but you're pushing yourself, you deserve it."
Draco puts two and two together quicker than Harry gives him credit for. "A hippogriff on the - you know what? Let's save it for a while. I'll have to endure the anticipation but at least I'll be better prepared for when you tell me the surprise."
"Oh, for the love of god." Harry moves abruptly so that he's within touching distance of Draco, holding the wand still in his hand out once more in defiance. If Draco thinks that Harry will play along with this charade, he's sorely mistaken. "You don't scare me, Malfoy."
"Luck has nothing to do with it. It's you and your demented laughing! They probably heard you from Hogsmeade!" Draco hisses, pressing a hand over Harry's mouth to stop that laugh bursting out then and there. "You can't just laugh like a normal person, can you? You have to declare it to the world!"
The surreality of returning to a normal schedule washes over Harry. He's had the summer to adjust but that time was spent at the Weasley's, where Fred's death permeated every inch of the home. There had been no routine. Everyone had ambled around, startled when they bumped into one another. Meals were sometimes held in a solemn bubble, other times that bubble would burst and they could remember Fred where laughter and tears were never separable. The kitchen was frequently crowded but a chair beside George was always left vacant, and none of them could decide whether the sight was a comfort or not.
"I don't mind. I don't want the two of you thinking you have to sneak around behind my back just so you can hold hands without making me uncomfortable." Harry tells them.
Ron told Harry that he was barmy, that willingly putting himself in a room with an armed Malfoy and conducting the entire thing in secret was clearly a lapse in judgement but as long as Harry kept returning to Gryffindor Tower in one piece after their lessons, he'd be begrudgingly alright with it.
“Ron’s mum,” Harry says softly, remembering. “It caught me off guard that time, too. She was embarrassed I’d seen it, thought I’d think she was silly.” For a second, Harry is back in Grimmauld Place, surrounded by Sirius, Remus and Mad Eye Moody as Molly sobbed against the wall. His heart aches all over again. “I didn’t think that at all.”
So Harry waits. He watches Draco like a hawk through the evening meal, hardly touching his steak and chips, occasionally offering reactions to conversation so Ron and Hermione don't jump down his throat for not seeming like himself.
Draco surges backwards, almost propelling himself from the bed before turning to Ploddy with bright red cheeks. The house elf is stood in the doorway, a children's knitted Christmas vest thrown on top of his uniform in celebration of the holiday. Silver bells have been stitched in place of the buttons.
practice with the slimmest possibility of interruption. If it weren't for the occasional waves of noise rolling from the Quidditch pitch, Harry would think he and Draco were the last two souls left in the world.
Harry feels the pang of guilt in his stomach at that. "I know, I'm sorry. I should have told you sooner but it came out of nowhere, I didn't know what to say."
"Oh - uh - cheers, Ploddy." Harry says sheepishly, reaching down to shake the house-elf's full hands as best as he can. "It's really good to meet you, too."
Draco doesn't say anything, the only acknowledgement to Harry's words is a muscle jumping along his jaw. Harry decides not to press the issue, instead marvelling at the long gallery they've entered into, unnaturally bright with its wide windows allowing daylight to spill in when compared to the rest of the Manor thus far.
Sixth year had put an end to it, the sight of Draco writhing amidst the pink-tinged water of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom had made sure of that. Screams of agony subsiding into gurgling sobs. Garbled words lost as Draco slipped from consciousness. Harry's vision singling down to those scarlet slashes in a crisp white shirt. Harry had done that to him. It had zapped him out of the paranoia and madness so that he could finally see Draco for what he was: a desperate boy complicated by family beliefs and his own learned prejudices.
Ron rolls his eyes as if he's put-upon by having to explain this to his best friend. "Yes, you were! You were doing that flirting thing you do."
Potter, naturally, is stumped by the question. As if it had never occurred to him why he was so eager on befriending an ex-Death Eater - because it probably
Their journey progresses faster with Hermione in front, even with new snowflakes falling heavier than before. By the time they reach the cover of the rickety bridge, all three of them are dusted over with white and shuddering in heavy, damp clothes, the path Hermione had forged already lost beneath a fresh blanket of snow.
Harry knew the name though. He knew it as well as he could recall the final sound Lord Voldemort ever made as his body hit the earth with a resounding thud. Human. After everything, all he had been was human.
"I was there, Draco. Dumbledore had immobilised me, I couldn't move - couldn't speak. All I could do was watch."
"Everything has always gone wrong around me. It's like, sometimes it's like the earth is exploding under my feet and I have to find a way to stop it. I feel like I'm just trying to find a ledge to hold onto or something."
"You're nothing alike. You're your own people. It's easier talking to you about some things - things that I couldn't really say to Ginny. Ginny, well, she didn't really - "
Harry stares down at his lap, fiddling with the laces on his shoes. He'd heard those words before about Dumbledore's faith in Snape from so many people yet it had never been good enough for him. Is it possible or right to believe in someone else's judgement so definitively that you disregard your own doubts? Harry had been wrong about Snape for the most part; he'd been a bully, he'd been cruel - but he'd been helping Harry all along.
It seems as if he's always going to be chasing after Draco in one way or another, Harry reckons as he dashes down the steps and outside into the grey day. Will he always be looking out for the glint of blonde hair in the darkness, listening out for fading footsteps that seem to persistently evade him? Pinning down Draco is like trying to hold onto starlight but Harry is quite unable to keep himself from attempting it.
"I took the day off." Draco says blithely with a quirked brow. "I'm told people do such things when there's a holiday. Besides, I've already made all the arrangements for lunch tomorrow so consider my schedule cleared for the day. I apologise for not being around often, Potter, I know there isn't much here to entertain when left to your own devices."
Draco tilts his head, squinting at Harry like he can't completely make him out in the dark. Minutes crawl by like this, enough for Harry to start fidgeting under the intensity of it, until finally Draco lets out a sigh so quiet Harry isn't at all sure he'd even heard the sound. Draco pushes off from the wall, stopping only to retrieve his bag.
He doesn't want any of it; he'd been offered an Order of Merlin, First Class the week after Voldemort had died, when the wizarding community had begun to accept that the threat which had long since lurked over them was at last gone. For them, it was as if the air had cleared of a perilous smoke and they were able to breathe freely again. He turned the Order of Merlin down. He encouraged Ron and Hermione to take theirs. He felt that they deserved the recognition far more than he ever did - than he could ever want - and it was something of a respite to celebrate what they had done, what they had
Leaving the Fat Lady's protests behind in the darkness, Harry keeps a close eye on Malfoy, periodically pulling out the Map to see if anything has changed.
Because if Draco claims to be made from the winter, then Harry - Harry will be the spring. Harry wants to deliver the sun and release Draco from that ice to find crystal clear waters running beneath, bright and warm, just as he
High glossy beams of dark wood contrast with the black and white floor tiles, every surface made to pick up the slightest noise and echo it back to the anxious guest at three times the volume. It's opulent, to be sure - but it's cold, without any warmth to it. Harry has to suppress a shudder of discomfort at the impersonality of it. Even the Dursley's house bore signs of familial love, even if they had neglected to include Harry.
"I know what you meant, Ron." Hermione bristles, eyes bright. She hastily wipes the back of mittened hands against her cheeks, allowing the wind to whip her corkscrew curls into her face. "I already explained to you that I need to be with my parents this Christmas. It was hard coming back to school but they understand that I have to do this. I thought that maybe after everything, you'd support me too."
Harry barely waits for Draco to turn in the midst of his gloating. He draws in his shoulders, butting into Draco with everything he has, a move that would have Oliver Wood weeping with unbridled pride and Madame Hooch disqualifying him from a match in an instant.
"Can you even bring yourself to see it, Potter?" Draco asks, his flint eyes wide and manic, shaking Harry by the arm hard enough to rattle his teeth. "Do you dare imagine the living nightmare of navigating your own home in fear of happening upon the greatest dark wizard of our time? Don't pretend you're any better than I am. You think your path to the brave and true was the only one which held any hardship? That my family were suffering less on our side of the war? Do not presume for one second that we had it easier. You made your choice and we made ours."
"I wish - " Draco breaks off and shakes his head. No good wishing for history to rewrite itself, his mother had taught him that.
"So tell me; is that adequate enough information for you? Are you satisfied with the root of my fear so that we may continue henceforth without you accusing me of holding back? Now run along to your common room, Gryffindor. I'd hate for you to be stuck out here with the like of me."
"I would tell you that it depended upon what that something is." McGonagall says shrewdly, peering over her glasses at them. The glance isn't as effective as Dumbledore's was in making you think your mind was being read but it's a close thing.
" Ron says in satisfaction, celebrating by dumping custard on his apple pie while Hermione silently glowers beside him.
"I suppose it's instinctual after the year I've gone through." he says, offering the ghost of a smile to let Harry know order was restored.
"It sounds like something you'd do, you seem to enjoy vexing me. Being boyhood adversaries lost its charm, has it?"
"Shut up, Malfoy. It's usually something to do with sweets - or it was when Dumbledore was headmaster." Harry adds in a mumble.
"Maybe you Slytherins should learn to calm down a bit." Harry breathes, pulling at Draco's chin to press a clumsy kiss to the sharp lines of his mouth, feeling them turn pliant and willing at Harry's touch.
“I think it makes perfect sense. She loves you so much that the thought of you being dead became such a demanding fear, one she couldn’t ignore.”
"It truly astounds me that you've talked me into this." Draco drawls, shifting his face out of a patch of sunlight pouring in through a nearby window, leaning beside the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to the office.
"Come off it!" Harry scoffs, glasses slipping slightly down his nose. Draco resists the urge to push them back up. "Besides, I want to hear exactly how much more than
Harry understands the cost of isolation. After Cedric's death, after Voldemort's return, he'd strained for any news of the wizarding world. It had seemed like everything had blown away like smoke, leaving him behind choking amidst smouldering ashes and charred wood. No matter how hard he had tried to dig through it all, no matter if he found the smallest spark of news, it would die in his hands and he'd be left all alone again. That is, until the dementors came to Little Whinging. He'd been almost glad to see them, to see some confirmation that magic still glowed beneath the murky debris.
"Yes. We have Ploddy - that's our house-elf - a chef and a gardener. Ploddy takes on most of the responsibilities in the house and he has freedom to come and go as he wishes although he never really does. He does take Sunday afternoons off, at my request."
"Yeah." Harry says, eyes following the slouching figure of Draco Malfoy as he is surreptitiously led out of the Great Hall by Slughorn. The sound of whispers, volatile and sinister, grow louder as he leaves the room. "Yeah, I reckon you're right about that, Hermione."
And Harry? Harry finds himself no longer pitying Draco but rather admiring him. It takes nerve - an unquestionable practicality too - to not only throw yourself back into schoolwork amongst peers who hate you at worst and distrust you at best, but to allow yourself to be vulnerable to a person you've actively fought against for the past seven years. If their positions had been switched, if Harry had been the one faced with a choice of struggling on his own or opening up to Draco's scrutiny, he's not sure he'd have had the sense to humble himself as Draco had.
"Hmm, yes - hmm. Ron, my mistake." Slughorn blunders, looking mildly embarrassed. "Ah, and Harry? Tell Mr. Filch to bring that mop of his, will you? I rather believe we're going to need it."
together either." Harry chips in half-heartedly, his attention returning to Draco. The pull of the other boy is like the force of a magnet; no matter how hard Harry tries, Draco is always there under his gaze.
Draco speaks slowly, clearly. "I resent the fact that I have to be the one to tell you this but you're not this great disaster that you think you are."
Ron is unperturbed by the waves of whispers lapping around him, a resilient island against the current of gossip and awe. If his grin for Harry is warm, the one he shoots Hermione is radiant. It hurts Harry a little to witness that unadorned affection, not out of spite but of longing.
"Good, that's really good. Now you have your wand, do you think you're ready to try out the boggart?"
what he pictured; cheerless hallways, grey and sombre, not a single bauble to be seen in any of the hundreds of rooms. Draco had warned him about his errands and Harry had accepted the invitation to the Manor knowing those terms - but still, he found the silence here to be deafening when Draco was off making adjustments to the chef's menu or chasing down rogue peacocks in the orchard.
Harry wanders until his sights come to rest on a familiar passage, one that Draco had deliberately paid no heed of to spare Harry of - pain? Disgust? Terror? With measured steps, Harry takes the narrow stairway leading down toward the dungeon, passing beneath the lit brackets crackling with blue magical flames.
There had been a lull in news of Draco Malfoy after the outrage had died down, until of late. The word had begun to spread from unnamed sources that he would be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his final year. Harry expects the backlash will be tenfold what Malfoy had received during his trial.
"Look, I meant what I said, you know. I can leave you alone outside of the boggart lessons. I know how all of this - " Harry gestures at himself, to the wider expanse of the school beyond them and the other students hidden within. " - I know how hard it can be to take. I know that I turn everything to ash."
Ron is sulking, stirring the last dregs of his shepherd's pie around on the plate, squashing peas with the back of his fork. "No! I'll have you know I've been coasting by on your notes for years now..."
Harry grins, oblivious to the turmoil bubbling away in Draco's stomach, and resumes his absurdly enthusiastic climb.
"Well, um - I - " Harry stutters, his mind on Draco. Who knows what he could be doing while Harry is stuck up here in a dispute with a painting. "Look, I'm really sorry but I have to go."
When Draco backs away and disappears to his mother's parlour, Harry fits a hand over his cooling cheek, replacing Draco's warmth with his own, thinking maybe Draco doesn't need him to be the spring after all.
"Uh, sorry to interrupt but - " Harry begins, glancing about the staff room in search of the caretaker. Beyond its large circular table and several chintz armchairs, the shelves lined with tasteful clutter and outdated Witch Weekly magazines, his eyes come to land on the familiar sight of the wardrobe they'd encountered in third year during Remus's lesson on boggarts.
The boggart doesn’t gracefully rise out of the trunk in the form of Lucius Malfoy this time, as it was previously accustomed to doing. Harry cuts a confused look to Draco for a split second, attention drawn back to the boggart as the trunk flips onto its side, the lid flinging open to expel -
"Potter, it's like this at my mother's insistence. We let go of the rest of the staff because - " Draco cuts himself off, glancing at Harry with uncertainty.
"Fine, you don't want to be friends! I still need to know what's going on inside your head, Malfoy, how else will I be able to help you!"
The Fat Lady smooths down the front of her pink silk dress and narrows her eyes at him, "Beg your pardon but the length of time in which you are gone does not negate the fact that you are out of bed when you shouldn't be! I'll be informing the headmistress of this!"
"We could chuck some of Hagrid's mince pies? It might shed some weight and you'd stop sinking into the snow." Harry suggests instead, opting to wait for Ron to free his buried legs from an unexpected dip in the ground before adding the burden of his news to Ron's weary shoulders.
"I heard you blathering about visiting Hagrid to Granger during lunch. You should practice your indoor voice if you'd rather no one overhear your plans, Potter. Making yourself scarce hardly lends itself to your lifestyle though." Draco bites back, pushing past Harry and storming off in the direction of the Quidditch pitch, his cloak billowing out behind him in the winter wind.
There had been something so recognisable in Draco's expression in that Muggle Studies storeroom; some incensed desire to overcome, something that looked so painfully at a loss as to how to do that.
they ignore each other if they see one another around school. Well...Draco makes a point of ignoring Harry's friendly wave or smile, his eyes always sliding over and past him so often that Harry figures he might as well be wearing the invisibility cloak for all the acknowledgement Draco affords him.
Harry has just finished telling them about his Christmas, surreptitiously skipping over that near-kiss. He’s decided there are some things that he’d like to keep to himself.
Draco hardly lifts his eyes from the clean lines his hands are making of the cloak and nods, "Vaguely."
Draco twirls the wand between his fingers, a contemplative look on his face. "Who would have thought that this twig fought off the Dark Lord's most loyal followers - fought off even the Dark Lord himself..."
Harry runs a hand through his already untidy hair, ruffling it into a state of utter chaos. Draco hates him, from the tips of that preposterous hair down to the feet decked out in trainers that are practically falling apart at the seams. He hates him so much that it circles back around to love again. Hopeless, desperate, unrelenting love.
He's grown immensely tired of the charade. To Harry, it's as if it sets them back three months. It treats the boggart lessons as just that, just a temporary arrangement even though for a while now, Harry has started to hope for something more, something like friendship. He hasn't an ounce of resentment left towards Draco and this union of convenience has become redundant to him. Of course he still wants to
When Draco persists to act like Harry has suddenly ceased to exist, racing as if hounds were snapping at his heels to the Slytherin common room, Harry resorts to his last chance.
"No, I guess we're not." Harry concedes sheepishly, turning back to Draco who is still studiously watching the ceiling.
The dank dungeon is exactly as Harry recalls it; he can only just stand in the middle of the room at his full height, the low ceiling brushing the tips of his hair, and it's as if he's journeyed back in time some several months.
The Slytherin is tense, one hand gripping the strap of his satchel, the other nervously wrenching at the knot of his school tie.
"And - and I can't break out of this thing. Ron and Hermione call it my hero complex." Harry admits hesitantly. "I keep waiting for everything to come apart again - like, I can't really relax a lot of the time. I think Ginny could sense that too, she's always been able to see more than what I was giving."
Harry makes himself spring into action, moving to stand in front of Draco. The boggart-Harry is gone with a blink, now once more the all too familiar towering shape of a dementor.
"No!" Harry says, aghast. "No, not exactly. More like, she didn't understand why I couldn't...let everything go - it was just as hard for her but I - I just - there's something I couldn't shake off. Like, I knew that we'd never really be happy together for long. God, it felt like we were just trying to keep up appearances for the sake of it even though our hearts weren't really in it anymore. This - this isn't coming out right at all, I sound like a right old git."
"Remember, write us when you can!" Hermione had said, leaning out the window to press a kiss to his cheek. She'd pushed a neatly wrapped parcel into his hands and then, more hesitantly, "I hope you have a nice Christmas. Don't open that until the 25th."
“You’re infuriatingly decent. It’s maddening, Potter. You’re so nice that it completely disarmed me. Do you know why I agreed to these boggart lessons?”
Against his own wishes, his body betrays him and draws him in. With a rusty creak, the gate swings open under Harry's light touch.
"If you say I didn't want to do it one more time, Potter," Draco threatens. He grabs at Harry's arm, indicating to the names cast into the marble, hopelessly frenzied. "These people who died - I played a part in that. I may not have raised my own wand to them but I was one of the catalysts that led to their deaths."
"Great, cheers for that. I hope you got it out of your system because that's the last time you'll ever get to do that." Harry winces, gingerly probing his skull to check for any bumps. "Can I have my wand back now?"
There's a heady break between their words, a moment where they stare at each other from across the dungeon, Draco framed by the soft glow trickling down the stairway, his shadow stretching across to the edge of the pool of light at Harry's feet - and Harry can see everything Draco is feeling because though he tries his best, he can never conceal his emotions entirely.
A dark look passes over Malfoy's face, "That loathsome caretaker stopped me on the moving staircase. He wanted to know why I wasn't going to dinner with the rest of the school and he refused to believe my note from McGonagall was legitimate. The oaf dragged me all the way to her office and demanded to hear it from McGonagall herself before I was allowed to leave. I suppose you thought I was getting cold feet about our agreement?"
Harry lets out a breath he hadn't known he'd been holding, the tension ribboning out of him in one go.
Draco looks ready to vomit, white teeth anxiously chewing his bottom lip raw. Harry forces himself to look away from that but Draco won't even meet his gaze.
"Next time?" Lucius laughs coldly, fingers lightly tapping against his cane. "Do you think I would be so stupid as to let you nearly ruin everything again? No. I think not, Draco..."
"What's with all the questions?" Harry bristles, violently yanking up the zip on his hoody. "I thought you weren't here to be friends."
"One more thing..." Harry reaches behind him and beneath his pillow, and draws out a wand. 10". Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Draco's wand. "I figured after everything, you deserve this back permanently. Just, uh, do me a favour and don't mention this to McGonagall or she'll kill me. Happy Christmas, Draco."
Draco shoves his palm hard against Harry's chest, sending him stumbling into the wall. "I said no deal, Potter." He hisses, staring at Harry for a long minute, the sound of their mingled breathing loud in the dungeon corridor.
THESE ARE MY CONFESSIONS: by dint of an ongoing battle between me and technology, I lost basically all of my chapter outlines/chunks of stuff I was really freaking happy with for this fic
"No, I don't." she says slowly. "I think if we'd come back a year from now, it would still be just as painful. I think I want to - to heal and replace last year with something better."
"When you see that boggart take the form of your dad, concentrate on turning it into something ridiculous. It's all about facing your fear and laughing in its face, that way it has no power over you." Harry explains in way of refreshing Draco's memory. "Even the things we're scared of the most have limitations to their hold on us. We can grow beyond a lot of our fears, it's just a matter of being ready to do that."
"Yes, you did. You know how I feel about that stuff, you were going for the jugular. It's your defense mechanism."
" Hermione scolds, mortified. She looks between Harry and Ron in a panic, her voice high. "I didn't say it like that, Harry!"
He doesn't rush back to class though. Instead, he idles, letting thoughts swirl around his head uninterrupted by Slughorn's incessant chatter or Hermione tutting in his ear whenever he begins to daydream. Seeing that wardrobe has struck Harry down with an idea; perhaps it might turn out to be a fruitless one but he can't dislodge the image of Draco crying on his knees out of his brain. Maybe Draco, like Sirius, needs to be seen from a new perspective. He feels like he owes Draco to at least try.
"I don't know what to say." Draco confesses, breathless as he runs a finger over pearlescent strands.
itself had not been forgotten. It had been used as a bargaining chip for his only son and they had gotten away with it.
"You're right, I was being bloody selfish." Ron finally sighs. "You want to be with your parents for the same reason that I wanted you to be with me - you're family, you both are." Ron adds, shifting to include Harry. "I was stuck on the idea of making this Christmas perfect - knowing that Fred won't be there and - I just wanted everything to feel normal. I'm sorry that I didn't listen to you."
"Showing off?" Draco asks casually, feeling a twinge of jealousy that he's never been able to master this particular spell.
Harry wants to wince the moment he asks. It was a knee-jerk reaction, to think Draco has only approached him in the open like this because something has gone terribly wrong. It’s evident Draco is thinking along the same lines because he shakes his head, a small quirk about his mouth that might hint at a smile if the rest of his face wasn’t so sober.
Every corridor bears garlands nestling twinkling fairies and shiny holly berries, wreaths hang from every classroom door, piles of Christmas crackers two feet tall sit like small mountains on the tables. The suits of armour had even proffered candy canes to students until Peeves tampered with them and caused them to launch the sweets at anyone passing by, sharp striped missiles cheerfully ricocheting off walls, bags and unlucky heads. It became so bad that students and teachers alike began avoiding those particular corridors altogether, too wrapped up in the Christmas spirit to do anything about it.
Harry lets himself sag against the wall, fighting hard against the buckling in his knees to keep upright. He's glad McGonagall had no qualms for him - or any other student whose life had been disrupted last year by Voldemort's reign - to come back, to return to complete his studies. He really is. It's all just a little...too much in this moment.
Harry ignores that for the present; he turns to locate his bag, begins hastily stuffing his belongings into it. Draco seems to sense the end of today's lesson is fast approaching and affects a firmer tone.
Harry looks at his friend; he looks at his watery, red-rimmed eyes, at his chewed up lips and realises he had no clue. He had no idea how deeply Ron's terror ran, how much of this went far beyond simply Draco Malfoy.
Harry grins, all teeth. He's genuinely enjoying the conversation. "Bossy. You like telling people what to do. Can't do that if you're on your own all the time."
"So maybe that's why it stopped being Malfoy." Harry continues, looking up from his battered trainers to meet Draco's eyes. "Maybe it's because you're just like me and I'm finally starting to see that."
"Thank you, Harry." Hermione smiles in satisfaction. "I think a lot of prejudices against muggles can be addressed directly if we made Muggle Studies a compulsory lesson. Why should flying be mandatory when we're co-existing with muggles our entire lives? I think it would be highly beneficial if students were given the opportunity to learn more about living without magic and seeing things in a new perspective."
"I just thought that by now you'd have learnt how to take proper notes. I think this is a lesson long overdue for you, Ronald."
Harry's smile diminishes slightly. He falls back onto his elbows, tilting his head to regard Draco sat straight backed and haughty at the other end of the bed.
"Okay." Ron says - and that's it. Harry's word is enough for him. "Now who wants some hot chocolate?"
deserve it, Draco. My godfather once told me that the world isn't split up into good people and Death Eaters. It took me a while before I realised that that was true. You're more than what you've done, there's more to you than those acts. You're a person who makes mistakes, just like me. I don't blame you for following Voldemort's orders."
Harry and Draco drop into the seats she gestures to; Draco perches on the very edge, as if prepared to flee at the drop of a hat. From somewhere within the depths of the many cabinets, soft chimes are drifting out into the circular room, the gentle sounds instantly setting Harry at ease.
Seven years ago, Harry had rebuffed the very same hand held out for his friendship. It had been done without a second thought or regret, Harry had taken Draco at face value that day and turned away from him ever since. Until sixth year. Until the battle. Until now.
"The effects of the Killing Curse seem to be finally taking hold of you, Potter. There's no way she would agree to that."
Draco is sat at the end of the Slytherin table, just far enough away to be outside the perimeter of awareness. The other students around him chatter on happily, leaving him to go unnoticed, a solitary phantom blowing at the steam in his mug, one book propped against the edge of his bowl.
Harry doesn't say a word for now; he watches Draco stare down towards the unseen ground, white faced, blonde hair so bright in the moonlight that it glows. He cuts a severe figure against the inky blue of the sky, tall and lithe and sharp around the edges, his thin lips parted as he whispers his way through the past.
Traces of menace seem to linger here, settling on him like fine, silken cobwebs. Setting off, he peers into the rooms Draco had neglected, unable to keep himself from wondering where Voldemort had walked. Had he paced this very corridor, black robes swirling like smoke, those unfeeling red eyes sweeping over the family whose home he had claimed as if they were nothing more than furniture?
Harry nods, looking out over the ravine from the bridge. The thing is, he'd have said the same about this situation some months ago, the improbability of sharing something threateningly close to pleasant with Draco. The bitter wind sharpens his mind somehow, it's easier to think out here than in the hazy warmth of their common room or amidst the din in the Great Hall. Here, his thoughts are clear.
He waits for the pounding of his heart against his chest to ease, pressing shaky fingers against the sweat-slicked small of his back before dropping heavily onto the mattress again. It had seemed so real. He can still smell the damp earth and moss, his eyes
"Not as well as it could," Draco confirms Harry's suspicions reluctantly, eyes lowering to the wand in the Gryffindor's hand. "Something seems off with it now."
"Umbrella Charm." she explains with a shy, pleased smile. "It held up quite well, I only felt a few drops."
Outside of the Muggle Studies classroom, Harry sees nothing untoward, testing the handle to find that Malfoy had the foresight to lock the door behind him. It's easy to sneak through with a whispered
Harry jolts upright, one hand blindly reaching in the darkness for the handle of his wand. It is only when the unnerving silence is punctuated by Ron's soft snores that Harry realises he is not in the Forbidden Forest but safe in his bed instead.
"What? No." Harry scoffs. "No, Ginny could kick my arse at Quidditch any day of the week. You, on the other hand..."
Harry shakes himself out of the daze and apologises to Professor Sprout, turning to Filch who is sat in a quiet nook of the room, the only other figure in the room. "Mr. Filch? Professor Slughorn needs you in the dungeons. There's been an accident - some potion spilt on the floor - he says to bring your mop."
Harry nods, grateful to her for that. A part of him nearly tells her how much he misses her; he misses her casual teasing, the snort in her goofy laugh, the competitive streak that arises during games of Quidditch or Exploding Snap or when someone questions her hexing abilities. Ginny is wired differently to Ron, their need to prove themselves manifesting in wholly opposite ways: where Ron pulls back deeper into himself, bridling and stewing until everything spews out of him at once, Ginny grabs at everything she does with both hands and stares it down until it moves out of her way. Harry
