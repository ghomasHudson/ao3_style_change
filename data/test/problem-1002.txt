I was just waiting for the right time to slip the ripped out page on the basilisk into one of the books Hermione was carrying around with her like armor. I just kept repeating the phrase over and over in an effort to give me the peace of mind that it would almost be over.
Mione is watching in affection while the others smile. I just open the next one and see that this its Remus's so I put it to the side. I get another one and its Ron's. I hand it to him and he seems to be vibrating with excitement and nerves as he takes it from my hold. He stares at each item in disbelief as he pulls them out. Dress shirts, ink black dress robes with gold detailing, a fur lined winter coat in a dark grey color, leather Oxford shoes and designer socks. Dress pants, casual trousers and to pull it all together designer dress down T-shirts. He looks at the last items and turns bright red letting me know he got the boxers and briefs as well. He doesn't pull them out but he hugs the clothes softly to his chest as if to make sure they aren't just a figment of his imagination and looks at me with such gratitude.
The mail came in and I remembered what Harry was supposed to be getting today. The broom! And as expected a package the size of a nimbus 2000 was set in front of Harry and everyone excitedly opened it together as I watched.
Through out the whole process I decided I needed to share some personal information with the person who I now see as my little sister.
Some people just don't care if you aren't who they think you are. It doesn't matter if you change. It doesn't matter if you are the complete opposite of what your parents or the families beliefs lean towards, I'll always be a Malfoy to them.
Not more than a few minutes later the door opens to reveal a certain red head. " hey errr is it alright if I sit here? It's full everywhere else." I nod my acceptance after Harry looks at me in silent question. Ron sits down, "thanks, I'm Ron Weasley by the way". Harry spoke up then, "I'm Harry Potter an-" "your Harry Potter?!"
It was about midday when I became a mess of tears and wild hair as Draco told me he wanted me to leave the castle. I tried protesting that we still had time but he didn't want to risk me getting hurt when he........
Self blame was never a good thing and it was bad enough that Draco had it from his old life, we didn't need anyone else to fall victim to it.
"Well it seems that my hormone levels are that of an eleven year old and not a young adult, is what I'm trying to say."
"Draco, you can rant to me all you want. Trust me I know exactly what it feels like. I know it's not about attention or seeking pity, sometimes you just need someone who knows, who understands. You're so alone for so so long and finally you have someone you connect to, and it's like you're desperate to feel that connection. And we both finally have each other as that connection, so it's okay. I understand you perfectly."
I place Harry down softly on the bed and pull the covers over him trying to keep my mind from going into over drive. This whole situation is so far gone I'm not sure I can handle it so soon after escaping. Azkaban really did a number on my psyche and I fear I may have just added onto all of my emotional baggage just by being involved with Harry.
She was paralyzed for a second but looked at me and nodded in determination, probably thinking to get help once out. She made her way to the door trusting me to keep her safe. So when the troll twitched to move towards her I sent a spell that Dobby showed me to move furniture. The troll flew into the wall hard making rubble fly as the trolls spiky club hit me. I hissed in pain as it had clipped my shoulder pretty bad but I just covered it with my robe and faced the troll again.
During classes after I was finished with helping I would scan the catalog and write items down until I had exactly one whole new wardrobe for Harry. I even picked out a few things for Neville, Ron and Mione. I was hoping they would all like the things I got them. Then I suddenly remembered Lupin!
"Don't worry this is actually mine, it was accidentally slipped into here by the giant idiot now fighting with your father." I give her a wink after she checks her books and leave as she blushes with a shy smile.
" I want to go back in time as myself with my memories intact, to fix my mistakes and save my mother. I'll accept any repercussions just let me fix everything and save her." Seconds later I feel myself start to sleep as I float off the ground completely serene and calm. Then darkness.
As soon as the last person leaves the professor says, "Mr Malfoy, you are extremely talented for someone your age, something of the likes I've never seen before and I'm afraid your level is too far advanced for your current classes. I would normally suggest you skip a couple grades, but I can tell from your facial expression you don't want that. So how about you become my assistant or a student intern for me? You'll basically do what you did today, helping the students struggling and maybe grading some papers if I'm too busy. It will look very good on your record, imagine a student intern at eleven years old! So what do you say?"
After a while I regained most of my emotions from the outburst and was only left with a few hiccups and sniffling. I reluctantly looked up at them and they we're all crying too but not from sadness, it was from happiness. They came at me all at once and it was one big group hug of five elves, and I laughed as I gave it my all. After we all settled down I shuffled a bit and said, "um guys I have a favor to ask of you if you don't mind." They all nodded their agreement and Dobby said, "we will always help master Draco". I looked at each one of them and addressed them by name, "Ib, Mimzy, Lila, Ike , and Dobby, please just call me Draco no master or anything just Draco please." They nodded with misty eyes. "And I was wondering if you could teach me how to cook? I know it's a little strange but I... I made a friend and he doesn't get to eat very much so I want to send him food. Can you help me?" They all clapped and cheered, agreeing to help me.
All I got back was that Draco wasn't in any state to reply to any messages, and would reassure me that he would be better soon, through his wailing.
As I enter the dark shop filled to the brim with book shelves and other nicknacks related to reading and writing I make my way to the magical artifact section. After a while of looking I pick out a book that caught my eye, it's about the most powerful artifacts known and ones that are myth with detailed information on each one. So I flip through it and in the myth section I find the double pendulum. Yup I'm getting this. I look for a while longer and grab one on famous inventors of known artifacts. I leave that section and browse through ancient texts for something interesting when I come across a book in a foreign language. It has a lock and snakes decorate the cover, I try an unlocking spell but when I do it hisses and I realize it's parseltongue. I'm not sure whether I should get it but I decide to get it for Harry and give it to him later on. Now the last thing I need is to get a journal only I can open. I go to the journal section and ask which journal is the most secure. The seller motions to a row of leather bound journals with a flat smooth circle lock, it almost looks like a tiny mirror. He explains that to own the journal you need to cut your finger and let the blood soak the lock and press your finger to it so that its keyed to only you. Though you can also give permission for someone else to use it, all you'd need to do is add their blood and print to the lock as well right after the owner does it.
I thank her with a hug. From there Blaise and I help Daisy make French toast and before we leave I package the eclairs and cookies. Blaise and I eat a few before leaving, agreeing with me about the salt , making me wink at him before he burst out laughing. Blaise took two eclairs and cookies with him and I took the rest for the gryffindors.
I always made sure to sit next to him when I could, and give him food when he forgot in his haste of reading and note taking. It was in those moments I would see his tired eyes shift warmly as an affectionate smile bloomed on his lips. It made my heart skip a beat every time it happened which brought on those rare moments of calm where Draco's shoulders would droop slightly and he relaxed for a few moments.
I cast a shield only for it not to appear and I quickly forgo trying to cast it again. Resulting in me running to him and tackling his body to the ground right as the claw was going to strike him. Unfortunately because I wasted time in my failed shield I was hit by the claw instead and it wasn't on my arm like last time but my face.
Out of all the reactions I could have gotten from the small dragon I certainly didn't expect for it to shrink and hide under one of it's wings looking up at me almost bashfully. It made me smile happily at being able to calm them down but I jumped at Pansy's laughter echoing from behind the dragon. She saunters in which is odd since she is a candelabra, and then I get a sinking feeling in my gut as she continues to giggle while the dragon shrinks even more if that's possible.
I decided to take any negativity that could come from this choice because I was the one who accepted the proposal. I didn't just do this blindly.
I rush to the pet store to find Harry and Hagrid buying hedwig, the snowy white owl. I head over next to Harry and he brightens up as we all go outside. "Look Draco! Hagrid got her for me I named her hedwig!" "She's beautiful Harry and I like the name too. I have something for you as well, happy birthday Harry". He looks at me with wide eyes and says, "but Draco, you didn't have to." I pat him on the shoulder, "I know but I wanted to, come on open it." He nods and unwraps the present. He gasps.In his hand is what looks like a gold pirate medallion with a small emerald shaped like a diamond in the middle, connected to a very long black gold chain. "It's charmed so that whenever you feel lonely or overwhelmed you just hold onto it and rub the emerald three times, when you do that it connects to this one." I take out the one in my pocket, it's the same but in silver with a small opal on a black gold chain. "When one of us does that then the other person can feel what your feeling and can send out their own feelings to comfort the other."
He was the second most sought after due to being the best hunter for the kingdom and he would not give up his chase no matter how many girls he bedded or how many times I refused. It worried the knights a bit but they always made sure to regularly comment about how they would beat him up if he dared try anything against my will. It made me smile knowing that despite them not understanding my desire to not bed people when I easily could, they still respected my wishes and would even seek justice on my behalf.
"Okay um well I wanted to give you something and I didn't really want to have an audience...... err anyways here."
When the chicken was done I looked for the connecting picnic baskets. It made me a little queazy thinking about the similarity between the picnic baskets and the vanishing cabinet, but I pushed the thought away and focused on putting the food in glass containers. I get silverware, napkins, a glass cup and a fancy glass bottle of pumpkin juice, with sticking notes telling him what everything was. I then added treacle tart that the guys made earlier at the last second. I showed them and when they gave the agreeing nod I released a breath and smiled. I thanked them and promised to come in after dinner to help them with anything they need. As well as to come see me if they got injured or were punished, they agreed hesitantly but still accepted my help. Before I could leave though Mimzy called my name and I gave her a proud beaming smile making her blush as she handed me two books. They read , 'cooking the muggle way from beginner to expert levels', and 'cooking the wizarding way from beginner to expert levels'. I thanked her and gave her a hug as I left with the picnic basket in hand. I shrunk it and charmed it to resize itself when it arrived to its destination, knowing that Harry wouldn't know how to do magic yet.
It's finally the day I leave for hogwarts and I tell the snake today is the day, and that I'll have to hide him and his home for the move. He complies and I place all of my last minute things in my packed trunk with his things. He slithers into my leather satchel and I carry it on my shoulder. I take a look in the mirror to see myself.
"How about you have a go at them in the morning and I'll work my magic during breakfast? Don't worry I'll bring you breakfast so you won't be hungry."
They asked how my meeting was and I told them it went great and that he would be stocking me with potions, as I opened up the messenger bag and showed them where the compartment was in case they needed to know. As well as him trying to see if I could be with him over the summer instead of with my parents. They all looked extremely relieved and I think  I just got a group of Gryffindors to like Severus Snape! Hahahaha this is great. Soon though we all parted for bed and settled down in our dorms. I made sure to put up silencing charms on my curtains this time and the world faded to black.
Once the words leave my mouth a golden glow surrounds our palms and I get a feeling of fullness. I search for the feeling and I can feel a small warm ball of what can only be Draco inside of my chest. I imagine my magic surrounding it and it's like a wave of knowing rushes through me. I can feel him, his happiness and his nerves echoing quietly and I'm in awe of the sensation of the bond.
I smile as he begins to pace around and I go in front of him and pull him into a hug myself. Whispering,
It had been a horrible idea that we would split into groups in search for whatever killed a unicorn, but it happened. So Ron and I faced the Forrest at a slow pace when we saw something disturbing. A figure hunched over a dead unicorn as if it was eating. I thought I was going to hurl the dinner I had just eaten in the next minute, when the figure looked at us. Ron screamed and in any other situation I would have laughed at how girly it sounded, but all I could think of was of the pain in my scar and the thought of,
I nod and he gives me another pain potion for this before sanitizing and stitching me up. It isn't as bad thanks to the potion and I softly thank Sev again before slipping into a soft sleep.
Harry said, and I nodded knowing exactly how I wanted to start this. Everyone nods along and once they all look to me imploringly I start to say,
"We are going to get Dobby to Apparate us to the ministry after the feast. Then were going to ask for Draco's cousin ,Tonk's, an Auror. From there Peter will be in ministry custody and questioned under veritaserum! It was all his plan. Also the cage is one Draco made that is probably inescapable."
And that's how I find myself and Draco going out to eat dinner together at a small hidden diner eating pasta.  As we eat he explains how the potion is supposed to work and how he can't wait for the results on the testing to come back to him. I happily sat through the complicated procedure and listened to him rave on about his research.
The Malfoy boy has been with Harry from the start, from what I remember hearing Harry say. He gives him food during the summer because of those horrible muggles, he helps him through any obstacles of the dark lord trying to resurrect himself, and deliberately puts himself in the cross fire for the sake of those he cares about.
Out of the first three the third looked the best in matters of success with the least amount of moral misconduct. In other words it was the only one where I didn't need to kill someone or something, only needing to get my hands on some wizard’s/witch’s pureblood, but I couldn't get ahead of myself just yet. Because even if I hated to admit it blood always made it more powerful and gave me a higher level of success. So I began to decode the last ritual until I heard soft footsteps come down the stairs, which made me look up.
my nerves are a bit high as I wonder what I'll be facing. I shake away the dark thoughts echoing in my head and instead focus on Daisy who just apparated into the kitchen.
"It's something taught to every pure blood when little. It's good to be able to get in others good graces in important conventions or dances. Doesn't mean It's never going to stop being embarrassing afterwards."
I'm glad I had used a cleaning charm on myself before trying to sleep. I wouldn't want to do anything to make the cute owl avoid physical touch. He sits happily on my shoulder huddled in the juncture of my shoulder and jaw.
"So your my cousin huh? Mum always said you were but I didn't ever expect you to want to meet me. From what Mum says our beliefs clash, though I wonder about that now. So what do you need squirt?"
Once I'm finally able to get him out of his paralyzing nightmare he gasps trying to breath through his tears and sobbing, his jumbled up words of "I'm sorry" and "Please stop" are the only sounds in the room. I just hug him close and he practically grips my sleep clothes as if I'm his lifeline. And in a way I might be. I ignore the huge blast that went off in the distance much to the incredulous stare of Ron.
"It's sad I know. He was a child making decisions that were desperate and in the end he became something other than the human he was. Though I wish it was different, it isn't and so now we have to stop Voldemort from taking over."
Then as I flew to him and we both landed not even a minute later McGonagall came storming on the pitch.
As we were waiting for them to bake there were pops and I could hear Daisy running towards me. She threw her arms around me yelling.
"I went through all of that and I still couldn't save the one person I did everything for. I failed at everything. Keeping her alive, being a Malfoy, resisting orders, being who I should have been, being who I wanted to be."
"Well then I'll leave you to get a little more comfortable. I'll be in the tea room. I hope to see you again Mr. Malfoy."
He wipes my face softly and kisses my forehead making me feel parental love for the first time in the longest while. He smiles a fragile thing that looks as though it could shatter at any moment if I'm not careful, and I return it. And though I would have loved to keep bonding with him the leaking gashes on my thighs were still a pressing matter. So he knitted the skin there as well for three of them and sadly having to cauterize the other five. Only extremely thin slightly curved or jagged scars of light pink were left behind, the skin still smooth. Once that was done and the smaller simple cuts were healed with the wave of a wand I grinned. He smiled as well before asking if there were any more.
"I know that there is something going on here at Hogwarts and I think this whole thing with the stolen object and Dumbledoor protecting it has to do with Voldemort. Everyone says he's gone but the way they say it is almost like they just want to believe he's gone."
"Okay, if you promise me that you won't ask about what's going on then it's okay. God, I miss you guys. I don't feel like myself at all without them or you either."
I knew that a great deal of why she was helping me came down to the fact that, it was Harry Potter who stood next to me expecting her services. He was the one to get her. If I were to come alone she would dismiss me with a half assed diagnostic spell and I'd have to go to the headmaster, or write a letter to my parents to get medical help.
"I had no idea house elves existed until this morning! Wow magic is awesome. There are so many things to learn, I love it!"
He trusted me and I was relieved at having someone who just wanted to talk about normal everyday things, and the once in a while basking in the others comfort when we remember our home life. He was there for me when Sev took out the stitches in my back, and he was the one to help me put salves on it to this day. He made sure I got some mother henning from him as well as teasing.
I just forget about the jumper and quickly get a hold of him before he can taste the creaking wood floor. He seems weak and over exerted at the moment so I practically drag him to the bed and rest him there while taking in his state.
I was left somewhat speechless that he would figure it out so quickly but I knew he was a fast learner. The others were watching the scene unfold with shocked eyes.
"I see. Well I'm grateful for your will to still communicate with me while knowing about the blood on my hands. I guess I should explain a few things."
"But as I was saying before, because Sirius was framed he was locked up in Azkaban, which is Wizarding prison. They say he killed 12 people and Peter on the same night he gave up your parents location.”
They are both settling in and turn to look me over quickly before cheerfully greeting me. Ron decides to go out and search for Mione and Neville but I honestly think he was a bit afraid of the snake judging by how he wouldn't stop staring at him. I chuckle as he leaves and I turn to Harry grinning.
A hex is the only thing powerful enough to interfere with something as magically strong as a broom! Yes! And who wants to practically bring havoc to everyone in the wizarding world by brining Voldemort back this year? Hmmmmmmm QUIRRELL, that's who. So with that solved I'm practically bouncing to the gryffindor common room. As usual I pass out the individual scones and get busy with doing Miones hair.
By the end of it I'm crying about how useless I am at not being able to help him, all while wrapped in a warm embrace. I just let everything out and was soothed by his affectionate actions. The lull of encouraging words was all I heard, all I felt, as I drifted to sleep. All the while something horrible was happening to the person I held dear to my heart.
I never really understood how his magic could feel like that even when Ron tried to explain it. Though it was probably due to the fact that Ron was all over the place in explaining and jumping from one thought to another in between looks of awe in Draco's direction.
I smirk at them saying, "good day ladies and try not to belittle my friends because there will be devastating consequences next time."
Ever since I decided to follow my biological fathers footsteps in being a knight I was seen as something greater and heroic. There weren't many knights in the kingdom and that included myself, Ron, Blaise, Theo, Anthony, Neville, and Sirius. We all had our fair share of unwanted advances, but since Ron had Hermione as a fiancé and Neville had Hanna the rest of us received the most. The other knights didn't mind that much, especially Sirius, from how they  boasted about it sometimes, but I couldn't muster anything other than anger when I had anyone advance towards me.  Ron and Hermione were both sympathetic but I just tried to drown out all the leering stares by shoving my nose in books or training. There was really nothing else I could do but ignore it and run away. The only thing was that there was a certain person who was very persistent in their quest to attain me.
As if he had been with me through the battle of Hogwarts himself and he couldn't bare the thought of me being injured after rescuing me from a mountain of blown up stone that was once a tower instead of Blaise.
I take a moment to process what Harry told me and I chuckled in my head thinking this is a classic case of jealousy. He was jealous Blaise was with me instead of him, and that I was comforted with someone that wasn't him.
She laughed as I made dramatic jesters of exhaustion. Neville and Ron looked amused and happy that we weren't holding grudges against one another, while Harry just looked annoyed. I just smiled faintly and clenched one hand in a fist to remind myself that I'm here to help these guys not let my feelings get in the way. During the meal I try to distract myself from the loudness in the great hall and pause every time my hand creeps into my other sleeve.
" Alright, well Harry there is a such thing as magic being able to do everyday tasks but not many can do it. It's normally only those who were born knowing they had magic and have been taught how to control their magic with their will. The Host is actually my best friend and he.... well, lets just say he had a powerful curse put on him and everyone who was here in the castle. His name is Draco in case you wanted to know, and he...... he is very self conscious of how he looks. He thinks that because he was turned into a monster he is one........ I'm positive the voice you heard was his. You see we were all humans once but when the curse was cast everyone who worked here was turned into objects like yours truly. It's been a nightmare for me, can you believe I used to be a fashion model and now I can't wear anything I used to! It was agony the first year!"
So with those thoughts in mind I sighed and let myself forget about the future and just take in the scent of my shampoo circling around me before getting out and spelling myself dry. I summon my pajamas and change as I charm my mouth clean. I'm so tired I trudge through the room and fall asleep the second my head hits the pillow. It would only be a few hours later before I'd realize my mistake.
Blaise's shoulders seem to fall and he first takes out the dessert from the oven before sitting across from me delicately poised as we always are. But seeing how I seem to be in a melted puddle of distress gets up and sits next to me so that in seconds I'm in his arms. I dig my face into his robes in search of peace for a few minutes, grateful for the calming silence Blaise is giving me.
"Oh Draco?! I was about to go down, I thought boys couldn't come into the girls side?" I just smile slightly and move into the room as she opens the door more for me.
"I understand the feeling Tom. There are many things I've both seen and done that I know I could never tell those around me for fear of how they would see me."
He gives me a watery smile and I pull on my shirt and tie again as I lead the way to the oven. Once I'm fully buttoned and done up I open the oven and see that they are done. So I take them out and place a slight cooling charm on two of them so that we can indulge early. He takes it almost reverently and we both sit down next to each other at the table. Our sides pressed together, enjoying the sweet pastry with coconut milk as we talked about what we've been up to. Harry told me all about quidditch and the gryffindors, and I talked about the projects I was doing.
As we waited for the last batch of toast to finish I thought about the quidditch game that was going to happen today. I know something happens before Harry catches the snitch with his mouth, but I don't know what made his broom act up. I kept thinking and it wasn't until I had been making my way through the hallways to the common room that it dawned on me. A hex!
before I meet Harry halfway across the chamber in a running embrace. I run my hands over him, his back, chest, and face while he chuckled.
He looks as though he can't breath and I'm about to ask if somethings wrong when he quickly hugs me saying thank you. I flinch involuntarily but I return the hug a second later so that he doesn't think it's unwelcomed. I ruffle his hair as he steps back and we both put on our necklaces. It isn't until then we remember Hagrid is still there so when we turn to look at him he looks as though he's about to cry and it makes me laugh inside. I just pat his arm and he looks as though he's trying harder to keep them in so I just bring my hand up to my mouth and cover up my smile. Harry looks at me with a little sadness and it makes me concerned but he just smiles warmly at me and shakes his head. But we all knew that it was time for Harry to leave so we said our goodbyes after I made sure Harry knew how to get onto the platform, and with the promise that I will look for him to sit together. I watched them leave and I headed to knock turn alley to go into the bookstore there.
"Draco are you insane?! Why? Your father is furious, it was Pansy who wrote to her father about your sorting which got back to your father."
I nod and grit my teeth as the burning sensation that comes with the spell sears into my tender raw skin, and I grunt in pain. I breath rapidly after its finished as I try to withstand the feeling of my skin being cauterized. I grunt out a thanks to Sev and he looks at me with pain in his eyes.
"Where have you been hiding Harry? I've been looking for you for a long time! The whole town in fact has been in a frenzy ever since you up and left. Trying to play a game with me where you? Well I found you and now I'll be taking my prize."
I turn away once they start kissing knowing that by now she will be distracted enough to forget what happened. I smirk and carefully check every abandoned room and abandoned closet looking for something, anything, that might connect to this whole hidden artifact thing. I grit my teeth at the pain in my lower back and the burning of my thighs from the strain of trying to keep my knees bent, in case I need to act quickly. I wipe the sweat on my brow with my wand hand as I turn the next door knob, only for it to stop turning. Locked. I smile and in my eagerness I quickly unlock the door and step in before looking, softly closing the door as I look out in the corridor, making sure the other portraits didn't see. After seeing it all clear I close the door slowly and turn around only to come face to face with a sleeping three headed dog.
I raise my sleeve to show the giant male hand print around my wrist. Blaise lets out a tear and raises his own sleeve to show a smaller hand print the size of an adult female, his mother. I brush away his tear and give him a real smile.
"This time it seems as though you've got six new lacerations two on you torso, two on your right hip and two on your left thigh. A few burns on your arms four to be exact, as well as a broken rib. The cuts are from a cursed object, the rib from blunt force. You have been under the cruciatus curse for far too long I need to give you the potions Immediately."
Draco leads me to the library and we pick out a few books on curses he has there before making our way to a couch perched on a giant throw rug in front of the fire place. He easily breaths fire to a few logs placed inside the hearth and in a few seconds there's a roaring fire to help keep us warm. I'm about to sit on the couch when I see Draco lay down on the rug making me follow. I sit criss cross with a small stack of books to my right and Draco to my left. He looks at me in surprise but gives that small quirk of his lips confirming it was a smile. I return the sentiment before propping open one of the books and laying down on my stomach to start my research, content with having his silent company.
"That's not entirely correct Draco, yes, you won’t let others get hurt but you let yourself get hurt instead."
He says, and everyone is on him in a minute. The giant group hugs are definitely one of my favorite things in our friend group if I was being honest. He was laughing for a little bit before giving a small cough which reminded us he was still healing and to not get ahead of ourselves. We all let go and Mione took it upon herself to start lecturing him about being impulsive in situations where there was going to be injuries.
Well, I certainly didn't expect to blow her up like a balloon, is what I think as I watch her float away.
He claps his hands with a grin "so you know about the potions I was working on to help werewolves and vampires?"
Before I even open my mouth to try and give some excuse for what he saw he just gives out a puff of air and speaks.
The next thing I know I'm being blinded by sunlight. The feeling of silk sheets brushing across my warm skin as I swing my legs over the side of..... the bed? That's when I notice how much smaller my body is, my hands incredibly soft no longer calloused from riding my broomstick so much. I start to grin, something I haven't done in years outside of private rooms with my mother. I did it, I did it! I rush to the bathroom mirror and come face to face with my 11 year old self. My blonde hair messy from sleep, my face small and youthful though a little pointy, then I get to my eyes. They are wide and silver but they don't look like a child's eyes full of wonder, they look like the eyes of someone who's seen too much too fast, they're my older self's eyes. It's a sobering thought that has me running a hand through my hair to tame it, and rummaging through my clothes to go downstairs. I pull on a white dress shirt, some black slacks, and plain black shoes. I turn to my bed side table for my wand only to come across a paper the size of a postcard.
Fingers curl into his hair and he spares a moment to wonder if it's sweat or blood that's smearing around up there by his temple. It’s simply vile. Or hot. Definitely hot, in one way or another. Draco pulls back with a grunt and attacks that jaw, kissing and licking and tasting the hard line all the way back. He finds an innocent bit of skin just behind his ear that feels forbidden. Impossibly intimate. Potter gasps, the sound is raspy and unrefined; Draco pushes his nose deeper into the dark hair and sucks harder on the sweet, soft skin.
Ah. Draco adjusts himself. Harry asks if this is okay and Draco gives him his very best sneer. When he's cooled off, he pulls Harry back in. They touch. All those places that aren't sexual but still somehow forbidden without trust. Harry craves his touch and Draco delights in teaching him a thing or two about a proper weave of limbs. It gets a bit ridiculous – he's not sure where his left leg is or how Harry's arm is simultaneously behind and in front of him – and they tease and banter just the same. Harry's skin is still the same, still scruffy on the jaw and calloused on the hands. He can still hear Harry's heart beating against his firm chest, but it's not pounding in anticipation of...something. He can still meet those fiery green eyes, though there's something more in his gaze now. Something excited, and that makes Draco feel excited – not in his pants, Merlin forbid, but in his own eyes.
James was constantly referencing people and places that left Monty in the dark. He didn't know who Dudley was, or Seamus, or Neville, but any random customer would send James off on one story or another. What he forgot now was that Monty had never known these mysterious names. It was off-putting, Monty thought, to be so far separated from something in James's life. He had envisioned discovering this world together, meeting old friends together, but James was remembering things left and right, leaving Monty behind. Off-putting indeed.
his mind supplied bitterly. James didn't answer, only smiled at him in a vague way that looked more like a grimace before throwing the letter back on the table.
, he promised it. “Rolanda and Pomona are taking a year or two off for their little one. Neville Longbottom is coming in to replace Pomona, but Rolanda is still looking for a replacement. Are you interested?”
Normally he would have argued, he would have said he was fine and he didn't need his help, and fuck off for offering. But today he relented with a sigh and a stiff nod.
And then there was George. He was seated next to the twins, who were crammed together onto the end where Helen used to stand. George Weasley seemed as delighted by Arthur and Alexander as the younger boys were by him; he was already deep in conversation about magical pranks and sweets. James could almost hear the sizzling power of mischief among them. The inevitable disaster tonight would involve that end of the table, he was certain.
Fin is going to Azkaban, or wherever it is that squibs go after they steal wizard boy heroes. Harry wonders if, under the care of dementors, Fin might deal with his grief and admit that his actual son is long dead and never coming back. Or, is he already too far gone into madness for it to matter?
, Mother - I serve him our finest tea - your tea, yes, thank you, Mum - and this is how he repays me! With trauma! Blood on my floor and all this new trauma and - and - and
"Bundle up out there, you two!" Pansy called cheerily after them as they stepped out into the brisk October air. Harry wondered what nonsense Terry had told her before leaving for their new job at Hogwarts; Pansy looked like she'd been shopping at the same shop as the former receptionist - a shop that only sold the smuggest of looks. Draco shot her a rude gesture just as the door closed.
He had Astoria to thank for this lecture. That bitch lost the battle Wednesday and went tattling to his mummy.
“Mm.” He’s in pain. That’s a pained sound, Draco’s sure of it. Of course he’s in pain, he’s been half-broiled on a giant shitting oven-rack!
"Well..." she started, taking great care in placing the mug to her side and nudging it here and there. "To be honest, no, it never occurred to me until..."
"Oh not like that! Calm your tittering heart, princess! Lest you...titter yourself to death!" Blaise looked quite pleased with that one and Draco wanted to hurl the pitcher at his ineloquent mug. "Is the rumor true," Blaise started again, very slowly, as if he were an imbecile, "that Potter is the upstanding citizen behind Charming Chocolates?"
Magic also explained his dreams, his nonsensical but vivid memories, and all of those weird things that seemed to happen around the Charming men. James’s mobile phones shorting out the moment he felt any strong emotion at all; Alec somehow managing to get that bloody robot working after a year of troubleshooting had driven him to the edge (even now they had no idea how it worked, beeping and booping away without any actual power source); Arthur mouthing off to the wrong bunch of lads and somehow ending up on top of the brawl, unscathed.
He pulls away if Draco goes any further. Their perfect fit is left empty and cold as Harry oh so casually shifts to the other end of the sofa, kicking his feet up into Draco's lap and holding
He missed his catch and fell back too far, landing on his bum in the grass before he could get his uncooperative legs under him. Kim joined him, sitting with her back against the ladder and blocking him from his play.
"The report claims that your son recognized you were experiencing a flashback, which provoked you to attack an Auror." Charming nodded again, glaring at the file.
"He asked me along," Draco shrugged, running a finger along the edge of the crystal water pitcher. "I can't deny Scorpius box seats for the sake of avoiding a cripple."
His Mind Healer had told him that another person's disapproval was not his responsibility. There was nothing for him to fix here, nothing he could do to fix it unless he backed down to make Remus happy.
James blinked. Of course he was. If he hadn't been sure before, Arty's bug-eyed expression was proof enough.
as Arty had said earlier. Monty looked expectantly at Alec. All four of them were plenty good at non-verbal communication. He'd leave it up to the lad to decide if the rest of the table would be privy to their conversation.
“Hmm…” he responded, turning his head slightly in the direction of the raspy voice but not taking his eyes off that window. Everything was blurry without his glasses.
“I think—” Potter hesitates, then releases his hold on Draco. He leans back slightly, unsticking his chest from the back of Draco’s shirt. His hands hover anxiously to either side of Draco. “I think it gets hotter each time we touch.”
know...that he was just trying to wrap up this process as quickly as possible to get Harry Potter out of his hair.
"They call for backup an' then storm the back room all at once. Da's back there, jam-blood on his sleeves an' lookin' like a deer in headlights, guilty as ye please, so they
it was one of those moments when he was remembering something. Which was fascinating, of course, but he wished he would hurry it up so they could get to the good part.
An hour later, after a bath and a dose, James emerged from the loo just in time to hear Monty start up the stairs. He hurried into the bedroom, feeling achy and tired down to his core, wanting none of what Monty had to say. He eased the door shut and retrieved his wand just in time.
James gravitated at once to the antique settee across from the fire and Draco almost sat beside him by habit, until the boys crammed themselves there instead. He chose the loveseat, perpendicular to the settee, with his mother. His unblinking father sank into the wingback armchair, his perfectly straight back to the fire.
James tore off the itchy knit cap, shoving it into his jacket pocket. He missed his old hat and wondered who had it now. Whoever snatched it off his head was a right cunt.
Ron snorted and shared a knowing look with Hermione. So maybe Harry had been just as clueless in his day... It was oddly comforting that James Charming's personality before July 1998 was not as mysterious as he thought it was.
"It's him, Minerva," he insisted for what felt like the hundredth time in an hour. "You'll see!" He hadn't lost that manic feeling since he saw the photo on the wall. He could hardly feel his feet as they carried him closer to the shop. To Harry.
He retched, and retched, then retched some more. Someone rubbed his back. Low voices conferred, but Draco wasn't among them. He let a few more tears slip out, not feeling nearly as far away from the bunker as he once did, and that was the end of it.
He cleared his throat, feeling a bit stupid all of the sudden. "Hogwarts is a difficult transition for any parent, I assure you. I'm a parent myself, you know."
"Just, how many?" he repeated, turning pleading, friendly eyes on the counterfeit who obviously didn't hate him. It was a rare breed that didn't have something against Draco Malfoy. A mostly Slytherin breed.
weren't cobbing Harry, that was. Draco furrowed his brow, but he didn't look too upset with him for trying to poach his receptionist. Terry pursed their lips and nodded slowly. Harry was awarded with a wide grin from Terry and a mock scowl from Draco.
Eyeing a nearby ivory chair with frank suspicion, Potter throws himself on his knees next to the armchair and Draco suddenly wonders if he can coerce him to get on his knees in
James tried to push him back out of sight but Tony stalked over and snatched Arthur's collar, dragging him forward. James latched onto his oldest boy, using his other hand to push away the traitor, but Tony suddenly drove him back against his bad hip and sent him sprawling to the floor, wheezing in pain, with Alec beneath him.
"The witch who runs the post office in Hogsmeade caught me on my walk," Remus elaborated as he waved a sealed piece of parchment. "Haz Blue? The Blue threw her off, but Sirius has called you Haz around the village enough that she figured it was yours." Harry crouched and reached his hand down through the rungs of the bannister, and Remus stood tall on his tip-toes to hand it off.
“What are some ways we can foster a diverse environment here at Voldecorp?” Arthur asks. Someone flicks the lights back on and the room at large seems to wake. Eyes blink blearily at each other as everyone straightens up, stifling yawns.
“Isn’t that what got him jumped in the first place?” he said scathingly. “Aurors leaving their post, with their romantic ideas about privacy - ”
James assumed it was okay to pry now, since Malfoy seemed hurt that he had never asked before. Despite all the signs! Bloody hell. Of course he was sick. He was pale and peaky, there were circles under his eyes for weeks after that Quidditch match because he was obviously losing sleep over worry and fear and -
The Gryffindor in him reared its ugly head, screaming at him to get Draco, Narcissa, and the boys out of here alive by any means necessary. This wasn't their problem, it was his and his alone. He chose to send his guard away all those years ago - and today as well. He chose to sneak into Potter Cottage to investigate a mysterious noise. He chose to stop when he found Dung pilfering his childhood nursery, to scream at him, to give away his location, to earn himself a busted hip and a shattered mind.
, Monty asserted, feeling slightly sick at the insinuation that he had pressured a starving man into a relationship. But that wasn't how it happened and they both knew it. He got James better first, that was always the priority. Those comments and flirtations weren't serious. That was just Monty being Monty. His main concern was to help James, and when James was better, he came to his senses and saw what Monty had to offer beyond food and groceries.
"Well, I don't think we can leave it like this," she said finally. James shook his head but didn't lift his face. "The boys deserve better. We've got to get you on speaking terms." James jerked out of her grasp, staring at her dubiously.
"Just answer some questions and I'll get out of your hair," he said, swiping the cheap Muggle stationary through Draco's carefully coiffed locks. "True or false - " The imperious way it was said, Draco was suddenly thrown back to playing Truth or Dare in the Slytherin dorms. " - James Charming, of Charming Chocolates, is actually Harry Potter in disguise?"
"Food!" Molly W. cries. Everyone jumps. "I'd like to introduce - oh, er...ethnic cuisine - to the menu!"
Harry hesitated again, shoving his hand forward as if he were reaching into an invisible man's pocket. His fingers curled around an imaginary wand before pulling back to sign:
He made an indignant, cawing sound. "You're the rudest! Here I am, I'm...pouring my shriveled Slytherin heart out to you, and you - you soppy little
They were outside again, but it wasn't nearly as cold as it was before, which was weird considering the sun had long since set.
"He never seemed terribly interested in self-preservation. My mother saw him die, apparently. Did your friends tell you…?" He nodded stiffly. "Accepting those memories back won't change who you are now and they won't solve everything for you. It may help with your frustration, it may make your depression worse for a time. But Harry Potter..."
By the end of Robards's questioning, when the Aurors thought they had sufficiently tortured an already tortured civilian, Draco was released. To walk through the Atrium, to escort his own bald head to the Apparation wing, where he could finally return home. He wasn't sure whether or not to be grateful that no one seemed to even recognize him.
And so he found himself, with his own just-barely-post-pubescent facial hair valiantly trying to fill in those patches, sitting cross-legged on a cushion while Draco's partner in real estate led him through a
"Yes - er, what? I mean, I'm - I'm looking for a house," Harry stammered out without even knowing it was true until he said it.
Arthur shut the door behind him and flopped down on his unmade bed, which creaked loudly. Arty patted it absentmindedly, like he always did after some annoying piece of second-hand furniture "greeted" him.
“Quill acquaintance,” Remus translated automatically. Harry blinked. He would be sticking with penpals, if he ever went about forging that ridiculous plan. Hedwig was one old friend he hadn't been reunited with, having disappeared shortly after he did...he wondered what had happened to her.
. Who told him that? Who could look at this man, this fiery, courageous, affectionate, gentle-hearted man and see something broken?
"And what do you do, Mr. Blue?" Terry asked, leaning forward over the receptionist counter, arms crossed.
because he'd given him his memories back along with a few coping mechanisms after six weeks of therapy. That mattered, but the magnetism was there outside of it all. Despite it all.
No matter. Harry will get out. There's only two locked doors and a steep set of stairs between him and freedom, after all. He'll learn this new game and play by the rules when he absolutely must, just long enough to find his way to the surface again.
There. Maybe Arthur's fear of felines would be the next topic of discussion and humiliation. He could tell stories too!
us." The idea is preposterous, he can't believe he's even considering it, but…there are stories warning children against cooking in cauldrons. Nothing good comes from consuming magic. It isn't a spice, it's not meant to be consumed. Even dark wizards don't dare to eat their magic, the practice is…evil.
So.  That's that.  Now we can move forward with memories and Drarry.  And plot, of course.  Always need a dash of plot!
“Still got it!” Ron cried out happily as he brought his own broom over to hover between the brothers. Dad waved in acknowledgement but didn’t slow down on his mission to fly every possible route through the garden air as quickly as possible.
"Thought you'd like to know about Greg," his friend sighed. Draco spared him a glance before going back to his work.
"And we're acknowledging our thoughts but bidding them farewell for this moment," she answered, her monotone voice carrying a sharp edge of reprimand from her own cushion in the Muggle yoga parlor. Harry adjusted his position, trying to keep his back straight to help his chi flow or whatever. He couldn't help but think the cushions would be better suited as pillows and it'd be much easier to keep his posture if he were allowed to lie down -
The short, human-like figure seemed to be made of a hodgepodge of metal and plastic Muggle items. Exposed wires running the length of its "body" were neatly cinched together at regular intervals with plastic ties. Bright, colorful paint gave the illusion of an alien creature wearing modern Muggle fashion. Remus guessed that the artist may have meant for its creation to sport blue skin, red hair, and yellow overalls, but that was the extent of his coherent thoughts on the...thing.
Monty clapped a warm hand on James's shoulder but James didn't look up. George was screaming with laughter, Ron and Hermione were holding each other up through their tears, Teddy's hair was inexplicably white.
How many survived? Potter had a talent for beating the odds, but how many others got away that night?
It was a testament to Dumbledore's old drugged candy that Remus didn't fall to the floor in a dead faint at the sight before him. Harry Potter limped over to the other side of the table and began distributing plates, giving his guests a polite but vague smile. He was much older than when Remus had seen him last - obviously twelve years older, he was just about thirty now! His untamed hair was streaked with greys and his forehead creased into wrinkles as he took in their expressions. Harry shot a questioning look at Monty, who shrugged and made a quick, strange gesture with his hands in reply. Whatever it was, it must have made sense to Harry because he gave a careless shrug in reply and finished placing the plates.
"Viktor!" Draco's voice brightens and he breaks into a wide smile. Harry's expression turns dark as Viktor Krum winds his way through the clothing racks.
In the Days of Denny, Harry hasn't yet broken his cursing habit. Again and again, he has his mouth violently washed out with soap until he's gagging and crying. He takes to rinsing his hands without soap, as the smell of it is enough to put him off his food.
"So," Harry said, scurrying over and hopping to land with two feet when he came up even on Malfoy. "What's next, Malfoy?"
That morning marked their fifth session. The first two had brought up a daunting mess of childhood horrors to work through - Draco would never look at a cupboard the same way again - and the last two had been a hodgepodge of school hijinks. This latest one, against his better instincts and with Weasley and Goldstein standing by, Draco reluctantly asked James to meditate on his past experiences with pain and trauma.
Potter clamps his hot, meaty palm over Draco's mouth again and it takes all his willpower not to bite him. He shoves him off, scowling, but Potter's eyes have gone bright and he seems not to notice. He nods dumbly over Draco's shoulder, and Draco turns to look.
Monty smiled warmly and kissed James on the top of his mop of hair before passing over his own gift. It was a thin, flimsy rectangle, like a magazine. James carefully unwrapped the shiny purple paper to reveal a manilla folder. Flipping it open, he found dozens of drawings and blueprints, and - worst of all - a huge document entitled Charming Chocolates & Gibbs Goodies.
Monty had nodded at the time, like an idiot, thinking he would prove something to James. He would prove that Malfoy was up to no good, that James was flirting back, that Muggle music was better than the Wizarding Wireless rubbish that Ron kept carting in every week! He would prove to James that he knew a thing or two, even if magic wasn't his world. He would gain James's trust back, if he'd ever had it.
were not top form for Draco, not anymore. He'd been breaking out into longer sentences lately. His vocabulary wasn't anything to brag about, but James thought he'd grasped the grammar much faster than he himself had.
An hour later, Alec was getting the hang of this flying business. It all started with the position of his hands, the force of pushing and pulling the broom in different directions. He discovered he could gain speed considerably fast if he used his legs to help him straighten out flat on the broom handle (and Dad only just saved him from speeding right into a tree). Shifting his weight to one side or another while he leaned forward caused the broom to drift in a way that had Ginny babbling to him excitedly about Chasers and technique.
the liability of carrying a weapon that sparked and flared when he wasn't in his right mind. But lately the wand was never far from his hand.
"Oh! I know you!" Harry declared suddenly as the pieces clicked into place. Terry Higgs raised a brow and Harry went on, careful to keep his own identity foggy. "You were Seeker, right? The year before Draco took over?"
“Er….” he said intelligently, drawing it out for far too long. He hadn't prepared for a wheelchair. Did that change anything...? No, right? No, of course not, but now he'd forgotten what he was meant to -
his left hand against the handle instead and discovered that the broom responded much more smoothly this time. He turned in the air, then straightened out again.
"I see." Blaise ran his fingers across his lips in that way he had when he was in deep contemplation and forgot what he looked like.
With an awkward shuffling, they inch closer to the bed, dragging their island of clothes with them. Draco can feel the hot bricks through the fabric, through his socks. Carefully, ever so carefully, he leans over, blinking away the blackness that creeps into his vision, and reaches for his abandoned shoes. It’s a painstakingly slow process, but then his shoes are on again and there’s a nice thick buffer between his feet and the floor. Hunched over, Potter doesn’t even seem to notice his own singed feet—he’s too busy gutting the demon mattress, using his trousers as a protective glove—and Draco reaches out again to collect his shoes as well. A little voice in his head tells him he's quite the gentleman for it.
"But none work as well as yours," Tony interrupted. "Your method is patented. Who else knows how to do it?"
In which Harry takes the scenic route, discovers the meaning of thatch, and opens a door by closing one.
"Said he could be yer twin, he did," Monty told Harry in a low voice, nodding in Remus's direction. "Went all pale when 'e saw yer picture in the shop, like he'd seen a ghost."
"He will," Ron said. "We'll talk to him, mate, when you're ready. And we won't let him force his way back into your life."
"Did you always want to be an auror, Hermione?" he blurted out between bites of warm, buttery toast. Ron's head whipped up and Hermione stopped mid-sip of her coffee.
"Graham Montague, yes," he repeated, as if he hadn't heard the rest. "Let's get all hands on deck, I want Starr's locked down within the hour."
"Who?" Draco looked between him and the knee-high snowy owl made out of actual snow. A couple brown pebbles from the garden for the eyes, some twigs stuck into the bottom for the feet, the wings were lopsided but the right size and shape... It - it was Hedwig!
“It wasn’t my intention to - but really, the Patils could have sought out a buy-out! If their inventory is as good as they claim, they would’ve been quite comfortable. Loathe as I am to admit it - ”
Draco had given him his memories back, chunk by colossal chunk, and he felt as if he'd gained another lifetime. He spent over a decade telling himself it didn't matter, telling himself he didn't need a past. He told himself he could just live with the scars and the flashbacks, and he was content to push away the nightmares forever. But when he started the sessions, he realized he hadn't even been able to
“Awful people who don’t understand the craft, fools piddling about,” she says. “They’ve given it a cursed reputation. I hope you won’t condemn
Harry stood abruptly, but he only looked confused and worried, like any Muggle father whose children had just started riding gravity-challenged furniture round the kitchen. McGonagall brought the giggling, chattering boys back down. Arthur looked disappointed but gleeful while Alec's eyes were burning with curiosity. The boys launched into a thousand questions, and Monty barked some of his own for good measure. Sitting once more, Harry took in the scene with huge eyes. He chewed on his lip and traced patterns in the woodgrain of the table. He said nothing.
No. Cane. He was holding his cane in his right hand. For some reason. He hadn't been holding it before...right? Why would he? Why was he now? He leaned it once more against the table between his chair and Mr. Weasley's. Monty and Lupin were still watching. James pried his other hand away from Monty and lifted his fork to pick at the vegetables on his plate. On his temporarily-conjured-plate that was actually just nothing and would soon disappear into nothing again. Because magic.
“WAAAH-OOF!” A figure fell out of the tall oak tree near his bench and he rocketed to his feet, hurrying over to a little boy moaning in the grass.
Dinner came and went, the boys carried on in their room, and Monty - bless him - jerked his head upstairs, telling him to take the bed. James had hardly exchanged a dozen words with the man since Monday's row, and he wouldn't apologize for what he'd said. But he was so wiped he couldn't even summon up the energy to lament his pride as he half-crawled upstairs. Monty could have this one. James was tired.
Monty stood at the hob, cooking up a feast. That wasn't too unusual. They switched off on dinner duty and Monty tended to go overboard when it was his turn, leaving them leftovers for days. Which of course made it easier to claim he'd taken care of dinner on his other nights.
Malfoy's eyes widened while he took another note and Harry figured he had about fifteen minutes left before he called in a team of Mind Healers to cart him off to the loony bin.
When Ron and Hermione visited the Charming household that evening, it was without a reply to her self-invitation. James seemed grouchy and unsurprised when they arrived at the front door, but he offered them tea, set up the translation spell, and began a fumbling explanation.
James closed his eyes and took a great, shuddering, dramatic breath. Monty's stomach hurt; he caused this. He was trying to make things stronger between them. If James could only accept how much Monty had already done for him, if he could put aside his pride... But James was pale and dinner was thoroughly burned and Monty was still waiting for an answer. He was finished.
"No! No, no, NO!" he screamed hard enough to tear his throat. He was yanking hard on his hair, desperate for a flash of pain to stand out amongst the rest of it. "I don't want this, I SAID
I know you're definitely not fourteen anymore. You're an adult. You're going to - to pursue all of your wants and needs, and you
James rolled out of bed and hobbled stiffly over to the window to let the huge eagle owl inside. Healer Malfoy's owl. A grin stole over his face. He had worried that maybe his own message was lost when he didn't receive a reply by dinnertime yesterday.
Another round hurled more lightning into the ceiling. Bolts cracked at random into the floor, breaking up the clean white tiles and sending fire into James's veins while Rachel summoned shield after shield.
"A know that an' so do they," Monty soothed, reaching out to catch James's wrists. He pressed a sweet kiss to his lips and James again felt the urge to scream. He didn't want to calm down. He wanted to fight about this. He wanted to cancel dinner and rearrange the furniture upstairs. And buff the floors. And try that new aerating technique from the Japanese chocolatier that Al found on YouTube.
Harry and Monty had written once or twice on the Malfoy Mess. Monty was jealous of Harry's attention, Harry was feeling simultaneously lonely and smothered (though Ron had required Hermione to crack that code because Harry was still rubbish at expressing himself, even on paper). Ron and Hermione both thought they were being dramatic and uncommunicative, but now Ron could sort of see what Harry was talking about:
“Like a racist,” Potter croaks in apparent agreement as he slurps his stew directly from the bowl. Draco peeks over the arm of the chair and thinks he’d rather suck the stew right from Potter’s plump lips. The leather of the arm dips and the strange design grabs his eye again.
A few knowing titters from the spectators and Monty’s surprised but ever-supportive whoop from the sidelines. Ginny showed them how to properly mount the broom. Arthur was already floating but she called him back down and explained the importance of a proper kick-off. Alec’s palms were sweating as he gripped
Blue skin and red hair framed the copper-coil eyes that stared at him unnaturally. With a gasp and an almighty wrenching movement, James bolted upright, cramming both boys against his chest. His head brushed against the sheet overhead; he knocked into the twinkle lights and tore them down as he backpedaled desperately away from the grinning,
in size and much too close in color to his own skin. What was he trying to imply here? What he had to offer would just be a disappointment next to this! And it was so
reward Potter's puerile puns. And because he was looking away, he missed the moment Harry sank down onto the frosted ground, on one knee.
night," Monty said. Usually one to avoid any serious confrontation, Monty sounded uncharacteristically determined today. "Get through dinner wae these people, let ‘em see their old friend again."
The light fixtures hanging overhead were scarce and the illumination they provided under green glass shades was scant. A hippogriff of a jukebox stood proudly centered at the back wall, blaring something just this side of screeching, which Sirius would love. The floor was dominated by a billiards table with worn, grease-stained felt, and booths with padded benches packed every inch of space along the sides.
"Because of what Potter might say?" Draco pressed, knowing the answer. Blaise nodded jerkily, lowering the wand slightly. There was a pause. An almost mutually sympathetic moment between two people who might have once been friends, if Draco could place his captor's identity. Then: "How much did he see?"
He kept an eye on the little mirror next to the shop door from afar while he worked the counter, as if it were foe glass. He held entire conversations with Anne (albeit one-sided and in sign language) because he knew she was listening, just as Hedwig had.
"Da' said they didn' wan' anything tae do with him," Alec insisted, bending over the phone again with his tiniest pair of needle-nose pliers.
"Take a sabbatical, Weasley," Robards ordered, coming to stand in front of him and thereby blocking his view of Tony's blood on the floor. "Two weeks. See Jesse for your appointments - "
"What d'ye mean an extension?" Arthur asked blankly. "What kind?" Alec leaned over to whisper in his ear and his eyes went wide with excitement once more. "Can a sell the donuts?!" he cried.
"Actually, I'm here to speak with the family of Alexander and Arthur Charming," Remus began, pulling out two identical sealed letters.
"Aye," he confirmed somberly. "Took the 'hard tae get' game seriously, what wae the boys. An' tae tell the truth, a think Aarti goin' out when she did messed 'im up more than he lets on."
James clenched his jaw and for a moment looked as if he might throw the mug of hot tea at Draco’s face. An image of last night flashed in his mind - hurling chocolate at each other - but it was hazy, possibly just a dream.
Monty and James sat through round after round of questioning while a team of Healers and potioneers were questioned down the hall. A single ingredient had been substituted in James's pain potions - powdered graphorn horn in place of fluxweed - but the switch was not indicated on the label. It was not likely to be a mistake, given the cost of graphorn horn. The result was a potion that looked and acted exactly as the original supply of pain potions that James had received from St. Mungo's...except, if James were to cut himself, the wound wouldn't stop bleeding until he received a magical antidote.
"Their other father," Monty returned quickly, smirking in a way that was nothing less than a challenge. The boys narrowed their eyes, a united front, and Remus suddenly felt warm around the collar.
"A pleasure, Monty." But McGonagall was staring at Harry as she said it, confusion apparent on her face.
you. He never shied away from a challenge, and neither do you." He gestured vaguely around the flat to indicate, well, everything. His kids, his shop, his hard-won life.
"Okay..." It seemed like that would be enough to keep him out of trouble, but sometimes words decided to spill out of Scorpius's mouth without consulting him first: "Only - you're not being very mannerly, Mr. James. Manners matter."
It was an old tradition of theirs but still good. Better than going to bed, anyway. Dad (very carefully) colored his old sketches while he worked on new ones. Sometimes Alec joined them, sometimes he didn't. He couldn't remember when it had started exactly - he had vague memories of Dad coloring with them in their coloring books on the fold-out card table in their studio flat, using wax crayons and fat markers.
he added before closing their door again. He turned, seething, back to the bedroom and dragged Monty along with him.
, and began crawling out the other side of the worktable, away from Draco. He never should have been allowed to get himself into this mess, it was really all Sirius's fault -
"If you'd like to see where you'll be sleeping," Draco cut in loudly, "I'll reveal the coup de gras…."
Draco did some quick calculations before relaxing a fraction. Correct taste. Four hours. Surely any poison masquerading so well as a hangover potion would have taken effect by now.
He would not go back to a tiny studio flat and nightly blanket forts, and he wouldn't go back to working sixteen hour days just to get Gibbs Goddamn Goodies up and running.
“Take as long as you need - I’ll mind the shop!” he called over his shoulder. They listened to his descending footsteps and then James reluctantly set up his wand.
"Right. Went by James Smith at first, then they started callin' him Charming. The doctors made it official on the paperwork before he was discharged."
Draco takes pride in helping him find release. Honestly, he doesn't know how Harry would survive without him...the Weasels would probably come to drag him to Sunday lunch only to find him curled up in a solid ball of twisted, achey muscles. So Draco can't understand why Harry invites a touch to his neck, then an arm around his waist, even a hand gripping his arse, but not the icing on the cake. He settles into Draco's side, a perfect fit. He hums at the kiss to his ever-windswept hair. He closes his eyes and puffs a happy little sigh when Draco crooks his arm to card his fingers through his stupid hair.
"Yes, unless…" He heaves the useless git off his chest and they sit across from each other between the door and the bed, legs splayed, shirts soaked, trousers dampening dangerously fast—and not in a sexy way, unfortunately.
, James answered automatically. Though the old torch didn't work right, if anyone could find a way to burn down the city, it'd be Alec.
James repaired the old manicure station with a flick of his wand, marveling at how easy it would have been to renovate the shop with magic all those years ago. The vintage cash register would take some work; Alec had offered to work on it but James wouldn't hear another word about them returning to the shop anytime soon. He sent them back at Hogwarts early, where it was safe.
Draco laughs but continues to kiss him. The next few days without Harry were going to be hard. Harry finally pulls away and gets out of the car.
“That’s a nice thought. I hope I had friends. I like having friends. All of you… have been so good to me,” Pansy said.
Draco knows exactly what the fuck his date is doing, the bastard. Harry isn’t looking at Draco and it almost pisses him off. Almost. First and foremost on Draco’s mind is exactly how Harry knows he doesn’t have a gag reflex.
The woman rolled her eyes, walked over and with a slash of a fingernail, slit the man’s throat, his blood gushing out.
“Vampires. Yeah. That makes sense,” Harry said, stroking his chin and looking even less surprised than Draco thought.
Draco looks uncomfortable and Harry really wants to ease the mood back down. Harry casually sets a dark hand on Draco’s shoulder. Draco cracks a smile but makes no other movement. Harry desperately wants Draco to make the first move. Harry’s made the first move with girls a dozen times over but for some reason with Draco it’s different.
“I suppose. I don’t know if I can sleep. Maybe I’ll just lay here and listen to the radio,” Draco said, stuffing his trail mix back in his pack.
“Of course I have. But I just… never thought of myself as the sort of person who eats it deliberately.”
He cools off a bit on the drive. Tchaikovsky is back on but quieter. It starts to rain, a welcome sight after a long summer. They arrive in Columbia City faster than Harry expects. He’s disappointed as they pull back into the parking lot at his apartment.
“Sports. My mother would’ve sent me to a private Christian school but my father wasn’t having it. He also thought public school would toughen me up. I was such a sensitive boy. Or so he told me,” Draco says, more bad memories lurking beneath the surface.
Harry laughs and moves up to Draco’s face, giving him a slow kiss and a taste of his own dick. He pulls away again and says, “I want you to tell me what to do. Where do you want me? How do you want me?”
"Well my friends Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Harry Potter and I, have caught a criminal, and we would like him to be detained and questioned under veritaserum."
And I practically hear the smirk in his voice as he says that last line, making me chuckle and nod. I part from his comfort with a grateful smile.
I make my way down to the kitchens and decide to make raspberry tarts and a couple croissants for the teachers and one Slytherin. I get to work and finish once the house elves arrive. They all greet me happily and I'm reunited with an excited Daisy. She was so relieved to see me come back and we both were in charge of making the banana muffins and fresh pumpkin juice. The juice was easy since we used magic for the whole thing, but we made the muffins the muggle way.
Harrys eyes are full of indignant anger at the scene and Ron just wears an unsettled look of distaste worthy of a gold medal in my opinion. By this point the rest of the Weasley's have joined us and are wearing what I call their battle faces. I just watch the match between Ron's father and Lucius with sharp eyes and find that my gaze lingers at Ginny's cauldron.
"Sirius said Pettigrew was an animagus and he could transform into a rat. He saw the picture of your family in Egypt and said he would recognize Peter anywhere, even in his rat form."
Finally it's the last package and I give it to Harry to open. His hands tremble slightly once he is about to pull out the first item with wide eyes. I place a hand on the pendant and send him comfort and affection. He looks up at me and he looks much more assured and in awe. Out comes a shimmering velvet green winter cloak and black carved out clasps. He bites his lip and his eyes become misty just as he rubs the cloth in between his fingers after folding it neatly in his lap. Next comes out dress shirts in light pastel colors and correlating knitted jumpers that I knew would be just adorable on him. The comfy shirts come next and I can practically see the disbelief and gratefulness coming off him in waves as he moves on to the pants. He pulls out a pair of black silk pajamas and peers into the box to see the multiple shoes I got him. Oxfords, converse, boots, and slippers.
I let out a breath knowing it was bound to happen and just went with it. He frowns slightly and pulls the sleeve down before resolutely nodding once and then leading the way out. I just raise an eyebrow in question, wondering what in the world went through this curly Ravens mind, but he just keeps facing forward and walking all while not dropping my hand.
I nod as I take in the information and after a few seconds of silence Draco takes a quick glance at me and smiles softly. My cheeks feel a little warmer and I try to distract myself with what he's doing to not do something embarrassing.
I give a laugh at that, though its more of odd breathy sounds and shaking shoulders, and nod along with him. as I clearly remember being at the end of Pansy's attention constantly. I give him a pat on the back and a reassuring look before taking the cooked waffle out of the maker. We pass the time like that until I'm all finished and we both go our separate ways in the hall, since it was still too early for Daisy and the others to come down and make breakfast.
What a turn-around his life had had since September, when the very thought of sending his boys away had torn him apart. Now Monty was taking up his old mantle, claiming magic was dangerous and he should flee for his life. Ron assured him that Monty was safe, that his memories of two nights ago proved their Polyjuice theory. But that didn't make it any less jarring to hear Monty's voice berating him in that voicemail.
you last month!" he cried. James lifted his head from his hands, eyes darting to the kitchen door, and Hermione raised a
"My turn!" Arthur floated his gifts over to them and James had to duck to avoid getting brained. "Oops, sorry..."
"You went from seeing him on the front page to appearing next to him in the sports section." Draco could see the cogs turning in Blaise's mind. The blasted Pisces
Draco sat back as he felt something ease in his chest. James hadn’t asked about his hair because he hadn’t any clue what a traumatic ordeal he had experienced on his behalf. He’d assumed it was a
Monty blinked at that, his mind running through all the possible things it could mean before it hit him like a sack of flour. Because it could really only mean one thing.
revealed to have cast the Cruciatus Curse. They learned that Harry had asked for a moment of privacy from his DMLE guard, a moment to himself to visit his parents, a moment of peace. And that was the last anyone heard from him for twelve years.
The other two walls were more homely; less for business, more for family. A heavy wooden table, looking centuries old and impossible to move, jutted out from the wall on the right, some half-dozen mismatched wooden chairs surrounding it. Books and comics were stacked up neatly on the end that was nestled against the wall, and the strangest metallic figure stood at the head of the table:
Even after months of (freely) wandering the city, he would never take for granted the feeling of his shoes against uneven, unpredictable pavement instead of the same smooth concrete floor. Several hours went by and he found himself in Ravenscourt Park, dragging his feet through the grass and reveling in the scent of nature in the middle of a city.
"Monty's not crazy," she insisted. "You're just not seeing eye to eye here and you're letting your emotions get the best of you. And - " She paused to consider the best way to phrase this. "You are - that is, you've been..." she sighed. "What you remember of your past, so much of it must be frightening. For ages after the war, I couldn't stand large open spaces. It's a logistical nightmare if something were to happen, there's no way to take cover, it just makes for an easy target." She shifted in her seat. It had taken years of stubborn work to get over that particular fear of hers.
They inevitably fight, but it's no longer the same cold battle. There's life in their fight. The windows reflect the flames and Draco can't see that horrible void anymore.
And that was one of the oddest things he had experienced these past twelve years. Even odder than getting hit by that car, which Arthur had darted in front of, and walking away without a scratch… He had finally met someone who didn't just look faintly familiar, but
Arthur started in on his, mumbling about favorites, before crying out in shock. "NO WAY!" he shouted. "NO F - NO FLIPPIN' WAY!" James snorted. Arthur held in his lap a huge book, two feet long and a foot wide, as well as a series of smaller catalogue-style books.
The effect of those words was instantaneous. James covered his face again and slouched over the table, looking defeated and exonerated all at once. She glared daggers at Ron and moved her tea aside, shifting closer to James to run a hand up and down his back.
from the center refrigerator. Draco dogs his heels the whole time. Harry slams the door, whirls around, and throws his paper bag and himself at the nearest table. It’s the sort of table that can split at the center to fold up; a caddy of napkins, straws, and salt & pepper shakers sits on the centerline gap and Harry drags it over. Draco joins him, perching delicately on the round edge of the table.
"On the phone? Wh-what did he want?" she whispered. Remus mentioned last night that he had left their number for this Montgomery Gibbs man because his own cottage didn't have a phone, but he also said that he didn't expect him to actually call.
"Some spaces have the most exquisite angles the higher you look," Pansy the mad genius said. "What's up there? What lights up your space when the sun goes down?"
“My mother taught me the art,” she says, giving the cauldron another stir and whispering something under her breath. Steam billows out, filling the room with a mesmerizing scent. It sends Draco’s head spinning and he suddenly can’t remember why all the fuss… After all, House Elves combine cooking and magic all the time. What’s the harm of wizard magic? “She says it’s an act of love. Of devotion to the crafts. Witchery and cooking, that is.”
, James tried, making the symbol again and again. He gave a tentative smile through his own annoyance.
Unable to answer with both hands on his boys' backs, he simply shrugged. He felt numb. Simultaneously numb and overwhelmed with images from today, from twelve years ago. Surges of random panic - as if he'd just realized he left the stove on or something - out of nowhere, stealing his breath and sending his heart racing -
"Tell me what I want to know," he said in that low, dangerous voice. Draco rather thought he might be through with the schoolyard curses.
Ben drops his disgusting smile and wraps his large hands around Harry's arms, hauling him back to bed. Harry squirms and jerks about, trying to free his elbows, which Ben has learned by now to hold back. He is held down by a single hand on his chest while Ben goes to cover him up again and Harry bends himself in half to kick him in the stomach. Ben hardly seems to feel it and Harry screams nonsensically.
Harry acts out against Draco and Viktor, which lands him in a spot of trouble with the wrong side of HR. He escapes, only to stumble upon a mystery in the warehouse behind Voldecorp ™ .
Monty dissolved in a fit of choking giggles while the boys groaned. Alec subtly brought the radio down toward the desk, increasing the static interference through the next part until he thought they might be in the clear of more dirty jokes.
"Only a Gryffindor would think a stroll through the Forbidden Forest is a sensible alternative to class."
"Get off the train, you nutter!" Ron laughed from the corridor. Remus and Teddy arrived at his side, peering into the compartment curiously.
, James knew that one. Intimately. The rushing sound, the sickly green light, the wave of dark energy - it encompassed his senses and he threw himself to the floor on instinct. Leapt to his feet and surged forward on instinct. Kept not-Monty from getting any farther into their home on instinct.
Harry's familiar green eyes landed on him but there was no familiarity in his gaze. Just confusion, worry, impatience… Complete and utter confusion.
Monty was already on the phone with emergency services when his eye caught the potions by the sink. James took three potions every day: one in the morning for joint health, and two split between morning and evening for pain management. Something like that was likely to show up in the bloodwork. So he rang up the Weasley-Granger residence and Hermione got them to St. Mungo's.
Scorpius nodded. "Mine means scorpion, but I don't like scorpions as much as Daddy likes dragons and I don't want any on my bed."
Draco turned on his heel at his father's voice. Lucius's hair was drawn back and he was dressed in fine clothes, though they were a bit outdated. His eyes were shifty, as they always were these days, and he seemed to either blink too often or not at all. Draco followed his currently-unblinking-gaze to the red owl that sat on the windowsill, waiting for a possible reply.
Scorpius was tagging along on their next outing, which was equal parts delightful and distressing. On one hand, Harry had no experience with children and anything new was cool as heck. On the other hand, he had no experience with children and he was terrified of this tiny, demanding, self-assured Draco clone.
“What’s wrong with pizza? Less civilized than pancakes?” Harry says, coming to sit down next to Draco.
“We’ve done all we can. Our witches are working to free the Dark Lord’s servant from her binding. Once that happens… none of us are going to want to be here,” the older male vampire said.
“It is. Never have I ever… made out with the guy I’m dating in the bathroom of a party my friends are throwing,” Draco says, grinning as he drinks.
Harry sighs with exasperation and complies. The dick strikes again. He puts his phone aside and goes to bed.
The car isn’t ready until three in the afternoon, Draco and Harry having wandered all around the town. It is a nice enough place but there isn’t much to do. It also rains intermittently and neither of them have umbrellas.
“Do you know this name? Can you remember it?” Harry asked, showing Draco the paper, his finger pointing at the words ‘Godric’s Hollow’.
Draco felt petrified, not knowing how he should answer. He reminded himself that the world was falling apart and nothing mattered anymore. What was the worst that could happen? Who could fault him for having this one, small thing before he died?
“No problem. I’m not offended,” Harry said, frankly wishing Draco would walk around shirtless more often.
“No. I’m sorry. I’m not feeling all right. I’m having some amnesia,” Harry said, deciding to be honest.
“They came to my house, of course. I fought them off but I could see the house on fire when I left,” Harry said.
No. Stop that. Mind out of the gutter, Draco chides himself. This is why he needs to play it cool with Harry. The last thing, the
“I want you to go to him. Help him. Save him. Bring him back here. But tonight… give me tonight. You can leave in the morning,” Astoria said, her finger tracing his jawline.
“No. You see the other person I cared about… the other person I desired,” Draco said then turned around to face Harry before saying, “was you.”
Draco glanced at Harry with a frown and said, “I had a dream last night, Harry. I dream about a lot of things. I dream about the president. I dream about… other worlds. Monsters. I dream that we’re living in a dream.”
“You, Pansy, and this guy at a gay club. That was how I figured it out. Or confirmed. I went to a gay club and there was this guy. We kissed for half a second. It was barely anything.”
“Honey, vampires have super hearing. I could say Godric’s Hollow on the other side of this clearing and you’d hear me. Stop playing dumb,” the dark-haired woman snapped.
The hum in the basement was still loud and present but Harry had learned to tune it out. Once he had near sleepwalked downstairs in the middle of the night. After that, they started keeping it locked. Mercifully the TV volume also helped to tune it out.
Draco’s head slowly tilts up again and Draco steps back, breathing hard. Harry seems uncertain of what to do. Draco tilts his head towards the door.
Draco flashes back to being eight years old. His father yelling at him about duty and loyalty and being a man. Draco’s indiscretion? Knocking over a wineglass onto some of his father’s work papers. Christ, he can remember it so clearly like it happened only yesterday. He shivers and pushes it out of his mind.
Draco complies, doing the other side then back again. It’s not so bad once Harry is used to it. After several rounds on his back, Draco goes back to his ass, using it to pop him harder than he could with his hand. Harry relaxes and lets the sensations happen, swimming in endorphins. Time loses meaning. There’s only him, Draco, and the flogger now.
Harry drives to Capitol Hill in a near trance his dick continues to strain against his jeans as his heart flutters. He parks around the corner from Draco’s apartments for lack of any parking space there. It’s nice but not as nice as Harry expects. He’s on the third floor. A corner apartment with a good view of Downtown Seattle. He knocks on the door, his heart pounding out of his chest.
Harry reaches up and unzips him then uses both hands to unbutton him. He pulls apart his belt then pulls his pants and underwear down enough for it to pop out. It’s a sight to behold. When standing straight up it the head reaches up to where Draco’s belly button probably is. Calling it thick is an understatement. Draco is right. Best not to try anal tonight. At least not with that.
The closet flung open. Draco could see a bright light roaming around. Draco held his breath and tried to be as still as possible. She was going to see them. How could she not?
Pansy was kind of the one who figured it out. You remember her, right? Pansy Parkinson. She joked about me being gay for years. Because I got so obsessed over guys. And other stuff. It’s kind of embarrassing. Finally I… tested the waters and found out she wasn’t totally off-base. I’m bi.
And then Draco had fallen for Astoria. He loved her more than he had ever loved anyone, maybe even more than Harry, only with Astoria he lacked the painful history he had with Harry. Astoria was a good person, a better person than Draco had ever known, despite her own dark past. She hadn’t made Draco get over Harry but she at least numbed the pain of not being with him.
Harry’s right. Within an hour Draco is feeling better. Hermione and Ginny call an Uber to take them both home. Neville goes to bed and Cho passes out on the couch. Ron quietly sits nearby playing video games.
Pansy was latched on hard, Bellatrix screaming as she threw her head back. Harry ran forward as Bellatrix elbowed Pansy off. Harry swung with his golden light, knocking Bellatrix back into the side of the mausoleum, cracking the concrete. Bellatrix hit the ground, not moving.
“It’s easy. One of us will say a thing they haven’t done. All of us who have done the thing they haven’t done will take a drink for three seconds. Then the next person in the circle says something they haven’t done. Whoever ends up being the last one with vodka in their cup wins.”
“I don’t know. I want what everyone wants. To be fulfilled. To feel like I’m doing what I’m meant to be doing. I don’t know what that is,” Draco says, anxiety rising up from his belly.
Draco has lowlight on his bedroom. Harry recognizes it from his sexy photos. That feels like an eternity ago now.
Draco was surprised to find the backdoor unlocked. He opened it, then closed and locked it quickly. He stood there with his hand against the door, breathing hard. He jerked as there were sounds of footsteps coming from above. He quickly looked around the dark of the room he was in, appearing to be a kitchen. He couldn’t see anywhere to hide as the footsteps came down the stairs.
“Christ. You must have a concussion. I’m calling a doctor,” the woman said, heading off into another room.
Draco rests his head against Harry’s hand. What is it about this man that makes him feel so calm? So safe.
“I don’t know, Alicia. We should take her with us. If her memory comes back she might be useful,” Angelina said.
He didn’t have to wait long for a bus. He wondered if anyone would call him now that his phone was at least a little charged. No calls. No texts. Whoever Draco Malfoy was, no one seemed to miss him.
Draco gets on the bed. Harry feels his dick touch Harry’s lower back, rubbing up against his crack. Just the thought of it being inside him is insane but he wants it. Eventually. Draco slaps him with it, making loud popping sounds.
“Well… if I am gonna die… I’ll be honored to do it by your side,” Draco said, touching Harry’s shoulder.
“Did you hear the news this morning? Liberals are saying the president has some dark project he’s working on. Wiping out towns. Typical liberals. Always acting like fuckin’ martyrs. There’s this website saying that he’s evil. Like literally evil. As a Christian I find that insulting. The president is a god fearing man,” the man said.
“Fuck, daddy,” Harry utters, Draco growling in response, the vibrations on Harry’s dick making him squirm.
Next, they play Settlers of Catan, a game he has actually heard of. Harry performs terribly. Draco does ok. Ginny wins the game. Draco decides to go outside and get some fresh air. He’s not so high anymore. He sometimes thinks he should start smoking cigarettes just for the excuse. The truth is he just likes having quiet for his own thoughts. And right now his thoughts are very Harry-centric and he thinks the cool night air might ease his hormones.
“Depends. If you bury yourself you have a stronger bond. You’ll be able to read her thoughts and control her,” Angelina said.
“I’m me. I swear the story behind everything is less interesting than it seems,” Neville says, looking very embarrassed.
The girls made quick work of three of the vampires, the fourth running off so Pansy chased her. She ran around a barn and Pansy threw her sword, impaling her into the sword of the barn.
She drifted out into the woods again, silently wandering. She occasionally so strange flashes of light in the distance but couldn’t make out what they were. A wolf howled and Pansy was momentarily frightened. But then she realized she could probably kick a wolf’s ass if she wanted to. Not that she would. The idea was upsetting actually.
The most disturbing thing about all the missing people was that no one, aside from the lucky few, seemed to remember them. It was as if they no longer existed.
“Yeah, I feel tired now too,” Harry said and Draco felt himself slip away, Harry sliding in next to him, Draco’s arms wrapping around him.
Draco touched Harry’s back, strangely feeling the confidence to provide physical affection for once.
“Even so. I used to go to school with them. I think I can smell Harry. Like if he were near or somethin’,” Pansy explained.
“You don’t need to tell me that you never felt that way about me. I’m OK with that. I get it,” Draco said.
Draco curls his long-fingered hand and taps his knuckle against the door. The door quickly opens and Ron Weasley is standing on the other side.
“How the fuck do you think it went? I was into it. Really into it. But I kept having sex with Pansy, hoping I could work it out. I just needed to fuck the gay out of my system. But all the time I was with her I was thinking of-“
“I’m afraid they don’t. Astoria, the things I’m hearing. This is the end game. I think something big is going to happen in Godric’s Hollow. I don’t even know if I can stop it if I do go there,” Draco said.
“Now, how about we turn the lights off, strip down to our underwear and have ourselves a good and hard… sleep,” Harry says, giving Draco a peck on the lips then rolling over to turn off his lamp.
Pansy sat alone in Darlene’s house, unsure of what she should be doing. The sun had finally set. She supposed it wouldn’t hurt her anymore. She’d convinced Darlene not to tell the ambulance about her when they came. It wasn’t hard. They both knew that things would go badly if that happened. If people threatened her she didn’t think she’d be able to stop herself.
.” Draco says it with his typical smugness but since he was paying Harry a compliment he can’t be mad.
“Those bastards tore through this neighborhood. I think they were looking for me. I’m trying to find survivors but… everyone is dead or missing,” Harry said.
“Oh,” Draco said, remembering that he had never really liked Cedric, though he had to admit that Cedric was very handsome.
“Oh, I won’t. I’ll leave you something nice to wake up to. Oh, and by the way. What you were asking in the bathroom? When Ron interrupted us? The answer is yes, it is. And remember: I don’t lie about that,” Draco says and winks, turning on the engine to his car.
“God, who is that?” Draco called out, desperately looking away from the shower as he went to wash his mouth in the sink.
“Damn. You got lucky,” Alicia said, swinging down hard, knocking Pansy’s sword out of her hands again.
He pulls up into Harry’s parking slot, nice and easy. Harry is leaning against the wall wearing tight blue jeans, held in place by a brown, probably faux-leather, belt that reminds Draco of the western wear that his father used to wear when they would go to their Colorado summer home when he was a child. On top, he’s wearing a Seahawks tee-shirt. Draco wonders if he should start watching football.
Draco didn’t reply at first. This was all so strange. What were the odds that he would bump into Harry like this? He wondered if on some level he had sensed Harry. He could sense Astoria like that too.
“What? I’m being honest. Don’t worry, it’s weirdly attractive,” Harry says then leans down to kiss him.
“But that’s the thing. We were friends. I came to trust and respect you, especially after you found a way to end that curse. I saw what it did to you even if I didn’t know what you had to do. You could’ve come to me…” Harry said.
His roommates are on the couch playing Playstation. Harry isn’t that into games but he does like to watch sometimes.
“Oh. You wanna be one of us? Uh… I mean I guess I could. I’ve never done that before. But you seem nice. And I’ll be a real good maker. I’ve heard some horror stories about bad makers,” Pansy said then sunk her teeth into her wrist, her blood pouring out of the wound.
“Harry. I just wanted to say… I’m sorry.” He doesn’t meet Harry’s eyes as he says this, looking at the steering wheel instead.
Draco looked at Harry, observing the strength of his jawline and the fullness of his lips. Until today he hadn’t really thought about it but he was definitely not straight. He wondered whether or not they had been more than friends before they lost their memories. What if this attraction was something chemical or deeply rooted in the brain? What if he had learned this attraction the way one learns how to ride a bike? He still knew how to do lots of things despite no memory of his past life. Maybe this was just another skill he’d learned.
Draco lays back on the bed, his stomach making sounds. Harry exits the bathroom and says, “Are you hungry?”
“It was a trick question. I love them both. But if I had to pick I would go with dogs so you win double big.”
Harry nods and gets his juice from the fridge, heading back into the bedroom. He hasn’t seen his ex-girlfriend, Ron’s sister, Ginny in months. He has a feeling she will be amused by recent developments in his life.
Draco only felt his arousal becoming more unbearable and it took all his strength to prevent him from sliding closer to Harry and to stop himself from touching himself. Christ, this was so unfair.
“That sounds great but I still kinda want to… just… sink my teeth into you. Yeah, that sounds good,” Pansy said.
Pansy swiftly grabbed his arm, popping it with a hard snap, Charlie screaming as his broken arm hung limply. Darlene was screaming about something but Pansy didn’t care, climbing onto Charlie’s back to sink her teeth into his throat.
Harry blinks but nods and they carry on. Five minutes later Draco says, “So, what about your relationships? Why didn’t they work out?”
Saturday flies by and it’s Sunday morning soon enough. Harry is keeping it simple with a tight grey tee-shirt and dark grey cargo shorts along with his pack. Draco pulls up and gets out of the car. He’s decked out in flannel and a good set of hiking pants. He’s wearing a beanie to top it all off, which Harry finds incredibly cute.
“How did you figure out you were bi? Saying you started being honest with yourself isn’t an answer.”
“Well. I do get out of the house. Roam around Capitol Hill, Downtown, Fremont. All around there. I go to Gasworks to read sometimes. On Sundays, I sometimes attend St. Mark’s Cathedral. It’s beautiful and peaceful.”
Draco flies out of the car, thinking to look under the hood but he doesn’t know a damn thing about cars. Harry is also out of the car, pulling out his phone.
“Sorry. I just feel so much… wasted time. Time spent doing anything except what I wanted to be doing.”
“No. I don’t know. Maybe we have heat vision or something. I haven’t been a vampire for long. I think,” Pansy said.
want to kill you. But I do want to drain every last drop of blood from your body. You can see my dilemma,” Pansy said, sighing with annoyance.
“That’s unfortunate. Anyhow, beyond that… well, the truth is most of the things I like to do I did with Pansy. Since I broke up with her I’ve been… bored.”
“Yeah. So, then there was all that business with me and Hermione. The curse. There was only one way to break it… And even after I did… It was like I died. I didn’t feel whole anymore. Not until I met Astoria. But even now… Anyhow, to break the curse I had to kill someone I cared about. Someone I had desired. There… weren’t many options,” Draco admitted.
He didn’t think there was a sliver of a chance that he’d be able to sleep while the sun was still up but he wasn’t sure what else there was to do. Draco suspected the Death Troopers had moved on. They had more undesirables to root out. Godric’s Hollow wasn’t the only place where people knew about the supernatural and
He takes a deep breath and opens his messages, quickly scrolling to the top. He clicks on the first picture. It’s Draco, naked from the waist up, the photo ending just short of his groin. Draco’s body looks better than even Harry could imagine. He looks up at his face. Draco is dragging a finger down his bottom lip, his grey eyes looking ready to give Harry want he wants. Harry’s eyes go down. Draco is quite thin but his lean muscles are quite appealing. Harry can imagine his fingers sliding over them, enjoying all his has to offer.
Harry fake coughed before walking into the kitchen. Draco, who was standing shirtless at the stove, cooking what smelled like chili in a saucepan, still jumped a little but at least he didn’t shout like the last time.
Their search for the werewolf Fenrir Greyback, who was working with the Death Troopers and had turned Katie’s girlfriend, Leanne, into a werewolf as well was getting to be exhausting.
All the power was out as far as he could see. This was it. Everything was going straight to hell. Draco ran, deciding leap over a fence, thinking he could better lose his follow by going through yards and just hoping that no dogs were outside. He ran straight into some hedges and willed himself to climb over them, hopping over the fence behind them.
Harry allows himself a glance down, seeing what appeared to be a substantial bulge in Draco’s pants as expected, though he can’t make out much in the dark. He’s just glad he’s not the only one.
He was breathing hard and sounded urgent. Draco felt no compulsion to prolong Harry’s suffering and fumbled with the button and the zipper of his jeans for just a moment before he slid Harry’s shaft out of his boxers. Harry moaned softly as Draco wrapped his hand around Harry’s thickness, barely able to get his fingers around it. It felt so hot and hard and Draco could feel Harry’s pulse.
“What the hell?” a vampire said as Angelina removed his head from his body, his body turning to ash in seconds.
“This is so weird, Darlene. I feel like eating you. Isn’t that weird? Like… who the fuck wants to eat a person?” Pansy said, getting closer.
Once inside Harry moved aside an ironing board and Draco squeezed behind it with Harry pushing himself in front of Draco, putting the ironing board in front of them and sweeping clothes in front of the ironing board.
“Fair enough. I guess it makes sense to stay here a few nights-“ Draco started but Harry shook his head.
“Yeah. I own a house up in Lake City. A big one. Sounds like it was sold to me a few years ago but I can’t figure out who by. Which is weird too,” Harry said.
Somehow that peck feels more intimate than most of their make-out kisses. You don’t give pecks to someone you’re just dating. You give pecks to a boyfriend. Draco isn’t a boyfriend but damn that felt natural.
Harry’s mouth fell open. Draco winks and they carry on. An hour in and Draco seems fine. Good even. He glows. They occasionally come across other hikers and cyclists and say polite hellos.
She then went around and found a hole in the barn she could crawl through while her friends continued their fight. The sounds seemed to be coming from a stall where Pansy thought you would normally keep a cow, though she wasn’t sure exactly.
Draco makes a little tut sound then whispers again, “When I get home I’m going to get on Tinder and tell you every single thing I want to do to you. What do you think about that?”
“I don’t know if I have one? I used to really love Paramore. I listen to a lot of pop and hip-hop while I’m working out or just out doing stuff. I need to dust off my old CD collection. Spotify has ruined my musical tastes.”
“It’s a challenge. Obviously. It’s also really sexy. Just holding it turns me on. It’s so… heavy,” Harry says and slaps it against Draco’s stomach, making them both laugh.
Two years before Harry Potter had lead a battle against the Dark Lord’s right hand woman, Bellatrix Lestrange. A bunch of people disappeared after that battle. Draco hadn’t been there but he had heard it was devastating and rather than defeating her, Bellatrix was bound to the town, unable to escape. Draco wasn’t sure what would happen if she ever escaped but it probably wouldn’t be good.
Draco covered his mouth while Harry finished up. Harry pressed a towel to Draco’s abdomen and said, “Hold this. It looks like the bleeding has mostly stopped but just in case.”
She was shaking. It was a cold night. Pansy wished she had something to cover her with. Her clothes were torn and tattered as it was. Pansy touched her fingers to Daphne’s throat. Her pulse was faint and fading. She was dying. Pansy could feel it.
“Yeah. And unfortunately, you’re gonna need us to stay here to protect you. We’re gonna keep watch. There’s probably not any more vamps but we can’t be certain. Just watch her. She’s your responsibility now,” Angelina said and the girls walked outside.
It’s Draco’s turn. He thinks for a moment then says, “Never have I ever stolen something from someone else’s home.”
“I don’t want to leave them, Daph. They took me in. They took me in after I’d just killed a guy. I can’t leave them.
At Longview, Draco heads west towards the Oregon coast. It’s just past noon, having hit the road three hours before. At some point, he needs to stop for gas. He can’t remember when he last filled the tank.
Harry wasn’t sure why he had come back to the Hollow. Perhaps it was loyalty. He knew he should go back to Seattle to live in the house that Remus and Sirius had left him. They had both disappeared too. Possibly into the dream world. He wanted to go after them but he couldn’t be sure that’s where they were.
His lips are soft like silk, gliding against Harry’s full lips in perfect sync. Harry’s hands somehow find Draco’s sides, pulling him closer. Harry’s body is alive and hungry, his pants suddenly feeling tight. It’s half the excitement of making out with a hot guy and half the excitement of making out with Draco Malfoy. Harry is turned on by the subversiveness of his enemy’s soft lips.
I have a godfather who by the sound of it wants to see me so much he breaks out of Wizarding prison! I grin at the thought before grimacing at Petunias shriek for me to make the food, for aunt Marges arrival. Ugh I can't imagine how this day will end.
I write those words out with a certainty bone deep it almost hurts to have them in front of me, out in reality.
I nod expecting as much. Harry and I make it to the room and we get our robes and ties, though I make my way to Ron and shake him lightly. "Hey Ron you need to get up or you'll be late", I was only greeted with a groan so I took out a muffin and placed it near his face. He immediately picked up on the smell and woke up to see me with the muffin in hand and I put it in his hand. He grins and everyone else in the dorm starts to laugh as he struggles to take a bite and shimmy into an article of clothes at the same time.
I sigh with a nod and Sev gives me a hug before saying his farewells and leaving. I make my way to my closet and pick out a pair of black trousers, and a long sleeved dark grey button up. I put on a black silk vest tucking my shirt in my pants and grabbing a dark cobalt blue over coat. I then slip on a pair of thin black socks and some nice leather oxfords. The only acceptable muggle clothes that my parents allow are from the early1900's so I finish the look with a pocket watch. I hated to admit that I favored this style as well but shrug my shoulders and just stay grateful for my mother buying me an entire new wardrobe this summer full of items like these. Maybe she's softening up to me...... I hope that's what it is.
"Even if the curse runs it's course I'll still be happy because I got to spend the rest of my life with you Pans....... And I think that if I do end up caring for Harry more than I do at the moment it wont matter if he returns the sentiment, because no matter what kind of love I have, its better than none. Even if that's unrequited love."
They began to notice that things were never black and white and I was extremely proud at their revelation which brought a smile to Draco's face. Once we were all finished with our snack we all meditated together and honestly it was great. The air was so much clearer and everyone felt at ease and new. We ate dinner together that was partly made by Draco with some of my help and partly smuggled food from Dobby,  as the others looked at more morally grey spells.
It's quiet and Sev just looks somber. "He comes back, doesn't he?" I just nod yes and I tangle my hands in my hair.
I remember all of us in the dorm trekking down the stairs to see Mione rush up to us and explain the explosions from the night were caused by a bout of emotional magic according to the scans Dumbledoor did. I looked to the guys and we all had the same thought but never said a word to anyone, not even Mione. After that Draco spent his days working furiously on something, sometimes forgetting to eat or sleep. Somewhere deep inside me thought maybe he did it on purpose most nights so as to avoid sleeping. I felt like I was failing him when I would see dark circles under his eyes. The mature silver eyes that glistened with both knowledge and life now looked more exhausted and burdened with each passing day.
"I'm afraid you can't talk about Hermione's hair when yours looks like something died in it, ever heard of a brush."
Once were at breakfast with the others we update them on what happened this morning, and with the help of the potions I was able to wish them a hello. They were overjoyed at my progress and insisted I speak as little as possible to not harm my vocal chords. And with that everyone was joking around and talking about what assignment was causing them trouble or what was going on around the school today, with giant smiles. The day passed fairly similarly to all the others until I was in history of magic with Harry and I had a very delightful story time of my past life.
I peer down from my spot and spell away the stairs I’d made, as I quickly put my map and spelled writing quill into the pocket of my disillusioned cloak. I bite my lip and quietly make my way down the corridors ready to just shower and fall asleep. The moon light shines through the windows off of my snowy hair making me aware of just how late it is. But I had to do it now since the guys had taken to sticking close to me in an effort to delay my plan to go through the protective barriers of the artifact.
Dobby came in with a pop and quickly took my note somewhat in distress, and with a concerned thank you on my part he winked out of existence once more. I took a shower and stared at my reflection, after wiping the condensation from the reflective surface, for a few moments. I had definitely hit a growth spurt over the summer thanks to being able to eat on a regular basis and I couldn't help but like how I was coming along in my physique.
He looks so excited as he grins and thanks McGonagall and Wood for this chance and we both make our way to dinner since we missed charms, thank god for it being excused.
I never knew house elves were so possessive, but it made me feel warm anyways. I asked daisy if the others could keep it a secret that Blaise comes here to help out and learn all about cooking and baking, because he would be in really big trouble if others found out. She nods with determination and puts her hands on her hips.
"young man you have no present injuries but I'm picking up several recent injuries from cursed items. You must know that cursed items are not to be used and are prohibited, so I must ask that if you come into contact with any or own any you must turn them in. Now hand any over and I will let you off with a warning."
"Hello, so you're going to Hogwarts then?" He looks at me and nods yes timidly. I'm not sure if it's just because he's new to the wizarding world or for school. So I give him a faint smile and say, "it's alright you don't have to be nervous, Hogwarts is an amazing school. You'll find some friends really fast, I can tell." His green eyes stare at me and something flickers in his too wide eyes for a moment before he holds out his hand, "my names Harry, would you like to be my friend?" For half a second my heart skips a beat and in the next I give him a sad smile as I shake his hand. "My names Draco , and yes I would like to be friends." He gives me a dazzling smile and his glasses tilt to one side making me chuckle.
He tightens his hold on me and says a soft vulnerable thank you. I just humm a relaxing melody as I card my fingers through his long ringlet black curls. He eventually pulls away with happy hopeful eyes and a watery smile. I return his watery smile and look him in the eyes as I say, "Blaize I really do promise to be with you and help you through anything, it doesn't matter what it is, even if later your going to be forced to be a death eater. It doesn't matter I will help you. Or if you don't get treated well with your family, I know how it feels and I'll help"
I laughed and stood up with her in my arms and spun around making her giggle. I set her down grinning and turned to Blaise, who was watching with wide eyes and his mouth wide open. I laughed and introduced them to each other. Daisy was ecstatic to meet, "My Draco's best friend".
I could tell from everyone's facial expressions that they were torn between their hate and sympathy towards Tom.
"It's awful Sev, it's just so dark and he takes over the manor later. He ruins everything, destruction and death is at every corner. Everyday I was tortured for their entertainment Sev, it hurt so much. So many people die and no one is left unscathed. I came back to help...... to make things right. With my help their will still be war but the casualties will be far less than before, too many people died. But Sev I can't do this alone, I need you please. You're all I have left Sev. I used an ancient artifact in the Malfoy family, it grants you your deepest desire but it comes with a price. It-it took away mothers love from me. She was my light as a kid growing up in a cell of a house with an abusive father and then the war, she was my strength. She's gone now, and I know last time you cared for me enough to help me. Heh.... You know I always wished that you were my father? You were always gentle and ignored when I flinched, you gave me comfort without even holding me. Just by being near you, you calmed me down, and helped me when I would faint from my anemia. Please don't leave me alone in this. I need you."
Blaise puts away his calm facade when were finally alone and I bring him into a hug to calm down his no doubt warring emotions. He quickly accepts and relaxes in the comfort I'm giving.
While Ron nods and Harry scoots closer to me for comfort. I nod but reprimand myself to be more careful. I see Harry's a bit pale still, so I reach for the pendant and pour out warm comfort to him. He smiled and his lovely sun kissed skin tone comes back. I put a hand on his forearm in understanding and wait a minute before breaking the news to the others about Pettigrew.
"Harry I want to tell you so much.... I just didn't want you to have to worry about anything an eleven year old shouldn't. I want you to be happy and have fun. To be a kid while I deal with the other things."
I smile and open my arms. Barely a second passes and she's in my arms letting a few tears spill. I just hold her and move my hands in circular motions on her back.
I knew that i most likely looked positively insane and it wasn't until I had thrown mug number six and had lucky number seven clenched in my right hand, ready to come crashing down, did I see a figure in the door way. I stopped mid throw, the mug dangling precariously, to try and analyze the situation I've just landed myself in.
But a bright light begins to shine from Draco and I'm terrified, is the curse taking away all evidence of him from me even after he's gone? His form floats above me and I only feel helpless as I watched him for as long as I could before reality came crashing down on me. Before I'd have to pick myself up from the ground, no doubt leaving pieces of myself in this very spot, only to trudge into a village that felt as though I had once lived in, but only in a past life. Because my grey life had been replaced with colors when Draco came into it and I don't know how I would ever cope with going back to the grey.
"I don't want you to think differently of me Hermione but the reason why I can walk up those stairs is because, I like boys. As in I would like to have a boyfriend later not a girlfriend." I say quietly.
"You know what generally happens but not the details. And without the details you’re afraid you could change something drastically."
"I wish there was something to help you sleep more Draco, your looking a bit pale. You are eating enough right? I know that the loud noise in the great hall puts you on edge really bad."
I only said "hello." Out loud and then continued to speak through my Link with Harry to answer her questions. She just said to continue meditation and try to use the amulet less to continue to see progress and practically dismissed us as quickly as possible.
The only problem was when I had care for magical creatures, and divination, while Draco had ancient runes and Arithmancy. I brought this up to Professor McGonagall and she decided we would trade off days in which classes we were supposed to attend. So for today I tagged along to his classes to explain the situation. I was extremely lost in everything his class was about.
"Oh my god Draco, he comes back? Fuck. Okay I'll do anything I can to help, how long do we have? Your 18 so what 7 years?"
Wait.......WHAT?! Oh god no I have to fix this I can't change the time line too much or I won't know what happens in the future! "W-wait professor I can't play, really I um I would love to believe me, more than anything but I can't. I have err" think Draco think! What problem do  you have that could stop you from playing? Wait I know! -"I have anemia! Yup and its not recommended I play sports and besides I'm sure Katie bell is a great chaser, and you only have a seeker position open, and I would hate to take away a players passion."
His parents were all silver hair and eyes, with pale skin making me wonder even more just how Draco looked normally. Would he have his fathers stern mouth and chiseled jawline? Or his mothers elegant cheekbones, and soft sloping aristocratic nose? Would his eyes be sharper like his fathers or the soft roundness his mother adorned? I was burning up with curiosity and determination to get him and everyone here to normal, but I never refused Draco the happiness of another outing or surprise. Even though I wanted to spend all my time reading and looking, I always let myself get swept up in another one of Draco's adventures, because he was always so much happier when I agreed to his suggestion.
"Hey don't listen to them Hermione I for one find your hair to be adorably youthful. If the reason your crying is because you don't like it, I can help you with that. But if you don't mind it and you're only upset because they said it then there's is no reason to be upset. They are only saying mean things because they're jealous. Trust me you have such a cute face and you're intelligent. You my fair lady are just too much competition for them."
“Who even fights with swords?” Pansy complained, her sword having just been knocked out of her hands by Alicia.
“Do we dare head to Safeway? I mean surely they would anticipate people going to a grocery store,” Draco said.
Draco sighed. Despite everything he still loved Harry Potter. He loved Astoria too. The two things were not incompatible.
“That’s understandable. Besides we’re only twenty-two. I don’t think anyone expects us to have everything figured out.”
Draco didn’t speak. He knew that voice. Or was he only hearing what he wanted to hear? The figure arrived in the kitchen and moonlight illuminated his face.
The three of them slowly walked across the town. All the fires were long since out. There were no sounds aside from barking dogs. The cemetery was up on a hill, once you passed through the main gate. Draco and Pansy silently followed Harry to the mausoleum where Bellatrix had been bound.
you were cool. I mean… Erm. Never mind. Forget I said that,” Draco said, his heart pounding and his palms feeling sweaty.
In the morning, there are no further messages from Draco. Nor is there anything all day. As Harry is getting ready that evening he starts to wonder if the whole thing was a joke. But Draco pulls up in his black BMW right on time at 7. He has a self-satisfied smile on his face when Harry gets in the car. Harry wonders if this car was something Draco got before the rift with his parents. He feels out of place. It’s a nicer car than Harry’s used to.
Draco moves it to Harry’s shaft, sliding it the toy up and down Harry’s length, getting close to the head but not quite touching.
“Miss? Miss?” the woman called out and Pansy left the bathroom, arriving back downstairs in a flash, making the woman scream.
“So, instead we just wait for her to wake up tomorrow night?” Pansy asked as Angelina set Daphne down on a mattress that had been laid in the living room.
“I was fucking with you. Not that it matters. I dated two different girls in school and college and now I’ve been kissing you.”
“But… your name is Pansy. How many people do you know named Pansy? You are the first person I have ever met with that name,” the first tall woman said.
Draco was unnerved by the silence as he did his business behind a bush. It really was like the world had died. Surely, he and Harry couldn’t be the only survivors in town.
He says, “How does Sunday sound to you? That’ll give us a couple of rest days. Also, I should be off work.”
Draco continues, “What I mean is that I haven’t had much success before you. I matched with some people but they were all boring. Everyone here is into fitness and hiking. And obviously I stay fit but it’s not a hobby. I’m not going to meet up with someone to lift weights.”
Traveling up to Lake City didn’t take long. Draco had considered getting a car but public transportation seemed rampant and he was worried at some point red flags would pop up. What if he was forced to prove he existed? He feared what would happen.
“They might return. Maybe we should try to rest just in case of an attack. We can be more ready than we were last night,” Harry said.
Pansy lingered in her room for a minute before heading back out. Outside, Alicia was reading on the couch.
“That I’m bi? Yeah. I can tell her anything. She’s bi too. She has a girlfriend. Maybe two girlfriends, actually. She’s OK with me seeing other people but there’s only been one other person I’ve been interested in.”
“I have a Bachelor’s in business. My whole life all my mother and father have wanted for me was to eventually take over the family business. I don’t want that.”
“Yeah. I know. I was new. You don’t understand what bloodlust is like, Draco. You can’t ignore it. I mean… you can learn but my maker wasn’t exactly so inclined. Asshole. Anyhow, I was starting to learn to ignore it… then
He stared at the name, typing it into his phone without removing his eyes. He hit enter and looked at his phone. The search gave him nothing. Nothing at all.
At noon they stop again, now in the woods well away from the river. Draco is still holding up fairly well. The sweaty, flushed look works for him. They have jerky this time.
Harry doesn’t know what the fuck that was about but his body certainly likes it. Draco pulls away and says, “Before I let you go… would you let me bite your neck?”
Harry nods and Draco gets back to sucking. Harry removes his mental blocks, focusing all his energy into unloading into Draco’s mouth. He looks so beautiful.
Cho and Ginny both drink. Ginny tilts the glass all the way back, wipes her mouth, then slams the glass on the table.
At the front desk, they discover that there are two rooms available. One with a bed for two adults and another for a child and another with just a bed for two adults.
“Yes and no. So much more was wrong with us than that. So much. I mean there was hardly anything that was right. Pansy wasn’t keen on the rough stuff. Any of it. And she, uh… Jesus, this is embarrassing,” Draco says, looking like he wanted to flee rather than finish what he was saying.
“Blood is everything. The Dark Lord understands that. And soon all will understand. I just need your boyfriend to tell me how to get out of here,” Bellatrix said.
“Hey,” a voice says after he’s been standing outside for a couple of minutes, looking up at the stars.
“Yeah, but what kinda criminal. See, there’s a big difference between some stoner gettin’ busted for possession and like a child killer,” Pansy plead.
“Everyone’s built differently. I guess. It doesn’t matter. There was nothing wrong with her. We just weren’t compatible,” Draco says.
“Is that how you want to characterize that? All right,” Harry says and drinks his last drink as well.
Draco gets off the bed, going to his nightstand and pulling something out. Harry recognizes the buzzing sound it makes.
“You know more than you’re telling me. You have contacts. Something big is about to happen,” Astoria said, his kiss not being sufficient for soothing her.
“Like I said… there’s stuff you don’t know about me,” Harry said, and Draco realized at some point he would have to tell Harry that he knows more than he thinks.
“I am not. I’ve seen things. Here and there. Mostly at school or with friends with parents less strict than mine. Like I said, you and I had very different upbringings.”
“I don’t think that’s for me. I don’t see how you can find any sort of meaningful relationship on a dating app.”
Pop after pop and Harry holds on. Draco says, “All right. Let’s upgrade to something a little stronger.”
He steps into the center of the living room and slowly lifts up his tee-shirt. Draco is leaning back on the sofa, slumped, his big dick in his hand, slowly stroking it. Harry wishes he could just climb onto his lap and impale himself but he doesn’t think that’s such a good idea.
At least I don’t think so. I don’t know what happened to him. I hope I see him again someday, though. He’s kind of a snob but really great in the sack,” Pansy said then quietly left the room.
When Draco gets back on the bed Harry can’t tell what he has. Then the sensation of what Harry believes is leather hits his upper back on the right side. Harry blows out air, taken aback by the sharpness.
“Makes sense. But the magic on her was strong. Even if you could break it… there’s a trap on it. I’m not sure what it does but… it would be really bad to try and break it,” Harry said.
In the morning, Harry is greeted by the smell of eggs and bacon. After a visit to the bathroom, he wanders out into the rest of the apartment, finding the kitchen by scent alone, his boyfriend standing at the stove in his robe.
Ginny drops to the ground, sitting on the concrete sidewalk outside the apartment. Draco looks down. She looks impossibly tiny.
Finally, a profile that catches Harry’s eye. For several reasons. He’s well dressed. Preppy. Blond. Tall and slender as he sits backward in a wooden chair. He’s not looking at the camera. He’s positioned in front of a window at an angle so that the light causes lens flare. The face and cheekbones are unmistakable and the name on the profile confirms it. Draco. Draco Malfoy, a man Harry hasn’t seen in years and for good reason. They hate each other.
“Sorry. I mean… no. I’m not. He seemed like a piece of shit. But I’m sorry if you’re sad about it,” Pansy said.
“I guess I should’ve told you to pack some clothes just in case,” Draco says as they enter the room.
“Your cuts have healed. We both might want a shower. No telling when we’ll get another chance,” Harry said and stepped out of bed.
Hours later Draco replies with a day and time and the address for the West Seattle restaurant. The dick doesn’t even ask if 7 on Friday is all right. He just assumes. Luckily the time is just fine. Harry gets off early on Fridays.
“Social media is where you can say something objectively stupid and horrible and have thousands of people tell you how great and smart you are anyway.”
“I’ve gorged myself,” Draco says, head against a pillow as he lies on the bed praying for digestion.
They are both quiet for a minute. Harry breaks the silence, saying, “I can’t believe I called you daddy.”
She wasn’t really sure what she wanted to do now. She was tired. She had slept a little while Darlene was gone but it wasn’t enough. She wasn’t hungry yet. She figured she must belong somewhere but she couldn’t be sure where.
“What’s going on is that we’re going to play some board games. And Harry is going to pass me that,” Hermione says, coming over, taking the joint and puffing with confidence.
Draco sighed, shoveling all the papers back into his bag. He picked up his drink and went up to the counter to speak to a barista.
The one person in the room who hasn’t acknowledged Draco is Neville Longbottom. Draco supposes out of everyone he might’ve been the biggest shithead to Neville. But he’s also playing games so maybe he’s just distracted. Draco decides not to push it.
“We found this,” the third woman said, holding up Pansy’s vest that she had stupidly left at Darlene’s.
Astoria pushed his hands out of the way, reaching between her legs to touch herself. Draco always let her finish a couple of times before he did. Not that he could stop her if he tried. After he finally finished they cuddled for a bit before having dinner. They watched a movie after that but halfway through they started fooling around, Draco bending her over the ottoman. Then again in the bathtub.
Harry shifted, sliding his body next to Draco’s, Draco wrapping an arm around him. Kissing Harry is intoxicating, addictive. They both taste like pizza but Draco could give a fuck about that. He only wants this beautiful man close to him, his lips giving him life.
Harry and Draco come over and sit down on what sofa space is left. Ginny and Cho are both kneeling at the table while Neville, Ron, and Hermione are on the sofa.
Ron hangs his head and lets out a long sigh then finishes his glass. Cho returns from the bathroom and Ron gets up to take her place in silence. Once Ron is in the bathroom Hermione whispers, “And that’s why we didn’t work out.”
Professor just lead us to the Gryffindor quidditch captain, "I think I just found you a knew seeker and a chaser, they have exceptional skill, I never would have believed it but it happened right in front of me."
I finally had someone who understood the pain of loosing their parents and constantly wondering if you had made them proud or would have. There had been a few times I let myself cry and each time Draco was there to curl up around me and be the strength I never had. I had been there to wrap my arms around Draco's neck when he broke down from the heavy guilt he carried around on his shoulders. He really never forgave himself for bringing this curse to those he cared about, even though it wasn't his fault at all. Slowly but surely I had gotten through to him and he looked so much happier without all of that burden hanging over him.
Later I see Harry perched on his broom and smile as the nostalgia hits me. He looks into the crowd and smiles at us briefly before going back to looking for the snitch. It's then that his broom starts shaking and I zero in on Quirrell. I smirk as I see his lips moving in a chanting murmur.
"An animagus, is someone who can transform into an animal. But it's really difficult and very few manage it, though James and I managed it. Along with that traitor."
I just continue to theorize with Harry on what will happen in our next class and I get that feeling of something important is going to happen. I already have the gut feeling that today is going to be the Buckbeak incident and already I'm trying to form a plan to avoid Blaise getting injured. Since he's the one taking my theoretical spot in this timeline it has to be either him or another one of the Slytherins. I come up with a plan of casting a moving spell and a shield, or just tackling him to the ground if I need to act quickly.
I couldn't help but love having someone to talk to about all of my theories and telling him my findings after testing the experiments. For example my research in looking for a cure for lycanthropy, or how to help vampires walk in the sun. Or How to find a cure for those who had gone insane by torture.
At my sigh he gave me a concerned look and asked if I was feeling alright making me smile in confirmation. He returned it and went back to listening in on a story of a prank Ron, Fred, and George pulled on Ginny last year. I just daydreamed about kissing Draco after giving him his present for a while until I felt a sharp feeling of shock. I quickly turned my head to Draco and if I didnt know any better I would think he was determined to not look at me so I did the only thing I could. I spoke to him through our connection.
Draco painfully reminds me of him. Both death eaters having to withstand horrors I can only imagine happening right in front of their eyes, happening to them, when they should have been laughing with friends. Both from pure blood supremacy blood lines. Both doing things against their will. It's like a vicious cycle that repeated. Draco had been doomed to the same fate, until he did the impossible and decided to rewrite his story. To taste redemption. And that is something I can get behind. I couldn't save Reg but I will save Draco, even if its from himself.
"When your parents died it was believed that Sirius betrayed your parents location to the death eaters and that was how you almost died. But that isn't true. Black is innocent, he would never betray your parents like that.”
I say out loud and turn around to see something huge slink past the door. I feel my heart jump at the knowledge that whatever just passed by was not a person but an animal. I tip toed softly to the door thinking back to the voice that spoke to me before. It was rough and rumbling despite it being said softly, and no matter how scraggly it sounded at first I could tell there was something delicate underneath. Something soft and smooth trying to fight off the thundering scratchiness.
"Iv'e been trying to think who could have- oh my god! I'm such an idiot! I know exactly who it was!"
I accepted it and decided to use it as another thing to use for my cover of “being a Malfoy”. No one cared to look deeper or find out why, they just made judgements without proof. And though it made me feel alone and hated, its all I knew.
"I-I know I'll try." But my nerves were too on edge so I grabbed the pendent and Harry sent me waves of calm. I expected him to stop but he didn't and it continued until lunch was over, meaning I was able to eat a sandwich with pumpkin juice. I honestly should talk to Sev about my anxiety, maybe he has something that will help with it. But I turn to Harry and gave him a hug as a thank you and we all left to ride brooms. The whole way there I was thinking of ways to get Harry on the quidditch team, maybe a race and I'll transfigure my tie into a ball. So when the time came for Neville to fall and no one did or said anything I went ahead and challenged Harry to a race.
I try to imagine myself back in a game again but it's cut off too soon by an incredible chill. I immediately get up and pull out my wand even though I know it will be of no use to me right now, and quickly make my way down the stands. I almost trip a few times but I don't have the mind to slow down because I'd know this type of cold anywhere. The dementors are still on the prowl and I'm about to get caught up with one. I can only run like my life is on the line. I'm so close to the school now and I can see students walking about a ways away so I just keep pushing despite the lightheadedness taking over. I make eye contact with Blaise and from his face I can tell that the dementor is still on my trail which is not good. I know from the black taking over my vision I'm going to pass out and I manage to take just a few more steps before I'm going down.
"Oh yes that would be wonderful then we could both have beautiful hair together! Please! Is their a way to grow it faster?"
He's laughing and cheering the whole time he gets spun, though when I set him down he automatically agrees.
I grin and nod. "Yes please I could do with some company. It's pretty lonely when I bake and I'll get to teach you everything! Oh this is going to be great!"
”They were his best friends and his only family after his real family burned his picture off of the family tree. You see My mother is a black, which means Sirius is my cousin of sorts, more like an uncle in my eyes but you get the point. You two aren't blood related but your mum and dad wanted him to be your godfather.”
"Guys Harry and I have news to tell you and it's a lot. We both figured something out over the summer not even two weeks ago."
His breath uneven from excitement and reeking as it gets huffed into my face. My back on the cold ground pinned by the werewolf who is opening his jaws.
D: [it's just the way it is Harry. Iv'e lived with it for the past what? nine years? I can handle the ones to come. Besides I have Sev to help me this time around.]
A pair of black slacks, a pretty turquoise long sleeve button up, a thin dark slate grey knitted vest, and a black over coat. My leather Oxfords paired with light blue socks and to top it all off a silver pocket watch. I nod and then shrink my trunk into my pocket before leaving. I waste no time in going back down to the kitchen to grab the muffins and pot pies I made early this morning for the guys. Warming charm and shrunken they go into the leather satchel, after warning the snake that he might get sick if he tries to eat it and I would give him double of his favorite food if he waited a few more minutes to eat. He agreed happily and I grinned. I go out to the living room and left to get to the station by myself now. It was tradition to be taken for first year but after that they didn't care.
I motion with my head to him and Draco smiled walking steadily to the dog making me hurry after him. Once we got there the dog seemed extremely suspicious but wagged his tail when I came close. Draco unwrapped the breadsticks and offered one to the black dog. Immediately it began to eat and at the reaction Draco gave the dog all five in the bag, while petting him despite the fur being matted and dirty. I smiled warmly at the scene and joined him.
"desperate times called for desperate measures. I needed things to be kept a secret if I helped prisoners in the cells. They needed healing and food, I couldn't just leave them there alone. I learned how to do this out of desperation, my magic understood and helped me. When I do wandless and wordless magic I'm not actually thinking or saying a spell, I just will my magic to do something and it does it. The only thing I can think to name it is core magic."
So here we were opening the door to the three headed dog that was the cause of Draco's injuries so long ago. Draco nods to Hermione who begins to sing a lullaby her own mum sang to her and the animal gradually dozed off into a deep sleep long enough for us to open the trap door.
I wake up groggy and much too soon only to find the beautiful white snake slithered into a pile on my chest, and it brings a smile to my lips before closing my eyes again and softly slipping into a deep sleep in the dark room.
Merlin! I feel my heart beating quickly in my chest and the drip of a small bead of sweat slide down my slightly toned chest. I swallow softly and begin taking in everything about this room, knowing that this is the place. I take a slow step forward after not seeing anything and wince at the creaking sound that made my blood pump loudly in my ears. I sweep my eyes on the floor boards looking for any loose ones that could be hiding the artifact, after checking the wall for any out of place seam lines. It's when I see at the foot of the cerberus that there is a trap door!
Raising it up in the air almost daintily as he grins, his eyes looking it over. It's metal decorated in reds and gold, with a full bowl of food and a comfy place to sleep in. It looks almost luxurious, in the sense that the metal is charmed to look like a rose carved top with vines and thorns, and a solid rectangle bottom. It looked like something of the likes of an over the top bird cage in a fairy tale book.
I'm lead by Pansy through the mansion and up a stone spiral tower to a bedroom, and find it utterly beautiful. Precious gold is adorning the room as if it were as easily attainable as wall paper. Carved vines and flowers made of gold hung from the ceiling making it look like a priceless forest from a fairytale when taking into account the hand painted forest themed walls. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen and I think Pansy could tell, as she startled me with her laughter. I crack a grin at her clear amusement until she's pulling out even more extravagant clothing items. I'm staring at shimmering silk and satin dress shirts, vests, overcoats, and pressed pants of every style that were each no doubt more expansive than my own home. I shuffle self consciously but Pansy just tuts at me and guides me into the connected marble and gold bathroom. She sets up a bath that smells amazing. All while ordering me to get in before she leaves, calling out that she will leave my dinner clothes on the bed. And that she will and come to get me for dinner to eat with Draco, after running a few errands. I thank her loudly from the bathroom and sigh out in pleasure at the warm water containing essential oils and roses. I let myself soak in the luxurious bath already getting nervous to meet Draco.
Soon I feel them warm up to me as I busy myself with the scones and they are surprised I'm doing it all by hand, so they give me some pointers and tricks to make the process easier. Once my scones are in the oven and the muffins are cooling I wash the equipment and offer to help them with breakfast. They tried their hardest to refuse but I pleaded with them and that's how I ended up becoming fast friends with daisy. We both shared a passion for baking and we bonded over making pancakes, flour in my hair and on her apron, pancake batter on my cheek and on her fingers. We laughed and joked about anything and everything, but I had to get ready for classes and breakfast so I helped finish the pancakes and told her she would see me very soon. So with muffins and scones packed and shrunken into my pocket I make my way to the dorms to clean up and wake the others.
"I know that you and I weren't friends before, in your past. So that means that when this happened last time you were not the one that was being possessed by the horcrux."
