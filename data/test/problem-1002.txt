‘ Wandering around at midnight, ickle firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty’.
I will try to be more active but I can't promise although my country will start school on 20th of January so I have a lot of free time.
‘Give it here!’ Potter yelled while extending his hand to Draco hoping he would give it back.
“How about girls in boy’s dormitories?” Draco questioned her while grinning at his intellectual question.
“When I call your name, you will be put on the hat  and sit on the stool to be sorted”, she said. ‘Abbott, Hannah!’
“So - you go to my parents house not just to ask for her homemade food but for her blessing too.” smirking Draco when he exposed his true intention why he visited his Mother.
He can see that Weasley was in great pain with the injury and safe to say, he was having a good laugh out of it.
A knock on the door interrupting him dressing Jamie up, he looked up and his eyes straight up meeting his husband emerald green eyes.
“Imagine- you swell with my child, your tummy all round and big for me. Fuck- I can’t- I want that- your boobs all big full with milk-”
“I love you,” said Draco once his mouth touches Jamie’s forehead. “I love you so much.”
Draco had to burst out loud, he can’t contained it anymore, “Weasley! What happened to you? You? A Hufflepuff? Don’t make me laugh!”, shouted Draco. Most of the Slytherins joined in laughing at Weasley.
He heard Severus took a deep breath as his hand kept on running his back, up and down. Finally, after a few second of waiting for the word to come out of his mouth, he spoke.
To make his husband happy, Harry just nodded his head and agreed to whatever Draco said, although he for sure knew he cannot live without his cock.
As the movie progress, Draco’s mind was somewhere, he was looking back on the year that he and Harry got together. Sometimes, he still wondered why out of a sudden, Harry were trying to get his attention back.
Weasley hung his head low from embarrassment as Potter steered him to their table with Granger beside him. He knows Weasley would beat the shite out of him if they weren’t surrounded with lots of students and professors.
“You are so brave, dragon. So fucking brave and you give me three sons, dragon - three! I love you so fucking much,” giving him a long kiss on his mouth as he whispers those words as their mouths connected.
Pansy looked at him with wide eyes, word couldn’t form in her mouth, she was stuttering with her words, and when the word could finally come out of her, she only say two words to him, “Shut it!”
It’s hard when someone is as pale as he is trying very hard to hide down his blush that was spreading through his cheeks.
Cory was the first one to fall asleep on his chest when he peaked one eye open, he disentangled him and put him down beside him on the bed, with a thick baby blanket knitted by Mrs Weasley once they arrived into the world. It was soft and warm, they loved it very much just by how quick they got comfortable by it.
“The problem is, my last name is Black.”, mumbled Draco again under his breath because if father heard what he said, he will surely get whip by father’s cane on his hand.
“Then continue whatever you’re doing and don’t punish yourself anymore. Although I don’t want to be known as one of your master, I gave you my blessing to warn the Great Harry Potter”, said Draco with a hint of sarcasm at the end.
“Fuck.” he thought, the universe must repaying the debt when they took away his parents when he was one year old and all the bad luck he has experienced.
When they knocked and opened the door on the last compartment hoping that this last compartment wasn't full of people, his hope came true cause there were only two people in the compartment.
Draco muttered quietly, “Why should I?” stood up and left to his room without finishing his breakfast.
Time like this makes him wish he could own a smart animal such as Kneazles or even better a snake probably. The day after he visited the Diagon Alley, he forgot to coax Mother to buy him a pet because Father's childish behaviour makes him forget. He decided to ask her the next day and he failed again for the second time in a row when she said no without waiting for him to ask the question.
Once he was done, he gave the phone back, stepped back a few steps to watch him go after scanning his keycard for the lift to work and a simple hesitation kiss on the older man’s cheek, he has to stand by the tip of his toes to give him the kiss and it was worth it because he felt his lips tingling afterwards.
So, he decided to investigate more about the room but he had to sneak out at night.
“He is hundred and one percent got his jealousy from you”, teased Draco because his husband was super possessive of him that he won’t let stranger near him even an inch.
Harry was driving around the parking lot to find the empty lot, when he finally find one, he reversing his car into the lot and pulled the handbrake up when he has perfected his parking. He turned the engine off, get out of the car and opened the door on Jamie’s side.
Yes, he has finally hit the target that he wants.
Jamie screamed as he was being squeezed in between them, with his tiny hands, he pushed his father away from his mama. He lightly punched his father’s hard muscular chest repeatedly as he pouted, tears leaking out of his eyes.
What tempered his mood is the new DADA professor is the stupid Gilderoy Lockhart, he should have known, he has predicted it but sometimes he wish his intuition was wrong.
“How many bloody spells do you know?” Blaise sat closer to him and whispered in his ear.
Without him realizing, a fat tears rolling down his cheeks as the waves of new emotion hit him. He had to sit down because it was too much for him to take in.
“AHH”, she screamed her lungs out, she almost fell backwards but Draco’s hand quickly snatched her up, “What’s going on back there!”, seethed father as he walked towards them, Draco had no idea where to put the stupid fucking skull out of his hand.
“Yes and you do know that this is Mother’s restaurant, right?” eyes locked with Black, wishing that they could just order up already. Thanks to the background music, it helps him soothe his nerves.
He didn’t know how in the bloody hell he knows about his Comet Two Sixty, but he did bragged about it to the first year.
`Iread a lot, you cretin” he replied while laughing and continued to listen to Severus’s lessons.
Harry was taking his paternity leave for a month to help his husband. Harry informed Draco that he might extend his leave for another month and Draco was fucking grateful for that.
He decided to change his mind once he reached their nursery, he’s going to lay on his bed while feeding them his breast milk. It was difficult to move with two babies in his arms, rocking them in his arms each.
Harry nodded his head and pushed the trolley towards the fruits and vegetables aisle, Draco quickly went over and took a bunch of bananas, Jamie saw his hand reaching for the bananas and scrunched his nose in disgust, “Hate bananas,” whispered Jamie softly in disgust to his father.
Sirius looks at his son's big heterochromia eyes. Two different colours that connect him to his parents. He was grateful for it although it was a rare disease.
“But we have a fucking deal, don’t tell Hagrid on anyone.”, stated Weasley, bargaining the book for the big oaf’s job.
It took them an hour and a half to sort through their wands, Draco bought a wand made out of hawthorn wood and has unicorn hair core, 10 inches while Cassie’s wand were made out of ash wood and has phoenix feather core, 12 inches, they were fascinated by their wand.
Right now, they were sitting at the Gryffindor’s table since the bitch started hooking up with Granger. Never in a billions years he would have thought that they are going to date or that Granger is a lesbian, less likely liking Pansy but the inter-house relationship between Slytherin and Gryffindor have been better since they started dating.
“Thank you for giving me a family that I always wanted since I was a kid, I never thought that I could have all of this,” while he was caressing his arm, Draco had teary eyes whenever Harry showed his vulnerability.
“Nothing, love,” said Harry cheekily and the same time, his son was hiding his laugh by clamping his small hand on his mouth. He shakes his head at their behaviour and went back looking for the freshest bananas.
Dobby popped inside his room to tell him that Mother was waiting for him at the dining hall.
“Okay okay, you will have my full attention for now on and your father have to wait until night for his turn”, assured Draco to his son while his husband was laughing at his son’s behaviour. Jamie seems to like the idea and opened his mouth, continued waiting to be fed.
‘I know about your sneaking out’, answered Severus. Draco was looking at Severus with wide eyes as Severus quirked his eyebrow at him as if he could keep it a secret.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco can’t take it anymore with Potter teasing him, he begged him to fuck him already. Potter too decided he was done with the teasing, he release Draco’s dick. He took back the abandoned lube and poured some more in his hand to prepare Draco.
“Fuck- I want you now. Fuck me right here. Let’s the stars and the constellations be the witness of our love.” He demanded and Draco moved his body to sit on top of Harry,
The image of Harry driving with one hand while his other hand is holding Draco’s, he looks really fuckable right now and he just wanted to crawl into the olive skinned man’s lap and beg him to take him right there and then, bouncing on his huge wide cock with his pregnant belly on display but they can’t because first of all, Harry was driving right now so he don’t want any accident to happen and secondly, he have to remind himself that Jamie was behind them and he don’t want to craft those sinful memory into his son’s young mind.
He forgot about his phone so with a snap of his fingers, the phone stopped recording and laying it back to his bedside table.
Draco’s life goes by after the day he was born. Live with his parents in 12 Grimmauld Place, visited by four of his father’s friends and sometimes with his uncle Lucius and his Aunt Cissy. They bring their baby girl for a playdate and so Draco and his cousin, Cassiopeia are close. He was the brightest child. At the age of one, he has developed his first accidental magic by levitating his favourite toy towards him. Sirius put it away when Draco refused to eat the nasty baby food that even Sirius has to cover his nose because the smell is too awful.
He don’t know how long he kept on talking until he felt a tap on his shoulders, it took everything in him to look up, his face was drain with tears, he hates feeling like this. She’s been gone for eleven years, Draco should have moved on from his life but he can’t.
Their teacher, Madam Hooch arrived not long after the Gryffindors. She had short, grey hair and yellow eyes like a hawk.
Blaise was leaning against the wall with his arms crossed, talking to the girls when he felt a strong hard push on his back that made him fall to the ground. When he fell, his head was disorientated but he heard shouts nearby. He looked up and saw Blaise marched over to them with fury in his eyes.
He walked in confidently with his broad shoulders, trimmed stubble beard, poking fun at his siblings. They were all wearing a ‘casual elegant’ dress code. The daughter, he forgot her name, is wearing off the shoulder, above the knees black dress while Lily Potter is wearing a red sheath dress. The dress suits her hourglass figure with a straight cut and is nipped at the waistline, with no visible seam, all following Anne, leading them to the tables that were already reserved for them for the night.
The door swung open. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald green robes stood there.
When Draco looked around, he saw he was one of the few that succeed, he smirked at his success. Potter’s broom jumped into his hand at once and he had the expression of shock, probably because it was his first try, Weasley’s broom hit him on the head, well deserved. He snorted at Weasley’s failure.
“The tension in the air is too much”, murmured Draco under his breath as they were sitting down, side by side, waiting for father to say whatever he displease of them from his mind.
Severus with arms crossed turned his head towards the three of them and addressed, “And you three, why are you three were late?”, Blaise was trembling beside him while Theo kept on tapping his foot because they were both scared at Severus’s cold demeanour. Draco felt pity for them and decided to explain and when he was done, Severus didn't even take any point from them. He took out his Potion book and enlarged it.
“Do not disrespect me! When I told you what to do, you did what I ask for.” The atmosphere in the room was tense, nobody speak any word, even they have to breathe quietly so they do not disturb the quiet surrounding.
“Mama is leabing Jamie because he bad boy,” explained Jamie as he tried to talk through his hiccup.
“Thanks,” thanked Larissa as she murmured those words into their connected lips when his mouth finally reached hers.
Mother looks down at both of them, rolled her eyes while hiding her amusement by coughing, “I don’t know, maybe if you both kiss your father’s cheeks then I will decide who is my favourite.”
Professor McGonagall pulled the oak door wide open, the Entrance Hall was so big that there were 4 long tables for the students of the houses and 1 long table for the professors.
“Master and Mistress are waiting for Miss Celestial in the study room,” bowed the elf who greets them on the front door of the manor, bowing as low as he can get. Celestial swallowed nervously while nodding her head in acknowledgement, Stocky then apparates away to continue his work.
He was still fuming because it was not his fault that Father was allergic to fur but although he has fur allergy, why did he keep peacocks as a pet then? It was not fair on his behalf. He should own a pet too.
Talking about Harry, he was looking at him intensely and impatient shown on his face, clearly wanted to have Draco all to himself while he was wearing the mini skirt.
He was glaring at Cassie helping Longbottom, seriously that boy was pathetic, really pathetic. When she was done helping him, Longbottom walked out of the stand to go back inside the castle leaving only Cassie and him. Granger and Weasley was nowhere to be seen now, same goes to Crabbe and Goyle, maybe Cassie had chased them away.
Suddenly, Harry took a hold on him and flipped both of them over, his back against the ground, while Harry’s body was swaying on top of him. His hand took a hold of Harry’s messy hair.
Opening his eyes when his son gave him a happy ‘yip’, a green sign meaning he managed to change. He trudged away from their woodhouse followed by Regulus closely behind.
Harry tried to give Jamie to him but he was resisting by grabbing Harry’s shirt firmly with his chubby hands.
“Dobby is the one punish himself, Draco”, answered Dobby as his hand was beginning to shake.
“Wow,” she let out a breath. Draco feels like she is an idiot like who in their bright mind would be fascinated by a scar that was given by a madman when he killed his parents but Draco just kept quiet. Draco was quiet all through the train ride because he’s not used to friendly conversation, it was always Cassie who loves to start a friendly conversation.
As he drank the potion, he body felt better and his head felt lighter than before. His eyes aren’t puffy and blurry anymore. He handed the empty vial back to Severus.
“And how may I asked you going to expose me to her, you are not even close”, asked Draco.
When the Weasley’s twins walked in, they stood in the middle of the hall and shouts, “Whoever did this, it was brilliant! But if we know whoever did this, we might start a prank wars with the other houses. So to the anonymous prankster, Congratulation, you played the lions but watch out to other houses since we don’t know who did this and how to cancel the spell.”
And he has to find and learn a spell that could make himself invisible quickly.
Although Draco kept his silence, he still could hear the conversation between Firenze and Potter flowing over him.
“We are going to wizarding grocery shop, right?” asked Draco looked out of the window, looking up at the cloud on the sky, “With that huge belly of yours, Muggle might get confused”, said Harry, eyes never stray away from the road.
Draco was waiting for Harry to get the drinks when Goldstein sat besides him.
Draco stood up from the couch and headed out of the common room to the Great Hall since he was hungry and it’s dinner time. He looks at Blaise with a silent question hanging around them and Blaise too stood up and followed him to the Great Hall.
Draco’s eyes scan through the dark forest they just got out from, the rustling of the tree giving him goosebumps, the unfamiliar scent giving him the feeling of threat. Regulus was barking behind him, trying to help Draco to fence off the stranger.
‘Oh, yeah?’ said him while sneering at Potter. ‘You know what Potter? I’m going to be honest with you, you are such a prejudice prick, just because someone are in Slytherin that doesn’t mean that they will become a dark wizard but once you heard from the weasel mouth that You-Know-Who was in Slytherin, you made out your mind about Slytherin and I fucking tired of both of you guy’s shite’, he said viciously while grasping The Remembrall.
“Well, you are and we are just pointing it out.”
‘ Uhm.. ye-yes it was tru- true that I fai - fain-fainted but I am we- well now’, said Quirrell stuttering word by word but Draco knows he was hiding because of his eyes. The eyes was not looking at his when he answered him, he was looking elsewhere.
As he close his eyes and resting his body beside Dobby, Draco asked Dobby one question he’d never did before because he was afraid of the answer but not anymore.
He raised the helmet to his head and wore it, fastened the strap and secured it until he was comfortable and felt safe.
He gave a tiny cry as he sucked on his nipple, both Draco and Harry were looking down on their son in their arms, Draco bent his head and gave tiny kisses on the baby’s head.
“You always caught my eyes, Draco. From the first day but I’ve never given a second thought about why sometimes I want to run my hand through your hair, bury my face in your arse”, said Harry unashamedly. Draco had to look down because he was flustered with Harry’s words.
“it’s a privilege fucking you, you know that baby, I’m going to fuck you until you grow up. I’m going fuck you until I get to put a ring on you. I’m going to fuck you until one day your belly are swell with my children, I will never stop fucking you because You. Are. Mine”
‘Of course Potter, from the sweat that we produce, we can already tell,” said Draco as he rolled his eyes while shaking his head,
Life goes on, The Marauders helped him taking care of Draco although he tries to reject it many times because he doesn't want to burden his friends even more, especially Lily and James. They have so much going on with You-Know-Who and hiding from the dark side. Peter has been distant lately and never once they saw a smile on his face these days.
“Shut up, Draco. This is adult business, go to your sister,” ordered father as he breathe out a relieved sighs, finally he could go to his sister. The grip on his shoulder loosen and he walked out of the situation, away from them because Mr Weasley and father could never see eye to eye.
Pansy pressed the button again and timer went on, she did a ‘basic frat boy’ movement when trying to be flirty and when the girl’s voice came up, Draco walked into the frame, confident that before but still awkward. When they were done. Pansy looked through the video again and was not impressed.
Draco moaned softly as he answered Harry’s question, “They were quite active today, I can feel their kicking.”, hands coming to hold onto Harry’s left hand while his right hand are doing the work.
The sorting hat was half way with the song when Draco appreciated the little effort the hat put into creating a song that is so out of tune, should have taken a singing lesson, he thought.
When Draco’s lips on his, the flames in him ignite, the burst of love he had for Draco kept on expanding as the year went by and he knows it was never going to die between them.
Without him realizing, he fell asleep alongside with Jamie, mouth latching to his firm nipple.
“Thank you Mrs Weasley.”
A week later, an owl he didn't recognised dropped a parcel on his food, he cursed the owl profoundly. The parcel contained a muggle camera that could record a moving motion, longer than a moving photograph.
“Cheer up little brother, this is your day”, came Cassie from beside him, he was too focused on the guests that he didn't realize Cassie sneaked up on him and that made him jump a little for the place that he stood.
Draco rolls his eyes and says, “Stop saying little brother, it’s embarrassing, how would you feel if I introduced you to someone and said, “Hello I'm Draco and this is my big bad protective sister over here, wanna be friends cause I surely doesn't want to friend with her but we don’t get choose who our sibling is.”
“Uhm let me think- ” as his eyes were closed, his hand went to his chin, rubbing it as he cocked his head to the side.
Draco crawled into the bed and drew the curtain around him, putting Silencio so no one’s going to know what he's going to do. He called for Dobby quietly but harshly for the second time when the elf doesn’t appear.
“Why the fuck you did not wake me up?” gritted his teeth slightly, looking at his husband dead in the eyes. “You are always tired, dragon. I want to give you a little rest,” he explained while patting the empty space next to him.
“NO! JAMIE WANT DAGON FUD,”, shouted Jamie from his seat, face red with anger, Draco sighs- sometimes his son can be as dramatic as him, yes he admit that he’s dramatic. Some people nearby are watching them with displease in their eyes at his son’s behaviour, Harry silently apologize by raising his hand up.
“Be careful, okay.” Harry nodded with his fingers caressing her hair from the root to her lower back. It’s been a while since she cut her hair, she usually only trimmed and now it has almost reaches her arse.
“Mother wants you to keep it, she said that it's the only thing that your dad gave to Mother the night he handed you to her”
The hall was burst with applause when the hat was done singing. Professor McGonagall stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.
‘Okay okay you want a perfect tik tok video? I gave you one!’, because he had given up, right now he just want to lay his head on Harry’s shoulder or just be with him in general.
He took on the challenge of course.
“Your Jamie was a menace and he definitely got that attitude from you, your little troublemaker while your twin babies are literal angel like their mama.”, praised Draco at himself, he heard Harry chuckled at him.
‘Which student would most likely you want to be your boyfriend?’, asked Harry with his eyebrow knitted and face showed of curiosity and something he couldn’t comprehend. ‘Do we really have question my taste in guys right now, Potter?’
He run where his leg bring him without using his brain, he runs until he came to a stop at an empty corridor. A corridor where there’s no left or right exit so the only way he could walk away is to walk back from where he came.
Dobby was agitating, his ears dropped, that when he knew something was wrong, Dobby was hiding something. Before Dobby get to apparate out of his room, he asked him.
Without asking, Harry went down to his nipple and sucked it, he pulled the milk out of his body and it was erotic. Breastfeeding Jamie was different than the feeling of his father’s mouth on his nipples. When breastfeeding Jamie, it was comforting but when it came to his father, it was something else less innocent.
Harry help Draco with filling their plates with spaghetti and when it was Jamie’s plate to be filled, he clapped his hand loudly as he sees his favourite food, his hand was trying to grab it but Draco was quicker to stop him.
“Baby, wake up. Daddy thinks you’re ready for round two.”
“You know you can just ask Lyra or better, ask him yourself,” said Dahlia out of nowhere. He quickly hid his phone screen from her. What a busybody sister he has, he thought as he rolled his eyes.
“Harry - am i a good boy?” asked Draco as he took a long breath, Harry’s huge cock was inside him, inside of this beautiful angel’s body, implying himself on his cock.
He grinned mischievously as he walked to the end of the train and there was no Potter still, he came across an empty compartment and decided to reside in there where he could think.
He unbuckled the seat belt and carried Jamie out of the car while Draco’s slowly moving his feet out touching the even concrete ground. Harry put Jamie down and holds his tiny hand with his, “Yayy- yay”, chanted Jamie excited looking around with big grin on his face.
Again with the damn marks, he tried his best, he doesn’t succeed, that doesn’t mean he’s a failure. He did better than Cassie so why must he brings his marks up for the conversation, it was unnecessary.
Of course it’s Pansy Parkinson, the bane of his existence, he knows she will find a way to manipulate him into making tik tok with her.
Don’t tell Hermione this but Celestial is better at teaching than Hermione. She understood every single word that came out of her mouth. She makes their studies interesting by adding a little bit of commentary of her own.
When both the Gryffindor and the Slytherin are in the lead- tied, Dumbledore had the audacity to award Longbottom ten points for standing up for himself. Arsehole - he stands up for himself everyday but did he get awarded? The answer is no.
Harry hang his auror robe at the coat rack and then take Draco’s hand to help him to stand and took Jamie back in his arms.
Draco starts bouncing on his cock. As he went up and down, he whimpered as he felt the cock inside of him, pressing into his prostate.
“Thank you for giving me a ride. Today was tiring, I appreciate you so much,” he said genuinely from the bottom of his heart. Not going to lie, he would probably cry if he had to wait for his driver.
“It’s one of the best, not the best, babe but I’ll take the compliment.” laughed Draco softly.
“Fuck-baby. I need to stretch you open for my cock, ready for me”, said Harry as he moved his fingers furiously inside of him, Draco brought his hand to Harry’s thick and long cock, massaging the crown with his thumb, precum leaking out of it.
“Do you know what you’ve done to me, baby? You make me addicted to you. God, Draco I never felt like this before.”
Weasley was trying very hard not to show that he was in great pain but Madam Pomfrey can see try through him and asked him about his fingers, he lied and told her that he got bitten by a dog, she obviously doesn’t believe him but ask no further.
His mirror-self didn’t concentrating his eyes on the key his fingers are pressing but instead, he was watching them, his parents, his eyes shown affection towards them.
Draco’s moaned are getting harder and harder, he brought his free hand to Potter’s broad shoulders as he kissed Potter soundly, Potter deepened the kiss as his hand find his balls and fondling it with his rough hand, precome leaking out of him.
He doesn’t have to figure what was Sirius and him were doing as the next moment, Sirius stood up from the mirror and walked his way towards his mother. He took his father’s place and he was playing a slow song as he saw Amelia was resting her head on Sirius’s shoulder, swaying their body slowly as the music goes.
The name goes with alphabetical order so Draco still has the time to be nervous, he looked over Cassie and saw that she too was nervous and he gave her a private smile.
‘How about we just go back to the common room and sleep on our comfy bed?’, interfered Longbottom, looking scared but he was determined to get the word out of his quivered mouth.
‘Guess you can’t now’, he sticked out his tongue at her.
He wish that Sirius did not go to Azkaban, at least he won’t have a huge expectation burden on his shoulders, maybe he would have a great father-son relationship like most of the other kids have.
“Thank you for helping me with the children, I am not going to get pregnant until they at least turn two or three years old.” grumbled Draco under his breath.
“Now get out! Both of you. We will resume our discussion, I have a few matter I have to discuss with you, Draco.” Without waiting for a second, Draco take Cassie’s hand and pulled them out of the hellhole.
“You see the one that I’ve helped you trace with your finger?” asked Draco, waiting for the confirmation from Harry, slowly helping him understand and helping him if he lost.
“Come to bed, baby. I make your favourite food and I have a heating pad for your period pain and after you eat and are still hungry, I get lots and lots of snacks downstairs and chocolate.”
“Now serve your Queen, peasant,” command Larissa, casually slapping the back of her hand to his shoulder. The eyerolls is the answer she gets from Harry.
Before he got to reply to her, Black asked, toned neutral but with a little hint of sarcasm, “Draco? As in Draco Malfoy? As in my goodie two shoes cousin’s son?”
Harry lifted his head off his lap and they both laid down on the blanket, eyes looking up at the stars once their head hit the soft ground.
Here he was, in detention with Potter, Granger and surprisingly Longbottom. He heard that they got caught by Filch but he don’t about Longbottom though.
Jamie wrapped his little hand around Draco’s neck and smacked his tiny mouth to his pale cheeks as he gave him a big kiss on his left cheek.
Night came, Draco get ready in his room, he was wearing a light grey skinny jeans that hugged his arse and a blue shirt that fitted his body leaving no space for his body to breathe.
Cassie let go of her broomstick and rushed towards Longbottom, Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as him. Cassie’s face was furious because Madam Hooch didn’t even do anything until Longbottom fell down. He doesn’t know since when Cassie cared about Gryffindors especially Longbottom but he didn’t want to confront her now so he just let her do her thing.
“What I mean is that you and Malfoy are always together nowadays so it was kinda weird not seeing her with you.”
“Are you just going to stand there or join me?” Celestial suddenly voiced out when she realised there’s someone with her.
“People might say we moved at a fast pace but who are they to comment about our relationship? I know whenever I’m with you, I’m looking into my future. With you by my side.” Tears slowly leak out of both of their eyes. Draco nodded his head, waiting for Harry to continue again
Fuck - Draco is so fucking beautiful with his long blonde hair and his skinny body, his petite boobs he loves to suck on, bite on it leaving purple bruises around the areola.
“All I’m trying to say is, would you make me the luckiest man and be my Draco Potter?”
“Is there something funny?’
“Walk faster, both of you.”, order father as he was walking in front of them, holding a middle size chest that contained some dark arts objects under his arms. They complied as they looked around the dark alley. It smells terrible that Draco had to hold his breath, he always choked on the smell but then Cassie cast something around them.
“Want more of Daddy’s cock,” murmured Draco into Harry’s chest. Harry stroked Draco soft blonde hair slowly, sweeping his hair out of his face.
“Harry- I can’t feed you if kept teasing me”, moaned Draco as he bucked his arse. Harry chuckled at his antics, pulled his fingers out and went back to Draco’s nipples, grabbing his boobs which fill his hold hands as he palming Draco’s nipples, he can’t wait to suck on his husband’s breast.
“It’s going to be alright, let’s bolt for our life.”, said Draco as fear consumed his voice.
After he was done with his speech, the food appeared on the table. There was a lot of food but none of it is his favourite. He ate what he could because he was not that hungry. Crabbe and Goyle ate ravenously like they haven’t eaten for hundreds of years, he grimaced. Cassie was enjoying her food while talking to Daphne, if Mother saw this behaviour, she absolutely will not accept this type of behaviour.
‘Potter! I swear if you don’t put your big dick in me, I’m going to find someone else!’, said Draco choking on his breathe. He felt the arm on his waist tightened, he feels Potter pulling out his fingers from his tight little hole.
Suddenly, a whack on his arse brings his hands holding onto Harry’s biceps.
He was scared because he heard that the second pregnancy was worse than the first especially if they’re expecting twins.
“Oh yeah, like that huh?” Continuing thrusting on the same spot Draco moaned louder than before. Harry already found Draco’s prostate once he entered his hole because of his long and big cock but Draco was so used to the abuse on his prostate that it usually took fifteen minutes for him to cum.
“HARRY IT HURTS HARRY!” shouted Draco at his husband, changing his position on the bed, his legs are cramping, he felt nausea wash over him. The healer told him that his cervix was at 7 cm .
“Sometimes, we don’t choose who our family is, family is not determine by blood but by heart , but because of my one wrong move, we were betrayed by a family who we thought was loyal and it was all my fault, I gave them the idea to change the Secret Keeper and now I'm having my revenge,” Sirius Black answered seriously, although he was never a serious person growing up.
He was laughing so hard that he had to clutch his stomach as he bend his body forward. He almost fall to the ground himself for laughing too hard himself.
A few minutes later, Hagrid rushed over to them and Neville explain the situation as he shuddering in and out of breath. Draco felt bad for second but he quickly acts innocent as he saw Hagrid’s fuming face directed towards him.
She really can’t wait for her periods to go away.
He tucked the blanket over her body, her mouth open waiting to be fed, patiently waiting for Harry to find a comfortable position on the corner of the bed with plate in his hand.
‘Is that my clothes? Whatever let’s just get on with it’, pointing his fingers at the clothes that she was wearing but just waved his hand off after a second.
He heard footstep coming out of the kitchen as he unknot his tie.
He walked towards the door, with one final glance at the house, he closed the door behind him and went after Pettigrew.
‘Now you can gather ingredients from the cupboard and please work with a partner’, instructs Slughorn. Since he knew Pansy are going to work with Granger, and Blaise with Weasley. He has no other choice but to work with the mighty saviour of the Wizarding World.
“Harry- Let’s just quietly get the hell out of here. Please”, begged Draco, pulling his hand but suddenly the cloaked figure looked up as they hear Draco’s voice and at that moment, he knows he was going to die.
“Wait, so you really do have the scar?” she asked while jabbing her finger on her forehead. Harry then lifts up his messy fringe and shows it to them. Cassie watched with fascination in her eyes.
Quirrell doesn’t even answered his question, he was avoiding it but Draco are going to let it slide, for now.
Harry growled into the idea as he was still sucking on Draco’s breast, the feeling of the nipples inside his mouth while his other hand are playing with the other. When he was satisfied, his turn his attention towards the other nipple, the nipple he was playing with and suck on it, harder and harder.
When he was finally comfortable, he turned his head back, looking at his son, checking if he were alright while Harry shut the door and walked to the driver’s door and opened it. He crouched his head so it doesn’t hit his head on the roof of the car.
“We got our end-of year exam results back and father was waiting for us in his study room”, informed Cassie, face was scared for her results but not for him because he knows he did a very good job on his exam.
Turning his body to the side, he lay down Adrian in the middle, Jamie coming closer and laying himself down, carefully snuggling his little brother.
When Draco can’t take it anymore, he spoke, “Mother, Father I think we want to board the train now, you know to find an empty compartment.” The grown up stops speaking and looks at the time.
A few more thrust and he cum came shooting out of his cock and hit his neck and a few moment later, Harry joined in, cumming inside of Draco, Harry wish upon a star that tonight they do make baby.
“Don’t worry about that pretty head of yours, really, I do want to. Let’s go,” he took his hand and dragged him inside of the condominium, through the sliding door and into the lobby.
, her sentence was cut off by Potter whispered, rather loudly he might add to shut up.
“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” said father. “All those raids … I hope they’re paying you overtime?”, asked father in a mocking way. So he decided to speak up so they don’t cause any trouble, “Father, I think it was time go now. We have everything we needed.”
August turned to September, The 1st of September has finally come. He woke up feeling giddy for the first time in a month since his mother denied his wish for a pet, his mother did promise him to buy a pet for him when he’s a little bit older. Since he has a wand, he casts Tempus Charm to look at the time, which revealed it was 9 a.m, Draco have been reading and practicing a lot of simple spells since he bought his wand.
‘I can hear you clearly, bloody fool of you because I am in your mind’, the hat exclaimed.
“I thought you were due in two weeks? What- what?” ask Harry with a hint of nervousness in his voice but he masks it well enough.
Using his paw, he softly patted his omega’s pregnant belly,
“I swear Malfoy, if you are trying to tell anyone about it-”, said Potter, stepping forward to him.
“I’m gonna come- I’m gonna-,”, groaned Harry into his neck as he came.
He shouldn’t have given in to her puppy eyes on her pug face. Yes, he just insulted his friend in his internal monologue because he wouldn’t dare to call her that in front of her face. Let’s just say that he learned his lesson when they were just a mere child.
The midnight wind blows their hair and the cold air seeps into their skins. “No, I'm not jealous.”
He didn’t look at Severus in the face, he doesn’t need his pity, he just need someone to listen to his mourning, that’s it but then something truly shocking him happened.
“And then I decided that I want to be your friends and maybe somewhere along the line, we could be more, I know I wanted more but you kept on avoiding me.”
‘The mirror show us what we desired, and in the mirror, I saw them. Mom, Amelia, I don’t know what to call her, she was alive instead of six feet under and Sirius, he was not in Azkaban for murdering his former friend and those twelve Muggles.’, said Draco as he tried to hold back the tears that threatening to fall down.
‘You know what Draco, the thing I said in the dormitory was true. I regretted being your best friend’, he glared at him but Draco ignored him and addressed Cassie.
‘Break it up, there, gents, break it up-’, Hagrid was wading towards them through the sea of books. In an instant he had pulled Mr Weasley and father apart. Both of them have a huge bruise on their face. Father was still holding the girl Weasley’s old transfiguration book, he thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice.
“Uh Oh, that’s not how you should talk to someone who will tell Madam Pomfrey right away about the dragon bite.”, said Draco as he was blackmailing him, after a few minutes of thinking, he finally gave a loud sighed.
“If I didn’t know better, Draco - I say you were trying to implant the house idea to our son’s head,” lifting the corner of his mouth up and raising his eyebrow.
“Anything else?”
They ended the video call after like ten minutes of talking since Mrs Potter’s screen break is over, she’s going to have to continue with her acting. Draco heard that her upcoming new movie is a horror film which is a new excitement for her since it was her first time acting in a horror film, safe to say that he was quite proud of her as if she was his mother.
“Yes and I picked you up to our room.”, answered Harry, Draco looked around his surrounding and he was indeed in their room, he didn’t even realized that Harry already moved him.
‘Uhm Professor please don’t tell my Father about this but you can tell my mother but not father,’ he begged.
This is him being grateful and helping her with her restaurant by being a ‘quarter time waiter’ whenever he wanted. Mother said that his beauty led people’s hearts and minds to her restaurant, which was a lie since he hasn't had a boyfriend since forever. If he’s pretty then why no one wants to be his boyfriend.
Harry opened the door to his room, Jamie’s room are decorated with red coloured wall on Harry insistent because Harry said that he can tell that Jamie are going to be a Gryffindor and Draco scoffed at the idea. His room is quite big and he has a twin size bed because no child of his will suffer from discomfort of a small bed.
“You see, you even woke Dobby up.”, said Draco as he rolled his eyes, crossing his arms together.
“I don’t appreciate being kept in the dark, Mother.”
“And about your old man. You have proof enough by aced the past exams you sat. What more proof do you want? Because I can still think a lot and if he talks shit about you. I’m going to the manor myself bringing Sirius to piss him off.”
He has never been more annoyed with his brother, Caleb as he is now when he saw his fingertips rubbing on the back of the angel’s hand sublimely, giving Draco the doe eyed whenever someone caught his eyes. Waiting for Draco to take the bait but he was surprised when Draco just ignored him blindly.
Draco chose the bed that was attached to the wall and sat down, took out his trunk from his pocket and unshrink it. The trunk grew to its original size, he threw open the lid and he screamed, both Blaise and Theo were shocked that they jumped out of their cozy bed.
“Oka’ fine, I forgive ya’for now”, said Hagrid, letting out a long breath after a few minutes of thinking. “But we’re going to change group - Neville, you stay with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’this idiot”, said Hagrid but Draco flashed a cheeky smile when Hagrid called him an idiot.
As Blaise grabbed both of his and Pansy’s hand, out of the corner of his eyes, he saw Potter and Weasley are not following their Gryffindor’s prefects and their eyes was looking around with cautiousness so he decided to follow them. He tugged Blaise’s hand and tilted his head towards Potter and murmured Potter’s  as if Blaise didn’t get the memo before, he probably do now.
“Where did you go at night? Just answer me because I will not get angry at you, I would never.”, Draco brings his hand to his head, stroking Dobby’s head softly as he saw Dobby’s body are getting tenser as Draco kept asking him question.
He never knew that Potter was this romantic, but he has nothing against it.
, whispered Longbottom in Potter’s ear, the boy’s body was trembling terribly before, but right now he was truly scared by the clear horror in his eyes.
********
“Why are you laughing?” he asked
“But it was a Gryffindor red! It’s ugly, he should be wearing Slytherin green,” said Draco, picking himself up from the ground with Harry’s arms around his waist, rubbing his side of huge belly.
“Just let him wear whatever he wants, Draco,”, smoothing Harry at him, he walked inside the room, towards Draco who was sprawling on the floor with his huge pregnant belly, Jamie’s clothes scattered around him as he was messily trying to help Jamie few moments ago.
“Jamie! Stop!”, said Draco sternly while looking at his son, grabbing his hand before he could chuck some more spaghetti on his poor father.
He knows that any day now his babies are going to welcome themselves into the world when he first realized his early sign at labour. Looking at himself in the mirror, he notices his baby's head slowly drops to his pelvis as the day goes by. He felt uncomfortable most of the night that he usually will wake up in the middle of the night because of pain and heaviness, his increased peeing is not helping too.
“NO! JAMIE HATE MAMA!”
‘It wasn’t his fault, Professor-’
“It’s okay, my body is yours, you could do anything you want with me.” Mumbled Draco, his voice vibrating to his chest.
Dobby told him that he sealed the barrier to Platform 9 ¾ once Harry Potter tried to get through the barrier. Draco thought that he was brilliant and laughed for a long time. He gripped his hand into a fist and told Dobby to fist bump it. Dobby didn’t understand what it meant so Draco had to teach him.
“Yes and papa, don’t forget about him,” chuckled Draco lightly while looking at his husband who was looking at them with adoration.
He reached into girl Weasley’s cauldron and extracted, from amidst the glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of
She rubbed her chin with her index and thumb as she was thinking, she then looked him in the eyes with the mischief on her eyes, “What’s on your mind dear brother of mine?”
“What in Mother’s bloody right mind is she thinking, buying supplies in early August, it’s so freaking hot out here, I think I might have sunburn,” Draco walks beside Cassie, he complains silently because he doesn't want Mother to hear.
It took Draco fifteen minutes when he walked into the living room with a plate filled with food, Harry was already make himself comfortable on the sofa, legs resting on top of the table that was place in the living room.
‘Then let me initiate the first truth or dare then for you’.
They bid goodbye and Harry took his phone back, “Bye Mom, remember -I’m bringing Draco next week for family dinner,” said him as he reminded his Mom about going to his parents home. He pressed the end button to end the call and shoved his phone back inside his pocket.
He then pulled Draco towards their destination, feet rushed them to their bedroom and Harry fulfilled his promise and fucked him hard. He did faint as he rides Harry’s cock and slumped down to his hairy muscular chest once his last ounce of energy are gone, he moved him to the side and continuously fucking him side way and Harry never pulled out of him until the next working.
“Here, tie your hair.”
‘You know what Pansy, I’m going to take Draco to our room to devour him in there’, said Harry unashamed of his word, took Draco hand and rushed them towards their dorm.
“I still remembered the first time, the feeling of you clinging on to me, hugging me from the back in the fire when I saved you. I had the realization that I want that to be my forever, the feeling of your warmth on me”, answered Harry sincerely, looking into Draco’s grey eyes.
Before they fell asleep, Harry turned his back and looked at him, Jamie in between them, Harry softly spoke to him, reaching out to Draco’s arm that was hugging Jamie.
A blonde girl, her hair is pushed aside by the night air. Her feet are dangling out of the tower. Once in a while, she would bring the cigarette butt to her mouth.
“Come Jamie, let’s get you to bed. My baby boy are sleepy. You want me to carry you to your room?, asked Draco as he took pity on his tired son, his son nodded his head in agreement.
It was in the middle of February, Iris was studying alone in the library, no Hermione, no Ron and especially no Celestial but unfortunately, she spoke too soon because ten minutes later, Hermione came barging with stacks of books in her arms, her hair is bushier than usual.
Before he presented into his secondary gender, he thought he’s going to be a beta because to present as an omega, they usually hit the age of twelve, a normal age for puberty. Even then, he felt the creepy eyes of the alpha’s watching him, especially Riddle.
He came down to the living room where his husband occupied, watching the telly with his leg on the coffee table. He counted to three and once it reached the number, his hand collided with the back of his husband’s head.
‘Nope! I’m not going to listen to you. You are not my mother’, said Draco sternly.
“So you can’t shrink an object that contains another object in it,” he said. Draco nodded his head while holding one of his tiny silk pajamas. He felt stupid because now he have to Engorgio all of his clothes, books and the only photograph of his biological family. He never parted away from the photograph and would always bring it anywhere with him.
Blaise was the only one who was laughing at his sarcastic joke but he saw slight movement of Potter trying not to react. The other’s shoulders are tense until Potter got an idea since he was Gryffindor and stereotypically speaking, Gryffindor was born to lead. What a bunch of crap.
He was in no advantage because Weasley was on top of him, wrestling him on the ground. Although he was focusing on Weasley, he saw that both Crabbe and Goyle had join in and the hilarious part was that Longbottom trying to take on them.
It’s true what people said, mothers are the best at everything and it's been a year he visited the mansion since he came out to his father and told him that he had a boyfriend.
He jolted and looked down at his Charm Professor.
With confusion, he followed his father’s order and when he felt the same thing as his dad, he jumped up and down until he unintentionally kicked Harry in his wolf’s face.
He was brought out of his daydream when Harry waves his hand in his face. He looked down, cheek redden in embarrassment.
‘Hey there handsome’, said Draco as he walked to him to greet him and give him a chaste kiss but Harry sneaked his arms around his waist and now they were having a heated kiss.
Draco just know that they were known as rotten to the core and a bad blood, his whole family is, in the eye of normal wizard and witches, they were a dark wizard family, they only respected the Malfoy only because of their old money and fortune.
He nearly succeeded but in the end, he was too nice. He could have just said no since he’s the owner’s son. When he saw them first come into the door, his eyes immediately laid on Harry Potter, just like how he remembered years ago when he hadn't reached his maturity yet.
*********
I can't believe that I could write this quicker than the last fic. It seems that January 20th are near and I'm afraid to say that my school are going to reopen for my grade only since this year I'm going to take a big exam.
If Draco need to be honest, Professor McGonagall looked impressed but she had to conceal her expression.
He decided that he wants to shower, it took him ten minutes to get out of bed and ten more minutes to get him in the shower. He took his clothes off and went inside the shower.
Few hours later, he was laying on his bed, father’s words still kept seeps through his mind, he can’t stop thinking what father said about him.
“I’m joking, babe”
Harry’s hand slowly traced the smooth skin of Draco’s leg until it went up to his knickers, taking the knickers off and sneaking it inside of his pocket.
“Okay, daddy. Love you” mewled Draco as his last ounce of energy was gone.
With James on his arms, he walked slowly and carefully to the couch to take a rest since his son has drained his energy on finding him and making dinner for his family.
“Come off it James, I’m the most good-looking in our friend group, it is still a wonder why Lily right here would want to marry you,” snide a friendly remark.
“You know, Draco. I know it’s romantic and all but I really can’t find any constellations at all. All I saw is a dote which I know is the stars.”
“Shut it”, as he gave him a nasty look, hands wiping away the mess on the corner of Jamie’s mouth, Harry raises his hands in surrender.
They were having quiet dinner with conversation flowing between Harry and Draco going on with Jamie blabbering with his mouth full. As Draco was feeding Jamie and himself, Harry’s hand laid on top of his on the table and pulled his hand to his mouth but then Jamie had to ruin the moment by grabbing the spaghetti forcefully and throw it aggressively at Harry. Draco didn’t have time to stop him before Harry’s whole face was a mess.
So, they don’t talk about it after that but deep down Draco hopes that Harry changes his mind on the name and finally he does after seeing his husband being in pain, trying to give birth to their twins.
Blaise and Theo who have stopped laughing stopped beside him, Draco shows him the page about the information about the spell. Blaise read through it out loud for Theo to hear and when he was at the last word, he laughed again.
With a hoarse voice, Draco asked him for the time. Harry casts a wandless tempus and it shows that they were late for their Transfiguration lesson. He hopes that Professor McGonagall was a having a good morning because he don’t want to mess with her.
He grabbed her hand and maneuvered her around, they came to a stop in front of their parent’s room, He turned to her and bowed as if  allowing her to go in first.
“Yeah sure,” he chuckled softly for the first time that night before he continued, “Will it be alright if there’s a few pickles in it?”
He don’t know why but when Hagrid called him Draco, something warm set inside of him so the irritation of Hagrid assigning Longbottom with him died down a little but he was still annoyed that he got Longbottom.
‘Blaise’, he said while nodding his head towards him. ‘Midnight all right?’ We’ll meet you in the trophy room, that’s always unlocked and empty of people since nobody wants to wander there and if you lose, there will be consequences, you’ll have to do what I said, understand?’
“Hello Hogwarts too?” he greeted the messy black hair boy, the boy who was fascinated with the needles and the cotton that was levitating around him looked up from his observation, turning his face to look at him.
As they walked farther away from the castle, Draco could see the light resource from the big giant’s hut. Then he heard a shout coming near by the forest.
Jamie tittered at his father’s action. “Can I have a kiss too, Jamie?”, asked Draco as he pursed his lips to him but before Jamie got to lean in into the kiss, his father was quicker and kiss him full on the lips.
So, when it was time to go home, he was really relieved because he knows his husband would make his day better, he always do. His husband, his lovely and thoughtful husband, Draco Potter née Malfoy.
The sound of a cat hissing was near as the sound of a heavy footstep of a man. He knows if he don’t find a way right now, he will a dead meat the next moment he lived.
with another sentence he didn’t dare to say out loud to his five-year-old.
“Why don’t you eat, Draco?” asked Cassie worriedly for some reason. “Not hungry,” he replied as he pushed his plate further from him.
They walked out of the shop, Draco turned his head to look at the boy, the boy looked back at him, and they waved each other goodbye.
***************
‘Not gonna lie, I smell quidditch pitch, treacle tart and butterbe-, holy Merlin’s pants’, his eyes widened with realization, he knew he likes Potter but he didn’t know that he could be in love with him. He was speechless since he just realize the part of him, but with Potter knowing it.
It was now Draco’s turn, his gaze locked on Draco longer than he did on Cassie before he speak up.
Finally, after a bloody long minute maybe fifteen minutes now, he doesn't bloody know anymore, the hat said to him, ‘I know where to put you now.’
“Not with me,” said father, his long nostrils flaring. Draco was so fucking seething that he walked around the room, looking for any object that could take his mind off father’s stupid statement about him, with his hands clenched into a fist, he looked into the glass eye, concentrating his mind on the fucking stupid useless item.
Professor McGonagall was so stunned that she stared at him for a long time because he dared to defy the Gryffindor founder's hat’s decision. He doesn’t care what people think of him right now because right now he gets what he wants and he wants to be put into Slytherin.
“Me out of the blue trying to talk to you? Trying to be near you?”, answered Harry as he brought their intertwined hand to his mouth, kissing Draco’s knuckles again and again.
“Can I see our sons, please?”, asked Draco, peeking his head up and looking towards the cribs, Harry moved towards the cribs and carried their sons in each arm. Draco held out his hand and Harry put one of the twins down to his arms, telling him that this is their first born twin, Draco pushed the blanket off his face that wrapped around his son's fragile body, he looked down at his son on his arms and gasped softly.
When his legs brought him in front of the door, he walked in without knocking because why would he, he was paying someone a visit.
“Oh, you saw,” she stopped and that is when realisation hit her like a trunk, “That’s why you have been avoiding me!” For some reason, she is too happy about the situation. Iris scoffed at the accusation, crossing her arms over her chest.
The sorting for the first year already ended and he still hasn't seen the black haired boy. He was agitated because Potter should be across from his right now, eating the Welcoming Feast. Where was he?
How much points would it cause to get caught roaming the castle after curfew? Twenty points? It can’t be twenty points, it must cost more than twenty.
“Speak clearly, Draco. Malfoy don’t mumble and Malfoy obviously would get everything they want.”, complained father as he drummed his fingers on the counter, which is a weird action he thought.
Families that were invited have a rank in the society, all of them are Pureblood, rumours has it said that most of them are followers of the Dark Lord including his father. He doesn't know what to think of it.
With Severus’s arms still wrapped around him, he finally hugged him back. Severus was trying to hold back the tears as he told him the story about her.
He smashed their lips together as Harry pulled him closer to his chest, their length are touching, their body are touching each other. Harry moved his hand to his waist and down to his arse, squeezed it violently that Draco moaned into the kiss.
“Harry- fuck me.. please..”, begged Draco desperately when Harry kept on teasing him. He can feel the precum leaking out of his cock.
‘GRYF-’
When Goldstein realised Potter’s furious glare directed at him, he averted his eyes away from both of them. Draco looked at him with questioning look and Potter tilted his head to the side with confusion on his face. Draco’s eyes lingered on the arm on his waist, Potter followed his eyes movement, that’s when he realized his arm are on his waist.
They followed Filch and marched off across the dark grounds, as they were walking, Draco wondered why they have to do detention out of castle, why not inside? Why don’t they write lines? Maybe scrub the dirty trophies in the empty classroom. That what students usually do in detention.
“Nothing, father.”, said Cassie elegantly like she was taught. “Everything is in perfect condition. I was frightening myself by looking down at this big ball of eyes.”, continues Cassie. Father was standing in front of them, eyes looking around them as if they were up to something, well he was up to something, not Cassie.
“Thank god you cast something before I die because of this shitty smell, smells like your room actually when I think about it.”, joked Draco as they were walking to a store.
“Harry Potter”, murmured Dobby, Draco almost didn’t hear what Dobby said but he heard ‘Potter’ so he knows what he is saying.
“Maybe my Potter’s sperm is so powerful that both of our sons look like me,” he chuckled softly in the quiet room. Draco agreed to what he said until he recalled that Harry said ‘both of their sons’ and not ‘all of their sons’.
When some of the Gryffindors walked inside the hall and sits at their respective table, the other houses was confused as to why they were not wearing their red cloak. It seems that no one could cancel the spell so that must mean his charms worked.
“Oh, it’s you,’ said Weasley, looking at him as if he were something unpleasant. “Of course, it’s me, Weasley. What do you expect? Your knight in shining amour?” Chuckled Draco at his own joke.
and sorry for making Ron kinda of an asshole a little bit but I promise his attitude is canon but from Draco's point of view
He casts ‘tempus’ to check on the time and it was four o’clock in the morning, Jamie must be having a nightmare. Draco was still soundly asleep as the buzzing sound could only awaken the wand owner.
When she finally knocks the door, she gets a demand reply from the inside, the high authority type of voice, it was Lucius who answered. Before she opens the door, Iris slides her hand around her waist, deeply kissing her.
Admiring his boyfriend’s face as he traced them with his fingers, acknowledging his boyfriend’s beauty.
“Hi Harry,” greeted Hermione from the door, walking slowly, she too was pregnant and her due date was in four more months, Ronald was beside him, guiding her to them.
When he was done being angry at his father, he turns his attention back to his mama, shyly asking him for a kiss, Draco obliged and pursed his lips again, moving closer to them. Jamie happily leaned forward and kiss him messily, almost missing his mouth. When he was satisfies, he clapped his chubby hands together.
He looked around the room and saw that Weasley was laying on the bed while Madam Pomfrey tend his injured finger. When Weasley saw him, he knows what about to happened.
‘You are friend with Granger now? A Gryffindor?’, asked Draco, quirking his eyebrow. Pansy and Blaise both had walked to their respective dorm, probably to curse at their pillow over how reckless he is.
‘I don’t think so blondie- this is not the way to Hospital Wing- SO YOU ARE LYING’, accused Peeves.
i don't bloody knows if I do it right
Harry pulls Draco’s hands away from his face, he looks at Draco’s worn out face, his sunken eyes with dark circles due to tiredness. Draco lays his head on his husband’s shoulders and asks him a question he had never asked before.
At that moment, a stooping man known as Mr Borgin appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face with his wrinkly hand. Although, Draco was examine the objects on the shelves right now, he kept one ear open, listening to their conversation while Cassie was somewhere in the corner, looking at glass eye she found fascinating.
Narcissa was speechless for a moment but she gathered her thoughts and carefully asked him, “And where are you going and why can’t you let Remus take care of him?”
“Your Mother’s homemade food.”
While he and Filch was talking, Draco looked over to the dark forest, his legs quivered unconsciously, he has lost his coolness somewhere along the line and he wanted to escape from this creepy place.
“Fine!”, said Weasley unwillingly, fist held tightly as if he just wish he could punch him right there and then. His eyes met his and Draco lifted the corner of his mouth, giving an effect of a prat.
‘Yes! Yes! Harry! Yourss -nghh only yours’, screamed Draco as he agreed with Potter. ‘You belong to me Draco, not Goldstein or anyone else. Mine!’ he growled as the sound of their heavy breathing and the sound of skin slapping against skin echo through the room.
He sat up and crossed his legs, laying the twin breastfeeding pillow on his lap, bringing the twins and set both of them down against the pillow. Carefully, he adjusted them to his and their comfort.
“First-year follow me”, she instructs
Pansy screamed in glee and run to her dorm, Draco looked at his boyfriend in surrender but his boyfriend are looking at him with excitement. The people around them all can’t wait because Pansy posts tik tok videos a lot and people are enjoying it.
As they were having a conversation in the back, his eyes locked into a shelf full of skulls, he turned his head towards where Cassie is and she in fact has her back on him. It was a perfect chance.
One finger turns into more, he goes from slow and steady, carefully fingering Draco opened to his cock, to furiously jabbing four fingers inside.
As he walked towards them, Weasley was looking at him suspiciously that he had to look away to hide his smirk and when he was done, he scolded his expression and walked to him.
“It’s the Black blood inside of him,” Sirius suddenly chimed in, arrogantly exclaiming.
‘Hey! That’s my clothes you are wearing!’, screamed Pansy from a far as they went inside the room. Harry slammed the door shut and vanished their clothes just by the snap of his fingers.
He thought that he was going to receive a confession letter like Potter did but thank Merlin it was only the flowers. He asked Flitwick about the sender but Flitwick said that it was anonymous for him. He laid the flowers on his work table, not caring at all about it.
He’s increased peeing makes him lose one kilogram. He sometimes took a long nap to save his energy for the later. A dull ache in his back and usually asking Harry for a message and he happily obliged.
He folded the letter back and tugged it inside the book, walked back to Weasley to lay the bag back from where he got it.
‘It’s toxic but if you still want to befriend them then go ahead’.
“Well we could surely do that since no one was around but later, okay?”, his hand lifting Draco up so he could sit comfortably on his lap, hands staying there and caressing Draco’s inner thighs.
Did he heard correctly? Weasley said something about dragon hatching and Granger had a annoyed expression on her face. It seems like the muggleborn was denying his friend wish to see a dragon hatching.
But he knows that they will follow him and Cassie because their father probably told them to follow the Malfoy's around like a bodyguard.
Would her father hear about it? Absolutely not but her mother might if Harry found out about it and decide to go and blabber to her mother.
They chatted for a few minutes until Draco decided that he really needs to go to sleep before he’s going to have a bad day tomorrow, he messaged Harry.
Once he was done, he put the container back into the basket, wiped his mouth with the handkerchief that was provided by Harry.
“No, sorry I have a husband since you can see that I’m heavily pregnant with his,” answered Draco annoyed with the stranger.
Jamie looked at his father for support and saw him nodding his head for him to start, a confirmation that he could do it.
The bell rang when they opened the door, Madam Malkin greets and instructs them to stand in front of the mirror on the stool since she was occupied by lots of children their age. They then heard the bell ring indicate that someone has walked inside, they heard that Madam Malkin told a child to stands besides them, they heard the footsteps walking until it came to a stop beside them, they turned their head, and there stood a boy who have messy black and wore glasses on the stool.
Right after Dumbledore announced that Slytherin won, he decided that he had a points to give to his favourite students ; Potter and his friends, and additional of Longbottom, they were awarded fifty points each but Potter was awarded sixty point. For what? Save the bloody school?
‘Do you think you can attend for class for today or maybe just skip some classes?’, asked Severus in his usual haughty voice as he stood up from his sitting position and walked to the door.
Regulus moved his body away and climbed down the bed, answering his question with a continuously bobbing his head. “Okay, let’s go.”
He almost succeeded, just a few more coaxing but then the twins decided that today is not going to be the day. Draco was looking from Jamie to the house and back to Jamie.
He was about to open his mouth to continue the conversation when suddenly, his phone ringing, he quickly picked up the call and brought it to his left ear.
“Harry,” called out to him in shock. “Your fans must be getting wild if they ever find out about you proposing to me.”
“Uhm Draco, I think I found something but I don’t know you will like it,” she took out the photograph from the album and showed it to him.
Uhm.. so I hope you like it?
“Checking on my baby, of course.” said Draco as he rolled his eyes, he walked up the stairs, bringing him in front of Jamie’s room. His hand rested on the doorknob, he knocked once - no answer, twice - still there’s no answer but he could hear soft sniffing.
“Are you dating anyone?” she asked, a few days have gone by since they went to the salon.
‘ Honestly Potter, even if the door is locked, he can’t do anything about it’, rolled his eyes for the multiple times today. ‘And you Longbottom, stop acting like a kick puppy.’ as he leaned away from the door, turned his body to face the room that they had just entered.
“What do you have there, baby” said Draco as he peeked his eyes inside. Harry’s hand went up to his eyes and closed his vision.
“Jamie is sorry, Mama”
“I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,” snapped father. Now it was Draco’s turn to be angry and he was feeling abash that father told his marks in front of a stranger nonetheless and discouraged him on his studies.
Stay safe and always wear mask whenever you go BECAUSE COVID-19!!
“No matter, gradually she will be like her father and brother.”, said Mr Weasley, sneering at the thought that maybe they are a good wizards family as he shakes his head.
He wanted to mess with Longbottom more, it brings joy into his soul, so he decided to point his fingers somewhere in the dark and order Longbottom to look at it, Longbottom was looking at the dark empty space studiously, wand at the ready.
When he was content with the pictures his phone self-taken, he turned it off and levitated it back to his bedside table.
“Baby- we are in public,” said Draco as he was trying very hard not to moan in a public area, especially in front of Jamie and that shook Harry out of his dilemma.
Draco complied and moved Jamie to the side so he could slide in into the bed, Jamie then moved his little body closer to him and he tugged the blanket on them.
‘You actually believe she’s going to throw me out of the school? You forgot one thing Pans, I’m a Malfoy’, he said with a hint of arrogance in his voice.
He knows it was wrong. He was the professor while Draco is his student for fuck sake. How can a thirty five years old man cannot look away at the sixteen years old Slytherin boy.
Holy fuck, Draco found the Mirror of Erised!!!
He was relieved because half an hour more and then he can finally go back to his rented expensive monthly paid condominium near his uni now. He is not a spoiled brat but he still needs a good place to live, a big space to live.
Although the Gryffindor won the Quidditch Cup, Slytherin was still on the lead on the house points so in that case, Slytherin are going to win the House Cup but fate and luck are never on his side.
The big oaf was striding towards them from the darkness, a sloppy dog at his heels. His hand was clutching a large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulders.
He was not paying attention at the match at all but his eyes lingered over Potter fly around the pitch looking for the Golden Snitch but when Potter did find the Snitch, Marcus Flint blocked Potter from reaching for the Snitch.
Potter released their entwined hands and clutched his forehead. Oh dear Merlin, he don’t want to die young, he still have some achievement he wanted to achieve.
“Jamie - what did Mama tell you just now? No jumping,” scolded Harry lightly at his son's behaviour but he let it pass since he was just an excited big brother who just met his newborn brothers.
**************
“Jamie - bad dream - mama is leabing me, because you no want me anymore. Be- be- because mama loves the babies more than Jamie. Leabing me alone and hab new family.”
He felt Jamie’s body lean against him, his small hand carefully rubbing his stomach. Draco enjoyed moment like this but seconds later they were interrupted by a creaking sound of the front door opening.
Draco was horrified and speechless, took out his clothes and show it to Theo who too joined Blaise laughing at him, he shook his head hoping that he did not just make the greatest mistakes of his life because all of his clothes and book did not grew to it real size even though he has unshrink the trunk. He took out his Charm book and flipped through the book until he came to a chapter about shrinking spells.
Cassie saw the trouble on his face and seized the skull out of his hand and hid it behind her back with one hand, composed themselves as they stood side by side, so father couldn’t assume anything.
He was wrong once he entered the compartment because there is one lonely blonde girl, her hair was the same shade of the Malfoy’s platinum blonde. She was sitting alone, reading a magazine he had never seen before. She had her wand tucked behind her ear, which is not a brilliant place for wizards to put their wand.
“But if you guys are not dating, there must be something wrong with the universe and one of you needs to fix it.”
He moves his eyes to another fruit when he was pleased with his choice, right now he was searching for dragon fruits because Jamie loves those and he was going to buy more just for his son. He picked up the fruit and show it to Jamie.
“Keep pushing Mr Potter, I can see one of the baby’s head,” he follows the healer words and kept on pushing, he was tired, his brain can’t make up any word anymore because as he pushed, he can feel his opening growing bigger and bigger so the baby could come out, suddenly he heard a wailed.
‘Professor Quirrell, didn’t you just fainted just now? From a healing book that I read, fainting episode that is not serious should only last a few seconds but it will make the person feel unwell and recovery may take several minutes but when I looked at you, you are quite well that you are trying to help to tackle the troll’.
“Want - hrgg - Daddy hpmm so much!” emphasizing every word he can. With each thrust, Draco whined in satisfaction.
He don’t know what to say since he was never been alone with Potter before so this is something new.
Potter and Granger was standing and looking around the forest when they came into view.
Lily walked towards her and handed Draco. She took him willingly, her eyes lingered on her son’s face, full of love to give. The baby sensed that he was being held by his mother and started to cry because of thirstiness. Amelia pulls up her labor gown and brings her nipple closer to Draco’s lips. With his eyes still close, the baby found his mother’s nipple and he sucked on it eagerly.
‘I love you too, Harry’, whispered Draco as he looks at Potter with affection.
“Trying to get Mom to make a Youtube video with her,” answered Harry, hands smoothly stroking Draco’s soft skin.
For the past few weeks, I have decided to post every once a month since I'm going to write more than 5k+ words but don't take my word seriously because starting from 2021, I'm going into my last year of high school.
The photos inside the album have a lot of pictures of a young blonde hair woman he had never known and heard of, who looked exactly like the female version of Father. Maybe that’s why Mother kept the photo album hidden.
Harry charmed his cock slicked with lube, tugging his cock with his hand as their body moved down so Draco’s back could laid on the bed, he don’t really have to tug his cock to make it hard since looking at Draco the moment he step inside the house already making his cock stood up.
“So, by pushing me into an empty classroom and kissed me aggressively, your meaning of ‘doing something’?”, said Draco as he smiled cheekily.
Father went back to taunting Mr Weasley, “Obviously not,” he said. “Dear me, what’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?”
Without waiting, he stood up and walked over to him, lifted him up into his arms and brought him over to where Draco was. Draco too stood up and tilted his head to the door, wanting to discuss alone without the other family members interference.
He scoffed at Potter’s great talent at Quidditch, ‘You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted some money on the ground!’, and without a warning, Weasley heavy body jumped on him, making them stumbling to the ground.
It all changed when one summer Draco came back looking all hot, lithe body, waiting to be devoured.
“Mama is here, baby. Mama is here. Don’t cry,” soothing the babies with his words which did not work at all, but their whimpering slowly quieted down.
“What is it, Potter? Don’t be shy, spit it out,” her stomach gives her butterflies when Celestial chuckles teasingly but she stops when she sees trouble on Iris’s face.
“Nothing,” he answered and continued walking towards his room and opened his bedroom door. He took in his surroundings, his bed where he slept with his late-wife. He opened the closet, took out Amelia’s dress and smelled it. The smell of her reminds him of the warm and sunny summer time.
The boy who was in a boat with him was sorted in Gryffindor.
He had learned his lesson, he should not trust Peeves, how dare that stupid poltergeist said that there were no one at the Astronomy Tower and went to call McGonagall on him; and he shouldn’t sneaked out on that day, and when he get caught, he tried save his own arse by switching the blame on Potter saying that he saw Potter sneaking out to the Astronomy Tower, with McGonagall dragging him by the ears until they reached the tower, no on was on sight and she gave him detention after that.
Comment down below on what do you for this chapter and lets just say that I almost done with First Year but it will took be long time to post it.
What curious is, Draco was also linked to the Malfoys. Maybe even the House of Black decided that the Malfoy’s are better parents than him.
“But you are behind the Mudblood girl. Now tell me, both of you- how could a wizard and a witch like both of you, raised with magic could do worst that the Mudblood?”, asked father sternly.
“When I speak, give me some respect and look at me!”, roared father as he was getting angrier, Draco lifted his head up, eyes locked with his father’s cold grey eyes.
Draco knows Harry was looking so he invited the Ravenclaw to touch him further by reciprocating the action. Just a light touch on the arm, nothing more but that small action makes his blood boil.
Father discussed about him joining the Quidditch team this year but Draco answered confidently that if Cassie are not in the team, he don’t want to be in the team.
He wrote letters to his best friends - Pansy and Blaise ranting about how awful Potter is and the reply he got did not satisfy his need. They are his best friends, they should support him and agree to whatever he said but instead, they told him that he might be ‘obsessed’ with Potter.
He then patted his hand on the bed, without questioning Draco’s intention, Dobby climbed on his bed and slump his shoulders down.
But anyways.. be sure to leave kudos and comment :)
He then turned his attention back to the hat and whispered venomously, ‘Listen, if you don’t put me in Slytherin when I put you back on my head, you won’t be sorting crap next year, so understand?’
He murmured as he kisses his neck, biting hard on it.
His hands roamed around Harry’s body, nails digging into his muscle arms as he fucked him harder the minute goes by.
Around his wrist, he was wearing a bracelet given by Harry on his 19th birthday and he never took it off ever since while his neck showing off the necklace of Harry’s initials on it. When he asked why did Harry buy it for him, Harry just shrugged his shoulders and tell him in a possessive way that other wizards needs to know that Draco was his, his wedding ring wrapped around his slim finger.
Feeling content, he crawled up to Draco, “Good morning, Mummy” he greeted Draco with a smile, two of his front teeth are missing. “When is my sister gonna come out, I can’t wait to play with her already. Can’t you push her out already or force her?” Regulus questioned.
“I’m sorry, okay. I’ll admit, I was at fault. I was bored and scared, the only entertainment was Longbottom. I’m not going to do it again, at least on him”, said Draco as he raises his hand in surrender, with his peripheral vision looking at Longbottom.
“Please give it to him when he asked about his family.”
“I’m sorry Mr Potter but that was not possible,” and then the healer decides to explain why in the hell it was not possible to just push the babies out right now, what’s the bloody point of having magic when you have to birth normally. Can’t the babies suddenly reappear in the room and out of his pregnant belly?
“So, I could be in any house?” he asked Mother but Father answered him for her.
Harry’s mouth left his and went trailing down to his neck, brushed his hair to the side by nudging his head.
When the boy saw him, he smiled widely. “Can we sit here? Most compartments are full,” he asked them with Cassie trailing behind him.
“What happened,” asked Blaise when he walked towards Draco and when he saw what happened, he fell down, held his belly and laughed.
Both Draco and Harry inherit his parents wealth since Harry’s father is a national football player who has retired while his father works in a political field. Let’s just say that both of them are crazy rich. Mother is a famous restaurant owner while Harry’s mom is an actress.
He starts the engine and Draco took over the radio because Harry has a bad music taste and Harry doesn’t actually care about it anyways, Harry took a hold of the steering wheel with one hand, showing off his muscular arm as he clenched his hand purposely because he knows Draco are watching him with lust while his other hand are closing the car door.
“Oh hell you won't ”, he quickly clamped his hand around the nosy hat’s mouth before the hat even got to finish shouting the word ‘Gryffindor’. First one all, he doesn’t want people to raise suspicion on why he was sorted into Gryffindor, second of all, Gryffindors are full of a bunch of reckless fools that he did not wish to associate with and lastly, Weasley. The thought made him shuddered in disgust.
While they were being romantic lovers on their honeymoon, Regulus was still amazed by his unborn sister. Smelling his Mummy’s scent mixing with his sister.
So, Draco should be a gift from them thanking him for saving them from wasting their miserable life in Azkaban and he’s going to claim it.
Where would the mirror be? Did he went into a different room than before? Is this not the same room? Why was he acting like the world was going to end? Is the mirror bringing him into insanity?
“NO PAPA! ONLY ME”, screamed Jamie as he looks at Harry with eyebrows scrunched into an angry frown, puffing his cheeks, it only makes him looks cuter than what he was trying show.
Draco turned his body to an easier position, straddling Harry. “I miss this so much,” whispered Harry hungrily as his rough hands squeezed the soft globe vigorously. Harry prepared him, fingers went up to his arse until it reached the knuckle, the second finger was added when Draco gave him the signal that he was ready for the second finger, followed by the third and the fourth.
He gave a last nod and walked out, ready to serve and ready to avoid the Potters.
He glanced at her and smiled softly, there’s nothing he needs to say. Mother stood up and came over to his side, without asking, Draco handed Scorpius to her, with his free arms, he shifted Adrian to his other arm, and reached out to Jamie, taking his small hand in his, moved him closer to him as he shifted himself on the bed so there’s a space for Jamie to lay down beside him.
Potter was talking to the centaur as Draco was trying grasped his mind on what just happened. Potter’s hand suddenly pulled him out of his thought as he watched the centaur lowered himself.
‘nghhh- Harry please… fuck me… I can’t take it anymore… please Harry’, begged Draco, Harry gave in and lined up his big length to Draco’s hole and pushed in.
Her comments make Iris laugh but the only reply she can give her is, “I see what I can do,” not in the ‘I see what I can do to break them up’ but in a ‘I see what I can do about the situation’ type of way.
For some stupid reason, he felt lonely once Dobby left, leaving no evidence of his present.
“No- nope. Absolutely not. I don’t even have a boyfriend,” he quickly denied the accusation but then he was weirded out, “Wait, how would you know I would most likely to have a boyfriend than a girlfriend?” He asked sceptically.
The mirror showed that they were a normal happy family. Amelia did not pass away from the world and Sirius was not a convicted criminal. They were happy, it’s like there’s no burden on their shoulders.
“I’m alright with it as long as I get to fuck you,” dropping his voice low, hands stroking up and down on Draco’s back until it reaches his plump arse. His big hands fit the soft globe of his dragon’s arse.
Through the night, Harry would help him with the babies whenever they suddenly woke up and cry, Jamie would help them too when he heard his baby brother's wails, when the babies interrupts his sleep and instead of being mad at them, Jamie rubbed his eyes a couple of time and went up to them to entertain the babies in some type of way only kids understand, although it drained his energy, he wouldn’t have it any other way.
Curling an arm around Jamie, he pulled him closer, singing a French lullaby. Harry’s arms are already wrapped around Draco’s waist.
He handed Draco to Remus and sat down, covered his face with his hands and no one spoke at the moment. The silence of the room makes it worse. He wished that this was a nightmare that he could just wake up from it.
‘Draco’, he called out to him calmly as his eyes looking at the cold bare wall, not looking at Severus.
As they were walking deeper and deeper into the forest, no sight of the other group ; with the cold air hanging around them, the rustling sound of the leaves on the ground as they stepped on it, moving their body forward into the body of the forest.
Harry thread his fingers through Draco’s luscious long blonde hair. Draco kissed Harry’s stubble beard, kissed him under the chin because he felt like it.
“Just get on with this.”, he murmured to himself as he gave himself a few words of encouragement. He squeezed himself among the crowd when he got pushed by some stranger because they were trying give way for the boy-who lived.
A beautiful woman with thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders came forward and held her hand to hold the newborn baby. She too was pregnant with a baby boy who will due next month. Sirius hands him to her and Draco little fingers wrapped around her middle length red hair.
“Thank you!” thanking his uber driver, already transferring the money to the driver’s account, closes the door with a loud bang, not caring that he was embarrassing himself as he cringed once the doors are closed with a loud bang.
Students from Slytherins and Gryffindor all shouted up at the same time, Draco’s broomstick shot up into his hand at once as he expected, the same goes to Cassie. Pansy’s broomstick rolled over to Blaise’s and knocked him off into the ground, they were all laughing with glee. Crabbe and Goyls’s broomstick didn’t even move, Theo’s broomstick stood up from the ground almost touching his hand.
The sound of apparition marks that Dobby was here, “What does young master Draco need?”, asked Dobby as he bow down his head to him, hiding his hands away from Draco’s eyes.
Professor Flitwick end the poem with a bow and a confetti popped off in the air on Potter’s head. He handed the letter to Potter, Potter took the letter unwillingly added with his embarrassed red face. It was the greatest sight that he had ever encountered of him.
He brings his nipples to their mouths, once they felt something against their small lips, with closed eyes, they quickly latched on it, pulling the heavy milk out of him. Once they started sucking, he let out a relieved sigh.
Dobby, as usually leave him alone to have some family time with his mom. They talked- he talked but he hopes his mother was listening to him somewhere.
‘mmm so romantic’.
Harry moved his one finger attentively, one finger turns into two, curling his fingers inside of his dragon. He can’t wait to be inside him.
Draco laughed quietly so that he didn’t wake his husband up. His husband has been up all night for an emergency pack meeting. Harry has been the leader of the Potter’s pack since he reached the age of adulthood. Harry is a fair and fierce leader that every member of the pack respects him fully.
“I know you are going after the stone and the person behind it was Quirrell. I know because there’s one time I sneaked out at night, I heard him talking to someone without stuttering, so whenever I spoke to him the next time, I would stuttered and one day he can’t take it anymore, he lectured me without his stutter. So whatever you do Gryffindorks, Good luck”, explained Draco and he turned his back around, without waiting for them, or even looking at their shock expressions.
Seeing the disheveled look on his girlfriend, tugged his heart into darkness. He can’t stand seeing her in pain and he will do anything to make it better even at the cost of his balls.
She promised the word as she looked into her dazzling grey eyes, a few frustrated tears were leaking out of it, Iris quickly helped her wiping it away. Celestial hides her face away into Iris’s chest. The soft thumping of her heart forced her into a dreamland.
‘I-’, but was cut off from the sound of teacher’s footsteps barging in the room. Oh no he knows they all are going to be in trouble just by the furious look on Professor McGonagall with Severus and Quirrell behind her.
They are lost in their own world with the stars and the moon watching them.
She stormed back into the common room with clothes in her hand. He saw a green mini skirts in her hand and a white cropped top, a few chain and hair tie.
He can’t explain how much that pleases him.
While waiting for the train to reach the destination, they talked about what house they would be in, Draco sits back and just committed to their conversation, he too would make a joke about something that they were talking about.
“Did I heard something about dragon, Potter and friends?”, asked Draco innocently snickering at their petrified looking faces.
He wanted hissed back but didn't want to act like an idiot in the middle of the common room, so he just gave the cat a slightly less hurtful hex to let her know her place. The cat scrambled out of the way and Draco smirked his way to his shared room with Blaise and Theo.
Harry then trailed his hands down to Draco’s arse, peeling the arse cheeks apart and shoved two fingers in, maneuvered his fingers around his tight arsehole.
“I think they already know,” she flirtily murmure into her ear.
Harry pulled out his phone from his pocket, handed out his phone to him, “Give me your number so we can set a date,” said Harry somehow giddily.
“That’s the Draco constellation. It was easier to find because they are visible all year along but hard at the same time because the stars are not very bright. Besides, it was one of the best constellations out there,” adding a little bit of cockiness to his voice and chuckling when he found himself ridiculous.
When he walked inside the room, Draco was already aware that his husband was not in bed with him so when he walked in with their son in his arms, he was confused but didn’t ask for explanation as his son jumped on him once Harry put him down on the bed.
While he was running around for his robe, he remembered that he only unshrink his pajamas, he screamed. “Fuck, Draco what now?” asked Blaise but Draco ignored him. Draco enlarged his robe and put it on and grabbed his tiny Potion book, put it in his bag and slung it over his shoulder, scrambled out of Slytherin common room with Blaise and Theo trailing behind him.
Tongue jabbing and invading his hole, the tongue went deeper inside of him and sucked hard that his cheeks were sucked.
“I should have not let you wear this dress, it makes all the men checking you out for too long.”
The amount of times Draco has to hold Dobby by his ragged clothes from punishing himself by being an unfaithful house-elf to the head of the house everytime he disappears from the manor just exhausts him. He had to threaten Dobby that if he punished himself without Father’s order again, he would burn the stack of magazines he found under his bed and that stopped him for a while.
‘Here you go baby’, as he handed the drink to him, he laid his back against Harry’s chest, Harry sneaked one arm around his waist. When he turned back to Goldstein, he was already gone.
“But I think the person I fancy is still oblivious to my feelings because she still hasn't made any move yet or maybe I should kiss her right here right now to make her realise who I’m talking about, right?’
When he stepped out of the bathroom as he dried off, he felt strong arm slither around his waist and a hot breathe on his neck, pulling him closer to the person’s hard chest. He turned his head to look at the intruder and not to his surprise, it was Potter.
The best part of the day is when his mighty hand hit Weasley’s jaws and got a bruised out of it but the worst part is when he got a black eye and it was really hurt and hard to see.
“True but I’m so grateful to walk into your Mother’s restaurant two years ago, it was like love at first sight.” confessed Harry.
“If you tell me Dobby, I would be cautious, I would help you, you know I would.”, said Draco slowly and patiently, he needs to gain Dobby’s trust because he was scared that Draco would tell father on him.
Besides, she always favours his brother - Regulus Black more instead of him and she told him that their feelings towards each other are mutual.
“Oh no, I’m not going to just let you walk alone to your place. It’s late.” he said, standing his ground.
With Potter’s tongue exploring his mouth, he felt he’s on cloud nine, a muggle idiom which he learned in Muggle Studies. The hand that was caressing Potter’s hair fell to his shoulders and down to Potter’s waist. He pulled Potter’s shirt off of him, releasing him from Potter’s mouth, Potter comply without any protest. Potter then did the same to him by pulling the towel that was wrapped around him off, leaving him fully naked while Potter still in his trouser.
“Come in”, instructs a gruff confident voice from inside of the room, they could barely hear the low voice but with enough practice, they could hear it from miles away.
“Well, well, well - Arthur Weasley.” said father as he rests his hand on his shoulder, Draco was trying to sneak out of the way but the grip on his shoulder makes him stay where he stood. It hurts but he can’t show it.
He swear, as each day past by, Dobby’s behaviour be getting weird and weirder, he knows that Dobby disappear in the middle of the night someday, and what makes him frustrated even more is that Dobby was still not telling him.
“How are those black eye from weeks ago? Still remember the feeling of my fist connected to yours?”, said Weasley biting back.
The hand on his thigh stopped moving but still rest there. He can’t believe that Potter was such a jealous type.
“I’ll talk to you later, okay baby? I love you forever,” kissing him on his red cheeks and standing up, he kissed Harry on his lips, connecting his lips with his, muttering into the kiss.
When he arrived at his room. He search for his phone since he never bring his phone with near except going to Muggle Studies. He actually forgot where he put his phone at so he crouch down to search under his bed, on top of his drawer but find nothing.
“It's true what the Astronomer said, Draco is the best constellation out there.” compliment Harry at Draco through the constellation. He should have known his boyfriend was this cheesy and he loves him nonetheless.
These past few days, Draco has been sobbing nonstop, he knew that he couldn't feel his father’s presence. He just wants to be held by his father. Whenever Draco cried, Cassiopeia was always there for him, as if she knew that her cousin needed comfort. Narcissa had tried everything from holding him to rocking him to sleep but nothing works. When Narcissa puts Cassiopeia beside him, he stops crying and his eyes get heavier and heavier until he falls asleep.
Potter swiped his lower lip asking permission to enter his mouth, Draco opened his mouth willingly only for him.
She stuck out her tongue, looking at Harry standing so he can go and clean up the plate, before that, he takes a heating pad and lays it on her stomach.
“Dobby, before I burn your Harry Potter collection, better appear right this instead! DOBBY!”
It’s true what people said, human will never feel enough ; never have enough and probably never will.
‘No, Draco let me kick his Gryffindor’s arse,’ said Blaise while trying to pull his arm away from Draco but he held his arm tightly. He looked back and saw that Potter looked at him with despair in his eyes and he doesn’t know why.
‘So, what do you guys know about Amortentia’, asked Slughorn. A lot of students raised up their hand especially Granger. Slughorn looked at their student one by one and decides to point his finger at Goldstein to answer the question.
“Cute kid you got here,” said the stranger as he waves his hand at Jamie but was ignored because Jamie hates people he don’t know. Draco just nodded his head unenthused and went back to read the back of the product.
“Fuck you, Draco”, murmured Cassie under her breath as she smiled, scared that father heard her using the word of profanity, Draco snickered as he pushed the door opened, the bell that hang on the door clanged indicating that they have a customer.
Father’s study room provide a couch for them to sit while there is a big cushion facing the couch. The room was surrounded with shelves full of books, on the wall, there is a hanging of their family portrait taken from three year ago before they went to Hogwarts.
He slicked one finger in, working his way through Draco’s hole, watching Draco’s face expression careful. Draco begged him to put more fingers in, he complied while his other hand wrapped on his waist.
Harry was enjoying teasing his husband so he went up to his ears and whispered, “Not yet my baby dragon”, and kissed his flushed red cheeks repeatedly. Harry then lifts Draco’s body up and turn his body facing the telly, Draco’s back hits his hard toned muscular chest and shoved his big cock back in Draco.
‘ That’s enough, Mr Weasley. Potter, follow me now.’
“Are you all done?”, asked Draco to both of them because they already spent a long time dressing Jamie. Harry nodded his head followed by Jamie when he saw his father nodding. “Do you want me to carry Jamie, Harry?”, asked Draco concerned because he don’t want to trouble his husband.
“Done,” said father at the counter. “Come, Cassiopeia, Draco!”, his hand stop midway, he looked back at his father and Cassie near the door, and looked back in front of him, he wanted to reach open the cabinet door but-
‘I’m sorry, okay. Potter always gets on my nerve’, Draco apologised as they were now far away from the Hall, walking outside to Black Lake. Draco thought to himself that it was not a good idea to be outside because of the heavy snow but he didn’t say anything. He was waiting for Cassie’s reply.
‘I don’t care and anyways I got a lot of attention on that app especially using Draco and sometimes you’, said Pansy as she swipe up and down on her phone screen.
He don’t even realised the boy-who lived was in the bookstore too, he looked at him and their eyes met for a few second before the flash of the camera blinding his emerald eyes.
“Of course I avoided you, it was the least I could do for making your life hell for a few years back”, said Draco, fingers smoothly stroking Harry’s cheeks. Meanwhile Harry’s hand travelled to his chest, grabbing it from behind, squeezing his boobs a couple of times as Draco moaned his name softly.
“ I don’t care.”, said Draco without giving him an explanation why because he knows why, he still cared about it sometimes. Potter was looking at him weirdly as their legs kept on walking into the heart of the forest.
‘ Shut up, Malfoy’, snapped a dark brown-skinned girl who had long black hair. He didn’t even know her but she knows his name, maybe he is quite a looker for the girls.
“You are a big brother now, Jamie.”
“Huh?” he looked up, “Yeah I’m fine.”
“Only work a quarter time job when I’m not busy with uni work, helping Mother here and there. Tell me when you guys are ready to order,” eyes scanning through the family until it rests on his old time crush who was looking at him stunned for some reason.
Nine years have passed since the dreadful event. Life goes on for the Malfoy's, Draco was loved by the people in the house. He was cheerful to the people that he was familiar with, just like his mom and he loves playing pranks on people in the house or to his friends, just like his dad. His hair is both like his biological parents combined, blonde from the root to the tip but a streak of black hair. He too has wavy hair just like his dad.
He closes the door behind him, walked to his bed and dragged the curtain close. He slumped down on his bed, took out the letter from the book and read it all over again for confirmation, eyes followed the words the letter contained.
‘Again? With the tik tok? I think you are addicted Pans’, said Blaise while wiping away the beverage that leaked out of the corner of his mouth with his hand.
“Sorry, sorry- stop,” he laughed loudly when Harry started to tickle him, his laugh echo through the empty lift.
He took out the ring and slipped into Draco’s finger, it was perfect.
“The Malfoy - their first born child is always a male but what a frightening news he got when the private Healer who helped Mother to give birth announced that it was a girl instead. I heard - Mother and Father always fought about it.”
Draco are on his knees, shoved his camera in his pocket, cupping Potter’s face as to look at him, the cloaked figure are coming nearer as the second passed.
‘Bloody hell, the hat could read my mind, shit shit shit, not just this hat is dirty but it is also a nutter’, he thought to himself and chuckled.
Harry Potter looks at both of them silently. Draco doesn’t know what to make up for this boy.
The hat nodded continuously, Draco couldn't believe that he could scare a centuries old hat, He was impressed with himself. He puts the hat back on his hat and the hat shouts Slytherin doubtlessly.
Without a second thought, he embraced his son tightly, wishing he could take away his suffering. “What’s wrong, Jamie?” he asked worriedly, wiping away the tears streaming out of his eyes.
As they were walking out of the house, Draco asked Harry if they are going to apparate to the grocery shop or Harry driving them there. “Driving is better, Jamie are going to get apparation sick since he was not use to it. Besides, he could watch the scenery on the way,” said Harry.
Professor Snape has been treating students that are not Slytherins poorly, especially Potter and the Longbottom kid with disgust although he doesn't know why, Draco has been finding an idea to torment the Weasley because he still doesn’t like his ugly face. Transfiguration is an easy subject and Professor McGonagall has taken a liking to him on his first lesson with her.
His curiosity took over and he stepped closer to the object, the closer he went, the clearer he could see that the object was a mirror, a huge magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.
When the first of April came, he waited patiently at the Great Hall, sitting on the Slytherin table as he filled his plate with light food, he can’t wait to observe his brilliant work he didn’t get the credit for. With his picture moving object ready to record the whole situation, secretly hiding the camera from everyone else’s eyes except his.
‘You really should not say that! You guys are so mean’, murmured Cassie angrily under her breath, only the people near her could hear her.
“Goodnight Papa”, replied Jamie as his eyes are slowly dropping but his mouth are still firmly latched onto his nipple with his hands hugging his lion plushy.
He avoids eye contact with Potter and leaves the compartment with Cassie in front of him. They walked through the deserted and narrow hallway until they came to a stop on compartment full of Pureblood children that they knew.
The loud sound of the music echo through the common room, he saw a lot of people dancing. Draco looked around for Pansy and Blaise, saw that they were with their plus one. Pansy was dancing with Granger while holding a drink in her hand.
‘So how do we do this?’, asked Potter as he set down the ingredients on the table. Draco moved closer to Potter because it was easier to instruct Potter.
Draco was going to Apparate with Mother while Cassie was going with Father, Father and Cassie had already Apparate to King Cross.
“Yeah, thanks.”
As he keeps on talking, Draco just wish he could use a spell to shut his mouth but he don’t want to be in another detention because he cast a spell on someone students shouldn’t but the temptation is strong.
When it was time to board the train, he hugged his Mother again tightly and nodded his head to his Father, and walked off to board the train, Cassie followed behind.
Draco give a kitten licked on Harry’s finger that was closed to his mouth, “Don’t care, I want to be a Potter anyways.”
Draco sits beside the black haired boy while Cassie sits beside the Ginger head. All of them were silent until Cassie started the conversation. While Cassie was talking, Draco noticed that the ginger head was glancing at them weirdly, the boy pursed his lips.
At Halloween night, while he was enjoying the Halloween feast, Quirrell came rushing into the Hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table and gasped, ‘Troll- in the dungeons- thought you ought to know.’ He then sank to the floor and lied there fainting.
“Hi Mrs Potter,” greeted Draco shyly, he was still shy around Harry’s parents and he doesn’t know why, maybe it’s the fact that he was not a social type of person.
‘He thinks this door is locked,’ Potter whispered. ‘I think we’ll be OK- get off, Neville! For him has been tugging Potter’s on the sleeves of the dressing gown.
He gave back the helmet to Harry and Harry rested it on the seat while he climbed down too. He doesn’t know why.
She looks at her best friend since first year weirdly, arching an eyebrow silently questioning her. “You always study together,” was all she said, eyes trailing down on the word of the book she just opened.
“I’ll be back, love you and take a rest.”
“Yes, I saw one.” said Harry, looking attentively at the stars, not losing focus because if look away, the image would be gone.
‘But is that really where you belong, Draco Black?’ The hat questioned him again.
While waiting, his finger scrolling through Instagram, he checked that there’s some account request to follow him. Usually he would deny or just ignore it but when he checked the user, it was Harry fucking Potter.
Cassie walks inside and sits beside him at the edge of the bed, her presence brings him comfort. They sat there silently for a while. She then handed him the photograph of his family.
“Can we like fasten the process because I want the fucking babies out of me right this instant,” said Draco as the pain intensifies.
It’s like they understood each other without words getting thrown out.
Draco could still hear them as he forgot to cancel the spell, with a swish of his wand, he could no more hear their conversation.
When Harry realised what he meant, his legs ran quick and chased after him, although he was holding the basket, he still could run faster and outrun Draco.
’No, let’s just go because you are going to make a scene,’ Draco said while dragging Blaise to the Great Hall with Pansy and Cassiopeia trailing behind them. ‘Besides, we could play a prank on Weasley,’ Draco continues while smirking with a hidden agenda behind those mouths of his.
When she finally decided to step away, Draco was still standing at the end of the bed, curiously looking around the room waiting for Weasley to acknowledge him.
“You still have 45 minutes to walk out and freshen up before you meet him, if you want to, which you don’t have to,” said Draco as he looked down on his watch around his wrist.
*TWACK* first slap, *TWACK* second slap* and the number goes on.
They walked out of the shop and their mother addressed them to go to the Madam Malkin's robe shop to be fitted for their school robes while their mother goes to buy their books so they can save some time.
A tiny part of him wanted Potter to get in trouble, well a big part of him actually but he do want to roam the castle instead of trailing for Potter and friends, get them in trouble.
He hung up the phone call and took the helmet from Harry’s waiting hand, their hands slightly brushing against each other. His cheeks flushed, when his brother did that in the restaurant, he felt nothing but when it was Harry, he felt all sorts of giddy feelings.
“This is what I get after nine months of carrying you and ten hours of torture in labor?” shaking his head affectionately at his boy.
“I thought that if I can make him proud, he would at least give me a pat on the back or something.”
Now he was anxious since he don’t know what tactic she going to use against him. For a whole day, Draco was being extra nice to her but she stills shook him off saying that anything that he do won’t made her change her mind unless he do tik tok with her.
No one seems to suspect anything - yet
With the plate on his hand, Draco scooped the food with the spoon and bring it to Harry’s mouth, he open his mouth willingly and Draco shoved the food in as Harry’s hand went to his boobs.
‘Harry- nghh I’m ready Harry’, he begged him but when he feel those fingers still in his hole. He heard chuckled coming from Potter’s mouth. He half screamed at him with desperation.
He had finally lost his mind, he was not going in the forest, there was a reason why it called forbidden in the first place.
Granger was looking somewhere with a binocular and pointed her fingers towards the teacher’s stand. He averted his gaze to the teacher’s stand and saw Severus was chanting furiously under his breath as he locked his eyes at Potter.
Sirius held his wife and hugged her, whispering words of love in her ear. She smiles at him and closes her eyes. She was grateful for everything in her life. For giving her a caring and loving husband, for giving her loyal friends and for giving life to her little dragon, her Draco.
She blurted out the first thing in her mind to not further out her embarrassment at getting caught admiring Celestial's face.
‘Of course I’m romantic, I got you here by my side, I can do whatever I want to you as I please and I never intent to let you go’.
Harry’s body gave up on him and fell on top of Draco, while Draco’s knees gave up on him, his body smothering Draco’s, his body pin Draco’s to the bed, not intending to detach from him yet, he needs to feel his soft pliant body against his.
Harry took a seat at the left side while he took the place in front of Harry with Jamie sitting on his right side because he is a mama’s boy.
“Besides we can’t sneak out out of curfew but we can have a detention in a forest? What type of dungshit is this?”, said Draco as he was spitting out facts. “The school system are rigged.”
“Harry- don’t stop~,” he moaned and sank his teeth into Harry’s shoulder. “Who said I’m going to stop,” said Harry cocky just by the tone of his voice, he doesn’t have to look up to know that Harry has smugness on his face.
‘Not arguing, I hope, boys?’ he squeaked.
When he was finally done searching for all of the stupid books, the books was so heavy in his arms because he has to double the fucking books, he was holding sixteen books in total that he couldn’t lifts all of the books up, but thank Merlin his Blaise was kind enough to help him with that while Cassie was looking at him with amusement.
‘You really should stop with bullying Neville. He did nothing to be in your bad list, why should you bother him? Can’t you let him stay in the castle with peace’, said Cassie.
Draco just shrugged his shoulders and went back to his books searching, there were only few books left he have to find.
Beside him, Granger was wearing a blue robe while Weasley was wearing a Hufflepuff coloured robe. Both of them looked weird wearing that colour but Potter though, he was speechless, he can’t even describe what a great impact he had on Draco right now.
He would have to just ignore it from now until he was certain that it was no accident.
Harry then rested his palm on Draco’s arse, nails digging into the soft flesh skin leaving red scratch marks as he watched Draco’s facial expression. Draco was clearly enjoying it but at the same time hoping the cock in his arse just fucking move already.
“You shall see,” said Mother.
“Fuck-”, said Harry as his muscular arms lifts Draco off of him, he then slips his arms under Draco, sat up, flicked his hand, wandlessly turning off the light and the telly and carry him to their bedroom.
When the lesson ended, he waited outside with Blaise for Cassiopeia and Pansy, Theo already walked away with Crabbe and Goyle to torment someone. While they were waiting, he saw Weasley and Potter stepping out of the classroom, he then walked slowly towards them and purposely slammed his shoulder with Weasley’s and knocked his belongings down to the floor, he then put his hands up and half-heartedly  apologized while putting on a smirked on his face, then he turned around and walked back to Blaise.
“The Mediwitches are cleaning and checking them up right now. You should sleep dragon and I’m going to sent a Patronus to our family members telling them you have safely gave birthed, you will see our children when you wake up but right now, please rest okay, Draco?” said Harry, brushing his hair away from his face, lingering at his pink tinted cheeks, Draco bobbed his head up and down and closes his eyes again.
She wiggles out of the bed and quietly sneaks out of Eighth Year’s girl dormitories she shared with Hermione and two other girls names she couldn’t care less, slowly closing the door behind her to not make a creaking noise.
They ripped through the tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came near their Charms classroom, which he knew was miles away from the trophy room.
‘I don’t know which is worst, Pans or the troll, both smell the same but at least you smell better’, whispered Blaise to them. Pansy shoved his arm aggressively that made him almost tumble.
Draco closes his eyes and felt the peace atmosphere around him while his hand are stroking Jamie’s messy black hair repeatedly. The same type of messy hair he stroked even before Jamie was born.
He hopes that Draco has the time to do his homework since he gave a lot to his class, just because he was pissed off that one Ravenclaw ; Draco’s classmate touches his waist when he knows he shouldn’t be touching what’s not his.
He called them thugs for some stupid reason, he’s not an open-minded person.
Potter stretches his hand to open the drawer while he was still on top of him and reach for the lube. He brought the lube and open the cap, poured a handful in his hand, , spreading the cool gel around the tip of his penis and down the shaft, his hand are moving up and down continuously.
“You are the best boy Daddy could ever find.” He knows he should stop, stop with all of this because Draco is just 16 years old who has a whole future in front of him but the thought of another cock that’s not his inside of this beautiful body makes him see red.
The healer told him to get ready to push again for their second baby, Draco screams and screams, tears bursting out of his eyes, his forehead are wet from sweat, Harry was beside him again and grabbed his hand, kissing his temple as he murmured word of encouragement, he helped Draco wiped the sweat on his forehead.
Since that day, he would always watched someone’s eyes closely but secretly without them knowing.
One day, Draco finally decided he had enough of Dobby’s odd behaviour. He called Dobby to his room and when the elf appeared, his legs and his hands are burned, swelling and red, it was a second degree burn as Draco analyzing the burn from a far, afraid of touching Dobby that may cause him hurt even more. Draco was so shocked because father would never tortured Dobby this worse before.
When the situation has calmed down, their pack is stronger and protected, forming allies from every pack they can. He won’t forget the look Harry gave him when Draco told Harry that he was ready to have children of their own.
His grey eyes grow with years trained on his babies, his beautiful baby boys squirming on the pillow. His back was hit against the headboard of the bed, closing his eyes as the quiet atmosphere slowly took over the room.
Harry was awakened by the sound of his wand buzzing, it came from Jamie’s room, he spelled the room so that whenever Jamie has trouble with his sleep, the wand would buzz to alert him and right now, the wand was buzzing loudly.
“Oh and if you decide to stay the night, you can stay in the room in front of Celestial’s, I know what it feels like to be a teenager,” and with a wink, she walks out of the room, pulling her husband who disapproves of the whole idea of them.
“Can’t be too excited now can we?”, said Harry, voice are hoarse. “I will take care of you but later because right now, I just need to be inside of you for hours. Will you let me, baby?”, asked Harry.
Draco bite his lips really hard, trying not to scream in fear as one hand holding Potter’s while the other was recording the whole thing without him realizing that he was still recording.
He hopes that Potter was oblivious so he won’t know Draco smell him on the Amortentia but since the end of the war, Potter was anything but oblivious, He did gained quite a few of common sense.
He closed the door with a creak, reminding him of his babies in the room, he walked towards them, picked them up and placed them in the twin size baby crib he inserted in his room. After that, he sat himself down at the edge of the bed, rubbing his whole face, not wanting to cry.
When Cassie was done paying for the books, Draco was confused because there is no single book in her hand that he have to ask her about it. “Where’s the books?”, asked Draco as he scrunched his eyebrows.
“Yes, your last name is Black but we decided to use Malfoy until Sirius was out of Azkaban so you still are Draco Malfoy when you go to Hogwarts and only a few people know about your parent’s marriage. Sirius went to Azkaban because of the things that he did in the newspaper that you just read and no, he didn’t betray the Potters so please don’t think badly of him, he went for Peter Pettigrew who was the one that betrayed them and Sirius wanted revenge.”
They looked into each other’s eyes and moments later, their lips connected as Harry bent his head down since he was still taller than him although both of them were sitting.
They came to a stop when a big giant called for the first year. The big giant told them that they have to ride a boat to cross a lake, so that the older year could arrive first for the sorting of the first year.
