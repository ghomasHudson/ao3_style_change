Harry is starting to realize that's true. Despite six years of interactions at Hogwarts, most of them awful, Harry really doesn't know that much about Malfoy. He didn't know Malfoy likes to make buckwheat biscuits and obsesses over cabbage. He didn't know Malfoy has been writing to Luna and Hagrid. He didn't know Malfoy has a little dog that obviously loves him.
The elves kept the place pretty tidy, but Draco decided it was best to hide the fizzy pumpkin juice and the large box of cauldron cakes in his pantry, just to be on the safe side. He didn’t want Harry judging him on his cravings, and quoting from his stupid baby book.
Harry Floos home an indeterminate amount of time later with kiss swollen lips and a stupid smile he's trying to hide.
“How can you be so fucking sexy?” Harry demanded; his forehead hot where it pressed against Draco’s skin.
There's a palpable calm in the kitchen despite the activity. Malfoy moves around the kitchen in an almost lazy way, the same way he handles a broom, Harry thinks, before catching himself watching Malfoy again and pulling a cookbook over instead.
fibs. In fact,” he said, brightening to the topic, “the day after tomorrow, I’ve got three property visits lined up. The bump and I are planning to move into a new home, somewhere that’s a bit more newborn-friendly. Somewhere without Potter.”
“I’m about done,” Mr Weasley – Arthur – said, smoothing out the tea-towel, slow and deliberate in his movements. “Shall we have a brew, while we wait for the rest of the gang to return? They’ve all piled into the field across the way; it's charmed with a Notice-Me-Not so the Muggles can’t see the broomsticks. Stick the kettle on.”
Taking their leave, Harry and he stepped into the fireplace. Harry took his hand, and with his other, he took a pinch of the Floo powder from the cup beside the hearth.
Malfoy stirs about an hour after that, but only to curl up in a different position. Harry waits all day until the Healer comes back at seventeen with the news. The Healer casts a R
With a wave of his wand, Draco magicked any hidden crumbs from his shirt front, and turned his face to Harry. “You still haven’t answered my first question though. Why are you here? I didn’t think you even wanted children.”
Malfoy adds mayonnaise to the bowl with the yolks and pushes it toward Harry to mix. Harry does, watching Malfoy's slender hands finely dicing some celery. He's so confident with the knife, his fingers curved just so on the celery. Harry might have to admit that Malfoy's success in potions was down to more than just Snape's favoritism.
“Braxton-hicks,” Harry said, never pausing with his touches. “Your uterus is relaxing and contracting. It’s really normal, Draco, promise. I read about them in my book,” he explained, his palm coming to rest on Draco’s nape. It felt so warm, and solid, and safe that Draco couldn’t help but melt into it. “Was your nightmare a bad one?”
Meeting him at the entrance to the lounge, Harry took the plates off Draco before placing them tidily on the table.
He walks through the Muggle front of the shop through the door with the swirling cloudy barrier and gets caressed by the same creeping vines as last time, only there's no Malfoy to laugh at the look on Harry's face. He wanders the long aisles, looking at the blooms miserably and feeling there's no way he'll be able to put together a bouquet the way Malfoy can.
The fluster and panic dissipated from Harry’s face and Draco sighed. Of course, the wand was nowhere to be seen. “I ran as soon as I heard you shout,” Harry admitted. “You sounded so upset that I just made for the stairs. What is it, Draco? A broken fastener? A lost button? Let me fix it.” Draco felt his heart sink as Harry took out his own wand, looking appallingly hopeful. “I’m a dab hand at Tailoring Charms,” Harry coaxed. Merlin, but why was he cursed with such a do-gooder for a co-parent? There wasn't any keeping secrets from Harry Potter.
since you and I were last in acquaintance. Please do make the effort, Draco, for one is beginning to feel your absence rather keenly.'
Draco bit back a half-smile at that. He remembered his passionate, heartbroken tears when Father had told him, aged six, of his decided bond with Astoria Greengrass. He’d sobbed, and begged to be allowed to bond with playmate Blaise Zabini instead, so the two of them could have sleepovers every night, and play on their broomsticks. Father hadn’t understood Draco then, and he expected that Lucius would have been even more appalled now.
Malfoy happens to walk in at that moment. "Oh yes, Potter," he says, coming around to Harry's back and draping his arms over Harry's shoulders. "It must be so difficult for you to Floo over and eat cake every day."
“Harry,” Draco said, unable to keep the feeling from his voice, “I’ve read the article. I’m- I’m hardly sure of what to say. All those personal things that you told the
Harry spends all afternoon holding Malfoy close. Sometimes he dozes a little himself, sometimes he stares at the unicorn painting trying to figure out the bizarre turns his life has taken, where he is somehow no longer the person responsible for catching dark wizards and instead spends all his time snuggling Draco Malfoy.
Harry, in his immutable, bull-headed Gryffindor manner, had decided that there wouldn’t be any more malicious articles about the pair of them published, and he’d done it in blazing, uncompromising style. What Harry had told Cuffe about the Dursleys, about his raw loneliness after the war, and about his Quidditch was far more private than anything else Harry had ever told the newspapers. Tears wet Draco’s cheeks, and they fell across the
Mrs. Weasley is bustling around the kitchen clearing plates while Mr. Weasley does the washing up and the rest of them are groaning over their full bellies at the table.
Draco’s prick was so full, and aching, and he could feel it leaking against the cover of the bedsheets. He didn’t want to touch himself though, for he knew he’d ejaculate within a couple of tugs. Harry was a feast for his every sense, and Draco was famished and randy; determined to indulge for as long as he possibly could. He pressed back into Harry, lifting his leg as high as he could, letting Harry move even more deeply inside of him.
Malfoy lowers the last egg into the pot and sets a timer, the old fashioned kind that clicks softly. Harry wonders why he doesn't use his wand for any of these tasks and is about to ask when Malfoy leans over one of the cookbooks, crossing his arms on the counter top, his arse sticking out. Just, bending over, in those trousers, right in front of Harry's wheaties. Harry can feel his cheeks warm; he can't believe he's checking out Malfoy's bum.
"And just because I'm still unlearning feeling like a piece of shit doesn't mean you were right about anything."
"Those are his eggs, Potter. Laid by his chickens. Chickens I'm fairly certain he loves like human children."
Harry pushed his other arm between Draco’s neck and the mattress so that Draco had something to rest his head on. Draco reached back, and gripped Harry’s hip, pulling the other wizard closer. His chest was tight, his vision was blurry, and he turned his head, catching Harry’s lips with his own. Draco choked on his breath the first time that Harry got it right and his prick glided over Draco’s prostate. Maybe it was all the pregnancy hormones, but Draco couldn’t remember ever feeling this sensitive ever before. His whole body was an erogenous zone, and Draco fought hard not to go to pieces with every thrust.
Draco didn’t like the look of concern on his mate’s face. Fuck, but he regretted telling Goyle about Harry. Draco shouldn’t have inflicted that pathetic little tale on anyone.
The two of them got to their feet, and followed the Mediwitch to a different room from before. This was painted a very pale mauve, and Harry and he were shown to comfortable seats in front of an imposing desk. Mediwitch Hayes sat down before them and spent a moment perusing her notes before she looked up at them both.
, and squeezing his eyes shut. When he opened them, the peacock was there, shiny and magical. Perhaps it was a little blurrier around the edges than usual, but that didn’t matter. In for a Sickle, in for a Galleon. Draco gave his wand a decisive swish and sent the peacock on his way.
Harry tells Ron and Hermione what Neville told him about the things Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle did to him when they were younger. And that Neville thought Harry "of all people" should understand.
To Draco’s surprise, Harry didn’t say Half-Moon Place. Instead, he said Grimmauld Place. Draco winced. Floo travel left him feeling like he’d been hit with a Jelly-Brain Jinx at the best of times, and now he would have to endure twice the journey. After a few moments of being flung and twisted through London’s Floo network, the lounge of Grimmauld opened up before them.
"Git. He was finally warming up to me. It's taken fourteen years. Progress you ruined in one fell swoop."
For once in his life, Draco was lost for words. His heart seemed to have taken up residence in his throat, and all he could manage was a nod of his head.
"Shite! I forgot the rock cakes! And they'll be here in half an hour and I still need to set the table."
He shakes the ridiculous idea away and moves on with his inspection. For a moment, he debates whether or not this is the right course of action. Whether or not he should be rifling through people’s belongings, secretly invading their lives,
Harry chokes a little, stifles a cough. Draco sounds like his Malfoy, the one back in his world, the one that Harry knows. Sounds so much like him that Harry wants to bolt from that chair and leave the room, heart beating so loud he’s convinced everyone in the room can hear it.
"I don't know." Harry tries to think of the things Luna and Hagrid and even Ron and Hermione have said about Malfoy, the things they say to Harry when Harry is objecting to Malfoy, but his mind is blank. He warned Ron in the days leading up to the party that it would be a disaster, but he didn't think exactly how. This is how, and Harry doesn't know what to do.
"Nothing really. I didn't know what to say. What would you have said? I mean, he did bully us for years. He was awful."
As he'd eaten it, Draco had felt entirely guilt-ridden. According to the baby books that Pans had sent over his baby was currently banana-sized, which was comical, considering how rotund he looked in the mirror. Then Draco had made the fatal error of skipping ahead to the end of the book. The final fruit had been a pumpkin, the notion of which had left him reeling. That he, a wizard of standard size, was able to grow a whole pumpkin-sized person felt fantastical, and rather a lot like magic.
amongst pure-bloods to have French elves. And my many failures as the Malfoy heir were served as often as the coq au vin. And also—"
That was that. Harry turned, and Apparated away. Draco watched the last of the twirling green magic vanish and fought the urge to dash his teacup against the wall. It was his mother’s, part of a collection that Walburga Black had given her upon marriage, and he doubted that the antique would fix with a simple Reparo.
“I’m Victoire,” she announced, very formally, her voice carrying the smallest hint of a French accent, “and I heard what Harry said. You’re having a baby. I already thought that you were, because your tummy looks like my Aunty Felice’s, and she’s having a baby too. Is it true what the newspaper lady said? Are you Harry’s boyfriend?” she asked, entirely innocently.
Draco has never cooked with rhubarb before but he's been eyeing a rhubarb and frangípane crumble in one of his cookbooks for going on six months. He'll serve it over creamy vanilla yogurt with a few of the strawberries for a garnish. He fetches some almonds from Harry's pantry and gets to work.
Malfoy's standing over him, framed by the sun and holding a bottle with two wine glasses. "Are you hungry?"
Harry doesn't know what to say, it's hard to regret something you don't remember doing. "I don't know," Harry says, recalling he's said 'I don't know' in reference to Malfoy a lot lately. "Neville was upset with me."
"No, more like, some of the stuff you grow up with, that you really believe, you don't even really think about. Like me and house-elves."
“Imagine! Getting called to come fetch you because of something like this! It’s ridiculous,” Draco continues.
“Alright lovely,” she said. “Untuck your shirt please, and I’ll take a few measurements. Let’s see what we can do for you.”
The elves enchanted the fortune cookies to be accurate, and they’d come true on a startling number of occasions. Snapping his open, Draco couldn’t say he was surprised at all by the fortune that he’d been given.
Ron stands up and puts his hands on Harry's shoulders, looking him in the eye. "Mate, you kissed Malfoy."
The kitchen is dark and Malfoy starts lighting candles. Of course an old wizarding family like the Malfoys don't have electricity but Harry is still a little surprised by the candlelight. The kitchen is filled with fluttery light and Malfoy looks less pale under the warm light. Sort of golden. Harry swallows hard.
Harry had been on his own, self-appointed campaign to educate Draco on everything Muggle in recent weeks, and he had often brought music over.
Draco awoke then, his skin slick with sweat and the air tight in lungs that didn’t seem to want to function. Panicking, he pushed a hand beneath his tee-shirt, his palm finding the reassuring swell of his baby. Thank Merlin, but she was still there, and still exactly as safe as she’d always been. Unsurprisingly she was wide awake, wriggling a little, and pressing down into his hips.
No doubt the daft prat had been reading his precious book again, and Draco wondered what his fabulous advice would be today. Perhaps Harry would be informing Draco that Apparition was no longer advisable, or that craving banana and cloudberry pudding – just like the elves used to make – was entirely normal.
"You were the one who was all, 'must be hard to have Lucius as a father,' and 'what's the big deal Harry? he only tried to kill us.'"
lube from the chest of drawers beside his bed, and then Draco watched as he moved downwards so that he was positioned between Draco’s legs. Bloody hell, but Draco wanted to see this. He lifted himself up on his elbows, wanting to watch, but his head lolled back just as soon as Harry swallowed his prick.
"What?" he demands. "I made cupcakes. For the party. You didn't tell me how many people would be in attendance and Luna is vegan now so there need to be vegan cupcakes."
Rolling his hips, Draco met Harry’s cock with his own, frotting him, and enjoying the delicious friction. His mind went a little fuzzy then. Their touches were too much, and too little, and all Draco could think about was what was coming next. He let his hands wander, squeezing the curve of Harry’s arse and the heft of his thighs. Draco wanted to commit Harry to memory, wanted to know every line and muscle of him forever. If this was the only chance he’d ever have, Draco wanted to enjoy himself. Everything felt so brilliant.
Draco eases himself out from under Harry, who sleeps on undisturbed, and slips on his dressing gown and slippers. Draco pads down the hall to the kitchen wondering what he'll make for breakfast. It ought to be something special, but Draco doesn't have enough time to make morning buns. He did however remember to bring his produce basket with him last night, anticipating the pleasure of unpacking it knowing Harry was still asleep in bed.
"I don't know who that is but I won't stand for you besmirching my Fiori di Sicilia extract, it's about to make this cake utterly divine."
"And I thought you might like it! I don't know why you're so angry. You were angry you hadn't had any growing up so I thought I'd make you one now but apparently that makes you angry too so just go outside and eat your disgusting sandwich!"
Harry pushed open the door of the hospital Apothecary, and they made their way to the counter. “Can you fill this for me, please?” Draco asked, passing his prescription to the waiting white-coated elf. “I’ll wait.”
"I got a letter from him. Apologized and then said he wanted to hire me to fix up some of his gardens. Rich wanker, he's probably got ten different gardens."
Draco grit his teeth, remembering how he’d thought his luck had changed, and the cold bite of humiliation when he realised that Harry hadn’t wanted him.
where the shelves are covered in books — new and old, broken spines on most of them. Harry pulls a smaller story out, curiosity coursing through him, opens it to the dog-eared page and wonders if it’s his Other Self or Malfoy who has a penchant for reincarnation love stories.
The farmer, a tall man named Andrea, takes them around the property, through golden walled gardens, and round the animal pins where there are a few goats and several chickens, and then down to a wine cellar. Malfoy has a great many questions about the wine that he's asking in stilted Italian and Harry misses the feeling of the sunshine on his face so he wanders back outside and sits down against one of the low walls in the garden with its crumbling golden plaster and tips his face up to the sun. It's gorgeous here, bright and lovely, gold every way he looks.
“You’re not massive,” Harry reassured, not breaking their hug. “You’re pregnant, Draco. Carrying our little one, keeping them safe. That’s not something to be embarrassed about. That’s something to revel in. Something to be proud of! I read in my book that the big changes-“
There really wasn’t. Harry pressed a flat palm across the soft yellow cotton, touching the small, barely-there swell beneath Draco’s navel, and Draco looked down at the sight.
Food poisoning wasn’t the cause, and if it were magic, then it didn’t feel like any spell that’d ever been cast upon him. Draco refused to countenance any other reason for his sickness. Spitting out the last remnants of the plain pasta that he’d had made for him specifically, Draco stood slowly. The room was spinning a little, and he thought he ought to sit down. An afternoon in the sky left him less dizzy than he currently felt.
Around nine there's a booming knock on the door and Malfoy sits bolt upright breathing hard. "What in the name of all that is magical—"
“Mr Malfoy,” the elf explained, “we are very sad but there is bad news. Miffy is regretful, but the Anjelica roots needed to brew the potion have not been dried for the requisite four hours. We are grievously embarrassed. If it pleases sir, we have taken the liberty of asking our colleagues at Frobisher’s Apothecary to make up the potion. They will bring it over by Floo the very moment it is completed, and sir will, of course, not be charged.”
Nodding, Draco focused on making the teas, adding a sugar for Arthur, and a splash of milk for them both. It felt odd, seeing the patriarch of a pure-blood family in such a domestic setting. He doubted that he’d ever seen his own father in the kitchens of the Manor. The wizard had only deigned it necessary when he’d felt one of the elves had needed a telling off, or when he’d had a special guest from the Ministry arriving with whom he’d really wanted to make an impact. Anything household had been squarely Mother’s territory, and not part of Lucius’s remit. Draco picked up the mugs, and placed them on the table, enjoying Arthur’s contemplative company.
His brain felt a little bit like he was Stupefied. Draco spent two minutes reading, and rereading the instructions, while he willed his hands to stop trembling. Once he was satisfied that he knew precisely what to do, he took a breath, unbuttoned his trousers and got on with the task at hand.
Whatever he chose to do about his pregnancy, Draco knew the Mediwix would help him. With that, Draco stood. He changed back into the pyjamas he’d abandoned only an hour or so before and slid beneath the cold, wrinkled sheets.
Draco did. He skipped some of the more embarrassing parts, like the Braxton-hicks and his nightmare, but in the majority his story was reasonably faithful and accurate.
In the end, moving to Grimmauld Place wasn’t anywhere near as difficult as Draco might have imagined that it might be.
The green drawing room was the biggest room of the suite and Narcissa’s personal headquarters. The antithesis of the forbidding, dark rooms that Father had preferred, the Left Wing wasn’t filled with the dark magical objects and taxidermied creatures. It was light, well-lit and airy, and very soon Draco found himself standing outside his mother’s door.
It ought to have hit every page in Draco’s spell book, but, once more, there was something about the property that wasn’t right. He was tired, his feet ached, and he could feel the very beginnings of a stress headache beginning to gather just behind his eyes. They ended their visit in the enormous modern kitchen, everything chrome and already magicked safe for the baby.
He floos to Malfoy Manor in the morning, bleary-eyed and sluggish. Malfoy is in the kitchen, stirring a pot on the stove and talking to Lord Yipslington, who is asleep on his gold embroidered cushion.
“The only thing sacred about it was you, praying at the altar of Harry Potter’s prick, which you’ve been doing since puberty hit,” Pansy answered. “I can’t believe you didn’t share this prime piece of gossip with me.”
Malfoys hands are running lightly over Harry's back, his scalp, his ears and shoulders, a tingling sensation following in their wake.
the light and thanking Merlin that the Manor house-elves had made up his bed and tidied his room. He’d have to send his mother flowers come the morning. He’d never moan about her interference in his domestic matters ever again.
Harry would actually quite like a quilt. It's the sort of thing your grandmother would make for you if you had a grandmother.
Malfoy says no, mercilessly poking and prodding Harry until he gets out of bed. Watching Harry put his jeans back on Malfoy says, "Now that your apartment is suitably furnished maybe we should get you some new clothes."
He goes back to his flat to drop off his things before he Floos back to St. Mungo's, hoping Malfoy will be awake.
Draco allowed himself a smile at Harry’s shyness. “Jolly well ought to. It's my kitchen,” he replied. “I’ve lived here since I left Hogwarts. If you want to make yourself useful then you can pour the tea. Mine is the chamomile. There’s milk in the fridge.”
Harry enlarges one of the hospital chairs for him and he sits down at Malfoy's bedside. He's wearing his giant moleskin coat with all the pockets even though it's spring and his hair is as wild as ever. Harry feels so relieved to see him. So much less alone.
There didn’t seem any point in sticking around after that. Greg paid the wizard without an inch of shame, making small talk about the Harpies' long reign at the top of the table like he brought pregnancy tests in the middle of the night every day of the week. Draco didn’t speak. He was pretty sure that whatever noises would have come out of his mouth would have been garbled nonsense anyway.
Harry looks up, a shiver running up his back. "How did—" He doesn't know what to say. He swallows against the lump in his throat and says to Ms. Quincy, "Yes, lillies please."
“Gods,” Harry whispered, voice barely audible. Draco simply couldn’t drag his eyes away from the sight of their baby, but he knew, without looking, that Harry was every bit as awed as he was. The other wizard hadn’t ever let go of Draco’s hand, and he brought it up close to his body, gripping it tight. “They’re perfect. Absolutely perfect.”
"Who decided a seventeen to one ratio was streamlined?" Harry asks. Malfoy doesn't answer him except for a gentle tug on his hair, which Harry rather likes.
Harry can't really summon the energy to care about being assigned to Malfoy, just like he can't summon the energy to straighten up the mess of files in front of him. He can barely summon the energy to blink. He shrugs again and then says, "S'just another job."
Malfoys were good at many things, but chief among them was courtesy. “Mrs Weasley,” he said, nodding his head in deference. “It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.”
Merlin, but Harry looked splendid in his bed, and Draco shifted onto his side, drinking in the sight of his friend and lover. Somehow or other, Harry managed to look even better asleep than he did awake. Indecision swirled through Draco’s head. Should he kiss Harry, and wake him up that way? Possibly not. That might be a little too relationship-py after only one night together.
"Look, I think I'm on board there. He doesn't really talk about it but I'm pretty sure his dad was awful to him. And a part of me gets it. Like, he had terrible role models, he was manipulated by powerful and scary people, he was scared. But…"
“You’re tired,” Harry said, breaking the peace that had settled between. “I’m going to go now. We’ve talked about a lot today. You ought to nap for a couple of hours, Draco. Get your strength back.” Standing, Harry
The buttery, toasty scent of the breakfast worked its charms, and, as Draco was chasing the bacon around the pan with a spatula, carefully avoiding the spitting fat, Harry walked into the kitchen. Draco’s heart did a weird little pitter-pat when he saw that Harry was already fully dressed. Draco swallowed his disappointment. It didn’t have to mean anything. Perhaps Harry wasn’t as comfortable slouching around half-dressed.
“That’s their heartbeat,” Hayes said gently. “It’s very strong. I’m just going to return your notes, gentlemen. I’ll be back in two ticks. I’ll give you both a minute.”
"Alright, fine! It's bloody Malfoy. If you were with him from 9 to 5 you'd have some complaints too."
That was enough of an explanation for Victoire. Her face brightened at Harry’s praise and she fidgeted, wriggling off her perch and running off to find her friends. Draco watched her go, feeling a hard lump in his throat. This would only be the first of many such scratchy, uncomfortable conversations during the next few days. The damned bloody
"No, I'm not allowing you to get a bright orange throw blanket. You'll make your flat look like Chudley Cannon sick-up."
“Mrs Zabini and Mrs Bulstrode too. Something to do with our horoscopes apparently. When a Gemini mates with a Leo, a girl is frequently the result.” Draco scraped the last of the sprinkles from the side of the glass. “I mean, I know it's an old wives’ tale, but there’s a fifty percent chance they’re correct. Girl or boy, it doesn't matter, really. It’s all our baby.”
Well. He did say he’d allow himself one more day. Petrol is soft and warm against him and the bedsheets, pillows and duvets smell sweet and fresh, like lemons and pine.
"Er, I like the donuts Sadie brings on Friday's," Harry says, a smile creeping onto his face. He really does hate it, doesn't he? He hates the intense stress and the endless hours and being one of two brown people in the whole department.
“Have you been spending most of your time with Harry?” Greg asked pointedly, taking another swig of Pumpkin Juice. Greg’s eyes met Draco’s own and there was an unmistakable look of concern in them.
"Well if the adoring masses start trying to steal bits of your hair for their Harry Potter Polyjuice kinky sex fantasies, I'll scare them all off with my formidable former Death Eater glare."
, in large part because Malfoy keeps dragging him to boutiques and insisting Harry buy things. Without him it might've been a secondhand futon and a Quidditch poster, not because that's what Harry would've wanted, but because he wouldn't have known how to make it nice.
It was after Tuesday practice. Greg and he were drinking coffee at the home of Marcus Flint, Puddlemere’s captain, and they were supposedly discussing tactics for the upcoming weekend game. Draco wasn’t drinking coffee though – he couldn’t stomach the stuff – and he wasn’t discussing tactics either.
Malfoy takes Harry to a rug store that sells hand-tufted Persian rugs and tries to convince him to spend two hundred Galleons on a blue peacock patterned monstrosity. Harry spends two hundred and fifty Galleons on a rug with a pattern of brightly colored flowers on a cream background that Malfoy says will look gorgeous with his quilt, like it was his idea all along.
"Don't be ridiculous. There's only one florist worth going to on the whole of the British Isles," Malfoy says.
Without warning, Harry placed his hand, ever so gently, on the round bump and spreading the span of his fingers wide. Draco huffed out a breath, taken completely by surprise by the sudden touch, and Harry pulled his hand away, speedy as a hex.
Harry tugs Malfoy up out of the bed and winds his arms around his waist. He won't tell Malfoy because he's already an impossible wanker, but he's starting to see the virtue in Malfoy's argument. He's starting to think they've both suffered enough, proved themselves enough, felt the weight of a war's worth of responsibilities and failures on their shoulders for long enough. He kisses Malfoy's soft lips, a long clinging kiss that gives way to a bit of tongue and goes on and on until they're interrupted by the soft cough of the Trainee Healer.
Exactly thirty minutes later, Draco steps out of Harry's Floo wearing a soft-looking cream jumper with a cream wool coat and fitted gray trousers he probably got tailored, the rich wanker. Even more interestingly, his normally blond eyelashes are dark with mascara. The pink blush on his cheeks appears to be natural.
Draco could see the concern in Harry’s face, and he felt some of his iceberg of reserve start to melt. He’d known about their baby for weeks now – and he'd suspected their existence for even longer – and he was already used to the idea. Draco realised that it was all new to Harry, and had all been as much of a shock for the wizard as it’d been for him.
Having a baby had never been part of his plans while he was still in his twenties. He’d always imagined telling Pans and Mother he was expecting a baby while holding a glass of Champagne. He would’ve been well into his thirties and bonded to somebody handsome.
. Which, good, Harry thinks, a person should be nervous if they tried to get someone's beloved pet executed and then invited that someone to tea.
“That’s superb news,” Hayes replied, her quill writing Draco’s answer in his notes, “though you might feel yourself needing to up the amount that you’re taking as you get into your third trimester. The bigger that your baby gets, the more energy and magic they’ll use.” She shuffled the notes in the file. “Oh yes,” she said, “I asked last time if you were wanting to find out the gender. Did you get a chance to think about that?”
“Hello yourself,” Harry answered, firing the smile in his direction that had won him Witch Weekly’s Most Charming Award for the last two years. Harry looked confident, and self-assured, and the sight of him made Draco’s skin tingle. “You look handsome.”
Draco left the party last night in a daze, his lips still tingling from kissing Potter. He did all the usual things, his French eye cream and his herb de provence mouth rinse, and his Italian silk pajamas, but his mind was entirely occupied with the memory of kissing Potter. He lined up his slippers and hung up his dressing gown and lay in bed, feeling like he had sucked down three energy elixirs on an empty stomach. He hardly slept, not sure if he was dreaming of kissing Harry or remembering it.
Fortunately, Draco didn’t have to wait very long. A tall, statuesque witch stepped into the waiting room, wearing flowing turquoise robes. Her hair was pulled back into a neat bun, and she exuded a sense of professionalism.
“It’s going to be alright,” Greg said. He didn’t make Draco say the words, and for that Draco thought he would be eternally grateful. “I know it doesn’t feel like it now, mate, but it will be. Swear it to Salazar.”
It was Draco’s turn to scoff. “The only afternoon delight that I’m currently partial to comes in a bag from the The ‘Elfy Bakery,” he fibbed, feeling his face begin to flush pink. He needed to douse the stupid torch he was still carrying for Harry, and comments like that only fanned the flames. Draco didn’t think that it was healthy for his little one to feel his heart race the way it so often did when Harry was around. “But yes. You’re right. We do need to start telling people. A baby isn’t the sort of secret we can keep forever. The first person definitely has to be my mother,” Draco said, pausing at the side of Flourish and Blotts. He pretended to look in at the window display, but really, he was looking at the reflections of Harry and him inside the glass. “Suppose I’m just nervous. Mother is traditional, and a baby without a bonding ring is anathema to everything she was brought up to believe in.”
"Harry! Listen, I just had lunch with Hermione and we were thinking of having a housewarming party, what do you think?"
“I’ve been doing this job more years than I’d like to admit,” she said, “and part of that is observing people, finding out what they’re really looking for in a home. I wonder, Mr Malfoy, whether what you’re looking for is actually made of bricks and mortar. I’ve met many wix like yourself. They think they’re looking for something new, but what they’re really looking for is usually something a little closer to home.”
"You seem different," Luna says. Then without waiting for a response she turns to Malfoy and asks how he's feeling.
Draco must have sat there for eight, ten minutes before he made a decision. There was no way on God’s green Earth that he was going to meet Harry outside of St Mungo’s, like some wilted witch in need of a chaperone.
To his dismay, neither of those happened, and the two of them sat in awkward silence. What on earth had he been thinking? He’d walked away from Harry that very day, and told him that he wanted to get over loving him. Then he’d sent Harry a Patronus in the middle of the bloody night and kissed him at the merest hint of affection. He tucked his hair behind his ears, buying time. He was fickle and capricious, and Harry had every right to be angry at him. “Fuck, I’m sorry,” Draco said.
Harry had vetoed naming their baby after somebody that they’d loved and lost. “They should be their own person,” Harry had said, only a few nights before. “Free to live their own lives. Nobody should be forced to live in another’s shadow.” Draco had entirely agreed.
In theory, telling Pansy Parkinson-Nott should have been easier than telling his Mother. Draco knew that Pans ought to be pleased for him. Draco was, after all, godparent to Cygnus and Pansy was the person who’d known him the longest in his life. His friend moaned often that she was the only one of their Slytherin gang who’d done any actual growing up, so the fact of Draco being pregnant should be manna to her ears. Cygnus and his little one would be playmates.
Harry steals himself and enters the kitchen. Draco's old lady tiled table is crowded with dishes: a platter of bacon rashers, a ceramic pan with cinnamon rolls, dripping with frosting, a bowl of sliced fruit, the teapot and cow creamer, and plates set for both of them.
Harry washes his hands and gets to work slicing crusts. After a thorough inspection of Harry's crustless slices, Malfoy asks him to peel the cucumbers. And after inspecting the skinless cucumbers, Malfoy apparently comes to the conclusion that he can trust Harry with basic kitchen tasks and supplies Harry with a steady stream of small tasks. Malfoy seems steadier now, in his element, and his directions to Harry are direct but not terse. Save the bread and cucumber scraps in this bowl, wrap the bread so it doesn't dry out, zest this lemon.
And then they go to the florist. The florist happens to be in London and appears to be Muggle until Malfoy leads him through a door with a sort of cloudy swirling film.
His other self stretches in bed with a soft groan and rolls over to Draco’s side of the bed, to the lovely warm spot his lover left behind. As if in a choreographed move, Petrol hops up on the bed just then, tucking herself against Other Harry’s back, who pulls her in closer with something that sounds like a "good morning," which she returns with a deep purr.
Malfoy is laying on his back looking extremely pale, even paler than usual, but his nose and fingertips are no longer blue. Harry pulls a chair over and looks his fill at Malfoy's blonde eyelashes and the wisps of baby hair around his forehead. Eventually he gets tired of looking and starts itching to touch, so he does. He brushes the hair back from his forehead and thumbs his pointy cheekbones and runs his finger tips down Malfoy's arm, to his bony hand. As he's slipping his fingers through Malfoy's and rubbing the back of his hand, Malfoy wakes up.
"The light one is Bechamel and the dark one is Roux. Hello Mr. Weasley, thank you for coming," Malfoy says with too-stiff politeness.
He barely has time to clean up his bowl of cereal and the honey and butter-splattered plate when Other Harry is back, covering the table in fresh fruit and veg. Harry moves away from the sink and back to the corner, wishing he could pet Petrol’s soft fur when she meows at him. He’s always been convinced cats can see through the bloody thing, ever since his very first encounter with Mrs. Norris.
Other Harry mumbles an answer Harry can’t catch from the other room. Then, “… I feel weird,” he says.
Not that Draco really cared at that precise moment in time. Aged twenty-three, Harry Potter was still every bit as attractive as he’d been as a seventeen-year-old Saviour, back when he’d been brimful with powerful magic and had the world at his feet. Harry’s lips were hot and urgent, and his thick fingers were knotted in Draco’s hair.
Of course, Draco couldn’t tell Judith that he’d turned his mind against it the moment that they arrived, so Harry and he proceeded to follow her though the elegantly decorated rooms.
“Now, we need to talk food. Food goes a long way when it comes to Draco. Chocolate. Aplenty. And tea. Good tea, loose leaf. Learn how to make a London Fog. Also, learn how to make Molly’s mocha. Buy peppermint syrup for it, too. I know none of this makes sense, but let yourself enjoy food, too. Don’t be afraid to try new things. It’s probably best you let Draco guide you when you’re unsure. He is fussy but has
“Draco,” Harry said again, but this time it wasn’t a question. His voice was a whisper, a mere murmur of noise; his hand was still curled around the base of Draco’s neck. Their knees pressed against one another’s, and time seemed to slow down, thick as treacle.
Laying on top, obscuring everything else is a giant bunch of lacinato kale, some leaves bigger than Draco's head and all of them a deep emerald green. The stems where the kale has been cut are still crisp and moist like it was picked this morning. There's another bundle of dark green leaves, with graceful ruffles that Draco knows to be spigariello. He's never tried it before but he's delighted by the novelty and envisioning it in a frittata, perhaps with a good amount of creamy Bulgarian feta. Beneath the kale and spigariello is a bunch of celery with a bouquet of leaves still intact, unlike the beheaded celery at the shops. Draco didn't know celery could smell so strongly. He has an idea of what to do with all those leaves—he flagged a recipe for parsnip soup with currant, pine nut and celery leaf relish—and the thought makes him salivate. He takes another sip of rich coffee and smiles. There's a beautiful green cabbage, and several purple potatoes Draco knows will be gold on the inside, Andrea showed him at the farm. There's what must be several pounds of various citrus, blood oranges and grapefruits, and lemons, all fragrant. At the bottom of the basket are yellow and red onions, the work horses of the kitchen.
Once again Harry tries to draw a straight line from the Malfoy who broke Harry's nose to the Malfoy who holds Harry's hand and gets lost along the way. Malfoy says Harry wants him to suffer to prove he deserves to be happy now. And Harry's not sure he doesn't. He doesn't know how else to judge that Malfoy's changed except to see if he feels badly about the things he's done, to wonder if there's guilt or shame lurking under the defiant front Malfoy puts up whenever Harry talks about their past. What else is there, besides regret, to prove improvement?
They look at each other with loving eyes until Harry smacks the table, "You are ignoring the main crisis here! I kissed Malfoy!"
Malfoy stiffly pours Harry a cup and then looks up at him for instruction on cream and sugar, his mouth set in a frankly ridiculous little pout that makes Harry want to laugh out loud.
that ended the Cookery Charm and then Draco watched as he Levitated the charred, still-smouldering pan to the sink.
"Let's get this straight, Potter. I have thought a great deal more about this than you ever will. You show up here demanding I look pitiful enough to satisfy your Gryffindor sense of fair and just retribution—"
Harry makes it to the weekend without anymore semi-romantic spontaneous trips to Italy and semi-romantic wine soaked picnics with big gay reveals to muddle his head.
With that, Harry pushed lightly at Draco’s shoulder until he was lying on his back, and then he knelt between Draco’s legs, leaning down to kiss him until the two of them were out of breath once again.
Draco opened the door, and there Harry stood. He was holding a huge bag from The ‘Elfy Bakery – Draco loathed that pun with a passion – and his good-looking face looked entirely too cheerful.
“Twenty-three is a little young,” Harry said slowly, and Draco couldn’t fault him for his honesty. “And after my Quidditch accident I swore to myself that I wasn’t going to do relationships, or settle down. Everything seemed precarious, afterwards, and I couldn’t imagine having a husband, having kids… I don’t know.” Harry huffed out a sigh, and his face took on a thoughtful expression. “I had a few sessions with a Mind Healer afterwards. I didn’t tell anyone. ‘Suppose it didn’t feel like anyone else’s business. They said that was a really normal thing to believe, and that I’d get over it in time.” Harry shot Draco a rueful glance. “But yeah. The idea of a kid, and not being around for them – of
The last time Harry felt this conflicted he had just found out Snape was the Half-Blood Prince. But Harry never drunkenly kissed Snape—thank god for that—and Harry has drunkenly kissed Malfoy.
Harry planned on dropping the bags in his room and leaving right away but as he comes back out to the living room he hears Ron arriving home with a "Hiya Ferret," and Malfoy's answering "Weasel."
“Oh yes,” Harry answered, and then he was kissing Draco once more, deep and slow, walking Draco over the carpet to his bed. The backs of Draco’s knees hit the bed, and he dropped down onto the plushy covers. Shaking his head, Harry surveyed the scene. “All these pillows. They a pure-blood thing, or a Draco thing?”
Despite Draco’s bold words on Diagon Alley, Draco still waited three more days before telling his mother.
A wry smile makes an appearance on Malfoy's face. He starts folding the edge of the sheets and then compulsively smoothing it out again. "Maybe a little," he says, not looking at Harry.
It wasn’t Narcissa’s way to be discourteous – the witch shuddered at the sound of a raised voice – but Draco couldn’t help dreading the conversation he knew they needed to have.
Even fighting through the disorientating feeling of the unexpected landing, Harry knows there really is only one possible explanation: the cursed trunk that, according to the crime scene folks, had been deactivated before the Aurors retrieved it that morning was, in fact, very much
"Oh of course! You know I photograph every quilt I make. Each one is special, you know, stitched with love and magic!"
“Very gentlemanly,” Draco said, sitting down in the chair opposite. He snagged a sandwich off the plate nearest to him. “I’m very impressed, although you don’t have to be so solicitous around me, Harry. I’m pregnant, not made of glass.”
When Harry's licked his plate clean, Malfoy asks with an air of trying too hard to sound casual, "So have you dated any boys?"
"You're just trying to make sense of something that fundamentally doesn't make sense. Hurt happens, Harry, and no one ever deserves it. I'm simply not going to pursue making a miserable and angry woman more miserable and angry. I'm done with making people miserable and angry."
Draco kept his face passive, not wanting to betray the strong feelings of disappointment that washed through him. It was unaccountable, really; the idea of his living at Grimmauld Place and raising the baby hadn’t ever come up before, yet Harry’s dismissal of it felt painful. Molly looked to be getting ready to counter Harry’s last comment. Her face was the very picture of exasperation, and her husband and children looked to be getting ready to make a snappy exit.
Harry laughs and wiggles out of his jeans, tossing them in a heap on Malfoy's floor just to rile him up, and then scoots closer on the bed. Malfoy hooks one leg over Harry's and hands him his tea.
“Alright,” Draco said. He knew a moment like this ought to be marked with grand words or a majestic gesture, but prolonged Harry-exposure tended to make him tongue-tied. “Alright. I’ll move in with you, Harry Potter. Only because of the Mondrian, mind you. No other reason at all.”
. Harry helped him down from the table. “I’m a little concerned with your energy levels,” Mediwitch Hayes said, running her finger across a piece of parchment before she looked up to meet Draco’s gaze. “Please don’t worry, it’s all very usual, and nothing that I wasn’t expecting. This horrendous heat doesn’t help matters either. I’m going to write you a prescription for a potion that will ensure that your magic doesn’t fluctuate. Try to make sure that you’re taking it last thing at night, just before you go to bed.”
Draco was glad he was sat down. His legs felt wobbly, and there was a flickering at the edges of his vision. Knowing that headlines were imminent, and the reality of them actually existing were too different things. Merlin, but his mother would read this, and all of her highborn friends. Harry made an irritated noise, and spread the paper out in front of him.
Harry came to a stop in front of a display of cribs. They were beautiful, hand carved items, and each was unique and enchanted. Some were carved with images of magical creatures, others with invocations and spells.
As the two of them waited beside hair-growing elixirs, and potions for fresh breath, Harry rubbed his knuckles gently across Draco’s forearm. “A Sickle for them?” Harry asked, placing the teeth-brightening he’d been examining back on the shelf. “You’ve been ever so quiet since we left the appointment.”
Harry frowned at Draco, but he didn’t take the bait. He ripped off a piece of his own garlic bread and ate it thoughtfully before he answered.
Grimmauld Place wasn’t far from where Draco lived, less than half an hour’s flight for Orpheus, but Harry still kept Draco waiting.
things – and there hasn’t been anybody else, not for months.” Draco didn’t add that the first thing they’d used had failed completely and that the Contraceptive Charm was widely known for being tosh. “Sorry. It just- well, it can’t be what you're thinking. It’s impossible.”
So Harry gets Malfoy a fettuccine with a cheesy cream sauce, peas, and bacon. Harry actually feels grateful Malfoy is too picky to eat St. Mungo's food because it gives him a way to be useful. And he gets to see Malfoy's expression when he walks in the room with the take out container. Malfoy even manages to eat most of it before he falls asleep again.
The landlord clears his throat loudly, so loudly Harry wonders if he'd tried several smaller coughs previously.
“He doesn’t,” Draco replied, unsure how he knew that he could be so candid with Arthur, only knowing that it felt right. “We’re just very good friends that are having a baby together. Those were his exact words to Victoire earlier, and I have to accept that. It needs to be enough. The baby… Well, they’ll have two dads that love them, two dads that’ll put them before anything else in the world, and that’s more than Harry or I ever had. They’ll be more loved than anything.”
“I hope you’re breathing. Listen carefully, okay? This sounds ridiculous but I want you to remember so I’ll say it first: lean on Narcissa. She is going to be your biggest supporter.”
“Exactly as it should be,” Draco smirked in reply, casting his eyes around the room. There were daffodils in a vase, and beautiful pieces of modern art on the walls. As well as another Mondrian, Draco recognised a small Rothko. “This is your bedroom,” Draco said, recognition flooding his consciousness.
Draco didn’t look up at Goyle. He couldn’t. Any movement of his head – any at all – and he knew that he’d be parting with the remainder of his breakfast.
"Because you bloody watched me make you breakfast!" Malfoy says a little shrilly, before laying down his fork and knife and taking a deep breath. "Potter, I made crepes. Would you like a crepe?"
“I’m afraid that you can’t fly,” Braithwaite said, soon as Draco was sitting back in front of him. “The risk of accident – of your passing out, a collision or even a fall – they’re all increased. So, until you’re no longer expecting, I’m afraid that you’re out of the team. Of course, we’ll keep all of this between us for now. This is nobody’s choice, or business, but your own, Draco. We’ll say that you’re suffering from a Muggle virus until you’ve had some time to come to a decision.”
Draco felt embarrassed, like he’d been caught in a fib. It wasn’t fair for Harry to pick up on the witch’s comment and to make him blush. “You’re supposed to be looking at the racing brooms,” he replied brusquely, trying to avoid both the subject and Harry’s warm gaze, “but instead here you are, stood there like the world’s most hapless voyeur! How long, might I ask, were you standing there?”
Mediwitch Hayes gave him a brief, reassuring smile. “Then you’re in excellent hands,” she replied. “There is nothing more important to me, and my team than the health of the fathers and babies that I work with.” She jotted a note down in a parchment file that had Draco’s name on the front, before picking up her wand. “Can you hop up onto the examining table,” she asked, “and pull up your jumper?”
Harry puts his arm around Malfoy and squeezes him closer. He knows he needs to choose his words carefully here. Harry still wonders what would be enough, what Malfoy would have to do for Harry to forgive him.
"Nothing," Harry says, but as he says it he realizes he really doesn't care if Malfoy knows he's angry. "You just seem to think you can make a couple of rock cakes and all's forgiven."
"Good, you stay here, get another cuppa and I'll tell Kingsley what's happened and get a case file started."
Luna's tongue is poking out while she navigates a tricky bit of stitching then she lays her project in her lap.
Draco rises early on Monday, eager to get to the kitchen. Today will be the first delivery of produce from the farm and Draco wants to sip his coffee and arrange fruit in bowls and smell every vegetable without Potter around to watch him. Not that he minds Potter in his kitchen, unfortunately it's quite the opposite, but he doesn't fancy being accused of fondling the cabbage.
Petrol jumps up onto him, curling up on his lap. Harry has no idea what the next few years will bring him, despite knowing it somehow ends here, but his chest warms up at the idea of seeing Petrol again. “I’m looking forward to meeting you in the future,” he tells the cat, and pets her soft fur until she’s purring.
“We had our sixteen-week appointment this morning,” Draco said, all his embarrassment vanishing with the witch’s kind compliment. He thought back to the
Hermione wipes her eyes and then uses her business voice to say, "We'd like to sign the paperwork as soon as possible please."
"What was it that arsed you off? That he made you breakfast?" Ron asks, smiling at Harry in a way that makes Harry want to send a stinging hex at him just a little bit.
Then, without warning, he stepped forward and pulled Draco into a hug, right there in the middle of Wizkids Magical Emporium. Draco was a little surprised, and he felt the eyes of a few of the other shoppers drift over them, but he didn’t pull away. Somehow it felt right, the two of them together, their baby between them, and Draco felt his heart skip a beat.
Going to his bed with such an awful mindset always fated Draco to nightmares, and that night was no different. Abruptly he found himself wandering the corridors of St Mungo’s.
Mother was right. What Harry and he had made together was more significant, more momentous than Draco’s yearning heart.
Internally, Draco cringed. He’d said so many awful things about the Burrow to Ron while he’d been at Hogwarts. He’d pondered, loudly, whether the family ate dinner in the pig-pen, whether they all bathed together to save on bathwater, and even whether Ron and his brothers took it in turns to sleep in the only bed they owned.
When he got to the end of the letter, Draco tapped the parchment with his wand. It flew to the front of his larder and stuck there, at eye level.
It wouldn’t be much long before loose robes and baggy jumpers weren’t an option anymore, and then he knew he’d have to bite the wand, and go and be measured for paternity clothes. Even his looser-fitting trousers had gotten restrictive and Extension Charms – useful as they were – tended to snap at the most inopportune moments. Indeed, only the day before, Draco had been astonished when, while reaching for a book, the button from his trousers had popped off, and spun across the floor. He’d thanked Merlin that Harry hadn’t been on one of his many visits at the time, for he thought he might simply have died of embarrassment.
Harry’s brow furrowed, and Draco almost felt sorry for him. “I took advantage,” Harry answered, pulling his hands out of his pockets, and wrapping them around himself in a defensive gesture. “Thing is Draco, I like you… Have done for a while.” He paused, looking wretched. “But we can’t fuck again. I’m not ready for you – for this,” Harry said, motioning to the breakfast that was starting to burn. “I don’t want anything serious.”
The last thing in the world that Draco wanted to discuss was being sick. “It wasn’t a Muggle virus,” Draco cut in, wanting nothing more than for Harry to stop talking. He looked at the tasteful watercolours decorating the walls and the tiered trays of sandwiches, praying for inspiration. “Braithwaite put that about. That wasn’t the real reason I missed those last couple of matches.”
"Ms. Quincy, may we see the pictures of previous quilts? I was wondering if you have one of my narcissus quilt."
wrote that it’d been the ‘debut of a generation.’ Draco Malfoy, and the puzzling Muggle virus that had knocked him out of the team warranted a sentence at the bottom of the page.
He supposed he’d been a panicky witch, terrified by a spot of indigestion or achy muscles from lying badly in his bed. He wondered whether Harry would scoff, or think him foolish. He didn’t appear to, though. Harry’s hand moved up to stroke across the base of Draco’s neck. Instinctively, Draco let out a slow breath. Being in Harry’s company was always enough to make him feel better.
Harry is in awe at this companionship they have, a peace that extends even to him (secret, quiet) under his cloak, something he never had even when Ron and Hermione were still at Grimmauld Place with him.
"I wouldn't mind that actually. I've only got my Hogwarts robes, Auror robes, and a bunch of ugly hand-me-downs from my cousin Dudley."
"While your situation is a bit unique in that you were raised by racist white people, you're not the first mixed person to feel as if they don't meet whatever imaginary, and frankly detrimental, standards for entry society wants us to buy into. The idea that there's some kind of monolithic and pure experience of any particular heritage or identity is absurd. You wouldn't say someone isn't as magical if they happened to live without a wand, right?"
The man grunts. Malfoy fumbles with the paper money, cursing under his breath as he drops a couple pounds, causing the man to grunt again in a decidedly hostile manner.
Ending his pregnancy meant that Harry wouldn’t ever have to be told. Draco was a great believer in listening to other people, and Harry had been remarkably clear.
Draco and Harry are gentle kisses and soft touches for the rest of the day, hushed whispers between them, faces nuzzling into necks and hair, hands cradling faces.
"The real question is whether or not he regrets it," Hermione says, that twinkle in her eye working overtime.
"Yes, that's right. She made risky choices, prioritized certain things, and she died because of it," Luna says, her eyes bright. "And for a very long time, I couldn't forgive her for those choices."
Draco had laughed at the prescience of that, and wondered, not for the first time, whether his mother could divine the future. “Oh, no. Not before the baby is born, at the very least. The last thing I want is to look like a small planet in all of my photographs,” he’d said, shaking his head. "Perhaps before the next one,” he’d admitted, before adding slyly, “though I think Harry can have the pleasure of carrying that one to term.”
Draco must have sat there, perched on the edge of the loo for longer than he’d imagined, because the next thing he heard was Greg, knocking on the door. “Mate,” he said, “everything alright in there? You okay?”
The sound of his name being spoken pulled Draco from his reverie. It was Mediwitch Hayes, and she wore a bright, welcoming smile. She stood in the doorway and held a sheaf of parchment notes in her hands.
Malfoy stops cackling abruptly and slides up to Harry, putting his hand on Harry's bicep and squeezing lightly. "Oh," he says, still a little breathless. "Auror Potter with all his muscles."
Harry accepted that. “And I’m not here with my rose-tinted specs on, Draco. We’ve been everything to one another, haven’t we? We’ve been enemies, friends, and lovers in our time, and now we’re going to be parents. I don’t want to presume anything about the two of us, but I'd like for us to be a team. I’d like us to support each other. I reckon that’s the least our baby deserves. This is a knotty situation for both of us,” Harry concluded, “but we have to make it work, one way or another.”
Harry buries his head in his hands. "Why are you torturing me? Isn't it bad enough I kissed Malfoy without you two talking about tongues?"
vanished. Draco pulled down his jumper. He couldn’t afford to think about Harry or the aching, empty feeling that he experienced every time he thought about their night together. Right now, he had to think about himself, and exactly what he wanted his future to look like. Draco couldn’t afford to be petulant or to hide his head in the sand. He had to be the adult; be the big, grown-up wizard that he spent his life pretending to be.
Ending his pregnancy meant that he wouldn’t have to tell Pansy, who’d only want to fuss, and faff, and want to throw him baby showers. Draco didn’t feel ready to have those conversations.
Still, as Draco had also said to Harry, a baby wasn’t the sort of secret that Draco could keep forever.
"You can't Floo home. You're supposed to make sure I don't get maimed. You're stuck here with me. You've always just been stuck here with me."
Without warning, his whole body juddered, and his prick twitched eagerly. Draco’s climax coiled outwards from the head of his penis, spreading through his middle and limbs while he gasped and panted. His head swam, his back arched and the blood pounded in his veins. Semen wet his and Harry’s bellies as he fell, irretrievably, over the edge. Draco shook, and trembled, losing himself in the waves of his orgasm.
"Longbottom," Malfoy says, with a formal nod toward Neville. "I'll just be browsing," he says, leaving Harry to face Neville alone.
Louis would be the one to swipe the Snitch from Lewandowski’s fingers that afternoon, and to hear the joyous roar of the crowd. Had the Mediwix had booted Draco from the First Team only two months before, Draco knew that he’d have been spitting feathers, threatening lawyers, and throwing hexes. He’d have been livid. Right now, Draco wasn’t, and he wasn’t sure how he ought to feel about that fact.
He likes kissing Malfoy because Malfoy always goes slow. Even when Harry wants to speed up, wants to lick his tongue all the way into Malfoy's mouth and grab at his clothes and pull him closer, Malfoy goes slow. He pulls back and nips at Harry's lips and sucks soft kisses behind Harry's ear, meeting Harry's rushing with thorough patience. Harry's not sure about a lot of things with Malfoy, but the fact that Malfoy is a great kisser is not one of them.
Harry finishes making tea for himself. The tray Malfoy used to bring Harry breakfast in bed is still here so Harry sets his cup of tea and a kouign amann on it and levitates it to the bedroom. Malfoy is already curled up and fast asleep, he doesn't even wake when Harry climbs into bed. Harry drinks his tea and reads a Quidditch magazine and if he occasionally brushes Malfoy's hair away from his face no one has to know.
It didn’t take long for the two of them to Floo back to their hotel. The Receptionist hardly gave them a second glance, and Draco supposed that she was used to wizards returning with far odder items than Apothecary bags. Draco quietly thanked Merlin that there still wasn’t a soul about.
“Don’t worry, I’ve had my moments,” Draco told his friend as he unscrewed his bottle. “Had hair so frizzy that I had to hide it under a hat. Shirts that got so sweaty that I had to Floo home and shower. Merlin,” he said, dropping his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “I’ve even had nipple chafe. Bloody hell, but they were so tender! Harry noticed that I was uncomfortable while we were watching some Muggle televsion thing he adores – called Merlin, would you believe, and I reckon that the person who designed the dragons was
She disappears under the counter for a moment and returns with a meticulously labeled binder that reads Jan-Jun 1986 and flips directly to the picture she's looking for.
"Cheers, Ferret." Ron takes a kouign amann and his butterbeer and disappears into the hallway again.
Malfoy chats with Luna easily for a while before his energy leaves him and he starts yawning again. Luna tells him not to worry, that he should nap, and stays in her chair while he turns on his side and lays down to rest. She looks at Harry expectantly.
Malfoy smiles softly, his perfect cinnamon rolls smile like he knows what Harry's thinking. "Cake first. Now start casting."
Draco, already emotional, felt a bit overwhelmed by Harry’s words and so he didn’t reply. Instead, he placed his own fingers through the other man’s and knit them together, wanting to share in the special event.
Every day or so, Harry would Floo to Half-Moon Place, and the two of them would spend a couple of hours in each other’s company. Sometimes they read, and sometimes they watched films. Sometimes they listened to the wireless, and sometimes Draco snoozed on the settee. It was pleasant; companionable.
Harry does hold his commentary, no longer pretending he's not avidly watching Malfoy. He watches his hands with his thin capable fingers measuring. He watches his arms, sinewy and strong, whisking. The cake seems to come together in no time at all and Malfoy slides it into the oven and comes to stand in front of Harry.
alright,” he answered, some of the heat leaving his voice. “It’s just a spot of food poisoning,” Draco clarified. “Last night in the restaurant? I knew when I was eating it that the chicken was suspect. I’ve half a mind to owl the chef.”
"Harry's never had a dal before because his aunt and uncle were raging racists. So having an Indian dish now, that he might have had growing up if his parents had been alive, and from Malfoy, resident former-fascist, brings up complicated feelings, among which I'm sure is some annoyance at the assumption that because Harry is Indian that dish was a part of his upbringing and current tastes. Am I right, Harry?" Hermione says.
“Circe… I, erm…” Harry began, backing out of the room. “I’ll be back in a moment. Draco. Arthur.” Harry said, nodding to the Weasley paterfamilias, almost as an afterthought. “I promised Ron that I’d help him with that- that thing.”
“I’ve already missed the whole afternoon yesterday. You can’t expect me to stay at home when you’re not even ill,” Draco says.
The giant cats settle at Hagrid's feet at the table as they sit down to tea and Malfoy says awkwardly, "Please help yourselves."
“It’s not that. I know you’re a boring git that never dates,” Harry answered, standing to pick up his wand from the side table. “I don’t want any other surprises. The sort that arrives nine months after the event. I’ll cast the charm.”
He takes his shoes off, quiet as he can, and tucks them under the sides of the chair, out of the way. He tucks his feet under himself and he watches, mesmerised, as Other Draco and Harry whisper their affections and goodnights, and cuddle up together under the duvet.
“Alright,” Draco replied, hesitant. “I’d like that, Harry. We did have a brilliant time.” He huffed out a breath. “We might get seen together, buying pushchairs, me with my ever-growing bump protruding out front. Wherever you go a
Malfoy starts cutting the grapefruit in a fussy way that removes all the pith and he calls "supreme" while Harry rolls his eyes. Malfoy moves so effortlessly in the kitchen, cutting one thing, flipping another, timing both the potatoes and the fish in the oven so they're both deemed perfectly cooked at the same time.
Draco loved Harry. He loved the very bones of him and now he was bearing Harry’s baby. He was literally carrying a part of him beneath his heart.
Harry, perhaps overwhelmed by the sheer volume of sarcastic rhetorical questions and the ludicrous suggestion that Harry should somehow think Malfoy's a good person, laughs. It's precisely the wrong thing to do. Malfoy slaps a sponge down on the counter and stalks off.
“Salazar’s fucking eyes,” Draco managed, his voice rather more high-pitched than he’d have liked. “I-I don’t have the first clue which potion I need to buy… And that old git is
His thoughts jumble, mixed up bits of Malfoy and Lord Yipslington and a cabbage the size of one of Hagrid's pumpkins and then a light hand touches his shoulder.
Malfoy traces the rim of his teacup. "I was going to say, after that it really wasn't safe to… The other Death Eaters… Well I'm sure it will come as no surprise to you that they didn't much like my 'kind', pure-blood or not."
Neither of them had known family the way Draco had seen it at the Weasleys, but now they had a chance to make a family of their own, all by themselves. It might be unconventional – co-parents, and not bonded husbands – but their family would be a precious, cherished thing for all that. Draco felt a small twist of sadness, and a lump in his throat as he felt the baby’s small movements deep inside of him. Perhaps it didn’t matter that Harry and he weren’t a couple.
Draco had scoffed at that, but secretly he’d been pleased with the idea. “They might inherit my brains,” Draco answered, tucking the blanket away where it wouldn’t be spied by a nosy house-elf or worse, a visiting Narcissa. “Be a Healer or an Unspeakable. They don’t have to play Quidditch.”
The very next day, Draco found himself fast asleep once more. The blond wizard prided himself that he’d done his very best to stay awake – reading one of the many baby books that Pansy had lent him after her last visit, and discovering that his baby already had eyelashes, and that the magical centre of their brain was nearly fully formed – but Half-Moon Place was stiflingly hot, and his Cooling Charms seemed to be having very little success.
How likely would that be? He wouldn’t be the first Quidditch player to get himself in the family way, but it was still enormously rare. He’d only been with Harry, and that had been one single, solitary time too. The likelihood of conceiving? Surely it had to be small. Microscopic, even.
Harry laughs, breathlessly. "How about I just Disillusion myself and when the Healer walks in he'll just see your naked dick standing at attention."
"It’s delicious,” Harry answered, “but your very enthusiastic owl didn’t rouse me out of my bed to talk about coffee. Is everything alright?” Concern washed though Harry’s green eyes. “It isn’t that Muggle virus, is it? There’s been a lot of gossip… Adams said that you’d been sick, and- “
Somehow they escape the exchange unscathed. Malfoy smacks Harry on the arm as the door shuts behind them.
Five months didn’t feel time enough to get his life ready for fatherhood. Draco wasn’t even sure yet whether he’d stay at Half-Moon Place. He’d always loved how central the apartment was, and the nearness of Diagon Alley, but there wasn’t a garden or even a second bedroom. It was a bachelor pad, and Draco knew his days as a bachelor were numbered.
Harry narrowly avoids telling her he'd rather die again than buy Potter paraphernalia. "Er—thanks, I'll keep looking."
He would usually go sit at the table and watch Malfoy but something urges him to stay where he is, by Malfoy's side. Malfoy's shoulder brushes his as he reaches for a mixing bowl on a high shelf.
That seemed to work. The air in the room had felt tight with tension, but some of that dissipated when Harry smiled.
Perhaps they’d put the breakfast under stasis magic, and shower together, the heated water cascading over their bodies as they wanked each other to a warm, soapy climax. Draco’s prick stiffened under the thin cotton as he considered the fantasy. They had all day to play if they so wished.
“I’m sorry, baby girl,” a mimic of Other Harry. Harry is quite sure he’s never in his life called anyone, human or cat, “baby girl.” He giggles to himself at the realisation.
“Mistress Cissy, Master Draco,” she announced, “if you would be following me to the dining room? As requested, Beef Wellington is served.”
Now though, it seemed the rules had changed, and Draco wasn’t sure if his heart, or his nerves, were ready for the challenge.
Nodding, Draco answered. “I couldn’t have asked for better,” he said. “A bit much in the beginning, though he’s calmed down a little now. Every night his owl came tapping at my window. Nothing has been too much trouble.”
When the bowl is empty Harry curls into Malfoy's chest, and Malfoy plays with Harry's hair, threading his fingers through it in such a soothing rhythm Harry dozes a little, not quite sleeping.
Draco did so, untucking his shirt-tails and unclipping the clasp on his trousers. It felt satisfying to finally be free of their constrictions, and he huffed out a sigh. The witch chuckled at the sound, opening the notebook and tucking her quill behind her ear.
Truth be told, Harry’s visits were the highlight of Draco’s days. Though he’d Flooed several times to Pansy’s, and to the Manor – it was terrific fun, both witches waited on him, hand and foot – Draco had found that he preferred staying at home. His pregnancy had seemed, one day, to become conspicuous – Harry said he had ‘popped’ – and Draco feared the attention that going out would likely bring.
“You’re pregnant,” Narcissa said kindly, putting Draco out of his stumbling, faltering misery. “You needn’t mince your words around me. Goodness, Draco. I was wondering at what point during the course of the afternoon you were going to tell me.”
Harry rolls his eyes as Malfoy takes his hand and starts tugging Harry down the hall like it's his bedroom.
There were a few little glances, a few concealed smiles of affection from the elegant ladies and veritable old wizards who enjoyed the establishment. Harry had been correct about his fans. Most of the public had been elated at the idea of Harry and him becoming parents. The number of soft toys and knitted socks that they’d been gifted far outweighed the number of Howlers that the Owl Post-Office had intercepted, and had sent directly back to where they had come from.
“Utter nonsense. The Weasleys aren’t other people, Draco. They’re family,” Harry retorted, helping Draco to his feet. “Anyway, if I didn’t look after you, then Mols would hex me into the middle of next week, and as you’ve seen, I’m already on very thin ice. Have a lay down,” Harry urged. “I’ll charm the door so that you’re not disturbed. Everyone will pile out the door in a minute to play five-a-side Quidditch and it's not like you can fly anyway. You might as well get some shut-eye while the rest of us are messing about.”
Ron comes back, levitating three steaming cups of tea and sits next to Harry. "You'll drive yourself mad with that 'should've' stuff, mate. Let's just drink some tea, yeah? No point in going in circles, we've got no idea what's even wrong. He could be a latent Veela, it could be Dragon Pox, it could be his inbred pure blood, who knows?"
Harry looked up at him, all guileless green eyes, and Draco straightaway felt atrocious, crawling guilt.
"So you're saying, Neville deserves to be angry and Malfoy deserves to not be punished? How? I don't understand how to do both those things."
“You like what you see?” Harry joked, posing, flirty, and Draco had to admit that he did, very much.
and Malfoy sits up blinking slowly while the Healer tells them the findings of the several tests they've conducted since last night.
Mother would be horrified by his single, unbonded status, but Draco knew she’d come around eventually. She'd love the baby fiercely, ferociously, and Draco knew that she’d never let any harm come to the little one. Family meant the whole world to Narcissa Malfoy, and she wouldn’t care a single Sickle that the baby was a half-Potter, with his wild past, and disreputable genes. Her grandchild would be the apple of her eye, and the center of her universe.
The Burrow was eerily silent as Draco made his way downstairs, using a Point-Me spell on his wand to guide him through the maze-like corridors. He wondered wherever everybody had gotten to, feeling a bit like an intruder as he stepped into the now-empty dining room. Hearing a chink of crockery from the kitchen, Draco stepped inside, following the noise.
"I don't know. I don't know. They haven't come out yet to tell me. I need to go back, I just came to tell you."
Draco’s speech dried up. Harry was looking at him, very intently. “You’re definitely keeping this baby, aren’t you?” Harry asked, leaning forward. “You're not even hesitating. You’ve really thought this through.”
Neville frowns. "Even if he is different now, that doesn't erase all the pain he caused us for seven years. He hasn't even apologized."
on the door to their room, and looking at him expectantly. Draco felt his heart sink into his shoes, and he suddenly, quite keenly, wished that he had his mum there to hold his hand. He kicked off his shoes, and padded into the bathroom. He could do this. After all, it wasn’t like he had a whole set of different options.
Draco cast his eyes over to where Harry was sat. He looked enthusiastic about the idea, and Draco felt the same.
Petrol hops off the sofa and comes closer to Harry, still lost in this album, in the sunshiney pictures of Malfoy alone and the many more of them together, selfies below deck in a white bed (the thought of them together in a bed makes Harry blush and he flips those pages as quickly as he can) and against bright blue skies; others posed with wine glasses in hand, bright smiles on both their faces. The cat watches him inquisitively, as if asking why he is so different to the Harry it knows, or perhaps asking why he is such a nosy bastard and won’t stop going through what isn’t really his.
It was, but Sixteen St Mortimer’s Place wasn’t even remotely acceptable to Draco. He could tell that from the get-go. He’d no sooner move his family there than he would move them to the moon. It was in central Mayfair, so he’d be surrounded on every side by the worst kind of nouveau riche Muggle, and the road outside was busy with noisy traffic.
Draco settled on Harry’s face, imagining that he’d see some smirk there, see some grin, but he didn’t. Harry was looking at him, all concentration.
'I would like for you to take luncheon with me at the Manor,” Mother’s last owl had read, “and I do so wish for your attendance. This blasted Muggle virus has kept you from coming home for far too many weeks, and it is an
Despite the alarm, they wake up slowly today. Other Harry curls around Draco, bearded face nuzzling against Draco’s pale neck, against his face, subtle quiet whines leaving both their throats, loud sleepy exhales leaving their mouths in unison. Draco turns to Other Harry, and their lips find each other. It’s not a heated kiss. It’s nothing like all of Harry’s latest kisses, the men and women he picks up in clubs sometimes, the ones he brings home from Ministry events — there are no emotions beyond lust, then. Harry doesn’t actually know if he has kissed the way Draco and Other Harry are kissing. Slow, soft, gentle.
Harry looks down at the last bite of his cinnamon roll. He's really not sure what's happening here. He just wants another cinnamon roll. He pops the last bite into his mouth and reaches for another.
“And the last thing I said was my dad’s old catchphrase, the one you reminded me of,” Draco said ebulliently, “Malfoys only settle for the very best. That's what Harry says he wants to be for me. Merlin, but he was even talking about us taking the bond. He wants me to give the pair of us a chance.”
"There's nothing wrong with having refined tastes. You are not morally superior because you buy the Tesco bread."
Harry agrees through a mouthful of rich cake. "How is it so chocolatey? It tastes more chocolate than chocolate does."
Harry leans against the bit of counter where the sink is and watches Malfoy. He smashes the garlic with the flat side of the knife and a gleeful smack of his hand. He smells the spices and then measures them in his palm. He fishes olives out of the jar with his fingers, popping one into his mouth and nodding happily.
"Ah," Ron says. Harry realizes he was expecting Ron to rage and commiserate but Ron only says, "How'd you reckon that'll go?" without looking up. For the last year now they're either filling out paperwork or dueling for their lives, nothing in between. The only constant is the overtime they put in every week trying to round up the last of the Death Eaters from cursed safe houses and underground vaults and, memorably, the steps of Gringotts in a battle that did nothing to endear the bankers to Harry. Maybe Ron feels as ragged and worn out as Harry, though Ron's desk is somehow miraculously cleaner than Harry's.
. Draco wondered if Harry would tell him more about his parents one day, or even about the Mind Healing he’d had after his accident. It felt curious that they’d made a baby, yet they still knew so little about each other’s lives.
Draco flushed, half-annoyed that his mum knew all his secrets – bloody elves and their loose tongues! – and half-pleased at the fuss that Narcissa was making.
Everyone leaves Malfoy mostly to himself and between Harry's third and fourth cupcake Harry almost forgets it's strange that Malfoy is there.
Part of Draco expected Harry to pull away, but he didn’t. He didn’t move, or pull away, and then their lips were touching. Draco’s breath shook, and his pulse raced. It took Draco perhaps three seconds to realise that Harry wasn’t kissing him back. Hot disgrace and humiliation flooded through him and he ripped himself away from Harry’s touch.
Harry does miss Ron. They've worked together every day for the last year, cramped stakeouts, weeks of overtime, weekends and holidays and every bit of time in between. It's a lot of time to spend with someone. "It's shite," Harry says, suddenly angry that instead of spending time with his best friend all day he's stuck with Malfoy.
"I was never very angry with him. He didn't bully me like he bullied you. I suppose I could be angry with him on your behalf."
his coat from where it was hung on a peg beside the door. Draco stood to see him out, and Harry’s eyes dipped down to his waist. “I was wondering, and you can absolutely say no… and I promise that I won’t be hurt. But I was wondering if I could touch your bump?” Harry flushed a very Gryffindor shade of red. “Of course, if you don’t feel ready then I completely understand.”
him. Harry's embarrassed to find his eyes watering. He tries to wipe them covertly but Malfoy notices.
This was intriguing. Truth be told, Draco didn’t feel all that weary now. His burgeoning headache, the soreness of his feet, and even the exhaustion that had threatened to overwhelm him earlier had vanished into the ether. He nodded, and Harry took him gently by the hand, leading him out and away from the lounge. Draco found himself in a large hallway with a grand flight of steps, and he looked around, taking in his surroundings. The décor was every bit as pleasing to him as the lounge had been, but now Draco felt grudgingly impressed as well.
Draco was scared, and he was overwhelmed, but in that single moment had known. He was going to go ahead with his pregnancy. That day, for the very first time, Draco had dared to touch his still-flat belly, and had dared to imagine the baby – his baby – that was growing within.
Harry broke first. “Alright,” he answered. “Have you got something? It’s just- I haven’t, and the charm-”
“-to owl your mum?” Greg finished for him. “Funny how many crappy chefs there are surrounding you at the moment, Draco. Starting to feel like a conspiracy, matey.”
Draco dozed until the end of the film, entirely too pregnant and full of stodgy food to be bothered about how un-Malfoy-ish he must have looked.
Malfoy does in fact straighten up on his pillows with a happy smile the moment he sees the white pastry box.
“Your mother sounds like a very wise lady,” the witch responded. “Alright, I think I’ve got everything that I need.” The seamstress waved her wand, and Draco watched her kit fly neatly to their places on the shop counter. Stood there, propped against it, was Harry. His eyes were wide and affectionate, and he was watching proceedings very intently. “Ah,” said the witch, clucking in delight. “Speak of the Devil and so he appears! Godric, but that’s the look of love your husband is wearing. It’s unmistakable.” Draco tucked himself back in, confused as to how to correct the witch’s presumption. Before he could formulate an answer that even came close to describing Harry and he, she bustled away to collect her book of material swathes. “It does an old witch’s heart good to see such devotion.”
So Harry buys forks and spoons and butter knives and spends twenty minutes telling Malfoy to put the oyster forks down, he is absolutely not buying oyster forks. And he buys a wire basket and lets Malfoy arrange his fruit in it, stepping back to consider the display like it's going to be in a Renaissance painting. He gets a cast iron pan and burns his hand the first time he uses it grabbing the hot handle and he curses Malfoy until Malfoy gives him a handle shaped pot holder quilted by Ms. Quincy. And he buys the German steel bread box with the "unparalleled humidity control spells" that Malfoy won't shut up about.
Twenty-two Marlborough Road was in South Hampstead, and the most magnificent building of the three. It wasn’t a million miles from Diagon Alley, there was a superb wizarding primary school a short walk away, and the view from the windows was of a verdant green wood. The area around was leafy and pleasant, and although the house was in the middle of London, it felt rather more like a village.
“Very much so,” Harry said, getting out his wallet. He laid down several Galleons beside their finished dinners. “Thanks for today. I’ve had a really good time. Not just the
"He's right," Hermione says, coming back from her tour of the bedrooms. The landlord is starting to look a little peevish, like perhaps he didn't sign up to moderate Harry's career demolition conversation. "Harry, what do you think of the bedrooms?"
It was only later, as the two of them were sat at the table, sharing their single perfect pancake, and several rounds of buttered toast, that Draco realised something important.
"You do and you know what? It doesn't make me feel better. Doesn't fix my organs. And it doesn't make you feel better either. In fact, it makes you feel quite awful, doesn't it?"
Draco knew that the trip to Wizkids Magical Emporium was well overdue, too. Pansy had warned that their magical children’s furniture took a long time to build, and for the protective magic spells to set, and Draco supposed that he ought to start making some purchases.
Draco frowned at his mum’s mentioning of a granddaughter, but the word was overshadowed by her dire reminiscences. He hadn’t known that his mother still thought about the war in such vivid, graphic terms.
hadn’t shown Harry and him a pulsing dot. Instead, the spell had shown them a real baby – their real baby – who was changing and developing with every second that passed. This was real. This was as real as anything Draco had felt so far, and he couldn’t help but marvel at the miracle of it.
It's too big a revelation to look at straight on, so Harry looks at the cookbook instead, finding other Punjabi recipes in between Malfoy sniping at him to stop turning the page.
“But of course,” the elf replied, overjoyed at Harry’s magnanimity. “Thank you, sirs! My colleagues will be honoured by your visit.” With that the elf clicked their fingers and vanished.
will say we’re a couple. Ask when we’ll be bonded. Ask what name the baby will carry... You ought to put out a statement or give an interview. Tell them we’re no such thing. Whatever you need to do, Harry.”
"No, some cabbage is dull with bruised and wilted outer leaves and no discernible taste whatsoever, and some cabbage is glossy, with crunchy tight outer leaves and a beguiling sweetness."
, what precisely do you mean by kissing? There’s the sort you give to your maiden aunt, and the sort that you give to your betrothed.”
– and he quotes from it non-stop. Man’s basically a total pregnancy Griffindork. He’d have had the baby for me, had it only been possible or allowed.”
Draco had told the elf that she was welcome to go back to the Manor if she wished, or even strike out on her own, but she had demurred. “Adrianne wants to help with Master Draco’s new family,” she had said, her velvety ears trembling with indignation at the idea of being sent away at such an exciting time. “Master Draco will be needing every bit of help that he can get.”
But standing under the bright Italian sun, golden rolling hills dotted with poppies and rows of grape vines, Harry rather thinks cabbage is his favorite vegetable.
Neville shakes his head. He's leaning against the kitchen counter with his shoulders slumped and arms crossed over his chest. "I think I might leave," Neville says.
Instead, Draco shoved it down hard onto the wood, feeling a perverse satisfaction when the tea slopped over the rim, and splashed his kitchen table, staining it dark. With a flick of his wand, Draco
Hagrid's booming laughter startles several of the Thestrals. "Let's get these little ones sorted then."
Draco inhaled in a breath. Remembered how he used to come here with Mother, remembered how her soft rose fragrance used to smell, and how she’d never made him feel like a child. Not once. They’d always been a pair, he and his Mother. United against the petty tyrannies of Lucius. Draco wondered briefly if he and his baby might, one day, be as close.
, I’ll admit that hearing that our baby was a bait to trap you into a relationship didn’t feel amazing. You and I both know that it isn’t true. I could have done without bloody McLaggen sharing his ten Sickles either. But I’m a big, grown-up wizard; I expected Rita Skeeter to be vile. That’s how she sells newspapers. 'Wizard has a baby' doesn’t have quite the same emotional grab, does it?”
“They keep asking when you’re going to come over,” Harry said, casually as anything. “Molly does a big Sunday dinner every few weeks, and everybody piles into the Burrow. Ron and Hermione… Gins and Oliver. The whole kit and caboodle. I was going to ask you later, but now is as good a time as any. Will you come with me this Sunday? They all want to meet you, Draco. They want to get to know you a bit better.”
Apart from his clothes, his books and his owl, there was very little that he actually needed to take with him when the day dawned. Even his collection of racing brooms had been sent on ahead. Draco supposed that was the benefit of a boarding school education. It taught you to travel light, and to leave things behind without looking backwards. It taught you that people and loved ones made your home, not the address that you resided in.
Harry laughs a little, thinking about it. "With Malfoy it was so… I don't know—personal and in my face."
Malfoy steps close and whispers furiously, "I am not fighting about this in a public shop. I'm not going up because Longbottom doesn't want to see me anymore than I want to see him, and he shouldn't have to."
Malfoy ignores him and says, "Do I want the seeded rye with comte and caramelized red onion or the brioche with ricotta and balsamic roasted grapes? What are you getting?"
“Louis will be a good Quidditch player in three, maybe four years,” Harry answered, his green eyes meeting Draco’s own. “Don’t get me wrong. He’s talented, but it’s all fancy tactics and showing off. Catching the Snitch that last time was a fluke, pure and simple, and unless he practices a bit more and boozes a bit less, he’s going to get found out.” Harry made a noise of wry amusement. “Fact is, the team currently has a blasted great Malfoy-sized hole in the middle of it. You’re the heart of the team, physically and mentally, Draco. Flint said that he didn’t know whether to shake my hand or punch me on the nose when he saw me yesterday. I think – I hope! – he was joking. Marcus also said that your spot is open, whenever you’re ready to fly again.”
Draco felt dazed by what the other wizard had told him. He let his hand rest on the side of his bump, the swell of it as visible as the
Malfoy's happiness catches Harry, makes him hold his breath, leaves him with a jumbled knot of feelings to untangle.
The largest of the 'peafowl' struts into an invisible barrier at the door and gets bounced back, its long feathered tail slipping right under Harry's next step. The seconds that follow feature more squawking, some hissing, and a fair amount of lunging from all involved parties, the peacocks nipping at Harry's fingers and Harry in effort to escape. Harry tumbles through the magical barrier at the door to find Malfoy smirking down at him.
tells him he is alone in Grimmauld Place, but there is no guarantee it will remain that way for long, so he is perfunctorily efficient. He looks through drawers, deep into the back of wardrobes and high on shelves in the pantry, low into the boxes in the attic. Anything that will help him figure out when and where he is and who he can trust.
The saleswizard hurried away to collect the bill of sales, and Draco rounded on his co-parent. “A hundred Galleon crib, Harry?” he hissed, casting his eyes around to see if anyone was watching them. “Letting that wizard believe that we live together? Whatever are you playing at, Potter?”
Harry watches so intently he keeps having to remind himself to breathe. His heart aches in his chest and Harry can’t explain why. Harry watches them eat dinner, clean up after and sit on the sofa — Malfoy doing the crossword, Other Harry reading a small book, cover bent back in a way that the title is impossible to read. Harry watches them get ready for bed — how they brush their teeth side by side, how Malfoy casts Harry’s hair into a neat plait, how they wash and moisturise their faces (why can’t Hermione just be wrong, for once?), and kiss each other.
Draco almost felt like he was intruding. Such ostentatious displays hadn’t been customary when he was growing up. His own childhood had been quiet and subdued: Lucius’s opinions on child rearing hadn’t strayed very far from the idea of children being seen and not heard. Indeed, even the seeing part had been somewhat rare until Draco was old enough to be amusing. Before that, most of Draco’s time had been spent in the company of his elf-nanny, and his Governess. That definitely wasn’t what he wanted for his own little one. Draco wanted to be a hands-on dad; tucking in his child when they went to bed, teaching them to read himself, and making sure that they never, even for a moment, felt like they were surplus to requirements.
“That’s why we needed to talk,” Draco answered. “Mediwitch Hayes – she’s my St Mungo’s specialist – wants to have a chat with you. Wants to take some family history, measure the strength of your magic, that kind of thing. Later on, I might need potions, and they’ll have to be accurate…”
“Bloody hell,” Harry murmured, before pressing a kiss onto his shoulder. “At least you’ve got your form back in the bedroom.”
“Predictable as ever,” Harry said, looking around at the rest of the table. Everybody had been listening, and they all looked similarly dismayed at the words that Harry had read aloud. “That bloody witch has been twisting my life to suit her own twisted narrative since I was fourteen.” He tossed the crumpled paper across the table with a dismissive wave of his hand. “You’d think, wouldn’t you, that they’d get bored?” He turned, his green eyes dark and finding Draco’s own. “I’m sorry. I mean… We knew that they’d likely try and make out we were an item, but I didn’t think they’d make this so personal.”
Draco couldn’t help but look at Harry as he answered. The other wizard’s eyes were wide, and filled with affectionate concern. Harry leant over and gave his forearm a fleeting squeeze. “None at all,” Draco answered. “I’m feeling better than I have in weeks. The morning sickness has tapered off now, and I’ve got a lot of more energy… I’ve even felt a few little flutters which is exciting. No real movements yet though.”
Gentle, questing fingers found their way between Draco’s cheeks then, and though they made him jump, Draco leant into them eagerly. He dropped down to lie amongst the pillows, letting himself enjoy the experience. Draco felt the bliss of Harry’s pleasuring him and his careful fingers moving over his entrance.
. It was one minute past eleven, and he stood, determined to speedily change, when the doorbell chimed, signifying Harry’s arrival.
Greg, however, didn’t seem daunted. He marched Draco to the back of the shop. “It’s the middle of the bloody night,” Greg hissed into his ear, “and the old git over there is probably half-wondering whether we’re going to start throwing curses and nicking his Galleons! You aren’t wiggling out of this again, Draco mate.” Greg looked down the aisle. “We buy a bunch of stuff,” he announced, like it was an idea of genius, “and then a couple of wizard pregnancy tests won’t be anywhere near as noticeable.”
Over the next week they fall into something like a routine. Malfoy makes breakfast every day, always with some fancy little flourish. Yogurt from France. Homemade jams. Honey from bees that were sung to in the Swiss Alps, probably. They don't speak over these meals beyond 'pass the cream' kinds of comments. Harry doesn't know what Malfoy does for lunch because he picks up a Tesco egg and cress before work now. One meal is polite, two is pushing it.
The large basket is sitting on the counter, positively overflowing with produce. A few blood oranges have tumbled out and onto the floor and Draco picks them up and smells each of them. They smell incredible. Draco would bathe in the smell of blood oranges if he could. He'll use the zest for something, maybe a citrusy cake.
"Oh good, helping then. Send a quick cooling charm at that pan will you? I can't fill the pasties while it's hot."
Harry watches Malfoy add oregano and red pepper flakes to the pan before adding a tin of tomatoes. He stands at the stove stirring for a bit and then demands Harry cast a cooling charm on the tomato sauce while he tips the risen dough out onto the counter and starts rolling it into a rectangular shape. Harry can't stop watching his capable hands with his long slender fingers and the realization makes him want to groan except then he'd have to admit to Malfoy he thinks his hands are a bit sexy. So he watches quietly, as Malfoy dollops the sauce thickly over the dough and cuts the edges into thin strips that he folds over the sauce in a fancy braid, looking especially pleased with himself at the result.
Harry’s strange, Muggle idiom was enough to make Draco grin, and then his words came easily enough. “I don’t like it,” he answered, wiping away a stray tear with the back of his hand. “I love it, you utter git. It feels so safe… Sacrosanct, somehow. Makes it all feel more real. You’ve put me to shame, Harry,” Draco admitted, picking up a toy Crup and turning it over in his hands. “I’ve hardly brought a thing. A few pairs of socks, and a packet of vests.”
"Are yeh sure about that?" Hagrid says nervously. "I'm not really dressed fer tea with the Malfoys."
Delectable tendrils of pleasure radiated out from his tight ring of muscle and the sensation was enchanting. Draco took himself in hand, wanking with only a loose fist. He was already very wound up, and he knew that it wouldn’t take much to tip himself over the edge. Fuck, but Harry looked sexy. His black hair was wild and his eyes had gone all hazy.
couple. Even if we had both had our parents around showing us what healthy relationships look like they still wouldn't look like a queer relationship."
Draco sat there in silence, and played with the strap of his watch. Goodness, but what had he been thinking, wearing a yellow shirt? He grimaced. He likely looked like a monstrous bloody blancmange! Taking out his wand, Draco cast a
Well, it would have been flawless, had Draco not stumbled over a discarded copy magazine as he stepped into his trousers. The sound of it skidding against the wooden leg of his bed was noisy in the hotel room, and Draco knew straightaway that the jig was up.
“It does with me,” Harry replied leaning forward. Harry pressed his face down into the curve of Draco’s belly, giving their bump a kiss and making Draco gasp. It was an emotional moment, though it ended before it ever began.
It really was. Magic and Muggle flowers bloomed in two large beds, and the lawn sloped gently downwards around the trunks of two ancient oak trees. It was sun dappled, and shady, and Draco could envision the three of them spending many happy hours there, picnicking on a blanket and kicking a ball around. It’d be a different sort of childhood to the one that he’d known, far more relaxed and safer.
The bedroom doesn’t come with big surprises, except for the ring box he finds in the bedside table on Other Harry’s side. Two thin silver bands with the words ’
Draco loves cinnamon roll dough. It's never too sticky like bread dough. It's soft; soft like Harry's cheeks under Draco's palms last night. He zests an orange, smiling as it releases a burst of scent. He mixes the zest with cinnamon and sugar and sprinkles it over the dough, then he sprinkles a little more.
"It's gorgeous, Potter. The only thing is you need to move the rug out from under the bed more. And perhaps some candles and fresh flowers would be a nice touch."
Draco pondered Greg’s answer. Goyle was the first to whine when he got a poorly belly, but the git was infuriatingly upbeat today. Draco lay on his side, trying hard not to think about chicken, potatoes, or any other kind of food. It was bonkers. Half the time he was ravenous, and the rest of the time he was sick to his stomach. Perhaps he had some strange Muggle bug, or maybe he’d caught the tail end of a hex without realising it. Draco promised himself that he’d go to the Healers at the end of the season, and he yawned, a new, sudden tiredness making his eyelids heavy.
Draco turned away from the photograph to look at Harry. “It isn’t chaotic,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand. “You’ve seen all of mine, haven’t you, above my mantlepiece? We didn’t have a lot of photographs back at the Manor. Father believed them Muggle and déclassé. Mummy had a secret camera though, and she used to take dozens of pictures of Pans, Blaise and I. Let me assure you Harry, I intend to do the same with our own little one. Make sure I have plenty of bribery material for when they’re at Hogwarts and they want to bring their beloved home for the summer.”
“Bloody hell,” Harry laughed, jumping to attention and grabbing his wand. He slashed it through the air, casting a
"It means every day I wake up enraged by my father but some days I wake up more enraged than others and one of those days you'll come over and say, hey Malfoy, you're in a right foul mood, and I'll say yes Potter, I'm enraged at my father, here's why. And if you haven't yet understood from my actions—for example, sending my own father to prison—you'll listen to my angry tirade and understand that my personal and political viewpoints have undergone drastic change."
"Potter, you need cutlery. You can't eat off of take out forks. You're the Savior of the Wizarding World. People, Merlin help them, look up to you."
Back in his kitchen, equipped with yeast, Malfoy seems to have forgotten he was angry with Harry. Dough is mixed and set aside to rise in record time and Malfoy is drumming his fingers against the counter top.
Their tone has been mostly joking, a quick back and forth with a lot of throwing hands up just for the fun of it, but Ron's last comment sobers Harry up a bit.
Harry is struggling with the tie on the bread bag and it takes a moment for Ron's words to register.
Draco gave Mediwitch Hayes a tight smile, and nodded. He didn’t want to talk to Harry – and would dearly have liked to go through the rest of his days without speaking to him ever again – but this, their baby, was a bigger deal than his personal pride. Draco didn't believe that it was a brave choice to have the baby, but the idea of them suddenly
Perhaps thinking Harry might protest, Kingsley had given Harry several reasons why. Over the last year Malfoy has been testifying against several Death Eaters in Voldemort's closest circle. The last Auror assigned to protect Malfoy had let a few hexes land and they couldn't afford mistakes with the Lestrange trial wrapping up. And wouldn't it be a fine thing to show the wizarding public an example of healing post-war tensions.
All he could do was take Harry’s hand, and press it onto his belly, press it where their daughter was kicking. Draco felt the swoop of her moving and another thump as she kicked out at Harry’s palm. Draco waited for Harry to understand what was happening, and when he did, Harry gasped, his eyes wide with astonishment. Harry couldn’t speak either. All he could do was look between Draco’s face and the span of his hand, unable to decide where to rest his eyes.
His mother seemed to understand. “There was no mistake,” she said decisively. “Your union was a sacred one, blessed by Merlin. Wizards have long lifespans, Draco, and perhaps once he meets your daughter he will feel differently? You’re a striking, clever man, and the other parent to his child. Give Harry time. Has he been solicitous and gentle with you?”
Harry’s arm darted out, and Draco had to fight a farcical urge to laugh at the sight of it. “They’re not the Snitch,” Draco joked, voice soft. Harry smiled in return and swallowed, and Draco realised that the other man was nervous. “It’s alright,” Draco said. “You won’t hurt them. It’s not like there’s much to feel anyway.”
Harry didn’t hesitate. “Certainly not,” he answered. “I’m a gentleman, on and off the Pitch. Lead the way.”
Harry watches Malfoy measure the flour, using a knife edge to smooth the excess off the top of the measuring cup with obvious pleasure. Malfoy just looks so… happy. And something about that happiness on Malfoy, something about his pleasure, won't leave Harry alone.
Even so, that didn’t mean he had to give Harry the impression he was a dumpy house-witch with a batch of babies. He might have been pregnant, but Draco was determined to maintain the standards of sartorial elegance that had crowned him a runner-up in
Harry eats and showers and dresses, his mind on Malfoy the whole time. How pale he looked and the dark circles under his eyes. At precisely 8:00 he Floos back to the hospital, this time checking in with the front desk before he goes up to Malfoy's room.
That was rich, coming from Harry. Draco wanted to explode, and his fingers itched to fling hexes at Harry’s handsome, stupid face. Harry had been the one who had left Half-Moon Place and left Draco humiliated. Harry had been the one to call Draco his mistake.
Harry huffed out a sigh. It would seem that Molly’s meddling wasn’t over quite yet. “Draco is more than welcome to live at Grimmauld if he wishes,” Harry said, gesturing over to where Draco was sat beside him. “What’s mine is his, but – like I’ve told you before! – the pair of us
headline yet, but it was only a matter of time: in under a month his tummy had gone from looking like he was smuggling a Snitch to looking like he was hiding a Bludger. The speed at which their baby was growing was a little startling, and a little brilliant too, and Draco hadn’t known that his body could change as fast as it had.
Harry accepts this exchange. Malfoy makes hibiscus rose shortbread fans and sprinkles sparkly pink sugar on them with particular glee.
“That’s all your daughter’s doing, making me grumpy,” Draco said, doing as he was asked. He got the juice out, and placed it on the table. “She’s a hungry little blighter who makes me crave sweet things. I think she inherited that from you.”
Harry took a deep breath, like he was going to say something else, but instead he began to kiss Draco once again.
Perhaps Greg was right. Maybe he’d get hurt again, but maybe it was worth taking that chance. Greg’s warning made him think of something else, and Draco smiled. “Malfoys only settle for the very best,” Draco murmured, his mouth impossibly close to Harry’s own.
He stroked a hand over the side of his burgeoning bump while he waited. It was definitely, undeniably, the fault of their little one, no question about it.
"So do you need five shots of Firewhiskey to kiss me?" Malfoy says, crowding Harry against the counter top.
“We’re co-parents,” Harry cut in. Draco flicked his eyes over. Harry’s face was sincere and heartfelt, and the sight of it made Draco’s tummy flip over. “And we’re friends. Friends who are having a baby. I’m doing my best to look after Draco, so far as he’ll let me.”
Harry joins Ron and Hermione on the back stoop of the Burrow. Ron passes Harry a butterbeer and Harry leans back against the door frame. Mrs. Weasley has cooked the usual feast and the Weasley's are all together and so obviously grateful for each other. Harry is stuffed with Mrs. Weasley's roast and feeling like he should be happy and content.
"S'fine, mate. Just saying some big things happened in all our lives. Big things like that can really change your perspective.
“I’ve gotten a little bigger,” Draco answered, his cheeks flushing at the admittance. “I’ve been using Extension Spells but nothing’s fitting very well anymore. I’d like to buy some new trousers. Shirts, too.” He lapsed into silence, but the witch didn’t seem surprised at all by his confession. All she did was chuckle,
Harry takes to inspecting the rooms he didn’t pay much attention to the day before. He looks through the bathroom cupboards — much better stocked than his both in general toiletries and everyday potions. He turns the shower head on just to check the pressure and is left in wonder at the steady spray, questioning how they managed it, if this is indeed the same Grimmauld Place with its shitty Wizarding plumbing from centuries ago.
It's another one of Malfoy's signature slow kisses that leaves Harry feeling like he could melt and when Malfoy starts to pull away Harry can't resist grabbing his shirt and pulling him in again for another.
“Merlin forbid,” Harry responded, standing. He offered Draco his hand, and helped him into a standing position. A small flick of his wand cast a Growing Charm over the material, and Draco was finally – mercifully – able to do up his trousers.
“Nothing wrong with being prepared, dearie,” Molly said, nodding her approval at Harry. “Are the pair of you planning to live together at Grimmauld Place?” she pondered, “Harry, I know you said you wanted to change the guest room into a suite for the baby?”
“Mummy, you keep referring to the baby as a her,” he commented, scraping a final spoonful of the deliciousness onto his spoon, “and mentioning your granddaughter. You do realise that Harry and I won’t find out the gender until the twenty-week appointment. We don’t know who they are yet.”
Malfoy sits down and pours himself a cup of tea as if he's pouring for the queen, all straight backed posture and not a clink and then serves himself a crepe, fixing it with peevish care, smoothing on just the right amount of clotted cream, arranging his oranges just so, drizzling the honey with a ridiculous flourish. Harry watches the process trying not to laugh. Malfoy looks up from his carefully arranged crepe and clicks his tongue, looking irritably over at Harry.
