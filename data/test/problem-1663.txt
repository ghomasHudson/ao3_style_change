He reached out a tentative hand, clasping Harry’s in his own. Harry’s head snapped up to meet his eyes, fear reflected in them.
“He doesn’t even trust us,” Ron said. “Because we tried to convince him in the forest to let Draco be and rest finally. He hasn’t even let us talk to him. I’ve never seen him like this.”
Nodding, Draco took his hand. “That would be wise. Let’s leave out the back. Do you have your invisibility cloak?”
“This is where I died,” Harry said. “Which means Draco should be…” Harry trailed off and walked directly to the spot that he was staring at, knowing in his bones that was where Draco would be.
He was required to come back to Hogwarts for his eighth year as part of his probation (although he couldn’t imagine why. If it were up to Draco, he would try and cut off all magical education of someone who he perceived as his enemy but it was probably just so they could keep a close eye on him). Unfortunately, none of his friends had come back except Pansy and she was piled under studies. They were still great friends, of course—they were practically all the other had. But even they both had to admit that they needed a break from the other’s theatrics every now and then. There were times that being drama queens went perfect together and times that it just made them both frustrated.
“Oh, well, dear," Pomfrey began. "You haven't missed much then. It could have been much worse. You've only missed a handful of months—less than a year, even. In fact—“
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know, Parkinson.”
“Much better, thank you, now that—“ He cut himself off abruptly. What was wrong with his voice? Why was it so.... "What's going on?"
At that, Harry began laughing and it was hard and genuine and contagious.
Harry blew out a breath. “We broke up last week.”
Potter gave no response, so Draco finally turned around. And there was Harry Potter, sitting on his broom, but holding a second broom in one of his hands.
we’re getting fairly close to the end of the fic folks!!! thats exciting!!!! We have 18, 19, and 20 to wrap things up and then chapter 21 will be an epilogue!
“Did you say something about you teaching at Hogwarts?”
Still avoiding those piercing eyes, Draco responded. “The memory was triggered by a conversation I was having. It was involved my mother and the conversation began to steer her way and I remembered it. It was also a memory with a severe emotional attachment, as I was very distressed in the creating of it. It seemed to come from the past year or two. Is there any other information you might need, Ms. Topfeld?”
“Lumos.”
After the door closed behind her, Harry hopped up and staggered over to the chair closer to Draco. “Anyway, where were we? I feel like of weird because now I know so much about you and you know nothing about me so....What do you want to know?”
“But, Draco, how—“

was Snape thinking just handing over what is literally the most powerful wand of all time to Voldemort himself?”
She bit a nail before speaking. “When I was polyjuiced as Draco, Narcissa came and spoke to me. She doesn’t trust her sister and neither does Snape but Narcissa was talking about some meeting that I—Draco—would have to attend later. Luckily, I was able to fake my way out of it until it was time for the real Draco to be back, but if he is supposed to be attending a meeting, then that means they’re going to be using him somehow. And we already went to visit him twice and it would be a tad suspicious if we went again. So the only way we have to contact him…is Potter.”
“Says you, Slytherin Prince.” Harry said, not-quite mockingly. “You always look like you’re brooding. I just look stupid.”
the time, do I?”
“You haven’t seen my dancing skills.” Harry laughed. “I’m rather dreadful at it.” He ran a hand through his hair, only making it fluffier, “Besides it’d be weird to go with ‘Mione. She’s my friend but like…I dunno.” Harry gave Draco a weird look and shook his head slightly. “I’m just glad you’re not calling her that filthy word anymore.”
tomorrow and he’d be in the spotlight again because somehow he always managed to get involved in every single thing that could possibly put him in danger.
“I don’t think they would’ve let Fleur’s sister die.”
“Are you up for another swimming lesson? Or do you just want to sit tonight?” Draco asked.
“You definitely do.” Harry laughed. “You always look like you’re frowning.”
Harry was worried. Or as worried as he seemed to ever get about these kinds of things. He’d written to Sirius the week before, and his godfather had started sending him owls daily. Harry was working on spells with Ron and Hermione, getting ready for the third task. As with the previous two tasks, he just hoped that he wouldn’t die.
“Not when I got smacked on the ground!” Draco exclaimed. Then he did a double take. “Hey, that’s the first time you’ve said my name.”
It was short, and it was stupid, and Harry told Malfoy’s owl to leave. He shoved the letter in his desk drawer, beside other scraps of letters he’d started but never sent.
Going to be entirely honest, I don't like this chapter, I'm not happy with it. :( But i'm done fussing over it because I want to keep this story going, but I'm sorry if it sucks anyway. I'm uploading another chapter tonight though, and I like that one much better haha. I hope you're all doing well. I've been slammed with schoolwork and have been dealing with some minor health issues, but I'm okay! Thanks as always for reading! Comments mean the world <3
“It’s not like that at home? It’s more…predictable?”
“Exactly what I said. Come on then, I need to get some sleep before tomorrow.” Harry was still grinning as they got to their feet, making their way back to the Castle. At the edge of the Forest Draco paused.
“You could say so.”
“The mermaids don’t come this close to shore, idiot. If you said this task includes the mermaids, you’re going to have to swim.” Draco said sternly. He was farther out in the water, though not by much. He dived beneath the water and made his way back to Harry, popping up right in front of the smaller boy. He held back the urge to splash Harry in the face.
“Still,” Draco said. “It was more than most people would do.” They sat down. The grass was cold. It would snow tomorrow, it was inevitable. “What are you going to do?”
“Damn right I don’t! I’ve got no clue what’s in this water. There could be some kind of magical jellyfish or something in here that’ll kill me.” Harry threw his hands up, slightly exasperated.
“Who’s Cedric? Your boyfriend?” Dudley would laugh, “Is magic making you a faggot now?” and then he would hit him in the arm, or kick him in the shin, however he felt Harry should be punished. That comment of Dudley’s began a new series of nightmares for Harry.
) and looked down at his feet, clad in green slippers. He felt stupid. Potter wasn’t doing anything except look mopey and look like he was meditating.
Draco opened his mouth to answer when Filch walked right past them, merely feet away from where they stood.
“Pansy’s a lesbian?” Harry asked.
Draco was there the next night by the lake when Harry sat down at the shoreline, not bothering to even glance at the blond. Draco was there the next night and the next, and Harry was too, sitting on the shore, silent besides occasionally sticking his feet into the water.
Comments mean the world! <3
“If you want to be, I wouldn’t mind.”
“Potter – and I’m asking this genuinely – what the
“How am I supposed to face a murderer if I can’t even say his name?” Harry looked up from the ground, and
“For ditching you. With everything going on. I did promise to teach you how to swim.”
“Of course not,” Hermione opened up another book, “they live here. They’ll probably be protecting something though, like the dragons were. I think Harry would just have to get past them.”
“I’m fine, guys, honestly. I just need to catch up on my sleep this weekend I suppose.”
“I’m messing with you, Potter.” Draco laughed. “I’m taking Pansy. Millicent is still unawares of dear Pansy’s affections, so she’s stuck going with me for now.”
Draco Malfoy felt weird again. He felt like he was intruding, as he had felt before, so why had he followed Potter when he saw him heading for the Lake again? He stood beside a tree (he was wary of settling in, he didn’t want Potter to see him,
Harry finally chipped in, “Technically, I didn’t
Draco crossed his arms and frowned. “Of course I will, you git.”
They made their way through the woods, wands lit up in their hands. Harry grinned. “You know there’s a giant spider living in here right?”
Harry looked bewildered, “
“Do you know who you’re taking to the Ball?”
“I don’t like going home either, Malfoy. I’m not judging you.” Harry pulled his knees to his chest and wrapped his arms around himself. He looked down. If Malfoy was lying about being his friend, now would be the time for him to laugh. But he didn’t.
Draco was not nearly as sneaky as he thought he was. He’d figured that out as soon as Potter had opened his mouth. Potter hadn’t even had to turn around to know he was there, dammit, and why had he even decided to follow him in the first place? It was stupid, Potter wasn’t doing a thing, and Draco felt like an idiot for sneaking out multiple nights in a row now to try and catch him again. He wouldn’t sneak out again, not to risk getting caught, or for the dumb task of following around Harry Potter. Draco kicked off his slippers and settled into his bed, closing his eyes tight.
Harry shook his head, smiling a bit. “It just seems to be what comes with being Harry Potter.”
“Oh.” Harry shrugged. “I hadn’t really thought about it.”
“In all of this world of magic, no one ever seems to give anyone a straight answer. At least at home, with Muggles, they usually tell you what they want, and you do it, and that’s the end of it.” Harry tore a blade of grass in two, “Here you’ve got to listen to the dips and curves of what people mean underneath all their nonsense words, and you’ve got to hope you know what you’re doing, and hope for the best.”
“You’ve figured it out this time, I can tell. You’re grinning a bit.” Draco said when Harry sat down beside him that same night.
“My mother sent me a letter.” Draco said quietly.
“Of course.”
“I’m afraid of dying. It doesn’t matter who does it.”
The first task would be coming soon.
“Sure,” Draco stood, “why not?” He was in his pajamas. They were both in their pajamas. “We can use a drying charm,” Draco said, “quit worrying. Honestly.” Draco looked around at where they were. “We ought to go deeper into the Forest a bit, the water’s not deep enough here unless you get quite far from the shore. Come on.”
“Well, we weren’t able to make the train, you see. So we borrowed Mr. Weasley’s flying car. Just so happened that we managed to crash into the Whomping Willow. Later second year we went into the forest, investigating about the whole Chamber business, and there was the car. We nearly got eaten by a whole gang of giant spiders, you know.”
Harry asked the serpent.
Draco had left the dungeons again. He had gone to the Owlery. His mother had sent him a letter that morning – a letter that made him feel rather uneasy – and he’d finally written a response, when he realized that everyone else was asleep, and he was alone in his bed, still in his weekend clothes, holding several pieces of parchment with paragraphs scratched out and his wand glowing in his lap. He didn’t want to wait until morning to send his letter – it felt important, somehow, that he respond as quickly as he could to his mother. His father was out on business right now, he knew, and his father quite liked to read Draco’s letters to his mother (though Draco always wished he wouldn’t. If he wanted to write to his father, he would).
He thought back to last year, to how happy he’d been when he’d though that he’d seen his father across the lake from him and Sirius, casting the stag Patronus, only to find out it’d been him. And while he was glad he was able to produce a Patronus at all, glad he’d been able to save himself and Sirius both, he couldn’t help but feel the crushing disappointment of not really seeing his father. He missed his parents, even if he couldn’t remember them. He remembered the Mirror of Erised form first year, pictured his parents standing behind him, their hands on his shoulders, smiling and proud.
He knows its unhealthy to still obsess of this toxic disease he calls his ex, but still. Love is love. Its hasn't evaporated and Draco is high from the feeling.
Maybe he really does care about me,
He looks up at me for what feels like a lifetime. Harry wipes his face and takes a sip of the water I put in front of him. Then he tells me. Everything. And my heart breaks for the millionth time. And I think there is so much pain. Im not sure if I can stop it.
''Well come on in boys, we love company.'' Said the brunette , the blonde just giggled. Harry and Ron exchanged smirks and made their way into the houses, ready for a wild and obscene rest of the night.
''Bloody hell Ron i don't need another reason to come home late,'' Harry laughed at his friend while not putting the thought out of his head. A couple random chicks to shag and dispose soon after is probably something he needed anyways. ''Oh come on you know you want too! I heard that blonde chick is willing to do anything in bed,'' Ron smirks and the black haired boy shook his head.
Little did Draco know, it was the exact opposite.
His mother was getting worse. She'd call his name twice in a day for a glass of water and a bottle of rum. Never for a real meal. Draco had tried to make her eat some soup he'd cooked for her yesterday but she harshly refused and told him to get out. His father almost never comes to check on them. Draco thinks he's left them. His mother pretends that she doesn't remember being married to Lucius. It's all a mess that cant be cleaned up. Just like Draco. A island of despair that had long been forgotten. Forgotten by everything, nothing really matters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                So he turned over on his bed and sighed. Then he promised himself one thing. He'd be gone by December.
''when i opened the gym door, you should have seen those fucks run, poured a full clip, in the back i've got some,''
And life isn’t fair. The world is so ugly, so cruel. And maybe neither of us will be okay. But he’s here with me right now. And he loves me. And I was wrong this whole time, partially. I’m fucked up, but so is he. And maybe that can be enough. Or maybe him being here is a mistake. That doesn’t matter right now. He’s on my couch, and he’s looking at me. And i think this is the first time i’ve felt alright in a long time.
“i don’t feel any shame, i won’t apologize, when there ain’t nowhere you can go.”
"my head is above the rain and roses,"
I don't know why it took so long to get back home, ''
''All I have now are memories
Draco's dad had dropped him off at the house hours ago and just drove away afterwards. He had no idea where he was going, but frankly, Daco didn't care. After checking on his mother, who was sound asleep in her bed with a bottle of rum next to her- he went into his room and started at the walls. Over thinking. As usual.
“i think that god is moving its tongue”
I walk very quietly to the front door, holding in my breath the entire time it takes me to get there. I look through the peephole and my heart drops. It’s fucking you. It’s you. What the fuck are you doing here? Are you going to hurt me? I sigh, grabbing the door handle and slowly opening it. “Harry...” I whisper. Anger bubbles in my chest but the butterflies in my stomach overpower it.
Then he started to run.
The dreams that constantly conquer my mind and tear my thoughts apart; keep coming back.
The shivering boy stands up from his messy bed and walks slowly to his bathroom. Each step of his feeling heavier and heavier. Locking the door behind him, Draco glances at himself in the mirror and cries harder. "What have i become?" He whispered aloud to himself.
I’m taken aback completely. Opening the door wider, I get a better look at him, and he’s shuffling a lot. The boy almost looks innocent, vulnerable even. Draco can’t help but think that he looks adorable right now. Then he remembers. “If you don’t give a damn about me then why’d you wait outside my house for so long?” He spat. Harry doesn’t show any emotion on his face now. He almost looks tired. Draco ruffles his fingers through his hair and sighs. “Why are you doing this to me. Why do you treat me so badly? Why do you ignore me and call me names? Huh? Why do you let your asshole friends use me as their own personal punching bag? What happened to you?” Draco persisted. Harry looks up at Draco for what seems like forever. Then he does something Draco would have never thought he’d ever do in front of him. Harry broke down crying.
''Oh for for fucks sake, fine, lets go.'' Harry gave in and followed his red haired friend down the street to their houses. Harry honestly wanted to just go by himself with the two of them but he couldn't disrespect Ron that way- he'd share.
Draco puts away his pen and notepad with a heavy sigh coming out of chest. Daily poetry you can call it i guess. It helps relieve some of the pain that piles up in his lungs.
Then may my bones break
Flat on my face
''But if I fall
Draco walked into his class room ten minutes earlier than everyone. If he didn't, he'd have to face the anxiety of coming in with the class from the cafeteria. It would be a nightmare. His heart raced in his chest as he thought about it. He walked over to his seat and slumped down, sinking low. Pulling out a book, he pretended to read until the class got back and tried to look invisible as possible.
Draco's pov -
Harry's Pov - It was three thirty in the morning. Ron had left him shortly after he gotten finished with the brunette girl and reminded him to wear a rubber. Although Harry was having a rather fun time, the weirdest thought came to his head. Almost as if it was gently planted into the front of his mind. A blonde, almost silvery blonde, boy. A boy that Harry used to rather fond of. That is until his Uncle Vernon found out. The abuse Harry received from his Uncle, why it was enough to make any person go mad. It was all Draco's fault. And in Harry's mind, that was completely true. The bloody fag convinced him to kiss him, convinced him to believe that what they were doing was ok, convinced him that he lov-, well you get the idea. He couldn't stand thinking about it. He couldn't stand thinking that he had been with a boy. Draco was an abomination, just like his Uncle had told Harry. At first, Harry wanted to be with Draco on the low, He thought that maybe they could keep it a secret and no one would find out. But when Harry's Uncle noticed his nephew coming home smelling like men's cologne and scattered in love bites, he payed it no mind. Until Harry was dumb enough to trace Draco's name into his hand with pen and Vernon finally lost it. Harry was so bruised and weak that he didn't come to school for two weeks. When Harry had returned to school, Draco ran up to him asking if he was okay. Harry was so brainwashed and damaged at that point that his only emotion was hate. He threw Draco off of him, causing a scene in the hallways. He then proceeded to punch Draco with all his might, calling him the most disgusting names he could think of. After that Draco left Harry alone. But Harry was not finished with him at all. He would have his friends corner him and beat him up almost everyday, just for fun. He'd told almost half the school that Draco was a fag and tried to force himself onto him after school one day. That was a lie. Harry didn't care anymore. In his eyes, Draco ruined his life. And he would make him pay.
“I swear I’m not following you.” A voice said. “Alright, I admit that’s a lie. I did follow you this time, you seemed like – ”
“And not keep you in suspense? Please.” Harry turned to Draco and smiled sadly. “I’ll be fine.”
“Sure, and I know how to swim.”
about the tournament now. He hadn’t wanted to be a part of it in the first place, and now it was just another thing he had to get through.
breath. Harry gasped for air a bit. He was used to holding his breath somewhat, sure, but not under water. He kicked his feet quickly to keep himself above the surface.
“Please do that for me at least.” Draco said. Harry wasn’t sure what Draco meant by that.
“Laugh. Isn’t it like a Malfoy family gene to always look angry?”
“Yep.” Harry replied, picking up a small stone from the sand and skipping it twice before it fell into the Lake. Draco went back to reading his book in the light of the moon.
And that night Harry found himself following Draco Malfoy through the woods so that he could learn how to swim.
“Yeah.” Harry smiled. “Why not?”
Draco had been making his way back toward the dungeons when he saw Harry Potter sneaking out of Gryffindor Tower, yet again.
Harry woke later, Ron shaking him awake. Harry froze under Ron’s grip. “C’mon mate, we’ve got to get to class.”
“Fine, we can go back to the shore, but I’m going to do it properly, with my head underwater.”
“Hm. Maybe. But most of the time you’re all dark and angry looking.”
He didn’t want them asking about why he couldn’t sleep, or about his midnight walks. They’d just nag him and assume it was something to do with Voldemort, because everything was always about Voldemort, and saving the school, or wizarding kind, or the world, or whatever. And Harry didn’t want to tell them that he kept having nightmares about his home, because what would they say to him then? He didn’t want to talk about it. He sat with everyone at breakfast, ate his toast and let himself fall into the group’s natural camaraderie.
“I suppose. They don’t like me having power that they don’t have.”
“Yeah.” said Harry.
He didn’t know why he didn’t say anything to Ron or Hermione about the night before. Well, no, that wasn’t exactly true. He knew
“I didn’t think you could do it.” Harry said, forcing a straight face.
. He didn’t like to think that people would think of him as being off in some way. Still, he didn’t like them idolizing him either.
Really? Like, right now?”
“So you decide to tell me about this group of spiders
“Who’re you gonna ask to the Ball?” Ron asked him after class, “Merlin, who am I going to ask to the Ball?”
“Rough night then?” Draco asked.
“It’s pretty late.” Harry said. “Want to head back?”
“Draco,” Harry spoke, his voice so, so quiet, “You’re allowed to be afraid of your father. He’s not a good person. I’m afraid of my family too – they’re not good people. You don’t have to love him because he’s your father. You don’t have to force yourself to feel a way that you don’t feel. If you’re afraid, you’re afraid, and it’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
“We’re at a lake, aren’t we? I can teach you.”
If you have any predictions or ideas for this story please let me know! I'm very open to ideas as I'm still writing it (and if I use your idea, I'll credit you of course!) This is my first time uploading a fic to ao3, so I'm hoping the formatting and everything is okay. Kudos and comments are appreciated :)
They were in the Forest. They were laying down, side by side, looking up into the trees. The stars were still visible, even through all the leaves. Draco didn’t seem to care too much about dirt anymore.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry shrugged. “I’ll live.”
Draco dove beneath the surface of the water, when Harry finally started to use his other arm to go against the water. He kicked his feet. He was slow, and clumsy, but he was doing it. Draco went up for
Harry hoped Ron would figure it out for the both of them. He really didn’t want to garner any more attention than he already did.
“I’m getting used to his attempts on my life. He’s not going to stop. And I’m not going to waste my time being scared of him. He wants me dead, but he doesn’t hate me for any reason other than he couldn’t kill me. It’s not personal for him, not really.” Harry went back to looking at the grass.
“That sounds a lot like he’d have to fight them.”
“What?” Harry asked, surprised.
“I don’t think I believe you.” Harry did believe him. “So why don’t you piss off back to your common room,” He curled his lip, in a way he never had to anyone before, “and don’t follow me again, or I won’t be nearly so nice.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry hadn’t thought he’d ever take dancing lessons. Yet here he was, with all the other Gryffindor boys, crowded in a classroom as Professor McGonagall taught them how to dance. Harry’s movements were clumsy; he moved either too slow or too fast. He was not a good dancer.
“…And that means?”
Instead of looking over at the Gryffindor table, Draco would eat a little, quickly, before leaving the dining hall with Pansy. But its not like Harry was paying that much attention of course. Why would he?
“My mother hasn’t written me back.” Draco met Harry’s eyes. Silver to green.
“No. You’re right,” said Draco. “Don’t make promises you can’t keep.”
“I mean, I’m your friend. You’re telling me.”
Harry Potter had damaged hands. It wasn’t noticeable at a glance, but if you took a longer look, it was there. On his left hand he had a scar on the skin between his thumb and finger, and his palm had a rough texture from the burns, courtesy of Petunia. On his right, his knuckles had healed over many times from being lashed. On both hands his fingernails had been gnawed just above the quick. He didn’t like to make himself bleed, but he couldn’t help biting his nails.
“I’m sorry.”
“In a way, yeah.”
“I always thought –”
“Right, of course,” said Ron, “Harry, you look like you’ve been in a tussle with a dementor.”
“From who? And where?”
“Not today, I don’t think.” said Harry, “It’s a bit much, and I’ve got to go back to the dorm before bedtime. Everyone’s been talking to me again; I can’t have them worry. I told them I have detention with Snape.”
suggest leaving, or I’ll throw you into the lake next.” Harry still had a rock in his hand.
He couldn’t keep his eyes shut against the pain, and he knew what was going to happen next, as soon as Wormtail said the word
“I suppose.”
Draco’s eyes were ever-so slightly wide. Like tiny silver moons, his eyes shone in the light of their wands. “You – of course you can say my name…Harry.” He said. “It’s just weird. I dunno. But I like it, I think.”
“Hate magic?” He seemed disgusted that anyone could ever hate magic, or a world that he’s a part of. “Are they jealous of you, then?”
“Why’d you leave in the first place?” Harry asked, immediately wishing he hadn’t – he didn’t even know if it was his place to ask.
Draco smirked, “Are you asking me?”
“No!” Harry exclaimed, his cheeks warm.
Harry pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose (a habit, as they’d always been a little too big) and replied, “As okay as always.”
He watched Harry sit down at the edge of the Lake, clutching his knees to his chest while he looked out at the water. Harry Potter took many shaky breaths before seemingly managing to calm down. He tucked his chin and looked down, looked at his dirty feet covered in dirt and sighed. He didn’t know what he was doing – didn’t know if there was anything he could do. He was nothing more than a Golden Boy for the Wizarding World, nothing more than a dancing monkey for Dumbledore and a slave to the Dursleys. He reached forward and dipped a finger into the cold surface of the Lake, watching the ripples go out until he couldn’t see them anymore.
“You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to.” Harry said softly into Draco’s hair. “But you’re going to be okay. I’m with you.”
The snake had green scales and black eyes that glittered under the moon.
“I know mermaids are involved.” Harry said.
Heavy footsteps paired with delicate ones made their way down the hall – Filch and his demonic cat Mrs. Norris. “I hear you kids! I’ll have you scraping beneath the tables in the Great Hall for sneaking out,” Filch’s slimy voice echoed, his cat mewing as he finished speaking, like she was all too pleased to be involved in hunting down children for detention.
“Why do you hate going home?” Draco asked him.
“I would tell you that she’s fine, but I can’t promise that.” said Harry, cringing inwardly as soon as he’d said it. What he’d said was hardly comforting.
“No.” Harry said, picking at the grass. “Why would they? No one tells anyone anything here.”
Draco charmed them both clean and dry when they made it back to land. “That sucked.” Harry said.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco cast a warming charm on himself. “It’s going to snow soon.” He said.
They're finally starting to open up more to each other...more will come, though. I'm thinking of extending this fic past 4th year, MAYBE writing the rest of the series?? I don't know, but if you guys would like that let me know! I have some ideas in the works if I do. I wrote this chapter in a bit of a frenzy last night, so hopefully there aren't too many mistakes I missed in editing. Also sorry that this chapter is short! I'm hoping to write longer chapters in the future but we'll see lol.
“It’s boring. You know what’s going to happen, everyone dies, or someone kills their wife or their husband or someone or other is a ghost. So why bother reading it?”
“I never said that I…” Draco turned back around to look at Harry, who was already small, making himself smaller by curling his body in on itself as much as possible. “You don’t have to tell me about it, if you don’t want to.”
He’d fallen asleep, though not for long, as it was still terrifically dark outside when he opened his eyes again. A small snake was curled around his ankle, though not constricting, Harry was curious as to what the thing was doing.
Ron shrugged, “Alright then, ‘Mione. What do you suggest?”
Draco opened his mouth as if to say something but closed it as Harry continued.
“I do not!”
It wasn’t until later that next morning Harry heard about the other schools coming to visit for a so-called “special event.” He just hoped that he wouldn’t be involved.
“Better than a textbook,” Harry grinned, “I can’t keep my eyes open to read a textbook.”
“What?” Harry looked at the blond. Draco’s eyes were silver. Harry had never noticed before. “What was it about?”
Hello! Sorry, this chapter is coming later than I expected. I had a lot of schoolwork to do, plus I had a flare up from my chronic pain, so I've had a bit of a week if you know what I mean haha. I hope you're all doing well, and that you like this chapter! Please let me know what you think!! Comments mean the world to me <3
“To be me?” They were sitting face to face on the Forest floor, each of them sitting with their legs crossed, their wands lit up beside them. Harry rubbed his neck, “Honestly, I’d rather be normal. Normal for a wizard at least. It’s not super fun to almost die every year.”
Warning for some homophobic language and violence
It’s difficult, avoiding your hands. Avoiding your body, really. Harry didn’t like to change his clothes, he didn’t like showering, but he didn’t like suspicion either. What would people think if he was always moping around in the same clothes, looking a wreck? Sure, his hair was usually messy anyway, but he didn’t want anyone to start noticing anything…
I know there's child abuse in the tags of this story, but I still thought I'd give a warning! Child abuse is briefly referenced in this chapter.
It took a half hour to get Draco to fully calm down. Draco had folded up the letter and put it into his pocket – he didn’t show it to Harry. They were sitting next to one another now, Draco looking at the grass and Harry looking at Draco.
Dudley kept pestering him. Kept laughing at him. Harry had been waking up screaming and at first his uncle had given him a good whack for it, but he must’ve given up after the first two weeks of it. He certainly wasn’t pleased with Harry’s nightmares though – he kept giving Harry extra chores to “make up” for all the troubled sleeping he was causing everyone else in the house. As if Harry himself was sleeping very well.
He would imagine the conversation. Or rather, a lack of conversation. In his dreams he would shake Draco by the shoulders, slam a fist into his jaw much like his uncle had done him, leave his lips bloody and trembling. His hands would be covered in Draco’s blood, and still the blond would take his hand and kiss his bleeding knuckles. And Harry would hit him again, right in the damned mouth. He would do it without saying a word. If Draco tried to speak, the blood pouring against his tongue would gag him enough to stop his words from making sense and Harry would feel like he’d finally won against something, for the first time. He never felt like he ever fucking won, except in this fucking dream, a blond boy bleeding in his arms.
“What you think he’ll have to fight them, too?”
me anything – she never does, but she told me not to write her back and I feel like I’ve somehow gotten her into trouble.” He spoke quickly, his voice shaky, “My father is always reading the mail, I don’t know how, but I must’ve said something to upset him – she must be angry with me, if I’ve gotten her into trouble with him –”
“They haven’t told you anything at all?”
“My family…” Harry started to say, sitting up.
.” Draco confirmed. “I don’t know if I like it yet.”
“Really?” Draco turned back to Harry.
“I’m sorry your family is awful to you Harry.”
Harry shook his head. “Nah. You just look like you.”
“I’m not gonna judge you if that’s what you’re thinking.”  Harry studied Draco’s hair. It was almost fiery in the setting sun.
Draco looked at him sideways. “You’re right. There’s power in names.”
“Don’t apologize to me for something neither of us can fix. It’s going to be okay. You’re going to be okay.” Harry squeezed his hand.
This is a 4th year au. Most events will be aligned with canon, though of course there's going to be Draco and Harry. Trigger warnings in case you didn't read the tags: this story is a lot about Harry's child abuse, my interpretation of it (mixed in with some personal experience) and how he learns to deal with it when he has a friend (Draco) who's gone through similar experiences.
Harry laughed, “Moody turned you into a ferret, and getting to see that kinda makes up for it.”
I didn't expect to be updating so soon, but with the current worldwide quarantine going on, I've got a decent amount of time to write and edit. I have some classes online, and I suffer from chronic pain, so I can't say how regularly I'll be updating, but I plan on updating whenever I can, as long as you all keep reading! I'll be uploading another chapter tonight, and if all goes well I should update again before the end of the week. :) Also, a HUGE thank you to everyone who has commented and left kudos so far! You all give me the encouragement to keep writing and updating, it means a lot <3
They sat in silence for a long time.
Filch and Mrs. Norris left the corridor, and Harry pushed Draco out from under the cloak before racing back to Gryffindor Tower, glad he’d brought his cloak, because he didn’t want that blonde bastard to see him run.
, if he could hardly handle being dragged into a broom closet for an interview without freaking out, how was he going to handle fighting Voldemort? He knew he’d have to, eventually. Magic was going to kill him after all, and he was sure that Voldemort would be the one to do it. Harry wasn’t expecting to make it to adulthood. At least with the Tournament, maybe a mermaid would kill him before Voldemort did. Then the bastard wouldn’t get the satisfaction of taking down the one person he hadn’t been able to kill.
He and Cedric had both grasped the handle of the Triwizard Cup. And then Harry’s scar was burning, and then a green light and Cedric was nothing more than a limp body in front of him and Harry thought he was screaming but he couldn’t be sure. He was slammed into a giant tombstone (with Tom Riddle’s fucking name on it) by Wormtail. The bastard shoved black cloth into Harry’s mouth, effectively muffling his screams before he disappeared.
Harry shushed him, took Draco by the arm and sat them both down. “Breathe.” Harry told him. Draco did, in and out, until he could compose himself enough to speak.
said Harry,
“I can’t swim.” Harry said. “I never learned.”
“It’s been months. I haven’t written her, and she hasn’t written me.” Draco said.
“Well, they hate magic.” Harry looked over at Draco, who’s eyes widened.
“You ought to go to the hospital wing, Harry, I’m sure Madame Pomfrey could get you some Sleeping Draught if it’s keeping you up.” Hermione took a bite of her eggs. “You’re not gonna survive the Second Task if you can’t stay awake!”
The rest of the week was rather boring for Harry – though he didn’t know why he’d expected any kind of excitement. As fun as magic was, and nice as it was to think about how to turn a sewing needle into a hedgehog, Harry was still bored. It seemed like the glow Hogwarts had had was gone, like it wasn’t quite a getaway from home, not with all the responsibility the Wizarding World put on his shoulders to be their Boy Who Lived. It was better than home in the sense that he knew the likelihood of him getting beaten for dropping something was slim, but worse in the way that it was unpredictable. At least at home he knew he’d get beaten if he dropped a plate. Here, he never knew was to expect, what danger could be lurking to try and kill him, as something always seemed to do year after year.
Harry had slept for two hours at least, before he’d woken up from a nightmare. He’d had a nightmare the night before too, but he was apprehensive to leave, considering Malfoy had followed him the night before. He’d ended up only managing to toss and turn all night, not getting a moment’s more rest. It’d been two days now though, so Harry figured he should be alright (though he kept glancing around the corridors in fear of being found by teachers or Malfoy). Harry thought about going to the Quidditch pitch, but it was far too open, and the full moon was too bright – he didn’t want to be spotted. So Harry made his way to the Great Lake again.
“I do
“Not really.” said Harry. “I don’t think I’ll die. But if I do, what’s it matter? I’m a martyr for them anyway, they’d just be pissed it wasn’t Voldemort who did it.”
Draco put his hands on his hips, “It would be nicer to have a pool, I’ll admit. I’m not a huge fan of mud.”
The snakes uncoiled and went back into the grass,
Draco held up his hands, “Look, I can piss off if you really want me to. It just looked like your Weasel and Granger didn’t want to talk to you.”
“Yeah.” Draco said quietly, staring at the moon’s reflection in the Lake, “I do.”
Comments and kudos mean the world! <3
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey!” Draco frowned, “I was hoping you would never bring that up!”
Harry was in the Common Room. It was evening, the fireplace was warm, and Harry and his friends were on the floor in front of it, doing their homework. Harry was lying on his stomach, head propped on one hand while the other was mindlessly scribbling nonsense for a Charms essay. Ron and Hermione were squabbling over something or another – probably Ron trying to get some homework answers out of Hermione so that he wouldn’t have to open his textbook. Harry wondered what Draco was doing. He supposed he could ask him later that night.
“We’re friends now, Draco, I think I should be allowed to laugh at you getting turned into a ferret.”
They managed to get dates to the ball – the Parvarti twins. The Ball was awful – Harry hardly talked to his date, Ron made Hermione cry, and Harry felt useless. It wasn’t just the embarrassment of having to dance in front of the whole school, it was everything about the standard he was being held to. He was fourteen, he was competing with a bunch of older kids for a stupid Tournament he didn’t want to be a part of, and everyone had their eye on him while he managed to fuck up.
“Why did you kiss me?” He would ask, calmly, evenly (at least the first time he dreamt it). And Draco would do it again; would try to hold his hand, or kiss him on the lips and Harry would wake up in a sweat unsure of what he was going to do because if he’d learned much from his family, he’d learned that homosexuality was the worst crime he could ever commit, worse than murder. As much as they hated him now, he didn’t know what they’d do if they found out he’d kissed a boy. Or rather – a boy had kissed him.
“You don’t look stupid.” Harry turned to give Draco a deadpan look. “Okay, you look tired, but I don’t think you look stupid.” Draco said. “People probably just think you’re stressed and – wait. I do not look like I’m brooding
The water was cold, and he’d had to swallow a disgusting amount of gillyweed, but Harry was in the water, and he was swimming. The swimming lessons had paid off. He wasn’t fast, but he was able, and he made his way through the murky water until he saw flashes of green scales. The mermaids followed him, with their giant eyes and razor-like teeth, and hands elongated like claws. He made it through. He managed to get Ron and the girl with the white hair – Fleur’s sister, he’d come to find out. He made the points, despite going overtime. He might not lose this Tournament after all.
In his dreams he would slam Draco against a wall and kiss him. He was so angry, and so hurt, and he would take the boy’s pale body in his arms and bury his face in the taller boy’s chest. Draco would reach down, tip up his chin and Harry would kiss him, right on the mouth that he so wished he could smother, suffocate. He thought of shoving a hand down Draco’s throat, crushing his windpipe from the inside out. He thought of Draco breaking his arms and legs and leaving him still breathing in a graveyard, unburied.
Harry walked through the corridor, his cloak over him, and he glanced down the hall leading to the dungeons before making his way back out to the Lake. He wondered if Malfoy was still trying to follow him around. He sat against the tree he’d seen Malfoy leaning on that first night, pulled his knees to his chest, and looked up at how the moonlight bled through the tree leaves.
I'd like to give a big thank you to every single person who's commented so far! You all have no idea how wonderful it makes me feel to hear your praise and excitement over a little story I've written.
“Every day they would remind me that they didn’t want me – that I was just a baby dumped on their doorstep.” He took a breath. “I didn’t learn about magic until I finally got my letter for school. And my family tried everything they could to keep me from finding out. When I finally got here, I was so happy. People here were excited to see me, and it was this whole new world! I was never allowed out much as a kid, and suddenly I find out that I’m able to do all these things, in a place that seems so unreal. My first year was mostly fun, until the first attempt at my murder. Well, I suppose it was technically the second attempt Voldemort made on my life. But then it happened again second year. Third year, I suppose it wasn’t Voldemort directly, but either way, I nearly died again. This year I’ve already had my life at risk twice. Every day I wonder if I would be better off at home, I wonder what would be worse. But then, I suppose I keep coming here for a reason, either out of a sense of guilt – I’m the Wizarding World’s Golden Boy after all, they wouldn’t let me get away, and I don’t know if I would feel right in leaving it all behind. But still I’m left contemplating which is worse. I’ve come to think home is worse. At least I have people to talk to here, and some sense of freedom. I don’t have that at home.” Harry finished. Draco reached out for Harry’s hand. Harry took it.
It was a new moon that next night. Harry was telling Draco about Professor Lupin, the time-turner, and the adventure of saving Buckbeak. He told Draco about Sirius Black being his godfather, and how Peter Pettigrew had escaped that night.
” Draco exclaimed. “You crashed a flying car?”
Hermione punched Ron’s arm, “Don’t call them fish people! It’s rude.”
“Killed my parents. Yes, it’s personal from my end. But I don’t see Voldemort as a person either, so it’s a bit weird, I suppose.”
“Aren’t you afraid of him though?”
“Bit narcissistic of you, thinking just about yourself.” Harry half-joked.
How many nights in a row was Harry going to wake up in the middle of the night? It felt endless – going to classes, pretending to listen to his friends, waking up in the middle of the night only to think not about how Voldemort kept attempting to kill him, but about the time his uncle had broken his arm when he was four (and hadn’t taken him to the doctor afterwards), or when his aunt had poured hot soup he’d poorly prepared onto his hands over the sink. “Learn to cook, boy,” she had said, “Or I’ll be doing more to you than spilling soup.”
How sad was it, he thought, that his happiest memory was the first time he rode a broom? His happiest memory didn’t involve anyone else, because he avoided it. He had his friends, of course, but he kept them at a distance, still. He didn’t tell them about his family. He hadn’t told anyone until Draco had come freaking out to him in the Forest. He felt naked. He felt like he was home, and Vernon had ripped off the collar of his shirt to pull him into the study, a belt in his hand. Harry had never felt so exposed in his life, after telling someone out loud about his family – and he hadn’t even said that much. He hadn’t mentioned his broken arm, or the boiling soup, the lashings, the cupboard…
-ed his wand. It was dark, even under all those stars.
“Doesn’t your whole family look all blond and brooding though?”
“You don’t have to talk to me if you don’t want to, but you don’t own the Lake,” Draco said, “so if you don’t mind, I was going to study.” He pulled a book from his bag and sat down in the grass. Harry didn’t object and walked back over to the shore to sit by himself. What would be the point in arguing?
“Cedric may have given me a hint.” Harry replied. He was still holding the egg.
He didn’t really care about the date, or the Ball, just about what it meant. If he couldn’t do
(Also, I've realized I never introduced myself lol. My name is Nicky!)
Draco looked down at his hands. “What’s it like? Living with Muggles?”
“Dunno. It’s probably got something to do with Voldemort, I expect. But I don’t know.” Harry was fiddling with his wand, transfiguring a twig into a beetle, just for the sake of it.
“Dunno. They don’t have a lot of Muggle books in the library.”
“Are you going to tell me what the task is this time or are you going to keep it a secret again?”
“I –” Draco stuttered slightly. “I’ve been trying to…improve…with that.”
“Yeah, I would. But so would you. I’m a Malfoy and you’re the Harry Potter.” Draco paused. “It’s still weird to hear his name out loud like that though. Especially with how nonchalantly you say it.”
They walked back to the castle together.
“Yeah, I slept fine.” Harry said, running a hand through his hair, which always looked its worst in the mornings.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry I spent so much time being a jerk to you.”
Harry held out his arm to the snake, who after a moment of hesitation, made his way up Harry’s arm until he was nestled in comfortably. Harry stroked its scales until it fell asleep.
Harry Potter was, in fact, in the Gryffindor dorm. He slumped down into his bed and reveled at having a proper duvet to snuggle into. Even though he’d finally gotten a bedroom at home with the Dursley’s, they’d not really gotten him more than a cot and some old holey blankets to sleep with, so his bed in the dorm was heaven (though he made sure never to voice this sentiment, because everyone complained about the dorm beds being too old and lumpy). Harry snuggled into the duvet and tired desperately to sleep, even with his nerves firing constantly. As always, it took countless minutes for him to calm down enough to close his eyes, but he finally did fall asleep, his glasses still set on the bridge of his nose.
Harry didn’t often look at himself in the mirror. He got dressed in his pajamas in the Gryffindor bathroom after everyone else had fallen asleep. He’d stayed up late half-way trying to finish a paper for Charms (he didn’t end up finishing it) before realizing he was still in his day clothes. He only saw himself briefly as he dressed – he didn’t like to look. The boy in the mirror was thin, his brown skin was sallow, his cheeks slightly sunken. He’d always looked this way, everyone assumed it was natural. He had too, for awhile. His first year at Hogwarts he’d gained some weight from all the eating and excitement (even if he had vomited up a lot of his meals – he wasn’t used to eating so much, but he couldn’t help it…he didn’t usually get the chance) and he’d nearly glowed up until that incident with the Philosopher’s stone. That summer he’d gone back to how he’d always looked – overworked, underfed and slightly broken. And after that Hogwarts hadn’t seemed to change him nearly as much as that first year had. So when he nearly got killed time and time again, Harry was expecting it, it always happened eventually. He couldn’t hope for anything more than a death that wasn’t too painful.
“What for?” Harry was somewhat shocked that Malfoy could even say the words I’m and sorry in the same sentence, but it seemed Malfoy kept surprising him lately.
“Who else am I going to tell? Crabbe and Goyle? Please. The only friend of mine I might say anything to is Pansy, and she’s been terribly busy lately trying to get Millicent’s attention.” Harry didn’t ask what that meant.
Draco came into the woods the next night, exasperated, his face paler than usual, a piece of parchment in his hands. Harry was already there, waiting. He stood when he saw the state of Draco. “My mother wrote me.” The blond said. “She told me not to write her back. She –”
“I have my cloak.” said Harry.
“Dunno yet.” Harry admitted. Draco closed his book and set it aside.
Or rather, almost looking him straight in the eyes. Draco hadn’t realized he was a good three inches taller than Potter until now. Draco could feel some kind of fabric, soft as silk, around the two of them, and looked over to see Filch coming down the hall, looking right at them, but saying nothing. Harry’s breath was hot in such a small space. “Why the hell,” Harry whispered, “are you following me?”
“But it’s not!” Draco protested. “He must’ve done something to her – to tell me to stop writing, I –” Harry squeezed his arm, ever so slightly, and with some hesitation, leaned forward and took Draco in both of his arms. It was awkward, hugging while sitting down, Harry sort of leaning up on his knees to hold his arms around Draco while the blond bit his tongue to keep himself from crying. Malfoys don’t cry.
When they sat down for class it wasn’t until Professor Moody started talking about the Unforgiveable Curses that Harry was finally interested in what someone was saying. The Professor started with three jars of spiders on his desk, one by one showing each curse. He made the first spider dance around with the Imperious Curse, tortured the second spider until it folded in on itself with the Cruciatus Curse, and finally killed the last spider with a flash of green light as he said
“Well I’m here now.” Draco’s eyes were the strangest color at sunset – silvery and orange both at the same time. It was like looking at Christmas lights.
“So, what are we then, friends now?” Harry asked.
“I’ll see you here tomorrow, yeah?”
“Every school year I nearly die, at least second year involved a flying car, you know?” Harry shrugged, smiling a little at Draco’s absolute bewilderment.
“Draco, slow down. Please.” Harry still held onto the other boy’s arm. “Just breathe for a minute. It’s okay.”
, when we are actively going through the Forbidden Forest, and –” Draco tripped over a tree root. Harry grabbed his arm before he fell, and pulled him back to his feet. “You are such an asshole.” Draco said, “but you better tell me the rest of this story.”
Harry felt stupid, thinking to himself later that he’d been getting more enjoyment out of sneaking out at night to sit at the Lake than he did talking to his friends. He felt awful about it – Ron and his family had taken him to the World Cup, and even though that night had sucked because of Death Eaters and their fun affinity for murder, as well as Harry’s bad luck for whenever he was feeling happy something horrible had to happen – and yet he couldn’t bring himself to actually listen to anything his friend had to say. If Ron and Hermione noticed how spaced-out he’d become, they never said a thing about it. Harry hoped they wouldn’t ask or thought that perhaps he was a better actor than he gave himself credit for.
Draco walked into the clearing and sat down next to Harry. “Are you okay?” He asked.
It’d been jarring. He didn’t know what it meant or what really to think of it. And he wouldn’t get the chance to ask.
“He can’t see you, idiot.” Harry nearly spat under his breath. Why was he so angry? “So answer the damn question.”
He took of the sweater, glancing briefly into his reflection, happy to find that he’d filled out a bit. His ribs were hardly visible now. He could still feel them easily, if he pressed his finger to his side, but they weren’t grotesquely protruding like they had over the summer. It wasn’t so much that the Dursley’s starved him but rather that he rarely got the chance to eat – at least this is what Harry told himself. He walked into one of the shower stalls, the water already magically warm for him.
“How’d your name even get into the Goblet anyway?” Draco asked. It was warm in their secret alcove, but if they looked out around them far enough, they could see the snow that covered the rest of the Forest. Draco had come to the clearing wearing his scarf and a coat but took them off and set them down like a pillow beside him. He laid down in the grass, peeking over at Harry.
Harry had heard the gentle footsteps. He didn’t need to turn around to know who it was. If it were a teacher, they’d be yelling at him; if it were his friends, they would say something. He took another deep breath and spoke softly, hoping to scare the prat, “I know you’re there, Malfoy.”
“Why’re you reading regular books anyway?”
“Yeah.” Harry said. “They are.” He laid down next to Draco and looked at the constellations. The sky was clear tonight.
“Of course.”
It was an unsettling thing, to be thinking constantly about dying and yet not thinking about it at all. There were all the times he’d nearly been killed, and all the times he wished he had been. These two things overlapped, though it seemed that if it were a venn diagram, the circle for every time he wished he were dead was bigger. Or perhaps a pie chart would be a better example, he thought. Nevertheless, Harry thought a lot about his own death, how many times he’d escaped it, and how many times he often thought to embrace it. Wouldn’t it be a shame if The Boy Who Lived died? Would everyone make it a big deal like they made everything else in his life, or would they quickly find a new martyr? Harry wasn’t sure, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to think too much about it.
“No? Yes? Let’s just – forget I brought it up.”
“Just do it.” Malfoy laughed, “I can’t have people thinking I tried to drown the great Harry Potter.”
“I’d rather you told me she was fine.” Draco didn’t meet Harry’s gaze, instead inspecting the dirt on his shoes. Of course.
“How’d you know that?”
It was weeks later, and Harry had done it – he’d taken on a dragon, he’d gotten the egg, he’d managed to do it all and he wasn’t even dead. Ron had stopped being such a prick too, realizing that he should’ve believed Harry. Who would
''And I found some scars in places I have never shown to anyone
Im nothing. No matter what i wont amount to shit.
Its because i'm ugly, probably. Or stupid. Or because i'm depressed. Or the scars that line my wrists. Its all my fault.
thoughts of murder run inside my head,”
Draco sits alone in his room, cold, eerily quiet, and contemplating whether or not to keep going.
Just thinking of Draco made Harry's blood boil, so he put back on his clothes and shoes and started to walk out of his one night stands flat. Suddenly a memory appeared in Harry head. ''And you'll always love me right?'' Draco's voice said over the telephone. ''Always.'' Harry's voice responded.
I used to have a best friend,
Draco's pov
He flinched at the old nickname and sighed, putting his head in his hands. “This was a mistake. I need to leave now,” He says.
He does this almost every night.
Draco’s POV-
''im just like you, nobody loves me its driving me insane,''
Three o'clock in the morning. You're probably sleeping, and i'm crying.
He never acted like this when he and Draco were still together. But that was in the past. Harry has changed. He's not the same person he was last year. And it hurts me so much.
I wonder if he's thinking about me right now. Maybe he's wondering what im doing or if i forgive his friend that beat me up today.
Draco's pov -  When he awoke the next morning with a headache and a bad hair day he decided not to go to school. That is until his mother had told him he needed to get his education while he still could, and Draco didn't want to disappoint her. So he walked to his godforsaken highschool and skipped breakfast as soon as he saw who was in the cafeteria. Harry. Harry. Harry. The name didn't even bother Draco at this point. He'd become numb to everything he'd thought loved him. His wrists were bandaged and his sides were still a bit bruised, but he managed to make it until 6th period without crying. He ran into the restroom as soon as the bell rang, this was the class they'd had together. But Harry sat in the back now. Draco sat in the very front away from everyone who might hurt or laugh at him just for existing. So he hid in the stall for 9 minutes until he heard someone walk in. Low and behold guess who it was. ''What the fuck are you doing in the damn stall Malfoy?'' Draco was shocked and happy that Harry was actually talking to him, not paying attention to the harmful words Harry spoke to him. ''Are you just going to stand there like a bloody idiot?'' Harry asked Draco again. ''U-um no, actually i was just goi-'' All of a sudden Harry's eyes didn't seem as soft as they used to be. ''You know what? Get your queer ass the hell away from me before I waste you right here.'' Draco looked at Harry as though he might have said something hurtful back, but the words didn't escape from his mouth. Instead all he said was ''Sorry Haz.'' And quickly ran out the restroom into class. His mind a mess of confusion. He'd spoken to him.
My stomach turns and I start to feel sick. Then i open my mouth.
I seen you walking down the street from my window. I think i hate you more than i ever could have loved you. I think you’ll never know. Would have done anything for you, went to hell and back for you. All for nothing at all. You’re a parasite to me now. You won’t leave my head and the thoughts aren’t as pretty as they used to be. You will suffer. I keep telling myself you’ll ache how i ache. To make me feel better. Nothing is better. My Mum is getting worse. Father never calls. I’m failing my classes to avoid seeing you. The ceiling is still white. I picture it dripping in your blood.
Still not satisfied with the way he looked, he ruffled his hair a bit, looked at himself in the mirror, and sighed. I'll never be attractive enough. He probably has his eye on that pretty new girl in our class Hermione.
The shirt you gave me is still hanging in my closet. It still holds your scent. You threw me away and i still wear your shirt. I might burn it today. I might set your house on fire. Just to look into those eyes again. Those cold, dead eyes that aren’t yours anymore. Those eyes that don’t belong to my Harry. Your new eyes used to scare me, now i just want to rip them out of their sockets. I need to see you bleed Harry. I need you to ache like I ache.
''Are you thinking of me now?''
He just always wanted to be the one that doesn't feel invisible.Ya know? Just for once. Maybe then he'd stop pushing people away, maybe then he'll have confidence and hate himself less. It seems the world doesn't want Draco to be happy. Ultimately, he fears its going to kill him.
Draco didn’t ask who “they” were, he had a feeling he knew. He said nothing.
Draco laughed, “Maybe. But you don’t have to be so honest about it!” He smiled. “I don’t seriously look like an asshole all the time, do I?”
“Well, thanks I guess.”
Harry looked at him. “I’m glad that you’re trying.” He said, crossing his arms. “You’re so different than how I thought you were.”
“I say your name all the time, Malfoy.”
“You really need to get some sleep, Harry.” Hermione said at breakfast. “You’ve been looking tired a lot lately, but you’ve got awful dark circles now!”
Draco had never turned around so quickly, “What?”
“You think you’ll make it?”
“You know what I mean. My first name.”
“Okay.” Harry said softly. If Draco wanted to tell him anything, he would. Harry wouldn’t force it. After all, he wasn’t telling Draco about his family, why should Draco tell Harry about his?
“My father.”
“How are you?” Harry asked instead.
“Do you?” Harry looked up at the waning moon, “Do you actually hope so?”
Taking a break from quidditch for the year because of the Tournament was odd though. Despite having to be in a locker room (he’d always tried to get there first…or last) and despite having to grip his broom so tightly it irritated the skin on his already damaged palms, he did enjoy it. Maybe it was the magic of the game, or the feeling of flying; being above the ground and away from everyone else – from anything else. In the sky he was not Harry Potter, he was a player in a much smaller game – all he had to do was grab the Snitch. And then he would win, simple as that.
Harry woke to a dark dorm room. He could hear Seamus snoring across from him, and Ron turned over in his bed. The room felt…too small. Harry felt so stupid – this dorm was so much larger than that stupid cupboard, and he’d managed in that for 11 years, why couldn’t he handle being in a damn room? He was breathing hard. Harry grabbed his glasses off the nightstand and left the room, putting a temporary silence charm over the door so he didn’t wake anyone else.
The third day of Malfoy avoiding him, Harry went down to the lake just after dinner. He skipped a stone across the water. He’d given Ron and Hermione some bullshit excuse about a detention so that he could go the lake after dinner. He was tired of reading and researching and even
“I don’t know. My mother wouldn’t say exactly. Her letters really don’t tell me much. Its just the way she writes them that makes me worry.”
“Still a prat, though?”
“Don’t you ever think you’ll be caught down here?” Draco asked abruptly. He’d never spoken before while they had been together at the Lake. “The Lakeshore isn’t exactly hidden if someone were to really look outside.”
“So you’d leave me to fend for myself?” Draco asked, joking with him – since when was Draco the joking type?
The rest was hazy. Death Eaters flooded the graveyard and Harry felt Voldemort press a cold finger against his scar. Harry’s head was on fire and he was sure that he had never screamed so loudly except for once before. Even gagged, his shrieks echoed through the graveyard. His speech was endless, a hissed drawl that wouldn’t cease until he raised his wand.
“Ah. I should’ve guessed. What has your father heard of then?” Harry chuckled a little at his own reference to the blond’s titular phrase.
get Draco anything. Its not like he could make the other boy a present, either.
“My father,” Draco’s hands were soft. Harry’s were so rough. “I’m afraid of him.” Draco looked down at their hands. He couldn’t look Harry in the eyes. “I shouldn’t be. But I am. He’s only hit me a couple times, and never enough to really leave a mark, but there’s this way that his voice will shake when he’s angry – and I get so scared that he’ll hurt me. I’ve watched him throw things, punch a wall – all things easily repaired with magic, but I remember watching the vase crack, and the wall crumble inward. I remember the sound of his hand breaking against a cabinet. I remember his face when he slapped me across the face last summer. And I shouldn’t be scared of him, but I am, and I can’t help but be afraid.”
He sat on the sand with his legs crisscrossed and took a few deep breaths. He listened carefully to the water lapping at the shore, to the crickets in the grass and the gentle stirring of the giant squid sleeping at the bottom of the lake, and closed his eyes.
“Arent you worried about the first task?” Draco slipped an old piece of parchment into his book as a bookmark.
Luckily, Cedric had told him to take the egg to the bathroom, because Harry had told him before about the dragons. So, Harry did – he snuck out in the night to take a bath in the Prefects bathroom only to be laughed at by Moaning Myrtle as she tried to dive beneath the bath water to get a look at him. He opened the egg and heard its siren song, looked at the stained-glass window across from him of a beautiful mermaid, and left as quickly as he could manage. He needn’t be laughingstock for a ghost.
Draco shook his head, “That’s like having a spell for walking. No, you’re going to have to learn to swim.”
“I know you didn’t put your name in the cup, Potter.” Malfoy said. “You wouldn’t be so angry if you had done it, and – ” Draco cut himself off from saying something he’d regret, something along the lines of saying Harry was too stupid to have been able to put his name in the cup anyway. “And you looked like you were gonna commit murder when you left the castle, so I figured…”
Harry sat in bed, wondering if Malfoy was where he’d left him at the Lake. He thought about the few times he’d asked to go to the library. “That garbage’ll melt your brain,” Vernon had said, “You’ve got better things to be doing.” So Harry had never gone.
“Yeah, Ron and I found it second year. We escaped in a flying car. The car wasn’t very happy about it, though we did crash it before. On accident.”
It was a pain, but he went over his body, inspecting it for anything that stood out too much. He’d done this for years. He hadn’t been able to leave the house when he looked like he’d been hit – he’d had to learn how to cover up. Now it was an impulse, to meticulously go over every inch of his body in search of bruises and scars. He ran a finger down the lightning scar on his forehead, a slight divot in his skin, tracing in multiple branches across his right eyebrow, stopping just below the brow bone. From his face, he ran his hands over each arm – the slight bend in his left arm a reminder of home. From there, to his chest, his back, his hips, legs and feet. Nothing out of place more so than usual, yet he was afraid something would come out of nowhere, and everyone would see it, and ask, and

“Why not? You’ve every right to. I’ve been a dick to you since the beginning of school and we’re only talking now because for some reason we both decided to come to the Lake at night. Plus, I mean, you’re Harry Potter and –”
“I mean, I’m glad and all, but why?” Harry asked him.
Harry finished putting on his pajamas, telling himself he ought to eat more, before someone on the Quidditch team noticed the inward curve beneath his ribcage. That Sunday night, Harry wandered again down the corridor. This time he’d finally remembered to put the invisibility cloak in his pocket.
“Want to find it?” Harry asked.
“Can I sit?” Harry asked, taking off his cloak and sitting down next to Draco before the other boy could answer. “I know the first task.”
“You know what I mean. I don’t have to think about my life or my problems – I can just sit in the dead of night with an open sky above me and an open lake in front of me. It just so happens I discovered I can do this because of you.”
He listened to Malfoy’s sharp intake of breath before he ran back to the castle. Harry poked his finger into the sand. He really should remember to bring his invisibility cloak next time he snuck out.
“Just sit, I think. I’m still tired.” Harry was sitting beside Draco beneath their regular tree. “I mean, I’m always tired, but, you know, more so than usual.”
“Yeah, I am. I don’t know. It’s weird.” Draco rubbed his hands together. “I’m usually worried about her, somewhat, what with my father usually around, but she just seemed so much more…flighty.”
“Curiosity, I suppose. Muggles aren’t bad writers.”
It sent Harry’s thoughts spiraling around his parents, how they died, how he almost died, but didn’t. After class, they went to dinner, and Harry was quiet, Hermione ate quickly before fleeing to the library, and Ron talked with his brothers instead of Harry, thinking he needed space.

In his dreams he imagined what would’ve happened if Cedric hadn’t grabbed the Portkey with him. If his own body had laid against the cold earth, never aging to be an adult, never becoming more than the mere body of a child who’d just hardly had his first kiss (if it even counted); rotting in the graveyard where Voldemort rose again. Cedric would’ve lived and no one but the Death Eaters would know the fate that had befallen Harry Potter.
“Are you going to tell me what it is?”
it said,
“Harry, mate, how do you plan on distracting a mermaid? They’re smarter than dragons. They’re just fish people.”
“What are you going to do?” Malfoy asked, walking up to Harry and sitting down beside him, one of those nights at the Lake.
Harry hadn’t expected his name to come out of the Goblet of Fire. He hadn’t expected to be rushed into an interview with the other three students who’d been picked, and he certainly hadn’t expected for Ron to not believe him when he said he didn’t put his name in the stupid Goblet. But now he had Ron angry with him, Hermione wouldn’t talk to him about it, there was going to be an article about him in the
“You’re not going to drown, Potter. We’re friends now, aren’t we?”
Draco looked at him, it almost looked like he was worried, “You can’t swim?”
“Glad to hear it,” Neville said, leaving to brush his teeth in the bathroom. Harry grabbed his school robes and waited until everyone had gone into the bathroom to wash before he got dressed.
Harry was still at the lake when Draco sat down next to him. “I’m sorry.” Malfoy said.
“Why’re you telling me this?”
“Do what?”
“Well, duh,” Hermione rolled her eyes, “but it wouldn’t be that simple. It’s a challenge, Harry’s going to have to do more than just swim to the bottom of the lake to visit with the mermaids.”
“You could’ve drowned!”
“I don’t know how you manage to do all these things.” Draco said when Harry finished his story. “First the Philosopher’s Stone, then the Chamber, and then everything last year – I’m sorry about being a dick last year, by the way – but how do you even do it?”
Harry shrugged. “It’s your name, isn’t it? Can’t I say it?”
“She didn’t
“My family,” Harry began. “They aren’t good people.”
“You would know.”
After class when everyone was at lunch in the Great Hall, Draco snuck a glance at the Gryffindor table to spot Harry getting up from his seat and (assumably) going back to his dorm. Hopefully he would get some sleep, Draco thought. Ron and Hermione stayed at the table, squabbling over who got to take the last tart off of Harry’s abandoned plate. Draco took a sip of his juice and wondered what the Gryffindor dorm looked like.
It was the night before the third task and Harry was nervous. He’d been nervous before every task, but this one, more so. It would be the last one, and he’d made it so far (with a surprising amount of points!) and he really hoped he’d make it through. He felt he probably wouldn’t die at least; Ron and Hermione had been on top of him with keeping track of useful spells.
“Nothing we can do.” Draco murmured, “I just thought I’d tell you.”
“You’re reading another normal book.” Harry remarked when he sat down next to Draco that night.
“I’m glad you’re not dead.” Draco said when Harry walked up to him that night.
Harry and Ron sat down with Neville and Hermione at a small table with a crystal ball as their professor pulled out a large star chart. Harry was just glad he didn’t need to pay any attention – he rested his chin in his hands, elbows on the table, and let himself drift off.
always look angry.” Draco splashed the smallest amount of water onto Harry’s chest, “I’m perfectly capable of laughing.”
They were making their way to Defense Against the Dark Arts now, and Harry wasn’t particularly excited, though Ron was blabbering on about how scary the new Professor Moody looked, even if he
That night Draco snuck out of the dungeons again. He figured, on one hand he could talk to the paintings if he liked, on the other, if he so happened to see Harry Potter sneaking out of Gryffindor Tower, he could figure out if Potter was up to anything. This seemed reasonable, and Draco didn’t think he’d get caught a second time. If Harry was scheming, if there was even the
performed the hilarious spell that turned Malfoy into a ferret two weeks before. Hermione smacked Ron in the arm and reminded him that, “No matter how distasteful he is, Malfoy’s still a student, and turning him into a ferret and smacking him against a stone was terribly inhumane compared to a regular detention.”
“Alright, I’ll admit, that’s not that much better than a textbook.”
“Isn’t it personal for you though? He...you know.”
Draco couldn’t fathom why Granger and the Weasel hadn’t stormed up to him, asking him about Potter and why he’d been spying on him last night. Unless, he thought, Potter hadn’t told them. Now that he thought about it, it was curious that Potter had been alone, without either of his Gryffindor friends by his side (as they almost always seemed to be). He glanced over at Harry, only to see him smiling with his friends as though last night hadn’t happened. He never looked over at the Slytherin table, like he usually did (often to give Draco a dirty look) during breakfast. Harry left for classes with his friends and it was like nothing at all had ever happened.
“I hope so.”
So Draco was left wondering about Harry’s family, and he wondered if Harry’s family was anything like his.
“Harry.” Draco said. He was looking down. “In all seriousness, good luck tomorrow.” Then, ever so quickly he leaned in the hug Harry, who took the taller boy into his arms. The moon was shining. Draco had his hands resting on Harry’s back. When they pulled apart, it was a silent question:
Harry managed to get out to the Great Lake without getting caught – he’d been halfway down the hall when he’d realized he’d left his invisibility cloak back in his trunk in the dorm, but he didn’t want to risk waking anyone up, didn’t want a room full of boys asking him what he was awake for, didn’t need Ron asking him why he was leaving with his cloak in the middle of the night. Harry sat down at the edge of the Lake shore, looked out across the dark water, and breathed, in and out.
“Then let me teach you how to swim, you git.” Draco led Harry further out into the water until it was up to Harry’s chin. “Now just go beneath the water, and if you need to go back up, just squeeze my arm, and I’ll take you back to the shallows.”
