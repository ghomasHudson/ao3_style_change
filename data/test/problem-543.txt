“Harry, I’m so happy for you two!” Hermione says in a wet voice, smiling softly. Draco wagers she’d hug them both if it weren’t for the table separating them.
Potter tongues the seam of his lips, slides inside his mouth, and Draco moans softly, hearing a soft rustle. Potter opens one of the drawers with a wave of his hand and a bunch of silky, shimmering fabric flies into his outstretched hand.
“Only if you say it first,” Harry says, brushing their noses together, and thinks about those transactions they talked about, about how Draco needed to hear him say it back, and how all tension left him the second Harry did.
After they were done, Potter gave him a lopsided smile, almost a little sad, and kissed him, debilitatingly sweet, while he tucked Draco back in his trousers. Before he closed the door behind him, Potter paused, hesitant, and said he’d see Draco around.
“Still a tyrant, I see,” Harry says, settling comfortably in the chair. It immediately strikes him how nice Draco’s office always smells, like old wood with a barely-there, clean, chemical note and also like Draco himself, the lemony-spicy-sage smell permeating the air, as subtle as its owner.
“Ginny,” he tries again. “How do you two keep coming in here?” Harry asks, genuinely baffled. “I have an assistant! The office is swarming with law enforcement! Seriously, how?”
Draco lets out a choked sound, his face going bright red. Harry wonders if it’s because small kids make him uncomfortable—every time they happen to meet one of their friends’ kids, Harry’s usually the one to gather them in his arms, bounce them around and introduce them to ‘Uncle Draco’. And every time, Draco looks like he’s about to have a stroke.
“Have you seen anyone on my arm lately?” Draco raises a brow, his tone just a little bit on the side of rueful.
The thing about easy things though, is that the results tend to be as satisfying as the challenge which, in this case, is not too thrilling.
“Draco, he’s eight! He will only eat pancakes if I cut smiley faces in them, and he might indulge me and have some chips but only if I individually dip every single one in ketchup for him! And then, I still have to pretend they’re broomsticks flying into his mouth,” Harry shoots back, his memory providing him with a list of made-up broom brands he always carries at the back of his mind, ready to be whipped up to appease the showmanship cravings of an eight-year-old.
“Well. A little over a year after you, oh-so-gloriously, vanquished Voldemort, also known as the rotten apple of my father’s eye, I was still living with Mother at the Manor. Of course, only after a thorough deep-cleaning, several Curse Breaking sessions, which cost a
Harry had never known sex could feel this way—an all-consuming, nearly out-of-body experience, punching the breath out of his lungs, with Draco’s hands holding his hips like Harry was only thing that mattered in the world. They were both soaked in the wing oil by now, hot and slick, and Draco sucked and bit at his neck as he picked up the pace. The oil must have heightened the sensations, it must have, because there was no way anything could feel that fucking good without at least a little bit of magic. Draco hit his prostate with every other thrust and soon, he was pounding into Harry with full force, the slap of skin on skin cutting through the silence of the room.
Harry stops in his tracks, heart racing, as he frowns at his boss. He looks… almost sick. There are beads of sweat gathering at his temples, his Auror uniform is crumpled and askew, and the heavy, dark bags under his eyes make him look like he hasn’t slept in a week. Harry notices the slightest limp in his right leg as Robards takes a few torpid steps towards him, and he has never limped before. Several red lights start rapidly at the back of Harry’s mind, all of them bringing an unsettling feeling of
Harry can’t remember the name of the flower and his eyes keep going back to the tasteful display. It seems… familiar but he can’t remember where he’s seen them. As they enter, Amy tells him about her job—she’s a botanist and in the lab, she researches the magical properties of certain plants for Potions use. Harry absently thinks Draco would be immediately interested; Amy seems to love what she does and Harry listens curiously until the smell of the flowers hits him with full force. There’s an unsettling weight in his stomach as the cloying aroma penetrates the air and even the steaming takeout containers with their lunch can’t overpower the sweet, flowery stench.
. He watches Teddy’s belly contract on every thrust and Draco imagines that it’s his cock, pushing so deep inside him he can see it through his skin.
They’re sitting next to each other on the large sofa, Draco with his legs outstretched and Harry close to his side, heads almost together, talking quietly. Harry has recounted the whole story to Draco whose pale eyebrows rode higher by the minute as he laughed at Harry’s dramatic depiction and the evident distress that accompanied them.
. To that vault. Go, Harry, maybe that spot is still waiting for you, go and beg them to let you in, go, please,” his voice was slowly raising, laced with panic and a desperate plea, his long, pale fingers digging into Harry’s forearm. “Don’t make me—”
“Thank you, ‘Mione,” Harry says and Draco nods, making eye contact with her. She looks at him with more curiosity than anger and Draco wonders if he missed something vital and unspoken in their exchange.
“What do you think?” The corner of his mouth upturns in a small smile. “It was over. She had no idea her son was into men. There was a huge scene and she threatened to tell my mother, to ruin our name,” he sneers. “Like there was anything left to ruin, honestly.”
Harry feels his cheeks burn as Draco plants a light kiss on his shoulder. “Pancakes,” he says and clears his throat. “Cinnamon. Because—”
They’re going faster and faster, the sound of flesh slapping against flesh obscenely arousing, and they kiss every few seconds to ground themselves in the moment, to make sure it’s all real. It’s so unbelievably intimate, giving himself over to Draco, and Harry realises it was never scary, it’s just wonderful, and
Harry smirks. “Good, wouldn’t want anyone ogling you,” Harry jokes, feeling Draco’s hot gaze at his back as they walk through the gate.
that,” Draco hisses, “I know, all right? I’m just— I’m losing my bloody mind being locked up all the time.” He flops down onto his bed like a rag doll and brushes his hair off his face. Harry watches, transfixed, and thinks that Draco’s probably right, wonders if they would never have got to the point of such tension it could be cut with a knife if they’d done all of it differently. It’s unsettling, to think that it might have been the isolation all along, and even more unsettling to know it was always going to happen between them, the universe pushing them closer no matter how much they fight it.
,” Harry growls, swinging his good hand and lifting the poor sod into the air and slamming him against the nearest cliff face. His left hand isn’t usually as cooperative as his right but it’s more than enough against an unarmed, injured wizard. He twists his wrist, meanly, and Dmitri groans in pain as Harry’s crackling magic presses him against the sharp, cold stone.
Teddy’s face and chest are blotted with a gorgeous shade of pink, teal hair sticking to his forehead, and his cock is flushed and leaking onto Draco’s stomach. He’s letting out a stream of soft, needy sounds as he tries to take in more, anything, to bring himself closer to the edge.
And Malfoy has… changed. Harry does his best to conceal the curiosity that prompts him to stare at the changes ten years have made to his once arch-nemesis; it sounds ridiculous but Harry has always remembered his time in Hogwarts quite fondly, with all the shenanigans it included. As he regards his old school rival, memories and images flash through his mind in quick succession—midnight duels, Quidditch games, sneers and insults, and then, they twist and coil, become darker—there’s a pale, famished teenager with bags under his eyes, blood in a school bathroom. The stench of smoke as the Room of Requirement burns. Finally, two slim hands clasped together, tightening their hold as the judge says ‘dismissed’. The Draco Malfoy that sits before him looks nothing like his old self, only retaining his line’s noble bone structure—not classically handsome but still captivating, like a too-expensive watch that you’d be desperate to try on, but know you couldn’t afford to buy. He’s wearing posh Muggle clothes, probably the most expensive suit Harry has ever seen, and his hair isn’t slicked back the way he used to wear it—it’s tousled in a manner people pay good money for, and still a brilliant moonlight colour that makes his eyes stand out even more.
Teddy’s incoherent in his grip but he manages to lift himself up onto his arms; he turns around and watches Harry in his blissed-out confusion, in adoring wonder, and his face alone makes Draco slow it down a bit. He listens for those sweet tiny gasps, each impact pushing out one more, and another, and
“Double protection,” Harry murmurs, casting the spell Malfoy mentioned, “the metal’s imbued with Slowing Charms.”
Draco takes another sip, studying Harry with a scrutiny that makes his neck burn. His eyes roam, linger in places Harry can’t quite identify, and the feeling of exposure tightens his muscles until Draco speaks again. “It’s just… insane, isn’t it?”
Harry thanks all the deities he can name for having the foresight to cast a Glamour and simultaneously asks himself what exactly Luna was thinking when she set this up. This Archibald man must have been running from the Great Fire of London back in his day, which is in equal parts impressive and thoroughly disappointing. Maybe Luna belongs to some veteran club? Maybe she goes to places like that to unwind or hunt for Wrackspurts; maybe she’s actually their age and sucks the life force out of Ginny to stay young.
“Oh my god, Harry,” Draco whispers behind him, warm breath ghosting over Harry’s skin. “If you could see yourself, god, you’re beautiful.”
and what a terribly apt choice, to hear the singer beg in a sweet voice for the one thing Harry wanted the most at that moment.
to find his glasses and wand in the middle of the night. At one point, Ron—or perhaps it was Hermione—pointed out that Harry had just Levitated a tray of tea with his wand still sitting on the coffee table. That day, Harry realised he hadn’t used his wand at home for weeks, instinctively letting his magic flow through his fingers, as easy as breathing, and the excitement, the feeling of
?” Hermione says with a funny lilt to her voice and frowns; Harry knows Draco’s does the same, both looking at him like he said something crazy.
Malfoy is strangely quiet for a while—he stares into the distance with an absent expression and Harry wonders what goes on in his head. He’s not going to be picky about that change of heart, although Malfoy does seem a little deflated, it's as if all the lip, the attitude, and the cockiness evaporated along with the last rays of sunlight.
“We’ll take it,” Draco butts in, his voice smooth like the finest silk, and, judging by the receptionist’s discreet smile, Harry’s face must be as red as the jacket he’s wearing. He absently hopes the name of the room won’t be visible on the receipt, lest Kingsley or Robards decide to go through the case expenses.
“Hermione, help!” Ron chokes out, trying to throw Harry off. “He’s gone completely barmy this time!”
“I—ahh,” Harry gasped, arching into Draco’s touch. “I’m sure you’ve plenty of ideas,” he said, smiling mischievously.
He walks to the nearest vendor and stops at the end of the queue while Draco retreats to one of the benches surrounding the small makeshift central square, obviously content to sit back and watch. With nothing better to do, Harry resumes his Draco Watch that’s, incidentally, also his job, just for a different reason, and sees a small child approach him and sit down on the other side of the bench.
Instead, Draco watched him from afar, memorised the coordinates of each and every freckle, and thought about that one little curl of jet-black hair, right next to Potter’s ear, and imagined it brushing against the tip of his nose. He was downright disturbed by that indigo jacket, too, the enticing row of onyxes mocking his fingers that itched to open them one by one, to peel off everything that dwelled underneath and melt into that sandalwood-smelling skin like no time had passed.
“You’re drunk,” Draco breathed against Potter’s lips, feeling his head spin. The smoke. It was the smoke. He didn’t have an explanation as to why he was half-hard, though.
, more, it feels so—oh-oh-fuck,” he breathes locking his thighs around Harry’s waist. “Fuck me. Make me feel it.”
Draco pulls him into a hot, tight embrace as he slowly starts to move his hips. Every single push, every gasp and moan make his toes curl and his breath hitch. Draco is over him, inside him, around him, the sizzling-hot pleasure almost splitting him in half, and Harry has never, not in his wildest fantasies, thought sex with someone would feel this way. It’s overwhelming, it’s intoxicating, the way Draco looks at him as he pushes inside only heightening the sensation, and Harry pulls him in for a deep, filthy kiss. It only spurs Draco on to pick up the pace as he fucks him harder and faster, letting out a stream of soft gasps, a litany of
“How is firing people fun?” Harry asks instead of answering but decides to indulge him anyway. “Also, they don’t think of us like that—”
“Originally built for the Prince of Wales, and later, our very own king, Edward VII,” he recited smoothly as if he was presenting a curious trinket to a potential buyer. “I must admit, it was an impulse purchase but—well, look at it.”
Ginny groans. “Even if I did, which I don’t think I did? Draco’s very attractive so what’s the problem?”
that. And still, while Harry sacrificed things for the greater good, for an idea that’s morally correct and inherently just, everything Draco had sacrificed, was for the people close to him, their safety and happiness, and that leaves Harry wishing he knew how to get Draco to make his own bloody self happy for a change.
“I want to,” Harry says simply, a little surprised at how raspy his voice sounds. He kisses the side of Draco’s cock. “I just. I’ve never done this before so— Just tell me if it’s bad,” he says, feeling his face go red.
, made Harry’s head spin, made something lurch in his chest, and he could only hope that his hunger didn’t show on his face.
Since it’s all started, Draco has learned a number of things about Potter, things varying from mundane to groundbreaking in their importance, things Potter gives away so easily, as if he almost
Draco’s gorgeous but it’s something entirely different to say it out loud. Somehow Harry thinks saying it would make it real, would make it known to the universe that Harry Potter thinks Draco Malfoy is beautiful and Draco would find out and Harry would have to leave the country. Draco doesn’t think that about Harry, he’s sure, and dropping a bomb with the words ‘
There’s a playful tug at the corner of her mouth. “Oh, I don’t know, is being tall and gorgeous wrong? Maybe there’s something you don’t like about six-packs?” Harry stares her down, exasperated. “Well. I mean, he’s reasonably built. Blonde hair, dresses well…”
“You had some silver solution right there,” he says and opens it back up. “I added a dash of Dittany to speed up the healing, the silver will help with the infection. Ideally, I’d use a specifically brewed antitoxin but seeing we don’t have any potion-making equipment on hand…”
Releasing Draco’s cock with a wet pop, he takes one of Draco’s bollocks into his mouth, sucking and teasing it with his tongue, and then switches to the other one—Draco’s almost thrashing, letting out a stream of curses and incoherent praise. Spit and precome dripping down his chin, Harry licks a long, lazy stripe up the length, from the base to the very tip, swirling his tongue around the head and sucking it lightly into his mouth. The thick, hard weight on Harry’s tongue is intoxicating; he can feel every vein curling under the silky-smooth skin and he can almost smell Draco’s arousal—teasing the slit with a few hard flicks of his tongue, Harry feels Draco’s whole body vibrate under his hands, hears him cry out in unabashed rapture. Then, without warning, he sinks down on Draco’s cock as far as he can go, taking all of it until it hits the back of his throat.
“Do it,” Harry whispered, trying and failing to thrust into Draco’s fist. “It’s okay, fuck, I’m close.”
The roar gets louder and louder, and the light is now a concentrated beam that’s getting closer and when it finally splits into two yellow headlights, Harry realises it’s not lightning.
“I mean,” Draco huffs. “You are the Saviour of the Wizarding World. The Boy Who Lived Twice and all that, and— To find out about such a thing, and at the hands of some measly Muggles no less, it’s
“Did you expect us to be— I don’t know, propelled into the air or something?” Harry asks with a sly smile, sitting back and enjoying the cool autumn breeze. The view in front of them changes as they are lifted higher; the whole town stretches out over the horizon beneath them, with its flickering lights, inky-dark fields and lit-up roads cutting across the landscape in luminous ribbons. Above them, the night sky glimmers with an array of stars dappled all over its black canvas. It’s not a view one can witness in London, and Harry thinks that all those lights reflecting in Draco’s pensive eyes, as he silently regards their surroundings, isn’t a common one either.
Harry stared. “I don’t understand,” he said blankly while his thoughts raced, utterly confused as to what exactly Draco needed from him.
The kiss was slower this time, with Draco carefully coaxing his mouth open, licking into it as if trying to convey all the things neither knew how to say. The room was spinning around him with Draco as his only anchor, a lifeline pulling Harry out into the surface after a five-year slumber.
Unwavering popularity and ridiculous articles aside, the last eight years have passed relatively peacefully. Harry and his friends finished Hogwarts and kickstarted their careers. Harry and Ron went straight into Auror training, now working as a dream team with the highest arrest rate (and an injury rate that matches). Hermione—being Hermione—the brightest witch of her age, the most ambitious student in England, and, frankly, one of the toughest women Harry knows, cut her way through the ranks of the Unspeakables and is now about to become the youngest subdepartment head in the last sixty-eight years. It’s all the more impressive knowing Hermione has been simultaneously planning a wedding for the last two years, after finally having glared Ron into getting the hint over every single engagement announcement in the
He feels the hot length of Draco’s cock, still hard at the jut of his hip, feels his own give an interested twitch. He feels empty and
“Stop squirming,” says Harry and in a bold move, cups his whole palm over the fractured rib and closes his eyes. He focuses on his intent, picturing the broken bone, targeting the source of pain and feeling a warm, pulsing orb of energy just beneath Malfoy’s skin, reaching out to him and yielding under his spell. He hears another gasp, softer this time, and Malfoy instinctively puts his hand over his shoulder, squeezing lightly, letting out long, deep breaths.
It’s not that he’s ashamed. It’s not that he doesn’t trust his friends. It’s just… Personal. After his last session, it took him a few days to bring himself to take a full look in the mirror, to be ready—for what, Harry wasn’t sure. It was a chapter closing, a new one opening, it was purification, conservation; it was tying the memories of his past to the ideals he wanted to carry into his future.
Daniel is courteous and polite, funny and smart, and the man seems like he hasn’t got a single mean bone in his body. He’s fully engaged in the conversation, opens doors for him and even compliments his looks, even though Harry knows his hair is a disaster and there are shadows under his eyes that make him look like a Werewolf after a full moon. Daniel is, in fact, so nice, he doesn’t even comment on Harry’s terrible dish choice, laughs at every single one of his jokes—even if Harry himself cringes inwardly at a thing or two he says—and doesn’t bat an eyelash when Harry asks for a beer instead of wine.
wrong would only have added insult to injury (or maybe the other way around). To this day, Harry hopes to dear Merlin it hadn’t taken him too long to say ‘
“Mate, if you like someone so much you’re willing to risk your job for them, find a way,” Ron says sagely. “Shit, Robards wants something, I’m off.”
Draco looks at her, a mix of polite surprise and amusement evident in his face, even with the Glamour on. “Do you always approach strangers like this?” he asks with a raised brow. “Shouldn’t you be supervised?” As if to support his point, he looks around, probably scanning the crowd for a parent or some sort of guardian.
“Draco?” He inhaled, deeply, eyes closing. Then, he noticed a faint wet trail next to Draco’s spine which must have been the source of the downright incredible aroma. “What’s that? Something’s… dripping.”
Harry slowly nods, recalling some of the files he’s read over the years. Some of the bodies the Aurors have found. It seemed there was a twisted sense of justice between those people—a punishment that fit the crime, bodies marked with specific spells and curses to indicate what was the victim’s sin. Those who stole from the hand that fed them would have their own removed from the body. Those who killed without explicit orders would go straight to Azkaban after identifying their families’ bodies. Those who tried to flee the country would soon have no legs to even flee to another room. Those marked as traitors, though… Harry swallows thickly.
Whether it was his childhood, or the war, or even his adult life, Harry has always wondered what it would feel like to be needed. Not for a grand purpose, not for his skill or status. Just needed, for him. And it’s a terrifying thing, to discover someone so different feeling so similar.
Hermione opens and closes her mouth a few times, looking for an answer that would be the least incriminating—Harry feels transported back to Hogwarts, it’s just now he’s McGonagall and Hermione is twelve years younger. “We… might have concealed the fact—”
“Isn’t it?” Robards asks. “People live in fear, under a government that’s unable to protect them. The Ministry is running around in circles like chickens with their heads cut off and in the meantime, their loved ones keep disappearing. And then, the only person they know would never let this happen disappears for eight weeks—just long enough to plant another seed of mistrust towards those who deem themselves the
, just like he did last night. It doesn’t get as heated as Draco would want it to, not in a public place—there’s a debilitating sweetness to it, though, and maybe the tiniest hint of possessiveness, it’s Harry claiming him for everyone to see, unashamed, happy and confident.
“Make—it—happen!” Draco barks after several long minutes pass, banging his fist on the machine and startling Harry out of his own quiet struggle. He finally manages to turn it on, dearly hoping the clothes will come out unscathed, and turns to Draco to see him looking angrily at the uncaring device, silent and ominous in its idleness.
Weasley scoffs at that. “No fucking way he's won. I refuse to believe Malfoy of all people had the best candidate.”
Draco stared at his lover, shamelessly spread open for him, and silently blessed their ancestors for their filthy ingenuity. Harry looked back at him with wide pupils and a soft smile, propped up on his elbows, and Draco’s eyes skitted across his body, undecided what to admire first. He looked positively sinful, laid out before Draco like that, hard and flushed, and absolutely breathtaking. All of him: his shoulders and biceps barely fitting into a seat designed for a smaller, female frame; his stomach, taut and toned, with the softest rolls at the bottom; his cock, glistening wet and flushed a pretty red.
Draco looks at him like he’s deranged, spluttering as he shakes his head. “Wha— This is what you— We have a lot of houses!” he scoffs, and Harry laughs, smacking his arse.
“Believe what you will, Weasley,” Draco says airily “In the end, I will thoroughly enjoy seeing your freckled face adorned with defeat.”
Draco stands too close and smells too amazing for Harry to muster a single word. He can’t look at Draco, can’t allow himself to follow every curl and wave in his hair, to trace the cupid’s bow of his mouth, or to say yes when all his reason is screaming at him to deny it. But to Harry’s complete horror, Draco can read him like a book.
Harry sends thanks to whatever Forces That Be that must have been listening that they arrived on the side of an empty road—no Muggles in sight, no cars, no civilisation for another kilometre or so. Nearby, there’s a sign with the town’s name spray-painted over, and Harry would maybe be worried about it but the anonymity their surroundings granted was exactly what he was hoping for.
Malfoy turns to him. “I can’t risk her,” he says, like it’s the most obvious thing in the world. “I know you think very little of me or any bonds I am capable of building but—” He exhales, looking into the distance again. “She’s the most important person to me. I made the necessary precautions, she’s
— don’t you fucking dare die right now!” He doesn’t care that his palms are burning like fire, that the magic glows red and angry. All Harry cares about is that the bleeding starts to slow down a little, and he smiles hysterically, whispering the incantation over and over, like the hymn of life itself. “That’s right, listen to me just this once, you bastard, and don’t die, not now—”
“I’m… going to sit back and let Potter tell you everything,” Draco says cryptically, feeling hot under his collar.
Just when Harry steers himself back on the path of sanity, convinced he’s immune to the seductive darkness Draco seems to carry at his disposal like a Veela has its allure, he does or says
Draco’s face smoothed out in realisation. “You want him to think we came here to fuck,” he said more than asked, quiet and dangerous in the way an empty field feels right before lightning strikes—a biting static gathering in the air, making the hair on Harry’s arms stand on end.
what good old Voldy was doing. They needed business partners—people who came smelling an opportunity and stayed for the profits. Unmistakable, hard,
“Hey,” Harry says quietly. “You got the deal. You can take them down, I’m just here to make sure you get to.”
The thrust is so hard it punches the breath out of him, and Harry immediately puts his fist over his mouth to stifle his scream. Draco takes advantage of the moment. He pulls out his wand, quickly casts an industrial-grade Silencing spell and carelessly throws it to the floor.
He lifts his head, schooling his expression into something neutral. “Nothing’s going on,” Harry says. Claire just raises a brow. “Thank you for bringing the papers.”
“What a surprise,” he deadpans, but the seed of curiosity has been planted, and Harry uncrosses his arms, listening.
“—fucked in a closet, yes,” Draco finished bluntly, horrified at how gauche that was. He traced his index finger over Harry’s thigh, light like a feather, almost expecting sparks to fly and Harry laughed softly.
Harry smiles. “Not a problem, haven’t seen the little guy for a while,” he bounces the baby boy on his hip as the boy makes happy little gurgles and drools on Harry's t-shirt. “George and Angelina okay with this?”
Draco snorts and downs his glass. “If you’ll excuse me, I’ll go get another glass while we wait, I can’t talk to him sober.”
The intern stares a hole into the floor and Harry almost feels sorry for the guy, except that watching Draco in his element, being all authoritative and competent sparks something akin to excitement in Harry and he never passes up an opportunity to watch the show.
“Draco,” Harry repeats, unsure how to make the situation at least a little less awkward. It shouldn’t feel like a betrayal, but he can’t help feeling guilty for, once again, throwing Draco into a cell, especially considering what had happened the last time he had done so.
“Ah, not yet,” Draco says, “you know I like you sloppy.” There’s a wet sound, a few fast flicks as Draco teases Teddy’s hole, as Harry keeps kissing him and thumbing at his slit.
… and the men.” He gets up and keeps rambling about the Russian wizarding world, their parties and the interesting characters he’d met there while he rummages around the hotel room, finally coming up with a large bowl and a plain white washcloth.
They started doing this a few days into the first week—Harry would take some of his spares, Transfigure them into a plain colour which somehow always ended up being black and, after Malfoy’s stubborn requests, shrink them a bit so they fit him better. And
Draco’s eyes are still on him as he speaks again. “But you won’t. If you really wanted to, you would have done it as soon as I pointed there and told you what it is. And you won’t because as your… friend, I won’t let you.”
“Are you doing anything tonight?” Harry replies quietly, with a smirk that makes Draco want to rip all his clothes off right here on this table—an image as disturbing as it is enticing.
Hermione watches the exchange with amusement. Ginny pauses halfway through braiding Luna’s hair and both girls watch as Harry slowly zones in on Ron and his bean bag. Which sounds
. Deep down, Harry despised them all, despised their hatred, that fear of living outside some imaginary mould, he would gladly spit on their scones and cars and neatly trimmed lawns.
“Calm down Weasley, no need to flex so hard,” Draco says with a smirk. “I was going to suggest a friend of my mother’s, he’s French and a
Malfoy runs a hand over his face. “When they were checking my testimony— In the holding cell. The two they left me with…”
Their summer days passed like a sepia-coloured slideshow, with snapshots of memories written into his heart, kissed into his skin, playing on loop like the sea that kisses its shore time and again. Draco was like the most beautiful mirage in the rippling sun, his skin almost gold, his hair smelling like patchouli, his smile crinkling the corners of his eyes.
Harry drags his hands up that slender waist, already knowing how soft and smooth the skin underneath Draco’s shirt is. Knowing how that taut, lean muscle shivers and contracts under his touch, how the alabaster-white flushes the faintest pink, how easily it bruises, and how dark it bleeds. He counts the ribs he mended with his own fingertips, touches the places he wiped clean of wounds, traces the raised scars he carved into Draco’s flesh himself.
“They’ll kill me if they find me, you know.” Malfoy finally looks at Harry—something rueful flashes across his face, quickly disappearing underneath a cool mask of indifference.
“Ahh—h-harder,” Draco said on an exhale, arching his long neck but never moving forward, almost as if trying to keep his distance before the inevitable fall.
The slam of the machine door echoes off the walls; Draco’s silent, and Harry’s skin tingles, feeling careful, questioning eyes watch him from a safe distance. He rolls his eyes. Draco’s like a mean, wild cat that will accept being touched and pretend he doesn’t care, that will walk away but will check if Harry sees him go. And the most incredible thing is that Harry can touch him at all, with Draco begging him to do so just minutes ago and Harry can’t bring himself to regret it, not with the sounds Draco makes when he’s coming apart still ringing in his ears, or the full-body shivers that took over when they kissed.
“I got a text from you a few days ago, asking where I was,” Harry remembers. “It wasn’t you, was it?”
“Congratulations,” Harry says as he re-enters the room. Malfoy is sitting on his bed, mindlessly sifting through a Muggle gossip magazine with an expression of a child that has found a dead frog. Disgusted, yet too fascinated not to poke it with a stick. Harry begrudgingly wonders how Malfoy got his hands on it and whether that resourcefulness is something natural or perhaps an effect of spending too much time with mobsters for the most of his twenties. Malfoy looks up and straightens as soon as he sees Harry’s expression that clearly screams
“Harry, would you stop with the dramatics, honestly, Draco is seriously rubbing off on you,” Hermione says and Harry tenses.
Draco grabs his arse and his hands go up, under his shirt, the touch setting Harry on fire and he tries to forget about the past, about once hating a beautiful, lost boy, about how they both felt at the time, and focuses on what’s in front of him—that same boy, now a man, who loves him, and touches him as if he were sacred, and kisses him like he’s been waiting for it for years. With a whole new expanse of smooth, milky skin to work with, Harry lets his hands roam, brushing every inch of flesh he can reach—shoulder blades, the small of Draco’s back, ribs, shoulders, biceps—Draco hisses into his mouth as Harry circles his nipples with his thumbs, immediately wanting to circle them with his tongue, too.
Harry watches Draco’s tongue dart out to lick his lips and feels a rush of adrenaline go down his back. Their age-old rivalry has always made him reckless and impulsive; from time to time, they would half-consciously slip back into it and Harry revels in those moments, now even more exhilarating than back at school. Seeing that dangerous sparkle in Draco’s quicksilver eyes, the faint flush colouring his cheeks, sometimes a stray lock of blond hair falling over his forehead, and knowing that this time, it’s all in good spirits, just to make things interesting, just to spur Harry on a little… It’s intoxicating, it feeds the lion slumbering inside him to the point where all he wants to do is to grab the front of Draco’s shirt and slam him against the nearest wall. He never does, obviously—he rarely allows himself to think what Draco would do right then, whether it would put out the fire in his eyes or make it roar anew, awaken something in Draco as well, and where they would go from there.
Draco observes his surroundings with the suspicious expression of someone completely out of his element—he even seems to forget Harry’s watching and cautiously walks around the space, examining the buttons and dials on the machines, and skimming the instructions hanging on the wall. The launderette is completely empty save for the two of them and Harry’s maybe a little bit glad for it, considering the questions Draco might have, if he chooses to ask them, but he’s also strangely on edge and out of his element outside the relative safety of their hotel room. He feels watched in a way similar to those washing machines, like Draco’s trying to figure how
Harry palms at the rounded edges of the washer and his hands slip, unable to find any purchase. Draco notices that and, with a sinful glint in his eye, grabs Harry’s wrists and guides his hands to the back of his head, pushing down on it, beckoning Harry to take hold. Harry grabs him by the hair, pulling it hard, coaxing a delicious shiver out of him. The wet, filthy sound Draco makes when Harry pulls him off his cock could be enough to make him come, especially with how utterly
“Yes. It’s… very common for Amortentia to change its scent, perceived by an individual, over time,” Draco says, watching him with a strange intensity that sends a shiver down his spine. Unrestrained curiosity keeps tugging on his gut and Harry looks at the shelf again.
Harry doesn’t say anything as a tiny shrike Patronus flies in, confirming two Aurors are on their way to escort their… Harry wants to say ‘guest’ but he supposes Malfoy is a detainee now, in every sense of the word. He checks the handcuffs and finds them securely locked around Malfoy’s slender wrists—if they were any slimmer, the cuffs would have fallen off. He’s never been made for prison, Harry thinks—with his fragile bones and angelic hair, and smelling like almonds—Malfoy would have ended up a canary stuffed into the darkest, grimiest box imaginable.
He grabs Draco by the front of his shirt, kisses him again, and starts dragging him towards one of the chairs in the further part of the room. Once Draco realises what Potter’s
Their boss is currently focused solely on Potter, thank fuck, and Draco tries to do a thing he rarely ever does anymore, which is appear as small and invisible as physically possible in a small space. He thinks back to his job interview and wonders how on earth he got it in the first place.
, so good,” Draco pleaded and that burst of honesty made Harry’s eyes water, his arousal quickly reaching its apex, and he had to pull Draco back up, couldn’t imagine coming without him close. He palmed at Draco’s throat, feeling his Adam's apple bob up and down and reached around for Draco’s cock with his other hand.
“Holy shit… How did you get your hands on all this?” asks Harry, looking up from the papers, already feeling he knows the answer.
The world outside their haven wasn’t a safe place. Life seemed to flow in slow motion, all sunny smiles and happy faces—men tilting hats at their neighbours, children laughing and chasing each other in the streets, whole families packed into their Ford Consuls to go on a trip to the beach. The joyful babble of the telly was as good a tool as any to stifle people’s worries, to make everything seem normal—a pretty postcard of a life in the middle of a world that’s battered, tired, and so, so scared. The picturesque image of a perfect life, just like in the magazines, did not pass by Harry and Draco. After they had left wizarding society, they found a nice little house in a quiet, suburban district. White picket fences, trimmed hedges and smiling housewives with perfect teeth, baking scones for their perfect, white collar husbands and bunches of apple-cheeked children. Just like in that song on one of Draco’s records, the one he brought from their trip to America:
“All right, we really have to go if we want to make it on time,” she says, shoes already on, coat buttoned. “Do try to have fun, Harry. You never know,” she adds with a cheeky smile. It seems like bloody Malfoy is rubbing off on everybody, and that’s a dirty joke Harry doesn’t want to think about.
“I want you,” Harry whispered into his ear, seeming undecided whether to lick or bite, overwhelmed with the possibilities.
Draco swallows the sound with a searing kiss and Harry’s mind goes blank—he kisses back, helpless against his growing arousal, the fire simmering in his belly. Suddenly, Draco slows down, pressing his forehead against Harry’s—his eyes are squeezed shut, lips puffy and wet.
“Oh come on,” Draco scoffs, “We both know we could… loosen up a bit,” he says, looking straight at Harry with a strange expression. Harry swallows.
They end up choosing a couple of partly-obscured machines way in the back, so as not to attract any unnecessary attention if anyone manages to get through the wards—it’s not the middle of nowhere anymore, it’s a medium-sized town and Harry can still see people walking around, even at two o’clock in the morning. He fishes out all of their clothes, save for the ones they’re currently wearing, not willing to even hint at washing those as well. He throws a few off-handed instructions Draco’s way, to look like he knows more than he actually does, and once they find an abandoned bottle of detergent, they get down to figuring out the machines.
“We’re back from Magical Games and Sports,” Luna supplies, grinning in delight and taking Ginny’s hand. “Ginny finally got them to lift the ban on male cheerleaders!”
“Draco,” Harry says, more firmly this time, and Draco finally stops talking. Harry decides it’s maybe time to actually
Before Harry can start listing all the reasons he can’t and won’t date a man who’s probably five times his age, Draco takes another sip of his water and cuts in. “Wait, excuse me,” he says and sniffs the water.
“Until what?” Harry asks and hopes the lighting is bad enough so that Draco can’t see the pink flush spreading on his face.
As he watches the goon raise his wand, Harry absently hopes Malfoy will just get to safety and not do anything stupid, but then the man's wand falls to the ground and he lets out out a strangled, gurgling sound, his hands flying to his neck. Malfoy’s porcelain-white face, teeth bared, appears right next to to the stranger’s and he has one hand behind the man’s neck, and the other close by, holding what appears to be a thin silver wire with a small handle at the end.
“It’s not that great of an arse,” Draco rolls his eyes and the statement is only a tiny lie. He prefers to pretend Potter was never an object of more than a few fantasies but it’s always been difficult to focus on the Snitch with the way he mounted a broom.
His best friend berates Harry a little, saying the poor lad doesn’t know anything anyway, and drags Harry away, casting a few Cleaning Charms at him while he’s at it.
Harry didn’t even notice Draco stroll off with the key, and Draco forced himself to keep that slow, strolling pace until he turned the corner at the bottom of the stairs. Then, it was a sprint, up fifteen stairs to the landing, across to the second door on the left. The moment he closed the door behind him, Draco stilled, staring down the innocuous trunk that held Harry Potter’s secret.
Whatever the secret was, it was carefully wrapped in Harry’s invisibility cloak, tucked innocently up against one side. Draco took a deep breath. This was it, then. He reached for the cloth.
Draco always turned them down, gently, politely, but they never had the right to ask. Not when Harry was right there. Even though Harry was always better at duels than spitting out what he actually felt.
“Wait, this is all giving me a headache, are you telling me that you and I are bonded, because some idiot doesn’t know how to use a thesaurus?”
,” Hermione said. “What we need is the person who actually made the beacon, so we can figure out how to get this back to a naturally evolving bond.”
“Well, gentlemen! Looks like there’s not much more we can do for you here. Your bond is healthy and normal, there’s no reason to keep you. We’re going to discharge you.”
Draco kissed him again, a little bit loving, a little bit naughty. “I’m very truly not.” He paused, then smirked. “Though I’m fairly certain that Weasley is going to have an aneurysm when he finds out!”
From three tiles away, Harry took a step forward and paused, opening his mouth to say something, but then the orange space beneath his feet gave way, letting Harry and his black die drop into the void with a yell.
“But this one didn’t work like that, it never sent a signal, or brought you to me or anything, you weren’t affected at all until you touched me.”
Draco needed to pen an equally polite and pointed response. And he would. As soon as the thought of getting married, even for the sake a formality, didn’t make his ribs feel like they were caving in.
attempt to strengthen, weaken, or tamper with it could be disastrous until we know exactly what the beacon requires.”
Draco suddenly spun around on his heel, overwhelmed with the desperate need to face away from Harry, and Harry’s grin, and the hole that nearly stole Harry away.
dropping from Malfoy’s mouth. But it was too late. Malfoy had seen, and those lips had tilted upward in a pleasantly surprised and calculating smile.
His lips were cold, but his breath was so, so warm. It tingled across Harry’s lips as Draco pulled back, then gently kissed him again, the chilly tip of his nose a tentative press against Harry’s cheek. After that kiss, Draco stayed close, fingers in his.
was to follow through on the unspoken agreement he and Malfoy have observed during every single encounter since their Academy days: if the two of them were alone in the same room together, neither were leaving until one was a clear conqueror.
“Pay attention, mate,” Ron said. “They’ve finished debating the theory bits and they’re ready to tell us what the problem is in words we understand.”
“Calling it salivating is a bit much,” Harry said, still brushing off the glitter from the last tile.
the plane, where people belong!” Draco yelled over the French shouting. He stood like a matador, poised and powerful, snapping off countercurses while the wind in his hair made him look like a superhero. “
“Harry, you really are in love with me, aren’t you?” Draco asked. “This proposal… it isn’t some massive prank you’re pulling on me?”
Harry’s eyes dragged down to Malfoy’s lips, despite every inch of Harry’s will fighting against it, and he dragged them back up again the instant he had control over the way his body responded to the words
Draco had blamed it on the cabin air, apparently. It was the “stale oxygen they puff out at the Economy Muggles in that arial plane” that made Draco sneeze and let his flashy Auror robes flicker into view, which gave it all away. Not at all the fact that the smugglers were
“Oh, I know,” Malfoy said. His face was sharp and his amusement was sharp, but the overall effect was disconcertingly soft. “I’m well aware that I’ll only ever be your First Officer in name only. I know that, more than anything, you’d rather have me on my knees than giving you orders.”
to see where it went. But it was pretty clear that Draco wanted it to go so much further than Harry did. Draco wanted everything to change. He kept walking.
He wrapped the equation in an iridescent sphere around Harry and the wiggling black die, then made another for himself and the white one. “Right then. Dice, could you please give us a roll for a tile full of very safe things. Pillows, perhaps?”
“Good,” Malfoy said and took Harry’s cock back into his mouth again. This time, Harry also felt the touch of Malfoy’s hands, one bracing against his hip bone, the other sliding along the curve of his arse, an echo of their earlier wrestling. Only this time, Harry wasn’t flinching away.
Malfoy to you, Potter,” he said, rubbing at his neck. “All part of the deal your Captain Granger made when we all got shunted over to the arse end of the Delta Quadrant.”
Potter gave an unrepentant shrug. “Finishing all that blasted paperwork. Everyone keeps interrupting me in my office during the day and I never get to the end of the pile. I always think they might actually need help, but half the time they just to want to… chat.”
There were nearly a dozen of them, clearly worn, but carefully preserved. They were Muggle books, thick with pages but still small enough to be covertly tucked into a pocket. Carefully, gently, Draco picked one up, showing Harry the muscled, shirtless man on the cover, posing stoically on a ship while his hair lifted in the breeze. Draco read the title: “A Pirate’s Passionate Tempest?”
Harry did, and let himself stare into those clever grey eyes. They were so calm, offering so much more stability than whatever it was roaring under Harry’s skin. He took a breath and kept staring, until he could see it, the feverish burn deep inside Malfoy’s eyes. What they were doing was capsizing everything for Malfoy, too, taking the familiar and forging it into something molten and new. But Malfoy handled it with poise, with confidence, with authority.
This time, it spat them out in an Old Earth Turkish wrestling ring, with nothing but black kisbet to change into and more than a dozen large metal tureens of olive oil surrounding them.
Draco frowned as he handed one of the remaining letters to Harry. “It’s from someone named Sam Jordan? She wants to meet you in person to talk about the questions she was asking in your Defense class. Did she fail an exam?”
Draco laughed, pulling Harry close, “Somehow I bear the torment.” He kissed him sweetly and smiled. “I can’t believe it, this time tomorrow, you’ll be my husband.”
After the initial shock had settled, Harry and Draco had agreed to go to Hogwarts to find out more about the bond and the effects on Harry’s magic before his parents and this… Bond Butcher they had hired arrived. Deciding that floo travel was too risky for the incomplete bond, they had Apparated together, Harry holding Draco’s arm with more force than was strictly necessary. Draco assumed it was because of his weakened magic.
Malfoy’s fingers were overly slick as they flicked against his arsehole and pressed in, steady, sure. The breach brought back the same roaring feeling from before, the avalanche, the symphony. Harry lost himself to it, the feeling of Malfoy filling him, of lips and tongue and teeth. He let Malfoy mark him, posses him, claim him; he let himself have the first real moment in his life where he could prioritize his pleasure over his obligations, his responsibilities, his burden.
But the real reason everyone watched him was because it was impossible to have Draco Malfoy walk by without watching him. He’d grown into his pointy nose and boney chin, and he somehow also got sharper cheekbones and fuller lips in the process. He walked like he was the ghost of the Queen of England: poised, elegant, dazzling — and yet still somehow ethereal and unreal. Harry had hoped that he’d gain some kind of immunity to the thrall of Draco Malfoy, standing by him so much every day, but he never ever did.
gone. But in its place was the image of two hands, in greys and blacks and browns. They spanned Harry’s entire back, from shoulder to shoulder, reaching out for each other but not touching.
Malfoy snorted, infuriatingly elegant. “Of course.” He spun around and strode on bare, bony feet to the medic station on the far wall and began rooting around. “The sort of sparring that has nothing to do with you intimidating me, as an act of intense loyalty to your very clever Captain.” He came back and tossed a handheld Regenerator at Harry, who snatched it with lightning reflexes, despite the sharp ache in his pelvis the stretch caused.
“There now, Minerva,” Harry said, sitting down beside Sam and slinging an arm around her shoulder. “I think Sam has scolded herself enough about this.” He looked at McGonagall with a determined face, and Draco felt a surge of affection seeing Harry being so protective of his students.
,” they said, turning to study Harry with wide, slanted, purple eyes. “I know what you’re doing, clever hero. Trying to steal information you haven’t earned. It’s very naughty.”
When they settled from the dip of the tile, a blue light wobbled in front of them and formed into a small card.
“The discomfort is your own making, little hero,” the Collector said. “Your position is not nearly as discommodious as that of all the others I borrow. And you well know the conditions of your release.” They walked to the edge of the ichor pool and pulled out a metal key from fathomless and luminous black robes. The key was laid on top of a small silver chest resting barely a breath away from the lapping, inky waters. “Take the key. Open the chest. Leave your magic. And you’ll be returned to your life, hale and whole.” Then they fluttered their fingers, too long, too white, and covered in a fine membrane of moss. “Or wait until someone comes for you and let them accept the exchange. Whichever you prefer.”
“It’s my parents,” he said softly. “Father has hired Cyril Celandine to break the bond one way or another, and they’ll both be here by noon.”
Then Malfoy stepped right into Harry’s space, close enough that Harry needed to tilt up to look him in the eye, and said, “you’ll need to work harder than that to get me at your mercy, Potter.” He gestured at the Regenerator in Harry’s hand. “Go on, there, don’t be shy. Heal yourself up. It’s nothing I’m not already familiar with. Remember, our wrestling arena hadn’t come with change rooms.”
Draco shrugged. “It’s not like we agreed about where to go in the first place. And if it’s just sex, we can just fall back on our system: you Floo when you’re free, and I’ll come. Roll the dice, please.”
He wouldn’t do only that, really. With his face so close to the wing, the wind was somehow louder, faster. But Harry was a professional. He could cast a Jelly-legs Jinx and an
“I think we’ll need to do exactly that,” Draco said. “But I need a fresh read on your vitals, first. The last recorded set was looking fairly rough.” He set the monitoring spells to show an ongoing readout. “Please remain as motionless as you can. We can still talk, but try not to move around.”
It didn’t matter that the closest Harry had ever come to an airport was a week abandoned at Mrs. Figgs’ when the Dursleys went to Bermuda. Or that the two of them marched right into unfamiliar,
“Oh,” Harry said, softly. Then, “Here,” he reached into his robes and pulled out two shrunken brooms, and held one out to Draco. “I brought these, just in case. You can see North America over there. It shouldn’t be a long flight.”
“Yes, but it’s an odd thing,” Draco said. “This morning, your magical core was nearly wiped, your heart rate was dangerously low, and your serotonin and dopamine levels were essentially non-existent. But right now, everything seems to be… thriving.” He flipped through Harry’s file. “Even that massive bruise on your back seems to have healed.”
“No, think about it, Harry, was your intent kindness or just a duty to do the right thing? At the time, you would have saved nearly anyone except Voldemort from that fire. Morally, you were incapable of leaving someone, even someone you hated to die. As soon as we were out, we parted still intent on hurting one another. But now, we’re friends, sort of."
Harry nearly snarled. He hoped Malfoy’s skin would bruise, a harsh blue ring around his neck that would stay visible above the flash of Command gold.
He has to stand, silent and fuming, while the owner of the curry place they go to every Friday trie to get Draco to return after closing — for a midnight snack.
it’s a blizzard on this tile,” Draco said. “There’s no wind, no humidity, but a fuckton to snow? Absolutely plausible!”
And so Draco sighed, a touch dramatic, a touch indifferent. “Fine,” he said. “Give me your trunk key, then, if you want to stay and keep your glorious winning streak. I’ll get them myself.”
“But sir, it’s said that your soulmate is your perfect match, a balancing and equal force that can complete you!” Diana shouted.
“Harry, how gravely are you injured?” Draco asked, levitating him up and out of the ichor pool with the most tender and gentle spellwork that Harry had ever felt.
an exquisite francophone, yes. Quebecois French uses more dialectical Anglicanisms, though, even without the Acadian influences.”
“Potter, you need to bloody stop that, or the grindylows are going to get ideas about mating season in here and start coming up the pipes,” Draco said.
“Shut it, Malfoy,” Harry said, biting his lip to keep from smiling. “Did you want to see the memory or not?”
They moved on to the first tile after the “Start”, a bright yellow one which bobbed under their feet but steadied enough for them to move to the next one. They hopped over the third tile, orange, in unison before landing on the vivid green fourth tile.
Harry brushed his hair back and chewed on his lip. “I don’t remember anyone attacking me. I had dismissed class and was just cleaning up after the messy buggers when I picked up a project with a bunch of runes on it and blacked out.”
“Is this what you Maquis do for fun?” Harry asked. He forcefully swallowed down the sigh of relief as the pain faded into a soft ache and then into nothingness. “Take breaks from mass genocide to aggravate the people forced to be around you?”
Harry didn’t remember what moves he used as they wrestled. He didn’t even really remember covering himself in oil --
“There’s nothing to record,” Harry said, weighing the odds of Malfoy attacking. He’d be able to fight, if he needed to. He’d done so before, with worse injuries and deadlier opponents — it’s what Dumbledore had trained him for. It’s how he knew he’d die someday, fighting through the pain to be the hero everyone needed. But the sear of pain that lanced through him with every shift of his pelvis made it clear that fighting right now wouldn’t be
“You mean, do I think we could have created a soul bond naturally, if we had not started as enemies?”
“You’ll be safe as long as you’re here, Harry,” McGonagall said, and Draco was, not for the first time, baffled at the tone of her voice when speaking to Harry. This was the most affectionate he had heard her speak to, well, anyone ever. “If they even find out where you’ve gone, they will have me and the entire staff to tackle before they could reach you.”
Harry sighed and tapped his whole foot on the tile this time, yanking it back immediately. When nothing happened again, Harry looked at Draco, licked his lips, straightened up, and stepped fully onto the orange tile.
“Well, it’s not like I’ve spent my life thinking that you were my soulmate or even believing in the phenomenon, but now that it seems a fact, I guess it fits.”
And the orange tile disappeared beneath Harry’s feet completely, leaving only an empty grey void beneath him.
“Yes! In 500AD, Aryabhata theorized the use of differential magi-calculus in chaos theory to invert universal probabilities! In a closed system, highly improbable occurrences become more frequent, and things that are statistically likely become virtually impossible!
Once upon a time, when Harry was with Ginny and he thought that was what he wanted, there were always plans in the back of his mind for a spontaneous proposal. He’d ask her to marry him the way he defeated Voldemort: when the instinct felt right, or when he felt like he was dying.
to Malfoy, to prove himself as someone Malfoy should surrender to. But what he did remember with sharp crystal clarity was the feel of Malfoy’s warm skin as it pressed against his thigh, his ribs, his cheek. He remembered the way his hands skimmed along the knobs of Malfoy’s spine, the way Malfoy’s breath heated the hair behind his ear.
“Ah, see?” The Collector said. “No one turns down my invitations.” They turned to Draco. “Have you come to give me an exchange?”
Oh. That was… actually a lot better. There was no adrenaline yet, but air started to come back into his lungs.
“I…” Harry swallowed, searching for anything to anchor him in this moment and to stop him from flying apart at the seams.
Draco perked up, examining mode in full swing. He looked beautiful, Harry thought fleetingly, his eyes alight and determined. Harry shook himself. He couldn’t go around thinking about Draco as
There had been one kiss, only one. One kiss that was biting and familiar and desperate and sweet and perfect, perfect, perfect. One kiss, under the fireworks for Guy Fawkes, before Draco had pulled away, running his fingers carefully, reverently along Harry’s chin, and said, “never again.”
“Victoria, darling, treacle tarts are my fiance’s absolute favorite dessert. It’s still only 9am. We won’t get to dessert till around 6 or 7, I’d wager. Would it be possible to scramble and get some in time? It’s just that one of my vows is that I plan to do everything possible to make this man happy, and I’d hate to break it on the first day of my marriage.”
“Oh, but Potter,” Malfoy said, spreading his bare arms. “Neither of us are wearing a uniform right now. Isn’t that the point of this
to love. He had known going in, even as Harry talked about liking the idea of a secret relationship out of the public eye. Even as Harry talked about keeping things casual, with no attachments, no consequences.
. And yet, somehow, I’m so stupidly in love with great idiotic Harry Potter that I actually find this whole farce endearing! Charming! Practically heart-melting!” Draco glared up at the atmosphere, to where Merlin himself had probably settled for the rest of his immortality. “Is this because I was a Death Eater? Is this the penance I have to pay for the rest of my life?”
Harry’s hands scrabbled against the wall behind him for any kind of stability but slid, slick from the oil, weak from the realization that Malfoy’s mouth was steadily ruining him for any other touch he would ever have on his skin again. Harry was gasping, breathless from the pleasure, winded from the awareness that Malfoy on his knees had Harry completely at his mercy.
“I am perfectly capable of hating you for dragging me into this and still maintaining perfect spell form,” Draco snapped, and wrapped up the kneeling, burly one in an
The air surged out of Harry chest and wisped away into wind roaring around them. The glowing adrenaline of being on top of the world with Draco by his side had seeped away. Harry had proposed and Draco hadn’t murdered him. But this wasn’t exactly better.
wants the smuggler case. That case file has been sitting in the break room, and everyone’s been avoiding it like a Blast-Ended Skrewt.” He glared. “For
Harry sighed, this topic came up in February every year like clockwork, it was just a matter of which lovestruck young witch brought it up first. Since there was no avoiding it, he decided he may as well answer. “Because Samantha, soulmates are from a much older time in wizarding history. Back then, people tended to live in very small communities and very seldom ventured more than three or four cities away from where they were born. It was much easier back then. These days, people tend to lead much more complicated lives and move around much more frequently. Also a marriage bond with one’s soulmate isn’t the only type of fulfilling and loving relationship. People don’t need the stars or fate to match them to a partner who will love them unconditionally throughout their lives. In fact, less than 5 percent of the population even finds their soulmate anymore, and, in those cases, it’s usually just a lucky accident.”
The shout as Harry came was hoarse and halfway sobbing, but Malfoy held him through it and licked him clean after. Harry fought, with every atom of strength left, to not let his legs give out. The fissures beneath his ribs and around his heart had fractured, had splintered the very foundation of his universe.  Malfoy stood, calm and composed, and tucked Harry back into his kisbet, carefully and gently, all while Harry tried to remember how to breathe.
“Yeah! I didn’t really master the dice until after I landed on a space full of bobtuber puss, so things are a bit, er, slimy.” Harry took a breath. “Which I think I deserve, for the dick things I did. I shouldn’t have kept you a secret from everybody. I shouldn’t have ever done
silent. It had felt like roaring, the way neither of them looked away as they stripped off shirts, boots, socks. It had felt like the tuning of a symphony, the way Malfoy’s mercury grey eyes stared into his as they both undid their pants and let them drop to the floor. It had felt like the snap of an ion storm, the way they both pulled off the last of their clothes and stood in front of each other, bare and unyielding.
Then he stomped back to where Harry was, and yanked at the ropes around him. “If you’re not insane, does this mean you’re an idiot?” Draco flicked his wand to cut Harry bonds, then picked up the ropes and threw them over the wing with a yell. “Harry,
, pathetically in love with you, but left with closed doors, and secret rendezvous, and whatever bones you throw me!”
“Nah, I wouldn’t let a powerful secret like that get out. It’d just be for you and me,” Potter said, and the corners of his mouth were also twitching, very noticeably upward. He paused, flicked his eyes from the tiles, to Draco’s face, to his shoes, and back to Draco’s face. “Maybe it’d help make up for things a bit, for the way they’re treating you.”
And so Draco stood at Weasley’s nod, overtly bored with his Ancient Runes textbook. He strode over to where they were playing and watched for a round or two as Harry got trounced pretty bloody badly by Longbottom.
“Did it ever occur to you that I feel exactly the same way?” Harry leaned in and took Draco’s lips in a kiss that began gently but quickly became heated.
“My place is a bit small, I know the house you’re talking about, it used to be my great aunt's. That sounds fine...” Draco said, looking away awkwardly.
“Once they’ve met I hear that there is a magical bond that forms between them, is that true?” Diana had a moonstruck face as she perched her chin on her hands.
It was everything. It was too much. The heat of Malfoy’s mouth, the pressure of Malfoy’s fingers, the cluster of revelations casually tossed at Harry’s feet. They could never be what they were, not after this. But they could forge something new, perhaps. Something mighty.
“Probably barely,” Harry called back, and it was like a dance: throw a quick shield spell around Draco here, sidestep a curse there, and an instinctive pivot to let Draco move around him to launch an attack of his own. “Think of all the other things I’ve done to make you hate me. This is a treat in comparison!”
“I don’t care,” Draco snapped. “He has a reputation for being immature with his money and his sexual conquests and his attire. Yet, somehow, it’s a reputation that’s
Potter’s mouth let out something suspiciously close to a chortle. “Can you do better, then? Is carrying a tune one of those weird posh things they train you in, like with using too many different forks and flouncing down a marble staircase?”
?” Harry nodded and Draco tilted his head, regarding him. “And you decided to stay with me until I woke up? How very noble of you.”
“Do you remember when we used to chase each other around Hogwarts?” Malfoy said, pulling from the end of Harry’s cock with a soft
“I cancelled them and replaced them with miniature lemon ricotta cheesecakes. They are much more appropriate for a summer wedding. Don’t you agree dear?”
And there, like a firecracker, like a shout, like a perfect spell in a duel beside his partner, the adrenaline came exploding back. “You love me?” Harry asked.
“Draco, thank you,” Harry said. “I’m sorry, but thank you. If I could even stand up, I think I would kiss you right now.”
Draco tilted his head in acknowledgement. “You’re not wrong. Technically, I wasn’t the first Healer sent to deal with you, though. You’ve been out for nearly three days, and practically every medical professional in here had a crack at you before I came along.”
“No one else does!” Draco snapped. “Because people cross the street to avoid me! There’s a public list of shops that won’t sell to me! I’m a perfect secret fuck for you because the only job I can have is in my basement potions lab! You’re the person everyone talks about, but not the way they
Draco saw it, then, how this conversation could go. Potter would try and bring up why exactly Draco gets the worst assignments, the most paperwork, the hardest evaluations, and the smallest office. Draco would make a pointed remark about why exactly Potter shows up every morning looking like he hadn’t slept at all the night before. The words would turn into barbs, and every second would become an increasingly tense reminder of what had happened the last time Draco and Potter were alone in a bathroom together.
He went out of the room, leaving a strained silence behind him. Draco was confused. Had he said something wrong?
“They identify one another when they first touch with a feeling of love or kind-- OH! I was falling! You meant to help me, you touched me with kind intent, you’d never done that before!”
Sam shrugged, looking embarrassed. “I meant to say “by the ocean” but I guess I got that wrong as well.”
“You’re going to wait a while,” Harry said. “I don’t have a spouse, or parents, or children, or even a crup. No one will come.”
. The sharp agony of it snapped along his nerves, and Harry couldn’t stop his recoil, unable to struggle and blinking through tears as Malfoy rolled away into a defensive crouch. Of
Draco frowned, thinking. “Oh, right, I remember. I was about to keep you from falling and then everything went black.”
Draco nodded, it wasn’t a surprising question. His mother saw more of Harry now than he did, now that she was trying to mend her relationship with Aunt Andromeda. “Bloody determined to get me married, but quite lovely otherwise.”
,” Potter said with such sincerity that Draco had to bite back a startled snicker. “I bet you’d even
when you punched me in the balls,” Harry snapped. He could stand now, but the throbbing pull of his groin meant he’d be unable to walk with any dignity for a long while yet. “Don’t even pretend to be surprised that it was against the rules.” He shifted enough to make it seem as if getting his back against the near wall was only happenstance. It wasn’t strategically sound, but it at least gave him fortification.
They probably shouldn’t. Yet the statistically impossible kneazle looked at Draco with improbable eyes, and it was an opportunity he would never get in his life again.
“This isn’t coercion, Potter,” Malfoy said. “You get to choose. I order you to take these off, or I order you to accept my authority and walk away. Simple enough.”
The moan that rocked out of Harry’s mouth was deep and damning. He was helpless to it, for all that it was he who stood over Malfoy in the wide, empty Holodeck. Malfoy’s lips slid down his shaft like a match burning down to ash, the flicks of his tongue wreaking carnage in Harry’s soul with ruthless precision.
“It means that rather than acting as a pull to me, it acted as a bond to me. But since my magic was never pulled it was never in the beacon, it simply bound
“All we know is that this beacon demands a specific consensual act to seal the bond,” Draco said, pinching his nose. “A kiss, or marriage, or magic-melding, or even sharing blood. Yet the maker apparently didn’t find the particulars important enough to be actually
“Well, that’s much better than the orange tile,” Harry said, and plopped face-first right into them.
“But despite the risk, for that sort of bond, wouldn’t it all be worth it? To have the person that completes you and loves you unconditionally?”
Harry suddenly burst into the door, panting like he had frantically sprinted up the stairs himself. “Draco, no, wait! Don’t open the trunk! My gloves are on the bedside table, and there’s nothing…”
So Harry had slammed them against the mats and tried to choke Malfoy, and got a punch in the balls for his efforts.
“What?” Harry said looking down at him. “I was just thinking, five months ago, I woke up in a world where I was alone and doomed to be married to a woman I didn’t want, and then you showed up as a patient in my hospital and turned everything upside down. You never can just be boring can you, Harry?”
and all. Things were very different here. Harry and Draco went to Quidditch matches together on weekends, got curry together, crashed on each others’ couch, and stole each others’ cold tea during long cases. But they weren’t together. There had never even been a hint of it — no drunken half-confession, no tentative bump of fingers against each other, no charged near-kiss under the mistletoe. He wanted it, though. Harry proposed to Draco because his instinct felt like this was the most right thing to do in the world, and Draco was going to murder him for it.
Draco looked up from Harry’s file. Antagonistic runes were practically the foundation of curse work. “The investigators found nothing like that around you. Do you remember what the project looked like?”
Harry shook his head. “Okay, I sort of get that: rare things will happen a lot, and common things won’t really happen. How does that help us?”
“Good morning, Mr. Malfoy,” said the cheerful blonde, handing over a clip board as servers poured in carrying trays of food.
It was true. Of the four smugglers, only three were really fighting — the burly one quaked at the trembling turbulence of the plane, and stayed on his hands and knees during each shudder, cursing in what sounded like French. Draco had already secured the passengers, despite having never seen a Muggle plane before this morning, and Harry was pretty certain he knew where the contraband was stashed. This wasn’t even a fight, it was recreation.
Harry swallowed at the heat that burned under his skin. It started at his throat and fluttered past his constricted lungs, before drifting further, deeper down. He huffed and flicked his fingers in the tiny scrap of space between them. “
Which is why Potter had no excuse to wander out of his office and into the downstairs bathroom to sing like a collapsing accordion whenever he felt bored.
Draco’s eyes widened, but it only took a moment for him to school his features in an expression of curious interest.
His eyes drifted to Draco a lot. Between the reporters and Hermione’s insistence on limiting any impact to an already volatile, beacon-forced bond, they were stuck at Grimmauld. It wasn’t like he could
It was a regulation move, what Malfoy did. But it made the breath in Harry’s lungs feel rampant, made the burn in his blood feel unchecked and egregious.
Malfoy watched him. Harry could tell even with his eyes closed. He knew that Malfoy watched him process what this choice would mean, how this choice changed the very orbit the two of them had, circling around each other.
“Me neither,” Draco said. “And I want to keep moving.” He looked to the die. “May we have our next roll, please?”
Draco needed to focus on his breathing. On the pressing pain that squeezed against his sternum. He couldn’t care this much about what happens to Harry,
It was Draco who figured out that the kidnapper was Fae, who spent whole nights in archives and who emerged with records of similar events documented from hundreds of years ago. It was Draco who triangulated a 30 kilometre radius where the Collector was situated from hundreds of different forests.
are standing on the wing, dodging curses from Canadian wizards. If you dare try to convince me that this is how the Muggles do it, I swear I will launch you right off this thing.”
And so Draco hands stretched out to catch him, his fingers brushing past Harry’s elbow in an attempt to steady him.
“Never again,” Draco had repeated. “We can’t ever kiss again, Harry. Not when you’re this close to finally fading from every front page and celebrity gossip rag. You could finally have a life where you can get groceries without reporters watching your every move. And there’s no way you’d get that if you kept kissing a Death Eater.”
“Er,” Harry said. “I had that thing with Malcolm Preece in Eighth year. You know, the Hufflepuff seeker?”
Then he carefully, strategically, ran his fingers along the nape of Harry’s neck, just under the hairline, saying, “Harry, can I borrow those Quidditch gloves of yours now? You said I could at breakfast, and never got around to giving them to me.”
“It’s a shortcut,” Draco said, stunned. “There are still about 80 or 90 tiles to go, but the end is in sight.”
“The dice likes you more than me,” Harry said. “The blue card says that we get a ’prize’ if we roll a Seven while standing on a white tile, by the way.”
But then he was gone, in a wisp of smoke, and all that was left was a metal key and a folded piece of paper. When Harry knelt down to grab it, he opened it to see the sharp black words:
“We’re not fucking, Harry!” Draco was pacing small circles on the limited space of the airplane wing. “We’ve haven’t even kissed. We haven’t even held hands.”
just to prove his point. “Go on an arial plane with me, he says. It’s like being on a broom, he says. An eight-bloody-hour flight to Montreal will be an experience,
to let his eyes waver, blink, stray. And yet, he somehow knew every line and inch of Malfoy’s body, had it somehow seared into his brain with more permanence than the heat death of the universe.
Draco drew in a sharp breath but quickly tried to cover it by clearing his throat. “So. Soulmates. I wish I could say I’m surprised.”
Draco manoeuvred himself out of his chair and squeezed out the door, heading to the stairs. The downstairs bathrooms were the closest to the trainee offices, and used almost constantly. Draco knew this because his office was, of course, directly above the bathrooms, allowing him to hear every single miserable flush that came out of them.
It had felt like the rumble of a pending avalanche, the way Malfoy pulled the tight black kisbet over the jutting bones of his hips while Harry tried to follow suit. It had felt like the gasp of a star collapsing into a black hole, the way Malfoy strode over to one of the tureens, picked one up, tilted it over his body, and let the oil slide along his sharp shoulders, his sternum, and down his shins to the soles of his feet. The oil pressed the kisbet even closer to Malfoy’s skin and glistened through the fine golden hairs that dusted his chest.
“The reports all mention it,” Draco pressed his lips together. “Let me do a manual check. Can you take off your shirt?”
“Draco, you’re bloody brilliant,” Harry said, and popped the last of a treacle tart into his mouth. “The perfect man. Can we bring this probability thing on vacation with us?
Harry’s ears were still ringing from the force of his orgasm, the static of his synapses too slow to fully process Malfoy’s words. He hadn’t even gotten the feeling back in his fingers, and Malfoy was already back in his uniform, breaking regulation by rolling up the sleeves to show the sharp black snake on his skin.
“Oh please, that's a silly muggle superstition, besides, have you forgotten? We’re already magically bonded. Unfortunately, I’m stuck with you whether I like it or not.”
“Your fault for not agreeing to go to Fiji,” Harry said, peering over Draco’s shoulder. “It’s odd that he didn’t mention your name. I put it down with mine on all the forms.”
He walked about the room, tidying up before lunch, when he spotted an unusual object on the floor. Was he this messy when he was their age? He could hear Hermione in his brain shouting that no, he was much worse, but these kids would lose their heads if they weren’t attached. He noticed a small object on the ground near one of the desks,  He figured he’d best pick it up and store it in his desk until someone claimed it. He squatted down and examined it. It looked like someone's ancient runes project. He didn’t know much about the subject, but he did know that this crudely done work was surely not going to get a passing grade. He sighed and picked it up, when suddenly he felt himself spinning and the world went black.
Draco grinned to himself thinking, maybe, just maybe this was going to be ok. Maybe something good was finally happening to him.
Draco’s cheeks were pinked, and the fingers on Harry’s skin were freezing cold. Harry wanted to tell Draco how beautiful he was, but figured he should probably say something that didn’t show how obviously head over heels he was.
Voldemort, who calmly destroyed a ship carrying Harry’s parents, Neville’s parents, and thousands of other Starfleet officers, just to make a political statement about the ideals
They stilled. “Clever hero,” they said. “If I hadn’t planned on collecting your magic, I’d take your cleverness instead. Or your scars. But know this: I know many things, and the magic of some is greater than the magic of others. Magic willingly given is satisfying. Magic willingly sacrificed for love is exceptional.” They came closer. “Who receives an invitation is no accident. The invitation goes to whoever loves you more dearly than anyone else in the world. Only they can see the writing on the invitation, and only they come. And I want to know who exactly will receive yours.”
Once he got back, and it was clear that Harry was gone, they’d probably toss him in Azkaban. The Aurors had already spent years looking for a good excuse, anyways. Maybe Draco could just provoke a Dementor into sucking out his soul. Then he’d be fine, because nothing would ever hurt again.
Draco vaguely noticed Hermione and McGonagall exchange looks and even Sam looked perplexed. But Harry’s face was what drew his attention, it was oddly blank and expressionless, his eyes shiny.
He woke up in his flat, on the couch that was actually more comfortable than his bed. He tried to sit up, groaned, and saw Draco poke his head into the room.
?” Harry was gasping, adrift in sensation and information and emotions he wasn’t ready to name. He dragged his eyes away from the sight of Malfoy’s lips on his skin to see where Malfoy’s hands were, reaching for a tureen of oil.
“Your victory is only momentary,” the Collector said, even though their head was tilted very precisely in order to keep their horns from brushing the rowan berries. “Goodbye, meagre hero. I’ll have your magic before the moon sets.”
“Because, as you so succinctly put it, I’d ruin your reputation,” Draco said. How was Harry not catching onto this? “By now the whole Ministry and at least half the press knows it’s
Harry shrugged. “I do what I can to keep up the reputation. Plus it wasn’t so much a decision as it was a way to stay sane.”
Potter’s office was massive compared to Draco’s. It took two whole strides to get from the door to the desk,
“Hey, where do you want to go after this?” Harry asked. “I’m feeling like I can be convinced of a secluded weekend in St. Petersburg after all.”
“Such a gorgeous bird you’ve got, ‘arry,” Hagrid purrs under his nose, stroking her beautiful grey feathers with his giant fingers as she eats.
There’s a cool hand on his ankle, and Harry swears into his pillow, pulling his knee up to his chest.
Harry doesn’t know how to react. If he should be worried or happy, whether it’s a deep physiological trauma he’s being introduced to or an odd, kind of darkish sense of humour. Still, rereading the
“I just hope the letter is not about that. In any case, there are ink and parchment on the second shelf.”
It’s true, he hates thinking about his stupid crush. His obsession with Malfoy had never supposed to be what it was. An obsession with a vain, self-centered, cruel pure-blood. The Boy Who Lived and a Death Eater’s son. Later a Death Eater himself.
“Tell me what you want me to say, Gin,” he murmurs again, his eyes not leaving hers, and he almost sees the familiar resistance of green and red between them, how fucking ironic. So ironic he’s ready to break down and cry, but this time Ginny doesn’t say a word in return. She only stares at him, wide-eyed and petrified, lips pressed together tightly, teeth clenched, cheeks burning insanely hot. Harry shortly nods and leaves the Common Room, hoping that she has just finally understood.
“I forgot I have to feed the slugs,” he says, standing up. “Ye can wait for me here, if yev got nothin’ to do.”
yet again i don’t think i’ll ever be tired of thanking you for leaving kudos and such wonderful comments. it means so much for me, i mean it. i can’t say i’m super active on tumblr but if you’d like to rant about any hp related stuff or...well literally anything — i’m @dracovsbuckbeak on there. feel free to hit me up
“Fuck!” he jumps a little only when the owl bites his finger suddenly. In our realm, its huge eyes look into him expectantly and a little skeptically, and Harry can do nothing but roll his eyes a little.
After reading the letter, Harry sits in his chair and stares at the distance, at nothing in particular, his vision unfocused, chest rising up and down slowly. His head hurts a little bit, right in the center of his forehead, but it’s not intolerable.
Harry catches himself cringing and immediately feels bad about it. He has so many advantages, he should feel so grateful, he should be all but stunned with the thought of spending his life as an Auror. But at the same time there’s this growing and nagging reminder that all that is just because he did what he had to do, he fought who he had to fight, he is the Golden Boy. And now he’s expected to lead a happy life of a magic policeman just because fifteen year old him thought it’d be cool.
“Because I would get away with this. No one would object, maybe except Hermione, although a lot of people would be disappointed. I just...I don’t know,” Harry shrugs helplessly, sipping his tea. “I don’t want it. I would blame myself forever.”
This class practically begs for excitement Draco thinks as he rolls up his sleeves and hears a sharp intake of breath behind him. He grins. Operation Get Harry, a multiple-step, highly classified, process to make Harry less oblivious to his attraction to him, Draco, the self-proclaimed handsomest man in school is working perfectly. Draco pats his arse, looking for the piece of paper he “left” in his pocket. He makes sure to liberally pat his bum and brush over both cheeks repeatedly, just to make sure that he doesn't “accidentally” miss the piece of paper.
“Paris is beautiful this time of year isn’t it?” Draco says as he gazes at the rival Eiffel Tower and the houses below surrounded by lights. They were in France searching for a potions smuggling ring that they were investigating for their job as Aurors.
“Nothing,” Draco says and clears his throat. “I was just saying... Draco looks around wildly. “What a nice day.”
Harry smiles and says, “I thought my feelings wouldn’t be returned.” He walks to the stone bench newly placed under the willow tree.
At least in Step 3, Draco got Harry to sleep with him, but he needs to go a step further. Get Harry absolutely and irrevocably jealous by flirting with other people.
“Well, you could say that I was really nervous too. All these new feelings rising up,” Harry says as he thinks about how beautiful Draco looked in the dark and how soft his hair was.
Hermione is preparing for the New Years party that night and like the overachiever she is, she is reading -- a lot.
Well, Draco mused the start of his plan went well, not perfect because Harry didn’t jump him, but not terrible because he still got a reaction. Draco figures step two will get Harry to — Jump him? Date him?
“Potter?” Draco questions as he hears the door to the Astronomy tower open, nervous about sneaking out for once with that horrible Umbridge woman running the school. He sighs in relief when Potter’s unruly hair comes into view, then frowns when Potter seems only panicked.
Hermione looks up from her large tomb to look at the book, New Year’s Superstitions, and says, “That one’s pointless, frankly, eating twelve grapes for good luck or kissing a person at midnight sounds quite like a fool’s hope.”
Draco’s skin is hot, but his arse is perfect and shapely in his tight altered pants Harry thinks. Harry is sure he has a dopey expression and quickly schools it into one of nonchalance to hide his less pure thoughts when Draco stands up and walks by his desk to turn in his paper, another one about the Goblin Wars, then jumps when he feels Draco’s hand on his thigh.
Draco runs up the stairs, panting from escaping Filch and Mrs. Norris, hoping he is in time to see the firework show at Hogsmeade from the Astronomy tower. His father had told him, after not allowing Draco to come home for his first Christmas since starting Hogwarts, that every year Hogsmeade has a New Year’s celebration that you can see from the highest tower. His mother had sent cinnamon and ginger cookies made by his favorite elf Milly with instant hot chocolate with candy cane crumbles and miniature marshmallows.
“Malfoy,” Potter responds. Harry leans in to say more when he hears footsteps outside of the door. “Quick, under the cloak,” he says to Malfoy.
Jeez, these people are serious idiots, they wouldn’t recognize flirting if it hit them over the head which Draco was practically doing right now.
Harry turns and beams at Draco, then, hands him one of two oversized bags. He leans in and puts his hand over Draco’s and starts pulling the bag forwards.
Draco still “can't find” his pencil so he lifts Harry’s leg a little — by his inner thigh, suspiciously near his hardening prick, then “spots” his pencil on the ground. He leans down making sure to brush his arm then face on Harry’s lap and picks up his pencil only to drop it again when Harry grabs his wrist.
“Hey Hermione,” Harry says as he leans over the chair Hermione has been sitting on for the past eight hours. “You forgot this one.”
Draco ignores the slight giggling in the background, making sure to avoid eye contact with Harry. “Well, at least someone liked my pants,” Draco hisses.
Draco beams, ignoring the last comment because obviously, Harry doesn’t know the subtle art of flirting and considers Step 4 a slight win. At least Harry likes his pants.
“Harry,” Draco says as he strides up to Harry’s quickly retreating figure. Harry had become increasingly flustered every History of Magic class ever since that fateful and noteworthy pencil in the lap situation five days ago. Draco had made sure to keep showing skin and brushing past Harry with similar effects, blushing and stuttering, but with no actual results. With an almost predatory gait, Draco catches up to Harry and swings an arm over the smaller boy's shoulders.
“Malfoy,” Harry responds, slightly surprised to see the always impeccable blonde boy with rumpled hair and a wooly blanket with snowflakes and Christmas trees carrying a basket. “What are you doing here?”
Unfortunately, Draco was in a board meeting, but he didn’t care. Draco grabs Harry and spins him around, kissing him soundly on the mouth.
Draco snuggles more into Harry’s arms. They are at Grimmauld Place in the garden setting of their own miniature firework show with their friends and families.
Draco decides to skip Step 6, Try and Date other people to make Harry jealous, but, who's that boy walking out of the Charms class with him?
“Class hurry up, don’t dawdle,” Flitwick says in a chirpy voice instantly catching Draco’s attention.
Red, Green, Blue fireworks lit up the sky and formed dragons, flowers, unicorns that danced, but Harry is distracted by Draco who takes his hand and presses a featherlight kiss on his palm as midnight struck.
Draco goes back to his desk and decides to let up on Harry for the day — or hour to save the poor boy from having a heart attack, but as he shifts in his chair he knows that Step 1 of Operation Get Harry is a success.
Harry pauses and visibly gapes for about five minutes, his eyes following the water that slides lower and lower. Then he straightens up and bolts out of the room.
I am so sorry for the shorter and shorter chapters. This fic was actually just supposed to be one long page, but since schools started I need some extra incentive to finish, hence the short chapters.
“Hey Draco,” Harry whispers as he grins down at the head of blonde hair currently resting on his chest. “How’s the movie?”
In an attempt to salvage the situation, Draco says, “Well, names don’t matter when you like you do.” He says, “I forgot your name as soon as I looked at your face,” and to finally garner a compliment for himself, he blurts out, “don’t you like my pants too?”
Draco looks at his enemy and decides New Year’s is not the time for arguments and spreads his blanket.
Draco just thinks about how comfortable and muscular Harry’s thighs are. His warm chest and steady heartbeat lull Draco to sleep.
Just another inch Harry begs in his head as Draco stretches his arms over his head, shirt rising to show the tantalizing view of lower back dimples. He's in History of Magic, his last class of the day sitting behind his former enemy turned wanking fantasy.
In the shower he starts humming, a mix of Sexy and I Know It and I’m Too Sexy. He makes sure to get his hair and body as wet and hot as he can, then looks at the clock. Five minutes left.
Harry wonders if he will see Malfoy this year after the debacle with the Potter Stinks badges, but is pleasantly surprised when the door opens and Malfoy steps through.
Draco leaves History in a huff slightly angry at Buck oh wait Burke, Blake? Whatever, some B word, he thinks as he stomps down the corridor ignoring Harry who holds open the door for him. Harry had seemed pretty attentive to him during and even after Step 3, Scary Movie Night, but it is still not enough. Obviously, Harry is paying attention to him all the time because of his proximity, but not anymore. Draco, that’s right is going to give Harry the silent treatment.
“Shhh,” Draco says as he smirks while groping very near Harry’s nether regions. Draco had decided on doing the classic pencil drop, but, instead of on the ground, he dropped it onto Harry’s lap.
Draco shifts forward in his chair, well aware of Harry sitting behind him, boring holes into his back. It serves him right to be pinning right now after the whole running and blushing debacle that occurred whenever he saw Draco the entire week. Draco had shown all of his cards on Monday by kissing Harry’s cheek as thanks after Harry walked him to the Charms classroom and held open the door. They were practically dating anyway with how much time they already spent together.
Harry once again let his mind wander off to places filled with Draco and pleasure as he languidly stroked him, neither bothered by the awkward angle. Draco moved his hips, lightly biting Harry’s ear and Harry wondered about Veela. He wondered whether all male Veela were so virile, toned and musky, and so utterly irresistible. He buried his nose in the crook of Draco’s neck, in that soft spot right above his collarbone and wondered if what they were doing made him Draco’s mate, if it meant Draco wanted that at all, and if it was even a thing. The thought alone made his heart jump, the prospect of being
“I assure you it’s been thoroughly cleaned,” Draco murmured, already getting hard—at the solid feel of Harry under him, at the possibility of fucking him in the infamous sinner’s chair.
big enough to fit a small, cheap desk. Even with his chair out of the way, the door could only open three-quarters of the way before it knocked into the desk drawer that wouldn’t properly close, jarring the unstable lighting charm into flickering violently for a minute or so.
What the Aurors did know about this entity was unpleasant at best: someone called the Collector had swept through the British Isles the last few months, vanishing people into thin air. Someone else would get a note, offering a choice — willingly trade their magic for the return of their loved one, hale and whole. Those who agreed were effectively rendered Squibs. Nothing, not a single trace of magic was left. Those who didn’t agree kept their magic, but their loved one was never seen again.
for Harry Potter. And then you’ll go.” He shook his head at Harry’s stunned face. “Can I have a roll, please?”
The plane dipped and they both wobbled, steadied. Harry focused on his wrists. Until Draco let go, Harry would go through a lot to keep them there, even if the plane fell out of the sky.
“I may be a genocidal Maquis, Potter,” Malfoy said, “but I’m still your commanding officer. If I really felt like aggravating you, I could ask Granger to put you on my personal security detail, and you’d have to follow me day and night. I might just do so anyways. It might help you learn to respect my authority.”
at the poor girl behind the desk and say ‘can you save us, love?’ Disgusting." Draco flung his hands up in the air. “Pulling her while I was
“Voldemort’s last orders for us were to get into a glorified freighter and follow your ship, sending out a long-range message to something called the ‘Caretaker’ in the hopes it would kill you,” Malfoy said. “It was a suicide mission. But it was either that or face down Voldemort’s own private brand of justice for the disloyal. It was an easy choice.”
“It means that to complete the bond, and for Draco’s magic to mix with yours as well, you two need to kiss. At sunset, by the Great Lake.”
Harry felt Draco’s long fingers wrap around his wrist pulling him up. “Well, Potter? What have you got to say for yourself to redeem this farce of a situation?”
“Sorry, Minerva, I had to sick up behind the gargoyles,” he mumbled at the floor. “I Vanished it but I think some of the smell lingers.”
“Okay, ladies, calm down. Soulmate bond separation is extremely rare and usually done in cases where one of them already has a spouse, in instances of incompatible goals for their lives or varying outside factors. As to magical means of attracting one’s soulmate, those are very old spells and nobody is quite sure how or if they work. Also, they can be dangerous, if you have no idea where the other person is, if they are living, or what their situation is. Not to mention, you may have pulled a totally unwilling person into your world and form an incomplete bond. Now may we continue with the lesson, Ms. Jordan?”
“Roughly 6.6 divided by 10 to the power of 34,” Draco said. “Muggles call it Planck’s Constant, but Wizards have been using ice in fire lizards as a measure of magical probability for millennia. Why?”
Maquis would represent. After that, it was a campaign for the “genetic purity” of spacefaring, and soon Voldemort’s black mark of a fleet, curling in formation like a giant snake amongst the stars, became the symbol of everything Starfleet fought against.
Malfoy gave a halfway wheezing huff of laughter, then slammed his fist down hard into the crux between Harry’s legs. Harry’s training let him catalogue the injury, noting that it was technically an impact to his pelvic girdle. Functionally, though, it was a
Harry’s cock stiffened and throbbed, the ache in his groin far different than what it was before — and far, far worse. He tried to ground himself, to press his teeth together, to count to ten in Andorian. But it wasn’t enough to stop the way Malfoy’s command thrummed through his bones. Not enough to stop his body’s heady response to the shape of Malfoy’s body, kneeling at Harry’s feet and absolutely certain of his power. “You’re abusing your power,” he gritted out.
record in grudging admiration. Plus, even though he never took credit for it, it was an open secret that Draco kept investing his savings in unknown shops and restaurants and artisans and turning every single one into the best new discovery in wizarding London, and so Draco had people following him everywhere trying to get wind of the next big thing.
“I know,” Draco said softly. “And I love you too much to let you sacrifice that for someone like me.”
Harry was really grateful for that sticking spell. There was no more turbulence, and the wind was no stronger than before, but his boots cemented to the wing was the only thing in the world stopping him from sliding off the edge into the wide, wide blue below.
“That’s what you wanted when you brought me here, wasn’t it?” Malfoy said. He pressed the palm of his hand into the wall beside Harry’s head, close enough for the smell of olive oil and skin to fill every breath Harry took. “To make me submit? Fall back into the intimidation pranks we used to play on each other at Hogwarts? Haven’t you played enough big boy war games to learn that power doesn’t always belong to the one who huffs and puffs the most? We’re both different from when we were at the Academy, Potter. That’s not how power works out in the deep dark depths of space.”
Draco was yelling. Not frowning, yelling and throwing. The thrill of the fight was still in Harry’s veins, even as his heart was lurching, because his body never understood that being in this kind of danger was bad.
“How come this didn’t manifest itself before?” Draco’s voice woke Harry from his reverie. “I mean, we have touched each other in the past.” He looked down at his hands, his cheeks tinted a lovely pink shade. “Like when you saved me from the fiendfyre,” he added so quietly that Harry almost missed it.
“Fantastic,” Draco snatched the broom from Harry, enlarged it, then made to straddle it. “Aren’t you coming?”
“As long as there’s consent, there’s no problem,” Draco said, cutting Hermione off. “And I’ll be happy to help you access all of your magic again. I mean, that’s what friends do, isn’t it?”
“Then let me show you,” Malfoy murmured. He leaned deep into Harry’s space “Let me show you exactly how I can maintain Command when I’m
“You plan to maintain your authority like this?” Harry asked, trying to ignore the shameless display his kisbet, unable to hide where the flush of heat in his body had settled. Trying to not betray what the sight of Malfoy on his knees did to Harry’s heart and mind and entire understanding of how the two of them were supposed to
Harry reached for Draco’s hand, and Draco just let his fingers get pulled into the grip. The pressure on his sternum had swelled into a churning in his belly as well, and Draco’s heart refused to pinpoint why.
“Draco,” Harry said, and he couldn’t breathe again. His ribs were collapsing and his heart was expanding and he was glowing and terrified and ecstatic.
“Thought that I joined for the gleeful opportunity of galaxy-wide murder?” Malfoy asked, lipping at Harry’s balls. The balls that Malfoy had
, I said that already. Are you paying attention, Harry? This is the order things are supposed to go.”
Draco bit his lip. “If we jump over, does that count as landing on it?” He turned to the die. “Can we have another roll, please? So we can
, and the two of them had been left staring each other down. There were no change rooms, no privacy screens, no convenient nooks. And no way to oil wrestle while still wearing Starfleet uniforms.
Harry thought he would very much like to be done with this topic, but he continued, “No, soulmates do not instinctively recognize their match. Usually, they become bonded once they come into intimate mutual contact with each other. The contact is said to require an element of love or kindness. That can be anything from a first kiss, to helping them up off the ground after they’ve fallen. Once that connection is made, a bond is formed, it is up to the participants of the bond to share it or sever it, although I hear severance can be painful if both parties don’t consent.”
