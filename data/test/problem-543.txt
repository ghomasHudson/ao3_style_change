"Come on, Potter," he said. "We haven't even found a record shop."
"Music," said Harry. "Usually when I have a Bad Day I listen to something terribly depressing and it makes me feel… weirdly better."
Harry didn't follow this apparent non-sequitur. Until he realised, at which point he stopped breathing for a moment.
"Oh, take me now!" cried a third-year, and dived. Harry dodged and threw himself through the portrait hole. Hermione jumped, and slammed it behind them.
Harry jumped, but mercifully it was just Malfoy, coming up from the dungeons a little way behind him. Harry stuck his wand in his pocket.
Harry wrote to his Mind Healer to confirm his appointment. He replied to Narcissa, assuring her that Draco had comported himself with the utmost dignity and decency whilst living in the house, and that his departure was entirely Harry's fault.
Harry winced, a look Andromeda politely ignored as she led Harry into the living room. It was a small terrace, painted in bright whites and lemon yellows, ruthlessly tidy and bursting with plants and vases conspicuously arranged above waist height.
"Oh, right," said the guy, laughing. "You really are all over the place. Let me have a look." He turned to the cabinets, and Harry glanced at Malfoy, who was scowling at the man's back. He caught Harry looking, and turned away towards one of the record boxes. Harry stuck his nose in another box, judging each album mostly on covers. He lingered on an image of several naked bodies pressed together in a line, wondering if it were a good enough reason to buy an album in itself.
Harry cracked up.
"He told us a bit," said Dean slowly. "I don't think he represented it to us in quite the way you're representing it now, though. Malfoy, are you gay?"

"Then he started saying I needed to get up off the sofa, that I was going to get fat, so I started getting back to the cooking and cleaning. But everything felt
"Shut up," said Harry. "And give it back. Before I tell the whole school you stuck your tongue down my throat."
"Alright, Harry," said Dean with a grin. "Come and meet Derek, Ritchie, Jack and Andy."
"So," said Ron when Harry eventually sat down. "Sleeping beauty still in bed?"
excuse me," said Malfoy, low and quiet, "I didn't realise you were such a stickler on ceremony."
"Thank you, Potter," he said, with a prim nod. "Come on, let's actually look for what we came for."
"Maybe one day, then," he said eventually. The cold air felt heavy in his lungs. "But not now. Thanks, Hermione."
"I want you to know," said Draco, following him, "That I am only here because I didn't have a better offer. Which sounded much cooler in my head, and is actually not true. I had several offers, including being smuggled out of the country illegally to celebrate on a moonlit balcony in Paris. Some of my housemates are going to a
Ron and Hermione both went for the hug this time.
"Fair point. I just like making pancakes."
Draco looked at him for a long moment.
"What exactly is a neo-Nazi?" said Harry, frowning. "Like I know Nazis — kind of, I mean Binns was a bit vague about the Muggle bits…"
Draco dragged his teeth along Harry's jaw, and Harry tried to get his mind together enough to say the thought that was pressing at him.
"Good evening, oh betrayer of confidences," said Draco, nose high.
, against the bookcase.
"Parkinson would have done the same, had she the means. She owls me weekly about you, you know."
"Alright, fine, you can have the spot.” Harry shifted; the cold ground was beginning to seep through his jeans. "So?"
He wasn't being actively hostile to Harry anymore, but he appeared to be calculatedly ignoring him most of the time. Harry, unashamedly watching Malfoy in any room he was in, still saw the glances in his direction, the little flash of silver gaze as Malfoy checked to see if his joke had landed, if Harry was still paying attention. It felt like those moments in the Great Hall, where they'd always been pretending not to notice each other, except Harry had never felt the burning urge to push Malfoy into a bean bag and kiss him senseless in the Great Hall.
"I see," said Hermione, looking less embarrassed and more suspicious. "And you didn't
Draco snorted.
"Let me guess – she laughed you out of the room?" said Hermione. Ron patted him consolingly on the shoulder.
Harry walked up the stairs, concentrating on the familiar steps, trying not to think too hard about what he was doing. Malfoy's door was shut; Harry knocked it awkwardly with his left elbow.
"Well, yes, but — " Harry didn't know how to end that sentence. He shrugged.

Then it occurred to him he would have to wash his clothes as well, or at least his robe.
Face-to-face with Draco's cock, pink and bobbing, and he smiled to himself at how the fear left him, how easy it was to lick a long, slow trail up the underside.

"Did you not hear the part about my hair?" protested Draco.
"Ah," said Harry.

, then," he said. "Now if you'd be so kind, you can get the fuck out."
"I'll try not to be too upset," said Harry dryly, and Malfoy smirked.
"You think this is funny, is that it?" he hissed, shaking Harry, "Yet another way to humiliate me, is that it? Haven't you done enough, coming to my hearing and being all
Harry strolled up to the entranceway, racking his brains for what the etiquette was for 'friends of your old rival who have dropped round for tea'. Malfoy and Zabini were there already; Zabini was raising an eyebrow at the corridor in general, and muttered something that made Malfoy laugh.
Too soon after that day, it was Christmas Eve. Ron and Hermione were at the Grangers', having what Hermione had called a Norwegian Christmas, so they could be at the Burrow all day on Christmas Day this year. Seamus and Dean were heading to Ireland — and it was a significant holiday, Harry knew, because it was the first time any of his family would meet Dean properly. Harry hugged them both goodbye at the Floo, and wished he could take away their fear. Neville was already staying with his gran, so only Luna and Ginny remained. They had lunch in the kitchen together, Ginny in bright spirits in her lurid orange Christmas jumper, Luna smiling at them both past her violently flashing earrings.
Draco turned his head away. The music changed to something low and cacophonous, strange stringed instruments weaving through the heavy atmosphere.
"I want to be better," said Harry, thinking of Teddy's bright blue hair.
find it hard. I was overthinking it. When I figured out that it's not really about remembering the words or thinking them really hard, it all just clicked."
Harry's stomach lurched a little.
Harry was glad Hermione was coming to the rescue, but really, was there any need for that?
"Have you no
"I'm so sorry," he said, gruffly, though that was not what he wanted to say. Draco ignored him, still talking.
Malfoy ate each pancake slowly; it seemed to be an effort, and Harry decided Malfoy would need something stronger than tea to get him through the day. He fished the cafetière out of the sink.
"Er, no problem," said Harry awkwardly. "See you later."
"But that means I don't get what I want, either. Hardly seems fair."
"I'm going to use a spell," murmured Draco. "Take off your jeans."
"What's your plan of attack?" said Blaise.
"Nothing," said Harry vehemently, biting down on his tongue. "Nothing at all. Don't worry. I think I'm going to –"

"Okay," she said, very quietly, and Ron looked both happy and astonished that he wasn't in trouble.
"I have panic attacks," he said, and even though he and everyone he knew agreed that was definitely what was happening, Harry still felt stupid telling a medical professional. Like he was lying. "I'm scared of seeing people from the wizarding world. It feels like everyone wants something, like everyone has an opinion, and I just want to hide. Going outside feels impossible sometimes."
Just at that moment, he heard a noise at the door. He twitched the cloak again, then stood up to see who it was. A silvery blond head was just visible in the moonlight.

Then he followed them all up to the drawing room, crossed to the drinks cabinet, and asked if anyone wanted a drink.
Harry led the way upstairs, waving a silent goodbye on the first floor landing.
"It's your name," said Draco, not looking at him. "I've called you Harry before. Positively a mundane occurrence."
"I didn't really know Muggles had places this
, if you can imagine. I suppose these things don't always have to mean the same thing forever."
Harry looked at him, confused. There was utter hatred in his eyes.
"I'm not going to sit here and try to tell you it's wrong," she said. "Yes, he called me a Mudblood and broke your nose and let Fenrir Greyback into Hogwarts, but I honestly don't know if I'd have done anything different if I'd been born in his shoes. Nobody is

"Things turned quickly after I moved in, kind of embarrassing really," continued Malfoy, blank-eyed and oblivious to Harry's shame. "He asked me to earn my keep, which was fair enough, but if I didn't cook or clean to his liking he'd get upset.
He set the basket down on a desk and pulled out the Marauder's Map again. He was delighted to see that Ron and Hermione were in the classroom – he watched their dots join the throng of those exiting the room.
They all went up to the drawing room after dinner. Harry expected Draco to continue to not-really-ignore him for another evening, but Draco was sat down for all of ten minutes before he said:
"Harry. Can I talk to you?"
"I —" he said, searching for the right words to make it not true, but they didn't come. He slumped back into the bench. "Yeah, You're right."
He slipped the third one into his pocket when nobody was looking.
"I'm sure," she said. "That he fancies you is obvious, of course."
be discussing in this den of my enemies," said Draco sternly, but he didn't look genuinely worried. He looked amused, and soft in a way he didn't often look, and Harry suddenly got an acute sense of what it must have been like for Draco, all those dinners in the kitchen and games in the drawing room with references he didn't understand, in-jokes he would never be privy to.
"Such filth," said Seamus approvingly, "I'm a good influence."
There was silence for a moment, as Harry concentrated on excavating forkfuls of spaghetti from his over-full bowl. Malfoy sucked in his pasta shapes one at a time, looking pained.
," Ginny grinned back at her brother.
"You'd be a jaded Auror in a dissatisfying marriage," he said, in the tone of a trailer for a radio play on the WWN. "I'd be a handsome, sexually frustrated divorcé wrestling with my inner demons. We'd try to deny our attraction, but the pull would be too strong. We'd both be sneaking a cigarette in the garden of some dreary gala and the sparks would fly, pun intended."
" said Harry, louder than he intended. He dropped his voice again. "And what about you? Are you just a victim in all this? Don't think I couldn't feel as well, Malfoy –"
"You know," said Hermione. "If you're really feeling the urge to help people, there are better recipients of your care than Malfoy. The soup run is looking for volunteers."
"Hello Neville, would you like a tea?" asked Luna. Neville smiled and joined the cross-legged party by the teapot.
"I have come to apologise," said Harry. "I am a terrible boyfriend, and I don't mind if you hate me for it, and I wish it could be different because I want the best for you. And I know I love you... Like a sister."
"I think not," said Hermione. "Do the memories feel the same?"
"Ooh," Pansy cooed, "Draco, you dear, that's my absolute favourite."
"Nope," said Harry, licking his lips. "So you'll have to tell me if I'm doing it right."
Harry was just about to jump angrily to Malfoy's defence when something passed over Pansy's face.
Except that whenever he looked at Harry, his haunted expression returned, and Harry wasn't sure if he wanted to wipe it away with a hex or a kiss.
"What?" said Malfoy, swinging round to him and nearly dropping the ladle. "Why wouldn't it be?"
Harry stared. Ron shrugged.
"I was talking about
"Perhaps one day," he said, looking down at the soup. "Pass me that cup, Potter, we have another customer."
"Pansy," he replied. "I miss her."
"Fine might be a bit of a stretch," said Ron. "Thought this Malfoy redemption plan was your idea, anyway?"
"That much seems pretty obvious," said Harry. He stuck his hands in his pockets. "But sorry, I'm not sure I can reciprocate."
"You're one to talk," said Draco. "And I don't see what's so funny."
The next day, the kitchen sink had a sullen air about it, the drain leaking water all over the cleaning supplies, the tap refusing to run for the washing up. Harry didn't really know how you apologised to a house for being sick on it, but so far manual labour seemed to have worked, and so on Monday afternoon Harry dragged the rusty toolbox down to the kitchen and began to prod optimistically at the pipework. Ron, aware that he was responsible for the sink's sulky behaviour but having very little to contribute in the way of practical knowledge, sat at the kitchen table accepting snacks from Kreacher and occasionally making unhelpful observations about Harry's plumbing skills.
He thought he might just have to risk it. If he left now, he'd be able to go down to the kitchens for a snack before mid-morning lessons. Not that he knew what they even were – he'd have to hope he bumped into Ron and Hermione.
"Looks good," murmured Harry, and Malfoy actually beamed for a moment, before he caught himself.
Luna had given them their first cake for free, but Harry put down more cash than he needed to and told her to keep the change. She accepted it with a peck on the cheek. Malfoy froze like a startled deer when she turned to him and kissed his cheek too; Harry repressed a laugh at the sight of his face.
"Oh good, it's you," said Malfoy, scowling at him. Harry glared back.
Harry felt like he could almost
returning Neville's fond smile, and poured himself another coffee from the pot.
Harry carefully ladled bolognese sauce into a serving dish in order to avoid serving them too many black bits. He was just levitating the pasta into the centre of the table when Malfoy appeared in the doorway.
"Don't think this changes anything, Potter," he growled, and Harry was confused and angry, too shocked to fight back. "Don't think I'm going to roll over in gratitude, just because you deigned to give us your noble Gryffindor attention. Or do you just like to have people in your debt?"
"I thought you wanted the insults?"
, as her bright orange harem pants were grass-stained, and she was wearing a strange pair of brass goggles on her head.
"Maybe," said Seamus, suddenly serious.
"Daphne never thought too much of me," said Draco, averting his gaze.
Hermione looked at the shop in question and pulled a face.
"It's fine, really, just tell Dean your numbers," said Harry. "Please, it'd make me happy."
Malfoy stared. Harry smirked, and licked the tail end of the scar where it trailed off just below his navel. Draco's eyelids lowered.
Embarrassed, Harry yanked himself up and out of the door, bashing his elbow on the doorframe in his haste. Hermione shut the door behind him, and Harry dashed down the attic stairs in a fluster, as though he'd been caught doing something bad. He got as far as the last step before his discomfort faded enough to let his curiosity in.
Every bone in Harry's body screamed at him to fight. To shout, to not let Malfoy leave, to beg him to take it back, to beg for forgiveness, whatever it took.
"No," he said, grinning. "Have you?"
Draco fisted a hand in his hair and kissed him viciously.
"If he goes, I go," said Harry stonily, and followed suit.
"Well, George has got a muggle telly in his flat," said Ron. "And we were watching it and this brilliant advert came on where the guy sprayed this special stuff on himself and it made girls throw themselves at him, and George told me he'd get me some if I gave him twenty galleons. And the best thing is, it's muggle so it's not prohibited!"
to watch him eat.
about how much I suck?" he said. "My god, that is so unbelievably petty."
"Oh, I have a girl," said Jack. "In Ravenclaw. You all know what they say about Ravenclaw girls..."
Malfoy gestured down a road. They walked in silence for a while longer, Harry staring at the pale grey sky, the trees, the cars; anything but Malfoy.

"Hi, John," said Hermione. She strode forward, holding out her hand to the friendly looking older man. "Got another willing victim."
"Oh, yeah," said Harry, wincing. "We are so in trouble."
Ginny was fuming as he left without saying goodbye, but Harry didn't notice.

better Death Eater than Draco.
"What am I going to do?" said Malfoy. "Follow him around insulting his innuendo skills until he kicks me out?"
"Oh," said Harry, glancing at the darkness beyond the window. "Actually, I think I said I'd cook tonight. I best get back."
But that just meant he could always work it back to being my fault. That I was nagging, that I didn't support him enough, that I didn't understand… then he got nastier, telling me I had no right to criticise him when I was such a brat, when I'd had everything handed to me and still fucked it up, and I… I just gave in. He wasn't
The man winked at him, tilting his head to the van.
"No, it's not," said Hermione, repressing a grin. "It's very serious and very illegal and it could have dire consequences. I can't imagine what your brother was thinking."
When the doorbell rang a week later, Harry nearly fell off his perch on the kitchen counter, saving his tea through quick reflexes alone.
"Excuse me," he said, painfully posh, "I don't suppose you know the closest place to get tea and cake?"
"Something like that," Harry agreed. "And yeah, he is from serious money. I thought he'd left the country, but I guess not."
Harry snorted, but he slid between Draco's legs again, one hand on the side of Draco's head as he slicked up his cock with the other. Draco's smirk fell away.
"Ron?" she said loudly. "I've left Harry's homework. I'm just going to fetch it."
"Don't you dare," he growled, and made a dive for it. Malfoy was too fast; he jumped back, holding the cape behind him and smirking wickedly.
Harry's body went cold. He could hear a roaring in his ears.
Harry shook his head. "You don't think that's true?"

At the door to Harry's room, Harry was hit with the enormity of the invitation.
"But with one hell of a hangover," added Dean, giving Seamus a disapproving look. "But

John cleared his throat.
"For heaven's sake," said Ron, bashing his head on the window as he stuck his head out. "What on earth — oh, alright Harry?" his face broke into a slow grin, taking in his and Draco's entwined hands. "Watching the sunrise, are you? God, it's going to be gross with you two, I can tell. And after me and Hermione have been so polite and respectful as well. Well just you wait, Harry, there's going to be public displays of affection all over the shop now, don't you doubt it. I

of course."
A box of dusty toys. A stash of surprisingly varied dirty magazines under a weak Notice-Me-Not. A wardrobe, still full of Hogwarts uniforms and Slytherin scarves, ugly dress robes and awful flared jeans. Harry found old, childish drawings of Regulus and his big brother stashed in a box at the back, along with a wooden crate full of vinyl records and a record player. Both of them had THIS BELONGS TO SIRIUS - HANDS OFF gouged into them by Scorching Spell.
He was still at the kitchen table, on his third cup of tea, when Ron and Hermione emerged from the Floo, carrying several bags of shopping.
"Yes. Talk," he agreed.
It was two weeks after the Final Battle that Harry saw Malfoy again. He was stood with his mother at his father's hearing, pale and pinched, Narcissa's painted nails tight on his shoulder. Harry expected to feel more passion, more hate, but all he felt was sad. He testified, surprising himself and much of the room with his semi-sympathetic speech. Lucius Malfoy, in the end, had suffered more under Voldemort than the Wizengamot could ever inflict.
"I'll come down with you," he muttered, casting a guilty glance at the drawing room door.
. It'll be fine."
"Ahem," said Slughorn pointedly, and their voices dropped back to whispers.
It wasn't the pain that worried him, or the design, or even the permanence. It was more the fact he had absolutely no idea how tattoos even worked. He knew it was a needle, but in his head, he'd imagined some kind of sewing needle, not a metal thing that buzzed like an angry hive. He didn't know how long they took, he didn't know how
"He told you to say that? Wow, Slytherins really are evil."
"Take it you did a lot of thinking, then?" said Hermione, as Harry sat down in the common room with a flop.
"You guys seem too young to be clinging to vinyl. You know CDs are the future, right?"
He left the letter on the coffee table for a week — a guilty, sickening week he spent in self-punishing labour in the most disgusting bathroom in the house. He had finally had his fill of mouldy grout by Sunday afternoon and had just dragged himself into the kitchen to convince himself to Floo call when the fire roared to life.
He looked at the stubborn fire in Malfoy's eyes, and could think of nothing else he could say.
. Just stupid feelings, flaring up out of nowhere and making him think weird things.
"Wow," said Harry. "Lifesaver."
"And socks and pants," added Hermione, pointing to the hole in Harry's current pair of socks.
"And Colin," said Harry, then winced.
to be," said Luna, who didn't look surprised either. Harry was vaguely offended — he wasn't sure why everyone had leapt to Malfoy quite so quickly. It could have been any old down-and-out ex-Death-Eater…
"Not entirely, Seamus, but I do now, so that's alright," said Ginny, looking defiant and uncharacteristically uncomfortable.
"Good. At the end of this session, we'll discuss whether you'd like to embark upon treatment with me and sign the contract. For now, we'll focus on the practical questions — what you'd like to achieve, what I can provide, realistic treatment lengths and approaches, that sort of thing. Does that sound reasonable to you?"
"Do you think we should do something?" said Harry.
"Oh, hi Jan!"
"So did you," said Harry, throat tight, voice cracking. "And none of us should have had to. We should have had a
"It's for the best," said Dean, reaching over the arm of the chair to clap him on the shoulder. "It doesn't mean the end."
Malfoy's eyes swept over the room, taking in the embroidered curtains, the bean bags and blankets, the Pamphlets, and the Black family tapestry still dominating the walls. Then he looked back at Harry, a little blank.
"Are you trying to drag me into a threesome?" quipped Draco, looking like he wasn't sure if he were being teased. "Because I think it should be clear by now that I'm absolutely the
Harry shut down his brain on that thought.
"Now," said John, gesturing broadly. "You can expect a bit of hazing from the regulars, try to take it in your stride." He turned to the van, edging between Hermione and one of the ladies, and tugged a large box of clothes out from behind the soup station. "And if you hate it, we can always have you back at the church doing the cooking. Here you go."
Malfoy pulled his knees up sharply to his chest at that. Harry stared at him, spine crawling with a feeling he knew but could not entirely name. An old feeling, one that made him think of dark cupboards and spiders.
Ginny pulled a face. The happiness drained visibly from Draco's expression.
"Posh twat," countered Harry.
He stopped, suddenly, about two feet from Harry. Took a deep breath.
"Oh," said Malfoy. "Kind of… clearer. Less indescribably awful."
Harry could see Hermione's eyes glazing as Ron spoke.
, not smirking any more, and the hot, hard feel of him sent a pulse of –
"Yeah," said Harry, and sank down to sit cross-legged on the gritty pavement, offering him the coffee. Malfoy took it without a thank you, and swigged it despite the scalding temperature.
"Shame," said the boy, kicking the box. "Fucking 'ell, not even John would wear a cardigan that colour. That's an insult, that is."
"Thank you, Harry, for your hospitality. And for taking care of my friend."
"She's her own," Ron corrected, sternly but still with that wry smile, and Hermione's face went all soft and shy, and then it was
"How was I supposed to
The flagstone path ended in a miniature orchard at the foot of the garden, forming a circle amongst the trees. The back wall behind the trees was a dark, mossy stone; at the right time of day, you could almost pretend the garden went on forever.

haven't found a reserve Seeker?" said Ginny brightly, cutting through the tension in her usual manner.
"Ask her yourself, Harry. You do know she's just worried about you, right?"
"No Howlers?"
Harry held up the Basement Jaxx album. Malfoy's eyebrows raised.
"You can know some of them now," said Harry. "That's Andromeda. She's caring for my godson. I see her sometimes."
"Well, yeah," said Ron. "But at least she's not Malfoy-awful."
"You do know you can leave any time?"
Hermione's face travelled through mildly offended and settled into amused.
"Draco Malfoy, at the soup run."
"Me too," said Ginny. "But it does make it easier to tell people what you're feeling when you have a word, you know?"
Draco smirked. "It might sound odd, but yes. The people I'm with are all absolutely wild, full of interesting ideas about the world, there's never a dull moment. None of them use their real names and they assume I don't either, and they all do things like go to protests and graffiti the houses of parliament. All very exciting."
Draco Malfoy, huddled deep within a parka and a sleeping bag, blinked up at him.
"Not like I do now, Deany-boy, I have
"Yes," he said. "Yes, of course you can."
"We got a new party game," called Seamus, gesturing with the lid of the box. "Come in and play!"
Harry took Teddy out to see Father Christmas in the local grotto, and the actor made a great fuss of Teddy's blue hair, which thankfully didn't change colour under the attention. On the way back Teddy pressed his face against every window display or bus stop billboard that featured a depiction of Santa, much to Andromeda's despair.
. Harry was bordering on outraged at this point.
"And you fit right in," said Harry, patting him on the back. "Come on, you git, before I change my mind about the tea."
"Ah," said Jack, glaring at Ritchie's still-open mouth. "Well, she was pretty hot. And Ginny's a, a beautiful young woman."
Malfoy's hand, cold and shaking, wrapped around Harry's and lifted it, pressing Harry's palm into his own chest. Harry's skin found the necklace, felt the cool rush of the Calming Charm break over him, focusing on the feeling of the glass under his fingers. It wasn't enough to stop his laboured breathing, but then Malfoy was there in front of him, crossing his legs on the pavement in front of Harry, cutting into the flow of foot traffic like a rock in a river. Harry heaved another breath.
"We will make you a feast!" said Kreacher, and the other elves nodded enthusiastically.
Harry grinned. He carefully did not mention that technically, this was not his only property, although it
Ron coughed significantly and looked murderous. Harry thought he ought to shut his mouth.

"I think you've done quite enough," said Andromeda, looking down her nose at him. "That said, I'd be delighted to see you next week, if you'd like. We were thinking of visiting the toy museum on Wednesday."
"Thank you, Weasley," he said, "Although I'm still not convinced it isn't a prank. I notice nobody else's clothes are see-through."
Harry stared at it, at the way the shading made the petals look almost translucent, at how the curve of it seemed to fit perfectly along his forearm. He touched his leather jacket; for a moment, he could imagine Sirius there, grinning and telling him it was cool.

natural reserve tended to drop after a strong spritzer.
"What?"
"Only another eighteen hours, Harry. It'll be over in no time. I'll go tell McGonagall. And I'll be sure to bring your homework!"
"If you say so, oh Saviour of the Wizarding World."
"But Harry–" protested Ron. Harry ignored him and all but ran downstairs. He met Hermione half way down.
"It is an
without a spell for removing come from things?" he said.
"I didn't know it was enchanted," said Harry, irritated. "You really thought I'd done it deliberately? What does this potion do exactly?"
He made it as far as the third floor without meeting anyone. It was very strange, to see a fifth-year Ravenclaw sniffing the air and making random leaps; Harry took pity on her, and blocked her nose.
They had a kind of accidental second party that night. Ginny poured everyone what she claimed to be Hair of the Dog but was really just a stiff vodka and orange, and Harry proceeded to get the dopey, messy drunk of someone who was not yet fully recovered from the previous session. He found himself lying with his legs over Ron and his head on Hermione's lap, watching Luna dance ridiculously with Ginny while the piano played a shaky tune to itself. He was warm, so warm, with Ron's hand on his ankle and Hermione gently stroking his hair. He wondered if this was what being a cat would be like — no cares, no thoughts, just the comfort of his friends.
"I've known for a while that you want to hate me, but surely you don't still…"
Harry exhaled sharply, picking at the threads of the embroidery bee on his cushion. He looked at Ron, resentful of the tense atmosphere that now stretched between them. Ron gave him a long look in return.
Malfoy took the bag, eyes wide. Then, abruptly, he bent forward and yanked at his current t-shirt. For a brief moment, Malfoy's face was covered by the shirt, and Harry could openly stare at the white skin over Malfoy's hip bones, the fine blond hair trailing down, the muscles outlined so clearly on his slim chest and the silvery scar across his sternum
boy, and how you think maybe we should give it a go, and how everything is going to be fine as long as I fall in line? Guess what, it's not fine. Nothing's fine! My father's going to die in prison and my mother doesn't have money to
They were listening to Pink Floyd, still in silence, when Kreacher brought them tea, his beady eyes taking in their states of undress and the tone of the music and surreptitiously adding chocolate biscuits. They both sat cross-legged on the floor beside the coffee table to eat them, Harry caught between avoiding Malfoy's confused, faintly suspicious eye, and trying to watch him eat.
"Right," said Fish, grinning and slipping the notes into his pocket. "I know where he's probably sleeping, mostly cos I told him it's a good spot. I've passed out there many a time when I was in a pinch. He might have gone somewhere else, depends how full the hostels are and if he'd rather chance it outside, but the weather's pretty good so I reckon he'll be there. It's a little alley not far from here on Guild Street, in between an old greengrocer and a greasy spoon."
the Pamphlets?" said Malfoy, inspecting the runes with interest. "She's actually mad. This is a madhouse."
"Hi Fish," said Harry, giving him a nod.
"I wish she wouldn't," said Harry, slumping onto his usual chair. "I do go outside. I go to Tesco, and the Burrow, and the pub."
"I don't have hard feelings. I would have sold her out too if I thought it'd win the war." Harry slung an arm wide over the arm of the chair in the appearance of nonchalance.
the idea. He liked the idea of Malfoy fancying him. Even though Malfoy had been dismissive, as though his assessment were merely factual, Harry
"If by interesting you mean training to be an Auror, I suppose so." Ron shrugged to cover his pride, and Hermione went back to bristling.
"They background check you, you can't have close ties to Death Eaters."
"Panic attacks are a very unpleasant thing to live with," said Adhikari after a moment, when Harry didn't move to fill the silence. "The good news is, I have some excellent treatment options for both panic attacks and phobias. And you're here in my office despite what must be an overwhelming fear of doing so, so you're obviously ready for treatment. I'm confident we can make good progress over the next few months."
"It's a lot," agreed Harry, sliding down to the spot next to him. "I can't imagine what it's like sober. Well, I can, given that I haven't had one since you turned up."
"Not really," said Harry.
Kreacher left him to do the lunchtime dishes, and five minutes later, the front door swung open and Malfoy walked in. He was actually

"In a manner of speaking." Ginny’s eyes flicked to Luna
Harry didn't think of Malfoy as a fellow weirdo, but he was increasingly unsure of this assessment.
A rare silence fell as everyone dug into the food, and Harry took up his customary habit of giving Draco a stealthy glance every few minutes only to find that Draco was already looking at him. Draco would stare at him for a long moment, as though Harry were a mysterious apparition, then his gaze would slide away, and Harry would glance at Hermione, and then sharply down at his dinner. Then he'd vow not to look at him again, until Draco made a quip or moved too fast in the corner of his eye, and the whole thing would repeat.
Ellie looked at his birth date for a long time, and Harry felt a rush of disappointment again. He didn't have any ID, but Ellie obviously deemed him of age, because she waved him back behind the screen. The shop beyond was narrow but well-lit, and his tattoo artist perched on a rolling chair beside a bench like the kind he remembered from the doctors as a child. Behind her, on another bench, a large man was gritting his teeth as an even larger man used a strange, buzzing machine on him. Everything smelled faintly of disinfectant. Harry caught the large man's eye and had his first moment of personal misgiving.
The week before his birthday, the bright summer weather broke into a deluge of thunderous rain. The house felt hot and close, the outside unusually dark, occasionally illuminated by the bright, harsh flash of lightning.
"Are you sure?"
bisexual."
"You need to fuck me now," he said, and Harry's whole body lit with fire.
Hermione arrived, wrapped in a fluffy dressing gown and holding a vial.
"Eight o'clock," he said. "Everyone ready? Alright then, let the soup flow!"
"I'll get that," he said, smoothing his long hair back and attempting to look casual. Seamus and Ginny gave each other amused, significant looks.
"You're mad, Luna Lovegood," said Malfoy, resisting her pulling hands, but he seemed a bit giddy with relief that she'd pulled him into the room, and then Ginny joined them, waving her hands above her head and barging Malfoy with her hip. Malfoy did it back to her, and then he was letting Luna drag him into her spinning dance, tapping his foot as she looped under his arm and it wasn't
Harry snorted.
Malfoy didn't seem to be up to anything. Since the war he'd been staying at Hogwarts, along with anyone else who didn't really know where to go. McGonagall had been persuaded to give him some protection; an awful lot of people wanted him to be arrested like his father. Harry thought Malfoy was alright – he'd pretended not to know them at the Manor, and his mother had saved the Wizarding World – but he didn't exactly

, Potter, my father would be turning in his grave if he'd just hurry up and get in already, but this makes sense to me and it makes me feel better so just take it and put me out of my misery, would you?"
Ginny looked up at her, smiling. From anyone else, Ginny would have taken that as an attack, but it was impossible to take a question from Luna as anything but earnest.
Ginny's tension broke into a giggle.
"Wonder if he's got an apology for everyone?" said Ginny, an evil glint in her eye.
"They're at work, mostly," said Harry. "Gin's probably at the Quidditch pitch, I don't know. Dean works shifts at Flourish and Blotts. Luna works in a Muggle shop selling crystals or something, when she's not writing for the

"Can't be," said Harry. "Last I heard Narcissa Malfoy had taken what was left of the Malfoy estate and upped sticks to France. Andromeda got a letter from them."
"Everyone's very surprised, but this is the only thing that I've done so far that matches my original life plan," she said, when Harry asked. "Mum and dad always recommended a gap year. To find yourself, you know?"
"Yes, well, there are many kinds of hell.” Malfoy’s voice was taut.
"Then what?" said Malfoy, through his laughter. "You can't keep it up for your little Weasley –
Harry dropped his cup of coffee into his lap in surprise.
Pushing the thought out of his head, he put on his leather jacket, cast a Warming Charm over his hands, and headed outside.
"Well, that's great. Everyone seems to be having a good day," he said brightly. "Romantically speaking. Good luck, and all that."
"I think that one violent snog in the middle of the corridor was hotter than a dozen fumbles with Ginny," he confessed.
"No! Well, I might have —
"Alright then, what did you want to talk to me about?"
"They should hire you," said Draco. "I'm not joking, Weasley, I'm pretty sure the only reason someone hasn't picked you up is that they haven't spotted you yet."
"You should invite her over."
you're Muggle-born," said Harry, grinning to cover his discomfort. "Maybe you're related to a Shafiq."
"Labouring," said Malfoy, looking up from his book to stare at it, as though it were some sort of cypher.
"How do you feel now?" she asked.
"Just a quick look," agreed Ron quietly, glancing guiltily at Hermione.
Harry stared at him, his anger warring with his better judgement. Why was Malfoy being like this? He was just concerned. And he'd thought Draco — he'd thought there might be something there in return —
. It doesn't feel
"Lorcan D'Eath is alright."
Andromeda levitated a tea service down onto the coffee table and folded herself comfortably into the armchair opposite Harry, smiling as she looked between them.
He didn't know how he got down to the first floor, and he didn't really register knocking on Ron and Hermione's door until Hermione peered out at him, in a hair wrap and pink pyjamas. She took one look at him and slung the door wide.
"Come on," he said, following Malfoy's path through the now-open door into Ron and Hermione's dressing room. It was clear neither of them were actually using the room for dressing; the wardrobe was partially blocked by a weight rack in one corner, and in the other corner was an ornate mahogany desk carrying, incongruously, a PC, a monitor, and something that looked very much like a sort of cobbled-together industrial printer, encompassed by a set of runes all written on Post-its.
"Not sure," said Harry. "Maybe heroin?"
"I thought you did Mondays," said Draco, and this tone was easier to read — petulant. "Hermione said you did Mondays."
to hate her…
"Friends?"
They wandered down the road at a snail's pace, shoulder to shoulder, both of them vibrating with tense enthusiasm. Malfoy poked at every strange Muggle object he could reach.

"It's all very sad," said Luna, and curled up beside Ginny like a cat. "Ron, you're next, if you're willing."
"What is it?" he said, although even in his lust-addled state he had a suspicion. Draco Summoned his wand from his jeans and touched his forearm. Under the glamour bloomed a cacophony of brightly coloured flowers, roses and lilies and Narcissus in an arcing path. Harry leaned in to see the details, conveniently pressing his crotch to the groove of Draco's hip as he did so; Draco hissed.

A girl in an animal hat nearly bumped into them; Harry dodged her and caught Malfoy's arm again.
"Alright?" said Hermione, coming up on his other side. She looked bright-eyed and happy, like a night of talking to an endless stream of people had somehow been a pleasure for her. "Might as well head home now. Do you want to walk back? Or there's a quiet spot back there where we can use our

"Oh, what a joy it is to see you here with me in my finest hour," Malfoy croaked.

Luna let go of him gently, floating forward towards Ginny. Hermione spotted him and made a beeline to fill Luna's position, her movements somewhat hampered by her spectacular gold dress.
a happy Draco, not like Pansy did. Harry didn't really know how Draco was doing at all. His stomach twisted.
"She must have been pretty vicious," said Ron, sniggering. "God, your face when you got into the common room!"<
"I don't see why that should excuse him from having
"Oooh!" Ginny sat up, causing Luna's head to drop sharply as the equilibrium of the beanbag was disrupted. "Are those clothes?"
Harry wished he could be that smooth, that he could pull off a smirk that unashamedly wicked.
Malfoy took up a position laying on the sofa with his back to the door. Harry could only see his feet, bare and pale, propped up on the bee cushion.
"Watch the face, Draco, honestly," said Pansy, but it was soft now, and one hand came up to stroke his hair. They stayed like that for a long time.
"Yes," said Harry, and it came out lower and rougher than intended. Malfoy's eyes flicked briefly to his mouth.
"Caught me at the kettle, Harry, you know I can never say no to him."

"Pumpkin juice. Are we eleven again?"
Harry broke himself out of his trance to look at Neville and Luna, sitting comfortably together on the sofa and smiling at the scene, then Ron and Hermione, who were both pulling the face they pulled when they were expecting Harry to be weird about something.
"Yeah, right," he said, and groaned.
"And something better to go to the pub in than your only dress shirt," said Ginny.
"Yeah. Nasty piece of work, Jenny didn't really like serving him but you don't start with a guy like Spider. He took a shine to Draco straight away, took him under his wing sorta thing. Spider can be charming when he wants to, and he's got this way about him, you know? Fancies himself a

He wondered if Sirius knew about Camden. He lived so close, he must have known. He wondered if he ever showed his dad.
"Oi, Potter," said Ron, jumping on his bed and waking him with a start. "You're safe now, I reckon. How does it feel not to drive women crazy with your scent?"
Christmas at the Burrow was loud and busy and a little too much, and Harry found himself resisting the urge to clutch the necklace. They all laughed a little too long, covering up the gap Fred left, and then when Ron and Hermione got up to leave the atmosphere was tense — Ron's face pinched, Hermione looking torn between guilt and frustration. Harry drank to numb himself to the noise and went to sit on the step outside, watching the fairy lights dance over the frosty grass.
Harry glanced at Luna, thinking about
"I hate you in so many ways," said Malfoy, squaring his shoulders and curling his lip. "I hate that you're so fucking
"Afternoon," said Harry dryly. Malfoy scowled, and they both stood there frozen for a moment, before Malfoy jerked forward and pushed past him towards the kitchen.
"Extremely handsome, eh?" said Dean.
Ron scoffed.
say they were, er, fuck buddies, but I don't think that's true."
"You're not going to get away with it, whatever it is. You're going to fail, and your new master is going to punish you, and you're going to realise what an idiot you've been."
"I'd be delighted to visit, of course," he said. "You know I adore Paris in the summer."
"Call me whatever you like," he said, and it was obvious that Draco had intended for it to come out smooth and dismissive, but it didn't. It came out too fast, with too much air in it, breathy and quiet. His eyes widened, flicked to Harry's mouth, and they were much closer than they should be for a casual chat. Harry burned with the urge to just do it, to throw away all the reasons why it would be absolutely stupid and just kiss him, right here in the kitchen with Kreacher still fretting in the corner.
"You're being very good about it," he said.
"Right," said Draco. "Of course."
"Oh, of course you don't," he quipped. "I could have sworn I read a
"And just so you know, I personally won't hesitate to shop him to the Ministry if he steps one toe out of line," said Seamus.
"Without me asking her to be," insisted Harry impatiently. "Don't you ever wonder if she's just deflecting?"
Harry nodded, scrubbing at his face with a tissue. Typical, they were just supposed to be talking about practicalities, and he was already crying…
Draco contemplated ways to convince Harry as he showered and dressed for the day, and was still musing when he entered the sitting room.
“Do not be afraid, child,” the woman said, her voice even more musical than the bells, “I mean you no harm. I was called here by your distress. Tell me, why are you alone in the woods on Christmas Eve?”
“How did things go with the Potter’s, Alastor?” Dumbledore inquired.
Why burning supper is enough to bring me to tears
"In the future," Draco whispered when he pulled away, "Don't interfere when I am trying to protect you; also, you owe me."
As they entered the room, Narcissa made her announcement-adding that paying too much attention to Harry-now-called-Hadrian would earn them animosity from her Veela son and that he would likely attack first and ask questions later. With the explanation-and warnings-given the boys once again mingled among the guests, but this time Draco kept his arm firmly around his Mate. Arden was also by the boy's side; the little dragon had turned down Draco's offer to pick him up and instead walked in front of the boy's as they traversed the ballroom, sitting down directly in front of them whenever they stopped.
There was a brief fade out, and then Harry and Draco were back in the Great Hall, where the members of the 'Black Rose' had all been subdued; the Potter's, Severus, Remus and Regulus were awake by this time, and all were glaring at Dumbledore.
"Hi Harry, umm…Malfoy; thank you for inviting us," Neville greeted Hadrian cheerfully, glancing nervously at Draco.
“Actually, there may still be hope for him,” Narcissa said, “Lucius told me that one of Dumbledore’s memories showed him casting a spell just as Sirius fell; Lucius believes-and Severus agrees-that it is likely Sirius was banished somewhere and is still alive. I think that they may even have an idea of where he is being kept, but they have not shared that information with me.”
"Come on Dray," Hadrian said, "We need to get up." Draco grumbled incoherently and rolled over, trapping Hadrian beneath him. "Draco! Don't worry Tillie;" Hadrian told the house elf, "I'll wake him up; how long do we have until the guests arrive?"
"Who did this?" Tom demanded in a low, dangerous voice; he got up from the chair he had been sitting in and walked around to the other side of the desk so that he could more clearly see the bruises on Hadrian's face.
"That's bullshit!" Ron yelled, taking a menacing step towards Draco, who had wisely decided to stay out of the argument, "He's a no-good lying piece of shit snake! How can you trust him! How can you choose him over me? After everything I've done for you Harry; everything I've had to put up with!"
“Well, for starters because I thought you had actually regained your sanity,” Lucius drawled, “Obviously I was mistaken, and I shall have to speak to Severus about improving your potion. Now, where were you headed, Tom? Do you have an idea of where Hadrian might be?”
"Very well," Lucius led them into the dining room, pausing to pull Narcissa's seat out for her, "It was the first Hogsmeade weekend of the year, and…"
“I have asked the house elves to set up tea in the garden,” Narcissa replied, “Once we sit down I will be happy to explain everything, as well as provide you with proof to back up my words.” She turned her attention to the four teenage guests and smiled, “It is good to see you again, Blaise and Theodore. Luna and Neville-please be welcome in my home.”
“Tell me about when you met him at Hogwarts,” Malfoy demanded, “There were rumors in First Year, but I never knew the truth of the matter.”
"Oh, that was hilarious Hades," Draco gasped out, "Just...hilarious!" Hadrian pouted as he waited for his friend to calm down.
"Calm down," Draco said soothingly, moving his arm down so that he could rub circles on the brunets back, "Just calm down and breathe. We can-"
See you soon!
“Pettigrew,” the man spat the name, “We switched at the last moment, didn’t even tell Dumbledore. I thought it would be safer, no one would ever suspect Pettigrew of being the Secret Keeper…”
“Excuse me!” Harry called, and the witch stiffened, “Good morning! I was just wondering-” The witch turned to face him, brown eyes narrowed and arms crossed, and Harry blinked in confusion. “Parkinson? Er-this is your shop?”
"Ron," Hermione began, sounding tense, "I don't think-"
“Draco,” Hadrian moaned, “So-so close!” He tightened his grip in the silver locks and pulled Draco back up for another kiss, willingly allowing the blond to devour his mouth as their bodies pressed together more urgently.
"Fine," Hadrian pouted, as he got to his feet, "But it's still not fair. I should have gone to Neville; he wouldn’t keep secrets from me."
“Professor!” Harry cried, running towards the headmaster, then stopping suddenly and looking down as if embarrassed; “What are you doing here? What’s going on? How did I get in the woods earlier?”
Harry Potter sat in the chair across from him in Malfoy Manor’s Sunroom, staring at Draco in quiet astonishment. Understanding that his revelation had come as a large shock to Harry, Draco gave the other man a moment to process; he used that time to admire the man sitting across from him.
“I’ll stay away from her until you feel comfortable,” Hadrian agreed, “You said she is your friend, and I don’t want that to change just because of me.”
"Okay," Hadrian shrugged and began reading;
"Cissy! Where are you Sister?" Hadrian was interrupted by Bellatrix's appearance in the family parlor, "Well, if it isn't my nephew; itty bitty Drakey all grown up. Don't you have a kiss for your Aunty Bella?"
“Well, that was promising,” Astoria said wryly, sitting down on one of the chairs and picking up the glass of champagne waiting for her, “I can tell your parents are as eager as mine are for us to wed, but is it for the same reason?” Draco looked at Astoria with a little more interest, taking in her pale hair-a blonde only a shade or two darker than his own-and green eyes, which were narrowed as she observed him.
"That's a wonderful idea," Dumbledore beamed, "We already have a department in place to look after pureblood children and it is about time one was created to look after half-bloods and Muggleborns as well. What about improving relations between our two societies? If Muggles understood us better-"
"Then they die," Draco replied, "the same goes for anyone who tries what the Weasel did today as well; his days are already numbered."
"You covered my mouth," Hadrian replied, "I didn't like it." He tilted his head back to scowl at the blond, receiving a glare in return.
"Are…are you really my father?" Harry whispered, and received a nod, “and…my mother?”
“Okay, just follow my lead,” Draco said, “I’ll guide you, all you have to do is keep your eyes on my face and trust me.” Harry felt ridiculous being in such a position with his former rival, but at the same time he found that he enjoyed the closeness.
"Umm, sure," Hadrian said, feeling dazed, "I guess I can't really avoid him since I'm living here for now. But, um…can we not mention what we just discussed? I-I don't think I'm ready for anyone else to know yet; I need time to think about it."
It was mid-morning now, and Harry had several hours before he needed to meet with Draco. Thankfully, he had a lot to keep him busy; his first objective was to get some clothes, since none of his belongings had been returned as of yet. Dumbledore was reluctant to allow Harry to got to Hogsmeade, but eventually agreed to let him go if Hagrid went with him. Hagrid was happy to agree, and they were instructed to be back on school grounds before supper.
“I was mad with grief,” the man explained, “and then I was in Azkaban. I didn’t have any hope-until I saw this.” Lucius tightened his grip on his wand as the man reached into his pocket and pulled out a newspaper clipping. He pointed at something in the picture. “We were animagi; Pettigrew was a rat.”
After sending letters off to their allies, Narcissa made her way to Lucius’ study, where she found her husband and Tom casting a flurry of spells. After a moment of observation, she realized that the spells were all variations of tracking spells, and spells to identify a magical signature.
"That is out of the question," Draco had been prepared to offer an angry reply, but his mother's cold voice stopped him, and he turned back to comforting Hadrian, secure in the knowledge that his mother would handle everything.
Needing a new wand, and not wanting to chance Ollivander’s as the man had been held prisoner in the manor during the war, Draco decided to try the new shop he had heard about, called Custom Wands and Magical Foci. When he entered the shop, he was surprised to find that Harry Potter was the owner- and that the brunet crafted all the wands himself. Draco had almost turned to leave, thinking that he would be better off getting a wand in France or Germany, but Harry had called him back, promising to be professional. Draco decided to take a chance and let Harry craft a custom wand for him. His ex-rival offered more wand core options than could be found at Ollivander’s, and Draco found out that a lot of the wand cores were gifts from Luna and her boyfriend Rolf Scamander. Harry owned a grove of wand wood trees, which he had found on one of the properties he inherited from his paternal great-grandmother’s family, the Fleamonts. Harry had hired Longbottom to help care for the trees, and he made additional money by occasionally allowing other wand makers to harvest magical wood from his grove.
"Yeah, it's not that we don't trust you Har-er, Hadrian," Fred agreed, "but you had the advantage of actually seeing the memories-we haven't."
“But the best healers of our age do not have access to Salazar Slytherins’ personal journals,” Narcissa replied with a sly smile, “We do. Tom, Lucius and Severus are working on translating them right now; in his writing Slytherin suggests that he did develop a way to heal mind damage caused by being subjected to the Cruciatus. Of course, it will take some time for them to translate the mixture of Parseltongue, Arithmancy and Runes that the book was written in.”
“Well, Santa, it’s Jack Frost again,” Bernard said, “He has decided that he wants his own holiday, and he has caused a riot at the workshop. Curtis and I tried to stop him, but…well, Curtis is now frozen. I barely escaped.”
them to mistreat him-and with Harry's own money! Twenty-five hundred pounds was a lot of money; it translated to...500 Galleons a month; 6000 a year! Not only that, but he was doubling their pay so that the Dursley's would beat him, and he had given them potions to prevent Harry from fighting back! The last thought is what made him blanche; the thought of a professor giving someone potions to drug a student was...well, it was repulsive and Harry knew he needed to leave before his aunt and uncle had a chance to use any of the potions on him. Before he got a chance to do anything, however, the cupboard door was slammed open and Vernon Dursley reached in to grab him with one meaty hand.
It was after sunset on the Winter Solstice; Harry and Draco had their wedding-or, more accurately, their bonding ceremony-earlier that morning. After celebrating with family and friends, the two had climbed into the waiting sleigh-it was just big enough for two people, and light enough that it could be pulled by one reindeer-and Crispin had taken flight.
“What, exactly, do you find to be so ridiculous about me being Santa Clause?” Draco demanded.
After a few minutes, Harry finally calmed down and pulled away. He tilted his head back to look at Draco, and then suddenly Harry was leaning forward and kissing him. Draco didn’t move, not to kiss back, not to push him away-and Harry suddenly realized he was kissing his best friend; with a sudden panic, he pulled back and turned to run, but Draco caught his arm and pulled him back in for another kiss. This time, Harry felt Draco’s lips move against his own, and long fingers, carded through his wet hair, relaxing and exciting him at the same time.
"Yes, I suppose they deserve to know," the Dark Lord said slowly, "Especially…But I am not sure they will believe it; I had a hard time coming to terms with the information, even after watching the memories."
“Right; the box,” Hadrian glanced over at the window seat where the box was still sitting, looking innocent in the late morning light, “Well, I guess…I do want to see what’s in there. Of course, the stuff inside might not even be for me, since Petunia isn’t really my aunt. It’s still really strange to think that I’m not a Potter…”
"It's really Potter's place to tell you what happened," Severus began, "and I do not know everything, but I will tell you that Albus Dumbledore is behind this, and these potions…these potions are a farce. This one," he held up one of the vials, "is a healing potion, which was mixed with a power suppressing potion. The healing potion attempts to fix the injuries, but the power suppressant drains the healing properties. The healing potion will work on the wounds temporarily, but after a while they will re-open and be worse than before; it is the same with the salve you used. The other is a glamour potion, which is also mixed with the suppressant. By mixing the suppressant with the other two potions, Potter is not completely cut off from his power, but most of it is occupied with battling the potions in his system. What we have to do is get the magic suppressing potion out of his system before we can heal his injuries, but that will be difficult to do without him bleeding to death."
"Andromeda was four years older than Bellatrix and six years older than me," Narcissa replied, "So, no, I was not as close to her as I was to Bella. When we were younger, Andromeda spent all of her time studying, and it was a surprise to everyone when the Hat chose to Sort her Slytherin instead of Ravenclaw. By the time I started at Hogwarts, Andromeda was busy preparing for her NEWT studies, and so I rarely saw her. Of course, I now know she was also sneaking around with Edward Tonks, whom our parents would not have approved of."
"I was going to ask Tom his opinion first," he replied, "Hadrian seems to have a tendency to panic when he gets unwelcome news;" he frowned, "I can only assume that the abuse he recently received from his relatives is causing that reaction, as he has not been prone to panic attacks in the past."
"Yes, Master Hadrian," Tillie snapped and a selection of gift bags and tissue paper appeared on the desk, "What is Master Hadrian wishing to be using?"
“Well, Potter it seems that the contraceptive potion I gave you was a complete waste of my time and ingredients,” Snape announced, having just run a diagnostic scan on the young Omega in front of him.
“I love you, Draco Malfoy.”
“It worked this time,” Draco said, “You’ll be fine for another day.” Harry hummed his agreement, and smiled in thanks when he felt his glasses being removed; he wanted to say something, but he was just so tired! “I must talk to Mother about getting your eyes fixed,” Harry heard Draco murmur as the bed shifted; “Those glasses are atrocious.” He felt hands tucking the comforter around him more snugly, and then heard a soft, “Good night, Harry,” before sleep claimed him.
“Dobby,” he called softly, opening the wardrobe to find the House Elf sitting up, waiting for him, “I know you can’t use your magic, but can you feel magic around us?”
Draco pushed his thoughts aside, and turned to the letter from Pansy.
You sat tall and proud
“No, Harry,” Draco frowned, “I didn’t mean-”
“Astoria and I will still raise the child together,” Draco said, “Astoria and I were never in love, so this won’t be some hostile relationship where we fight all the time; we will have the child together to make our parents happy, and then we will both be free to find out own happiness. Although, I rather think I have already found my happiness, if you are willing to
“Albus Dumbledore may indeed be Harry Potter’s magical guardian," Severus began, "However this does not give him authorization to access either the Potter or Black vaults. Just today, we discovered that many things believed to be truths for the past sixteen years are in fact deceptions; the existence of Harry Potter is one such deception."
“That should be enough for tonight,” Vernon announced, grabbing Harry by the back of the neck and carelessly shoving him away from the desk. Harry whimpered again as he landed in the chair he had occupied earlier, and he discovered he could move again, as he leaned forward so that his back wasn’t touching the rough fabric of the chair.
December 22, 2011
“A map will help you recover from everything that has happened recently,” Severus told him, “You're body and mind have both been under a lot of stress, and Potions can only do so much.” He turned to Draco, “I will move your father to the study and make sure he allows you to rest until supper.”
"I hate to know you went through all of that," Ginny said, "but why couldn't you trust us? Mum and Dad would have helped you, you have to know that."
"He's in the back," Fred replied, before shouting over his shoulder, "Oi! George! You have a visitor! He's quite handsome too; if you don't hurry and get out here I just might steal him from you!"
"Well, to fight against Dumbledore, of course," Hadrian's tone said that he thought it was obvious, "Not outright fighting him, like with hexes and such, but undermining his authority and uniting the school against him. In addition, we want to reach out to everyone who has been negatively affected by his meddling and show them what truly happened."
Dobby apparated them into the kitchen of a Muggle house; Draco stood still for a moment, but he couldn’t sense anyone in the house.
"You must think I'm stupid Potter," Draco scoffed, "No, you will precede me; just walk around the corner of the house and up to the door." Harry bobbed his head once in agreement and then walked around in front of Malfoy; as he began to pass in front of the other wizard he suddenly lashed out with his tail and Draco cried out in surprise as he was knocked off balance.
I know they’ll return once you’re gone
"She is obviously torn between you and her brother," Draco said calmly, "and seeing you with me did not help matters any. Not that that excuses her; I still intend to have a few words with Ginerva the next time we meet. Are you truly feeling better now Hades?" Draco turned so that he could look Hadrian in the eyes, searching for any hint of discomfort or lasting injuries.
“Hey mate, just did the rounds and everything is secure,” Ron Weasley entered the workshop with a grin, then shook his head, “I still can't get over seeing you dressed like that.”
The two were in a private booth set in a warded alcove at an exclusive new restaurant in Celestial Ally, an offshoot of Diagon Alley that held shops and restaurants catering to the upper class. Draco had made the reservation so that they could celebrate Harry’s thirty-first birthday in privacy, since he had not been able to attend Harry’s party the night before. They had finished dessert but were loath to part-Draco was heading back to the North Pole after their date; he had only come down for one night, just so he could see Harry for his birthday.
"Accio-What the-?" Harry jumped back, as the dragon, taking offense at either the wand or the spell, roared and launched itself off the tree, looping around it once before diving at Harry. Harry cursed and dodged a stream of fire, then ran away from the tree. "Teddy-keep everyone back!" Harry ordered, ducking as the dragon dove at him again.
"Just one more," Hadrian said, wondering how to phrase it; in the end, he decided to just be blunt; "Are you still going to kill Muggles and Muggleborns? Also, what are we going to do about Dumbles and his Order of the Phoenix?”
“I’ll keep an eye on Malfoy when Mum doesn’t need me,” Ginny offered, “If it looks like he’s getting too much business, I’ll go hand out some more flyers or something. Don’t worry, Harry; we’ll win this thing!”
"Well, our parents had an organization called the 'Order of the Black Rose' and they are planning to start it up again," Draco began, "But, of course, they won't allow us to join-"
“You should have put it down as soon as you realized it wasn’t yours,” Harry glared, “I guess you just couldn’t resist getting ammunition against me; go on then-make fun of poor orphaned Harry, who’s only living relatives want nothing to do with him. Then, you can tell me how you really feel about me, and maybe you can get your parents to call off this stupid ritual so you won’t have to sully yourself with me.”
"Don't know why I even bother," Hadrian muttered as he walked past Draco towards the blonde's larger bathroom, "They treat me like I'm a bloody five-year-old who doesn't know how to dress himself."
"Hey!" Tom protested, "Elena is the one who wanted-" he trailed off as he noticed his wife's murderous glare, "Er, I mean, I love you honey?"
"Only the desperate ones," Draco conceded, "Why? What sort of pick-up lines do Muggles use?"
** ** ** ** ** ** **
Draco didn’t hesitate, but took Harry’s hips in a firm grip and moved slowly out, stopping with just the tip of his erection still inside Harry’s tight channel, and then sliding just as slowly back inside. He did this several times, until Harry began moving restlessly beneath him. Draco took the hint and tightened his grip as he increased his pace, trying out different angles as he searched for the spot that would have Harry seeing stars. When he found it, Draco kept to that angle even as he reached under Harry to begin stroking his cock again. It didn’t take long before they were both falling over the edge, the magic surrounding them spurring them on so that they found their release simultaneously.
"The tracking spell on his choker isn't working either," Draco told her, "If they disabled that then Hadrian won't be able to use any of the protections on the choker. The twins are very good at what they do, so someone powerful had to have altered it."
He wondered if Draco might feel the same
“Stop it Draco!” Narcissa commanded, grabbing her son by the arm and forcing him to look at her, “You are not a bad mate! Sometimes things happen that are beyond your control; you do not whine about it, you fix it and then do everything in your power to make sure that it does not happen again. Tom said those things because he was worried about his son. We will find him; we know that it was someone on Dumbledore’s side who took him, and Dumbledore needs Hadrian alive. Any injuries Hadrian sustains while in their hands will be repaid threefold once we have him safe again. Now come; where else might he be? Perhaps Dumbledore has placed him with the Weasley’s; Have Dobby take us there, and if we do not find him you can contact your friends and have them assist us.”
“Better,” Draco hummed, giving Harry another brief kiss before sliding back down the bed. “Well, I suppose it would be a shame to waste all that preparation.”
“Perhaps tomorrow,” Draco said, taking Hadrian’s hand in his own, “Hades and I were planning to start on the translation today anyway.”
“Stand up,” a hand on my arm pulls me to my feet and leads me to the other side of the alcove, which is much larger than I first thought. I see shapes start to appear out of the shadows, and realize there is a bed, a small table and a chair, all in front of a fireplace which heats the small area.
"My Lord," Draco said hesitantly, "With your permission, I believe I can order my house elf to go get the pensieve out of Father’s office; it should work, as I am Head of the family whilst he is in-unavailable."
Hadrian reached up and found a collar or something around his neck; he could feel a charm dangling from the collar, and stones studded around it. Frowning, Hadrian found the clasp on the collar, but found that it wouldn’t come loose; what was this? Had someone marked him like some sort of dog? Why couldn’t he remember anything?
“I wasn’t going to fall,” Harry rolled his eyes, “I was just trying to see-well, everything. I’ve never seen anyplace so beautiful!”
"Since the matter of Hadrian's custody has been settled, I shall take my leave," Severus said, "I can begin preparations for brewing the potion, while we locate the Horcruxes."
“Right on time,” Narcissa smiled, “Our guests should be arriving in a few minutes. Madame Longbottom and I will be talking about subjects that we need to keep away from your friends for now, so she and I will have tea in the garden and leave you to amuse your friends. Also, I have been advised that Luna Lovegood will be coming along as well.” Hadrian and Draco simply nodded; they had expected Luna would be joining them. Before more could be said, a house elf appeared to announce the arrival of their guests, and Narcissa led the way to the receiving room.
"I am going to the library to look for those books," Draco announced, picking Arden (the little dragon had been taken to the kitchen to eat, and then returned by Tillie near the end of breakfast) up and settling the dragon around his shoulders, "Do you want to join me, or will you meet me back upstairs?"
"All I know is her family is somewhere in America," Tom replied, "Her father enjoyed moving around every couple of years, although she did mention that they have a family manor…I don't recall where it is though; we never had a chance to visit before Dumbledore interfered in our lives."
“Speaking of ice skating,” Ron interjects, “You guys want to check out the rink? It’s in the middle of a field, so no chance of falling into a freezing lake with an angry giant squid.”
“Not going to happen,” Harry glared at the brunet witch, then looked over her shoulder as the sound of giggling caught his attention; “Luna? I didn’t know you were here. Parkinson, give me some real clothes now.”
"We got the letter," Hermione said, "and it was very hurtful; how could you say such things to us Harry? We've been your best friends since first year, and for you to just accuse us of using you...and then you turned to Malfoy for help?! And what happened to your glasses?"
Lucius scowled, intending to correct his wife’s misconception-oversight indeed! -but at that moment their house elf Wispy appeared, holding a scroll and a notebook.
After viewing the first set of memories Severus was stunned, but he knew there was more, so he continued to view them, one vial after another. Oddly enough, one of the heavily warded vials was from a few nights ago, but Severus understood why it was there once he viewed it; the memory showed Albus betraying his students trust and giving Muggles-Muggles!-potions to use against him.
The orb returned to its previous silver color as the image of Aracely faded, and Hadrian looked at Draco with wide eyes.
"I assume you know how to contact him," Lucius stated, and Severus nodded.
“Yes, so hot,” he groans, his fingers digging into my flesh and no doubt leaving bruises on the backs of my thighs, “Love this…”
Sitting up in the middle of the bed, Harry took one last look at his family, then cuddled into Draco's side, sighing happily when his husband turned into him, throwing an arm around his waist.
“I believe that would be best,” Augusta replied, “Where are these memories?”
“I’ll call a House Elf if I get lost,” Hadrian said, as they parted ways at the door to the sunroom, “I’ll see you in a bit.” Hadrian accepted a brief kiss, and then headed for the stairs, while Draco made his way to the library.
“Very well,” Draco sighed, “We can spend an hour or so translating the potions journal.” He summoned a quill and some parchment, before reluctantly setting it aside to accept the pen and notebook Hadrian handed to him.
“Wait,” Harry frowned, “You-I thought you said you couldn’t get a divorce?”
"You're just a sore loser," Draco teased, as both boys flew back towards the ground, "And now you owe me a forfeit...that's in addition to the life debt you already owe me."
“Harry,” Draco began, but Harry leaned forward to kiss him, sliding his fingers through silky blond hair and holding Draco still when he would have pulled away. After a moment, Harry felt Draco relax and strong arms slipped around his waist, pulling him against his lover’s body.
“That’s why you told me about being Santa?” Harry asked, “Because you need someone to marry you?” He was frowning, and Draco immediately knew what he was thinking.
“This!” Harry indicated the book, “The book is full of runes, and whole pages are in Latin-I can’t even read half of it!”
But never knowing the reason
"All settled then?" Narcissa asked with amusement and Hadrian blushed as he realized everyone had been watching their little exchange, "Excellent; so, do you have any questions Hadrian?"
As they walked down to breakfast, the boys continued to discuss Arden and dragons in general. When they arrived in the sunroom, both Malfoy's were already at the table and, after everyone had finished eating, they discussed what the boys could expect for the rest of the summer.
“I’ll remember that,” Hadrian promised, “Night, Dray.”
It was five years after the war, and Harry and Luna were standing in the middle of their new shop, Nargles and Nibbles. The shop was a book store/café combination, with the café at the back of the shop. Seating areas were scattered amongst the bookshelves, and a book exchange counter was in the middle of the shop; the book exchange would allow customers to bring in books they no longer needed and trade them in for money or store credit. Harry thought this would be especially helpful for students, as they could return their previous years school for credit towards new texts. In amongst the regular book offerings, were several more unusual books, all ordered by Luna, plus back copies of the Quibbler. The café area at the back of the shop had several small tables and a few couches. Harry and Luna would have a regular menu of tea, coffee, sandwiches and pastries, along with a rotating menu of unique food options.
"Everyone knows that Veela instincts can kick in early if the Veela's mate is seriously injured," Draco began, "and when Potter came to me seeking sanctuary he was in a lot of pain, although the stupid Gryffindor tried to hide it."
“I don’t know,” Harry replied, “I do kind of want to watch the movie now, though. I’m just surprised Teddy liked it; it seemed a little…dark for a kid. Especially that boogie monster, and Jack getting shot out of the sky.”
"Very well, since I am already set up, shall I?" Lucius nodded, so Severus took out a clean sheet of parchment from one of the desk drawers and penned a swift note to Narcissa, "Would you summon a house elf to get this sent off?"
A few minutes later his makeup was done, and Draco had slipped a pair of silver platform heels on his feet. The heels were higher than Harry would have liked, but the heel was also thick enough that he didn’t feel like he was balancing on a wand tip, and he was able to walk with only a slight wobble. For the finishing touch, Draco gave him a black choker with
"Don't worry; he's just hungry," Narcissa laughed, reaching out her arms to take Draco back from Lucius, "You might want to get used to him Sev-after all, we are naming you his godfather." She adjusted Draco to feed him, watching Severus with amused blue eyes.
"Yeah; shouldn't be a problem," Fred replied just as the door opened, revealing Hadrian and George, the former of which was carrying a small package and smiling in a very self-satisfied sort of way.
“That’s correct,” Draco confirmed, “This is your last chance to change your mind; once we begin, The Ritual cannot be abandoned.”
“Maybe next time,” Draco replied, “Tell me what you want-tell me how badly you want to cum.”
"It couldn't hurt," Draco shrugged, "All you have to do is formally request Sanctuary; the exact wording doesn't matter."
“Very well,” Draco said, managing to keep his voice casual, “but if I allow that, then you also get a gag afterwards.” Harry quickly nodded, the idea very appealing to him; who knew dressing in girl’s clothes would bring out the pervert in him? “Well then, what are you waiting for?” Draco demanded, discreetly activating a charm before setting the camera down. “On your knees, Potter.” Harry crossed the few steps to where Draco was waiting, and the blond helped him kneel; he still had the heels on, thanks to a cushioning charm Draco had discovered. “And I think your hands belong behind your back, don’t you?”
"Well, we can't know anything for certain until we return everyone's memories," Lucius said, "We will, of course, see whether Andromeda was coerced by the Headmaster and do everything in our power to reverse his influence if he is responsible for her actions." Lucius smiled at his wife, adding, "I must admit, however, that I am glad you are the one I married."
Harry gave him a narrow-eyed look of suspicion, before sighing and nodding.
"My Lord," Severus interrupted quickly, "Perhaps now would be the time to tell the boys what we discovered last night." The Dark Lord stared at him blankly for a moment, before nodding his agreement.
"I think her mother is Bellatrix," Draco murmured back, "See? They both have dark, wild hair and grey eyes like most of the Black's. That would make her a Lestrange, as Aunt Bellatrix married Rodolphus."
“Last pose is your choice,” Draco informed the brunet, “On the bed, but do you want a blindfold or just to be bound to the bed?” Harry thought about it for a moment before making a decision.
“It’s okay love,” Draco whispered, using magic to vanish his own clothes, “I know what you need. I’ll make it better.” Draco captured his lips in a fierce kiss, one hand tangling in thick locks while the other skimmed down Harry’s side, before slipping between his legs. A cool finger pressed against Harry’s hole, and he realized he was already wet, dripping with natural lubricant. Harry pushed back against the finger, whining when it wasn’t enough. Draco quickly inserted two more, and Harry gasped as his prostate was stroked repeatedly; Draco ate the sounds his husband was making, then pulled away with a growl, before dragging Harry across the room and pushing him down on the bed.
Draco frowned as he re-read the letter; perhaps, since he was dealing with a Gryffindor, he should just be honest with him. Draco would share his letter with Potter-and share any future letters as well. If he was honest with Potter, then the other boy might come to view him as an ally instead of an enemy.
The next scene was in a large, comfortable-looking room, and it showed Tom and Elena, Lucius and Narcissa, Bellatrix Lestrange and her husband Rodolphus, along with Severus, Sirius, and Regulus sitting on the furniture and watching four babies crawl around on the floor. Draco was obviously one of the children, with his pale blonde hair, and the Riddle twins were also on the floor-Hadrian still had thick black hair, while Aracely’s hair had darkened slightly to have some red highlights in it- and the other child was another girl with a headful of wild black curls; Draco and Hadrian were playing with a stuffed dragon that was flying around their heads, while the girls were coloring happily. There was a noise at the door and it opened to reveal the Potter's with a baby in Lily's arms, Remus, and another young couple he recognized as Alice and Frank Longbottom, along with Augusta Longbottom, who was holding a small boy.
“She better not,” Harry grumbled, “No magic allowed, remember?”
"I am very sorry it has come to this," Dumbledore said sadly, "You all have the potential to be very powerful, and we could accomplish much together, but I cannot allow you all to exist at odds with me."
"Taller?" Draco arched a brow, "I can't imagine you walked into a door simply because I'm taller. What else is different?"
“Wait,” Draco put a hand on his arm, “Breakfast can wait a minute. Come here.” Harry let Draco pull him into the office and close the door behind him. Draco crossed over to the fire and stood there silently, and only then did Harry notice the tension in the blond’s shoulders.
"I need you to bring me the vial of memories that Hadrian and I viewed yesterday," Draco commanded, before looking at the twins, "Do you have a pensieve?"
“Really?” Draco lifted Arden off his shoulders and set him on the bed, then picked up the package and examined it curiously, “Do you think it’s safe to open?”
“I asked around and found a pile of presents that had never been delivered,” Draco told him, “These were all addressed to you, and I was told that there was a ward preventing the previous Santa from getting them to you. I am certain you know a spell to authenticate the age of these gifts?”
"Of course I can, Ginny," Hadrian replied, "You didn't understand what was going on; I promise you'll understand better later. Just, I guess I should tell you that not all the information we've discovered will be good news."
“What? You mean like giving a possessed diary to an eleven-year-old girl? Or beating a House Elf nearly to death? Or trying to attack a twelve-year-old boy because he was stupid enough to be tricked into freeing the House Elf?” Draco’s scowl grew as Harry continued, “I know, how about trying to get Hagrid fired because his son couldn’t be bothered to follow instructions? Or tormenting Muggles while wearing his Death Eater robes? OR, hell, how about becoming a Death Eater in the first place?”
The memory went along the same vein for some time, with the wizards present making a compelling argument, and the Longbottoms nodded thoughtfully.
“Harry, what happened to your arm?” Narcissa demanded, vanishing the sleeve; she gasped when she saw the large, circular scar on his arm, the skin still pink and shiny.
“Barring any massive emergencies, I do not return to work until the second week of January,” Draco confirmed, “Healer Meadows made sure that I am the last name on the St. Mungo’s emergency roster this year.”
“Wait a few minutes,” Draco said, “The orb is still active, so it’s possible that this is a private conversation you do not need to hear. The orb will protect both twins’ privacy when necessary. Are you feeling better yet? It appears that Aracely has a plan to get herself out of the arranged marriage.”
“Mrs. Weasley forced me to sit down and eat at lunch and supper,” Harry laughed, “She still tells me I’m too skinny.”
Finally, the day came for Harry and Draco to return to school.
“Did anyone see you coming down here?” Draco asks.
"The Telly," Hadrian replied, "Honestly Parkinson-if you're trying to insult someone you should at least make sure you have your facts straight. As for why I'm here, well it's really none of your business, but the Muggles do have something to do with it, and so does Dumbledore."
Hadrian woke early the next morning feeling safe and warm, the strong arms wrapped around him making him reluctant to get out of bed. He snuggled in closer to the warmth, giving a contented sigh; he couldn't remember the last time he felt so comfortable. The arms around him tightened slightly, and Hadrian came to full wakefulness as he realized that he was wrapped in a tight embrace; his head was resting on Draco's chest with one of Draco's arms slung across his waist and the other cupping the back of his neck.
“Fuck if I know,” Malfoy replied, “I returned to my dorm after supper, intending to read for a while. When I picked up my book, I discovered it was a portkey, which dropped me into this room.” Malfoy looked around for a moment, then added, “I believe it is one of the Malfoy summer homes, but I am not certain, as I have been unable to leave. There is this bedroom, a bathroom and a study, but all the exterior doors and windows are locked. I tried summoning my House Elf, but he did not respond, nor did any of the other family Elves. What I want to know is how you got here.”
“The second option,” Malfoy interrupted, not waiting to hear what the other option was, “I believe in honor and loyalty to family. I can’t imagine letting anyone treat me the way the Dark Lord treats my father. I can’t believe my father lets the Dark Lord treat him like that.”
“You might change your mind about div-I mean, getting the annulment-after the baby is born,” Harry said, “You might decide it would be better to raise him with two parents.”
“Harry?” He called, pushing the door open, only to frown when he saw that the room was empty, and the fire had burnt out long ago. Draco realized that Harry must have left already; not that he could blame the other man. Draco scowled as he made his way upstairs, planning revenge on Trainee Healer Roberson for making him miss his first Christmas celebration with Harry. Draco angrily pushed the bedroom door open, hard enough that it bounced off the wall and almost hit him in the face when he came to a sudden stop in the doorway. Hastily catching the door, Draco stepped into the room, grey eyes wide as he took in the sight in front of him.
“Cool!” Harry cheered, grabbing Draco’s hand, “Let’s go! Are we apparating?”
When Hadrian awoke again, it was to find that Arden was gone, but a small package was sitting next to him on the bed, along with a letter.
“Or we could do this,” Draco interrupted, sliding his hand from Harry’s hip down to the small of his back. Harry looked up with wide eyes as Draco leaned forward, pressing their lips together. Harry took a step back, but Draco moved right along with him, releasing Harry’s hand and tangling his fingers in thick, dark locks instead. Harry placed his hands on Draco’s chest, intending to push him away, but then the blond gently bit his lip and Harry gasped. That open mouth was an invitation Draco had no intention of refusing, and he immediately slipped his tongue inside, eagerly sampling Harry’s flavor. The moment Draco’s tongue touched his, Harry forgot his un-voiced protests, and wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck to draw him closer. Draco’s hand on Harry’s back pulled the brunet closer, and he immediately regretted it as Harry jumped away when he felt Draco’s erection.
December 21
“Do something, Ronald!” Molly Weasley screamed, “He’ll go straight back to the Malfoy’s!” Hadrian heard footsteps behind him and knew that Ron was chasing him. Hadrian was only a little worried; he knew he was faster than his former friend. Then, he heard Molly yell again.
Draco, wisely, chose not to argue with his friend; Pansy was vicious when angry, and something had obviously already happened to her this morning. Upon entering the kitchen, he found Blaise already hard at work, whistling cheerfully.
"Nope; I'm good," Fred replied.
"He damn well better," Draco growled, "I don't care if I have to place
"Shut up boy!" Vernon thundered, shoving Harry so that he crashed through the kitchen door and fell to the floor, "You've had it easy until now, but all that is about to change.” He grabbed Harry’s arm and pulled him to his feet, then pushed him down into a chair, setting a hand on each shoulder and applying pressure to keep him from getting up. Vernon motioned for Petunia, who was standing by the counter, to bring the vials over, "Give him the one to stop him from telling anyone about what happens here,” Vernon instructed, “then we’ll use the one to block his freakishness." Petunia nodded and held up a vial of green potion; Harry bided his time and waited for Petunia to get closer and then he struck out, kicking the vial from her hands. Petunia screamed in shock as the vial fell to the ground and shattered into tiny pieces, green potion splattering everywhere.
“Yes, Harry,” Narcissa laughed lightly, “Wizards are capable of getting pregnant, although only Omegas can do so naturally; if a Beta Wizard wanted to become pregnant, he would have to take a potion. An Omega, on the other hand, becomes capable of bearing children during his first Heat. Heat, is something that we will discuss when you are older. For now, the important thing to remember is that Omegas are magically powerful, but they need someone to help them direct that power. Once an Omega becomes and adult, he will have trouble controlling his magic unless he is grounded by mating with an Alpha. Omegas always bond with male Alphas, as they cannot have children with a female Alpha. Omegas are also more submissive than Alphas or Betas, but they are only submissive to an Alpha who earns their respect. Until an Omega is bonded, he may come across as more dominant in order to protect himself. Do you have any questions, Harry?”
"Oh, er, okay," Hadrian agreed, "Do I put my hand on the book?"
The two rivals would be forced to address all their rage
A few hours later, Harry closed the door to his new room with a sigh of relief. McGonagall had led him to his new quarters, and he had been unpleasantly surprised to find that his Slytherin roommate was Malfoy; it was better than Crabbe or Goyle, but Harry would have preferred Zabini, since he’d never really had a fight with him. His Hufflepuff roommate was Justin Finch-Fletchley, and Michael Corner was his Ravenclaw roommate.
"Arden it is then," Lucius said approvingly, "We should head into the ballroom before the guests start arriving." Everyone stood up, and Arden climbed up to curl around Draco's shoulders; Draco reached out and wrapped one arm around Hadrian's waist. Arden lifted his head to sniff at Hadrian's hair before settling back down around Draco's shoulders. The small group left the family parlor with Hadrian and Draco trailing behind as they headed for the ballroom.
"And how's your memory? What did you do yesterday?"
"Merlin, Granger, what on earth does it
kinds of recovery, but certainly not so soon. We should be careful."
If Harry were completely honest with himself, he had
"Oh, is that what this is about?" he said. "Alright, Potter, I'll take your guilt money in Muggle though, thanks. No wait, you're going to buy me some bloody disgusting sandwich, aren't you? Couldn't have me
Teddy burbled something that might have had the word 'trains' in it.
"Obviously," said Draco, looking at Harry's mouth again. "Not least because you are just outrageously,
"Who else is on the roster?" Malfoy asked, very quietly.
"Humans are very diverse creatures," she said. "Nobody feels exactly the same about their sexuality. I could spend forever wondering about exactly how to define all the details and boundaries of my attraction. Is it pheromones that attracted me to Ron? Does he remind me of my father? Is it that I'm attracted to personality more than looks? Then what was going on in my head with Professor Lockheart in third year? That sort of thing, round and round in circles. But at the end of the day, I know what I like and what I want when I see it, and that's all I need to know. No right or wrong about it."
"Didn't understand a word of it, mind," said Malfoy.
"Liar," said Harry, grinning. Ron turned his head lazily, a smile creeping over his face.
"Ah, something I can help with," said Blaise. "Are you having trouble with the Ministry Application for Muggle Identification?"
John hefted the box up and pushed it into Harry's arms. Harry followed John to the front of the van.
"Don't mind me," he said. Dean jumped.
, slamming his head down into the stone. The world greyed, and he reached up blindly through the pain to pull Draco's hair. He yanked his head up and pushed Malfoy back, rolling over until he was on top, knees either side of his hips as he scrabbled to pin Draco's hands down. But Draco was lithe and fast and Harry was dizzy, and Malfoy caught him with a vicious punch and rolled away. Harry grabbed at Draco's robes, ready to hurt him back now, but Draco was already regrouping, lunging, and the breath was knocked out of him as Malfoy dived and caught his wrists tight enough to bruise. Harry wriggled, trying wildly to escape, but Mafloy had his whole weight on Harry and the hands around his wrists felt like they might snap his bones any moment and the only thing Harry could think to do was arch up and bite...
life — so he pulled her close and kissed her forehead and they stayed there for a long moment. Then he let her go.
"Sex does change how you feel," said Dean, looking at Ginny. "Sometimes."
"Just got a reply," said Ron, scowling. "It's pretty short. It just says 'Look on the can.'"
"You probably need a Muggle bank account," said Hermione. "Like I said you should get months ago."
Hermione gave him a reproving look this time. Harry downed the rest of his cocktail and quietly hoped Malfoy had poisoned it.
, but in all other respects left him more confused than educated.
"I rather meant your plans to woo the household," said Blaise. "Surely you aren't planning to squander the opportunity to make the kind of allies you could make here?"
Stood this close, Harry could see that Malfoy's eyes were wide and panicky, his hand gripped tight around the ladle. Harry wanted to believe him, but he'd learned a lot about addiction by this point.
"Right," he breathed.
Harry smiled.
"Oh!" said Hermione. "So you fought? But you came in looking thoroughly snogged..."
"So, you marry Ginny," he said, one hand gesturing wide. The other remained firmly on Harry's hip, nails digging into his flesh, pleasantly possessive. "I'm sure your wedding would be very romantic. You'd probably be the youngest Head Auror ever or some such thing, and Ginny would win the World Cup, and you'd both end up having at least three babies that would be substantially raised by someone other than the pair of you. They would probably grow up to be entitled little rich brats, just like I was." He put a hand to his heart in mock-affection for Harry's imaginary children.
"Nah," said Hermione. "He's quite handy to have around to read my diss."
"See you, mate," said Ron, patting him sympathetically. "I'll brief everyone in the dorm about nasal precautions. You know, just in case."
"So how do you know Ginny?" she said.
"Oi, Potter," said Malfoy. "Turn it off a second."
"They were very well-shot," she admitted. "Black and white. Surprisingly classy."
," said Hermione sternly.
Harry ran a fingernail along the worn wood of the bench.
"You should go to Ginny's group," said Malfoy, and for a while Harry couldn't quite understand what he meant, busy as he was watching Malfoy's mouth form the words.
"You're welcome to illustrate for the
"I haven't got the money," said Malfoy, looking away.
There were food stalls up at the Lock, just as the man in the trenchcoat had said. The air was thick with the sound of sizzling food and the smell of spices, and Harry's stomach growled. But Malfoy was moving fast, striding through the dizzying maze of stalls and buildings, scanning the area for a tea and cake establishment like his life depended on it. Harry was just about to stop and reassure him that it didn't
"Actually," said Harry, looking around at the greasy shops opposite the park and taking a calculated risk. "Why don't you go ahead? I want to grab a snack from the kebab shop over the road. Unless you want to join me?"
"Fuck no," growled Harry, pushing Draco backwards, continuing to push until Draco was up against the wall. "I'm not done yet."
"Well?" said Draco, after a minute, tilting his head to look at Harry. "Alright, fine, I'll start. Do you have any
"I just don't know how," Harry continued. "I thought I was going to do good by catching Dark wizards for the rest of my life, but I can't bear the thought of it now."
Harry continued to stare, at a loss. They'd kissed, and now he was off to work for Voldemort, and wasn't there some rule against this sort of thing? An agent of the Dark Lord and the one Chosen to defeat him?
"I don't want to just see him back on the street."
"I hate you," he hissed. "Don't ever come near me again."
"Alright?" asked Seamus, immediately by his side, tone prickly with violence.
Harry wouldn't have gone to Grimmauld, not for all the gold in Gringotts, but there were reporters camped out outside the Ministry that day. He didn't think he could Apparate in the state he was in, so he ran. He ran until his legs burned, until his chest was on fire, until the world around him blurred and even the most dedicated paparazzo had given up. He ran a familiar path in the grey London rain, ran without thought, right up the steps and to the front door.
It looked like the sort of place Harry couldn't quite believe he owned. He wondered if he might sell it one day, now that people wouldn't turn tail at the very sight of it.
"Not just the war, Malfoy, he's got a lot more than that going on."
"This is useless," he said. "None of this looks like something I'd wear."
He stared at the carving for a long time. It was always with him, the knowledge that he was living in Sirius's ancestral home, but it struck him now that it must have been a strange feeling to have your antecedents looking over your shoulder at every moment of your life. Sirius's childhood world was steeped in layers of family tradition. He would have known his history back to ancient times, seen portraits of his great-great-great-grandfather, known exactly the winding path of joys and sorrows that led to his existence. Harry didn't know what that was like. Was it always bad? Was it always oppressive? Or would his mother and father's traditions have given him comfort? He would never know.
"Right," she said. "On three, we'll run for it. One, two, three!"
"Thought I'd get a spot of free soup," he joked.
"Yeah, course, except for two things. One, the smell of gherkins turns my stomach, and two,
"Oh," he said dully. "It's you."
"Oh, yes, well. Actually, I wanted to do a grand reveal, but I was a bit nervous at first and then the party got away from me and then there was" — his eyes dropped to Harry's open jeans — " and so it flew right out of my mind."
"That's right.” Andromeda smiled at Teddy. "Of course, he took to saying many other words immediately after, including such delights as
"Yes I have," said Harry. "I think maybe I do like guys. A guy."
could repair.
"Yes, isn't it odd," mused Draco, faux-casual. "Nothing ever turns out the way you think it will when you're in school. But perhaps that's for the best."
"Magical Houses has Magical Deeds." Kreacher spoke slowly, as though he thought Harry might be a little dense. "They soak up the magics of their owners, and the Deed binds and controls it. Like house-elves, Houses is magical in themselves, and they is wanting to be owned."
"It's not like that - it's not about

Harry sighed.
Harry blinked at him, astonished, and opened his mouth to argue. To point out he had panic attacks, that he was scared to leave his bubble of safety, that so many small and normal things made him sick to his stomach, but Malfoy cut him off.
"Right," said Malfoy, looking jittery. "Right. Because you look a bit… high."
Dean winced.

"No," said Ron, with deadly calm. "No, he's dating my
Except for one last place. One quiet afternoon, Harry found himself standing outside Sirius's room. He hadn't really made a decision to do it; he'd just drifted here, trance-like, and now he was on the threshold it seemed silly to hold back. He pushed the handle down, and let the door creak open under his palm.
Harry felt sick. He couldn't imagine Draco Malfoy
Harry grinned.

Neville was blushing now, for all his previous pallor.
"Well?" said Seamus, who was also eyeing Malfoy. "How

If Harry had been in Malfoy's position, indoctrinated from birth and with family and honour at stake, would he have done any better? He doubted it. He wondered if he might even have been much, much worse

"We'll be late to get our timetables," said Hermione kindly. "We'll pick up everything you need, don't worry. Coming, Ginny?"
"Morning," he sighed, and slumped face-down onto a bean bag.
Harry sat on the edge of his bed in despair.
"It's a very classy facsimile, at least."
"You're really obscene," said Harry to the blond boy waiting outside, looking somewhat like sex personified in an open shirt and tight jeans. Or maybe it was just Harry.
"Perhaps I can do something about her," said Blaise, a note of emotion creeping into that otherwise unreadable voice.
"Any luck job hunting yet?" asked Luna.
Dean, chastened, handed him back the catalogue. It was heavy, and the people smiling on the front did nothing to inspire him into a sudden enthusiasm for fashion. He flicked through the pages idly, looking at jeans and tracksuits, cardigans and baggy jackets, feeling nothing but a faint sense of despair at the idea of owning any of them. There was a whole section devoted to clothing he was fairly certain Uncle Vernon actually possessed, and the clothes targeted at his age group reminded him uncomfortably of the sort of thing Dudley would drool over. None of the glossy men and women looked like him.
"No problem," said Harry, running a hand through his hair.
"It's a stretch," said Dean, smirking at Harry, "But I
"Wouldn't be your smartest move either way," he agreed. "Given that there's no chance in hell anyone in the house would ever sell Harry out, we're all more than equipped to take you down, and one of us is going to be an Auror soon."
"No," said Malfoy, with a dark laugh, voice edging back to plummy. "This might not surprise you to hear, but the Dark Lord thought I was rather a wet blanket. I wasn't exactly

have one," said Hermione, while Ron pulled a dubious face behind her back. "What if you want a Muggle job? To buy a Muggle house? To use Muggle services?"
Harry stayed firmly out of both Draco and Hermione's way for the rest of the afternoon, only coming down from his room for dinner, suspecting if not outright knowing that Hermione would give him a grilling if she found a moment. Malfoy had done a good job with dinner, a perfectly delicious pasta bake, and everyone made a big fuss about how unreasonable it was for such a posh git to be good at cooking and how Harry had competition until Draco was practically radiating with pleasure. It looked good on him; made Harry want to pull him aside and tell him every little thing Harry admired about him until Draco was squirming with it.
"I want to speak with you after the party Bella," Tom said as he got to his feet, "We have much to discuss. Now go to the ballroom and wait for us." Bella bowed and left the room, and Draco started to stand up but Hadrian tugged on his arm, keeping him seated.
"Sorry I insulted you Weasley," he was embarrassed at having to apologize-and to a Weasley, no less!-, but the bright smile Hadrian flashed at him made it worth it, "You know, you really do have a beautiful smile." He was rewarded by another blush, followed by a chuckle from George.
"I think our first Christmas together as an official family is off to a good start," Draco murmured.
“Thanks for the offer,” Harry laughed again, “I think I’ll pass though. I’m not mad at him or anything; the competition could be fun. Besides, I expect we’ll have very different customers.”
"Make it fly, Daddy!" Albus agreed, tugging on Harry's sleeve.
"Well, now that that has been settled we can move on," Narcissa interjected before Hadrian could reply, "Draco, have you had the chance to tell Hadrian about our family history-to be specific, our blood-lines?"
"Oh? And who are the books written by?" Draco asked as he stretched his arms above his head, letting one fall across Hadrian's shoulders; the brunet blushed and glared at Draco, shrugging his arm off.
"That is the conclusion I have reached," he confirmed, "However, as I informed Draco, we won't know anything for certain until after his birthday; we may even have to wait for Hadrian's birthday to know for sure if they are mates. He could simply be reacting because his Veela recognizes Hadrian as a friend who needs protection.”
“Oh, I have plans alright,” Harry replied, “I plan to give you a special gift for putting up with my silly Christmas demands.”
Draco and his mother crossed the hall and entered Draco’s suite, and then settled in the sitting room. Two cups of cocoa were waiting for them, along with a tray of pastries.
“Well, that’s not a hard thing to do,” Draco scoffed, “He only let you risk your left two or three times a year. Anything else of interest, that you want to share with me?”
“I know you will,” Harry smile softly, “It’s only been a week, but I already trust you more than anyone else I’ve ever met. Well, except for Fred and George, but they rescued me too, once.”
"Sure; let me just tell Lee and Angelina to watch the shop for us," Fred said, "George can take you upstairs to our flat."
"Hey Sev," Lily greeted, "Luca; Tom; this is my cousin Elena I was telling you about. She’s in fourth year with you, Tom. Her father's a Pruitt-distantly related to the Prewitt's here, but their branch of the family moved to America a few generations ago. Elena, this is Severus, Lucius and Tom."
//////////////////////
“Well, of course not,” Pansy called back, giggling, “That is for wearing in private; I just need to make sure it fits. Come out, Harry darling; I still need you to try on your new uniform.”
It took several minutes for Potter to set everything up, but when he was finished the sight left Draco breathless.
Once he was dressed in fresh clothes (Draco always made sure to have a few outfits at Harry’s, because he hated wearing the same clothes twice), Draco made his way downstairs and smiled when he found Harry sitting in the kitchen eating breakfast. Across from Harry, was another plate of food under a stasis charm.
“I figured you could use the competition,” Malfoy smirked again, “See you around, Potter.”
“Don’t call me ridiculous!” Harry’s shout startled Draco into silence; “At least I’m not a lying, manipulative Slytherin bastard like you!”
“What-that was horrible!” he said, “I can’t believe-that bastard is forcing her to marry someone who cheated on her? And the way he grabbed her-he’s abusive too!”
“I don’t know what else to do, Mother,” Draco admitted, following his mother into her study, “We’ve checked with all his friends and checked the places where Dumbledore might have hidden Hadrian. With his magic blocked, I can’t find him. What can I do?”
“Er-you said this place is protected?” Harry questioned, “No one can get in except Draco and me?”
“Yes, Master Hadrian?” Dobby looked over from where he had been fixing breakfast for the two of them, and smiled at the tiny dragon, “Oh! Master is not being remembering . That is being Arden; Master Hadrian is finding little dragon and giving him to Master Draco for his birthday.”
“Don’t worry,” Ginny interrupted, “I’ll stay with her and make sure she actually closes up, and cancels the warming spells and all.” Harry hesitated; he just didn’t feel right leaving Ginny behind when it was his shop. “Go now, or I’ll show you the new spell George taught me.
“Was that okay?” Draco asked, and Harry nodded.
“Fine!” Harry huffed, “Will you please let me cum? Please fuck me or suck me or whatever, and let me cum.”
“I is not having proof,” Dobby shook his head, “Master Hadrian might be having proof in Master Hadrian’s pocket.” Harry frowned, but searched through his pockets. He found a rolled up scroll, tied with a blue ribbon in his left pocket, and he unrolled it. Upon reading the scroll, he saw that it was confirmation of his status as Draco’s Mate, as well as a record of Draco granting him Sanctuary, and the ministry acknowledging Narcissa Malfoy as his magical guardian.
“Awfully cocky,” Harry returned, “Maybe I want to go straight to bed after supper.”
“Right,” Bernard said, “I should have remembered that. Really sorry to interrupt, but this is an emergency. We need you back at the North Pole.”
Always knowing I didn’t belong
"I just want to pull him off Harry," Draco assured her, "I won't attack him unless he attacks me first." Or, until he made sure Hadrian was safe, whichever happened first.
"Harry Potter’s existence is a lie," Draco drawled, his tone bored even as he reached out to squeeze Hadrian's hand reassuringly, "Albus Dumbledore was not satisfied with the choices several of his former students were making, and so decided to remove those he viewed as threats. He created a Dark Lord for the world to fear, so that everyone would once again look to him for guidance. Dumbledore, however, did not want to destroy the new Dark Lord himself; instead, he wished to be seen as a mentor and protector of the “destined hero”. To that end, he needed a pawn, a figurehead that he could manipulate, but who would also draw the loyalty of the wizarding world, so he altered people's memories and kidnapped children, changing their identities to suit his purposes; one of the identities was that of Harry Potter.” Draco turned to look at Hadrian, “Harry Potter is not, as Dumbledore would have you believe, the son of James and Lily Potter, but is instead a boy forced to participate in a blood adoption ritual as a child; earlier this afternoon he was returned to his true self. This, is Hadrian Riddle, formerly Harry Potter."
“Don’t worry about that yet,” Severus smirked, “Draco has enough common sense to make Po-I mean Hadrian-wait until after you defeat Dumbledore to kill you; less work for them.” Lucius laughed, and Tom glared at his two friends as he swept from the room; he was starting to think that things had been better when Lucius and Severus had feared him.
What followed was a long, intense scene that involved a lot of screaming and cursing from Elena, laughter from the men in the room, and encouraging words from Lily and Molly. Harry had turned his head away, in no way ready to experience the mysteries of childbirth, but he looked back over quickly when he heard a loud cry, and was just in time to see the first baby born.
"Well, Hadrian feels that the headmaster deserves to suffer before he is granted release in death," Severus replied, "and our master, Tom, seems to agree with him whole-heartedly. We have a long way to go before we take on Dumbledore however; reversing the damage caused when Tom was forced to create those Horcruxes should be our number one priority."
“Really?” Harry looked up, his emerald eyes still shiny with tears, “I won’t be forced to be with someone I don’t want?”
"Already done," Severus smirked, "Number one is to restore Tom's sanity, two is to clear Sirius's name and bring him back or find another guardian for Hadrian, and Three is to restore the memories of Bellatrix and her husband; there are of course other things we need to accomplish, but those three should suffice for now."
"Yup," Teddy confirmed, "But it has to be as awesome as Uncle Draco's prank."
"You have some explaining to do Severus," the dangerous purr had them both turning to see Voldemort standing in the doorway; "I thought the boy would be healed by now; why is he still injured?"
"You were a rather cute baby," Harry grinned at Draco, "Wonder what happened?"
Even though he now had a plan, Harry wasn’t sure if he should act on it. He spent the day walking through Hogsmeade, and had eventually made his way into the forest, still considering his options. Several times, Harry almost talked himself into going to Grimmauld Place, but then memories of biting Mr. Weasley would surface, shattering his confidence.
“Yes! If you don’t stop teasing me I’ll-” my threat goes unfinished, as suddenly his thick shaft is there, pressing forward insistently, and I am left gasping for breath as my body is forced to accommodate him. It is a feeling I love, all the more so for the expression on his face-and I suddenly find myself unsatisfied with having an invisible lover. “I want to see you,” I demand, “Want to watch as you come undone…make me come undone…”
"Tom Riddle-Voldemort-had a girlfriend," Harry said in disbelief, "He was-he was dating my mum’s cousin! And! He's still not evil!"
“You can’t use your magic right now, Harry; we can’t risk them finding you. I’m sorry for the pain, but if you don’t fight it, then you won’t be hurt.” The familiar voice had Hadrian looking up at the man standing in front of him, his emerald eyes widening in shock as the man lowered his hood.
"Oh yes," Lucius smiled, "I definitely remember my years at Hogwarts; I'll tell you what the Marauder's did to Severus in fifth year-his fourth year-if you promise not to tell him where you heard it from."
“No,” Harry interrupted, “I don’t want to talk about it; it’s hard enough just being here. Can we just get on with it?”
"Good idea," Tom nodded, "Should we use your office Luca?"
And here we have Harry's first sexual encounter with Draco...even if Harry doesn't realize it's him yet. I've never really done the back-and-forth pov's in one scene before, so I hope it turned out alright. Please review and let me know what you think! I'm not sure how long it will be before I add another chapter but, rest assured, more chapters are on the way. Hope you enjoyed!
Harry looked up at the Christmas tree as he was walking past, wonder what kind of topper Draco would choose-they alternated, and this year was Draco's turn-only to come to a sudden stop. There, sitting atop the Christmas tree was small dragon with white scales and a silver-and-blue-striped under-belly. The white tail was wrapped around the top of the tree, and blue eyes sparkled like jewels.
"In the desk," Draco replied, looking at the envelope with narrowed eyes, "Why would Longbottom be writing to you?"
"What about the Potter vaults?" Narcissa asked, "Are you still going to allow Dumbledore to have access to the funds? Even though Harry Potter does not exist, the Potter's did have a daughter, and we have plans to inform Lillian Potter-currently Ginerva Weasley-of her true lineage."
"Fifteen."
“The bet isn’t cancelled unless both participants agree to call it off,” Draco informed him, “And I have no intention of calling off the bet-not when I’m certain I won. Before we compare numbers, however, I want to talk to you about-”
“That will not be necessary,” Dumbledore said after spending a moment studying Severus, “I already know where Harry is, as I was the one who arranged for him to be taken. Ronald Weasley found out from his sister that Harry was going to the ministry and told his father; Arthur informed me, and I had him use a portkey to get Harry away from the Malfoy’s. I did not inform you of the plan because I was unsure of your loyalty, but the fact that you came straight to me shows that you have not returned to your former master. I hope you can forgive me, my boy.”
Albus sighed and shook his head; he would just have to bide his time with Severus, and as for Harry…well, he would show up eventually, and once he did Albus would make sure his pawn could never try to escape again; it was his duty-anything for the Greater Good…
"I'm sure we can manage that," Narcissa smiled, "We will leave at ten; this will give us time to buy the potions ingredients and then stop by the joke shop. Is there anything else we need to do tomorrow?"
“No,” Draco disagreed, “Watching him enjoy decorating the gingerbread house was weird.”
“Thank you,” Harry whispered in return, leaning in to kiss Daphne on the cheek. She giggled again, and he smiled down at her, then looked up to find burning grey eyes watching his every move. Harry couldn’t stop the flush from returning, so he pushed the thoughts out of his mind instead. He’d talk to Sirius over the summer; he had plenty of time to figure out his feelings.
“You’re already up,” Hadrian pointed out, “So just come on already; I was almost asleep until you came barging in here.”
“Don’t remind me,” Harry groaned, putting his face in his hands as he remembered that disastrous night; “I swore I would never ask another girl to any kind of social event, even if refusing to do so meant my death.”
"You'll try," Draco countered, pressing a kiss behind Harry's ear. Harry tilted his head back, and they shared a brief kiss before a sleeping Albus kicked Draco in the back. "Every time," Draco grumbled, breaking the kiss, "And you say the brats don't know what they're doing."
"I wonder what your dad wants," Hadrian mused as he and Draco walked towards Lucius study on the first floor, "and why didn't he say anything at supper?" It was a few days after Augusta Longbottom had been informed of the truth (Lucius and Tom had been surprised to find that Narcissa had won her over so quickly) and Hadrian and Draco had been in their rooms studying-Hadrian studying Mathias' journal and Draco the Parseltongue book Tom had given him for his birthday-when Tippy had appeared to say that Lucius had requested their presence.
"Did you tell her you were mine?" Draco demanded with narrowed eyes.
"I'm sorry," Hadrian figured an apology was the best way to start off, "I know I wasn't supposed to let anyone touch me, and I didn't mean to; she just grabbed my arm and started telling me to dance with her, but I think she was trying to get your attention. I don't like Pansy, and-"
Harry was ashamed to find himself incredibly turned on by the seductive voice whispering in his ear. Whomever was watching him seemed to know what he needed better than Harry himself, and the brunet was having trouble remembering to be mad at the unknown man in front of him. The soft voice-which was vaguely familiar-whispered filthy words, only serving to make Harry harder as the dildo continued to impale him, a half inch at a time.
Harry sat in the sitting room until the moon was high in the sky, his mind running in circles as he wondered what he should do. Finally, when he could barely keep his eyes open, he made his way to the bedroom and changed, before crawling into bed beside Draco; tomorrow was soon enough to worry about what he should do.
“Yeah?”
“I can’t,” Draco said regretfully, putting more distance between them, “Believe me, I would love to take you upstairs, but there are other things we have to discuss before we take that step.” Harry closed his eyes as Draco gently cupped his cheek and pressed a chaste kiss to his lips. “I’m spending the day with Scorpius tomorrow, but we can meet for lunch Sunday?”
But now they leap out of the shadows
Harry had received high marks when practicing both spells, and he now realized that he could use them to his advantage. He spent the following week gathering supplies and finding a safe place to enact his plan. Harry had even snuck out of the school one night and made his way into Muggle London to pick up a few items that he wasn’t sure even existed in the Wizarding world. Now it was late Friday night, and he just had to sneak away from his dorm mates and hope no one came looking for him until morning.
“Of course,” Draco said, “We will be starting with a waltz; I will count out the steps. On one, you move
"Stupid git," Harry muttered, glaring as he sat across from the blonde, "Fine, what do you want to know?" At Malfoy's nod Harry grabbed an apple and poured a cup of tea; he was starving, but his stomach felt somewhat queasy, and his back was beginning to ache.
“It all depends on what you believe, I guess,” Harry told him, “Do you believe that everyone who’s not a Pureblood should be killed? Are you willing to crawl through the dirt and worship a monster to make that happen? Or-”
“I just wanted to speak to you about this evening,” Narcissa said, “This supper is very important, as I am sure you already know.”
“Yeah!” Teddy started bouncing in his seat, “Can we do the tree now, Uncle Harry? You said we had to wait for Uncle Draco to help, but he’s here now, so can we?”
"I promise," Draco said, "So tell me Hades."
"Yes, I think a truce would be good at this point," he agreed, "I know it will be some time before you trust me after our past interactions, but in the meantime shall we begin as allies?" The dour man held out his hand, and Harry didn't hesitate to accept it.
After watching the manor for what felt like hours to his empty stomach, Harry hadn't seen anyone on the grounds and came to the conclusion that no one was home- or, if they were home, they were somewhere within the large manor and unlikely to see him. The large white birds he saw last night were gathered by a pond several yards from the gazebo, and Harry idly thought to himself that they were strange looking turkeys-they seemed to have long, flat tails instead of the fan normally seen on a turkey and they didn't have the beard either. Dismissing it as unimportant, Harry located a branch that was near the fence and allow him easy access to the grounds beyond; he crouched low on the branch and then leapt over the fence, feeling a faint tingle of magic as he crossed the boundary. He crouched behind some topiaries and remained still as he waited to make sure that the wards had not alerted whomever lived here to his presence.
"Just on the other side of the hill," Fred confirmed.
“I found several promising books,” Draco confirmed, “How far did you get with your summer assignments?”
“Hmm, I think we’ll be fine,” Draco countered, “Harry’s still short enough, so we should both fit.”
“I acknowledge that I was probably not the expected choice to fill such a position,” Draco said stiffly, “but I assure you that this is not a joke. Three years ago, after Astoria and I divorced, I
He broke off into a sob and his magic sent an electric shock through Draco, causing him to cry out at the sudden pain; he refused to give up however, and managed to grab both of Harry’s wrists and pin them to the bed with one hand, while he tangled the other in the brunet’s thick locks and yanked hard; Harry let out a cry of pain, but seemed to focus. "Pull you magic in before you kill us all," Draco commanded, then lowered his voice to try and make it more soothing, “Just breathe slowly; in and out...breathe in…breathe out…breathe in…” It seemed to work, as Harry began to calm his breathing. Draco continued to coach him for a few minutes, until the feeling of magic in the room began to diminish. “Good, Harry; now, just draw your magic back into yourself. Can you do that?” Harry nodded, closing his eyes in concentration as he obeyed, the barrier dropping away so that the Dark Lord and Severus could approach; the two men moved away from the wall but hesitated to come closet, seemingly content with letting Draco continue to sooth Harry. Well, Draco didn't mind; he found that he liked being able to calm the other boy.
“And empty out both our vaults to do so,” Hadrian laughed.
Harry’s thoughts followed a similar pattern until he saw the chalice begin to glow, and he felt magic heal the cut on his wrist. Harry kept his gaze on the chalice, and reached out to pick it up the second the glow began to fade; as the submissive for the purposes of The Ritual, Harry was required to complete each action first, as a way to demonstrate his willingness. He tipped the cup and was surprised to find that the liquid inside was warm and sweet, without even a hint of blood in the flavor. He closed his eyes and drank until he felt full to brimming with golden light, and then passed the chalice to Draco. As he did so, Harry caught sight of his own hand and realized that he was actually glowing with golden light; when Draco drank his portion of the mixture, he began to glow with a silver light. When the blond set the chalice down, Harry saw that his eyes were also glowing silver, and he had the brief thought that their glows were probably bright enough to light up the whole clearing.
"Join you in doing what, exactly?" Blaise demanded, "You still haven't told us your plan." Draco growled lowly at Blaise's tone, only relaxing when Hadrian rested his head on the blonde's shoulder and Arden gave a soft, reassuring chirrup.
"Unfortunately," Tom replied, scowling, "Professor Dumbledore told me I was a Muggleborn, but I went to the library and found out my mother was a witch, so I guess my father was a Muggle. They must both dead though, as I was raised in a Muggle orphanage."
“I like the half-day idea,” Draco announced, “I get to make you do whatever I want for twelve hours, and then I’ll do whatever you want for twelve hours.”
"Because he's a Slytherin and he won't be able to help abusing it some," Tom replied before fixing Draco with a glare; "If you cause any harm to my son, you will die.” Draco met that red gaze steadily, and gave a short nod to show his understanding; “Now, I really must retire for a short time, but I will be back later; you boys should get some rest." With that said, Tom swept from the rooms, and a moment later they heard the Floo.
