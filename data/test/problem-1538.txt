Say hi to Lucy from me. Maybe scratch him behind the ear for a bit? I bet he’d like that.
“Two large coffees please, one with a splash of milk and the other—”
Nodding, Draco began documenting the hospital invoice in his ledger.
“Ever heard of this nifty little invention called a key?”
— a secret for long, even if I wanted to.”
Draco buttoned up his tailored, pale-grey dress shirt and reached for his silver cufflinks on the dresser. The party at the reserve was not fancy, but Draco was still Draco, and he had a smashing fashionista reputation to uphold. Pansy would be there, as would some of the more casual friends from the foundation, and he didn’t want to embarrass himself. He pulled on the burgundy velvet suit jacket over the top, straightening the sleeves and fastening only the centre button before he turned to inspect his reflection in the mirror.
“I hate you,” he repeated through clenched teeth, the statement sorely lacking any trace of his earlier venom.
Draco cringed. He’d never used the expression before in his life and it sounded terribly awkward coming out of his mouth. “Anyway,” he drawled after clearing his throat, “your friend seems to think you’re struggling with it; that something”— or rather,
As they approached the office building, Draco was laughing hysterically at Harry acting out story after story of Weasley antics. “So, Charlie was running from gnomes, his hands flailing from the firework,” Harry managed to get out, throwing his arms around in imitation.
“Abbott, what’s he doing in here? Only family should be allowed.”
Harry stared incredulously. “A fox? Whyever would you have a fox in a London flat?” He sounded almost accusatory, making Draco immediately defensive.
want him? Everything he’d said to Pansy was true.
Draco closes his eyes, pulls Harry tight against his chest, and jumps.
As for me, although it pains me to say it, you’re probably right; I could probably get any job I’d want, regardless of how I do on my N.E.W.T.s. But that’s just another part of why I hate this ridiculous fame. I don’t want to get ahead thanks to something like that, and I certainly don’t want someone else to have their dreams go up in smoke just because we wanted to do the same thing and my fame was favoured over their talent or hard-earned N.E.W.T.s scores. I want to earn my place like everyone else, for my knowledge, my skills. How else would I ever be able to keep my self-respect, not to mention gaining any respect or trust from future co-workers or subordinates?
Draco's lips moved from Harry's mouth, following Harry's jawline, leaving a trail of barely-there kisses down his neck. The oral exploration reached fabric much too soon, and Harry stifled a whimper as Draco drew back, his skin already missing the touch. But then Draco pulled Harry's collar aside and stopped to stare at Harry's soul mark.
But then Hermione put me in charge of assembling muggle furniture together with her parents and Dean, and somewhere among all those screws and plugs and patronising cartoon instructions, I lost track of time. So, when the official-looking owl swooped in through the open front door and landed right next to me, I was just as surprised as everyone else. I guess a Saturday Ministry owl would seem rather ominous for most people, so it’s not like I can really blame them for taking notice of the delivery and starting to ask questions. Since I knew it was yours, I pocketed the letter without a second glance, assuring them everything was fine, but some — aka Hermione — refused to let it go, nagging me to open it. ‘It might be important, Harry,’ and, ‘How can you know without reading it?’
Draco considered. Perhaps Charlie had figured it out, in which case, letting Charlie broach the subject first and allowing him to steer the conversation would only be fair, right? If it so happened it’d also save Draco the trouble of having to find the right words, well…  “All right. You go first.”
She looked back at Draco, watching him admire her, and her smile softened from predatory to genuine. “No, sweetheart, I don’t need anything. Only for you to have a lovely evening and that the new year will hopefully bring you someone you can finally be happy with.”
Fleur held out her hand and he readily took it, braving a smile when she gave a gentle squeeze.
Harry testified on Malfoy’s behalf, and as he did, he noticed confusion swirling in those eyes. Confusion, and a slight glimmer of hope breaking through the stormy grey. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to satisfy his conscience that he’d done the right thing, and he left the other boy in the courtroom, ready to go on and live his life.
Definitely not ready.
“So close, Harry. So close. I’m going to…”
"Happy birthday, Harry!"
“I most certainly do…” Harry summoned the last of his resolve and took a step back, holding Draco off with one palm on each shoulder. Draco looked utterly dishevelled, and seeing that he still was in his Santa form, the sight was… truly something else. “Believe me, the moment that bloody potion wears off, I’m going to rip those clothes right off you, no matter where we are at the time.”
“Harry, mate, your snake can’t possibly be that funny, can he?” Seamus asked.
Actually, I did know about Dumbledore’s offer of protection. I was there. And before you say anything, no, I couldn’t intervene, no matter how much I wanted to. I was stuck under my invisibility cloak, mute and immobilised by a freezing charm, powerless to do anything but witness your exchange and the following course of events. At the time, I was furious with Dumbledore for doing it to me, for not letting him help, but then I didn’t learn about his ulterior motive for that night until almost a year later. It wasn’t until I witnessed Snape’s memories on the night of the final battle that I fully understood why he did it. He wanted me to witness your hesitation. He wanted me to know that you never really wanted to go through with your horrendous task, that you had no choice, that he still believed in your ability to change.
Draco groans and his long lashes flutter before Harry’s eyes.
Harry chuckles. “I’m definitely not perfect…”
And if it is, Hermione knows about it too. I’ve caught her shooting daggers at him several times already, ‘surreptitiously’ hinting in my direction as if she's urging him to tell me whatever it is. She thinks I don’t notice it, but I do. And frankly, it’s starting to freak me out a little bit. I’ve tried to come up with ideas for what it could possibly be, but I can’t think of anything, other than it must be something bad — otherwise, he wouldn’t hesitate to tell me, would he? I may just be overthinking it, but one thing I’ve learnt these past few years is that I should trust my gut and right now it’s hard to ignore.
Harry hisses to Orion.
My heart aches, pain searing through my body as I take in the defeat in your hushed tone. You sound so small, so helpless, and all I want to do is take you in my arms and hold you close while telling you everything’s going to be okay. I press my nails into my palms to prevent myself from reaching out.
“You’re not evil,” Harry hastens to say, head suddenly swimming with the mental images of the both of them together under the spray, all naked and wet and— Harry’s cock twitches in the cramped space between them, and it’s all Harry can do not to combust as Draco tightens his grip on Harry’s thigh, hissing quietly.
“Look,” he said, “I just—”
"You're not," Harry said. "We'll figure out what works for us both, but I'm pretty damned sure it's not the Ministry. And I'm honestly not ready, just like I said." He leaned over and gave Draco a soft kiss. "Right now, it's my birthday and I don't really want to think of anything too complicated."
He wrote it over four rows, intending for it to reveal itself gradually as Harry drank his sickly-sweet brew. Then, mustering up his resolve, he took a deep, calming breath and added the final four words, biting back a silly smile as they stared back at him from the bottom of the cup. A swarm of pixies overtook his insides as he filled both cups, veiling his secret message under the black surface, hiding it like a lost pirate treasure just waiting to be found by his boyfriend’s emerald eyes.
. Because Draco was actually standing in his kitchen, with his strong hands resting on Harry’s hips and his uneven exhalations fogging up Harry’s glasses. Because Draco was actually nibbling on Harry’s lips and making the most adorable little noises Harry had ever heard. Because Harry could breathe in the heady scent of him and taste the sweetness of chocolate and marshmallows on his lips with every lick of his tongue.
Looking down at the wedding band on my finger, there’s nothing else for me to do but acknowledge that she was right all along.
good to have you there.”
“You’re awfully tense,” Potter said. “All this sitting around can’t be good for you.”
The conversation veered again, this time revolving around Quidditch, Celestina Warbeck, and quiche. Draco let it all roll over him like waves on a beach, the tips of each conversation tickling his toes as they crashed over him.
They approached the treeline, and the Security Shed finally came into view. “This is it. Did they give you the key?”
into the mix.
More customers followed, keeping him on his toes, and it wasn’t until he sank into the cushions of his couch at the end of the day that he remembered he never got to answering that text. Draco reached for his phone and opened their earlier conversation, staring at the last message for several minutes before finally plucking up the courage to send off a belated reply.
“Mm-hmm. Right. Yes, that’s exactly what we intend; a wand for every student.” She looked at the clock on the wall then turned her chair so Draco could see her. Her short, shiny black hair was tucked behind her ear, accentuating the large hoop earrings and her perfect cheekbones. She smiled at Draco and nodded as she finished her call. “Wonderful. I’ll put you down for four seats at the Wands for Wixen Ball on the eleventh. Thank you, Minister.”
Harry snorted and propped an elbow on the table, his chin on his hand. "Yeah. The kids get along really well with his son. They love going over to the Manor to play and his parents are surprisingly good with them as well." He sifted his free hand through the snapped beans absently.
"Yeah?"
Albus seemed like a good kid, Draco thought. Judging by the all of ten minutes he'd spent with him. A little quiet maybe, but polite and cute as any little boy is at that age. What on earth was the kid doing running around Diagon alone?
Ginny didn’t acknowledge him until he was five feet behind her curled up figure. She was still dressed for England as well even though she’d been missing for three weeks. Her long sleeves, jeans, and trainers were out of place on the beach. They would have been getting looks if the beach wasn’t practically deserted.
“Dinky, would you show Andromeda into the solarium. Tell her I will be there in just a moment.”
"Oh yes, Mr. Potter." Lucius nodded gravely turning his gaze on the seemingly unsuspecting sword as Harry lifted it up himself and stared at it wonderingly. "Oh indeed, yes."
” Stella urged him, her head bobbing in the air excitedly.
She pouted a bit before resigning herself to a small garden party. "Oh, alright, Draco. I won't invite anyone else." Narcissa sipped at her tea and pursed her lips in distaste. "What kind of tea is this, Draco? I've never tasted anything so... flavored."
"I think what scared me the most, Draco," Harry started softly, "was that this feels nothing like it did with Ginny."
She giggled at him and ducked her head bashfully pulling Harry's hand in front of her to hide her reddening face. "Hello, Mr. Malfoy."
"It's a valid concern, Harry," Draco told him honestly, moving obligingly when Harry's arms wound around his waist pulling him closer. "A lot of the old pureblood families still have the same prejudices, and a lot of the Wizarding World still have the same fears. But I do think her mistrust in your judgment was unfounded."
"Perfect." He grinned at her. "Now, what I need you to do when you say the spell is to imagine the red sparks shooting from the end of the wand. Ready?" She nodded. "Good. Remember to say it clearly. Go ahead."
"Salad, tomato bisque, and rosemary roasted chicken breast. I made a strudel for desert, so you better eat some. You know how Hermione complains about the kids' sugar intake." Ron gave his best friend a stern scowl before dipping his finger into the soup pot, sticking it in his mouth, frowning to himself for a moment then snagging a pinch of basil and dropping it in.
"I have no earthly idea," Lucius murmured from next to him sounding a little more poised than he had a moment ago, and much more calm. "That should not have happened."
This was all just too much, Draco decided. He was falling in love with Potters left, right, and center, big and small, and it was obvious his son was there right along with him. The falling was painless, it was the landing that could kill you.
Malfoy poured another cup of tea and pushed it toward him. "He bumped into someone and fell. Nothing a little Scrape Salve couldn't cure. Then I let Scorpius fill him full of sugar and brought him home after I closed up for the day."
"Not, really." Harry smacked an reassuring kiss to his temple. "It was more the 'Voldemort came from Slytherin' thing than anything else."
A snort of made him turn around to see his father watching the chaos out in the gardens with amusement. "Your mother is going to kill the poor house-elves at this rate. When is the boy's birthday? Surely it can't be this afternoon."
She nodded and bounced on the balls of her feet eagerly.
Lucius stepped forward and examined the suit before nodding dismissively. "The original suit of armor worn by the Black Knight. He killed his mother after the ghost of his father revealed that she had murdered him. Then he accompanied his half-brother, the Faerie Knight, on some adventure or another. At least that's what the legend said."
A flash of realization came across her expression and she looked at them again with renewed interest. "Really? How wonderful! I'm Narcissa Malfoy."
"Now that we are all relatively comfortable, why don't you start at the beginning," he suggested not unkindly.
"I think they're more amused than bothered by it." Harry smirked in amusement.
Harry watched them leave with a ten ton weight on his chest. He'd let things get this way, he knew, with his all-consuming work, and his extended overseas assignments. There was no one to blame, but himself. He’d ignored Ginny and he’d ignored his kids.
St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands was beautiful. Snow white sand, crystal clear waters, burning hot sun, and trees so green they’re Technicolor. It was an amazing vacation spot, serene, relaxing, and peaceful. It was embarrassing how long it took Harry to figure it out. After all, Ginny had been begging to get away, just the two of them for the last year. St. Thomas brochures had even been littering their coffee table for months.
Before they stepped into the floo, Molly and Arthur bid them both good night with hugs and handshakes.
Rosie stepped forward with her bushy red hair and a bright grin on her face. "Yes, Mr. Malfoy! Will you have a piñata?" she asked hopefully.
"Are you absolutely insane?" Hermione asked once he was done with his slightly abridged explanation of things.
Everything seemed to be moving smoothly until one afternoon at Grimmauld.
“Why?” Draco asked in concern. “Going to Hogwarts is wonderful. You remember how amazing it was. Why are you worried about him?”
"Malfoy’s got a point, Harry," George chimed in with a shit eating grin on his face as he nibbled on a delicate looking cookie. "Your kids are as stubborn as you are. They won't stop ’til you've gone crazy or bought them their snake."
"It's a gift for your hosts dear," she told him with benign smile.
"Yes," Lucius drawled sardonically. "My grandson, bribing house-elves to lie to me. I'm so very proud."
George shifted uncomfortably. Inventing had been hard for him without his partner in crime. He’d been able to invent a little when Ron had worked with him until he’d left to become an Auror. After that he’d lost some of his enthusiasm and even though he had some ideas he hadn’t been motivated enough to bother trying to get the funds.
"Do you want to look at the journals and books? Or do you want to just pack them up?" he asked as he strode toward the shelves of Black family tomes, nearly twice as many as was in the Potter vault.
Harry stood from his seat and pulled Teddy into a tight hug. "That's wonderful," Harry said mussing up Teddy's bright blue hair. "Read the rest. Let's see what the damage on school supplies will be."
Albus frowned at his friend’s discomfort and scooted closer to him. "What do you mean?"
Now that, Harry thought wryly, sounded exactly like something Lucius Malfoy would do. He could see the old bastard being more of an opportunistic businessman than a true raving fanatic.
Harry let out a sound that was somewhere between a groan and whimper letting his forehead fall forward to land against Draco's chest. "I'm not really sure. I didn't think it was going to be quite that bad, but I figured it wasn't going to be all roses and hearts."
"Teddy!" He opened his soapy arms for the little boy as he came running at him. "How are you, little Moony? Gosh, you're getting so big!" Harry lifted him up into the air and squeezed him tight.
He nodded. "Alright. Sounds good." It surprised him just how good it sounded. It sounded like he was actually going to be doing something. He'd been painfully static since he’d quit the Ministry and Aurors. His idleness had started to rankle.
Harry snorted. "You don't really need to apologize to him. Just send his papers back to him and say the Ministry is under a major internal investigation to make sure this never happens again."
His oldest son awkwardly toed his sneaker at the expensive Persian rug. Harry watched silently unsure what to say. After a long moment of silence, James lifted his head.
Harry felt unpleasantly jarred. He hadn't realized that Dudley didn't know. He'd completely forgotten to mention anything about his divorce to his cousin. "Ginny left, Dudley," he answered, voice flat.
"This is going to sting a little," he cautioned then murmured a handy scrape cleaning spell his mother had used on him as a boy. Albus whimpered a little when the spell swept over his palms, but held still. "Perfect," Draco praised with a smile. It was returned timidly.
had just gone down hill. The people no longer trusted a newspaper that fell to Ministry pressure and Death Eater threats.
"Why are you telling me this?" Harry asked the other man after a long moment of contemplating the growing surreality of his life.
"What I can't believe is that you children are actually spying on your fathers," drawled a darkly amused voice from the other end of the hall.
By all rights they should be sworn enemies and yet they are the complete opposite of what Draco and Harry were when they were kids. Their sons had become best friends in the blink of an eye where Harry and Draco had become dangerously bitter rivals after one conversation.
Sobering from their little teasing, Narcissa reached out and tugged him back toward her with a delicate hand clasping around his. "Be careful, my love." She pulled him down until he gave her a soft, tender kiss on her freshly painted lips. She murmured, "I'll be waiting," and released him.
." Harry just glared at him in return.
They shook hands and Lucius was out of the office and into the lifts before he fully registered what had happened. He'd just spent the last twenty minutes with the Minister of Magic and he wasn't on trial or under suspicion or having his freedom revoked.
"Oh, great," Dudley said, his heart in his voice. "She's just great."
Harry stepped out of the fireplace into his kitchen at Grimmauld Place with Lily on his hip, James and Albus already waiting for him. He looked around at the kitchen and tried not to wrinkle his nose at the smell coming from the food caked dishes stacked in the sink. There was a thin layer of dust covering every surface. It was times like this when he dearly wished he still had a house-elf.
"We have to get them to spend more time together." Lily bounced on her knees eagerly.
That bit explained, they returned to information about Lucius and soon learned about his leading a group of Death Eaters to the Ministry to steal the Prophecy. His subsequent stint in Azkaban, his escape, and then his and his family's denouncement of the Dark Lord during the Final Battle all followed in short order.
Lily jumped into action. Looking down at her belly where Belle had been curled around her waist underneath her dress all afternoon, she hissed the signal. Belle slid down her body to the ground and slithered off. Lily let out a high pitched squeal that made half the people in the Alley jump in surprise.
Stella hurriedly slithered up Teddy's body to rest with her brother around his neck. All the children kept their apprehensive gazes on Mr. Malfoy peering down at them.
With several puzzled goodbyes and hurried steps, the children escaped the study and raced back to Scorpius's room. Lucius was left sitting at his desk very thoroughly diverted.
They sat in silence again, Hermione grasping Draco's hand like a life line, Narcissa comfortingly combing fingers through her hair. Her tears had dried, her sobs quieted, and all that was left was an empty numbness.
"Any language is teachable," Draco added seeing that Harry was lost in some sort of mind maze. "They all have structure and form and rules. Same with Parseltongue. I've never heard of it being done, but our boys are trying." He shrugged, a thinly disguised proud quirk to his lips as he sipped at his tea.
It seemed somewhat incongruous since Grimmauld was the Black ancestral house, but the effect of being inhabited by Potters was undeniable. The place that had once reeked of Dark magic, had felt sickly and twisted just to stand in the foyer. Now it smelled like sugar cookies, and finger paints, and little girl play perfume, and little boy sweat. Now it felt warm and happy and inviting.
Draco smiled down at him where the boy was walking by his side. "All of the old pure-blood families and most of the older half-blood ones as well have they own libraries." It didn't occur to him that they wouldn't necessarily understand about blood purity, but they didn't ask so he didn't feel the need to elaborate.
"The wife is pregnant with their third child, but other than that I don't think there is anything we should watch out for," he replied. "You might want to have Father ward some of the more unorthodox magical items we have in the house, however. The muggles wouldn't know not to touch something that might be cursed or charmed."
Scorpius shrugged. "I guess, but after he and my mother severed their marriage bond he hasn't really liked anyone like that, so..."
Kingsley only stared at him for a moment, an unreadable look on his face before he leaned forward, angry tension pinching at his temples. "I apologize, Mr. Malfoy. It would seem that there is someone in Ministry employ that has taken it upon themselves to make illegal demands of our free citizens. There has been a full inquiry issued and all of your documents will be returned to you as soon as our investigation has been conducted."
"I always said such childish hostility was beneath a Malfoy." Cassiopeia nodded arrogantly.
Harry clapped him on the shoulder and grinned at him. "No problem, Big D. The kids will be happy they'll be going to Hogwarts as well."
"We understand, Harry. It is the right thing to do," Arthur said quietly. "We just hope that you don't think you are unwelcome in our family after this. You are still our son, if you want to be."
"What happened! What happened!" Albus begged leaning heavily on Scorpius to keep from falling over.
"Oh! But I like your hair too, Miss Cissy." Lily turned on her perch and tentatively twirled a lock of Narcissa's hair around one of her own little fingers. "I think yellow hair is really pretty."
Everything about the Potters, even their home was so very different.
Since Fred had died he hadn't thought about expanding. His shop in Diagon was profitable enough, but in the past couple of years there had been several products he’d been putting off developing for lack of expendable income. Now with the possibility of Harry funding the research it wouldn’t hurt to at least discuss their options.
"Hm." She seemed to look down her nose at him, like Lucius had the first few time's they'd met and clashed. "Well, Lucius, a Potter, a Weasley, a mudblood, and a whole gaggle of uncouth little children and their pets. Have the Malfoy standards truly sunk so low?" She spoke casually, but with a malicious curve of her lips.
"Shotzy is sorry, Master Malfoy," he squeaked apprehensively, flicking a quick glance at Scorpius's silently pleading face. "But the floo is being broken until the morning, sir." He cringed, waiting for his punishment.
"I’ve had enough of your attitude, James. If you think you are the only one effected by your mother leaving then you are sorely mistaken. I’m sorry I have not been here for you and your brother and sister,”
They trudged onto the lifts silently. The whispers and murmurs of busybody observers followed them like shadows. Five year-old Lily hung onto her father's hand tightly while seven year-old Albus and nine year-old James followed behind.
"Yeah, love?" Harry asked getting up and walking to his daughter.
That something was a respect and reverence for his ancestors passed down from parent to child.
"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy," George replied, sounding wary in his neon lime green suit and his coordinated fuchsia waistcoat and tie. "Fred had more of a head for it than I do."
A small frown creased at her blond eyebrows before it cleared and that strangely knowing smile appeared on her lips. "There is this wonderful vegan restaurant just off Diagon Alley. They have really good food. Completely Wrackspurt free."
Draco gave a tired chuckle at that and threaded the fingers of one hand into Harry's sweat dampened black hair. "You are amazing, Harry." He sighed, pressing his mouth to Harry’s temple. "I've never felt like that before."
Lifting his head he felt his heart break a little more at the sight of his daughter's auburn hair falling around her flushed tear stained face.
For some reason, Lucius highly doubted that.
Harry chose not to respond to that. His experience with mothers weren't all that great. Molly, and now Narcissa and the rest of the Weasley women were the exception, but he didn't have as much faith in mothers as he probably should. Aunt Petunia and to some extent Ginny had ruined that for him.
” Lily hissed around a yawn. “
"What's your name, handsome?" Draco asked as he ran a hand through the baby fine curls atop his little head.
Just as they were about to clasp hands Scorpius glanced down and gasped. "You're bleeding! Come on, we gotta get my dad to fix it."
Draco pushed himself up and captured Harry's lips in a bruising kiss. "I love your kids, too. I can't imagine our lives without them anymore." He pressed kiss after kiss to Harry's smiling lips. "This is completely insane, Potter. We tried to fucking kill each other and now we're talking about having kids together. The world's gone insane."
"I’m glad I could help you," Narcissa assured her, giving her a gentle smile. "Are you feeling any better?"
"Alright," James agreed decisively. "How do you think we should do this?"
Taking in his lover’s nervous tics and his worried frown, Draco placed a hand on his shoulder and gave him a comforting squeeze. “What’s bothering you? You’re twitching like a potion junky.”
"Ah, finally. Do have a good morning, gentlemen," Lucius called over his shoulder as he stepped off the lift and strolled down the hall leaving a lift filled with gob smacked Ministry employees behind.
Draco looked at the next Weasley and instantly recognized him as the eldest son, the son that Fenrir Greyback had savaged during Draco’s sixth year. There were five scarred slashes across his face, but that did nothing to diminish his handsomeness or, apparently, his friendly smile.
"It is," Harry replied with a nod.
TBC...
"I suppose she would be," Harry said, glancing at Lucius from the corner of his eye. "She was in Ravenclaw at Hogwarts."
Of course, St. Thomas would have been obvious if Harry had spent more than five days straight at home in the last six months.
"I can't believe it's actually working," Teddy confessed bouncing from foot to foot as he leaned over Lily to watch his snake down the hall.
Scanning the letter beginning to end, Harry went back and read it three times before Dudley finally snapped. "Well, what does the bloody thing say?"
Their minds were pleasantly numb in the aftermath of the storm they'd endured.
With a heavy sigh, he wandlessly summoned the unopened bottle of Ogden's Old Firewhiskey from his study and cracked the seal. It was going to be a long night.
Dudley's jaw dropped then he broke into a relieved smile. His kids weren't just weird, they were actually wizards. "That's good. Thanks."
Of course Draco knew that if you really wanted to get the news you read the
The boy met his eyes and nodded. "Yes, sir."
Draco laughed. "I'm sure the martis and other men of the community will forgive you this once for the oversight."
Harry was expecting her to jump in and start arguing back at him, but she didn't. Hermione’s expression turned hard and stiff. She shot to her feet and stalked out of the room without another word.
” She made herself comfortable pressed against his pulse point.
"Why do I know that name, Harry Potter?" she demanded of Lucius after she'd turned her eyes back on the messy haired wizard.
She felt somewhat naughty, but the last time she’d been in Diagon Alley, she’d stopped off in Flourish and Blotts looking for a new novel to read in her spare time. Little did she know that she would stumble upon the latest romance by Nanna LaNou
" she shouted at a confused house-elf on the opposite end of the porch.
Dinner went on comfortably. When it was over and the dishes were cleared, Draco signaled to a house-elf and stood from his seat. "It's time to sing to the birthday boy!"
With gargantuan effort, Harry pried his fingers open and the staff fell to the ground with a clatter, the stone blinking out into darkness.
“Yes,” Andromeda nodded, continuing on. “I- was horrid,” she admitted looking back down at her hands. “I shouldn’t have let my old angers and insecurities take control, but I did. I said some awful things that neither you nor your family deserved. I’m sorry for that.”
Waking up with Draco in his arms had felt scarily good. Continuing to cuddle with him while they flirted with each other had been, in hindsight, positively frightening. He hadn't felt that contented since the early years with Ginny when everything was still new and wonderful and nothing hurt. He hadn't felt that happy in a long time.
Everyone cheered and Teddy turned bright red. Of course, he only stayed that way until the cake came out and he lit up like a Christmas tree. "Oh wow!" He exclaimed and hopped up from his seat to meet the cake on its way toward him.
Harry got a bashful look on his face. “I know. I just love the Manor.” He never thought he would ever say that considering what he went through and witnessed there during the war, but there is was.
Ginny had dropped their children off at the Burrow three weeks ago while Harry had been on assignment with the British Ambassador for Wizardry at a summit in Egypt. She promised to pick them up in a couple of days, but she never came back. Two weeks later Harry portkeyed back to the Ministry then flooed home in exhaustion hoping to finally spend some time with his family. He'd found the house empty with no sign of anyone being there for sometime.
The next morning Harry sat on his marital bed and stared at his open wardrobe. He wondered if he could really stand up, grab his robes, floo to the Burrow to drop his kids off, and apparate to the Ministry to start another day of work.
"Well, hello there." He smiled softly. "You are a very pretty young lady. A bit flushed and snuffly, but lovely nonetheless. Here darling, blow." He produced handkerchief from out of nowhere and held it up to her nose in a practiced move. She gave a great little girl blow and he scrunched his own nose at her in amusement wiping up the rest of the snot from her upper lip before pulling the cloth away
"Well," Scorpius hedged. "We could look in my grandpa's study. He usually keeps all the important stuff about the family in there."
Harry’s face fell a little bit more, a sudden feeling of inadequacy coming over him. Did all Malfoy men have a special talent for making him feel completely stupid?
Albus he stroked a hand along the snake's smooth cool body studying his pale yellow and gray ghostly patterned scales. “
"Please?" she begged as she clasped her hands in front of her chest and leaned around James to gaze up at her father.
Draco was charming, funny, and clever. He could still be snarky and infuriating, but it didn't burn in Harry's gut like it used to. He considered him a friend now. Someone he could talk about things with. He'd even told Draco things that not even Ron and Hermione knew.
Harry shook his head. "He just said it was an invasion of privacy and changed the subject. I think he's not making a stink because he wants to stay as far away from Azkaban as possible."
"They'll need magic stuff to go there though, won't they?" Dudley asked, once again concerned. "We don't have any wizard money. I don't even know where to go to get a wand!"
Albus and James slipped silently out of Teddy's room together. Albus tiptoed back to his room to grab some parchment and a muggle pen, while James crept down the creaky stairs and into the snakes' room. They met back up at the door to Teddy's room and passed each other with serious conspiratorial nods before going their different routes.
Oh, yes. It was right after the war and Lucius had wanted it to appear that his family was trying to be on the up and up. Marrying a respected decidedly neutral pure-blood family seemed like the perfect way to do that. Fat lot of good it did.
"Well, hello to you too." Draco chuckled and tapped Louis on the nose softly with the tip of his finger. "You are such a charmer. I bet you get it all from your daddy, don't you?" He flashed a mischievous wink at Bill who just rolled his eyes at him from where he and everyone else at the table was watching avidly.
Draco nodded and turned, his mother following silently behind him. As they passed Ron, he paused and placed a hand on the redhead’s slumped shoulder.
"It's gone, Ron!" Hermione gasped loud enough for everyone to hear in the silence. "It's gone. I couldn't-... It-..." She sobbed and her words were lost until Ron tried to step forward and touch her, tried to pull her into his arms.
Draco met his gaze with a pointed look. "Albus saved Scorpius from being bitten by an adder."
Dinner went on relatively smoothly after that and soon various people were standing up and helping Molly clear away the plates and empty dishes from the table.
A contented sigh escaped Draco as his eyes slid half closed. "So, you'd want to think about having more kids with me, then?" he pressed as Harry continued to pepper his mouth with little kisses.
The day passed by quickly. Harry and Molly peeled potatoes until their hands were covered in dirt and they had a pile of peels that was nearly as tall as Lily. Soon it was time for dinner and the children ate enough mashed potatoes to feed an army. Harry ate his fair share and chatted with Molly more about the plans for Teddy's birthday party. He tried to ignore the persistent pang he felt every time he thought about having to send the little boy off to Hogwarts in September.
He gave his old school rival a smirk and drawled, "Good evening, Potter. I believe this belongs to you." Malfoy urged a shamefaced Albus out from behind his legs and gave him a light push forward.
Draco blew out a breath and tried to process this information. He'd never liked the littlest Weasley, but he wouldn't have pegged her for the kind of woman that would just give up like that. Then again, isn't that pretty much what his own wife had done if completely voluntarily?
Teddy, James, Albus, and Lily clustered together in a group as they followed Harry away from the Alley floos and into the Alley proper. They tried to look innocent every time their father glanced back at them over his shoulder, but they didn't quite accomplish it, much to Harry's increasing unease.
"Cissa!" Lucius hissed in shock.
Harry shot him a frightened, confused look until Lucius just sighed and rubbed a gloved hand over his face. "The only explanation I can think of is that it’s not a wizard’s staff at all, not made to channel a wizard’s magic, or..." he took a deep breath and turned unfathomable gray eyes on a sweaty, shaky Harry Potter. "Or your power is far greater than you realize and you unwittingly allowed the staff to amplify it."
Really, those articles on the Rotfang Conspiracy were truly fascinating. Total crap, obviously -gum disease, really?-, but they were rather well researched and thought out considering.
"Teddy stays here, with me," he stated in no uncertain terms. "I consider him to be, and he is by law, my son. I think it would be better if he wasn’t there while you work through things. He stays with me."
"Harry!" Ron popped his head into the living room with a smudge of what looked like flour on his cheek and a frilly pink apron tied around his waist. "I thought I heard your brood barreling through here."
The elf whimpered and began slamming his head into the stone repeatedly before pulling himself up and heading toward the foul tempered fowl.
Draco and Scorpius flooed from Grimmauld Place after Teddy, James, and Albus. Both of the youngest Malfoys had nervous pangs in their stomachs, neither of them were feeling all that confident at their anticipated reception.
Blinking in surprise, Harry leaned forward in interest. "What happened?"
Cassiopeia sniffed distastefully. "How very plebeian of him." She turned her eyes back on Harry. "You defeated this Dark Lord, did you?"
Shaking his head, Draco leaned back a bit, loving the warmth of Harry's touch. "Just had a little chat with Granger. She took exception to the alcohol available for our adult guests."
behind the larger newspaper.
Harry looked stunned, confused, but he nodded and stroked a hand over Draco's hair in a rare show of truly intimate public tenderness. "I'll take care of them."
Rolling over and dislodging the sleeping snakes, Teddy curled up facing the window. He remembered what Harry had said about his grandma and grandpa not approving of his dad when his parents got married. Was that true? It must be. Werewolves were feared these days. Before and during the war they were even more so. What had it been like for his parents to get married and have him in the middle of a war?
"I grew three inches," Teddy informed his godfather with a grin that reminded Harry so much of Tonks. "Besides, I think you're shrinking."
," he agreed in perfect french, making Louis's and Fleur's eyes grow big around.
"Good lord. Lucius, you've created another hazard in my gardens! Take those wards off before they hurt themselves!" Narcissa cried in despair as she watched Lily go flying only to land in an elephant ear patch and bounce back up with a wide grin on her pretty face.
Neville and Margaret Shacklebolt were talking plants while Luna tried to convince her rather drunk father that it was a better idea to go skyclad
This was what he needed, Draco realized, just this. He exhaled waveringly before kissing Harry deeply, languidly, offering and begging all at once.
Harry was bombarded with questions and didn't have time to notice Mowgli sneaking away from the party to disappear through the floo again. He answered every question he could about Eclectus Parrots. What they ate, their temperament, their care, and how large they got.
Teddy landed on his back laughing like a loon. "You're it! You're it!" he chanted as he clutched at his stomach and tried to suck in a breath around his giggles.
Lucius has his meeting with the Minister and Narcissa needs to be reined in a bit.
"And Narcissa is amazing, as well. She's so good with Lily and dotes on the boys like she does Scorpius. Lucius isn't bad either, really. He isn't particularly warm to me, but he's patient and indulgent with the children. It's a nightmare," Harry groaned.
"Did you both sleep well?" Narcissa inquired with a serene smile tacked steadily in place.
Chuckling, Draco schooled his face into seriousness and returned the nod. "Of course. Wouldn't taste the same otherwise."
Rolling his eyes, Draco took the box from his mother still looking at it dubiously. "What's in it?" he asked, then a thought occurred to him and he looked at her in horror. "God, please tell me you didn't pack them wine or mead. I told you what hap-"
Leaning back enough to look up into Draco's face, Harry inquired, "So, how much did you hear?"
"Mm. Apparently retirement is quite the job." Draco sounded highly amused himself and reached for the pitcher sitting between them topping off his drink.
"You're very welcome, James." Draco grasped his small hand in his larger one and shook it firmly. "You must come again and visit Lightning. He took quite the liking to you," he told the little boy receiving a smile back before he moved away to go stand with his father.
Narcissa leaned forward giving him a kiss on the cheek then bent down to give Scorpius one as well. "Yes, tomorrow, dear." She smiled then threw in a handful of floo powder in the grate and shouted out "Number 12,Grimmauld Place!" before Draco could protest.
"You're right, there is," Narcissa stated plainly. "Draco and Harry have known each other since school. They hated each other and if I'm not mistaken tried to kill one another a time or two over the course of their education." She smirked elegantly at her mother-in-law's incredulously raised eyebrow.
Standing back to get a better look she placed a hand on her chest as if overwhelmed by the sight of them both and gaze flicking from stunned father to stunned son. "Dear me, you look just like your father. So handsome." Which one of them she was speaking to, Draco didn't know.
"And the kids?" he prompted.
The other kids stared at him in abject horror then looked at each other and vowed never to make Miss Cissy angry. They followed Lucius’s order and dispersed to their rooms to get ready for breakfast.
"That must have been some fall. These are going to need to be cleaned before I can put the healing salve on them, alright?" Draco pulled out his wand and waited for the little boy to nod.
"Of course, Harry. If you need anything don't hesitate to floo," Arthur told him with an understanding smile on his tired face.
"What's that, Harry?" Teddy asked as he neared, his ambers eyes riveted on the covered cage in his godfather's hands.
Draco looked positively stunned. "Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets? He's the heir of Slytherin?"
"You're welcome," he replied automatically, the exchanged happened so fast his hands were still up as if the box was still in them .
Harry heart jumped in his chest when Albus turned to him and said, "It's not that hard. I could probably teach you." Oh God! Oh God! Draco Malfoy knew his kids were Parselmouths!
He wanted all of this, but didn't see it happening anytime soon.
"Well, I'm not sure when exactly he found out, you'll have to ask him that yourself, but I can tell you about when everyone at Hogwarts found out. It's really an interesting story." Draco grinned.
"I want one like it!!"
He was currently most disturbed by the thought of leaving Harry alone to go to attend to his social services, the misserable reality of continuing this life for 3 years- 2 years of social services and 1 more year of living with Harry gnawed at him. He missed his friends, why hadn't they written to him? He didn't want to think about his parents rotting away in azkaban while he chased after Potter like a fool.
In this way he was again reawakened to his situation.
The trees surrounding them were spread out,  open meadows with bushes and wildflowers made up most of their way home, Harry would stop every few minutes insisting that he needed those or that flowers and having secured them would tuck them inside his knapsack.
"I don't wanna play anymore" James bawled and for good measure walked away crying and rubbing his eyes, the other kids followed after him. Draco felt stupid and like a barberian, how had he scared the child so much? beside him he heard a sniff and then another, shit he had forgotten about  Scorpius.
"Good morning Draco" he said with ease, not questioning not faltering.
"Good morning Malfoy" He said, walking towards him carrying a few cherry tomatoes in a bowl.
"He don't listen"
He grinned at Harry, the old Draco would have scowled and pushed and pushed, but he smiled and asked Harry how long he'd waited, Harry said he had walked here so the 30 minute wait was actually recovery period- since he wanted to show Draco around town.
He didn't examine his feelings, he didn't bother to question them, he didn't try to stop it and most certainly- he never thought of if Harry felt the same.
"I'll steal your popsickle if you butcher my name"
HEY! sorry i was late in uploading it, this girl right here tried to finish two months of assignments in two days ಥ‿ಥ
"Yes master Harry and what about master Draco?" He sneakily looked behind Harry to catch a glimpse of him, Harry laughed, "he's in his room, ask him if he needs anything"
"Ok, ok, I won't wake him up" Draco exclaimed, getting out of the room but the house elf continued to pull him away.
Draco realised that Harry grit his teeth while sleeping a habit that shot right at Draco's heart, everything Harry did was adorable and this was no exception.
It was a quaint and beautiful place, somewhat small, Harry took him to his favourite bakery, he showed him the tea shop, the library and ice cream parlour where they each bought a popsickle "Its on me" Harry had said, digging into his knapsack and Draco was greatful because he still hadn't wrapped his head around the muggle money system. the cool treat brought back memories of summer spend with friends, Harry shielded his eyes from the sun with a hand, "its really not letting up" he said, lips wrapped around his popsickle- eyes on the azure sky.
"Is Harry ill?"
Satisfied, he left Harry as he had found him, determining that he would make it through the next couple of hours without Draco's supervision. He shut the door quitely and toyed with his mostly useless wand, it had been restricted to the point that a weaseley's wizarding wheezes wand was more useful. And more entertaining.
Scorpious was apparently overcome with joy at the sight of Draco and insisted on being picked up, Suzan and Draco chatted a bit at the door, he told her that he was taking care of his sick roommate, she again apologised for intruding.
He feels hungry so he digs around the re-figi- freeze- box thing.
"Kreacher!" He called, with a pop the house elf presented himself, "yes master Harry?"
Yes, yes, time must not be lost, however he had no idea how to operate any of the cooking appliances as he had never stepped foot in a kitchen in his life- a-ah well, why else were heating charms invented if not to help idiots cook?
Draco regretted giving it up, and Harry hadn't even bothered to think that Draco was probably tired from work and being extremely pale- was sensitive to the sun, if only he could die temporarily then Pottah would learn his lesson.
Muggles do come up with useful things, he admits and toys around with it- curious.
"Thanks Draco, thats mighty generous of you"
Knowing sleep would alude him, he got out of bed, put on his glasses and suddenly- everything was clearer, the surfaces reflected the moonlight beautifully. He picked up his lavender tea and made his way to the kitchen, intending to dispose of it- when he saw uneaten dishes laid out on the table, one for him, one for Malfoy- neither one had been touched, Malfoys seat was a bit askew, like he had sat down and waited and waited and finally given up and gone to bed.
Draco's social services had begun, although he was as nervous as he had been on his first day of Hogwards, he could not summon the excitement.
Slowly he walked beside his bedside, took in the flushed cheeks and textured skin. His straight nose and pink lips, the scar he had loathed and coveted and he felt a terror grip him so terribly that he almost swooned.
Scorpius gave a little gasp as his eyes grew three sizes. His grandpa was never impressed by anything!
The house-elf bowed and left the room.
Another burst of green flame and Harry soon joined them. Draco led the way out of the floo room and into the Manor proper as they made their way toward the gardens.
Chuckling he stroked a hand over her fiery hair. "You are a charmer, darling. Be sure to keep your dad on his toes, alright?" He grinned at her, his eyes gaining an extra mischievous sparkle when Potter glared at him.
The image of Draco smiling at him and waving through green flames would stay with him as he fell into bed that night.
Harry snorted and folded one arm on the table. "And I'm sure he thought you were Bellatrix, as well. I thought you were the first time I saw you."
Narcissa smiled at the two children she'd yet to be introduced to. "Hello," she greeted kindly.
"You know what, don't tell me." Harry chuckled feeling more amused at that information than he thought he should. "I don't want to know what constitutes 'retirement' for Lucius Malfoy."
"Do you remember me telling you, Draco, that your Aunt Bellatrix and I had a sister that was disowned?" Her gaze went far away for a moment before she turned back to Draco.
"Yes, thank you." Harry felt like his face was turning ten shades of red. "It was very restful."
"Dad, this is Albus," Scorpius introduced with a smile. "He just came into the shop and he skinned his hands."
He knew that his mother never looked at it.
"Couldn't some of the problem lay with men, though?" Draco asked.
"It hurts, so much!" she cried into Narcissa's chest. "Why? Why was it my baby?"
"Aw, but Dad!" a little voice protested from somewhere
As the children said their goodbyes and whispered smugly of their success the adults prepared for departure in a more sedate manner. Lucius and Narcissa bid them farewell then retreated to their separate morning tasks leaving Draco and Harry to stare at one another with carefully schooled expressions trying to conceal their fear and longing.
Narcissa reddened a bit then she scowled. "You hold your tongue, Theodore Remus Lupin. I'm not above bending you over my knee if you deserve it, young man."
"Oh! No!" Harry jumped to reassure. "It's just- It's been a while since I shared a bed with anyone," he said truthfully, but the real reason for his nervousness was not the prospect of sleeping next to someone after so a long sleeping alone. It was that he didn’t know what to do about the way his body thrummed at the prospect of sleeping in the same bed as Draco.
"You don't want us either," Albus murmured so quietly that Harry nearly didn't catch it.
Teddy was turning eleven. Harry approached this revelation as he would approach any double-edged sword; with extreme caution.
"They know about the war, but I haven't told them about your family's part in it. It hadn't really crossed my mind, to tell you the truth. And besides, they know that we hated each other in school anyway," Harry answered defensively.
” she told him as she snuggled against his neck soaking up his body heat. She was pretty big already, longer than his arm span and just a smidgen thicker than his wrist. She was heavy enough that James's shoulders felt the weight.
They held each other’s gaze, communicating more than words could ever say, until Lily's delighted squeal distracted them.
"Good morning, Potter Family," a familiar voice drawled from the doorway. The whole family turned to find Draco and Scorpius watching their entry, one with an amused smirk and the other with an excited smile on their face.
"Dad?"
Albus sobbed in pain and fear. He realized that he didn't have any idea where he was and he looked around frantically for somewhere to hide. To his right he saw a bright storefront with trinkets and shiny things in the window. He darted for it and pushed the door open hurriedly shutting it behind him hard as the bell above it jingled shrilly.
A quick rifling through drawers and a small walk-in closet later, Draco had pulled on a pair of jeans that were just a smidgen big around the waist and a tad long in the leg, and a muggle sweatshirt that smelled like Harry's detergent.
Narcissa nodded. "My elder sister. I was the youngest and the only one not named for the stars."
"Oh, yes!" She stepped forward and stuck her hand out to be shaken. "I remember you, quite well," Luna commented in all seriousness. "You had more Wrackspurts than even Harry, but they seem to have all gone away now." She smiled leaning forward to peer closely at him.
Soon, they were growing weary and if they wanted to make it the Black Heirloom vault that day they were going to have to stop.
Draco laughed, too, and moved away to do just that.
Harry lifted his head and ran shaking fingers through his messy hair. "No, sweetie. I do want you. I love you and your brothers with all my heart," he said painfully truthful, but he could tell that she didn't really believe him.
"The goblin should have a bag suitable," Lucius answered as he moved toward the vault door and began speaking to the waiting goblin in low, cool tones.
"Teddy," she called in what she hoped was a pleasant voice. "Would you come here for a moment?"
His heart gave a squeeze in his chest and Draco leaned forward pulling his son into his arms. "They will love you. And so will Albus's aunts and uncles and grandparents."
"What the hell just happened?"
He glanced over to see James staring at him with a reluctantly curious look on his face. "Yes, James. We have a large stable on the property where we house our horses." The boy's face suddenly lit up with interest, and Draco knew he had him.
Harry watched his expression, his eyes while he spoke. Then he leaned up and captured Draco’s lips in a warm kiss. "I'm glad I testified for you," he declared, their mouths still touching, then he tugged on Draco’s bottom lip with his teeth.
This was moving a little too fast for them. Just a little too fast. Neither of them was ready to discover what this could be.
Harry laughed again tilting his head back down he ran a hand through his perpetually messy hair. "Yeah, you could say they're not taking it well. They're not taking me well, either."
Lucius’s jaw really did drop then. "You have one of the Deathly Hallows?" he rasped, looking like he wanted to faint.
James's mouth fell open. "You're going to blackmail me?!"
An hour later, Harry Potter flooed into the Ministry with Lily sitting reluctantly on one hip, Albus clasping sullenly to his other hand, and James glaring darkly at him from the other side of his brother. Well, they certainly weren't a happy bunch, were they?
"Thank you, Turnby. That will be all," Lucius dismissed as he flipped through the envelopes reading the addresses absently.
Draco felt tears start to well up in his eyes as he remembered, as well. The screaming had been frightening. His Grand-mère had kept him in another wing of the manor, tried to distract him. He'd been scared for his mother and scared for his little brother or sister. It didn't sound like it should have; all that pain.
"Albus and Lily, definitely." They both nodded in complete agreement. Teddy bit his lip debating with himself, then finally reached a decision. "And Scorpius too. He'll be able to get things from his family's side that we wouldn't be able to get."
Snorting, Harry muttered, "Right, nothing catastrophic if you're anyone, but me." Still, he ignored the warnings in the back of his mind and curled his hand around the surprisingly warm wood of the staff, lifting it off the ground.
"Oh tosh." Sipping more of his drink, Draco sounded just a little too nonchalant for the subject matter. "Father has declared himself too old for a young man’s foolish hobbies like genocidal blood prejudice and violent revolution."
Everyone looked at Albus when he shrugged. "Lily said she had something to tell us."
"They don't seem too upset," Harry observed as the boys all began making exaggerated icky faces and pretending to gag good naturedly while Lily smacked them for being "unromantic".
Harry chuckled to himself slightly hysterically as he splashed water on his face and dried it off. Since when had Draco Malfoy become beautiful to him?
They were all quiet for a time, then Albus murmured, "I wonder if they still have their Dark Marks."
They began at one end and worked their way around like they had before. Harry didn't pause very long until he came upon a coal black suit of armor, the Black crest emblazoned up on the shield and the hilt of the sword.
Harry shrugged. "It could have been, or he could just be a good fighter. I went to school with a pure-blood wizard who hadn't shown any signs of magic until his uncle accidentally dropped him out of a window and he ended up bouncing all the way down the lane. He was dreadful at magic all the way through school, partly from his own lack of confidence and partly because he wasn't using a wand suited to him. Now, he's one of the most talented wizards I know as well as a war hero." He neglected to tell them that Neville also could have been the Wizarding World's Chosen One. They didn't need to know that.
Sighing, he dropped his toothbrush next to the Slytherin green one in the sterling silver cup next to the sink. He knew this was going to be a hell of a lot harder than it sounded.
Then again, maybe he was thinking about kids now because he suddenly found himself surrounded by ones he wanted to keep forever. He contemplated that as the boys' laughter continued to ring out from the garden.
"Finances," Lucius repeated blankly. They stared at one another for a moment before he dropped his hands to the armrests and leaned forward. "Mr. Potter, I assure you that every single bronze knut of the Malfoy fortune, every single acre of Malfoy property as been reviewed with a fine toothed comb by the Ministry and has been found perfectly legal."
Harry gave a slightly relieved chuckle. If she wasn't yelling at him yet then she wasn't going to. "Dunno, really. I never really thought about until now." He shrugged, eyes wandering over to watch the children's games just for something to look at other than Molly’s still stunned expression.
WITCHCRAFT
Harry didn’t buy fresh tea leaves by the pound or have house-elves bake tea cakes every morning, but he had a half empty box of chocolate-chip cookies and fruity flavored tea bags.
Everybody knew that stuff though. Grandma-Molly had told them the stories about Harry and Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione while they were in school. A lot of the really bad stuff, a lot of the stuff about the Death Eaters and what it was like during the war was never talked about, though.
. "Who is this young man, Harry?"
She just continued to smile at him and turned to stride for the door. "Well, we should probably floo now. We wouldn't want to miss the wheat-grass special. It's my favorite."
"Yes," Margaret agreed pleasantly. "It's very beautiful. I've never seen gardens like these before. How ever did you find all of these exotic plants?" Her dark eyes sparkled as she looked at the garden only to light up like the sun without warning.  She rushed away from them to kneel just at the edge of wards around the Rapier Roses.
"Too right I am," Dudley huffed sounding amazingly like Uncle Vernon for a moment. "Fucking birds’er like’ta peck your bleeding eyes out."
She stopped and stared at him for a moment before another smile broke over her face and she grabbed him up in a hug once again. "You are just the sweetest thing, but please, dear, just call me Grandma-Molly."
are like.
It was highly amusing to see the old bastard's eyes grow to the size of saucers.
Draco and Harry greeted each other each day with increasingly familiar kisses and parted with the same, but didn't go much farther beyond that. They resolved to continue moving slowly, but neither of them really minded.
They traded a quick kiss before they went off on their separate ways. Harry to round up the kids and Draco to finish the last bit of preparations and make sure their parents didn't get in too much trouble.
Harry just nodded. "I guess. I haven't really checked. They opened a separate vault in my name and have been dumping my share in there since the store opened. George asked me if I wanted to buy out half of Fred's share so we could split the profits fifty-fifty, but I didn't want to." He frowned and ran a hand through his hair. "George should have it, you know."
Draco was reeling and he didn't really know what to do. He felt the urge to chase after his son and the small measure of protection Scorpius offered as he followed Mrs. Weasley outside. The other Weasleys wouldn't be unkind to him if Scorpius was standing with him, but the rise of his panicked thought abruptly left him when he felt a warm hand press to his lower back.
Draco finds out that meeting the family is a lot more nerve wracking when you actually care about making a good impression.
Scorpius heaved a long suffering sigh and turned to his new friend. "Goodnight Albus. I had fun today."
Suddenly jolted from her thoughts, Narcissa snapped her gaze away from the child turning her light blue eyes on her son. "Do you know what Teddy's mother's name was?"
"Kingsley," he greeted curtly pushing the door open without knocking.
Harry’d always hated greed and elitist attitudes and people who had more money then they could ever think to use, but now that he was older he could see beyond the snobby arrogance that generally infected the rich and powerful. He could see the benefit and appeal of having those types of assets; money and property and influence in society.
Finally, they reached the wall filled with books and Harry just stared at it totally baffled with the idea of even choosing where to start. "What do you suppose is in them?" he asked lamely.
"Nope! It's bedtime. Say goodnight to Albus and get your butt down here," Draco shouted back like a truly practiced parent. Harry raised an eyebrow. Who would have though that Malfoy would make such an -accomplished- father? Or would ever actually have kids?
"Vault two hundred and twelve, the Black Heirloom vault," the goblin announced boredly. "I will await you both here. I have another bag should you require it."
Opening his mouth to protest indignantly, he was stilled when Harry squeezed his knee under the table. "That means she likes you," Harry whispered into his ear. "If she wants to feed you, she likes you."
It was a good thing he hadn't immediately panicked. No, he apparated into the Burrow at two in the morning shouting for Molly and Arthur in a fit of near hysteria thinking his wife and kids had been kidnapped. He was high profile in the ministry and still had enemies even though the war had ended a decade ago.
"I don't know where I went wrong with that girl," she continued ignoring the protesting sound from Arthur sitting at the table behind them. "But there is no excuse for what she did. Even if she was unhappy, she could have come to me, to us if she felt she couldn't talk to you."
Flicking a glance at a suddenly anxious looking Harry, Ron just smiled down at the boy. "Yeah, he thinks you’re something special," he told him causing Scorpius to flush happily.
Nodding in agreement, Draco twined his fingers with Harry's and they walked together out to the garden.
"Oh!" Her face lit up in understanding. "Like when you have to make a Bogart go away?"
Harry stared blankly for a long moment, his mind sluggishly turning that information over and over trying to make sense of it.
"You're staying, aren't you?" he asked softly so his voice wouldn't carry to the sleeping children in their beds.
"So, Draco," Arthur began before swallowing a mouthful of ham. "What is it that you do?"
Lucius took a deep breath and tried to calm himself before he yelled at that imbecile Potter for being so horribly blasé and so God awfully lucky.
Half an hour later, Harry had his floo illegally hooked to Dudley's and after repeated reminders to say the address clearly, Dudley, Eddy, Chrissy, and a just visibly pregnant Marianne all stumbled through his floo.
“No, of course not,” Narcissa agreed, rolling her eyes in commiseration. “They always have to ask us, their wives, first. You know, I’m quite sure Lucius would never be able to get dressed in the morning if I didn’t find all his little missing items for him.”
"Of course it takes a bit of practice to levitate things, though it seems pretty simple." He beamed at their awed little faces. "I want to see if each of you can do a bit of simple magic like that."
His children on the mend, with a stumble here and there, Harry decided it was time to start looking to the future. He just never thought he’d be deferring to Lucius’s expert opinion.
Albus stared at the handkerchief warily for a moment before he took it and blew his nose. Cleaning up his face he sniffled one last time and offered the handkerchief back to the blond boy.
"Oh! Yes, Master," Shotzy whimpered and scrambled up into the chimney quickly disappearing from view.
Lucius stiffened. "Yes, he was, Mother. However, he turned from a revolutionary to a narcissistic sadistic mass murderer rather quickly after his second rise to power."
Neither of them noticed the kids shooting victorious looks at one another.
The little boy got to his feet and reluctantly stepped up to her. She softened the slightest bit and leaned down so that he could reach her cheek. "Hello, Grand-mère," he greeted politely.
Harry shrugged again, pinking in the cheeks a little. "The Hat said I would do well there," he explained, "said that 'Slytherin would help me on my way to greatness'."
And of course they had to have the five smartest most inquisitive children known to man. He snorted at himself as he started up the shower and hopped in when it hit the perfect temperature.
"Good afternoon, Molly, Arthur." He smiled letting Mrs. Weasley hug him and shaking Mr. Weasley's hand. "I'm sorry my parents weren't able to be here to greet you, but Mother went a little overboard earlier this afternoon and Father was forced to intervene for everyone's sanity." Draco chuckled at the memory. "They should be down in just a few minutes, though."
Ron and Hermione had been over several times with Rose and Hugo. The presence of their cousins served as a much needed distraction and the kids always seemed better for it. Harry on the other hand wasn’t much helped by the sympathetic glances as Ron and Hermione tried not to mention Ginny.
"That's right, my dear," Narcissa agreed softly, drawing Hermione's attention as she tucking a wild lock hair behind the younger woman’s ear. "We're just glad we were able to help you. You just needed someone to talk to. Someone that knew what you were going through."
"No," Ron breathed numbly. "I had no idea. I-... She didn't tell me. I should have... I should have known," he stumbled through, voice breaking.
"Really?" she gasped in excitement.
Letting some the tension drain from him, Draco finally returned his smile. "Well, in that case, then, yes. I do have an interested in dragons. I have always been fascinated with dragons of every kind. As a child it was only natural considering which constellation my mother named me after," he responded in a much friendlier tone.
Almost immediately the little boy began babbling at him in an odd mix of imperfect French and childishly pronounced english. Much to Harry's amazement and amusement, Draco seemed to follow every single word coming out of Louis's mouth, answering promptly and appropriately in fluent french.
Turning to regard his father warily, Draco nodded. "I told you that Harry was inviting his muggle cousin and his family. Besides the children are wizards. They're in the Hogwarts book."
He grinned and launched into all the ideas he had and the goals he wanted to accomplish.
They watched their son and grandson disappear in a whoosh of green flame then Lucius turned to his wife with a disapproving frown. "Did you really have to send them a gift?"
Teddy smiled widely at the little blond boy. "Hi, Scorpius. Albus told me a lot about you."
Fear for his friend spurred him on and Albus lunged forward and began hissing frantically. “
He’d felt it first at Hogwarts. The deep pride the castle held in its students and professors. The heartbreaking sadness after the Final Battle had battered its walls.
Teddy snatched one of the ginger cookies off the plate on the table and brandished in the air in a distraction. "These are really good cookies, Draco. Sorry, we ate most of them."
Draco sighed and laid his arms around Harry's shoulders comfortingly. "I know, Harry, and I'm sure she knows that too. Being disowned and estranged from your family instills a certain lingering hurt and distrust that is hard to look past. I'm not surprised Andromeda's assuming the worst of us considering. Give her some time, okay?"
"Yeah. That's why George knew before you." Harry averted his eyes so he wouldn't have to see the look on Ron's face when he told him this next bit. "I'm part owner in Weasley Wizard Wheezes and Lucius thought it would be a good idea to talk to George about his plan for the business so I could reinvest and help him out if he needed it."
Narcissa turned from the group sitting at her feet and spotted the two men standing by the doorway.
"Oh. Well." She struggled for something tactful to say then finally gave up. "Have you always liked men as well, then?"
In a way, the building reflected its occupants. The Manor had never quit, never been beaten into submission, just like the Malfoys. They’d made bad decisions, been punished for them, suffered for them, and still they had survived and were better for it.
They lapsed into silence again until the drinks appeared on the table between them.
“Regardless, we have done nothing wrong and if they are still not satisfied then we will cope,” Lucius concluded.
Finally, Draco bit into his duck and turned to Audrey. "I understand that you work at the Ministry as well. What do you do there?" he inquired politely.
The little boy paused in his bouncing and the crowd quieted in anticipation.
"Look, Dad!" he yelled toward Harry. "It's a chameleon, just like me!" Teddy jumped up and down excitedly, his hair changing colors along with his cake.
There were several gasps from the gathering children and adults as everyone stared raptly at the bird and Teddy. "She's amazing," the little boy murmured in awe as he lifted a hand and stroked it down her back gently.
The kids were called in and forced to wash their hands like the good little children they rarely acted like, then they all sat down in the kitchen for dinner.
"Albus!" Harry shouted after his youngest son, but couldn't bring himself to chase after him. He sighed and buried his head in his hands.
Nobody else at the table noticed their silent communication, save for Lucius. He had spent a good portion of his life noticing what other people didn't as a matter of survival. It wasn’t hard to decipher the silent conversation going on between Potter and his son.
A soft smile played at his lips as he poured some in his palm and began massaging it into his scalp.
Lucius rolled his eyes. "Is everything to your satisfaction, Mr. Potter?"
"Of course they'll like you." Draco gave him a reassuring smile.
The little girl looked at her brother with sad eyes, but nodded solemnly.
"Hasn't he?" Harry drawled in amusement. "Weren't you just telling me that he'd been getting into fights with kids older than him, twice his size and winning every time?"
Of course, then the kids got sidetracked when Albus was forced to look up exactly what the Imperious curse was and how Lucius got let off by claiming he was subjected to it.
Cassiopeia de Vil Malfoy sipped her tea in the Manor's solarium and looked around distastefully. She truly did dislike her daughter-in-law.
Narcissa had to grit her teeth. "Quite the contrary," she simpered back. "Harry loves having Draco and Scorpius over at Grimmauld Place."
After Scorpius had been born, Draco realized just how much he loved children, which was a surprise as much to himself as it was to anybody. Who would have thought that Draco Malfoy was really rather paternal? And maternal as well, coincidentally, considering Astoria's atrocious lack thereof. Regardless, he'd wanted more children to love and Scorpius to grow up with.
"Yes, well, I suppose there is that," the older man conceded with a wry smirk. "All three of them do have rather striking resemblances to the Potter line."
Shaking his head, Harry turned back to his lover with a consternated frown. "You really need to get those damn things out of there."
Draco turned and frowned in confusion. "Yes. Didn't Harry explain that the Manor was located in Wiltshire? I thought you knew where you would be coming to."
Shotzy almost wet himself with relief. The children were busy shooting badly hidden grins at each other. Harry and Draco seemed oblivious to it all just concerned about the malfunctioning floo.
"Yeah." Harry smiled at him almost warmly. "You'd know the most and be the best capable of spotting anything irredeemably Dark. I trust you."
Draco eyed him closely for a long moment before nodding tentatively. "I'd like that," he finally murmured, his stomach giving an uncomfortable little loop of anticipation.
Draco knelt in front of his son buttoning up his nice causal set of dress robes with shaking hands. Butterflies were holding a riot in his belly and his palms were sweating the likes of which he'd not experienced since his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts.
"It's alright, mate." Ron waved him off and took a large gulp of his drink that went down square. "I'm just a little surprised and pissed that you're just now telling me all this."
"Oh Fritz! What are you doing down there? Hurry and go round up the peacocks. They're making a terrible mess of my Azaleas!" Narcissa instructed the house-elf from the other side of the patio.
"He's right, Dad," James said earnestly, apparently he’d made himself their unofficial snake spokesperson. "You're just going to have to give into to our irresistible cuteness." On cue all four of his children, Teddy included, turned the worst puppy dog faces on him that he'd ever seen.
James shivered. "I wonder how he didn't go insane. I heard if you stay around Dementors long enough you go completely crazy."
"No!" she snapped, stepping away from him and wrapping her arms around her body. "It died, Ron, and it was my fault!" She pounded painfully on her chest with one shaking hand. "How can you even stand to look at me? Our baby is gone and it was my fault," she trailed off into a whisper, her bloodshot brown eyes streaming with tears.
The house-elf fidgeted nervously before answering, "That is being the doorbell, sir."
Marianne looked a little taken aback by having to actually speak to one of the creatures, but was soon asking a few questions about their magic and how they lived. The answers she received seemed to satisfy her.
Narcissa was forced to avert her eyes to keep from rolling them. Honestly, why does Lucius desert her with his devil-woman mother every time the harpy visits? She was going to have to have a little chat with her husband once she finds him.
They facing one another, but not daring to look each other in eye. The silence stretched.
"Yeah." Harry frowned and nodded before folding the letter and handing it back to Teddy. "I'm going to ask her to make an exception for the snakes. I don't think Ruby will be a problem though."
Turning his head, he gave Harry a shaky smile.
Glancing over to see who had popped in, Draco had a fleeting thought that this might become awkward since next to no one even knew he and Harry were friends much less anything more, then his mind went blank in shock. He had a flash of instinct to draw his wand, but he ended up dropping his mixing bowl with a loud crash instead.
were almost in Slytherin?" Draco stared at him in disbelief.
She scowled at him for it knowing exactly what he was doing, but nodded in defeat anyway. "Fine, you little devil. You can stay."
Harry rolled his eyes. Edward, or Eddy, was surprisingly like his father, in some ways. Although, thankfully, he took after his mother in the looks department. "And Chrissy?"
Harry watched in mild fascination. Ron had taken to cooking dinner since he mainly worked as a consultant for the Aurors now and often got home before his wife. Consequently, he'd discovered that he was a literal genius in the kitchen. Which was surprising considering just how horrid he'd been at Potions.
"Don't apologize, Harry. The more the merrier." Waving it off, Draco looked back to the little boy still eerily wearing Malfoy features. He grinned wryly. "Welcome to my home, Teddy. You may call me, Draco. This is my son, Scorpius." He placed a hand on top of his son's head.
She lifted and looked him in the eye, expression surprised for a snake. “
before me?"
“Of course, many more also hate me because I was a Death Eater and, at one point, one of Voldemort's best." He looked at Teddy then. "I'm sure your grandmother hates me for all of these things."
Breath caught in Harry's throat and something in his gut stirred as he examined his precarious position. He had one arm wrapped around Draco's back holding him in place, the other arm laying over Draco's that was draped over Harry's chest. It felt amazing and comfortable and right. Everywhere their skin touched, Harry felt his body humming like electricity just below the surface.
"Good." Scorpius grinned at Albus then glanced at the door where James and Teddy were keeping a lookout. "How are we doing?" he called to them.
An intrigued smirk twisted at the woman’s full lips. “How did they manage that?” she asked sounding much too amused for Lucius’s liking.
Draco never thought he would relish sipping tea brewed from a box of tea bags out of an over sized mug with an obese cat painted on it, but it had become one of his favorite things in the day.
Harry just grinned innocently at him. "It would mean a lot to me, Draco. They're my family, have been since I started at Hogwarts, and I want them to meet you both." His grin softened and he reached over to grab Draco's hand on top of the table. "You're both very important to me and I want them to know that."
Harry just gave him a small grin.
"Oh." Molly looked a little taken aback, but quickly recovered. "That sounds lovely, dear, but don't you think that -um- Lucius and Narcissa would mind?"
The rest of their afternoon tea was unmemorable and rather bland. Narcissa was thankful for this to the edge of her sanity. Cassiopeia was a trying woman. She'd nearly been a deal breaker when Narcissa and Lucius had been engaged.
Harry just stared at the page for a moment before he turned stunned green eyes on him. "Ignotus Peverell. This is one of his journals." He gestured uselessly to the book in his hands.
"Hm. Yes, so we are." Lucius chuckled in amusement and a little bit of resignation. Not so long ago he would have despaired at being related to Potters and Weasleys. But, perhaps these Potter-Weasley offspring were not so bad.
Laughing, Harry grasped Draco's face in both hands and pulled him in for a deeper, scorching kiss.
She smiled sadly at him and tugged his fingers away stroking her hand through his hair. "Don’t beat yourself up, Harry. She was weak and it was her decision to keep quiet. That’s on her."
"Oh yes, Harry," Marianne breathed, one hand wrapped around her belly and one pressed to her chest. "That would be amazing."
Scorpius cringed at that and looked away. "Yeah, I know more than you know," he admitted, not sounding particularly happy about it.
An image of Mrs. Black's portrait and the house-elf heads came to mind. Harry had to admit it was a valid argument.
It wasn't really alright, but Draco let it drop anyway.
“Of course it is!” Draco gasped, sounding scandalized. “It’s the beginning of their journey into adulthood. The they are finally able to attend school. Of course it’s important. When I turned eleven, Father gave me my horse, Lightning, and Mother gave me my eagle owl.”
After Ron and Hermione had flooed home carrying two exhausted and tomato stained children, Harry spent the rest of the evening scrubbing his own little heathens clean and putting them to bed.
"Scorpius, your grandfather is kind of scary," Teddy murmured, as he ran a soothing hand over his agitated snakes.
"Hey, are you okay?" a voice asked from behind him.
Draco turned around giving Andromeda his back and flashed Harry a stiff smile. "Of course, I just got a bit of a shock and dropped the mixing bowl," he answered. "I'm going to check on the kids. The timer should go off in twenty minutes, pull the cookies out, and don't forget to turn off the oven," he threw over his shoulder as he brushed past Harry and disappeared outside.
"Sure." Draco slowly pulled away, missing the feeling of closeness already. It wasn’t important at the moment, but he promised himself he'd take a closer look into his suspicions later. Right then they were about to walk into a room full of five sugar crazed children. He was going to need all of his concentration for the situation.
"And how, my dear, have you come to this conclusion?" he asked.
Rolling his own eyes, Harry propped his arm on his armrest and set his chin in the palm of his hand. "The kids don't like to stay at the Burrow for very long without me and I don't feel comfortable leaving them here without me or Draco to help them incase they get anxious."
A mirthless, hoarse laugh was forced from Harry's lungs before he could stop it. "God. You heard about that?"
Harry nodded. "He opened the Chamber of Secrets during the Final Battle using Parseltongue."
His hands dropped away and looked out of the kitchen window again just watching his children sadly. "I've already filed for a severing," he stated startlingly unemotional considering his wife's parents were in the kitchen with him. "I set up a small vault at Gringotts for her to use. I don’t want the mother of my children to starve."
” Lily asked curiously as she rubbed her cheek against the silky fabric of Draco's button-up shirt.
"Oh, you mean besides returning your missing son?" Draco asked sarcastically, pouring himself a cup of tea from the service his house-elf had levitated to the table.
"I'm also going to need the rest of your financial information, Mr. Potter, so that I may begin to outline a long term plan for your expansion and diversification. Do you have any other requests for investments I should look into or prospects to stay away from?"
Ugh! It was all too much. Teddy sniffled, his eyes starting to burn. He wiped at them furiously with the back of his hand. It felt like he didn't know anything anymore. It was frustrating and it hurt to realized that there were things about his family that his grandmother and Harry hadn't told him.
"Belle said she tasted it," Lily supplied helpfully.
"Enough stalling, Harry. Tell me how you all have been now that Ginevra is no longer in your lives," she ordered sternly.
Well, he thought to himself, Luna always seemed to know what she was doing. It only occurred to him after returning to his study that there might be another problem. Malfoy Manor was unplottable and the only ones with floo access outside of the Malfoys were the Ministry Aurors and his family.
Harry couldn't help himself, he grinned. This was going to be fun.
The moment the treasure was out of sight, Harry sucked in a huge breath of air and took a shaky step back. "What was that?"
” he called as the snake slithered back into the undergrowth.
The kids blinked up in confusion then looked around to see curious and frightened stares directed at them. Lily inched toward her father one hand pressed over her snake. The boys quieted down and kept in a close group behind Harry the rest of the way through the Alley.
Then Harry noticed the little blond boy standing on the other side of Malfoy staring at him with something akin to awe.
Lucius shot her an annoyed look before turning and grumbling all the way into the closet and back out again with his good dress boots in hand. They continued to dress, Lucius quite hurriedly and Narcissa calm and poised as always.
As they deepened the kiss, Draco was about to pull back and suggest they save it for later when a previously murmured argument turned loud drawing everyone's attention.
Harry thought about how to answer her. He knew he should talk about it with someone and he knew that he could trust Molly to be honest. She’d also never had a problem setting him to rights if he was being stupid. The only thing he worried about when confiding in Molly was how she would react to the mention of Draco Malfoy. She wasn’t exactly known for her mild reactions to shock.
A snort escaped before Draco could stop it. "No wonder you two had an argument. You know how much Father hates that magazine."
They stayed in awkward quiet for several moments before Narcissa finally turned to look at her sister head on. “I have gotten to know your grandson, Teddy,” she said with a genuine, if small, smile. “He is a lovely boy. So very sweet and –hm- quite precocious as well.”
” the snake hissed into Lily's ear.
"Lily, your face is just too pretty to hide," he declared slipping his hands underneath her arms lifting her away from the relative safety of her father and gave her a little toss in the air.
” she cut in eagerly. James hissed in the affirmative. She gave a snaky chuckle and curled a little tighter around him. “
"Eight and four."
"We should help get them together," Scorpius explained looking from one of his friends to the other. "Dad and Harry are happy together, right? And I like Harry and you guys like my dad. I want to be in a family with you all. I think it would be awesome."
Belle ceased her angry hissing and studied her small companion and the silver dragon she was curled up against. “
"A fairy light, yes." Draco nodded stepped up to her. "They are very useful, but a bit ill tempered if you try to touch, so I would suggest not attempting it."
The little boy clapped a hand over his mouth to stifle his laughter before he slid from his chair and padded over to the head of the table. He expertly lifted Tal from Lucius's lap and hissed something to the snake.
After hugging, kissing, and ushering all the kids out toward the gardens, Draco straightened up to welcome the adults.
at home rather than in the Malfoy gardens.
Scorpius glanced at Albus with a shy hopeful smile. "Really?"
Draco felt a pang, echoes of memory begging his parents for brothers and sisters reminded him of his bitter disappointment at Astoria's apathy toward their son.
"Please, Mistress Malfoy! Let me announce you!" a house-elf squeaked frantically as he ran after the woman marching toward the breakfast room.
Cursing, he grumbled about forgetting things and pulled his wand out. With a wave a stick of wax and his seal popped into existence on the table in front of him making Dudley jump in surprise.
The little girl nodded and she stepped forward shyly. Harry crouched down to her eye level and gave her a reassuring smile. "Okay, Chrissy. Would you like to try for red sparks or green sparks?"
Draco elbowed Harry in the ribs gently. "Hey, Potter."
"I beg your pardon?" The man looked like he was trying to decided whether he was more insulted or confused. By the tone of his voice, Harry guessed he chose insulted.
They sat in silence for a moment before Harry stated he had better get back to the kids. He'd left them alone at Grimmauld because they nearly tore him apart when he suggested leaving them at the Burrow while he was gone. He really needed to work on that with them.
Lucius pulled out a solid gold featherless quill that resembled a muggle fountain pen and a sheet of heavy glossy parchment.  He began dictating the terms of their agreement while the quill jotted everything down without missing a word. It made Harry distinctly nervous given his history with Quick Quotes Quills.
"Oh, no, that's alright," Harry stammered. "I can apparate everyone home. There's really no reason to go to all that trouble."
Lucius scoffed rather ungentlemanly. "Yes, I heard about what she did. Threw away three children and perhaps the most powerful wizard, magically and politically, in a century in a fit of nerves and ran off to some God forsaken island in the West Indies.” He sneered keeping his voice level so as not to draw attention. “That girl never did use an ounce of sense God gave her."
Mind stunned blank with the surprisingly lack of hostility, Draco took his hand and shook on reflex. "Good of you all to welcome us," he said, sounding slightly dazed.
"We hadn't spoken in ten years,” he rushed to explain. “Then when Albus ran away that one day after Ginny left, he hid out in Draco's shop in the Alley until Draco was able to bring him home. We got to talking and,” he shrugged helplessly, “after that we just kinda kept seeing each other."
"Sure, Dad!" the boy chirped and yanked Albus off the stool pulling him toward the back.  "My Grandmama makes the best sugar cookies!" he exclaimed. Draco chuckled quietly as he watched Scorpius drag Potter's son along behind him.
Harry stepped up and smiled disarmingly at them. "Here, watch," he said before he summoned Fritz up to them. "Would you bring us a glass of pumpkin juice and a glass of firewhisky on the rocks?" He glanced back over at his very pregnant cousin then added. "A chair as well, please."
"Harry Potter's children," she started after consuming a cookie, "have been claimed by Draco." She looked her daughter-in-law in the eyes. "Do tell."
Lucius just smirked wryly. "Yes. He was a gift for Draco before he started Hogwarts. I believe the beast's original name was Ginger Snap."
Before she could protest, he was up from his seat and swinging the kitchen door open.
Cassiopeia sneered at her. "It was my home before it was yours, my dear. Remember that." She turned her eyes back on the room at large and smoothed her twisted expression. "Who are your guests, Lucius?" she demanded.
Groaning with hunger and stiffness, Draco rolled onto his back and stretched. He ached amazingly pleasantly. His lower back and thighs ached the worst, but he didn't mind. It reminded him of the amazing things Harry did to cause that ache.
"The kids are still afraid of Mum and Dad's," Ron stated knowingly.
The floo flared up and he looked up to see Andromeda and Teddy step into his kitchen.
His breath caught in his throat and Draco grinned. "That's magnificent," he whispered, making the whole kitchen full of house-elves puff up their chests and preen. "Teddy will love it."
Narcissa sighed in motherly exasperation, but smiled at the display all the same. Draco was really a natural with children. It amazed her. When he was a child he could be so ill tempered and demanding, but he had grown into a wonderful young man that put the ones he loved ahead of himself first and foremost.
Lily's snake, Belle, he was informed by his daughter, was a flirtatious thing. She was the equivalent to a girly girl in the reptilian world. Snake-ish giggling and cooing aside, Harry surmised that if you pissed her off, she'd get you when you least expected it.
"Not really," he replied. "I have some ideas, but I haven't spent much time trying to shuffle money around to fund the research and development."
"Did Mum really run away ’cause she wanted ‘tropical drinks, beaches, and boys’?" Lily inquired innocently drawing a few scandalized looks from the two old biddies at the next table.
Harry’s heart gave a lurch. He’d never heard her voice sound that desolate.
Harry had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing. This did not sound like the type of place that Lucius Malfoy would ever be caught dead in.
Grinning, Draco leaned forward and grasped Harry’s shoulder in a half embrace of farewell. The scent of sunshine and herbal shampoo floated up to Harry's nose and he had to shake his head to clear it.
, now. I believe Mr. Lovegood spends most of his time searching for their -uh- Crumple-Horned Snorkacks."
Harry shrugged. "Remember on your eleventh birthday when we went to the zoo?"
"Wow," Draco murmured then smirked. "You know that's the perfect gift for Teddy, right?"
"Well, then they had better hurry, hadn't they," Cassiopeia simpered lightly. "Draco is not getting any younger. Should they wish to further their lines they had better start soon."
Tipsy shifted from one foot to the other, shooting a wary glance at Narcissa and Lucius who were looking on with practiced expressions of aloof curiosity.
"I realize that you were not raised in our world," he began, voice level. "I realize that you do not understand that in the Wizarding World there is more to family heirlooms than just furniture and 'quirky old magical artifacts'. Inside these vaults will be much more than that, I promise you," he said.
"Yeah, we all had fun today," Harry agreed shifting his hold on his sleeping daughter, his two sons nodded their heads in agreement leaning most of their weight against their dad’s legs.
No, Teddy thought, it wouldn’t be bad at all if they got married.
Sighing heavily, Draco tightened his arms around the boys and continued to rub their backs soothingly. He looked up to find James, Teddy, his mother, and Lily all watching the scene in trepidation.
Lucius chuckled lowly to himself and rolled onto his back as he pulled his wife to him, stroking up her delicately curved back. "Cissa, my sweet, one of these days I'm not going to be able to keep up with you anymore."
It was a valid objection, Lucius had to admit. If they were to up and move to a totally new country they would all be leaving behind their home and their lives. He knew Draco and Potter were quite attached and the children's hearts would be broken if they all had to be separated.
Scowling sullenly, James harrumphed and got to his feet. "Fine. I'm it, you great bloody cheater."
"Perhaps Potter would be willing to... speak on our behalf once more," he suggested haltingly, reluctant to even hope to consider the idea.
And he was by no means an idiot. It would be like slitting his own throat to steal from the Savior of the Wizarding World. Complete financial and political suicide.
Draco stepped into the floo, one arm wrapped around the box and the other hand holding Scorpius's. "Tomorrow? But-"
"Teddy's been a joy just as much as James, Albus, and Lily," Harry said, still smiling. "I've always wanted to have more kids, though. Maybe it stemmed from not having any true family growing up, but I always wanted a huge family of my own. Like the Weasleys," Harry rambled absentmindedly, twirling a lock of Draco's silver blond hair around his fingers.
The children were giggling and munching on chocolate chip pancakes -Teddy's favorite in honor of his birthday- while the adults smiled at them indulgently and cleaned them up when needed. Lily had begged and pleaded the night before and when backed up by her brothers finally convinced Harry to let them bring their snakes to the Manor to spend the night.
"See you then, Harry," she called happily just before the connection was cut abruptly short.
The little boy glanced from his dad to Albus's dad and Lily. "I'm Scorpius," he said still looking up at Harry with awe as he gave Lily a smile and a wave.
Harry had developed a horrible twitch in his leg by the time a massive chiming of bells echoed throughout the whole house.
"Give up, Potter," Draco drawled from his previously silent seat on the stone patio floor. "You aren't going to win this one. I suggest you just give in now and save yourself the headache."
"Yes," Narcissa agreed with a pleased smile on her face. She squeezed her husband lovingly. "It's very romantic."
Ironically his Gryffindor courage has deserted him.
Harry watching with an amused smirk and thought, not for the first time, that Ron did domestic just a tad bit better than Hermione. Then again, he did have Molly to use as a role model.
Dudley looked around then asked, "What did you mean by 'longer journey'?"
James caught Teddy’s attention, then caught Albus's and meaningfully closed the book in front of him.
"No, thank you. Just the snakes and the supplies."
Maybe that was why Harry felt such a strange connection with the Manor. It had been tainted with Darkness, but hadn’t bent to it, hadn’t fallen or succumbed to it. It’d taken its scars and still held onto itself.
"Ron," Hermione sobbed into the darkness, wishing, hoping, praying for him to know what she was asking.
"It wasn't nice," he continued, flashing Albus a grateful smile. "What you guys read, that was just the major events. And it was a little cleaned up, too."
"There aren't any poisonous snakes in there, right?" he asked the shop attendant nervously.  "I don't want them to get attached to a venomous snake and force me to bring it home."
Draco stood staring down at the boy, a cold mask painted across his features. James’s hand remained unshaken until his arrogant scowl began to melt reflecting the insecure hurt little boy beneath. His shoulders hunched as he began withdrawing into himself. Suddenly, Draco snatched up the small hand before it could fully retreat and gave it one firm shake.
"Harry's cousin, isn't he a muggle?" she asked, turning her gaze back out to the garden where, Lucius was directing one of the only house-elves not required for medic duty to add yet more wards around the Rapier Roses, Poison Poppies, and a few others.
Things didn't seem like to get any better in the near future. Despite all the help, wanted and unwanted, he had pouring in from all sides it was an uphill battle.
The sudden catch in his throat surprised him. He nodded and tried to blink away the burning in his eyes. "Thank you."
"How have you been, dear?" she inquired, tucking a stray curl of red hair away from her face.
James scowled at him and snorted derisively before grudgingly holding his hand out to be shaken. "Nice to meet you, Mr. Malfoy," he sneered.
Draco watched her rush off, completely bemused in the wake of her panic. He didn't even think any of their house-elves spoke French.
"Teddy!" Albus moaned completely embarrassed while Draco burst out laughing, a pleasant rolling sound that filled Harry with warmth.
The Minister and his wife found a place with the Lovegoods and Neville; the Grangers and Arthur and Molly seated themselves with Dudley and Marianne, and the rest of the group all laughed and joked while they mixed themselves up. Hagrid had a wrought-iron bench pulled up to a table with Aberforth, McGonagall, Bill and Fleur, while Andromeda sat with Narcissa, Lucius, Charlie, George, and Angelina.
The next morning, breakfast is all fun and games until the nightmare of Lucius’s youth comes back to haunt them.
Flooing to the Manor the next day took some juggling. Lily went as Harry's barnacle as usual, Teddy and James came in behind them, leaving George with Albus to pop through last.
approx. $8.82, or £5.85
"Scorpius, Draco's son, has attached himself to Albus like a limpet, but all the kids get on with him."
Wary and curious, Lucius accepted the offer and perched himself regally in one of the visitor's chairs. They were much more inviting than the ones from Fudge's regime he noted absently.
Shaking his head, he stared at Malfoy incredulously. "Excuse me?"
"My mother planted them when she was Mistress of the Manor. We haven't been able to uproot them since," Lucius explained calmly, having composed himself enough to hide his complete and utter panic.
Hermione watched all of this and couldn't help the guilty ache that started in her chest. She had been very uncharacteristically unfair to Draco and she wanted desperately to make up for it.
"Alright, Teddy!" Andromeda said from her place next to Harry. "Make a wish and blow out the candles!"
"Well, it is quite lovely," Molly repeated, gaining more confidence in the conversation. It was very odd to be having such a civil conversation with Narcissa Malfoy after years of feuding and disdain, but not particularly hard.
Taking a deep breath, he unfolded the letter and began to read out loud to everyone watching him.
Draco gave him a smirk before turning his cool gaze on the only Weasley in the room.
"That's great, Luna," Harry interrupted as kindly, and quickly, as possible. "You can tell me about it when we meet, alright?"
He’d been shown into the Gringotts Head Goblin, Warwick’s office. The Goblin talked him through each of his vaults. He made sure Harry at least had a rudimentary understanding of his fortune, interest and income.
They were quiet for a time, then Albus asked, "Is that all that he told you? Nothing about what would make Aunt Dromeda dislike your family so much?"
Harry smiled. "Me too. This was great, Draco. I can't thank you and your parents enough for doing this for Teddy." He leaned down and kissed him softly, slowly.
Blowing out a breath, Harry just stood in his kitchen and held onto her tight like a lifeline. In a matter of days his world has been tossed into upheaval and he’s just as lost as his kids. "I'm sorry. Shh, it's okay. Everything will be alright," he kept saying not knowing if he was trying to convince his daughter or himself.
Narcissa made a disapproving sound in the back of her throat, shaking her head. "I can't imagine that Minister Shacklebolt will be too happy if he finds that out."
And that was what scared him. Even with Ginny he hadn't felt quite like this. It was powerful and heady, and something that he wasn't quite sure he was ready for. His wife had just abandoned him and his children, he was still learning how to be a good father, he was just now getting his life back together.
Harry gave an awkward cough. "Uh- yeah. Since Hogwarts actually." He paused, shook his head and figured in for a penny in for a pound. "I've known
His shower went quickly after that and by the time he hopped back out and dried himself off with his fluffy blue towel he was absolutely starving. God, he'd forgotten just how hungry sex made him.
“I can’t go back.”
Draco turned to face Harry with a hand pressed tight to his mouth and pure mirth dancing in his eyes. "Our parents are bonding, love," he giggled.
They all jumped in surprise and jerked their heads up to find Lucius Malfoy tapping his snake head cane against his shin idly, a wry smirk in his lips.
Harry felt a smile curl his lips as he nodded and ushered his boys toward the floo. "Good night, Draco."
With his mind made up, Harry jumped out of bed and walked quietly out of his room up the stairs to the owlery where his owl, Artemis, was perched sleepily with a wing covering his head.
“My son-in-law was a good man as well,” Andromeda added, that odd tone in her voice again. Narcissa raised her head and looked at her sister a little puzzled.
Slowly, Draco lifted a hand and wrapped it around one of hers, squeezing it comfortingly and receiving a near bone breaking squeeze in return. "It's not your fault, Hermione. It's just one of those things that happen with no rhyme or reason that we just have to live with. It's heartbreaking and will stay with you forever, but it's not the end of the world and if you keep dwelling on it, keep blaming yourself, it will tear you apart. It will tear your family apart."
James thought about that for a moment. "I guess you're right, but how would we find any of that out without asking the adults for help? You know they'd try and tell us the 'kid friendly' version of everything." He sneered, his face scrunching in familiar disgust.
Down the hall, Lucius wrapped his arms around his wife as she rolled toward him in the dark and snuggled against his chest.
Narcissa hummed glancing around as well. "I do suppose it is a bit opulent, but that was how my husband's ancestors designed it. And who are we to question their tastes." She chuckled.
"It's a complete family tree," Lucius told him stepping closer and drawing his attention to the small silver threads that connected the diamonds together and spelled out Black family names. "It's faerie made velvet with a backing of goblin forged platinum. The diamonds are real diamonds, hence the need for platinum instead of silver. Silver is too soft to securely hold a diamond."
"Alright," Draco breathed, turning his face to press his lips against Harry's temple, inhaling his scent; sweat and spice and earth and Harry. "So I haven't done that in a while. Not in so long that I don’t remember it being quite that intense."
"So, before Lockhart even finished the countdown I cast it.
Waiting another steadying moment, Narcissa soon took off at a sedate pace toward the solarium. It was the nicest this time of year and it would be formal enough to keep some distance while still being comfortable. God, why was she so nervous?
the Headmistress then and ask?"
Not surprised in the least, Harry grinned at him and congratulated him. Soon the kids were off playing once more in the yard with their snakes. Harry slipped his wand back into its holster and strode over to his cousin.
Heaving a very heavy sigh, Lucius nodded and began pulling out various papers from the file he kept all of Harry's information in. "Very well then. I suppose we'll have to have a meeting with Xenophilious as well."
A small silver bell shaped like a dragon's head over the door chimed brightly as it closed behind them.
He threw down a handful of floo powder, yelled, "Malfoy Manor!" and was whisked away in a flare of bright green flames before he could have second thoughts.
Fritz, nodded regally and bowed. "Of course, Master Harry," he said then popped away.
The response he got was a wave of excited exclamations and a stampede of small people stumbling into the kitchen.
There was spark growing inside Harry. A spark of anticipation and eagerness. This was interesting. It was intriguing and different and challenging. It was something he would have to learn and continually work at.
Harry glanced back toward the other children and found all three of them enthralled by the stable manager's spur of the moment equine lesson. The man was crouched down one of the mare's front legs lifted as he showed them her hoof. Scorpius, Albus, and Lily were listening avidly, fascinated.
Not that Lucius knew that, Narcissa thought wryly. Her poor husband would never be the same if that little tidbit of information got back to him. He was lucky that Narcissa loved him more than she hated his mother.
The Dursleys show up at Grimmauld bringing a surprise or two along with them.
"No." Her eyes fell on Teddy again.
He could have had the children himself. Done things the muggle way, with sperm-donors and turkey basters or some such nonsense, but he couldn't bring himself to do that. He didn't want some nameless man's seed. He wanted a parent for his child.
The goblin picked up the keys and examined them thoroughly. Then he gave a fractional nod and slid them back over the counter. "And would you like your own cart for the duration of your visit?"
Harry shook himself out his daze helped along by Lucius's sarcasm. He gathered up the presence of mind to glare at him. "Shut it, you. Let's keep looking, shall we?"
Slowly, very slowly, Scorpius backed away from the furiously hissing snake as it reared up to look him in the eyes. The snake had green and brown mottled scales and was thin and long. Not really terrifying by itself, but it didn't take much for the angry snake to petrify Scorpius in fear.
Teddy has to know why his grandma is so unhappy that he’s spending time with the only blood family he has left. James, Lily, Albus, and Scorpius are going to help him with that.
"Ran the house-elves into the ground," Draco corrected with a chuckle.
And they really liked Draco. He was nice and funny and played with them. He didn't even mind helping when they asked. Since he’d become Dad’s friend Dad had spent every moment he could with them. He was happier and better at the whole being a dad thing, never making them make their own lunches or do all the chores around the house. He even smiled like he really was happy.
The whole group paraded into the floo room once more, the children triumphantly content, Narcissa and Lucius amused and calm, Harry and Draco quiet and strangely distant.
Harry was all fire and flame and tongue and teeth and hard thrusts and it was all Draco could do not to burn up with it. He just wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist, threaded his fingers through his hair, and rode it out.
Of course it didn’t hurt that Draco and Scorpius had been like their rocks from the very beginning.
Sighing, Teddy pushed away from the bookcase and headed for the table. It would go faster if everyone helped, he knew.
"Got something to hide, Harry?" Ron grinned at him feeling warm and relaxed with the whisky sloshing in his belly.
This was the scene Draco and Harry opened the door to; their kids jumping up and down screaming their heads off with smiles a mile wide. They shared a knowing look.
Down the hall the five Potter and Malfoy children were peeking out of Scoprius’s bedroom watching eagerly as Stella hissed information to them from under Draco's bedroom door.
Harry could have kissed her. There was no recrimination, no outrage, no protestations, just a simple, albeit slightly wary, question.
Her husband huffed and tapped his cane on the stall gate in irritation. "Yes, quite lovely and quite unpredictable."
"Andromeda!" Harry burst, surprised at the venom in her voice. A mix of indignation and protectiveness welled up in him. "I may not like Lucius, but Narcissa is not condescending nor are either of them excessively prejudiced any longer," he tried to tell her.
Kingsley quirked at eyebrow at him dubiously. "We'll see about that once the investigation is complete. It would seem that even when Harry's not working for the Ministry he's still intent on serving justice."
Another couple stepped through the door to the gardens and Draco turned to greet them.
Draco was about to tell her nothing when Harry beat him to it. "It's a host's gift, Molly, for you and Arthur," he answered, grinning when his lover shot him an annoyed scowl.
Sucking in a surprised breath, the Lady of the House pressed a steadying hand to her chest again and tried to shoo away the nervous flutters that had appeared in her stomach. Standing up she quickly patted at her hair and smoothed her dress.
"Ahem," Lucius interrupted before they could start bickering, silently scolding the younger men with a raised eyebrow. He turned back to the papers in his hands. "Mr. Weasley, it says here that your business offers prank and joke items of all types. Confections, toys, clothing accessories, potions, etc. Could you give me a few examples of these products?"
Teddy smiled at her and shrugged. "Can I please stay with Harry, Grandma?" He morphed into his natural amber eyes he inherited from his father, his hair turning into the shockingly bright pink that his mother liked so much. He knew Andromeda couldn't resist for too long when he looked like that.
Pulling away, Draco looked up to find Harry eying him with a happy smile on his lips. "Do you want one too?" Draco asked him teasingly.
The other boy groaned and let his head fall to his hands dramatically. "What's the difference between the big ‘S's and the little ‘s's again?"
They stood there for a moment, their knees shaking and their lungs sucking in painful gulps of air. "What in the bloody hell was that?" Harry gasped, sweat dripping into his eyes.
"Miss Cissy?" a little voice piped up from beside her and Narcissa turned toward it.
Flicking guarded gray eyes toward him, he shrugged. "My dad actually told me what it was like, during the war. What Voldemort made him do." Pausing Scorpius began to fidget with his fingers until Albus reached over and grabbed one of his hands and squeezed it reassuringly.
"Nope." Harry shook his head. "While my godfather was on the run, I would get letters from him carried by toucans and pelicans and every other exotic bird you could think of. Once, he even sent an albatross."
Ron gave himself a shake then he nodded and hurried over to his children.
"Even after years of hating each other and such a short time of being real friends?" Draco asked dazedly, eyes half lidded as their noses and lips still caressed one another.
"Yeah." Dudley nodded distractedly as he watched Chrissy and Lily pet Belle and giggle over her colorful body.
Once the kids were out of ear shot, Harry turned his attention back to Ron and Hermione. As predicted they had very unhappy expressions on their faces.
Harry took the opportunity to speak. "I'm sure we can figure out a way to get you one. Neville's been having fits over all the exotic and rare plants the Malfoys have in the gardens, as well. We could probably get you cuttings if we put our heads together."
Harry considered that for a moment before making up his mind. "Could you check them for Dark curses and stuff? I would like to take all of them, but not if they'll suck out my soul or drink my blood. And I want to take this tapestry with me and study it a bit." He fingered a diamond and smiled absently at it.
"Don't be dense, Harry." Draco rolled his eyes. "There are anti-apparation wards around the Manor. You can't apparate out, much less with four children attached to you."
"Oh yes!" Luna exclaimed excitedly. "But Daddy and I were having some real trouble getting the funding for research on this one story. It's about a conspiracy to-"
"I won't ever leave you," Harry vowed burying his own face in James's auburn hair. "I could never do that to you guys, never."
He got a dismissive wave for his troubles as Draco strode across the room. "It's nothing, Potter. Scorpius has been pouting for days now because he hasn't been able to see his Albus." He grinned down at his blushing son before turning back to smirk at Potter's incredulously raised eyebrow. "We're happy to have you."
Draco raised an amused eyebrow at Harry who acknowledged the look with one of utter surprise. Draco carded a hand through his son's hair affectionately and began steering him toward the door.
Harry was hit with a sense of deja-vu and shook his head to clear it.
The results of the children’s machinations are a double-edged sword. And the wisdom of parents transcends socio-economic divides.
. I reckon he would be just as happy to go on doing that without any help from me. Albus is amazingly angry. The few times he's actually spoken it was to yell at me. He’s decided that this is all my fault. And Lily just keeps asking why Ginny left and if she will come home-" he choked off and looked back at Malfoy who was watching him with an unreadable look on his face. "I have no idea how to answer her."
Potter paid for their meals and soon they were seated at a small table off in one corner with their food in front of them. They ignored the fact that the whole establishment was staring openly at the Boy-Who-Lived and the infamous Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy, eating vegan wraps and salads with none other than Loony Lovegood. Lucius would be the first to admit that it was odd even for all of the things he'd seen in his life.
"Wait! You have a dungeon?" James blinked at him incredulously.
Some of the kids were already knocked out around the patio on the silk embroidered cushions the house-elves set out for them, but a few were still chatting and playing more sedate games in small groups. Percy and Audrey had already gathered their girls and headed home along with Bill and Fleur and their three kids. George and Angelina were still going strong, though, their kids still hopped up on sugar.
He shouldn’t have been surprised that out of every wizard in England, Draco was the one most likely to be accepting about his family's gift.
He grunted and pulled harder, but the drawer didn't budge an inch. He jiggled it and yanked, but nothing happened. Finally he grabbed it with both hands and braced a foot on the desk leg. He pulled so hard he thought his arms would pop off.
son, blood or not,” Harry shouted, his patients running out. “If I had realized that it would be this much of an issue I would have spoken to you ahead of time, but I didn't, and it's done with. Teddy has never been in any danger with the Malfoys, nor suffered any emotional damage," he said, slowly rising to his feet.
Harry let himself be lead until they reached the opposite wall. He looked up and his jaw dropped in amazement. "Oh, wow," he murmured and took a step closer to the tapestry hanging from the ceiling of the vault.
"Yeah." Harry smiled reassuringly. "There are quite a few muggleborns with wizards in their extended family that enroll at the primary schools. It helps with the transition into Hogwarts."
"You told Scorpius about the war, then?" Harry inquired neutrally.
Andromeda had a firm, sure presence. It was larger than herself and told you that she wouldn’t be swayed or ignored easily. Her eyes told of pain, loss, and hardship. Narcissa looked at her for a long moment, but there was no denying it.
The kids all stared at him in amazement then their faces cracked in wide grins. "We're actually family!" Albus cheered.
Shaking his head, he sighed and propped his chin on his hand watching an old man in a bowler hat walk his dog along the sidewalk.
Harry suddenly wasn't sure if he liked that Draco was about to tell it.
"France was boring me." She flicked a hand at him dismissively, her eyes still studying the tableau at the table. "Besides, why should I owl my own son and ask permission to visit my old home?"
A gasp was ripped from Draco as Harry gripped his thighs in strong hands and lifted him off the floor pressing him back against his bedroom door. The fury and intensity just ratcheted up one hell of a notch and Draco felt a bit like he was about to be consumed.
"Stables?"
"’Morning, Dad!" Scorpius called from his seat at the table next to Albus.
"Grandma didn't know that Harry was friends with Draco and that we'd visited the Manor with him," Teddy answered simply.
Draco took a step forward and stared at it in puzzlement. They didn't have anything like this at the Manor. All of their bread was toasted on the stove. He was just getting a closer look at the heated coils on either side of the waffles in the slots when they suddenly jumped toward his face with a shocking
Draco chuckled ignoring the boy's mother making scolding sounds from next to him. "Yes, Eddy. I'm definitely a wizard. I went to Hogwarts with Harry."
"That could certainly be arranged." Narcissa smiled lightly at Margaret, extremely thankful she was a temperate woman and not an alarmist. "Perhaps we should wait until the party is over to attempt it, though. Quite a few of our house-elves were injured just trying to pull them from the ground."
Glancing at his cousin shrewdly, Harry said, "You know, Dudley, there's nothing wrong with Chrissy if she turns out to be a witch. She's still your daughter either way."
Then again, he was amazing with his own child so it stood to reason he would be amazing with all children. His Scorpius made Harry’s Albus happy when nothing else could. He’d humbled James. He’d gotten Lily to laugh. Draco had all the Potter children eating out of the palms of his hands and Harry couldn't even get through a meal without feeling like the worst father ever.
And it was all because of Potter.
He looked up to see Lily and Rose slump in disappointment and slink away from the old ratty shed at the back of the property.
"Thanks for coming with me," Harry offered him sincerely. "I really appreciate you doing that for me."
Call him a coward, but he was dead scared of what might be growing between him and Draco. Just being friends with him was amazing and the prospect of furthering that relationship to something more, something that Harry had little to no experience with, his marriage notwithstanding, was beyond debilitating.
"Enough," a familiar stern voice said from above their heads. "No more of that talk," Hermione ordered. "It's time for dinner and I don't want any sad moping at the table."
Teddy frowned, his expression dubious. "What’s that supposed to mean?"
Harry just barely kept himself from snorting. He would bet his left arm that Lucius hadn't completely cleaned up his ways. There was no way the man would give up everything Dark and sordid. And if he did, he wouldn't be Lucius Malfoy.
"I just wish I hadn't been so bloody blind," he said his tone subdued. "If I hadn't been so bloody wrapped up in my job, she wouldn't have felt like leaving was her only option. I would have tried everything to help her if she’d just asked." He looked at Ron sadly.
"What are you talking about?" Scorpius asked quietly from where he sat with Albus petting Tal.
Nova and Stella had slithered under his door hours ago and were now curled together on his belly fast asleep. When they'd first come back to him, they'd hissed and sighed and swayed in elegant, harmonizing ways. Teddy just knew they were trying to be comforting and reassuring. He appreciated their sympathy even if he couldn't understand them.
Frowning, Harry straightened up holding the phone to his ear a little more securely. "Is there something wrong?" he asked in concern.
With the kids finally settled into the only un-waxed guestrooms, Harry and Draco retreated into Draco’s suite.
Inside, standing regally on her perch, was a large Eclectus Parrot
"I know who you are," Andromeda cut him off, voice hard and stiff. “You’re Lucius’s boy,” she continued like it left an unpleasant taste in her mouth. She wouldn’t have let that much of a reaction show, but she was still getting over her shock.
The boys just rolled their eyes and continued following Harry until they made it to Fortescue's.
Truly, he was amazed at the lengths the children would go to answer their questions without adult intervention. Then again, he was ever aware of how he himself would withhold details from his son when he was asked uncomfortable questions.
Teddy fearlessly shoved his hand in a large pile of snakes and waited for one to slither up his arm. He didn't have to wait long. Two Dwarf Sunfire Reticulated Pythons
Yes, well Lily had never been particularly good about remembering when to discuss something and when not to if she got excited. Really, Harry was surprised he hadn't had to explain himself to Ron and Hermione weeks ago. Ah, well, all good things must come to an end.
Jolted out of his shock, Lucius composed himself and nodded his head regally. “I do not believe we have ever formally met,” he said as he strode toward the two lounging women and shook her hand politely. “Young Theodore speaks of you often.”
Lucius’s study was all dark woods and built-in bookshelves filled with volumes upon volumes of legal and business oriented texts probably with a few not so legal ones mixed in. Harry wasn't looking close enough to confirm that, though. One wall of the room was filled with great bay windows that showed a rather spectacular view of the pond and the lush gardens surrounding the Manor. Harry could even see a few white peacocks pecking around in the grass.
"That's very nice, my love," Mr. Weasley said as he stepped forward and nodded politely to Draco. "Thank you, Draco."
Turning back to his vault, he stepped forward and pulled his wand out casting a
"I-what?"
"Individual duels weren't working out too well, so Lockhart decided to put your father and I up on the stage and let us have at it," he went on something in his voice said he was reaching the climax of the story so the children quieted down and leaned in. Harry and George almost found themselves leaning as well, even though they knew how the story ended.
"You could say that," another aristocratic voice came from behind him. Turning, Harry found Draco watching the scene in front of them with smiling eyes. "It would seem that Lightning has found another favorite to amuse himself with."
Harry smiled tiredly in agreement. Albus was a good kid.
"You love him," popped out of Ron's mouth before he could stop it.
Harry hoped he could bring the kids along to play with Scorpius while he was busy talking money and Wheezes prank research. He’d been going on business leaving them at home and he really didn't want to do that if he didn’t have to.
“Oh, Vance!” she cried as the rock tumbled away. “You saved me!”
"Well, come along, dear," Molly instructed Scorpius with that motherly tone you were just compelled to obey. "Let's get you outside and introduce you to the rest of the children."
"Yes." Draco nodded, swallowing a sip of tea. "All twenty of the Weasleys, Granger's parents, Hagrid, McGonagall, Aberforth Dumbledore, Lovegood and her father, Longbottom, Aunt Andromeda, the Minister and his wife, and Harry's cousin and his family." He squinted at the middle distance adding up the list in his head. "A total of thirty-five guests, if I've done my math correctly. Not including us or Harry and the kids."
"Hey, Luna. No, I'm not deaf. I was just in my study and it took me a minute to get here." He grinned in greeting at the disembodied head in his fireplace.
With one last shared, concerned smile, Lucius was out the door and headed toward the floo.
Hermione's breath hitched painfully and she pulled away to look at Narcissa through teary eyes. "Four times?" she repeated, horrified.
Nervously straightening her blouse, Andromeda stepped away from the table and began slowly backing away toward the fireplace. "Alright, Harry," she murmured, sadly, not looking at him. "I'm sorry."
Albus tisked in irritation and shook his head. "Not that part, stupid. I meant the part about how one of the guys I'm named after killed the other guy I'm named after."
Draco smiled at him before turning his gaze on James and Lily. "Can either of your speak it as well?" he asked, genuinely curious.
Her tea and cakes had arrived and she was on page eighty-seven. Vance was pulling Genevieve away from the cliff’s edge before it could crumble and plunge her to a watery death.
"I'm glad I'm here now, too," he said, almost chuckling at the wondering, happy look Scorpius gave him as he stood back up.
Narcissa just stared at her, face unreadable, then she finally asked, “Why did you come? Why now?”
If that was true then he could almost be like a mum.
Dudley frowned in confusion. "Where'd she go?"
"Traitor," Draco grumbled before he snatched a plate from the stack on the counter and dropped the hot waffles onto it before placing it in front of a flushed and happy Lily.
Harry laid on his back with Draco pressed to his side, head on his chest. He stroked his hands lazily up and down Draco's back and Draco did the same with the hand he'd laid on Harry's chest.
Harry’s swallow of tea went down square, but he had to grin at her directness. It was kind of refreshing. "Blunt as always, Andromeda."
"All three of them?" he asked dubiously, stuck on Harry’s apparent lack of family planning. Of course the delicious things Harry was doing with his mouth were distracting. There was a renewed stirring in his groin. He shifted his hips encouragingly.
"Blond, dear-heart," Narcissa corrected kindly before she handed Lily a cookie still fussing over the little girl's dirt smudged dress. "Yellow hair is called blond, but thank you, that's really sweet."
Chuckling to himself, Harry stepped through the doorway and strode toward the hearth seating himself on the floor before it.
God. Ginny’s issues had really done a number on his kids and he had been too stupid to even see it.
"Maybe it takes more than just spending the night once and cuddling to fall in love," Teddy suggested, sounding for all their confusion like the very voice of wisdom. He was oldest after all, he must know about these kinds of things.
Instead, he just took the fork from him and picked up the boy's neglected knife. "Here, let's cut that smaller. Do you want square pieces or just any old shape?" he asked with the knife poised over the food.
is a pretty good paper." He cringed then conceeded, "Once you get past the Snorkacks and Wrackspurts.
Ron frowned at him. "How did you get them off the walls?" He got a look that said he really didn't want to know. "Right, okay, don't answer that."
Scorpius shot a panicked look at Albus. He hadn't counted on his grandfather being there and it was unheard of for a house-elf to disobey him. He could see their ingenious plan crumbling before his eyes.
Harry glared at him.
Harry frowned, trying to put it in words, all the things he’d been feeling. "This feels somehow stronger, deeper. Just more," he explained haltingly. "What we have feels really comfortable and so..."
Lily gasped and busied herself with making it look like they'd been playing a wizarding board game instead of plotting their parent's down fall into love. James and Teddy retreated from the door with their snakes and flung themselves into their original spots in the circle.
"Hush," he admonished softly, kissing her forehead and stroking a hand over her hair soothingly. "We'll figure something out. If worse comes to worse we can take Draco and Scorpius and move to our chateau in France. The Ministry doesn't have any extradition treaties on the continent."
The lift dinged and that female voice intoned, "Department of Feminist Issues and Lobbying," in a much chirpier tone than he remembered from the last time he'd been in the Ministry.
Draco waved him off and stepped toward the little girl attached to him once again. "It was a pleasure to meet you, Miss Lily." He smiled at her.
?" he demanded incredulously.
He just chuckled and shook his head in amusement. "They love those snakes. They can’t get into much trouble and don't make a mess. Besides, it helps that the kids can actually talk to them and tell them not do things they aren't supposed to.
"Potter?" he asked as he pulled out a chair and took a seat. "Are you alright?"
Narcissa made a strange sound in the back of her throat. "Nymphadora Tonks," she breathed seeming not to have heard him past the first word.
His groin gave a stir of arousal and Draco figured he might as well hop in the shower before those thoughts lead to other things he didn't have time for with a house filled with children and a breakfast waiting to be consumed.
It was definitely worth acting like a couple of extremely horny teenagers.
Leaning down he grinning cheekily at a smiling Lily. "Well, Lily dear. It is a pleasure to see you again. You are looking extra lovely this morning."
"What are we going to do now?" Lily asked around a yawn.
It was turning out to be a really pleasant day. Draco Malfoy and his bright laugh and charming smile had barely crossed his mind the entire time they had their ice cream. The trend followed him all the way through their wandering towards Quality Quidditch. Of course, he should have known his uneventful day wouldn't last for long.
"It would appear so." Draco nodded his lips quirking up as well. "He plied the boy with homemade cookies and nonstop chatter.” Draco gave him a soft smile. “Albus is a sweet kid, Potter."
“Yes,” she agreed slowly. “I didn’t know him well apart from school, but Draco told me he was one of the only competent Defense professors he’d had. Harry still speaks very highly of him as well.”
"Hey!" he called quietly. "Help me get this drawer open. It's stuck!"
The next morning breakfast was a rather odd affair. There were four more guests sitting at the Malfoy table than normal. Not that Narcissa minded much, seeing as there were two more children to fawn and fuss over.
"Ah, well,
A suspicious scowl wrinkled Draco's brow and he glanced over. "You heard about what the Weaslette did to him and his children."
"Well, I figured that since we're getting on so well, we might as well be friends. You got a problem with that?" Harry tried to sound casual, but he fiercely hoped that Draco wanted them to be friends and not just companionable acquaintances.
"I apologize for my rudeness. Welcome to our home." She stepped forward and grasped Molly's hands in a polite greeting. "I trust that your floo trip was satisfactory."
"Yes," Draco answered seriously. "He knows everything. That Father was once the Dark Lord's right hand man, that I was given the task to kill Dumbledore, that we were imprisoned in our own home and I was forced to torture and kill people." His breath hitched then and he paused.
with your son." Cassiopeia remarked with shade of a sneer. Spiteful old-
Since you noticed how his sharp gray eyes lit up when he let himself laugh unhindered, a little voice in his head said. Since you started watching his long elegant fingers as they tucked stray locks of hair behind his ears. Since he became your friend. Since he treated your children as if they were his own.
Once everything was finished, the appetizers all set out, the garden lit with fairy lights and glowing miniature stars, the tables covered with casual tablecloths, and the house-elves stationed discreetly around the perimeter with waiting trays of food and drinks, the guests started to arrive.
"Yeah," Harry breathed and stared out of the door toward the yard watching the kids run and play. It seemed odd, wrong, not to see a little blond boy glued to Albus's side out there. "He's been great. Great with the kids and great about letting us impose on him at the Manor when Grimmauld gets to be too much and the kids refuse to go to the Burrow."
. There was no spark of magical binding, no shift in the air, just the simple scratching of the quill.
Sitting down at his desk in his study Harry began looking through some new papers Lucius sent over. All in all, Harry decided that today had been a good day.
"What happened?" he asked perplexed.
It burned in the best kind of way imaginable. He hadn't felt this kind of pleasure for nearly eight years and even then it wasn't this wonderfully torturous.
” Mischief hissed from her place on his stomach uncoiling enough to look up at him. “
The little boy nodded excitedly and made grabbing motions with his hands. "Up!" he demanded.
"Sorry, Daddy!" was called back before the little girl skipped away deeper into the gardens.
"Of course, darling." Narcissa smiled at him and patted his arm. "We want Draco to make a good impression, don't we?"
Lucius looked like he'd just been sentenced to Azkaban, again. "Narcissa, I had no-"
Harry's head snapped up, his face a picture in disbelief.
Stunned silence stretched through the kitchen until a particularly shrill and happy shriek from outside snapped them out of their shock and they reeled back further away from each other.
He gave them one last hard look before turning on his heel and striding down the stairs to meet his wife in the breakfast room.
“What’s with that face?” he gasped through his rolls of laughter. “You look like I just suggesting sacrificing a bunch of puppies to heathen gods.”
Molly blinked at him in surprise for a moment before she schooled her expression trying to think about how to answer him. "Dear, are you worried that you've gotten over your separation with Ginny too quickly?"
The only good thing about any of this was that he got to stay with Harry now.
Harry grinned again and held the folds of his missive closed while the wax dripped to the parchment. He lifted the stamp, glanced at it briefly to make sure he'd summoned the Potter seal, and pressed it to the wax leaving a clear imprint. A quick spell and the waxy green seal was dry.
They looked at each other and groaned, "The library."
A small huff of amusement escaped him. Then Harry sobered, leaning back in his seat. "What happened, Andromeda?"
Draco extinguished the remaining light in the room and Harry smiled in the dark. He was sure he hadn’t felt this warm and relaxed in years if ever. He was asleep in the blink of an eye.
"That is enough!" Harry bellowed making both his children jump. His voice echoed off the kitchen walls angrily.
"That's great!" Teddy smiled brightly, relieved. "So, my grandma was upset because she thought you and Miss Cissy would be mean to me?"
"There's one at Grimmauld as well," he added. "Harry, you should have shown them the Black library."
Placing his ear against it, Scorpius listened for any sign of life inside. It was completely quiet, so he gingerly turned the handle and pushed the door inward. There was plenty of light streaming in from the bay windows and the whole room was illuminated.
A laugh burst out of him and Draco just nudged Harry's shoulder with his. "Hey, whatever works."
Draco spoke up before his father could get his mouth working. "They are actually my guests, Grand-mère," he said then gestured to Ron who stood and nodded to her politely. "This is Ronald Bilius Weasley, his wife Hermione, and their children Rose and Hugo." He indicated each one in turn and Cassiopeia's eyes skewered them all before fastening on Harry next.
His bedroom door creaked open and Teddy looked over his shoulder to see James in his snitch pajamas standing nervously in the doorway.
"Sirius," James muttered, sounding slightly confused and far away. "Mischief wont tell my why they all call me that though. She calls me Dog Star, too. "
Harry glanced over his shoulder and gave them a stiff smile. "Hey, come on in guys. I ordered Chinese from Wan Fu's so it should be popping through the floo in a bit. Why don't you pull out some plates and silverware and set the table?"
"Hey, everyone," he chuckled awkwardly trying to dispel the tense atmosphere. "I'd like you to meet Draco and his son, Scorpius."
"This drawer is stuck," Albus gestured at it. "Come help us get it open."
“Harry defended us?” Narcissa asked, sounding surprised, hopeful and happy all at once.
"No! We weren't trying to spy on you, Grandpa!" cried Scorpius. "Honest! We were looking for information about Teddy's grandmother," he blurted, then promptly slapped a hand over his mouth, eyes wide. He wasn’t supposed to say that! His grandfather could always make him tell him anything he wanted with just a look.
But now she was having breakfast with them. Narcissa was fawning over Rose and giggling with her about girly things, Lucius wasn't cruel or cold or even indifferent, and Draco was cutting up Hugo's pancakes for him.
Perhaps you could chalk it up to different upbringing.
"What charities do you support? What type of research?" Draco continued, ignoring the dark looks from Hermione and the tentative conversation Harry was trying to strike with his two best friends.
” Stella hissed to him from around his neck. “
"I don't see why not. It's just like any other language. Although, I suppose, true Parselmouths would still have to inherit the talent, but I mean, if Ron can say something in Parseltongue then anyone can." He grinned wryly.
Taking one look at the uncomfortably stiff bodies filling the kitchen and at how Scorpius was standing pressed against the back of Draco's legs, Harry turned toward his family and smiled widely at them.
Draco sighed and pulled his face from Harry’s shoulder eyeing him wryly. "I guess we should be glad it wasn't my parents catching us snogging. Now, that would have been truly embarrassing."
Turning to the potions and salves stacked behind the counter he snatched one off the shelf. Unscrewing the little tin he dipped his fingers into it and steadied one of Albus’ little hands before rubbing the opaque cream over the abraded skin.
She breathed again and this time Harry knew that it was more to keep herself from falling apart than to find her words. “It’s been a couple of years. I-I’m not sure how long, but I’ve been… overwhelmed.”
His best friend was still staring at Draco with an unsmiling expression he couldn't quite place. He traded bemused looks with Ron before turning back to his conversation with Arthur.
Harry laughed and carefully took the cage from him. "You're welcome to stay, if you like."
"You got Belle and everything?" Albus murmured nervously. "She knows what to do?"
Snorting in amusement, Kingsley replied, "I wouldn't have ever found out about it if Harry hadn't come storming into my office demanding to know what was going on. It reflects badly on the Ministry and is a disservice to the citizen when things like this happen. Once again, I apologize."
Lucius watched what seemed to be a rather serious inner debate until Potter abruptly glanced up at him.
Draco had known they were familiar, friends even, but he hadn't realized that they were quite that close.
"We're friends now," Harry replied earnestly, begging his best friend to understand. "He kind of pulled us out of the limbo we'd been stuck in since Ginny left."
Draco leaned back against the door, panting for breath. Sweat cooling on their skin, Draco’s arms still wrapped around Harry, Harry still bracing Draco up against the door. There was a faint trembling in his limbs, their clothes felt too tight and sticky, and the whisper of Harry's breath over the damp flesh of Draco’s throat made him shiver.
Teddy huffed out a breath and scooted toward the window to make room for James, pushing his irritably sleepy snakes nearly off the bed in the process. "Harry and my grandma got in a fight," he replied quietly so their voices wouldn't travel.
Harry just shook his head. "I'm sorry, Kingsley, but no. I- I need to work on some things.” He shifted on his feet. “Maybe when I get everything sorted." He shrugged and watched James kick at the blue carpeting with his sneaker out of the corner of his eye.
Her voice rang with finality, making the older woman scowl in frustration and confusion. Pulling any further explanation out of Narcissa would be like pulling her beloved Rapier Roses from the ground; painful and bloodletting.
Scorpius nodded numbly up at them and returned Charlie’s smile tremulously. He looked away and finally took stock of the sight before him.
Andromeda nodded, allowing her own fondness for Harry into her expression. Then she sobered and looked Narcissa in the eyes again. “I’m sorry I was unfair to you and your family, Narcissa. I’m sorry that I didn’t try and put away old hurts long ago.”
Then she was gone in a flurry of green flames.
He tapped his chin in thought as he leaned closer squinting at the rubbed out carvings something about them nagging at him, but he still did have any clue what they meant. "Pick it up," he instructed dismissively. "See what happens."
"So, when are you going to bring the ferret around to Mum's for dinner?" Ron asked evilly.
Scorpius's eyes grew wide and he started shaking his head pleadingly at his grandfather. Draco on the other hand just raised a disapproving eyebrow at him.
"I must admit, Minister, that I'm at a loss as to why you would request a meeting. Your letter did not exactly specify," Lucius began, feeling that he'd rather get to the point than trade false pleasantries for the next fifteen minutes.
"Because, my love, our grandson is plotting something," she answered a smug smile in her voice.
Draco sighed and shifted uncomfortably. He had to pee, again. God, it was like his bladder had shrunk three sizes in the past week.
Albus had heard his friend's scream and came out of the bushes at the same instant Draco appeared further down the path, just in time to see the snake make a warning strike toward Scorpius.
Harry had to agree with them. It was a really nice tank. He wouldn't have minded living in there himself. The snakes were impressive too.
Later that night while he puttered around getting ready for bed, Harry thought about his conversation with Draco.
"Yeah." Albus shivered. "I thought we were goners there for a minute."
"Molly," Harry interrupted from where he stood at the kitchen counter. "I think it would be best to take the kids home. They've been away for too long as it is."
"Me too," Harry agreed and noticed Draco watching him with a rather expectant expression. "What?"
"No." Draco shrugged. "It's better to keep reinvesting the money and earning more than to let it sit and acquire dust in a vault miles under the ground. Keeps the economy running."
Rubbing at his smarting ear, Harry admitted that she had a point. He could always depend on Andromeda to tell it like it is and not sugar coat anything. And despite the small lingering ache of guilt he couldn’t say he wasn’t moving on anyway. His kids were getting happier and he no longer felt like he was drowning in uncertainty. They were all getting on with their lives.
Lucius didn't say anything. He just held onto her tightly, squeezed his eyes shut against the dim light in the room and the old helplessness he could feel breaking from his control.
"And then one survived past the first trimester."
Teddy was silent for a moment. "So, she doesn't like Miss Cissy because Miss Cissy stopped speaking to her when she married a my grandfather," he reiterated trying to make sure he understood that correctly. "Why does Miss Cissy like me then, if her family disowned my grandma?" he asked with a sad frown.
"It was kind of hard not to." Draco shrugged unrepentant. "It was on the front page of the
"Nope, but I got the ability to speak Parseltongue from Voldemort when he tried to kill me as a baby," Harry explained wishing he hadn't started this conversation after all. "Parselmouths are born. It's not something you can just learn. I retained the ability after I killed Voldemort and then consequently passed it on to my kids." He shrugged awkwardly.
Two floors above them, Scorpius was giving his last instructions to Shotzy the house-elf.
Harry slumped in his seat and sighed. "I'm alright, Ron," he assured him knowing what his friend was going to ask. "It's getting better."
"God," he groaned after studying the family tree for a moment longer. "All you pure-bloods are related."
"What?" Harry frowned and leaned away in confusion. "What does that have to do with the sword?" he asked in annoyance.
Hearing that, Harry was surprised too. Eddy was fierce to be sure, but he was also thin and short. He wasn't built at all like his dad; stocky to the point of fat and tall.
Sighing, he dipped his head under the spray and let the warm water wash away his linger aches and the evidence of their love making from the night before. This felt wonderful. He felt sated, warm, and loved. Perfect.
Jumping in surprise, Harry shot a look at Lucius who was frowning, his tapping and drumming halted. "What on earth is that? Fletcher!"
Discussions of miscarriages and stillbirths.
"Oh, he is," Draco agreed with pride. "He's got Mother and Father wrapped around his little fingers."
The girl was adorable, he'd give her that, but he still cringed. "I'd really rather you didn't."
“Narcissa!” Lucius shouted through the house as he stuck his head under the fainting couch in their formal sitting room. He couldn’t find his sapphire cufflinks anywhere and he needed to wear them for his meeting with the Minister in the morning.
, he added silently, “like I should have, but there is nothing I can do about that now. I am your father, like it or not, and we have to work as a family to get through this. And if I hear one more unhelpful word come out of your mouth you are grounded for a month. Do I make myself clear?" He stared into his son's angry hazel eyes partially covered by a fall of auburn hair.
He didn't have to ask twice.
"Are you sure about him?" James asked. "You'd have to tell him about Dad and Aunt Dromeda's fight," he warned.
Draco frowned in surprise. "Why ever not?"
"A marvelous idea, Weasley," Lucius agreed, eager to keep both of their wives from going off on a tangent about their unpleasant mother-in-laws. "Come along, dear. Let's show Molly and Arthur where the escargot is."
” He looked down at his snake dubiously.
Coming out into the garden to the sound of laughter, Harry paused just outside the door and smiled at the sight before him.
"How long has this been going on?" he asked breaking the silence that had descended on the kitchen.
"No," Lucius replied resigned. Giving up on his stern persona he leaned back in his chair and absently started twirling a lock of long silver hair around his finger. "No, I will not punish you. Admittedly, I'm even reluctantly proud of you all for executing such schemes as a faulty floo and a snake chase in Diagon Alley. Juvenile yet, effective."
"You know what to do, Shotzy?"
A spike of pain lanced through his heart as Harry thought about all of this for the millionth time. How could he have been so blind? Or so neglectful? He had just assumed that everything was fine while he was gone. Apparently he couldn’t see a problem until it was flashing like a Weasley Wizard Wheezes firework in front of his face.
"And jewelery," Harry added as he shoveled a forkful of vegetables into his mouth, catching nearly every female at the table’s attention.
After both women had gone, Draco watched them walk sedately down the hall toward the guest suites speaking in quiet, solemn tones.
Narcissa felt her throat begin to close and her eyes start to burn. She couldn’t ever imagine losing Lucius or Draco. She didn’t think she would be able to survive it.
Kingsly shook his head dismissively and stood up to shake his hand. "That's alright, Harry. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. But if you want you can make it up to me by having dinner with my wife and I sometime in the near future. Bring the kids. You know how Margret adores them."
." Cassiopeia waved a hand in a very French gesture and picked up another cookie to nibble on. "Draco's attachment to Harry Potter is a serious one, then? Considering he invited such people like the Weasleys into our home, I would have to assume that it is so."
"Oh my," Marianne gasped as a lit fairy flew past her. "Was that..."
Peters just went on grinning. "Getting back into politics, then, are you?" he commented boldly, earning himself a panicked look from the man directly behind him. "That can't be easy to do after the war and all that business with You-Know-Who, can it? Must be hard in society for you former Death Eaters now," he remarked almost resembling sympathetically.
Grimmauld had been completely different, however. When Harry had stepped into it the first time in fifth year the whole house radiated menace. It felt sickly and crippled and Dark beyond recognition of what it once was. It felt like the hair standing on the back of your neck, that sudden uncomfortable chill in the air, a mysterious creak on the floor boards of an empty room.
"We have discovered that Harry's children are extremely easy to grow attached to," she replied lightly.
Harry lifted his head again and saw Draco standing in the open kitchen door. His body was silhouetted in the gold afternoon light and his expression was sympathetic.
The little girl frowned in confusion. “
"I know well what would have happened to Teddy back then. Maybe even better than you, Andromeda. But this isn't the war,” Harry said sternly. “The war's been over for a decade and Teddy has never suffered a single disparaging remark or dirty look from those people while under their roof," he informed her, voice dangerously deep, before his face contorted into an indignant scowl. "And how dare you suggest that I would ever subject Teddy -or my own children for that matter- to a situation that was even remotely dangerous or unwelcoming to them?"
"I suspect it had something to do with an owl my son received in the small hours of the morning the night before," Draco drawled. "That and the fact that your daughter's snake just happened to be able to navigate through the packed Alley all the way to my shop with unerring directions."
They made it to Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour, four sundaes and a small table on the outside patio later Harry was watching his children pick disinterestedly at their melting ice cream. He sighed.
Harry didn't seem to be worried about it so Draco tried not to be. But still...
Draco popped another oyster cracker in his mouth to abate his sudden hunger and watched the organized chaos happening around him. His mother really knew how to put the house-elves through their paces. She had every elf that wasn't laid up with injuries scurrying around the gardens levitating tables, laying out cushions, pruning bushes, and doing any number of things he would never have thought needed doing for the party that afternoon.
"Well," Harry shrugged. "I did, but before that I was having a rather interesting conversation with that python about how he wanted to travel to Brazil and visit his homeland."
Closing his eyes on the memories, Draco came back to the present to find Narcissa watching him as if she had gone on that journey with him and had known exactly what he had seen.
James raised a questioning eyebrow in a perfect imitation of Draco and Mr. Malfoy. Teddy couldn't help it. He giggled at the sight of it, but calmed when James spoke.
Before Harry to continue with his scolding, Albus stepped up, distracting him. "Hey! Look! This is Draco's shop!"
"I'll talk to her, Harry," he said with an understanding somber tone. "She'll come around."
The boys all traded looks, but the only answer they could come up with was to shrug. They really didn't know how bad you had to be to be a Death Eater.
It was meant as a way to spare the children something unpleasant, but Lucius could see that in some cases it was better to be entirely too blunt than to give them edited, sugared answers.
Fighting his rising blush, Harry returned the smirk with a small cautious smile. "Hello Draco," he called softly, eyes moving over the other man's body taking in exactly just how beautiful he looked in perfectly fitted dress robes.
Now that they were alone, with no children to buffer them, Draco suddenly wished he hadn't sent them away. The silence stretched. Harry was watching him with suddenly unreadable emerald eyes, and Draco didn’t know what to say to this boyhood rival that had stolen his heart so easily.
"Ready?" Harry asked again as he moved up Draco's body and pressed himself close, their lips just brushing together.
The children giggled though they were obviously still feeling strained.
"Worthless woman," he hissed none too softly to himself. He half expected Potter to defend her, his ex-wife and childhood sweetheart, but all he got was a grimace and slight shake of the head.
"Don't you remember Dad telling us that story about Sirius?" James asked, rubbing his sister’s back hesitantly, trying to keep her from bursting into tears.
Belle hissed indignantly. “
Headmistress: Minerva McGonagall
Draco finally broke eye contact to throw his head back with a shout of ecstasy. Wrapping his shaking, sweating legs around Harry's waist he helped set the pace; deep and long and hard. Soon, all that could be heard was their panting, gasping breaths and their flesh sliding together eliciting moans and yelps of pleasure.
Lucius felt an irrational surge of anger inside him. The Potter children weren't his blood by any stretch of the imagination, but he'd grown rather horridly fond of them since they began to invade the Manor. It made him burn to think of their own mother abandoning them like that. Like Astoria abandoned Scorpius, he thought old remorse adding to the seething inside him. If he weren't under such scrutiny, watched for that single toe out of line, he’d be tempted to risk Azkaban to hunt the Weasley girl down himself and give her a piece of his unforgiving mind.
"I-" Harry stopped. There really was no excuse for it. "I didn't know how you would take all this. About Draco and the Malfoys, or about WWW. I should have told you sooner."
Draco laughed and leaned forward in interest. The two of them soon began an involved conversation about dragons, in myth, legend, and flesh. He was having a wonderful time and by the time Molly and the other men brought out desert and tea, Draco couldn't tear himself away from the knowledge and stories that Charlie had to share.
"I don't know," Scorpius huffed.
"I see." Lucius leaned back in his chair again, but kept his hands resting on the armrests, his eyes never leaving Harry. The intensity of his gaze made him feel twitchy. Harry checked his Occlumency shields just to make sure they were still in place.
Finally, Harry had them all situated in the fireplace, him, Lily, Albus, James, and Teddy. He looked back at Draco and Scorpius one more time before he dropped the floo powder and called out their destination. He didn’t think he’d ever get used to the feeling of leaving behind two pieces of himself as the flurry of green flames whisked them away.
"My name's Scorpius." The blond boy thrust out his hand toward him.
It was almost funny how relieved Dudley looked after that.
"Nah, Dad. Can't we stay?" James whined as he looked up at his father with pleading eyes.
Hermione didn't return from where she'd hid herself in her study, though. That troubled Harry to no end.
"If they fall in love then Scorpius can be our brother too and Draco can be our Mummy, or our second Daddy, and then we can have more brothers and sisters and we could all be a family!" She smiled brightly and hoping that the boys wanted this as much as she did.
"Because he told everybody Miss Cissy saved his life and that Mr. Malfoy and Draco didn't want to be Death Eaters anymore," Lily answered promptly, with absolute certainty.
The boys looked at one another questioningly.
Draco looked as though he was thinking for a moment as he threaded his fingers through Harry's hair. Drawing him close to press a soft kiss to Harry’s smiling lips, Draco replied, "I think it was the perfect gift, Harry. Well done."
"I wrote for Scorpius to write back right away, so I suppose we wait until Artemis comes back," Albus answered.
"I see that my work is cut out for me," Lucius drawled blandly.
Dudley sighed deeply. "We couldn't fucking find her anywhere in the house! Finally we started searching the neighborhood and we heard her screaming her head off from the roof of the bloody house." He whimpered a bit with the memory. Harry got the impression that Dudley was more frightened for his daughter’s safety than anxious about her possibly having magic.
Harry snorted in guilty amusement before schooling his expression and pulling back from Draco's embrace. "We'd better get out there and keep the kids from eating all the appetizers before the party even starts."
He was silent for a moment then murmured, "I don't know, Cissa. I don't even know what the meeting is about or if it's even truly with the Minister."
"James, why don't you go up and pet her?" Harry suggested when his son still stayed by his side.
: aptly named the Tickling Charm.
"Good grief!" Lucius sighed in exasperation and pointed his wand in the house-elf's general direction levitating the bleeding creature to the patio so that its comrades could patch him up. "This is beyond ridiculous. What is that woman thinking? None of those plants will come out of the ground until they're damn good and ready."
Ignoring him, Narcissa leaned forward and shakily placed her tea on its saucer on the little table.
Harry crouched down and looked up into his son's sad face. "I understand why you would think that, James. I haven't been the best dad for a while now and that is completely my fault, but I would never leave you or your brother and sister for any reason." He prayed that his son truly believed him. It broke his heart that his kids would think he would ever leave them.
Narcissa had tried to have more children after Draco was born, but after three miscarriages and one stillborn, Lucius had finally put a stop to it. He couldn't stand to see his wife heartbroken and devastated even one more time. On some level, Draco knew, his mother had been relieved.
Nodding, Ron absently ran a finger down the condensation on his glass. "They'll grow out of it, Harry. It's bound to take some time. Mum understands, after having them for three weeks unexpectedly she figured they'd want to stick close to you for a bit."
"So it could just be that you don't notice his accidental magic, or that he just isn't inclined to do it like Chrissy. Either way, both of them have magic. And a fair amount I would guess," he concluded, crossing his arms casually.
"That's what I thought, too," Teddy agreed. "But I'm more worried about why Grandma is so angry with them. Do you think they were really awful during the war?"
He nodded in acknowledgement, grateful for his wife’s sake at least, that Andromeda was going to withhold judgment on his business dealings with Potter until she had the full story. Very Slytherin of her. It showed that she was still very much a Black.
"Don't worry about it, mate." Ron chuckled and nudged Harry playfully in shoulder. "As long as you vouch for him and he stays on his best behavior everything should be fine. I think you'll have to wait awhile for Lucius and Narcissa though," he added with a wry smirk.
Looking at all the children he told them, "You're not in the least bit scary. Parselmouth used to be a very rare gift, a sign of a very powerful witch or wizard. The first notable Parselmouth was Salazar Slytherin, one of the four founders of Hogwarts."
"Uhmum-mum-mumm!" she taunted. "You said a bad word, I'm going to tell on you," she grinned slyly, "
Draco didn’t want that loneliness for Scorpius, but after Astoria it seemed inevitable. Truthfully, he should have seen that coming. Trying to sleep with her had been like trying to make love to a marble statue. Unyielding and cold, unsatisfying.
"Here we are, Mr. Potter." The little goblin stepped out of the cart and gestured to the massive vault door. "Vault number one hundred and forty-five."
Somewhat stunned, it took Lucius a moment to register what the Minister was saying. Then the cold fury came. "You were not aware of this to any extent? You did not sign that requisition and someone has been holding copies of my business dealings illegally for the past five years?" he asked with barely controlled power behind his voice. Surprisingly, he could feel his magic boiling inside of him. Lucius hadn't felt this out of control in quite a while.
"You are not going to win against Narcissa and Draco together, Potter," Lucius drawled, sensibly tossing his lot in with his wife. Always a wise choice if you want to maintain a happy marriage. "It is better to admit defeat and suffer accordingly." Truer words.
Lily grinned at him and began hissing to her companion again as she leaned against Draco's chest comfortably.
Flooing to the Ministry was an experience. He'd tried his hardest to avoid the place for the last decade or so and it seemed he wouldn't be able to go unnoticed. From the moment he stepped out of the black bricked fireplace into the Atrium, he was gawked at, and whispered about, and fearfully circumvented.
Dudley and Marianne gasped, but the children all cheered and shouted, "Me next!"
Eddy and Chrissy gasped and watched in amazement as the chair did a little dance before Harry set it back down gently in the grass.
"Oh." Molly bit her lip, brow wrinkling a little in sadness. "Well, dear, everyone heals and grows at different paces. If you're ready to move on from Ginny, then you're just ready. There's no right or wrong time about it." She smiled at him reassuringly and gave his hand clinched around a mutilated green bean a gently squeeze.
"First things first,” Lucius began all business now. “I shall owl Mr. Weasley and request a financial report from him. A list of any current improvements he wishes to make to the company, expansions, additions to the merchandise, research and development, etc. I suggest that you owl him when you leave here and warn him of my missive. I do not think he will not take kindly to being surprised."
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were due in a few hours, early for the party, but wanting to offer any help they can. It would only be Molly and Arthur so he figured his mother could find them something to do. Ron and the rest of the Weasleys, children and all, would be coming just as the party was set to start.
Harry climbed out rather less gracefully than Lucius who strolled onto the walkway as elegantly as could be not a hair out of place. The older man quirked an amused smirk at Harry’s jelly legs, before he turned to the vault door expectantly.
"No, no. I mean, we need to find out what the Malfoys did. Why my grandma is so angry at Miss Cissy, and why she thinks that they would still be bad even after the war," he explained.
Nope, Harry didn't think George would either.
Money wasn't a bad thing. It was all how you used it. If the Weasleys had had more money their lives would have been a hundred times easier. Not that money would have made them any happier, the Weasley's didn't need money to be happy.
