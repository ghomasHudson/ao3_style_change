Harry stared at him. "Are you sure? I don’t want your pity, Draco. If this is the reason why you’re accepting me back, then don’t."
“I’m going to Hogwarts and I’m bringing Scorpius home. I can’t leave him there. He’s a Malfoy. If The Almighty know about Egypt, they will certainly go after him. He’s an easy target since he’s only a child. I will never let that happen.”
,p>‘All that comes out of my mouth is an order, Malfoy. Learn that once and for all,’ he stated curtly.
“No? You know how I treat you sometimes,” Harry said. “You know that I behave like a bastard to you. What if they are right? What if I do have the potential to become the next Dark Lord?”
Harry was the first to apparate to The Burrow, followed by his friends and Draco. Severus went back to Hogwarts, but not before whispering something to Remus. The moment Severus was gone, Sirius and Remus stared at each other awkwardly again.
‘You’re a colleague from the Ministry helping me with an investigation. No one will bother us. This is common procedure.’
‘I think I do, and more than I wish to. Somehow I still hoped you've had really changed. But it’s all a game to you, isn’t? Your sudden interest in Angel, your wish to please me…’
Harry ran his fingers through his hair. He was thoughtful and bothered by something. That something was probably me. Eventually, he made a decision.
I thought it strange that Astoria had let me sleep. After the strange smile she gave me at breakfast, I was even surer she knew more about Harry and me than I suspected.
Late that night, Draco parked the car in front of the garage but didn’t get too far. A limousine parked at the sidewalk and three huge men stepped out of it. As they came closer, he raised his wand.
Their love for each other seemed to grow stronger every day. Harry had confided to her that they had agreed not to let their personal annoying habits to interfere in their relationship and in this aspect they didn’t have too many problems. Hermione also noticed the amount of time they spent together. From her point of view, they had an amazing chemistry together and they never seemed to get enough of each other.
They bucked their hips together. Harry slid his tongue inside his mouth and their cadence sped up. Harry successfully managed to lay the other on his back so he could taste his body. The path Harry’s tongue traced was liquefying both. Every time Harry placed a kiss on his body and bit it tenderly afterwards the blond felt himself burning. Harry bit gently the head of the blonde’s erection and then took it fully inside his mouth.
‘It’s Mr Potter to you,’ I said. ‘He is the Chief Auror after all. He’s a busy man.’ I sounded bitter. Well, I was.
As I thought of Scorpius, I felt a pang in my heart. I had no idea what his reaction would be if he knew his father was in love with Harry Potter. I hid my face in my hands.
“You’re a bastard, Potter. You lied to me. You said what we had together wasn’t just about sex, but you lied. The bloody Harry Potter, always thinking he’s better than everybody else. You know what? I’m way too good for you. I deserve someone better. Someone that loves me back.”
“I will be. But you have to promise me you won’t leave Hermione’s sight, ok? No matter where I go, Nathan, you will stay with Hermione. Promise me, Nathan!”
“They all worked for The Order in one way or another,” Harry said, deciding to trust Horace. “Lee used to break message codes; Colin used to spy on people we thought were suspects and take pictures of them. Lisa was married to a Death Eater named Marcus Flint. Ernie... I don’t actually know what he did. And Seamus...”
“I know, I know,” she said. “You’re wondering why he didn’t say the name of his Master. Think, Harry!”
“It’s not about the Horcruxes this time, Potter. I’m not sure whether this is good or bad.” Before he could stop me I went on, “Alfred decided to tell me his secret.”
They kissed and soon they found themselves lying on the couch snogging each other senseless. Brutus got out of the living room so he could give his owners a little privacy.
Harry put Nathan on the floor, leaving him with Ron and Hermione for a minute. He pulled Draco closer to him, held him tight and they kissed goodbye.
‘That’s what bothers me. After all, you and Potter were never friends. Any conversation between you can only mean one thing…’
He was about to go to the ice-cream parlour and surprise Draco when he spotted him at the other side of the sidewalk...with another guy. He couldn’t believe his eyes when they kissed right in front of him. His world crumbled down around him. His heart shattered into little pieces.
“I think I’ll call Dr Jules just in case,” Harry stated, standing up. He didn’t have to go too far. Nathan was right beside him holding up his cell phone. Harry smiled at his son. “Thanks, Nat.” He stared at Nathan, wondering if he should say something about the whole situation. “Erm… Everything is ok. This phone call is only a precaution,” he said hesitantly. He didn’t know what he was supposed to say to a five-year-old child about a man giving birth to a baby. Even for a grown man like Harry, the situation was weird.
I couldn’t resist the need to pull him into my arms any longer. He let himself be hugged. He was so small and fragile. I imagined Scorpius with the same age but without the protection of the Manor, or his grandparents to spoil him. I imagined him all alone wearing nothing but rags and starving on the streets of London. It could have happened. I felt unbearable pain, and I wished I could go to Hogwarts just to see him.
I stood up this time. We became face to face, eye to eye. I was a little bit taller than him, which seems to irritate him. I felt something change between us. There was tension alright, but it wasn’t the same as it’d always been. I felt tempted to lean forward and touch my lips with his. Harry, however, seemed so strange. I was certain he would turn away. To my utter surprise, he got even closer. It seemed unintentional, like two opposite poles that could not help feeling attracted to each other.
“Because I could have an affair if I wanted to. There’s this girl at the Ministry that keeps blinking at me every time I pass by her. And she’s cute.”
I really didn’t believe that it was. Having Harry around was heaven. It would actually be traumatic if he were to disappear from my life again.
“That’s not the right thing to do!” Dursley said, stepping forward. “I’ve been taking care of this kid for so long!” He faked a sad face. “How can you let this monster take him away from us?”
Harry just sighed. There was not enough information about what Harry had done before vanquishing the Dark Lord. He didn’t like to talk about it. There were a lot of rumours, though. One of them made reference to the Horcruxes, pieces of Voldemort’s soul spread in important magical objects. They had been quite the talk during his fall. According to some, their destruction had been essential to weaken Voldemort.
Draco frowned, suddenly remembering something. “Maybe. What does the other guy that was with the fake me look like?”
‘Does it make any difference?’ I shrugged. ‘Witches and wizards have been duelling with heavier clothes than these for centuries. This robe happens to be made by one of the best designers in Paris.
He got closer to Harry and kissed him hard on the lips. It was his way of saying goodbye, but more than that, it was a way of reminding Harry what he would miss. Their tongues met one last time and Harry felt himself surrendering. He gripped his arms around Draco but he almost fell down on the floor when Draco pushed him away.
“Like he was someone else,” Fred completed. “And in the end, Hermione couldn’t tell who exactly cast the spell. I personally don’t think that Nathan did it. To create a magical dimension requires very advanced magical skills. If the kid can really do something like that, George and I should hire him to help in our shop!”
My only consolation was to know that The Almighty also didn’t know. I had turned to Burke for information once more. Although he had been his usual grumpy self, a bag of money performed miracles in the hardest of the hearts. He had assured me no one knew about the location of the Book of Dead and I believed him. I had been very generous after all.
Harry obeyed him and said, “I’m afraid to ask what’s going on. You’re not thinking about doing something stupid like leaving me, are you? I couldn’t bear it, Draco. I would stop you anyway. You know I won’t let you go, not even if Lucius turns out to be the next Dark Lord.”
“Did you tell Harry?” Nathan shook his head and Draco sighed in relief. “I think it’s better this way. Harry has been under a lot of stress. He still doesn’t know how to handle your powers yet. He just needs some time. So this will be our little secret, ok?” Nathan nodded and Draco went on, “One more thing. For now on, let the grown-ups do their job. You can be a child. You don’t have to worry so much about us. Let us do the worrying for you.”
The years passed and the tale proved itself right. Indeed, the boy saved many lives, lived many adventures, faced any sort of imaginable dangers and got off even stronger and wiser than before. At only seventeen he fought the ultimate evil that ever existed; a Dark Lord so powerful that everyone who opposed him ended up dead or insane. But the boy wasn’t easily scared. He crashed the evil Lord Voldemort with a magic so potent that astonished the entire wizarding community. And he lived happily ever after. Right?
"Oh, that’s bullshit! I know you, Harry. You must have been thinking about it for a while now. One thing that I’ve learned about you is that you never decide anything without thinking about it at least ten times!" Draco raised his voice and Nathan moved on the armchair but didn’t awake.
I really should. And yet I didn’t want to. Why wasn’t he putting more of a distance between us? It seemed to me that Harry wanted me to stay. He kept standing there, right in front of me, looking at me as if I were made of glass. My heart was beating madly. His green eyes seemed to be full of desire. I couldn’t just be imagining everything. Could I?
Mr Weasley wanted to go as well but the Weasley brothers were totally against it and Mrs Weasley tried to convince all of them not to go. Hermione told Ron she would go with him and he promptly disagreed. Draco and Nathan demanded Harry stay with them. Ginny was the one who calmed everyone down.
"Then I love you anyway." Harry kissed forehead. "Enough with the 'what if'. I have to go. If Ron was telling the truth last night, the office is a mess without me."
“And you believe him, Draco? I mean, I realise he’s your father and all but… We need to be very careful about him. He used to be a very loyal supporter of Lord Voldemort. Then he took part in that horrible experiment with Nathan to gain more power,” Hermione said, uneasily. “I don’t want to sound pessimistic but the odds are against him. He was a very bad fellow. Who knows what he’s planning now?” her voice softened as she looked at Draco’s sad countenance. “But maybe his love for Saulus has changed him into a better person.”
“No, no! Let me explain it to him. You don’t know anything about it. Let him hear it from a professional!” George picked Nathan up in his arms and tickled him. Ginny made a face.
“Is it my fault?” he asked quietly, almost making me suffer a heart attack. “Is it because I took your wand from you all those years ago? Did it traumatize you or something? I still have it. I can give it back to you. Or I can let you take it back if that helps somehow.”
I didn’t have the courage to tell her the truth. I kept reading the newspaper instead. I frowned as I read about a gang of teenage wizards who had been terrorising Muggles in London. A pub had been vandalised and some Muggles had had their memories altered. Nothing serious had happened but the Ministry was concerned – as they well should. The group named themselves The Death Gang and wanted the purebloods back in power. Obviously, they hated Muggles. I felt chills down my spine at how familiar that sounded.
“I don’t know what to believe anymore,” he interrupted me. “But I know that you’d be much more helpful if you just stayed out of it.”
I left the boys with Astoria and fetched three house-elves to help me do something I’d thought about the previous night while tossing and turning in bed. I’d decided to go through some of my grandfather’s old possessions to see if I could find anything about the Book of the Dead. My grandfather had been a great dark magic lover and collector. Even though the Aurors had confiscated a lot of our stuff in the past, we had kept some rare ancient books and old family correspondences that were in a hidden chamber in the library.
Draco cursed Harry and his damn stubbornness. His heart constricted. He wanted to go with Harry, but he knew he should be with Nathan.
It was easy to stop him with a flick of my wand, and I have to say that it was rather fun. The teenager glared at me.
We were silent for a while. I should have gone back to my room but my feet seemed stuck. I was also having difficulty to look away from Harry’s naked chest.
Back in the present, Draco watched Harry raising his own wand and pointing it at the door. Right away, Draco knew exactly what Harry would do and he stepped in front of him to prevent it.
Watching Harry suddenly turning pale didn’t make me happy. What I was about to tell him would only make the situation worse for all of us.
“Dr Jules only saw us today because you felt pains in your stomach, Draco. He was very clear about resting. I forbid you to even think about going to work! I’ll go to the parlour and explain to Daphne the situation.”
Harry, on the other hand, was working incessantly with Ron and some of his former fellows to find out what had happened that day. Since some people had been arrested, he had watched all of their depositions, but there was nothing new in them. They’d only discovered that the rebels were a remaining group of Death Eaters in search for revenge, and none of them was able to explain the dead bodies of the members of the council. The investigation seemed to be stuck.
“Oh, no!” she said hastily. “Nothing is wrong! Actually, everything is ok. Congratulations! You have a baby girl!”
He took a step forward and was consumed by the green fire. Dizziness came upon him as the floor started to move faster and faster until Nathan was thrown out into a dark room full of weird objects. He coughed. His face, hair and clothes were all covered in dust. He stood up slowly and something caught him. A pair of cold blue eyes gazed at him and Nathan put his thumb in his mouth wishing his dad was with him.
Taken by surprise, Draco quickly pulled himself together and thought about something to say. He noticed the tray full of his favourite food held in Harry’s hand and smiled.
But Harry wasn’t ready to give up effortlessly. He gripped Draco’s hands and pinned them over his head. Draco tried to unchain himself but Harry kept him firmly captive. He ran his free hand over Draco’s stomach and stroked his hard nipples, licking and placing little bites around them. He knew Draco loved when he did that. Draco mumbled something like ‘teasing Gryffindor’ and, neither of them realizing before it happened; he strewed his white juice all over his and Harry’s abdomen.
“Yes, he is. I don’t know why he loosened the strings a little bit, but I can still feel his evil spirit next to me. That’s what he’s being doing… Controlling me… And I can do nothing to stop him. I… I love you, Harry, but I can’t stop him.” Colin shuddered. “He made me steal The Corona of Power from Lucius Malfoy. Thanks to the Corona, Nostrums took your body form. He’s just like you now. He read your soul; he studied you. He learned everything about you in order to destroy you. He knows about your baby. And I helped him… I fed him with information. I’m so sorry.”
Again, Harry looked bashful for being a hypocrite, but with Draco on his mind, he wasn’t thinking properly.
“No buts. You can’t allow them to exploit you, Draco. Tell me who your boss is and I’ll personally break his face.”
“That’s it? Do you want to relive the past? You know you were an arsehole since the beginning, Malfoy. If you hadn’t insulted the first person I had made friends with... If you had been a little less arrogant...”
‘You don’t really have to do anything, Malfoy. If you want to be forgiven for the past, just join the millions of social programs created after the war.’
As if dealing with a wild animal, I brushed my lips against his slowly. I savoured them for a moment, but he remained unresponsive. Soon, however, his defences began to crumble and he was kissing me back. It was soft and sweet, just a brushing of lips, but just as pleasing as if it had been a full make-out session. I moaned as the kiss deepened. Our tongues performed a perfect dance.
Nathan nodded amusedly. Stella and Albert sat beside him, amazed, and then bombed him with questions about Harry. Nathan answered all of them patiently. He knew he would have to face the same inquiries from others in the future. Harry was still famous and his story was in every book of Modern History.
“According to Draco, no. But we’re talking about Lucius Malfoy. The guy is a natural-born liar! Draco seems to trust him, God only knows why. I don’t trust Lucius. If his intentions were good, he would help me at the Justice Department. He would stand up to testify on my behalf. But of course, he won’t. He’s hidden under Saulus’ wings like a bloody chicken.”
Hermione’s eyes flickered with comprehension and sympathy. She was conscious of the fact that Harry still hadn’t got over the death of Nathan and that his grief was still haunting him. He hadn’t cried when Nathan died. It wasn’t healthy not to cry for his son’s loss but Harry didn’t even want to talk about it.
The bloody scar on his forehead. Needing to be alone, Harry said goodbye to her and went away. On his way home, he thought a thousand times if he should go see Draco. It was a tremendous irony that Draco had been the one he was attracted to in the past. Five years later he still could make Harry’s blood boil. The bastard!
The man himself appeared in front of me when we were back in the house. Thanks to the fresh air and Angel’s company I was able to get rid of my headache.
Colin smiled, and that same sweet smile remained on his face when he fell next to Harry, dead. For a moment, Harry stood still, not knowing what had happened. His hands started to shake, and he felt tears in his eyes. How many times had he watched someone die just like that when Voldemort was back in power?
“Oh, come on, Harry. We didn’t drink that much. It’s not your fault that my head can’t handle a little alcohol. Besides, I think I’m getting the flu or something. I haven’t felt good since yesterday. I should have told you but I knew that if I did our night would have been ruined and I didn’t want that to happen. You were so amazing. I think my body is still feeling some of the effects of last night. You surely were inspired.”
“It was completely by chance. Besides, I help people no matter who they are. It’s what I do,” he said with a shrug.
“Why can’t you just understand that when I saw you with Seamus-” Draco threw daggers at him and Harry amended, “When I saw that guy pretending to be you, my world crumbled down.”
“Oh, come on, Harry. Don’t be naïve. Politics is all about corruption. The secret is to keep working in spite of corruption. It’s a game. You need to know how to play it well. Saulus is a very good player.”
“Ron is an Auror, Draco. I’m sure you can trust him when it comes to that,” Hermione stated and then turned to talk to Dean. “What brings you here, Dean? And why are we still at the door? Come inside!”
Ron glared at him and pointed at Nathan, who smiled. For him, it was funny to hear his father cursing. Harry didn’t find it so amusing though, and he scolded himself in thought.
“Well, you don’t have to. Every bit of the Ministry is now searching for him. It turns out that Seamus isn’t the only one missing.”
“How am I lasting this long? I mean, my body is trembling all over and the excitement keeps running up and down, over and over again, and yet I don’t come. That’s... that’s so amazing. My body seems so awake, and yet I feel like something is controlling it so this moment can last longer than it’s supposed to. It’s unbelievable.”
That was some news. Scorpius had never even mentioned Albus Potter. Then again, why would he have said something about it in the first place? The boy had grown up listening to his grandfather complaining about how insufferable Harry Potter was, and how much “daddy” hated him. I avoided talking about Harry in front of him. It wasn’t strange at all that Scorpius had decided not to tell us that his best friend was none other than Albus Potter.
His green eyes were very surprised to see me at first. Then he showed annoyance – and perhaps something else I was unable to identify. With the dignity of a true lord, he stood up, and with the towel in his hands he wrapped it around his waist, depriving me of ogling at his private parts. I didn’t notice until then that he had just come out of the shower. His jet-black hair was dripping on the Persian carpet. My mother would have freaked out if she had been there. She would worry about the carpet being ruined. As for me, I couldn’t care less as long as Harry was naked and wet. I sneered.
Harry didn’t smile this time. In fact, he became quite serious when he said, “I need to make sure that you will be better until then. And maybe... maybe I should stay and help you out a little bit. You seem kind of rusty.”
The girl rolled her eyes. “You were taking too long to decide where you wanted to go. I just gave you a push.”
The outrage on his face was priceless. I wanted to tease him some more, make him as angry as I could manage so I could kiss him later. Just like a schoolgirl in love. Ridiculous, Draco! Get a grip of yourself! I was lucky nobody could hear my stupid thoughts.
"Yes. Hedwig has a new trick now. The moment she goes into the forest, she becomes invisible," Harry explained. "It’s the coolest spell I’ve ever seen. Herm discovered it for me. Pretty cool, huh?"
Angel glanced at his brother expectantly. I’m still not sure whether Alfred began to eat to let his brother more at ease, or if it was because his stomach began to rumble. All I know is that the boy finally stopped complaining and started eating just as eagerly as Angel. He even answered some of Astoria’s questions without being aggressive. He, like his brother next to him, was starving. I almost envied them. How long have I actually eaten anything and felt any pleasure in doing so?
There was a song for him, of course. A sad and unfinished melody. My fingers ran along with the piano keys as if searching for it. The beginning was happy and pulsing, and it lifted my spirits. But the drama soon started. It wasn’t a good idea, but it could not be helped. I got feverish. I felt the sweat on my body. My soul got shattered into tiny little pieces. Then the last note came, the sudden ending, and the silence. I stopped. There was no ending. There would never be one. I shivered.
“Well, you were my inspiration,” Harry said, caressing his face with the tip of his fingers. “Don’t you know how crazy I am for you?”
What have I done? Could I take it back? Could I cast a memory charm on him, make him forget about the whole thing? As if I could ever cast a spell on Harry. I laughed bitterly, and then I let out a cry.
"It was the stupidest thing in the whole world that you could have done! You shouldn’t have done it, Draco!"
Draco’s laugh was oppressed by Harry’s voracious kiss on his lips. He fell backwards on the bed and Harry landed on top of him ginning widely. The green-emerald eyes were shining playfully, and Draco didn’t resist the urge to enrapture his lover into a kiss so deep he would never forget it. Harry broke the kiss and this time Draco was the one who sighed in protest.
Draco shook his head to take himself out of Harry’s spell. “No. You go ahead. I’ll make you a sandwich.”
"I could if you have knocked instead of barging in. And if I'm not mistaken, your family has gone away from these lands just this morning. I was there to send them off properly. It did strike me as odd that their precious princess was not with them. So you did stay behind. I wonder why."
Harry showed Alfred a few more tricks. The boy pretended not to care, but he was in fact fascinated by Harry Potter, a man he had hated until then. A man who was now lending him a hand and showing him that he be could be trusted. The man I loved.
“Before you walked into my life, I was living only a half-life,” declared Harry. “When I saw the fake you kissing some other guy I was so scared that I was going to lose you.”
They lost Nathan from their sight in one of the endless corridors on the first floor. Hermione looked out the window and saw Nathan hiding in Harry’s car. She gasped. The kid really was fast. And the worst thing of all was that Harry hadn’t noticed him. She watched, aghast, as her friend started the car and drove away.
"The only thing you did wrong was to assume that I wanted to be on the bottom this time," Draco said, licking Harry's neck and biting it gently, making Harry moan satisfied. "I'm the hunter today, Harry."
“It’s good to know you care so much for him, Alfred,” said Harry kindly. “We won’t hurt him or you for that matter. I just need to know what happened. Was Malfoy involved in any way? You don’t have to be afraid to tell me the truth. I’m here to protect you from anyone and anything.”
Harry looked at Astoria as if he couldn’t believe she had just asked him that. I think Astoria always managed to surprise Harry in one way or another.
Harry frowned. Draco looked about to pass out only a few seconds ago, and now it seemed as if nothing had happened.
Draco sighed. It looked as if it would be a lousy day. Harry was pissed off with him, and by looking at Harry’s body language, he had the feeling that things would get even worse. He knew Harry really well. Something had happened to him. Something really serious. He wouldn’t be so angry just because of the ice-cream or Seamus. When Harry’s life wasn’t going so well, he had the tendency to make a fuss about everything. Even the smallest things upset him. It was because of that that Draco decided to refuse the invitation. He was a bloody coward and he hated to confront Harry when he was like that.
They shook hands and Ron went away. A Hit Wizard appeared and opened the cell under Harry’s observing eyes. He let Draco in and then locked it again. The moment they were left alone, Draco hugged him tightly.
I lay down after taking a sleeping potion. I wanted a dreamless sleep. Luckily, that is exactly what happened.
Nostrums wanted to ask what Nathan meant by that, but soon a white light engulfed him, and he disappeared.
I frowned. I could not picture a person such as the old Matilda Junian to be interested in that. She was the last person who would open up the doors of her precious club of snobs to somebody she despised. Matilda was a short and pudgy woman who had married one of the richest and most influential wizards in England. Her husband had been one of the Dark Lord’s main supporters during the first war. He was long dead, a victim of some strange food poisoning. Ever since then Matilda took care of everything in his place. Anybody who was somebody in the wizarding world never made a decision without consulting her first. The old hag loved nothing more than to meddle into other people’s affairs whether they like it or not.
"Alright, alright! I get it!" Harry said, torn between irritation and amusement. "You need to stop doing this or else I won't have any more shirts to put on!"
I made sure to be in a compartment all by myself until I heard the door slide and a familiar scent fill the air. I opened my eyes to meet green-emerald orbs staring at me quite upset. I tried not to grin, but it got the best of me.
Draco didn’t finish his sentence. He was too busy staring at Nathan and the energy that was emanating from him. The world seemed to stop for a moment and, everyone that was at the street felt their bodies paralysed. Everyone except Harry, who watched it all amazed. Not a minute had gone by and a bright white light surrounded all of them. The hooded men were banished from there to an unknown place and the peace was restored.
“No! Absolutely not! Please, believe me, Draco! I had no idea Harry would be there. I was so happy when you told me you and Harry had got together. I wouldn’t do anything to mess up your life!” Seamus sat down by his side and put his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Dean works on that street. You can go there and check for yourself if you want to. I’m really sorry.”
I shut up, but not because I didn’t want to ask any more questions. I had so many questions and then some more. The main one was about his wife. In my mind, and I was guessing to the whole of the wizarding world, they were perfect for each other. They were the portrait of true love. What had gone wrong to lead him to my bed, and why? With so many questions in my head, I just decided to stay quiet. To hell with it all. I had Harry Potter right there, in bed with me. It was better to think about the consequences later. I felt his fingertips caressing my lips and I opened them ready for rendition.
Hermione, Ron and Draco sighed in relief. Bob made a strange face of disappointment but no one saw it. Dursley still tried to complain, but no one gave him a second look.
Still kneeled, the stranger looked inside Harry’s eyes for a moment that felt like an eternity. Finally, he took Harry’s erection in his mouth, kissing it softly at first and then swallowing it entirely, back and forth. Harry buried his hands in the stranger’s hair bucking his hips. It was more then Harry had ever felt in his entire life. It was pure ecstasy.
He had my old wand in his hands. My eyes sparkled like jewellery. Seeing it now I realised how much I had missed that part of me. My hands trembled with the need to touch it. Harry held it out for me. I took a step forward. We were now only centimetres away from each other. I felt as if there was an electrical current surrounding us.
"I'm so not jealous of him. I don't even know him!" Draco complained, "How would you feel if Bob kept sending owl-mails to your husband during your entire honeymoon?" he asked Hermione. "And all of them addressed to 'Dear Harry'."
At least I wasn’t so obsessed anymore. There were days and days. Like that day on Platform Nine ¾. That day had been a really bad one. Not only did I have to deal with Harry’s presence, but also Scorpius’ departure. When I arrived at the Mansion I was a nervous wreck. Astoria almost sent for our Healer. Eventually, though, I got better and felt proud of myself for my strong will.
“That’s what I’m trying to find out. Why don’t you tell me what happened yesterday in Knockturn Alley? Who were you running away from and why? And before you deny everything, think about your brother in the other room. I wouldn’t like to have to question him, but I’ll do it if I have to.”
"And that’s why they took him away from me? How did they know that he was a Mage? Dumbledore never said anything to me! He would have known, wouldn’t he? If he was a Mage and all, shouldn’t he be able to recognise another one? It doesn’t make any sense."
The question could be considered by many as just innocent, a father-son small talk. Draco knew better though and he wondered where Lucius was going. He thought about how tired he seemed to be that week, how he used to wake up every morning feeling nauseated and with a slight pain in his stomach. He thought about the shadows around his eyes and – how could he forget – how oily his hair looked.
Draco quickly took off his clothes and dressed in a silk silver robe. He turned on the stereo and a calm and sensual music filled the air. When Harry got out of the bathroom, he held his breath at the image. Harry was looking absolutely stunning with his robe slightly open and his hair a little messy. Harry was thinking the same thing about him.
“That was... amazing. I don’t even have words to describe it. Words seem so ordinary right now, so useless,” Harry said, pulling the blond closer to him and kissing him deeply.
The goblin inserted the key into the lock of the vault and the heavy door opened up slowly. Harry didn't know why he had the impression that a creepy monster would jump out of it, and by the way Draco was gripping his hand, he was probably feeling the same. The goblin took a stepped back and allowed Harry to look inside the vault. Harry frowned as he looked into it.
“I did kill the members of the council, Draco. Why? It was just because they knew too much and also because I wanted revenge. I told you I was chasing my enemies. Of course, I didn’t do the job myself. I paid someone to do it for me. Am I after your precious Nathan? No. Am I trying to resurrect Voldemort?” Lucius stopped to light a cigarette. “That’s so funny, Draco! I helped destroy Voldemort! Why would I want to resurrect him?”
Harry shook his head and turned to stare at Draco, who seemed to be sleeping peacefully. He took off his shirt and lay beside Draco, watching him intently and caressing his face slightly. Draco sighed and cuddled against Harry’s body. Harry embraced him tightly and smiled as he watched Brutus crawling on the floor and putting his big head near Harry’s lap as if he was asking his permission to do something.
“No. But I have to try. My son and my husband are out there and I need to find them before it’s too late!” Harry said, standing up. “Nathan might be a Mage, and has powers we don’t know about, but he’s still a child. He’s only five! I won’t lose him.”
“Saulus seems more reliable. But not at all less suspicious. He told me to keep Nathan away from here until the trial day.”
Nathan opened his eyes slowly, the lights hurting his vision. He was in a strange bed, in an even stranger environment. He felt uneasy at first, but then he saw Harry sleeping in a chair next to his bed. He stretched out his little hand as if to touch Harry, but couldn’t reach him. Instead, Nathan’s hand touched Draco’s.
But there he was one more time, the jet-black hair tousled by the wind, his green eyes sparkling like jewellery, his semi-open mouth an invitation to sin. He was such an attractive man, the hero of the wizarding world. His loyal wife, Ginny Weasley, stood by his side. Hermione Granger Weasley and Ronald Weasley were also there, and so were the other Weasleys, but I barely noticed them. My eyes were set on Harry as usual.
I put down my wand feeling a tad silly. Then I frowned. Although I was still dazed by his amazing hot body, it didn’t mean I was speechless. Not yet anyway.
Harry didn’t know what to think, except that Horace had been right in his assumption. Colin looked like he was in pain, and Harry had a hard time trying to understand why Colin had been acting as if he was Bob. Colin was annoying, but sweet nonetheless. He’d never done anything to hurt him in any way. On the contrary, Colin had always treated Harry as if he was a god.
Harry sighed heavily and he clutched his fists. I didn’t know why he was so mad. None of my spells had affected him in any way. All I’d managed to do was damage my own legacy, something that would make my father furious when he found out.
“Harry, put some clothes on for, Merlin’s sake! There must be something that fits you inside the closet,” Ron demanded.
Astoria, the boys and the dogs went one way. Harry and I went to the other. When we were finally alone, I took a deep breath to keep calm. It didn’t work. My heart was beating violently in my chest. It would be difficult to control myself around Harry. It was almost impossible to remain impassive, especially when I was starting to believe that Harry might not be as indifferent to me as I once thought.
Nathan nodded sweetly. Summer was still very far away, and besides, he planned on never getting caught. Not that he wanted to get in trouble right in his first year, but not to take with him Fred and George’s gifts would seem like an offence to the Weasley twins. There were also two things he couldn’t leave behind: his father’s Invisibility cloak and The Marauder’s Map. Harry had personally given him those two items, telling him to use them wisely, and Nathan intended to do just that.
For having been ignored in such a fashion, Draco swore to make Harry Potter his enemy for life. And it was because of that deep hatred that he decided to stay in the castle against his parents' wishes and refused to come along with them as they flew from Hogwarts-land after the downfall of Lord Voldemort.
Ron gave Dean a piece of parchment with his and Harry’s numbers. Dean didn’t seem very satisfied with that arrangement, but he took it anyway.
Draco only smiled. Draco surely hadn’t picked a fight with Harry that day on purpose, but Harry wasn’t far from the truth. He did like to tease Harry over stupid things just for the make up sex. He turned to talk to Harry but he was already sleeping. Satisfied, he cuddled next to him and slept as well.
He headed for Harry’s apartment with his heart almost coming out of his mouth. He opened up the door with the key Harry gave him and went looking for him.
Harry was about to leave without saying goodbye. I crossed my arms but resisted the impulse to pout like a spoiled child.
“We should go now,” said Ginny. “According to the guards, there’s a fireplace place on the third floor connected with the Leaky Cauldron.”
Travers, who I knew now to be an ex-Death Eater, pointed his wand at me and said energetically, “You’d better stay out of this, Malfoy! We don’t want you and your filthy family in our group!”
“I’m not sure how to explain it… He had a strange look about him. As if he had just made a decision.”
Ron turned his eyes to the door again and waited. He wanted to make sure he wouldn't be interrupting some erotic session.
After that, Draco’s mood got better. They kept talking about other things, some of them quite embarrassing for Draco since Hermione was the most uninhibited person he had ever met. He and Harry only went back home when the night fell.
Not that he didn’t like Seamus. What he didn’t like was the way Seamus behaved when he was with Draco – as if he and Draco were still lovers. They shared an intimacy that did not please Harry at all. And to think of them together in a locked room... Well, his imagination ran wild from there.
“Is this a joke?” I asked. House arrest? I didn’t even leave my house! “Oh, I get it. You’re doing this so I won’t follow you when you go after the Book of the Dead.  Good luck with that, Potter.”
Harry Potter was without a doubt the new Dumbledore. He knew absolutely everything that went on, just like the old man!
“Yes, but I’m also horny.” Draco took off his shirt and Harry’s, kissing his nipples and making them pop.
Harry took Draco in his arms and carried him to their room where he placed Draco carefully on the bed. Brutus stood by Draco’s side.
“Okay. I’ll go with you. I guess it’ll be fun to see that bunch of flatterers making an extreme effort to please Matilda while they try to hide how much they loathe having Potter around.”
What I would do from that moment on was a complete mystery. I was sure of one thing, though. Staying away from Harry would be painful. My body was already screaming to have him back. My prick was showing signs of life just by thinking of him. Not even the water shower was enough to put out my fire.
The Auror, whose name I didn’t know, got his wand and seemed about to threaten me with it. Harry stopped him.
Up in the north of Hogwarts-land and deep in the highest mountain lived a beautiful prince named Draco Malfoy. His hair was fair, silky and soft, and his eyes were as blue as the sky. His heart, however, was as cold as ice.
The only one who seemed worse than Harry was Mrs Weasley. She didn’t want to leave her bed for anything unless there was news from Fred. As for George, he looked as creepy as Harry. Hermione actually thought George looked even creepier than Harry. With the disappearance of his twin, George seemed like the living-dead. He was strangely quiet and thoughtful. Ron was afraid that George would do something crazy because he kept saying under his breath that he should be with his brother.
He stared at his father, trying to figure out why he was pregnant in the first place. If Lucius knew, then he was responsible for it and that was a very bad sign.
One thing I was sure of. In all those years of loneliness and sadness, that moment right there was just what my broken soul needed, and nothing would it away from me. I would keep it in my heart forever.
‘I trust Harry,’ I finally said. ‘I know he wouldn’t let anyone here that he didn’t trust entirely.’
‘That’s the thing. He didn’t say anything, but kind of let me know he was aware of my connection with you. He knows we spoke in Matilda’s house,’ I cleared out just in case he thought I was talking about our sexual dalliance.
Love was just a fairytale that only happened in books. There was no such thing as happily ever after. Not for him. But it was hard to convince his soul of this matter. His soul still wanted to dream and hope that somehow he would find his soul mate, his other half, and his heart would finally be able to settle down and be happy for good.
If Astoria had any idea about what had happened the night before between Harry and me she didn’t say. She just smiled as usual. I felt the worst of men. We didn’t love each other passionately, but that didn’t mean I could just sleep with someone else without telling her first. We were married and had a son together. Our rooms were in different wings of the castle, granted, but only because the wing I was in was warmer and Astoria would much rather have the room with the view to the lake.
After the nirvana they had shared together, they took a few minutes to recover. Draco turned to look at Harry and they only stared into each other’s eyes for a long time.
“I’ve been craving for you for so long. Please don’t deny me this night, this moment. I felt your need, Harry. I can still feel it. Your body wants mine. Your lips are dying to touch my lips.” he brushed their lips. “What do you want, Harry?” his hand slid down Harry’s body and stroked his hard shaft. “I’m here at your disposal. I’m yours. Do as you please.”
"So, you’re in love with him." Draco pointed out to Saulus. "I’m stunned. But still, it doesn’t explain what your intentions are. I mean, your deepest desire had always been to be the Minister of Magic. You couldn’t for the obvious reasons and then you sent your lover in your place. You did bribe the council so Saulus could get to the position, didn’t you?"
Nathan nodded. Draco looked up to face Harry, who was smiling. Only Nathan was capable of melting Harry’s heart so quickly.
How come the idiot didn’t realise he was dangerously close to me? Wasn’t he aware of what he could do to me? The insensitive prick!
“We are,” Harry answered following Sirius upstairs with Nathan clutched around his neck. “Five Apparations in a row...  We had breakfast with Hagrid actually! We had to drop by in Paris. Such a lovely city. Perhaps when the chaos is over we can all go there. Hagrid will love Nathan.”
“I’m thinking of Nathan’s best interests,” Draco answered calmly. He didn’t know why but he was feeling a lot better since Nostrums had been vanquished. Even Harry’s bad mood wasn’t affecting him.
Harry’s defences were all up. Interesting. If I got any closer, our bodies would touch, and so would our lips. This was the moment Astoria was supposed to come and interrupt us before things got out of hand. I waited a few seconds. She didn’t appear.
At the mention of the Dark Lord’s name, I felt chills down my spine. Harry was probably one of the only people who could say his name aloud so calmly. I couldn’t even think about it without trembling.
He shot Harry one last desolate look and headed for the front door. Brutus bit his shirt to try to stop him, but that gesture only made Draco more upset. He and Brutus fought for a moment until Draco won the battle, grabbed his coat and closed the door firmly, leaving Brutus barking inside the house. The guilty feeling still tried to make its way into Draco’s mind, but he decided to ignore it.
“He’s in the cell next to us. But don’t bother to shout. This cell is soundproof. The guy that isn’t Harry took our wands, too. I’ve already tried to do wandless magic, but it was no use.” Bob sat down next to Draco, saddened. “I don’t know why he’s keeping us alive. Well, now I know why he’s keeping me alive. It’s because of the Polyjuice Potion, right?” Bob smiled. “I know what you’re thinking. How can an Auror be so thick? Well, that’s me. But I’m not so useless. I’m very good at hand-to-hand combat.”
“This is definitely not the place I would have chosen to have this conversation with you,” Sirius said with his head down. Then, after taking a deep breath, he went on, “I’ve been in love with you since our fifth year of school.”
After the battle, the boy became even more famous than he already was. His name was known everywhere, even among some Muggles. He was respected and feared. He was surrounded by good friends that loved him.
Hermione and Ron arrived shortly after this. Since Harry wasn’t able to speak anymore, Sirius filled them in with the dreadful news. Hermione made tea for Harry, but he didn’t want to drink. He had finally stopped crying, and now he was trying to think of something. Suddenly, he remembered who could help him.
“Hey, people!” Draco exclaimed, defending himself from an attack. “We’re in the middle of a battle here. You can’t tell me where Harry is but you can talk about my pregnancy as if nothing is happening!?”
Mrs Weasley sighed. “Your father is having some trouble at the moment but he’ll return as soon as he can, dear. Your other father is taking care of it. Not to mention that the entire community is outraged by all that is going on.”
It was a humourless joke. Angel and Alfred opened their eyes wide and their concern for my health increased. I was touched that even Alfred seemed worried about my wellbeing.
“Harry… They won’t take long,” Draco said, putting his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Come on. We’ll be right outside the door. Ok, Nat? Do you think you can be alone with these gorgeous women for a little while?”
“The medi-wizard said he’s doing fine. He’s recovering slowly, but he thinks Seamus will be able to go home in two or three days.”
The Healer was gone after informing me about the marvellous powers of a good rest, and he left me a prescription. My personal Healer was not around but he would get in touch as soon as he could.
“Life’s really strange,” he started mysteriously. “We were apart for so long... But now it’s started all over again.”
“He said he doesn’t want Nathan.” That was probably because he would have a replacement, Draco thought bitterly. “What happened to the ‘I won’t be mad at you if you are seeing your father in secret’? You promised me you wouldn’t be mad!”
“Chill out, Draco. It’s just a baby. And he loves Nathan,” Sirius said waving his wand and making the luggage float.
On the other hand, if things were so perfect in the Potter household as they wanted the world to believe, then what was all that the previous night? Why did Harry tease me so much? Were my meds making me see things that weren’t there? After all these years? Maybe. After all, that was a more likely hypothesis than Harry Potter having feelings for me.
I wanted to look away, but I kept staring at him trying to find something that gave me a clue at how he felt about us. Apart from a flicker in his eyes, he seemed aloof.
Harry couldn’t believe any of those things. He had seen the surprise and fear in Draco’s eyes, and the shake in his body when they’d found out that Lucius was alive. Draco had also told Harry about his meeting with his father, which proved that Draco wasn’t lying to him. Draco wouldn’t lie to him. He didn’t have a reason. He loved Harry and Nathan.
Harry smirked at her. “Did I? Ask Draco about it. He’ll tell you all about how easy it is for me to snap over silly things.”
“How… I mean, why… I mean, how…” Harry still couldn’t formulate a coherent sentence. “How is this even possible? Men are not supposed to have babies! Is it a wizarding thing that I never knew about it? Since when do you know? Are you all right?”
“I won’t let Horace near him,” Harry said resolutely. Draco thought fleetingly that Harry’s sullen expression was very appealing. For a moment, he wanted Horace to try something just to see what Harry would do. His inner self smiled at the thought.
“Not much. All we know is what the prophecy told us. Nostrums was a demon that lived in 1300. He was known to cause a high degree of disturbance and distrust between his victims. People who got in touch with him often showed signs of an unexplained fury towards everything. A wizard got him, though, and locked him somewhere.”
"NO! If you want to help, go to work and see if you can discover something there. Dad will be happy to help you. I would say Percy since he works with you, but you know how Percy is..."
He left Brutus watching over his son and went after Draco, finding the door of the bedroom locked. He knocked but Draco didn’t answer, giving him no choice but to sleep on the couch. He didn’t sleep though. He preferred to spend the night watching TV and counting the holes on the wall. He had never paid attention to them. Not that the holes were big or anything... and what was he doing anyway? He was just bored.
They kissed eagerly all the way to their room, hoping to keep the taste of their lips not only in their memory but also in their hearts. Harry laid Draco on the bed and then took off their clothes, tossing them carelessly onto the floor. Draco warned him that there was a child in the house and that they should be careful, so Harry told him that he would moan quietly.
Later on, as I played the piano with Angel, I let Harry invade my mind again. It was thanks to him that the melody sounded so heartbreaking. Ten years ago I had started composing songs as a way to deal with my feelings. It had worked for some time until thoughts of Harry began to crawl in my mind and ruin everything.
Suddenly, Harry realised something. He’d never thought about a school for Nathan and he didn’t know what school kids at his age should go to. They were wizards. Maybe there was a proper wizard’s school for Nathan. While he discussed the subject with Draco, Nathan still stared at the parchment, his eyes glowing greener as the time passed.
At that exact instant, a hooded figure appeared at the corner of the corridor and his eyes fell upon Nathan, who looked back at him with a serious expression. Draco followed Nathan’s gaze and gasped at what he saw – or at least at what he thought he saw. That robe was very familiar. It looked a lot like one of his father’s old robes. But what was Lucius doing there? And why was he staring at Nathan like that?
“Alfred, we need to talk,” I said to the boy next to me, who jumped skittishly as he heard me. He had been staring at the Auror.
The boy certainly had a temper. I expected him to behave like that, so I told him to sit next to me on the loveseat while Astoria, always so aware of my intentions, took Angel to a place where there was a trunk with many of Scorpius’ old toys so she could give us some privacy.
Getting in touch with the Ministry, then, was out of the question. I needed to speak with my father. But before I did, I needed some rest. I went to my room and entered the bathroom and I was not surprised when I looked at myself in the mirror. I looked like the living dead. I was pale, but sort of feverish at the same time and had deep shadows under my eyes. I felt so much older than I was.
I sneered. Angel’s happy screams distracted us for a moment. Then I heard Alfred ask as if it wasn’t important, “Were you afraid?”
“All right.” Harry turned his head back and saw a large and hairy cream-colored dog sitting on the floor, staring at them with big brown eyes.
“You took money as well!” Harry continued to shout, “Fudge paid you a lot of money and someone in the council is still doing the same thing! You receive money to take care of my son and yet you let him sleep under the cupboard! You should treat him like a prince!”
Draco shivered. He wondered what they knew about Nathan and if their intentions were as altruistic as they seemed to be. Saulus indeed appeared to be a nice guy, but Lucius wasn’t. Still, he felt like he had no choice but to rely on them. At least for the time being.
Harry laughed, held Draco in his arms and took him to the bathroom. Brutus barked at them all the way.
It was like a reality check. I felt as bashful as Harry. I had completely forgotten about the boys’ presence. In the end, I decided to follow Harry’s orders, mostly out of curiosity. I just wanted to know what he had in store for me.
I blinked for a few times. I was finally able to see things more clearly. I looked at Harry, who was staring at me with angry eyes. I trembled slightly.
And what exactly did he mean by that? Don’t tempt me or I’ll kiss you back? Don’t tempt me or I’ll stupefy you? I licked my lips.
It was an interesting proposition; one that Draco wasn't keen to let go easily. So he let himself be kissed and ravished until morning came.
What happened next was a series of whispers, cries, moans and kisses. Harry hastily made his way up Draco's body and buried himself inside him. There were no slow movements. They were eager for each other, and with each thrust, Harry became more passionate and hurried. Neither cared though. They were thirsty for each other.
Behave? How dare he? After everything we have been through, he was still a cold bastard. Behave, huh? Well, we’d see about that.
Draco pulled away slowly and the sadness and defeat that could be read in his eyes split his heart in two.
Draco sighed, a horrible feeling sinking at the bottom of his stomach. He couldn’t help but think that if someone was kidnapping ex-spies, then he could be the next victim. He didn’t tell Harry that, though. In fact, he was quite curious as to why Harry hadn’t said anything about that to him.
Harry smirked. “Well, I guess you’re totally right. After all, it’s your fault that Nathan is not in your house anymore!”
Oh, yes, he was amazingly fit. Even with his body covered with his black robe, I knew that underneath it was the body of a Greek god. Harry was well-built, that much I knew. I had seen him in muggle clothes before. I knew exactly what his robes were hiding. Unfortunately, I couldn’t let him know my real opinion.
“Right now, yes, it is. And since this case has everything to do with you, mixing things isn’t helping me think clearly,” he said, frustrated.
My heart was split between the fear of what was to come and the overwhelming happiness of having my dream fulfilled. Part of me wanted to start singing and dancing. The other part, however, just wanted to stay in bed under the covers and never leave.
Bob looked at Draco with a smile of triumph. Draco had to swallow hard all the insults and the anger that were stuck in his throat. He looked down, unable to stare at Harry.
Harry got closer and enlaced their hands together. Draco didn’t pull away this time. He needed Harry to be by his side. He needed to feel his strength, the heat of his body, the beat of his heart. He needed it all to soothe his heart, to ease the guilt.
None of them seemed to be very happy with the idea of leaving me alone with Harry. I almost laughed. What did they think I could do? I wasn’t a match for Harry. I’d never been a match for him no matter how much I’d tried to convince myself otherwise. I was older and wiser now. I knew how to accept my limitations.
Paris is everything people say and more. It is so much more than the Eiffel Tower. It is a place where you breathe culture at every corner and appreciate food as a form of art. I wish I had more time to enjoy its pleasant views and romantic scenery. How wonderful it would be to sit in a café with Harry and pretend we were a couple just enjoying our time together.
“I’ll go with daddy,” Nathan said as he took his thumb out of his mouth. Draco felt like kissing his chubby cheeks when Nathan grabbed Harry’s hand and pulled him away. He had no idea that Harry would be so stunned when the delivery date came. Draco was even more surprised to realise how calm he was. He thought he would be freaking out and cursing the wizard who had invented the pregnancy potion for men. But instead, he was in control of the situation.
“And that just corroborates the idea that some of you gentlemen are also being hypocritical, isn’t that right?” Harry attacked, referring to some wizards and witches who had supported the Dark Lord behind the scenes and that had escaped without being prosecuted.
“I know, Harry. I just... wanted to apologise and give you my full support. I’m here for you. You can count on me for everything you need.” Bob took Harry’s hand and squeezed it. “What do you want me to do, Harry?”
Harry made Draco turned around to face him. “Are you jealous?” his tone of voice clearly indicated his astonishment.
Angel opened his eyes wide as he looked at the table. I smiled sadly. Living on the streets, I guess scrambled eggs, fresh scones, cakes, muffins, juice and fruit were something completely new to him. I felt something squeeze my heart, and Harry’s struggle to help those poor kids finally made sense to me, which only made me feel more like scum.
“Okay,” said Harry softly as he turned to look at Alfred. “If you tell me where I can find your parents, then I’ll let you go. But if there isn’t anyone to take care of you, then I’ll have to take you with me to the Institution.”
“Actually, it was almost by chance,” Lucius sneered. “One of our men was in St. Mungo’s at the time Cho Chang went there to consult a medi-wizard, and by reading her file he discovered that the baby she was expecting was yours.”
“Oh, Harry, I don’t know if I should tell you since he didn’t want you to know. I met him last week in an ice-cream parlour.  I was completely shocked when I saw him. I mean, I knew he’d spied for our side when the war exploded but at the time he was still the same spoiled brat as ever. But now he is so different. He told me about his feelings for you when I was Voldemort’s prisoner but I told him to back off if he wasn’t serious. He helped me escape. We became kind of… friends since then. He never tried anything with you because of the war; after all it was dangerous times. He left the wizarding world to live a simple life. He abandoned everything. I had lost contact with him for a year when I saw him by chance. We talked; he said he still loved you and then I tried to be the cupid. Obviously, it wasn’t one of my most brilliant ideas…”
Harry’s soft breath caressed Draco’s neck. Desire ran free through his body, making him lose his cold posture. It was useless to resist Harry’s tender ministrations. His breath hitched and his heartbeat sped up as Harry’s hands slipped down his back and gripped his hips bringing it closer to Harry’s already hard cock.
“I don’t think you understand, Hermione. He left! I don’t know who he is! He didn’t want to give me his name but he seemed to know mine. He knew me. He said he loved me. He said he’d always loved me.”
“I don’t bloody care anymore, Draco.” Seamus sat on a chair near Ron. “I didn’t win Dean back. All I did successfully was destroying your relationship with Harry. Do you want to know the truth of what I did during the war, Harry? I sold my body to the cruellest and most wanted Death Eater of all times in exchange for important information.”
“You helped me and your sister that day. You did a wonderful thing. Even though you have no control over your healing powers yet, you still helped me.” Draco wrapped his free arm around Nathan and kissed his forehead. “I’ll be forever thankful to you.”
“Angel trusts you, and he’s good at judging people’s characters. Your wife is a nice person. She treats us with respect. Besides, none of you is pressuring us to do anything we don’t want to. You simply accepted our presence here. I know we’re trouble...”
Nathan looked down, suddenly remembering the deprivations of the Dursleys house. He knew that tone of voice pretty well. It was the same as Aunt Petunia when she didn’t want him to eat anything from the freezer. His eyes filled with tears and Harry’s heart melted instantly.
“He came back because of me,” Nostrums said, annoyed with the display of affection. He would never understand humans. There they were, in a critical situation, and Nathan still had the courage to smile reassuringly at his dad. “Our destinies are interlaced. He swore that if I was ever reborn, he would come after me. So here we are.”
Astoria touched my arm as if to support me. I shrugged. I didn’t want to look weak in any way. I was Draco Malfoy. I could be a coward on the inside, but outside I would always be a Malfoy.
Nathan waved Draco goodbye one last time and Harry took him to his bedroom. While they were gone, Draco took the paper in his hands and gasped when he saw what was written in it. He only got out of the state of shock when Harry came back.
“Don’t you think you’re getting ahead of yourself? Or have you just made that decision after finding out about Angel’s connection with Slytherin?” Harry asked suspiciously.
"No, I don’t think so. If that was true, then your father helped to plot against Voldemort and as far I know, Lucius was one of the biggest supporters of the Dark Lord."
His green eyes darkened. Harry had never looked so threatening or sexy. And neither so lost. He opened his mouth, but seemed to think better of it and closed it again. He tried one more time. Nothing came out of it. Finally, he turned around and left. As soon as he was out of sight, I sat down on the cold floor and put my hands on my face as if that would be enough to hide me from the world. I was more than worn out by now.
Draco rose from the table, collected his clothes slowly and put them on. Not once he looked at Harry. He couldn’t. If he did, he knew he would be lost. He knew he would never have the courage to do what he was about to do.
So Astoria had not fully disclosed my real state to Harry. It made sense. Harry would have never let me come if he knew about that particular fact. By now, though, she must have been regretting her decision terribly. I felt guilt sinking in my stomach.
Ginny and Fred exchanged concerned glances about Nathan’s sad face. Harry had told all his close friends about his conversation with Neville and the implications of it. Neville told all of them to act normally around Nathan. He was more sensitive than other kids, but that didn’t mean he should be treated like he was made of glass.
“Well, this isn’t one, so I guess I'm not breaking any rules of good manners, eh?” his smile was as cynical as mine. “I think you know why I’m here.”
I almost spilt the wine on the table. It didn’t make sense that they would ask Harry to go there. The Wizarding Club barely tolerated him for whom he was, and I knew really well what they really thought of the hero of the wizarding world. Harry was not pureblood. People like Harry were still intolerable for the true wizarding elite.
‘I hate you,’ I said when I really wanted to say the opposite. ‘I hate you for making me want you so much.’
“You were not so lucky, either,” Harry reminded him not so gently. “In fact, I remember the day Parvati cuffed you on the head because you had said something about her hair that you thought it was a compliment but she thought it was the most horrible pick-up line in the history of Hogwarts.”
“Wait a minute! Did I hear you saying that you called Severus Snape?” Sirius asked as if he had just realised what that meant.
“No, I didn’t. It’s all Hermione’s fault, believe me. She has this annoying habit of trying to be a matchmaker. I was completely taken by surprise when I saw you.”
When she was gone, Draco sat down in his chair and looked at the parchment. It was just a note about a meeting, but the place described there wasn’t known by anyone. To learn the real meaning of it, Draco would have to think of a proper spell. Maybe Seamus could help him with that. He picked up the phone and called his ex-boyfriend. Seamus answered after five bell rings.
"You were actually very receptive now that I think of it. That was why I didn’t pull away too soon."
“He helped me a lot in the past. I called him because he knows a lot of people in the right places, whether you believe it or not. No wonder he was the best spy Dumbledore had ever had.”
Harry couldn’t believe that everyone was finally home. Draco was taking a shower, Nathan watching TV and he was checking if the wards were all activated around the house. By his side was Brutus, the most loyal of dogs, especially now that his position as the only dog in the house was at stake. Harry patted Brutus’ head and smiled. Brutus had taken very seriously his job as “patrol dog” and seemed very proud of his new position, so he kept following Harry everywhere he went.
‘Promise me you will make an effort to get better. And that you will hear me and obey me even when you don’t feel like it.’
‘Hey, we are protected even without Potter being here physically. He is, after all, our secret keeper. Nobody can come in unless he allows them to,’ I said.
As for me, I didn’t know what to feel. I thought Harry would come to the Manor frequently. I was completely wrong. He only got in touch with the Aurors, asking for news and sending them messages. He never spoke to me directly. Needless to say, I was pissed, which made me get worse.
Brutus growled and Draco laughed. As they were getting close to home, he watched Harry and Ron parking the car at the sidewalk. He stopped, waiting for Harry to get out of the car and see him. When Harry did, their eyes locked. In Harry’s eyes, he read concern but also rage and he knew there was trouble ahead.
Draco waited for the cocoa to cool out and then he handed it to Nathan in a red plastic cup that Harry had bought that day.
‘The dark hair was a great idea,’ Harry said as we got ready to depart. ‘You look like a completely different person.’
It was hard to predict. The Harry Potter from the present was so different. He was a lot manlier, a lot more mature. The few times we had met each other, he had treated me with polite coldness and not at all aggressively. Our brief encounters always left me shaky and sick, because surprisingly - or not - I hated the courteous Harry Potter.
Harry would have preferred that Severus kept most of the details about the procedure to himself, but at least his old professor was being nice for a change. And Harry had been surprised to see how his hardened countenance had softened as he had stared at Hope through the glass window.
"Draco... If you come with me, you’ll have to leave everything behind. Nobody can know about where we’re going. No one knows the location of the cabin but Ron and Hermione. He agreed to be my secret keeper and..."
“I’m going to take a shower. Care to join me?” Harry asked seductively when he noticed the way Draco was gazing at him with lust.
And then there was Nathan. Nathan was much more than a Mage. There wasn’t a name for what he was. As soon as Fudge had found out about Cho Chang’s pregnancy and that the baby was Harry Potter’s child, a group of very powerful and wealthy wizards were gathered to discuss the news. With a few tests, they’d discovered that Nathan was a Mage – a wizard more sensitive and sometimes more powerful than others – and a diabolical plan was formed. Cho Chang had taken magically altered vitamins without realising what she had been doing. She had completely believed her medi-wizard that the pills were only natural vitamins. She only found out the truth later and that was why she had been killed.
Draco was speechless. He knew what that meant. They had talked about it once and Harry had told him about the meaning of that ring. It was a very special ring. A ring that he would only give away if he found his true love and wanted to live with the person for the rest of his life. Sirius had given it to Harry after the war. It had been a gift from Lily to James Potter. Now it belonged to Draco Malfoy.
“It’s not about trust, Harry,” Hermione said softly. “It’s about discrediting you. It has always been about that. You have to speak up, Harry, shout if you must, until people start listening to you again. We’ll make them hear. I know there are lots of people who don’t believe in The Daily Prophet the same way as before, especially after Fudge.”
Harry smiled and leant forward, kissing Draco’s lips tenderly. Draco smiled back. He felt like his heart could explode of happiness.
Harry looked at Nathan with desperation. He couldn’t leave his son alone; it didn’t matter if he was Toledo or anyone else. But on the other hand, his husband was in danger, and if he got out, he could save Draco and Lily. Harry’s heart was never so torn in his whole life. He felt like screaming.
He promised himself he wouldn’t be the one doing all the pleading and there he was, doing exactly that.
‘We have flats upstairs for Aurors that are single, or just for travellers and guests,’ Candelaria explained. ‘It’s much better than any hotel.’
“I didn’t expect you to turn against your old mates, Malfoy, let alone protect two innocent children against them.”
I was really losing my mind. Maybe I should schedule an appointment in St Mungus. Astoria might suggest that for sure. Her husband was becoming a loony.
Listening to Harry admit he needed me even if it wasn’t exactly the way I wanted him to made my heart race.
He parked the car near the cemetery and walked through the graves until he spotted the one he was looking for. He sat in front of it and just stayed there until the nightfall. He had lied to Draco. He had a secret. He had many secrets in fact. One of them was the fact that Draco was the love of his life long before their sixth year. The other was that he had almost given up on his fight against Voldemort, and the reason was right in front of him.
Harry laughed. “I kind of suspected that. Hermione is not very good at hiding secrets from Ron or me. I didn’t mind when she told me, and I don’t mind now. I’m glad you told me. And I’m glad that you went for it, otherwise we wouldn’t be here today, married.”
Again, the stranger took Harry’s shaft inside his mouth, speeding his movements. Harry’s knees were jellying.  It was like all his bones were dissolving until there were no more left. He came, gasping for air and needing help to remain steady.
Nostrums rolled his eyes. “Sure. Go ahead. If you really think you can end years and years of hate and malice in just a few minutes... go ahead and try.”
Draco watched Fred’s desolation and wondered if there was more than friendship between Jordan and him.
Draco felt Harry’s body going rigid, so he decided to drop the subject. “I’m sorry. I’m just trying to understand what happened. Do you think Nathan locked up Nostrums again? What do you think happened that day after they sent you out of the magical dimension?”
Bob frowned. “What’re you talking about? You’ve always hidden information from the rest of the staff!”
Two guards led Draco from the dungeons to a large room on the second floor, fully decorated with ancient objects. Draco’s father used to possess a similar collection under Malfoy Manor. They were predominantly Egyptian, but some of them belonged to the time of druids, and all of them, with a few exceptions, were dark magic objects. There was a particular rounded object on the central table that glowed softly in the dim light that Draco didn’t recognise. Harry’s double stood by its side as if he was enchanted by it.
The wedding cake had been wonderful. Hermione had added a little of Draco’s ice cream on the stuffing just to make sure. She had found out that Draco put a magical ingredient in all of his ice creams to make people feel light-headed and happy after a hard day of work. He had assured it wasn’t anything dangerous, but Harry had been really angry with him at first. Eventually he had agreed that people indeed looked a lot happier after savouring the ice creams and that wasn’t a bad thing. Some sweets from Honeydukes had a similar effect on people and no one seemed to care.
"Then take me away. I've already got what I wanted for Christmas," Harry whispered, stealing another kiss from Draco.
“A Polyjuice potion, you said... It makes sense since I haven’t been downtown today. I was at the ice-cream parlour almost all day. You can ask Daphne if you want to. Hell, he can ask her!”
“I was… I had a call from work… So I took Nathan and… But I didn’t know! How was I supposed to know that today would be the day?” Harry stuttered. He bit his lower lip until he tasted blood when Draco gripped his hand hard. “Isn’t it too soon?” he asked.
He knew that big mansion like the palm of his hands. He had stayed many times there after Ron and Hermione had married and had bought it together. He didn’t even care for the fact that he was walking through the corridors naked. He burst into Hermione and Ron’s room without knocking and shook them until they were fully awake.
My mind got filled with past memories of Hogwarts. The other man lowered his wand. It was strange to see Goyle giving another person orders and being promptly obeyed. I was the one who used to do that.
He cursed under his breath. What was his father doing there? First Nathan had had a bad feeling and then Lucius had shown up, very discretely, but out in the open. Someone could see him and he didn’t seem to care. And why did Nathan know his name? Perhaps that had something to do with the fact that he was a Mage.
“Oh, yes, you do. I already confiscated a few suspicious items that were sent by Fred and George. Harry, you confiscate the rest, especially anything that comes from the twins’ joke shop. I don’t want you to get in trouble your first day of school, Nathan.”
To make things worse, Nathan didn’t say anything. He just stared at Draco, perhaps trying to understand the relationship he had with Harry. Merlin! How would he explain to him that?
If that wasn’t a muggle building, then the inside may be completely different from the exterior. I dared to hope.
His words cut me like a knife. I remained as impassive as I could. If Astoria could see me now, I guess she would be proud.
Ever since Draco came back to his house after his encounter with Harry, he was feeling terribly ill. His head and body ached, and he was barely standing on his feet. The cold had finally got to him a big time, probably because he was too weak to fight it. He took an aspirin, crumbled down on his fluffy king-sized bed and wrapped himself in the blankets. His mind quickly drifted away, and he drowned in a delirious state of unconsciousness caused by the high fever. After a while, he was sweating all over his body, and he started to babble incoherently, mostly about his past as a Death Eater.
Fred made a disappointed face. He was hoping Jonas could tell him something about Lee’s location. Lee had always told him that Jonas knew a lot about the dark world.
He turned his back on Harry again, punched the pillow a few times and closed his eyes. Harry watched the scene with amusement and at the end of the show, he laughed. Draco tightened his eyes even more, counting to ten to prevent himself from beating Harry to a pulp.
“They found out Angel could talk to snakes a year ago. For a boy his age, he’s extremely skilful with magic. Some boys of the Death Gang reported the news to The Almighty group and they were ecstatic. Apparently, there’s a prophecy...”
That wasn’t enough to convince him, though. He knew he would regret it. And Harry would never forgive him.
He sighed tiredly. The anger in his eyes was still there, though. For a brief moment, he let me see just how drained he looked. He had been really concerned about me, hadn’t he? It was something that I had always hoped for, but it was shocking to actually witness it nonetheless.
I held the letter tighter and shrugged. He gave another step in my direction. Was the room shrinking by any chance? I swallowed hard. Another step, then another, and next thing I knew we were only a few inches apart from each other.
Of course it was. He couldn’t be rejecting me now of all times. We had come so far. That wasn’t what Harry meant, however. He was just worried about me and my health. I noticed that in his eyes.
“Yeah. And I let it slip that you were planning something romantic for his birthday. So, you see? This is why I think it’s weird that he’s cheating on you. Especially today. He loves you so much. It doesn’t make any sense!”
“Maybe. I’m just trying to help. I’ve already waved the white flag. I’m in touch with Matthew. He seems ready to cooperate with us.”
‘I’m not sure we’ll have everything Your Highness desires, but you can rest assure about your safety. Although…’ She went silent and glanced at Harry and he signalled her not to say anything. I was intrigued and annoyed. ‘Well, I hope you have a lovely stay. Harry certainly will. I’m not sure you’ll find the experience amusing or terrifying, though.’
As usual, his phone rang to interrupt us. I bit my lower lip. Harry seemed taken aback for a moment. When he pulled himself together, he answered the call. His eyes changed. They got softer despite the guilt they harboured. It wasn’t Ginny Weasley, but Lilly, his younger daughter. I didn’t want to feel jealous and anger, but I was only human.
“I’m really sorry, Harry,” Saulus said, his voice still annoyingly serene. “I know it isn’t enough, but Lucius is right. It was necessary. Besides, we knew what we were doing. Nathan is perfect, Harry. It was a success in every way.”
“Shut up!” Harry exclaimed, turning his attention to Nathan. He was still stunned about the whole thing and felt as if he was living a weird dream. “If you never had combat skills, then how did you lock him up in the past?”
Harry felt like going for his throat. Who they thought they were to play with people’s lives like that?
“I wouldn’t be so sure. If there’s one person in the world you can count on, that someone is Harry Potter. I know you think he’s at fault here, but you know it’s not true.”
Draco shrugged. “I don’t know. I’d have gone home. But before that, I would have knocked you out and tied you up in that chair near the window.”
“Just go back to your husband. I bet he needs you. Tomorrow we will figure out what to do. Moony will know what to do. He always does.”
His rage increased to a point that the windows started to shake and he got out of the bedroom quickly. He was glad Draco didn’t follow him. He needed to be alone to calm down. He knew what happened when he got out of control. His magic flowed out of him unbalanced and things usually broke or blew up. He entered the first room he found and started smashing things until he tumbled down on the floor overtired.
I had never paid much attention to the Albus Dumbledore Foundation for Children in Need. I told myself it was because I didn’t want to be near Harry in any way. But the fact was that I had stayed away for my own selfish reasons.
He didn't. He was the sort of person who had never really had to do anything on his own. But he was a smart bloke. He could think of something else. Unfortunately, he wasn't fast enough, and Harry caught him by his waist before he could have a proper reaction. As he felt those arms embracing him, something warm and fuzzy wrapped around his heart, and he felt as if it would burst out of his chest.
Neville didn’t say anything. He took his wand from his valise, muttered a spell Harry didn’t know and passed it over Draco’s body. Harry felt his vision blurring and his eyes filling with tears. The memories of his son’s death, which was still fresh inside his head, suddenly fell heavily down on him like an avalanche for the second time that day. This wasn’t happening, he told himself. He couldn’t even think about losing Draco as well. Not now, not ever. If Draco died, he would die with him.
He wished to see the face of the person he was about to have sex with, but there was something very erotic about having sex with a complete stranger without actually seeing his countenance - except for the beautiful and expressive eyes and the red and succulent lips.
I tried to get rid of the uncomfortable memories brought back by my days at Hogwarts by focusing on more mudane things, like Harry’s physical attributes. It was difficult not to keep on staring at his strong profile. Harry was wearing typical muggle clothes: jeans and a black jumper.
“Why would I? I said I would do it and I will! I always keep my word! And don’t look at me like that! Besides, I already told Astoria and the boys about it. Angel is very happy.”
“Just because you’re Harry Potter, it doesn’t mean I trust you! We’re in this situation because of you! It’s all your fault! It’s your fault my father’s gone! It’s your fault my mother...”
I watched everything on the inside. On the outside, I could imagine how frustrated they were for looking at a wall without seeing anything. I heard them grumble, but I refused to let them in.  I smiled wickedly and it must have been scary because the house-elf by my side shivered a little bit.
Now, ironically, he’d have to turn to Draco for help. Seamus had been missing for a week. Dean had been to his apartment, only to find it empty. Seamus was nowhere to be found. No one had seen him in his favourite spots.
I was a possessive bastard. I wanted Harry all to myself. I was never good at sharing things. Blame it on my upbringing. The way Harry was looking at me now made me feel like a petulant child, and I couldn’t deny that. But my heart was filled with jealousy and possessiveness. I wasn’t ok with Ginny Weasley, but that was a reality I had to accept. I wouldn’t be ok with anyone else claiming Harry for themselves. I was the only one allowed to make Harry desire me so much to the point of letting his perfect husband persona aside.
“Ready for our training section, Malfoy?” Harry asked with a smile. My heart pounded hard in my chest.
"Hey, boy," Draco called him and the large dog jumped near them. "Harry? I wonder what would have happened if we both had stopped pretending at the time and just surrendered to the moment."
He brought Harry’s body closer to his and touched their lips tenderly. He kept the soft movement for a while, inflaming Harry’s need. Harry sighed, frustrated.
Harry grabbed furiously and the tip of our noses touched. His green eyes were dark. My whole body turned to jelly.
The tallest of them shook his head. "You do have a choice, but if you come with us, you’ll have the chance to meet with the person you want. I mean, you do want to meet him, don’t you?"
“Gee! Ron is the one behaving like an insufferable git.” Harry laughed. “Look! His mother is coming to rescue Ginny.”
Draco’s moaning and the cadence of his hips made Harry move inside him frantically. Draco’s nails scratched Harry’s back when he came. Harry’s body trembled a few seconds later in ecstasy.
There was a brief moment of silence. Harry turned to Louis and told him something that made the man leave the room. Alfred freaked out when he saw the Auror walking away.
I felt so alive. My body was on fire again. It was unbelievable. I wanted him again, and again, and again. I didn’t even realise when exactly I got on top of him and began moving slowly and then swiftly. I wasn’t the only one enjoying the ride. Harry was as keen as me to start our love dance again. I smiled.
Harry looked behind him and smiled feebly at the figure of his son with his thumb in his mouth. He knelt down on the floor as Nathan ran to him, and folded the little one protectively in his arms.
“I don’t care about your stupid motives!” Harry shouted. “Nathan is my son! You had no right to decide his fate for him! The experience could have gone terribly wrong and then what?”
"Because I heard this weird conversation about balls, blow jobs and..." Ron stopped talking when Hermione slapped his arm. "Ouch! Why did you do that?"
"He's my friend and he's never looked at me with interest. What you're saying makes no sense whatsoever! He's the most reliable Auror of my division and he's straight! You saw his girlfriend. They looked very much in love to me! Besides, you decided that you didn't like him long before you met him!"
“We can discuss Eerie later. I’m sure you and Harry want to rest a little. You must be exhausted,” Sirius said.
"A lot," Lucius answered, "But this is not the time for this discussion. If you want, you can stay for the night. I think you’re in trouble Draco, for your association with Potter. I thought you knew about Nathan, but now I realise that you don’t. And neither does Harry Potter if I’m not mistaken. How curious."
What pleased him the most was to see the people in Hogwarts-land always preoccupied with their little troubles. He enjoyed watching them from his castle, little dots running around, worried about Lord Voldemort's tyrannical demands.
I sighed. Astoria was one of the only people in the whole world who knew about my sordid little secret. She honestly worried about me. I wished I could love her more than anything.
The foolish muggles thought they had it, or at least part of it, in a museum in London. It was a 24 metres papyrus which contained wondrous things but lacked the truly interesting bit: magic spells and potions that could make a person run away screaming or smile wickedly with delight. Or so they say. The whole papyrus was probably 50 metres long. It was obviously bigger and better. It was a door to another world.
“There are places that are a lot worse than this one, like the Death Valley in Romania or the Giants Mountain, or wherever the Dementors are,” he joked. I smiled a bit, my heart feeling lighter as I noticed his smile. So I finally looked at him. Harry seemed relaxed. His face was serene. However, if you looked closer, you could see that he had bag under his beautiful eyes and he seemed to be tired. “You’ve lost a lot of weight,” he said to my utter surprise.
He heard the bell ringing and Brutus barking in welcome. He opened the door wearing a cold and threatening look in case it was Harry. But it was Hermione looking sympathetic to his sadness. It was obvious by the way she hugged him that she knew what had happened.
I felt cold, but it wasn’t because of the weather. The cold was coming from the inside. I crossed my arms. Harry got closer as he felt my discomfort. I could feel the heat irradiating from his body. I wanted to draw him closer. My desire to draw nearer was so strong that I took a step forward. Curiously, Harry didn’t step back.
Harry bit his lower lip and hid a smile. “I don’t mind that you call me Mr Malfoy, Draco, but remember that I’m still Potter,” he said.
“It’s not your fault, Harry,” Ron cut him off. “And we didn’t know if it was really dangerous to stay here.”
Harry didn't complain. In fact, he adored every minute of it. They got lost inside each other once more and soon a full intense orgasm took over their bodies.
“His name sounds familiar. Saulus… I think I heard it somewhere. Maybe he was a Death Eater. I should ask Seamus about it. He might remember someone with that name. As for Bob, I think he’s the one helping frame Harry. I mean, did you notice his behaviour today? He was playing the devil’s advocate. Encouraging Harry to lose his temper! I felt like murdering the bastard!”
As I thought about the episode, and how icy Harry’s voice must have sounded when dealing with that issue, I smiled. Of course that bunch of good for nothings wouldn’t have the courage to forbid Granger to soil their precious Club with her presence. She was, after all, one of Harry’s best friends. Whatever Harry wanted he had it. Not to mention that Granger really was a brilliant witch. Still, wasn’t it strange that the Club had let them in just now?
I slowly turned around. Our bodies almost touched. I shivered slightly. I hoped he thought I was just cold.
“Where the hell did they go when I opened the bloody door?” Draco asked, infuriated. “All right. You get dressed, for Merlin’s sake. And then help Nathan.”
“I’ve discovered some interesting things about you, things that have intrigued me. For example, I’ve found out that you’ve barely left the Manor in quite a while.”
Brutus barked and scratched Draco’s bedroom door. Draco smiled and stood up carefully, supporting his big belly with one hand. He opened the door for Brutus and the dog greeted him happily by waggling his tail. Brutus didn’t jump on Draco anymore. Harry had almost killed Brutus once for jumping on Draco’s chest at the beginning of his pregnancy, so now Brutus behaved more cautiously – clearly afraid of Harry’s threats.
Remus looked at him embarrassed. “That’s your godfather’s... assumption. I don’t know where he got this idea that Severus and I are together!”
“No! I won’t wait outside!” Harry exclaimed, upset. His son had just opened his eyes. He had the right to stay with him. “I’m not going anywhere.”
“I don’t believe you. And how many times do I have to tell you that it isn’t Voldemort they want back?” he practically growled.
Harry seemed to know what was going through my head because he smiled to himself briefly. It was quite a sexy smile.
Draco asked himself for the tenth time if he was doing the right thing. He would probably call himself stupid over and over when the whole thing ended – if he made it out alive – but he just had to do it. He just had to know what Lucius was up to for real, and he needed to confront him alone. So when Saulus had written to him that same morning asking him to meet Lucius at ‘Magical Park’, the infamous favourite ex-Death Eater’s spot, he just had to go.
Harry had tears in his eyes. He knew Nathan was extraordinary but he had never imagined something like that.
He finally looked at my hands still holding him, and I blushed and let him go. I don’t think I’d ever felt so embarrassed in my whole life. I would be extremely happy if the floor opened up and swallowed me.
‘Time for you to go back home,’ he replied harshly. ‘I’ve already had a chat with your wife. You have a flight to catch tomorrow.’
Nathan raised himself from the floor. “I’ll send you to the Temple, and there you will face a trial.” Nathan’s face saddened. “You killed and disturbed too many people. You’ll have to pay for your sins.”
“No.” Draco breathed deeply but decided not to say the harsh words that were at the tip of his tongue.
“I know you don’t want my pity,” Nathan said, cutting across him. “I don’t pity you. You’re right about calling me a hypocrite. Perhaps I am. But even though I feel your suffering, I still believe in love. What you felt for me... It wasn’t love. Love isn’t supposed to hurt.”
“Hey, sweetheart, let Harry do his job, alright? He’s the Auror here, not you,” Bob patronised and Draco stared at him in disbelief.
Harry finally sat down, but far away from me. He looked worried and distressed. It was as if I wasn’t there. He was immersed in his own dark thoughts. I decided to go on even though he might not be listening.
She sighed. They’d tried to find Draco that same way many times, but it never worked. Wherever Draco was being kept prisoner, it was full of magical wards. Still, for Harry’s sake, she tried once more. A faint light appeared on the map and then died away. Harry’s sad expression broke her heart.
Alfred rolled his eyes as he caught his brother’s hand. As he led him out of the room, I heard him say, ‘I’ll tell you a story.’
“I haven’t seen you in years. For a moment, I thought you were your father. How can I help you?” he asked with his throaty voice.
“He didn’t exactly say hello to us, Potter,” Lucius said, upset. “But it was written in the prophecy that someone would set him free.”
My heart broke into small pieces. I wanted to hold him tightly, but I was afraid of being turned down.
Harry looked the other way not really sure. “Nope… I think I left it inside my drawer at the office…”
"I need to have a word with Uncle Gigi about that," Draco told himself. "In the meantime, I’ll put something on it that I think you’ll like."
Hermione sighed. “I hope you’re right. Because I don’t think Harry can handle another tragedy in his life.”
I froze. Whatever Harry was thinking, it could not be good. Could it? Should I keep my hopes up and my fears at bay? Hope was, after all, the only thing left under the circumstances.
It was then that Brutus appeared, covered in mud. Draco sighed. Brutus had been digging in the yard again. He saw Brutus stop and stare at Nathan, who stared back at the dog. After an initial inspection, Brutus started to walk in the direction of Nathan, but Draco held him by his collar.
I felt exhausted, so I leaned against a wall for a moment. What happened next was completely unexpected. A boy came running out of nowhere and grabbed my robe. He looked about five years old. He was very small, with chestnut hair and big green eyes. His face was shaped like a heart, and he was all dirty. My disgust was as strong as my fatherly instinct. His dirty little hands made me nauseated, but his green eyes stopped me from getting away. His eyes looked so much like Harry’s...
“I’m fine, mum, don’t worry. You all need to get out. There are remaining Death Eaters at the front door. It’s awful. Sir,” Fred called the Minister of Justice, who seemed to be as scared as the others, “Is there a passage somewhere that it’s safe?”
The cell’s door flew open, and a tall, dark figure entered. Bob stood up at once, and Draco noticed that his placid eyes didn’t seem so docile anymore. Bob’s tense posture was a sign that the man in front of them was a threat. But Draco only saw the man he loved, the man that had swept him away.
Dean looked at him with his eyes full of concern. “I’m here because I thought you could tell me where I could find Seamus.”
My smile was sincere. Angel and Alfred had been in my life for a small period of time, but they were already a part of my daily routine. I wasn’t bothered by their presence anymore. I’d even got used to Alfred’s mood swings and thought he was amusing. Perhaps I really wanted them to stay in my life forever. I was positive Astoria wouldn’t mind them staying.
Hermione wanted to point out that Harry’s magic had been unbalanced ever since Draco had been missing, but thanks to Ron and a nudge in her back, she kept her mouth shut. Harry hadn’t slept for three days now. His eyes were puffy and it seemed as if he hadn’t changed his clothes for the same amount of time.
“Merlin!” Bob exclaimed with his eyes widely open. “Harry works fast, huh? This isn’t good. I had a cousin who was pregnant, and he had a few complications during the first three months… Imagine if he had been hit by evil curses!”
“I know you’ve been suffering from some sort of magical deficiency caused perhaps by those psychiatric problems you’ve been facing all these years.”
“No! What the hell do you think you’re doing, Harry? Do you want to be arrested, is that it? Because the council will be more than happy to have another accusation against you! They think you’ve lost your mind. Do you want to prove their point by blowing up the Dursleys’ door?”
I took it in my hands. Harry was still holding it. I felt a pleasant tingle though my body as we touched. My eyes searched for his, which were staring at me intensely. My wand seemed to have created a powerful connection between us, and I wonder if he could feel it. This wand didn’t belong to me anymore. It had bowed to Harry’s greatness and became as much in love with him as I was. I couldn’t blame it for leaving me so easily.
“I’m flattered by your trust, but I also trust my men. Besides, I have an agent spying for me from the inside of The Almighty group. I’ll be the first to know if they decide to attack.”
“Boo-hoo! How touching!” Nostrums snarled. “If you don’t mind, undo the spell you cast on me so I can puke!”
“Perhaps. But my wand has been in your possession for ages. I think it doesn’t recognize me anymore as its owner.”
“Wait a minute. You said they had tried to get pregnant on their own. Does that mean that the pregnancy has to be assisted? It’s not common?” Harry’s mind was working furiously. “Then how did you get pregnant? Did you decide to be a father without even talking to me?”
Until now, Nathan hadn’t said a word about the whole thing. He couldn’t understand why his Aunt and Uncle had lied to him about his father. They said his parents were dead but the stranger had just denied it. That man who looked just like him was claiming to be his father and wanted to take him away. He was scared but also relieved. Any place would be better than the Dursley household.
“Oh, that’s just priceless! I should have known that you would bring your lover with you,” Sirius accused and Draco and Harry gasped a ‘WHAT?’
What he couldn’t understand was why he was the one locked up in a cell and not those bastards who had helped Fudge in his cruel scheme to separate him from his son. They should be arrested, not him. Harry knew for sure that at least three members of the council were involved in the episode thanks to the papers he had discovered in the Ministry’s files. He was hoping that Draco had hidden them very well.
“Stop it, Colin!” Harry shouted. “It doesn’t have to be this way. You didn’t lure me here. I came on my own free will. Horace suspected you, so I thought I should talk to you. I didn’t expect this, but now that I know Nostrums is here I won’t run. You’re under his command. You did nothing wrong. He’s the bastard, not you! You tried to fight him.”
Harry wiped his tears away and only answered when he was sure that he wouldn't burst laughing again. "You! You came to steal me away? That's precious! And how in the world will you do that?"
The images stopped abruptly, and Nathan collapsed with hands and knees on the ground, worn out. He wasn’t the only one. His spell had exhausted Nostrums as well.
A door opened and a distinctive man came in. He didn’t look like Lucius though. He wasn’t as tall as Lucius and he also didn’t have blond hair. But something about the way he walked made Draco suspect about him. His heart skipped a bit as he stared at Saulus Fimcyl.
“Not anymore. You should’ve been more discreet if you didn’t want anyone to know what you were doing.”
‘The game is over, Malfoy. You’re going home and there’s nothing you can do or say that will convince me otherwise.’
We returned to the main house together. Angel, who by now had almost completely lost his shyness, was speaking nonstop about his adventures around the Manor – which were always closely watched by two Aurors, but also by Astoria. Out of the corner of my eyes, I saw Alfred smiling at his brother. He looked so peaceful that I couldn’t help but smile, too.
Harry came to my aid with a glass of water and helped me drink it. We stared at one another challengingly.
“I won’t take the things you did lightly, but your soul can still be saved. Besides, I believe in second chances. Go face your fears now, and be a winner, Nostrums. I’ll be waiting for you.”
With his free hand, Nathan took Draco’s and squeezed it. He looked at Draco with a smile and muttered the word ‘baby’ softly, so softly that they almost didn’t hear it. Draco stared at him, trying to understand what that was all about but Nathan refused to say anything else so they let him rest.
I shivered. It was the first time I felt Harry’s touch on my skin with such tenderness. I was shocked.
And then the sad post-ecstasy came. It was even worse because I was all alone. I felt lazy. I should get up and clean myself, but I didn’t want to get rid of what I saw was proof that I was alive. In the end, I just couldn’t take feeling all sticky. I risked a spell. It came out perfectly. Since I was already exhausted, it didn’t really matter.
Bob appeared next to them and as he stared at Draco, he suddenly opened up his eyes wide and exclaimed, “Shoot! I just remembered! You’re pregnant! You shouldn’t be here!”
Once again I turned my back on him. I refrained from running to the bedroom and slamming the door on his face.
He dropped on his knee and the stranger kissed him intensely, allowing Harry to feel his own flavour.
Harry tried hard not to laugh, but he couldn’t resist. Draco seemed outraged by that, so he pushed Harry away, crossed his arms and sulked. “What’s so damn funny? I’m horny, you know? Horny people do stupid things like trying to seduce their partners, who don’t seem to give a damn.”
Draco thought for a moment if accepting was a stupid thing to do. If Saulus was his father, then he was relatively safe. Lucius had been ambitious and dishonest most of the time, but he hadn’t been a killer or so Draco thought. Harry was wrong when he assumed that Draco had framed his father. He hadn’t. He hadn’t been capable of that, no matter how bad Lucius had been to him and his mother.
Harry didn’t say anything though. He didn’t know why it was so hard for him to say what his lover wanted to hear from his mouth. He licked his dry lips and swallowed with difficulty. He didn’t know what he would do if Draco got out of the door. He was lost.
“Seam, I love you,” Dean confessed hastily. “I know I don’t deserve your love, but I think I can be worthy of you if you give me a chance.”
“Why don’t we just knock on the door?” Hermione advised, raising her hand and doing exactly that, “Honestly, that’s the first and logical measure. If this doesn’t work, then you can do the wizard’s way.”
“I will. I have an appointment next week to see Dr Jules. He’s a friend of Snape and he’s used to dealing with male pregnancy for ten years now. He seems nice and very competent.”
Nobody answered him, and with the commotion around, it would have been impossible to do so. Everyone was worried about their own necks. Nostrums’ servants were very strong, and if they didn’t look out, they could be seriously hurt. Gripping his wand firmly, Draco joined the battle with the force of an angry lion. He didn’t care how many men he stunned. It was him or them, and he had his baby to protect.
Draco smiled even wider and he approached Harry to kiss him. “You are the best husband in the world.”
Nathan watched as the man touched his face gently, almost scared that he would run away if he wasn’t careful. But Nathan didn’t want to run away. He wanted to know why the stranger, who was now crying and mumbling something incoherently, looked so much like him. But most of all, he wanted to know why looking at the stranger made him feel like he was finally home.
Harry went totally red, which made him incredibly adorable. He mumbled something I couldn’t get and left the room as if he was being chased away by demons. I was intrigued.
“It’s not wanna, sweetie,” Sirius corrected him gently. “It’s want. And no, you can’t have it! This isn’t good for you! Here,” Sirius took out a chocolate frog from his pocket and gave it to Nathan. “This is more appropriate for you.”
We were interrupted by the arrival of my Healer, followed by Astoria, Angel and Alfred. I was annoyed. Why was it that Harry and I were always interrupted at the most crucial moments?
Harry shrugged. “I don’t care if your baby looks like any other baby,” he said to shut Ron up. “My baby looks just like Draco. She’s beautiful.”
As though he heard his son’s plea, Harry suddenly yawned and opened his eyes. He almost fell off his chair when he saw that Nathan was awake and looked as though he had been crying. Harry rose from his chair immediately, almost knocking it over. His eyes suddenly filled with tears and he seemed unable to speak.
Satisfied that his husband was on his way home, Harry was about to go upstairs to take a shower when he was interrupted by the ringing doorbell. Since it couldn’t be Draco, and the wards hadn’t pointed out anything unusual, he opened it while surreptitiously hiding his wand in his pocket. To his surprise, it was Bob.
“I’m sorry. I just... It’s not your fault, Ron. It’s mine, actually. I should have never left Draco here all alone! What was I thinking? I knew it was dangerous and...”
I had slept with Astoria for a few years after we got married. The sexual act had been satisfying but rather empty. As time went by we decided to sleep in separate rooms so we could have more privacy, and our sexual life ceased to exist.
Colin winced. “We didn’t know… When we opened that ark… Ernie and I… We didn’t know what was inside. We didn’t mean to, Harry, but we released Nostrums. Do you know who Nostrums is?” Harry nodded, and Colin went on, “He possessed Ernie and made me his slave. But Ernie started to fight against him, and when Nostrums finally got a body of his own, he killed Ernie.” Colin cried. “I was too weak to fight him. I let Ernie die…”
"I still can’t believe that Nathan wrote your father’s name on that piece of paper. I thought that Lucius was dead, Draco," said Hermione.
But the “routine” procedure lasted a lot longer than Harry expected, and by the time Neville came to talk to him and Draco in the waiting room, Harry had almost bitten all his nails off. He cornered Neville immediately and Neville didn’t know if he should laugh or be afraid.
My mouth contorted in a bitter smile. I was indeed pretty arrogant if I still thought that I was better than the great Harry Potter.
Saulus played with a glass snow globe. His coolness made Draco very nervous. He frowned, wishing that the guy felt as apprehensive as he did.
“I’ll buy you an ice-cream!” Harry said, trying to buy her off. She didn’t let go of Nathan, though.
Draco not only saw but he also felt that Harry was losing grip of reality fast as he rocked his body against his hand, and that he soon would come all over his belly. He didn’t slow down his hand movements though. He wanted so badly to see Harry losing control.
Draco opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out of it. He slowly put his hand on his flat belly, stroking it gently, thinking if Lucius had just lost his mind once and for all or if he was carrying a baby. A sudden certainty came upon him. He was pregnant with Harry’s baby and to him, that was a miracle. He would give birth to his and Harry’s child.
She sighed. “Be careful, Draco. You have to think about someone else’s health. Don’t do anything stupid.”
I regret to say that we were put in completely different rooms. They weren’t even next to each other. Also, I had to watch silently as Candelaria pulled Harry away with a grin and a look of desire that made me sick to my stomach.
It seemed as if Lily had heard him because for half an hour Draco didn’t feel any pain. He was having another contraction when the front door opened and Harry came in with Nathan.
“I wouldn’t be so worried about that. That kind of brain activity has been documented in kids with telekinesis. Wizards don’t really like to talk about it because telekinesis is not the same as magic and we know nothing about it. Actually, the brain remains a mystery to us.”
“I’m afraid so. He didn’t say that but what else could it be? He can’t have Nathan anymore. I guess Nathan is too old to be controlled.”
Draco flinched, wondering why he was yelling at Harry when in fact Harry had been nothing but patient and tender to him that week. He had to admit that Harry was trying his best not to lose patience around him or yell for stupid reasons. Draco had been doing that instead.
"I’m just saying that you need to talk to Draco first. You can’t just drop everything! I know what you’re trying to do, Harry, but you can’t run away. It’s neither right nor fair to your son and to your husband."
I forgot about Harry for a while when Angel appeared next to me with a worried look. I stroked his face tenderly.
Sure it began as just sex but Harry’s heart was too involved in the act to pretend that it was just an unattached sex-act to fulfil his most primitive need. It was much more than that.
Nathan didn’t look at him. His eyes were gazing at Harry and two other hooded figures that were surrounding him. Draco shouted for Harry, who looked at him shocked. He couldn’t believe Draco had disobeyed his orders. But when he followed Draco’s concerned look, he understood why.
“Oh, shut up Ron,” said Hermione. Ron made a face and she added, “I mean, sweet-pumpkin, that Harry experienced a new thing last night and I’m sure he’ll tell you all about it later. Please, don’t be mad at him. I was the one that put him in this mess.”
Interesting. Harry was worried, I could tell. I kept smiling, which only made him confused and irritated.
Her fear was justifiable. The Malfoy family did not have the same prestige as before, quite the contrary. Ever since the war, despite our last minute desertion, we had been labelled as Death Eaters, and we would forever be Death Eaters. People stared and whispered as we walked by. Some were openly aggressive. The wizarding world hated those of pureblood now, especially those who had supported the Dark Lord, and they loved those that were born of muggle parents.
Silence. All I could hear were steps coming from the corridor. I thought somebody was going to enter the room, but no one did. Harry and I were completely alone.
“I missed you, too, my emerald.” They kissed slowly, savouring each other’s mouth. “Come inside me, Harry. Now,” Draco whispered against Harry’s cherry-red lips.
His girlfriend and future bride to be, Narcissa Malfoy, said a few words and Draco almost cried as he remembered the hell they had been through. Narcissa and Sirius as a couple had been a wonderful surprise to them, and Draco and Harry were glad that they were happy together.
I slowly made my way to the bathroom, wincing here and there. When I glanced at myself in the mirror I was taken aback. There were red marks everywhere. Bites and kisses left by Harry tattooed many parts of my body. I grinned kinkily. I was glad they were there, proof of our sex night, an incredible night, magical, one I would never forget. My eyes seemed alive as well, not that dull grey they normally were.
“Did you hear a word I said? Dammit, Malfoy! This isn’t going to work!” Harry started pacing impatiently. “I wasn’t happy to find out that to put my hands on the Book of the Dead I’d need your help, but what am I supposed to do? Hermione made it quite clear when she said that only a Malfoy can open the chamber where the book is, and only a Malfoy can break its curse. Others will be pulverised, and I’m guessing they meant literally. I told her I wasn’t afraid and that you are in no condition to...”
“Don’t you think I deserve to know? I saved those kids’ lives! I went to Knockturn Alley to obtain information for you!” I let on.
Draco was led through endless corridors until they finally left him inside of a luxurious and immense room. He recognised the expensive painting on the wall, which used to belong to his father. Immediately, he knew that Saulus was Lucius Malfoy just by the decoration of the room. Every little object reminded him of his father.
I picked up some jeans I had bought in one of the most expensive muggle stores in London, and an Armani cashmere sweater. Though I continued to look sick, at least I was well-dressed. I had to keep my Malfoy dignity intact.
An oppressive silence surrounded the room. Finally, Ron patted Seamus back and asked him if he wanted to get a cup of coffee down the street and go over the old days at Hogwarts. He quickly accepted because he knew Ron was doing that to leave Draco and Harry alone. He stood up and left, Ron talking about a party to reunite everyone from Gryffindor House.
I wanted to touch him so badly. My mouth was having a hard time keeping up with Harry’s hunger for mine. His hands ripped off my robe and I saw myself almost naked. I felt cold despite the lit up fireplace. I was sure, though, that my body was trembling for other reasons. My nipples got hard. I moaned when I felt Harry’s hands caressing them. The pleasure drew a path of fire on my skin and got between my thighs. I felt like a teenager being touched for the first time. If he continued I would soon cum. And by Merlin, how I wish he continued for an eternity.
“Your son is very special, Harry,” Neville said as soon as they were left alone. “Very. I should take Nathan to see someone more qualified but… Well, it’s obvious that something is going on or you wouldn’t be here.”
As they entered Gringotts, some of the small creatures with swarthy faces, pointed beards and long hands stared at Draco with suspicion. They probably knew about his past and they were wondering what he was doing there with the great Harry Potter by his side. Draco smirked. It had been a while since he'd been to the wizard's bank. He had an account there but he didn't use it. He didn't feel the need to use their money – wizard money – since he had been living as a Muggle.
He turned around and his eyes came across someone else’s eyes at the other side of the room. Like being pulled by an invisible and stronger force he came closer to the person, ignoring everyone else. It was the strangest feeling of his entire life when he faced the mysterious person, who had a silver-blue mask hiding his face and a black cloak covering his hair and body, and looked deep inside the silver-blue orbs that glittered dazzlingly. Harry felt shivers running down his spine. To his surprised - and joy - his chubby cherubim got out of the card invitation and met the cherubim of the mysterious and sexy person, playing a song that now sounded like heaven to Harry, and uniting them with an invisible twinkling-silver thread.
“I don’t know, Harry. I really believe him when he says he has nothing to do with the Death Eaters. I think we have another enemy besides him and that’s why he wants me to stay away. The person controlling the Death Eaters is his enemy as well.”
Draco put Harry back into the Mine Cart and before they went back to the bank's entrance, he took the letter in his hands. He even forgot about the dizziness he felt every time he was in the damn cart and only had eyes for the letter. He was shocked, to say the least, as he read that Harry's son was alive.
“Yes, but mostly, your child is a Malfoy and a Potter. Your child is a Malfoy’s heir. Are you following me?”
“Their leader. He’s 24 years old and is Walden Macnair’s grandson,” Harry answered. “When his grandfather was arrested, his family fell apart. His grandmother ran away to Romania where she had relatives, taking only her younger daughter with her. The eldest son was recruited by Voldemort but he failed and was killed because of it. Matthew’s mother...”
“Not now, Harry. I’m really not in the mood. In case you haven’t noticed, my life is falling apart.”
“Just shut up!” this time Draco was the one who shouted. “You’re lying about your reasons and we are not stupid to buy it! You just want the money! You don’t care about Nathan!”
“He’s taking a shower. He was so dirty, Draco! I fear to think of what these boys must have gone through till now...” she shivered. “He’s so cute. But he’s frightened, and I should go to where he is. I left him with Lara.”
I felt my whole body stiff. So he knew about everything. I wondered if he knew I was seeing a psychiatrist. It was possible. Nothing escaped Harry Potter’s tiger-eyes. However, I seriously doubted that he knew what I felt for him. At least this aspect of my life was perfectly safe.
“I’ll take my son and you won’t stop me,” he warned Dursley, who was almost pissing on himself from fear.
Sirius handed him a cup of camomile tea and he drank it at one gulp. He didn’t need camomile. He needed his husband by his side, safe and sound.
“Who asked your opinion, Stevenson?” Draco snapped, holding himself in check not wanting to punch the other man. “You shouldn’t even be here! You have nothing to do with us!”
Harry looked at his son, who was now eleven years old. Nathan was as small as Harry was at that age. They looked alike, except for a few details that made Nathan resemble Cho from time to time. Nathan’s eyes were green, but the shape was slightly narrowed, like Cho’s. The smile also resembled Cho at times. Harry felt sentimental as he stared at his pre-adolescent son. Nathan would soon be at Hogwarts to start a new phase in his life. He was hitting puberty, that confusing time when everything in life seems a real mess but also fun. Nathan would make new friends, play tricks on old Filch, be scolded by McGonagall and probably be pestered by Snape. Although Snape did seem to take a liking to Nathan, Harry had warned his son to watch out. If the greasy bastard picked on Nathan, Harry would take drastic measures.
I knew deep down that it was useless to hide things from my parents. How to approach the subject without Lucius throwing a fit was another matter altogether. I would rather my father was right to the point instead of playing mind games. Unfortunately, Lucius loved those. He had fun watching me crumble little by little.
“Oh, aren’t you hungry? I thought for sure this morning would be different...” she said with a wise look.
A little after Hermione and Ron were gone, and Harry was about to leave, the phone rang. Harry ran to the telephone and picked up panting.
Things went by normally until lunch. I read the newspapers with their usual articles complaining about the Ministry and the way they had been handling the Death Gang. The group had been split in two according to them, and I could imagine the reason. The Daily Prophet, however, didn’t mention anything at all about The Almighty.
A noise at the door made me jumpy. Someone was trying to get in. I saw the flash of a spell being used. My legs shook. I ran to get my wand beside my bed and cast a Stupefy spell towards whoever it was, but it would be a stupid thing to do against the man who glared at me from the open door. I gulped. I felt I was walking on a tightrope. Harry was there staring at me with murderous intent. I could do nothing but swallow hard and wait. He walked towards me and the door shut behind him without him touching it or even muttering a spell.
"There’s only one way to keep me in bed all day," Draco provoked him placing soft kisses on his lips.
“All right, not to worry. I’ll go get it.” Harry jumped out of the bed naked, ran to the bathroom and came back in a few seconds with the tube of lubricant in his hands. “Aha!” he said, making Draco laugh at his eagerness. Harry jumped in the bed and started the foreplay all over again, taking pleasure in every kiss and touch.
Harry’s fingers traced Draco’s lips, then went down his neck and stopped next to a nipple. Draco sighed, longing for what was coming next. He shivered all over when Harry’s mouth and then tongue captured his hardened nipple. Harry rubbed his body on Draco’s and then whispered in his ear, “You can talk dirty if you want to.”
Harry walked through the corridors of his old department at the Ministry very aware of the fact that he was being carefully watched by his former colleagues. Most of them had stopped talking to him after they’d found out about his relationship with Draco, but he still had loyal friends in there, such as Hannah Abbott, who was Elisabeth’s secretary.
Draco had one last look at the letter and memorized the address that Dumbledore believed to be the place where Nathan lived:
But he was lying and Harry knew it, which was why his hand moved towards Draco’s cock and slowly stroked it until Draco moaned with passion. His self-control was long forgotten. He turned his head and his lips met Harry’s in a fervent kiss. How he had missed that kiss, that sweet moment of surrender when all of their problems seemed to vanish and there was nothing left in the world but themselves. Harry’s lips were like a powerful drug and he was hopeless addicted forever.
"Maybe just a little," Harry admitted, and Draco smiled. "All right! Maybe more than just a little. But that was because I was already attracted to you, and I was enjoying the fact that we were alone. You, on the other hand, were really scared."
There was a period of silence, and then the voice said, “It’s not safe to talk on the phone. Even I know that, and I’m a wizard. Nathan is fine, Mr Potter. He’s expecting you. What?” There was a loud noise on the other side of the line and the man grumbled something. “Oh, fine! Bring Draco with you.”
Draco sighed. That was his fear. Harry was asking him too many questions, and he feared it’d only get worse. Once Lucius name got in the picture, Harry would have a tantrum, he was sure of it. And then... What would happen to him?
All of this was very stressful for Harry and Draco. Harry couldn’t believe he was being accused like that and Draco couldn’t bear to think that his relationship with Harry was damaging his good-guy image. Even though Harry had assured him a thousand times that this fact didn’t bother him, Draco just couldn’t let it go. It hurt him to think that it was his fault; that if Harry wasn’t with him, none of this would be happening.  Again, his lover had told him that their relationship had nothing to do with the spiteful comments in the Daily Prophet. It didn’t help to calm Draco down though.
“Melissa Brickwall. She was just a poor pathetic woman,” Alfred said with bitterness. I noticed, however, the melancholy behind it that he was trying to hide. “She thought my father’s family would come to her aid. But my grandfather was arrested and my grandmother had vanished from the face of the earth. I guess I have uncles. I don’t know if they’re alive.”
‘I like the dark hair. It actually suits you. It makes your eyes somewhat livelier. However, your silver-blond hair is just as sexy,’ he muttered.
I woke up with the world spinning around me. I smiled as I thought that metaphorically the world had always revolved around me in one way or another. My dizziness was only a confirmation of that.
“That’s a good idea,” Hermione said. “I can go there right now and talk to Ron and Harry. We’ll find him.”
He sat down, his hands on his chin. He was a wizard, but he didn’t know how to do magic. For one thing, he didn’t have a wand. Sometimes he did strange things, but he didn’t know how those things happened. Perhaps if he closed his eyes and concentrated hard on the task ahead, the pot would float to his hands. But no matter how much he shut his eyes tight, the pot didn’t move.
“Listen, Potter,” I bravely walked to where he was standing and stopped in front of him. “I really don’t want to live through another war. Even if Slytherin does sound like a pleasant alternative over our current...”
“All right! But I definitely don’t want to hear the details. No way. Gee! Ginny will be so disappointed.”
Draco smirked with joy while Dobby cursed under his breath as he tried to break into Harry Potter's house. When they were in, Draco looked around disdainfully. The house was plain just like its owner. There was nothing fancy about it, and to make matter worse, it was covered with the same old sickening Christmas' ornaments Draco had noticed all over town.
I was anxious. It would be my first time outside of the UK alone for a really long time ago and without the use of magic. I was only able to relax a little when I was finally on my seat ready to depart. I closed my eyes and thought about Astoria’s troubled face as I left the Manor. None of the Aurors was around when I left which means that no one tried to stop me. That fact bothered me. Were they really taking care of the protection of my family or was it all for show? Either way, Astoria knew all the Manor’s secrets. She knew what to do in case of an attack. Despite her looks, she was a very powerful and witty witch.
I hate to confess that his commanding tone impressed me, and much worse, it got me extremely excited. I kept wondering what it would be like to hear that same voice in the privacy of my room. I had to shut my eyes tightly so I could dissipate the image.
I heard a song on the background. I thought it was the soundtrack of our moment together, but it was in fact Harry’s bloody mobile phone. I swore to myself that one day I would destroy the annoying gadget.
“Not until you give me a few answers, you bastard! What do you want with Nathan? What did you do to him?”
He felt like he was losing his mind. That was when he decided to go to work and see if he could forget about the whole thing. He couldn’t stop thinking about Draco. And the fact that he might have been unfair with the blond was eating him alive.
At two o’clock in the morning, he was awakened by a noise coming from the kitchen. Carefully, he raised his wand and tiptoed to the kitchen, hoping to catch the invader defenceless. He placed the wand on the table when he realised it was only Draco drinking a glass of water and embraced him from behind. Draco almost spilt the water from the surprise.
Draco didn’t even know where to begin with. There were so many issues stuck on his throat and all of them wanted to get out at once.
“I’ve killed two people in the past. That part is right. One of them was a Death Eater, the other one was Voldemort and I don’t think he fits into the category of a human being. I acted in self-defence. And it’s not like anyone was sad when Voldemort was killed. They fucking threw out a party to celebrate! Now they are accusing me of murders that I had nothing to do with! You believe me, right?” Harry asked, insecure.
Our afternoon tea went by smoothly. The elves brought us a huge basket of scones and different types of muffins to Angel’s delight. I could tell that Alfred was also content, even though he tried really hard not to show. I pretended not to notice them feeding the dogs under the table. Kids would always be kids after all.
My biggest fear was coming true. I could tell by the way he was looking at me and also by the intonation in his voice that he knew something.
‘But was it an order? It didn’t sound like one,’ I retorted trying to show too much joy for having him next to me.
“No, it’s not. It’s all my fault.” he took an Advil from the drawer beside the bed and sat down by Draco’s side. “I mean, what was I thinking?”
We spent the afternoon in the gazebo watching Porthos, Athos, Aramis and D’artagnan playing around with the boys. The weather couldn’t be more pleasant, and the sky was incredibly blue.
Ron was afraid of Harry’s explosion, but he was relieved to see that Harry wasn’t angry, but rather tired.
“The idea crossed my mind for a second. Unfortunately, Lucius Malfoy is the type of person you cannot depend on.”
Her smile was so innocent it became impossible for me to ask her anything else. It was better this way. I wasn’t prepared to talk about Harry and what had happened. Maybe I never would be.
Harry’s quiet spirit took Draco by surprise. He didn’t expect Harry to be so calm, not after everything that had happened.
Harry nodded, laughing hard. Brutus appeared at the door and barked, happy to see that his owner was getting better.
“According to the book… Let me see…” Hermione caught the book and looked for the page of interest. “Ah! Here it is. The ark was restored by Toledo’s followers in 1432. It was in possession of a man named Geoffrey Harvest, and it has been a family legacy of his for centuries.”
Harry flinched and his uncertainties about Bob came back. Bob had no right to accuse Draco of anything. He didn’t even know Draco. Harry promised himself that whatever Bob had to say, it wouldn’t affect him.
‘We haven’t finished here yet,’ I retorted, pointing my wand at him. ‘Besides, this was your idea, wasn’t it?’
“I know. But it will only be temporarily. I hope,” he said doubtfully, and then in a bitter tone of voice he added, “I will find out who is behind all of this and I swear to God that I will kill the bastard!”
Harry immediately put on his “mask” again, and his voice was low when he answered it. I noticed, however, that his tone was rather sweet. It was probably Ginny on the phone. I hated them both.
When we made our way back to the Manor, I had an unpleasant surprise. My father’s head was waiting for me by the fireplace. His cold stare pierced through me reminding me of every single thing I had done wrong, and how much I had disappointed him. One glance of his was always enough to make me feel like shit.
Draco sat beside her, not quite sure of what to do. Truth to be told, he and Narcissa weren’t exactly close to one another. They cared for each other but they weren’t used to the kind of intimacy that Harry shared with Sirius, for example.
“You’re so stubborn, Malfoy! I hope you’ve at least changed your mind about the things you said to me yesterday.”
“I told your godfather that I’ve been in love with him since our first year in Hogwarts. After so long he confessed that he felt the same way and now we’re together. I’m moving in with Sirius,” Remus enlaced Sirius hand with his.
He didn’t know what he should do. Before, when he’d found out about Seamus’ kidnapping, things looked a lot clearer. He wanted to be with Seamus. He loved him so much. He had had a glimpse of what his world without Seamus would be.
“Why would I attempt against my saviour’s life? Besides, I didn’t buy these things. They were given to me by Astoria’s relatives. It would have been rude not to accept them.”
I got lost in thoughts of last night and started fretting. It made me leave my toast aside. Astoria seemed sad.
The blond men was starting to withdraw when Harry tightened his legs again around his waist as if asking for him to stay inside his body a little longer. The blond smiled.
“I missed you so much,” Harry talked softly before kissing Draco’s fervent lips. “I couldn’t sleep all night because you weren’t by my side. I craved for you, my silver dragon.”
“Well, yes. I was reading this book with Neville and it says that a proper breathing technique contributes a lot to a good labour experience.”
"What are you talking about? It’s fun!" Harry winked at him. "Besides, it’s all your fault. You spoiled him shamelessly! He thinks he’s your owner."
Harry raised a brow. He tried to take the letter away from me one more time. Honestly, it was becoming quite childish.
Draco stepped forward, carefully watched by Harrry’s green eyes. He didn’t know why a silly poem Ginny Weasley wrote in second year for Valentine’s Day, comparing Harry’s beautiful eyes with a toad, came to his mind. A feeble smiled formed on the corner of his mouth.
“I could sue you for misuse of magic.” Draco punched one of the metal locker’s doors and it opened with the impact. “You’re not lying about your motives, are you?” he asked with a suspicious look on his face.
It was almost as time had stopped. They kept staring at each other for a long time. Harry’s resolution of sending him away was diminishing against his better judgment. The truth was that he was confused by everything. He didn’t want Draco to walk out of his life, but at the same time he did. After all, he had seen Draco kissing another man.
I could see, however, that Angel showed clear signs that he was very interested in it. To my utter surprise, he played the first chord of the song perfectly. I was delighted. I played some more and was impressed with his ability to copy me. He seemed to feel the song as much as I did. Perhaps he lacked the delicacy, but he certainly had the talent. He was a prodigy.
Harry had practically kidnapped him from the ice-cream parlour and had taken Draco to his apartment where a box of his favourite ice-cream flavour - strawberry - and a bottle of the best vodka in the market had been waiting for them. When Draco had seen them, he didn’t get it in the beginning, but the puzzle lasted only a minute. Harry had attacked him from behind, tearing off Draco’s shirt and jeans as if he had been desperate to feel their bodies moving as one. Harry had traced a path of fire with his tongue all the way down his backside. Draco could do nothing but surrender and shiver with desire.
“Don’t blame me. Kids are growing a lot faster these days, Harry,” Draco said looking very serious, but Harry knew better. “Soon he’ll be dating and bringing girls – or guys – to spend the night.” Harry shot him a murderous glare. “What? I’m not prejudiced. He can date guys if he wants to.”
I smiled. I saw Harry’s lips open up a little bit, but he immediately got stiff and serious, as if he was afraid I would misinterpret him.
“I’m not proud of a lot of things...” Harry continued. “I wasn’t paying attention when I should have... What happened to your parents?”
Draco was getting out of breath, and his suffering seemed to be turning the fake Harry on. Harry let go of Draco’s neck and kissed him fully on the lips. Draco fought like a lion to break free. He bit Harry’s lips with all his might. Harry yelped and slapped Draco hard. Then he laughed, licking the blood on his lips with amusement.
“Sweetie, give me back daddy’s wand,” Draco said softly. “You know you can’t play with it. How many times do I have to tell you that this is dangerous?”
Draco felt chills running down his spine at the thought of Bob and Harry alone in the same room. He knew for sure that Bob had dropped by not just to pay Harry a visit but also to poison him against Draco. Draco was so sure of it that he was afraid of asking Harry what Bob had told him. He didn’t want to fight with Harry or hear stupid accusations coming from his lover’s mouth. Not when he was feeling so bad about himself.
“Oh, flying is not that dangerous. Not when you have the proper supervision. I had a broom at the age of three,” Sirius said.
“Well, I think it’s very hypocritical of you,” said Ulian Karl, a middle-aged wizard who hadn’t joined the Dark Lord but neither had joined the Order of the Phoenix. Mr Karl was an example of someone who had always been sitting on the fence just waiting for what was to come. It was quite bizarre to watch him talk to Harry in such a rude manner.
“Alfred, would you please think about everything I told you? Matthew is on our side, I promise you. He worries about you, and he doesn’t want any of you to suffer more than you already did. I’ll send him to talk to you as soon as I can. I hope you can tell me then the real reason you and your brother are being hunted.”
“Oh, Harry, don’t be naïve! You defeated Voldemort. You ruined a lot of Death Eaters’ plans. Don’t tell me you don’t have enemies! You must have as many enemies as I have! I know a bunch of people who would love to kill me.”
Nostrums rolled his eyes and said, irritated, “Take my hand. This is the right procedure to send me to the Temple, isn’t it? You have to take my hand to send me to prison.”
"I have nothing to do with Potter. I’m not after him. I am looking for revenge though. Harry Potter, however, is not on my list."
It was very difficult for Draco to tell about Lucius. That didn’t take Severus by surprise though, not as much as the pregnancy news. The shock was minimal to describe Severus’ reaction to it. At first, he thought it was a joke, but when he realised Draco wasn’t laughing with him, he crumpled into his chair with his eyes wide open.
Ron also had a few things to say about the Unspeakables but he said nothing. Instead, he asked, “Did they say the location to their hideout?”
Scared, he gripped Harry’s shirt and asked to be picked up so he could hide his face in Harry’s neck. Harry did it right way, wondering why Nathan could see something that no one else could. He quickly knocked on Neville’s door, ignoring the secretary’s angry face.
‘That’s it then?’ he groaned. ‘You just want the book like all those bastards in the Almighty Group? After telling me over and over that you are different from them?’
“I don’t think you have a choice,” I told him. “You know you and your brother will be found if you go back to the streets. You can barely use that wand of yours properly. You can’t apparate. At least here you’ll be safe.”
It was all just a dream, though. I needed to pull myself together. What I’d read between the lines could not be the truth. It simply could not. Because if it was... What would happen to me if our attraction was mutual and real? What would happen to us?
Or at least I hope I wouldn’t. I couldn’t die now that I actually had something of a chance with Harry. It would be too cruel.
“My past is complicated, Harry,” Seamus muttered. “It’s not pretty, and this is why Dean is having a hard time to accept me in his life.”
‘You’re about to find out in a minute. What? Are you afraid? Do you really think I’d bring you to an unsafe place? After everything we’ve talked about?’
“How wonderful! I bet Harry is walking on clouds. He was so worried, huh? He’ll finally be able to rest a little.”
He kissed my bellybutton and I melted. He didn’t suck me off, but his hand was more than enough to drive me insane. He touched me so tenderly I wanted to scream for him to stop being such a gentleman.
Finally, the train started to move. I’ve heard these trains were now controlled by computers. I felt chills as I thought of my life in the hands of a machine. There was no alternative but to trust the Muggles, though. After all, that train had been coming and going without any problems for ages.
He could bet Harry would be mad at him about his lack of prudence and responsibility. His husband would never understand that he’d had to talk to Lucius and find out the truth. The danger didn’t matter to Draco as long as he kept his family safe.
I blinked. I was next to do what? It was hard to focus on anything else that wasn’t Harry’s body. His smile seemed to tell me that he knew exactly the cause of my distraction. I felt like bitting his kissable lips.
“Shut up, Brutus! I’m trying to call Draco!” Harry complained, but Brutus didn’t stop barking. “Oh, no.” Harry got up quickly and took his wand. “He’s not here, is he? The stupid little... What the hell did he do?” Harry saw the empty glass of milk at the bedside table and frowned. “Could it be that he had the courage to drug me? The bastard! How could he? I knew it. I knew he was too soft today. Something wasn’t right.” He looked at Brutus, upset. “And you, dog! Why didn’t you do something to stop him?”
Lucius took his wand out of his pocket and for a moment Draco thought his father would use it against him. It wasn’t the case though. Lucius used the wand to clean a bench before sitting on it.
The most amusing thing for Harry was discovering how the code that Hermione enchanted to meet the match presented itself. It was quite humorous, and for those who weren’t cynical and still had a heart, it was also quite sweet and romantic. Basically, the two angels got out of the invitation once they spotted the person’s match and met the other person’s angels in the air, playing a lovable - and very silly in Harry’s opinion - song. Then they wrapped the couple-to-be together by an invisible thread and vanished.
They stood up and while Draco conducted Brutus to the backyard talking silly things in his big and falling ears, Harry went looking for the room. He found it on the second floor. It was a big and well-lightened room with a king-sized bed that Harry didn’t think twice before sinking in. He crossed his hands behind his head and waited for Draco to come.
He stopped in front of the fireplace and glanced at the pot full of Floo powder that was on top of it, out of his reach. He’d seen it being used before. Now all he had to do was to find a way to reach the top of the fireplace and take a handful of powder.
It was official now. I was very excited and I knew Harry could feel just how much. I expected him to push me away and act properly shocked. However, he did nothing. He only stared at me with those bloody marvellous eyes. Could a person have an orgasm just by being looked at so intensely? In a few seconds, I’d probably know the answer to that.
Draco smirked. “It’s so hard to recognise Harry, especially with a lightning scar on his forehead. And let’s not forget, of course, that his face has been on the cover of The Daily Prophet and other magazines all the time. I think they should pay you royalties, Harry.”
Harry was apprehensive at first. He didn’t like blind dates and he was afraid of spending his night with someone awful and another waste of his time. But Hermione convinced him to come, telling him that she had found the perfect match for Harry. So he agreed, a little against his will. To make Harry comfortable, Hermione put in the invitation that everybody should be wearing cloaks and masks so their identity could only be revealed if and when the other person wanted. That way, if a matching couple didn’t get along right away, they wouldn’t have to bear the embarrassment of it.
He saw Nostrums working as a Mage, helping others instead of killing them. The demon seemed to be very different then. He was tall, had long dark hair and intense black eyes. His eyes were kind, not resembling his cold eyes from the present. But that look changed when someone came to work as a Mage in his department. Nathan could feel exactly what Nostrums had felt the moment he’d laid eyes on the new worker. Confusion, adoration, envy, lust, hate, love. Nathan could feel them all at once. But most of all, Nostrums had been confused because Mages had sworn not to love and desire anyone, and they should take their vows seriously.
There was a short period of silence and then Harry asked, “If you two are here, then who’s with Nathan?”
“I’m your son in this life. My older self is awake now, but when this is all over, I’ll be back to just being five-year-old Nathan. My older self is just here for the time being because of that fellow.” He pointed at Nostrums, who groaned.
Harry cut Draco off, "I wasn’t thinking about leaving you behind, Draco. I didn’t even know what I was saying! I was confused, all right? I want to protect my son from the Wizard Mob. I don’t want those bastards to lay a finger on my son! But I also don’t want them to kidnap you or something like that. I don’t want you to get hurt. You should go with Nathan to the cabin. He’ll love the place."
I didn’t have time to retort. He stood up suddenly and went to stand in a corner of the room. I raised a brow, wondering if he had seen something there or if he simply wanted more space between us.
“You’ll have plenty of time to work things out with him, Dean,” Hermione said, gripping Dean’s shoulder. “I think we should find out where he is now.”
“Yes, it is. Don’t you get it, Harry? I let him go. I should have helped put him in jail but I didn’t do anything.”
Draco looked at him guiltily. “Sort of... He had the right to know!” he quickly said in his defence.
Draco followed Jonas to a small room behind the bar. When they were inside, Jonas closed the door with a spell and cast another in the room so they wouldn’t be heard.
Nathan sat next to Draco and wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, kissing him soundly on the cheek. “Sorry, Drake.”
And before somebody calls the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, and quote the Hermione Granger Law for House-Elf Protection, you should know I’m very fair with mine. Against my father’s will, I paid them a salary and gave them days-off. They even had a right to go on holiday! To be honest, I felt some affection for Swan, our ‘governess’ house-elf. She came with Astoria after our wedding. Astoria was very fond of her and vice-versa. Swan was loyal, and I was sure she would work for us on the old terms. She was a true jewel and had authority over the others. And, well, I wasn’t as heartless as before. Although I had followed on my father’s footsteps most of my life and treated the house-elves like scum, I knew better now. Living and learning.
“You didn’t have to go to the trouble of going there just to check it out. I could’ve told you that. Besides, Potter, if that old parchment in the muggle museum was really dangerous, do you think it would have been left there? Don’t you think someone would have stolen it by now?”
He had saved me from the Fiendfyre. He had taken pity of my rotten soul. He could have let me burn but he didn’t. I deserved to die after everything I’d done.
Harry hated the fact that he couldn’t see Draco yet, but his heart was soothed a little when he saw his daughter through the big glass window of the nursery. He was enchanted by her immediately. She was very small and delicate, and her head had some silver-blond hair. He thought she looked just like Draco, but Ron kept telling him that babies all looked the same.
The first time Draco had seen Harry that upset and determinate, it had been right before he had killed Voldemort. Now, that dark and scary Harry was back with full force and it was impossible not to fear him when he looked so murderous.
"No, honey! It’s just that I found out today that Seamus and Dean are gay and I got curious about Neville’s sexuality as well. They were all my roommates, you know? I think I am the only one who remained intact."
“Alright, you and your brother can stay here with Malfoy and his wife. I’ll send a Ministry official to formalize the situation. You are now responsible for them, Malfoy. I suggest you play safe. I’m also keeping my men here.”
The other man nodded, cupping Harry’s hard length with one hand and squeezing it. Harry moaned with pleasure. Bit by bit, the blonde’s manhood fulfilled him. The back and forth movements accelerated. Harry let go of the bars, holding onto the blond arms and bringing him closer. Harry’s legs – that had slipped down – were now tightened around the blonde’s waist.
“Saul?” Harry frowned and looked at Saulus, who was smiling behind them. “What did they do to you, Nathan?”
We were in the gazebo of the Mansion, my favourite place. I didn’t want to leave so early. The place brought me peace of mind. It was surrounded by plants and ancient gnarled trees. My four German Sheppard dogs ran around in search for gnomes and barked happily when they found some. Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D’artagnan were their names, my four musketeers. I adored them. I whistled to call their attention and they followed me back to the Mansion.
“You’re saying like you’re never coming back,” there was a tone of desperation in Draco’s voice. “You’re coming back, aren’t you? They can’t keep you there forever! You’re Harry Potter, for Merlin’s sake!”
He closed his eyes for a moment, trying to control his nerves for the task ahead. He wanted Harry with all his heart but he would have to let him go. He wouldn’t be able to bear it if Harry decided to leave once he got tired of him. It was better to face the sorrow now when he still didn’t have so many memories of them together.
“I didn’t come here to finish you off. I didn’t intend to kill you in the past; I don’t intend to kill you now.”
With a sigh, I started eating little by little. First I took a bite of the toast, and then I sipped my tea with milk. I even tried one of Swan’s delicious scones, to Astoria’s delight. Harry didn’t say anything, but I noticed the satisfaction in his eyes.
Nathan appeared at the doorway of his room. “I can answer the door.” He looked as calm as always. In all those years, Harry had never seen Nathan lose patience. He wondered what it would take to make Nathan truly distressed.
“No, I’m all right,” I insisted, avoiding his eyes and trying to escape from him without any success.
Draco didn’t say anything. He was too busy thinking about it himself. Lucius had assured Draco that he wanted nothing to do with Nathan. But what if he had been lying? Lucius had been satisfied to see what had happened that day, almost as if that had been some sort of a test. If that was the truth, his father would have to pay.
If you're reading this, then I'm dead and you don't know the truth about what happened to your son. There's no way of telling you this in a more gentle way so I'll just say it. Nathan Potter didn't die that day, Harry. Nathan is...'
The next step was to get into the train. If I were healthier, apparating wouldn’t be a problem. As it was, there was no way I could trust myself to apparate to Paris. I was a sick man. Aeroplanes were out of the question. I was terrified of them. I would much rather travel by broom, but it was also not an option at this point.
It was true that I hadn’t practised it for some years, but I had made good use of it when Scorpius was younger.
Draco’s eyes glittered slightly. “I remember every fight and detention we had, Harry. You called my mother names and I jumped on top of you to break your face.”
“I’m... better now,” I spoke hoarsely. We stared at each other for what seemed like hours but were probably just a few seconds. The emerald green eyes sparkled in a strange way.
Barry went white, and then red, and then he turned quickly and left me. He came back a few minutes later with another Auror, a very attracted young woman – too young to even be an Auror in my opinion. She smiled at me and said Harry was on his way. At least somebody in Harry’s Headquarter was polite.
Harry was still in a state of shock when he met the others in the corridor. Sirius was more surprised than Harry was to know that Severus delivered babies. It was something that none of them was expecting, except Remus. Sirius looked at his lover with distrust.
‘You have nothing Muggle in your home. I’ve never seen you with a mobile phone. And I know you still despise Muggles.’
“You’re right. They wouldn’t understand, because you’re a lunatic! Nathan is your mortal enemy? How can it be?”
On the fifth day I had a pleasant surprise. I was in my room licking my wounds when Angel got in. I felt like asking him to leave but his green eyes cast a powerful spell on me. I didn’t have the heart to tell him to go away. He walked toward me kind of wary, but he smiled when our eyes met. My frozen heart suddenly melted and I smiled back involuntarily. It was impossible not to. Astoria’s fascination for him and the fact that she insisted on telling me everything Angel did every day even when I refused to listen became clear to me. Angel was indeed fascinating.
"What if he wasn’t, Harry? What if the reason why they’d taken Nathan away wasn’t just for you to kill Voldemort, but also the fact that Nathan is special, more special than any wizard we’ve ever known?"
Harry smiled in a teasing, sweet sort of way. He pulled Draco against his body and kissed him voraciously. They spent the rest of the day in bed, lost in touches, kisses and whispers. They didn’t think of anything except for exploring and satisfying each other’s body by all means possible.
“Harry, what the fuck–” Ron said, losing the ability to speak when he saw an enraged and unclothed Harry in front of him.
“You kind of deserved it for being so stupid and hard-headed,” Harry muttered and Draco pulled an angry face. “Don’t worry, it’s only a baby. It’s not an adult Hippogriff yet. It’s actually cute and the feathers are so soft.”
“Since when are you so evil?” Draco asked, pouting. “We just wanted a few minutes alone to catch up...”
Nathan was pretty much used to his Mage powers by now, but it was still hard to control them. Neville was helping him a lot, and he had already warned Nathan that after his 13th birthday, he would feel things a lot more intensely. Nathan couldn’t even imagine how it would be like because he already felt too much of other people’s emotions. But he wasn’t worried. He knew that whatever happened, he had two loving fathers that would always run to his aid if they were needed.
“But what? If you’re taking Harry, then you’ll have to take me, too, because I was with him all the way. If Harry violated any rule, then I did it, too. We’re together. He’s my partner. I won’t leave him alone!”
“I do!” Harry got up and walked to where Draco was, sitting next to him and putting him on his lap. “I know it’s not easy. It’s not easy for me, too. But this is about me! You read the Daily Prophet’s articles against me! I have to prove that I’m not another Voldemort. And I have to protect you and Nathan. Those bastards almost killed my son that day.”
"Please, come with us, Uncle Drake. Pleeease. I don’t wanna leave you alone… What if the bad men get you?" Nathan said with his eyes filled with tears.
“So you see… I’m starting to believe in you, Malfoy,” he continued. “Besides, Alfred and Angel like it here, I can tell. I suppose it does help to have a wife like yours. She’s nothing like I've imagined her to be.”
I felt like a child who suddenly had their toys put away against their will. I wanted to scream and send everything to hell – specifically Ginny Weasley. But I was an adult and as such, I should do what adults do in moments of stress: take a sleeping draught and chill.
“As the Head of the Aurors Office it is my duty to inform you that you are under arrest for attacking me and also for being in possession of forbidden articles,” he started all business-like. I raised a brow. “Fortunately for you, your wife’s already paid your bail. You must, however, be in Court on the set date to answer to the charge of n. 50 and 138. Because of your circumstances, I’ll recommend house arrest as your penalty.”
Harry’s green eyes darkened considerably. “They wouldn’t dare to do something like that. I was quite categorical about what I wanted, and I wanted her with me. But in the end, she couldn’t come.”
“You really are a child, aren’t you? Come on, now, don’t cry. It wasn’t your fault. Well, not exactly,” Nostrums muttered, looking at anywhere but Nathan. “I won’t kill you if that’s what you’re worried about. You know I don’t kill children. It’s my policy. I kill annoying and weak people, and even though some children fit the category, I’m not that kind of demon. So all along, I didn’t really want to kill you.” Nostrums looked thoughtful. “Maybe I did. But seeing you now... really... I couldn’t. You have this look... That’s why you are the most powerful Mage there ever was in the Temple. You always made me feel so at ease and calm. I’m very weak to that look of yours. I don’t want to see you cry. Although, when I was alone, and being a demon, I thought about some nasty ways to finish you off. In the end, I just wanted to see you again, I guess. I didn’t expect you to be five. That’s really bothersome.”
"With Dobby," Draco said with a smirk. "Dobby! Use your magical powers to tie him up and knock him unconscious!"
They heard a big noise downstairs. Draco’s heart almost came out of his mouth. It was only when he heard Ron’s and Hermione’s voices that he calmed down.
He opened his eyes slowly fumbling around the bed he was lying in and looking for the one responsible for his awful physical state. Harry wasn’t there. He stretched, his body already missing Harry.
‘I never said I would follow your orders. As you say so yourself, I am not an Auror. I don’t work for you. Besides…’
“I’ll stay here tomorrow,” Harry informed him when they were both in bed. “I’ve decided not to go to the cabin.”
‘What I don’t understand is how no one has tried anything against us yet. The only explanation is that The Almighty is afraid of Potter. But if he is not here, then…’
‘How do you think I feel? Do you really think this is easy for me? It’s not, but now it’s not the time. There’s too much at stake!’
What I hadn’t noticed before was that his mobile phone had been vibrating in his pocket, which was why he had needed more privacy. He spoke quietly and tenderly, and I could imagine who it was on the other side of the line. I closed my eyes once again. Why did I have to put up with that?
Draco smiled, touched Harry’s forehead with his and moved his body up and down. All of a sudden, Draco stopped. Harry breathed loudly but didn’t complain. Draco was playing with him. He could play it, too.
The Manor was now fully protected. We had two Aurors on patrol, though it wasn’t really necessary as we were already protected by the Fidelius Charm. My biggest concern was Scorpius’ safety, but Harry assured me he would keep him safe.
Draco chuckled as he remembered the episode very well. They’d been about to leave home when Harry started a fight over something stupid and they ended up entangled on the living room floor, naked and aroused.
“We’ve only been together for five months, Harry! There are plenty of things you still don’t know about me. You just can’t expect to know every little detail of my life in such a short period of time,” Draco complained.
“Hey!” Draco pinched Harry. He too was relieved to realise that things would return to normal now that Nostrums was gone. “You find Saulus attractive?”
"I see." Harry took something from his pocket and before Draco could do anything, he tossed the strange piece of cloth to him. "Catch! It's yours."
But he didn't manage to get past the living room door. For waiting for him at the bottom of the stairs, with a sharp and intense gaze, was the person he planned to capture.
“Of course I don’t believe it! I’m just warning you.” Bob shot him one last meaningful look before saying, “I’ll see you tomorrow.” And he vanished inside his own office.
"Listen, drop by at the ice-cream parlour, would you? I need to talk to you. Maybe I can cheer you up a little."
“You don’t have to be a gentleman tonight, Harry. I know you want to fuck me,” Draco said in a husky voice. “Fast and hard.”
It was way too much information coming out of someone who until not so long ago had refused to speak at all.
Harry stared at Draco in shock. He almost applauded Draco’s calmness as he said to Nathan, “Really? Well, that’s my girl. Already a Malfoy… Demanding to be born today…” Draco fondly stroked his belly. “Call Dr Jules, Harry.”
Harry shook his head while Draco and Ron laughed. He was about to say something not so polite when he felt Nathan’s little hand unfolding his. He looked down and smiled, trying to forget about his nervousness for a while. It was unbelievable how Nathan could appease his heart with just a look.
She giggled. “Well, it is. But a long time ago, medi-wizards discovered that it was very good not just for werewolves but for us as well.”
Finding I had a new power over him, I made him reach the zenith quickly. I followed him the moment his orgasm filled me whole.
“Why don’t you just come out and say what you’re thinking? Your face is going all red, and I know it is from anger,” he continued.
“No! You get your butt into your room and finish packing. Now!” Draco ordered, striding towards the front door.
“We should tell the others!” Harry exclaimed completely forgotten that a minute ago he had been very upset with Draco and his meeting with Lucius.
"As you both know, Draco and I went to Paris before going to New Zealand. Hagrid said to me that Dumbledore had wanted to tell me something but he died before he could do it. He hadn't mentioned the key to anyone and it was out of pure luck that Hagrid found it," Harry explained uneasily. "Now, let's talk about something else. How is Seamus doing?"
