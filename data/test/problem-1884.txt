“How about it, Malfoy?” Harry asked, voice only slightly strained. His fingers flicked open the button at Draco’s collar as he mouthed wet kisses along Draco’s waist. “Know what you’re going to study next term?”
“Er –” Harry mumbled, “Molly took him into the kitchen.”
“What were you doing with all those ropes?” Draco asked.
“Only if it’s poisoned.” Harry winked, and Draco’s mouth went dry.
He had planned to convert it into a greenhouse, to surprise Draco with a garden overgrown and messy. A place of berry bushes and wildflowers and chaotic color that would be there for him whenever he needed it, year-round.
Draco nodded, then abruptly turned away from Harry before the tears could spill over. He picked up the glass with a shaking hand and sipped it slowly.
Before Madam Pomfrey could reply, a high shriek sounded from behind her. It cut off abruptly as a blinding flash of violet light lit up what they could see of the room.
“What?” Harry demanded. “They’re really hard to see! It’s not like we all walk around banging our noses against the wall.”
“No,” Harry squeaked. “I think we got it.”
“Malfoy, I’m
He’d looked up, when Harry had walked across the grass to join him, meeting his eyes with a tentative nod. He didn’t speak though, and Harry decided not to push him. Instead, he sat with his back to the apple tree, not quite next to Draco, but close enough.
Malfoy frowned at him again, but Harry noticed a faint blush was heating his cheeks. Malfoy opened his mouth. Closed it. Then he took one last look at the plants and glanced at Harry before simply walking away. Again.
“I knew he was wrong, you know,” Malfoy whispered.
With a heavy exhale, Draco opened his eyes and touched a finger to the glow at the tip of his wand. It was such a little thing, that light.
The silence grew heavy. Finally, Harry cleared his throat. “Can I – ?” he asked, gesturing to the bandages he was holding.
It was not an unpleasant feeling, this wanting, not now that he had tasted Harry. No, the memory of Harry’s kisses and the promise of more kisses to come lent sweetness to the ache. And Draco savored it.
The same colors, the very same lights, that had plagued Harry and Draco in that nightmare house created by the Room of Requirement.
Draco’s grip somehow grew tighter, one last painful squeeze before he released Harry’s hand. Startled, Harry blinked up at Draco, but he just straightened his cuffs and gave Harry a determined nod. Harry cupped his chin and kissed him before throwing open the door.
“I can’t wait to see it,” Harry said. He squeezed Draco tightly to his chest. “I’m so proud of you.”
like your favorite dessert.” Draco groaned, tugging at his hair and staring helplessly at Harry. “I didn’t even realize what I was doing!” he ranted. “Not until the tea blend was already finished. It was mortifying!”
Ron straightened and pinned Harry with a serious look. “He didn’t make any excuses for it. But look, Harry, we remember what it was like at the Manor, ok? Malfoy’s a git, but I reckon he didn’t have much choice about the Death Eater thing. We're not gonna hold that against him.”
“Hermione,” Draco said, brow furrowing, “do you think Muggles have life-debts? Is it easier to live with, if you don’t know it’s there?” Draco had never minded the knowledge that he was indebted to Harry, but he could see how something like that could be a burden to most people.
As the class went on, Draco warmed to the subject. He appeared intrigued, if skeptical, and Harry enjoyed catching him feverishly scribbling notes to himself and biting on the end of his quill.
Warm breath, mussed hair almost white in the rays of the rising sun, pale grey eyes blinking open, knees and elbows digging into uncomfortable places (but still somehow welcome) – these were the things Harry held onto when his anxiety spiked, which happened every time yet another magical architecture book proved unfruitful.
“Oh,” Draco said. His insides began to twist unpleasantly. “What, did you buy tea from another shop?” he joked weakly.
Something in Harry’s chest cried out in protest at the word
Draco leaned his head against Harry’s shoulder.
read them though? Even if you decide not to send them?”
“Sure you are.” Pansy crossed her arms, ignoring the potatoes.
The simplest explanation would be that Potter’s cottage had exceptionally effective wards, which was entirely plausible. Potter still appeared in the papers often enough to indicate that his fame had not eroded with the end of the war, and it would be prudent of him to take precautions with his home. Still, as much as Draco would have liked to believe this idea, wards kept intruders
Harry wondered if he should let it go, but Draco’s face was open and he hadn’t made any attempt to end the conversation.
“Yes?”
It was a fairly calm night, but just as Harry banished the mugs to the kitchen, a stray breeze blew past the gate, making it creak and rattle.
“Talk about what?” Draco asked, feigning casualness. He concentrated on keeping his hands steady as he continued to refill the tea cannisters. Late October was always a busy time, customers pouring into the shop in droves to escape the damp and the chill, and Draco could hardly keep up with the demand for his Halloween blend,
Harry shook off his drowsiness and sat up, letting the blanket fall to the ground. “You don’t have to,” he said quietly.
“Of course it is, Potter.” McGonagall waved a hand dismissively. “You are utilizing your own magic to directly access the echoes of other magic. That is Aperiomancy.”
“I’m going to miss you, too.” Maeve squeezed his hand before releasing him, then patted him on the knee. “We’ll visit. I want you to meet Madelyn, and I won’t survive a year without a fresh cup of your
“Want to come through?” Harry asked. “I made lemonade, and we’ll probably have enough time to do some notes.”
“Hey,” Harry said. When Draco would not look at him, Harry reached out and gently cupped his check. He stroked his thumb down Draco’s jaw. Harry waited until Draco met his eyes, then said slowly and firmly, “You are not evil.”
“I need to apologize,” Draco said, “for everything I did to you when we were younger.”
“Hmm?”
I like –” Harry gulped – “I like hanging out with you.”
Hermione’s voice faltered, and her look of concern shattered the fragile bubble of distraction the conversation had built.
Harry was momentarily distracted by the strangeness of that idea – worrying that Malfoy would help Harry, rather than hurt him – but impatiently brushed the thought aside.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco tensed and snatched his hands away, gasping out an apology. Harry reached up and caught his hand. Squeezing reassuringly, he placed Draco’s hand back on his head. Draco skimmed a thumb across Harry’s temple, then hesitantly slid his palm over the mussed black tresses. Harry hummed in encouragement and continued working his mouth over Draco, taking him a bit deeper with each thrust.
“On what?” Harry forced out, mouth suddenly dry.
“It was like that,” Harry finished. “All through me. It felt – wrong.” He sighed heavily, only now realizing the extent of his unease.
When Malfoy hadn’t shown his face at breakfast, Harry had been immensely finding it easier to choke down his porridge without the threat of looking up and accidentally meeting his eyes. But now, Harry was starting to worry.
“What are you looking for?” Harry asked when he caught up, only just stopping himself from reaching out to nudge Malfoy’s shoulder.
Harry was horrified, but McGonagall had silenced his protests. She gave Draco a long, appraising look, before calmly asking him to explain. Draco’s response had been immediate and unemotional, delivered in that posh tone he still fell into when arguing a point. He claimed that by visiting his father, he would be in a unique position to possibly uncover vital information.
Flushing, Draco averted his eyes. Harry hummed softly and tilted Draco’s chin up to capture his lips again, teasing him with kiss after kiss until Draco was dizzy with want.
Hadn’t Harry been afraid of it? Hadn’t he gotten into a fight with Draco rather than admit just how afraid he was?
Without breaking eye contact, Harry lifted the blue mug and pressed it into Draco’s hands. “Where should we put it?” he asked.
me?” Malfoy finished, hands fluttering unhappily at his sides in a way that belied his indignant tone. If Harry hadn’t known better, he’d have thought that Malfoy’s feelings were hurt.
Harry glanced around the room and caught Ron’s eye, but he just quirked his eyebrows playfully at Harry before returning to the chess game he was playing with George. Hermione was snuggled into the corner of the sofa, feet on Ron’s lap and her nose buried in a book. She waved merrily at Harry without lifting her eyes from the page.
“Shh,” Draco soothed. “I’ve got you, love.”
“Good.” Malfoy shot him a smug grin.
“Would it be a groom for you?” Harry asked.
Harry nodded. “Thanks. I – I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t –” he swallowed painfully, throat raw from crying. “I’m not embarrassed. Not about that. I know you – I mean, I –”
As the pages turned, Draco’s limbs slowly relaxed. His eyelids fluttered more and more frequently, and by the time Harry had reached the end of the first chapter, Draco was fast asleep.
“When anyone fell ill, Draco knew just what potion would help. He brewed them all himself. He even healed my arm for me, after Bellatrix broke it.”
“What do I miss about her?” he echoed. “Hermione, you
Outside, the pavement was wet, glistening slickly in the glow of the streetlamps. Though striking, the sight was a poor substitute for the starlight Draco had grown up gazing at from the windows of the Manor. In London, the city lights dulled the heavens, chasing the magic from the blue-black sky.
Malfoy’s fingers stuttered where they had been trailing through his pile of petals. He gripped his hands tightly together as his face paled. “Yes, trauma has a way of lingering and tightening its grip, doesn’t it?” he said carefully. “But Luna is so strong, and she worked at a magical creature reserve all summer with no trouble. Those spells are a part of who she is. They shouldn’t be failing her now.”
“I was joking, Potter.” Draco sighed. “I didn’t come here expecting you to find me.”
“Git,” Draco muttered, but he was smiling, and he turned his head to press a kiss into Harry’s smirk.
Draco caught Harry’s hands in his. “There are things I haven’t told you,” he said.
The fire burned out long before their kiss did.
“Harry,” Draco breathed, voice suffused with reverence. “I want you. I wanted you the first night we kissed. I wanted you before that, for so long.”
Still, it was nice to have a say in the matter. Thus far, all the candidates had been pleasant enough, but Draco liked one in particular. She had a breezy, distracted air, reminiscent of Luna Lovegood, and though she looked a little lost around the edges, her eyes had followed Draco’s every move, and she had been bold enough to try to piece together her own version of one of Draco’s teas.
They stayed with Luna for almost two more hours, and when Draco had finally stood to go, Harry stopped him, just for a moment.
“It kind of makes sense, looking back.” Ron nodded to himself, giving Harry a weighted once-over. “The way you two always followed each other around, couldn’t stop staring at each other. Guess there was something to that, after all.” Ron blew out an amused breath and shook his head fondly.
Draco swallowed hard and nodded. “Couldn’t th-think anymore. Needed to –
Harry chuckled softly, a little sheepish, but mostly relieved. It didn’t seem to matter so much, now that he’d finally allowed himself to think things through.
“You’re nervous,” Harry said, shutting the door and leaning against it. His heart tightened painfully with the observation, but he made no move to approach Draco, wanting to give him space. “Why are you nervous?”
Draco blinked at him slowly, but accepted the wand. He looked down at it for a long moment before scowling at Harry. “You have no business being this clever at such an unseemly hour of the morning, Potter.”
Harry found himself thinking of the previous Sunday. Halloween.
“We have ten standard teas permanently on the menu,” Draco continued, once Harry was obediently scrubbing, “but I create several specialty blends for each season. I was putting together a summer cherry medley when I cut myself. If you’d be willing to slice the rest of the cherries, I can manage everything else. There’s a fresh bundle of cherries on that shelf –” Draco pointed above their heads as Harry returned to the counter – “and a clean knife in the drawer next to you.”
“Oh.” Draco blinked down at his watch. “How unusually proper of you. I am aghast.” Looking down his nose at Harry, he spoke with exaggerated haughtiness. “I suppose I’ll have to accept.”
He shuddered and jerked his hips, straining toward Draco.
Lavender had blinked at Harry before turning her gaze on Draco, assessing him with a coolly calculating look. Draco felt himself growing pale under her stare. The scars from Greyback’s attack seemed to dominate her face, and suddenly Draco was drowning in fresh waves of guilt and fear and remorse.
Malfoy blinked, then seemed to consider Harry’s words. When he spoke, it was not the response Harry expected. “Do you want to be an auror?” he asked quietly.
Draco pretended to pout and made to get off the bed.
Harry’s breath hitched, and he slowly removed his fingers. Reaching for the lube, he coated his cock. The friction was almost too much, and he had to take a deep breath to calm himself. Draco looked up at him with a ruinous smile, impatience replaced with tenderness as he and Harry locked eyes.
It made Harry feel safe in a way he hadn’t felt for a long time, and he could not have been more grateful.
“Yes,” Draco cried, tugging at Harry’s shirt impatiently. “Potter,” he mumbled, as Harry’s mouth descended roughly over his.
When he returned, Draco had been sitting on the bed fully dressed. He was staring down at his hands, looking rather lost, but when Harry sat down next to him, his eyes cleared and his mouth twitched into the beginnings of a smile.
And shooting through the space between them, connecting their bodies at random points, were thin beams of light.
Draco closed his eyes. “Ok,” he said, his voice still a whisper.
“He was disappointed to miss seeing you, though,” Harry added gently.
pushed his magic deep inside –
Draco leaned his forehead against Harry’s, sighing in relief, but he stepped back hastily when McGonagall joined them.
Harry’s insides squirmed uncomfortably. He’d been avoiding the topic of Ginny with Draco, though he could not say why. Reluctantly, he nodded yes.
And in that moment, looking at the unhappy line of Malfoy’s back, Harry realized that the inverse was also true. How was Malfoy ever supposed to overcome
“Yeah.”
Harry gave him a little squeeze and playfully bucked his hips against Draco’s. “Are you sure you’re too full to –”
Draco gasped and Harry winked at him, tucking the tie into his back pocket, a tantalizing promise for the night to come.
“Oh,” Harry said, somewhat taken aback. “Yeah. Old Muggle stuff, mostly.”
Draco turned into the touch. Facing Harry now, he folded forward, propping his elbows against his thighs. His head hung limply, sunlight glinting off the strands of white-gold hair that obscured his expression.
Sidling up to him, Harry kissed his cheek. “You didn’t have to wait for me.”
Harry retaliated by spelling pebbles beneath Malfoy’s feet, causing the other man to topple into the lake. Upon resurfacing, Malfoy immediately popped off a spell that dried his clothes and momentarily deafened Harry with the same gust of wind. This bought him enough time to knock Harry back with several minor hexes in quick succession. Regardless, Harry counted the maneuver a win. He may have lost ground, but he had also
jittery throughout the morning, but that was only to be expected after the ordeal he’d had, and eventually, he settled enough that Harry felt able to broach the subject of Azkaban.
of all things! Does he wear aprons with bunny rabbits on them, too?”
done this before?” Harry couldn’t help asking.
Draco shivered against him, and his breathing began to slow.
“The way you were looking at the flowers, it was like you were –” Harry faltered, not sure he could explain. He gestured helplessly between them, waggling his fingers as if he could snatch the right words from the air. “It lit you up,” he said finally, “like you had never seen anything so wonderful.”
Harry gulped, his eyes tracking Draco’s fingers, sweeping down the expanse of newly revealed skin. Emboldened by Harry’s gaze, Draco trailed a fingertip down his own chest, pausing to circle one of his nipples. It hardened slowly, and Draco pinched it, releasing a breathy whimper. Harry had to stagger back to lean against the counter, his hands clenching on the edge of the sink.
“Yeah,” Harry said slowly. “But what does that have to do with –”
“Do you know how to do that?” Draco asked.
Draco went rigid. When he spoke, the words caught in his throat. “You – you told her about me?”
“I was going to get a sandwich.” The words tumbled off his tongue in such a rush that it took Draco several seconds to decipher their meaning. Potter’s blush deepened as he continued. “Do you – er, do you want to – to come along?”
Harry felt a rush of affection so strong that he almost fell to his knees in front of Draco. He struggled to compose himself as McGonagall’s attention shifted to him.
Harry must have cringed or looked uncertain, because Draco went on, as fiery as Harry had ever heard him. His eyes glinted dangerously, like a moonbeam across a blade. “I am not letting those fools anywhere near this. This is ours. Our sacrifices grew the flowers, your magic touched them, my blood woke them. Don’t you see, Harry? It has to be us.”
But as they had gone their separate ways that day, it felt like a seal had snapped shut on their intimacies, as if they had breathed all remnants of the war into a bottle that could be corked and thrown out to sea. They’d shown each other just enough to understand each other, bared their wounds and then bandaged them up again, ready to channel their restless energy and lingering traumas into the fight, into that spark of challenge that jumped between them during every subsequent duel.
cast Dark Magic.” Harry’s fingers shook and he released Draco’s hands. Squeezing his eyes shut, he whispered, “I didn’t think I could bear to do it if you were watching.”
“I like figuring out the mysteries,” Harry said. “It’s fun when it’s not real, like a puzzle.”
“It does help,” Harry said. “Thanks, Draco.”
Ron shrugged. “I told him he was still a bit of a wanker, but since I’d gotten a few punches in over the years, I figured we were ok now.”
Draco’s eyes snapped back to Harry’s. “Yes,” he said, after a weighty pause. “If you like.”
“I believe Mr. Malfoy accepted a small sum from his mother’s portion of the Black fortune, to help him get set up in London, but he has been supporting himself ever since.”
Harry whispered.
“I always preferred the term ‘nemesis,’” Draco deadpanned, and they both giggled.
The week’s workshop had focused on blending various charms into transfiguration spells, to create sturdy and permanent building renovations. For their final assignment, the professor expected them to work in pairs to completely remodel one of dilapidated structures.
He’s given me enough hints. But he can’t possibly – I mean, I’m not –”
“I’m sorry,” he said, fetching the pitcher of iced tea from the fridge.
“You’re Harry Potter! The hero of the wizarding world! And I’m sorry, I know you don’t like to be referred to like that, and that is not what I mean, not really, it’s just you’ve already done so much
“I’ll build a fire,” Harry said, guessing that Draco still needed the comfort of the fresh air blowing in through the open windows, however cold it got.
But Driffield dismissed Malfoy’s contributions, listening with a distracted air before moving on, never validating Malfoy, except for the occasional mumbled
Draco scurried over to his desk. His hands combed through the piles of parchment, searching for a blank page, a spare pen or quill. Scrawling down a few hastily compiled observations now would hardly satisfy Hermione, but it would be better than nothing.
Draco himself however, was still, almost unnaturally poised – painstaking control exerted over a body primed for flight.
He almost ended the conversation right then, but Malfoy’s steady grey eyes calmed him, and he felt able to continue. “It’s also because it could be - er, a weapon, of sorts. To help us fight.” Harry breathed in carefully through his nose to steady himself. “If I’m going to be an auror, I want to do
Blaise winced. “You’re a good friend, Draco,” he said solemnly. “Thank you.”
Maeve must have been remembering that day too, because all at once, the fight went out of her. She clucked her tongue and wrapped an arm around Draco. He melted into her, head resting on her shoulder.
Draco carded a hand through Harry’s wild mop of hair, easing him back against the pillows. He brought the cloth to Harry’s groin, washing him with gentle strokes.
Draco’s head snapped up.
Harry had been brushing aside his doubts about Malfoy, fleeing any thought of the man’s actions during the war, looking ahead to a future where Malfoy would say
“And I’m still angry.”
Harry mumbled a sheepish apology. When his heart slowed, he gave Draco a wry smile and continued. “No, definitely not. I think Lavender might want that, eventually, but I – I just can’t. I don’t want that kind of life anymore.”
“From my favorite sandwich shop,” Harry said between bites. “It’s where I was going the first time the apparition happened, when I knocked you over in the street.”
Draco leaned into Harry, closing his eyes with a slow, deep inhale. It reminded Harry of the moment before Draco had asked to try their first kiss again, like they were balanced on a precipice and Draco was steeling himself for the fall.
Even as he stiffened, Draco clutched desperately at Harry’s shirt, burying his head in the crook of Harry’s neck. Draco’s breathing was harsh, but he was very still, and Harry wasn’t sure if he was crying.
McGonagall’s frown deepened.
Startled, Harry blinked. He sat back down. “What?”
“I didn’t though,” Harry corrected him gently. “It was just a good guess. Your spell was moving toward me, and the magic was constantly shifting. It felt like change, like Transfiguration. I got lucky.”
tongue.”
Draco hummed in agreement without looking away from the horizon.
Harry grinned. “I know.”
“Don’t,” Harry whispered. “It’s ok. I love you. Everything’s ok.” He lifted his head, nuzzling Draco’s cheek before slotting their lips together.
that Harry could not control the gibberish that spilled from his mouth. He whined and cursed and begged, whimpered Draco’s name again and again, slurred out promises and thank yous and words of love.
“Draco,” Harry breathed. “Sweetheart, I won’t.”
Harry. He wished Malfoy was groaning for a different reason, wished he could cover Malfoy with his body, wished he was the one making Malfoy writhe and moan.
“Why –” Malfoy elaborated slowly, as if he were speaking to a child - “do you want to be able to do this, Potter? I wasn’t under the impression that your studies mattered much to you, as your Potions marks can attest.” His arms were crossed and he quirked one eyebrow at Harry.
“No,” Harry said firmly, then reconsidered. He wanted to be as honest as possible with Draco. “I mean, yes. A little. But not about that.”
“It was Blaise and Ginny,” Draco replied automatically. His fingers fumbled his tea cup, and he set it on the table before he could spill. “Not you.”
Breathing slowly through his nose to calm himself, Draco had embarked on a silent search of the cottage, testing every door and window with the same result. Finally, he had admitted defeat and ensconced himself on the sofa.
With an impressive amount of self-control, Draco managed to set aside that tantalizing comment to ponder later, quickly casting around for a way to distract Hermione. She had regained her composure and looked far too interested in the mention of Draco’s “Potions theories.” The last thing he needed was another Gryffindor do-gooder to nag him about his restricted magic.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
“It’s nothing,” Draco said, rushing to fill the awkward silence. “I had planned to begin work on my winter teas today – it takes quite a while to build up enough stock – but I seem to have misplaced my notes. I have new ideas, of course, but I also want to recreate last year’s most popular flavors. I could work backward without too much trouble if I had samples of the blends, but I just went through almost the entire storeroom and didn’t find anything.” He scowled crossly and grumbled, “I told Maeve not to meddle with my organizational system, but she never listens.”
There had been surprisingly little trouble after the incident three days ago, when he had chased after Malfoy and they had stumbled upon the Room of Requirement. Ron had been slightly gruff at lunch, but accepted Harry’s “
Harry’s mouth fell open.
The room grew darker as they rested against each other, slowly catching their breaths. Draco’s magic bobbed inside Harry, filling him up with lightness and air, until he was surprised not to float away like a balloon.
“I remember,” Draco said. He glanced sideways at Harry before quickly looking away. “You invited me to come with you.”
“It’s good to see you,” Ginny said, smiling down at him. She was dressed casually in one of her Quidditch practice jerseys, with her hair swept back in a messy braid.
“Yes,” Harry promised. “Yes, Draco. Yes.”
“No, Draco,” he said, trailing kisses along the entire length of the scar. “These are not marks of failure, or weakness, or shame.” Harry lapped gently at the inside of Draco’s wrist, tracing his fingers in a reverent caress over the marred skin of Draco’s other arm. Draco stilled, and though his breathing remained harsh, his body relaxed under Harry’s touch.
Looking at him, Harry’s heart quivered a little and then throbbed painfully.
“Yes,” Draco said. “Not
He moved to flank McGonagall’s left side. Draco stayed at the edge of the clearing, but shifted so that he was behind McGonagall as well.
Harry trailed his tongue over Draco’s hip, slowly easing him onto his back. He crawled between Draco’s legs and began to massage his thighs. Dropping his head, Harry teased Draco’s half-hard cock with the warmth of his breath.
But he couldn’t quite shake the feeling that running off to the Quidditch Pitch would be disrespectful to Luna and Padma. How could they indulge themselves after everything that had happened? Shouldn’t they be putting all their energy into investigating?
As they ate, conversation flowed easily between them, though there was an unusual tightness to Harry’s eyes that worried Draco. He did his best not to dwell on it, because Harry seemed happy enough. Perhaps he was just tired.
“That’s what you said last time,” Harry pointed out, “but you still came.”
“But I will promise you,” Harry went on solemnly, “that if we ever grow apart, it won’t be because of the past. It won’t be because of who we were or what we did during the war.”
Breathing out slowly, Draco felt some of the tension drop away from his shoulders and neck. He rummaged around the biscuit crumbs until he found a decently sized piece with plenty of chocolate and popped it into his mouth.
“Harry,” Draco gasped, sounding almost scandalized. “Have you done this before?”
But the magic held.
“Honestly, Potter.” Draco shook his head. “You accosted me in a bloody flower garden the night before and all but swooned over my waistcoat. I thought, maybe – but then of course, you missed my implication entirely, you innocent buffoon – and I thought, maybe not.” He shrugged.
“What’s all this, then?” Draco asked, skimming a hand across the stacks of parchment.
Harry raised his eyebrows and Draco blushed, but he didn’t drop his hand. They stared at each other for a moment, and then Draco broke into a brilliant smile.
Two children returned to the mat then, wearing padded helmets and comically large gloves. They bowed to each other and the audience before launching into a surprisingly fast-paced fight. Draco was mildly alarmed. The pair seemed awfully young to be participating in such a violent sport. Though he supposed he had not been much older when he’d played Quidditch for the first time.
They were in a wide, round space, canopied by a vast and incredibly intricate trellis-like dome. Wildflowers of every imaginable color grew over it, clusters of blossomed vines high above them, reigning over the chaotic wonderland of weeds and blooms that stretched across the ground. There was no pattern, no order to any of it, as if nature had adorned itself for a dozen different wild parties and never saw the point in dressing back down.
Draco’s shoulders tightened almost imperceptibly. “I work at a tea shop.”
Harry was moaning softly now, working a hand over his own hardness. It was good, so good, to touch himself while thinking of Draco. He hadn’t done this yet, hadn’t allowed himself to, had been afraid to look too closely at this tender thing growing between them, lest he spook it and chase it away.
Draco let out one last shuddering sob and dropped his head into his hands. This time, when Harry wrapped his arms around him, Draco did not resist.
A delighted laugh bubbled out of Harry, taking him by surprise. “I don’t know if I do,” he said slowly. A giddy kind of lightness rushed through his veins, as if his blood had been replaced by champagne. “But I think I really really needed to hear you say that.”
Harry yelped, stumbling along after Draco. “But – how?”
It wasn’t as easy as sensing another person’s magic or the aftereffects of a spell, but if Harry concentrated just a little past the point of comfort, he could do it.
A brilliant smile unfurled across Harry’s face. “You make me feel everything too.”
Draco poked at the dough in front of him, wondering whether caramel or butterscotch would best bring out the smoky richness of Novelle’s signature black tea. Maeve sidled up next to him before he could decide. She peered skeptically at the finely ground tea leaves that speckled the dough.
Draco tilted his head, nose scrunching as if he was having trouble picturing it. “Do you like it better than dueling?”
After a thoughtful pause, Draco replied, “Unexpected.”
At that, Harry shook his head almost violently, wrenching himself away from the image. Malfoy jumped, and the movement seemed to shatter the last of his restraint.
“Er – what?” Harry said, unsure if it was him or Ginny who’d lost the plot.
“Don’t be sorry,” Maeve said. “You needed that.”
With an involuntary sigh, he shook off the feeling and answered Draco. “I was trying to attach my new shelf to the wall, but I couldn’t get the right wand angle from the floor. I scrounged up that ladder from the garden shed. I guess it’s seen better days.”
the bloody boy who lived.”
“It’s fine,” Harry said, waving him off.
The non-expression on Draco’s face stopped Harry in his tracks.
“Thank you for inviting me, Mrs. Weasley,” Draco said, holding out a small parcel. “I brought you some teas from Novelle’s. Harry said you enjoy sampling different flavors.”
“Hmm?” Malfoy asked, but he didn’t seem to be listening. He was walking intently down the corridor, eyes roving over every inch of the wall.
“I wasn’t.” Draco smirked at him. “I think I caught a glimpse of McGonagall’s mysterious Unspeakables.”
“Wanker,” Harry muttered, but he was smiling, even if he still felt weak.
“Are we – ok?”
Harry raised his head. “Draco – no.”
It was lucky Draco was so good in the kitchen because his thoughts danced away from him then, as if they had slipped into a faery revel. His mind spun through the mists and glamours of an alternate universe, one in which there was no shadow on his past, nothing separating him from Harry, nothing to keep him from burying his hands in Harry’s hair and kissing him senseless.
Just this once, Harry had thought he’d get to explore Hogwarts’ mysteries for the joy of it, not because the world might be at stake.
Harry frowned and patted Draco’s cheek. “There, there. Don’t be sad.”
“Thank Merlin,” Harry said, taking his hand. “When I saw you do that spell – the look in your eyes, it felt like I could see your soul, like I finally understood everything you could be, and something just clicked.” He brought his mouth to Draco’s ear in an intimate whisper. “I think I fell in love with you that night.”
Its petals were tightly closed, but it shone with an iridescent gleam, as sharp and clear as if it were carved from glass.
For the length of two frantic heartbeats, Harry Potter stared at Draco’s exposed cock.
Harry’s own magic had knocked against Malfoy’s and fizzled pleasantly. It felt shockingly
“Wh-what?” Harry stammered.
Tears pricked at Harry’s eyes as he reached blindly for Draco. Clutching each other tightly, they stared at the smoke already blanketing the night sky. Those billowing grey clouds drifted sensually upward, draping tendrils over the Quidditch goal posts and blocking out the stars.
He was stiff at first, too formal. But then came a charming witch in a sparkling cloak, inquiring politely about different teas with a slight French accent that reminded Draco of his mother. She was effervescent, bubbling over with a wellspring of inner joy. Draco served her a crisp, herbal tea paired with spongy cake full to bursting with strawberries and cream. Her parting grin was so delighted, and so genuine, that Draco found himself stunned.
He broke the kiss and lowered his head to Draco’s nipple. Draco collapsed back against the pillows, trembling with need.
Malfoy hadn’t even apologized, but Harry had given him a second chance.
“He won’t mind,” Draco said. “Thank you for talking to me, Maeve. I’m sorry I shut you out.”
. I’m sweaty and disgusting because I fell asleep in the sun after taking a longer run than usual, not because I’m out of my mind with grief, alright? I’m sorry I haven’t talked to you, I was just – well, I don’t really know what, but I don’t want to talk about it.”
Still, attraction (even blatant attraction) was one thing, and asserting bisexuality (aloud) (to Draco, of all people) was quite another.
“That’s when Lavender hit me with the body-bind, and I just couldn’t take anymore. I was so worried about you, and I just – twisted out of it. I wasn’t thinking about the fight at all.”
“Voldemort?” Harry asked gently.
Harry attempted a laugh, but it seemed to die on his tongue. His eyes darted to Ron and then away again. “What about you?” he asked softly.
“It’s alright. I just finished my run, and I was planning to come over here anyway.” Harry swiped his sweaty hair away from his eyes with a grimace. “I was gonna shower first, though. I’m sorry if I smell.”
Malfoy was so close, mouth open as he panted from exertion, breath warm against Harry’s neck. The hair at Malfoy’s temples was damp with sweat, darkening into a deeper gold. His eyes held a victorious glint that Harry wanted to drown in.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” he whispered. “I know I didn’t ask, I know I’ve been distracted, but you could have said something – I would have listened, I would have made time for you. Don’t – don’t you trust me?” His bottom lip quivered, but he quickly bit down on it.
Maeve popped the scones in the oven and dusted off her hands, before taking Draco by the elbow. She barely came up to his shoulder, but Maeve was a hale old woman, and Draco meekly allowed her to lead him over to the plush sofa on the other side of the shop.
“Because you had to,” Draco insisted. He stroked a hand across Harry’s brow.
Harry was spared answering when Hermione yawned and announced that she was heading to bed. As she walked toward the dormitories, Ron gave Harry a sheepish look, his eyes trailing after his girlfriend.
When McGonagall did not immediately object, hope spilled from Harry’s heart, warming his chest and dancing its way into his fingertips. “And maybe you can suggest some students I can ask?” he added. “I want to collect enough testimonials for the application.”
Draco made a strangled sounding noise. His fingers clenched into the fibers of the rug as he held himself still for the space of one choked-down breath. Then, almost violently, he rolled himself on top of Harry and attacked his mouth.
“I think so. But it’s hard to be sure.” Harry blushed. “Every time I think something’s finally going to happen between us, he pulls away.”
“Did you know the Ministry restricted Draco’s magic?” Harry asked.
“But how did you – what in Merlin’s name – what
Draco pocketed his notebook, but before he could get to his feet Harry had dropped to his knees beside him.
Harry smirked at him. “Oh really?” he purred against Draco’s skin, tracing his tongue down to the hollow of his throat.
“No,” Draco said. “I’m not embarrassed.” The words were simple in their honesty, leaving him exposed. He sighed. “I suppose I just miss it. Potions, I mean.”
From the start, Maeve had centered the baking around Draco, relegating herself to a supporting role. He’d balked at first, insisting that he was not a baker, but Maeve was having none of it.
“Potter,” Draco growled threateningly.
“Shared trauma?” Harry suggested tentatively.
Draco’s hand tightened on Harry’s shoulder. “What did you do there?”
“It’s not incredibly consistent,” he admitted, “but everything I read had one detail in common. Residual Dark Magic poisons a
“No –”
“Fine,” Draco said.
“Yes, of course I do,” Harry said, his response immediate and emphatic. He rubbed the back of his neck and smiled a bit wryly. How had he managed to forget what it was like talking to Luna? She was like an infusion of Veritaserum, though thankfully, she was about a thousand times more comforting.
a former Death Eater, let alone one who worked in a tea shop and couldn’t do magic.
Harry swallowed past the sudden lump in his throat and kissed Draco tenderly. When they broke apart, Harry lifted himself to sit on the edge of the desk and pulled Draco between his legs.
Draco keened and lifted his chin, allowing Harry better access. “For revenge, of course,” he said, voice still too steady for Harry’s liking. “To finally get back at me for school.”
Draco exhaled in a messy rush. He pressed a fingertip to Harry’s name, then swept it reverently upward to touch the sentence about getting a drink. He felt untethered, as if he were floating toward the ceiling, a buoyant joy filling him up, even as a part of him mourned what could have been.
Harry knew he was pushing his luck, but he couldn’t stop himself from asking the obvious question. “What was it trying to tell you?”
“Hello, Blaise,” Draco said dully, hiding his lingering disappointment behind an unimpressed look. He rose imperiously to his feet and returned to his desk.
Draco started to fiddle with the knit blanket folded over the back of the sofa, braiding its fringe with restless fingers.
Soon, all would be well.
“Yeah, ok. I can see that,” Harry said slowly. “But how does that help us?”
Malfoy’s reply was strained. “Oh,” he breathed out, glancing at the moon and quickly looking away again. He tugged at his cuffs, then folded his hands awkwardly into his lap.
“Can we – will you –” Draco huffed out an embarrassed breath and ran a hand over his face, then looked up at Harry. He was so lovely, his skin glowing like they were already out in the fields, chasing after the winter sun. “Take me flying, Harry. Please?”
Jaffey fought her way free of the vines as the man asked, “Find anything?”
Blaise’s eyes widened.
He reached up to undo Draco’s bun and (fucking
, Harry thought, suddenly frustrated. He might have let it go then, except Malfoy was still there, and he was still
“No?” Harry waggled his eyebrows teasingly. “Thinking about me?”
Not wanting to interrupt, Harry had meandered over to join Ron by the fire.
“Why didn’t you burn that one?” Draco prodded gently, after a moment of silence.
And as the initial thrill of discovery faded, questions began to prick at Draco’s skin, shrouding him in a sudden doubt.
“Fuck off,” Harry grumbled, but soon enough he was laughing too.
“It’s ok,” he breathed.
Wincing slightly, Draco stuck the post-it back to the shelf and headed through the storeroom.
Draco nodded.
Malfoy huffed out a hollow laugh. “I was a Death Eater, Potter. A few insults from you is the least of what I deserve.”
Harry mumbled something incoherent.
Ron and Hermione were sitting calmly, clearly relaxed, and Luna had started humming.
way, that it made Harry’s heart feel tender, almost bruised.
“Why?” Harry asked. “Did you need me for something?”
“Right, yeah, ok,” Harry babbled, tugging on his hair in a belated rush of uncertainty. “Sorry, I’ll just –” his eyes roved wildly about the room, looking anywhere but at Draco – “sorry!” he almost squeaked.
Harry massaged his temples, trying to erase the words. They flashed mockingly in front of his eyes. He shook his head impatiently and refocused on Draco.
, exactly, but –”
What if it was Dark?”
Harry coughed once, roughly, as Ron and Hermione exchanged a glance he couldn’t interpret. Though neither objected to the tactless subject change, they made no move to answer.
“I know.” Draco smiled sadly. “Come on, Potter.”
“Well, what do you call it?” Harry challenged.
“Draco –”
Harry darted a look at Draco, who continued to be of no help at all. He was staring determinedly at the floor, face so pale he looked ill. His hands were clasped tightly together in his lap, and Harry thought they might be trembling.
“Because it would confound the detectives, so you would get away with it,” Draco explained.
offering something. Draco swallowed hard, and did not reply.
“It was a dark time,” Draco said abruptly, twirling one of the flowers between his fingers. “I had done enough terrible things by that point that I felt entirely worthless. But Evan was just a child, this bright spot of hope and resilience.” A smile ghosted across Draco’s face, fading as quickly as it had come. “I couldn’t hurt him. I couldn’t hurt any of them.” He ripped a petal from the flower, then cringed and set it down carefully in the grass. “So I forced myself to remember all the evil in me, and I turned the pain on myself.”
Harry swiped the crisps packets aside and crawled across the blanket toward Draco, not breaking their intense eye contact. Draco let out an undignified squawk when Harry pulled him into his lap, but then Harry was kissing him, sliding their lips smoothly together and sweeping a tongue inside his mouth. Draco sighed, every muscle relaxing as Harry held him close.
“No,” Draco said. “I was
“Hmm?” Draco breathed, burrowing a little deeper into the cushions. Slowly, he blinked awake, only to find his face smooshed into an unfamiliarly plump sofa. At that, the gravelly voice that had just called his name finally penetrated, and Draco jolted upright.
When they reached the archway leading up to Maeve’s flat, she shoved Draco in front of her, shooing him up the narrow flight of stairs. Draco’s complaints slowed as he clutched the smooth wood of the banister and tried not to trip.
With a grin, Draco snatched up his wand again and sent a whispered charm flitting off toward Maeve. She patted her headscarf and winked at him, as if she already knew exactly what his spell had done.
It was just after dawn, and the two wizards were in the courtyard outside the Great Hall, using Harry’s not-Aperiomancy magic (
“Draco,” he cried, the joy still bubbling out of him. “The flower magic, it’s still here! It’s
Draco gaped at her as she tugged him back down to the sofa and pressed the pack against his eye. She tutted at him softly when he was slow to take it from her.
“There are doors in the wrong places.” Draco pointed at three doors in turn, two to the left of them and one across the room. “The staircase is facing the opposite direction, and there shouldn’t be a door under it, either.”
“Er –” Harry gulped, unwilling to admit that what he’d been doing was contemplating a friendship with Draco. “I was fiddling with some spices, in my kitchen.”
The moon shone through two large windows above the bed, bathing the room in silvery light. And there he was. Harry Potter sat in the center of the bed, eyes wide and glistening with tears.
And besides, Harry didn’t have much else to do at the moment. Things were a bit boring, and – and lonely, with Ginny gone.
Harry opened to him, letting Draco guide the pace of the kiss, accepting whatever Draco wanted to give. The heat built quickly, a frantic edge to Draco's movements.
“Your tea doesn’t have enough blossoms in it,” Draco said suddenly. It sounded as though he considered this fact a personal affront.
threatening his family, and no one even tried to help him!” Harry scrubbed a hand angrily across his face. “He shouldn’t lose his magic for that.”
By the time Hermione joined them at the table, Draco had regained his composure and she had launched into questioning them without sparing a moment for awkward pleasantries. She acted as though breaking bread with reformed Death Eaters and childhood bullies was as natural as breathing, and soon enough her probing curiosity had smoothed the tension from Draco’s face. He had explained nearly everything, with Harry only contributing a few small points.
Expression still distant, Harry did not reply.
Sizzling sounds came from the stove as Draco dropped the first pieces of bread into the frying pan. He leaned over to sniff something bubbling in a small pot. His face screwed up for a second, before he brightened and added a pinch of cinnamon.
McGonagall coughed again.
“Really?” Harry exclaimed, rising up on tiptoes to better peer over the window ledge.
With a wicked little smile, he answered, “No.”
Draco whispered something then, a word that might have been
“No,” Draco said. “No, nothing like that.”
“Blaise will then proceed to ask me an absurd magical theory question that is just plausible enough to be intriguing. I will spend at least twenty minutes theorizing in response, during which he will genuinely listen, rather than nodding along with a glazed over expression, and that will be that. Apology accepted, friends once more.”
“You’d be a good one now,” Harry said.
This chapter describes a panic attack in detail.
If Draco had to look at him for another second, he would break beyond repair.
hit me. That was – an entirely separate incident.”
Driffield would often pause to ask Harry questions about the material, and would then somehow twist Harry’s blatantly wrong answers until they segued neatly into his next point. If Harry hadn’t been so irritated by the whole thing, he might have been impressed by the man’s sheer obstinacy.
“Did you know that magical sea turtles can burrow beneath the ocean floor to discover ley lines?”
“I was beginning to suspect as much,” sighed McGonagall. “And I am afraid it is past time to involve the Ministry.”
“I don’t think we would have survived it, if not for him,” Luna stated calmly. Her matter-of-fact tone put Harry more at ease. “He brought soup most days, and he made sure we had blankets. He charmed them invisible. Isn’t that clever?”
He fumbled the spoon when he realized what he’d said, fingers grown clumsy with fear at how easily the name came to his lips.
Draco’s entire body shuddered.
Unease prickled through Harry’s veins, chasing away the moment of warmth. Under the table, his fingers tightened on his thighs. He pried them loose and shook out his hands, attempting to dispel the fidgety panic that threatened to rise. Thoughts of Ginny trailed in the wake of his fear, reminding him that he now spent every night alone.
“He said –” Harry winced, and tried to cover it by clearing his throat. “He said you cast
Draco kissed Harry’s neck, then jumped slightly when Hermione cut into the conversation. Her voice was an odd mix of fascinated reverence and frustrated growl.
“It sounds silly,” Potter said, some color finally coming back into his wan cheeks, “but I use these white ones in the morning, for a blank slate.”
Harry closed the door behind him and they stood awkwardly for a few seconds, not quite meeting each other’s eyes.
“I think maybe I do,” Harry blurted out.
Draco was watching her uneasily. Harry reached out to squeeze his hand and was relieved to see some of the tension drop from Draco’s shoulders.
“That’s alright, Wilfred,” Harry said, scooping him up and setting him on his feet. “You’re doing really well.”
“But, also –” Draco trailed off.
“Would you mind vanishing those tea leaves?” Draco asked, standing to return the containers to the shelves. “It’ll be neater than trying to sweep it all up.”
“Why that moment?” Draco asked. “Shouldn’t there be more glass flowers then, if this book can be believed?”
She did not look up.
“Yes, well –” Draco blushed, huffing out an embarrassed breath. “They were beautiful, and fascinating. I suppose I didn’t like the idea of them being Dark.”
“Last night,” Draco said, “did I push you
“Makes sense.”
“Just a moment, Harry.” Draco stirred one of the potions with sure, quick strokes, counting aloud as he went. With his other hand, he sprinkled something glittery into a different cauldron. When he reached the number twenty-five, he waved a hand to adjust the height of the flames. Three of the cauldrons simultaneously erupted in bubbles, while the other emitted an odd chirping sound. These results apparently satisfied Draco, because he scooted away from his concoctions and turned to face Harry fully. “Yes?”
Draco closed his eyes again, astonished by the emotions he had seen rippling across Harry’s face.
Something weighty passed between them. Finally, Draco took a deep breath and nodded.
“Draco?” Harry gasped, immediately dropping to crouch beside him. “What happened?”
Luna giggled again. She stood on tiptoe to plant a kiss on Draco’s temple. “Thank you for defending my kingdom,” she whispered, before floating off toward the dormitories.
Harry was in Malfoy’s bed and Malfoy’s hair was tousled around his face and Harry was
“More, Harry,” Draco mumbled. “Need you, more.”
But Draco surprised him.
“You should take the potion too, Healer Tahlyn. And you, Headmistress,” he said. “It will prevent the residue from tampering with your spells.”
Finally Malfoy spoke.
Draco hummed consideringly, but then his eyes narrowed. “That doesn’t mean that the residue has
Some time later, Harry roused himself from where he had dozed off against Draco’s shoulder. A bit blearily, he stumbled into the bathroom and washed his face. Through the window, he could just make out the Quidditch stands, where the flowers were still growing, twinkling merrily in the sunlight. Harry looked back over at Draco and frowned.
“I want to say yes, but –” Draco shook his head. “I’m trying though, Harry. I really am.”
Draco heard shuffling footsteps and opened his eyes to see Maeve looming above them.
“What is it then?”
Harry tangled his fingers into Draco’s hair, lightly massaging his scalp. “How many times have you read it?”
“Don’t,” Draco said, pulling out of Harry’s grip. “It was my fault. I was weak.” He tilted his head and smiled wryly. “I never could fight like you.”
He wished it were a rainy morning, wished for a misty, grey dawn blanketed with clouds that he could burrow beneath. Cuddle into the bedclothes, turn away from the day, slip heedlessly back into dream-Draco’s arms without ever fully wakening. There was pleasure there, and love, sweat-slicked skin and friction, kisses and whimpers and Draco, always Draco, sharp and sweet and perfect everywhere Harry touches, with his hands, his lips, his tongue.
Draco’s eyes darted around the square again, as he struggled to think of a way to extricate himself from this mortifying situation. He had just about settled on forcing out a polite
“Y-you’re ok?” Malfoy stammered. He ran his hands up Harry’s arms and down his back, as if checking for injuries.
“Fuck if I know,” Draco grumbled. He stood and carried both their chairs back to the table. Suddenly feeling quite cross, he swept a hand over the surface, aggressively gathering biscuit crumbs into a neat pile. “She didn’t even ask us for the notes!”
“No, really,” Harry insisted. “Thank you, for being so – for not –” he paused, floundering for the right words. “For being ok with it. With him. I know I just sort of sprung it on you, and you probably still thought I was gonna marry your sister someday, and I just –”
Harry snagged a jug of pumpkin juice from the fridge and followed, pausing to choose two mugs from the shelf. He had set the mugs on the coffee table and poured the drinks before he realized that Draco was still standing. A steaming plate in each hand, he hovered uncertainly by the sofa, frowning into the distance.
Harry, however, found it hard to pay attention to anything else. His mind kept wandering down garden paths, stray thoughts snagging on lustrous petals and trailing in the wind.
“Yeah?”
“I already decided,” said Harry.
Draco tried to feel encouraged (or at least pleased) by that, and failed.
“Draco?”
He dropped his head against Draco’s shoulder with a sob.
“My thought,” Hermione continued, “is that the potion’s magic got knotted into the magic of your life-debts, invoking them indirectly.”
Before Draco could reply, Maeve chucked him fondly beneath the chin, exchanged the lilac tea pot for their empty one, and bustled her way back across the shop, pausing at each table to check in on the customers.
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry muttered, trying to feign annoyance while still chuckling.
Harry rubbed his thumbs across Draco’s knuckles. “I just – I didn’t want to put you through that.”
Draco shook his head, but he was smiling. A garish accessory like that should have looked ridiculous on a woman as old as Maeve, but she somehow managed to turn it into a dignified (if eccentric) fashion statement.
Harry hovered outside Draco’s door with a large takeaway cup that was scalding his fingers. Slipping his wand from his pocket, he charmed the container to make it cool to the touch. Practical as the spell was, he knew he was stalling.
“No embarrassment, remember?” Harry said, somehow knowing exactly the right thing to say. “That’s what you told me.”
Draco was allowed good things. He was allowed to fall in love. He was allowed to
And when they came, it was bright as a bonfire, sparks crackling to life along every inch of their skin. Still glowing, Draco collapsed atop Harry. He was more beautiful than ever, and in his eyes, Harry could swear he saw stars.
whimsical,” Maeve cut in, sweeping over to set a large tray of pastries on their table. “And whimsy sells tea.”
Harry had clearly unsettled her. She’d probably thought he was hungover, feeling the effects of a late night out with friends. She’d probably expected him to wave her off or make a joke before dragging her into the gym.
That brought Draco up short, snapping him out of the fog of doubt and longing clouding his mind.
For a moment, Draco just stared at Harry. The memory of Draco’s screams seemed to echo in the space between them. Tears pricked at the corners of Draco’s eyes. He was ashamed that Harry had seen him like that, and yet profoundly grateful that he hadn’t had to face it alone.
. Malfoy didn’t seem bothered – just coolly continued taking notes or practicing wand movements – but Driffield’s attitude was driving Harry
“But I wasted your whole day!” Harry protested, glancing ruefully at the scattering of stars he could see out the window.
“After the war, falling back into you was easy,” Ginny said. The corner of her mouth crooked up and she knocked a knee against Harry’s. “You were handsome and kind and – a little bit broken.”
Draco’s eyes were intent on Harry’s, bottomless grey pools that shone in the afternoon light, rippling with pain and gratitude and something else Harry could not quite decipher.
“Put the suit on, Potter. We –” he trailed a hand across Harry’s hip and palmed his erection teasingly – “are going out.”
he admitted to himself,
Draco thought a moment, then brightened. “I’ve just the thing.”
Madam Pomfrey bustled toward them and swept her wand in a wide arc. She made a snatching motion, and glowing blue symbols took shape, hovering over every inch of Harry’s skin. It was like what McGonagall had done to him after they tested the Death Eater wands, but infinitely more complex.
The word echoed between them, as Draco let himself take in all that it meant.
Harry and Malfoy raced each other across the Pitch – diving and circling, darting in to cut each other off. Even when it became apparent that it was far too dark to actually capture the snitch, their fierce competition raged on.
Harry whined, hips jerking involuntarily, his leaking cock smearing wetness across Draco’s hip. Even panting for breath, Draco managed to chuckle softly. He looked too beautiful to be real, stretched out and bathed in light from their enchanted ceiling. When they first worked on the cottage, Draco had told Harry he'd always fancied sleeping under the stars.
Harry rubbed his thumb in circles over Draco’s palm. “I think they needed
Draco looked interested, if still faintly puzzled.
“I know. I’m still thankful.”
Harry. Colors exploding everywhere, green and brown stems growing wildly all around, nothing to constrain any of it. It reminded me of how I was always drawn to the Forest at Hogwarts. I never went in, of course, not after first year.”
echoed in his mind, threatening to drag him back into the gut-wrenching despair that had clawed at him in the night.
Harry shook his head. “She shouldn’t be alone right now.”
It wasn’t a question, but Harry nodded, oddly touched.
clawing up from his chest. For a moment, he felt so hollow that he half expected to pop out of existence and find himself prostrate on the ground at Potter’s feet.
“Fuck, yes, Draco,” Harry babbled. “Draco,
Before Harry could react, Draco had shattered the heated moment, launching gracelessly into a monologue about the soup. He babbled about stock and black verses red pepper and the importance of whisking in the cream. All the while, he did not look at Harry, unable to face whatever emotion might be lurking in his eyes.
Hermione made a noise like she wanted to interrupt, but Draco was entirely focused on Harry, as if they were the only two people in the room.
He was about to say as much, when Malfoy reached out to him.
Harry twisted his fingers together nervously. “Did it - er, go ok?”
“On my way to get a sandwich.”
“It is necessary, if I say it is necessary,” she stated firmly. Clapping her hands together as if the matter was settled, she tapped her wand against a pear-shaped crack in the wall beside her. “Now then, I believe a celebratory breakfast is in order.”
“I admit the titles may need some work.”
The three of them were sitting around the table in Harry’s sun-dappled kitchen. Though Draco held himself rather stiffly, he had been perfectly polite, and Hermione seemed entirely at ease. She had hardly reacted at all when she stepped out of the floo to find Draco and Harry squabbling over the last triangle of cheese toastie. Draco had just poked Harry in the ribs and taken a triumphantly huge bite.
“Of course,” Draco said, voice a hoarse rasp. He flexed his fingers, fighting off the jolt of pain that had flashed through him at the request.
Nothing had ever sounded so sweet.
“Of course you are, Harry,” Hermione soothed, her expression softening.
“Harry,” Draco mumbled, taking another massive bite. “So good.”
“Hang on –” Harry attempted, but Ron spoke right over him.
“You’re right,” she said softly, stroking his hair. “I’m sorry.”
Harry breathed out a startled laugh. Fire flickered in Draco’s eyes for another moment before guttering out. He turned his head to the side and echoed Harry’s laugh, sounding a bit sheepish. He stood abruptly and moved to join Harry on the sofa, sitting far closer than he had before Harry’s nap. Their thighs brushed, sending a flare of heat up Harry’s entire side.
“Please, Draco.”
An ocean landscape on a beautiful summer day. Gulls cried out in the distance, mingling with the sounds of waves crashing against the shore. The wind picked up, carrying the scent of salt and brine as the air warmed.
“Life-debts dissipate naturally once they’ve been fulfilled,” Hermione shrewdly pointed out. “So I assume the best course of action is for you to continue helping each other, and eventually the apparition will stop on its own.”
“Oh,” he breathed, eyes wide. “I – I assumed you knew.”
“I’m Harry,” Harry offered when she glanced up at him again. “What’s your name?”
“Oh, Draco,” he gushed. “I think this might be better than
“Oh,” she said, biting her lip, “I’m sorry.”
Malfoy huffed out a breath, then sat up straight, stretching his legs out across the bed. His eyes hardened, and he raised his chin.
Silent tears were streaming down Draco’s face as he stared at Luna. Harry reached for him, but Luna got there first. Draco buried his head in her stomach and continued to cry. She wrapped her arms around him and gently stroked his hair.
Harry reached out and tentatively touched his shoulder. He flinched when Draco jerked away.
He continued to thrust against Draco as he palmed his cock.
When Draco finally strolled back into the room a few minutes later, Harry’s heart almost stopped.
Harry frowned, the guilt giving way to prickles of anger. But then Ginny continued, and Harry understood.
“Oh, er – I dunno.” Harry scratched at the back of his neck, trying to think. Blaise was Draco’s best friend, not to mention Ginny’s boyfriend, and Harry wanted to get on well with him. “The ones hidden in plain sight, I guess,” he said slowly.
Sated now, drowsy and content with Draco’s legs tangled in his own, Harry had finally become curious about Draco and Hermione’s conversation.
“Oh.” Draco blushed. He was flustered, thrown into the tangle of desire and confusion that worsened every time he was unexpectedly confronted with Harry. This was the first time Harry had ever commented on it though.
“And the Room of Requirement?”
“Holding steady! Not sure how much longer I can –” She cut herself off, whipping her wand in an intricate pattern.
– and had to close his eyes against a sudden wave of desire.
beginning to,” Draco amended, opening his eyes again and smiling wryly at Harry. “Finding out what Blaise did – it made everything feel precarious. Like we were doomed to fall apart.” Draco sighed. “Everything we have was built on a joke, on a
“Morning, darling,” Harry purred. “Do you want to come in my mouth?”
“This is incredible,” Harry moaned, basking in the aroma of the best tea he’d ever had. It was an oddly bright green color, but it tasted strong and rich, with just the right amount of syrupy sweetness. He took another large swallow, sighing happily as the flavor burst across his tongue. “What’s it called?”
The words burst from them, almost overlapping. The idea crested the hill like a snowball, barreling downward and growing as it picked up speed.
She gave him a little squeeze. “Just go talk to him, Harry. It’ll be alright.”
“No, no,” Ginny backpedaled, “I just meant, when Ron told me, I didn’t think past the apparition part. I didn’t even wonder if it could affect your feelings.”
