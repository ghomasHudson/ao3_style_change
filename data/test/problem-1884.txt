“Draco, what? What is it? Am I doing something wrong?” Harry pleaded, needing to know the answer to his question.
They both headed inside the Room of Requirement, not looking at each other, the air tense and heavy between them.
Draco found he had started to cry. He tried to conceal his tears from Harry, but it was too late, Harry already saw.
for all that he’d done. Not just in the last two weeks, but in the past year; for saving his life multiple times. “Thank you,” Draco started. “Not just for- for. Uh, I mean, thank you for setting this all up. It’s very kind of you.” He wanted to smack himself for being a coward
Draco saw a couple of heads nodding along to what Elizabeth was saying. He didn’t know what to think of her words. Sophrosyne sounded fake. It probably was. It was likely Elizabeth had just made up that word. Draco would know, he was good with words. He spent a lot of time reading challenging passages when he was younger, broadening his mind to new and complex words, and he’d never heard of sophrosyne. It was a nice thing to think about, though. Finding inner peace and one’s true self.
Because Potter saved everyone. But if that were true, where had Potter been the other times Draco had been attacked? He didn’t save him then, and he wouldn’t save him now. For some reason, that thought stung. The incident where Draco was stuck in a broom closet did not count. He hadn’t been hurt in any way, unless you counted his hurt pride.
Harry’s face instantly reddened. Never a good sign. “Well, you’ll be displeased to know that I did, in fact, carry you up to the castle.”
“I’m shocked,” Draco deadpanned. Harry didn’t respond, but he did chuckle, and Draco had an inkling he possibly had found Ursa Minor, just by the way he was staring serenely at the sky, the stars winking at him. “You know I used to loathe my name,” Draco said.
Here they were now, Draco grasping the edge of the sink and Harry consistently knocking on the door, not leaving well enough alone.
“What the fu- Malfoy. Seriously.” Potter eyed Draco up and down, taking in his Slytherin attire. Draco felt himself blush under Potter’s gaze, and immediately picked a spot on the wall to stare at, giving himself something to do other than have to acknowledge his awkward stance in front of Potter.
“It’s not going to kill you, young man. Quite the opposite. You will feel much better after you take it. Now drink up.”
. It was actually fucking writhing on his forearm, just like it had done when The Dark Lord was alive. He blinked a couple times. He was definitely imagining it. But when he stared at it, long and hard, he was starting to actually believe it
“It’s just something- I- well, I’ve had for a while. Probably had it since last June. And-” Harry stopped talking, grasping something from behind his neck. Draco had no clue what Harry was doing, but once he was done fiddling with whatever was hidden behind his neck, Draco saw plain and clear Harry was holding a necklace.
.” Potter got up from his seat, and started browsing the shelves, looking for what Draco hoped was a book that could break whatever enchantment Snape placed on his mysterious book.
Draco was about to tell Potter they should head straight to their usual spot in the library when he grabbed Draco’s elbow, stopping him in his tracks. The contact sent a chill throughout Draco, and he was startled at Potter’s nearness.
“Malfoy, can you tell me what happened?” Granger sounded worried, and her voice was full of distress. He shook his head, he definitely did not want to tell her what happened. He wasn’t going to tell anyone what had happened, except for Pansy. But Pansy wouldn’t tell anyone if he asked her not to, he knew for a fact.
Potter’s hands went up in mock surrender. “I won’t, I won’t. You’re talking about Theodore Nott, right?”
Potter pulled up the handle, and the hatch came loose so that Potter could physically pick up the square plank of wood and move it aside. Draco peered over Potter’s shoulder, and inside the hidden compartment he could see a book. A dusty, old, leather book that was about the size of Draco’s hand.
They walked out of the library, and Draco looked longingly down the corridor that led to the fifth floor. It was stupid, since they were going to eventually make it to the Garden, but making a stop in the Room would take away their already limited time.
He was glad to hear that Harry had stuck up for him, but was also mad at him for getting himself into so much trouble that he wasn’t even able to visit Draco anymore. The git.
He had been in a holding cell, in Azkaban for most of the summer. It had probably been one of the worst experiences of his life, and that said a lot. It was dark, cold, windy, and terrifying there. Although, the dementors no longer guarded the place, which was one upside. Azkaban had felt like one long, endless night. His father had been in the cell next to him, and they had never spoken once to each other. His mother had been stuck at the manor, under the observant eye of the Aurors. Only Marked Death Eater’s had been placed in holding cells, awaiting their trials. Draco’s trial, along with Lucius and Narcissa’s had been around the middle of August, all on the same day. First came Lucius’, who got sentenced to eight years in Azkaban. Draco had expected that outcome, he hadn’t been surprised in the slightest, and yet the sight of his father being pulled out of the room by the Aurors, face set in an unreadable expression, and his mother silently crying, made him almost start weeping. He didn’t, though.
“We’re talking about mistakes now, huh?” Potter said as he started trudging back towards Hogsmeade village. Draco stayed quiet. He admitted to himself, he had walked right into that one.
but now you want to stop and do-” Draco gestured at Drys’s pointed wand- “whatever it is you’re about to cast over me, and you’re making time for a bloody duel. What happened to the urgency, Drys?”
“You know this sort of reminds me of sixth year, on the Hogwarts Express. Except the other way around.”
But no matter how many comments they endured, how many disapproving looks were shot at them, Draco knew that it was better than hiding; better than having to pretend he wasn’t stupidly in love with Harry.
Draco shook his head slightly, clearing away the shock, and stuffed his wand back into his robes. He knew he should have probably done something to help Theo, but he didn’t seem to be near the brink of death, or even have a concussion. Plus, the twat fucking deserved it.
The Auror who had said he was arrested came up behind McGonagall. “Mr. Malfoy, I-” he glanced at McGonagall, and she glared at him. “I would like to ask if you would be willing to be subjected to either Veritaserum, or place your memories in a Pensieve.”
“No, I promise I didn’t,” Draco told him truthfully. “Ever since the Sleeping Curse, it’s been bleeding in random intervals. The two weeks I was confined to the Hospital Wing, it bled every day; I think it’s trying to get rid of Drys’s magic that was left behind from when he was in control. But ever since I left the Wing it just decides to bleed randomly--not very often, though--and I have wraps from Madame Pomfrey to wrap it up in when it does.”
Draco honestly didn’t fully understand it. The idea that Potter was being pleasant towards him now, when that morning he had called Draco a name he absolutely hated hearing. Though Draco supposed he had also been pleasant towards Potter at Hogsmeade. He guessed they were both trying, even if they didn’t know they were. Maybe Potter was trying a bit more than Draco, but whatever. It wasn’t Draco’s place to offer to
Ron and Harry haven’t spoken much to each other since New Year’s, instead choosing to sit together in silence. It’s not like their fights of the past, this one feels so much worse. Hermione says it’s because everyone’s hurting and
I’m so tired all the time. I don’t want to have gone through this just for the next generation to go through it too. It feels like a waste of everything, like it was all for nothing - if nothing changes.
Harry feels like he can’t breathe, the lump in his throat burns as tears prick his eyes. “It’s him,” Harry wheezes, “This is all him.”
Harry feels raw when he asks, “Will you come back to see me again?” It’s too vulnerable, divulges too much of himself – exposes him in a way he does not wish to be exposed, reveals something of a side of himself that is not ready to be poked.
“So, so good,” Draco says, bringing his other hand to the back of Harry’s head, hand tight in his curls, thrusting up into Harry’s quickening pace. “Oh my – fuck, yes, so good, you know you always fuck me so good, I love it, I love you, I love,
“You heard me,” Hermione says, circling around to face Harry with a finger pointed towards his chest. “Are. You.
Harry’s heart flutters against his ribcage and Harry moves to get under the duvet with Draco. Leaning into the other man, Harry tries to spot any fresh bruising along Draco’s neck.
Neville shrugged. “He said Malfoy has this way of making you feel like you’re the only person in the world.” Harry had frowned as Neville continued, “Theo says that one day, he just got tired of being the only person in that world.”
He’s incoherent and babbling, begging for so much more than release and Draco’s eyes are on him the whole time. He doesn’t look away, doesn’t let Harry bury his head into the crevice of his neck, holding on tight to Harry’s hair, pulling him back if he drops his head for too long.
“Do you need me to pull up his medical records, Potter? I’ll gladly do it, if only to show that my son has been struggling with his addiction for the past three or so years." Narcissa Malfoy sneers at him. "He was getting better. Of course, until he started living with you.”
They all share a laugh and Draco offers Harry a spliff, while him and Pansy snort another line of Pixie Dust. Harry’s throat is dry as he watches him do it and wonders what it feels like. Draco is the definition of debauched, with his hair dishevelled the way it is and white button down open and revealing.
“I’m sorry, Harry. But this potion is far too dangerous to have more than a group of two people working on it.”
Draco reluctantly dropped his hands so that his face was visible once more, and fiddled with them in his lap. “What?”
Draco believed time had truly frozen. They both didn’t move at all. Draco was sure he and Harry both stopped breathing, maybe even blinking too. Their faces were just
Draco couldn’t think of a single reason why he, Draco, should be concerned, he was living his fantasy. He’d kissed Harry Potter. His life was basically complete.
Thinking of both the real Snape and Dumbledore made him wonder what the portraits of them both were up too. Certainly nothing interesting. He chided himself for not remembering they were in the fucking castle with him and Harry, with the option of asking them questions if need be.
It made him put things in perspective, honestly. What Harry thought of his Muggle attire did not matter in the grand scheme of things. And besides, what he was wearing now was much more comfortable than his heavy robes. The Room had even provided him with a jumper that was tight around the cuffs; he didn’t need to wear cuff-links or magic his sleeves at all, which he was grateful about.
He could have sent a letter for help, since the owl had successfully breached the ward without disintegrating, and yet he chose to send a letter to his father. Sure, he didn’t know the letter would be successfully received by anyone, but he could have at least tried. He thought briefly of sending another letter when he heard Potter cry out, “Draco, Draco! Come here!”
“Why certainly, Mrs. Malfoy. You can stay for as long as you like,” McGonagall said politely as she sat down in her chair. Draco followed suit, and carefully lowered himself into the seat opposite McGonagall.
Pomfrey looked like she was still expecting an answer from Draco, and he knew he would have to give it to her at some point. He sighed and said, “No, I didn’t harm myself.” Madame Pomfrey seemed like she was anticipating a much more detailed answer, so he unwillingly went on. “I was… attacked. I’m pretty sure they’re the ones who cut me.”
It was probably the most comfort he had ever received in his life, and he was glad it was Harry who was comforting him.
it had seemed, and he recalled how the freezing snow seeping through Draco’s clothes had been hugely outweighed by Harry’s body heat. He remembered drunkenly giggles and sloppy kisses, Harry’s hands roaming Draco’s body- but not going too far, their tongues exploring each other’s mouths, and the way how Harry’s mouth felt so good on his neck, nipping and sucking and making him disappear into the abyss.
Draco got up off the floor and made his way over to Harry. Whatever was bothering the Gryffindor, Draco wanted to fix it immediately.
Harry was just so fucking persistent. Draco had thought that after a couple days of himself clearly avoiding Harry, he’d lay off a bit. Although, he secretly loved that about him.
“There are not enough words in any language to describe how sorry I am for lying to you, Harry, and snogging you last night with the weight of all my lies was wrong! I know now! I’m so, so sorry. Just- please don’t wander the castle alone. It’s truly not safe. Please.”
“Did I miss the exam?” he whispered to her. Even though he knew he hadn’t, there were no exam sheets out on the tables, and it wasn’t like he’d been super late after all. But, it seemed like the appropriate thing to ask at the moment.
That’s when Draco realized Potter was in his class. Shouldn’t he already be down there? What was he doing all the way up here? Draco's mouth moved before his brain could even comprehend he was speaking.
Draco and Potter both let out a collective gasp at the sight. Whatever Draco was expecting to happen to the rock Potter had thrown, it most certainly wasn’t
wrist. Draco felt a chill travel up his spine, and then he stopped in his tracks, hoping he wasn’t going to look into the eyes of the person he wanted to see least of all right now.
“This past summer. The same day I met his dad, and the last day. When Hogwarts opened back up again in September, Drys left the country. He was in grief, I’m guessing, and had to get away from England. Kind of shitty to leave Alec behind, which is probably why Alec behaves like he does to everyone; his dad fled the country without him.
“It’s alright, Draco,” Harry said, the pads of his fingers still gently touching his cheeks. “I don’t care, you know. I don’t care about the Mark; you’re so much more than it, and it certainly doesn’t define you--I’d know.”
“Mad at you? Of course.” Draco gave a small smile. “You disfigured my face. But, what’s done is done, and Merlin knows I deserved it. You should see my chest if you think my cheek is bad.” Harry gasped, eyes moving to Draco’s chest. Draco laughed. “If you think I’m going to show you those scars, you’re wrong. It’s freezing out here.”
“He’s not my friend.” Draco knew he should just keep silent, but he was in a rather risk-taking mood today, he’d already had a full on conversation with Potter, of all people.
During his first week back, he also started working up the courage to apologize to some of his peers, like Granger and Weasley. More progress.
“Why not make Alec the one who would be able to procure Harry’s blood?” Draco asked, seeing a weak spot and wanting to pry even farther. “Drys, you said I was the perfect candidate. But why not use your own son instead? Surely, after two weeks trapped with Harry, Alec would have been able to become close to Harry? Do you not trust him?”
Draco couldn’t blame him, the Garden of Mystics was the most stunning place he had ever seen. That said a lot, since he liked to believe his own garden back at the Manor was lovely, but the Garden of Mystics undoubtedly out-shined any other location by far.
“Oh, Draco. Playing the hero, I see,” Drys said, “You could have had it all. You could’ve kept your precious family and
Draco stood his ground, trying not to come across absolutely furious at Drys. Drys had put so much thought and work into wanting to control the Death Eaters and and kill the Purebloods, wanting them to feel the despair and hopelessness as they watched the Muggle-borns rise to the top. To Draco, it just seemed easier to grieve Olive, instead of concocting a whole evil plan to take over the world.
Draco was filled with relief at the sight of him. He never wanted to feel that worried again, even if it was for about two minutes.
What caught his eye, though, was a piece of parchment lying on the desk, above a bunch of other papers, that had the signature
“Aren’t you going to explain to me what your plan is and what it has been all along?” Draco asked, another spell hitting his protective shield.
There were obviously lots of people who loathed him, and wished him dead- people he did not know at all- but Draco really had been expecting that the Figure would have
Potter was standing beside Draco’s bed. His hair was wet and a few drops of water clung to his eyebrows. He definitely just got out of the shower. He was wearing Muggle jeans and a plain red t-shirt. He was also wearing some sort of necklace, however Draco couldn’t see exactly what was on the end of the necklace, since the chain was under his shirt.
The vial was right in front of Theo’s lips now, and Draco hoped he wouldn’t have to pry them open to force down the potion. Luckily, as the top of the vial parted both lips, and Draco tilted the vial back slowly, he could tell the potion was going down smoothly into Theo’s throat.
“But you wrote that letter and had that vision when we had already become friends, Draco. You know that. Don’t make excuses.”
Draco backed away a little, giving Harry the space he so obviously wanted. He could see the hickey on Harry’s neck, and Draco presumed his own neck sported several bruises too.
“Hi, Professor.” His hands were starting to become extremely sweaty, but he refused to wipe them on his robes, which would clearly show the two former headmasters how nervous he was, if they couldn’t already tell.
“I won’t leave without telling you again. I promise, Draco,” Potter said with what seemed like absolute clarity.
Of course, the Aurors had to check if there were any dangerous charms on letters sent into Azkaban, but that didn’t affect Draco’s plan in the least. The only charm he would be placing on his letter was Obice Confractus, and that was hardly a dangerous spell.
Draco tried to form a coherent sentence. His throat was clogged and the world felt dizzy. “I killed him, Harry. I killed Drys. I even killed my own father.”
Speaking of the killing curse- Madame Pomfrey, the Aurors, the Minister, and literally anyone who’d visited Draco, wasn’t able to figure out how Draco had survived it. He was officially the second person in history to have been hit with
“Hello.” Draco fucking hated himself. He was brought up on social etiquette and he couldn’t even stutter out anything more than a simple
Well, it wasn’t so much of a necklace as it was a chain with a piece of something red dangling on it.
Technically, he wasn’t stealing the book. He’d return it to the tabletop when he was done, but he had to find out more about his Mark.
It seemed like a lot of time had passed, and Draco knew Pomfrey definitely should have come out of one of her rooms by now. She was always so organized and her eyes were on the clock constantly. Had she overslept? Was she running some kind of errand? He was certain Pomfrey would never do the first, and if she had left her seclusion in the Hospital Wing, she undoubtedly would have told Draco and got someone else to watch over him.
“What part of ‘trying to be nicer’ don’t you understand? I’m sorry for all the shit stuff I said and did to you earlier, okay?” Potter stated.
Draco remembered how weird the Garden was when he’d first walked in; there were no windows that would allow in sunlight, let alone rain or any water source, and yet the plants had all been in perfect condition. He’d guessed someone had had to cast specific spells to keep up the maintenance in the Garden, but he’d also known that the caster had to be an extremely powerful wizard.
“So, let’s go around and share one good thing that happened this week, and one not so good thing,” She said.
chose to follow him and you saw how horrifying he really was first hand, so, unlike people who fought on the right side, even after all this time you still can’t bear to hear
Drys was standing impatiently behind Alec, his arms crossed and a firm expression set in place. He whispered something to Alec, and although Draco couldn’t hear what was said, he’d bet it had to do with something along the lines of: “Hurry. Up.”
However, Draco did know how to deal with blood. He wasn’t amazing at healing spells, but he knew some that would more or less get the job done.
He turned himself back around, only to see what the noise was all about, and had taken one step forward. That one step was all that was needed for the broom closet to literally
“The paper was due the next day, and I had spent days writing the paper; I did not want to rewrite it. So next day in class when Professor Vector was collecting our assignments, I told her I had already handed mine in a couple days previous. It wasn’t hard to believe. I usually get my work done early. All she said was a quick little, ‘Oh,’ and scurried off. She’s terrified of me and I don’t think she wanted to spend more time talking to me than she had to, so she never even brought it up again. I’m pretty sure she gave me an O for the paper, and I never had to complete that assignment.”
Draco sighed. He knew he didn’t have to tell Harry anything if he didn’t want to, they sorted that out; allowing the other their personal space and privacy, and not trying to pry. But, Draco found he did want to consult Harry.
Harry held him tighter. He held him closer and more lovingly and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, folding his hands at Draco’s stomach. They were still sitting in the snow, and the snow was still falling freely. The wind had luckily died down a bit, but the temperature was still freezing. The heat from Harry’s body, however, made him warm. He felt like he had the universe at his back, at his waist, and at his shoulder, where Harry was resting his chin.
He was about to rest his head back on Harry’s shoulder when Harry lifted his free hand, brushing away the tears on Draco’s face.
The small noises of the outside surrounded them as they sat together. Draco still had something he wanted to say, but he couldn’t think of a proper way to say them.
Please tell me what you thought of the first chapter, since this is my first time writing a fic I want to know if I'm doing anything horribly wrong haha.
“Fine. Whatever. But if you waste our day because you don’t want to offer up a secret of yours, I will be
For what seemed like the hundredth time that week, he and Potter were back to sitting at their usual table in their usual seats, with Snape’s book out and open between them, on a blank page.
It made sense, but it also didn’t. He now knew why his Mark had pulsed and ached and burned for two weeks; because it was calling out to its new master, wanting Draco to accept the pull and give in. His Mark definitely was much worse outside surrounded by Death Eaters and Drys, but he still wasn’t giving in, like giving in was the harder option, not easier. How could that be?
“Did you just call me Draco?” He raised an eyebrow at Potter, who finally let go of Draco’s elbow. Draco found he missed his touch, even if it was freezing cold.
“So, Draco Malfoy, tell me,” Harry took a bite out of a large piece of treacle tart. “Why did you return to Hogwarts for eighth year?”
“You’ll get it. I know you will,” Draco said easily. Like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
“You sacrificed your life for me, Draco. And the only difference with your situation than with my mum’s, was that when I was a baby, I didn’t really know my mum. I couldn’t love her the way people love each other when they’re older and understand emotions. The mixture of your sacrifice, and…” Harry trailed off, pointedly not looking at Draco and blushing ferociously.
The lyrics danced around in Draco’s head, and although he had absolutely no clue what the lyrics meant, he found the song incredibly enjoyable. However, he would
So they set off, peering through windows of shops that were locked, which was all of them. Draco guessed the ‘sleeping curse’ struck when everyone was sleeping during the night. It would make the most sense. They had found Hogwarts students in their beds, with the exception of a few Slytherins who had stayed up to study. That meant the owners of all the shops were probably in their own beds.
Now that Draco was looking at the book, which was more like a journal of sorts, Draco became optimistic.
Realization was dawning on Draco, and a lump was forming in his throat. He didn’t think he could speak quite yet.
“It’s me, Potter,” Draco responded. He crossed his arms over his chest, glaring at Potter. He was still mad at him, and he had specifically told Potter
you would have survived the killing curse, but the rest of my body kept screaming to me the opposite. Honestly, thinking at all was incredibly hard. My sole, almost incoherent, thought was to get to Hogwarts, so that's what I did.”
He might be wrong, he could totally be misinterpreting Potter’s expressions, but something in the back of his mind told him he was right, that Potter was suffering.
“Silencing charms, you know, around your bed. So then know one can hear you when you have nightmares and make noise.”
“But after all that time, when the war was over and I was set free, somehow not dead, I realized I needed to
Draco walked back to the Slytherin common room with Pansy by his side, who was chattering on and on about different kinds of spell work. He pretended he was paying attention, and nodded his head enthusiastically when she turned to look at him when she stopped talking to take a breath.
That was when Draco took a brief look at Harry’s lips. They were right above Draco’s, and he wished he knew how soft they were. He thought he saw Harry glance at Draco’s lips, but he was still slightly delusional and the world was still foggy, he knew he had made it up.
been able to send a letter successfully using the spell to surpass barriers. Granted, the spell hadn’t worked on breaking the actual barrier as a whole, but it had worked nonetheless.
“Can I just see it already?” Draco felt like he was quite literally going to combust with anticipation.
Draco did indeed remember Lupin. How could he forget? The man was only brought up to him and his family about a thousand times by the Dark Lord and other Death Eaters, always being reminded that they were now related to a werewolf, thanks to Tonks, and that the Malfoy bloodline had been tainted. He also knew Lupin had died during the Battle of Hogwarts, along with Tonks. Their names had been in the newspapers for a while, in the many columns of the fallen hero's of the war.
He was proud of himself, of course, since the potion he had brewed had potentially worked after all, and he guessed he was glad to see that Theo hadn’t died, but Theo wasn’t important right now. Harry was.
“Calm down. Alright?” Potter interrupted. He put his hand on Draco’s elbow again, and somehow Draco instantly felt relieved.
Once he reached the top, he tried the door handle leading to the office, and found that it was open. He sucked in a breath, and pushed the door inward, walking into a spacious and neatly decorated office that was definitely suitable for a headmaster, or headmistress.
Draco shrugged. “I’ve come to terms with the title, but I think it’s going to take a bit to not feel like a complete fraud.”
“If you win, then you can kill Harry. Do whatever you want.” He paused, wanting to look behind his shoulder at Harry and make sure the other boy knew Draco would never let that happen. “But if I win, you let Harry and I go, and-”
Pansy was going to throw the most grand party London had ever seen. The venue was at the Claridge hotel, which was both exquisitely fancy, and the perfect place to get pissed and dance, all at the same time.
Potter’s mouth fell open slightly, and he looked sort of mortified. Maybe he was biphobic. But that wasn’t right, it had sounded like Potter had had no clue what being bisexual even meant.
unless he wanted to go to Azkaban. The Kaspian’s already knew that fact, too. They were using it to their advantage.
He couldn’t get Harry’s words to stop repeating over and over in his head. It was exhausting and painful and had Harry been going to kiss him? Had Draco been a coward once again and backed out of it? Or was it just his imagination?
Weasley and Granger, oddly enough, shared an appearance of content, and what could only be summed up in two words as:
The wind and snow whipped past them, Harry’s hair stark black with white flakes clinging, and Draco’s hair surely looking even more white than usual.
“Well that was unexpected,” Commented Harry, wide-eyed in fear and disbelief. He turned to face Draco, softening into concern. “Are you okay? I swear I didn’t mean for that to happen.”
You just- you just left me. Without a word.” Draco’s breaths came up fast and he was shaking slightly. He knew he shouldn’t be yelling and shouldn’t have punched Potter, even if it was half-hearted, but he was furious and could not calm down. He needed to take it out on the only other person around.
This birthday had turned out to be one of his best, all because of a dorky Gryffindor in glasses. He guessed he had Pansy to thank, since her party did lead to all of this.
When class officially ended, Draco rushed out as fast as he could. Potter had tried to say something to him, but Draco didn’t want to hear it. He knew he couldn’t avoid Potter’s apologies or whatever he felt the need to say to Draco forever, they had DADA. next together, where Potter would inevitably carry out his quest to try to speak to Draco. Luckily, Pansy was in that class, so it would be much harder to get Draco alone to talk to him. Though, Draco supposed Potter didn’t need to speak to him alone, and would probably stalk right up to where Pansy and him sat and say what he wanted to say.
He traced the deep lines of it, and made sure Draco was doing okay every second. Draco thought he was trapped in a dream.
Draco slowed his pace down, not trusting himself to not slip and fall in the mud right in front of the person who had fucking kidnapped Harry and used Draco.
A group of black clad people came through the front door, holding on tightly to Olive and Alec. Olive had tears streaming down her face, while Alec wore a horrified expression, his eyes pleading for help. A Death Eater handed their leader Olive and Alec’s wands.
He’d find another time to explain everything he was hiding, whenever that would be, but for now, he just had to hope and wish that Sunday wouldn’t be as bad as he thought, and that the visions meant nothing. They could possibly find another way to break the sleeping curse.
Automatically, Draco’s hand shot to the gem hanging around his neck, and realized it wasn’t concealed by his robes as he’d thought it had been.
Ten minutes later Draco found himself getting dressed in the warmest clothes he could find, in his dormitory surrounded by his still sleeping roommates.
Madame Pomfrey stepped into the room, coming out of her office, and made her way over to Draco, who was currently playing Exploding Snaps for the fiftieth time that week, with Pansy and his mum.
Wednesday was a repeat of Tuesday, every detail replicated except for the fight that had ensued around twelve thirty in the early hours of Tuesday. Draco’s Mark throbbed a bearable amount, and he had climbed into Harry’s bed without asking permission. Harry didn’t seem to mind.
Once they sat down at their own table near the fire, and had their Butterbeers and Fire Whiskeys out in front of them, Draco felt more than content. He wasn’t exactly socializing, just talking to Pansy and Blaise, and that was perfect for him.
He still made sure he looked presentable every day, but it didn’t take him as long to get ready in the morning this year than it had previous years.
Instead, the Aurors had jumped to the conclusion, after seeing the part where Draco had killed Drys, that Draco was to blame for all that they knew had happened during the two weeks (which wasn’t a lot to begin with) and immediately placed Draco under arrest, even though Draco had still been in a fucking coma.
“Yeah well it’s not always something you can tell by just looking at someone, you know.” Draco rolled his eyes again. “And Theo isn’t gay. He’s bisexual.”
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed and his face scrunched as he listened to Draco explain what he should have told Harry the day it happened. Harry was most certainly not pitying Draco anymore.
currently in Azkaban, rotting away with Lucius. Though, escaping Azkaban had never been a problem before.
“You did not just ask that question. ‘How are they.’ Seriously? You cannot be the same Malfoy that I have known for the past eight years.”
When they arrived at Transfigurations and Potter opened the door to the classroom, all heads from inside the classroom turned towards them as they walked through the door. Potter walked in casually, a little tense around the shoulders, while Draco slowly inched his way in, head bowed but eyes up.
“Look, I know you’re just trying to be nice, and I appreciate it, but I know I’m not welcome here. You may welcome me, but literally no one else does.” He knew he shouldn’t be talking the way he was to her, but he felt the need to stress the fact that
“I didn't mean to do that. I swear. I just pointed my wand at the corner and I guess excess magic shot out of it, doing
He realized as he was about to leave through the front doors, he was still in pyjamas, and his one pair of clothes was without a sleeve. He quickly scanned the room, looking for a change of clothes, and to his absolute amazement, he noticed Pomfrey had left him a new set of robes that weren’t bloodstained or ripped. They were laying on a chair opposite Draco’s bed, and he wondered how he didn’t spot them before.
“No you ponce! I just mean that I shouted multiple times to get her attention and she didn’t move one bit. I thought she was sick. I was just on my way to get McGonagall when I noticed there was literally no one else around. Well, I guess except for you.”
Drys Kaspian or Olive Brightly could have possibly created the spells, keeping the plants alive. It was a likely idea, since their names were scrawled on the door which allowed him and Harry entrance into the Garden.
Draco had to guess that the students all presumed Harry had done all the saving, and Draco all the evil plotting.
The next difference was that Potter hadn’t had to wake Draco up from a nightmare-induced-fit, since Draco had had no such visions when he slept.
“I’m not exactly sure what heroes do. But I know what I want to do. And I’m not changing my decision.”
Potter seemed to notice Wynn’s hateful expression, and even though it looked like it physically pained Potter to speak up for Draco, he sighed and said, “Professor, Malfoy was stuck in a broom closet, he couldn’t get out. I walked by where he was stuck and heard him, and got him out. It’s not his fault he’s late, don’t punish him for something he had no control over.”
He ran over to Pansy’s dozing body, and started shaking her frantically. She had to wake up. But after a while of poking her shoulder and saying her name over and over again, he knew it was hopeless. She was subject to the same kind of curse that everyone else was under.
He was about to jump out of bed and wake Potter up when his eyes moved to where Potter should have been laying.
Even when the curse was broken, Draco figured no one else would come in here; he doubted anyone even knew this room existed. The Garden didn’t look like it had been visited in many years, maybe even a decade or so.
He just… he just wanted to keep his mind blank for a while. It hurt; trying to sort things out. It hurt having to come to new terms with himself.
Harry’s lips felt like fire and ice. Like something he shouldn’t be touching. But the thing was, he was touching them.
“Whoops indeed, Harry.” Draco sighed, and strode across the room to pick up Harry’s wand that had now rolled under Slughorn’s desk. Draco placed the vial of the Restorative Potion he had brought over unconsciously, setting it on the desktop, while bending down to grab Harry’s wand. As his knees hit the floor, he realized he could have just
“Sure you do!” Harry danced his way towards Draco, and grabbed his hand, pulling Draco farther away from where their picnic set up was.
“You said I was resisting, though,” Draco commented, “you were talking about my Mark, and how I’m not controlled by you. How is that possible?”
He had a point. “Look, Potter. I’m doing fine on my own. If you need company, go and drag Weasley’s arse out of bed and slump him over your shoulder or something.”
Potter went on without a response from Draco. “So, I sort of feel, I don’t know, obligated to be friends with him. Like being his friend and hanging around him is going to fill the hole in my heart that was left there by Remus’s death. Alec has so many stories about him that I love to listen to, and I feel like if I just stop being friends with him, I won’t ever get to hear anymore stories, and it will be like I’m disgracing Remus’s memory. I don’t know, my reasoning doesn’t make much sense, and it sounds stupid. Also, before you say anything else, I
Draco didn’t have any retorts to respond to Harry’s statement with. In the background, he could hear a new song playing quietly, and he wondered when Harry had turned down the music.
Slughorn was droning on and on about the potion they were going to be creating today. It was called the Bloodroot Potion, and was apparently very poisonous. Draco didn’t know why they were brewing something so dangerous, let alone brewing it for their NEWTs.
No one knew all the true details save for a small group of people, but he was expecting some type of article soon about the truth, based on what the Aurors had seen in the Pensieve. Everyone knew that Aurors couldn’t keep their bloody mouths shut.
The sad part was, as he told this exactly to Harry, the Wizarding World would probably let it happen, once Drys had ignited the flame.
He then realized that if one owl was awake at the moment, other animals had to be awake. He and Potter had certainly not taken into account all the animals running around Hogwarts. He wondered how well they were holding up without anyone feeding them, and then remembered that Pansy had a cat of her own and he
at him. Ropes automatically began tying themselves around Draco’s body, and he winced in pain and the ropes cut into his skin, even through his clothes. However, he stood strong against the wall of the classroom. He wasn’t going to fall. He could handle this. He had been through far, far worse at the hands of the Dark Lord.
He knew that was how the world viewed him and the Malfoy name in general, but hearing Potter say it; the hero of the Wizarding World, the boy he had grown up with, his sworn enemy,
Draco hadn’t even thought of the possibility of a third outcome: the potion not working at all. Creating nor life or death.
too blatant, not to mention creepy. It was all so strange, the two of them finally being alone after all this time. They’d been confined to each other’s space, attached to the hip for two weeks straight about a month ago.
“Yes, go have a marvelous time with the devil himself and his little sidekick. I’ll probably still be up by the time you get back.”
He was lucky, though, that they were only accessing his memories starting from the point of Drys and him beginning to duel, and ending with Draco completely blacking out. They said they had no need to watch any of his other memories from the two weeks, to which he sighed thankfully at. They’d be missing plenty of information without accessing his memories from the rest of the two weeks, but Draco wasn’t planning on mentioning that.
“Draco? What are you doing?” Harry said as he blinked a couple times, clearly not believing his own eyes.
Draco begged. He was willing to drop on his knees and grovel at Harry’s feet if it would cure their relationship.
The rest of the session was pretty dull. They hadn’t made much progress, which Draco pointed out, to which Elizabeth had pointed out ‘you made progress by showing up, Draco, and talking to me, even if it was just a little bit.’
“You wanted to talk to me, mother?” Draco said as he exited the entrance to the Headmistress’s office. He went to stand next to Narcissa who had been patiently waiting next to the gargoyle.
The stairs that led to the second floor appeared in his line of sight, and he was about to climb them when a harsh ringing filled his head. It wasn’t the type of ringing that came when he thought about his past or when the world became too much to handle, but a ringing that grew louder and louder until his vision became completely black and he couldn’t see anything anymore.
Draco wanted to shout at Harry and tell him oh how incredibly wrong he was. Harry didn’t know about the offer where Draco was supposed to hand over Harry’s
"YOU ARE THE ONE WHO NEEDS TO SUFFER!" Drys shouted, shaking with rage. "You and your father are the ones who've ruined my life. Having Alec complete the job would mean I wouldn't get the chance to see you in complete and utter agony. Even if you weren't aware of it yourself."
Once they arrived at Slughorn’s classroom for the night, and they both took their usual positions- Draco stirring intently and Harry sitting on a table- Draco noticed the atmosphere seemed off. That was, the atmosphere between him and Harry.
There was no way Draco would ever give up, but he really didn’t have a clue where Harry could be. It seemed like the easiest and obvious solution, to give up, but Draco knew what taking the easy path ensued, and it wasn’t something he wanted to take again.
. It felt like he was eleven years old again. Not withholding the weight of a Dark Lord or war on his shoulders.
He was describing the exact same situation Draco had encountered with Madame Pomfrey. Draco felt sick. So something really
He did not want to die this way. He survived the fucking Dark Lord, he could survive a couple of grief stricken teenagers. That was, if he could find his stupid wand in time to save himself…
Drys, hell bent on taking revenge for the death of his wife. Forcing the Death Eaters, who he ever so despised, to do his bidding; forced to understand everything that was going on, and yet powerless to act on their own will.
The only real reason Draco felt like he had to stop Drys at this point was because he had to save Harry from being killed, along with a large number of people. Harry’s friends included, along with Pansy and his own parents. Although, if his father was already taken in by the pull of the Mark, wouldn’t he just die when Drys died too? Would Draco die if Drys died? Even if he was currently, ‘resisting’?
Once it was off, he could feel Harry’s fingers lightly touching him; whereas Draco had lustfully ran his hands across Harry’s chest, Harry did the complete opposite. Eventually, Draco just couldn’t look away anymore, and he found himself staring up at Harry who was admiring every uncovered inch of him. He was touching the Sectumsempra scars littering his torso, eyes glittering with unshed tears.
Draco’s heart stopped. He was sure she was talking about the quill he had gone to pick up before he was attacked. He had dropped it somewhere during the mess with Smith, and had absolutely no clue where it might have gone. His eyesight was still a little blurry, and it was slowly getting better, but he still couldn’t move very much.
While Potter hadn’t been looking, Draco had snatched Snape’s book from its spot laying on the table, and held it tightly in his hand. Since it was about the size of his palm, the book was easy to conceal, plus, Potter was luckily too caught up in his spell casting, so stealing the book right from under Potter’s nose had been easy.
, Draco chewing furiously at his lip. The room was transformed into a spacious bedroom with two beds pushed up against a wall. It was decorated in different shades of green and red, to match his and Potter’s houses. There was a couch in the center of the room with many blankets and pillows folded neatly on it, along with a tray that held a variety of different snacks and drinks. A huge fireplace with a roaring fire was near the couch, and there was a door that presumably led to a bathroom in the far corner. The Room of Requirement had really hit every mark on the list of what they so desperately needed at the moment.
He tucked the chain under his shirt, and boldly took Harry’s hand, guiding him back to their spot in the snow.
get to class. I know you hate Wynn, as do I, for a completely different reason, but if you show up late with me, and explain to him that I had a little complication, I won’t get in trouble. He'll listen to anything you say.”
“You are clearly not fine. Tell me or I’m just going to keep asking, never going to leave it alone until you-”
“Why do you still hang out with him? I notice that you don’t enjoy his company nearly as much as he enjoys yours.”
“Sadly, yeah. Sort of,” Harry said, taking a quick break to shove food into his mouth. “As I’ve mentioned before, this summer was hard for me, and he was a great friend to me over the summer and during this year at Hogwarts. Well--” he snorted-- “he was pretty toxic. As you might’ve seen. Quite a bully; reminded me of someone I used to know…”
The magnificent water fountain splashed little drops onto their faces as they laid on their backs on the stone floor. The sky was charmed to hold the night sky, stars clearly mapping out constellations and shooting stars flying through it all from time to time.
moving. The dull grey color it was last night when he had last looked at it, was no more. It was stark black, once again, and
He wished that he was in possession of Snape’s actual book, so that he could ask for a spell that would allow him to find people.
Harry grabbed at Draco’s hand again, pulling it away from scratching his arm, and instead holding it tightly in his own hands.
Leave.” It was a halfhearted attempt at an excuse, he knew that Harry knew something bigger was going on. As much as Draco believed Harry was undeniably daft, Harry wasn’t so daft as to not see Draco’s fear and restlessness as he ran into the bathroom, an obvious cue something was wrong.
“No,” Draco breathed. He wished it were him lying in the rain, possibly dying from the cold, the rain beating down, and enduring whatever the Figure had done to him. He deserved it more than Harry. Harry had done nothing wrong.
Harry sighed, and then sat down next to Draco, facing the brutal wind and snow. “I had to find you, of course. Though, it was a bit hard to do since I didn’t have my map to track you down.”
It was almost hard to believe that he was now face to face with that very same powerful, dark, wizard who’d created such a beautiful place like the Garden of Mystics.
After a moment, McGonagall let out a sigh. “Mr. Malfoy, as much as you might try to hide it, I can tell you are in pain. If you do not feel comfortable talking with me, which I completely understand, would you be open to the idea of private counseling sessions with Elizabeth? You wouldn’t have to attend the group sessions anymore, of course.”
He’d been avoiding making any sort of eye contact with anyone walking Hogwarts’ halls. He was terrified of the looks they’d give him. Terrified of the
Narcissa chuckled and pulled Draco in for a tight hug. He was glad that the Curse had miraculously brought them closer together. He was glad that they got to spend so much time together in the Hospital Wing, even if a lot of the time was spent by Draco grieving and moping.
“I- I just- I,” Potter gestured to the shelf and to the ground, where there was a pile of ash near his feet.
“I already got what I wanted,” Drys stated, a little too confidently. “Look around, my boy. I’ve accomplished what I’ve wanted to accomplish all along. Now, all I have to do is play a game of dueling, which is honestly going to be quite fun.” His eyes were full of so much hatred and pride. Draco wondered if his own eyes ever resembled anything close to Drys’s. He hoped not.
He wanted to ask him what had changed, and what had prompted him to act closed-off last night, but he decided against saying anything on the subject. He, unlike Potter, was not nosey and did not need to know every aspect of Potter’s life. Even if he really, really wanted to know what had bothered him so much.
Pansy took a huge breath, opening her mouth to speak, when she was interrupted by the sounds of people coming into the room. She finally stepped aside, and Draco had a clear vision of everyone who had just entered.
Hermione sighs next to him, rubbing her hand across her forehead. “Professor, maybe we should give Harry a few days to think about what you’ve said.”
“He would touch me,” says Draco, tears swelling in his eyes. He blinks them away, taking in a short breath. “He told me that it was okay, because I was his nephew. I could trust him because he was my uncle.” Draco clenches the hand that sits idly on the wooden table into a fist.
Harry feels his pulse all throughout his body, especially in his hardening cock — and he grabs at Malfoy, rutting into him, making them both groan from the pressure. It’s too much and not enough all at once.
Harry wants to die; he hates himself for the way he still wishes it was Draco he was waking up next to.
“Yes, Headmistress. I can have everything arranged with my solicitor, all we’ll need is your signature to have it approved by the courts.” Narcissa pushes back her son’s hair. “We’ll be leaving for France as soon as tomorrow morning if everything goes smoothly.” She makes her way over to McGonagall, pulling a piece of parchment from her robes.
Harry pauses. They all turn to look at him. As he approaches, he sees the mirror Draco usually uses to cut up Pixie Dust on the cherrywood coffee table. Harry swallows, eyes looking at Draco who still won’t meet his gaze.
Harry rolls off Malfoy completely, laying his head down onto his pillow, staring at the swirling canopy above his bed. Merlin, he’s had so much to drink. He hadn’t noticed. Most days his mind is hazy, most days he feels like he’s half-drunk already. The burn of grief is the same as Firewhiskey, the mind-numbing buzz stays no matter what he does, making him feel depersonalized, like a zombie walking, talking, haunting the skeletal halls of the school that once felt so much like home.
“The cinema,” Harry says, moving to pull out the defrosted chicken from his back-room pantry, pulling the pre-made sauce of alfredo off the shelf as well. “Have you ever been?”
Draco’s story is told in mumbles and whispers, as he tries desperately to push away a sleep that threatens to overcome him. He tells Harry about the first time he rode the Underground and how terrified he was. How he had gone to a Primark to buy Muggle clothing, and how thrilling it had been. How he had bought a magazine called Vogue, and how fascinating it had been seeing the differences in fashion trends.
Harry tries to take off Draco’s jumper, needing to feel skin on skin. He feels like he might die if he doesn’t. Draco tenses and hesitates, “Please,” Harry pleads, and Draco relents.
“No,” says Draco, voice a rasp – like it’s broken a delicate silence that hadn’t been held between them. “You were lovely,” he whispers, “so lovely, I –” Malfoy picks up his jumper from the floor. “I’m sorry.” His voice trembles and Harry wonders what he’s done wrong.
Please, don't feel embarrassed. It was actually kind of nice to hear you - or, I guess, see you'd written something like that. I liked it. I suppose it's realistic too, wanting to develop a side of you that can be kind where maybe you've always been taught to be mean and cruel. I hope it goes well for you. It sounds like your heart is in the right place, so I'm sure it will.
Hermione looks like she might cry. Harry feels a pang of guilt weigh down his chest, but then something stabs at him, sinks its teeth into his heart, and something simmers inside him. He can barely breath; anger, the old familiar friend, consumes him. “Hermione’s going home to her parents, but I don’t see you mad at her about it?”
Harry’s stomach growls at him as he makes his way down the cobblestone steps that lead to the common room. He wonders what he’ll be able to steal from the kitchens and scratches at the back of his neck.
Together, because that’s what they are, a singular entity connected by their mutual pleasure – they move their hands seeking one another out. Harry finds Draco’s fingers scratching up his back, sliding up his neck, moving to cup his jaw. Harry moves his hand, pulling one of Draco’s hands away, sliding his fingers through Draco’s, touching their palms together, pressing the back of Draco’s hand into the firmness of his mattress.
“Told you we should have done this in my room, c’mon.” Dean grabs Draco’s hand and starts moving them towards the door.
Harry stares at the white blond atop Malfoy’s head for a long time, before his eyes weaken with the nothingness that claims him and sends him into the carnage of his dreams.
It becomes a regular thing after that. They smoke a cigarette every night, right before bed. They don’t really talk much beside Harry asking to bum one and Malfoy offering him his lighter. Ron and Hermione are worried that living with Malfoy won’t be good for him in the long run,
Theo and Draco stumble through the door eventually, holding each other up. Draco’s far more drunk than Theo if Draco’s half-lidded eyes and swaying head is anything to go by.
Harry could barely pay attention then, finding only enough strength to nod along at her words of comfort. They felt empty, her words, but perhaps that had more to do with Harry and less to do with his professor’s intentions.
“What is forgiveness anyway?” Hermione asks, relaxing into Ron’s soothing touch. He moves the flannel against her back in a comforting circular motion as they sit together in the soapy water. “I think you can forgive someone, and it doesn’t absolve them of their responsibility to be a better person.”
Harry’s laughter is deep in his chest, he feels so good. He hits Draco harder, drawing blood this time. It’s just about the funniest thing he’s ever experienced. “Hit me. Come on, come on. Hit me too, yeah?”
me.” Venom is laced through Draco’s words, and his hold on Harry’s wrists tighten, his face turning into a scowl.
Harry thrusts into Draco’s warmth with deep thrusts that have him clenching around Harry, pumping in and out of him with long, rough strokes, hips twitching when his cock buries into the velvet heat of Draco’s arse, balls slapping against the skin of his buttocks — unhurried as he slides out, taking his time to enjoy the way Draco’s hole sucks him back in, begging to be filled.
Then Draco’s casting, and taking Harry’s throbbing cock into his hand, lining it up with his rim and teasing himself. Harry’s hovering above him, breath ragged and uneven, and his hips stutter and he’s thrusting in, and Draco’s mouth is falling open.
“Are you okay?” Harry asks, panic changing the rhythm of his heartbeat from anticipation to adrenaline.
“You don’t know him the way I do,” Harry mutters, taking the meat she’s handed him and throwing it towards the baby Thestral stumbling towards him.
The movie is witty in the ways Harry remembers it being, and he can’t help but be reminded of Draco every time he sees Cher on screen, with her blonde hair and stylish outfits. He wonders briefly if Draco would be insulted or pleased by the comparison.
“You think because you were worse, you don’t have a right to be angry.” Theo says, moving onto the red pepper. “I’ll be angry for you.”
“I’ll kill you, you ugly slag.” Draco pushes at Pansy, and she laughs cruelly at him. Falling back easily, skirt riding up and exposing her lace knickers.
“How dare you!” Molly roars. “Harry, more than anyone, has been going through such a difficult time. How dare you suggest he has malicious intentions!”
“He doesn’t need to know about fashion, Draco,” Parkinson says with a hand to her hip. “I need a man’s opinion.”
“Well, since you’re here,” Parkinson stands, and Harry doesn’t hesitate to reclaim his spot, taking the spliff Malfoy offers him. “You can help me choose tonight’s outfit.”
The monster in Harry’s chest rears its ugly head then and Harry takes a breath, stamping it down. “I wanted to cook for you,” he says, because it’s easier to say that then to explain the tightness in his lungs and the claw-like clasp that clutches at his heart. It’s easier to say that because
“Because,” Theo begins, moving to start cutting up the white mushrooms Pansy loves. “He’s hurt you.”
Draco and Nott laugh again, leaning further into each other, Draco’s hand landing on Nott’s thigh as he shakes with the force of his cackling.
Trust me, I don't have a habit of giving out offers unless I intend to see them through. Feel free to ask about anything, anytime you have questions.
Harry hesitates, looking at Draco beneath his lashes. Draco’s looking at him with such intense heat that Harry feels consumed by it, wants to burn under it completely.
“That’s awful, Harry. You two shouldn’t be fighting.” Hermione is walking towards him, from her place on the couch by the fire. Ron’s still sitting next to the spot she’d occupied, and it seems like she’s still trying to bridge the gap between them.
Harry is very grateful indeed and pulls Draco into a seething kiss, slipping his tongue into the other man’s mouth. They kiss like that for a while, there’s no rush all of a sudden. Now that Draco’s got that little phial in his hand, Harry feels like he’s got all the time in the world.
Draco squeezes around him, legs tight and shaking against Harry’s waist, babbling incoherently, begging Harry to fill him, clenching around his throbbing cock – that’s all it takes for Harry’s pleasure to spill out of him, thrusting into Draco as he rides the waves of pleasure that roll through him, toes curling, body dropping, hips twitching as he enjoy the aftershocks that leave him spent and sated. Harry falls onto Draco, conscious of his weight on the other man, sliding out of the wet heat slowly, turning onto his back, catching his breath.
Once he’s been excused from the Headmistresses office, Harry finds his feet leading him towards Myrtle's bathroom. Harry has an odd worry of history repeating himself, wondering if he’ll come across Draco crying in the loo again. Although, it’s him that feels like crying so maybe it’ll be him that gets found out.
The tears escape Draco in the same fashion raindrops might slide against a window, slowly falling down his face, meeting at his chin, dripping down onto skin.
Harry sits crossed-legged atop the duvet as Draco shrugs under it and in a quiet voice asks, “Did you fuck him?”
Draco rolls into him, Harry cleans the sheets wandlessly, cleans Draco’s chest up the same way, he’s about to get up and grab a flannel for the sticky mess between Draco’s thighs when his fingers wrap around Harry’s wrist.
boy! Unlike your Death Eater son, who he should have left to rot in Azkaban instead of speaking for you and him at your respective trials.” Molly says, standing as well. “Especially considering this is how you’re choosing to repay him.”
Harry takes the little spoon, with the snow-white powder on it. It looks shiny up close, and he puts it to his nose and snorts it down. Pansy and Blaise whoop, and Draco looks so pleased — like a cat that’s just had its ears scratched. Harry thinks he might just become addicted to the feeling he gets when he sees Draco like that. The drip hits the back of Harry’s throat, and his heartbeat is wild in his ears, pumping through him with a rhythm that matches the speakers still pumping music below him.
A few more rounds of Wizard’s Cup later and Harry’s feeling properly buzzed. It takes a lot for him to get drunk and he thinks he’s got a good hold of himself; maybe that’s why he feels like he’s not having any sort of fun.
Harry moves to his fridge and feels the burn of Draco’s eyes on him the whole time. It stirs something in him like it always does, but he ignores it like he never has before. He pulls two cans of coke from his fridge, hands one to Draco, before cracking the other one open.
Dean laughs, pulling on Draco. “Let’s go already, I lived with them for six years. It's always wise to get out of the crossfire.” Draco laughs and follows behind Dean.
Draco stares at Harry, a soft hue of red spreading across white skin, his uneven breathing reflected in the rapid rise and fall of his scarred chest. Draco slides his hand down Harry’s arm, fingers curling around Harry’s wrist, pushing Harry’s finger into his body.
Harry feels Draco’s breath above him, arms beside him encasing him in, and cock inside him. Harry likes that he feels locked in, with his back pressed against the mattress, likes being right here — entrapped in everything that is Draco.
Harry gasps out, “Harder, please.” And Draco goes deeper, quickens his pace, finding a rhythm that has Harry’s senses on overdrive.
The soft murmurs of the cafe create an ambiance of peace, Draco feels as if he’s in his own little world. A word that exists outside of the past, the present, but perhaps it’s a world that can exist in the future.
Malfoy had brought them back to their room, stopping every few steps to laugh at some inconsequential little thing that they’d forget about the minute they stopped looking at it, and had been smart enough to remind Harry to change into some warm clothes, then proceeding to invite him under the duvet.
“No, she is,” Draco says, eyes far away, lost in the world he’s found in the puddle of rain. “I hope one day she’ll change her mind about all that.”
Also, what Muggle cafe are you working at exactly? Maybe I could come by after one of your shifts and take you up on that offer to hear more stories about my mum. I think I’m finally ready to hear them, if the offer still stands.
Harry smiles slowly, leaning forward, offering Draco a gentle kiss, moving to leave another one at his jaw, moving his arm, supporting his weight on his forearm. Harry’s cock rests between them, pressing into Draco’s hipbone – Draco moves his fingers, starts at Harry’s neck, letting his trimmed nails groove their way down Harry’s skin, pausing to let Harry adjust, as he moves his long fingers, wrapping them around the tip of Harry’s cock, dragging down the foreskin, stroking gently.
They get high, and Malfoy gets giggly, and Harry feels like there’s cotton in his head. They laugh at just about anything. It’s kind of nice.
Draco hums. “Well,” he says, squeezing at Harry’s cock. “We can’t have that, now, can we?” Draco brings his lips to Harry’s, kissing him gently, sliding his slick tongue in slowly, making love to Harry with his mouth. “I want you to come inside me,” Draco says, pulling away from Harry’s mouth, soft breath a tickle against Harry’s skin.
The last thing he wants to say might just be the very thing Draco needs to hear. “Maybe we shouldn’t be having sex.”
Harry is sitting with his friends drinking, engaging in a game of Wizard’s Cup — a game where you have to take a dare or take a drink of a spiked Pepper Up potion mixed in with a sample of whatever everyone’s drinking — when he notices Draco and his friends have joined the festivities from the corner of his eye.
It’s Draco’s Dark Mark and it’s faded now, soft and pink and scarred. All up and down that mark are tiny bits of raised skin.
Harry looks at Draco’s pale fingers wrapped around the brown of his wrist, relishing in the cool touch. “I know.”
They fuck every night in Draco’s bed, spend most nights after their romp in this bed, holding onto one another. Harry hasn’t slept in his own bed in months. He hears the door creak and lifts up his head, Draco’s making his way in quietly, shutting the door behind him with a soft click.
“You should see the way you look, all fucked out like that.” Draco groans into his ear. “Fuck, you have no idea how much I –” He cuts off as Harry clenches around him.
Harry inhales sharply, it’s not like he’s never thought about it before, it’s just, well, he was perfectly fine with the way things were, but Draco’s looking at him with glitter grey eyes and so of course he’s going to agree, his cock is already agreeing for him. “Okay, yeah, fuck, yeah.”
“If there are ten men sitting at a table, and one of them is a Death Eater, then there are ten Death Eaters sitting at a table.”
“Aw, look at you, taking care of me like the good old days,” Draco coos. “Before you went and replaced me.”
Harry slams the door behind him once he’s made it to his room, startling Malfoy, who’s sat atop his duvet reading a paperback novel.
“Thank you for trusting me.” Harry reaches out his hand and Draco walks forward to take it, letting himself be led down onto the couch, sitting next to Harry, curling up into him.
“I didn’t think I fucking had to, what do you want me to do? Keep an eye on him for you? Repeat of Sixth Year, maybe. Shall I cut him up in a loo at the end of the school year for you too?”
Once, and only once, does Harry make the mistake of getting drunk before he meets Draco. His day had been awful, the unrelenting press refusing to leave him alone. Ron had been in a right awful mood as well, and for no apparent reason beside the fact that they both needed it, they had started a row that ended in harshly delivered truths.
“Mother used to say that cake made everything better.” Draco tenses, wishes he could see Harry’s reaction to the mention of his mother. “She was wrong,” he continues. “Cake doesn’t fix anything, but Luna –” He pauses, swallowing down the burn of remorse that rises like bile in his throat. “– she always said thank you when I brought her meals, even though she had no reason to be thankful. I wanted to give her something she could say ‘thank you’ to.”
Draco doesn’t answer, instead moving to sit on the couch, pulling his long legs into his chest, resting his chin on his jogger-clad knee.
Harry hates the sound of his laughter almost as much as he hates the sound of Draco’s name spoken freely from his lips.
Smoking weed with Malfoy at ungodly hours of the night becomes the new thing for them, and Harry much prefers the head high he gets from the weed to the soft buzz the cigarettes give him.
“I don’t want you to use me to hurt yourself,” he says, which is a half-truth. He doesn’t mind being used, is familiar with it even, but Harry’s hurt Draco enough in this lifetime, the other man has the scars on his chest to prove it.
Harry started to take a couple steps towards Draco, but Draco backed away. He wasn’t done telling Harry everything he needed to say, yet. Certainly, when the full truth came out, Harry would stop looking at him with caring eyes.
Kaspian seemed to be paired up with a girl who was in Ravenclaw. Draco was surprised he didn’t wait up for Potter to show so he could be partners with him.
“You always had a good relationship with him. I think he’ll tell you more if it’s just you in the room with him.”
“How about I go check on McGonagall, and then I’ll head towards the Great Hall. I'm sure there has to be someone else awake. Maybe they're looking for others too?” Potter said.
wrong. Not that he hadn’t deducted that from everything that had happened that morning, but Potter voicing what happened on his end made Draco sure something was definitely up.
” She sputtered. She was now kneeling beside him and looked positively frightened from what he could tell.
The real reason, as written by a complete wanker at the prophet, was that Harry cheated on Ginny Weasley, and the girl Weasley found out, promptly breaking up with him.
“We created the Garden near the end of the year, working day and night and using spells we had come up with to design a secret room, one that would be filled with light and a mystical atmosphere. On the day that we had finished it, Olive kissed me. We carved our names on the door and set enchantments that would always keep the plants alive and keep the room in an orderly fashion.”
There were many flaws to the plan, Draco knew. If the Restorative Potion somehow killed Theo, and people found his dead body, realizing he was the only person in the school who had gotten killed, they would probably point fingers at Draco. They could also run diagnostic tests on Theo’s body, which Draco was sure would show he had some type of poison in his system. Once again, everything was likely to be traced back to Draco. One reassuring thought, though: he had Harry Potter on his side this time, and he
Draco should’ve taken into consideration where the fuck the two of them were going to sleep. How could he not have remembered that there was the slight problem of sleeping arrangements? Maybe his mind
to each other, it was suffocating. Draco could now fully see Harry up close without his glasses, and he had to admit, Harry was stunning; his face the definition of perfect. His eyes so very green and his black hair that fell down over his forehead, brushing his long thick eyelashes, looked so soft. Hell, he knew his hair was soft from the night he had creepily run his fingers through it.
Draco had some of his own questions, too, that he figured only Harry would be able to help him with. Like the fact that Draco had survived the killing curse. And that he had somehow made his Mark stop hurting,
Draco knew he wouldn’t get out of not speaking to Potter. Well, Draco didn’t have to speak, but he had to listen.
“So for the longest time, I kind of thought it had to be related to the sleeping curse, right? Because it was just too much of a coincidence that the Mark, and the curse, and the protective ward happened around the same day. I hadn’t been sure, obviously, and I’m still not one hundred percent sure, but…” Draco pulled out the crumpled letter in his pocket, slightly feeling the edges of the photograph he and Harry took last night.
He rushed inside, slamming the door against the wall, and froze. Madame Pomfrey was lying down in her bed, not moving at all except for the small rise and fall of her chest. So she overslept. Draco felt like an idiot. He had barged into a ladies room, which was completely inappropriate. Nothing was wrong with Pomfrey, besides the fact that she was clearly extremely tired. He glanced at the muggle clock placed on her nightstand, and it read twelve o’clock.
Harry didn’t say anything for a minute, and Draco thought he’d fallen asleep. “Yeah,” he whispered eventually.
“I guess so. Definitely not fast though.” Draco said as he pulled himself up off the ground, snatching his wand out of the snow and shoving it into his trouser pocket.
“Uh, no? I barely ever pay attention in group therapy, it’s boring and irrelevant to me. Honestly one of the perks of this curse is that I didn’t have to go to therapy for two weeks. Amazing.”
Wynn then seemed to notice Draco, and his smile fell. He was one of the professors that utterly hated Draco’s guts. His other professors were scared of him and tried to avoid him as much as possible, while Wynn seemed to go the extra mile to make Draco’s life miserable. Apparently his wife had died at the hands of a Death Eater during the Battle of Hogwarts, so naturally he had to take his grief out on Draco.
A swarm of owls swooped in through the doors, carrying parasols, newspapers, and letters. A great big grey owl flew right in front of Draco and dropped off a caramel colored letter, with the Malfoy family crest on the front. For a split second he thought it might’ve been another prank letter.
Narcissa Malfoy walked up to where Draco was perched on a seat inside some boutique. She bought a flowery dress that looked incredibly expensive, not that money was a problem, and seemed ready to head back home, from the weariness of her stance.
Draco’s right hand was still held tightly in Harry’s hand, and he had no intention of pulling it free. He used his left hand to prop his head up. “You see, that’s it. I’m trying, all the time, but it’s just too hard. Too hard to keep it all up when deep inside, I really haven’t changed. I’m still the same sucky person who makes the same sucky mistakes.”
“Probably, knowing Drys. But it’s nothing we can’t figure out. We still have a good amount of time before the school year ends.”
signature facial expression, or whatever. Second, Harry looked incredibly handsome when he was smug, and made Draco hyper-aware of his so-called
He had had many nightmares, where this exact scenario happened. He’d always wake up in a cold sweat, and instantly look at his arm to make sure he was dreaming. Every single time it had been a part of his dreams, except this time, and he seriously had no clue what to do. He was too scared to do anything. He had not been prepared for this to happen, and he now wished he would have been.
Draco looked down at the ground. This was exactly the kind of discussion he was trying to avoid talking about. Dark wizards. The Dark Lord. His role in all of it.
The next thing he knew, he saw his mum and dad. His mum was holding him tight inside a room at the Manor. In his gut, he felt the uneasiness of stepping foot inside his house once again, but he also felt happy. It was a real, genuine happiness that he hadn’t felt while hugging his mother, for the longest time.
He knew what he was about to do was entirely impulsive, a trait that most (all) Gryffindors had in them, and he didn’t care. Yes, he wanted to be brave,
He just wanted the damn thing gone. More than ever now. He didn’t want to have to keep looking at it every time it started burning. He had stared into the eyes of the skull more times that past week than he had any other times that school year.
The next day, a slow and boring Tuesday, Draco had Potions with Harry. Which was fine; Draco got to work with Blaise and therefore got to block out Harry, focusing solely on his studies and ensuring the best possible score on his Potions NEWT.
. Even though he had said so otherwise yesterday, he now thought the charm did not seem that hard. Draco had read everything there was to know about it in the defensive spells book he had found it in. He was tempted to try it out himself and show Potter how easy it was, but he was certainly not tempted to risk his probation.
“I guess it’s my turn to tell you my reason for returning.” Harry brushed crumbs off of his trousers. “The world felt off, after the war. I was living with the Weasleys and they were great and all, very loving and sweet, but the atmosphere in the house was wrong. I thought it was because of Fred’s death, and I think that was a part of it, but I knew it was something else. I reckoned I needed a change of scenery, you know? I didn’t get out of the Burrow that much over the summer, and mostly stayed in bed. I knew something was wrong with me, and I figured returning to Hogwarts would fix whatever was wrong with me.”
Draco flipped the book so he could stare at the cover. It did indeed, have no sign of another color other than the dark brown of the leather.
They sat in silence sipping on their own Butterbeers at a small table. Draco made sure his seat was far away from Potter’s, and Potter did the same. After a while, Potter got up and made his way to the back room, trying to find something edible to eat. He came back about five minutes later with his arms full of a basket of assorted fruits. (Why the fuck did a pub have assorted fruits?)
“In the best possible way imaginable. From the moment there was a hint of friendship between us, it felt different and unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before.”
Sorry I'm posting a lot later than usual, writer's block got the best of me this chapter, but nonetheless, I present to you the latest chapter of Finding Sophrosyne :) Hope you enjoy
He had to blink away the rain hitting his face, but on top of that, he had to blink multiple times to really make himself believe he wasn’t trapped in another vision, because standing before him, maybe about half of a kilometer away, was the Hooded Figure.
He remembered why he had wandered over to Harry’s bed, and how he had felt awful for Harry in the middle of the night- seeing him experience a nightmare. Now though, he felt stupid for doing what he had done. Harry had been through lots of nightmares before and didn’t need Draco to comfort him, he was sure of it. Harry probably had an even worse sleep last night with Draco crowding the bed.
to read about and know the truth. There was no more hiding it. He’d be recognized everywhere he went for the rest of his life.
He wished he hadn’t given into Potter’s quips and had stood his ground, now that he made his way to the front entrance of the school. His healing injuries definitely did not appreciate all the walking Draco had done that day, and surely weren’t going to appreciate the long trip to and from Hogsmeade at all. He thought of poor Madame Pomfrey, all alone in her room, who had told him he shouldn’t leave bed for about three days.
“That day, after our therapy session,” Draco said to Alec, “you- you were the one to- to-” Draco took a deep breath- “you were the one who cut my Mark.”
“I-- I think I’ll be right back.” He bolted from his seat, leaving his bag and belongings behind, and headed for the main doors. Once he reached the large stretch of lawn, grass that he and Harry had walked on countless times together, that was far away from the castle, he started to run.
He felt pride swell up inside him at successfully casting the charm, even if it was fairly simple, and felt it contract as he thought of how much of a complete idiot he was.
“You look severely shaken up. What happened? Who do I have to kill?” She sounded like she wasn’t kidding.
He had done the same to Harry, and he cringed at how inexperienced he had been at giving hickeys. Harry definitely hadn’t seemed to mind or notice, though.
He remembered one time, during the first week of the new school year at Hogwarts, Draco had gotten beaten up pretty badly. They hadn’t even used their wands against him. Just beat him up the muggle way.
going to come to Hogwarts, but I felt like today was a lot more productive than yesterday; I feel more prepared. Even if I didn’t figure out how to cast the spell yet.”
I'm sorry if this chapter was boring, but I felt the need to develop Draco's relationships and back story and stuff. More drarry will happen in the next chapter and all the chapters after that! I also wanted to show how normal Hogwarts life was for Draco, compared to how it's going to be in the next couple of days when the plot thickens. I promise it will get more interesting very soon!
“Yeah. And everyone in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade is asleep. As in no one is moving, and haven’t moved since Saturday night. But they’re all breathing so I am pretty certain no one is dead.”
He would bet his life on the fact that the Slytherin tie had not been there when he walked through the corridors Saturday.
“I saw u torture Rowle.” Harry’s voice was small and unsure, but Draco heard him clearly nonetheless, and his stomach twisted at the mention of a moment he would rather forget. “I saw you using the Cruciatus on him, and-”
He thought about her words and decided to head up to the library at some point to research more about it. “I guess it really is the only plausible explanation, though. Do you think that’s how I was able to create those images in my head, you know the one where I saw myself hugging my mum and dad, and standing in front of that mirror…” Of course, he didn’t tell her anything about Harry.
a secret that was, but he didn’t. Potter continued, “What I mean is, everyone expects me to be okay, but I’m not. I don’t know if I ever will be. I haven’t come to terms with what happened with the war. It’s all too much. I look around the school, and I just have, flashbacks, or whatever, to everything that transpired here last May.
Draco shrugged. He didn’t know how to respond to that question. If he said no, she would assume he didn’t enjoy spending time with her. If he said yes, well, he’d be lying to her. “It was okay, I guess,” He said, looking out the window.
“My son is a smart young man,” Drys said, “I've also taught him most of everything I know, so there’s that, too.”
Potter continued, “I’ve had way too many adults in my life throw their problems on children. It’s time they can take some responsibility for something. We figured out one part, and they can figure out the next.”
Radio. Not a radish. Draco ought to remember that. “Cool,” Draco said nonchalantly, but on the inside, he was jumping with glee.
He rubbed her back carefully, hearing her sobs and feeling wet, gross substances on his neck. He felt her whole body shaking.
Potter had been far too insistent in his complaints and Draco was having a pretty terrible day as it was, so he eventually gave in to Potter and told him he would go to Hogsmeade. Potter had seemed supremely surprised that Draco had complied, and said he would wait for him by Hogwarts’ main entrance while Draco got bundled up for the bitter cold.
A group of four Third Years were huddled together at a table and slouched over piles of books. They were all dozing peacefully, shoulders rising up and down. But the positions they were in were
Theo now hated Draco for being a Death Eater. He had openly voiced to him how disgusting and vile Draco was, and how he’d made Slytherin’s reputation even worse than it already was.
“Don’t. Don’t finish that sentence. I’m not in the mood to talk about anything else you feel the need to apologize for. You say sorry
It also amazed Draco that Drys had found a way to break the three question rule; something Snape had meticulously created to stop power hungry wizards from holding a key to all known information, and using it to fulfill whatever plan they had in mind.
But he was sure Harry wouldn’t have left Draco’s side. He was the one who constantly insisted on enforcing the rule that the two of them should never split up.
He heard Harry’s stream of cussing as Draco’s hand- that wasn’t wrapped tightly around the book- hit the doorway, but that wasn’t going to stop him. He kept on running down the corridor, listening to the sounds of his feet hitting the floor echo off the walls. He heard a second sound, Harry running, coming from behind him, which only motivated him to run faster.
Once it was completely off, Harry threw the used bandage somewhere on the opposite side of the room, and peered down at the bare Mark. His fingers were carefully closed around Draco’s left wrist, and from what Draco could tell, he was just taking it in, studying it with his eyes.
Harry gave a small chuckle, which Draco knew meant Harry had already given up on whatever he was looking for. It was a depressing realization. The Boy Who Lived had given up, due to pain caused by a war he had ended. A more depressing realization was: if Harry hadn’t found his ‘something,’ Draco would never be able to find his either.
Draco swallowed. “Okay.” He had every opportunity to apologize right now to Harry, he knew, but he first wanted to hear what Harry had to say.
Draco picked at his food, but eventually ate it. His appetite had improved, but the food tasted dull and lifeless.
Every part of his body ached and burned, and Draco wished he would be taken under by unconsciousness once more. His eyes briefly flicked to the door of the classroom, that was shut. The lights were off in the room too, which would definitely make it seem like there was nobody in it. No one would come to save him this time.
He hitched up his bag onto his shoulder and stared at Harry for a few seconds, trying to figure out what to say. “Well, uh, bye,” he said at last. Embarrassing.
“Didn’t you just hear what I was doing?” He gestured towards the piles of books in front of him. “Looking through books is a very good way to get information.”
As he stood in front of Drys, he felt a cold, metal object being thrust into his grip. He wondered what it was, but couldn’t find it in himself to care.
But he could only truly focus on Harry, who he had hurt in countless ways, but was looking at him now with joy. It was obvious Harry was happy about being the one to not receive all the attention for once in his life, but it was also clear he was genuinely happy for Draco. Next to Pansy and Blaise, Harry was one of the only people to know his darkest fears, his greatest desires, and his wildest dreams.
Despite this being Elizabeth’s first time hearing all this, she only quirked one eyebrow as an indication that she was shocked.
He hoped McGonagall wouldn’t contact his probation Auror to tell him that Draco had vandalized the school. He was counting on the fact that since he had brewed a potion that saved everyone, the vandalization would be overlooked.
“Er- Madame Pomfrey?” He cringed as he spoke. He reminded himself of when he had been five years old, and would slip into his parents room, waking them up from a deep sleep because he was afraid of monsters under his bed.
Harry pointed his wand at the wall Draco had run into, and a large portion of stone broke apart from the wall. At first, Draco was sure the block of stone would’ve fallen to the ground, like anything would have done, but the stone piece flew back
He’d compared Harry to the universe; to the stars and to all the planets, but Harry was much greater than that. He was the person who completed Draco. He was brighter than any star in the universe.
As if sensing Draco’s gaze, Harry turned his head, and Draco copied Harry’s previous position, staring at the ceiling instead.
After a minute or two of lying in bed and staring at the ceiling, he finally decided to turn his head and endure the inevitable.
person about what occurred after therapy. He really just wanted to be left alone with his thoughts for at least a little bit.
Every morning he made sure his cuff links were in place, and that his sleeve would never roll up unexpectedly. Although he was still always paranoid it would. He couldn’t even imagine someone accidentally seeing the Mark. He would probably just
“I’m doing fine,” He said. He wanted to add, “Thank you for saving my life,” but he couldn’t seem to move his mouth to get the sentence out. It was also nice to know Granger had come to check up on him, he wanted to thank her for taking time out of her night to see him, but once again, he couldn’t seem to form the words.
” Potter pointed his wand at the ward, glancing down at the book held in his hand, and made the wand movement pictured.
He wondered, not for the first time, if this had all been strategically planned by the cloaked man. The answer to that question: probably.
He also mentally cursed Potter. In Draco’s mind’s eye, he was throwing Potter into a pit of venomous snakes, and Draco was standing at the top of the pit, happily watching Potter getting eaten alive.
In Draco’s mind, he had categorized all those moments, those experiences he’d shared with Harry as the best moments of his life. Were they the best moments of his life, because he’d felt complete for the first times of his life? Complete, and whole, with Harry Potter.
That was probably the case. His attacker’s probably just wanted him to fail his exam. They didn’t even know that missing or arriving late to a class would result in his deportation to Azkaban. But, that would be an added bonus for them.
The bandage only had a smudge of blood on it, near the skull of the Mark, but other than that it was clean. On harder days, Draco wrapped his forearm up just for the sake of feeling secure. And as Harry started to unwrap it, Draco’s security fell, leaving him vulnerable in so many ways.
“Fuck. I’m sorry. I didn’t sleep well last night.” Potter rubbed his palms across his face, lifting up his glasses in the process.
Draco laughed at the memory now. He did deserve to be attacked. Maybe McGonagall disagreed for some reason, but the amount of people who assaulted him clearly showed he was hated and that he deserved every inch of hate.
“So you’re telling me-” Draco shook with rage- “That this book we’ve relied on for days and days and
It was humiliating. Draco had made sure he would never cry ever again once Harry had seen him weeping in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. But here he was, almost two years later, crying in front of Harry Potter once again.
I sincerely hope you all enjoyed the ending, it was so much fun writing it and I couldn't wait to share it, please leave a kudos/comment if you'd like!!!
He felt a warm hand wrap around his left wrist, and before he could comprehend what was going on, he heard Harry’s voice, soft and comforting. “Don’t do that, you’ll hurt yourself.” And then Harry was pulling Draco’s fingers away from further injuring himself or upsetting the Mark.
The letter shimmered for a second, and then went back to its normal self. He repeated the steps over again except with the owl this time, who did not look pleased to have a spell cast on him, and gestured for the owl to take the letter sitting on the ledge.
The noises of the room were all joining together, and Draco considered leaping out of bed in just his hospital robes and running out of Hogwarts.
“Yeah but it was a good idea. It’s good to be prepared for a fight. Not that I think some scary figure
His fellow students barely acknowledged him as he wove his way through the crowd of standing and sitting bodies. The ones who did, unsurprisingly, stepped far out of his way. He didn’t even try to hide his eye roll.
Harry was unconscious, which definitely wasn’t a good sign, but Draco quickly pulled out his wand, his free hand keeping pressure on the cut in his wrist where blood was gushing out the most.
In all honesty, every moment with Harry was extraordinary. All because Harry was simply Harry. The most extraordinary person. The person who Draco loved. The person who Draco had loved for so many years, throughout the worst times of his life, even if he had only realized it a couple days ago.
“But after I came out of my own vision, everything in the real world felt clearer. My… my Mark, it didn’t burn anymore, and whatever spell Drys had been casting on me to Pull me in, probably a variation of the Imperius, it didn’t work. And after he realized whatever he was casting wasn’t doing shit to me, he cast the Killing Curse on you.”
While he started wiping his cheeks, cleaning off all the embarrassing tear tracks, his mind became clean too. Less foggy with sorrow and more clear with… anger and pain. Whatever moment he and Harry had just had was gone, and Draco was left to deal with the humiliating aftermath.
Harry leaned on Draco, his head resting on Draco’s shoulder, and Draco’s head resting on top of Harry’s head.
“You know what, Draco? I’ll let you choose,” Drys said, “you can be under my control, but fully aware of everything going on around you, and have no power to stop any of it; having to stand there and watch Harry die while you
“No.” Potter said it so firmly and so surely that Draco let out a huge breath, even though he was still quite skeptical. “Back to the whole ‘Dark Lord’ thing-”
“But I don’t know if they’re somehow suppressed, or whatever, since I’m now having these visions when I sleep. I haven’t had a nightmare in a while to be honest.”
“Hurry, follow me.” Potter started running towards the back of Hogsmeade, to the part where the village met the land where no Hogwarts student was allowed to go. Potter had pulled out his wand, and the tip was casting a bright light, illuminating Potter’s outline as he ran farther and farther away from where Draco was still standing.
Draco was now forty, and he wasn’t married, didn’t have any kids, hadn’t done anything useful or exciting in his life. He worked at a library. That pretty much summed up how interesting his life got.
“Fine.” Harry stood next to Draco, also looking out at the beautiful garden. “But, we should definitely come back here again. This can be like our little hang out spot; a reward after a long day of practicing defensive spells.”
Draco rushed out in front of Harry again, soaking his nice clothes to the brim- not that they hadn’t already been ruined from the night before.
Trying to block out all of Drys’s words swarming around inside his head, he continued to feel around on the ground for his wand, and to his amazement, he finally felt the familiar wood, and immediately put back up his shield, just before Drys hit him with a curse. He stood up, casting a quick glance over to Harry to make sure he was still okay, before returning his attention to Drys, who was still explaining everything.
Draco felt sick. He wanted to tell Harry that he had done nothing wrong at all. That it was Draco’s own fault for distancing himself and avoiding Harry. He didn’t want Harry to feel guilty at all; he didn’t deserve that weight.
Also, since he hadn’t had any visions, and he thought he wouldn’t be getting anymore, he thought he wouldn’t have to worry about using Occlumency to keep out intruders. He’d been wrong about that, obviously, and for a split second he thought he’d go back to using Occlumency at night, but he knew he had to let the figure into his head at least one more time, or until he found out what the figure’s offer was.
“Stay right here, I’ll go grab the correct vial.” Draco gave Harry an exasperated look that he hoped told him,
It was funny how days ago, those words had held value. Harry had cared for him. Harry had trusted him. Harry had wanted to have Draco in his life.
Harry laughed and pocketed the photo. “Muggle photos don’t move. The spell I cast basically replicated whatever Muggles do to get a still picture.”
Draco thought. He knew he had to say it, say it before another crisis happened, before anything happened to either of them. “I got to know you, and even though I’ve only just started to know you… I’ve been in love with you, long before I even knew it myself.”
He told Harry that he had thought about sending a letter for help right after he sent his first letter, but then Harry distracted him and he couldn’t get time alone that day to send a new letter. And then that night, he had his last vision, the Figure telling Draco that he was to get Harry’s blood, in return for the Figure not killing his loved ones, and if he didn’t comply by the end of the two weeks, his loved ones would be killed, and everyone subject to the sleeping curse would stay asleep forever. He also explained the threat that if Draco sent another letter, the figure had said something horrible would happen.
“Don’t worry, nothing bad will happen to me while I’m gone, it will take a minute, promise,” Harry said, already starting his run back towards Slughorn’s room.
“Thank you. I just- I need time. But really, thank you for offering to listen to me,” Draco said, his voice almost a whisper.
Potter was definitely right. As Draco looked down at the page, he noticed how easy the charm was to cast. The movement was two circles overlapping each other. A First Year could probably cast the spell.
Potter shoved his hands in his pockets and made a noise Draco could only associate with deep thinking. “Do you think he was trying to say we have thirteen days to save everyone from the sleeping curse?”
Although, he supposed there had been articles on all the Death Eater deaths, along with the imprisonment of Alec Kaspian. It must be common knowledge that Draco was now the only living Death Eater; that, of all other things, might inspire questions amongst people. Alec was also a close friend of Harry, which was suspicious, too.
The first object that was set down was Draco’s wand, which he snatched right away, twisting the familiar wood in his fingers. He’d already lost one wand, so he was glad that his newest one hadn’t become lost or broken.
Harry laughs, head leaning back, tongue stuck out through his teeth a bit. “Let’s get something from the kitchens.” It sounds like a brilliant idea, and it seems that Malfoy thinks so too because he’s jumping off the cobblestone sill and wrapping a silk robe around his lithe form.
“Come on, admit it,” Draco says, brushing a loose ringlet back from where it's fallen in front of Harry’s face, letting Harry into his space as they move close to each other. “You think I’m pretty.”
That’s his name, you know? Or one of them. Voldemort. The other being, Tom Riddle. I mean honestly take your pick, Malfoy. But still calling him the Dark Lord? Like he’s some esteemed member of your little Pureblood society, bleh.
He decides on something simple: steak and rice. Steak that Kreacher always keeps chilled and fresh in the stasis charmed back-room of his kitchen, rice that comes in a little plastic bag, pre- washed and ready to cook. Everything is easy to make, all he needs to do is cut up some onions and cilantro, squeeze some fresh lemon, and the food is ready for him and Draco by the time Draco’s finished showering.
Ron stares back at him, blue eyes swimming with hurt as his features deflate. They stare at each other, long and hard. Harry feels a warm lump in his throat he can’t swallow down; suddenly, he feels itchy all over.
Harry complies, sitting up to pull his pants down and away. Now it’s just skin on skin and it feels fantastic. There’s sweat starting to form on the both of them and they’re kissing into one another and rutting against each other, and Harry wants so badly to feel what it’s like to be inside Draco, wants to feel Draco clench around him as he comes.
“What do you want, baby?” Harry leans into Draco’s space, turning his body towards his man. “Name it and it's yours.”
“When I was a boy,” he begins, working his throat, eyes turned towards the wooden ceiling of Grimmauld Place. “About three.” He takes a deep breath. “I was…” He nods his head, swallowing again. “My uncle, would –”
Anyways, thanks for sending back the VHS. I really appreciate it actually, this one was my Godfather's copy - and it does indeed have a lot of sentimental value. He passed away, I'm sure you know the story - my Godfather was Sirius Black, cousin to your mother. Anyway, since you liked it so much, I bought you a copy that you could keep for yourself.
I didn't mean anything by my lying comment, by the way. I think you might have thought I did, but I swear I didn't. I know it must be hard having to keep such a big part of yourself hidden, we both can relate to that I guess. I'm happy to know that at least you don't have to keep this part hidden too.
Malfoy leans forward, claps his hands, and takes in a few shaky breaths as he tries to quell his laughter and respond. “Who told him to die for my sins?”
Suddenly, Harry’s mind is made up, “Me either,” he decides with a shrug, accepting the spliff in Malfoy’s hand and bringing it to his lips. Out of the corner of his eye Harry notices Malfoy’s steel gaze beneath the white-blond of his lashes.
Harry tilts his head, and Draco grimaces, sitting up and pushing him away, away, always fucking away.
“You know what they’re like,” Neville had explained. “Judgemental.” He brushed a hand through his hair. “Fuck, of all people, why do I have to like him? His friends bullied me, y’know, but he – and I –”
“Ha ha.” Although Draco cannot see the other man, he can hear the smile in Harry’s voice, can practically imagine him rolling his eyes. “Seriously, though.”
Harry’s eyes are still on him when he accepts the spliff from Malfoy’s long fingers, taking a drag as Malfoy’s light eyes watch him, glowing under the moonlight’s white glimmer that seeps in through their window.
Malfoy lifts up his shoulder. “Court mandated,” his tone is casual, like it’s the simplest thing in the world — him being a war criminal, that is.
2. Always communicate what to expect in an argument (if you need to walk away, if you need to know the person is coming back).
Harry’s a breadth away now, when he got so close Draco had no clue. All he knows is that he is shaking with the desire to touch, to taste, for something he has longed for half his life, in one form or the other.
Myrtle’s not in her bathroom as far as Harry can tell but Pansy and Draco are, sitting on the tiled windowsill, snorting Pixie Dust again.
Draco brings his hand into Harry’s curls, scratching at his scalp the way Harry’s likes, the way that makes Harry feel safe. “You don’t know me.”
“Exercise bikes,” Harry tells him. “I took Ron to the gym once,” Harry begins through a yawn, “He went so fast he fell forward – off it.”
Draco’s hand reaches for Nott’s arm, wild grin painted on his face, and then they’re both squealing and whispering into each other’s ears. Harry hates them both so much right now.
I’m glad you like my tattoos, haha. I love them too. It does hurt to get them, but it’s not unbearable. It’s like an annoying buzz under your skin, but it also depends on how sensitive your skin is too. I’m sure the more sensitive it is, the more it’ll hurt. If you really want it though, it’ll be worth it. What are you thinking of getting?
Everything always feels so wrong, every day is an empty monotony. He just wants to forget, to relax, for his brain to shut the fuck up for a few hours — besides, it helps him sleep.
It had all been a matter of circumstance, really. His birthday was coming up, he was working with Draco on a case, and he had mentioned his plans in passing.
“I’m not getting out of bed.” Malfoy wraps the duvet around himself. He’s got obvious circles under his eyes, looking rather disheveled after last night's endless rounds of shots. “Come here.”
Harry changes into a pair of grey joggers, throwing on Draco’s black long sleeve. He sniffs, scratching at his morning stubble and goes to use the loo.
Harry rubs oil onto his throbbing shaft and lines the head of his cock against Draco’s plump rim. He’s just started to put his prick inside of Draco when he needs to stop and control his ragged breath. He doesn’t want to come too soon but Draco is clenching around him, and his head feels like it’s spinning.
“I wish you’d talk to me about important things,” Harry says, eyes fixed to the digital clock on his nightstand. If he’s done the math right, he has two, maybe three more minutes of Draco in his arms before he pulls away again.
Harry blinks, mind spinning with a thousand different questions, a thousand different terrifying scenarios, each one more horrifying than the last, some of them flicker back to Draco on the dingy washroom floor, bleeding out — all of them centring around Harry seeing him cry. He stands then, making sure to step lightly, steeling himself against the handle to his own bathroom, turning it slowly, heart pounding in his chest, echoing pulse against his ears.
They drank, and because they were adults, because Hermione wasn’t there to be a voice of reason, because the world had sharpened their hurt into pointed edges that brushed against them often, they barely ate and drank on.
“Touch yourself,” Harry tells him, as he grabs tightly onto Draco’s hips. He hopes Draco will have his hands printed onto his skin tomorrow, will have Harry’s mark all over him.
They watch The Parent Trap and Draco cuddles into Harry’s heat, kissing at his jaw, telling him, “Thank you,” and acting far sweeter than Harry has ever seen him. This time, there is no countdown, Draco remains soft until he turns to leave, and when Harry tells him he can stay, if he wants, Draco says, “Maybe next time.”
Malfoy brings the spliff between his fingers up to his mouth, inhales. “That just might be the most intelligent thing I’ve ever heard you say, Potter,” he says before exhaling. Harry’s eyes watch Malfoy’s lips form the words — feels something warm in his chest at the sound of them.
It all seems to be going fine, because no one is actually talking to each other and instead are choosing to mind their business for bloody once in their life.
“Alright, pay up – told you those two were shagging,” grunts Seamus once the two women are out of earshot. There are a few grumbles around the table as people pull out galleons from their pockets.
I still miss Sirius, but it gets better - it still hurts to remember the good times, but not so much that I can’t look back on our memories together fondly. Actually, when I lost him, right before 6th year, it really fucked me up, Draco. I stalked you that whole year, you know? I was convinced you were a Death Eater, and I needed some sort of control on my life after losing the only family I felt I had left. It was really hard and it made me do crazy, stupid shit. I am really sorry about Sectumsempra. That shit was so fucked up. The whole war was.
Soundlessly, he moved Harry’s limbs to the side and picked up his wand off the floor, seeing that the time was only 6:48 am. He sighed, and then climbed back in bed, doing his best not to wake Harry as he stole back a blanket.
“Oh! Yeah! Yeah. Ready,” Harry said, pocketing his wand and grabbing his bag. “But before we head to the Garden, I wanted to make a quick stop to the Room of Requirement. If that's okay with you.”
said it out loud until it was too late. The room was strangely quiet, so you could hear pretty much anything.
Potter glared at Draco. “Not helping. But, how long could this thing last? Like we don’t know that if we just wait it out, it will be okay, and everything will go back to normal. Because what if we do wait it out and that's the wrong move, and it ends up with people seriously injured or dying? Ugh, I just don’t know what to do.”
Draco debated what he should do. It was noon, and Pomfrey should have been up by now, but was it his job to wake her? Or should he just let her sleep? He knew he would have wanted to be left alone if he was in her position. But a part of him told him he should wake her. His mind was almost
“Okay, then,” Draco swallowed. He mustered up all the courage he could find in himself, and stepped onto the spiral staircase.
Drys went on: “So after I was set free, I knew that I would have a chance to use my gift for the greater good of the people in the Wizarding World, and even the Muggle world. I set out looking for all kinds of books- anything that would help me accomplish my end goal.”
Draco desperately needed to talk to Harry. Harry made situations better. Harry helped him forget. Harry kept him calm and brought light into his life.
Draco shifted so that he wasn’t lying flat on his back while he craned his head awkwardly to meet Harry’s. He laid on his side and let his palm find the back of Harry’s neck, and held him there like he was delicate glass, letting his fingers touch the soft hairs curling there.
Eventually, Robins rushed over to Theo and helped his friend into a sitting position, while the rest of them were still trying to process everything.
Harry was eyeing the piece of parchment like it was the Dark Mark itself. Draco honestly thought it was the next best thing, considering it held vital information on the Mark, information Draco hadn’t shared when he’d gotten the letter. He took out the other letter too, the one he had originally written, and handed both to Harry, telling him to read the less crumpled and ruined one first.
When he had made his way into the castle himself, he respected Harry’s wish to be left alone, albeit reluctantly. He knew that if the situation were reversed, he’d want to be alone with his thoughts too, and not surrounded by the presence of the person who had lied to him.
The next week after he had officially woken up and healed had been an optional stay, but a much needed one at that. Madame Pomfrey was more than happy to have him stay a week or so longer, but she was also quite concerned. Pansy and his mother were, too.
He remembered that day fairly well. He’d been angry that Harry of all people had rescued him; had been the one to see him in such a humiliating situation. Then, Harry had covered for him when they had arrived late to Transfigurations, telling the teacher outwardly that Draco had been trapped in a fucking closet. That had only made Draco more angry, because why the fuck did Harry have to go and tell the whole class about his unfortunate predicament?
The stone chunk flew in between the both of them, continuing its murderous flight across the corridor, until it finally hit a wall and broke into pieces.
“We don’t know that for sure. They could all very much be up and awake and have no fucking clue as to what’s going on here. I don’t want to take any chances. If someone put up that ward around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade that doesn’t let anything through, they’re probably trying to keep us from contacting anyone. We discussed this, remember?”
had turned into real affection towards Harry. He thought of Harry yelling at him on the other side of the bathroom door, and how he’d found Harry
Harry took a deep breath. “I have this map. It shows all of Hogwarts, along with all its occupants and where they are every second of the day.”
McGonagall’s hard exterior softened. “You’re welcome, Draco.” She pulled out her wand from inside her robes sleeve. “You have grown a considerable amount since first year. I am very proud of you, young man.”
Eventually Draco lifted his head off of Harry’s shoulders and looked him straight in the eye. “Why are you doing this?” He asked hoarsely.
“Draco,” Harry said. Draco knew what he would say next. It was the very thing he had hoped to hide from Harry, possibly for forever. “It was
“Possible? Pfft. I have no idea. I was going to ask you that. One out of the millions of questions I have.”
. He had never even thought of that. Sure, he didn’t use slurs or insult people of Muggle heritage anymore, but that didn’t show people he didn’t believe in the Pureblood supremacy crap anymore. He could have very much still agreed with everything the Dark Lord stood for, since he never voiced anything otherwise to the public. The thought made him sick.
He thought he heard Harry’s voice, sounding pained and concerned, but he knew he was just imagining it. A small part of him told him to go back over to Harry, but why would he do that? Why would he fight the calm, warming sensation that left his mind cleared of all worries?
It was weird the first couple of days. Blaise had just decided he was allowed to sit with Draco and Pansy whenever and wherever. Draco felt like he was intruding on his and Pansy’s privacy. But, he quickly realized that Blaise was genuinely a nice guy. He said he had wanted to befriend Draco a lot earlier, but that Theo hadn’t let him. Draco should have been angry at that, but he understood all too familiarly; being pressured by others.
Draco looked up at Harry in that moment, disregarding whatever Pansy was saying. Harry was talking to Granger and Thomas. His mouth was curved up and his eyebrows were raised as he babbled on about who knows what. Draco was the only person to recognize that this appearance was an act; a fraud. Harry had that same not-quite-here look as he did before the Curse. He was talking to his friends, enjoying his meal so it seemed, and yet Harry was in another universe, far from the one Draco and everyone else was sitting in.
A bright burst of magic lit up Snape’s book, and they finally broke their eye contact. The book was slightly shaking and words were being inscribed across the blank page that was laid open; it was like an invisible hand was writing the words. The words were written in neat cursive, almost similar to Snape's print, and the color was bright gold. A neat contrast to the faded tan pages.
“I would like to know that myself. But what I do know, is that even though we’re in this horrible situation, we’re having a streak of luck, and you can’t deny it.”
And Draco? Draco was gripping the sheets on the bed and willing himself not to start sobbing. He was trying to repress his memories spent in Azkaban, but it was hardly working.
All in all, Draco preferred the second scenario to the first. He liked the idea of not feeling anything as he spent his last day in the world.
would find out about them sooner rather than later, too. They both didn’t mind, but they also knew it would result in Draco’s social status decreasing dramatically, along with Harry’s. Anyone with eyes could see how their relationship had changed; first starting out with avoidance since the Curse ended, and then about a month later changing to the two of them hanging out whenever possible. The
“When did you meet Alec?” Draco was genuinely curious. He also didn’t want to stray to the topic of the war at the moment, he was sure his role would somehow be brought up.
Madame Pomfrey’s expression turned from stern to troubled as she noticed how upset Draco had become from her question, and she conjured a glass of water with her wand. He kindly accepted it from her and took a sip, then carefully set it down on the small side table next to the bed.
Potter, sitting on the other side of the room from where Draco sat at the Slytherin table, looking lost in thought. His messy black hair falling into his eyes. Completely not listening to what Weasley and Granger were saying to him at the moment.
He felt the bed dip even more next to him, and turned his head to see that Harry was lying on his back, too. He was looking at the ceiling, almost as if it were the starry night sky.
McGonagall eyed Draco, her lips in a firm, contemplative line. Her hands were intertwined together, laying on a blank space of desk in front of her. “I see,” was all she said.
He was now almost positive the universe could read his mind. This book was exactly what he needed at the moment to cure his boredom and refocus his mind.
But when Draco realized who the person was, he suddenly wished he was still the only person around. Harry Potter halted at the bottom of the steps, looking perplexed. He stared at Draco like he couldn't believe his own eyes.
Then there was Harry. And oh Salazar did he not want to think of Harry through it all. He knew that sometime soon, he needed to talk to him, though. It was the right thing to do, and it was something he needed to do to put his mind and body at peace for good.
“It’s not like we have to hold hands or anything-” Draco scoffed at the idea- “But, we can just walk in together, side by side.”
This time, Draco does not cry before, during, or after sex. He comes with the remembered grace of a man who rarely allows his body the pleasure of unwinding, back arched against the white sheets of Harry’s bed – face blissed out, as if being with Harry brings forth the experience long since thwarted by choice and expectation. Harry’s heart feels heavy with the knot that tightens against him, as he sees the sweet face of bliss dissipate into a haunted frown across Draco’s posh face.
A blond eyebrow quirks up on Malfoy’s pale face, but he smirks and silently offers him one, even holding out a lighter for Harry to use. Harry takes the cigarette into his mouth, uses the lighter, and sits down on the floor by Malfoy’s feet.
Draco blinks at him and Harry lifts his shoulder, rummaging through his bookshelf and grabbing hold of the VHS.
Harry doesn’t know what the fuck that means, but he’s tired and really doesn’t care enough to start a row about it. Instead, he smokes his cigarette, watches Malfoy from the corner of his eye, and lets the nicotine soothe his senses.
Harry talks about his father then, about Snape, about his mother and his mother and Snape, and his father and Snape and he thinks he’s making very little sense, but then Draco says, “It’s hard living up to legacies our fathers left us, isn’t it?”
than want, and he’s glad he never built it up in his head, because there’s nothing to compare it to. Now, there’s just Draco and his body against his and their mouths exploring each other. Draco’s a good kisser, he’s soft and teasing, and his tongue is wet and warm, and Harry is so fucking turned on he feels like he’s going to come in his pants like a bloody teenager.
“Yes,” says Draco. “I realised after I spoke with her that I might have been unfair towards the people I was reaching out to.” Draco takes a breath. “That my guilt was weighing me down, and still I was making other people responsible for it.”
“Don’t flatter yourself, Potter,” Draco says, pushing himself up to his feet, hand trembling as he pours the rest of his water out in the bathroom sink. “It’s like this with everyone.” His back is a rigid line, his hold on the granite bathroom counter, tight. “I thought –” he cuts himself off.
I love Queen, actually. They're one of my all time favourite bands! This neighbour of yours has good taste. I'm glad to see that you've made a new friend too! Hopefully he can show you a thing or two about the Muggle word, since I assume he is one?
“Yes,” Draco whispers, soft smile spreading slowly. His hands are scratching at Harry’s scalp, the way Harry likes, the way that sends faint shivers of pleasure down his neck and spine. “I like that you’re gentle with me.”
Narcissa stands. “Please explain to me what other intentions he could possibly have, seeing as he was there when they read my son the rules of his probation.”
I lived amongst Muggles for some time, in case you didn't know. If you have any questions about Muggle culture or technology feel free to let me know,
“Have you forgiven him,” Harry rasps out, feeling unreasonably jealous with the knowledge that Dean and Draco talk about the war — it’s not like Harry enjoys talking about it anyway.
Harry sits on the windowsill, knees pulled up to his chest as he lays his back against the cobblestone and smokes a cigarette. He’s waiting for Draco to come into their room, and he hates that he’s waiting for him at all. He wants Draco with him, here, now, but Draco’s fucked off to some club event that Pansy’s dragged him and his friends to. The only reason he knows is because Neville mentioned that he’d been invited to hang out with the Slytherins, per Theo’s request.
“I think,” Draco says. He does not finish his sentence, instead he stares into the darkness of Harry’s bedroom with jarring scrutiny.
A small smile graces Malfoy’s pink lips, Harry notices from the corner of his eye, and the blond says, “I won’t pretend.”
The worry seeps out of him when he opens the door and sees them, sitting on Draco’s bed, cross-legged over the duvet with wide dopey smiles splayed on their faces that only falter when they see him at the door.
Draco’s hold loosens, and he moves his hand to the middle of Harry’s chest, bracing himself against it. His head is tilted down, and he hides his face behind his almost shoulder length hair.
Ginny says she appreciates your apology. She slept over last night and saw your letter. I was worried she’d be weird about it but then she told me she’s been speaking to Blaise Zabini of all people! Apparently his mother co-owns the Holyhead Harpies now? Who knew! They’re recruiting reserve players and Ginny’s up for a spot, she’s been kicking some serious arse this season at Hogwarts.
Harry slides his fingers, curling them, starting a slow rhythm, beckoning Draco towards his own pleasure – towards a pleasure that’s theirs to share. Draco’s hand is still wrapped around Harry’s wrist, and he squeezes gently with every drag of Harry’s fingers.
The first time Harry learns what Draco tastes like, it’s his birthday. He and Draco had stricken up an odd work relationship of sorts – because Harry often worked with potion cases, seeking out Draco’s input any time a new file would find its way onto his desk. Everyone knew that Draco was the best potioneer in London, and that he was a busy man who rarely made time for those he wasn’t familiar with. Thankfully, he was very familiar with Harry.
“She wanted to know about the cakes –” Draco takes a hand and rubs it down his face, takes the pendant necklace his mother gave him and fiddles with it. “– I would go down and I would give her different flavoured cakes and she wanted to know why I gave them to her. So, I told her.”
Harry feels a mess of things so tightly coiled in his chest, behind his heart; he can’t easily pick at one emotion and make peace with it. He wants to reach out to Malfoy and wonders why the three-pace distance between their beds feels like a cliff-dive away.
Harry puts his hand down, nods his head. Where there was once the stark sting of rejection there is instead the relief that Draco trusts him enough with this, feels safe enough to say no. What a powerful thing: touch, Harry thinks, what a powerful word, no.
“Really?” Draco tilts his head, blond eyebrow arched, lip curled upward. “Show me, then,” he says, taking two fingers and trailing them down Harry’s body, curling into the front of his denims. “Show me how much you want me.”
The blond preens at the praise, smiling and hiding his face. Harry puts a hand under Draco’s jaw, forcing him to look at Harry’s lust-filled gaze. Harry and he share a few light, open mouthed kisses before Harry leans his forehead against Draco’s and gives a tentative thrust of his hips.
“Will you tell me what’s wrong?” He asks, placing the glass of water into Draco’s hands, turning to pull a pair of joggers from his over the bathroom door handle, putting them on, sitting next to Draco’s shaking body, never letting his eyes leave his shivering form. “Please.”
I can’t believe your father’s gone and cut you off! Over what? Because you decided to grow a backbone? Although, I think your outlook on it is admirable. I agree, it is a blessing in disguise. You’ll learn the value of taking care of yourself, and hopefully it’ll help you keep growing the way you are.
“Not at all,” Draco breathed. “It’s just strange. I’ve wanted this my entire life. And I’ve wanted people to see that I’ve changed since the end of the war; I got that chance now, and I’m beyond happy that now people will give me a second chance… but…”
Apparently, Harry had visited Draco every night while he was still in a some-what-coma, until one night, the first time the Aurors had visited Hogwarts, they’d flat out barged in to the Hospital Wing, demanding to know exactly what happened. Harry had offered his memories, but they weren’t clear enough, and the Aurors became even more furious. Of course, everyone at that point already knew that Draco and Harry had been the only ones awake during the sleeping curse.
Harry looked convinced, and Draco was grateful. “Oh, okay,” Harry said, moving around Draco to close the window.
already,” Draco snapped. He could feel his temper rising in him, and it was all he could do to stop himself from breaking his probation restrictions and cursing Potter senseless.
It all seemed childish, now. He’d been incredibly embarrassed because of what Harry had done that day, but that didn’t even compare to all the embarrassment he had felt throughout the past two weeks, and especially today.
“I’m trying to tell you this in the least stalker-ish way I can; I watched you these past weeks, while I kept my distance, and I could see you were miserable. Am I wrong to note that I caused that?” Harry said nothing, but he did shift a little in his spot. Draco knew he was being a little more than courageous with what he was saying, but it had to be said. He just hoped it wouldn’t make Harry uncomfortable.
Theo sat closest to him on his right, though at a separate table, and was looking utterly bored. He could relate.
It was funny how two weeks could make every difference in the world; how you could feel whole within not even fourteen days, when you spent eighteen years feeling empty.
"The adventure of life is to learn. The purpose of life is to grow. The nature of life is to change." -William A. Ward
And on the door that led to their secret sanctuary, a door that led to a room which marked themselves a part of the castle, rested their first names, never to fall and never to wither, among photographs from the night they first kissed, magically stuck there until time ended.
It was clearly night out, and as he sat up a little in bed, he found that he couldn’t sit up all the way due to a million aches on his body. He then noticed there was a man standing in the corner of the room.
“Okay, okay last chance to turn back,” she said, coming to a halt at the top of the stairs that led down to the Great Hall.
Draco yawned. “I dunno. Doesn’t matter. I’m not entirely modest. I still think I’m the best looking person at Hogwarts. Although, that is a fact.”
What Draco had said to McGonagall had lit a flame inside of him, and he wasn’t ready to let it burn out before his mother left the castle. He knew he had to tell it to her now, or else he never would.
Drys was about to flourish his wand, and Draco’s first thought was that he was going to kill him right there, but he knew Drys wanted Draco alive too much to kill him. “A little less eager now, are you?” Draco said.
He thought he heard Harry shout, “Draco!” as he ran face first into a stone wall. He instinctively held out both hands as he met the wall, dropping the book he so desperately wanted to protect, and fell backwards. His back hit the floor along with his head, and he groaned in pain, clutching his nose that had banged into the stone.
Yes, Draco still felt sore in many places, but his vision was back to normal and nothing hurt terribly. Running into a wall was much more preferred to Draco than getting almost hexed to death by fellow Eighth Years.
It was crystal clear, but Draco was trying to stall. He had to think of something to get him and Harry out of this alive. He had to
“You’re still bleeding,” Harry commented, picking up his wand that had fallen onto the floor right next to his glasses that thankfully weren’t broken.
Harry placed his hands behind the back of his head, creating a makeshift pillow against the hard stone of the fountain. “Merlin, I cannot explain to you how much I hate the fucking
“Are you going to tell me what’s up or not? I want to help you with whatever it is. You were happy earlier, what changed?”
As they made their way through the empty halls of Hogwarts, Draco realized his chest felt immensely better. He hadn’t done too much walking ever since his and Potter’s fateful night in Hogsmeade, and he had been eating and sleeping pretty decently the past couple days, so he guessed it made sense that his injuries healed on their own and didn’t need any extra care from Madame Pomfrey. Well, he didn’t know for sure if starting to actually take care of himself helped him heal, but he liked to think it had.
Harry chuckled. “Maybe. But you really do deserve it. You did all the heroics. I was immobile on the forest floor.”
“Malfoy? Is that really you? Or am I imagining things?” Potter asked as he glanced around the halls like he was looking for something.
But was it really evil, when all Drys wanted was the opposite of the Dark Lord’s desires? Was it really evil, if all the Purebloods and Death Eaters who had ruined lives, got a taste of their own medicine?
The thing was, he didn’t even have that good of a reason for avoiding Harry. It was mostly self preservation, and the fact that he was scared. He was scared of himself; scared that he was a murderer, scared of his past, and scared of his future. Scared that he couldn’t sort these things out for himself.
The Eighth Years were allowed to leave Hogwarts and go down to Hogsmeade whenever they liked, as long as they got back before curfew. He knew they’d gone down a lot and threw parties almost every Thursday, but he never knew where exactly the parties were thrown until now. Pansy never asked him to go with her before today. He’d never said anything about it to her.
After about ten more minutes of impatiently sitting in bed, the Aurors and McGonagall finally lifted their heads in unison. McGonagall had a tight, strained look on her face. The Aurors were simply angry.
Kaspian. Draco thought the best apology would be for Potter to just end his supposed friendship with him right then and there, but he couldn’t have everything.
He wanted to blurt out that, no, he really hadn’t saved Harry’s life; he’d almost taken it away. But Draco
Because his father had died. Because- not that anyone else besides a few Aurors and McGonagall knew- that he had indirectly killed his own father when he killed Drys.
“Having hope? I don’t fucking know to be honest. Hope is way too overrated. But I mean the whole I-think-they’re-sleeping theory is better to believe than an I-think-they’re-dead theory. We do know they’re breathing, so there’s that.”
“So, Draco, I bet your real happy The Chosen One saved you from being stuck in that closet today. You're really lucky to have him as a friend,” Theo spoke casually, as if Draco and him were best mates.
“You do know you're a wizard, right, Potter?” Draco pointed out, just to make sure Potter did know that.
“Merlin, I hope everyone outside the Hogwarts area is alright. I can’t imagine the Weasley’s or just anyone having to go through this without knowing that they’re under some curse,” Potter added.
Drys pointed his wand at Draco one last time. Draco felt himself being whisked away into darkness, like what he’d gone through when he was transported to the scene of Olive’s murder.
in extremely good shape, so it made sense. He probably took the time to exercise; Draco wished he could ask him if that were true or not.
He quickly made himself secure and snug in Harry’s bed, and he wished Harry was asleep so that he could touch his overly soft hair. Draco knew the thought was creepy, but no one ever had to know what he was thinking except himself.
He didn’t know if that was due to Draco taking off so suddenly, the shock of it all leaving Harry standing stock still, until he was composed enough to run after Draco, or, if Draco was simply running too fast for Harry to catch up. He felt like he was running fast. It was probably the fastest he’d ever run in his life, not counting the time when he and the other Death Eater’s had to flee the Astronomy Tower, after Snape had killed Dumbledore.
He heard what was probably Robins muttering something to Theo, and then heard the door to the bathroom open and close.
McGonagall’s eyes widened in surprise. He didn’t blame her reaction. He wasn’t well known for agreeing or opening up on any terms.
He could now see, and Harry was grinning like an idiot. A mixture of pride, having casted a difficult spell correctly, and pleasure of annoying Draco.
“Hey,” Harry’s voice was incredibly soft and cute. Draco wanted to punch himself for thinking such sentimental things for the past
Potter was now walking quietly beside Draco as they made their way to McGonagall’s office, Snape’s book clutched tightly in his hand. Draco didn’t quite know whether or not he liked this Potter who was silent and kept to himself, rather than talk to Draco about pointless subjects.
The front entrance doors to Hogwarts loomed upon him, and he pushed open the door. One last time he glanced around behind him, and waited a couple minutes for a git with messy black hair and big green eyes to show up, with no luck.
Besides, he did eat. He ate dinner. He also occasionally slipped into the kitchen to grab a snack when he was hungry. He did take care of himself,
He told Harry about his adventure through the castle dungeons while searching for him, and how he had heard a noise that belonged to a person, which they now knew was Alec, and found a Slytherin tie on the ground.
“And now I wanted to let you know, I forgive you for avoiding me. You shouldn’t even have had to ask for forgiveness for that, really. I understand needing time alone to sort things out. I just, I did miss you. I only really wished for a quick explanation on why you were avoiding me, even after that time we briefly talked in the Hogshead.”
Could someone have kidnapped him while he was sleeping? How could someone have known to look for them in the Room of Requirement? How could they have gotten in without knowing what room they were using? That left him with only one other guess. Harry had voluntarily left the Room of Requirement.
At some point Draco had stood up; probably mirroring what Harry was doing, but now he found himself sitting back down on the picnic blanket, drumming his fingers on the ground.
Draco made a noncommittal grunt from across Potter as he eyed the pile of books Potter had set out on the table.
