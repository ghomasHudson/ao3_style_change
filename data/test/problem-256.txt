She sneered at bit at the mention of Prince Harold. Social status aside she wasn't a big fan of his. Not traditional enough for her liking, but one couldn't ignore the power and prestige a marriage with the royal house would bring. That's why all eligible women of age were there tonight, to farn over the very elusive Prince and his money. Draco could barf at it all. But that was the world they were living in.
"I love you," Harry had whispered as he carried him around. Because he was clingy after sex and Draco enjoyed that too. There was nothing about Harry, he didn't enjoy.
. And his kidnapper stared into his face. He recoiled at the sudden sight, fear creeping in his lungs, but the kidnapper just moved away, laughing and mumbling "this never gets old,". He got a bad feeling about that guy.
Ron snorted. "You look at him like he hung the moon, mate. And he always just glares and sneers and runs his ugly mug about how lucky you are to have him.
"Maybe for the next. I want to break them this time. Would you help with that?" Draco nodded enthusiastically.
"Oy, Zabini!" Harry yelled and the Slytherin glared at him with such malice, Harry had to pause. He never spoke with Zabini as long as he can remember, so what reason did Zabini have to be so hostile? A flash of silver hair came into his memory, the dejected look on Malfoy's face yesterday morning. Zabini had literally dragged Malfoy out of the Great Hall. Had they fought?
in him, that made Draco feel alive. He was looking forward to their meetings, to their fucks and (dare he say it) dates. He felt his chest warming and his face twitching with smiles, he wasn't comfortable sharing with Harry yet. But Harry saw them nonetheless, squeezed his hand in return and it was doing all kinds of things to Draco.
"It's alright," Malfoy said, "we have a little more time today." He wondered, how long that was, following Malfoy's wand movements. He cleaned him up, fed him water and soup, rubbed his back when he couldn't keep it down.
"Harry," he says and looks in Harry's eyes. The latter wants to look away, but one tug at his hand snaps his attention right back. He looks like he is in pain, in so
He's careful with the letter, turns it to see if there's a name, but there still isn't. A pang of disappointment fills him, but he doesn't allow himself to wallow in it. With his knife, he cuts the paper open and takes the letter out and the familiar hissing fills the Great Hall.
The god of friendship sneers and the god of happiness wonders if that's a face, friendship should have. It doesn't look pretty. But the god of love doesn't look better. He glares at the other with an unknown, but possibly bad, intent and somehow the god of happiness finds himself even more uncomfortable.
"You have some serious groveling to do, Potter. You won't experience the next day should you do something like that ever again," Draco said eerily and pointed to the chair next to him, "Also, we will have a talk about all of our needs and boundaries in detail. If I like the result, then..."
He admits and stands up, dusting up his clothes, even if there is no dust. A habit he picked up, after watching Draco. She eyes him curiously and he gives her his list.
And now everything fell into place. He remembered Harry as his childhood friend, someone he held dear and close to his heart. They only played for a few months together and Draco had missed him when he had left. Harry had promised to write, but he never did. After secluding himself in sorrow, Draco had buried those fond memories and hadn't let anyone close to his heart again. Now Harry's abrupt depature made sense. He had to go back to the palace and learn everything a prince had to learn.
Potter was an excellent flyer, Draco had to give him that. He had been flying against Potter for years now and he wasn't too shy to acknowledge the obvious talent. Must be in his blood, Draco mused. Potter's father also had been a legendary seeker, the Daily Prophet wrote about him a couple of years ago. Draco knew better than to trust anything that the newspaper published, although James Potter had his own shrine in Hogwarts, so that must have been true. But even if Potter was an excellent seeker, he still was mostly a reckless idiot. One time he dived right into the tribune Draco had been sitting on and only because he reacted fast enough Potter avoided a week in the hospital wing. Weasly tried to give him the fault, but Potter just glared at him and Granger lectured him and Potter about safe flying. Their faces were Draco's only source of amusement.
"Yes," you only say and Potter frowns at your rudeness. But that's hardly fair! The other man was rude first!
"Everyone lost something and had to work hard to get it back. Some things come never back and I'll always feel sorry for that," he paused, sighed and spoke with more conviction, "but I'll never feel sorry for my choices that concern my happiness. I want to feel that, I want to have that and I deserve that. And if my happiness is with Draco, then there's no one who can question me on that," he said and Hermione didn't dare to argue with him.
"How was it, dear, you were there quite a long time, was everything alright?" Mother asked, ever so concerned and Draco left before he could hear Lyra's answer. He found himself a secluded spot hidden away to continue his reading. The ball continued on without him and soon the first dance was announced.
You still know Professor Flitwick of course. He sadly doesn't remember you that well, but you catch up with him, and he invites you to tea. You accept, of course. Indulging him seems barely a hardship. Your chat with Professor Sinistra is interrupted, by Potter and the blond guy. They are in deep discussion, walking around their colleagues to the tea trolley, not once stopping. Potter gestures animately and the blond guy sneers. It's very impressive, that particular sneer. He seems to be disappointed, exasperated, unbelieving, and superior at once, but Potter doesn't seem to be impressed. He scowls when the blond guy cuts him off with a lazy hand and they sit down, nodding at the Headmistress.
"The Headmistress wants to speak with you after we arrive," Potter says and just looks outside the window.
"Now that you know everything and we don't have any secrets left to tell, will you answer me, Draco?" Harry asked hopeful, offering his hand again. "Will you let me court you and get to know you better?"
You must confess, that your expectations have been exceeded. The Headmistress herself is waiting for you in front of the wards and she nods regally in greeting. You bow slightly because your mother drilled manners in your head when you could barely walk, but it had been a while and McGonagall seems amused by your attempt. Your neck heats in embarrassment, but she saves you as she holds her hand out.
"You never kiss me, you never hug me, we don't go out on dates and you never even touch me if I don't ask. You nag and scold as if you're my mother or something but you never act like you're my boyfriend, you never act as if you love me," Harry roused and decided to cut a bit deeper, "I don't know if you never got any love yourself but you suck at showing it!"
The god of love hisses and the god of happiness can feel him getting tense again. He lays a hand on top of his to calm him.
Draco looked down in his glass as if he couldn't believe his ears. And he probably couldn't. This was the first time Harry stood up to Weasley for Draco and even if it was a bit too late, he was grateful.
"Can you live with that, Hermione?" Harry asked and she had to look at his face to see how serious he was about this. He wasn't smiling, just waiting patiently for her to answer. There was a little bit of fear in his eyes. He didn't want her to make him choose and for a little moment, Hermione hated herself for making him feel anxious about his place in her life. She vowed to never let him feel anxious about that ever again.
"I enjoyed it. He looked so scared when I woke him, but then he looked at me like I was his only hope when I left the room," he recounted and Harry nodded, agreeing.
"I only want, what's best for you, Harry," she whispered with tears in her eyes and Harry gently took her hand.
"He is violating his conditions for staying in the library." The Ravenclaw says and Pince looks over to the Slytherin.
"You're one to talk! Why are you two so mushy with him, huh?! Did you forget, what he did to us all those years? He was a bloody bully and a ferret and a Death Eater! He made fun of my family, he called 'Mione a
"You have abso-fucking-lutly no leg to stand on, Ron, I've seen what you're doing on Valentine's day," Harry shot back, catching his bottle right before it smashed against the table. "And what is it to you? I'm happy," he added and slapped Ron's finger away.
"I could kiss you now, you know?" Draco deadpans and Blaise laughs like the free spirit he is. "Please don't."
He swears, he never enjoyed a story of happiness this much. He is not surprised to find tears running down his face. The god makes no attempt to wish them away. He lets them wander freely, as he watches the two humans fly, holding each other's hand. And Draco, the god decided to call him now, looks so genuinely
"With all due respect, Headmistress, I don't want to be friends with Potter. I am thankful for what he has done," he pauses, taking a sip from his tea, "but he and I are not compatible."
"What do you want, Potter?" Zabini sneers and Harry huffs in annoyance. This secret admirer should be thankful, that Harry was keeping up with the snakes to find him.
"What should I do, if it never gets better? If I have to live with this pain for the rest of my life?" he asks quietly and Blaise decides there to do everything he can to let Potter see Draco. He burns Draco's face in his memory and vows to show Potter this if that twat ever messes up. Let that idiot die with guilt. But to do that, he has to bring them together. He owes Draco this.
"What? You have no date either? Go with me!" Pansy says and Draco sighs into his hands. This was what he was trying to avoid. Heterosexuality was so exhausting.
"Malfoy." Potter nods, ignoring the obvious hostility. Somehow that irritated Draco. Does Potter think, he's above him now?
"No, he doesn't," he begins nervously, "and I promise to you here and now, that I will give him a chance. Nothing more and nothing less." Zabini laughs.
He punished himself for his weakness. A simple breakup brought him to the edge of madness? Him? Draco Malfoy?
"Draco, I am so so sorry for what I said last night. None of it was the truth, I swear. I was just angry and confused because I see all those couples around us express their love a certain way, and Ron," Draco winced at that, and Harry noted that for later, "and Hermione were always the role model for my past relationships. I wanted what they had, I wanted to hear 'I love you' when I come home and I wanted kisses and cuddles. I emulated after them, helplessly, because that's how I thought a relationship had to look like. I was disappointed when you didn't do those things, but that's not your fault and it wasn't fair of me to expect that from you, since I never really communicated, that I wanted or needed that. You showed me your love in your way in so many different things and I was too dumb, blind, and oblivious to see the amazing person that you are and the effort you put into us. It was unfair of me to push my expectations on you and to let my pent-up frustration out on you. I should have managed better. Our relationship is our business and nobody should have any say or sway over it. I see that now," Harry said and bravely took steps forward, not quite close enough to touch but to make this talk more intimate.
"That doesn't excuse it. I threw a curse at you I didn't even knew the effect of! And I want to apologize for that. I had almost killed you right there, had Snape not..." Draco wants to comfort him but isn't quite sure how to. So he just smiles as assuring as he can.
"Seriously Potter, how can anyone be late with magic," he asked rhetorically and Harry's eyes were blinking with amusement.
"Hermione," he started, still speaking through his hands, "we fought a war, haven't we?" She nodded to agree.
"Yes, I imagine not. She would have to tell you, why we aren't close anymore and that story wouldn't paint her in a very good light," he affirmed, holding Harry's gaze. Just a year ago he would have given anything to have Harry look at him again.
"You have someone, you want to ask?" Draco winces and hides his face in his hands again. He wished for better friends.
Harry made sure their guest was comfortable downstairs, while Draco prepared dinner. Taking care of visitors always took a toll on Harry and he wanted to make sure, his husband was as relaxed as possible. He tasted the soup, before adding salt, as Harry pressed himself to his backside.
So when his husband asked, if he could invite a guest for an infinite stay, he agreed instantly without a second thought. Harry smiled down at him that evening, called him a
"No, no, not as much. I'll be there," you promise and she seems pleased. While you were talking, the castle came to view. It had been restored after the war, but you hadn't been allowed to help. Granted, you were a second year, and the trauma still fresh, but your
You decide, that you can't wait anymore and rip off the seal- your mother would be appalled, no doubt, she always cared for the subtle display of restraint, but she can kiss your ass right now- and skip the pleasantries the Headmistress wrote in the first five sentences. Well wishes and the polite conversations about your family and such and it's not like you don't appreciate it, but the suspense keeps you at the edge of your seat.
"My my, Potter is obviously one problem. But Draco here also has no date," he taunts and Draco sneers with as much malice as he can muster. What a twat.
"I'll go with you if nobody else wants to go with me. I haven't asked yet-" he begins and cuts himself off, as he realizes his mistake. Blaise perks up, clearly interested.
"I was thinking of inviting another guest in two months. Maybe a woman this time?" Harry suggested and Draco pretended to think about it.
Hogwarts looks much better. The castle is still healing, but the magic is there in those walls and the wind inside is like breathing. Draco touches the walls in one of the corridors to the Great Hall and he feels the presence of Hogwarts. It lets him touch it and it's warm to his hand, but he takes it back as if he got burned.
"That is so sweet!" Ron looks ready to gag, but Harry agrees with Hermione. He felt weird when he found out he was the only one in Hogwarts, who could speak Parseltongue. Except for Tom Riddle or course, but Harry didn't want to think about him. He had enough on his mind and the secret admirer was a welcomed distraction.
, he only like one boy! Surely the world shouldn't have anything against that! It wasn't like it was their business anyway! He tells Severus so.
"Gotta say, mate, you notice him more and more every year," he claims and Harry turns his head in wonder.
Talking to someone, who was unbiased, was refreshing to say at least. It irked him, that the healer wouldn't agree with him on certain things (like his coping mechanisms), but some opinions made more sense than those he came up with and he left the office more times relieved than not.
"But everyone would be horrified to hear about how you got it, right?" And you make a show to gesture to the whole Great Hall.
The mind healer said, it was good to feel good about progress. That he should remember this feeling, as proof how far he came.
"He's definitely going to Hogwarts. Not in Gryffindor, I think. He wrote something about Gryffindor bravery and that he doesn't have it," he explains and pauses. That comment sounded weirdly patronizing as if the writer was going to tease Harry with it. Not a Hufflepuff then. Hermione seems to think the same thing because she crosses Hufflepuff out on her list.
"Well, then let them have their freedom. They were very brave confessing like that. You shouldn't just find them and dispose of their privacy just to reject them," she lectures and Harry can kinda see the point. Doesn't mean, it doesn't suck though.
"Grow up, Granger," he drawled, "It's unavoidable, that I'll hurt him. Just as he'll hurt me. Because we're Potter and Malfoy and we're human. You can't possibly expect, that I will shy away from confrontation just so that I won't hurt his feelings," he sneered and took satisfaction in the way Granger's head seemed to redden just like her husband's.
Harry thinks, "then I can do that and treat him with the same respect. You don't have to like him, Ron. Just don't insult him." Weasley looks ready to snap at him again, but then Granger steps around the corner and Weasley just huffs.
"Just think about it: All those innocent students, looking up to you, just to learn, what a piece of shit you really are, Malfoy," you spat his name like a hex and you are louder than you wanted to be because Potter interrupts the Sorting and looks over his shoulder. You plaster on a sweet smile, but you can see the brittle grimace on Malfoy's face. Potter frowns at you.
"He needs something to ease his mind. He doesn't sleep that well," he admits and she looks surprised. She always thought, Harry was hiding something from her.
Hermione grumbles in concentration and wraps a strand of her hair around her finger. Harry finds it terribly endearing.
"That's great, Harry," he says and pretends, he isn't heartbroken. He swallows a sob and tries to blink his tears away. He doesn't want to cry in front of Harry, doesn't want him to ask, what's wrong, because Draco
"Draco! The hairpin!" Lyra yelled again and this time he couldn't contain a tired sign. Why she wouldn't just ask her servant to fetch it for her was beyond him. He suspected, she just liked to order him around as long as she still could.
"Please, Pansy, let me fix it," Harry pleaded, "I'll do anything you want, just let me talk to him."
"You've been to Hogwarts before, haven't you?" he asks bewildered. You nod hesitantly, not seeing the connection.
The Ravenclaw pales and nods hurriedly. Draco can't help but smirk at that. Pince regards the other students with another chilly look, daring them to speak against her judgment. Out of fear for losing more points or out of respect Draco doesn't know, but nobody speaks to him again the entire week.
"And do you know the best part?" Potter asked, but he doesn't expect an answer and talked on anyway.
"I'm sure," he repeats, but his voice cracks. Tears spill and he rubs his hands over his face wishing his tears away, but he can't stop. He shudders and his broomstick shakes with him. Draco watches and carefully steadies his and Harry's broom with both of his hands. Harry taught him that a few days ago. He had been so proud and promised Draco to take him flying. Draco hadn't believed him then. But Harry came into their room today and took him out.
Sometimes Draco just wants to go back. He feels, that he missed a lot in his youth and that he has no chance to relive it. He wants to make more friends, work harder, and question more instead of just doing what his father wants. To take more risks. Maybe he could have helped to end the war much sooner, but what done is is done. He can only remember and regret it.
"People like us?" he echoes and Severus nods solemnly. "Men, who like... men," he says and Draco's eyes widen. He didn't like
"Potter, I'm really sorry for all the things I did to you. I know, it isn't much comfort now and I should have said it right after the war, and I should have...
At the beginning of the term, she wasn't quite sure if Draco would hold on. She warned him enough, that was clear because there was no incident in which Draco offended or hurt someone. He still had no friends, but she counted that as a win. She didn't expect him to behave, but he had been nothing but polite and attentive. But McGonagall found his silence concerning. Draco wasn't someone, who stood in shadows. He was a powerful wizard and had so much potential. She would hate it to let go to waste.
After a week of exchanging pleasantries, Granger proceeded to talk to him about Potions homework and Draco found, that she was a nice study companion. She was quiet and let him do his own thing, but she also asked questions here and then and it amused Draco to no end when she canceled on Weasley to study with him.
Draco took all of his words with fearsome silence. Then, he said slowly, "You really think that I don't love you."
"Ah, you must miss your Romeo, huh?" Potter asked and stood up, walking up the stairs and he tried to go after Potter, stop him from whatever he would do to Malfoy. But he was tied up, not able to move.
"Are you still alive?" Malfoy asked, but he could only nod weakly. He had no strength in any of his muscles.
"He's hurting you like he's hurting me," he said and Malfoy nodded very slowly and continued watching him carefully.
"What was it?" Harry asked and this time, the searching gaze lay on her. It wasn't comfortable, she had to admit. She had to take a few deep breaths to steel herself for the conversation she didn't want to have.
"Wait, wait, no no! Pansy! Pansy let me in!" Harry hurried to explain and held his hands high. "I didn't break in, I promise."
"Maybe that would be a start," she says nonetheless, taking her own cup of tea. Draco glares at his hands, holding tears back. The war made him and his family criminals and he was receiving punishment for it. Clearly the whole school still hated him. After his NEWTS he would drown in the Ministry or die trying to survive. There was no need to apologize. The dead would not come back, the loss would not hurt less and he could not pay back the tears that fell. Had he be the one, some Ex-Death-Eater apologized to, he's not even sure if he would hear them out. Too deep was the pain and too recent the war.
"Soon, love. He's almost where we want him," Draco said, hugging Harry close. His husband didn't look quite as pleased as he normally would, as he stepped out of the basement and this time he went straight for Draco's embrace.
"I wouldn't be his date, even if they paid me," Draco tries to deadpan, but his voice cracks. Blaise looks at him amused, so Draco just coughs and frowns.
"Come to the Leakey with me," he repeated and Draco briefly wondered if he hit his head on the way here.
King James had married Queen Lily, a commoner, while breaking off his engagement with his promised lady. It had been quite the scandal if one could believe the gossip Mother exchanged on her weekly afternoon tea parties.
"Quite fine, thank you for asking. You are well, I hope?" he responded, and Harry's frown went deeper.
"Thank you, your highness," Draco managed to say while keeping his voice even, "That's kind of you."
"So, what did it say? I've never seen a letter like this," Ron asks, and he has no food in his mouth and Harry is so proud. Hermione scans the paper again, tips against it with her wand, but the parchment stays the way it is. Blank.
"Minerva insisted. Why? Are you jealous? Can't handle that you don't have the privilege? You want to call Professor Sprout
do. It's your secret admirer after all. I've done the basic work for you and made you a list. And you just have to speak with every Slytherin and Ravenclaw on that list," she grins and hands him the parchment. It's a very long list. Harry pouts and scans the names. Some of them sound familiar and some of them are just names without a face.
"Please have an eye on Lyra, will you, son?" Mother asked, no, demanded really and all Draco could give was an tired smile. Lyra would run off and mingle with her friends the moment they would set foot into the castle and he would be forced to tail after her like a puppy. He already dreaded it.
"Our partner is assigned. We don't swap unless we have a good reason," he explains and looks at you like you should know this. You probably should.
But the warm feeling and the pure happiness left with Harry that morning. The cold, stabbing betrayal clamped down his breath, settles in his stomach and he fet a new slash on his heart. It was deeper than every slash before and it would take longer to heal. It might never. It will definitely leave a scar.
You arrive punctually and McGonagall nods at you approvingly. Potter and the other man are not there yet, you notice with disappointment, but you use the chance to talk with the other Professors. Pomona Sprout and her apprentice Neville Longbottom are the most welcoming of the bunch. They pelt you with questions, not at all satisfied with your carefully chosen answers. By the end of your talk, they made you promise to visit them in the Greenhouses and you're happy, that they try to include you.
The year was going by and the Tournament was starting. Everyone seemed excited about the tasks and the other schools. The boys in his year were fawning over the Beauxbaton girls, but Draco found himself watching the Durmstrang boys instead. There was a weird beauty in the way they were holding themselves. They reminded him a little bit of wild beasts. Draco smirked. He could appreciate the raw beauty in that. But despite that, he cheered for Harry, as the Gryffindor fought with the dragon. Blaise and Pansy were obviously amused, but Draco justified, that everything was better than a Hufflepuff. They didn't seem to buy it, but they left him alone.
"I will come for you," he said and Malfoy managed a shaky smile. He took his hand back and ushered him with a vague wave.
"He speaks Parseltongue and he learned it for me. He says I looked sad when I found out in second-year and that he wanted to talk to me," he adds, and Hermione coos.
"Alright alright, I'll spill," he says and his friends look more excited than he does. "I've met Zabini yesterday and he knows, who my secret admirer is," he rushes out and Hermione blinks two times, before a big smile plasterers over her face.
But this human looked like a challenge. He went through a war- together with other young humans against someone, who might as well be dead. Cold eyes, conveying madness, and hate. The god shuddered. He felt uncomfortable, bringing this madman happiness. But it was his job and for a while, it worked. The madman believed the lie and was happy with that outcome. But he forgot that happiness doesn't last. He was defeated and cursed everyone in his last breath.
It must be is punishment, he accepted, as other wizards decide the future of him and his family. Azkaban for his father. He escaped the kiss, but the outcome was the same. He will never be sane anymore and Draco misses him. Misses the father of his childhood, who brought him his first wand and broom, who took him to the most interesting places. Who taught him chess and magic. He will miss him.
Potter seemed to like to peel his skin off. It never failed to make him scream. The pain was tolerable after a while, but the skin under was sore and sensitive. One-touch felt like he was being set on fire and Potter liked his expressions the most. He watched in delight, poking and stroking almost carefully the red skin, sometimes harder sometimes softer. It would go on for hours and he wished in those moments, that Potter would just kill him.
"You'll get over him, mate, you'll see. You just need a date for the bloody Ball and then you have something else to think about," he promises and Harry thinks that Ron tries to reassure him, but all it does is shoving him into his thinking again. About Potion homework. Not Malfoy. Certainly not Malfoy.
"Of course, Harry! Can you write the letter on normal parchment? We can analyze it better then," she says and Harry's tempted to say yes. But then he remembers, that it's
"A boy then?" he asks and Harry looks startled. It had surprised him to get a love letter in Parseltongue, so he had forgotten about that important detail. Hermione looks at him, calculating.
"He doesn't have to be. I wasn't really nice to him for the last seven years," he admits and Potter looks at him in wonder. It's a nice look on him, Draco finds.
For a few days, he thinks about the things McGonagall said to him. Apologizing was still no option. He feared rejection and mockery to much to do that right now.
"But, but, I'm a man!" Draco objected hotly. He wouldn't let himself be ridiculed again. Harry had played with his feelings for far too long, he would never allow it to happen again.
"I'm happy to be here too," you say, and hope that your voice doesn't crack. You are more confident elsewhere, but the former Professor had always this effect on people. You suspect it is because she has seen you at the most humiliating time of your life. Teenagers are never easy, but you could have been a little bit more difficult than most. The knowing glint in her eyes seems to say, that she also remembers, and really, this isn't how you imagined it at all.
He didn't remember, how he ended up on Ron's couch, but Harry woke up there with a massive headache and the sinking feeling, that he lost something precious.
"Alright," Blaise says and packs his things, "we're talking in our room. Come one." Draco lets himself be dragged from the table and he wants to look at Harry, wants him to know how much he hurt Draco, but he cannot bring himself too. So he goes along, offers no resistance, and doesn't feel the gaze on his back.
"I don't know," Harry says, but Draco can see, that he's lying. He lets his eyes wander to his other hand in his own lap and now he definitely wants his other hand back. He's tired and angry and sad and he just wants to close his eyes and sleep for a long time. So he does.
"Have you apologized, Mr. Malfoy?" she asks then carefully as if she tries not to offend him. Draco avoids her gaze, tense in his shoulders. He is ashamed enough for what he did. He doesn't need Potter to make fun of him too.
“Pretty much yeah,” Harry grinned ruefully. “And the way you sounded when you were talking French to Alexandre earlier.”
Draco groaned, embarrassed but horribly turned on as he threw his forearm across his face and tried to catch his breath. He was lying on his back now, completely exposed with his feet squashed up against the pillow. Draco’s chest was moving rapidly and he could feel his cock throbbing so hard it was almost painful, the wet tip stickily connecting with his abdomen.
It had been nearly a fortnight now that the investigation had been ongoing. Two weeks without Lilac Close, home cooking, wine evenings with Magalie, or Lisette calmly reassuring Malfoy that his hair was looking thicker already after he applied his homebrewed potions. For one mad moment Harry wondered if he could go visit the other man, maybe take him one of the marbles, before he realised that that was completely against regulations. Harry was actively investigating a ‘suspect’ and Malfoy probably didn’t even have a clue about who the nameless auror digging through his memories was.
“Does it?” Ron asked incredulously, leaning into their conversation. “Would have thought house elves would have taken care of all that.”
“What is?” Harry questioned, pausing outside Pewterfoot’s door, he could hear ominous gurgling noises coming from within and assumed their boss must be feeding his squid.
“You’re welcome,” Harry grinned, leaning back against the wall and realizing he had been sweating. God only knew why that bloody marble was so important right now.
Draco whimpered as he could feel himself growing hard in his shorts and then utterly relieved when he realised the same thing was happening to Harry. Their crotches brushed against each other, causing Draco to stutter forwards in a broken moan, seeking that delicious friction again.
“There you are mate!” Ron shouted, striding up to them and pecking Hermione on the cheek with a kiss. “Penny told me you ran off, now what’s this I hear about an overly pink sausage?”
“Don’t,” Harry said, coming to sit beside Draco and pressing their shoulders together. “I think you should save them. There might be moments in the future that you’d like Magalie, Lisette and Philippe to be there for.”
“Yeah,” Harry smiled, “is that alright?” he held his breath for a moment before Draco seemed to relax in his arms.
Later that evening, after exiting the memory and finishing his paperwork, Harry joined the rest of the usual gang in the pub. This week, drinks were being held at the slightly fancier Pickle and Pear on account of Seamus celebrating a promotion at work. Harry laughed along with the others as Seamus grumbled half heartedly at being expected to pay for everybody’s drinks as a result.
“Oh stop griping Ronald,” Hermione came into view, carrying two glasses of red wine, one of which she passed to Ron. “Hello Harry, isn’t it lovely? Apparently they’re going to go full out on the winter theme, Ginny’s asked me to research localized weather charms to guarantee some festive snow.”
“Occamy eggs then?” Bill stated loudly catching Draco’s eye and in the split second that followed somehow conveying everything he needed to. Draco unclenched his jaw and nodded, almost imperceptibly, back.
“You’re so needy,” Draco sighed sufferingly, but he nudged into Harry’s side with an affectionate smile. “If that’s the rule then I expect the same courtesy from you. I don’t want to see any case files containing grisly murders whilst we’re there – and no firecalling Ronald to discuss them either!”
Draco chewed worriedly on his lip, at least a Pensieve Probe couldn’t actually read the mind of the person being probed, if that had happened then Potter would also be aware that he heavily featured in Draco’s wanking fantasies.
Harry grinned as Draco pulled off his slipper socks and got into bed. A little while later, he was doing the same, his mouth fresh and minty.
“Draco this recipe serves four,” Magalie stood hunched over the age stained recipe book with a furrowed brow.
“First round in the Leaky says it’s soup,” Ron nodded thoughtfully. “Even the ferret’s got to eat more than a single mush filled sandwich and few grapes.”
“Okay, we’ve got a lead on the Moreton-in-Marsh incident,” Ron came striding in through the doorway. “Apparently the portkey has been traced to Salcome and then there was a redirection to Toulouse which confused the – Harry?”
“He – wait, he did?” Ron asked with a look of surprise. “But you just told us the French want to check out the lead from Cockfosters again?”
“Merlin,” Draco gasped. The Ariadne curse condemned the victim to turn into a spider if they tried to sew or weave. When combined with the Sorcha curse it would mean that finishing six nettle robes would be nigh on impossible. “That would be a conundrum.”
“No, it was, it was sort of official,” Draco winced miserably as Odette’s eyebrows raised and she evidently cottoned on.
“The suspect works for the Ministry,” Pewterfoot replied tightly, “some low level paper pusher, but still. He was identified by name and has a criminal record and –“
“Honestly, you’re only improving that shirt at this point,” Draco sniffed. “How did you even acquire such an eye sore? Don’t tell me you bought it of your own free will?”
Harry wondered how the illusions always seemed to know what to say so as not to upset or offend Malfoy in any way? Ron had mentioned something about personality charms derived from memories.
Harry turned to see a cheery looking Arthur Weasley shuffling out of one of the lifts before he waved to a colleague and hurried off in the direction of the Muggle Affairs offices.
“Yes, well trust you to defend him,” Andromeda snorted as she dipped a gingernut biscuit into her steaming tea. “We all know the sorts of hijinks you lot got up to at school.”
Draco’s eyes widened as he took in the huge green stove that occupied the far wall of the kitchen, it had enough room to cook seven different dishes simultaneously and there was a large, empty grate for a roaring fire. The entire thing, however, was covered in a thick layer of dust, the chimney blackened and cold.
It was Wednesday morning when Draco decided he was hallucinating again, despite the day not even being that hot. He came to this conclusion because Harry Potter was standing in front of his desk looking awkward and holding a cinnamon swirl out with a napkin.
“What’s he like now?” Hermione asked, she look a little nervous as if she was cross with herself for being just as curious as the rest of them.
He yawned as Malfoy carefully read the contents of the card before sighing and getting up to put it on a nearby shelf.
After attaching his letter to the owl, Malfoy stood silently by the window for a few moments. Harry regarded the other man, the pale grey light from outdoors was casting his features in sharp relief. Malfoy’s grey eyes scrunched up slightly as the sun emerged from behind a cloud and lit up a section of dust particles floating in the air.
Hermione directed Draco to a spare bedroom upstairs with an attached ensuite. It was all decorated in a very quaint English country cottage style with a Welsh dresser up against one wall and floral wallpaper. A vase of Sweet Williams stood on a table by a small window, out of which Draco could see the party still going in full swing. Someone had set up a charmed croquet set over by the hedge and Neville Longbottom was laughing as he lined up his mallet with a bright red ball.
“The old Black House?” Draco asked. “I remember going there when I was a child, isn’t it four storeys?”
This year, it had been decided that Harry and Neville would hold a joint birthday garden party. Everyone had already pitched in enough galleons to buy a one day extension charm, allowing them to fit a swimming pool at the back of the garden. Ron had already purchased a suitably garish Hawaiian shirt ready for the occasion and was pre-polishing his barbeque.
“Honestly,” Matthew shook his head “I mean if I had agreed with the man then we’d both be wrong so what was I meant to do?”
“You know full well those shops won’t serve me,” Malfoy snarled angrily, a red flush had appeared on his cheeks. Behind him, a couple of other customers laughed under their breath.
“Don’t be so dramatic Potter,” Draco sniffed as the lift started moving up. “I’ve simply been offered a more preferable position with Gringotts.”
“He brought a new piece today,” Ron continued as Harry chanced a glance at Penny. The other witch was blushing but was clearly struggling not to laugh as Ron described the new hose nozzle that George had designed.
Draco sighed as he ran his fingertip across the messily scribed ink. He flinched a moment later as Marlene appeared from round the corner.
“I didn’t know it scarred,” Harry whispered into the damp air, “I thought Snape was able to…” he trailed off as his eyes caught on the severe black tattoo still stamped across Malfoy’s left forearm. The skull and snake had gone almost blurry over time but the depth of the black was still there, so violently contrasting the milky white skin around it. Harry sighed, not even sure how to process what he was feeling as Malfoy continued to busy himself with casting cleaning charms on his clothes and folding them neatly onto the bathroom cabinet.
Draco paused before nodding, as if he approved of that assessment. “Your flipflops are in my suitcase, I figured you’d forget them.”
“Oh god,” Draco gasped as they started to rock together, Harry thrusting into him as he rubbed at Draco’s cock with clever fingers. Draco moaned and wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, lifting himself up as his hips were pinned against the mattress, Harry pounding with echoing grunts, it was primal and raw, their sweat soaked skin sticking to each other in a tight embrace.
“Oh, well that’s good for him then,” Penny replied brightly. “I think only the first Pensieve Probe I ever did confirmed a suspect’s innocence. He was accused of doing away with some old witch for her galleons but on the night in question he was sat at home in his boxer shorts watching niffler suit porn.”
“And they don’t even have the good sense to try and restructure it!” Malfoy was shouting from where he was rummaging in a cupboard in the corner of the room.
“I’m alright thanks,” Harry shook his head before taking a deep breath and submerging his face in cool, jelly like water. Going into someone else’s memories was never a pleasant experience but it didn’t seem to have the same nauseating effect on Harry that it did on some of the other aurors like Ron. Harry half wondered if it was due to having grown up with Uncle Vernon’s driving, the car lurching side to side along with the road rage induced jerks of his head.
“Get away you insatiable beast!” Draco smacked at Harry’s chest, but he was laughing. “I’m serious, if we’re late for the port key and I don’t get my nice tan before Ginevra’s wedding I’ll have your balls.”
have to bribe anyone with?” Ed’s eyes ran over Draco, zeroing in on his right knee, where Draco knew he had a floo powder stain from that morning, the type that only happened if you used the cheap variety.
“Truce?” Harry wheezed as the two of them swam over to haul themselves out onto the sun baked tiles.
“Oh, feeling fancy today are we?” Harry commented with a smile as Malfoy scooped two spoonfuls of the tea into a glazed brown ceramic teapot and drew a strainer out of the cutlery drawer.
Ron wasn’t stopping with his irritatingly knowing grin so Harry quickly tried to redirect the conversation.
“Alright Ron?” Harry peered over the top of his glasses as his friend’s face materialized in the flames.
“No, I mean,” Draco huffed, realising that everyone was looking curiously at him. “It was an apology bun, for something that happened at lunch on Monday.”
“Well, yes,” Hermione smiled, “but I think he was more concerned with finding someone that would cheer you up at bit.”
He rejoined the memory a few hours later and frowned at the scene in front of him. Half of Malfoy’s flat was in complete disarray and the man himself was on all fours rooting around under fridge. Malfoy’s hair was stuck up at odd angles and he had lost the waistcoat, his shirt now looking rather disheveled.
“Pensieve Probes can be very draining,” Hermione cleared her throat as she settled her wine on a nearby coffee table. Harry stared at one of Hugo discarded toys on the floor, it was a charmed Romanian Longhorn plush that flapped its wings every so often. He remembered Charlie had brought it as a Christening present years ago.
Malfoy was perched with a rigid posture on a chair that Harry was convinced Picklemarsh had deliberately ordered in a child size so as to make everyone who sat there feel inferior. The blond man had so far not said a single word, although Harry could see that his knuckles were white where they were gripping his bony knees.
Magalie was looking between the two men with a slightly confused expression, but she was still smiling.
“Yes, well,” the other man sniffed, “I think we’ve established that is the typical Gryffindor way by now.”
“No one needs to hear about what you keep in your pants Harry,” George snorted loudly as he hurried past them chasing after the garden gnome who appeared to have nicked a popsicle. Harry could vaguely hear the traumatized wails of a child in the background.
Back home, carefully packed in Harry’s suitcase, was a ring, that although it wasn’t quite four carats, he was pretty sure Draco was going to say ‘yes’ anyway.
“This is Bill Weasley,” Harry announced, for some inexplicable reason sounding like a child showing off their best drawing to a parent and waiting for a pat on the head. “Ron’s brother.”
Harry glanced up at the chalkboard above the counter in Fortescue’s. He had a strange craving to try fig ice cream but it didn’t seem to be on offer. In the end he settled for coffee and pistachio before sitting down at a small corner table.
Harry sighed, all the enthusiasm for the barbeque dissipating as quickly as it had come. He glanced back down at the menus before shaking his head and dialing for a pizza instead.
Neville and Hannah would have flooed down from Hogwarts, Ginny would be back to spend the weekend with the family and would inevitably turn up at the pub late with her boyfriend Samuel. Ron and Hermione would be present of course, with Molly babysitting Rose and Hugo. Sometimes Luna would show up if she was back from a research trip. There were others too, friends from school or the aurors, Terry, Seamus, Dean and everyone’s significant others or whoever they were dating at that point. In their twenties, the night had culminated with getting exceedingly drunk and maybe stumbling on to another bar, but now it was thankfully a more relaxed pace.
“Damn, I was thinking of setting you up with my friend Terrence but if you’ve already got the great Harry Potter after you,” Matthew grinned, like a shark with too many teeth.
“If you’re going to be relying on business penmanship,” the woman finished for him with a wide smile. “I’m Odette by the way, Odette Seaver, I work in Legal Affairs.”
Harry yawned widely, he was working overtime today to try and get through the last few vials of Malfoy’s memories. He knew the sooner he got it done the sooner he could file for the other man’s release.
“Stupid buffoon,” Malfoy added, causing Harry to gape indignantly at him. “Always running headfirst into trouble. God forbid someone else get the glory.”
Harry,” George cackled, running back past them with the garden gnome under his arm, “keep it in your pants!”
“Potter just walked into that job you know,” Malfoy continued, the saucepan bubbling happily away behind him. “You don’t need Newts when you’re the Saviour apparently. And oh, Lisi, you should have
Draco cracked his back as soon as he walked through the door. It had been a rough day at work in some oft forgotten basement room at the Ministry of Magic. Piles of paperwork higher than Mount Everest seemed to be dumped on his desk with alarming regularity and it was all he could do to diligently work through them whilst keeping one eye on the clock.
The bed shifted and dipped, causing Draco to move his arm and see that Harry had come to lie down beside him, his hand resting on the pale inside of Draco’s thigh.
“Harry,” Draco responded, he looked a little nervous but not openly hostile like Harry had been prepared for.
“How wonderful,” Draco cut across her icily. “I’m afraid Harry and I must get a wiggle on though, you see we’re running late for our portkey. We’re spending the next month vacationing in Thailand, I’m quite looking forward to the break from cooking and just lazing on the beach instead.”
There were two pieces of mail in the letterbox. One was a thin brown package containing a visitors pass for the Comet Broom company. That cheered Draco up immeasurably, Matthew had promised to take him on a guided tour, including a sneak peak at the new Comet 360 which was rumored to have new turning technology, allowing the rider to maneuver in circles at greater speeds.
“Has somebody put you up to this Potter?” Draco questioned with a sneer that he hoped covered his complete and hopeless confusion. “Marlene or –“
“Yes,” Draco whispered, sticking out his tongue to trace a circle around Harry’s nipple, wetting the hair there.
Harry’s mind flashed back to a haggard looking boy, dirty blond hair covering his sunken face as he stood in the accused box. For some reason, Harry remembered Malfoy’s hands, smudged with dirt from the Ministry’s overburdened holding cells after the War, long fingers trembling, blackened nails.
Harry massaged his quads as Ron leaned against his desk in their shared office. The other man was still panting despite them having apparated back over ten minutes ago.
“Git,” Harry huffed, but he was smiling as he led Draco into a sitting room that was indeed painted a ghastly shade of brown. The house was huge and Draco imagined it could be magnificent, there was so much old familial magic running through the veins of the walls. The Blacks must have gone to great lengths to top up the well that was undoubtedly sealed into the bedrock of the foundations.
“Can’t imagine the Malfoys are too popular nowadays,” Harry added, “could just be someone trying to fling a bit of mud and see if it sticks?”
“I try,” Harry shrugged, “Mione even bought me one of those special grip quills, the ones that guarantee to improve your cursive.”
“Do you really eat curry in your underwear?” Draco asked as Harry snorted. Whatever he had been expecting in a first question, that was not it.
“That’s more like it,” Picklemarsh grumbled, waving his hand so as to make it clear that Malfoy was dismissed.
The item in question was one of the Pop Up Pals marbles, it was orange in colour. Harry leaned forwards to pick it up, rolling it around the surface of his palm. “Do you think maybe we could activate it?”
“Potter,” Draco nodded, moving to sidestep past the man and make a dash for the magical theory section.
“You can’t be employed by the Ministry with a record?” Ron questioned, shooting Harry a confused look.
“Ooh I think I’d quite like a glass of Merbrew!” Hermione piped up giggling. Merbrew was a trendy new Norwegian ale that was fermented from some sort of kelp that only merpeople could farm in arctic waters. Harry remembered Percy complaining about the number of import tariffs and taxes involved in creature – wizard trade deals, meaning that even though the drink was quite cheap if you were in Tromsø, the London mark up was enough to make your wallet quiver in fear.
“Good heavens, no,” Pewterfoot looked surprised, “he’s an ex Death Eater. No, he’s being kept in one of the Ministry holding cells.”
Draco sighed as he closed the window in juddering jerks before tossing the letter onto the coffee table.
On Monday morning, he donned a lemon coloured waistcoat with a crisp white shirt and charcoal trousers before hurrying out of his flat towards the local floo point. Sure enough, the cold snap was decidedly over and Draco could feel beads of sweat soaking into his starched collar.
It turned out there was only one lemon flavoured shortbread left, which Malfoy made quick work of, diligently licking the crumbs from his fingers. Harry blinked as he caught himself staring with his mouth open as the other man sucked his index finger between wet lips before releasing it with a pop.
“Bloody hell!” Ron exclaimed as a dark skinned woman in a green cardigan bounced into the kitchen. “I didn’t see any flatmates in the report? Is she his girlfriend?”
“Hmm? Oh yeah, he’ll actually be at the party later, he’s coming down from Scotland with Neville, Hannah and a few other members of staff – you know Nev teaches there.”
“People like you shouldn’t have power over anyone,” Harry growled, giving Picklemarsh one last withering glare before the memory dissolved into Malfoy pacing up and down back by his own desk.
“Luna was a Ravenclaw,” Harry smiled sheepishly and ran his fingers through the untameable raven mess that he called hair. It was predictably glossy and thick despite Potter probably lathering it daily with hand soap Draco lamented bitterly. “And Hannah was a Hufflepuff, but actually I don’t think she’ll be down this week, she’s got her sister over from Belgium.”
“I want a garden,” Malfoy announced whilst hunched over his aging cauldron. His sleeves were rolled up and he had worked up a flush on his face from scrubbing at a particular stubborn stain on the inside lip.
“It’ll be announced in the newspapers come Monday,” Penny said proudly. “Ed and I were able to get some information from one of the troll trainers after finding out his daughter broke her parole for illegal wand enhancements last autumn. He cut a deal and we got our names, apparently one of the main financers was Bernard Muddleford.”
“I don’t doubt it,” Harry said quickly. “Draco, it wasn’t that I pitied you, I was just honestly annoyed.”
“Oh alright,” Hermione interrupted with a sigh, “you’re right, it just came as a surprise that’s all. Oh!” she gasped with a suddenly very pleased expression. “This means I’ve a legitimate reason to get rid of all those hideous gardening tools George keeps bringing over. Make sure you take them with you today – I don’t want another repeat of having to explain to Hugo why the watering can has a giant pair of perforated boobs on it.”
“God you’re gorgeous,” Harry whispered hotly into the sensitive shell of Draco’s ear. Draco shivered, levering the top half of his body round to catch Harry’s mouth in a messy kiss.
Since the last set of Ministry reforms however, more emphasis had been put on memories as evidence and there were new charms to try and check for retroactive alterations. It wasn’t water tight, but it was enough that every so often Ron and Harry would find themselves with their heads stuck in a pensieve for the day.
Draco arrived home at around eleven pm, he couldn’t believe he had just spent five hours voluntarily conversing to a Weasley. Without a fireplace he couldn’t firecall Odette or Matthew, so instead he hurriedly sifted through his marbles, opening a yellow one.
“I should go talk to him,” Harry announced, taking off his glasses to clean them for the fifth time that morning.
“Maybe it’s just Malfoy?” Ron asked as the memory morphed to take them inside a small London apartment. “He’s always rubbed people the wrong way, can’t imagine he’s changed that much?”
“You’re so beautiful,” Harry told him, crawling back up Draco’s body and pressing a kiss to his cock, licking it like he had done Draco’s neck. Draco bit his lip as he felt himself begin to thicken again, his prick stiffening under Harry’s careful ministrations. The first press of a finger at his hole made Draco tense but Harry distracted him by suckling the entirety of Draco’s cock’s head into his sinful mouth.
“I see,” Draco replied with a small smile. As Weasleys went, this one might not actually be so bad. “So what exactly was it you found?”
Harry jerked his gaze up to where Malfoy had spoken, realizing that the other man was still looking at the screen where Featherhorn had still forgotten to find a new shirt and was now striding up and down what looked like a hospital ward with a stethoscope round his neck. Hermione would have a fit at how Healers were being represented.
“Hey Neville,” Harry cleared his throat as he caught the attention of the other man. They were a few drinks in to the night now and the volume of the table had correspondingly risen.
“I did it yesterday,” Harry replied with a face, joint cases with the Italian office were always a nightmare in terms of administration.
“No problem Sir,” Ron grinned, puffing out his chest, “I’ll get you a full kilo sack on your desk by tomorrow.”
Damn, Hermione had already broached the topic of weather, now what in hell’s bells was Draco meant to use for conversation?
“Probably because he saw two uniformed aurors approach him whilst he was in possession of illegal potions,” Harry replied sardonically. His right calf was cramping wickedly and he eventually admitted defeat and aimed a muscle relaxing spell at it.
As it turned out, Pewterfoot wasn’t even in the conference room yet, Penny informed them he was caught up on a firecall elsewhere.
Harry snorted at the image, settling down in one of the nearby chairs. Normally you weren’t able to interact with items in a memory but more recent extensions on charm work, the type that stopped you dissolving through the floor in a memory, allowed for the more practised pensieve divers to sit down or lean against handy walls.
Harry gasped as Draco’s thumb brushed a flat brown nipple. Draco supposed it was a sound of approval as he moved his hand even lower, tracing down abdominal muscles.
the one that reported Malfoy as having something to do with the Dark Ring?” Harry turned angrily on Winshaw, but the other man was already walking away, Marlene in tow.
“Am I boring?” Harry asked the space at large but flicking his eyes curiously to Malfoy. “Only I think my friends are worried I’m becoming boring and even you say my reports are boring, which yeah, I probably don’t write them very well but – oi!” Harry scrambled up as Malfoy exited the bathroom with a flourish.
“I see,” Draco nodded, his shoulders seeming to relax. “My family and I went to a winter solstice wedding once, they can be exceedingly beautiful.”
“No, I don’t think it’s that,” Draco shook his head thoughtfully. His father had always tried to instil in Draco that Malfoys were meant for greatness – and where had that gotten them? “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with my job at the moment, if someone enjoyed it that is, but I don’t.”
?” the witch enquired, “Yes I think I’ve got a copy of that left. It’s not that new though, came out last November I believe.”
Harry cast another tempus, it was 17:26, he was just about to give up and floo home when he caught a flash of white blond hair.
Harry glanced up as Ron paled further and began to backtrack. “I mean it’s better than Azkaban! Don’t worry, I’ve seen the cells before – they’re quite comfy really, I mean not
“Yeah, but,” Harry began, half annoyed at himself for seemingly being so set on defending Malfoy. He figured it must be because if Malfoy really had gone bad after all Harry had done to get him acquitted when they were eighteen, that would just be like a kick in the teeth. “Wasn’t George up for investigation a few years ago as well for that exact thing?”
“But they were banned in America due to choking hazards and he sent them out as part of a package to Wisconsin,” Harry insisted, “I’m not saying George did it on purpose Ron, that’s my point. It doesn’t necessarily mean the shops dark just because it can be tricky to navigate the minefield that is international wizarding export law.”
“Right!” a booming voice echoed across the room signaling that the meeting was about to start. “If you’ve quite finished with your tea party Auror Weasley?”
Draco turned back to Luna excitedly, pleased to see that Potter looked suitably stunned. “So why didn’t you reference Nachtnebel?”
Harry winced as he finally tore off his own stubby hangnail, sucking the resulting drop of blood as he turned back to their boss.
how he had imagined his first interaction with Potter in years to go and admittedly he had imagined it quite a few times.
“Oh Draco, you simply have to try this soup,” Meredith, Odette’s girlfriend jabbed her spoon in Draco’s direction, albeit at a rather odd angle that allowed half of the gratinée to fall to the table. “Oh shoot,” she giggled, unsuccessfully trying to dab at it with a napkin.
Harry glanced back up to see Terry Boot and his partner coming into the atrium and walking over to where Hermione had now lifted Memory Harry’s shirt up to reveal his wound.
“Here,” Odette nudged Malfoy as the lift doors dinged open to the communal floo area. “This is my card, It’s got my office number on there, if you ever want to grab a quick work lunch just let me know. My girlfriend Meredith is in the Magical Creature office and she bloody
“Fuck!” Malfoy swore, reaching out to bat a load of papers off its surface. He stared at them, breathing hard for a moment before his shoulders slumped dejectedly and he fell to his knees, gathering them all back up.
Half the Ministry were probably laughing their socks off at Draco’s expense right about now. This was one of the reasons he had allowed himself to take a few days off before returning back to work. He would just have to be composed in the wave of their jeers, scathing looks were nothing new anyway. Malfoys always knew how to keep their heads held high.
“Not too much Mags,” Draco shrugged ruefully, “So I was thinking quick style cassoulet tonight? I’ve got all the ingredients.”
“Hey mate,” Ron smiled, laughing as Hugo pushed his way onto his father’s lap and waved enthusiastically at Harry.
Draco frowned, picking at loose thread on the sofa. “Look Harry, I don’t know what you think you saw in those memories but if the reason you invited me over here tonight was for an easy lay, I can promise you I’m not it.”
Harry jumped back as Malfoy wheeled about, looking distraught before charging back into the living room.
“Reckon he’s being framed then?” Ron asked, squinting as the fish tank in the corner suddenly let out a burst of light. The squid had apparently inked itself and was also clearly a magical creature as the ink was bright pulsating neon.
than friends with him? He was pretty sure the other man had been flirting with Draco at certain points throughout the evening. However fear of completely embarrassing himself had prevented Draco from trying to clarify anything.
Luna giggled before reaching over to squeeze Harry’s hand, “Shall we share another scoop of chocolate fudge?”
“We order hot chocolate,” Harry laughed, “although I admit, sometimes it’s kind of fun to have ice cream whilst it’s freezing outside.”
“I had quite a lot of practical experience with cursed objects growing up,” Malfoy continued. Harry snorted grimly as he recalled the locket that had nearly killed Ron.
birthday party? Although I shouldn’t be surprised that a selfless saviour like you would spend it worrying over other people.”
Draco noticed that both Meredith and Matthew had gone quiet and were shooting each other a look. Evidently those who had not been in the U.K. at the time were not fully aware of the history. Draco took a steadying breath before rearranging his features into a dignified expression.
Harry felt Ron grab his arm in a steadying motion as they were both deposited onto a familiar black slate floor. A moment later, there was a loud ding as four sets of elevators in front of them opened their doors into the Ministry’s main atrium.
“He likes cooking,” Harry concluded lamely. Thinking of Malfoy dancing round the kitchen with Lisette, gathering different dried herbs from the wall and singing loudly and off key the words to some famous French ballad. “He can be quite funny,” Harry had noted that time had not dulled Malfoy’s sharp wit but rather refined it from something meant to pierce into a sense of humour that was really quite amusing, albeit self deprecating at times.
“No,” Harry tried not to pull a face, “It was the one about using magical creature skeletons to create objects of power or act as curse vessels. I remember it had a chapter in it about those wizards who made wands out of thestral bones and only certain people could see them.”
“Caroline Muddleford, the shadow minister for Magical Games and Sports?” Penny grinned as she poured herself a glass of Pimms from a pitcher filled with strawberries, mint and cucumber. “He’s her brother in law!”
Draco’s mouth fell open as he felt his balls tighten and a rushing sensation cresting in his cock. He bit down hard on the meat of Harry’s shoulder before coming all across the other man’s stomach, hot ropes spurting out in an almost painful orgasm.
“Yet when he realised the Ministry would not be able to continue employing him without this key evidence,” Pewterfoot gestured to the inevitability of the outcome.
“You may unhand me now,” Draco replied dryly as Harry glanced down in surprise at where his arms were still wrapped around Draco’s stomach, caramel skin contrasting white.
Harry’s mind flashed back to the image he’d had of Malfoy pruning roses in his garden wearing a large sun hat, only this time the other man was brandishing at incredibly phallic looking hose, turning the spray pressure up increasing his grip on the testi –
Draco froze in shock for a moment before gathering his wits back up. “What on Earth are you blathering about Potter?” He snapped, secretly trying to recall whether he had used the geranium or the lavender potion this morning. A receding hairline was probably one of Draco’s biggest insecurities, ever since some nasty wench in Diagon Alley had laughed that Draco was going to end up resembling the psychopath he had once served.
“I’ve got a croissant for you right here,” Harry mumbled, pressing his nose against the back of Draco’s neck.
Harry took a deep, steadying breath before getting up to follow him. He found the other man in his bedroom, sat cross legged on the floor with his back against the mattress, a balled up tissue in his hand.
“Good lord Potter be quiet,” Draco snapped feeling heat on his cheeks, the last bloody thing he needed right now was Harry publically showing concern for his bowel habits. “I would quite like to pretend for at least one day that you were not in my memories for a month and are blissfully ignorant of my toileting needs.”
“Hey guys, Draco, I mean, Malfoy came,” Potter announced nervously. Draco rolled his eyes before sitting down in a spare seat and turning to the witch beside him. “Good evening Granger,”
Draco sighed. “I know, it’s just he was always just this,” he flicked his eyes at Odette, “unattainable fantasy. It’s stupid but when we finally met again I wanted…I wanted it to be perfect. I would have worked my way up to a decent position and I’d be all shiny and impressive with perfect hair and…” Draco trailed off miserably, knowing how pathetic he sounded.
There were five other people in the lift, Malfoy had inadvertently missed most of the commuter rush by sticking around to spy on Harry. One of the other occupants was a woman with dyed blue hair in a very neat plait, she was wearing a hairclip with a mother of pearl rose on it and a smart suit. The only reason Harry had noticed her in particular was that she was edging closer to Malfoy, peering round at him.
Draco walked over beside Harry and peered out to see that several guests now had foot long tongues dyed in shades of raspberry blue.
“Get off me!” Draco bit out, wrenching himself free. “I assume you’ve got what you wanted out of this, or if you haven’t I really couldn’t give a rat’s arse you…” Draco gasped, “you kept saying you liked my hair you…”
“I am,” Harry replied, “so long as we’re both in this room, Pewterfoot and the French will be none the wiser and I promise I’ll keep my eyes open in there.”
When Harry answered the phone, Draco had to remind himself to breathe. Harry appeared on his screen with ruffled bed hair, beautifully naked chest, muscled shoulders, and that intense green gaze. Draco had the urge to kiss the oval scar left on his chest from the horcrux Harry had once told him about. When on a video call with anyone else, Draco would spend the time looking at his own reflection, rather than the other caller. There was no way he was going to tear his eyes away from Harry tonight, however. With a token glance to check he wasn’t visibly salivating, Draco’s eyes returned to Harry, and did not leave his face again.
“Good. I’ll see you in a fortnight.” Draco rubbed at the back of his aching neck, before rolling his head.
Harry eyed his reflection critically, ruffling his hopeless black curls and grimacing as they stubbornly refused to conform to any look other than dragged through a hedge backwards. The short back and sides did tidy it up somewhat, however he wasn’t sure the greying temples did anything for him. He huffed out a sigh, before turning to the side to appraise his outfit. He supposed he looked alright for his age. He kept fit from pick up quidditch games and glassblowing for his living, after being retired out of the aurors a decade ago for irreparable damage to his hip. Harry thought himself lucky for the striking green eyes, strong stubbled jaw and muscled physique, as it made up for the numerous scars and the slight limp he suffered when the weather was cold.
It made Harry uncomfortable when Draco mentioned him picking up men. So many times, he had come close to telling him that the only man he wanted was Draco, particularly if he’d been drinking. He enjoyed their text exchanges, which usually ranged between silly and sarcastic, but he loved it when Draco phoned him infinitely more. When they were on the phone, they dropped the bravado and sarcasm and Harry got to see the sweet and vulnerable side of Draco that he had inadvertently fallen for. Their late-night calls, which had lately become video calls, adding an extra layer of delight for Harry, covered all the serious topics from the past, present and future; things Harry never spoke to anyone else about. He suspected this was the same for Draco. With everything that had happened between them, having seen both the best and worst of each other, there was nothing left for them to hide behind. Harry often lay there in the middle of the night, having hushed conversations with Draco about his worries with James, his business, his bouts of insomnia and panic attacks, the PTSD which had faded significantly but he would never be completely free from. Some things Harry never talked about were relationships, loneliness, or his desire for more children. Those things he guarded more closely than anything else, as they were all wrapped up in his hope that Draco would one day come to love him back.
He took a big gulp of his drink then carried on, “When I woke up, the pain was like nothing you could even imagine, and unrelenting; worse than a crucio from Voldemort. They pumped me full of pain killers and I spent weeks in and out of consciousness. I was too out of it to even ask about James and Ted. When the pain had started to ease, they reduced the dose, which allowed me to think clearly again. That was the worst moment of my life. I was trapped, immobile in a hospital bed, unable to look after the kids, and with nothing but my own mind to torture myself with. I was awful to everyone who came into the room. My mind was replaying memories I’d repressed for years, plus I was sick with worry about the kids; I thought my body was ruined and I’d never be able to look after them. I was convinced Ginny would give Jamie up for adoption...”, at this, Harry broke down, tears streaming down his face. Draco pulled him in for a hug and sat quietly rubbing his back until he calmed down.
“There is that. However, we had it far harder and look at us now. I was a death eater and you literally died. Now we are both successful business owners, and still in possession of our own teeth no less. He will be fine in the end.”
“Are you sure it’s Ted that he’s interested in? It’s not only grandmothers that read Witch Weekly and have a hero fetish you know.” Draco gave Harry that smile that always made his stomach clench, the one where he poked his tongue out to the side a little bit and quirked an eyebrow.
Pansy sat back up and turned to face Draco. “Well tonight we are going to the muggle pub that Hermione’s Rex found, the usual gang”.
“Oh no, he’s at Andromeda’s with Ted. No doubt they’ll be going out to cause chaos somewhere.” Ginny handed him a pink drink in a margarita glass.
He felt his anxiety rise as he considered the trip ahead. Eighteen years since the war ended and Draco still avoided going home as much as possible. He knew things had moved on back in England, and ‘Death Eater Draco’ had faded into insignificance as the years passed, but memories of those first few months of relentless confrontations in wizarding Britain never did quite fade. When there was no sign of the animosity letting up, Draco and his mother had fled to muggle Paris, renouncing his incarcerated father, and changing their name to Narcissa’s maiden name Black. It was there that Draco studied fashion design, before accepting a coveted internship with Louis Vuitton. By the time he set up his own brand in New York, he was well known both for his boundary pushing muggle menswear, and his playboy ways, photographed with a different man on his arm each week. After ten years building his business, Draco’s partying had settled down somewhat; now he was more often found spending time enjoying meals with friends, who had quickly become his adopted muggle family.
“Hi.” Harry’s mouth quirked into a smile, his eyes crinkling. He was using the hushed night-time phone voice that Draco had come to know and love.
“I’d rather be single,” joined Harry, plonking some fresh spring rolls and peanut sauce on the table as he sat back down. “Remember when I was seeing Sam? I came this close to telling him about it all. He just couldn’t reconcile me with a man who would send his kid to boarding school. Glad I never did now.”
The two men moved to the comfort of the living room, with a nightcap of Ogden’s in hand. Harry groaned as he sat down on the sofa, rubbing his sore hip to try and ease the ache from a full day on his feet.
After sampling a blushing bride, monster-in-law and four groomsmen of the apocalypse, the three of them headed out to The Wander Inn.
Draco cleared his throat, having been momentarily distracted by the sight of Harry’s arse swaying in
Lunch at the burrow was a reasonably sedate affair, by Weasley standards. Harry showed up early to relieve Andromeda of his son, in a pair of faded jeans and a loose black band t-shirt he’d picked up at the Blossoms gig he’d taken the boys to last month. He made his way into the kitchen to give Molly a squeeze and offer his help and headed out into the garden when she declined his assistance. Although Molly had been disappointed that her daughter and Harry had never really made a go of their relationship, she still treated him like a son and he affectionately referred to her as “Mother Weasley”. James had barely grunted in his direction since he’d arrived, preferring to sit out on the grass with Ted, listening to what sounded like the Beastie Boys and messing around on their phones. Arthur and George had managed to set up a magic dead-zone surrounding the shed so Arthur could get his muggle contraptions to work, and the boys had soon cottoned on that they could use their tech in a certain spot. The others all got the same treatment when they turned up, many in sunglasses and groaning at loud noises. Teddy was polite enough to come over and shake Draco’s hand when he arrived with the girls, turquoise hair hanging down around his shoulders. James hung back behind, muttering a sullen “alright?” in Draco’s direction before he and Teddy decided to go for a fly. Harry, Draco and Ginny stood and watched them swoop around for a while, as Pansy went to get them all a drink.
Now though, having crested the precipice of turning thirty and settling into a mundane yet comfortingly familiar routine, Draco could honestly say he harboured no ill will towards the Boy who Lived and Lived Again.
“I didn’t tell her about the case,” Harry garbled, “she guessed mostly, I was just telling her about albatrosses and there were also thestral skeletons and…” Harry’s voice lowered to nothing as he nervously trailed his fingertips through the soot. He really needed to get Kreacher to help him sweep out his fireplace sometime.
Hermione had suggested perhaps it was miffed that Harry didn’t use it very often. Admittedly, he had even bought a small blue kettle to keep in the living room along with a Tupperware of tea bags so as to avoid the cold, damp kitchen.
“It’s not that,” Harry protested, “I actually find it kind of relaxing in there.” He looked up to see Ron eyeing him with a peculiarly disturbed expression.
“Harry, have you not checked you postbox recently?” she tipped her head again, jangling the daisy chain earrings she was wearing.
The pub was busy, as was expected for a Friday night in the summer and an extension charm had allowed the main seating area to spread out into a perfectly manicured beer garden. It was still bathed in the warm glow of the sun and there were multicoloured hanging baskets suspended in the air, attracting the attentions of plump bumblebees and the odd butterfly.
The two of them were dismissed, Harry pausing as he stood in the doorway. He glanced back to see Pewterfoot sprinkling some large squirming grub like creatures into the tank, each one plopping into the now murky depths before a flash of white tentacles grabbed them.
,” Draco huffed, the name felt sort of tingly on his tongue, almost like it was forbidden or something he wasn’t allowed to use, which was ridiculous. It wasn’t like the name was the sole property of only Harry’s nearest and dearest, half the wizards and witches on the street addressed the chosen one by his first name.
“Swear that merperson’s enchanted or something,” Ron muttered as he had his customary glare off with a rather vicious looking statue in the middle of a modest lily pond. “Wherever I’m standing in this place it always seems to be shooting daggers at me.”
“Yeah, apparently he was a bit surprised because you were sitting with Draco Malfoy?” Terry asked, his eyes flashing curiously as he took a sip of his tea.
“That sentence implies you’re not now,” Draco smirked with a quick flick of his eyes at Harry’s hair. Harry laughed, surely if Draco was up for teasing him then that was a good sign?
“I doubt anybody would let you screw them in that outfit,” Draco smirked, looking Harry up and down. The other man had certainly kept his promise, although his baggy underwear wasn’t currently on display.
Harry stared hard at the witch for a moment before following Malfoy up the stairs. The other man looked around before spotting a hanging cauldron sign above some of the bookshelves.
“Mon dieu!” Magalie cried as she appeared on the sofa, glass of wine already in hand. Her other hand was clutching at her chest and her eyes fixed on the screen. Harry looked to see what the fuss was about. One of the main characters, Francis Featherhorn, was, for some inexplicable reason, already topless and soaking wet. Apparently in the first minute of the episode he had managed to dive off a bridge so as to rescue Madeline Mosspebble from a river that really looked far too large and ferocious to be existing in the quiet corner of Berkshire where the soap was set.
“You plan on speaking to him again then?” Luna asked, cocking her head with interest as the crying behind them finally stopped.
“Good evening Draco,” she smiled back. “Maybe in our thirties we could stretch to using first names?”
“Oh, Michael was there?” Harry asked, he hadn’t seen the other man, but then again he wasn’t totally sure he would have recognised him.
“Draco Malfoy, threatening skinny dipping at a family friendly party,” Harry gave him a wicked grin.
“Oh Merlin,” Harry sighed, before glancing around the room. “Okay, um, okay.” He picked up his spoon before beginning to tap a beat against the wooden table, nodding his head along with it.
Bill Weasley let out a triumphant laugh as Draco continued to endeavour to explain the implementation of strata theory in practical curse breaking in his best French. At one point Harry drifted over, passing Draco a glass of cold lemonade before grinning at them all and slinking away again without notice.
Of course Draco knew they weren’t real. That was the point of these charms. You didn’t buy them if you already actually
“Quite alright,” Draco nodded primly, “I was just enjoying a lovely conversation with your brass knocker.”
Eventually, however, Malfoy did stir from his hunched over position. He reached his hands up towards the ceiling before stretching his back from side to side. Harry winced in sympathy as there was a loud crack. He hated the paper pushing aspect to working at the Ministry and couldn’t imagine a job where you didn’t at least get to leave your desk for a good portion of the day.
“Yeah,” Harry laughed, nudging a patch of daisies on the lawn with his toe, “I’m a wizard of specific tastes.”
“We don’t have to,” Harry shook his head, “I know it’s a bit weird, but I spent all this time with her but never got to actually say anything.”
“Peachy,” Draco coughed, blinking water from his eyes and attempting to slick back the blond hair that had stuck to his face.
The Ministry, for all its layers of protective charm work seemed to absorb whatever weather was going on outside and amplify it. Upon arriving in the atrium, the lift doors dinged open to a collective groan as the assembled witches and wizards were met with a wall of oppressive humidity.
When Draco was ready, Harry lined himself up and slowly inched inside. Draco clenched his jaw at the intrusion, it hurt and he had to ask the other man to stop a few times which Harry readily did.
!” Luna exclaimed. “I actually only contributed to that book, it was edited in full by Enid Monkton.”
Harry recognised a large cream coloured envelope as having Narcissa’s handwriting on the front. He settled down in the nearby armchair and watched lazily as Malfoy opened the letter, which turned out to be a card. There was a print of an oil painting on the front depicting a fancy looking soldier on a white horse. The soldier was wearing a huge bear skin hat and brandishing a curved sword, Harry supposed he was some sort of historical cavalry officer.
Harry could have kicked himself. “I know it’s fucked up,” he said, “that I know stuff about you now that you didn’t share willingly but please, give me a chance to share some stuff back. I’ll tell you whatever you want to know about me – I swear it.”
can buy her drinks then!” Seamus grinned before ambling over to the bar. Everyone seemed to be in good spirits that evening and much was being made of Olivia Sheerwickle’s recent transfer to Puddlemere United. Sadly, Ginny was absent so was unable to give her professional opinion.
“Actually he might be coming to the pub on Friday, you know, if you wanted to drop by. A few of us tend to turn up and there’s a quiz this week, our team always rakes it in because we’ve got Hermione and Luna’s still in the country so –“ Potter trailed off as Draco turned around slowly and fixed him with a pointed gaze. “Um, do they not have the book then?” Potter looked almost nervous, twiddling his wand between his fingers.
“It’s blooming ridiculous,” Ron called over, looking sombre, “honestly we all live in different counties but somehow the blighters just keep finding us!”
Draco choked noisily before looking up to see Luna Lovegood staring serenely at him from next to Potter. Potter himself had gone a peculiar shade of red as if he was trying not to laugh, the bastard.
“I can assure you I did not run headfirst towards an irate bull,” Harry huffed. “I was attempting to push Dankworth out the way of his own ineptitude.”
“Do it now,” Draco hiccoughed, brushing his hair back and looking delighted. “Rap something for me now.”
“They aren’t half bad to look at though,” Theresa interjected. “I heard they’re thinking of doing a charity calendar at some point.”
“Not this Friday,” Harry shook his head. It was true, everyone had agreed that they would save the drinking for the party the next day. Even so, Harry would have still chosen to hang out with Draco if the other man was giving him a chance.
“Yes,” Draco agreed, looking down at the cream coloured carpet and wondering if it was wise to try and eat their burgers in there.
Draco sat nervously across from Bill Weasley. The tall, red haired man had sent Draco an owl asking if he wanted to meet up for a pint after work to chat a bit more about curse breaking.
Harry narrowed his eyes, he guessed Featherhorn was attractive enough, unshaven, smooth dark skin, piercing blue eyes and a broad build. He certainly wasn’t Harry’s type though and quite frankly he couldn’t see what the fuss was about. Maybe Malfoy had indulged in a little too much of his goblin wine?
Draco groaned as he pushed away the remnants of his baguette and rested his head in his hands. He had barely been able to sleep for two nights now whilst making a mental catalogue of everything Potter could have potentially seen. It had been nearly a month of memories, Draco must have scratched his bum at some point or popped a pimple. He knew for sure he had gotten a little gassy after devouring a pot of chili and then attempting some yoga poses to help with his heartburn.
“Aren’t you his partner?” Ginny asked, pointing to the two bottles of Ogdens in front of Ron with a raised eyebrow.
“Yeah, course,” Ron nodded but still looked slightly uncomfortable. “I mean, I haven’t seen what you’ve seen, so my last recollections of Malfoy aren’t exactly favourable but I trust your judgment. If you say he’s alright now, then he’s alright.”
“No, want to hear you,” Harry rasped, pinching Draco’s poor, abused nipple between his fingers before waggling his tongue against it once more. Draco let out little hiccoughing whines as he grabbed Harry’s head to balance himself, his hips bouncing of their own accord. It was too much but at the same time it was nowhere near enough.
“Oi, Louis – watch where you’re going!” Harry shouted over at an apologetic looking adolescent with golden hair and freckles.
“Oh yes,” Bill nodded, “Only this was a particularly tricky situation as the witch who had put on the thimble also picked up a needle containing the Ariadne curse, they were from the same set you see.”
Draco glared daggers at Harry, doing little to deter the happy grin spreading across the other man’s handsome face. “I bet you organised that on purpose Potter, a birthday present to yourself – a chance to play the hero again.”
“Draco! We’re over here!” Potter called from a large table at the far end of the garden, before he came marching over with a pint of beer in his hand. His eyes immediately slid up and down the length of Draco’s body and Draco felt inordinately pleased he had convinced himself to don the jeans after all.
For starters, in his daydreams Draco was always impeccably dressed whilst Potter would inevitably look a shambles. Draco tensed as Potter’s eyes raked over his appearance. Draco had quite forgotten to do his shirt and waistcoat back up and he knew he must look a complete mess with a flushed face and sweaty hair stuck up at all angles.
Now Harry was feeling completely lost, his uniform always felt very comfortable, in fact he had only replaced the trousers a few months earlier after his previous pair got torn up by a nesting manticore.
“No thanks,” Harry replied, swiftly heading towards the kettle that was now looking a little forlorn at the end of the table, “Prefer a cup of tea in the afternoon.”
Draco squeaked as he and Harry jumped apart, the other man stumbling backwards and ending up on the bed as Ron Weasley stood in the doorway with eyes as big as dinner plates.
“Actually,” Pewterfoot huffed, “the packages come from a Charms shop that, according to Laurent, is currently under investigation for exporting materials that are internationally, but not locally, contraband.”
“I didn’t know you took six Newts,” Harry commented, watching miserably as Draco shuffled the pile before turning to grab his briefcase and glancing at the clock. “How the hell did you do that without even going back to Hogwarts?”
Potter and Weasley must have laughed themselves silly as Draco tried to levitate a host of mirrors at the right angle so as to get a good look at the back of his head.
“Ron,” Harry greeted through gritted teeth. Penny was smiling as she gazed up at Harry. She was quite short, even with her woven wedge sandals. Her usually up hair was down in a sleek black mane and she was wearing a pretty, plum coloured lipstick.
“Oh yes!” Luna perked up, accidentally sending her umbrella skittering off towards Neville where it submerged itself in his pint. “There are these parasitic worms that infest tuber roots and when boiled –“
Half an hour later another owl bearing the Gringotts’ seal, this time a Greater Sooty, came hurtling through the room before dropping a heavy A4 brown envelope in front of Draco.
“I mean take last week’s match against the Frankfurt Falken, Mila Muller was able to pull off that feint twice –
He tipped a cup shaped leaf hanging over a small clear pool, creating a trickle of dew. The trickle was captured inside the vial which he quickly plugged and tucked away. Although the waterfall was mesmerizing he felt like it might become harder to leave the longer he stared into it’s clear flow.
Draco was beginning to get used to the soggy leaf stuck on the inside of his cheek. At first it bugged the hell out of him and during transfigurations he nearly spat it out while answering a question for the class. Not to mention the wicked lisp.
Head in hands, he sighed, cursing himself. “Just get through this month,”Draco muttered, “and then it’ll be okay.” He tried to convince himself of it. Just until he could get his animagus. Then he’d be free to do what he wanted, go where he wanted, put his past behind him if only for a while.
He ended the letter by assuring his mother that he was quite well now and would love her to send a new bottle of his favourite cologne over from Paris when she had the time.
“Potter,” Draco began, summoning his reserves of fortitude, “did you just try to invite me to the pub?”
Harry followed Ron down one of the longer corridors until emerging into a small manicured atrium around which several department heads’ offices were located.
“This is potions theory,” Winshaw pulled a face as he tugged the book out of the bag. “You’re a paper pusher, what the hell do you need a text on advanced potions theory for?”
Harry sighed, “Wait, is this coming from Molly? Because I’m single over thirty and live in - ” Harry cleared his throat to affect his best Molly Weasley impression, “that big old rattling house all by myself.”
“Blimey,” Ron sighed, rubbing his hand down his face. “I can definitely think of a few places I’d rather be at nine am on a Wednesday morning than inside the ferret’s head.”
“Promise,” Harry grinned, leaning over to give Draco a kiss and accidentally knocking into someone. “Oh shit – sorry!”
“Thistlebarrow, the one who wrote about thestral bones, also proposed that the silver of occamy eggs could be used to enhance curses,” Malfoy informed them, pretty sure he had read that in a very obscure journal.
“So what happened then?” Ron asked, “After I left you to it? Please tell me Mione and I don’t need to seal up that room permanently.”
“Could be the blood of innocent victims,” Harry shrugged defeatedly, turning round to clock the source of the noise.
Draco sat up as Harry busied himself with the pot of lube, casting cleaning and protection spells on them both. Draco manoeuvred back up the bed and laid down against the pillow where he figured it would be more comfortable, his erection had wilted slightly with nerves.
Draco smiled, feeling very pleased with himself, a part of him was strangely smug that he got to keep Harry to himself for a bit longer.
Harry stood stunned for a moment before darting forwards as if to try and help the other man up. Malfoy blinked in shock as he registered his new position on the tiles before letting out an undignified snort of laughter.
Malfoy gave a disapproving sniff as he finished with the report and slid it neatly into one of the filing trays.
“Did you really do anything that awful?” Odette asked, “I mean, unless it’s illegal, the world’s pretty tolerant of anything and everything nowadays.”
“Ron and Hermione’s house is very nice isn’t it?” Penny continued. “I’ve never been here before, it was great of Ron to invite the whole department.”
“Thank you Luna,” Harry exclaimed, throwing his hands up, “I – wait, what?” he turned to see the blonde girl grinning as the rest of the circle dissolved into laughter. Even Hermione appeared to be stifling a smile.
“I know right?” Harry bounced up on his tiptoes, looking inexplicably pleased. Next, Harry led Draco through into a kitchen whose size made Draco’s look like a broom cupboard. Draco held his breath as he took in the expanse of work surfaces, fashioned from ancient English oak, the cabinets were clearly enchanted elm and Draco could hear their whispers as he passed by, begging him to fill them with goods.
“Right,” Harry agreed, frowning as they followed Malfoy into a cramped kitchen. The other man had changed out of his work clothes and was now wearing a pale cashmere sweater and black trousers, it was almost casual and only enhanced Harry’s sense that they were intruding somewhere they shouldn’t be.
“I bet,” Malfoy huffed, “Potter could have waltzed up to McGonagall aged eighteen and announced he wanted to become the new advanced potions professor and she would have rolled out the red carpet.”
Draco walked into the office to find Marlene sat up on her desk chatting with one of the interns. He pointedly ignored her, as he had done ever since the unfortunate run in with her oaf of a boyfriend a few weeks prior.
"It is your fault," Pansy hissed, "And you will fucking pay for it in one way or the other. But you will never get the chance to hurt him again."
"Did Minerva give you your timetable?" he asked then and Draco was stunned at this horrible attempt at conversation.
The god of love says and shoves the other god from the tower. The god of friendship yelps and sits down at the other side with the god of happiness between them, who looks very uncomfortable.
"'alfoy?" Ron asks and Harry grunts affirmatively. Ron shakes his head and loads his plate with more food.
And Draco found himself in a conflict. On one side, he enjoyed his new friendship with Harry very much. They ate and talked, walked to class together, play chess, and at night they would sneak into the kitchen and devour whatever the elves presented them. He liked it. It was easy and all he wished for eight years ago. But now he was older. He found himself depressed when he thought about their friendship after Hogwarts. He came quickly to the conclusion, that friendship alone wasn't enough. He wanted more from Harry.
"You're welcome," Harold said before adding, "You wouldn't mind a second, would you? A dance, that is."
the god of death says, almost amused and the god of happiness musters him. His colleague was a feisty one and he never wanted to fight with him. He kept his thoughts about him to himself and the god of death appreciated the silence.
"I am perfectly capable of doing my research without Potter, thank you very much for your unnecessary concern," Draco says, without looking up from his book. The other student growls something
"Harry, I showed you my love every day. I take you out to lunch, meet up with your family and friends, even if they hate me and clearly want me gone. I write you silly letters and buy you your favorite chocolate every Saturday. I let you ramble about everything and nothing, I give you the affection you ask for, even if I don't know how to ask or do it. You know all about me and you knew about my struggles with intimacy, Harry. You knew how my parents raised me, what they expected from me, how I grew up, how hard it was for me to come out. You knew all of this and despite that, you... you want to tell me, I don't love you enough? I don't show enough?" Draco demanded and this time Harry was shellshocked. Had he been too fixated on the physical part and the three words? But Draco didn't leave him waiting.
"Oh, and I think he's pretty confident in his everyday life. Or sure of himself. He pretty much admitted that he was selfish for trying to stay in my memory, even if he didn't tell me, who he is," he says and Hermione writes everything down. She puts the pencil back in her mouth and chews on the top of it. Harry catches Ron looking at her softly and briefly wonders, why he hasn't asked her out yet. He nudges Ron with his elbow and Ron hisses in confusion.
He says and that calms them down. The conflict is not solved, but for now, they could coexist. He takes them both by the hand and leads them to the edge of the tower and sits down with both of them. The god of love looks still pretty angry, but he's willing to put it aside. The god of happiness is proud and looks expectantly at the god of friendship. He just looks at their intervened hands and beams.
"Ow," he growls and glares at Harry, "it's true, isn't it though? It could be the slimy ferret confessing his love to you!" And Harry has to slam his head on the table at the absurdity of it all. He looks at Ron expressly.
"And I spoke to Ron," Harry added almost as an afterthought, and Draco looked at him in bewilderment, "He will never speak to you like that again. I made him swear on his mother." Because he knew, this was important to Draco. Malfoy's were prideful people and Draco had to swallow his for Harry far too often. It was time to give him his confidence and snark back.
So he tries to calm him down and distract him. He convinced Madam Hooch to let him and Draco fly and they went over the Black Lake and over some parts of the Forbidden Forest.
"I will show you my most recent hobby, babe," Harry said and Draco tried really hard to listen, but it was difficult with Harry's cock down his throat, "and I might need your help handling it," he added and paused to look Draco in the eyes. He shuddered, desire setting his nerves on fire.
"Good morning, Professor McGonagall," came a chorus on the left, and in the middle of the crowd, he stood. Harry Potter.
She says and hands him his new list. He pretends to be nonchalant about it, but he can't wait to open it.
. But you suppose, you can't fault him for trying to stay alive. You can talk to him now, every time you like. Your cheeks pink a bit.
"Maybe you can tell my parents?" Malfoy asked quietly as if it was too much to ask. It probably was, but he found himself agreeing anyway.
His friends (the real ones) observed his change of behavior with worry. Draco wasn't a very outgoing person, he preferred private settings and conversation over a nice cup of tea or dinner with wine to the Leakey, but now he was basically a hermit. He refused to set foot outside the Manor and no threats, dares or magic could convince him otherwise. They were forced to visit him at home if they wished to see him. And without their insistence, Draco might have lost his mind.
"I'm in love," he declares and Severus splutters. Draco? A barely fourteen-year-old boy in love? Draco scowls at his godfather's reaction.
"And you really can't help me?" he asks, glancing between his best friends back and forth and Ron has the nerve to look
"Ah, yes, I forgot. The age, you see," McGonagall muses and you hurry to assure her of her youth. She smiles like she finds you charming and you consider your job done.
Potter. He never spoke to them, just tailing after them, buying what he needed, but apart from that, he didn't really do anything. The other Slytherins looked at him with sympathy, but Draco ignored them all. They weren't really sincere, because just a week before they cursed him to be the reason the first years were scarred to be sorted into Slytherin. Draco found that ridiculous. He wasn't in Hogwarts to harm first years and he doubted, that those children really thought that. Slytherin was always viewed to be the
"I asked," and now she's glaring, "if you were available for a visit in Muggle London with the third years. Harry volunteered to escort." You nod hastily and hold out your hand for Potter to shake.
- whatever he happened to take his possessive love out on. And Draco never once complained about Harry's love. It was the most beautiful thing he ever experienced and he couldn't imagine waking up without Harry there to kiss and touch. If he had to choose between his friends or Harry, his parents or Harry, his job or Harry, his possessions or Harry, then the answer would always be the same. Harry was his reason to breathe, Harry's happiness was Draco's only concern.
"You better," she growled and stepped aside to let him in. "I'll take Blaise or he will really cut your dick off."
"What's his problem?" Harry asks, with a full mouth, and Hermione clicks her tongue and admonishes him to
"There he is. Wasn't it nice of him to greet me when I came back? I was almost moved to tears," Potter said, continuing to stroke Malfoy's head. Said man didn't move, clutching his sweater in his hands.
"So I've heard what you did," you say, rather conversationally and he spares you a look, before turning to the Sorting again.
The conversation with Severus was eye-opening. Maybe that was the reason, Harry ignored Draco? Because he was scared, what the others would think? Or maybe he was also pressured to be someone he was not. Draco tries not to think about it too much, as he prepares his notes and homework for the next class. For the time being, he holds his feelings and his new skill for himself.
"Be careful with that, alright? It's very important," he said to her and she nudged his hand, demanding more attention. Draco laughed and readily gave it to her. After some more petting, she hooted softly and got ready to take off. He watched her fly and hurried back to Hogwarts. He had to see Harry's face when he opened and read his letter. Blaise frowned a little as Draco joined him at the table, clearly out of breath.
"Hey," he begins, and Draco watches him silently, telling him to go on, "I've met Potter today." And Draco goes stiff, but he's still listening, so Blaise hurries to explain.
In second year, Harry had surprised Hogwarts with his Parseltongue. Draco had been impressed. If that wasn't a sign for Harry to join Draco in Slytherin, then what else was? But Harry had been nervous about it and had never spoken to snakes in public again. Draco was disappointed. He found that ability quite cool. Maybe Harry needed someone to talk with? Snakes weren't a delightful company, after all, they would only know so much, but with Draco, Harry could converse. So Draco dedicated himself to learn the difficult language and after he found, that he was fluent enough, he sought out Harry again. But the latter fled every time Draco tried to speak with him. The Slytherin was distressed.
"Well," Draco said, "Ronald Weasley is a pleasant man." Just to annoy Mother a bit. And judging from the frown on her face, it was working.
There he stood, wiping his sweaty hands on his trousers awkwardly, a habit he had when he was nervous. Draco simply watched him, not gracing him with any kind of acknowledgment and Harry hunched his shoulders, clearly uncomfortable.
"The follow me please," McGonagall says and leads him to the Headmasters office. Or Headmistress now, he supposed. McGonagall was officially appointed to her new duty and Draco found himself scowling at the thought of another Gryffindor Headmaster. He follows her into the room and waits patiently for her to settle. If he learned something in the lessons his father put him through, then that manners are often the key to a successful deal. She gestures him to sit and he follows that invitation without hesitation.
Dean’s girlfriend Yasmin, who apparently had been designated the team’s scribe upon having the neatest handwriting, quickly wrote the answer down as Hermione cast a muffling charm over their table.
“Jesus, Malfoy,” Harry croaked, shifting uncomfortably on his seat. He wanted to say something humorous to break the weird tension in the room, like ‘
“About as long as we have,” Harry muttered, bringing his hand up to chew distractedly at a smarting hangnail.
“It’s tie dye and still has stains on from where Teddy threw up on me when he was a baby,” Harry replied, relishing how amused Draco looked.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, swallowing dryly. He had never given much thought to who Draco Malfoy would end up with. There had been some rumours before the war about pureblood arrangements but that had all fallen apart. The woman seemed so different to Malfoy, his polar opposite in nearly every way, but then again, what did Harry really know about this Malfoy?
“Yeah,” Harry sighed, although he was still smiling. He thought about where Malfoy might be in a month’s time. Pewterfoot had heavily implied that Malfoy’s Ministry pay was suspended whilst the investigation was ongoing. Harry couldn’t help but wonder if this meant the other man wouldn’t be able to get his monthly package of Pop Up Pals.
Both his and Ron’s robes were hanging open and dripping on the cobblestones. There was also a slightly alarming red stain across Harry’s front where he knew he had been nicked by the bull’s horns. Any minute now, if he remembered correctly…
“Who are you hiding from?” Harry frowned as the two of them peered around the corner together. Harry let out a surprised noise as he recognized himself stood about six feet away with his head tipped back and laughing. Memory Harry’s boots were caked with mud and Harry remembered this was the day he and Ron had chased the petty crook Fergus Dankworth through a field full of cows in Devon.
He stopped the spell at around quarter past nine in the evening, which tended to be the time that Malfoy cast a relaxation charm and got into bed. Relaxation charms hadn’t been too uncommon at Hogwarts, they created a localized ambience such as birdsong or the sounds of rain. You could also have images or different coloured lights projected on the walls around you. Harry had once pulled back Dean Thomas’ curtain to find a mesmerising carousel of swooping birds.
He glared back at them and their group. Draco didn’t need to check his bag to know his textbook wasn’t there. He started to see other students taking notice of the standoff. Arguing or trying to get the book back was certainly going to draw a crowd.
“Have a seat.” Hermione offered him the chair next to hers. She definitely wasn’t happy to see him but that was expected. His apology seemed to have created some small peace.
Hope y'all enjoy the chapter <3. Lemme know what you think in the comments! Also has anybody read a court of thorns and roses because IT'S SO GOOD AND V SPICY definitely recommend.
Draco couldn’t understand why on earth Granger would be willing to tutor him. He’d tormented her for so many years. She gave him a shocking, friendly look.
Draco swallowed his dread and nodded in agreement. “May I be excused, Professor?” He asked, eager to escape.
“I.. erm.. I was looking for the new Weasley product. I’m a big fan. Thought Filch might have it,” he lied sheepishly. McGonagall was not convinced. She peered at him through her spectacles, obviously confused. Filch seemed to buy his answer though.
“Why let them keep even more tabs on me? You know they have aurors watching my family every waking moment.”
He looked back towards the storage room on the way out and saw the brief outline of a witch, camouflaged into the background, sneaking away.
He ignored the pair, flipping through the rest of the book then leaning back into the couch wracking his brain. What blasted wizard came up with this? I mean dew that hasn’t been stepped on in seven days, seriously?!
He nearly spat out his sausage. Blaise started choking on his earl grey. Tea splattered, staining the table cloth.
“Damned poltergeist always mucking up the corridors,” Filch cursed, paying little attention to Pansy.
“Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, I’m studying with Malfoy. McGonagall paired us for a… project.” Hermione informed. Draco was thankful she’d taken mercy on him and told them that white lie. He told her as much, making eye contact and mouthing a quick ‘thanks’.
He set down his wand shakily and decided to study for Transfigurations. He read half a chapter before he was interrupted.
Snape’s replacement sighed, something like this happened nearly every class now, “Can whoever took Mr Malfoy’s chair please return it, thank you.”
“So I asked around and Nott seemed to think that Filch’s office could have a death’s head hawk moth.” Blaise informed, “Said they’re sometimes used in dangerous potions or something like that.”
“Pretty kitty… pretty kitty…” Ms Norris was a cat only Filch could love. After stalking them through the halls for six years, Draco had no love for that scrappy cat.
Draco contemplated responding. It would be so easy to prod back at him and escalate things. He couldn’t risk anymore trouble by starting a fight with Potter. He sighed. “Yeah, me, Pansy and Blaise are grabbing butterbeers at the Hog’s Head.”
The day continued with a jelly filled scone from the kitchens. He ate alone except for a few house elves scurrying in and out carrying teetering platters. Draco cracked open his tremendously heavy transfiguration textbook. His adventure in the forbidden forest left him too tired last night to prepare for tomorrow’s summative. Professor McGonagall’s wasn’t one for empty threats. Draco believed she would seriously assign him a study partner, a terrifying prospect.
He wondered what it must be like to see the entire world from above, riding the currents from one city to another. Then to huddle up together in a fluffy ball of wings and beaks at the end of a long day. ‘The freedom of it all,’ he thought.
Draco disappeared into the bedroom. He placed the chrysalis inside a crystal vial on his windowsill. He climbed under the bed covers still fully clothed. “Amato animo animato animagus.” Fatigue overwhelmed him. He yawned and drifted off faster than he had in many years.
The whiteout slowly blotted with color and changed into a dreary oh-so-familiar dining room. A long table was covered by a green tablecloth with golden serpentine embroidery. A woman with wavy blonde hair levitated above the table, like a stuck pig ready to be eaten as the main course. A massive green snake wove it’s way through the chairs and feet tasting the air with it’s tongue. Outside the gothic windows, rain poured and lightning roared. One bolt caused the fixtures on the ceiling to shake.
“That will be all for today, I expect a 3 foot essay covering human transfiguration on my desk within the fortnight,” Professor McGonagall reminded them.
Draco slid the leaf into his mouth, instantly tasting bitter and sour combined. He pushed the leaf into his cheek like a chipmunk trying not to gag or retch.
They put their heads down, working on the essays. Draco could barely think. How bizarre it was to sit with his former enemies and study together. He stalled out after the first paragraph. The quill, almost dripping with ink, waited for him to start again.
He enjoyed teasing her. They dated on and off a few years back but he never felt the same for her as she did for him. Pansy was much more like a sister. His parents still adored her and seemed to expect that they would end up together. Every time he returned to the manor they never forgot to ask about their status.
Hermione tried to diffuse the tension adding, “Really? The butterbeers at the Three Broomsticks are loads better!”
This hidden part of the forest seemed insignificant compared to the mounting irritation over a detention with Potter or the shock of finding the deceased unicorn in a pool of silver blood.
The pair fell into another fit of laughter at him. Blaise almost fell off the couch and Pansy clutched her stomach.
“Why is everything so loud? Why can’t I remember doing this? What the hell is the incantation for pawn to queen transformations?!”
“Blimey, I don’t know what’s worse? Turning into a pig or having my professors come fix my snout!” Weasley snickered.
Draco paused behind the last pillar, checking for watching eyes. He retrieved his wand and cast a disillusionment charm to render himself invisible for the time being. It wasn’t the strongest charm he’d cast but it would have to make do.
“Detention! Detention for a month! Students thieving in the castle, unacceptable!” Filch roared. Ms Norris glared at Draco with her beady eyes.
“Draco, if you should have interest, or a need for assistance in transfigurations studies, you need only ask.”
“Aren’t you going to do something about it?” Pansy asked, confused. A year ago, Draco would have confronted them, likely with an insult or quip.
Blaise tried to flip pages but Pansy swatted it out of his hand. “Put that away,” she hissed. Pansy folded it and tucked it under a half-full china teapot. “Good riddance.”
Draco couldn’t imagine anyone, Neville included, out of their mind enough to snack on those murderous ear-splitting buggers.
“And how is Mrs Zabini? You’ll have to give her my best wishes.” Mrs Zabini was infamous for her many failed marriages and inherited wealth.
“You could tell Filch about Peeves then stand guard outside the storage room while I give Peeves the goods,” Blaise offered, growing more excited by the second.
“Rosie are you coming? I really want to get there early this time.” A classmate asked while waiting by the doors.
This time Draco knew that he wasn’t alone. He also knew his disillusionment charm had worn off. He hid behind a thick oak trunk.
Potter gave him a curious look, like he was deciphering a puzzle. Malfoy returned it. They hadn’t spoken since the Room of Requirement, which felt like a lifetime ago.
“Stay still,” he told Pansy, “I’ll cast a disillusionment charm on you, just make sure they don’t take back the chrysalis.” He cast the charm and she sunk into the background becoming a part of the dark storage room.
A couple years ago, curiosity would have overcome him and he’d have followed Potter. Now, he couldn’t afford to waste time and be caught past curfew. Besides, Potter’s always suspicious behaviour wasn’t anything new.
“Old suck up,” he muttered, plopping down on the couch beside Pansy. He was sipping a cup of earl grey that wafted through the air.
Granger dropped her bag with a thud back down in her seat. The class emptied leaving the professor, Draco and Hermione.
“Blimey,” Blaise said, “ what happened mate?” Emerald green lanterns casted a eerily glow over the dark common room. It was empty except for Draco, his friends and two first years together on the sofas.
After several moments of awkward silence, Snape’s replacement arrived, a forgettable witch with a mousy voice.
It took both of them a few moments to land on an offending column. A picture of his father in signature prisoner’s robes was juxtaposed with the image of him in the Malfoy manor gardens with a glass of liquor. “Death Eaters running free? Lucius Malfoy enjoys orchards at luxurious Malfoy Mansion”. Draco knew that his father was day-drunk and probably hadn’t left the manor in weeks, months even. Not that it mattered where you were, when you were drinking that much. He couldn’t help the flush in his cheeks. There was no hiding it on his gaunt skin, so he ducked his head.
If only she knew that he was attempting one of the most difficult known tasks in the field of transfiguration this very second.
The door slammed open. Filch barged in carrying the lantern in one hand and Ms Filch pressed to his chest in the other. Her ears were laid back and a menacing snarl came from between her bared fangs.
The towering trees groaned as they swayed over the two boys walking through the mist covered underbrush.
This sequestered alcove tucked away in the Slytherin dungeons made the perfect hideaway, even though the stony walls were crumbling in places and the formerly pristine carpets and house banners have the occasional burn mark. The remnants of hard fought duels.
Draco slunk off to the Slytherin dungeon, avoiding the crowds. He’d promised himself he’d never repeat those words again. He thought he was better than the other Slytherins. In the end, he hadn’t changed at all. Hopeless.
“Dinner, Nagini,” a voice whispered. He could hear it as though the man was right behind him, saying it into his year.
The corridors were almost silent except for one or two residual voices echoing down the dusty stone corridor. A breeze whipped through carrying lost papers and ochre leaves.
“If you have finished the test you may return your paper to me and leave for your next class,” Professor McGonagall told them.
“It was only natural, as a student of the transformative arts, to become an animagus. Albus taught me as an extracurricular study,” The professor paused introspective. “In addition to that there is a certain joy in taking up a new form that only animagi truly experience. Unlike the use of polyjuice potion or lycanthropy, a witch or wizard’s animal form is an extension of their being, a reflection of them. ”
Also after the next chapter there's gonna be a two week hiatus. I'm canoe tripping and won't have any form of cellular/wifi to update.
“Oh all right, but if anyone asks it wasn’t me that told you. Slytherin honor you know. Apparently when she tried to transform, only her face turned into a pig. McGonagall and Pomfrey fixed her up,” Draco answered in a low voice, leaning in.
He let out a yawn. Blaise must’ve left for continental breakfast in the Great hall. His blankets were thrown haphazardly on the empty bed.
His eyes scanned the room, looking for sympathy perhaps. Draco could only see disgust and anger. Only Potter showed any different, something like pity or sadness.
“Speaking of…”Pansy stuck a hand into her robe pocket, pulling out the dark brown chrysalis with gentle hands, “here we are, one death’s head hawk moth chrysalis.”
His eagle owl was a bit vicious and would take your finger off if you got a bit too close but was always on time so he couldn’t complain too much.
“Yes, I’ve read about it quite a bit, it’s an extensive process. Quite tricky too. Takes at least a month and the consequences for a failed transformation can be awful.” Hermione of course knew plenty about the subject.
“At least the first transformation is the worst, it’s supposed to become natural after,” Granger added. She said it like a reassurance.
“ Nobody will hire a Hogwarts-dropout death eater and you very well can’t stay here,” father told him before he flooed to Kings Crossing station earlier that year. The shame and anger in his father’s eyes told Draco everything he needed to know. He was no longer welcome at the Malfoy manor. The logical side of his brain told him that his parents were just frustrated about the strict rules imposed on them by the post-war peace agreement on top of the stigma that their family name now carried. Any witch or wizard associated with Voldemort was to sign a binding magical contract or be sentenced in Azkaban for their crimes. The agreement was the better choice by far.
“Pull up your cloak then Malfoy, lets see that mark of yours, eh?” He couldn’t tell who said it. Did it matter?
“Yeah, that should work,” Blaise added with a sly troublemaking grin, “I’ve gotta couple of the Weasleys’ finest dungbombs in my trunk.”
“I suppose we’ll just work on the essay that’s due, let me look it over when you’ve got some done. We can work on the other stuff later,” Hermione offered. All three of them had their essays out in front of them beside a pot of ink and quill.
“Personal interest... I don’t expect you lot to understand,”Draco just gave them a shoulder shrug and kept flipping through the ancient pages of Animagus Transformations: Quick and Easy (First Edition). Some of the pages were coated in a layer of dust like it hadn’t been opened in many years. It was true that most witches and wizards thought becoming an animagus was a useless and tedious task that only the backward would undertake.
Everyday after class Malfoy rushed straight back to his dorm and slept the rest of the day away. After the castle had settled for the evening he would sneak down to the kitchens and grab leftovers from supper. During the first weeks of school he tried to join everyone in the Great Hall. This just invited more pranks and jeers. Nobody, not even the rest of the Slytherins wanted him there except for Blaise and Pansy. He was a stain on their already tarnished reputation. Sometimes he wished he’d transferred to Durmstrang with Goyle.
Draco hadn’t heard that one before but knew that when the transformation went wrong it could be disastrous for one's sanity and dignity.
“Anyways,” Blaise leaned in, lowering his voice, “we need to figure out how to get into Filch’s storage.”
“I know exactly what you meant.”Her face boiled with rage. “Meet me in the library two days from now at five,” she spat. Hermione stomped off down the corridor leaving Draco in the churning sea of witches and wizards.
‘Files...Notes...Peeves…merlin’s beard, an entire cabinet dedicated to Peeves?!’ he continued on, ‘Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes...Punishment...Confiscated and Highly Dangerous...Miscellaneous.’
Hope y'all enjoyed! Things will start moving along more next chapter ;) Any guesses about what Draco's form will be?
“Draco are you sure it’s worth the risk? If you don't register yourself they could throw you in Azkaban.” Pansy is half questioning, half pleading with him. ”The ministry is just looking for an excuse to do it, and you know it.”
“Have you started on your Transfigurations essay yet?” she asked him. Draco was grateful she had the mercy to change the subject.
‘Lumos,’ he thought. The tip of his wand cast a soft glow as the small clearing and waterfall were illuminated. Draco fished around for a vial in his satchel.
From the quidditch pitch he could already hear the hum of several hundred excited witches and wizards accompanied by the voice of an announcer. He guessed there was at least two hours before the game might end.
“Professor, Malfoy isn’t practicing,” a dark haired ravenclaw girl called out. All the eyes in the hall locked onto Draco.
He took care to enter the woods far from Hagrid’s hut, slipping through the underbrush. Draco then followed the forest's edge back to where he, Potter, Weasley, Granger and Hagrid entered during their first year detention. The forest was overgrown with tall shrubs that made for tough work bushwacking. Thorns tore at his robes.
Tonight he was sat wracking his brain for where he might find a drop of “virgin dew” as Pansy called it, or a death’s head hawk moth chrysalis.
Draco slowly drifted away from his friends' views after the war. It's hard to call someone “mudblood” or “blood traitor” after having your life saved by them. Now with so few Slytherins and not a single friend in any other house he couldn’t afford to be picky or start a fight with them.
Over the alarm someone was running down the dungeon staircase clanging their lantern on the way down.
He calmed himself before leaving for the alcove in the common room to meet Pansy and Blaise. Tonight was the night. They would try to get the last part of the potion: a death’s head hawk moth chrysalis.
“I heard that Daphne Greengrass tried a couple months ago and when she drank the potion only her face transformed into a pigs!” Pansy added, “ Madam Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall took an entire night to put her back to normal.”
During another otherwise monotonous day drifting through the castle from class to class, Draco couldn’t help but feel a glimpse of excitement. Taking steps toward his new form broke him from the gloomy haze usually following him.
“Thank you, Malfoy, and do remember that out of class resources are available if you should need assistance. A student mentor perhaps would do you good,” McGonagall pondered.
“I.. uhh..”Draco didn’t like the sound of that. The entire class bore a strong hatred for him that forced tutoring was surely not going to fix. “I’m sure I won’t be needing it Professor.”
Fang trotted up to the base of the falls lapping water. Potter kneeled down to examine a group of odd plants growing alongside. They were covered in fine droplets created by the waterfall’s spray.
The library was one part of the castle that had changed drastically after the war. The delicate books were burned and ripped. Curses toppled the heavy shelves like dominos, cascading onto one another. Today, many of the books were replaced with new editions and the shelves were pitted in burn marks. Draco only visited on the rare occasion where he needed a very specific piece of magic he couldn’t find in his family library or textbooks. The nostalgic library smell hit him with hints of: aged hardcover, old carpets and dust. He peered down each row, searching for Granger. This afternoon the library was almost empty, a blessing. Being tutored was like an admission of weakness to Draco.
“Bloody hell mate,” Blaise patted him on the shoulder, “at least you’ve got your ingredient though, eh?”
“Amato animo animato animagus,” Draco chanted sleepily. The incantation came naturally now after two weeks of practice. A few rays of morning sun peeked through the hazy lakewater staining the bedsheets with a shifting mosaic of greens and blues. Draco sat up and stretched his arms above his head feeling the muscles tense then release.
“I’ve heard you have to chew a mandrake leaf for a month straight,” Malfoy offered with feigned disgust. He was barely grossed out by it anymore, just a fact of life at this point.
“Ah Draco good, you can help me prepare this afternoon's lesson,” the professor noticed him and waved him over.
Blaise leaned over his shoulder and made a face, “ Get a load of this Parkinson, you have to keep a mandrake leaf in your mouth for a month straight.”
Five days later they met at dusk in the same quiet nook, gathered around a little coffee table. Laid out in front of them was a single unappetizing mandrake leaf and Animagus Transformations: Quick and Easy.
Blaise reopened his mail, a small fine wrapped parchment envelope sealed with wax and emblazoned with a cursive Z. Standard old family fare, always as extravagant as possible. He licked his pointer finger then split open ‘The Prophet’. Monochromatic images bursted from the pages, contained within their columns.
This charms class wasn’t going as well as usual. Every attempt failed. After one particularly bad attempt that ended with nothing except for a fizzle of soot, several classmates snickered. This set him off even more. Draco could feel embarrassment and upset tainting his magic, making him utterly useless.
Add several strands of your hair, a silver teaspoon of dew that hasn’t seen sunlight or been walked on in 7 days, and a death’s head hawk moth chrysalis.
“Now get to bed before curfew…” He nodded then made a beeline to the door, “Oh and Malfoy, do consider thinking of a better lie ahead of time if you’re going to cause trouble.”
After that, they worked in an awkward silence, broken only by the scratching of quills. Draco had to admit that at least this study session had helped him finish most of the essay. He barely made time for studying anymore, preferring to procrastinate until the last moment then write everything the night before it was due. It didn’t help his grades any.
After everything he’d done, she still saw him as her student. Even when he was responsible for the death of her teacher and friend. How did she forgive him?
“Let’s go over it again… so Blaise, you’ll supply Peeves with the dungbombs,Pansy, you’ll tell Filch then stand guard outside his storage room and I’ll find the chrysalis.”
“I’m not a death eater.” Draco replied quietly, knowing that nothing he could say would change their mind.
Draco’s heart pounded. His quick pace increased to a near jog. Halfway down the hill he slipped on the grass but quickly picked himself up garnering only a bruised shin.
The words seemed to melt together. Nothing made sense. Draco couldn’t tell apart one spell from another. Spells that according to the test he should know from class. He lifted his head from his hands. The clock read fifteen minutes until classes end.
‘If I were old, decrepit Argus Filch, where would I put a weird butterfly egg thingy?’ he thought to himself.
Before he began the process Draco expected that he would wake up and feel different somehow. But nothing was out of place. His routine had changed however, starting with the incantation and continuing with a cleaning spell. After starting the transformation process he neglected to consider that with the mandrake leaf in his mouth constantly he wouldn’t be able to brush his teeth. After a quick excursion to the library and a bizarre book filled entirely with personal hygiene spells he discovered two spells. A tooth cleaning and breath freshening spell which he cast. It became part of his dawn and dusk rituals.
“What am I to do with you Draco? First you’re failing in your courses, now you’re snooping in Filch’s chambers. You’re already going to be studying with Miss Granger but I cannot allow you to go without punishment for this issue. Starting tomorrow, I would like you to meet me for detention every morning in this classroom for the next fortnight.” The disappointment in her voice was curdling like sour milk.
“If your next assessment at the end of this week is sub standard then I will have to take matters into my own hands and assign you a study partner.”
He pressed on into the foggy darkness, following an overgrown footpath. Though the sun was still high in the afternoon sky, under the thick cover of reaching branches no sunlight reached the forest floor. The further he walked, the more a sense of paranoia overcomes him. The oh so familiar feeling of being watched. It was times like this where he wished he had Crabbe and Goyle covering his back, as oaffish as they may have been. The trio was broken in the room of requirements, a memory that still sent shivers down his spine.
“Merlin, why did I say that? Draco you git, she was being nice and you went and pulled that crap.” He’d gone and done exactly what everyone expected of him.
Inside this timeless clearing he couldn’t tell how long had passed. Would he be caught sneaking back to the Slytherin dorms? If he was caught he would be handed a severe punishment. Filch especially viciously despised him since the battle associating him with the destruction causing death eaters. That time was a confusing blur of fear and guilt. Draco betrayed Hogwarts, his home, his family. His conflicted feelings were the driving factor behind his decision to change and become a better person.
Draco usually took his owls in the owlery. Too often he’d received a disappointed letter from his father in front of the entire school. After the third time, he’d stopped taking it in the Great Hall.
“You are talented, Malfoy, you just need to apply yourself.” She finished sorting a towering pile of papers. With a flick of her wand, the pile split into four, each of which moved down a row of desks placing one paper on each.
Feeling frustrated and embarrassed he addressed the class looking for the culprit: “Seriously, who did this? What are we second years?”
McGonagall’s eyebrows were raised so high they might take flight. Draco felt like he’d kicked a puppy. Filch threw him into her office with surprising strength for a man of his age.
Draco tried to remember his dream which was already fading away. He could only recall the sensation of soaring high in the sky. A far cry from the usual dreams that tormented him with the images of death and destruction he had caused. Katie Bell lying limp in the hospital ward, Professor Dumbledore falling from the sky or Crabbe descending into a pillar of flame.
Draco jolted awake in a cold sweat. His dress shirt was damp with it and stuck to him. It took him a second to come to the present, realizing that he wasn’t back at the manor. Blaise was busy snoring in the bed across from him. He pulled his pocket watch from the bed table. Despite sleeping through the night, he felt like he hadn’t gotten a wink of sleep.
He spotted Granger sitting opposite Weasley and Potter at an oak table. Of course she wasn’t alone. This was going to be embarrassing. An apology was in order.
“I’ve already spoken with Miss Granger who has so graciously agreed to tutor you twice weekly, Mister Malfoy. I'll leave the two of you to sort out the details but I expect to see marked improvement in your test results.”
Harry was cut short by the spectacle in front of them. A small waterfall overflowing with clear spring water ran through the clearing and off deep into the woods.
Draco always thought that the Great Hall seemed to sense the mood in the room. Or maybe the weather outside the castle did and that’s why this morning grey drizzle spat from the ceiling. The flickering candles sputtered, trying to stay alight. Despite this, students continued about their breakfast, tossing back goblets of orange juice and fried eggs. He scanned the Slytherin table for Blaise and Pansy. Pansy stood up and waved him over. He slunk over and was rewarded with one treacle tart.
They sorted chess pieces, matches, teapots and dinner plates into labelled containers. Draco moved more mice than he could count into a wide glass aquarium on a table at the front.
“It has come to my attention that your engagement in class and performance in the weekly assessments has declined. I am aware that the last few years have been rather...turbulent for you, however if you wish to pass your N.E.W.T.S then you will have to focus yourself.” She looked down her glasses at him sternly.
Draco thought for a moment, standing beside the table. “Granger… Hermione, I need to apologize for what I said yesterday. It was rude. I didn’t mean it.”
Deep into the forest he began to follow the sound of rushing water. It grew louder as he neared the source; from a trickle to a dull roar.
“You’ve got a great wit for charms, boy,” Professor Flitwick would often tell him after a well cast charm.
“Yea, Pansy found the chrysalis and got out without Filch noticing, but I’ve got detention with McGonagall for a fortnight.” Draco told him.
After Weasley and Potter left, Granger checked over his work. She made a few suggestions but otherwise seemed satisfied.
The lanterns were still lit, a testament to just how early it was. Professor McGonagall was whistling while casting a sorting spell on her pile of papers. An enchanted music box spun round playing Celestina Warbeck’s latest album. Outside, the sky was just beginning to lighten from navy to azure.
He hurried towards the open air archways, feeling the source of the cool air. The whomping willow swayed with a soft rustle. The carved stone bricks clicked under his feet as he descended the steep open hillside.
The brassy grandfather clock hanging on the opposite wall chimed to let them know that class would start soon. The house elves switched from cooking to cleaning mode, turning off burners and washing dishes while running to and from the great hall.
He stayed perfectly still, waiting. Draco only dared move after Potter disappeared fully into the mist. He took off following the path back to Hogwarts with a vial full of dew.
Draco sighed. He accepted his defeat trudging towards the front desk with a mostly blank scroll of parchment. Everyone else remained seated, still writing away.
“I bet I could cut you a mandrake leaf in herbology tomorrow,” suggested Blaise”, doubt ole’ Sprout would notice.”
The mandrake leaf taste leaked into everything he ate. Lemon tea, toast and sausage with just a hint of angry screaming plant.
“Bloody hell!” he yelped. Something popped in his foot. Could today get any worse? A first-year Gryffindor giggled at him and was silenced by Draco’s scalding glare. The gryffindor scurried away. Draco ran down the dungeon’s staircase, threw open the oak doors and disappeared to his dorm. He threw his book bag down, ripping off his tie then heading straight to the shared bathroom. Draco twisted the rusty taps as far as they could turn and splashed his face with cold water. The faucet squealed at him. His white shirt was splattered, turning translucent.
From his creaky oak desk Draco could hear the waves lapping against the dungeons window and see the occasional Grindylow swim by.
“I will ensure that Mister Malfoy is properly disciplined, now if you’ll excuse us Filch, I must discuss the matter with Mister Malfoy,” McGonagall responded.
The privacy, though temporary, comforted him like a weighted blanket. Quiet except for the faucet gushing water.
“Oh uh yeah I guess not.” She muttered. She must’ve forgotten what he did to Madam Rosmerta and Katie Bell.
Draco slipped into the room closing it behind him gently. Filch’s room was a surprise. It was the size of a large closet, uncluttered and plain. The moldy smell only got more vile, bottled up inside, unable to leak out into the corridor. One lantern hung in the center casting shadows into every nook and cranny. The only expected items were the manacles and chains hanging from the ceiling. They were polished like prized pieces of jewelry. Tall uniform cabinets lined the room
Pansy and Draco hid in the shadows behind a column facing Filch’s storage room. Draco coughed into his robe. The stone was damp creating a musty stench. Filch’s door was cracked open and a tiny sliver of dim flickering light peeked out.
“What's it to you Potter?” Draco smirked. Weasley looked at Granger as if to say: I told you they’d find some way to start a fight.
He hated to disappoint her. Despite the professor being head of his rival house, you just couldn’t help but want to win her approval.
Snow piled impossibly high. It whipped around a creaking shack creating a high whistle. A stag stood with snow matted fur padding through the drifts. A winged cerulean shadow passed over the pure white ground. It swooped towards the stag. The stag turned showing it’s entire snout. On its brow there was a distinctive pale marking. Suddenly, the scene was enveloped in windblown snow.
