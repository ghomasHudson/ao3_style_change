"No, no, I wouldn't steal your attention like that," Harry drawled, imitating the face the blond had worn a few seconds ago. "We all know you can't share, you bloody prat."
Hermione looked over a Pansy, pointing to the chair. Pansy just narrowed her eyes, crossing her arms and taking a defiant face.
"Hey, Harry? Can you spin for me? I'm sure these two would complain if their blanket moved after they just got comfortable," Hermione addressed with a devious smirk.
"Why? Are we actually going to do that?" The ebony's face contorted in confusion and wariness.
Blaise smiled, glancing around to the room, seemingly searching for something to ask. He finally found something after looking back at Ron. "Have you ever liked anyone other than Hermione? If so, who and how long."
"Pansy Parkinson, sit next to Ronald." A malicious glint sparked in the bushy-haired girl's eye.
"I suppose a Truth would be in order," the boy replied, eyes twinkling with amusement.
"Merlin, Draco, what in the world are you reading!?"
"I choose..." The Slytherin trailed off, tapping a single finger to his chin. "Hmm, I guess truth. I don't particularly want to move."
Seamus choked on his drink, Dean's face turned a bright scarlet, and Theo just smirked. "Wouldn't you like to know, sweetheart."
"My room tonight."
"Kiss the most beautiful person in this room."
"It's not weird, Blaise. I'm not weird, am I? And I love myself to fucking bits," Theo interjected, being shushed and hushed from every direction.
"Pansy! I am the prettiest person in the room, get back over here," he shrieked, face drawn in disbelief.
Pansy made a noise of agreement, head nodding furiously. Blaise, seeing the decision, reached next to him and revealed a finished and empty bottle that probably used to contain firewhisky. He tossed it easily to Pansy, who broke out into a grin. "Shall we?"
"Sit on Dean's lap for the rest of the game. I want to see how long it takes before Seamus wants to kill you."
Ron's face lit up a startling shade of crimson. "I- uh, well, um, I guess... Pansy. For a few years?"
At that moment, everyone who had the luck to glance at Hermione at that moment got a rare look at her evil smirk, an expression that was somehow so out of place and so perfectly fitting on her face. "Blaise."
Everyone else watched the exchange with wide eyes, just tipsy enough to allow a few giggles to echo around the room as the two rivals argued. Or, as most of the occupants of the room would say, flirted.
"In your dreams, Malfoy. You just want to be noticed," Harry replied, watching the pale boy from across the room, his own lips curving into a sharp smirk.
He was cut off by a pale hand yanking him backward and holding his mouth shut. "Shut the fuck up, Neville fucking Longbottom. I will end you." Then Draco whispered something into his ear that no one else could hear.
"Spin it," Seamus shouted, hands cupped around his mouth for a second before they slipped back around Dean.
The Gryffindor girl nodded minutely before setting the bottle into another circle of impending doom. Again, everyone in the room watched it carefully, willing it to move how they wanted.
"So, what do you choose, Weasley? Public humiliation? Or the spilling of all your deepest secrets, causing further public humiliation?"
Ron groaned along with most of the room from the other side of Hermione, having played the game one too many times with his brothers and Ginny. Draco, ever the drama queen, let out a heaving sigh and throwing a hand into the air, not moving otherwise from where he was situated, his head leaning on a pillow behind him and his long legs thrown over the arm, as he happened to be sitting sideways on the chair. "Really, Pansy?"
"Yes, get the fuck over here. It's my dare, you're not going to make me get bloody cursed. I will murder you, you wanker." Draco stalked over and, grabbing Harry's shirt, dragged both of them to the nearest closet. The blond held up a certain finger to the crowd watching them. "Start the fucking timer," the Slytherin yelled through the door.
"I'm, um, bisexual. So, yes. I can appreciate the male anatomy just as easily." Harry was barely blushing, only a faint pink rising to his cheeks.
Neville glanced over at the boy next to him, the glint in his eyes softening towards the Slytherin. Mouth opening, then closing, then opening again. "I could easily say I have been for years."
The Golden Trio, along with Neville, Dean, and Seamus had come back that year. There were only a few from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, and none of them were known too well by the Gryffindors, but the group from Slytherin had made itself known quite clearly.
It landed on an unsuspecting Pansy, who was inspecting her nails, having made Hermione hold her drink. The eighth years all stared at her until she noticed them, glanced down to the bottle pointing directly at her, and her painted mouth split into a wide smile. "My turn? How kind of you, Theo. Dare."
The red-haired boy quickly looked away, taking the bottle and spinning it.
Harry was still confused (he still retained quite a bit of his original knowledge of wizardry, which is say, nearly none at all). "What? Why would you get cursed?"
Hermione plopped onto the middle of them, half on each of their laps. Both let out a surprised squeak, faces turning as red as the Gryffindor tie on the girl who smirked and leaned back against them.
"I suppose." The Slytherin pressed Harry into the wall, sending a few items crashing to the floor.
The group all nodded or uttered their concurrence. Pansy set the bottle, sideways, on the floor and flicked it into a dizzying spin. It circled the room multiple times, and as it slowed down, everybody held their breath as they waited to see the result.
"You spun?"
Draco ignored her. "Potter. Get over here."
"Fine, you evil witch." Draco pulled a grimace as he pulled out multiple gold galleons. "I hate you."
"I was thinking a quick makeout session before they realize we're still here." Harry lifted his mouth to meet Draco's in a chaste kiss, quick and heated, just a hint of more to come.
She pointed to the seat, looking at Ron. He sat, knowing to always follow Hermione's orders. She was scary when you didn't, as both he and Harry had learned multiple times throughout their years together.
The two connected their lips, both frozen at first, completely motionless, until, surprisingly, Neville was the first to move. His hands hovered closer, finally resting on Blaise's hips, his mouth pressing firmly over the other's. At the contact, Blaise gasped, his eyes flying open for less than a second before they closed again, melting into the kiss. Neville took the opportunity to slip his tongue into the Slytherin's mouth, deepening the kiss. A small whimper rose from the dark-skinned boy, barely audible.
They stayed intertwined for a few minutes, exploring each other's mouths, letting the magic of the moment flow between them like an eloquent poem about love.
It was broken a moment later by Hermione straightening and clearing her throat. "Truth or Dare it is. Who's going first?"
Staring back at him, Blaise's cheeks turned a brilliant shade of vermillion to match Ron's hair. "What the hell? Me too," he muttered under his breath. "Wait, um, not that I'm in love with myself, that would be weird-"
The room was silent around the two, gaping mouths and small whispers running amuck in the crowd. No one was expecting the soft Gryffindor to take control of the proud Slytherin. But now they all knew who would top in their OTP.
Lucius nodded in agreement. "I believe you have other things to worry about. Like your mother."
Harry sighs, moves forward and buries his nose in the crook of Draco’s neck. "That, I really am."
to him for more than five words.
It felt embarrassing to be writing something like this, and it felt like a child crying to his mom what the big bully did to him, but Ginny was standing by the fireplace, arms crossed and determined frown on place, and her hair shone brighter and redder as the fire burned stronger, reminding Harry that this was a Weasley he was talking to.
Harry rolled his eyes. "I'll wait for those 60 galleons then, Malfoy."
"Are they alright?"
Potter leaned back on his chair, defeated. “…Okay. Okay.”
Harry repeated in his head, struggling to remind himself.
Later, when Snape was back in his Manor and on his way to checking on the boy, he’d realize how he had been played.
to. Besides, aren’t they interesting?”
In retrospect, maybe he had swallowed his gillyweed too early.
Hermione shakes her head. “Now. I’m worried. You heard those people talking back at the station. I wouldn’t put it pass the students to bring some of their hostility here.”
Without having been outside, he didn’t feel the yearning for it. Besides, there was plenty to do in the many rooms of Grimmauld Place and the large expanse of Snape Manor. If he wanted sunlight and fresh air, all he had to do was take his potion and run around the Manor’s gardens. Or find a room in Grimmauld Place that had a window that wasn’t barred up. Or take the broomstick that Sirius gave him on his eighth birthday and fly above the clouds. He was allowed to fly as long as he didn’t talk to anyone or let them see him.
“And skins your visitors alive,” Ron added dryly.
and it slithers on his arm like penance, like punishment, like a warning.
“I know.”
!" Ron sighed exasperatedly as they all sat in the Gryffindor common room, books open and quills at the ready. "I have no idea why you're being so bloody stubborn!"
and—the eternal, blinding, deafening nothingness that came after.
His eyes are no longer glazed, but they squint at him, trying to remember who he is.
Draco meant this, as he glanced at Harry's flustered form. "— would love a piece of Harry Potter."
It was more than he deserved.
Blaise smirked at him. "Sorry, Potter."
like it was sixth year all over again but worse, because back then, Draco had something to fight for.
He just wanted to
Potter cringed and immediately put up two hands in front of him. "Err, Malfoy –"
Malfoy nods to her, and Harry is sure that they have already had their moment before he had burst in the room to personally apologize. Or at least try to, but the words didn't want to come out.
Draco watched all this with wide eyes and a bewildered expression, taking in the image of a furious Harry shaking with suppressed fury and magic.
to see Draco angry.
felt about it. He was actually… disturbed. And uncomfortable. That Potter looked hurt. Was it something he said?
"What matters is that we're still together. We're safe. We will get the Manor back," his father had firmly told him.
As soon as the words are out, he immediately regrets it, because it’s inappropriate, insensitive, and Hermione and Ginny are both going to kill him when they find out.
Harry wasn’t supposed to be quiet.
"So the Second Task is under the Lake?" Pansy asked, pursing her lips. "And they've taken something from you."
If he could do this by himself, he would, but as Malfoy’s luck would have it, he was the only Auror with the Dark Mark and so Harry couldn’t spare him from these… awful reminders that Voldemort’s still here despite years being dead.
He was supposed to be energetic, exuberant, bursting with activity and life, just like James and Lily had been. He was supposed to be mischievous like Sirius, clever like Remus… He wasn’t supposed to look so
Ron spewed his half-chewed food at him.
And he leaves, stomps his way through the bridge and back to the clock tower courtyard, hands shaking and heart beating furiously in his chest.
and dying in his arms again, and it didn't matter where they were, in the Forbidden Forest or in the middle of a fucking cemetery, but Draco was always dying in his arms, always bleeding, and…
This was crazy, Harry knew. Going about this thing all on his own. Researching on his own. Thinking he could do it on his own. He
“I’m not doing this for your mother.”
He raised a hand cautiously and gently pried the child’s arms apart. With a certain sort of marvel and emotions that he thought had long since died within him, he placed his hand on top of the boy’s head.
Harry came to himself with a gasp. It was like going back in Time, Before the Time Turner, and it made him sick to the stomach. It was the scene that he kept on having nightmares about, and to see it unfold again, before his very eyes… He kept the bile down with a hard swallow.
Draco was surprised.
Harry relaxed against the wall and pulled his knees up to his chest as well, mimicking Draco’s position. He didn’t know why, but he just felt really, really warm and happy at Draco’s words right now.
Harry shoved a hand in his pocket, took out the Self-Erasing Parchment and the Self-Inking Quill and wrote.
He vaguely remembered Kingsley explaining something about pure blood and Dark Magic and reconnaissance or something, which was why he required two specific purebloods to go: Draco for the Dark Magic thing, and Ron, the only one of them who knew how to transform into an Animagi, for the reconnaissance thing.
"Mr. Potter didn't want that as well."
"We can't take this anymore!"
That did not stop him from saying, with a slight tremble: "Then why should I trust you?"
"Thanks," Harry said, face deadpan. "That's comforting."
Work got hectic a bit so this chapter took a while ;; but the next one will be the last! Thank you so much for sticking with me so far! ♥
Harry’s face scrunched up in confusion because he had no idea what Seamus had just said, and Seamus howled in pain because the cat had suddenly embedded its claws through his pants and his thigh.
that Malfoy was the most practical choice for the job. Even Ron and Hermione had to begrudgingly admit that.
Harry shrugs, and the joke, surprisingly, makes him smile.
have consented had they been
Throughout the pain that he and his arm felt at being manhandled by a bunch of burly fifth and seventh years, Harry glared at her which simply made Ginny's smile widen, as if she was even
“I didn’t think that amaryllises grew here, but Uncle Severus probably uses magic on his garden to keep all kinds of plants no matter the season.” Draco rattled on, his cheeks flushed with excitement at all the flora. “Mother and Father just keep our garden nice and pretty, but they don’t know much about plants at all.”
?” he asked, gaping.
They've talked about it, and Draco barely even batted an eye when Harry mentioned it—simply understood, as he had numerous times before, that it was part of Harry's station as Head Auror and that no matter their relationship and the occasion, there is a grander scheme of things and there are people needing to be saved.
of now having to be around Draco Malfoy 24/7.
It had been a long time since Harry spoke in Parseltongue. He didn’t want to, didn’t like the reminder that his connection with Voldemort still lingered. And he
One of Draco’s eyebrows rose in amusement yet again. “It? Not you?”
Frank Hartsman leaned closer to Gary Oldmoore to whisper once more in his ear: “Did I say twenty sickles? I meant two galleons.”
Harry had already traveled to the Astronomy Tower and then to the Great Lake before he was confident that his head was a whole lot clearer. When he returned to the castle, he was just tired and ready to sleep this all
The smoke wasn’t clearing. Bits of stone were falling from the sky, bouncing off the magic of his shield, and
“I’m not going to threaten them,” Harry says in defence. “Just… talk to them.”
Harry placed the cloak on the desk, before taking the cup with both hands gratefully. The warmth was just right. "How about you?"
He ends up half on the bush of carnations and half on grass, Draco sprawled over his lap.
He knows that something happened during… well,
Remus nodded, stepping closer to look down at the contents of the trunk. His things had been neatly arranged when he last left it but was now a haphazard mess. He smiled in amusement. “Did you find anything that you like?”
“Don’t be so polite around me. It’s disgusting.”
The rest of his voice was drowned out by Dumbledore's
He sighed loudly. "Pass me that last treacle tart, would you?"
He just felt defeated somewhat, like all his fight had been for nothing. No – it wasn't for nothing. After all, Voldemort was dead and his soul had been thrown away to burn for all eternity but – did it really make a difference?
Severus looked like he really wanted to cast another Full Body-Bind on him again, but another retching sound directed all of their attention back towards the door.
Again, Madame Pomfrey shook her head. Her shoulders sagged tiredly. "He drinks it, but… It doesn't stay for long."
Just a bit.
Harry’s heart fell. “I got it,” he said, sighing heavily. He raised a hand to rub at his temples, feeling like he had just swallowed a lump of lead.
A look of surprise flittered over Draco's face, and Draco quickly looked away in discomfort.
One of the cat’s ears perked up and the cat jumped off the couch in the living room to trot towards the tuna. One whiff and it turned away with a scowl though.
“You’re nice, Harry. I was prepared for you not wanting to talk to me.”
Harry didn't, honestly. It was either kiss Malfoy or wait for Ginny to take pity on him and take the spell off, and since he wasn't feeling particularly suicidal at the moment, he was dead-set on accomplishing the latter choice.
"So," he started conversationally, slowly cutting his roast beef. He looked at Severus at the other side of the table, five chairs away. They were the only ones present. "Where's Potter?"
Instead, he opted for a more human course of action: He made himself a tuna sandwich.
“Stop moving about, Harry,” he said in a clipped, frustrated tone, but immediately felt chagrined at himself and guilty when the boy flinched.
Malfoy’s screams got louder and more frantic when Harry touched him, but Harry held on tighter, closing his eyes because his vision was still useless anyway, until he could hook both arms and legs around Malfoy, shoving Malfoy’s head to his chest with one hand and shoving the other hand down his pocket to curl around the spoon.
“You don’t have to prove anything anymore,” he said quietly.
Potter wasn't there.
Draco looked pleased. "Didn't think you had it in you."
Well. He was done chewing out Potter.
Again, Astoria visibly relaxes. Harry wonders just how nervous she was before coming up to him.
Draco smirked at him slightly. "Don't worry, Potter, I think I get it. No need to worry your little brain over it," he said, and just like that, the sadness dissipated.
Harry made his way towards the cluster of eggs in the middle of the arena, one arm outstretched –
At that, Severus' face immediately transformed into a dark scowl. "Yes, and I've already rightfully threatened Albus with bodily harm for that."
… And Cedric was muttering, "
Ah, this time Potter looked hurt.
"No, mother. It itches quite a bit, but that's all."
Draco could still clearly remember the grip of terror and helplessness that had consumed him during that fateful year. Myrtle had been his constant companion, someone to whisper sweet nothings in his ear while he cried and trembled with fear at the freshly-inked snake and skull on his arm and what they had meant for him and his family then.
“I’m glad.” There’s a crinkle at the corner of Potter’s eyes when he smiles, and Draco hates it, as much as he hates the way Potter’s thumb is slowly tracing circles against his palm. There is pink colouring Potter’s cheeks and he hates that, too. “I, err, I suppose this is a good time to tell you that I don’t have exactly innocent intentions in, uhm, being friends with you.”
Harry nodded. He was wary of Ron's reaction, wondering if he'll start ranting or just blurt out things that should not be blurted out so suddenly. Still, he couldn't help grinning at him.
But the question was… Who was alive? Who wasn't?
Ron, not… write him.
Ron fervently prayed his sister was right.
With a deep breath, Draco forced himself to come back. To the feathery soft pillows. The heavy, comfortable blanket. The warm, crackling fire a distance away above his head. The smell of sandalwood. The sound of footsteps on carpet, getting closer.
He evaded people from the crowd, twisting and turning to get pass them, all the while keeping his eye on the damned cat. The cat turned a corner and Harry did as well a second later – only to stop dead in his tracks as he realized that the cat was nowhere to be found.
"Oh, come on, Harry," Ginny said, almost whining. "You practically turn into mush the minute he steps into the same room as you!"
Draco still hadn’t forgotten how Potter had used Parseltongue on it, and how the snake had started to move… for the first time in the past ten years. For the first time since Voldemort was alive. He wanted to ask.
with Theodore, the one where he admitted that his godfather was suspected murderer and Death Eater Sirius Black, who lived with werewolf Remus Lupin. Theodore may be his best friend, but it was still a lot to risk.
Harry closes the door harder than he intended to and glares at him. “Don’t lie,” he says, lips thinning as he turns to look back at the bruise.
“I reckon he’s already inside, don’t you?” Remus told him with a wink.
The parchment unfolds, and ink dances from the middle, towards the sides and the four corners, to form…
It’s empty, as expected. He doesn’t know what time it is, but it’s probably already after curfew. He thinks about the absurdity of Potter eating dinner, realizing that he’s not there, and going out of his way to check this ridiculous map of his just to look for him.
Harry was amused.
That night, when dinner has been eaten and students have returned to their respective dorm rooms, Harry rummages through his trunk for the Map and the Invisibility Cloak.
Harry realized, with a certain amount of dread, that the hallway led to the cubicles of his Senior Aurors.
The night is still long and it is still dark and the house is still quiet, unbearably so, so he locks himself in his room and doesn’t emerge until Ron’s knocking on his door the next day.
Harry smiled slightly to himself at how red Draco’s eye was. He didn’t like the idea of Draco crying but the thought that the other boy had cried
Maybe it was the carefree conversation he was having with Draco after so many years. Being in the same year and house for the past three and a half years, of course he'd had conversations with Draco before in the common room, in between classes, or in those fancy balls, but not like this, with just the two of them in close quarters. Harry had made sure to avoid conversations like this as much as he could.
“Me?” Potter asked, surprised.
"First of all, you must know that Harry does not wish to tell you. You have to believe that this is also difficult for him."
Ever since breakfast yesterday, Harry was finally getting glimpses of the Draco that he once knew. Hell, Draco was even
Harry grinned at him. "I'll tell him you said that. Good luck on your one month detention in the Forbidden Forest, Nott."
He quickly evaded Ginny as soon as he could by running away, which wasn't very Gryffindor but was very necessary, He didn't think he was ready to be mobbed again quite yet.
"When do you plan on ceasing your incessant moping, Draco?" Severus asked quietly afterwards, but he didn't sound angry. Which Draco didn't understand. He should be angry. He shouldn't be so calm like that, standing in the doorway of Draco's room, where Draco had holed himself up in ever since he had banged on Severus' room. Behind him had been a levitating Potter with a bleeding head.
Sirius' head got knocked to the side and replaced by Remus' head in the fireplace. "Have you talked to Severus about this, Harry? It's awfully mysterious."
Malfoy was close, looking at him with his eyebrows furrowed in concern. His blue eyes searched Harry’s face, and Harry couldn’t look away, couldn’t stop the words from slipping past his lips, “Malfoy, I don’t know if this will work. I… Again, you don’t have to—”
Faint knocking from the window caught his attention and he cracked open an eye to peer at the source of the noise. The cat was tapping its paw on the glass.
– and then the door closed again, and it was only him and Madame Pomfrey in the room.
like that," Ron moaned pitifully. "Next thing I know you'll sweep him off his feet and feed him breakfast in bed."
Lucius, Draco, and Harry realized what he meant all at the same time.
Draco cringed. His mother always overreacted over things like this. But, considering who was involved, it would be stranger if his mother
Potter.
Remus thought he was doing a fine job teaching the boy things about the Wizarding World. He had told him about Hogwarts and the wonder of the place and how Harry was going to study there when he turned eleven, just like his mom and dad, just like Sirius and Remus, just like Severus.
There is amusement in Potter’s voice, and Draco missed that, the sound of his voice when he’s happy. He wishes he didn’t.
Or when he tried feeding it the canned tuna that had been sitting in his kitchen cupboard for the past five months and the cat had given him a dry look as if telling him that 5-months old canned tuna was an affront to its senses.
No scolding was given that day because Harry was too flummoxed to do anything other than watch the cat as it pranced around his living room and jumped on his furniture as if it owned them.
And with that, he stood up and stomped off.
“I’ll come back for you during the Christmas holidays,” he said softly.
Narcissa, Harry was painfully aware, hated vampires. He saw it in the way she kept her hands clasped together, fighting habits that commanded her body to reach for a handshake. He saw it in the way her lips curled in disgust when she thought he wasn't looking, and in the way she kept her distance as far as etiquette allowed.
Harry’s eyes widened. “It’s yours?”
To Harry's chagrin, the next ten minutes was spent listening to Draco's litany of
She floated towards them, hands clasped in front of her and eyes brimming with sparkling tears.
Draco learned that Potter had a disgusting appetite for treacle tart.
enjoying it. Enjoying Potter’s attention, his time, his concern, and those godawful smiles that he sends Draco’s way when Draco’s said something particularly funny.
Ron made a disgruntled noise, still engaged in a staring contest with the cat who had narrowed its eyes at him. “For how long?”
Draco took a sudden step back at the shock. His feet slipped on the part of the Cloak that was still on the floor, and he landed on his buttocks, eyes bulging and mouth agape. He could feel the color drain from his face.
Draco Malfoy. On his couch. Beside him.
. Go fuck Weasley already, if you’re so desperate for a shag—”
“I… will. Thanks, Malfoy.”
Sirius' head was shoved aside. Remus smiled apologetically at him. "I'll take care of him, Harry. You go enjoy the Triwizard Tournament. It's a chance that not everyone gets to have. Write to us all about it, alright? Talk to you in three days."
"Blood banks do very little," Severus repeated softly. He did not look away from Draco, but he had on an expression that was… regretful. "At this moment, Draco, Harry's body is rejecting any other blood. We thought that it might not be so frequent, but it's only been a month since the last time Harry drank yours. In the meantime, I've been trying to construct some Potions that might help should the craving come, but…" He sighed.
Harry matched his grin. Sirius’ grins had always been contagious.
Draco looked nervous. His eyes were on his book but one could see that he wasn't really reading, more of idly flipping the pages back and forth.
Like someone being tortured.
His stiff shoulders and red-rimmed, sunken eyes fool no one in the room, though Harry suspects that Draco isn’t really trying to deceive anyone.
What if Severus started thinking about him as a monster too?
"It's 10 in the evening now. Professor Snape told me to tell you to come to his quarters as soon as you're awake."
Potter wasn’t the one who was supposed to be apologizing, and Draco wasn’t the one who was supposed to be receiving those apologies, but the words still eased the pain on his chest and made his steps into the bathroom suddenly lighter.
The door opened, the yellow lamp light from inside filtering through the gap. Madame Pomfrey was still in her uniform, even though it must have been past midnight already.
And not what he wants.
It wasn't that he didn't want Hermione to know. Quite the contrary, in fact. But he didn't know how Hermione would react at hearing it from Ron's ranting.
Draco ready for that? No, he wasn’t. But he damn well knew that he wouldn’t be able to stomach turning tail when his body still had use.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Potter’s angry, and Draco wants to kiss his frown away.
And so they continued, trading hisses back and forth, until they found the exact step, the exact spot.
Harry grinned.
With a sigh, Draco stepped off the lift and into the quiet hallway that led into the Minister’s Office. Right before the double doors, Rosmerta Burke greeted him with a smile from behind her desk and behind the numerous pieces of parchment floating around her.
There was nothing for it.
There was a sudden crash against the door.
Flying became a routine.
“Sirius! That’s not very nice!” Remus admonished but a resigned smile was on his lips.
Harry shrugged again.
Draco took it grudgingly.
And then he was gone, eaten by the crowd, and Harry forgot to breathe again because he got stuck on the ‘
Draco was just as clueless and dumbfounded when he read Harry's next message.
"But not mad
"Yes, you do. I used to watch you, remember? Back when I had this hippogriff-sized crush on you? I
the fact that she had just jinxed him mute.
(This was at least
Reluctantly, Harry raised his eyes back into Sirius’. The man beamed at him.
“I agree,” Harry said in reply, slowly, carefully, as if agreeing was an unfamiliar thing for them to be doing.
Then Hermione's eyes narrowed. "Harry, you didn't…?"
Harry wrenched his gaze away from the sight of Malfoy’s open expression, turned it to the serpent, and hissed,
. Without being talked to first! And he was actually going back to his former self, insults and all! Well, he still talked below his normal volume, but it was still an improvement.
Draco sighs loudly. “Why are you here again?”
mad. He thinks of all the things that could have happened, all the ways that this day could have gone horribly wrong. “
–" His voice was raspy and strained, which Draco belatedly guessed was probably because of his prolonged retching.
Harry shook his head again. Maybe kid wizards were told the same myths about magical beings as Muggles. “Vampires can,” he said, remembering what he read in a book once. It was a boring book, one with a lot of small text and no pictures at all, but it told him what he wanted to know – and what he didn’t.
Harry was sprawled on the floor of the living room in front of the fireplace, parchment and pencils strewn all over the carpet around him. On the parchment were various drawings of… dogs.
“Draco –
During Potions, Harry sat next to Draco. It may have been because he liked being close to Draco or because it was the only seat left.
Draco blinked in confusion at the object in Harry’s hand.
Her eyes softened, the wrinkles on her face showing both her age and the concern that she still held for them. When they reached the staircase, she handed Harry an empty ink bottle. “This should lead you straight to Pomfrey. She has also already been briefed.”
August comes to a close, and the upcoming school year has everyone busy, so much that the invitations for whatever functions have stopped. He thinks that that’s why Narcissa has stopped asking him to come to the Manor, though she
Potter looked just as surprised at his question. "I don't have anything to do there, Malfoy."
“No, it doesn’t,” Draco agreed with a dejected sigh. Then, he immediately perked up again. “Well? What vampire abilities do you have?”
Draco also found it unbearably sweet.
He really was too emotional. Wore his heart on his sleeve. In that sense, on a good day, Draco could admit that Ronald Weasley really was the better choice for Head Auror.
Ron rolls his eyes. “I see you with the Map at night, Harry.”
Nevertheless, Harry's cheeky smile told him he was forgiven.
with him?
Harry hesitated, holding a treacle tart in one hand. He took out the Marauders' Map, held up the treacle tart, pointed to the dot that said 'Draco Malfoy', and smiled sheepishly.
When Harry looked at Ron with a dumbfounded expression, the redhead merely shrugged exaggeratedly, as if to say,
And Harry just wished that he never got out of bed this morning at all.
It was on the morning of the 17th that... well, nothing really happened on the morning of the 17th, it was just that Harry was keeping count because it was on the 10th that Draco and Ron left for this mission together and that was seven days ago and really, Harry was Draco's partner, wasn't he, so why did Kingsley have to pair Ron and Draco up for this one?
It was Draco who had decided for Harry that he change his wards and, well, it was an embarrassing truth that he had never denied Draco Malfoy anything ever since he found out he fancied him.
Harry’s mind immediately procured an image of Draco.
The sound of wings flapping snapped him out of his stupor and he realized belatedly that Errol had just left his flat after markedly decreasing the contents of his container of owl treats.
. Harry Potter’s.
“Not a cuddler, are you, Potter?”
“That’s…” Potter settled back down on his chair with a sigh of relief, before his eyebrows furrowed together with worry still. “That’s good.”
Ron choked on his own saliva. (It was an unfortunate truth that when you’ve been friends with Harry for as long as Ron had been, you start picking up his habits and even his unattractive responses.)
But he wasn't a monster.
Harry sent him a small smile over his shoulder, before continuing on the mountainous path ahead.
Draco frowned at him right back. He understood the stress on his body part, he really didn’t need Mrs. Pomfrey to know that, but couldn’t quite wrap his head around the thought of the Ministry being concerned for his well-being. Or when Potter said
Uhm, well, I have really sharp fangs?”
This time, Harry closes his eyes, and lets Malfoy’s trembling shoulders appear behind his eyelids. “Yeah.”
But this was important, and so Harry kept back the
It wouldn't be a surprise.
,” Harry said, shaking his head with a chuckle. “Then me after if you want,” he added shyly as an afterthought.
Potter looks surprised.
“You did nothing wrong,” he says firmly. He thinks of Draco, Narcissa, and Severus Snape. “Slytherins are some of the bravest people I know.”
Harry just made everything easy for him.
Draco
"Malfoy… Malfoy!
Harry nodded, even though she had already turned away from him and disappeared in the backroom of the infirmary where some of her potions were stored, leaving an uncomfortable silence to hang between the two boys.
The only thing disturbing him now were the sounds coming from upstairs, loud thumps from time to time. Sometimes, he would hear footsteps.
Immediately, she corrected herself. “I
Minerva McGonagall, now Headmistress, welcomes all of them. After delivering a short but emotional speech, one that leaves many students dabbing at their eyes with their sleeves, the Sorting and the Welcoming Feast begins. Classes resume as usual, with the eighth years following the schedule of the seventh years.
Harry does it automatically, out of shock and embarrassment. “You’re back,” he states dumbly.
Ginny peered at him suspiciously. “Who are you and what have you done to my brother? My brother never would have advocated for Harry and Malfoy getting together.”
So this, people asking for high fives, congratulating him, giving him compliments, it was all so…
Rosmerta always did have a running mouth on her, couldn’t keep a lid on it even when she tried. Draco wondered whether it was wise having such a person as the Minister’s secretary, but she had a lovely personality and got along with everybody. That, and she
After the war, Harry had a lot of time to think about whether the younger Draco actually had any idea of his father’s schemes for power. Now, he had his answer.
To his even greater surprise, Draco
"What happened?"
“Don’t listen to them, Potter,” a tall and lanky student told him. Harry raised his eyes to look at him and noticed a badge with the letter P pinned to his collar. The student grinned at him, which really just made him look a bit menacing due to his uneven teeth. “They say those things about everyone who’s sorted into Slytherin, so you’re not all that different. Thinks they’re all goody-goody, y’see, and that we’re the bad nuggets.”
Harry raised his fingers, but then remembered that he only had ten and he was pretty sure that ten days had already went by and passed him. He opted for mouthing it instead, but ended up closing his mouth shortly afterwards.
“But you’re going to have to call him Professor Snape once you’re there,” he had said with light humor.
He knew that he was going to end up joining the Death Eaters one day. He didn't
Quickly, Draco's eyes skirted over Harry behind Madame Pomfrey before they returned to looking at the floor. He shrugged, before wincing as he realized that the motion was not very wise. "Stinging Hex," he muttered lowly, but in the empty infirmary, Harry heard it all the same.
Thinking about Potter instead was something less stressful. At least he could
After a worried glance his way, Malfoy drew his wand, pointed it towards the clearing, and shouted
Draco looked at him incredulously, as if unbelieving that anyone could be so clueless. "To get you in my debt,
Ron only brought him food during breakfast and dinner so when lunch rolled around, Harry found himself sitting quietly in the library, a Potions book in front of him, listening to Draco's soft breathing beside him and just reveling in that feeling of simple contentment.
“I haven’t been able to sleep well lately.”
Soon enough, it was June, and Harry had only a day left before the Third Task.
Harry, as all the other Aurors, stared on in horror.
Harry raised an eyebrow right back at her.
Potter would have an invisibility cloak.
In retrospect, he really shouldn't have felt so downtrodden when Draco didn't turn up in the library during dinner.
Draco stares at him dumbly. “I thought you weren’t going to come.”
Before fury could fully consume him, he forced himself through gritted teeth to say, “
Severus cut him off, glaring. "Harry is not working for Voldemort."
He still had other things to think about.
Snape could only blink. A sense of unease started to gnaw at him.
Malfoy stayed on the mission.
Harry looked at Draco's unblemished skin a little bit smugly, a little bit longingly. He caressed it gently with his thumb. 'It's gone,' he mouthed.
As he disappeared down the hall, Draco let himself survey his surroundings.
Harry's eyebrows raised in confusion. "Even if it's past curfew?"
Harry shrugged sheepishly. “He didn’t
, it read.
Harry finally completely relaxed and grinned at the joke.
Potter's voice passed through the door, muffled and raspy.
Harry exhales, slowly. He now feels Narcissa’s same surprise when he asked her to call him Harry instead. It feels… nice. “Narcissa. There’s no need to request. I had already planned on it.”
It felt
But this time was different though because they were leaving him with Uncle Severus, his godfather, and Uncle Severus wasn’t a man easily buttered – which was precisely why Draco enjoyed being with him so much and why Draco had looked forward to his stay in the man’s Manor more than he had ever looked forward to Christmases.
More warning bells sounded in Ron’s head at the thought of his best mate engaging in a ménage à trois. He stared at Harry’s back dumbly, even as it disappeared behind the wall separating the living room and the kitchen, with absolutely no idea what just happened or how the conversation had turned into that direction. He didn’t even get to say what he was supposed to say about what had transpired during his mission with Draco.
Draco wasn't a Gryffindor. He didn't go around saving people or helping people for free. Nor did he go around giving out his blood. Twice. Most especially to vampires. But this was Potter. Vampire or not, Potter was… dare he say, his
He releases a sigh of relief that he didn’t know he had been holding.
“You’ve been barging in here for the past two weeks, or so my mother tells me. Don’t let something as trivial as the lack of my permission stop you now.”
Harry blinked, feeling embarrassingly stupid. He had left the Self-Erasing Parchment upstairs with Ron, so he had nothing to write on. He only hoped that his confusion showed clearly on his face.
Draco also noticed that Potter wasn't in his flying gear nor was he carrying his Nimbus 2001.
“No, you misunderstand me,” Narcissa rushes to assure him. She shakes her head. “Voldemort—“ And the unflinching way that Narcissa says his name has Harry wondering just where did this woman hide all this courage. “—is gone, and so is his reign of terror, all because of you. You’re a hero, Harry. You can have everything you want and it will be given to you. You can choose to live however you want. Concerning yourself over Draco is, I understand, a…” Here, her lips press tightly against each other, and there is an expression of pain that flitters across her face. “A hindrance to that, perhaps?”
all of our Auror Trainings
Draco felt a chill run through his body. His blood felt cold. It was one thing to think about it. It was another to have it said out in the open. He ran a hand through his hair in frustration. "Then why aren't they hiding here with me, Potter? I don't even know where they are!"
Since the war ended, Harry’s had time to clearly think and understand the nature of why he’s so obsessed with Draco, really. He thinks Ron and Hermione understands, too, but are just waiting for him to figure it out for himself. He’s figured it a long time ago, actually, but figuring it out and accepting it are two different matters.
The smile is in Harry’s voice. “Mm-hmm.”
He turned away, his heart eating itself and his whole body tense and wanting to leave before he made an even more fool of himself, but Draco called his name again, this time almost pleadingly.
"When is Potter going to show up?" Draco asked irritably during dinner. "He's going to have to stop this farce at one point, or does he plan on avoiding me for the rest of the summer?"
Harry can’t help his legs from moving forward at that admission, but a hand on his shoulder steadies him before he can do something stupid like grab Malfoy's shoulders and shake him and demand that he be angry.
Snape forced himself away from those thoughts abruptly. He had turned his back on that life.
Astoria smiles at his careful reply, and starts to explain. “I mean, I’ve been trying to help him. We’ve known each other since childhood, you see. Our mothers visited each other a lot. Narcissa told me what happened to him in…” Here, she frowns, looking down at her hands clasped in front of her. With a sad look on her face, she turns back to Harry. “She asked me to help, but lately, it’s been getting worse, I think. And I can’t be there for him all the time. Especially during classes.”
“You’re the one who wanted to
“I didn’t leave,” Draco mutters, glaring at his plate. Harry doesn’t know if Draco’s glaring at it out of spite, or if he remembers that it wasn’t cut up thirty minutes ago and is now trying to recall how it got to that state. Finally, Draco raises weary eyes at him and asks, “Did you just slice my pancakes?”
"Malfoy," is the only thing Harry is able to say then, frustration making his tongue heavy, because Draco Malfoy, 17 years old and the sodding irritating slimy git that he is,
Harry smiled at him sheepishly.
Harry looked at him incredulously. "That doesn't even add up, Malfoy."
He nodded.
Dumbledore hadn’t been surprised at his sudden arrival or at the manner that he decided to do it. He remained sitting behind his desk, pushed his glasses higher on the bridge of his nose, and sighed morosely. “I had thought…”
It was awkward. They weren't the hugging type of family. Draco couldn't remember the last time he hugged his father, but he hugged him now, still terrified at the what ifs and the what could have beens.
It’s a command, not a request, and Harry stands up eagerly. If he’s being honest with himself, he just likes the thought of them trying on each other’s clothes. He shrugs off his own robes, and puts on the offered one slowly.
"What do you know about vampires?"
“Molly would love to hear that.”
On his way up, he glances at Draco’s face. There is no recognition, no life, but there
Harry nodded, and wished he could speak.
Draco nodded. "He said some things about being the First Donor and all." The term felt so foreign slipping off his tongue. And scary.
, he knew that it did have to be him, and he wouldn’t be able to let other people handle this anyway. Out of a wrongly placed sense of obligation, perhaps? Wanting to experience the catharsis of fully seeing this episode of his life end?
“No, nothing, but…” Potter paused, frowning. He chewed on his lower lip whenever he’s worried and Draco tried not to stare at that, too. “Repeated stress on the body is dangerous, is what she said. And well, we don’t really want to put you in danger.” He coughed nervously, and then added, “Well, any more than we already have, I mean.”
Draco looks at the trunk, and then at him in exasperation. “Well, don’t start getting shy on my things now, Potter. Go on. Merlin knows you need all the help you can get.”
Draco Malfoy, 14 years old with his beautiful, blond hair, standing in a group of adults, all dressed in black and blood and murder. It just… It was
He didn’t give it much thought though, especially when the cat jumped up on the couch to settle beside him and snuggle closer.
Harry shot him a grateful smile and nodded. Then, he shifted nervously and said what he had been worrying about ever since Severus told him that Sirius and Remus were scheduled to take him to Diagon Alley to buy him his books and school supplies.
But Draco didn't feel it was weird at all.
"Come," Severus said, walking towards a different hallway. "I shall show you to your room."
scribbled there in pencil, there really was no practical reason at the moment for the Ministry to go off making inauspicious deals with (other) ex-Death Eaters.
Blinking, Malfoy turns his head around, looks at his surroundings. “Am I…”
And then, with dread sneaking its long tendrils around his throat, Harry figured it out. He should have guessed it, expected it—
keep a pet basilisk in his dorm. Severus had a hard time not spitting venom every time the subject came up in Snape Manor, sometimes giving full-fledged rants about why teenaged witches should be educated about writing on magical notebooks that wrote back.
He taught Harry how to draw a lily.
“Sorry,” Harry said. “Does it hurt?”
Another crash resounded in the hall and more broken shards of glass fell upon them noisily.
Dumbledore was calm when he looked at Snape in the eye. A small, sad smile had been on his lips. “I take it that your rightly guided anger towards me means that you will take care of the child?”
Snape cleared his throat. Something seemed to have clogged it. “Then, happy birthday,” he said.
Sometimes, Harry talks about himself.
we can’t Protego –”
Fleur Delacour for Beauxbatons, Viktor Krum for Durmstrang. The crowd got tighter as they waited with bated breath for the Champion of Hogwarts to be announced. Theodore elbowed a Hufflepuff that had sidestepped in front of him and blocked his view of the Cup.
Draco spoke before Potter could do something stupid like apologize. “Don’t give me that look, Potter,” he sighed. He rubbed at his temple, trying to get his mood back into something more neutral. “We were young and stupid.”
“I’ll explain that you were being an ass.”
"Save it, Potter," Draco muttered. His shoulders drooped but remained tense. "I was an insufferable prat, I know."
Harry already knows what they’re going to talk about. They walk out towards the entrance courtyard, but there are still students milling around, killing time before their first class, and so they walk towards the boathouse instead.
“Harry,” comes Ron’s voice from the other side of the door, and it’s soft and careful, and Harry knows at once that Ron knows something.
More retching.
Draco counted in his head. Rowena Ravenclaw’s diadem would make six. “What’s the last one then?”
did Potter have to avoid him
“The pancakes weren’t going to eat themselves,” Harry defends.
"You must be mental to keep that up for so long," Draco muttered in reply, still staring at the Parchment thoughtfully.
“You’re talking about yourself.”
Ron wrote on the Self-Erasing Parchment as Professor Binns talked about The Third Troll War that no one was listening to.
It made Harry stop abruptly. He turned around, aghast at the idea. “Of course not. We won’t do that to you.”
Draco gives him a deadpan stare. “I went to Azkaban, Potter, not a daycare center.”
Harry rolled his eyes. He took Draco's hand and gingerly guided the long fingers to trace the one word etched on the wood of their table.
Harry’s fork pauses halfway into his mouth. Bits of the egg plop back onto his plate. “Err. You’re not, are you?”
He was even more amused when the cat trotted off to the nearest doormat, which was conveniently the doormat of… Obscurus Books.
“So, you’re
"The Weasel's another story though," Draco continued on thoughtfully.
no relative in Venice to begin with. His mother just wanted a two-week vacation from the ever tedious task of a trophy wife and the more tedious task of a mother.
"I can't believe you found that," Harry muttered, cheeks a bit pink. He sat down on the floor and leaned against the bed as he slid the picture out from underneath the furry animal.
Draco noticed with a start that the screaming had stopped.
A muffled shout of “FREAK!”
Draco’s mind was working overtime. Didn’t mind what? Pointing his wand at him? Killing him? Which one? Either one was a dangerous choice, and he didn’t understand why Weasley and Granger were just sitting there.
“Refrain from speaking ill of my charge and I shall refrain from
Screams erupted from down below.
With the help of the Invisibility Cloak and Hover Charms, Harry managed to get the tray to the library with no problems. The library was empty, even Madame Pince was at the Great Hall eating her dinner, but Harry knew that there was at least one occupant that he would find seating at the very back of the room.
"Oh?"
All at once, Harry crashed back into his own body, the view of that tall, dark forest against the late afternoon sun sobering him faster than a bucket of cold water.
A snort came from Theodore's bed, and then the sound of ruffling sheets as he lay back on his bed. "I'll think about it depending on your performance in the First Task, Potter. Now go to sleep."
Like preserving your favorite wine. Drinking it slowly to savor it until the very last drop.
"You know what I mean."
Malfoy’s lips curled up into a dry smile. “I know, Potter. That’s why Kingsley gave us a Portkey to St. Mungo’s, right?”
Harry could forgive that at the moment, since Draco seemed to have unconsciously abandoned his book and was all ears – err, eyes. He shot the other an amused look.
"Why not the Great Hall?" Draco countered, though it was probably more of a diversion tactic to steer the conversation away from him.
Harry rubbed his own jar with an apologetic smile. "Yes, Draco, you've told me that ten times already for the past half hour we've been doing this." He put his already clean jar on the shelf, resolutely not thinking about what was inside. It looked very disturbingly like tongues, but ignorance is bliss, as Sirius always said.
“Yeah. I might take a walk in the garden today,” Draco says, smiling slightly as he turns to look at the budding flowers.
He doesn’t think his help will be welcome, but it’s better than watching Draco struggle like this, and Harry looks up, but the words die on his lips when he sees Draco’s gaze is vacant again. He’s not moving anymore.
Over the table, after George tells him through a mouthful of food at how bad Ron is at gambling, Harry tells Molly that Draco liked her blueberry pie, enough to eat it at dinner and request it for breakfast again the next day.
Harry shook his head in amusement as the bickering continued on, stopping only for them to yell “
Dumbledore nodded in understanding. "The charms on the Age Line that I have put around the Goblet were still in place at the very last moment Harry's name was chosen."
Panic returned as Harry remembered what he had been doing. "There's this cat..." he trailed off, uncertain how to explain his predicament, especially with Draco's expression morphing into one that told Harry that Draco was once again doubting his mental ability.
Draco looks up from his textbook, and tilts his head at the sudden topic. He is lying down on his bed, his chest on the mattress, in only his regular uniform after having thrown his robes over the chair. His hair is tousled from rolling over on the bed so much, and Harry’s been trying not to look (or
Platform 9 ¾ is full and close to bursting by the time Harry pushes his cart through the wall. It is as Kingsley warned him: Common folk and paparazzi alike are going to be fighting tooth and nail to get a glimpse of him.
Draco blinked. Potter glanced back at him, and smiled slightly at his dumbfounded expression.
"I'll be waiting, Draco."
He doesn’t know what to do, doesn’t know if Malfoy remembers he’s there, doesn’t think that Malfoy will welcome a hug. Not from him.
“Oh, for the love of –“ Harry huffed out angrily. He whipped out his wand, fully intending to cast a body bind or a levitation charm on the feline, when the cat found an object of interest and patted it with its paw.
Harry shakily walked out of the room, but his hand was steady when he flipped Ron the bird.
“Stop reading them.” Potter sighs, fingers pressing on his temple. “Why do you even keep on opening them?”
Amused, Harry let the cat lead the way.
And he wasn't happy being right.
Harry didn't miss a beat. "Like I said, he's horrid at Quidditch."
Harry released a shaky breath and gave a small smile. "Yeah."
That was mainly because the last time Harry did reach boiling point, he ended up with broken knuckles. And he also did not want to go back to the Hospital Wing because that meant Madame Pomfrey forcing the culprit behind the Jinx out of him.
, he thought fiercely, but didn't know how to tell it.
Maybe it was the incredulity of spending time alone with him again like before, Before the Time Turner. Like… like friends.
He was surprised that the cat was dealing well with the hustle and bustle of Diagon Alley. It was more rowdy than usual what with thickets of people doing their Christmas shopping all at the same time, but the cat gracefully evaded people’s legs and only hissed once at the kids who nearly stepped on its tail.
Hermione reaches over to hold her hand.
"Wonderful, gentlemen. Lucius has brought me his firstborn. It is a wonderful gift," Voldemort continued on, sounding as if he was genuinely pleased. And then his voice lowered, slowly turning colder and colder with each word he rolled off his tongue. "What about you? What do you have to offer me? Thirteen years, gentlemen. Some of you have renounced me. Some have ignored me."
Draco carried on as if it was a normal occurrence for Harry Potter to choke on his own saliva. "Drinks. You. Me. We need to have a heart to heart talk."
He wrote and then slipped the Parchment directly on top of the page that Draco was reading, making him jump in surprise.
"I'm sorry I didn't bring breakfast," Harry muttered awkwardly, giving a shy smile. "Breakfast's probably over."
"Where's mother and father?" Draco asked, upon seeing that Severus had come alone.
like an autographed poster?”
Harry glared at him.
It would explain why the Dark Marks did not disappear even after his death, and why Malfoy occasionally still suffered sharp pains from it.
friends after what he was about to do.
"No," Draco replied easily. He was seated on one of the plush couches in front of the fireplace with the fourth years, as well as some other students from the higher years who were looking at their exchange with interest. "You never did know what to do with fame and power. You never would have thought of that brilliant scheme to get attention."
Which was just another way of saying that Draco wasn't supposed to know about the important stuff. Or any other stuff. Which was fine. Draco didn't want to know. All this talk about the Dark Lord going after him or his parents or his godfather,
He wasn't sure if it was because of the sudden loss of blood or the accumulated stress of everything that he had seen in the bathroom. Nevertheless, his feet led him to Potter's bed just in time for his knees to buckle under him and for him to lose consciousness.
Harry shrugged.
He could already move his arm without wincing after all.
It was with misery that Harry wrote out the next words.
Harry flushed at the attention, put his sandwich down and fidgeted in his seat.
A girl, tall and with brown hair falling down to her waist in soft curls, looks at him nervously. Around them, the people nearest are starting to whisper, watching with bated breath and wondering why a Slytherin would talk to Harry Potter.
"What's this latch –"
At around two in the morning, Remus bid him good night. But Sirius knew better.
Theodore scrunched his nose up. They’ve had this conversation countless times before. “I don’t despise them. I complain about
“Sorry,” he says, an hour later, Potions book tucked carefully away in Draco’s trunk.
So he did.
Draco started on his summer homework during the time in between lunch and dinner. He didn't know what else to do. He didn't want to be alone with his thoughts about the graveyard. He had enough of that in his dreams already.
Dumbledore's voice rang from outside the tent.
Harry relaxes. He’s glad Binky hasn’t poisoned his pancakes. Those pancakes were great. “Okay, good. I’ll tell Ron that.”
“Harry.” Hermione turns to him, face serious. “I think you should look for Malfoy.”
stays with you."
The little Potter was his now.
With one last swipe at Harry's bottom lip, Draco pulled away, his face flushed. "Was that…" he asked weakly, turning a darker shade of red.
"Hush, Mr. Malfoy, you'll wake up my other patients," Madame Pomfrey admonished, appearing from behind a curtain with her wand ready.
When Harry turned back again, Draco's shoulders were now slumped in defeat and tiredness, but his face showed determination as bright eyes stared into Harry's –
“Hey!” Potter yelled indignantly. “We had an all-nighter, okay?” He grumbled, swishing his wand to collect all the messy pieces of parchment into a single pile on the desk. He sat down on the chair behind the desk, and waved his arm around the room. “You can sit wherever.”
"I won't."
He chanced a look at the man and saw the shocked face quickly followed by the scary face, but when the man didn’t clock him or even raise a finger, he slowly put his hands down.
"Well," Potter shifted nervously. Then he paused, as if perusing a thought, before coming to a decision. He walked to the door and made sure it was closed shut. He turned back to Draco. "The Ministry of Magic's trying all they can to disprove that Voldemort's back. The Daily Prophet has propaganda against Headmaster Dumbledore all over it. If we weren't there in Little Hangleton, it would actually be pretty believable."
Draco floats then, from one state of consciousness to another. One minute he’s there, staring at the wooden floor of the bridge, knowing that he’s doing it, his body’s doing it, his own eyes are doing it, and the next he’s in some haze, like
“Help him. Please.”
And his boisterous godson seemed to be doing spectacularly well, talking Harry’s ear off about Malfoy Manor, oblivious to Harry’s surprised but amused look.
Ron’s sharp intake of breath confirms that he
Harry took it from her and began to write furiously against the wall.
Harry frowned.
Draco makes a face. “I absolutely can’t imagine myself in Gryffindor,” he says, but he’s raising his arms, letting Harry slip the sleeves onto them.
I have a license in Potions Making
Weasley, Head Auror and pretty much his overall boss, just sighed and pointed to the empty chair beside him. Draco nodded and promptly sat himself down, ignoring Kingsley’s stare.
“Are you…” the boy started, looking to the side nervously.
Nightfall had him staring up at the roof of his bed, head swirling with mixed emotions. First of all, he was desperately trying not to succumb to the fear that felt like it wanted to crawl out of his heart and all over his body.
Immediately, Draco longed for the marble steps and velvet carpets of the Malfoy Manor.
The constant sun rashes and the pale pallor had been easy to make excuses for at first. During the first few years, they had religiously kept the child indoors, hiding him behind closed doors and drawn curtains. It wasn’t a surprise that the first time Petunia dragged the child outside to teach him how to weed her garden, red spots scattered all over his small arms and cheeks.
Harry's befuddled mind supplied.
He wrote, and then kicked Draco's leg under the table.
Harry blinked in confusion. “To what?”
"Sorry –" he said, at the same time that the other person drawled, "What's got you so energetic this morning, Potter?"
“Oh?” Draco rolled the Snitch around until he found the text between its wings. Harry held his breath as Draco read it, taking note of the sudden raise of both of Draco’s eyebrows as he finished. Harry almost didn’t want to hear what Draco had to say when the other opened his mouth to speak, but thankfully, Seamus chose that time to whistle boisterously.
On a particularly rough night, Draco woke up in cold sweat. A quick Tempus told him it was 2 o'clock in the morning. The dream had been so vivid, and Nagini was so real, and the green bursts of light flashed behind his eyelids every time he tried to close them.
He isn’t even sure anymore if he is angry because the old wizards in the Wizengamot hadn't listened to him (
"I suppose I should be grateful that you managed two weeks here thus far," he continued thoughtfully. Then, he said, "In another week, if all goes well… We'll have a short visit to Hogwarts to meet with Lucius and Narcissa."
Potter," Draco scoffed, looking and sounding absolutely insulted.
Harry inhaled a sharp breath. It’s true then. Despite all his nightmares, he still had his doubts. Who among them
Just. He just wanted to see if one of his theories proved true. If he could spare Ron and Hermione the worries he had been suffering from for the past months… If he could spare Malfoy this added burden… He would.
with each other or at the thought of Pansy snogging him. Really. He had no idea what was with everyone's obsession with snogging.
Harry opened his mouth again, only to close it immediately after. If it was because he didn't know
What surprises him is his reaction, his conviction, as he thinks strongly to himself,
But Narcissa and Draco Malfoy—oh, Harry had fought tooth and nail for that.
Four days later, Harry returns, and is surprised when he opens the door and Draco turns his head to look straight at him.
Harry’s cheeks still felt warm but he grinned back. “There’s an inscription.”
“He actually didn’t want to tell me anything at first. I was the one who insisted. It helps, you see. He likes talking about you.” Here, she smiles at him, but it looks sad.
Now, Draco could see that the left side of his forehead was a bit pink. But that was all.
Draco's face fell, and he suddenly looked very broken.
Sirius grabbed the handle of the trolley that was filled with Harry’s things. He winked at Harry first before rolling the trolley forward and promptly disappearing.
"If by fun, you mean I really can't wait for the Tournament to be over, then yes," Harry said, deadpan. Then, he thought about finally flying a broomstick in Hogwarts, besting a dragon, diving in the Great Lake, swimming with mermaids, dancing in the Yule Ball, having people come up to him and give him high fives… so different from the past years that he would spend trying not to stand out and others pretending that he wasn't.
Harry found himself chuckling despite the news. It was hard to be so pessimistic with Sirius and Remus around. "How did you know about it anyway?"
What Harry would remember was the way that Draco's head turned sharply towards him in shock, and how the seventh-year stepped back in fear before completely about-facing and running away with a yell that Harry would keep on hearing that night as he laid in bed.
Draco didn't know what possessed him to write such a thing on Harry's Self-Erasing Parchment that was laid carelessly on top of their table (just in case Harry needed to write something urgent).
That was all his parents told him when Dumbledore and Severus both left them to discuss other matters, as well as give their family time together. They didn't tell him what they were doing with Dumbledore. His father had given him a firm stare, and Draco knew to shut up. It was just like all those business with the Death Eaters. Draco knew something was going on, but he was never supposed to ask.
Hence The Plan that Ginny had badly influenced the whole Gryffindor Quidditch Team into implementing with her to hit Harry with the infamous Jinx. The bloody wankers were more than happy to oblige, saying that they merely wanted to give their beloved captain's very stagnant, almost nonexistent love life a happy ending. (Bollocks, really, because they just wanted to see Harry embarrass himself.)
Draco grit his teeth. It wasn't Potter he was angry at. Right now, it was Severus. He needed to talk to Severus.
Draco blinked. "What?"
worrying. “Did she notice anything amiss?”
He let the implications of his words dawn on Lupin and was satisfied when the werewolf’s eyes widened and his breath hitched. He rummaged into one of the front pockets of his robes and pulled out two miniature suitcases.
“He just
“Yes, Potter. That’s what wizards do. They make potions.”
, sweet Merlin.
He wondered why the house was so unkempt. Did the house not have other House Elves? Was Kreacher the only one? Who lived here anyway? He found it hard to believe that Severus was the keeper of this house. Maybe Dumbledore? Some sort of hide-out?
Draco reached out a hand to close around Harry’s wrist and gently pull him back.
Draco snorted. "As far as I know, once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater," he muttered bitterly. "There's no quit option."
Perhaps Malfoy was looking at the Slytherin table, recalling his younger self, surrounded by friends, during easier times.
friends, they
Harry tried not to focus at all the students – from Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons – looking down at him. It was pretty easy, considering that he had a 15-foot tall red dragon with talons bigger than hippogriffs giving him the stinky eye. Her golden eyes narrowed into slits as she looked at him over the boulder. Behind her, between her legs, sat little dragon eggs – one of which was gold.
It wasn’t his fault he didn’t believe Remus either, because Remus also had a few tricks under his name.
"So," Draco said, leaning on the table, one hand on his forehead. "Are you saying that… Potter
Snape nodded. “Now leave. I opened the wards for you to apparate Harry through.”
“That’s what Granger is for with that big head of hers. She is the most brilliant Witch the Wizarding World has ever known and will probably ever know in this century,
That didn’t mean that Harry was any less disturbed by some of the things that the other Houses said about him.
"Come on, boy. Let's go for a ride."
Harry shrugs. “Free food.” He starts to dig in into his breakfast. Draco continues to stare at him. He swallows down a mouthful of eggs and toast. “How are you feeling?”
No matter the amount of pain that Draco may endure during the exact moment of spellcasting, there didn’t seem to be any lasting effects on his body and while there was a
Potter with his friends, always in the distance, always on the other side of the room, his green eyes now looking elsewhere.
Then Harry sat down beside him.
It was, actually, so Harry ducked away from her stare and scooped himself some mashed potatoes.
“What was that?”
He wasn't prepared for what he saw.
Harry tells him a story about the Marauders.
Harry flushed heavily. “It was Ginny’s gift!”
“Alright, fine, then they should have put Silencing Charms around them, just like we did.”
He didn’t want to.
Harry had long since changed his wards to allow Draco in at all times, ever since he fell victim to a flu that he denied was a flu and that therefore evolved into a fever. He had spent one whole day asleep like a log in bed when he should have been slaving over papers in his office, a fact that was drilled into his head that evening when a very furious Draco Malfoy very bodily shook his shoulders and woke him up.
“In a gentle way.”
Narcissa finally pulled back, and touched lightly at the bandages around Draco's neck. "Does it hurt? Are there no aftereffects of Nagini's bite?"
to say or because, well, he couldn't really
had Potter sporting an expression of amazement.
Ron blinked at the sudden change in his mood. “Got what?”
But none for the following morning to come.
“Yes.”
Harry is at a loss. “Malfoy…” He starts, but doesn’t know how to finish. There’s something stuck in his throat.
Draco’s eyes widen and he glares. “Those are my–! Get your germs off them.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “Why did I even worry about you? You seem fine for somebody who just spent three months in Azkaban.”
Harry pocketed the ink bottle, and smiled at her gratefully. “Thank you, Minerva.”
“Alright. Which one should I do first?”
Remus was thoughtful like that. Sirius, on the other hand, only kept up his banter with Snape as an old habit, but Harry really wasn't sure what Severus thought about them. It was a touchy subject, and Harry knew that Severus only refrained from speaking about it because he knew about how much Harry loved them.
He raised his head sharply to glare at the other boy, but stopped short when he was greeted by Harry's dazzling smile. What he did to deserve that smile, he may never know, but it never stopped him from wondering.
"So? What's the angry mob for?" he said, nudging his head towards the window.
Fast Seeker reflexes have him catching it with ease, and he stares at it in bewilderment. It’s
Harry wasn't going to be swayed that easily.
A sigh of relief. And then, another murmured, "Good."
He wrote, chuckling and meaning it as a joke.
As he held on to Severus' robes, he looked at his parents' faces. His father's face was as stoic as Draco expected it to be. His mother's was stiff. Draco could see she was still uncomfortable with this situation.
you twat.”
Harry’s jaw dropped.
Or it might interfere with the magic reaction that we’re trying to make, between the Mark and the horcrux.” Malfoy scrunched his nose up in though. “Or what’s left of it.”
Draco raises an eyebrow at him. “I’m actually asking serious questions here. You’re the one being all defensive about it.”
“Because I’m a Slytherin.”
"My son, my Lord," Lucius Malfoy replied. In the haze of his dizziness, Harry thought that Lucius sounded nervous. But his regal stance and his confident gaze hid it quite well. "Here to pledge allegiance to you."
Harry looks away, unable to look at Draco’s sneer anymore, not when he’s gotten so used to his face without it. “Yes, Malfoy, I do want to be friends with you,” he mutters. He takes a deep breath to ease the tightness in his chest. “I… thought we already were.”
Harry blinks in confusion. “Ginny? She’s not my girlfriend.”
"Yes, and for the best. You were in a dire state when Lucius brought you here," Dumbledore said gravely. "The students have all gone home for their summer holidays. You will also be able to leave in a few days, when Poppy will allow it."
Harry starts looking for Astoria Greengrass in the Marauders’ Map.
His godfather entered the Great Hall just as Draco was finishing his treacle tart.
The look that Theodore gave him was dry. "When has curfew ever stopped you?"
. They were
Harry was wearing royal green robes, its sleeves and openings lined with silver. Each of his hand was covered by thick, brown gloves, and one of them held the Nimbus 2001. A team of Beauxbaton sixth years had been in charge of their uniforms, and they weaved each one especially for each Champion. For Harry's part, he looked like he was part of the Slytherin Quidditch Team.
She sighed. "Thought not."
and expect to be served high-quality wine. Most people are happy with plain ‘ol beers.”
“See?” Draco said. “We really should talk about you learning how to abuse power. It’s a requirement as Head Auror.”
Draco was confused. And frustrated. He didn't want to stay with Potter, but that didn't mean he didn't want to see Potter anymore. And why was Severus allowing him with his selfish demands? Something wasn't right. This was the part where Severus was supposed to admonish him for being childish, say that it wouldn't
And then Potter looks up, catches his eye, and then sends him the most dazzling smile, and Draco thinks, with his heart dropping to his stomach and his fist crumpling the note,
Draco knew. Even before they went to Gloucestershire, he knew that he could quit and Kingsley wouldn’t bat an eyelash. But could he himself live with that?
Harry felt like crying.

“…No.” Ah. His suspicions were confirmed. “Not yet.”

Petunia Dursley knew there was something very peculiar about her nephew. It wasn’t that he had m—… that he was a freak like her sister. It was something more. Something more horrible that if Vernon ever found out, he’d dispose of the child for sure, and – freak or not, unwanted child or not – the boy was Lily’s son… Her own blood and flesh.
—which was really a more likely occurrence in their workforce (and also one that Draco desired immensely).
“I can’t believe you talked to Ron,” Potter muttered, scouring through Headmistress McGonagall’s desk for anything that looked amiss.
“He saved my life.
Above him, he heard Severus heave a sigh. He looked up, and saw something flicker in Severus' face. For a minute, Draco could see just how tired Severus looked, the darkness under his eyes, and the thinness of his face. But only for a minute. Draco had blinked and Severus looked the same as ever.
“Oh, wicked! Can I see?”
Flushing slightly, Draco stepped back, and Harry breathed out a sigh of relief at regaining his personal space back. He was surprised when a hand was shoved in front of him instead.
“To feel sorry for the poor sods, of course.”
"Why not? Just let me punch him once. Potter's too much of a weakling to bite me for a second time, I'm not
It’s funny, how things don't work out the way you expect them to.
Ron coughed loudly, cheeks pink and expression a bit mortified.
, the Wizengamot had said.
That was how he comforted himself – how he appeased his guilt of not being able to take care of his own godson.
Potter stops, pauses, and Draco realizes that they’re still outside the castle. It’s still dark, with only the moon and the light from the towers illuminating their steps. The wind is still cold, and their robes billow in the wind. Potter’s carrying him, and he’s probably heavy, but Potter’s grip under his thighs are firm.
'Who?' mouthed Harry, frowning.
“Anyway, I’ve got to deliver these to Kingsley. Good luck with
Draco shrugged.
"Show those Hufflepuffs who stinks!"
He could hear shuffling from inside the house, hushed conversation, a door being slammed, and then –
Remus' smile widened. "Congratulations on getting second place. Are you having fun, though?"
But it was already night time. The curtains shouldn’t have been necessary.
Before leaving the flat, he opened a can of tuna and left it on the kitchen floor, telling the cat, “I’ll be out a bit to look for Draco’s Christmas gift. Help yourself.”
“So you made your own.” Potter was looking at him in equal parts of disbelief and amazement, in a way that made Draco try his best not to
“Never should have agreed to Kingsley… Never should have taught that buggering Malfoy how to be an animagus…”
"And spare me your horrid handwriting. I want functional vocal chords and complete, grammatically correct sentences. In English." Draco sniffed at the air haughtily. "If that means that I have to suffer with hearing your voice, then alas, one cannot have everything."
"We can gel it back, just like Draco's here. What do you think, Draco?" Pansy grinned, looking towards the blond.
Harry didn't know whether to be embarrassed or happy because Draco was actually
Another parchment was shoved in front of her, and she realized that it was the Self-Erasing Parchment that Harry had just messily scribbled on.

“For what I said.”
Harry flushed.
The one who got him in this whole mess.
Potter doesn’t look assured, but he nods back and walks towards the door. He holds the cloak open. And then he sighs. He turns back to Draco, opens his mouth as if to say something, but decides against it. He closes his mouth again. Instead, he says with a small smile, “See you tomorrow, then.”
he scolded himself.
, I'm not taking the Jinx off Harry
More shuffling and then stomping.
Harry and Draco had been back in the garden, collecting the herbs on the list that Severus gave them and getting their hands dirty, when Narcissa called from the terrace.
, right, he’s invisible. He takes off the cloak, and smiles sheepishly in greeting.
Snape urged him on as he always did and as part of his efforts to make the child understand that he wasn’t going to get hit for speaking his mind. “Am I what?”
Stupid Potter. Stupid Gryffindor Potter.
Harry was surprised at that. He didn't think Severus and Remus were the type to frequently Owl each other, even if it was to make sure that Harry's keeping himself out of trouble. "I'm sorry I can't be of much help," he said, frowning.
Harry turned beet red and tried to hide the few drawings that he could reach using his small hands. “Uhm, Remus gave me some pencils and…”
Harry rolled his eyes, but found himself shaking his head in amusement. "It's not illegal, Malfoy. And if you don't shut up, it won't matter if we've got the cloak or not, Filch will hear you a mile away."
"Honestly, your grades are suffering because of this. You can't even cast spells!" Hermione said, sighing dramatically. "You may as well be a squib!"
Now that was more like it. Harry pointed at the parchment quickly, before the writing dissolved.
Draco felt discomfort prickle under his skin. He wasn't used to this. His father asking earnestly, without demanding. It reminded him that something must really be wrong.
He probably did the wrong thing though, since Draco bristled and then stiffened. "Yes, well, we all know what happened the last time I offered my hand in friendship."
, it read, so naturally, Harry opened it.
“It kept me from giving in to the terror that the Dementors wanted me to feel. But the more I did it, the easier it got, and the harder it was to come back.”
It worked.
Harry stopped walking as well, gazing at that squared back.
The Dark Mark was no longer there.
But he knew he was the only one who could do it.
, he wrote, smiling sheepishly.
Uncle Severus should be proud of him.
Harry was mildly affronted. "I am not dark
conscious of his brilliance for the past year. When Kingsley suggested that Malfoy be the one to nullify the horcruxes magic, Harry immediately asked for Malfoy to join in on their meetings. Of course, he was denied, and though Harry knew why, he still fervently believed it was a shame.
Potter blinked in surprise. Then his eyebrows raised. He peered at Draco nervously. "That's what you're mad about?"
"My wand," Draco said slowly, hesitatingly. He brought himself to meet Harry's eyes. "Do you still have it?"
, that's too risky.
By the time that Harry, shaky and disoriented, had flown out of the Great Hall, Ginny was still eating peacefully at the Gryffindor's Table, silently sniggering to herself because if only these girls knew that they had all the wrong equipment.
I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S BEEN A YEAR I'm horrible at this updating thing ;;;;; Aaaa so I'm making no promises but I'm almost done with chapter 5, and I aim to update every Saturday/Sunday, and YES, I do aim to finish this!
"But," he started, his lips turning up into a small smile. "Yes, I think I am having fun."
Once they reached the end of the hall, just a few meters away from Salazar Slytherin’s face, Potter pointed to a spot in the middle of the floor.
All in the past, but here they both were, still chasing their ghosts from it.
“I forgive you,” he said loudly. Draco’s head shot up to look at him in surprise and confusion as to why his voice was so loud. Harry swallowed and continued. “And I took my potion already, so if you’re still up for that broomstick race…” he trailed off and was relieved when Draco finally smiled.
Harry shoved a bottle of white wine as old as the First Troll War in Draco’s face. “Only you would ask someone out for a

He wanted to
Harry follows his eyes with his own and takes a deep breath. “The Sorting Hat wanted to put me in Slytherin.”
"In my defense, that's probably Nagini's fault," Potter replied, grumbling under his breath.
he bit me." Then, a horrible thought crossed his mind, and he couldn't even stop himself from uttering his next words, "Is he… Is he working for…"
Potter’s cheeks are pink. “Shut up, I was
The glass doors and heavy curtains are pushed aside, revealing a table, two chairs, and a garden.
It was that expression of awe in the boy’s eyes that pushed Snape’s hand into his pocket to curl around his wand. With a flick and a swish, a cake appeared on the table, balloons appeared on the floor, and a neatly-wrapped gift appeared on the chair next to Harry’s.
The Malfoy in Hogwarts.
, he'd heard Granger tell her husband during one of their small get-togethers.
he stopped.
The rest of the summer passed by. They celebrated Potter's birthday at the end of July, and went for a quick shopping spree with Severus in Diagon Alley for new supplies in the middle of August to avoid the rush. They took the chance to go to the Post Office and Owl long overdue letters to their friends.
Pansy could do it herself. Harry didn't owe her anything. And Harry certainly didn't care about what Draco thought about snogging. It was absolutely irrelevant and unimportant.
The boy was an enthusiastic learner. Snape was surprised himself to know that he could teach such menial things to a child without breaking into a hissing fit of raging impatience. If this was a normal student in Hogwarts, he would have sneered at their lesser intelligence. But as it turned out, this was a six-year-old child who didn’t have an inkling of what A, B, C was.
But Malfoy doesn’t seem to hear him anymore, doesn’t seem to remember that he’s there.
But he wipes the syrup off of Draco’s mouth anyway, and his arm, and then searches for his wand in his pocket to charm Draco’s clothes clean.
"Gorgeous, isn't he?" Harry murmured, a soft grin curling his lips upwards in spite of himself as he tilted the picture towards the cat.
He moved to sit up, not surprised when his vision swam. “Don’t waste your pretty head over it, Potter. I’m in the mood for roast beef.”
Harry glared at her.
Actually, Harry did not finish his breakfast in peace.
help. “Did something happen in Hogwarts yesterday?” And then she blinked, as if realizing something, and she looked at Draco. “You’re okay.”
It was unnerving how all eyes were riveted to him then. At the Head table, he caught the eye of Severus, who nodded at him approvingly. It was a slight movement, but Harry had been with him long enough to notice it and he told himself to relax.
Harry missed talking. Really. There were times when he'd get frustrated again, but memories of the splinters imbedding themselves in his skin always stopped him whenever he'd feel the urge to punch something.
Snape nodded at him shortly and quickly went to business, speaking in low tones so that Harry wouldn’t hear. Although, with Black howling
“Just a freak like my sister,” Petunia would mutter.
After Blaise had dutifully obeyed her and sat next to Goyle instead, Pansy plopped down and started her much-awaited (at least, for her) rant.
, Harry thought wryly.
The goal of the Second Task was to find something important that belonged to them. He heard the blood rushing in his ears. He felt like he was seeing white even as his hands ripped off the tendrils of seaweed from Severus' torso. He vaguely registered Cedric Diggory behind him, with the bubble around his head, doing the same for Cho Chang.
“You weren’t at dinner,” Potter says, continuing their conversation. “I checked the Map and didn’t see you anywhere.”
“Alright, then,” Malfoy said, flexing his fingers around his wand. He looked at Harry. “What do I do, O Great Potter?”
It was Theodore's turn to raise an eyebrow at him, but a grin played at his lips. He knew how good Harry was at Quidditch, although Merlin knows why he didn't want anyone else in Hogwarts to know. The sod didn't even try out for the Quidditch Team once, no matter how much Theodore begged him because everybody (even the Slytherins) knew that their Quidditch Team only kept on winning because of their cheap tricks.
He hadn’t realized that he had actually managed the trip from the stool to the Slytherin Table until someone placed a hand on his shoulder.
"Don't," Harry groaned. "And no sucking up. I feel violated somehow."
And besides, children were susceptible to sun rashes, weren’t they? Duddleykins had them when he played outside for too long as well.
"Shh, Malfoy, keep it down," came Harry's hiss.
need time to rest. Madame Pomfrey is worried your body might not take it.”
No. His vision’s dimming again and he feels like his head’s about to burst. “Fine.”
What really proved difficult in the weeks to come was getting the Potter boy to touch him out of his own volition. Snape wasn’t a tactile man himself, but he knew that there wasn’t anything normal about a child who consciously went out of his way to avoid physical contact.
Behind Draco, Seamus raised two thumbs up and waggled his eyebrows with a knowing grin.
she allows it," Severus added dryly. They all knew how protective Madame Pomfrey was with her patients.
and he’s trying, so Harry gets another pancake and respectfully looks away.
All of their heads turned back towards the door, where a boy with dark skin stood.
“Alright, who broke him?” shouted a very irate Ronald Weasley thirty minutes later as he emerged from Harry Potter’s office.
The smell of copper and iron.
“Don’t bother your pretty little head over it,” Draco scoffs, waving a condescending hand. “It’s unbecoming of the Saviour of the Wizarding World to be so concerned over me that you’d threaten an innocent civilian.”
He hadn’t been ready to see this.
Harry looked at him in horror.
Harry opened his eyes. The figure was coming near him, knife ready.
Draco shakes his head in disbelief. He’s still staring at Harry and the tart like they’re going to jump at him. “You and your sweet tooth will one day be the death of you, Potter.”
avoiding him. Draco was pretty sure he was avoiding Potter, too, even though he was pretending not to. Meals were taken with Severus only, and Severus would look at him pointedly from time to time, as if he wanted to say something, but would always choose not to do so.
Potter frowned, eyes glancing back down at Draco’s clothed arm.
wondered why his skill to talk to serpents hadn’t disappeared with Voldemort, but he supposed now he had his answer.
Harry grinned and with his wand, set the tray on Draco's table rather loudly. Draco jumped at the noise, since he couldn't see just
Draco Malfoy inside, leaning back on his seat with one arm propped on the window sill, eyes gazing out into the bright scenery on the other side of the glass. He’s present, Harry knows this immediately. He sees this in the alertness in Draco’s eyes and in the tension in his shoulders.
Draco, too caught up with his excitement to notice their expressions, stepped forward and shoved his face in front of Harry’s. A big grin was on his young face. “Is it true? Is it true you’re a vampire?”
He had taught the boy well.
He made his way to the Great Hall. He hoped Potter was there, scrubbing the floors.
“Wipe that syrup off your face, Potter,” is Draco’s way of greeting him.
The first time that Draco Malfoy met Harry Potter was during a hot, summer day in August when they were both eleven years old.
Kingsley held his gaze, seemingly thinking about this hierarchy of authority as well. Finally, he sighed, a deep and heavy sigh, before shaking his head. “None. Good work on this mission, Auror Malfoy. Auror Potter.”
Narcissa Malfoy had said.
And Draco had expected it to feel like tattling, or like giving up, but when he says it, he finds that he’s just really, really relieved to finally be able to share anything with this man.
With a heavy sigh, Draco saw the Auror Potter façade melt into just… Harry. Messy, sloppy excuse of a man who would rather just go home at 2 in the afternoon and put his feet up in front of the monstrosity he calls a telly with a pint in his hand.
And then he’s gone.
Draco tried to stifle a smile. “And I suppose you’ve already reported to Kingsley about our mission?”
Harry didn’t mind. The cat had become a welcome presence in his flat that he’d even started considering the cat as his. (Old lady’s or not.)
He should have been able to prevent at least that, right?
Gillyweed was said to last only for an hour and Harry wasn't sure how much time had passed under the dark, murky waters of the Lake. Granted, the slimy plant let him see through the water clearly, and he really didn't like what he was seeing. There was the occasional harmless fish, but more pressing were the human-shaped silhouettes in the distance coming from both sides. They darted around, sometimes even disappearing, but Harry felt their constant presence.
Harry almost squinted against how bright she was glowing. People like her still do exist in this wizarding world. He wished Fleur wouldn't get herself badly hurt out there.
Viktor Krum turned his shark head towards Harry and nodded once in acknowledgement, before continuing to gracefully swim towards those four silhouettes.
Draco made a confused noise. "
"Have you been crying?"
He would have to remedy this immediately.
He wanted to claw his stomach out, wanted to drag his nails across his chest, wanted to extinguish that last bit of Voldemort from within him, he wanted to…
After, when Harry’s back in bed and Ron’s gone and Kreacher’s cleaned all the plates, Harry thinks to himself that maybe why Ron isn’t angry at him for busying himself with Malfoy so much is because he understands what it’s like for all your thoughts and attention to be consumed by one person.
"Even the Slytherins," Draco added as an afterthought. Then, he blinked. "Is he a Slytherin? Only a Slytherin would want to hex your bits off. Not that they do anymore, but you know, stereotypically speaking."
Harry was even more confused. He had no idea why Draco came here, and this certainly wasn't helping him any.
"They tap on those windows once in a while, usually on Sundays," Blaise continued. "It's a good thing there are Charms all over the dungeons to keep their voices out. They're deadly."
Harry matched his confused expression. “But Draco said…” And then it hit him.
He scrambled for his wand in his pocket with one hand but the other never left Harry's cheek. With a few whispered words, Harry's nose righted itself with a snap and the blood disappeared from Harry's face.
"Don't look like that, Potter," huffed Draco. "I was only asking," he muttered, turning back to his book.
“I want you to mean it,” Malfoy said, angrily.
Malfoy caught him by the shoulders as he fell forward on his knees.
As soon as it did, Draco heard it.
Snape’s lip curled in disgust. “No,” he found himself saying. “I’ll do this myself.”
Draco stared at him. "You're not… you're not going to do anything?"
"Uhm," Harry said. He was starting to feel a bit sick. Maybe it was because they were twirling too much. "I'm not sure what Malfoy thinks about snogging."
Harry was finding it ironic that he actually disliked this moment that Malfoy actually
Draco turns his head back, eyes burning with anger, mouth curled into a snarl as he hisses: “Leave me
Letting out a soft sigh, Narcissa sits down on one chair and waves a hand for Harry to sit on the other.
Still, despite their years working together, Harry still couldn’t wrap his head around this changed Malfoy. This brave Malfoy.
possible candidate of Hogwarts? He's the only one here who's not wussy enough to enter."
It was to his disappointment when Draco merely said, "Really."
“We’re going to
Draco knew that voice anywhere. He knew it especially from his nightmares.
Instead, he says, “Let me down.”
On the fifth day, it seemed like
His mother was there. As were his aunts, Bellatrix and Andromeda. However, Andromeda's portrait had been scorched black, just like the portrait of… Sirius Black, the notorious murderer who had betrayed the Potters, leading to their death under the Dark Lord's hands.
Harry sat up abruptly, still staring at Draco with wide eyes and a gobsmacked expression. “But… the cat…” he trailed off pitifully. “I fell asleep with the cat!”
as if she’s trying to figure out if what he’s saying is true. And then, finally getting her answer, her shoulders relax and amusement tinges her smile. “Whatever did my son do to inspire such loyalty from you?”
September 1 is just around the corner.

Harry swallows whatever it is that’s in his throat and it goes down, hard. “I… I’m sorry, Malfoy.”
Draco leaned back in his chair. "Still no plans on taking that Jinx off you then?" he asked coolly.
"How will you ensure that he will be safe without us, Lucius?" Narcissa did not move from her position, but her voice was steel.
“He comes and goes,” Narcissa says softly from beside him. Her gaze towards her son is sad. “It’s episodic. The healers say it’s a form of disassociation, his mind’s way of getting through the trauma of Azkaban and being so near the Dementors.”
He was doomed.
Harry frowned, eyes glancing over Draco as well despite his efforts not to be obvious, because someone
The same goes with Potter. What
As he goes further, he passes by more and more compartments that are empty. It’s quieter. The noise of people talking and chattering fades in the distance, and the decrease in the student population this year is more obvious here.
Harry groaned. He should have known better than to look for sympathy in a house of snakes.
waiting outside the Fat Lady's Portrait. He stood stiffly and his face was pale and he looked like he wanted to be anywhere else than here, but Harry felt his own heart catch in his throat anyway.
Snape was a professional when it came to hiding his emotions. He had done it as a child when the relationship of his parents catapulted into disaster. He had done it as a student when James Potter and his posse teased and taunted him. He had done it when Lily told him that she was going to marry James Potter.
, Harry forgot himself and dashed forward to throw his arms around Severus’ waist, bury his face in Severus’ robes, and
, Harry, then I suppose I must accompany you to the Yule Ball as your partner."
“You remember the state I was in when I first got out of that place.”
He’s definitely happy. Damn Potter. “Worried that poor little Draco went bonkers and wandered off into the Lake?”
“Malfoy,” Harry croaks out in greeting, but there is no response.
"But that is not any of your concern, Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore said to Draco gently. "Do not worry. Leave that to us."
Granger. And you don’t want
With two pops, he was finally left alone in his Manor.
“People in Diagon Alley’s not gonna be so nice, will they?”
Potter spoke again. “I need his help.”
Potter nodded back, looking away in embarrassment. "Well, let's go then?" He nudged his chin towards their broomsticks.
“Here,” he repeated numbly.
The book also told him that at the mature age of 18, vampires start to
He is looking fuller now, more alive. His cheeks have filled and the colour is coming back to his skin. Inexplicably, Harry is suddenly very, very relieved that Draco isn’t indisposed enough that he can’t eat. Narcissa has told him, through the letters that they have started to exchange, that Draco’s spending more and more time present with her lately.
Behind Narcissa, Draco caught his father's eye and the slow shake of his head.
Ron looked a bit red, but maybe that was because of the fireplace. He looked at Harry apologetically, and Harry shrugged and wondered if he'll
“Mm,” Draco says in reply. “My mother says it might be a relapse.”
It took Potter two more days to emerge from his room behind the tapestry, and Draco guessed it was only because it was the day they were supposed to go to wherever this Unplottable place of Severus was.
The cat’s repose was short-lived, however, as a customer from inside opened the door outwards, making the cat leap up in surprise and run behind Harry’s leg.
He craned his eyes away to focus back on the path ahead. "It was Salazar Slytherin's, passed down through generations until it somehow came to the Gaunt family.”
The cat huffed at him, before looking away as well and resuming its sleep.
"Are you saying saving your life wasn't enough for that gillyweed?" Potter asked, shaking his head in disbelief.
“As I was saying, Draco practically sent all of us all over the train looking for you.” She looked pointedly at Harry and huffed indignantly at Draco. “Can you
Cedric motioned for Fleur to go first, and Fleur smiled at him winningly.
Sirius rolled his eyes and threw an arm around Remus’ shoulder. “Come on, old man, you’re probably more tired than he is. Joints already creaking?”
He searched the stage and the stands, looking to catch a glimpse of Severus. It was pitiful how he was seeking comfort. He should be more composed at a time like this. Severus would definitely disapprove at how he was shaking like a coward. Actually, where
"Tough," Draco said merely, shrugging. He paused, as if wanting to say something more. His eyes flickered back to his book, contemplating on ending the conversation there. Either way, Harry still would have forced the conversation to continue, but it made him grin when Draco looked back up at him again, struggling to hide the curiosity in his voice.
Harry did. Ever since that night in the Astronomy Tower, and that time in Malfoy Manor when Draco had been asked to identify them and didn't. Harry trusted him.
"On the highly off chance that you'll win the Triwizard Tournament, Potty, I need to be ready to blackmail you into using your fame and power to give me what I want. And even if you
They’re in the middle of the meadow now, and the boathouse can be seen in the horizon. Clouds litter the sky, floating gently with the wind. Sunlight filters through gaps between them, bathing everything in a magical sort of glow, like a dream.
Then, Ron spoke what they had all been thinking but didn't want to bring up:
"Nonsense, Harry!" Sirius exclaimed. "You fly better than any ancient magical creature in history!"
"In any case," Pansy interrupted once more. "See you at the Yule Ball, Harry," she crooned in her sweetest voice and winked at him.
It was funny, how Harry had been competing with books for Draco's attention for the past few days.
it sucks how much he’d missed that smile. His head still hurts, but he finds himself smiling back anyway.
"I'll be alright if you change your bets to Hogwarts."
Harry felt warm all over. He smiled at Sirius. “Alright.”
Finally, after deeming the room worthy of occupation, the cat situated itself on one of the throw pillows on the couch, curled up on itself, and closed its eyes.
“Now you don’t listen to what my dear cousin told you. She’s flown off the bat just like the rest of my family and, well, we all know what my family’s made off,” he quipped, winking before doing his best impression of Walburga Black’s sour portrait.
to discover a photograph of him in Harry's bedroom, even if it was hidden under a pile of knick-knacks. When he first devised The Plan, he had no expectations, really. All he had was the intelligent guess and the hope (a
Potter shrugs. “It’s not the first time I’ve been to the Forest. And you didn’t manage to get very far.”
"No more, I believe. His blood levels seem to be normal, but I will need to monitor it for the next three days. Too much of the Potion is also dangerous."
The crowd erupted in cheer. A few boos came from the Slytherins, which was more obligatory than because of their actual dislike for the Hufflepuff.
Harry quickly shook his head.
He isn’t surprised when, moments later, the expression on Draco’s face melts away and his body goes slack.
Suddenly, all of Harry’s insecurities came back to him and he remembered Mrs. Malfoy’s words.
. Draco should have known. “An hour?”
Because he knew that Snape wouldn’t be able to resist anything with Lily in it.
The Death Eaters just sounded like a club to him. Like a club full of rich, dark wizards that bought and sold illegal artifacts here and there, but… The Dark Lord wasn't in the plan.
He looked… relaxed.
would have been harder to find.”
to heal," he said, lying.
I thought… I thought I was never going to get out.”
“Zach,” Hermione’s voice, altered into a high-pitched squeak, sounds from beside him, and she turns green eyes to him, a smile plastered on her thick lips. “I reckon we should hurry it up, don’t you? We don’t want to miss the train.”
Beside him were the other Champions, illuminated by lights and the shine of the moon. They were all looking at Bagman, listening intently with firm determination and hard resolve. Harry looked behind him.
anymore!" Ron blurted out during breakfast, effectively spraying soiled bread crumbs all over the table. His eyes were fixed firmly on Malfoy's figure sitting in the Slytherin table, beside Nott and Zabini but none of them were talking. In fact, Malfoy was just staring at his plate, poking his pancakes absently. "And he's gotten so thin," he muttered.
His imagination had actually played with the possibility of everyone screaming and running away from him, because that’s what the normal people in Muggle stories did, didn’t they?
“It’s my fault—”
He looks across the room, to the Gryffindor table, where Potter sits, laughing at whatever inane joke Weasley had said. He looks happy, surrounded by his friends, with no weight of any Dark Lord pressing down on his shoulders.
She then gestured to the glass of the questionable liquid in Harry's hand, which Harry had actually planned on Vanishing as soon as her back was turned. Unfortunately, she seemed to read his mind and waited patiently for him to drink it in front of her.
On Draco's palm.
Harry also didn't expect this either.
Sirius Black certainly hadn’t expected meeting James’ son again to turn out like this. The boy had been just a baby, barely three months old, when Sirius last saw him.
When Malfoy found out, he had fallen back on the snow, face deathly white and eyes wide with horrified disbelief. He had said, “I won’t do it.”
It had been a Christmas gift from Sirius and Remus during his first year, with a note from Remus about how it had been his father's and explicit instructions from Sirius to
snog you in front of all these people if you don't stop ogling another girl while dancing with
Like him.
After all, it wasn't like Draco had any idea…
And it
One of Severus' eyebrows raised, as if in disbelief that Draco had the gall to demand at times like this. "I expected you wouldn't, Draco, after what transpired. I have already taken that into account."
He kept his eyes glued on his handwriting stubbornly, ignoring Ginny's huff from beside him.
Harry grins at her sheepishly. They’ve had this conversation before, numerous times in the Burrow, and he thinks Ginny’s still trying just for the sake of it. “I’m sorry, Ginny. I just don’t feel like it. I just want to finish the school year in peace.”
A wistful smile slowly slides its way on Malfoy’s lips. "I did, didn't I?" And there is a distant look to his eyes, as if he is mulling over a thought that he has long since pondered. He sighs and fixes his robes, if only to avoid Harry's gaze.
So it was to his surprise when one night in the Common Room where he and Theodore were playing chess, Pansy approached him and suddenly announced in a loud voice, "Well, if you absolutely
The quiet of the castle was starting to get annoying. It was
Draco didn't know this. He found himself listening intently.
I need you and your watch both in good capacity to transport me to St. Mungo’s, remember?”
Dudley made him sit with them during mealtimes sometimes, even though Uncle Vernon’s face would turn into a funny purple. At first, he made the mistake of thinking that they were finally allowing him to eat with them, but was quick to learn that it was only one of Dudley’s ways of hurting him.
Madame Pomfrey raised an eyebrow. "It's not Skele-Gro, dear. You'll find that your elbow and wrist are perfectly aligned with your lower arm, though I suggest not moving it yet," she added, as Harry had raised it experimentally and was now sporting a very pained expression.
but they were really just scratches. If he was in any other relatives’ place, he’d have made a big scene and cried his heart out, if only to get the adults to buy him whatever he wanted so that he wouldn’t tattle to his parents that they hadn’t taken care of him well.
He had apparated to Little Whinging shortly after that, livid and fingers cold with fury. He had planned to stalk right up to the front door, knock, and launch into a ten-minute speech as to why they should hand over the accursed boy to him, but when Petunia Dursley opened the door, all he could do was stare.
"Are you sure you didn't put your name in the Goblet of Fire, Harry?" At least Dumbledore was being nice about it.
In front of him, Theodore said smugly, "Checkmate, Potter."
“I’m with her, mate,” Ron says carefully.
perhaps, so there might be something we can find in the Department of Mysteries.”
There, Snape's expression softened – just a miniscule, tiny bit. "I myself will do daily rounds for security."
He put his pudding down, leaned in and pressed his lips against Harry's for the umpteenth time in two days. Harry immediately pressed back, parting his lips slightly as an indication of what he wanted.
“What is this, then?” The smile turns into a smirk. “The Golden Boy’s feeling guilty?”
, Harry thought.
Harry grinned.
Harry didn't have much of an opportunity to be annoyed at whoever knocked him over though – he was still having a hard time processing the fact that Draco Malfoy was in front of him and had just saved him from being mercilessly harassed by the completely mental.
made him feel warm inside. “Come on, let me in,” he said and wormed a leg through the crack.
“Potter,” Draco says, three days later. Breakfast and lunch has both come and gone, and this is the first time Draco has spoken today.
“You look like Gilderoy Lockhart.”
he breathed out, rushing forward to clutch Draco to his chest.
Remus' gaunt face greeted him a week later in the Slytherin Common Room.
Harry blinked. He looked down at his arms and remembered the days of long ago when he still weeded Aunt Petunia’s garden. “We do, but Severus makes a potion for me that allows me to go out during the day. I took one earlier, because he said you might like to fly around a bit.”
They were sitting on the bench in the garden at the back of the house. Shrill and high-pitched Christmas music sung by the Wailing Witches resounded from the party behind them, but it was pretty easy to ignore with red wine from the Inquisition Era in their system and the length of their legs pressed warmly together.
“Potter.”
and right now, my opinion of you is becoming less and less favorable the more time I am forced to spend holding this dirty towel –"
He wrote on the Self-Erasing Parchment, before shoving it right under Draco's nose, above the book that he was reading.
He scowled.
Beneath him, the dragon let out a furious roar. Her wings flapped and some of the students ducked in cover at the sudden burst of wind. She flew to the sky, only to be pulled back down by the chain around her leg. Harry could hear his blood rushing loudly in his ears as he watched the dragon fight against the shackles. Another screech of rage, another flap of the wings, and the chain broke free from the earth it was embedded in.
The smile that Draco sends him at that is dry. “Have you forgotten the things I’ve done?”
He never did get around to having
"I just want to know
And there was no else with the Dark Mark that Draco trusted.
The wind around the forest was cold. Snow was already covering the treetops and the ground, but Harry still knew the way—He had walked it so many times in his nightmares.
should do the trick.”
Kingsley’s expression softened into something like relief, as if
He doesn’t understand it, why Potter’s suddenly trying to be nice.
His eyes strayed to his forearm, where the Dark Mark used to be.
Harry’s lips press together thinly. He can imagine it, mothers whispering to each other, convincing each other not to send their sons and daughters to Hogwarts because of an ex-Death Eater. He can’t really blame them, but it still sours his mood.
Severus Snape, a black figure standing in one of the corners of the room, tried to stifle the amused smirk that was threatening to crawl its way to his lips. He could already see his charge slowly giving in to his annoyance and impatience, a trait he probably acquired from Snape. That, combined with his impulsiveness and rebellion to authority that he no doubt got from the mutt and the werewolf, was actually a bit dangerous, if not amusing.
Harry didn't know how he managed to break free from the ropes, he just knew that he was running towards Draco –
And it’s easy to think that, isn’t it? It’s easy to close that chapter. When you weren’t one of those horcruxes. Or aren’t.
Snape looked back down at the child. He took in the oversized clothes, torn in some places, and the oversized glasses. But most of all, he took in the thinness of the child, the dull bruises on the child’s forehead, the rashes on his hollowed cheeks, and the dried, broken lower lip.
As soon as the butterflies rose in his stomach, it fell into an acidic death as Harry thought pitifully that he was doomed. If he was this smitten, then what hope did he have to forget his feelings after… well, after
Harry’s assurance is short-lived as he sees the purpling bruise on Draco’s temple.
A smile blooms in Harry’s face as well. "Yes."
By the punch table, George Weasley narrowed his eyes at Seamus. “Did you just mess with the charms on my Traveling Mistletoe? I put magic-impervious charms on those.”
Draco's expression softened, all hints of mischief gone. "I'm not sure if I ever did," he murmured, repeating Harry's own words from a few days ago.
But seeing Draco Malfoy like that reminds him,
No, that would be disastrous.
He wasn’t sure just when he had gotten attached to the boy, but giving the boy away, even if it was only temporary, stung.
that had it worse, he was the one that Nagini bit, the one spluttering blood everywhere, and Potter had just been tied to a tombstone. Did something else happen to Potter after he passed out?
Harry laughed. “Yes, yes.” He stepped back, to give Draco space. “Not anytime soon. Not on my watch.”
The hot rage that churned in Remus’ stomach then was a familiar sensation by now. It happened every time they were reminded of how those Muggles had treated Harry – kind, kind Harry – which was happening a lot more frequently. Remus was happy that Harry was being more open to them now, but it was getting harder and harder to restrain Sirius from going to Little Whinging and hexing the family since Harry’s mentions of them were getting more and more detailed.
Harry didn’t know what to do with this sudden anger. All he could do at the moment was stare as Malfoy closed the distance between them with harsh footsteps on the snow.
During the Christmas and summer vacations, he would stay with Severus. When Severus was required to be in Hogwarts, he stayed with Sirius and Remus. He never really did know why Severus and Sirius didn’t like each other very much but they got along just fine as long as they never really saw each other.
told him that he had been sleeping for five hours, which wasn’t a bad number considering the most hours in a row he’d been able to sleep through lately was two.
Potter cursed under his breath again, which told him he was right.
Potter grins at him in reply. He taps the lower right corner, the Slytherin Dorms, right where their names are placed beside each other.
He turned around abruptly, intent on rounding on the next corner instead, and ended up colliding with a passer-by.
The realization dawned on him like a sharp rock being dropped on his stomach.
“Well, you’re not eating them.”
Harry entered the Gryffindor common room, which was empty except for the three figures by the fire. Hermione and Ginny both sprung up from their respective chairs and on their feet, faces glowing and expectant and grins big and smug, and that only served to make him feel more miserable.
Draco nodded. “Felt like it.”
Theodore paled.
Draco knew at once that Severus had a Glamour Charm on.
On the twelfth day of Draco’s stay, mid-morning found the two of them separated by a door.
Draco's voice cut through the moment. "Do you even know how to use that, Potter?"
"Wipe that ridiculous look off your face, Potter, and get down here!"
“I’m not going to do it,” he said, the words slipping easily off his tongue, but Malfoy’s glare intensified.
“But – I want to
, Potter? I knew you were hopelessly Gryffindor, but this is just pathetic," he spat, so unlike his quiet demeanor just a few minutes ago.
With a happy sigh, he let himself fall down on his couch, only momentarily disoriented by the throbbing in his head that resulted from the movement.
“I’m sorry. It’s okay. It’s…” He glanced at the snake, still slithering lazily back and forth. “It’ll work now. I think.” He glanced back up at Malfoy’s face, tried to be reassuring. “It’s okay. Let’s try again.”
That was progress. He only had one more thing left bothering him. "Mother and father," he started, unsure. He was almost scared of the answer. He knew that nothing dire had happened to them, if Severus' calm demeanor was anything to judge by. But he didn't know what they were doing. What they were fighting against.
Heart pounding in his chest, he took the box from the trunk, holding it with the utmost care. Severus, Sirius and Remus all had given him the things that had once belonged to his parents – things that they borrowed but never got to return – but they were few and this was the first time that Harry found one on his own.
“Come on,” Ron says, and his smile doesn’t quite reach his eyes, because he still doesn’t agree about Harry’s obsession over Draco Malfoy, and Harry doesn’t like it himself either, but he’s still thankful that Ron’s trying.
It was as musty and murky as Harry remembered, except this time the cavern looked smaller than it had been when he had last stepped in here as a twelve-year-old.
to, but in the end, relented with the promise that he was to take a Portkey in case of an emergency. He figures that Aurors storming the Manor isn’t an impossible idea should he be gone for an unusually long period of time.
But Malfoy, as he had so often done in the five years they've been colleagues, surprised him with nary a glance towards the dirt accumulating on his fingers from balancing himself with the help of tree barks.
Frantic fingers turned the Time Turner once, twice, thrice –
it was to still be expected to be on these missions. Before admitting to his friends about his nightmares, he had lain awake, thinking
Harry found himself opening and closing his mouth in bewilderment. When he finally gathered the wits to speak again, the only words he could muster were: "That's unfair, I want a cupcake, too."
All of a sudden, the now familiar sense of despair takes hold of him and makes his fingers cold. His eyes are rapidly becoming warm and he blinks to keep them at bay. A swallow pushes down the lump in his throat and a deep breath eases the pain in his chest, just a bit.
worried about his grades since he still couldn't speak and he didn't want to worry her any more than she already was.
There laid a small, circular spot of dry marble floor—as if the water, a gift of nature filled with life and magic, was loathe to come near it. The water flowed around it, repulsed by some sort of force.
Two weeks before the Yule Ball, Harry found a box on his bed. In it were dress robes, black with dark green lining. The fabric was soft to the touch, yet maintained its shape, especially around the shoulders and the waist. There were also black shoes made of smooth dragonhide, and a brooch – a magically charmed white lily.
“Hartsman’s love for galleons is going to be his downfall one day,” Draco muttered as he took a sip from his glass.
, Draco Malfoy had to steal the show. He emerged from the crowd, stomping towards Harry with a purpose. He pointed a finger at Harry's chest and glared. "
One edge of Draco’s lips quirk up into a small smile, as if he’s still amused that Harry’s still glorifying them. “There needs to be a villain in a narrative. That’s what we’re here for,” he murmurs, eyes traveling to his clothed arm. “That’s how the balance works.”
As easy as that, Harry felt guilt wash over him in waves as he wrote on the corner of the Parchment.
“—introduce you to him!” Draco was yelling.
) or because Draco Malfoy in general just has this talent of making people want to punch him, even when he is about to jump into the Dementors' arms.
Harry kept himself hidden, heart throbbing painfully in his chest but at the same time feeling rather numb about what was happening.
Harry touched her elbow to catch her attention and shook his head.
why I'm doing detention with you?"
In reply, Draco nuzzles the top of his head and murmurs, "Not as lucky as I am. Head Auror out for a week on a mission, comes home dead tired in the middle of the night, and still goes out of his way to cook breakfast because he doesn't want his fiancé to throw a fit."
Draco shakes his head. “I can’t imagine you as a Slytherin.”
“That was one of our guesses, right, mate?” It was Weasley who spoke now, his eyebrows furrowed together. “But you said…” His eyes traveled to Draco. “You didn’t mind.”
Even if it was an utter lack of decorum and social grace, it was what Draco preferred. Then again, it wasn't very hard pleasing him nowadays, especially since the one doing so was Harry and that sort of set the whole standard.
Potter looked at him, startled at his question. Startled by the seriousness of his question. His eyes shifted away. "I… don't think your father is working for the Dark Lord anymore."
“Give that to me,” Potter mutters instead and snatches the pile of letters from Draco’s hand. He turns back to his robes on the other bed, and shoves the letters inside one of its pockets with a grumble. “I’m giving these to Professor McGonagall. Have you read all of them?”
He is warm, a stark contrast from last night, when he had been in England in the middle of a snowstorm. It is warm, the blankets are soft, and Draco is beside and all around him. He lets himself sink into the haze of the early morning.
“I’m s –“ Draco started and then winced at the fact that he almost said the word
He sat up in bed, and it was so abrupt that it made his head pound, but it was hard to care about that right now. His hand leaped to his neck, and Draco didn't know whether to calm down or panic about the gauze wrapped around it.
“It’s
Harry recalls that Astoria’s in sixth year.
And Harry would apologize for what happened next, really he would, because Madame Pomfrey had finally stepped aside and Harry could finally look at Draco and see the angry, red welt marking a path on the pale skin of the side of his neck, from his jaw to hide under the collar of his cloak and if Harry closed his eyes, he could imagine what it looked like before Madame Pomfrey did her fancy wand-waving, bleeding and open and red –
He didn't want to think about that.
As he nibbled on a treacle tart, Harry thought about Snape and how the man must be laughing in his grave right about now at how Harry was suffering at the hands of Advanced Potions. Slughorn was a good teacher, but there were moments that Harry just… had no fucking idea what he was talking about.
Somewhere in the silence and the look of cautious hope in Draco's expression, Harry forced his courage up little by little.
And Draco cuts him off, because he’s ready for this, he’s been ready with these words for so long, and he just needs to try, one last time. “I’m not someone you should be friends with, Potter.”
And it is a sentence obviously made light by the petition of Harry Potter—Gregory Goyle hadn't been so lucky—but three months is still three months and three months is more than enough to be locked in a cage, surrounded by Dementors.
Harry sighs loudly. He has forgotten what it’s like, to have Draco Malfoy be such an irritating git. He almost wants to rise up to the bait. “Pancakes were Fred’s favourite. They haven’t cooked them since… Well, you know.”
The haze disappears.
And it’s weird, how Malfoy has turned into Draco in his head now. Maybe he’s been spending too much time with Narcissa, and it’s weird to call Draco as Malfoy in her presence, or maybe what happened the other night kind of makes him feel like he’s gotten to know Draco more as a person. He’s a little less
The look that Potter gave him was almost one of betrayal. “I’m not…
She flashed him a sweet smile.
"Sod it, Malfoy," Harry replied just as soon. He may miss Draco's companionship terribly but that didn't mean Draco wasn't an arse.
“No. They didn’t.”
Narcissa follows his gaze. “I apologize for the other night, Mr. Potter.”
But then as quickly as that thought had come, he'd think
He was annoyed. Very annoyed. With Potter. But it was weird kind of annoyance. He wasn't annoyed about the blood. He had thought about it long and hard the past three days, and he realized that he didn't really mind what happened in Potter's room. He realized that he was annoyed that Potter was avoiding him. Again.
Oh, if Draco just knew that he was the reason why Harry was agonizing right now.
something – probably an apology – that had Lavender wiping her wet eyes and nodding quickly through her sniffles. She glanced over Harry's shoulder to look at Draco, but after that, she immediately scurried away.
Severus clicked his tongue angrily, before grabbing the front of Draco's robes and hauling him upwards with effort. "You need to get out, Draco," he muttered darkly. "Harry can smell your blood, and it's not making things easier for him."
Harry dumps his cloak on the other bed, and rummages through his robe pockets. “You told me to come.”
To his surprise, she doesn’t look annoyed at Draco’s rudeness like he had expected her to be. In fact, she looks worried, and he is relieved and grateful all at the same time.
planned to, but didn’t expect Hermione to suggest it. Over the past week, he had shared to his friends about his time in the Manor and Draco’s condition. Ron hadn’t been too happy talking about it, but with his best friend and his girlfriend (even his own
And creepy.
He had clutched his blanket to his chest, fervently trying to convince himself that his parents were safe and that his nightmare wasn't true.
Harry raised an eyebrow in confusion. "You didn't answer the ques –"
Harry nodded, grinning.
my superior,” Draco quipped from his position in front of one of the room’s bookshelves.
Harry couldn’t resist anymore. He chuckled.
His legs were starting to cramp.
Harry hung his head guiltily.
Scowling, Draco looked at his hand – and paled.
Harry figured that McGonagall had given the students a good scolding, if their proper behavior was anything to go by when Harry arrived in his first class that morning. Lavender was still shifty though, and kept giving him suspicious glances. Ron sniggered at him and Hermione was oddly quiet. Not so odd since they
“Are you sure your body’s feeling okay, Malfoy?” Potter asked, looking at him once again with concern on his face, as if Draco’s the one with the pale pallor.
Harry rolled his eyes in amusement. It didn't matter who he picked because it was going to be Diggory anyway. "Okay, fine, that oldest Weasley."
Harry pulled back and looked at him incredulously, as if he was out of his mind. “
Then she turned back to the professor and the lecture, and didn't talk to them until they were dismissed.
Harry snapped back as if in shock, his body going stiffly straight. Draco couldn't see his face since Harry had his back turned, but he could see Lavender's. He didn't know what happened, maybe Harry said something or at least,
Harry snorted to himself. That was a first for the day.
Draco raised an eyebrow at him.
Oh. That
Slowly, Draco did.
In front of him, he could see Draco's sharp intake of breath and the minute change in his expression – like his world had just crashed down upon him.
Potter didn’t tell them that the locations usually ended up being destroyed whenever Draco cast the spell upon them. That must have been why Weasley, Granger, and even Kingsley had just let them carry on with their merry mission despite them knowing that Potter had been one of the horcruxes.
Draco nods and does as Harry asks.
"You don't," Harry says, watching Draco carefully.
It takes a moment for Harry to register exactly what he said. When it does, he figures, in for a knut, in for a galleon, and waits for Draco to turn before stepping across the room to stand in front of him. This time, Harry's sure there are no headphones to get in the way, no movies to lull Draco to sleep.
The first thing Draco felt was relief, as though a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He could see Elise Abbott glaring at him from across the room and that was enough satisfaction. But Draco could also see his mother's obvious relaxation as she turned to the women around her with new fervour. It was that that made him angry. He remembered the looks he'd been getting all night, the snide comments he'd pretended to ignore about how he mustn't be as special as everybody seemed to think. It hadn't occurred to him before that moment that his mother might be going through the same things. But now it was obvious and so, when he spoke next, he couldn't quite keep his voice neutral.
"Ready?" his mother asked.
"We need to talk," Draco said, pushing past Harry and into the house.
There was nothing to say to that. It was all Draco had ever wanted, presented to him in the form of a kind, handsome, young man. Still, as Gregory opened the small box and pulled out a simple band, Draco couldn't help but look towards Harry. He stood stock-still on the other side of the room, a stricken expression on his face as Gregory placed the ring on Draco's middle finger. It wasn't an engagement ring, but it was enough of a promise that once word spread, there would be no denying the end of Harry and Draco's courtship.
"I've always known our world was filled with its fair share of idiots," Draco said. "But I never imagined it was this bad."
Harry toys with the cuff of his sleeve. "He's...that is to say...I don't...I've never told anyone I was in love with them before," he falters, looks down at his teacup.
But the night wore on and as more people arrived, it became obvious that Harry wasn't coming. Draco had already said no to two dances by the time Elise Abbott made her way to his side of the ballroom. She was dressed in simple, yellow dress robes that clashed with her bright blonde hair and made her look washed out. Alice, who stood by her side, looking as though she'd rather be anywhere else, was stunning in bright green dress robes decorated with tiny diamonds. She gave Draco an apologetic look and rolled her eyes behind her mother's back.
Gregory noticed him soon after. He took one look at Draco and excused himself from Cormac's presence, walking over to the bottom of the steps. He smiled openly at Draco, his blue eyes sparkling with fondness as he waited. There was a pointed silence from the room as Draco descended, eyes darting between Draco and Gregory then to Harry and back. It wasn't just that Gregory was making an obvious play for Draco's attention. It wasn't even that Draco was wearing Gregory's necklace and everyone knew it. It was that Harry hadn't moved from his spot near the stairs. He stood close enough that he might also be waiting for Draco, giving off the illusion that Draco had a choice, that it was up to him to choose between Wizarding Britain's Most Eligible Bachelor and Gregory Greengrass.
The knowledge spread through Harry leaving him feeling warm and satisfied. To have Draco as his was right. It felt like certainty, like an inevitability. They belonged together. Last night had been proof that Draco belonged in Harry's arms, that he was solid and whole and alive under Harry's mouth. He'd done his best to keep himself in check, to hold back, to make sure that his wanting didn't damage Draco. But last night, Draco had come to him even after Gregory had announced his intentions to the whole room. Even with a ring on his finger, Draco had come to Harry. He'd begged so sweetly for Harry to touch him, had given under Harry's hands, and even if Harry could walk away from all of that, he'd never forget the sound of Draco calling his name as he came.
It was so easy to picture Harry kissing him, to picture himself with his hands in Harry's hair, dragging him closer. What he wouldn't do to get Harry somewhere private, away from prying eyes, away from goddamn proper society. He'd push him up against one of the walls in Malfoy Manor, up against the books in the library, or down on Draco's bed, against the sheets. He'd look good amongst all that green and silver, better still once Draco could get him out of his clothes, once Draco could touch him.
Gregory beamed at him. "You liked it then?"
Draco could practically see Elise Abbott salivating.
"I'm chaperoning," he said, taking her hand with his left so that his wedding band glinted under the light. "Hermione couldn't make it tonight."
They'd been dating something like three months, fitting dates wherever they could, sometimes staying over at either Harry's or Draco's just to get time in. Despite their busy schedules and all the hundreds of things still requiring Harry's attention every day, it'd been so easy to meld his and Draco's lives together.
He swore he could feel the band heating up, the metal sitting heavily on his middle finger. He took a shaky breath, imagining the headlines tomorrow, Lady Red's column speculating as to what had happened between Draco and Harry. He thought of Gregory coming to his home with a proper engagement ring, of planning the wedding, of the party, the endless days to come with Gregory in his bed, by his side, talking to him, living with him, taking up space in his home, in his life. Forever.
"Thank you. It was a gift," Draco said, curtly.
Harry watches him go, fighting back laughter. At the door, Ron turns and waves. Harry shakes his head but waves back until Hermione finally drags Ron away from the door.
"See something you like?" Draco asked, encouraged by the look Harry was giving him. "Or perhaps you've lost something?"
"It's just dessert," Harry says. "What could it hurt?"
"Let them watch," Harry said. "We're just talking."
Draco takes one look at the place and turns to Harry with a raised eyebrow. "Quite a different setup than usual tonight," he says.
"Sidekick?" Draco asks, looking at the iPod and the phone with interest. "Is this why you had Bartholomew kick me out early? He wasn't pleased, Harry, and if I'm terribly bullied for the rest of the year, you will be hearing about it."
"Lumos," Draco whispered.
It's, quite predictably, all Ron's fault. Hermione had shown Ron the movie so he'd shown it to Harry. Then Draco had come over in the middle of the movie and the three of them had watched, until Draco had asked that they restart it. And Ron, being the best friend Harry's ever had, had restarted the movie and had settled back down on Harry's sofa to watch.
They'd made it around to the side where Elise Abbott was standing, her wand out as she transfigured her fan into a picnic blanket. She waved at Draco, her smile mechanical as she complimented Harry on his cloak.
Harry looked for the Weasleys, finding a single clustering of red hair perilously close to Mrs Weasley. He couldn't tell if the Weasleys hadn't spotted their mother or if they had simply given up trying to escape her. As he watched, Mrs Weasley made it to the group, planting herself in front of Percy and to the right of Fred. Ginny startled, immediately trying to blend into the dancing people behind her. But Mrs Weasley was too fast, looping her arm through Ginny's, making the motion seem good-natured instead of intimidating. It was over and the rest of the Weasleys knew it.
Draco narrows his eyes. "Even the ones about the Internet?" he asks.
Harry eyed the people behind Draco then refocused on him. His first glance was quick, nothing more than a confirmation that it was Draco he was talking to. The second glance was longer, lingering on Draco's jewels and his robes, his eyes straying to the exposed skin on Draco's neck before settling on his face.
Draco stood his ground, drawing himself up to full height so that he was just that one inch taller than Harry. They were about the same build, basically the same height. Even if there was much difference in their physical power, they were both wizards, both had wands. Harry would even go as far as to say that he and Draco might be evenly matched.
He takes a deep breath, grabs Draco's face, and says, "I love you."
He steps out of the kitchen and heads back to the bedroom. He pulls out the small piece of parchment from his bedside drawer. He'd talked to Ginny a few days ago and had asked, as vaguely as he could, whether she could help him. Her response had been the little piece of parchment.
"So you know that I hardly get any attention even though I am exactly what everyone is looking for. Good-looking. Highbred. Somewhat rich."
"What was that about?" Draco asks.
Harry was too distracted to hear her and because Draco was not above being petty when the occasion called for it, he said, "Apology accepted, Harry. You know I would never stay mad at you."
Harry thanks her and heads out to the front where Draco's already picked up their cloaks. Outside, they get ambushed by a group of reporters who've been waiting for them to come out of the restaurant, and Draco takes Harry's arm a little too hard as they Apparate. As they're turning, Harry feels the little box slipping so he grabs it tighter, feels the cardboard give under his fingers. He spares a thought for the little mousse cake with its white powdered sugar spelling out, "I ♥ you."
"Mate," Ron says finally, leaning towards Harry. "It really isn't that hard. Just tell him."
"Potter's back," Pansy confirmed. "And if the gossip is true, he's looking to get married."
"Nothing important," he says, leaning forward to give Draco a quick kiss. "What's for breakfast?"
"Are you breaking up with me?" Draco asks.
Harry glanced at the grin on Ron's face. "You're enjoying this too much."
He moved first, of that he was sure. He was the one to close the distance between them, the one to put his hands on Harry's shoulders, to press him back against the hedges. He moved with intent, feeling Harry up against him and continuing anyway, until his free hand met the rough branches at Harry's back. Draco was the one who started it all but it was Harry who tipped them over the edge. It was Harry's fingers that cupped the edge of Draco's jaw. It was Harry's thumb that pressed down on the centre of Draco's bottom lip. It was Harry who pushed until Draco thought his lip would bruise, until he felt Harry's thumb against his teeth and he had to open his mouth.
He could practically see the suitors leaving.
He'd been thinking about it for days by the 6th of September, when it had all sboiled down to a moment of silence as Draco had shut off the TV and had made to stand up. Harry had watched him and the quiet throughout the flat had seemed to highlight Draco standing in front of the sofa. It had felt like contentment at first, that deep sense of everything being right in the world that Harry had felt for the first time after the war. There had been a moment where Harry had inhaled and it had seemed as though everything within him had centred around Draco for a second.
Elise Abbott did her best not to grimace but her mouth twitched as she said, "We were so very happy to hear about Hannah's engagement. And to a war hero, no less. I told Alice that nothing less would do in a family like ours. We have a lot to offer, you see."
It was over.
Draco looked down at his outfit, the sparkling gold chains that adorned his neck and hung in ringlets down the arms of his dress robes. All the golden fabric was sewn with gold thread and everything on him that could be made from real gold was. It was over the top and loud but he had come to Parkinson Manor with one goal in mind and he didn't see any reason to pretend otherwise.
He meant to walk away. That's what he told himself after. He meant to take one last look at Harry's face, at his mouth, at his vibrant green eyes that seemed huge in the shadows. But he took a step closer and Harry stopped running away. He watched as Draco closed the distance between them, his hands balled into fists at his sides. It seemed almost as though Harry was shaking with need, but that was impossible because Harry didn't want anything to do with him. Harry had been the one who pushed and pushed until Draco was left shaking with unfulfilled desire, and when Draco had been ready to push back, Harry had simply walked away. So it wasn't fair that he looked like that. It wasn't fair that he asked Draco to stop when Harry had never stopped before. Not when he wanted Draco as much as Draco wanted him.
"Oh no, Draco," Pansy said. "You misunderstood. I'm not talking about the Weasleys. I'm talking about someone else, a certain well-off war hero, Wizarding Britain's Most Eligible Bachelor, and the object of many rather lascivious fantasies among this lot."
"Mr Potter," she said, holding out her hand. "My name is Elise Abbott. This is my daughter Alice."
Harry stretches his hand out and Draco hands him the iPod Shuffle. It's lighter than Harry expected. He examines it all over for an "off" button and can't find one.
Bulstrode Manor was built into one of the sprawling hills surrounding the area. Behind it, the ocean spray had smoothed away the rough edges of the rocks below, leaving only clean sand and a steep fall downwards. The front of the Manor had steps that led into the second floor of the home and large grandiose arches that broke the front gardens into sections. The first section Draco passed contained a maze on either side. The huge green hedges that made up the mazes were about a metre taller than him and could only be looked over from the balconies on the second floor of the Manor.
Draco had his suitor. Harry had avoided all but the most persistent and shameless of mothers. It seemed like the right time to step away, especially if Blaise Zabini was throwing his hat into the ring for Draco's hand. But even as he thought that, he couldn't help the pang of disappointment that settled in the centre of his chest.
Ron snorts and Hermione rolls her eyes.
He breaks off as he gets a good look at Draco, resting against the arm of the sofa. He has his arms tucked behind his head, his face towards the TV, and he's fast asleep.
It was frustrating and charming, and just exactly the kind of thing that flattered Draco to no end. He hated how much fun Harry was having with their fake courtship, how he was doing everything right and it wouldn't matter in the end. On the bright side, Gregory Greengrass had come back once more that week to pay Draco a visit. He'd brought a silver chain decorated with small emeralds as a gift and had gone for a walk in the gardens with Draco and Narcissa.
There were too many people for Draco to say anything else, too much that he'd never be able to say. There was an agreement between them, a nice buffered distance that meant that Draco had to push down the wild beating of his heart as he turned back to the path.
Harry shook his head, turning to Ron to point out the group. As he did, he caught a glimpse of something shining in the distance, a reflection of light against a polished surface. He followed the glare to its source, a young man with white-blond hair who had his back to Harry. For a moment, the hair didn't register because the man was dressed from head to toe in gold and black. Around his neck, he wore a single gold chain and from that chain hung thinner gold chains that looped down along his black dress robe sleeves, each loop marked by a single white pearl. Gold fabric hung from his shoulders down to his waist, the material cinched at the top and bottom, the creases disappearing behind a gold belt. Elsewhere, gold and black mixed, the materials seeming to attract all the light from the room.
It's good strong black tea with milk and sugar. The proper way to enjoy tea and when Harry makes a comment about it, Ron agrees.
Harry turned to Draco sharply, his eyes roaming over Draco's face. What he saw made his expression soften. Draco could tell Harry wanted to say something else. He'd even gone as far as opening his mouth, the first syllable formed, his tone gentle. Draco waited with bated breath, unsure of himself as his heart started beating hard in his chest. He hadn't meant for his words to be taken seriously, but he could tell there was a moment where Harry believed them. Until Elise Abbott coughed delicately and Harry looked up, frowning as he realised they had an audience.
"Are what?" Harry asks, annoyed that he's, once again, managed to mangle things up.
Pansy looked at him, practically shaking with fury. "Tell me you aren't the type of idiot who would get caught fucking Britain's Most Eligible Bachelor. And by Cormac McLaggen, of all people."
"Careful, Potter," Draco said, leaning closer to Harry so that he could keep his voice down. "Don't let Mother hear you talking like that."
Draco's mouth is hot against Harry's ear as he says, low and wanting, "I want you to choke me."
Harry wakes up on Sunday to the smell of bacon coming from his kitchen. The sun is just starting to rise and the light gets lost in between the London flats. Harry can see the patch of blue sky that promises a good morning but will probably be clouds and rain by midday. He lets himself enjoy waking up a moment longer, the quiet of his bedroom, and that sense of rightness that settles in his chest at knowing that Draco's downstairs.
Draco pulls away, frowns. "What's happening here?"
"But everyone here thinks we are, and you're wearing another man's jewellery."
"What kept you?" Draco asked, not wanting his thoughts to stray to dangerous places. "I expected you to call much earlier than this. You are madly in love with me after all."
They'd stayed an hour after the workday had ended. And Kingsley still hadn't gotten the votes he needed to permanently remove Dementors from the Ministry's List of Acceptable Recruitable Creatures. Training the new Auror recruits for guarding Azkaban was still pending, and no one had come to any agreement over who'd get to keep rotating staff like Draco. There are a couple of people Hermione's going to talk to, some people Harry needs to make nice with, and if they're all lucky, things will be resolved a month from now. Though Harry knows that's being optimistic. He gives it closer to six months with the back and forth between Departments and the constant push and pull of who gets what staff and why.
Draco bared his teeth at her and did his best to turn it into a smile. "I'm sure he's just running late," he said.
He'd never imagined that asking to spend time with Draco's parents would lead to this particular conversation, but the more he thinks about it, the more it makes sense. If Draco had suddenly decided that he wanted to start doing chores without magic, Harry would have been immediately suspicious. There are things neither of them will do unless they absolutely have to and, for Harry, that's willingly spending time with Lucius Malfoy.
Draco watched him expectantly, the silence dragging between them until, finally, with a shake of his head, Draco said, "If you won't marry me, then you'll have to duel me and either way, we will put an end to this."
"What are you talking about?" Draco asked.
"Well, I really should find Ginny," he said.
By the time she was done, Harry and Draco were the only two people in the sitting room, both of them on the couch, alone, as Narcissa walked the last of the visitors to the door.
"We should go back to yours," Draco says in that low, rumbling tone that makes Harry lean forward.
The moment stretches as Harry stands by the kitchen doorway, then it stretches some more as Harry waits for Draco's reaction.
"So," Harry says, starting to turn towards Draco on the sofa.
"I have to go and make sure Mum and Ginny don't kill each other," Ron had told Harry earlier that evening.
"Ron's right," Hermione says. "It's not meant to be something complicated. If you love him, you love him."
He knows what answer he's going to get and so he decides that he might as well go for it. After all, it's not like Draco expects a grand romantic gesture.
He knew he'd never marry. He knew he'd never have children. No one, not even Ron and Hermione, not even Mrs Weasley, would ever change that.
The article turned out to be exactly what Draco expected, speculations about whether or not he was good enough for Harry Potter, what he'd possibly done to lose a match like that. The article did everything but outright call him an idiot for arriving on his own to the Greengrass event. Gregory was mentioned as Draco's consolation prize in a single line at the end.
The breeze blew and brought with it the smell of freshly mowed grass, that faint sweet scent of flowers blossoming, the hint of spring in the air. He inhaled and didn't move, too focused on the way Harry's chest moved up and down as he breathed. He'd walked the same distance as Draco but he was practically panting in the space between them, his proximity making heat spread along Draco's cheeks. He decided he wasn't going to move.
Draco nodded, returning the bow. He expected Harry to go, so he wasn't prepared for the slight pressure on his wrist, the warmth of Harry's hand as he ran his fingers down Draco's palm, turning the movement into a handshake. When Harry finally walked out of the room with Narcissa, Draco realised that neither of them had been wearing gloves.
"It was a mille-feuille, Harry," Draco says. "Pansy was appalled and Mother had very strong words with me afterwards."
He thought of his mother that day, of how she'd looked so incredibly young when he'd called her forth with the Resurrection Stone. She'd been younger than he was at the time, with so much future ahead of her, with so many people to live for. And yet, she'd been denied the opportunity to grow old because the world needed her to fight. She'd been asked to do more than a person should have to, because it was the right thing to do. Because if she didn't do it, who would? Because a good cause was worth the risk.
The words felt heavy in his throat as he spoke them, the air catching in his chest painfully. He needed to get outside, to feel the cool night wind on his face. He didn't wait for Gregory's answer, choosing instead to focus on keeping his steps leisurely. He heard Elise Abbott's congratulations and he stopped only long enough to acknowledge them before continuing. At some point on his way out, he caught sight of Cormac, baring his teeth in a parody of a smile, barely suppressed fury underneath the expression.
They had him cornered but Harry had fought a war and survived. Surely, he could handle a couple of eager mother's wanting to marry off their sons and daughters.
Draco smiled slowly and predatorily. "Oh, Potter, that's only because you have no idea the things I am capable of."
The sudden green light revealed the small enclosure, a shimmering bubble underneath a canopy of trees. The light from Draco's wand seemed to bend around them, distorting the trees and the path outside, as though Harry was looking through water. Above his head, he could just make out the dark sky with its smattering of stars, the bright points standing out in sharp relief through the distortion. There was only enough space in the bubble for Harry and Draco, and so when Harry finally focused, he realised that Draco was within touching distance.
"Should we go?" he asked for the third time that hour.
Draco frowns. "You're being too nice," he says. "Oddly so. Not the usual kind nonsense we both know is annoyingly you. But a sort of strange kindness."
But, really, by then he doubts either of them is too worried about it.
He hadn't expected the way everything had fallen into place, how fast it had become second nature to have Draco in his home, in his life. To see him laughing with Hermione or discussing Ministry bureaucracy with Ron, both of them just a tad too gleeful as they discussed how best to hack away at the incompetency at the Ministry. To have Draco drinking tea from Harry's chipped teacups, putting on the kettle, waving his wand so the dishes washed themselves.
It matters to Harry that those feelings be acknowledged, that Draco knows what he means in Harry's life and how much he matters. There were so very few things Harry had wanted before Hogwarts, before the War, and even after to some extent. It's important for Harry to acknowledge what he has now because he's done so well these past few years, has managed to have this, Draco in his flat, in his living room.
"Madly," Draco confirmed, reaching to take the bouquet from Harry.
Alice took that moment to step forward. She didn't say anything but Draco took the obvious out and asked her to dance. Afterwards, when he'd escorted Alice back to her mother and had made his excuses, he thought back to that afternoon and the necklace currently sitting in his pocket. He'd taken it off because he hadn't wanted Elise Abbott's comments about his obvious favouritism to someone who wasn't Harry.
And in the aftermath of their embrace, neither of them noticed the figure walking away into the night.
They'd moved closer without noticing, enough that when Draco exhaled, Harry could have sworn he felt it.
In the end, he just shrugs helplessly at Draco. "I just didn't want to assume that you'd want to spend all your time with me," Harry says.
"You should," Harry said.
"We could," Draco says. "Or we could go back to The Pheasant."
After the initial disappointment, the Wizarding World had decided that Potter was off on another secret mission, for surely someone as great and as powerful as the Boy Who Lived must have a purpose. Never mind that Potter had abandoned Wizarding Britain in its most vulnerable state, right at the time when they needed guidance and someone to look up to. Never mind that Potter disappearing meant that there was no one willing to speak up for the Malfoys during their sentencing, and no one to say no when they'd been stripped of most of their wealth.
There was nothing for Draco to do except to walk down the rest of the steps, right up to Gregory Greengrass, to smile at his handsome face and meet his kind eyes. He took Draco's hand, seemingly oblivious to the attention they were attracting. Draco could hear the scandalized whispers, the rustle of fabric as people tried to look discreetly at Harry.
"Dress for the position you want," Draco said, shrugging.
"Cheer up," Ron said, clapping Harry on the back. "Just lean back and enjoy the view. Just because you're here to help me chaperone doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself."
Harry let the silence stretch. He'd been gone for years and yet the war had never felt so close as it did then, with the sounds of violins and laughter in the air. Everyone was battle-scarred in their own way, all of them trying to live in a world that had fallen apart and been rebuilt so many times, Harry almost didn't recognize it. Perhaps, it was best that the only thing they had to worry about now was whether or not Draco would find a good match, whether or not Mrs Weasley would get her hands on Justin Finch-Fletchley.
"Wait," Harry says, watching the little box bounce once before coming to a stop, "the cake."
Draco rolled his eyes but the smile at the corner of his mouth was easy to spot. "I don't suppose you've met a Spanish prince on your travels, Potter. I could do with an introduction."
"I—" Harry stops, considers what Ron's saying. "I suppose you're right."
"Now, Pansy," he said, shaking his head. "You know a Malfoy never runs."
Then, without a backwards glance towards Harry, he stepped away into the crowd of people.
"Draco," he said, as though he were surprised.
"Nothing," Harry said, too quickly. He spotted the unimpressed look on Draco's face and winced. "I don't mean to sound…"
The second section contained a small fountain surrounded by lilies in unnatural shades, vibrant greens and blues intermixed with bright oranges and pale pinks. At the edges were golden flowers shining like new metal. Their leaves rustled in the wind, bending the plant almost in half. Even so, the flowers themselves remained unchanged, unbothered by the elements as they gleamed under the moon. They were gold like the flowers Harry had brought on his first visit to the Manor. Gold like the jewellery he'd brought Narcissa, elegant pieces that had gone to her because they couldn't go to Draco. Not when their relationship had been a farce meant to benefit both of them. Harry had always been clear about boundaries, Draco realised, as he continued past the third garden section. It was his own fault that he'd read more into the situation than he should have.
"Why do you keep asking me if I need space?" Draco asks now, his cloak still in his hand.
He couldn't avoid the Manor itself, not if he wanted his and Draco's courting to be believable and so, after buying a particularly expensive bouquet of flowers, he Apparated to just down the road from Malfoy Manor.
"I could hardly wear yours, could I?" Draco said. "You've never given me one."
"I wanted to do something nice," Harry says, feeling oddly cornered.
"There were no Muggles in the countryside?" Draco asked.
Harry eyed the group of young women closest to him. "People are looking at me like they want to eat me," he said.
"You should have been there or you should have sent an owl," Draco said. "It was the polite thing to do after our agreement."
"Oh no," Harry said, picking up the flowers and holding them away. "These aren't for you."
Draco shook his head slightly and she relaxed, turning a smile on Harry. "In that case, I'll walk you to the door."
"Oh," Harry says, inhaling against the sudden pressure in his chest.
Potter needed help.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "And the man to put you there, obviously."
"Draco, I," Harry said, shaking his head. "Don't do this."
Harry frowns, looking back at the screen where people are wrapping Christmas gifts. He thinks of Christmas at The Burrow, of mornings with Ron and Hermione in the Gryffindor Common Room. The Weasleys and Hermione have always been home, have always brought comfort and safety. They're a big part of who Harry is and he can't imagine his life without them. But these days, when he thinks of home, he always thinks of Draco too.
On top of that, Cormac never had a good word for anyone, and he didn't like the Weasleys, which was why Harry said, "Draco doesn't take kindly to unearned intimacies."
"Are you?" Draco asked dryly.
Draco turned fully towards Harry, an eyebrow raised as he met Harry's eyes. "Want me to wear your jewellery, Potter?"
Draco said the last part quietly, as though he was coming to a sudden realization. Harry didn't understand what was happening until Draco moved his hand away from Harry's arm. He took a step back and tucked his hands into his pockets, shoulders straight as he looked Harry in the eye.
"Then explain it to me, Harry."
, before September hit, and Draco had forgotten the name of the best man who declares his love for his best friend's wife.
"Be careful with what you say next, Potter," Draco said, slowly. "You've already agreed to this."
All in all, it takes a good portion of the afternoon to convince Draco that Harry's done nothing he feels he needs to apologize for. After, Harry has to explain to Draco how to send a text message and neither of them is any closer to declaring their love for each other. But, Harry supposes, that's just how these things sometimes go.
When Harry was eleven years old, he found out he was a Wizard, but more than that, he realised that there was an escape from the suffocating walls of Private Drive. Hogwarts had been a revelation. Before he met Ron and Hermione, Harry hadn't known that it was possible to surround himself with people who cared about him. Truly. Unselfishly.
It had seemed somehow important that Harry let Draco know just how much his presence meant to him. To show him or have some way to make it mean more than the casual, "come by mine," and "stay the night." He'd wanted to tell Draco about the ache in Harry's chest that had made it just a little harder to breathe. How Draco's eyes in the sunlight had seemed to look into Harry, how the easy way Draco had taken Harry's cup and kissed him on his way to the sink had sent a shiver down Harry's spine.
"Potter's back?" Draco asked, eyeing the room and spotting the loud Bulstrode cousin heading his way.
Harry shook his head, smiling despite himself as he looked back out at the room. "You owe me," he said for the fifth time that night.
"Oh?" Harry asks.
By the time Draco makes it home, Harry's already laid out Hermione's old cellphone and the handbook that came with it. The model is from 2002, a thick rectangular brick with a screen that slides out and upside down. It'll even make phone calls for the rest of the month because Hermione had switched phone companies before her month was up.
"Who's they?" Draco asked, his voice soothing as he took a step closer to Harry.
But now, as they walked around the park, Harry was thinking of Blaise. He imagined his smooth, deep voice and his effortless charm, how he'd fit right into the Malfoy home. The only pureblood family Harry had known for most of his life had been the Weasleys, and they were as different from other pureblood families as it was possible to be. Harry didn't know what things were appropriate, whether he wasn't pushing his luck by following along for this long with Draco's scheme.
"So you've considered it?" Harry asked, amused at Draco's huff of annoyance.
"It's hot today," he said, not thinking too hard as he pulled off his outer jacket.
He didn't look back as he walked away from the fountain and the sounds of the ball coming from the Manor at his back. He wasn't sure where he was going, only that to remain would mean falling apart. He couldn't stand to hear Elise Abbott congratulating him and he didn't want to see Cormac's face. The man had no decency, always chasing the suitors others rejected. He'd been scrambling from one man to the next, inserting himself where he wasn't wanted. It was more embarrassing than if Cormac had outright stated he would take whatever he could get.
Harry eyed the small gathering in front of him and debated whether waiting was a better idea than trying to reason with Cormac McLaggen. In the end, he decided that it was more important that he maintain appearances. He pushed his way to the front, overly aware of how the looks directed his way turned from curious to assessing. He couldn't help the way he straightened his shoulders and lifted his head, unconsciously trying to make himself seem taller and more imposing. He had more right to be calling on Draco than all the men present and despite knowing that he wasn't truly courting Draco, he couldn't help the slight possessiveness that washed over him as he made his way past the men.
, Harry had said.
This is it, right there, Harry thinks.
"And this will keep the mothers away from me, how?" Harry asked.
"Oh, well, just a thought," Ron says, shrugging.
Harry looked down at the emerald necklace again. Draco could practically hear the gears turning in his head. He followed Harry's gaze towards Gregory and was there to meet his eyes when Harry turned back to him.
Harry stopped to take a breath, the air rushing into his lungs and settling in the centre of his chest. He swallowed and found that it was difficult to do even that. But Draco's hand was still on his arm and his grey eyes watched Harry with no hint of judgement.
Harry tries not to smile. "Using the coffee spoon for dessert hardly qualifies as a fiasco."
Elise Abbott turned her shrewd eyes on Ron and held out her hand. "Mr Weasley, don't tell me you're here unaccompanied."
Neither of them moved, the space between them getting shorter as they shifted closer together. It wasn't intentional, Draco thought as he traced the lightning bolt scar from Harry's forehead, down over his left eye. It was just that now that Harry had mentioned past conquests, it was all Draco could think of. He knew that Harry was strong, that he looked good in black and red, that his smile filled his face and made other people want to join in. He knew that Harry teased when he flirted, and it wasn't hard to imagine how Harry might tease when he seduced, how utterly charming he might be.
Draco hesitated for a moment, his eyes darting back to the group of women under the tree. Harry watched him make eye contact with Pansy and then he rolled his eyes and planted his back firmly to the group of women.
"This bouquet is for your mother," he said.
"Because I asked a waitress to write it on a cake and then I ruined that. One time he actually fell asleep. And then there was the time that—"
At some point the following week, Harry and Draco had been bored and the DVD had still been on Harry's coffee table, so they'd watched it again. That had turned into a constant on-and-off rewatch of the film for the first month they'd been dating. After, there had been two beautiful months free from
"I will," Harry says, kicking his shoes off, glad that the conversation seems to be moving onto safer territory. "If only to avoid whatever this was."
Next to Harry, Ron turned a laugh into a cough.
He shoved the voice out of existence, focusing instead on getting up the last of the steps and into the Manor, keeping close to his mother. She was wearing black dress robes that flared below the waist, the material expanding into a large skirt that trailed behind her. In between the stitches of her skirt were tiny jewels spelt to shine like obsidian. Draco matched her in dress robes that might have reminded him of Harry's usual style, if he weren't wearing Gregory's necklace. It hung around his neck like a weight, the emeralds shining under the hundreds of small lights that floated along the ceiling.
He sighed turning back to the rest of the room. He spotted Gregory Greengrass coming his way and as the whispers around him grew louder, he made up his mind. In one quick motion, he pulled out the necklace Gregory had given him and clasped it around his neck.
Draco's smile is blinding between them. "I love you too," he says, leaning forward to press a quick kiss to Harry's lips.
"What?" Draco asks. "Oh, wait."
"I…" Draco started, not knowing what he intended to say but knowing that he had to move before Harry did something they might both regret. Before Draco let him.
But he must have been done waiting too because his hands tightened in Draco's hair as he finally brought their mouths together.
Dinner at The Pheasant is Ron's idea because he asked Hermione to marry him at the same place and he thinks it's romantic.
Harry says nothing, does nothing, pretends that he heard nothing. Ron, the bastard, looks like he's about to burst into laughter. To his credit, he keeps a straight face at Draco's offended look.
At first, Draco didn't know what to do. He felt as though he'd been punched, the air spilling from his lungs as heat burned throughout his body. He reached out a hand blindly and caught Harry's shoulder, his fingers digging in as Harry kissed him. He could feel his hands shaking as his body focused on all the places he and Harry were touching, on the flash of pain as Harry pulled on his hair, the heat of their tongues, and all the hard planes of Harry's body.
"So, Mr Potter," Elise Abbott said, a slow smile spreading across her face. "Now that it's just us, I'd like to pick your brain on a most interesting matter."
"It didn't quite go as planned," Harry says, feeling mortified and not exactly knowing why.
It's a webpage with a white background and black text under rainbow-coloured titles. The first one reads, "Ten Ways to Show Someone You Love Them Without Saying It." It lists, among other things, making time for them, spending time with them, doing things they love, and spending time with their family. Harry rereads number four on the list twice to make sure he caught it right and seriously considers just forgetting all about it. He doesn't think there's anything wrong with waiting until Draco says it first. But the feeling only lasts a moment and then Harry resigns himself to spending a lot more time with Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy.
He looked so sincere that Harry had to look away, out across the water. He could see a pair of ducks swimming in the distance, the green feathers on their heads shining in the sunlight. He imagined he was standing outside of his country home, watching the sun setting behind the water in the distance. It was hard to hold onto the peace he'd felt in moments like those, hard to remember that he was happier than he'd ever been before in his life because he no longer allowed others to influence the choices he made.
"You're wearing Greengrass's necklace," Harry said slowly.
Draco's only regret in life was that he'd stood on the wrong side of the War, that he'd been too foolish to stop and consider what he was doing. The only thing he'd ever regret was not saying no to his parents when he had the chance. Otherwise, he lived life the way he was taught. He shaped his destiny when he could and accepted the outcomes when he couldn't.
Draco says nothing but he stops moving and Harry remembers their Eighth Year, how many times he'd run into Draco standing at the end of hallways or in abandoned classrooms. How he had a tendency to stare at nothing when he was thinking. How very familiar every one of Draco's quirks is to Harry after all these years. How easy it had been to finally ask Draco out almost four months ago when they'd both been ready.
He loves Draco.
He couldn't get distracted, no matter how attractive the men and women in front of him might be. No matter how much he liked the way Draco had smiled at him in the Parkinson ballroom. Harry had no desire to marry, no will to prove right all the voices that screamed at him about duty. The world wanted him to provide heirs with his name, with his supposed bravery, with his blind willingness to put himself in danger. But Harry had been someone else before the War, before prophecies and destinies, and he was damned if he would let the Wizarding World have more than he was willing to give.
"Draco," Harry says, turning to look at him, finally. "I lov—"
When he was fifteen years old, he buried his godfather and experienced for the first time the pain that came with losing someone he loved. He knew of his parents, knew that they were heroes. But the pain of their passing was an echo of the sorrow that everyone else felt. He'd never known them so he'd never known exactly how to mourn them. Every memory he might have had was gone before he'd even had a chance to save it. Which was why, when he finally learned that he had people to lose, he held on as tight as he could.
"About your dalliances with men."
"I know," Draco said. "You've read Lady Red's pamphlet, I assume. Everyone in Wizarding Britain gets it."
It couldn't have been more perfect, Draco thought, as he watched Harry march across the room to stand in front of his mother. She kept looking between Draco and the roses in Harry's hand, as though she couldn't quite work out what the catch was. Draco smiled at her confusion as Harry took her hand and kissed the back of it.
Draco gives him an odd look but does as he's told. Harry watches him, the careful, delicate way Draco has of untying knots, how he folds the ribbon and sets it on the table. He eases the flaps away from the box and Harry watches his face, waits for the moment Draco reads the message. But Draco looks down and instead of the surprise Harry expects, he looks pensive.
Harry's eyes flickered for a moment to the crowd at Draco's back, the light from the chandelier sparkling in his green eyes. "I would say that while I don't doubt your obvious experience with these crowds, I very much doubt that what you have in mind will be anywhere near pleasant for me."
His suggestive tone of voice caught Draco's attention, and when he glanced back at Harry, he was sitting sideways, one leg folded on the couch, his arm thrown along the back as he leaned in close to Draco. If Draco turned, their legs would touch. If he stretched his own arm across the back of the couch, their fingers might meet. He might feel the knuckles along the back of Harry's hand, the heat of his palm, might feel those fingers along his wrist, sure and strong as Harry took his hand.
Draco pulls out a small blue rectangle with a white circle off-centre. There are four buttons on the white circle and one in the middle. Harry recognises the little thing as Hermione's iPod Shuffle. Her parents had gotten it for her last Christmas and she'd been carrying it around ever since.
The light from their one lamp casts shadows on half of Draco's face and lends a heaviness to his words, something tangible, almost as though Harry can feel them down his back.
Harry can see the suspicion in Draco's eyes, the way he starts looking around the room for traps, or worse, surprises. He can almost see the mental list Draco must be making as he goes through all the important dates he might have missed. Harry lets him stew as the host takes their cloaks and leads them to a table. All around them, Harry can hear the usual hushed whispers as he and Draco make their way down the aisle of tables, the floating bulbs moving out of their way as they go.
Draco turns to the screen almost lazily, his eyes trailing over Hugh Grant in his Prime Minister's office. Draco tilts his head and makes a pensive sound.
"A little trick I picked up from my mother," Draco had told Harry the first time they'd gone shopping together.
The truth was that ever since he'd seen Draco wearing Gregory Greengrass' necklace, he hadn't been able to stop thinking about replacing it with something Harry had bought for him. He imagined a gold chain much like the ones Draco had been wearing at the Parkinson Ball, something discreet that would nevertheless catch the light from the chandeliers and call attention to itself. He'd imagined Draco touching his neck, knowing that Harry had given him that chain, that he was wearing something Harry had chosen specifically for him. If he got carried away, he imagined Draco liking it, imagined his eyes the way they sometimes got when Harry stepped just a bit too close.
