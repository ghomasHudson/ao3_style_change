Draco raised his eyebrows. “Really, Potter? Do your temper tantrums usually work on your little friends?”
“I wouldn’t know,” he scoffed.
“He…how should I know what Potter thinks?” Pansy’s persistence was wearing down on him; that familiar surge of anger flared up.
Sitting back against a desk, Draco wondered how McGonagall might react. Would she come and interrogate Draco herself, or would she immediately call for the Aurors? And what sort of evidence would they need to administer Veritaserum? He wished desperately that he had studied wizarding law. Would his past history as a Death Eater count against him? More than likely, it would. And he doubted very much that Harry would be able to come to his defence a second time. He wondered absently what Nott was doing. He wanted to hate him, but his own aching need to protect his father—no matter what a cowardly, pathetic idiot he was—still nagged at him. In a sense, he could understand Nott’s position. Of course, it didn’t make him any less of a bastard.
“Draco,” Harry said softly. “You at least have to warn him.”
“It’s fine. I’m just about done.”
He ripped open the drawstrings and dumped the contents of his bag onto the ground. Pushing aside
, Pansy,” Blaise scoffed.
“He was right in front of you!” Ron Weasley roared. Great.
“Oh, for God’s sake.” Draco slumped back in his chair and fiddled with his quill. “It was a dumb fight. I just told her—” He broke off, looking over at Daphne. He didn’t want her to know what the others were saying about her and Thomas. “I’m just tired of it, the whole pure-blood nonsense. The Sacred Twenty-Eight, and all that rubbish.”
"It’s freezing out here!” she cried. “Are you both mad?”
“Yeah.” Daphne's kindness was going to undo him; he hurried out of the library before she could say anything else. Heading for the Owlery, his heart pounded ferociously in his chest. He could hardly see the other students around him. At one point, he thought he heard someone calling him, but he didn’t turn back. What was he going to do? Harry had said not to panic. But how could he not? His father was going to be blindsided. Should he try to warn him? How would that be possible? The Ministry was checking the Manor’s post. He had written his father surreptitious letters in the past, but he doubted their mail had been so carefully scrutinized before. It would be incredibly reckless to write. If the Ministry realized what they were up to, he and his father would be in a huge amount of trouble. But what other choice did he have? If he could just warn his father, perhaps there was a small chance his lawyers could intervene. At any rate, he couldn’t just sit around and do nothing.
“That…I never thought of it that way.”
“Tell me.”
“Alright then,” Potter said slowly, scrutinizing him. Draco absolutely hated it when Potter analyzed him like that. He wanted to get back to his dormitory, to sink into his warm blankets and
“I’m fine,” he snapped. “And you still haven’t gotten through my Shield Charm, so I don’t know what you’re boasting about.”
“It’s just that Draco is the best at Potions,” Harry said. Draco had to stop himself from rolling his eyes—he could not have been more obvious. “So I really need his help.”
“Oh, you like me, do you?” Draco drawled, resuming his task of tracing patterns across Harry’s chest. “I never noticed.”
It’s really not that exciting.”
“I’ve just realized,” Nott said happily as he toweled his hair. “I’ve still got some firewhisky left from my last trip to Hogsmeade. We should have a drink, celebrate the end of the term.”
“Transfiguration isn’t my strongest subject,” Potter muttered to him, smiling ruefully as the students split off into pairs. “You’ll have to take the lead on this one.”
“I can’t remember,” he said hoarsely. “Whatever we just saw. I can’t remember. I mean, I can sort of…” Draco squeezed his eyes tightly. “If I really think, I can see the outlines. And I think I can hear someone…but not really. Was it…was it about…?”
“It’s not. Or, if it is, you’re the one encouraging us. Showing us
“What can I do?” Harry asked.
Draco blinked at him. He was at a loss for words. And he wasn’t very impressed with Harry’s ability to say things that threw him off-kilter. Pursing his lips, he took his hand back. “If I keep this ratty thing, you’ll have nothing else to wear. It’s all I ever see you in.”
Reluctantly, Draco pulled his arm away and held it a few inches from his face. “Not really.”
“You’d better fix your hair,” he advised her. “Michael Corner’s just walked in.”
” The lizard looked up at him irritably, but otherwise nothing happened.
Blaise scoffed. “Don’t be cross with me. I’m just relaying the message.”
“Draco,” Theo sighed. “Why do you always do this to yourself?”
Potter hadn’t let go of his arm and, for some reason, Draco hadn’t pushed him away. He felt flushed from the firewhisky. Looking over at Potter, his lips parted, his hair tousled, Draco was mortified as he remembered what they had gotten up to in the Room of Requirement. He had almost come to believe it had been a dream, but the feeling of Potter’s hand around his wrist made what had happened between them seem vividly real.
“You can’t be serious.” Even though his arm throbbed in agony, Draco pushed himself up. The trees around them spun. Finally, he focused in on Harry’s face, and his heart sunk. He had never seen him so distraught. Although it was dark, Draco could see how his cheeks had reddened, how his bottom lip quivered. “Harry. Please. Please don’t cry. After everything you’ve done—think of it, think of
Draco tried, and failed, to come up with a response. Suddenly ashamed, he said, “I don’t know. I’m sorry.”
“Alright. Let’s start.”
“We’re in the kitchens,” Draco said, astounded.
“…plenty of other Death Eaters have sold him out, he doesn’t have a chance…”
“It’s just a cauldron,” Draco muttered. He could feel himself turning red. “Go on, fill it with water. Regular is fine. And then boil the onions for ten minutes.”
“Yeah. But I haven’t been able to practice much. That’s the problem with being captain…I’m so busy telling everyone else what to do, I barely have time to fly.”
“Potter.” Now that he was here, Draco had no idea what to say or do. He shoved his hands into his pockets.
“It’s…it’s the flying,” Draco said. His voice was hoarse. “Ever since what happened in the Room, I haven’t been able to fly.”
“Anyway,” Draco pressed on, pretending that she hadn’t spoken, “you said I need to focus on my N.E.W.T.s. I shouldn’t waste my time at the pub.”
“Oh, yes, Potter,” he scoffed. “Finally, you’ve uncovered my ruse.” Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to his feet, waving Potter away as he leaned forward to help. “I don’t really care much about Quidditch this year, anyway.”
“Of what?” Draco murmured. He cupped Harry’s jaw, stroking his cheek with his thumb.
“Whatever. Can we
“The Wizengamot. They figure Shacklebolt and all the rest will be busy…Christmas Eve, you know…they’ve got a quorum…it was one of the Burkes who told us, I forget her name, her father-in-law is on the Wizengamot…”
he told himself.
“And I won’t laugh at you again. Honestly.”
“My conscience?” He snorted. “That hasn’t been clear for a very long time.”
him. He was tired of me mooning around and said he’d go check it himself.”
Draco was taken off guard by Potter’s question, thrown out as though this was normal for them. As though they regularly discussed their homework, their classes. “Fine,” he said stiffly.
“Well…” Harry placed his gloves on the bench next to him. He sat back and looked out at the field. “I sort of forgot, really. It mostly happened over the summer. And I thought…” He took a deep breath, and then said, “After the Battle, Pomfrey brought it up with us. She’s the one who said we should go, since we’d been through, you know…really awful things.”
“Yeah. I was worried.”
“I’ve heard the rumours,” Proudfoot muttered. “I suppose you’ve heard as well. I really don’t think Shacklebolt will allow it…but one of the witches on the Wizengamot, she was Amelia Bones’ cousin…and you know what happened to her…nasty, nasty business…and so of course she’s out for blood. Plenty of them are, I imagine…lots of people are grieving.”
“Naudiz is…give me a second.” Daphne sat back in her chair. They were in the library quizzing each other. Draco was surprised to find that he had nearly succeeded in learning all of the runes in chapter five.
“In that case, you need to guard the package with your life.”
“Potter. It’s five in the morning. We have class.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” Proudfoot said in a strained voice. “I do
“Well, yes, I understand, but won’t the Ministry be tracking me as well?”
as the trainers fell. Forcing himself not to get frustrated, he tried again; the key was to leave some small part of his consciousness still focused on the levitation spell while the bulk of his mind strayed elsewhere.
“Right. Sorry. And I think I got this one wrong—it should be ‘tree’, right?”
“Forgot something,” he said gruffly.
Irate, Draco snapped, “What? Have I committed a crime? Go on and tell McGonagall, then.”
“I’m fine, Potter.”
Stiff from sitting on the stone ledge for so long, Draco decided to head outside. Most students were in the Great Hall having lunch, allowing him to slip out to the grounds undetected. It had warmed up considerably. Above him, the sky was clear. He spent the rest of the day by the lake, watching as the Giant Squid spread its tentacles lazily through the water. He sat there and thought about his mother, his first friend, and perhaps his only real friend, though that felt rather sad to admit. He thought of her and he wondered what she thought of him.
“Have me, then.”
“Ah…right.” She had already hidden the magazine beneath her textbook. She touched the tip of her wand to the parchment and said, “
Slowly, carefully, Draco forced himself to rummage through his kit. His shaking hands were clumsy; he fumbled as he took out his sieve and a small glass bowl.
“Fuck,” Draco gasped sharply as teeth sank into his shoulder. Potter was laughing.
“We were just discussing our own assignments,” said Nott. He drew himself up as he said, “It looks like I’ll be assisting Professor Flitwick with some very complicated Charms work.”
Potter was clearly embarrassed, which delighted Draco to no end. “Like it, do you, Potter?” he drawled. “I had no idea it would be so easy to get you into bed.”
“God, this is a sad lot.” Zabini eyed the students critically as they left the Great Hall. “I don’t know how you manage, Draco. How disappointing for you, stuck being the teachers’ assistant while the rest of us are actually preparing for our careers.”
areas.”
“My mother.” He snorted. “My parents. It’s them who got me into this mess, isn’t it? Do you know something?” His eyes searched the sky, incapable of looking at her. “Sometimes I hate them. I fucking hate them.”
Harry’s fingers pushed forward, and Draco felt none of the trepidation he had worried might hold him back. Instead, he opened his legs wider, bringing his hands to cover his face as he moaned into his palms. The lubricant ran down in thick rivulets as Harry slowly began to rub at him. With his other hand, he caressed Draco’s thigh. Gradually, he eased in, and Draco gasped as a single digit penetrated him.
Anger flared up in Draco's chest. He wanted to resist, but without his wand, he was defenceless. He threw Nott one last withering look before walking slowly towards the entrance. Nott followed close behind, his wand nearly prodding into Draco’s back as they stepped into the corridor.
“I wanted to ask…” Potter paused, as though bracing himself, and then said, “Have you had any other…flashbacks? Like you did in Defence?”
"Yeah?” Harry gave him a lopsided smile.
“Isn’t it?”
going again. You’ll lose your mind.”
Their nights were not supposed to bleed into their days. Drawing those firm boundaries was the only way he would manage to get through this.
“But why?” Draco asked, frustrated.
Harry snorted. “That could be arranged.”
Cutting him off, Potter read loudly from his parchment: “
“But everything will have to change, then. I’ll have to owl Pansy and Blaise, and tell them not to send my presents here.”
“I’m fine,” he said, waving her away. “We came to say goodbye, anyway. We’re headed back to the Manor.”
As the others discussed the upcoming party, Daphne leaned over and touched Draco’s elbow gently. He jumped. “Are you okay, Draco?”
Draco lay back onto the blanket, drained. He ran his fingers through his hair as he tried to think. “Not really. Something about…sixth year. But I don’t know what.”
“Not bad,” he said truthfully. “Maybe it’s easier, when you’ve already seen the memory before.”
Draco couldn’t think of what to say, so he gave Theo a tight smile and then hurried away.
Draco settled into his usual spot by the lake. The water was choppy, the waves dark and ominous under the low orb of the moon. He sat back, his palms quickly going numb from the ice-cold ground. The grass was crisp with frost; everyone swore it was finally going to snow any day now. Draco wasn’t surprised when he heard footsteps coming up the path. He looked over and was about to greet Potter, when instead he saw Proudfoot walking towards him.
“We’ll get him to bed.” Blaise smirked. “Come on, Draco, that’s enough excitement for one night.”
“Well, then…good, good.” Slughorn clasped his hands. He made a show of peering into Draco’s cauldron. “Alkaline water, boys, don’t forget…” At last, he wandered away.
He stood there, hand still on Potter’s, until the quill floated off the floor again. It hung suspended in mid-air. Draco moved Potter’s hand slightly to the right, and the quill drifted to the right. He then moved Potter’s hand to the left, and the quill soared left.
“He hasn’t got a name yet, so you’ll have to sort one out,” Harry continued. “He’s beautiful, though, you’ll see. And he’s huge.”
He smiled as he felt the rumble of Harry’s laughter. They lay like that, Draco tucked against Harry’s chest, Harry rubbing his hand along Draco’s back, until finally they both drifted off to sleep.
Draco’s chest hurt. It was hard to breathe. He could feel everyone’s eyes on him as he slipped back out through the door and closed it softly. His hands were trembling; he shoved them into his pockets. He absolutely hated fighting. The moment someone turned their anger on him, he felt as though he would crumble to dust. He had spent too many years listening to people shouting, knowing that at any moment the argument could turn deadly. Head bowed, he hurried down the corridor, nearly reaching the bend when he collided into someone.
“I guess—I guess fifth years to be able to do their O.W.L.-level spells, seventh years to be at N.E.W.T. level, and sixth years…on their way to N.E.W.T. level?” Potter guessed. Draco snorted.
“That’s not a very Malfoy thing to say, is it?” Harry asked, the corner of his lip twitching. “Aren’t you Slytherins supposed to be resourceful? You’ve got Harry Potter in front of you, to use however you want, and you’re not jumping at the chance?”
” They were shrouded in darkness. Instantly, he relaxed, even as he felt the familiar press of Harry’s wand against his arm.
Harry swept away the snow with a few twists of his wand. He conjured a large, thick blanket for them—Ravenclaw colours, perhaps in honour of their guest—and they sat down. If Lovegood thought it was odd, to meet them at this time of night in the Forbidden Forest, she didn’t show it. Instead, she turned to smile at Draco, who felt as though he was being appraised.
“So you’re just going to give up?”
Draco was at a loss for words. His heart sped up when Potter gave him a lopsided smile. He knew, vaguely, what was happening, and he cursed himself for it. Pushing the thought from his mind, Draco jumped up so suddenly that Potter startled.
Looking to change the subject, he asked, “What’s happening with your…music…thing?”
“Er, no,” he lied. “My friend…he really enjoyed it.”
Harry glanced at Draco, his brows furrowed in worry. “But you think it went well, today? You think I have a chance?”
As he slowed down, Harry seemed reluctant to pull out. He blinked at Draco for a moment, reveling in the bliss that Draco himself was basking in, until finally he pulled away. He reached over once more for his wand, and with a sharp flick cleaned them both.
Harry took his arm in hand, as he had countless times before, and gently pushed up his sleeve. Even in the dark of his father’s study, the pitch-black Mark stood out sharply against Draco’s pale skin. The hideous skull seemed to taunt him.
Callidus held out his leg, allowing Harry to fasten the envelopes with a bit of string. He nipped at Draco’s finger affectionately before gliding out into the night. They watched in silence as he soared across the grounds, quickly disappearing into the dark sky.
He nodded mutely.
“Theo,” he gasped, catching himself on a desk. “This is mad. I’m telling you—this isn’t going to help your father. Listen to me.”
“That…that doesn’t mean anything. We’re just friends.”
“What?”
“Maybe you should see Madam Pomfrey.”
Pansy was sitting on the sofa closest to the fire. The room was almost empty.
finding the time?” said Nott. “We’re here to study for our N.E.W.T.s, aren’t we? What do they expect, that we’ll have time to provide free labour around the castle as well?”
Harry must have sensed his trepidation, because he jumped to his feet and strode over. “Hey,” he said, a soft smile on his face.
I don’t want a repeat of that—of that year.”
“I've gotten you all riled up, I see,” Draco taunted him, shifting to sit in Harry’s lap. Instantly, Harry sat up, pulling him into a kiss. Draco could nearly weep for need. While he had anticipated this moment, he hadn’t expected the thrill that passed over him whenever Harry moaned into his mouth, or the gymnastics his stomach executed when their eyes met. His head was full of nothing but
“I know that.”
“Maybe,” Pansy said doubtfully. “You’re
“Your…” Potter faltered.
“Tell me to go, and I’ll go.” Potter’s hands had strayed to his buttons; he popped the first one, and then the second, and then the third. Pushing aside the thin material of Draco’s school shirt, he ran his fingers over the small expanse of skin he had revealed. Draco pulled up Potter’s jumper; without comment, Potter held up his arms, allowing Draco to reveal the black t-shirt he was wearing underneath. He chastised himself for being so nervous—he wasn’t exactly a virgin on his wedding night. But for some reason, standing in front of Potter like this, he felt incredibly vulnerable. It terrified him.
“Dunno. Pick a date.” Potter—Harry, now, he supposed, damn him—thanked Madam Rosmerta as she finally found a spare moment to pass him a glass. As they wove their way through the crowd, he said in a low voice, “Maybe last Tuesday when we snogged so long during your free period that I almost missed Charms?”
“What is it?” Harry asked at once.
The grin left Harry’s face. “You said you wanted to be alone. I don’t want to…If you need space, I want you to have it…”
“Yeah.” Draco took a deep breath, and then said, “Can I see it?”
. I wasn’t thinking.”
“You don’t like blokes,” he said. He couldn’t help himself—he reached out and rested his hands on Potter’s chest. “So then…what…?”
“Ask Draco,” Pansy muttered. He swore he could see tears forming in her eyes.
These were the moments when Draco was grateful for the training he had received under his father’s tutelage. He kept his face carefully disinterested, following the two girls as they wound up the path. In a bored tone, he asked, “What do you mean?”
“I know.” Draco couldn’t help the excitement in his voice—if Pansy could see it, too, then he wasn’t just imagining things. “It’s so much lighter than it was.”
“She’s alright, though, McGonagall,” Pansy argued. “She won’t just stand by and let them—”
Draco grunted in agreement.
“What the hell am I going to tell everyone I’m doing for an hour?” he asked.
Draco pursed his lips. He knew Harry was trying to convince him, and he didn’t much fancy being convinced.
“You looked busy.”
He never had much to say during Transfiguration. Pansy and Blaise kept up a constant stream of conversation, nattering on about their relatives in far-flung places. For his part, Draco listened absently, watching as the mouse he had transfigured from a toad sat atop his textbook and groomed itself. He leaned forward, resting his chin on his crossed arms, as the little gray mouse wiped its face. Carefully, Draco held out his hand; despite himself, he felt the corner of his mouth twitch as the mouse sniffed along his palm.
“Still, someone should tell him,” Daphne said reasonably. “Or at least check on him. He’s always up in your dorm.”
“Because, if you…if you start…I’ll never be able to…” He shook himself. “Keep practicing your Occlumency. You need to keep practicing. Otherwise, all of this was for nothing.”
“You take it so good,” Draco said as he began to thrust into Harry’s mouth again. He pulled out so far that the head of his cock brushed Harry’s lips, before sliding in easily again, slowing down so as not to overwhelm him as he went as deep as he could. Harry moaned—loudly, so loudly, not caring who might hear them—and Draco made an incredible sound in response, a sound Harry would pay thousands of Galleons to hear again. “God, I love you on your knees. Harry Potter, on his knees for me. I wish everyone could see you now.”
“Imagine if you hadn’t lived,” Draco croaked. “Plenty more people would have died…who knows what he would have done with me, with my parents…and you…”
“Fantastic,” he muttered, trying to flatten the wayward strands as best he could. “Right, I need to go.” He suddenly felt awkward—after what they had just done, would it be rude to walk out like nothing had happened?
“I mean, I imagine so.” When Potter frowned, Draco said, “You really want me at this bloody Quidditch match. Why? Are you planning something horrible? Revenge for what I did in third year?”
Blaise leaned over, consulting his textbook. “Bladder and urinary tract infections.”
“Right, here we go.” She fanned the cards and held them out to him, face down. “Pick just one for now.”
As they turned down the lane, Draco studied the moving photograph. Potter’s hair was as unruly as ever, and his discomfort at having his picture taken was evident. For a moment, their eyes met, and Draco blinked in surprised as Potter winked at him. Embarrassed, he hastily shoved the card into his pocket. Bloody thing. Fortunately, nobody had noticed, as they were discussing loudly whether a bright green bean would be olive or bogey flavoured. Finally, Daphne agreed to nibble the end of it, and she announced happily: “Sprouts!”
“Peppermint,” Draco said. Sitting cross-legged on his bed, he poured over the magazine, watching as Oliver Wood soared across the page. “Did you see Wood’s in here? They’ve got a feature on Puddlemere.”
Draco looked up as though he hasn’t noticed him there. Giving an exaggerated sigh, he said, “It’s that time, is it? Lucky me.”
“Sure,” Theo said, returning to the book in his hands. He sounded amused. As Draco turned away, Theo called, “Oh, and Draco? You should tell Harry. You really should.” When Draco glared at him, he added, “I know people have let you down. But I don’t think he will.”
“I’m sorry, Draco, I’m sorry…I know…I know…”
“Where do you keep your bowls?” Weasley asked. Potter pointed to the cupboard closest to the refrigerator. Weasley made to reach for the knob when he hesitated. “Oh, this door’s broken. Why haven’t you fixed it?”
“It’s weird,” Nott went on. “I don’t think I’ve seen so much of him the entire time we’ve been at Hogwarts. Everywhere we go, there he is.”
“Yes,” Pansy said breathlessly. “Yes, what a good idea. You don’t mind, do you, Theo? We won’t be long.”
“Come, come,” he beckoned, motioning to a chair set opposite him. He noticed Draco surveying the room and grimaced. “My new office, as you can see. The Headmistress insisted I be down in the dungeons with the Slytherins now that I’m their Head of House. Of course, Professor Snape’s tastes were not like exactly my style, and so…” He waved his hand vaguely. “Horribly cramped, as you can see, and the Headmistress will
"I haven't the faintest idea." Trying to appear as casual as possible, Draco opened his trunk and gently tucked his satchel in-between his textbooks.
“Draco, how are you finding your internship?” Granger asked in a high-pitched voice. “Are you interested in teaching?”
As they arrived in the entrance hall, Draco made for the staircase, but Proudfoot gently took his elbow and steered him towards the dungeons. “To your common room, I think. Lead the way.”
“This is brilliant, Kreacher,” Harry said happily.
“Draco, you would know everything about Bradley’s build, wouldn’t you?” Zabini sneered.
Draco reached out and placed his hand on Pansy’s arm. “Go away for a bit. Not to London. Further. Blaise wants to travel to North America.”
“See you tomorrow,” he said flatly. Pansy reached for his hand, but he evaded her and left before he lost his temper.
“Right. Sorry. The point is, he did really nasty things. I was so ashamed when I found out. I guess because I never knew him, and everyone speaks so highly of him, I just thought there was no way he could do something so cruel.”
“That’s for another time.” Harry pressed a firm kiss to the top of his head. “You, now. Tell me.”
“Oh, don’t start,” he snapped. “I’m already sick as it is. I don’t need your sympathy.”
“My God, have you always been such a worry-wart?” She laughed. “We’re of age now. What are they going to do? Send us back to our beds? Anyway, we’ll be careful.”
“I thought I’d never escape,” that slow drawl continued. “Father just kept going on and on…and I had to nod, and smile, and agree…Meanwhile, I kept thinking of you. I try to stop myself, but I can’t.”
"That’s because she’s hoping we’ll make a match someday.”
“I should think so! Scorpions are quite scary, aren’t they? But they have to be, to protect themselves. They don’t want to fight, either—they’ll hold off as long as they can before attacking.” Giggling, Daphne added, “I thought for sure it would be a snake.”
“It’s nothing,” he lied. “Go on to the party.”
Despite himself, Draco recoiled as fear flooded through his body. If the Wizengamot decided to use Veritaserum on him, he was doomed. He had escaped Azkaban once, thanks to Harry, but he doubted he could manage it again. And what if they decided to use the Dementor’s Kiss on him?
“What, then? Are you staying at Hogwarts for Christmas?” she asked, frowning at him.
“Reckon Slytherin has a shot, Draco?” Nott asked.
Where Harry’s fingers had been grazing across his skin, they suddenly stopped. “You’re shaking. Why are you shaking?”
“Let me do it,” he said, eyes fixed on Draco’s hand as he slowly pumped his cock. “I can do it for you.”
“Here, let me,” Potter said. Before Draco could protest, Potter had his arm around his waist, supporting his weight.
He jerked the note away from her. “The usual.”
“I’m going to touch,” Harry said. “Just touch, that’s all. Okay?”
It was a beautiful, clear night. From the Owlery, they took a moment to gaze out the window, noting Hagrid’s distant figure as he traipsed out of the Forbidden Forest. Callidus perched on the window ledge, eating biscuits out of Draco’s hand.
“I’ve told you before, I’m mad for you," Harry said. "And I keep telling myself this has been a big mistake, because if something were to happen to you, if I were to lose you…”
“She asked me to go to Azkaban. Just like I said she would.”
A few more tears trickled down Draco’s face. He allowed them to. In the cover of the darkness, he felt safe. They sat like that for some time, Draco absently aware of Harry humming to himself. He wondered what his mother was doing. If she was at the Manor, whether she had redecorated or not. And, very briefly, he allowed himself to think of his father. Alone in Azkaban, with only the Dementors for company. He told himself that he didn’t care.
“Right. And why did you look ready to faint?”
of all people?” Zabini stared at him.
“What are they?” Seamus asked, his face wary.
in the common room. It would be so easy to stay there and to climb back into Harry’s lap. He gave a defeated sigh. “We’re going to do this, aren’t we?”
“That must be what I did wrong,” she moaned. “God, I’m so stupid.”
“Of coming back and doing all this? I’ll do whatever mum wants to make her happy, yeah, but once I’ve left…” She trailed off.
“S’not.” Potter was starting to trail feather-light kisses down his neck, and Draco knew he had to get out of there or he would lose his resolve completely.
“You don’t!” he shouted. “You don’t fucking—you don’t—stop it.” Seething, Draco shoved his wand back into his pocket and pushed past Harry. The anxiety lurched in his chest as he made his way back to the Slytherin common room. A small part of him hoped that Harry would chase after him, would stop him and hold him and reassure him that everything was fine between them. But he didn’t. And so Draco threw himself into bed, tearing the curtains so violently around himself that he heard a sharp rip. He barely managed to cast an Imperturbable Charm around his bed before cradling his head in his hands and allowing the sobs to wrack his body. He was reminded once again how utterly alone he was.
“I might.”
. It’s too much.”
“Yeah. I’ll have to fuck you in every room in the castle,” Harry muttered against his lips before pulling him in for a kiss. Draco's knees nearly gave out. Kissing Harry felt new every single time—he didn’t think he would ever get used to the shiver that passed through him whenever they touched. As Harry deepened the kiss, weaving his fingers through Draco’s hair, Draco felt himself growing hard. Reluctantly, he pulled away, pressing their foreheads together as he gripped the back of Harry’s neck.
“Theo,” Pansy asked timidly, reaching out to touch his hand. “She doesn’t…she doesn’t turn, does she? Into a…?”
“You probably don't even need to sit your N.E.W.T.s. You could be Minister for Magic, if you wanted. But McGonagall and Proudfoot said they couldn’t place you. Why?”
“Why won’t you just let it be?” he raged on. “Do you know what my father’s done, Potter? How many people he’s tortured? Killed?” Draco gave a bitter laugh. “If they want to give him the Dementor’s Kiss, let them. He’s earned it.”
Draco raised his eyebrows. “You’re a Gryffindor, so I’ll assume that using your status as the Chosen One and threatening someone’s father with Azkaban is beneath you.”
“Investigations?” Weasley asked. “My dad was saying they’re really overworked right now, trying to find all of the Dark wizards and witches on the run since Voldemort died. It’s supposed to be all hands on deck.”
Ignoring his barb, Harry scooted down lower onto the bed, his eyes drifting across Draco’s body. In spite of himself, Draco was suddenly self-conscious. Harry gently pushed his knees apart, settling between them. They both seemed to hold their breath as the reality of the situation hit them. After hesitating for a moment, Harry began to circle him with two fingers. He glanced up at Draco's face before slowly, luridly, taking his cock into his mouth. Within minutes, Draco was whining in frustration. Harry kept his touch feather-light, occasionally dipping his fingers deeper before drawing out again. All at once, Draco was startled by the realization that those were
“Harry,” Draco said suddenly. “Do you think we should try to alert Shacklebolt? Or…or anyone who might help? We should have asked Pansy and Blaise to send an owl.”
“Wait.” Draco massaged his temples; a headache had started to erupt. “How did you get into the Gryffindor common room?”
!” From the tip of his wand, a silvery stag burst forth, trotting around the gathered students as they clapped.
Pansy looked skeptical. “Really? She probably misses you, you know.”
“You…we don’t…” Draco struggled to put into words what he was feeling. Finally, he said quietly, "Happy birthday."
“I can’t,” he whispered. “I really, really can’t.”
Theo shrugged. “You kept looking at him. He kept looking at you. The only time he spoke was when Pansy brought up Slughorn, and he was angry for you.”
“I’ve told you,” he said angrily, "you don’t. You think you know me, but you don’t. You see me how you want to see me, and look where that’s gotten us.”
“Still not green, though, I see.”
“Why are you leaving? Let’s have a drink.”
“I’ve said I’m sorry.” Potter scowled at him. “But you’ve done loads of things, too, really awful things, but I’m not sitting here asking you to go through all of them and apologize.”
“Am I?” Draco asked, surprised.
“Correct.”
“Liar,” Nott spat. “Hand it over.” When Draco refused, Nott cried, “
“Spellwork, Proudfoot said. I guess a lot of them need practice sessions after…everything that happened last year.”
“I—I didn’t—it was all Harry—I didn’t really—”
Silently, Blaise picked the string off the floor and passed it to him. If the owl was aware of his reply—owls couldn’t read, could they?—it gave no sign; it gazed down at him imperiously as he tied the scroll back onto its leg. With one final nip in Draco’s direction, it finally took off, knocking over a basket of bread rolls as it went.
“No,” Harry said. “It wasn’t really important—just Sirius and I cleaning stuff at Grimmauld Place, having a laugh, you know—but I stopped Hermione before she could erase it.”
“Right.”
“Draco,” Harry breathed, shoving his wand into his pocket and then hurrying towards him. “Draco, are you hurt? Are you alright?” He must have forgotten that Daphne was there, because he gripped Draco’s arms, checking him over, before pulling him into a suffocating embrace.
“Please,” Draco cut in. “I’m tired. Blaise won’t mind.”
Potter had pushed him down onto the mattress so sharply that white spots burst behind his eyes. They grappled for a moment—Potter seeking dominance, Draco pretending to resist him—until finally Potter pinned his hands down so tightly that his wrists burned. He wanted to tell Potter to slow down, to relax, to be gentler with him, but he was cut off by the insistent voice in the back of his mind urging him to take it. As always, he wondered idly where all of this fury and nervous energy went during the day. When the sun was out, Potter was positively placid; those few times when he allowed himself to be provoked, he cut Draco so sharply that his anger boiled over before it could really do damage. Once the sun set, he was a different person entirely. Draco liked the thought that only he got to see Potter like this: the physicality of their nights was theirs alone to explore.
just come with me?”
“Us both?”
“We…we were in the changing room,” Draco said. He wanted to look away, but he knew Harry wouldn’t like that. “And Nott was there, but then he left…and I was cleaning my clothes, and I sort of knew…knew what would happen…” He tried to decipher Harry’s impassive expression. “And we, er…we kissed. Without…much clothes on.”
“I—yes.” He supposed there was nothing for it.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“And you don’t want to erase this one, Draco?” Granger asked, peering over at him.
” He knew that he was at Potter’s mercy—that he needed to be calm, reasonable. But it was almost impossible to douse the anger swelling up inside him.
“You go first,” said Potter. “In case someone’s around.”
“Yeah.” It burned as Harry went deeper, but he adjusted himself on the sheets, taking a deep breath. Harry slipped out, almost withdrawing entirely, and then pushed back in again, and it was smoother this time. The ache gave away to a sense of fullness that Draco tried to breathe around. A few more strokes, and it was better, now: the pain edged into pleasure.
His father gave a shaky exhale. “I suppose it will all be over soon, anyway. What time does the train leave on Tuesday?”
He shook his head and accepted his cup before passing Harry his. It was silent as they drank.
Draco shrugged. “You know that Daphne Greengrass and Dean Thomas are dating?”
“Right.” Potter seemed intent on acting as though this was normal, as though it wasn’t strange at all for them to be crammed together in the Reference Section, let alone speaking to each other. “So, what were you thinking?”
“Good luck,” he heard Goldstein call faintly.
“Even this?” Draco had held up a jeweled egg—shaped in periwinkle enamel and encrusted with rose-cut diamonds, it had belonged to his great-great-grandmother.
“But anyway, he’s your father, Draco. And I know what he did at the battle. I heard he was looking everywhere for you…him and your mum…people said your parents weren’t fighting at all…they were asking around for you...”
“My parents will probably find me some distant cousin in France,” said Pansy, making a face. “They’ve given up on you, of course. Ever since…”
“I haven’t brainwashed anyone,” he argued. “And I haven’t dropped anyone, either. Blaise, Theo,” he said, looking around the table, “I’m sure you both heard the same drivel at home. About pure-bloods and Muggle-borns and all that.”
Potter looked back at him, surprised. “Yeah. We are.”
Harry arched his back up gently, preening at those words. The restraints dug into his wrists, but he hardly noticed.
“I just wish I’d known. Maybe I could’ve stopped it.”
“He put a lot of stock into what Harry had to say.”
His mother sent him an angry letter and he skimmed through it, unbothered. Even though he was distracted, he managed to finish his homework on time. In class, Slughorn praised his Ageing Potion. Pansy checked his temperature several times. She was convinced that he was ill. But he wasn’t. He was happy.
“Okay,” he whispered.
“Oh, for God’s sake, Potter,” he snapped. “Look. Start with your jaw. Let it loosen. Then your shoulders; let them drop. Now your arm. It’s far too tense. You don’t want to lose all your control, but you need to relax your arm. Keep your wrist flexible. Stop holding your wand like someone’s about to take it from you.” He watched as Potter loosened his grip. “Right. Now your legs. Look how you’re standing. We’re not dueling. And the only thing you should be thinking about is Lumos. So clear your mind. That is, if there’s anything in it to start.”
“Yes. And I’ve told them that. But they’re still furious with me.”
Draco shrugged. “I’ve read this chapter twice now, and I still can’t remember anything.”
“Let’s sit,” she said as though she hadn’t noticed. They settled into the sofa; it was quite springier than their last one. “I think I’ll get us some tea. And I’ll put your trunks upstairs while I’m at it. Would either of you prefer coffee? Something stronger?”
Draco had no idea how long they stood like that, exploring each other with almost all their clothes on. They took their time, Potter tracing Draco’s lips, his jawline, his neck; Draco slowly rubbed his hands along Potter’s back. He had to admit that the firm expanse of Potter’s shoulders was particularly captivating to him. He kept smoothing his palms down Potter’s arms, noticing every time Potter groaned low in his throat. Finally, he couldn’t take it anymore; he was positive Potter knew what those noises did to him. He pushed their lips together, and as Potter moaned into his mouth, he would have smirked if he wasn’t so nervous, so aroused. They kissed slowly, gently. Draco had known Potter for years now, and yet he felt urgently that he needed to learn everything about him, to learn the taste of him, the smell of him, the soft noises he made.
“Do you remember what Luna said? At the pub?”
Harry, Draco soon realized, was everywhere. He was in Potions, pretending not to hear as Slughorn droned on about his many merits. He was in Transfiguration, openly grinning when Draco was the first to transfigure his bat into a meerkat. He was in Herbology, standing so close to Draco that their arms touched, muttering to him that his shoelace was untied. There had been nothing suggestive in Harry’s voice, nothing at all, and yet Draco had gone bright red and been unable to respond. And then Harry was at dinner, listening to Weasley and Granger as they nattered on, absently dragging his spoon through his soup. Whatever Harry did, Draco couldn’t seem to look away. It felt like the most natural thing in the world, falling back into his habit of scrutinizing Harry’s every move. And whenever Harry looked back at him—which happened, in his estimation, fairly often—he was disgustingly giddy all over again. He suspected that he was beginning to look an awful lot like Blaise whenever he allowed himself to glance over at the Gryffindor table, but he couldn’t seem to stop. It had been ages since he’d been in such high spirits.
Daphne was unbothered. “Come on, Draco,” she said gently. “Let’s get you to the Room of Requirement.”
“You have no idea what you’re talking about,” Draco said. Avoiding their gazes, he rolled his quill between his fingers, urging himself to stay calm. He didn’t want to shout at them again. Of course, that wasn’t easy when they insisted on prying.
Draco’s spirits sunk further as he saw Harry following Proudfoot, looking as unhappy as he felt.
Harry untangled their hands, and Draco was about to reach out for him again when he felt nimble fingers working on his shirt buttons. One came apart, and then a second, and then a third, and then a fourth. And then Harry’s warm hand was reaching in to drag across his chest. Draco mumbled something he himself couldn’t decipher. Harry kissed down his throat, past his collarbones, and then along his chest, pulling Draco’s shirt aside as he went. Draco’s hands came up to twist within Harry’s messy hair. He tipped his head back when Harry bit down, pulling away and licking tenderly before it could really hurt. And then he was sucking at a spot just above his nipple, and Draco was so hard it
it. Thought it was funny. Got off on it. Then it started getting…bad. He fucked up at the Ministry. The Dark Lord…he was getting impatient. And so he asked me to…he wanted to get back at my father, figured he’d punish him, you know, and it would’ve been too kind to just off me…so he used me, strung it out, and I think my parents knew I’d probably die in the end.”
“Anything you need to say to me, you can say in front of Harry.”
Lowering his voice, Draco asked, “You don’t think something’s happened, do you?”
“I haven’t got her,” Nott said from the sofa.
“Nothing.” Draco shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “I haven’t done anything.”
Draco looked up to consider Greg. His plate was almost empty save a thin slice of roast beef. Pansy must have noticed, for she placed her hand on his arm and said, “Go on then, Greg, that’ll hardly fill you.”
“I’m trying. I keep telling myself we’re almost at the end of term.”
“I’m worried it’s…it’s the Mark, or…”
“And?”
Potter gave him a quizzical look. When Draco said nothing, he added: “I’d do it again. So…don’t be upset. Because I’m not.”
But Potter had already sauntered over to his friends. Draco was surprised to see that a large number of students had shown up. Most of them he recognized. He nodded curtly at a group of fifth-year Slytherins standing together by the front of the room, and made his way over to his fellow eighth years. Greg, he noted, was not with them.
Draco couldn’t be bothered to ask what he meant—he was uncomfortably aware of everyone’s eyes on them. “Back to work,” he repeated before walking away. Slowly, the students resumed their drills, and the room eventually filled with the sounds of hexes being flung and Shields being cast. Draco stood off to the side, watching them as he tried to force his features into a look of detached boredom. He knew Potter was staring at him, but he stubbornly looked away, focusing instead on Abbott as she broke through Goldstein’s Shield.
people.
“I don’t know. And what will your friends say, when they find out? Your Weasleys?”
Ignoring his barb, Potter asked, “What did you start with? Which spell?”
“Yeah.” A little smile appeared on his face, tugging at the corners of his mouth. “You’re still my friend, though, even if we
He snorted. As she snapped her organizer shut, Daphne looked over at the others, who were ambling out of the common room. “Draco,” she said in a low voice. “Can I ask you something?”
"Good, sir. I’m not as far back as I thought I would be, so…it’s been going well.”
“Order trick…I’ll show you sometime…here, come on.” Finally, the lift had arrived. They stepped aside and Harry began pummeling the button for level nine. Slowly, the grille closed, and they heard the sharp rattle of chains as they descended.
Draco nodded. He did remember. Vaguely.
He nodded. “The common room was empty.”
“What?” his father squinted angrily at him. “What does it matter? We’ll be gone in a few days. Your mother keeps asking me whether you’re coming with us or not. Have you decided?”
Thanks for reading, and take care.
“Dunno.” He shrugged. He could feel Pansy’s eyes on him as he said, “Maybe he’s tailing me again this year.”
Draco opened his mouth to argue, but Harry spoke first: “I know he’s scared. But this isn’t any better.”
“Copy off mine,” Blaise said, reaching over to snag the Sports section from Pansy’s
And what about himself? Who was going to hire him? Where would he live? He couldn’t bear the thought of going back to the Manor after he left Hogwarts. The place stunk of death. He wished his parents would just set the Manor and its gardens on fire and let it all burn to ashes. Maybe that would stop the screams that haunted his nightmares. And that was another thing—his nightmares. When would he start feeling normal again? Did everyone else feel like this? Was everyone as affected as he seemed to be? Was he just weak? Or was this a fitting punishment for all those times he hadn’t refused his father, hadn’t refused the other Death Eaters, hadn’t refused the Dark Lord, had joined in even when he had started to question everything. But he had saved Potter, hadn’t he? He had lied in the face of his aunt and his parents, hadn’t he? Did that absolve him? Who was keeping track? Who judged these things? And Potter. Bloody Potter. Why had he kept his old wand? Why was he being so…civil? Why had he come back to Hogwarts at all? Surely the Ministry was ready to offer him any job he fancied. He could probably be Minister in a few years. So why come back to Hogwarts, especially since following the rules and studying had always seemed beneath him?
“I’m telling the truth,” Pritchard said flatly, turning to Draco. “Whatever she says, that’s not how it happened.”
Looking to buy himself time, Draco said, “Tell me how you know."
Well, that was it, then. He must have finally gone mad. None of this could possibly be happening.
“I…” He trailed off and looked out the window. It was a bright, sunny day; he watched as a flock of birds soared across the sky. “I think I’ll travel for a bit. Get out of Britain…get out of Europe.”
Draco spoke first. “Is it—what’s wrong?”
“I don’t want to push you.”
opened my presents Christmas eve. It’s a Malfoy tradition.” Harry ducked his head, and Draco suspected he might be laughing at him, but he continued on: “We’ll need to pack. And I can guarantee my mother won’t let us go first thing in the morning—you’ll see. First, she’ll want us to stay for breakfast. Then, she’ll bring out the photo albums. She does that every single time I have friends over. Then, she’ll want to show us some new piece of furniture she’s bought, or some new painting. We won’t be back until dinner.”
“Where did you find that?” Draco hissed, lunging towards him. Harry jumped as Draco ripped the vial and pouch out of his hands.
“Everyone’s staring,” Draco grumbled, and it was true: the dining hall had filled with whispers as people craned to have a look at them.
“Are you going to explain to me what’s wrong?” he snapped. Her grip on his arm was painful.
Draco hummed in pleasure. He didn’t think he could speak, not when Harry was drinking him in like that.
“Don’t,” Harry breathed, so quietly that Draco almost didn’t hear him. In the dark he looked ethereal, almost like a ghost.
“What! And you two have managed to just go on as friends, as though nothing happened? It isn't weird at all?”
“Anyone with eyes could see you didn’t just
“He’ll just find another way out,” Draco said.
Harry beamed at him. “You will? Should we go now?”
bring that up?” The summer before fourth year, theirs and several other families had spent the holidays in Switzerland together. One incredibly awkward evening, Pansy’s mother had walked in on him groping some Swiss boy he had met in Lucerne.
They continued down the path, his mother’s letter burning a hole in Draco’s pocket. Every time he thought of her, a great surge of guilt crashed through him. The problem was, he already had so much to be remorseful for. Soon, he feared, he would grow numb to the guilt.
The words jumbled together and for one merciful moment he thought that Harry had not heard him. But, as the corner of his mouth quirked up, Draco realized with a sinking heart that he had most definitely understood.
“It’s, er…it’s happened on and off,” Draco lied. “Since he died.”
“Here.” Daphne tapped the page impatiently. “I can’t tell—it’s a hydra, it must be. Which means…” She turned to her textbook. “God, why can’t I remember any of this? Babbling says we’re supposed to have this section memorized by now.”
They had arrived at Draco’s usual spot by the lake. Harry conjured a thick blanket for them to sit on, raising his eyebrows at Draco when he managed it nonverbally. Draco scoffed. It shouldn’t have been cozy, out by the lake in the middle of December, but it was. They sat back, watching the rise and fall of the water. The thick snow seemed to muffle all sound; it was as though they were in their own private bubble.
The shabby little pub was empty besides their group—squeezed around a large table were Seamus, Dean, Neville, Parvati, and Lavender. There was much excitement as they greeted one another: Neville limped over to give Harry a hug, while Seamus shook his hand vigorously, pulling him to a chair between Parvati and himself. As they settled in, Tom brought over several bottles of firewhisky. Ron and Dean were already discussing the most recent Quidditch game—Cannons against Puddlemere, with the Cannons losing spectacularly—while Hermione hugged Lavender tightly. Her scars had nearly faded. It was nice, he thought, to be among friends.
“I’m going to check your Mark. Alright?”
When Draco caught Harry in passing in the library later that day, he told him that he was too tired to attend their “practice session” that night. In truth, he was starting to feel that old sense of dread creep back, and he needed time to sort himself out. At least he knew the source of his anxiety: his father’s hearing tomorrow. A small part of him had expected to receive a note from his parents—perhaps reassuring him, updating him, or at the very least, asking how he was. But he heard nothing. The velvet pouch tucked into his cloak nagged at him wherever he went. The temptation to open it had long passed—he was almost afraid of it, now, and he had decided that he was better off not knowing what it contained. The same was true of his father: he had been quite young when he decided that there were questions regarding his father that he would rather not know the answer to.
, for God’s sake. They’re supposed to be
"Day.”
“Of course you suck cock like you’ve been doing it for years,” he murmured. Potter laughed.
,” she continued, looking up at him with those protuberant eyes. “There’s an article on insomnia, and whether moon frogs are to blame.”
Draco gaped at him. He felt himself blushing. “You’re—that’s just—I didn’t wear this with any intention of—”
"Hm…let’s see if I can remember.” He sat back, frowning in a mock attempt at recalling the details. “We were in his bed, I think. We kissed…I remember that. Hands might have gone in certain places…there may have been grinding.” At Pansy’s squeak, he added: “With clothes
“And if anything strange happens. Anything at all.”
She was interrupted by the clamor of flapping wings as dozens of owls swooped in with the morning post. Draco hastily pushed away his plate as Callidus landed at their table. He had a roll of parchment tied to his leg.
“The memory, it wasn’t…” Harry let out a sharp exhale. “It wasn’t…that. Not exactly. You were in your bedroom, at the Manor…it must have just happened…”
“We’re not children anymore,” Draco said sourly as Pansy filled a sack with chattering Ice Mice.
For a second, Draco thought he saw Potter grimace. But then he resumed the neutral expression he usually wore, his features smoothing out easily. “No. We haven’t done that one, either.”
“Is this why you stopped?” Draco breathed. “Is this what happens? Your memory is all fucked up and you…you…you go mad?” His heart was racing. What if he never went back to normal? What if his memories continued to haunt him like this, bursting forth so vividly that he couldn’t possibly ignore them?
“You’ll have to find something else to make fun of me for,” Draco said.
“Yeah.” Although he was still dizzy, Draco couldn’t stand the thought of Potter comforting him for a moment longer. He rose unsteadily to his feet, pushing Potter’s hand away as he reached out for him. “I’m fine. Gonna go…go to the castle.”
“Oh! Well, I just Floo there.”
Potter gave a weak chuckle. After a moment, he said, “Macnair. Did he…what did he do?”
Draco scoffed at her. “You’re being ridiculous.”
“A bit old hat for us D.A. members, isn’t it?” Boot mused. “Then again, I still haven’t managed it nonverbally.”
Harry took out his wand and gently tapped the parchment. “Mischief managed.” Instantly, the lines of ink began to dry up.
“I have to go find Ginny,” Luna said. She passed a copy of what must have been the
“It wasn’t fine,” Harry argued. “You were really bothered, I remember, you—”
Draco eventually made his way to the greenhouses. By the time he arrived, the sun was beginning to slip back under the horizon. Greenhouse One was vacant; the door creaked as he pushed through. Somewhere, a wind chime rang. The glass ceiling was covered with vines, casting strange shadows and unexpected arcs of light. All sorts of flowers and plants were nestled deep inside their pots: fat little cactuses, great orchids in an assortment of colours, purple shrivelfig bulbs. Sprout’s desk was strewn with mismatched gloves and a half-spilled bag of soil. In the corner, several sketchbooks were already neatly stacked. Draco set his satchel onto the desk and pulled out Blaise’s and Pansy’s sketchbooks, placing them on top of the others. Then, he withdrew his own. He took a moment to leaf through the pages, pausing to examine some of the sketches. As he did, he recalled the circumstances in which he had drawn them. Thistle—when he had snapped at Blaise and Pansy, ripped off the corner of his drawing, and then stormed off. Bearberry shrubs—when Blaise had first brought up the idea of dating someone who wasn’t a Slytherin or part of their inner circle. Spruce—when he had finally opened up, if ever so slightly, about his complicated relationship with his parents, and with his past.
Draco hadn’t realized he was holding his breath until he stepped into the clearing and it blustered out of him. There, sitting by the emerald blanket, was Harry…and next to him was Granger. Draco stopped short. Her presence felt wrong. All wrong. This was supposed to be
Draco did know. It had occurred to him several times in the months leading up to December that for many families, this would be their first Christmas without a loved one who had died during the Battle. “And Granger’s staying with her parents, is it?”
“I…” Once again, her eyes filled with tears. Wiping them away angrily, Pansy started to gather her things. “I don’t know what I mean. God, Draco, you’re so…”
"But I don’t have boils.”
“Boring,” Blaise sneered, sitting back in his chair. “Loads of people didn’t come back for their eighth year.”
“Shacklebolt’s turning things around. Doesn’t want Dementors in Azkaban…He’s looking to restructure some departments, sort out the Wizengamot…”
“Do they ever come true? Your predictions?” Neville asked. He looked about as nervous as Seamus.
“You…” Potter trailed off. Draco waited for him to elaborate, but instead, he suddenly reached out and pulled him into a tight embrace. They had never really hugged before. Draco had no idea what to do or say. With Potter’s arms wrapped around him, his face buried into the crook of his neck, Draco didn’t dare move. All at once, Potter was kissing him again. Draco couldn’t keep up. He didn’t even bother fighting for control.
As the others brought their toads to the box on McGonagall’s desk, Draco hastily slipped his mouse into his cloak pocket. He looked over at Blaise and Pansy—they were still discussing their plans for the summer holidays. Before they could notice him, Draco grabbed his satchel and hurried out into the corridor. He made his way to the entrance hall, taking the little mouse out of his pocket as he stepped outside.
I just meant…lay together for a bit. That’s all. We never get to just talk.”
“You're right."
“What happened?” he asked.
“I’m going to check your Mark. Alright?”
Even through the fire, Draco could feel his father’s fury. After a tense moment of silence, he said, “Fine. You want to know what’s in there? Open it.”
Draco rolled his eyes as Blaise drawled, “Looks like I’ve bested you, Draco.”
“I should think all of us have good prospects,” Goldstein said happily, raising his mug to them. “We all fought in the battle, didn’t we? That doesn’t seem to have gone unnoticed. Look at Hermione, working in Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.”
Even though he was embarrassed, Draco forced his eyes up to meet Harry’s. Draco reminded his heart, once again, to settle down, to resist bruising his ribs as it pounded in his chest. He needed to get a grip. But it was becoming difficult to ignore the feel of Harry’s knee against his leg, the pout of his lips as he took Draco in. They stayed like that for one moment, gauging the other’s reaction, until finally, Harry said, “I think I’m going to kiss you.”
Harry sat in the armchair next to him, perching at the edge. “Look. He’s your father. They’re your parents. I can understand why you’d be—upset, or worried, or—”
“I could have done
“You…” Potter looked over at him. In the dark, Draco couldn’t make out his expression. He waited. “That…was good.”
“Another?”
“If my father goes to Azkaban…” Draco didn’t know how to continue.
“Draco,” Harry sighed. “You’ve done loads of things you don’t need to regret.”
“Draco!” Nott said. “Where the hell have you been?”
“I am not. I just don’t fancy spending the next two weeks watching you bounce off the walls as you consume your weight in sugar.”
Looking down, Draco realized that he had been gripping it again. Irritated with himself, he stuffed his hands into his pockets, glaring at Potter. “It keeps happening. I don’t know what it is. I keep seeing…old memories. It’s as though I’m there, reliving it.”
“Hello, everyone,” she said dreamily. Her robes were shimmering.
After a moment of silence, Granger tried again: “So, Malfoy—D-Draco—what do you think of Hufflepuff’s odds? Slytherin…Slytherin played very well against Gryffindor last match.” Weasley looked as though he had just swallowed a slug.
“Wandless magic, I know, I know.”
“I never said you were evil,” Potter said quietly.
“Alright,” Blaise sighed. “That’s enough champagne for you.” Addressing Harry and Draco, he said, “Someone will take your trunks, just leave them here with your cloaks. I’ll be back.” He grimaced. “We have to help my mother in the kitchen. Someone’s put sugar in the soup instead of salt.”
“I heard you.”
“There are loads of spots in the castle I avoid,” Harry continued. “Thank God for the map—the one I showed you. I know all the secret passageways and the shortcuts, so I can still get around.”
Draco froze. “You don’t mean that.”
Draco came to slowly, as though he was emerging from a deep sleep. In the dark, he could just make out Potter looking down at him, brows furrowed. The ache in his arm was barely noticeable; instead, an intense sadness filtered through him.
I can feel you.”
Draco offered his arm. “They’re better? How so?”
“No, I don’t think so,” Harry said coolly. He readjusted his grip on his wand. “We know what you’re planning to do.”
He couldn’t help but let out a sob. It tore at his throat. “Forget it. It doesn’t matter. I told you—I was glad to do it.”
“You’re not weak just because you need help, Draco,” Harry said. “Do you know how many people helped me to get rid of Voldemort? Every step of the way, I had people helping me.”
“Oh, I think they’re going very well,” Proudfoot said, the corners of his lips twitching. Draco broke out into a cold sweat—
Draco took a deep, shuddering breath. “Well, anyway, my mother always liked him. She felt sorry for him, I think. This was all before my time, so I don’t really know the details, but she looked out for him. Told my father to go easy on him.” He gave a hollow laugh. “Anyway, it didn’t matter, because in the end my father was nothing, and Severus was one of the favourites. And then we found out he was Dumbledore’s man.”
“And why shouldn’t I?” he asked fiercely. He jumped up and strode over to the window, fists clenched. “You don’t know how often I’ve thought of…of just leaving, of not even finishing my N.E.W.T.s…what a waste of time this is, studying for grades I’ll never use. I don’t belong here anymore.”
The Hog’s Head was as dim and shabby as he remembered. Harry spoke quietly to the barman, who led them to a little room and shut the door behind them. It was draughty; the only warmth came from the little fire struggling to stay alive in the grate. Draco shrunk into his cloak as he looked around at the bare brick walls and the shuttered windows. He was starting to have second thoughts, and Harry must have known, because he gave him a reassuring smile as he took the little bowl of Floo powder off the mantle.
The look on his father’s face was terrifying. He shut his eyes and said, in a dangerously soft voice, “Draco. You
“Owen Cauldwell,” Potter mumbled. “Behind you.”
listen. So then Trelawney comes over, and I tell her what I think, and she gets Millicent to pull another card. So she does, and she gets The Tower. And, again, I have no idea what any of these cards mean. So I tell her there’s going to be some big calamity, and it’s going to bring you both closer together.”
Harry took Draco’s arm into his lap and began rolling up his sleeve. “How have you been? Any flashbacks?”
Draco stared as Potter reached for his belt and started unbuckling it; for someone who had never done this before, he was certainly confident. ‘
of the shelf when you’re done with them, please…”
“I do!”
Draco shifted uncomfortably on the sofa. “Right. Well, we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. In the meantime, we are
“Done,” Potter said, leaning back in his chair. “Should we…compare our lists, then?”
Looking to stall, Draco held up his apple. “I’m eating.”
“For psychopaths like my father?” he offered. He gave a cold, bitter laugh and slumped back, hands on his face.
“Look,” Harry said, reaching around to his back pocket. “Your wand!”
“It would be so much easier if I just—”
“Let’s get back,” he said briskly. “I have a paper to finish.” Before Potter could reply, he turned away and waited by the edge of the clearing, telling himself to get a grip. Hoping Potter wouldn’t notice, he gently pressed the pads of his fingers against his throat, feeling for his pulse. It was racing.
He looked put out. “I’ve been asking around for you since term started. Everyone says you’re at the library, but I haven’t seen you.”
“But why does he care?”
“Nothing
“He was brainwashed by his father,” Draco growled. “He wasn’t thinking straight. We were all scared at that point—for our parents, for what would happen to us if we failed—none of us were thinking right. He was stupid. That doesn’t mean he deserved to die.”
Blaise made to push past him, but Pansy snatched at his wrist.
“Yeah,” she said brightly. “I’ve composed my own pieces. The music class here is brilliant, although mum…she doesn’t really want me taking it for my N.E.W.T.s.”
As they set about peeling and chopping their onions, Harry said, “Why did Slughorn say this potion is so complicated? It only has three ingredients.”
“What do you reckon?” he asked in a quiet voice.
“Yeah.”
“Yeah. That’s normal, I think.” Potter was pushing his thumb into Draco’s skin. He winced as a sharp throb of pain spread from his Mark into his wrist. Before Potter could see his face, Draco turned away, studying the enormous oak towering above them. The breeze was cool enough that he had worn his winter cloak. As Potter examined him, he tried to quiet the overwhelming urge to push him away. Finally, he placed the tip of his wand on Draco’s forearm.
The room swam back into view just as Pansy and Diggle reached his side.
?” Harry looked as bewildered as he felt. Draco wondered if perhaps news had gotten out about their relationship. That wouldn't be so bad, he decided.
“I’ve got three of Gideon Crumb, if you want him,” she offered.
“Yeah. S'good.” As he adjusted to the stretch, Draco felt himself clench with a pleasurable sort of pain. “More,” he said. Again, Harry obeyed him, introducing a third finger and pushing in further. The initial burn subsided faster this time, and he soon found himself rocking against Harry’s fingers.
Draco shook his head. He didn’t want to remember. He didn’t want to say.
“Draco.” Harry reached out and touched his arm. “We’re going to get you up off the floor. Alright?”
“Forget it.” Sentimentality had always been uncomfortable between them; it just didn’t feel right. “Let’s go, come on. They’ll be looking for us.”
“It wasn’t a memory. It was…I just thought…” He swallowed thickly. “Imagine if I didn’t have to worry about my parents anymore. If they just…weren’t…here.”
On his way back to the Slytherin common room, Draco cursed himself for being so stupid. That vial was likely his father’s last chance. How, then, could he have just left it laying on the floor all night? What if Harry had opened the vial? Or dropped it? Or what if Draco had somehow forgotten his cloak on the floor and left the room without it? The very thought turned his stomach.
Draco brought his hands up to rub his face. “He kept trying to save me.”
Weasley rounded on her, his face turning an even deeper shade of purple. “You don’t know, then? Don’t know what he did to Harry?”
“And I only asked for a place to talk.”
“Harry Potter,” she said. “I’ve already got him. Want it?”
“Yeah. Just slipped.” He set his firewhisky onto the table, afraid he was going to have one of his flashbacks. But it didn’t come. Instead, Draco felt oddly giddy, as though he was excited for something he couldn’t quite put his finger on. He pretended to examine the label on his bottle as he took stock of himself. He was jumpy, uneasy, his stomach doing all kinds of twists and turns. Draco was so lost in his own thoughts that he didn’t realize they were leaving until Blaise tapped his shoulder. Embarrassed, he only then noticed that everyone was standing up, pulling on their cloaks. He scrambled to do the same, eager to escape into the cold night air. Their little crowd spilled out onto the empty street, Pansy already demanding that Theo and Lavender visit them again soon.
They walked back to the castle in silence. When they arrived in the entrance hall, Harry motioned for Draco to follow him through a door and down a flight of stone steps. They entered a bright corridor decorated with paintings of food: a roast chicken on a platter of vegetables, a loaf of sourdough, a single fried egg. Harry stopped in front of a painting of a silver fruit bowl.
“Noon today,” she squeaked fearfully.
Quietly, Potter said, “I’m starting now. Alright?” When Draco nodded, he muttered, “Three…two…one…”
They nodded in agreement, some of them sipping their firewhiskies. A contemplative silence fell over the table.
“Shacklebolt would never do that,” Draco said at once. “He hates the dementors. Last I heard, he plans to get rid of them, even in Azkaban.”
Draco felt badly—Harry only had the gift from Draco to open, while he and his mother had large piles to get through. But he didn’t seem bothered. Instead he sat, cross-legged, asking Draco about each person who had gifted him, where they lived, what they did. He was very interested in the broomstick polish Draco received from his father (he suspected that it was his mother who had purchased it, but he kept quiet to preserve the peace). His mother, at any rate, was pleased with his gift to her—a set of goblin-made wineglasses. Most of hers had been shattered while the Manor served as Voldemort’s headquarters.
—things I don’t regret.”
Draco shrugged, forcing his face into a neutral expression that he prayed would not reveal the way his pulse picked up when Harry spoke in that quiet, low voice. “You fed me. So…thank you.”
Draco sat there for some time, eyes squeezed shut, breathing deeply, alternating between telling himself
“He checked the loo, you prat,” she hissed. “You weren’t there. He couldn’t find you anywhere. He was
“I could ask you the same question,” he said. Glancing at the fireplace, he asked, "That was your father you were speaking to, wasn't it?"
“You’re trying to get me drunk,” he said flatly.
“Draco Malfoy.” He offered his hand.
“Come, Draco,” she said, reaching down for his hand. “At least the three of us can be together for one last Christmas.” With a sad smile on her face, she said, "Mr. Potter can come, too. We'll have a feast like we did before you left for Hogwarts, remember? A dish from every place we've visited..."
Harry gave a funny little smile. “I think I prefer to be out of the limelight for a while.”
“We wanted to ask you about something,” Harry started. “We were curious about what you said the other night, at the pub.”
It was another oppressively hot day. Draco sat at the patio table, flipping through his Potions textbook, while Potter tended to his plants. Draco was resolutely ignoring him. Why he insisted on using a watering can, lugging the rusted thing from the shed to the garden over and over, was a mystery to him. Now that the rain had mostly dried up, Potter’s plants seemed to be flourishing. Or at least, they weren’t as brown as they had been.
He had just pushed his way through the double doors when he heard someone call his name. Draco looked around, bewildered, and saw Potter jogging up the path towards him.
Draco looked up at him, startled. “Where are we going?”
“Of course. That’s obvious. But as teachers, you need to decide on a curriculum of sorts. What exact spells will you be teaching, what constitutes a ‘pass,’ and how will you decide if a student has passed or not?”
Across from him, Daphne gave an apologetic grimace. “I was just wondering how you did in Flitwick’s practical.”
“Your brother, Ron,” Lavender said suddenly. “Bill. He came to see me, at St. Mungo’s. He told me everything would be alright, you know, that I could live a normal life.”
Instead, Harry looked up at him fiercely, a strange scowl on his face. Then, very slowly, he leaned forward and pressed his lips against Draco’s Mark. His Mark didn’t burn; it didn’t bother him at all. Instead, watching as Harry tenderly kissed his Mark, Draco felt himself melting. The sight was in turns intimate and erotic.
Draco was about to tell him to mind his own business when he realized that they would all find out about McGonagall’s ridiculous arrangement before long. “This bloody internship thing,” he said. “They couldn’t figure out what to do with me, so they have me teaching practice lessons to the younger students. Like a study group, Proudfoot said.”
“You’re not fooling me.”
“It’s here,” Harry gasped as though the wind had been knocked out of him. “Here, it has to be…”
“I’m glad my parents stayed out of it,” she mused. “Though of course, you know…I think they agreed with it all. I still don’t know if…well, anyway.”
“What? I—yes. It was—it was fine.”
"Let me hear you. I want to hear you.”
“See you all next week,” Potter said. “Until then, keep practicing. But you’ve all done really well.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Harry tuck his wand into his back pocket.
“So am I.”
“Yeah. I was glad to see him. He looks a lot better.”
She bickered with him all the way back to the castle, and Draco quickly regretted telling her about his deal with Potter. She offered to give him twice what Potter was paying—though privately, Draco doubted very much that she had access to those kinds of funds—and, as they pushed through the double doors, she threatened to write to his parents.
"Fucking Potter,” he growled. “I don’t know if he thinks I owe him now, because of what happened with my—with my trial, and him saying what he said—of course they weren’t going to charge me anyway, I was a minor when it all…anyway. He’s so bloody arrogant. He came up to me and just told me to teach him nonverbal magic.”
“I guess.”
Harry was back to hovering in the middle of the pitch. Draco’s heart gave another squeeze as Harry glanced towards the Slytherin box once, and then again, and then a third time.
“Look at me.” Harry searched his eyes as Draco did everything he could to stop from falling apart. Panicked, he tried to turn away again, but Harry growled and forced their eyes to meet. “Look at me, damn you.” Draco scowled at him. “After everything you’ve put me through, don’t even think of misbehaving.”
—you think McGonagall would tell them to leave?”
“They change these things all the time,” his father said coolly.
he is, Father. Potter’s garbage at Occlumency. He can’t hide anything. And I could tell he was being honest.”
“Out.” Madam Webb, apparently at her wits’ end, was storming down the length of the bench. “I know we’ve all enjoyed your little visit, Mr. Potter, and I’m sure Mr. Malfoy is very glad of the opportunity to see his father, but this is not for your eyes.” As she came down the stairs towards them, Harry held up his wand.
think that, you have no idea…I shouldn’t have said that, I’m sorry…”
The shouting had left him feeling numb. He couldn’t stand fighting—the chaos was overwhelming, and he hated the sense that things were spiraling out of control. He thought himself rather foolish, being so upset over petty arguments between people he didn’t really give a damn about to begin with. But the crackle of tension as people started pulling out their wands, threatening to hex each other, brought back painful memories that he would prefer not to revisit. There had been plenty of arguments between the Death Eaters, who rarely got along and were constantly trying to curry favour with the Dark Lord at each others’ expense. He couldn’t count the number of times fights had broken out in the Manor, all while his parents tried to subdue everyone without becoming targets themselves. Several priceless pieces of art, including his mother’s beloved portrait of his grandmother, had been destroyed, while an ancient wardrobe passed down through generations had been blown to pieces during one memorable encounter between Yaxley and the Carrows.
Draco winced as Potter’s wand suddenly came alight. “Fuck off, Potter,” he growled, throwing an arm over his eyes.
Draco wrenched himself out of Potter’s mind and gripped the patio table tightly. He was trembling. Across from him, Potter smirked.
“Harry. This is a big deal.”
“That’s right, Draco,” Harry said slyly. “You have to share your secrets.”
“Oh.” She blinked at him in surprise. “I wasn’t sure why they asked me again. I thought I was dreadful, last time.”
“But it’s late,” Pansy started.
“Maybe.” Handing Harry back his letter, Draco shoved his hands in his pockets and continued on down the path.
“Huh?” He had been staring out the window.
Draco was so lost in thought that his fingers had strayed too close to Callidus’ eye; he nipped angrily. “Ouch! Sorry, sorry.” He quickly pulled his hand back. “Sorry…wasn’t paying attention.” The sharp pain in his hand brought him back to reality. Peering around the Owlery, he remembered that he still hadn’t written to his mother yet. Guilt lurching in his chest, he dug through his satchel until he found a spare bit of parchment, his inkpot, and a quill. As he pulled everything out, he noticed both his old wand and the small velvet pouch at the bottom of the bag. At the sight, his anxiety flared. Reminding himself to
Proudfoot stood and gathered his jacket and briefcase. “It’s settled, then. Unless you have any other ideas that I’m unaware of?”
“I don't mind Dean!” Millicent assured her.
“The Golden Boy, coming to my rescue once again,” Draco muttered. He refused to look Harry in the eye, instead staring into the fire.
“Is that why you stopped?” he asked. “You didn’t want to lose your memories?”
“Up.” Harry wasn’t ready for the sudden release of his restraints. He sagged forward, face falling into the sheets, and he took a moment to flex his aching wrists. “Up, and on the floor. Go on.” Everything in him said to obey that voice, and so he did. Scooting off the bed—careful to avoid rubbing his sore arse against the sheets—he scrambled to the floor, resting on his knees. From this position, he could finally see Draco properly: the smooth expanse of his stomach, his pale flesh that seemed to just go on and on and on, his grey eyes and his pouty little mouth and his straight nose that came together to form a face that had no business being so beautiful. Harry’s cock was sore at the sight of him.
“Alright, alright,” he muttered, terrified in the face of her tears. “What’s the last thing you did before...it went wrong?”
Draco unfolded the bit of paper and saw that it was a receipt. “Eeylops Owl Emporium.” He looked up at Harry. “I don’t understand.”
“Yeah?” Harry breathed. He was leaning into Draco’s touch.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut as he said, “I don’t know why this keeps coming up. What’s this got to do with my Mark?”
He was exhausted. In that moment, he felt as though he might not even be able to make it back to the castle. How easy it would be to just lay down and melt into the dark forest. To fall asleep and wait until some creature found him. Or perhaps the forest would claim him as its own. Maybe the ground would swallow him up and allow him to finally forget. These thoughts—nebulous, unformed, loose tendrils floating through one another—circled his mind as he forced himself to breathe.
“Well, anyway.” She gave a great sniff and pulled her hair from her face. “What are you doing down here? Can’t sleep?”
“What would I want with
Kreacher settled into a deep bow, his nose nearly touching the floor. “Come, please, come sit, Master Harry, your favourite spot…”
“And? You two hate each other!”
“Okay.” The tip of Harry’s wand twisted into his flesh. “Three…two…one…”
“Yeah.” Neither of them moved.
“Sorry,” Potter said grimly. “I want to make sure I get all of it.”
Portkey!” Nothing happened.
Lost her mind completely.”
If the dense darkness of the forest was disconcerting, Draco drew comfort from the familiar sound of dried leaves skittering together as the wind whipped through the branches. To his mind, the leaves sounded like hundreds of ghosts whispering together, discussing the scene unfolding on the forest floor: he and Potter, sat as closely together as they dared, Potter examining his arm while he stubbornly looked away. He wondered what the forest thought of their intrusions.
He chuckled weakly. “You might be right.”
“Yes, well, you were the two students we couldn’t place. You should meet and plan your first lesson before Thursday.” She paused, considering him, and then asked, “Working with Potter won’t be a problem, will it, Mr. Malfoy? I don’t want a repeat of your previous tomfooleries. Surely, now that you are both of age—”
“Come with me.”
He knew exactly what it meant: his father wanted to speak by Floo in the Slytherin Common Room. He had received even more cryptic messages in the past. Draco took out his wand and tapped the note gently; it caught fire. Holding the edge so as not to burn himself, it suddenly occurred to him that according to his father, the Manor’s mail was being monitored. So why was he communicating about their meetings by post? He had also mentioned that their Floo was being watched…so how was he getting around the Ministry? It wouldn’t surprise him if his father was once again putting him in danger’s way, but to risk it while his trial was ongoing…would he be so stupid? Sometimes, Draco mused as he traipsed up the path leading to the castle, he felt as though he didn’t know his father at all anymore. How strange, to know someone for eighteen years, and yet not understand the first thing about them.
“Is there anything else we can be getting you, Harry Potter, sir?” she squeaked.
“Because he looked murderous!” said Pansy. “You should have seen Weasley and Granger. They were shocked, too! Just stood there staring, didn’t they?” The others nodded.
“It was…Macnair.”
“Well…I dunno. She stopped talking about her garden a while ago. I think she might have killed everything.”
She brightened at that. “Thanks, Draco. Have a good night.”
Everywhere Zabini had touched him, Harry kissed. Draco's skin burned. Never before had he been so aware of his own body. It felt as though he was being purged--as though every last grain of guilt and shame was being wiped away and instead replaced with nothing but Harry, Harry, Harry. Overwhelmed as he was, Draco urged himself to commit every last detail to memory--Harry's blue jumper, his brilliant green eyes, his flushed face and his swollen lips.
“No, we’re not. Find someone else to teach you. And stay away from me.”
“I wasn’t going to say that,” Draco grumbled.
“I can’t stop thinking about you,” Harry went on. “All term, it’s been like this.”
Draco was tired. So very, very tired. “I don’t care about all that rubbish,” he murmured. “I thought this was all supposed to end, after…” He took a deep breath. “After Voldemort died.” Pansy winced next to him, but he ignored her. “I thought it was all supposed to be over.”
“And what’s your happy memory, Potter?” Blaise called out. Catching sight of Draco’s glare, he shrugged innocently. “So that we can have an example.”
Harry shrugged. “Seems pretty obvious. Look how far you’ve gotten me with nonverbal magic.” To demonstrate, Harry held out his wand; he had indeed cast a Warming Charm nonverbally.
At once, Harry marched up to him. Cupping his face, Harry said, “He would have been happy. Because I’m happy. Because
“I don’t decide what to erase,” Harry said. “It just sort of…appears.”
“What are you doing here?” Greg asked slowly.
“There we are!” Blaise sat back happily, watching as the white mouse he had just transfigured darted across his desk.
“She’s angry with me,” he admitted. “Wants me to go to Azkaban with her, to see my father. She’s been nagging me since the start of term.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” he called, smiling as though he couldn’t see the scowl on Draco’s face. “Do you have a moment? I’d like to see you in my office.”
It was as though his mouth had been jinxed—he didn’t seem capable of opening it. Sitting back down next to Harry, he watched mutely as he poured him a drink.
“Isn’t it the same thing?” Lovegood asked. She was now staring at him again, eyes wide with surprise.
“For fuck’s sake,” he muttered, looking up at the sky. Early October was bringing about a truly spectacular palette: roses and mauves mixed together in a frothy wash as the day drew to an end.
“Since I decided that I don’t want all of Hogwarts hearing your business.”
“I’ve cut myself, sir,” he repeated, holding up his bloody hand.
“Will you go, then?” he asked. “If I go?”
Grinning, Harry reached out and tickled the enormous pear. To Draco’s amazement, it writhed and laughed before turning into a green handle. Harry pulled the door open and gestured for him to enter. The great, high-ceilinged room reminded him sharply of the kitchens at the Manor, although much larger: an incredible expanse of counters lined the walls, weighed down by stacks of pots and pans. At the centre of the room were tables identical to those in the Great Hall.
“Because I haven’t written her back in months,” he said. “Because I won’t go to Azkaban with her. Because I refuse to stay at the Manor for Christmas. There are other reasons, I’m sure.”
“You can Apparate from Hogsmeade,” Zabini said. “That’s how we got here.”
Draco smirked. “Surely you’re not one to lack confidence, Potter.”
Draco glared as he offered his arm. Sitting cross-legged next to him, Potter seemed not to notice his irritation. Instead, he gently took Draco’s arm and set it across his knee. Pushing up his sleeve, he said, “How does it feel? Any different?”
Suddenly serious, Harry said, “Wherever you go, I’ll follow. You know that, right?”
Spent, Draco was dimly aware of Potter climbing back onto his lap. He had a sly smile on his face; Draco supposed he was quite pleased with himself. Usually, he hated touching after sex. Perhaps it was the sudden exhaustion, but he could do little more than run his hands across Potter’s back as Potter nuzzled the side of his neck.
on his rant about his mother, until Draco was about ready to tear his hair out. At long last, he found his essay, and he left. Silence rang through the bedroom as Draco found himself alone.
“What?” Blaise asked, gawking at him. The sneer that had been there a moment earlier was wiped off his face.
“Draco,” Harry sighed. “What if it makes you better? Don’t you want to feel better?”
Draco was annoyed to find that yet again Potter ignored his jab. He was still staring at his wand as though willing it to light up.
“What’s this?” Draco asked, turning towards her in confusion.
“I didn’t know what it would be,” he admitted. “That was my first time casting a proper Patronus.”
Hermione’s face was very stiff as Parvati began to shuffle her deck. Harry knew that she was recalling Trelawney’s classes up in the North Tower, in that warm, cramped room that always smelled heavily of perfume.
“Move. Down this way.”
“You see, Draco…I’ll be blunt. It looks as though I’m facing several years in Azkaban, if not a lifetime. As you can imagine, this has been very distressing for your mother.”
Proudfoot relaxed and gave him a small smile. “Wizards abroad have newspapers, too, Mr. Malfoy.”
, before he lost his mind.
“I still think it’s unfair that you can’t play,” said Pansy. “If you were the Seeker this year, I think Slytherin would have a real chance. And I’d love to see us win before we leave.”
? Why did you stop?”
“Now I’m not so sure.” Theo looked down at the book in his hand, unconvinced.
Draco laughed, and that laugh did all sorts of things to him. Made him giddy. Made him weak. “You want me to fuck your mouth, is it? That’s what you want?”
Pansy paused, and then: “
“My wand?” Draco asked, frowning at him.
Draco whined, twisting beneath him. “
“But how?” When his father didn’t answer, he changed tacks. “Where is it going to take you?”
“I know. I’m sorry.”
“It’s a lot more complicated than that,” Harry said quietly. “I’ve seen your memories. I know how you were brought up, what you were forced to do.”
Something in him shattered every time Potter started using his first name. The sound nearly pushed him over the edge, and so he slowed down, enjoying the heady sensation of Potter tightening around him. Potter curved his back, his face driven into the pillow as he scrambled for purchase on the headboard. Although he was the one in control, Draco knew that he had hardly any power here. As Potter demanded, in a rasping voice, that he fuck him harder, he immediately obeyed, smirking as the other boy gasped and buried his face into the sheets.
“Oh, hi!” she said. “How are you, Pansy? Draco?”
“Yeah.”
And with that comes the end of this story! I want to thank everyone who's taken the time to read it. For those of you who might want to read more of my work, I have a Drarry one-shot posted, and plans for several others. Again, thank you so much for reading, and take care of yourselves.
“I knew I’d seen you!” Draco shoved him playfully. “By the Shrieking Shack!”
“She ate it up! And so did Trelawney! They absolutely loved it. So anyway, if you notice her hanging around more lately…”
“And you’re not just saying that to be nice?”
“Fred and George told us ages ago,” Harry said. He seemed very pleased with himself when he added, “Dobby used to work here, so I came to visit him.”
Finally, finally, he began to feel the stirrings of his orgasm. “I’m going to—going to come. I’m going to come. Potter, please. I’m going to come.” Potter’s expression held none of its usual wickedness as he studied Draco’s face. It was agonizing, working his way to his release. When he finally did get there, he felt as though his orgasm was being ripped out of him. He whimpered while Potter held him tightly, whispering soft platitudes. Afterwards, he was limp. He had absolutely nothing left to give. Potter seemed to understand that. He held Draco against his chest, where he could hear the frantic beating of Potter’s heart. “Draco,” he murmured into his hair. “Draco, Draco, Draco.”
Was it so odd, to notice these things? It was normal, he had told himself stubbornly over the years. Everyone
“Yeah. But first, I’m going to hug you. Alright?” Harry asked. He had already taken his hands out of his pockets. Draco nodded, and then Harry stepped forward and pulled him into a tight embrace. He had expected to feel an automatic urge to tense, to stiffen, but instead he found himself wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist. He was acutely aware of everywhere they touched. It occurred to him, distantly, that anybody could catch them, that there were no doubt teachers wandering the corridors, looking for students out of bed, to say nothing of Filch. But…what did it matter? What did it matter, he thought, when Harry was willingly drawing their bodies together, their cheeks touching, the feel of his jumper so familiar and reassuring? Harry gave him one last squeeze before pulling away. His cheeks were pink.
But the smaller house-elf had flung herself at Harry and was gripping his waist. “Harry Potter, sir!” she squeaked. “Winky has been missing you, sir!”
Just as he was about to work up the courage to remove the stupid cloak, Harry pulled away. Draco instantly reached out for him, unwilling to let go of that soothing warmth, but Harry didn’t stray far; he sat atop Draco, shaking his head. Draco whined and tried to drag him down, but Harry resisted.
“Give those here,” he said. Carefully, he took Harry’s glasses, folding them and leaning over to set them down on the floor. Draco slid the tips of his fingers across Harry’s chest. Down they went, slipping past his navel, until Draco flattened his palms onto Harry’s skin and trailed his hands back up to grip his shoulders. “Alright?”
“On my stomach. Come up around here. There you go.” Draco allowed himself to be positioned near the edge of the bed. On his knees, he watched as Potter sank easily onto his stomach. Draco reached for his wand, nearly knocking it off the bedside table as he fumbled.
“How’s Greg doing?” Draco asked suddenly, peering up at him.
“Who knows?” He shrugged. “After everything that’s happened, it doesn’t seem very pressing.”
The rest of dinner was miserable. None of the eighth-year Slytherins seemed in the mood for pudding, so they decided to retreat to the common room together.
for this,” Proudfoot snapped, impatience creeping into his voice. “Please don’t force me to curse a student.” When Draco glared stubbornly at him, he shook his head. “It was decades ago, when I was just starting out as an Auror. In my younger days, I had engaged in forms of magic the Ministry doesn’t necessarily approve of.”
As the students filed out, Draco made his way over to the other Slytherin eighth-years, who stood huddled together.
been open with one another, hadn’t they? And now, everything was spoiled. He thought back on that morning when Harry found the pouch; he was no longer angry. He was just tired. Very, very tired, as though every day he was stretched just a little bit thinner. He wondered when he would finally snap. He didn’t have much left to give.
“But Draco,” Harry said. “Doesn’t it make sense? The more memories we erase, the worse you get.”
Draco sniggered despite himself. As Potter snorted, it occurred to him that they were having a laugh together. Sort of. It was a sobering thought.
“What? Why the hell would Harry Potter be in here?” His heart sunk—it was Pansy.
“What?” He recoiled. “What the hell are you on about?”
Proudfoot shrugged. “Your father put in a word for me…said it was all nonsense, and then gave the Ministry quite a sizeable donation…after that, they looked the other way.”
“But it’s important. Draco, if you don’t study—”
Draco heard Nott leave. He turned off the water and Summoned a towel from the bench. Now that he and Zabini were alone, he felt self-conscious. He wrapped the towel around his waist, trying not to listen to what the other man was doing. Looking pointedly away, he turned to his clothes, which he had laid out on the bench with his wand placed neatly on top. He started to clean his trousers with a Scouring Charm. Why had Nott left? Usually Draco didn’t want him around, but he was useful as a buffer.
“What? What are you talking about? Why are you being like this?”
“Really?” said Blaise, sounding unconvinced.
Harry couldn’t help it—a pitiful groan escaped his lips. “I—I don’t know.”
“I guess.” Draco shrugged. “Maybe we’ll get another memory.”
“Already signed up to work as an Auror, have you?” Draco said bitterly. “You’ll have to apply for Investigations. You’ll be brilliant.”
Nott rubbed the back of his neck uncomfortably. “It isn’t…we shouldn’t talk about that here.”
“It happened to my father.” Lovegood finally looked away, and instead peered up at the night sky. Without the shade of the leafy canopy, the stars were visible. “When my mother died, he tried to forget everything.”
Draco said nothing. He rubbed at his eyes, urging himself not to be pathetic.
“Yeah…yeah, alright,” she sniffed, wiping her face with her sleeve.
“Yeah. But it’s getting better…I bet by Christmas we’ll be done.”
“Can you still remember?”
“No, Potter.”
“Well, I’ll leave you to it,” Daphne said, rising from her chair. Draco checked his watch; two minutes left. “Think you can look over my Runes essay tomorrow?”
Harry looked back, smiling. “Sorry if I woke you,” he said.
“Sorry…sorry…” But Potter was hardly paying attention to him. Instead, his eyes were roving over the Mark. “It’s definitely less solid. Definitely.”
He rolled his eyes and sighed. “Yes, yes, for God’s sake. Have you always been this bossy?”
“To the sides, please, to the sides!” she said, sounding harassed as she held up her wand. She was wearing a magnificent robe of purple and gold, and atop her head sat one of the largest, most extravagant hats Draco had ever seen. As they scattered, she gave a sharp flick of her wand, and a dozen round tables swooped out from the pantry and onto the dining room floor. A suite of chairs trailed after, arranging themselves around the tables. Finally, pristine white tablecloths fluttered out of the pantry and onto the tables, along with red and green candles. With one last swish, Mrs. Zabini set them all alight. “Sit where you like!” she said. “Dinner will begin shortly.”
“I’m going to miss you, Draco!” His vision was clouded by a mass of black hair as Pansy crashed into him, throwing her arms around his neck.
“I would never hurt you,” Potter said quietly.
“Greg, I’m being serious.” He reached forward and grasped his arm. “Please. I’ll do anything.”
as Draco rummaged through their bedside table and then sat across his thighs. Pinned like this, Harry’s cock pushed further into the sheets, providing just enough friction to drive him insane without actually offering any relief. “Five, do you think?” Draco asked conversationally. “Count for me. I want to hear you.”
“Yeah?” Draco asked breathlessly. He took himself in hand, and Harry bristled.
“Mother,” he said, rushing towards her. “Are you alright?”
there.”
“The point?”
“Wasn’t that…I did it, didn’t I?” Potter asked him.
“Potter testified for him,” Blaise said quietly. “At his trial.”
left messes for the next day. They filed out of the room; his mother tapped the tree with her wand, extinguishing the candles.
Harry brushed his palm across Draco’s arm. The Mark was barely visible. Tonight was the night, he knew. And that sent a little flurry of panic racing through him.
“Yeah. I heard he’s a real prat.”
Instantly, he regretted his words. One of their unspoken rules was that they did not discuss how quickly or slowly the summer was passing. Any mention of time was strictly forbidden. To acknowledge the passing of the days was to acknowledge that in two weeks they would be separated. Draco, it seemed, was to be whisked away somewhere else. As for Potter…he was left out of those conversations entirely. But it was clear to them that whatever this was, it ended with the summer. Potter blinked at him. Draco exhaled, hating himself, and picked up his novel again.
“Proudfoot.” He said the first name he could think of. “Caught me in the corridor after curfew. Drunk.”
“Divination is very…imprecise!” she cried.
Harry glanced down at his wand and then back up at his face. Draco couldn’t make out his expression. “You wouldn’t. I know you.”
For God’s sake. All eyes were on him now, and he knew that he was trapped. Exasperated, Draco pulled out his wand. The room went quiet as he cleared his mind, taking one deep breath, and then another. He looked over at Harry, and he allowed himself to imagine a life without his father hanging over him. A life with Harry, just the two of them, unbothered by the outside world. It was silly, but for one single moment he gave himself permission to envision a life that belonged to no one else—a life where he was in control, where he determined his own fate. “
“…life in Azkaban, he’s looking at, and it’s the least he deserves…”
“Fine.” Harry swallowed thickly. “It was fine.”
“There’s no secrets,” he snapped, trying to pull himself together. “It’s practice, is what it is, and having proper form.”
And they were off, Pansy chattering away as she dragged Lavender through the sea of people. It was decidedly quieter as they disappeared into the crowd.
“My mother
“I don’t
“I never liked him,” Harry muttered darkly.
But you need to behave. You promised.”
Silently, Harry loosened the drawstrings and pulled out the glass vial. He held it up, turning the vial in his fingers as it glinted in the moonlight.
“Not really,” Draco said. “Not more than usual.”
“Fuck, your mouth is so good,” Draco said, staring down at him. “I knew all these years your mouth must be good for something. Use your tongue, go on.”
"I’m a bit young to teach at Hogwarts, aren’t I?” he said. “And I doubt any parent would be keen on having their child taught by a former Death Eater.”
last night.”
“Don’t play stupid with me. You know exactly what I mean. And I know you think he deserved it.”
“Is it…is it bad?”
“My memories.”
For a moment, his mother said nothing. Her eyes roved across his face, detecting, he imagined, all of the anger and the frustration that he had stored away for so long. Finally, she said, “I understand. You should get some sleep.” She reached out and placed a hand against his cheek. He thought she might ask about Harry—why he was there, how they had become friends, whether it was more, but she didn’t. She gave him one last, sad smile, and then climbed up the stairs. Draco didn’t follow. Instead, he sat on the bottom step, pressing the heels of his palms into his eyes as he urged himself to relax, to breathe. He didn’t want to cry. He didn’t want to spoil Harry’s Christmas. But the anxiety was mounting again, and it threatened to inundate him.
“I don’t think so,” Potter said, glancing towards Draco. He was smirking. “We’ve been getting on. Don’t you think, Malfoy?”
Blaise looked up at him in surprise. “What? You can’t be serious. What are you waiting for?”
“It is,” Harry agreed. “It’s horrible.”
If Pansy and Blaise found the map as strange as Draco first had, they said nothing. Instead, they huddled around as Harry cast the light from his wand onto the parchment, searching desperately for the dot labeled ‘Anthony Goldstein.’
“Draco?” Pansy came up next to him and placed her hand on his arm.
Theo was positively scarlet as he grinned. “No, no…I just thought, you know, that I should warn you all first…” He looked over at Pansy, who was still staring at him. “She’s…she’s really nice, Pansy.”
Daphne hesitated, and then asked, “How are your parents doing?”
Aware that Pansy was staring at him, he gave a short cough. “It was fine. I think you’re right. I think he just wants to forget all of it. Can you blame him?”
“I ate a lot at lunch,” he lied. “Anyway, I’ve got a Potions essay to finish for tomorrow. See you.”
“Can’t we just open them tomorrow morning?” Harry asked.
“Thanks for coming with me,” he said. He stuck his hands into his pockets.
“Anything you like.” Harry was sitting so close to Draco that he was practically on top of him, but he found that he didn’t mind. Slowly, he was getting used to the others’ stares.
“But what if someone finds it between now and then?” Harry asked, echoing his own worries. “Or it breaks, or it goes missing?”
“I said don’t lie!”
“Draco.” Harry nodded down at the bowl. “I’m sure. Go on. I’ll see you there.”
“Right.”
Slowly, Draco, said, “I know where we can get one. Severus’ Pensieve. My parents inherited it. It’s at the Manor, in my father’s study.”
you haven’t told them?”
“We’re…” Harry grinned. “‘Boyfriends’ sounds so…stupid. ‘Lovers’ is just…” He made a face, as did Draco. “We’re together. Is that okay?”
“Not at all, it wasn’t a trouble,” he said, finally letting go of Draco’s hand. “Ludo would have been here, of course, but he’s never in one spot for too long these days. Still, you're a fine Seeker, Mr. Potter! I’m very happy with what I saw today.”
“So what did you take the class for, then?”
“Well…okay.” Harry hesitated, and then redirected them across the hall and down a narrow corridor. “Here, let’s find an empty room.”
Draco frowned. Why was Harry being so persistent? He took a sip of his beer, aware of Granger and Weasley’s curious eyes. Harry squeezed his knee tightly and said, “Before the end of the term. We’ll see who can catch the Snitch first. Alright?”
“Maybe.” Draco hesitated, and then said, “I keep dreaming about it. I try to stop, but I can’t.”
“Edgecombe?” He shrugged, taking a sip of firewhisky. “She’s alright. Still gets on my nerves. But she’s been gone for a while. Something went wrong near Rossendale…a bunch of networks got crisscrossed, or something. So she hasn’t really been around that much.” Pansy opened her mouth to ask him something else, but he looked around at Draco and Blaise. “And what about you lot, then? How’s Hogwarts?”
Overcome, he broke the kiss and gasped, “I…” Cowering under the weight of what he was feeling, he froze. Harry smiled, apparently understanding him.
“He’s scared,” Lovegood said kindly. “He’s scared of being hurt.”
“Draco,” Harry said softly. “Draco. I’m here. It’s alright.”
“Yeah. I mean, the Weasleys…they invited me to the Burrow. But I kind of just want to be alone.”
“Now you’re upset,” Draco said, staring into his own hands. “I’m dragging you down with me. I don’t know why you bother.”
They were interrupted as Blaise and Pansy returned with several bottles of firewhisky. Once again, they shuffled to make room. Weasley scowled as Blaise passed him a drink.
“Still, come back inside. It’s about lunchtime.” Flashing Draco her most winning smile, she said, “And I was wondering if you could have a quick look at my Runes essay before class. Please?”
“Mmm?” Distractedly, she glanced over, and then her eyes widened in surprise. “Oh, wow.” She brought her wand to illuminate what little remained of his Mark. “You can hardly see it.”
Harry shrugged. “I haven’t heard anything from Ron’s dad, or Percy. All they’ve said is that Shacklebolt has it under control.”
“Wish I could bring Kevin,” Blaise muttered. “Only eighth-years are supposed to leave unless it’s a Hogsmeade weekend, and he’s a real stickler for the rules.” Even as he complained, he had a grin on his face.
“So, what are you going to do with your old wand, then? Chuck it?”
“It’s a shame,” Blaise said, sighing dramatically. “Slytherin are going to be absolute rubbish without you.”
“Trelawney isn’t going to like this,” Pansy said, grimacing. “Not enough death or fatal injuries.”
“Yes.”
“And the Slytherins are invited, are we?”
“Oh, yes, what a great spot you’ve chosen,” he drawled.
“Yeah.” Harry shrugged, a nervous smile on his face. “He knows Viktor Krum, and Krum mentioned that he’s seen me fly—at the Tournament, you know—so Mr. Dawson wrote me over the summer. Their Seeker is retiring.”
“Which is?”
Draco regretted the lie, but he hadn’t known what else to say. “Expel me? I don’t know. I don’t want to tempt them.”
And with that, his father’s face disappeared. The fire crackled low in the hearth, as though Lucius Malfoy’s face had not been there a moment earlier. It could have all been a dream, and Draco was sorely tempted to go back to bed, wake up in the morning, and pretend none of it had happened. He was experiencing a sickening sense of déjà vu: the last time he had tried to sneak something into Hogwarts, it had ended disastrously. But his only other option was to ignore his father. That wouldn’t be impossible, given that his influence had shrunk substantially, but if he had learned anything from their conversation just now, it was that his father was not as helpless as he had thought. It seemed that he was not entirely without friends—though he wondered whether these were really friends, or rather vultures come to prey on the last of the Malfoy fortune. And, of course, there was the question of this package he was meant to collect. He had a suspicion that it was something illegal, probably some dangerous artifact this Rochefort had acquired from God knew where. But what was it? And how would it help his father evade Azkaban? And, perhaps more pressingly, how was his father so sure that the Ministry couldn’t monitor their Floo conversations?
“I was going to! At the library. I was working up the courage,” she admitted. “But then you left, and you seemed really upset, so…”
“I’ve noticed something,” Draco said. The words came out before he could stop them. “You have loads to say here, but you were quiet, the other night. At the Three Broomsticks.”
“You think we would have ended up together?” Draco asked. “If we hadn’t?”
“Just casting over and over until something happens?”
about you, Draco.”
“I’d do anything to take it away,” Harry said. “I’d have done anything to stop it.”
“You were so good for me,” Draco murmured, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck. “Fuck, I can’t believe you. You’re always so good for me.”
“Er—no.” He frowned. “No. That was a different business. And probably best kept to yourself. The point is, your mother and I need your help, Draco. We’re in a very bad spot. By now, most of the others have settled on plea bargains, and of course it’s all the usual nonsense—saying they were under the Imperius Curse or pointing the finger elsewhere.”
“And how are we supposed to avoid the teachers?” he asked. “It’s after curfew.”
“I told her to drop it, and she did. But we’ll see how she is tomorrow. She’s
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” Weasley spat.
Before Draco could answer, Harry pushed the bowl of Floo powder into his hands, picked up his trunk, and then walked over to the grate. He tossed the powder into the fire—the flames leapt to life, flashing bright green. Harry stepped in, dragging his bag after him, and said clearly: “Blaise Zabini’s.” At once, he was gone.
and never really let Draco do it properly, but before he could manage to get the words out Potter tugged his wrist more insistently. Deciding that he couldn’t wait any longer, Draco slowly eased himself in, tensing at Potter’s sharp hiss.
“I’ve got an idea,” Harry said, a smile tugging at his lips.
They walked along in silence. Draco desperately wished that he and Harry could communicate telepathically. In his mind, he urged Harry to check the Marauder’s Map. If there was ever a time for his possessive paranoia, this was it. Surely, if Draco were gone for a while, Harry would come looking for him. Wouldn’t he?
“You’re fine, you’re fine,” Draco scoffed, waving the insect away. “Are you a witch or not?”
“Harry!” he squeaked. Draco almost felt guilty: Goldstein looked absolutely petrified.
“You didn’t.” Draco crawled out of bed and stood there for a moment, watching Harry. His hair was as messy as Draco had ever seen it. His clothes were ruffled from sleeping in them all night. Draco took out his wand, meaning to perform a basic Ironing Charm for him, when he froze.
“Maybe Pansy and Blaise already told her,” Harry suggested.
“Go on. One drink.” Potter had lowered his voice and leaned closer; their hands were nearly touching on the counter.
“Oi!” Ron glared at him, but there was no heat in it.
“Shouting at you?” Draco asked. “Why was she shouting at you?”
“I saw you two whispering together, holding each other.”
“And what about that time in the…in the room. With Vincent.”
“Alright.” Who was Draco going to tell? It wasn’t as though he spoke to Daphne’s sister, or anyone else who might be interested in her career ambitions.
“It’s, well…” Draco took a deep breath. This was it, then. “It’s just a Cure for Boils.”
“Never going to let that go, are you?” he mumbled, turning to gaze back up at the sky. The wind was brisk, rattling through the dry leaves as it whipped by.
“I’m okay,” he said. “S’good. More.”
They both looked up as they heard a sharp
“And Kreacher served the Black family. When Sirius died, he left everything to me, including his house. And that’s how I sort of…inherited him. It was Dumbledore’s idea to have him work here. I’ve told him he could go back to Grimmauld—to Sirius’ old house, if he wants to—but he’d be lonely. And he likes it here.”
“I was having a shower.”
“You can’t be serious.” Harry made a face. “You can go to Hogsmeade any old time.”
Slughorn sighed, leaning back into his chair. “I suppose…” He looked away, gazing at a painting of a pastoral scene. “I understand that you need your N.E.W.T.s. Perhaps a tutor?” Slughorn glanced over and, at the sight of Draco’s face, said, “Never mind, then. It was only a thought. Well, I’ll be waiting for an improvement. Otherwise, we may have to discuss again…”
“That isn’t true,” Harry said quietly. “I’ve seen your memories. Your mother didn’t want you to get the Mark.”
“How should I know what the Wizengamot will and will not believe?” his father snapped. “They’ve got more than enough rope to hang me with.”
Hedwig had been Harry’s owl, he knew. But he didn’t want to talk about that. He didn’t want to talk to Harry at all. Heart pounding, he swung his bag over his shoulder and stood. “I was just leaving.”
“No. That’s not why we stopped. I told you, we never got that far.”
“Mmm?” Potter shifted. After a moment, he said, “Oh. Right. I guess I did.”
“Draco!” she cried. “This is your father we’re talking about. Of course you can blame them. If you heard the rumours, the things they’re saying, what they plan to do to your father if they find—” She suddenly stopped, face stricken.
“You could just tell us, you know, save us all the—oh!”
“I’m fine,” he muttered. In the bright light of the entrance hall, he felt exposed, as though all of his thoughts were written plain across his face for anyone to read. “I’m just tired.”
He jumped as the pub door burst open. To his surprise, Potter came stumbling out.
“You must have,” Pansy insisted. “Why else would they have let you off?”
“What do you want?”
“Mr. Dawson wrote me a while ago,” he said. “He wants to see me fly again, he said.”
Nott eased himself into the armchair across from them. “Draco pulled that card?” He grinned. “Feeling emotional, are you, Draco? A bit weepy?”
plans.”
“I don’t,” he said quietly.
“I think he was worried about my reaction,” Draco murmured.
“And you ripped me apart!” Draco was shouting now. “You used that—that curse, whatever the fuck it was—I could have
“Malfoy.” Potter was looking back at him.
Harry considered his question. “A bit sad. I think we were all trying to keep things light, but it’s hard, you know. Hard to find a topic that isn’t related to something painful.”
“I-I don’t remember. Not really. It’s…it’s just about gone.”
“Fine then.” Potter exhaled and sat back in his chair, throwing his quill down. “You take over.”
“Don’t go.” If they hadn’t been so close, Draco would not have heard him—Potter barely mouthed the words.
“Yeah.”
“Harry,” Draco said, testing the sound on his lips. It wasn’t unpleasant. Frightened by the way his heart squeezed in his chest, Draco snapped, “Don’t think this changes anything. You’re still a big prat.”
The next morning, he woke up groggy. He wasn’t hungover after only two drinks, but he was exhausted. Although his wristwatch told him it was already nine, he was tempted to fall back asleep until he remembered his stupid meeting with Potter. By the time he had showered, brushed his teeth, and dressed, he had no time for breakfast, and so he made his way directly to the library. Potter was sitting at a table alone—Draco was surprised to find that he didn’t have his usual gaggle of admirers. Draco dropped his satchel on the desk and then slid into the seat across from Potter, who scowled at him. There was an uncomfortable silence as he took a quill and an inkpot out of his bag. As Draco searched for a spare bit of parchment, his stomach lurched when he noticed his old wand sitting at the bottom of the bag. He hadn’t been able to decide where to keep it, and so he left it in his satchel, strangely soothed by its constant presence throughout the day.
Draco scowled at her and gave an irritable huff, but he followed her all the same. The dungeons were freezing. “Aren’t you cold?” he asked miserably, wrapping his cloak tighter around his frame.
“Well, we broke it off because I had to go find the Horcruxes. And, you know, it was too dangerous. I didn’t want her to get hurt.” When Draco said nothing, he continued, “So, anyway, it’s a bit awkward now. Between her and I. It wasn’t at first—that’s what I don’t get. Everything was fine. But now…”
Pansy sat up straight in her chair, eyes wide. “
Uncomfortable, Draco rose to his feet. “Yeah. Well, I never really had the chance to, er, talk to him properly after…everything. But as far as you two go…of course I’m fine with it.” At the look of gratitude on her face, he held up his hand. “
mad,” Nott said. “You must’ve said something awful. I’m surprised he sent you back to the common room in one piece.”
Harry obeyed immediately, gazing up as Draco stroked himself. So slowly it bordered on cruel, he brought his cock towards Harry’s mouth, letting it rest against his lips. Harry kept perfectly still, well aware that Draco would go through with his threat if he misbehaved. But his hands nearly trembled with the urge to reach up and feel. Gradually, Draco put his cock past Harry’s lips and into his mouth, giving out a soft gasp that travelled all the way to Harry’s cock. He knew by now that it was Draco’s noises that undid him, more than anything.
“Oh!” Luna dug around in the purple satchel slung over her shoulder. “Here, let me find you a copy, you can read for yourself…moon frogs, they’re funny little critters, though we don’t know much about them…”
Now more fully awake, Draco looked up at the ceiling. He was in the Room of Requirement. His dormmates must be wondering where he was. Smirking at the thought, he gave in to the pleasure of stretching languidly across the bed. He checked his wristwatch: it was about to turn six. He couldn’t remember the last time he had slept for so long. For once, his mind was at ease. He wasn’t gripped by the nervous energy that usually sparked through his body, or the "what-if" scenarios that regularly plagued him. He lay there a moment longer, enjoying the gentle stretch, when suddenly it occurred to him:
“What a night,” Dawlish was saying loudly. “Christmas dinner was an absolute nightmare—my mother-in-law, you've never met her, have you, Proudfoot, just unbearable—and I’d already been called away for a bunch of explosions up in Norfolk—can you imagine…”
Harry watched him. The silence between them was uncomfortable, but Draco didn’t know how to break it. Eventually, Harry said, “How’s your Mark?”
“Blaise!” Pansy hissed. “Now you’ve upset him!”
“Well.” Something funny was happening in Draco’s stomach. He couldn’t tell if he felt sick or not. Either way, he very much did not want to have this conversation in Flourish and Blotts.
He was angry with his father. Once again, he was in an impossible situation, where protecting his parents meant putting himself at risk. He was angry with himself, too. He should have learned by now not to question his father or delve too deeply into his affairs. It never ended well. If only he could be Obliviated, and go on living his life without knowing that the vial was a Portkey. A Portkey. How had his father managed it? Who was his contact at the Ministry? And how could they be certain that the Portkey would work, that it wasn’t a trap? His head spun as these thoughts whizzed by. It was as though he himself was hungover—dizzy, nauseous, and exhausted.
“I doubt I’ll be going far,” he murmured, a fresh wave of fear rippling through him. “I don’t know who’s going to want me.”
“Don’t you dare stop.”
“I thought…I didn’t know…” He had no idea what to say, or what Proudfoot expected of him.
, Draco.”
"Well, anyway, Slughorn says there’s all kinds of careers I could take up. I’m supposed to be meeting with him next week to discuss it. Brewing remedies for St. Mungo’s, for example. Wouldn’t that be brilliant? And well-paid, don’t you think?”
Harry crawled onto Draco and then kissed him again, kissed him with an intensity that left Draco dizzy. His hands strayed to the bottom of Draco’s shirt, and then pushed up under the fabric. He shuddered as the calloused fingers trailed along his stomach, coming up to brush against his sides. Wanting to feel more, Draco sat up and pulled his shirt off over his head. The way Harry looked at him set his heart to staggering. But he wanted to feel him, too, and so Draco tugged at Harry’s jumper. Finally, he relented, sitting up and pulling it off, along with the shirt underneath. At the sight of him, Draco couldn’t wait for Harry to ease himself back down; he pushed up and caught Harry in a kiss, taking his fill as he explored the bare expanse of his shoulders, the contours of his chest.
“No.” They couldn’t have this conversation. Why didn’t he fucking understand? Why did he insist on wearing down all of the boundaries Draco had worked so hard to set up?
As the carriage lurched forward, Draco rolled his eyes and turned away from her, gazing out the window. “I’m fine. You sound like my mother.”
“That’s not what I think.”
“They should have never—
Draco stared at him, feeling as though he had been Stunned. “What the hell is wrong with you? You and I don’t go around having drinks together. I don’t know what game you’re playing, if you’re trying to get me expelled, or thrown into Azkaban—or if this is some way to get to my father—”
Draco scanned the room, heart pounding—as far as he could tell, they had gone undetected. He eyed the stand carrying gloves and made his way over to it, forcing himself into a leisurely, unbothered pace. Though he wanted nothing more than to rush out of the shop and make his way back to Hogwarts, he slowly picked through the dragon-hide gloves, trying his best to appear innocent. Finally, when he felt that enough time had passed, he selected a pair made of Opaleye hide; the scales shone brilliantly in the light. There was a small line at the counter to pay. Draco stood behind Padma Patil and Sue Li, silently urging them to hurry up with their transaction as they chatted with the dumpy witch behind the counter. Finally, they left. As Draco stepped up and placed the gloves on the counter, he watched as the witch’s smile quickly turned to a sharp look of displeasure.
“He’s a barbarian.”
Harry smirked, pushing him playfully. “Really? You nearly fainted when I pulled a Wronski Feint last time.”
“You’ve forgotten,” she said agreeably. “But there’s no such thing as erasing. Not really. When you think of everything that makes up the world, erasures are just as much a part of it. Attempts at erasing…attempts to change the past…those are all a part of the world, too.”
“What if you try now?”
“You know that we’re going to have to be a lot subtler, right?”
The Quidditch pitch had become his sanctuary until one incredibly awkward afternoon when Harry and his friends suddenly burst out of the Gryffindor changing room just as Draco settled into his usual spot. He froze as he saw Harry, both Weasleys, Finnegan, and Thomas stroll onto the pitch. He hoped he wouldn’t be spotted, but, of course, he was as unlucky as ever. Ron Weasley almost immediately noticed him. Even at that distance, Draco recognized the look of displeasure on his face. The Gryffindors stood there stupidly, looking between him and Harry, until finally Draco's mind connected with his feet and he jumped up. He hurried down the stands. He wasn’t sure why—he hadn’t done anything wrong, or particularly embarrassing—but he felt absolutely mortified at being caught alone by Harry of all people. He tried to reason with himself as he rushed back to the castle, but by then he heard Harry and his friends calling to each other as they flew above the pitch. Those moments were perhaps the most miserable of all. Harry seemed so unbothered, as though nothing had happened between them. And, inevitably, Draco felt a sharp pang of jealousy when he saw Harry with his friends. Try as he might, he couldn’t seem to push away the absurd voice in his head whispering ‘
But Potter was crowding him against the wall, and to Draco’s horror, he wasn’t shoving him off—rather, he had already tangled one hand into Potter’s hair, and before he knew what was happening, they were kissing. Again. Only this time, there was something desperate about the way they clung to each other: Potter had him pressed against the wall and was kissing him almost angrily. Draco twisted his hand deeper into Potter’s hair, and his stomach flipped when he moaned. He hadn’t realized how much he had missed that sound: he had never expected Potter, of all people, to making such wanton noises. Draco was further surprised when Potter bit his bottom lip, nearly drawing blood. Potter suddenly moved his hands across Draco’s shoulders, and then trailed them down his chest, sliding towards his stomach.
“Open mine, then,” Harry said. He reached into the pocket of his dress robes and pulled out a piece of folded parchment. “He’s not here, but you’ll see when we get back to Hogwarts.”
Pansy, Daphne, and Millicent had arrived at breakfast donning Slytherin scarves and hats. Draco thought them rather ridiculous, but he kept his opinions to himself. He spotted Nott excitedly shaking Harper’s hand, wishing him luck. The only upswing to all of this was that the
“No. You wouldn’t,” Harry said in a thoughtful voice. “I think you’d be brilliant.”
He stepped back and shook his head. “I need to go. Stay the hell away from me.”
Draco flushed. “Well, excuse me if I don’t giggle and preen like the rest of your admirers.”
“Dunno."
“Do you have it on you? The Portkey?”
“That...” He gave a deep sigh. “I’m sure you saw, in the papers...your poor mother...it’s difficult for her, seeing our business plastered all over those bloody rags...but anyway...” Draco jumped as his father suddenly set off into a coughing fit, at one point ducking out of view as he wheezed.
“Looks like you’ve got it,” Draco said. “You should be good on your own now.”
“Here, open my gift,” Draco told Harry, tossing it to him. “It isn’t much, but…you’ll like it.”
“Three…two…one…”
“Too much clothes.” Brusquely, Potter sat in Draco’s lap and started to peel off their shirts. It was unbearably hot in the room. Draco reached over to the bedside table for his wand, but Potter stopped him.
“What?” Draco’s heart stopped.
“What?” There was a deafening silence as Harry stopped ripping the grass from the earth. Draco didn’t dare look up at him. “You think…you think…I didn’t mean it like that. Draco. Look at me. Hey.” He felt Harry’s hand on his arm. “Look at me.” Draco shook his head, refusing. “I don’t think
“Let’s wait for Hermione to do her research,” Harry said. “She’ll think of something. And in the meantime, the term is almost over, and then you can relax. You’ll be home, you’ll be more comfortable—”
Potter glared at him as he stood and swung his bag over his shoulder. “Seven-thirty,” he repeated before striding out of the Great Hall.
Potter shrugged. “I guess.”
His father gave a frustrated sigh. “It’s a Portkey, charmed to respond only to my touch. The moment I touch it, I—and whoever else is touching me—will be transported out of the Manor.”
“I’m not stopping,” Draco said flatly. “That’s half the reason I want to stay.” When she opened her mouth to argue, he said, “I want this thing gone, Pansy. You don’t understand.”
“Yes.”
Just as he located his pyjamas, Draco paused and turned to Harry. “Do you think it means anything, that my mother put your things in here? Instead of in a guest room?”
“You’re brilliant,” he said shakily.
“Please.” A flush of arousal burst through him, so strong that he had to slip his hands between his knees to stop himself from reaching out. “Fuck me with your cock. I want it. Be rough with me.”
Draco groaned. Some of the Gryffindor eighth years had decided to organize a party in the Room of Requirement. It was supposed to be a secret, and so far, the teachers seemed none the wiser. He had no interest in going, but Pansy had been pestering him all week, and he knew he was going to give in. From the rumours circulating, there was supposed to be alcohol, music, and food nicked from the kitchens.
“Tell me what Blaise is up to, then.”
Draco opened the door and made to leave when Potter reached out and flattened his collar. “Thanks,” he mumbled, oddly incapable of meeting Potter’s eyes.
Draco glanced over at the end of the table. Weasley was dumbfounded, Granger was staring down at her hands, and Harry looked furious. This was ridiculous.
“Who knows? Stranger things have happened. It seems our Saviour can ask for just about anything these days and get away with it.” More than Pansy could possibly imagine.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “He doesn’t
“Yeah. Ron’s playing Keeper again.” Potter held up a hand before Draco had a chance to respond. “Whatever you have to say about him, I don’t want to hear it.”
“Draco!” Pansy cried as he trudged over. “What the hell was that about?”
Potter stared at him, eyes wide in surprise. Not knowing how to ask him for a private word, Draco ignored Weasley and Granger’s angry faces and whispered, “We have to skip tonight. I’m going to Hogsmeade.”
Draco felt as though he should say something, but he was lost for words. He felt a peculiar pang as he dipped out of the doorway and quickly strode down the corridor. He met no one on the way back to his common room, and thank God—he wasn’t sure he had enough sense to fabricate an excuse for being out so late. By the time he reached his dorm, it was just past eleven. Of course, Nott and Zabini were still awake, lounging on their respective beds. Nott was flipping through
“How do you feel?”
“You don’t need to look so nervous, Draco,” she muttered. “I’m not going to punish you like a little boy.”
“This is Draco,” Harry said, nodding towards him. “He’s a…a friend of mine.”
“Close enough, isn’t it? Come on, one drink. We’ll use that empty classroom on the fifth floor.”
Draco looked away, annoyed. Potter leaned down and pressed his lips against Draco’s neck. He whispered into his ear, “I saw you. Saw every time you looked my way.”
“Harry,” he shouted to be heard over the wind. “Let’s race each other. Five laps, come on.”
“Well, he can’t just punish you whenever he feels like it. He’s not a teacher,” said Millicent. Draco winced at her words—Potter hadn’t exactly punished him, had he? Though he had certainly been stern with him...
“I don’t know. He seemed to think you had enjoyed his company last year.” Zabini glanced at him and smirked.
“Fine. And Weasley and I are perfectly happy on last name basis, thank you very much.”
“Probably.” Draco ground his neem leaves into a watery green oil. Next to him, Harry did the same. Up at the front of the class, someone laughed loudly. The sound ripped through him. All at once, his knees buckled, nearly sending him to the floor. The pain in his Mark was immense. Before he could stop himself, he dropped his pestle onto the bench with a loud clatter. A sickening scene flashed before him: his aunt Bellatrix, jeering as she dueled someone Draco couldn’t see…and then there was a blinding flash of light, and he knew that they were dead, and he felt his stomach turn…and still, his aunt was laughing…
"You won't believe what Daphne did, though," Nott laughed. "Guess who she invited to come along with us? Go ahead and guess."
