“Yes. Well, anyway,
“Stupid Gryffindors,” Pansy mutters. McLaggen ignores this and continues talking.
“I never thought you were terrible.”
“But I have to do it,” Harry said. Draco cocked his head to the side in confusion. “The prophecy.”
“I get results.”
it was the best bite of meat he had ever had. It was so tender, it practically melted on his tongue and it was rich and savory and he thought he had died and gone to food heaven.
He blinks and when he opens his eyes, the room has transformed. He is in what appears to be a barn, with a horse tied up in a stall in the far corner. A stooped witch with wispy gray hair is staring at him, brandishing a walking stick at him.
“I did, didn’t I?” Harry says. “But I would also argue, there’s no need for the charade right now.”
“For someone who claims to be straight,” Harry says. “You sure seem interested in getting us naked with us.”
“Really.”
idiot,” Seamus said, tapping the tip of Justin’s nose with a forefinger. He turned back to Ron. “So, party at the Shrieking Shack this Saturday then?”
Draco responded to this movement by pushing their hips closer together. Harry inched his hand lower and steered Draco more forcefully into the corner. The blond relented. He was distracted instead by moving his hand up Harry’s shirt and running his fingers over Harry’s stomach. Draco’s hands felt so good on him that Harry’s breath caught in his throat and he stumbled slightly on the uneven floor.
Draco is awoken in the middle of the night on Monday, by a rattling noise, which is coming from the corridor outside of Draco’s bedroom. As he has work in the morning, he and Harry are staying at his house. Draco is surprised that it hasn’t woken Harry, but then Harry
“Kreacher will do that.” He reached up and took the Cup out of Harry’s hands. He looked down and frowned at it. “This is not a normal cup.”
“-Yes, yes. I know. No unauthorized recordings on Ministry property,” Pansy says quickly. She mentally kicks herself for even suggesting it.
“Yes. I practically live with him.”
“Even better.”
“Very much so.”
“Sure you were.”
Of course, Draco had made the dinner slightly awkward by clumsily hitting on Seamus after too many glasses of wine, but Seamus had been gracious about it. He stops by the bookstore from time to time, but Draco hasn’t seen him since he started fake dating Harry. (Or is it real dating now?)
“The operative word there being ‘seems’.” Harry laughs again and Draco checks his watch.
“How is Rose?”
“Ah,” said Blaise.
“Oh, you’re back,” McLaggen says. “Can you help him into the rest of the costume. I’m going to go and change.” Pansy followed McLaggen a moment later, leaving Harry with Draco.
“Yes, you do,” Blaise said. Draco scowled.
“I imagine he’s quite good at that,” Blaise said. For half a moment he was oddly jealous, but he let the feeling go. Hermione nodded absently. She began to pack up her things and he cast around wildly in his mind for something else to say. He didn't want her to leave yet, not while they were getting along so well. Houses be damned. He wanted to be her friend. Or perhaps more, said a part of him that he ignored.
“Yes.”
“But I don’t
There were no specific toasts this time around, just a nod that rippled around the group before they tipped the alcohol back.
“I was trying to tell you that earlier,” McLaggen says.
Legilimency on Cormac McLaggen goes exactly how Pansy would have expected it to. It doesn’t help that they have both had alcohol. It means that Pansy’s delving into McLaggen’s mind is sharper than intended and it also means that McLaggen is far more loose with what he shows her.
big,” Harry replies.)
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. “I don’t have parents. Is that not something you should say someone’s mother?”
“And yet, Harry took me to the Three Broomsticks on Tuesday.” Her eyebrows shot up. Glancing over at Ron, she noticed he was grinning at her surprise. She turned her glance into a glare.
“Oh,” he says. “I mean,” he pauses, thinking carefully for a moment. “I could try to take them if you need me to?” But Granger waves this suggestion off.
“Where is this party taking place?”
“But Seamus
On Monday, the six of them staked a claim in one corner of the Slytherin common room - not that there were many other Slytherins staying at Hogwarts for the Christmas break to challenge them to a spot. In fact, the few Slytherins who were around took one look at the six of them and scarpered (helped on by glares from Draco and Pansy).
The sun beat down on Hogsmeade Station. The weather had been particularly nice since the fall of Voldemort, Of course, Harry thought it had very little to do with the fall of the Dark Lord, and everything to do with the fact that it was summertime. End of year exams had been canceled — even the standardized ones, which had been put off until later in the year — as a treat, though some of the OWL and NEWT students had grumbled about having to come back to sit their exams in September.
“You sure know how to pick them, Potter,” she says as she releases Draco. “He’s gorgeous.” Draco can’t help the smile that creeps across his face. She bustles them further into the office, chattering to Harry about the last time he graced the Witch Weekly cover, while Draco walks along in silence, taking it all in.
“I’m still working on besmirching your family name,” Harry said, leaning in to nibble Draco’s lower lip. “As I said before, that requires properly despoiling you.”
“He’s Harry’s,” Draco says. “But he likes me better because my mother was a Black.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, proud of himself that he hadn’t said anything to upset Hermione. “Hermione is totally cool with perhaps underage, but perhaps not depending on how the Slytherin common room is zoned, drinking.”
“Same way as during the War, I s’pose,” Harry says. “Ask her something only the two of you would know.” Ron nods slowly. “But make it casual.”
Hermione looked for a moment like she was going to give some reasons as to why not but she took one look at Harry’s face and snapped her mouth shut.
“Do you still hate me?” Cormac asks as she sinks back down on to the couch next to him.
getting in trouble?” Harry looked around. The corridor was still deserted. He wasn’t sure why he’d even bothered looking, but it was private business and he didn’t want anyone overhearing. He pulled the phial out of his pocket and held it out to Draco.
He finds his opening when Greg runs to the little wizards’ room. As soon as Greg is out of earshot, Harry leans forward across the bar and says,
“Shall we?” Ron asked, gesturing towards the Three Broomsticks.
“But,” she says. “That’s when you told McLaggen you loved him. Your interview was on Halloween night.”
“Truth or Dare?” Massi asks. Is it Harry’s imagination, or does Massi look a tad upset that Draco volunteered to go first? He tries not to read too much into it.
“Ow,” he cries, leaping backward and putting a hand to his cheek.
tried doing work while he’s in the room? I love Ron - he’s great - but he’s a chatterbox and I don’t have time for his blathering on right now.”
But it seemed that they would. They fucking would. Those absolute bastards.
“It’s an oddly useful room,” Draco mused. “I wonder how it came into existence?” Harry shrugged.
“This will be fun,” Massi says, straightening Draco’s bowtie. “It will be a very exciting evening.” Draco blinks for a moment, overcome with a feeling of deja vu, until he realizes this is a mirror of Harry convincing him everything would be fine before the opening night of La Scala. And yet, here they are.
“Sorry, what?”
“We could. We could take my invisibility cloak.”
“Oh?” he asked.
“You look nice,” Harry says once he is dressed. “I can’t wait to take those off of you again.” Draco smirks at him before taking him by the hand and leading him out of the door. They find Massi waiting for them in the lobby and the three of them make their way out into the town.
“The what?”
“I think I’m going to call it a night,” Draco says. “We do have work in the morning, after all.”
“As I said, I’m dating a professional celebrity. We’ve almost been kidnapped once already - on our first date in fact. So yeah, he’s prepared for all kinds of attempts on his life.”
He wanders the party in search of the brunet, but instead runs into Greg. He is no longer attached at the mouth to Pansy, something that Draco is grateful for. In fact, she is nowhere to be seen.
“Harry,” Ron hissed. “Behave yourself. Colin’s right behind you.”
“Sure. Do you want to be my date to the Slytherin Halloween Party on Friday?”
“We’re invisible.”
“Justin,” Seamus said.
“For your information, Potter,” Draco says. “I had planned on driving home.”
“Your ice cream parlor?”
And now? Now He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’s head was sailing past Ron, spewing blood in wide circles as it spun. It was the most disgusting and yet most beautiful thing Ron had ever seen. The head fell to the floor with a dull thunk. They all stared at it.
“So we have no confirmed members?” she asks. McLaggen shakes his head.
“Uh, welcome back to my house,” he says. “This is my floor.” And then he feels really stuck up saying it. Because while it’s true that the entire floor is his, it shouldn’t entirely count as a floor. Perhaps he should have said this tower was his, because that
Harry was very intrigued by the idea of a beet pannacotta, but when he tried it, it was rather strange. Not unpleasant, per se, but not something he would actively seek out again.
“Fair point.”
?” he asked.
“Guess we should open it,” he said. Harry gently tore the paper open to find two pairs of mismatched socks (which were clearly Dobby’s doing) and two packets of cheese and onion crisps, which Harry assumed were from Kreacher. In all fairness, he might have expected worse from Kreacher at the start of the year and the fact that the house elf had warmed to him at all (but really had probably warmed to Draco) was something.
“He might have mentioned it,” Harry said.
“And in all fairness,” Draco says. “The embroideries are
Bring parchment and quills. Also your brains.
the Malfoy Christmas dinner would have
“Yes, dear,” he said. “They’re lovely.” He let go of Draco’s hand and instead put both of his hands on Draco’s waist, pulling him close. “But do you know what’s even nicer?”
For the first time since joining the Flourish and Blott’s team, she looks at him properly. He has aged into his looks, in a way that he never could have in school. His face has lost any of the baby fat he had and his cheekbones are now pronounced. He had always been larger than Draco, but now it is because he has muscles and not just bulk.
“It has nothing to do with Blaise,” Pansy said. “I wanted it to be you the whole time.”
“Then I suppose you’ve experienced my hospitality first hand.” Narcissa picked up her teacup and takes a delicate sip. Her nose wrinkles briefly in delight.
“Of course. I want to have you all over this school.”
Images of Fiendfyre crackle in front of his eyes and he does his best to repress a shudder. He grips Harry’s hand more tightly, willing the flashback to end, willing it to not ruin his night.
worst. She shifts slightly in her seat until she’s not quite as close to him and raises her glass to her lips.
“It means usually I do the fucking.”
“Right,” Harry said once they reached the trapdoor that led to Honeydukes. “I’m going to have to ferry us out one or two at a time.” He saw Pansy frown at him in confusion, so he reached into his bag and pulled out his invisibility cloak. Her mouth fell open in shock.
‘You don’t want to do that,’ the voice in the back of his mind says again. It sounds a lot like Harry. Oh! Harry! Draco would much prefer to get on his knees for Harry. But Harry isn’t here.
“So is anyone going to fill me in on the whole Simurgh Society thing?” Draco asks. Pansy sighs.
“Uh, lower body injury,” Harry said quickly. “But it's all better now, thanks to Professor Snape.”
remember them and that’s why I’m concerned that she doesn’t.”
“Because,” she started to say, but then she couldn’t come up with a reason. “Oh fine.”
By the time Draco had finished telling Harry everything, there were streams of tears making their way down Draco’s face.
“What is Colin Creevey doing at this party?”
“You really want to know?” Ron asked.
“Hermione was right. It starts at nine.” Ron looked at his watch and scowled. They still had fifteen minutes to kill. He looked around at the piles of desserts and wondered whether he should eat some more of them, or if the additional sugar would make him even more on edge.
“What was?” Blaise asked from the adjoining bathroom.
“The what?” Seamus asked
“Well, Professor,” he said. “Pansy and I have been strategizing how best to get the Death Eaters, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and his snake into Hogwarts and how to split them up once they’re here. We reckon that we should encourage them to use the Vanishing Cabinet in Borgin and Burkes once Draco, Blaise and Hermione fix it. This has the benefit of only allowing a few people through at a time. Once they emerge, we draw them out into the castle, so they become separated.
“What?” he asks, pulling the stockroom door open. McLaggen is standing there.
“Who else is on this task force?” Pansy asks. In all the time they’ve spent together in the past two days, the subject has yet to come up. But if the Simurgh Society has someone in their midst with the power to send the Reliquary away for an indeterminate amount of time, she hopes the group trying to stop them might have some similar brass. Though Cormac’s words have her thinking otherwise. She braces herself.
“Shit, I’m sorry. I’m supposed to be making you feel better, and here I am reminding you of things and making it worse.” Draco sighed.
“Stands to reason this is where it would go,” Hermione said.
“No, but Granger filled me in. There was chatter about an object in Zermatt that was planning to be stolen. No information on what the object was, but rumor had it, the Battaglia family were going to be behind the robbery.”
“Why not?”
“Well maybe I made a mistake,” Draco said. He looked down at his feet, unable to look Harry in the eye any more.
he looked. At Dumbledore’s words, Draco faltered. He didn’t know what he would have done. Researched it more, he supposed. He said as much. “And you think that I didn’t? This was never my intention. It was the back up plan, the last ditch hope, while I searched for another way.”
“I meant take advantage of him in a duel,” Draco snapped.
“I did it to myself,” Harry said.
“There aren’t any.”
“But-“ Pansy starts to say, but McLaggen cuts her off.
“I am now.”
“You,” he says. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry sees Malfoy twitch.
Blaise started to say something but Harry shushed him. It was best not to interrupt Hermione when she was thinking like this. After about thirty seconds, where both Blaise and Draco started to say things but Harry shut them up either by waving at them, or in the case of Draco, lightly kicking him, Hermione looked up again.
“Brilliant,” Ron said. “Uh, no offense Professor,” he added, looking at Dumbledore.
“Honestly,” Harry said, staring down at the assortment of sweet things. “I was going to go over there no matter what you said.”
Their lips meet again and this time neither of them hold back. Whatever restraint they had shown thus far (very little, if any) is gone. Draco feels practically devoured as Harry licks, sucks and nibbles his way around his neck. He hopes Potter won’t leave a mark, though a small part of him hopes he will. Harry had said that Draco had Harry, but Draco would argue that Harry has Draco too and he wants the world to know it.
Pansy spends most of her morning avoiding Greg. While she will take Draco’s word that he’s changed, she is not overtly willing to have a conversation with him yet. She knows what Azkaban can do to people and she hasn’t had enough sleep to deal with a broken version of the friend she once knew.
“The Slytherin Halloween Party.” When he stood back, Colin’s eyebrows were so high that they were threatening to disappear into his hairline.
“No,” the other man said quietly. “I suppose not.” Seamus’s mouth twisted in concern.
“What are you? Twelve?”
“Fred and George Weasley, actually,” Harry says.
“That’s what Draco calls his Reliquary moments,” Pansy explains. McLaggen nods.
“Pansy
“We wait for someone else to come along,” Luna said. Harry frowned and checked his watch. He didn’t have time to wait for someone else to come along.
“Good luck,” Draco said. “See you on the other side.” Then Harry dropped the tapestry again and he was lost to view.
“Thank you for disarming me, I guess.” Harry shrugs.
And then Harry's finger breaches him and he can’t hold back anymore. Draco comes hard into Harry’s mouth, gripping the top of the bathroom stall to stop himself from sliding to the floor. After one last shuddering, amazing jolt, he sags, supporting himself by just one arm. He looks down at Harry, who is wiping his mouth, looking pleased with himself. He wants to tell him to wipe that damn smirk of his face while he's at it, but he can't bring himself to be upset just now. He's too bonelessly happy.
“Get him upright,” he said. Voldemort was blinking slowly up at him, clearly dazed from the stomp to the face. Ron and Draco hurried to comply, hauling Voldemort into a sitting position, though holding him at arm’s length as though they could tell what Harry was about to do. Harry rolled his shoulders once, twice, and then swung the sword with all of his might at the place where Voldemort’s head met his neck.
“Of course,” Draco relents. “What did you want to talk about?”
“Are you going to be stuck working back there for the whole night?” Hermione asked.
First there is a woman who holds up the checkout queue when she gets to the front and realizes she has forgotten a book and so sends Joe to get it for her, while not giving up her place in line. Then there is a man who Draco watches put a book into an inner pocket of his robes who insists that he hasn't. Draco and Greg corner him and make him turn out his pockets, only to find that he has an undetectable extension charm on the inner pocket and it takes him ten minutes to retrieve the book he has slipped in there. And lastly there is the wizard who keeps trying to ask for a discount for a veteran with one leg, despite having two perfectly good legs, which are both clearly visible under his slightly too short robes.
“This is fucking brilliant,” he said. He walked back towards the rest of them.
“The fish course,” Wilfie said, once the vegetable plates were cleared. “Is being a tempura fried black cod in dipping sauce with a cucumber foam on top with saffron strands.” He bowed low and the fish appeared. Harry looked down at it. It looked like fried fish that you might get at a fish and chip shop and was sitting in a pool of what looked like vinegar, but upon tasting was instead salty and sweet. The fish itself was delicate, buttery and a little bit sweet. Just when Harry had thought he had found a favorite dish (the lobster), he had now found another one.
“Oh, I believe it,” Harry said.
Draco stares up at the Malfoy Manor gates. They are tall and imposing, made of wrought iron, with twin Ms at the top, painted in gold. He knows these gates well - how could he not? But standing outside of them with Potter makes them feel oddly imposing. He takes a deep breath, squares his shoulders and takes a step forward. He reaches out and pushes the closest gate. It opens at his touch, and he ushers Potter inside before following.
There is the crash of breaking glass behind the closed door and Harry springs forward. Using his sleeve, he turns the doorknob and throws open the door. It hits the wall with a loud crack. The scene that meets them is grisly. There is blood. A lot of blood. Blood in pools under a pair of bodies. Blood in violent trails along the walls. A blood covered knife lies in the middle of the floor, between the two bodies.
Pansy rolled her eyes but didn’t argue. Her eyes flicked briefly over to Ron before returning to Draco and she realized that perhaps she had been unfair on him earlier.
“Good. See you in the morning.” Draco couldn’t help but smile at that.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Yes! We did it.” He reached up and smoothed Draco’s hair back down from where the blond had mussed it up in his distress. Draco smiled at him and then sighed.
“Are you suggesting that you’re not going to help?” Greg asks.
As he flew, he spotted the troll that had frightened Pansy. He couldn’t blame her for being alarmed. The thing was massive and if its head weren’t hanging off at an angle, Harry might have sworn it was a real, live troll.
“It looks like it wants you to read it,” Harry says.
“Brilliant,” he said. And they walked the rest of the way to Potions, chattering excitedly about their costume.
“We weren’t that bad,” Ron said.
? But he was the one who let us in.” Voldemort clicked his tongue. “No matter. He’s dead now. And you will be shortly.”
“I’m sure he has,” she says. “We all have.”
“Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck,” Draco repeated under his breath as he began to pace around the room. Harry wracked his brain for a solution, but nothing came. He wished he knew why the portkey hadn’t worked - then perhaps they could fix it. He walked over to the Cup and knelt down next to it. After staring at it for a long moment, he reached out and picked up the ring box. He turned it over in his hands, staring at it. But like every other portkey Harry had ever seen, it looked like an ordinary ring box.
“We’ll need broomsticks,” he says. “Or else we’ll get stuck down there.” He checked his watch. “And it might be a little late tonight. I don’t remember how long it took to get there last time.”
This feeling is compounded when Hannah stops by the shop and invites them to her annual Halloween party.
They spend the evening in Paris. Draco finds them a charming French bistro called Josephine Chez Dumonet and shows off the French skills that Harry didn’t know he had as he chats animatedly with the maître d’. Harry finds the menu being taken out of his hands and he looks curiously at Draco who waves away his concern.
“Thank you, sir.”
“‘Course.” Harry feels slightly dazed. He has never had to split the holidays between families before. He’s never even had to think about it. When he was with Ginny, there was no question as to where they would go for Christmas, but now… It quite suddenly hits Harry how real and serious his relationship with Draco is. It’s possibly the first serious one he’s ever had. Maybe he
“Oh, so you want to live dangerously then?” Harry asked.
He’d thought about little else since the party in the Shrieking Shack. It was hard not to, when Draco would catch his eye during class and Harry’s heart would skip a beat. Or when Ron and Pansy would sit so close together it was hard to tell where one of them ended and the other began, and Harry would look at them and
“You don't have the balls to be bald?” Seamus asked. He elbowed Ron good-naturedly in the ribs.
“So,” Ron said as they entered the Entrance Hall. “I had a great costume idea, but it's a duo costume idea and so I was wondering if we could do a best friends costume?” He looked at Harry with large, puppy dog eyes and Harry smiled, feeling a warm rush of friendship wash over him.
“This stuff is amazing.” He heard Ron sigh and then heard the sound of a cork coming out of a bottle. He lifted his head and watched as Ron drank his potion, still frowning. Harry propped himself up on his elbows and watched as Ron’s face went from one of suspicion to one of cautious optimism and then to straight up delight as the potion took effect.
“Right. Care to come visit the Cooler then? I assume that’s private enough?”
from the moment he’d stepped into the room. Fair play to her.
“So you’re hoping
friends,” he says. They are more than that, but he’s never going to tell her that. The thought saddens him.
“Really?”
And then finally it was Draco’s turn. Draco, who upon Harry throwing the silvery material over him, began immediately to kiss Harry rather aggressively. Harry pushed him away and the blond pouted at him.
“Should we use the internet?” he asks.
“I can see that.” She drains the last of her old drink and sets the empty glass to the side of the table. “Thank you.” He nods once.
“Should we go in one at a time?” Harry asked. He looked around the room. The “party” was very low key tonight. Most people were just sitting around with their friends, drinking and chatting. In the far corner there was a loud drinking game going on which seemed to comprise of most of the Hufflepuffs and Neville. No one was paying them any mind.
He’d avoided those books, focussing instead on some of the fiction books that were arranged along one wall. After some perusal, he’d settled on a muggle book that Draco’s decently sure Potter had added to the library, given its recent publication date. It was interesting, he’d thought, seeing what muggles thought magic might be like.
“You never mentioned that there was a disturbance at that event you went to,” Greg says. Draco nearly chokes on his coffee.
“Which means we need to stop him sooner rather than later,” Harry said firmly. “Before more innocent people suffer.”
“Oh, hi Colin,” Harry said. “Would you mind getting a shot of us?”
He shudders at the memory.
“I do, but I don’t like other people seeing you without clothes.”
“Do you know the story of the Three Brothers?” Dumbledore asked, turning to face Draco.
“And we really…?”
“Fair point,” he said. He put the last of the bottles on the table and whistled. “This is quite the haul.”
“Are you okay?” Draco asks. Harry takes a deep breath and gives a small nod. “No you’re not.” Draco pulls Harry into a hug and the other man slumps into his embrace.
“Welcome, all of you, to the Order of the Phoenix,” Dumbledore said. There was a small susurrous. Harry was decently sure that he heard Draco’s name amongst the whispers.
music and kicking his legs to the beat, so Harry did his best to imitate him. Sure enough, after finding the beat of the song, he did begin to enjoy himself. He looked back at Draco and smiled. He was amused to see the blond scowl back at him. So he shimmied his hips a bit more, still attempting to keep eye contact, until Draco gave him a small, begrudging smile.
“You’re a genius.” She waved off his compliment.
“Dobby will stay until Wheezie and friends are back,” he said.
Harry leans back in his chair and takes a long sip of his drink. Draco watches him. A small smile plays about his face.
“Shit.”
“Harry and Malfoy’s relationship seems to be going well,” she said.
He wonders if they are ever going to start training him in more defensive and offensive magic. He had thought he’d heard Tusneem or Croaker mention that when he was brought on board. But as he has heard nothing more on the subject, he is starting to wonder if he had imagined it.
“Well, if you’re having more,” the blonde mumbles before refilling his own glass. He finishes off his toast in another few bites and then leans back in his chair. He closes his eyes briefly and when he opens them, he blinks in astonishment, as Harry has picked up his empty plate and is walking it to the sink. Even as Draco starts to protest (feebly, to be fair), Harry picks up the sponge and runs the plate under the water.
“I wanted to eat here,” she says. “And you asked me to lunch. And Greg won’t come here because it
“I didn’t ambush you,” Draco hisses. “I just used it to get away.”
“What part of ‘I don’t need to know’ didn’t get through?” He puts a book on the shelf.
The room was, again, sparsely furnished, with just a bed and a pair of side tables, but as that was all they needed, it was fine. Being there, in the room, alone, with Draco was a strange combination of thrilling and terrifying. Harry was frozen to the spot, hardly even moving as Draco closed the door behind him.
“Is right where he left it. Though if I were you, I would forget you ever heard that phrase. Bad things tend to come to those who know too much.” She unspooled herself and began to slither away. As she reached him, she reared up and lunged at him, but Harry (perhaps stupidly) stood his ground. She snapped harmlessly in front of his face and laughed.
we had more.”
“I’m not stupid.”
“June is heaps better than July.”
“It’s
“It was certainly something,” Draco says. He does not elaborate more.
Also the Stanley Cup Playoffs are on. Don't you dare root for my team to lose so I'll write more. :P it's one of the few things bringing me joy right now.
“Hand me out some of the things you like,” Draco said. “Let’s declutter your fitting room.”
in Muggle London.”
“I love the swamp,” someone yelled from the Hufflepuff table. McGonagall turned her head towards the Hufflepuffs, the smallest of smiles on her face.
“I only took the picture because I thought you looked happy and it was beautiful.”
“Is that a threat?” he asks.
“Whatever you want,” Draco said. His voice was breathy. He let go of Harry’s erection and began to kiss his way down Harry’s torso, pushing Harry onto his back as he did. Harry, unsure of what else to do with his hands, tangled one of them in Draco’s hair. Draco looked up briefly, grinning at him in a way that made Harry’s stomach flip.
“That’s true,” he says. “And it’s quite lovely.” Harry leans in and captures Draco’s lips with his. And Draco is in heaven. Because he’s quite sure that Harry means it. That this kiss is real. (And that perhaps some of their earlier kisses may have been?)
“Fine,” she says. “You were saying there was something off about Granger.” Harry nods and takes a long draught of his beer.
For this, Draco wears a tan trench coat, while Harry wears just a plain white button-down shirt, which quickly turns translucent in the conjured rain. Perhaps, Draco thinks, the woman knows what she is talking about.
“Can you bring him here?” Harry thinks for the briefest of moments about protocol but then he banishes it from his mind. He nods and stands up. Pansy shifts her weight from one foot to the other before sitting down next to Hermione, taking Harry’s place. Hermione doesn’t hesitate, but falls into Pansy’s outstretched arms.
“Well, next time we sneak out of the castle, remind me to buy him a drink at the Three Broomsticks.” She grinned at Ron and Ron made a noise that made Harry think that she had just squeezed his arse.
While he waited for her to make her next move in their chess game, he stared out into the Entrance Hall. Though Hermione had protested that she was no good at chess, Blaise was of the opinion that she protested too much and was in fact quite good. She had mentioned several times now that Ron was a much better player than she was and this intrigued Blaise. He had not thought that this particular Weasley was overly intelligent, but it appeared that he must be. Perhaps his mother was right when she said that everyone had hidden depths.
“You were clearly looking around being sappy about us all having a good time.”
“Yes.”
“We should open it up to the rest of Slytherin too,” Blaise said. “It’s only fair.” Harry nodded, distracted.
“Yes, yes, Ron,” Seamus said as several people laughed. “Are we all having a good time?” People cheered their approval. “I can’t hear you! I said are we all having a good time?” The roar was almost deafening as the voices mingled and bounced off of the chamber’s walls. Harry looked over at Draco and grinned. It was a perfect moment. Or, at least, mostly perfect.
He revels in the feeling of Draco against his body and the feeling of their lips pressed together. If he could, he would distill the swell of joy in his chest and bottle it. Then maybe he could work on purifying it - taking out the bittersweet notes that taint it. He moves his hand to cup Draco’s cheek, stroking it with his thumb as their tongues roam.
“You are such a Hermione.”
Instead, they apparate back to Harry’s house, order take away and eat it, sprawled next to each other on the sofa. When they are done, Harry turns on the television and Draco falls asleep, slumping sideways into Harry. Harry carries him up to bed and helps him out of his shoes, trousers and shirt before tucking him in. Then he stands for a moment, just looking down at Draco. He smiles and tucks a stray piece of hair behind Draco’s ear. His heart gives a painful lurch of affection. And because Draco is asleep - and only because Draco is asleep - he whispers,
“I'm not sure,” she said eventually.
“Strange as in I didn’t put it there. It just appeared.” Greg frowns and eyes the stairs nervously.
we’re friends,” Harry said.
“Oh shut it.” Harry dragged him across the Common room by his hand and pulled him up the stairs.
“Does it matter either way?”
“In what way?”
“How was it?” Draco asks.
“Oh no,” Ron said. “Does this mean we’re going to the library again?”
“Dobby will get right on that,” he said. “Wait here and I will bring the four for your tower.” He scampered away, leaving Neville holding his tray of food. Neville picked up the doughnut and nibbled it while he waited.
“You don’t say,” Harry says. He knows he should be more polite. He knows they’re a team. But it’s
Harry stared down at the present in his hands. It was roughly cube shaped and wrapped so perfectly, Harry felt that only Draco could have wrapped it. Suddenly, Harry was nervous. He was glad that Draco hadn’t given this to him in front of everyone, even though he had no idea what it was yet. He tore the paper open gently and then stopped when he saw that it was, indeed, a jewelry box.
Yes, Harry decided, he wanted more of that. He climbed off of Draco, moving instead to lay next to him, their bodies pressed up together. And then with more skill than he thought he had, Harry quickly hooked a thumb under the waistband of Draco’s boxers and began to tug them down. This was impeded by Draco’s erection, which peeked out briefly through the front flap. Draco batted Harry’s hand away and shimmied out of them himself, which prompted Harry to go ahead and fully disrobe.
“I thought that was a rumor too,” she said. Now even Hermione was looking askance at her. “What? We were first years. I didn’t know whether I should take the rumors or Dumbledore seriously or not. He
“Harry,” Hermione said quietly. “Be more subtle.”
Without thinking about it, he reaches out and puts a hand on Harry’s shoulder. Harry flinches slightly but does not pull away.
“I’m no good at shots,” she muttered. Pansy shrugged.
“What?” he asks, far too sharply.
“I’m sorry,” he said quickly, his face falling. “I didn’t mean-”
“Oh,” Blaise said. “That’s fair. You probably wouldn't want that experience in a classroom.”
Massi had not been supposed to leave the theater that night, and it had ruined all of the plans that the family had. They’d been informed by a friend that Harry Potter works for the British Ministry and they had been planning to, shall we say incapacitate him. But the heads of the family had conferred and now they think it’s best if they take care of Harry at the important dinner with the Luczkowski family on Wednesday. There will be so many bodies, he might get lost in the shuffle. So Massi needs to keep Potter and his blond harlot close. The family doesn’t care how he does it, but they’re Massi’s responsibility now. Oh, and sometime before the dinner on Wednesday, Massi needs to pick up their newly acquired Hand of Glory.
Once Weasley is distracted by the Kreacher run bar (“Kreacher working, Harry? Blimey.”), Harry turns to Draco.
“And I wouldn’t have had it any other way,” Draco said. He took a step towards Harry and put a hand on his waist.
“May I?” She indicates his wand and he raises his eyebrows but hands it over. She uses it to summon a new pair of underwear from her bedroom. She hops down down the vanity and pulls them on. Then she smirks at him and hands his wand back.
“It was classified Ministry-”
“Oh, quiet you,” he says. “And come here.” Harry gestures towards himself.
“Don’t pin this on me, Amelia,” Croaker snaps. “No one saw this coming.” He shakes his head. He looks tired as he runs a hand through his thinning hair. “I don’t have a bloody clue why he did this, and I’ve spoken to his partner, and it seems like Potter was in the dark as well.”
“I do not,” Draco started to say.
“I think the real question, McLaggen,” Harry said, extricating himself from Cormac’s arm. “Is who the hell would invite you?” He stalked up the stairs, leaving a rather miffed McLaggen behind him. Ron pushed past the older boy and followed Harry into the sixth year boys’ room.
“They what?” McGonagall cried. Dumbledore chuckled.
in the house.
“I see why you would want to keep it a secret,” Justin carried on, ignoring Harry’s outburst and instead taking it as the yes that it was. “Don’t worry. I won’t say anything.” Harry shot him a grateful smile.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, his head drooping. “I’m just nervous. And when I’m nervous I talk a lot.” Draco sat down on the bed and pulled Harry down next to him.
This last task was made more interesting when three weeks into the new term, Dumbledore called the six of them, McGonagall, and Snape, into his office and announced that he was dying.
He joins Harry in the shower for expediency’s sake, batting Harry’s wandering hands away as he lathers shampoo into his hair.
Later, he fell asleep with her name on his lips.
“Why do you always call me McLaggen?” he blurts out.
“Nothing. I’m just drunk.” Harry nodded.
outside my window,” Harry says, changing the subject.
When Potter comes back inside, five minutes later, Draco is still sitting against the wall. Potter glances at him as he walks inside, and the door slams shut behind him. He drops Draco’s suitcase on the floor.
“She does mean like in Home Alone,” Ron repeated, nodding to himself. A small smile made its way onto his face and Harry could tell that he was already planning various traps in his head. Something that Professor McGonagall had said stood out to him, though. She’d said the Weasley Twins had known the school better than anyone, and that just wasn’t true.
Once they finish lunch, Harry and the Malfoys head back to the sitting room. While they’ve been eating, the house elves have tidied their piles of presents and cleared away any crumpled, spent wrapping paper. Harry and Draco each have three more gifts to open and Harry has come up with what he thinks are humorous guesses for his. He picks up a small, rectangular package from his pile and holds it up to his ear. He shakes it.
“Hi,” Pansy says. “Still here.”
“Is that so?” Draco’s tone was playful but his eyes were not. And suddenly Harry felt Draco’s hand reach inside his boxers and grab his cock. He gasped. “Who’s the bitch now?”
“I’ve been trying to get this pair of twinned cabinets to work, but it’s fiendishly difficult, which has bought me some time. They don’t know there are any other ways in, and I’m going to keep it that way. And I’ve already told my mother I'm staying here over Christmas, so that I won't get harassed by any of them over the break.” He paused here and took a long, shaky breath. “I don’t want to do any of these things they’re making me do.”
And again, Draco loses himself in the beat of the music. He closes his eyes and pretends Harry is someone else, someone who actually wants to date him, even though that imaginary person looks an awful lot like Harry. He awkwardly sips at his drink over Harry’s shoulder and soon his glass is empty. He looks around for a place to put it and steers them, still dancing towards a small table, where he puts it down. Harry, seeing what he is doing, knocks back the rest of his drink too and then Draco steers them back out into the throng of people dancing.
“I’m not too worried,” Ron said. Hermione had been gone for twenty minutes by now and Ron had taken this as a sign that they
He looked around and double checked that the cloak covered them both - and their clothes. It would not do to be found out because part of their trousers were visible.
,” Harry says. “You’re pregnant. This is too dangerous.”
,” she said.
“Sometimes you just know.” That seems to shut Greg up. Just for good measure Draco adds, “How are you and Pansy doing by the way?”
“You heard that?” Harry nodded.
“I’m fine,” he says in a small voice that transports her back to their fifth year, when they had still been best friends and Draco and Narcissa had come for dinner, shortly after Lucius had been locked up in Azkaban. And just like all those years ago, she wants to wrap her arms around him and hug the pain away. But just as back then, she does not. Because while that is what she would want, Draco is different. Instead, she squeezes his arm and sees the ghost of smile lift the corners of his lips.
“Did you really think that Harry would be able to keep a relationship private?” is what he finally comes up with. Greg shrugs.
“What is it?” Pansy asks in an undertone. But now that Harry is inside, he thinks he’s overreacting. Of course he is. There is nothing wrong with Hermione. He’s just tired and on edge. He chews his lip for a moment and then shakes his head.
“How are you so much better at that than I am?” Harry asks as he presses the elevator button.
“Why?”
“Why would we do that?”
It tasted like strawberries and mint and Neville found that he liked it. He pored over the text on the side and read that he was supposed to drink the entire bottle and so he did, gulping it down thirstily. As the potion hit his stomach, an icy hot sensation flooded through him. The coolness took away the edge of the pain and then the heat soothed it away. In a matter of minutes, Neville felt like himself again. He looked appreciatively down at the bottle again. He understood exactly why the potions were proving to be popular.
“No,” Pansy says with a quick eye roll. “But all the same, I don’t think Hermione would want you to be the one impersonating her.”
“Oh, shit. I’m sorry. That was completely insensitive of me. I just assumed you had…”
“Oh well,” Draco says. He closes his eyes as the feeling of warmth starts in his chest and then spreads over his body. The faint feeling of nausea dissipates and his headache leaves him. He takes a deep breath and marvels at how much better he feels. It’s been several years since Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes came out with the potions, and every time he has one, he is amazed at how well and how fast they work.
“Yes, and it was the Hit Wizards’ job to find him,” Director Saul Croaker spits back. They are both mad as hell and Major Pansy Parkinson stands awkwardly between them. She fiddles with her hands behind her back and looks back and forth between the two department heads.
“You know more about it than I do,” he says. She gives him a quick nod and then sits up straighter in her chair.
And so Dobby began his tale. It started with Patterson finding him in the kitchens, where Dobby had volunteered for the mission because Patterson had said it would help Harry Potter. Dobby would not look at Harry when he said this, and Harry was almost glad for that because although he didn’t know what was coming in the story, he knew it ended with a man dead. He could only imagine how terrible Dobby felt. In fact, he could see it in the sag of Dobby’s tiny shoulders.
“Death Eater training,” he said. Harry felt as though cold water had been tipped over him. Whatever he had been expecting, it was not that.
“Is that supposed to make me feel better?”
“How does shepherd’s pie sound?”
As he continued to bare his soul, he realized that tears were slowly trickling down his face. He put his hands up to his cheeks, horrified at how his body was betraying him, but Draco didn’t seem to notice. The blond was gnawing on his lower lip in obvious concern, but his eyes seemed miles away. Once he had reached the end of his latest sentence, Harry stopped talking and stared at Draco.
“Potter,” he said, once he was sure the two of them had added everything into their cauldron and could therefore be interrupted without consequence. Harry jumped in alarm and turned around, quickly dropping Draco’s hand.
“Draco,” Narcissa said. “I thought you understood me on Christmas Day.”
“Fine,” he says. “But this conversation is not over.” He begins to stride purposefully towards the door of the Leaky Cauldon, forcing Harry to jog to catch up with him. When he does, Malfoy’s face is set in the hard look that Harry remembers so well from Hogwarts. He reaches out and puts a hand on Malfoy’s arm. Malfoy spins to face him.
“I feel like this is showing off,” she said.
“Zabini,” Harry said, nodding at Blaise. Blaise seemed to snap back to attention at the sound of his name and he managed to flash Harry a small smile. Harry, oblivious to this, began to pile food onto his plate.
“I think I see where this is going,” Draco said. “And I think it ends up with the smallest Weasley jinxing me.” Harry snorted in laughter before he could stop himself.
“I don’t think you could ever be boring, Seamus,” Harry said. Seamus shot him a grateful smile.
“Potter.”
“Of course, Minister,” Hermione says. Croaker and Dempsey merely nod.
They reached Draco’s room and Narcissa swept them both inside and the closed the door behind them. Harry’s eyes swept the room, taking in the bedroom where Draco had grown up. It was clearly larger than the Dursley’s second bedroom, though not overly so, and much more nicely furnished. Draco had his own fireplace, in front of which sat a pair of tufted, dark brown leather chairs. Harry could immediately see why Draco preferred the Slytherin Common Room to the Gryffindor one - it reminded him of home. Draco’s bed was a surprise, however. Harry had expected Draco to have a four poster bed, given the decoration in the rest of the house, but instead Draco had a lofted bed with a desk underneath it.
“Gemino,” he said, tapping the shirt. This time it worked. A perfect copy appeared next to the shirt on the table and Draco whooped in delight.
“Show us one outfit,” Pansy amended. “We don’t need an entire fashion show.”
Not to mention that the fact that this terrified him meant that he was really developing feelings for Harry and that thought terrified him too. Why had agreed to go out with Potter in the first place? Well, that was a question he couldn't really answer. Not without admitting that Granger was right.
“What am I going to do?”
“Nothing like that,” he says. “I just figured that the Malfoy heir would only eat the best food.”
“But the prophecy broke, and the record of it was lost.”
Nothing happened.
“ Hermione looked around the circle and the other three nodded. They lifted their fangs and brought them down onto the diadem as one. Voldemort’s voice gave out in a long shriek. The diadem lay, now mangled and slightly smoking, on the desk. Snape walked over and picked it up.
“So you let him kill you?” McLaggen asks.
“Did someone say camera?” a voice behind him asked. Harry turned to see Colin Creevey standing behind him, a large grin on his face and camera in hand.
Cormac had seemingly taken it upon himself to comfort both Lavender and Parvati, wrapping his arms around both of their waists, though as Harry watched, Padma came over and dragged her sister away. Luna was standing in a mixed year group of Ravenclaws from Dumbledore’s Army that included Terry, Anthony and Cho. She looked as unperturbed as ever, staring up at the enchanted ceiling, even though her face was flecked with blood.
She had asked Blaise what the dress code was and he had shrugged and said,
“Yes, dark and rich. I mean, look at these sofas.” Draco gestured to the leather sofas that were grouped around the fireplace. “They’re so luxurious and comfortable.” Harry resisted rolling his eyes.
“Yeah, you do that.” Harry watches as he leaves. He knows he is being unprofessional, but he’s too upset to care.
“Vaguely,” Harry said, waving him away. “It’s a wall, somewhere. We’ll just wander the dungeons until we find you.” Draco rolled his eyes.
“He saw it on a map,” Ron said. Harry crossed his arms and glared at his friend as Justin started laughing.
“Should we throw it in the Chamber of Secrets?” Harry asked, remembering Seamus’s idea.
“Fuck it,” Draco said. “Yes.”
“Welcome to my home,” Massi says. They are in a grand entrance hall with a fifteen foot ceiling (at least), an intricate mosaic covered floor and marble pillars. There are various statues scattered around the room, which Draco can tell at a glance are from Roman times. It should look classy, but it doesn’t - it looks gauche.
“My family is very protective of the things it cares about.” As he says this, Massi rests a hand on Draco’s back. Draco isn’t sure if he should read anything into the gesture or not. He bites his lip nervously, and he’s not acting. Massi’s actions are starting to concern him. Is it possible Massi is showing him this because he likes him? “Come, come,” Massi says and nudges Draco through the next door.
She checks her watch as she makes her way down the corridor and finds that Dempsey has left her a message, summoning Pansy to her office. Without missing a step, Pansy alters her course. Within minutes, she is standing outside of the antechamber to the General’s office. She squares her shoulders and enters.
“Um, yes.”
“What did you have in mind for today then?” Draco asks. He catches Harry midway through a bite of toast and waits while Harry chews. He notes that in spite of an almost full night’s rest, Harry still has dark circles under his eyes. But then, after all the magic he performed yesterday, Draco is hardly surprised.
“Then I would like you to gently run your hands down your front and into your pants.”
“-To what? Hate people for no reason except that you think you’re better than them?”
“What did you want, McLaggen?” she asks. She waits while he finishes the sip of his G&T that he has just taken.
“And you’re a prick.”
I don’t know,” Seamus said.
“Oh, Pansy Parkinson, you’re going to be the death of me,” he says as he leans far enough over the table to kiss her.
“Should someone confirm that with Ron?” Harry asks.
“Really?” Ron asked. He tried not to sound too hopeful. “You’re not upset that we’re no longer doing best friend costumes?” Harry smiled.
Draco asks, his insides cold at thought. The animosity he was feeling towards Potter melts almost instantly when presented with this fact.
“Prat,” Harry says affectionately. He bends down and kisses Draco briefly on the nose before disappearing into the bathroom. Draco hears the shower turn on. He groans, then forces himself to sit up. Uncapping the potion, he throws it back in one go, shuddering at the bitter aftertaste. A moment later, the warmth from the potion starts to spread through his body and he feels well enough to get out of bed.
“Yes.”
What he saw made his heart clench with fear. Their friends were all standing over the prone form of the Dark Lord, peering at him as though they couldn’t quite believe he was dead.
“Because I think you’re one of the good ones,” McLaggen says.
“Why not?”
“Quidditch player’s been kidnapped,” he says, closing the Prophet. Pansy has made decent progress on sorting out the stockroom.
“Just your face.”
“You’re suggesting we go to your house? Right now?” Harry asks. Of all the things he had expected Malfoy to say, this had not even factored in. Malfoy’s mouth twists from side to side while he appears to think it over.
“Uh.”
“Can you lot get into your costumes first so
“You did,” he says as Harry bucks slightly. Harry finishes undoing the buttons on his flannel shirt and slips it off of his shoulders, letting it drop onto the bed next to Draco. Draco bites his lip, looking up at him, and then reaches out and runs one hand over Harry’s toned stomach. He pushes Harry away while he pulls his arms out of his own shirt. He is desperate for the feel of Harry’s naked torso against his.
“We should think about how best to lure the fake Hermione here,” Pansy muses.
“Exploding Snap?” Ron asked.
Ron chats idly about the Cannons before, after another twenty minutes or so, he falls asleep, his head lolling back on the cushions. Draco doesn’t take offense to this. He can tell from the shadows under the other man’s eyes that he’s knackered.
“And what will you do during that time?” Potter asks. She shrugs.
on a date last night. It would be an easy cover to sell - I just figured it made the most sense. After all, no one was going to believe you were dating me.”
“No.”
He watches with fascination as the machine in front of him spins the clothes around in circles. He had followed the instructions on the wall, putting the clothes in, then the powder, and then starting the machine with the Muggle money from the emergency stash he had found in the Cooler. Now, however, there’s nothing to do but wait for the machine to finish and by the looks of it, he has at least forty minutes before then.
“Parkinson, actually.”
“This would all have been so much easier if they hadn't been here,” Harry said. He felt bad admitting it, but it was true. Draco laughed.
“How diplomatic of you. How much do you want to bet something happens between them before the end of the year?” The Slytherin girl asked. “I’d wager ten galleons they at least make out before Christmas.” Hermione fought to keep her face impassive.
“Make that two,” the blond says. Parkinson nods once and then busies her hands. Harry leans casually on the counter.
“Fat suit. Then we’ll put your costume over that. We figured pillows wouldn’t stay up well enough, so Bertie made you a full on suit.”
Except, now he’s the asset, isn’t he? He is the proud owner of all of the Ministry’s secrets, whether he knows it or not. So she can’t kill him. In fact, she must do the opposite of that, at least until they figure out a way of getting all of the bloody secrets out of his head. She suddenly wants to curse whomever thought up with The Reliquary in the first place. It seems like such a stupid idea in hindsight.
“Do you remember the three items that Death gave the brothers?”
He dithers on the bed for a moment, trying to figure out what he should do, before he tells himself to buck up and face whatever horror this is. He pulls himself out from under the covers and creeps over to the door. He tries not to let his hand shake as he reaches for the door handle. The roaring is, if anything, louder now. It seems to be coming from directly outside. He takes a deep breath and wrenches the door open.
“Some of us aren’t even legal,” Draco added.
They spend the next half an hour swapping presents and generally enjoying everyone’s company. Unbeknownst to Draco, Harry had picked up something for Cormac last minute, so even he had a present (a generic scarf, but a nice one). Pansy
“It's gone, Parkinson” he says.
Draco laughed in triumph, but it was short lived as Harry quickly figured out that he too was ticklish, and where, and proceeded to tickle him until he was begging for mercy.
“Hermione asked to see us.” Harry stares at the pillow and is about to take it away when Draco pushes it off of his face and sits up. He never made it back into his pajamas last night and the spiderweb of scars on his chest is silvery in the morning sunlight.
“You know,” Harry says. “When I said I wanted you to do naughty things to me, I meant that I wanted you to sleep with me, not tie me down and interrogate me about the Simurgh Society.”
“Can you also help Ron and Pansy with the chairs?”
“And, quite frankly,” he starts to say, and then peters off. Draco watches as Harry nervously chews at a hangnail.
think there are no security wards that will go off if someone enters the building disguised with magic?” Pansy asks. “And before you ask, no, we can’t disguise you once you’re there because the wards also prevent that.”
“What was that?” he snapped as soon as the door closed behind him.
, but that doesn’t change the fact that he’s the most dangerous wizard of our time and incredibly powerful.”
“Please excuse my friend,” he said. “Draco, piss off.” Draco rolled his eyes at Blaise but wandered away nonetheless. “So no one knows anything about the diadem?” Blaise asked, returning his attention to Terry.
“As touching as this is,” Voldemort said, cutting into Harry’s thoughts. “I think it’s about time I ended you once and for all.”
how he pushed everyone away as opposed to letting them help him. She knows why he did it, of course. It is part of the reason she doesn’t think he is the right person to be the living incarnation of The Reliquary. At the end of the day, he had balked at killing Dumbledore, or so she had heard. If she is being fair, which isn’t often, she knows she would have done the same thing in his place. She, too, had been a coward at the age of seventeen. She knows she wouldn’t have helped him back then, even if he had asked her to. But Pansy knows a lot can change in ten years. Perhaps she is being too hard on Draco. Either way, she needs to stop stalling and call this in.
“You may.” Snape studied Harry’s face for a moment, and Harry saw an emotion flit across his professor’s features that he had never seen before. “Perhaps you do take after your mother after all.” Then Snape seemed to snap out of whatever reverie he had been in with a small shake of his head. He nodded curtly at both Draco and Harry and then was gone in a billow of robes.
“Twenty minutes ago? But you’ve been busy talking with Greg, so I’m not surprised you didn’t notice me.”
noise that they all just turned to stare at them. “Go,” he told Draco.
“Fair point.” Harry looked around the room, trying to spot the sandy haired boy. “Nope, haven’t seen him,” he said once he had ascertained that he was not within eyesight. “Have you tried looking outside?”
“Are you okay?” he asked.
“At least the talk show host makes sense. He’s got red hair.”
“I think you two are better friends than you think you are,” Draco says. “And anyway, I was trying to say that she’s
He walks tentatively over to Malfoy’s side of the bed and puts a hand on the blond’s shoulder. He does not stir, so Harry begins to gently shake it. He gets a slap in the face for his efforts.
“Were you there?” Pansy asks.
“Nothing,” he says. She crosses her arms in front of her chest.
“No,” he said immediately. “Last night was great.” Harry breathed a sigh of relief. “But we can’t have a relationship based on sex alone.”
“Now,” she said. “Whose pajamas are you wearing?” Shit. Of course she would ask after he had already shown himself to be emotionally fragile.
“What’s this?“ he asks, pointing at it.
“Years ago?” Draco looks helplessly over at Potter who is biting his lip to stop himself from laughing.
“Except when it comes to girls, when you have the emotional range of a teaspoon,” Harry said, remembering the argument the year before with Hermione.
“A book fort,” Luca says proudly. Jamie frowns at it and shakes his head.
“Yes,” she says.
“Have you?”
“It’s a long story,” Draco said quickly.
“Dumbledore said I died,” he said, biting his lower lip. He still couldn’t quite believe it. Even if Dumbledore had also said he hadn’t actually died.
“What happens if I don’t?” Draco hoped Harry was asking in a hypothetical sense because if Harry wasn’t going back, Draco wasn’t either. And he wasn’t really ready to be dead.
“Right,” she said. “Because when
Harry knows he should stop flirting. Harry knows he should give himself more time to get over Oliver before launching his emotions into anything new, particularly if that thing is also
“That’s fair. What class do you have now?” Draco asked, quickly changing the topic.
He looked up as the patio door swung open and music spilled into the night. His heart lifted for a moment, but it was just Hermione and Blaise Zabini. Now there was an odd pairing.
“Where is Hermione, anyway?” Seamus asked. He looked around the deserted Great Hall as if Hermione were just hiding under one of the tables.
He had half thought that spending time with Harry’s ex might be awkward, but Ginny is nothing but friendly. The part of his brain that thinks that he is still in Slytherin wonders if it is all an act, aimed at getting his guard down so that she can destroy him later. And he puts his guard up.
“Which,” Potter interjects. “Is where I come in.” Lucius turns to him and raises an eyebrow. Anyone observing this, could tell that this was where Draco had learned how to do it.
