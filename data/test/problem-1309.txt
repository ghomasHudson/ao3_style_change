Ron glanced up. The murderous rage in his eyes had, thankfully, died down a little, but he still didn't seem particularly happy to see Harry around. "No," he grunted through a mouthful of steak.
had caused. I am delighted to see so many familiar faces here, and I am honored to be in the presence of these noble, young heroes."
"Potter," Draco said, shoving his emotions into the pit of his stomach. "Shrieking Shack, midnight. Don't tell anyone, least of all Weasel or Granger."
"Well, you always intended to be rude, but I found it endearing. Not to mention I always felt like you were a good person, deep down. And I'm honored I get to see that person."
Harry slid into his normal seat, too distracted to care about the scowl Ron fixed him with. Hermione straightened herself awkwardly, taking a tentative bite of her sandwich.
Harry took a step forward, clutching his wand so tightly that red sparks shot down to the floor. "Maybe."
Harry flushed. "You don't have to answer," he said, looking down. Harry supposed that, inadvertently, it may have been his fault that Malfoy had been imprisoned.
Malfoy nodded, a solemn look crossing his face. "I understand," he said cooly. "Perhaps you should return to your dormitory, then, as I figure to do now."
"Forget it," Ron waved his hand, brushing the topic away. "So how about Malfoy, huh? The git's finally gotten out of Azkaban."
Harry skipped Charms that day, deciding instead to go to the Quidditch Pitch. He didn't have any broom to play with, so he sat in the stands, watching the clouds and thinking.
Harry gave her a tiny smile, and Hermione's eyes lit up. It seemed, from her letters over the summer and from their interactions at Hogwarts, that Hermione wanted to fix Harry, to fix everyone. That's who she thought of herself as, the fix-it witch, the Mind Healer, the person who had recovered and had it all figured out. As long as Harry could reassure her that she was doing a good job, he figured that she would be happy enough to work through her own problems.
Harry remained silent, not bothering to see if Ron's facial expressions indicated a strong desire to flip the table. Judging from Hermione's small sigh of exasperation, they did.
"Likewise, Luna," Harry said, standing up. His legs felt numb, and his brain was spinning. It felt as though had Cho had stripped down every layer of his flesh, examined them, and then put them back together. Almost like she had read his mind.
"We didn't have to save him," Ron muttered, kicking at some unseen thing on the ground. Harry and Hermione shared a tense glance. Ron had not grown fonder of Malfoy in the past few months, despite Harry and Hermione's constant insistence that he wasn't a bad man, that he deserved to be saved, and that despite everything he belonged at Hogwarts.
The Sorting Hat, which looked, surprisingly, a bit cleaner than in past years, perked up a bit at this, and Harry shut his ears closed. He didn't want to hear the names of his dead classmates. He almost wished that McGonagal had stuck with the familiar Sorting song, then, perhaps, he could pretend that the war never happened, and for just a moment it was a regular year at Hogwarts.
"Why?" Harry asked, and Draco sniffled. God, he had honestly sniffled. The blush rose to Draco's ears, but it was too late for even the strongest shame to save him now. Draco started crying-- not sobs, mind you, but soft little tears.
"Excellent," Malfoy suddenly broke out into a smile, and a strange feeling hit Harry. Just a little tug, somewhere in his chest, and he realized that he was
For a split second, Harry worried that the hat wouldn't speak. And then, it did, in that same deep, raspy, not-quite-there voice that had announced him a Gryffindor so long ago.
With a bit of effort, Harry pulled himself from the tight tunnel and landed on the floor, soaked with sweat and covered in dirt. Draco, looking clean and haughty as ever, sized him up warily.
Harry couldn't speak. His arms were shaky as they held him up, still half-reclined on his bed, stunned. "Ron--" he began again, but it came out squeaky, pillowed by the creeping feeling in his throat. "Ron, I'm--"
"Alright," she finally said, picking up her sandwich again. "How were classes?" She took a bite, presumably to occupy her mouth before she could anger either of them again.
Ron snorted. "Right. Every time we talk, it's always about you, and how Voldemort's affected you, and how bad life is for you." He threw his hands into the air sarcastically. "Poor,
"Maybe you can get off for tonight," Ron said, wiping the grease from his mouth with the sleeve of his jumper. "Tell him you've got an emergency."
Neither Harry nor Ron elected to reply, both of them glowering down at their plates. Hermione tapped her fingers anxiously on the table, and Harry couldn't help but feel bad for her.
"Honestly," Hermione agreed, casting a somewhat distasteful look at Ron as he took another gluttonous bite. "how does he expect you to pass your NEWTs? You'll never become an Auror if you don't study!"
"Harry," Cho cut him off sharply, raising a hand. She raised her head to stare at him, her eyes seeing right through his skin and into his insides. Harry suddenly felt extremely exposed. "I don't blame you."
"Oh, shut up, Ron," Hermione said, the grin still not leaving her face as she climbed off of Harry's lap, sitting across from him and next to Ron. "Anyway, Harry, I saw Draco leaving the compartment. He's not supposed to be--"
"Yeah," Harry gave a half-hearted grin to Luna as he scooted over to allow room for Ginny. "Yeah, Luna, I'm brilliant."
Harry fumbled for the wand in his pocket, pulling it out with shaky hands. "Back off, Ron," he warned, but the redhead didn't move.
Draco's stomach flipped. Of course. It was a stupid idea. "N-no," he stammered out, hating how weak he sounded. "Just. We can't talk here. Not now."
When the time on Harry's clock struck 11:30, Harry carefully stood up from bed. He hadn't considered that Ron would come back in, and had lie very still, hoping that if his dormmate returned he would charitably assume Harry had gotten back from an exhausting excursion with Dumbledore. Harry was surprised, pleasantly, that Ron hadn't returned quite yet, and his other mates hadn't given him a second thought.
Neville's round face was dark, and the lantern light made him look ghostly. "I buried my parents," he said, his voice empty, "In Godric's Hallow. They're by yours, Harry," he said, glancing up. Harry shifted uncomfortably at the haunted look in Neville's eyes, averting his gaze and looking towards the moon. Neville looked back down, withdrawing back into himself.
For a moment, Harry wondered what they could be doing. Was Hermione running after a book that had decided to fly away, or was she searching for the perfect text? Was Ron really standing there doing nothing, or was he holding a net in case something tried to escape? Harry's heart let out a little pang-- not for any fault of Draco's, but just watching his friends be happy without him. It wouldn't be the first, and certainly not the last, time.
. He had sat around the Burrow and moped for months, while Hermione was off interning at the Ministry and Luna was saving magical creatures and
"Do you think they sat here?" Harry asked, without really thinking. Malfoy looked up, startled. "The students who died?"
Harry ignored him, pushing the sleeve up a little more. In another second, the black ink of the Mark would peek out from Draco's sleeve.
"No, Luna--" Harry said, sitting up and turning around. Cho stood in front of him, wearing her plain Ravenclaw robes. A tiny badger pin was fastened to the knot of her tie. "It's been a while," Harry said, unsure of where to take a conversation with her.
At his first name, Harry paused, blinked, and pulled his arms away. He took a step back, and Draco shakily leaned against the wall for support, yanking his sleeve down.
Harry traced a finger over the mysterious stain, wondering again if it was Lavender who had spilled it. "What was it like?" He asked suddenly, drawing his hand away to rest awkwardly on his lap.
Harry ran, out of the Great Hall, down a staircase that had moved sometime over the summer, tripping over the rubble that they hadn't yet managed to fix. He swept his way into the dungeons, running and his eyes were blurry, unsure of where he was going, he ran and ran until he reached a dead end, and then he sunk into the corner and let the tears fall.
Harry was immediately stifled as a bushy-haired Hermione jumped into his lap, giving him a tight hug.
Harry felt like an eleven-year old, climbing these steps. Suddenly, he was a bloody thirteen year old, and then a fifteen year old tired after an Occlumency lesson, and then sixteen, carrying a bottle of Slughorn's memory.
Harry wiped his eyes, praying that Malfoy hadn't been standing there long. "I could ask you the same," he deflected. "Plotting something?"
"You're welcome," he said, sounding only halfway genuine. "Hope you find him," he added dully, before opening the door to Harry's compartment and slipping inside.
Harry realized that Hermione's eyes were filling with tears. "Of course it does, Ron!" She said, her voice breaking a little. "Will you two put your stupid wands down?"
"I spent the summer at Shell Cottage," Luna said, her sing-song voice tainted with a strained sort of edge. "Helping Bill and Fleur relocate displaced magical creatures."
, Harry thought, already knowing the answer. He could barely even count the number of times this exact problem had manifested itself in their relationship, nor the amount of time Harry himself had spent brooding over whether he truly
?' Draco asked. Would Harry perhaps be looking for him as well? Maybe he wanted to ask Draco today like Draco wanted to ask him? Maybe—
With their eyes and hands locked again, Harry doesn't know what to think anymore. Malfoy is so close, his warmth radiating through his palms. It makes him feel uncomfortable yet comfortable too; it's quite confusing, really. 'N-No,' he manages to get out. It sounds like a lie, and judging by Malfoy's sneer he knows it's one too.
As she stepped aside to let the Champions enter the Great Hall, Harry quickly turned himself towards Draco. 'That gives me an idea,' the boy said, before he snatched Draco's hat off his head and tossed it somewhere down the hallway. Draco's silver locks fell over his robes like water as he gave Harry a shocked expression.
The entire pile was soon moved from right to left, leaving only two items on the floor; the silver snake Ron had wanted to touch and a golden goblet. 'It must be the snake,' Ron concluded, pointing at the statue and wanting to touch it again. Another slap from Draco's hand later and he was pouting.
Madame Maxime and Karkarov looked vile, but didn't argue with his statement. Draco realized at that moment that it was set; Harry Potter would be the fourth Champion wether he liked it or not. And judging by the terrified look on the boy's face; he didn't like it
'How do you mean? Why would Harry see something else than me?' Ron seems to be even more confused now, looking from Hermione to Harry and back.
They had fallen, and stopped right in time thanks to Draco's and Hermione's combined spells. Hovering in the air, Draco took a deep sigh before they all hit the ground. Soaking wet they were, their hair sticking to their faces. Hermione was back to being herself; drowning in the robes again and kicking off the heels she couldn't walk in. She retrieved a pair of trainers from her small bag, quickly put them on and ushered everyone to continue walking.
Draco’s mind is slightly blown at this look; at this emotion he hasn’t seen that many times before. An emotion that’s worrying to him. And
Red and gold, seated surprisingly far away from Harry that day, made up for an un-celebrating crowd. Throwing annoyed glances at Harry, it almost seemed as if Draco had returned to the Champions Selection day. Those Gryffindors who
around to find nothing underneath it at all. Why had Madame chosen a rotten apple, anyway? She always picked the most scrubby things for him of all — as if she was testing wether he could stand picking up such an item.
It was here that Aaron suddenly didn't know what to say no more, and his lips quivered as he considered how to bring the news. "
But as the final task was nearing, the end of the school year therefore as well. Both boys had become nervous when the first of May had arrived; only two more months were left in each other's company. They had started to make plans, exchanged addresses with the promise of a letter every single week -- but Harry knew it wouldn't be the same as having Draco physically by his side. Not to mention that the Dursleys probably weren't going to be very keen on receiving an owl at their nephew's bedroom window every week; Hedwig was already an eyesore to them and a disgrace to their neighborhood. As they had laid under a tree together, enjoying the warm breezes of May, Draco had invited Harry to come over to his house in France during the summer. Getting his hands on an international Portkey was apparently something Draco could arrange easily; he was wealthy enough and had the right connections to obtain one. Harry had accepted the offer without hesitation and asked Draco detailed descriptions of what France was like almost daily. He knew Draco once mentioned that he lived in a cold and quite scary Manor, somewhere he hated to be — but Draco had assured him they weren't staying at the Manor during the summer holidays but would exchange the macabre structure for a cozy house in France. Knowing those facts, Harry had dreamt of spending his summer with Draco at the French countryside almost every single night.
The others seemed to believe it was pure luck as well, besides from Hermione of course, whom also threw Harry a suspicious look. They closed the locket subject, and Hermione hid it carefully away in a small purse.
"Vanity," the boy simply answered, and it was enough for Harry to understand. It were all things he should've known — things he should've remembered had he paid more attention in his religion classes at school.
‘Have you seen Harry?’ They had seated themselves on one of the benches after helping a few of the injured students with healing their wounds. They were both exhausted after producing so many difficult spells from their souls, and had allowed themselves to rest for a few minutes.
' before he tucks it away in a leather glove he's been wearing for a few months now, to hide the black away. He told his mother it's a kind of trend right now amongst Wizards, and that he's read it in a magazine -- although he hasn't read a magazine in
But it didn't matter how they called him; each name always sent shivers down Draco's spine. Father often told him not to fear the man; apparently Draco's Father was sure he would return in the future and that they had to be his ally in order to survive. When Draco had asked his parents why that was exactly, his Mother had just replied that his Father had made a mistake in the past; a mistake that had tied him to the evil ruler for life.
Aaron gave Draco a sympathetic look, one Draco'd seen many times before in his eyes. But Aaron wasn't one to talk; in his six-hundred years of being an Angel he'd only had a handful of Mortals, all simply passing away of old age instead of disease or their sudden interest in Satan. It had made him one of the best guardian angels Heaven had ever had, and it made him very popular amongst the ones who lived in the Beyond. A popularity Draco would never know.
Later that day Castor approached him as well, and Draco was prepared to hear him ramble on about his task again, yet all the boy had to say was one single word.
' Draco slid a hand through his short platinum hair. He still hadn't get used to it and probably never would, but it was better than to be compared to his father ever again.
Hermione's back straightened, brows furrowing. "I think you're being unreasonable, Ron," she said evenly, casting another glance in Harry's general direction. "Besides, you shouldn't talk about him behind his back. Other people might be listening."
Pansy gave him a strange look, but didn't bother commenting on Harry's examination of the broom. "Take a pair of dragon-hide gloves," she said, tossing him a spare pair, "that thing will stab you like a bastard."
"Yeah," Harry responded, shifting awkwardly as he tucked his cloak into the pocket of his robes. "So."
"Anyone for breakfast?" Hermione asked, her voice wavering. "Right," she muttered, rubbing a sleeve over her Prefect badge and fastening it to her robe solemnly. "Come on, then, Harry."
Hermione walked away, her shoes snapping pointedly against the stone as she strode. Right before she rounded the corner, she glanced quickly at Harry. It was hard to read her look, but Harry could tell that she wasn't very happy with him.
"Running out like that? Could you be any more selfish, Harry?" Ron turned to face him, and his face was warped. He didn't look like his friend, anymore, the man who had destroyed the locket and pulled him from the lake. He looked evil, twisted, full of fury.
"I am not mooching!" Harry yelled, even though he didn't exactly believe it himself. "I--" he stumbled, struggling to find his words. Ron didn't seem to want to wait for him.
The question was abrupt, and Draco stalled for a moment, staring into Harry's eyes with alarm, before ultimately deciding that it wasn't an unwelcome idea. "Okay," he said, "fair warning, I don't have much practice."
"Ignore him, Harry," Hermione said, rolling her eyes and exchanging a galleon with the Trolley Lady in exchange for a handful of assorted candies. Harry pitched in for two Pumpkin Pasties and a couple of bottles of Gillywater, after which the Trolley Lady smiled at him sweetly before turning to return to the front of the train.
"If it were up to me," Ron continued, slamming his hand onto the table, "he'd be in Azkaban forever, along with the rest of that sorry family."
The whispers followed Harry onto the train-- first years, stopping their chatter when they saw him. A fourth-year Hufflepuff who gave him a chocolate frog card--
Pansy stuffed the Dungbombs back into her pocket. She looked rather disappointed that they would not be getting used. "Blimey, Harry, how'd you know all of that?"
Harry's interactions with Pansy had grown easier-- she was surprisingly nice to be around, and nearly as intelligent as Hermione (if a little full of herself), and he had at least become acquaintances with Malfoy. While he certainly wouldn't consider him a friend, Malfoy was at least friendlier to him than Ron.
No Draco in this one boys, he's busy trying to not get sent to Azkaban while Harry gets absolutely bullied.
"We could ask it," Pansy suggested one evening after Harry shared his concerns. Her, Malfoy, and Harry were all on their way back to the castle after a three-seeker game-- Pansy had won by a landslide, even after Malfoy and Harry teamed up-- and twilight was just beginning to sparkle over the horizon.
ago. Did Dumbledore really love Harry, like he claimed to? Or did he always know what would become of him?
Harry remained quiet-- it's not that he wanted to creep on Malfoy, of course not, but if he took his cloak off now, he'd have a lot of explaining to do, both to Malfoy and to his friends. Sneaking out was also out of the question, considering the double layer of doors and the somewhat hypervigilant Malfoy gazing out the window across from him.
"Hello, Harry," Cho said, and Harry's face instinctually curled up, as though he had smelled something nasty.
"Any more room?" Harry turned to see Ginny, with Arnold on her shoulder. He gave her a tiny smile, which she didn't reciprocate. Harry's feelings towards Ginny were still something that confused him-- on one hand, spending months in the same house as her had certainly turned him off to some of her more annoying quirks, but he still felt an obligation to be attracted to her. He wouldn't describe it that way, of course, instead opting to say that he felt safe around Ginny. He felt safe in having a crush on Ginny.
By the time Harry had meandered his way back to the castle, it was dinnertime. He made his way to the Great Hall, caught one glimpse of Ron and Hermione in a heated argument at the end of the Gryffindor table, and promptly changed course to sit with Luna at the Ravenclaw table.
There, nestled between a globe and a stack of Transfiguration books, was the Sorting Hat, looking astonishingly crumpled and defeated. Harry was tall enough, now, to reach it without difficulty, and he placed it over his head without allowing himself a second to doubt.
Draco shook his head. "It's obvious, isn't it?" He laughed a little, sitting shakily down on the bed. Harry sat next to him, far enough away to give Draco space but close enough that if Draco leaned to the right his head would almost immediately rest on Harry's shoulder. "I don't want to work for him anymore. I'm tired. There's a Vanishing Cabinet," he explained, not able to stop himself as the story came tumbling out, "in the Room of Requirement. They want me to bring Death Eaters through. I have to make it work. But everything I put in it dies." Draco lets out a sob, but it's dry this time. "And it's a silly thing to be so upset about, but I put a bird in there. I knew what was going to happen. I killed her."
"It's alright," Harry said, not breaking eye contact with Malfoy. "I'm not sure I wanted to hear what it had to say, really."
"I'll brew you something to perk you up in the morning," Hermione offered, nodding towards Ron. "What do you think, Ron?"
"I doubt McGonagall will let us in," Harry pointed out, "and if we don't get back to our dorms Filch'll have a fit."
Malfoy confirmed this when his eyes widened and he quickly dropped his hand away, tucking it into his robe pockets. "Uh. Seeker's game Friday, then?"
For the first time in his Hogwarts life, Harry felt like he was alone. The Gryffindor common room didn't welcome him anymore. Whenever he left his bed, he got judgemental glances, whispers, and once or twice an overzealous fan who would harass him for his autograph (which didn't improve Harry's reputation with the rest of the Gryffindors). Even though Harry didn't consider himself particularly loyal, smart, or cunning, he certainly didn't feel brave.
"I don't know, Hermione," Harry said, even as he followed her towards it. "I don't think that Ron--"
There was almost a minute of silence, before Ron cleared his throat, shifting awkwardly, glancing down at the floor. "I should--" he made a vague gesture towards the hall that Hermione had walked to. "Yeah."
"Thank you, Harry," Pansy said, stepping between the boys and accepting the Invisibility Cloak, "now move your arse before I hex it."
Harry pretended that Malfoy didn't mean that as an insult. "I ran out of the Sorting," he confessed, "they started reading the names of the dead students. I couldn't handle it."
Hermione tapped her foot in annoyance but didn't offer any criticism. "It feels like we've been here for months already," she said, "and it's only been a day."
Harry turned. Ron, halfway out the Common Room, was staring at him with a half-guilty, half-puzzled look on his face.
McGonagall, he noted, hadn't changed much-- Fawkes, currently a pile of ashes, still had his seat next to the mahogany desk, raised on a platform, obscured by velvety blue curtains dotted with silver stars. Books, cauldrons, even a shallow bowl of Sherbert Lemons, which Harry couldn't help but sample. They were a little bit stale, it was clear nobody had replaced them for a long while, although it could have just been Harry's dry mouth playing tricks on him.
Harry watched, completely silent under his cloak, as Malfoy swept the interior door over the glass, giving himself some privacy. He lounged, thankfully, on the seat across from Harry, and didn't even jump when the train lurched forward.
"Don't worry about it, Pansy," Malfoy brushed his hand through the air. "I'm happy it's still getting used. Grand old broom."
"Yeah," Ron snorted, "maybe Harry's hiding somewhere around here, sniffing around like a little rat." He ran a hand through his sweaty hair, dropped it to his side, and sighed, defeated. "I just wish he could take the hint. He's been nothing but a burden on my family for the summer, and now he expects me to pander to his emotions?"
"Severus," Harry whispered to the phoenix statue. For a moment, his heart skipped, wondering if it would work. The phoenix's carved eyes looked through him, beyond him, as if unimpressed by who had dared enter the office. And then, silently, it rotated, revealing the familiar gold-tinted staircase up to the Headmaster's office. As soon as Harry crossed the threshold, the phoenix closed itself again.
alone!" Humiliated and infuriated Draco took André by his shirt, a tight grasp as he held white eyes locked with white. André's gaze was strong, his power of fire starting to burn him from within — but Draco knew he was stronger and pushed it away, using all the anger and humiliation he felt inside of him. Within a second André fainted and collapsed into a little heap on the floor.
'Not on purpose,' Draco replied eventually, changing his words. He then swallowed and casted his eyes somewhere else but Hermione's intense stare or Harry's unconscious body. 'He didn't mean to hit me; he wanted to curse someone else.'
'Just that his father's acting strange again — even more strange, that is,' Harry answered her. 'Why?'
Draco’s heart skipped another beat at his last words, but Draco knew it wasn't enough to make him fall to his knees and die right there — the Dark Lord's curse would only be fatal at complete exposure. Harry nodded his head at his lover's words. 'I will, then,' he replied. 'But be careful, my butterfly.'
'You will only start to miss him more, Harry.' With Dumbledore next to him, they walked through a nearly abandoned street in the middle of the night. The pale moonlight shone upon them and a few stars were flickering next to it; showing off how much they could sparkle. To why exactly Dumbledore had invited him to join him on a nightly trip to wherever-they-were; Harry had no idea — and by the looks of it, the Headmaster wasn't really feeling like explaining it to him. 'But you shouldn't worry about him,' Dumbledore added to it.
Another skip of his heart, but Harry had stopped rambling words. 'Draco,' he heard the boy say — almost whisper. But Draco shook his head, afraid Harry would start with his questions again the moment he would open his eyes and uncover his ears. 'Draco,' Harry repeated, and this time the boy's strong hands lowered Draco's. Hesitantly the French opened his eyes as well and looked straight into Harry's emeralds; surrounded by specks of bright red. His whole face was covered with it as if he had become a Weasley; covered in freckles. But it weren't freckles at all — it were spats of blood that had escaped from Draco's mouth as he had told Harry to stop. 'D-Draco,' Harry now stammered for a third time — this time with a great worry readable on his face as the boy stared at his own hands that were covered in red spots as well.
Draco nodded. 'Remember what I told you back in the bathroom? Why do you think Madame trusts me so much with the girls? She, and everyone at Beauxbatons actually, knows that I don't like girls that way,' he explained.
Before the boy could answer, a different voice interrupted their moment and made the boy break the gaze. It felt as if Harry got kicked in the stomach by reality — as if he'd fallen from a skyscraper in his dream and stirred awake at once. It took a few seconds for him to collect himself, but the voice rambled on next to him in the meantime,
"Wonderfully!" Hermione grinned, a fake smile plastered across her face, and Harry could tell that she was lying. Her eyes were dull and underlined with dark circles, and she was a bit more jittery than usual, hands shaking as she held her books.
"Thanks, Draco," Hermione said, and even from the far corner he was curled in, Harry noted Malfoy's surprise at hearing his first name.
Thank you so much for reading! Comments literally make my day so much brighter, thank you to everyone who leaves them and everyone who reads this story in general!
"The fact remains," Draco pressed, "that until you barged in on me in the bathroom I was fully intent on fixing that cabinet and killing Dumbledore. It's strange. If my wand wasn't so far away, I would've hexed you and we'd duel and I'd probably never change."
Each event of the day felt as though it was already so far away, and yet still happening, crashing into him like ocean waves. There were too many things Harry had to worry about-- Malfoy's evaluation, the nasty way everyone looked at him in Potions, his fight with Ron and Hermione-- and he couldn't bring himself to pick through even one of them.
Potter, with his vault of wealth and his dashing good looks! Poor Potter, who everybody loves! Poor, famous Potter, who could live with any old family, or buy his own damn apartment, but would rather mooch off of my parents!"
"I'll see if I can find that password," Pansy said, finally breaking the silence as they reached the staircase split. "I'll send you an owl."
"He wants me to kill Dumbledore," Draco said bluntly, voice coming out in little jumps, cut off by hiccups. "And if I don't, he'll kill me."
"He was forced to be," Harry introjected, and Ron looked at him with surprise. It wasn't often that Harry contradicted his best friend. "I mean," Harry said, "he didn't kill Dumbledore. He wasn't a bad man."
Draco laughed a little, just as Harry mashed their lips together. The kiss was warm-- surprising, Harry thought, for such a cold boy, and even though it was imperfect and had just a bit too much saliva to be enjoyable, Harry had to log it into his catalog of absolute favorite memories.
Harry looked surprised by this. "Really?" He asked, a tiny smile at the corner of his mouth. "Trying to lure me out to kill me?"
This chapter is almost 3,000 words. Hopefully that makes up for the several days of not updating. Fun trivia fact about this series that I just decided right now, Ginny's head is now half-shaved. Yeah, apparently poorly transfigured pygmy puffs get really aggressive once the charms start to wear off, and Arnold took a good chunk out of Ginny's scalp. She's forgiven him, the resulting buzz cut and scar look sick as hell.
"Ron, I don't want to argue with you anymore," Harry said. The two of them, much to Ron's exasperation, had separated from their friends and hidden in an empty dungeon corridor. Ron's brows were furrowed, and he looked as though he'd rather be cleaning a troll's toenails with his tongue than speak with Harry.
"No," Harry insisted, turning to lock eyes with Pansy. She didn't look as empty as Malfoy, but her face still held a few telltale signs of torturous time with the Dementors. Dark circles under her eyes, a pasty sheen to her skin, rippled fingernails, and a hunched, defensive posture. "You didn't deserve Azkaban."
Sorry for the cliffhanger in the last chapter, I planned to update yesterday but then I had a sudden thing come up and left y'all hanging.
"Not tonight. I have…" he trailed off, searching for an excuse, and his eyes landed on Dumbledore, who was having a hushed conversation with Professor Snape. "Another meeting with Dumbledore."
"He'll help them," Harry said with such finality that Draco almost laughed. The Boy Who Lived's devotion to the elder wizard was unyielding. "I'm sure he can. But they're not your responsibility."
"Still sore from the game last night, Potter?" Malfoy grinned. For the first time, he had won the Seeker's game, although in both Harry and Pansy's defense he had played incredibly dirty, nearly landing all three of them in the Hospital Wing with a well-placed
"I'm sorry," Harry said, shifting awkwardly. He felt Malfoy's gaze burning into his skull, but he didn't want to meet it.
Hermione clicked her tongue, rocking back and forth on her heels awkwardly. "Ah-- well, he said that he didn't particularly want to see you today. But!" Hermione put a hand on Harry's shoulder, "Double Potions will certainly bring you closer together. You can make fun of Sna--" Hermione dropped her hand. "Slughorn… you can make fun of Slughorn."
"You are the one who hired her…" Snape's voice faded away as Harry crept down the stairs, which shifted smoothly and silently as he reached the bottom. It was as though a rock had been ejected from his stomach-- and then shoved back down his throat as he realized he hadn't gotten a single answer.
"And then you come back, and you play the poor, innocent Potter game. Pretend that it's all your fault, ask everyone to come and comfort you. Poor Potter thinks all his friends died for him!" Ron was growing redder, the torchlight casting dramatic shadows over his face. He looked dead. "Waiting for someone to tell you that you're wrong, Potter? That they went down fighting for some cause?" Ron shook his head. "They died because you wouldn't come when Voldemort called. It could have all been prevented. Fred would still be alive." Ron's voice cracked, and his nose wrinkled.
Harry's heart sunk, but Ron didn't stop talking. "And you just want to act like nothing's wrong, like it's our fault that we don't want to talk to you. Hell, I'm surprised Hermione puts up with your whining ass. You may have saved the world, Potter," Ron practically spat, "but that doesn't make you a good person."
"I can't believe I ever thought you were brave," Ron muttered, kicking his trunk open to grab his pajamas. "You're a cowardly snake. Just like Malfoy, and Goyle, and Voldemort."
Draco nodded, even though he couldn't believe it. "I just feel so useless," he admitted. "I'm a traitor to Hogwarts--"
Hermione sighed. "Sure they are, Harry." She put another fake smile on and handed him a slip of parchment. "Anyway, I took the liberty of taking yours for you."
"Bloody hell, Harry," Ron said, skidding away, catching a slipping, tattered trunk with a scuffed shoe. The winning of the war didn't exactly boost the Weasley family's salaries, and despite Harry's constant pestering, they refused to accept even a cent of his fortune. At least, Molly and Arthur did. Ron and Ginny always pursed their lips whenever their parents refused, casting pointed glances down to their hand-me-down robes.
Harry stuck to the exterior walls, with their windows that let in just enough light to read his map. Draco was alone-- that gave Harry quite a bit of confidence. Out of curiosity, he looked for Ron and Hermione and saw that they were both in the library. Hermione was practically running up and down an aisle, and Ron was standing at the end, watching.
Luna put a hand on Harry's forearm. "The Headmistress is looking," she whispered, "you should go back to your table. Nice talking to you, Harry."
"This year at Hogwarts, I hope our veterans of war can find some semblance of comfort in the familiar halls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and that our younger students may find a source of inspiration with the bravery, loyalty, strength, and wisdom of these heroes." Professor McGonagall raised her arms to the Great Hall's ceiling, casting sorrowful eyes on the floating candles. "Today we mourn those who could not sit here with us, tomorrow we ensure their sacrifices are not in vain." She lowered her arms.
Pansy elected to ignore this, and rustled around in her pocket for a few minutes. "I have a few spare Dungbombs from Zonko's," she offered, "that'll get Filch's attention."
Hermione raised a distasteful brow. "He's hardly a git," she said defensively, lifting Crookshanks pointedly from his basket to set him safely on her lap. "Frankly, five years is a ridiculous sentence."
"What does that mean?" Harry asked, and Draco blinked. Leave it to Potter to be able to dismiss Draco's anxiety with his own bloody idiocy.
"He may as well have!" Ron slammed both fists down again and stood up. "Forget it, Harry! After everything we've done for you, you still--" he stopped himself, shaking his head. "Nevermind," he snapped, yanking the door open, nearly knocking the Trolley Lady over as he stormed away, slamming the door behind him. A couple of Ravenclaws leaned out of their carriage, whispering, casting concerned glances.
"Took you long enough, Harry!" Seamus grinned, extending a hand out to him. Harry climbed up and sat awkwardly between Luna and Hermione. Ron was across from him, a bitter glare furrowing his eyebrows.
"What about the Headmistress?" Malfoy asked. He maintained a cool, uninterested expression, but even in the dwindling light Harry could see the familiar mischievous glint in his eyes.
Harry drew open the Marauder's Map-- there, yes, Draco Malfoy, in the Shrieking Shack, pacing back and forth. Filch was in the dungeons, and Peeves was in the Herbology classroom, presumably stealing Mandrakes to replant in first-year's cauldrons.
A boy of seventeen lay wrestling with his blanket in the dark, squinting his eyes while fighting against a dream.
I also can't believe we're already at chapter 10! And at 70k+ words which kind of makes this a novel, so hooray!
'Taking you to Hogwarts, of course,' he answered, still with a bright smile. 'Come one — the others will be out of their minds!'
'So this is supposed to be Harry Potter?' she asked, her voice like sandpaper. She pushed his hair out of his deformed face. 'I don't see a scar, do you?' She looked over at Lucius whom didn't react to her words at all, glanced at a pale woman behind him instead. The woman had platinum blonde hair just like him, mixed with some strands of black, and wore intricate dark robes. Her beauty was hidden beneath a face of misery, her hands folded together in a nervous manner. 'Get Draco,' Bellatrix then shouted, demanded, and pushed Harry back onto the floor.
They discussed what the final task could be for a moment while studying the tall hedges; something was hiding behind them and Harry had a feeling in his stomach that he already knew
But Draco always kept himself to walking — or even remaining seated. Why chase a girl he didn’t have feelings for? Why chase a heart that didn’t beat at the same pace?
, Draco thought as he glanced over at the girl's table. He was friends with almost all the girls at Beauxbatons; they simple adored him. It was not only because he could do the most intricate hairstyles, but also because he beamed a certain elegance they all wished to be surrounded by. Draco had never minded their attention; he
Black stones, the green light of the Lake's water shining through the small windows; Snape's classroom was macabre as could be and certainly not inviting. As Harry entered the room, Snape immediately pushed Harry down on one of his chairs, rolled up his sleeves just a bit to clear his wrists and prepared his wand without Harry preparing his mind. Flashes of Draco smiling, his long hair blowing in his face when walking by the lake and the two of them dancing at the Yule Ball flashed in front of his eyes again — just like they had done the previous times. Somehow it always seemed as if the same memories were popping up and Snape seemed to notice as well as he drew back and gave Harry a glare of dissatisfaction. 'Try harder, Potter! I have no intention on seeing those memories for the fifth time again,' he muttered.
"Blimey, Harry," Ron chimed in, a greased chunk of chicken dangling from his mouth, "he's working you to death."
Harry looked down and bit his lip to stop himself from cursing. Sure enough, just the tip of his scuffed shoe was peeking out from under the cloak-- of course, Malfoy would notice it, Harry hadn't had a new pair of shoes since the end of the fifth year. He had considered asking the Weasleys for new ones, as he had far outgrown the raggedy shoes and they were starting to hurt his feet, but he didn't want to be even more of a burden on them than he already was.
As Harry continued to stand, flanked by Ron and an assortment of Weasleys, he felt his stomach sink. People were looking at him, whispering. "Potter!" someone called, "Harry Potter! Blimey! Harry!" The whispers picked up, and a curious crowd began to gather.
"He's been so distant lately," Harry muttered through a bite of Pumpkin Pasty. It was a bit dry in his mouth, and the Gillywater washed it down his throat in sticky chunks.
"Well I'm sure that whatever Dumbledore wants you for, it's incredibly important," Hermione butted in, a hint of jealously weaving around her words. "Don't worry about us, Harry. I've got loads more to teach Ron before he's caught up in Potions."
"Yeah," Draco said, leaning back against Harry's shoulder. "Potter--" he paused. "In the interest of transparency, I have to admit something to you."
"Nobody deserves those Dementors, Ron," Hermione said, scratching at Crookshank's tail. "Not even Draco."
"Draco…" Harry said softly, and Draco squeezed his eyes as tight as he could, willing himself not to cry.
Pansy nodded. "None of us did, really," she said, leaning back, lounging over the bleacher, laying her head back on the row above them. "We were all just accessories to our parents' little war."
"I don't blame you," Harry said, "it would have been the wiser choice. A lot of people could have lived."
Ron paused for a moment, lingering to say something to his parents, but Harry was having none of it as he ran forward, pushing his trolley directly into the wall. It was different, now, without Hedwig's excited screech as they dove into the bustling Hogwarts Station. Harry looked around-- there were noticeably fewer students, this year, but the faces he did see were familiar. Dean Thomas was talking with Seamus Finnigan, leaning against a pole, and Seamus tipped his head back, roaring with laughter Harry couldn't hear over the din. It wasn't until Ron crashed his trolley directly into Harry's back, that Harry realized he hadn't moved.
"Going to your final year at Hogwarts, 'arry?" A wizard with crusty black hair and a few too many teeth swept Harry's hand in for a shake. "Brilliant!"
"They gave it to me," Harry said, and he felt his face flush with shame. "Because I couldn't get into Hogsmeade."
Harry did, on the very broken bed in the corner. He smiled a little, remembering his third year. Things were so simple then, he thought, even though they weren't that long ago at all.
"You can borrow this!" Harry said it just a bit too fast, thrusting out his Invisibility Cloak so hard it nearly hit Malfoy in the chest. "I mean…" Harry flushed, sweating a little. "You both can… wear…"
"It's only been a few months, Hermione," Ron said, his nose twitching a little at the sight of Hermione practically sitting on Harry's lap. It wasn't like he and Hermione were official, by any means, and so Harry assumed it had less to do with Hermione's behavior and more to do with the fact that it was with him.
Harry threw his head back in annoyance. "Double Potions?" He complained, re-checking the parchment as if it would suddenly change, "with Slytherin?"
"It's like I said, Harry is an insufferable twat." Ron kicked the wall, just a little too close to where Harry was hidden. He lept away, nearly catching himself on a nearby torch. "I tried to listen to him, I really did. I don't know why we're even friends with him."
"No," Harry said, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stepping forward. Ron jumped, surprised, and Hermione bit her lip, turning on her heel like she planned to run away. "Go on, Ron."
"Yes!" Pansy chirped, grabbing Malfoy's arm. "Yes, Seeker's game Friday, I'll beat you and all of that, we
"Bloody hell, Hermione, no need to be rude." Ron took a disdainful swig of Butterbeer before turning back to Harry. "Seriously, Harry, I can stage a diversion. Fred and George gave me these great--"
Harry thought, although he knew by the end of the day he and Ron would be on good terms again. That's how these things always seemed to go-- simmering tension, a blow-up, one of them feels bad and comes crawling back. Although this time, the blow-up was greater, and Harry couldn't help but feel like maybe he wasn't out of the woods yet. That maybe his friendship with Ron was so damaged that nothing, not even Hermione's well-meaning but overbearing attempts, could get them to stick together.
Ron's shoulders tensed up, and Hermione let out a little click of exasperation-- at Luna, maybe, but more likely at herself. "How about you, Neville?" She asked, whipping her head so fast that her bushy hair hit Harry squarely in the face, nearly knocking off his glasses.
Pansy glanced at Malfoy, concern lining her features. "I mean, if that's what you'd like. I can take some leftovers for you?"
"You were quite the prick," Harry laughed, kissing Draco on the nose and making the pale boy flush almost crimson. "But I always thought you were kind of cute. Rather funny, too, in your own strange way."
"Malfoy," Ron's voice said from outside his compartment. Harry snapped his attention to the closed glass door, where Ron was talking to a very familiar silver-haired boy.
"Come on, Hermione," Harry pleaded, casting a wary glance down the hall behind him. "I don't want to have to see him."
-- a few wary side-eyes from Slytherin eighth-years who apparently hadn't escaped McGonagall's 'request' to return to Hogwarts.
"Nevermind that," Draco grinned. "And since you'll probably ask--" he leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to Harry's closed lips-- "I've always thought you were pretty. Before I even knew what liking boys was."
The owl came on Thursday afternoon. It was a small one, who seemed well-fed but scrawny. Harry took the time to pet her, for a little bit. She wasn't a snowy owl, but she certainly chirped a lot like Hedwig. Harry detached the roll from her leg before giving her a generous helping of owl treats (he took them from Ron's bedside table, to which Ron simply grunted) and sending her on her way.
. For a moment, Harry allowed himself to fantasize about what would happen if he got the Stone back. ⅔ a Master of Death, and if he dug the shattered Elder Wand from the bottom of the lake, tried repairing it, maybe he could become immortal once again.
". Ron had caught his sleeve as Harry was leaving Muggle Studies-- the new teacher, Gilderoy Lockheart's niece Goldie, seemed to have inherited her Uncle's knack for annoying everyone, and so Harry was certainly not in a good mood. Nevertheless, he had to admit his heart leapt a little as he watched Ron, waiting for him to say something, anything. But Ron had just furrowed his brows like he didn't really mean to talk to Harry after all, and turned away without a word.
"I don't either," Harry admitted, leaning in, "although I'm willing to get in as much practice with you as you would like."
"Well, you're no Ravenclaw, Harry," Pansy quipped, a dry laugh echoing hollowly throughout the pitch. "But what I did was selfish."
"That new professor is a blithering idiot," she complained, slamming the books shut. Harry crept out from behind the curtain, and yes, Snape's portrait's eyes were definitely on him, now. Snape pursed his lips and gave him a curt nod before continuing, drawing McGonnagal's attention away from Harry and back to Snape's portrait.
"Cho is looking at you," Luna said, quietly slurping a spoonful of pumpkin soup. "You should say hi."
"We arrive here today," McGonagall continued, "a year after a great tragedy. Last year's class has been cordially invited back to finish their studies, after the disruption the…" she paused, here, lip curling a little, and Harry noted the deeper wrinkles that had etched their way into her face, "
"Good morning, Harry!" she said, practically knocking him over as he walked down the stairs to the Common Room. "Sleep well?"
And it was probably healthy, too, at least that's what Harry thought. Maybe sticking around with Ron and Hermione was confirming the other students' preconceived notions about Harry's so-called elitism. Spending more time with Pansy definitely warmed Slytherin house up to him considerably, although many of his fellow Gryffindors had grown tense around him. Harry didn't mind it, not really. Some days, he wondered what would have happened if he had been sorted into Slytherin, like the Sorting Hat recommended.
Malfoy's eyes darkened at the idea. "No," he said, with perhaps more finality than was necessary. "I just didn't want to go to the Sorting."
This was his home. It had always been his home, and regardless of what the Sorting Hat said to him, it wouldn't change his Hogwarts House. And that realization almost made Harry feel-- sad. It wasn't that he didn't love Gryffindor, it was just that this familiar dorm room was strangely quiet, cold, sad. Dean and Seamus were often snogging in a broom closet somewhere, Neville was too busy staring vacantly out windows to talk much, and Ron's energy was either hostile or indifferent.
** -- You need blood/hair to seal Amortentia to someone, and I didn't mention this because I decided that a love potion will be 'activated' when you add that blood/hair. Will it make an appearance in the story later? Mayhaps!
"Harry," Draco muttered, pulling away, "why do you have feelings for me? I've been nothing but a dick to you for years."
Hermione laughed. "For you. I have History of Magic with Ravenclaw. Although--" she shuddered a bit, "I don't particularly fancy the idea of being with a ghost for a while. Don't want to be reminded of death." She blinked and put on a happy face again. "But at least you'll have Ron!" Her voice cracked on the end of that sentence, and Harry became astutely aware of what was happening.
The Great Hall had a noticeably lighter atmosphere compared to the Gryffindor Common Room-- seeing as the younger students probably woke up earlier, brimming with excitement and magic. Harry hated to admit it, but he did envy them, if just a little. He missed back then, when every little spell was so new and such a miracle.
Harry shrugged. "Sure." He took a bite of roast beef and immediately felt sick. "Probably going to bed soon."
Harry stepped further down the corridor, keeping his wand raised, until he was about ten feet away from Ron, positioned for battle. Ron shifted his position the same way. They both waited, the tension thick in the air, waiting for someone to make the first move. Just as Harry had decided it was up to him to do something, Hermione stepped in between them, her face bright pink. "That is
, he thought, taking a quick glance around the familiar Gryffindor dormitory. The window glass, slightly yellowed and rippled with time, was patterned with raindrops. The five, dented-up four-poster beds, each plastered with moving posters, all facing towards the worn red and yellow lion rug in the center. The dated red velvet couches near the windows, crammed into the small space and trussed up with mildewy yellow throw pillows, the chandelier ceiling perpetually lit by a strange fire that Harry had never been able to put out. It cast long, nostalgic shadows over the other beds, which were all vacant (except for Neville, who was, as usual, sitting very still, peeking out the red curtains to stare at the rain).
Ron blinked up, mouth wrapped around another chicken leg. "Uh-- yeah," he said, and Hermione rolled her eyes.
I'm sorry I was gone, but look I made you some Content! Daddy made you your favorite, open wide. Here comes the content!
"McGonnagal snuck past us," Pansy said, "I was going to send you a signal, but it was too late." She looked shockingly apologetic about the whole thing.
, Harry thought, surprised at the jealous lump that fell into his throat. He wanted to live in the illusion that Malfoy had chosen to confide in him, and only him. Although Ron would probably say that was because Harry had a self-centered savior complex.
Pansy laughed as she came out from behind the curtain, a towel wrapped around her. "Well, I'm going to take a shower, then," she said, subtly nodding towards the tent door. "You should too."
Ron balled up his fist and slammed it onto the table, making Crookshanks jump up and yet out a yelp. "My brother is dead!" Ron roared, face pinkening, "because of him and the rest of that crew! Don't tell me what Malfoy deserves, Hermione!"
Draco took a step forward, his shoes squeaking a bit on the bathroom floor. Harry turned to look at him, hopefully. Draco opened his mouth-- say something-- "I-" he paused, looking up at the ceiling where Myrtle had flown away. This was his chance. The Boy Who Lived was right there. One incantation, one flick of Draco's wand.
"Right," Harry nodded awkwardly. "I'll see you around, then." He turned to leave, face burning, when a heavy hand slapped down onto his shoulder.
"G'night, Harry," Ron muttered through a mouthful of stale licorice wand. Hermione cast a sharp glance at him, sighed, and gave Harry a small smile. He returned a strained grin back, and swept away to his dorm.
Harry nodded, pulling his Invisibility Cloak from his pocket and tossing it over him. The fabric had barely settled before Ron stomped around the corner, smoke nearly coming out of his ears.
Harry gave a tiny wave and left the room, slipping into the Gryffindor changing room just across from Pansy's. The shower water was cold, and the entire tent felt dead. When Harry squinted just right, he could still see Oliver's scribbles underneath the layers and layers of poorly erased chalk. Try as he might, he couldn't find his name on there. Like he didn't exist anywhere that had once mattered so much to him.
This chapter has a bit more snarky/self-referential wit in it? I don't know, the last chapter was pretty sad and I decided that it may be cool to lighten things up a bit.
Harry Wingardium Leviosa'd a branch to poke at the knot at the Whomping Willow's base, muttered "Mischief Managed" to the map, and ducked inside the tunnels. It was a much tighter squeeze than it was in his third year, and for a moment he considered turning back as the tunnel narrowed. Just as he thought that maybe he was too stocky to fit through, he saw a flash of silvery hair in the moonlight.
Malfoy looked just a bit shocked. "You used my broom, Potter?" He asked, an accusatory look on his face. Pansy threw up her hands, still giggling. One of her hair clips was falling out, and without thinking, Harry reached over and straightened it.
Draco wrenched his eyes open and considered the second option. Tell Harry-- The Boy Who Lived, the Dark Lord's nemesis, the boy who made him feel inadequate for years, of his plight. Go to Dumbledore-- Harry would definitely drag him by the ear to his office to confess-- or to Snape, beg for them to protect him and his family. Let loose his secrets-- God, the possibility was delicious, he would finally be able to rest.
After a few beats of silence, it was clear Cho was lost in her thoughts. "Well," Harry said, clearing his throat awkwardly, "I'd better get going. I'm not supposed to be--"
"You came," Draco said. He couldn't honestly believe it. It had been a long shot, to invite Potter here, but that stupid Gryffindor didn't seem to be too worried that Draco would betray him. It would insult the blond, really, if it wasn't so endearing.
I wrote this at midnight in an absolute frenzy. Anyway, Harry doubts his identity and goes to the Sorting Hat for help.
"Potter," a familiar voice drawled. Harry, startled, glanced up, to see the imposing figure of Draco Malfoy. He stood awkwardly, wand rolling in one hand, the other's long fingernails picking at the side of his robes. "Why are you in the dungeons?"
The other portraits shifted a little, but remained blissfully asleep. Severus raised an eyebrow at McGonagall, who was now tearing through Transfiguration books.
"Yes," Draco muttered, but it was swallowed as Harry bit lightly on his bottom lip before trailing his kisses downward, peppering them over his jawline. Before Harry could turn his attention to his neck, Draco gave him a small push back.
Harry lowered his, Ron did not. Hermione whirled around and fixed him with a glare so scorching that Harry could have sworn a few sparks burst from her eyes. "Ronald Weasley," she said, her voice low and dangerous, "Put your wand down."
He grabbed the end of his sleeve and pulled it up to his elbow. There it was, the Dark Mark, black, twisted ink. It had been months since Draco got it, but he could still feel the occasional sting-- the initial pain was nothing he had ever felt before, not even when he was Crucio'd by his Aunt Bellatrix as a child, and it haunted him.
"For telling people to grab you. Give you to Voldemort. Don't worry," she smiled softly, casting a wary glance to Harry. "I got my due payment for it. A year in Azkaban. Luckily," she stretched her back out, yawning a little. "McGonagall summoned everyone back."
"Be quick, Harry," Malfoy muttered, "I'm not getting in trouble just so you can wear that stupid hat."
"That's nice to hear." Malfoy folded out the table between them and crossed his arms over it, drumming his fingers on the cool metal, tearing his gaze away from Harry to trace his finger over the graffiti.
"Draco used to ride this junk," Pansy said, handing Harry a splintered Comet 360. "He refuses to get rid of it. Sentimental value." She pulled her own Firebolt from the broom cupboard, toppling over a few broken broom pieces.
The hit was hard enough to make Draco grab ahold of his middle with both arms, throwing Harry a glare. '
Immediately Harry is curious to know if his gloved hand is also struck by the curse, or his shoulder. Maybe it has even reached his chest already? His heart jumps at the idea and he feels all the color in his face drain away.
Ravenclaws liked to talk a lot, Draco noticed. Only seated for a few seconds he already got loaded with questions;
He'll get better in a few days,' Hermione assured Draco. 'Ron, will you get some cold water from the river? Thanks.'
tell you, Harry!' Draco now basically shouted in his face. Harry's anger returned at Draco's shouting and sputtering; at him trying to get away and denying every little word he said.
Draco waved his words away and tucked his timepiece in one of his pockets. 'Not to worry; tomorrow we will try again.' He bent through his knees and grabbed Harry's jumper and cloak from the floor. As he handed it to the boy, he took a good look into his green eyes and tried to project reassurance;
'My cousin’s quite mad, you see,' he explained to his friends. 'Keeps shouting in his sleep not to kill a fellow named Cedric.
, it was. He's even thinking about him right now while he's supposed to be thinking about himself; about his health. But all his mind wants think about is Malfoy, Malfoy-
Also, I'm planning on re-reading all chapters of Papillon and correcting some mistakes that I made! :)
'I just have never loved anyone before the way I love you and... and I guess I just don't know how things work when you have a boyfriend,' Harry mumbled, maybe more to himself than to Draco.
'Of course,' Harry replied, handing the shining piece of jewelry to Draco with a weak smile. 'We must go find Hermione immediately, she had the sword.' Draco nodded to his words, his eyes not even looking at the beautiful item in his hands. His gaze was casted through the arched window; staring at the heavy defense spells that were being casted around the castle — towards the skies and making every pastel color imaginable appear between the stars. It felt like they were trapped inside a large bubble, and it reminded Harry of a childhood he never had. Of a toy other kids played with and he never got to.
Harry sighed deeply, which was already enough for Draco to know how it went. 'You won't believe how many questions he kept asking me about this party; wether I liked the food, wether
To Harry he gifted something he had put quite the thought in — something he had bought for himself as well. It was the smallest gift of all, but the most special. He gave it to Harry with nervous eyes and watched him struggle with unwrapping it; the tiny pieces of spello-tape not wanting to come off. After seconds of getting curiously looked at, the boy finally managed to see what it was his boyfriend had gifted him. A golden medallion the size of a thumb laid in the palm of his hand, reflecting the greens of his eyes. 'A medallion?' Harry asked and Draco nodded, gestured for him to open it. The tiniest moving photographs of a lion and a butterfly decorated it's insides; one roaring at the boy and the other fluttering its wings in anticipation. Green eyes filled with happiness stared at the animals; Harry once again amazed by magic.
'Do you think we're safe here?' Ron asked. He had crawled up to his feet as well and was now standing next to Draco, taking in the elaborate sunroom where they had landed.
Harry bit his lip as he remembered Draco's last letter; telling him about his father demanding him to come home. 'I'm not so sure about that, actually. His last letter had me feeling quite worried about his situation, and he hasn't sent me another one since. Besides; we don't have any time to lose — he might be hurt!'
to be a Champion, did he?' Draco had never felt angry at Fleur before but could now feel the emotion slowly boil up inside of him.
Draco once again tightened his grip around his dressing gown, and as he held his chin up high, answered the boy. 'My name is Draco Malfoy. I am the heir of the prestige Malfoy-line and the chaperon of the beautiful girls of Beauxbatons.'
'One more thing, Dolores,' Dumbledore then said. The small woman turned herself around again, her bow swinging from left to right by the quick turn. 'You're fired.'
. It had been strange to see his own face, his own pair of eyes, his mess of a hair everywhere they secretly went.
'Harry, we—,’ Hermione began but Harry waved her words away before pushing Draco into another room and following him, closing the door behind them.
A large lake approached Draco's view, followed by a beautiful castle on top of huge rock formations. His eyes looked at it as if mesmerized; it seemed like something from a fairytale. Scotland was more beautiful than he had thought. At least, Hogwarts was. He could see many tiny windows and the smallest architectural details that another set of eyes would simply ignore. Gargoyles in every magical creature's shape; it was all quite the sight.
Wide awake in seconds Draco started to get dressed, washing his face in the small sink he was provided with and making the small bed he slept in. Orange light shined in through the window, giving his blue robes a golden gleam. With a comb the same gold as reflected he brushed slowly through his long hair, eyes fixed on his reflexion in the mirror. He always found it interesting how his face could look so different when his hair was hung loose, the tips brushing all the way to his elbows. It almost made him look like he was one of the girls.
'Just because you resembled him on the outside doesn't mean you're the same as him on the inside, Draco. I should've known that from the start.'
Squinting his eyes now slightly, Harry gave him a funny look. "You seem to know a lot about me, don't you?"
The robes he wore felt heavy, dirty, not his or anything he would ever wear. He knew they were his though, but had thought to have disposed them already ages ago. 'Who on earth decided to dress me this way?' he complained while taking them off, throwing them somewhere in a heap onto the floor. A grin. Harry had a smile on his face as he took off his own clothes, for once neatly folded them onto a chair. Draco's hand reached for his hair. It felt greasy and fried at the same time, as if it hadn't been washed in months. He pulled a face, then unbuttoned the shirt he had been wearing underneath the robes. A gasp. Having to hold on to the bed's frame to keep himself from collapsing.
'We are not dating, Ron. Viktor is just a good friend of mine; one with a brain, at least.' With those words said she stormed away, chin held up high like Draco knew he would do in a similar situation as well. He admired her for handling arguments so perfectly, with the right words said before elegantly storming off. She was a fierce girl that would've definitely been an amazing Beauxbatons student.
'I was thinking about you,' he says. A breath leaves his mouth, one he didn't know he was holding in.
‘Well, someone mentioned him a lot in his letters and I figured you could use something, or someone in this case, to warm your heart for the upcoming cold days,' Sirius explained. He winked, and Harry wasn't sure wether it was meant for him or Draco. Perhaps for both.
told him it was a lie. Yet he didn't quite know why. Draco returned the smile, though hesitant and slightly wary.
Grabbing one of his outer robes, hanging by the staircase, he waits for his mother to respond. Just as he pulls the robe over his arm, he can hear her soft voice answer him from above. “What is it, love?” She stands at the top of the staircase, left hand resting on the balustrade. Worry is readable on her face as well as exhaustion.
A silence fell over the room; hung in the air like a magic spell — entrancing everyone to stare at Draco with wide eyes. The ones that had cried now cried more; this time in sadness again. Others complained, started to question the decision of their God. "God has made this decision. And our God knows best," Aaron declared, trying to calm everyone down. Eventually they shut their mouths and the room grew eerily quiet once more, before they answered in unison.
A soft kiss got pressed against his forehead followed by deep sigh, as if Harry wasn't just tired from the day but tired by life in general. Perhaps he also was, now that he had so many things to worry about. Add Umbridge to that and his life was the perfect melange of negativity. Draco felt sorry for him; wished he could do something to make his life a little more easy — to take his responsibilities as the Boy-Who-Lived away if only for a few hours. The only thing he could do, though, was surround him with his love and make him feel loved — make him feel like he wasn't alone. Draco pulled him a bit closer to radiate that feeling and heard a content sigh escape from the boy's mouth in return. 'You know, Umbridge has made this rule that forbids one to be within six inches of each other,' Harry told him, his face so close that his breath could be felt upon Draco's pearl cheeks.
Potter's Latin sounds like a lot of mumbling but Draco catches something that could be translated to '
The moment flashed by, leaving in white particles as if snow was falling between memories and Harry caught glimpses of several times where his father and friends bullied young Snape; smirks on their faces as if they didn't seem to care about his feelings at all. It hurt Harry to see his father that way; it was a side he had never thought his father had possessed in his youth.
'It doesn't matter, Harry.' Letting out a sigh, Draco sat himself down on his bed and looked out of the tiny window beside it. A beautiful view was shown through the glass; overlooking the fields around the castle and Quidditch pitch. Green, blue and brown. Trees rustling their leafs in the wind. A cry of a wolf or perhaps a tormented person.
‘You’re wrong!’ Was all Draco managed to get out. They were on the wrong side. They had and always would be.
With his hands sweating and his eyes locked in those of Harry's, Draco'd waited for the Wizengamot's verdict. There would be no sentence to Azkaban, they'd concluded, but instead Draco would be magically bound to the Malfoy Manor property for four years. To his mother, the same destiny was called.
And so we only stayed in France during summer holidays and went back to the cold Manor in England for
One step inside the carriage and he was immediately reminded of a train; a passageway with many doors to small compartments on each side. One of the girls of which he knew was in his year — named Marie — appeared behind him and guided him to one of the doors numbered eleven. The compartment was around the size of a train's compartment as well; holding just enough space for a small bed, sink with a mirror above and the tiniest desk he had ever seen.

"The truth is, I wouldn't have told you about this if I hadn't-- if I didn't--" he closed his eyes, leaning up, bracing himself. "I have feelings for you, Potter. Love feelings.
