Harry started rapidly bobbing his head up and down and sucking hard, loving the velvet feel of Draco’s prick against his tongue.  He crooked his fingers and found Draco’s prostate.  Draco thrust his hips up wildly and Harry pulled back enough not to choke.  When he massaged Draco’s prostate again, Harry was ready for it and held Draco’s hips down.  Draco gasped and cried out, shooting his release down Harry’s throat.  As he was still swallowing, Harry pulled away and rose up on his knees and wrapped his lubed hand around his own cock.  With just three hard tugs he was coming all over Draco’s cock and stomach.
Draco closed his eyes against Potter’s fury. He had known it was a foolhardy plan, but he had had no other choice. His knees felt weak and only Potter’s tight hold on him kept him upright.
“No, you should,” Draco said quietly.  He returned to the chair by the bed and sat down.
Draco noticeably blanched, before setting his facial features back into an expressionless mask.  “Bulstrode?  Related to Millie?” he asked.
Harry stood on the edge of the blanket with his eyes dancing and a wide smile.  He had thrown off his jacket, shoes, and socks, and had rolled up his shirt sleeves.  He looked relaxed and happy.  He approached Draco and held out his arms for Al.  When he was snuggling his baby, he gestured toward Draco, “You should get comfy too.”  Draco smiled back at him and shucked off his robe, socks, and shoes.  He followed Harry’s example and rolled up the sleeves of his white dress shirt.  He paused a minute on his left arm, but resolutely continued and revealed the mark, knowing Harry loved him anyway.
“That wasn’t me,” Draco hissed furiously, “Mother got her calmed and sleeping and then just thrust her at me, and then she went off to her appointment.  I have been sitting here since she left.  I’m afraid to move a muscle, lest she awakens and starts that racket again.”
Dilly jumped in before Draco had a chance. “Mistress Malfoy is being very ill and Master Draco is needing Harry Potter.”
Harry felt the rising need of want and pleasure spiral up.  And then he was coming, wet and warm all over Draco’s hand and his own chest.  Harry used his clean hand to pull Draco close and kiss him softly.  “That was amazing,” he said quietly.
Wank in the morning with bed curtains spelled and Silencing Charms in place, then sometimes another wank in the shower (slippery just felt so good), and always a bedtime wank just before falling asleep.
He had just lowered his wand and turned to walk out when a powerful white light pierced the room, blinding Draco. A fierce wind roared through the chamber and whipped at Draco’s robes causing him to raise his arms protectively.
“I’m also not a Curse-Breaker,” Potter objected again.
“Well . . . you were the youngest seeker at Hogwarts,” Draco said, bitterness creeping into his voice.
The next thing Draco knew, he was back in the Department of Mysteries, on his knees in front of the Veil. He looked around frantically but only Granger and Weasley were there. “Noooooo!” he cried out.
“She seems to really like that,” Draco said as he came and sat on the edge of the couch, near to Harry but not touching.
“Come on, mate,” Ron pulled him over to lean by the window, where they were out of the way.
They lay quietly together for a few minutes before Harry had a sudden inspiration, pulled away and sat up quickly.  “Draco!  Dress nicely and meet me in the back garden in thirty minutes!”  Harry hopped out of bed and started moving toward the attached bath.
“Doing what?” Harry asked.
“What he’s trying to say is that we might have to have sex,” Malfoy interrupted.  Both boys’ faces turned bright red.
Dilly did not flinch from Draco’s anger, but said calmly, “Master Draco is needing Harry Potter.”
Don’t look at Draco, don’t look at Draco!  Harry tightened his jaw and pressed his hands into his thighs.  “Er . . . ah, well . . . I don’t, or I mean . . .” Harry took a deep breath.  There was no way out of this.  “Yes,” he gave in and told the truth.  Harry cleared his throat. “Uh . . . Neville, truth or dare?”
He had five minutes to spare, so he used his wand to create an enchanted archway out of the heirloom rose bushes.  Some of the petals scattered as he did this, carpeting the lawn underneath the arch.
“Harry we can’t have you touching him while we run diagnostics,” a healer called Uilliam requested.  “You can stay, you just have to move away.”
Harry pulled off his own shirt and then covered Draco’s body with his own.  “I’ll show you some perks,” he rumbled into his mouth before kissing him thoroughly.  Draco’s only response was to tighten his arms around him and press his hips up, as he kissed back desperately.  Harry leaned back a bit and trailed his fingers between Draco’s legs.  He skimmed along the length of his cock then gently cupped his balls.   He dipped his fingers lower as he murmured a cleaning and lubricating spell.  He moved his hand lower and then just rested his fingertips against Draco’s furled hole.  He tapped his fingers lightly, causing Draco to moan and buck his hips against Harry’s fingers.
Even with the cold hard Malfoy mask back in place, he still fascinated Harry.  And Harry fantasized about what it would be like to melt Malfoy’s cold reserve.  What if he could get Malfoy to kiss him again?  This time Harry would respond wholeheartedly.  His dick twitched at the thought and reminded Harry of his predicament.
He gave Draco a tender kiss as he pulled out of him, collapsing on the bed next to him.  As they both lay there breathing heavily and a little stunned, Draco’s hand found his and he threaded their fingers together.  As they lay there silently, waiting to regain control of their muscles, Harry squeezed his hand and Draco gave him a squeeze in return.
“Yes!” Draco hissed, digging his nails into Harry’s arms where he held on tightly.  “Again!  Don’t stop,” he ordered, tossing his head back and arching his neck.
“Mother had an appointment that she had to rush off to,” Draco answered sourly.  “Come and take this baby, Potter!  I haven’t the faintest idea of what I am doing.”
“There’s no way Potter can do that! Just look at him!” Draco waved his hand dismissively in Potter’s direction. “It was just dumb luck that he defeated him in the first place.” He was sure Dilly had good intentions, but she was wide off the mark here.
Draco threw his arm across his eyes in a pitiful attempt to hide.  “Nothing changed, Harry,” he huffed.  “I always wanted to stay.”
They had gone three weeks like this, but Harry didn’t know how to change things.  Hermione kept advising him to just be patient, while Ron thought he should just grab Draco and snog the stuffing out of him.  This advice gave Harry an unwanted look into his best friends’ marriage.
“Fine,” Pansy pouted.  “Harry.” She turned the attention back on him.  “Truth or dare?”
Needing desperately to fuck his husband, in one swift move, Harry flipped them both over.  Now able to use the leverage of his body weight, Harry pushed Draco’s legs up to rest on his shoulders and thrust roughly into him, setting a rapid pace.  Draco responded by wrapping his arms tightly around Harry.  “Yes, yes, oh fuck, yes!” Draco called out as he came.  As the muscles in his ass clenched repeatedly around Harry’s prick, it triggered Harry’s own orgasm.  They rocked and shuddered together for a few moments before Harry gently pulled his cock free and lowered Draco’s legs.  He waved his hand cleaning their sticky bodies, and pulled the blankets back over them as Draco settled against his side once more.
It had almost been anticlimactic when they had finally reached Voldemort. Like a cliché he was standing near a cauldron with three cloaked and hooded figures nearby. He smiled when he saw them, his hideous nose-less face curving in a macabre grin.
Dumbledore turned toward Harry. “And is that when you grabbed his wand, Mr. Potter?”
“Yes!  Yes!” Hilly smile got wider, “Sirs can stay here and talk a long time.  Hilly is looking after the Little Miss.”  She carried the baby out of the room, talking to her quietly the whole time.
“What now?” Harry thought to himself.  Draco was saying all the right words, and he should be happy but his body language was telling a different story.  Although he just wanted to sweep the other man up into his arms and take him to bed, Harry knew they were a long way from that.  “Baby steps, then?” Harry suggested.  At Draco’s quizzical look, he clarified, “We’ll start out slow, ok?”
“Guess I am . . . Draco.”  Harry decided since he couldn’t remember last night, he better make some new memories.  He lifted his left hand to the back of Draco’s neck and tugged the other man closer.  He took advantage of Draco’s gasp of surprise when their lips met to slip his tongue into his mouth and slide against Draco’s tongue.  Draco moaned into his mouth and Harry took that as a sign he was doing something right, and deepened their kiss.
“No, not about that.  I know you lost your memory.  But I don’t believe I’m talking about an entirely different person,” Harry insisted.
“You have me.” Harry moved his hand to the back of Draco’s neck and pulled his head close.  Their lips met and clung, their mouths opened and tongues tangled.  The clapping and cheering of all of their friends and classmates finally penetrated Harry’s blissful bubble.  He pulled his mouth back and looked around at all of the smiling faces.  “Uh . . . glad you all approve, but I think we’ll take this elsewhere.”  Harry took Draco’s hand and pulled him along toward the boys’ dormitories.  He kept tugging until they reached his room, then he drew him over to his bed.  Once they reached his bed, Harry lay back down and held out his hand.  “Join me?”
While Thropwaite floated a cursed object over to each pair’s desk, Malfoy copied down the new spell and began to practice it.  “Now when you cast the Revealing Spell,” Professor Thropwaite was speaking again, “the results should show as symbols around the object.  Use the chart that we completed last week as a reference to determine the nature of the curse.”  After he finished talking, he floated an ornate hairbrush onto Harry and Malfoy’s desk.  It was polished silver with ornate scrollwork decorating it.  Harry had the random thought that it looked like something that might be at home on Malfoy’s own dresser.
Harry decided Draco could find out for himself that he would soon be doing anything and everything he could to stop their daughter from crying.  He showed Draco how to prepare Al’s bottle, and then how to change her nappy.  When he first started, Draco had pulled out a small notebook and was taking copious notes.  Harry would give anything to get a glimpse of Draco’s notes on how to change a nappy, he was sure they would be hilarious.
“You died?” Just saying it sounded wrong to Draco and caused an aching to start in his chest. What the devil was Potter talking about? Potter just nodded silently and didn’t seem inclined to elaborate. “Salazar,” Draco whispered under his breath, before shaking off this inconvenient emotion. “Well then,” he said briskly. “Potter, you are my mother’s last hope.”
“What do you want, Draco?” Harry whispered.
“What?  What are you doing?” Harry squawked.
“Not a morning person?” Malfoy quipped, raising one eyebrow and smirking.
“Please!  Yes, please Draco!” Harry thrust his hips up into the air.
“Yeah, you kind of do,” Harry whispered back.
One minute to spare.  Harry looked toward the house and used one finger to loosen his tie, the tiniest bit.  He shoved his hands into his pockets.  No doubt “ruining the lines of the suit” but too nervous to care.  All of the moisture in his mouth had dried up.  What if Draco hated this?  What if this was a terrible mistake?
“Yes!” Draco nodded curtly, “How in the hell did that happen?”
Hermione grabbed Harry’s hand and squeezed tightly for a minute.  “Time for the baby,” she said after taking a deep breath.  “My water’s broken, and I’m having some contractions.”  She looked up at Harry and smiled, “Your baby’s coming, Harry!”
Harry realized that the temperature must have dropped and he knew that his floor was cold.  “Here.  Get in, you’re freezing,” Harry quickly scooted over to the middle of the bed and pulled back the covers invitingly.  When Draco hesitated, Harry encouraged, “Come on, before the sheets get cold.”
Harry stared at Draco, putting all of his energy into willing him to wake up and smile at him.  He had never been a very religious man, but he was willing to pray to any and all gods and goddesses if they could help save Draco.
Draco put his other hand down, bracketing Harry’s head and resting all of his weight.  He pushed his tongue into Harry’s mouth, tongues sliding and lips clinging as their kiss went on and on.
Harry stood by and watched while Draco fussed with his tie and the folds of his robes.  Finally, he broke the silence. “We should go now, Draco.”  Draco looked over to him and gave him a short nod.
Harry felt pain lancing through his chest.  Draco didn’t remember him as anything other than a bitter rival.  All of the love and joy from the past three years had evaporated.  Was it possible that even though Draco had survived, that he would lose him anyway?  Harry twisted his wedding ring, round and round his finger.  Their rings were platinum snakes.  Harry’s snake had grey gems for eyes, and Draco’s green.  Draco had designed the rings himself, persuading Harry that the snake symbolized both of them because of Harry’s Parseltongue ability.  Harry adored his ring and never took it off, but he did tend to play with it when he was anxious.
They had their bookbags, so they spent the remainder of the afternoon reading and doing homework.  Their friends all trooped in after dinner to see how they were.  By some unspoken agreement, both Harry and Malfoy remained tight lipped with their friends about the nature of the curse.
"I'll order. Or you don't trust my taste?" Draco asked.
"I don't understand." Draco looked confused at the remark and the other man seemed to regret saying it right away.
"I guess that's inevitable," Draco admitted with a wry grin.
They were both relieved to see them do as instructed, but as they cleared out the Weasley family became visible behind them. Harry thought Draco would leave him at that point, but instead they walked towards them together.
"Well, we could go back to the house, or there is a lovely restaurant on my favourite square."
Harry wondered briefly what 'girls' she was talking about, then remembered that Ginny sometimes spent time with the women she met at balls and such. She was so rarely home, it was a mystery to him how she kept up her friendships.
"That is fine, young man. However, if your wife leads you so easily, then how can you hope to lead Our World?" Mr. Milder asked pointedly.
“All right, Potter.” Malfoy had probably realised that that little bit of history was never taught at school and Potter obviously had no interest in politics, so he would not have found out on his own. Thus, he settled back in his really uncomfortable seating and started to tell the story: “About 300 years ago the Potters joined the Wizengamot. They took the place of the Gaunt family. The Gaunts were a Dark Family, but intermarried too much and when not a single offspring was deemed sane enough for the position, they were voted out. At the same time, through an unfortunate accident another Dark Family, the Wenlocks died out as well. The Gaunts made even and the Wenlocks were the deciding vote. However, the Potters were a Light Family and they made it even. The Abbots played both sides as they seemed neutral at the time and managed to get in as well. Only when they had the position, they declared their true alliance to the Light Families. Thus, for three hundred years, the Light Families had the deciding vote,” he finished with a flourish.
"What? You want to fill your house with Weasleys?"
"In October, when she announced she was going to get a divorce."
"Great! Write the letter and then take the kids to school and such. I have a shopping date with some of the girls." She jumped up from the table to kiss him goodbye and was already heading out the door.
"So you need to kick Hermione out and get your wife and kids back here. Then, you need to publicly renounce her and tell everyone that you want her back in her proper place," he finished.
“Where will she go?” Harry wondered. After the war Hermione had tried to reverse the memory spell that she had put on her parents, but it had turned out that she had put so much conviction into the spell that it was permanent. That was when she had been forced to move in with the Weasleys, as she had no home and no money. Harry offered, but Hermione did not want to intrude just when Harry was finally putting his life together and finding himself. So that now left her with no one to really rely on. It was probably easy for her to marry Ron after that, as they were already living together and a couple at the same time. It was a natural progression of their relationship.
The ballroom in Malfoy Manor was full of Dark Wizards. It wasn't anything new to the residents of the house, but Harry felt rather uncomfortable in his dark green robes. He felt like the lone Gryffindor in a sea of Slytherins. They were all celebrating the passing of the bill. It had been a long time since they managed to make a law. Many went to chat with Harry and congratulate him. He blushed under the attention and ran a shaky hand through his hair. To gain some courage and not look like the complete novice that he was, he often grabbed a glass of champagne from the passing trays. The waiters were surprisingly human, surprisingly enough, something he wondered about.
Arthur smiled indulgently at his only daughter.
With the knowledge of something irreplaceable breaking, he smiled at his daughter as she showed him the pictures of the dark-haired knight and the green dragon with yellow scales down its back. He marvelled at Lily’s skill and it was soon time for dinner.
“He does?” The surprise was clear on Harry’s face and Malfoy looked ready to punch him.
"Oh Harry, I'm sure they won't. We love them, no matter how they came to being." Hermione tried to reassure him. "What if we keep the whole thing as a last resort?"
Harry found deep blue robes and white trousers on the bed. It was a colour combination he would have never worn. All his trousers were black or brown and he tended to stay away from blue as well. Except for a pair of Muggle jeans he bought for comfort. He put on the clothes and was glad to find that they did actually fit him. He found a triple mirror in one corner and gazed at his reflection.
"Just not the ones with a high sugar content. Green apples are fine," she answered and even smiled a little.
She smiled, and went on eating her food. While eating the rest of their meal, she explained to him the diet in greater detail, making Harry dread the coming months. It was not going to be easy. For a second he wondered why he went along with it, then remembered that nowadays, he always went along with everything.
Harry just pointed at the bottle, still remarkably full. Draco drank down what he had, poured, drank, poured again, and once finished with that, put the glass down.
Harry recalled talking to her that night. He gently tried to tell her without actually saying out loud that he wasn't in love. She asked him to wait, consider it, to go to sleep and maybe talk about it when they weren't so tired. Then the talk never came.
"I can be your wife," he said, in heavily accented English. "I can be anything you want, mister. Don't need much money, very cheap, for a handsome man like you."
“I don’t see a point in staying married,” the blond explained. “Besides, I’d feel weird, carrying this around, while I was with you,” Draco said, pulling down his wedding ring. He placed it in Harry’s palm, who just stared at it. “It never meant much to me. It was just a way to produce a legitimate heir. I do have that. I just didn’t get a divorce earlier, because it didn’t seem important.”
"No, Harry. Get up, it's noon already." She continued to shake him.
There sat Hermione and she was more elegant than ever. The dark-haired man was reminded of how she looked at the Yule ball. She didn't appear so beautiful even on her wedding day. She wore a pale yellow robe that looked incredibly soft and her hair rested on her left shoulder in effortless, but obviously sculptured waves. She held a delicate cup in her hand with its saucer in the other that Harry felt very uncomfortable about touching himself, as two identical sets rested on the ornate white iron table in front of her, just waiting for the two men.
They shared a smile at the thought of their children.
"I'm just not so sure I want to bring up the cheating, or the potion."
“Tea?” Hermione asked suddenly. She seemed a bit nervous.
"Why do you want to go on a vacation?"
“Are you sure?” Harry asked. “She’s not the type.”
"But I do."
"Move already," Draco moaned after a few seconds, and Harry complied with a chuckle.
That over, Harry knew it was time to sit down. First, he looked at Arthur, who patted the empty space next to him. Then he turned his head to Draco, who just looked at him, face blank. He was still leaving an opening for him after everything they had discussed. Harry was encouraged by that. He cast a last glance towards Arthur Weasley and said goodbye in his head. Then to the astonishment of everyone, he turned right, towards the Dark families and walked straight to Draco, sitting down beside him. The Head Mugwump seemed like he was going to comment, maybe tell him that he was on the wrong side, but the determination in Harry's eyes stopped him.
Harry went back to the dining-room and resumed eating. He also asked Dinky to take up some food for Hermione, just in case she felt up to eating something.
Finally, he reached the waistband of the boxer shorts and pulled it down. Draco's erection sprang forth, and he sat back on his heels to gaze at it. He had never thoroughly examined another man's cock before. Of course, he had seen others in the communal showers, but he always tried not to look too closely. It was a darker pink than the rest of him. Already erect, it was a bit smaller than his and thinner. The tip curved slightly upwards. The blond curls around the base were obviously clipped and stylised, but not taken completely off. It looked beautiful to him, just like the rest of the man. He felt the saliva pool in his mouth, and he bent down to give the tip an experimental lick. Draco moaned what could have been his name, but he was too focused on the member before him. The taste was slightly rubbery and salty, but not overpoweringly so. Harry got comfortable, lying on his belly and keeping himself up on his elbows. He bent his head again and remembered how he liked it. He swirled his tongue around the head, then slowly went down, to suck the shaft into his mouth. When he couldn't take anymore, he flattened his tongue against the underside, and went back up, only keeping the tip in his mouth. He kept repeating the procedure until he worked out a rhythm, that wasn't too slow or fast. When he didn't have to concentrate on keeping his teeth away, he started to play with Draco's balls, rolling them in his hand. The sounds the other man gave proved that he liked that as well, and turned Harry on incredibly.
* * *
Hermione took her time gathering her thoughts. Malfoy tended to rattle everyone and she had grown so unused to communicating with anyone who wasn’t family. She had been too busy with trying to be the perfect wife and mother.
"Well, you can do that."
At that moment, it hit him. Ginny was safe, comfortable, part of the Burrow, home but not love, passion, desire. When he was away, training hard, he didn't think of going home to her. He thought of going home to all of the Weasleys. About Molly's pumpkin pie and Sunday roast. Conversing with Arthur about random Muggle things. Chatting with Ron about training. He had only been together with Ginny a year and the thought of sex with her didn't raise his interest. He wasn't in love with Ginny.
"Or else what?" Hermione asked, her voice forceful, but emotionless. "What are you going to do, Ron Weasley? What can you do except bully everyone around you? I don't know how I could stand you as long as I did. I must have been blinded by love. Well, I don't love you anymore," she declared. "Lucius, I'm sorry, but could you take me home?" Hermione asked, turning to her escort. "I tire of this."
"Can I change in the room, please?"
"Draco, about last night..." he began.
"Weasley here is requesting a new partner. He says his reason is that you're  sleeping with his wife, Potter." Harry shifted in his seat at the  accusation. "You know I don't tolerate any disruptions in the lives of my  Aurors. I find their work suffers and that is when people get killed." At  that moment he seemed to have finished glaring at Ron, so he turned instead  towards Harry, who tried to not flinch. "So, I called you here to work this  out."
"So true, Astoria," agreed another woman, though Harry had no idea who she was, he couldn't even see her. He did decide that is was better to eavesdrop if he wasn't seen, so he left the opening, but still managed to hear everything.
On the morning of the ‘Great Vote' as he had taken to thinking of it, he was feeling very nervous. Just a few more hours and his life would change forever. As he stood before the mirror shaving with his wand, he was infinitely grateful for the wizard who had invented that spell. His hands were shaking so badly that he would have killed himself with anything sharp. He finished quickly and let Ginny have the bathroom.
"You married her because you loved her." It wasn't a question.
"They're hot too."
There were many more points. Wives had very little rights to start with. There were no laws against physical or psychological abuse. It was all very archaic. Draco explained that there used to be much more legislation for women, but since the Light Families had taken over, they were deemed unnecessary and against the integrity of the family, so they were erased. With Hermione's help, they took a look at how Muggles had formulated their protection laws and took those as an example. Harry noticed that child protection laws were also lacking and they made it the subject of their next project.
"I wanted that so much. I always did. Now that I have you where I want you, I'm going to make sure that you never think about me as your enemy again."
She just shook her head, and planted a kiss on his face.
"Oh, the members don't get paid? I didn't know that." Harry was playing dumb very well and he actually couldn't believe how easy it was to fool her. "You know, Ginny, maybe I should learn more. This whole thing with Hermione got me interested in finding out more about the laws and such. Being on the Wizengamot would give me even more opportunities and it would be something I could do for Our World without putting myself in danger. We don't need the money I make as an Auror anyway, thanks to our investments. I feel I could really make a difference." He surprised himself by actually telling the truth, but twisting it in a way that Ginny would hear what she wanted to. Perhaps the Hat had been right all along and all this time he was just really hiding...
"You got two things?" Ginny inquired from her husband.
"Best ever."
"Fine. If you hate it, just push me away," he said, as he got to his feet, swaying, and made it to the other couch through sheer force of will. He flopped down next to Harry and took his glass from him, placing it on the table.
That night they both went to sleep knowing that things were once again good between them.

"I'm sorry," he said, and practically ran out the door.
"No, but the airport is close, so we have to turn to the landing site over the water."
"Why?"
"Voldemort got his old body back."
“Draco, this is our first Valentine’s Day together, but the first of many. This day is about celebrating love and romance. Before you came into my life, I had no idea of what romantic love was really like. How it makes every day that I can spend with you so much more special. Thank you,” he ended and they drank their Merlot.
"Oh, can he come and play? My dad doesn't have many other friends who have children I could play with." He made a sad face and dropped his head a little to look up pleadingly through blond lashes. The boy obviously knew how to look as cute as possible, so that he couldn't be refused. Harry hated to admit it, but it was working too.
The next morning, he was woken in the usual way, as he had every Christmas morning since James was four. Their bed was invaded by their excited children, all demanding that they get up and go down with them to open their presents. Harry loved these mornings as they reminded him that his children had a happy childhood. They quickly put their dressing gowns on and hurried downstairs.
"Hello!" he called.
"That doesn't matter. You were a child and you helped too when we were taken here. That took guts, even though you were beyond scared."
They were lounging in bed a few hours later, too tired to do anything but bask in the afterglow, when there was a knock on a window. Draco couldn't be bothered to get up, so it was left to Harry to drag his naked self out of bed to let in the owl. He immediately recognised it as Teddy's. He felt a bit guilty, since he should have written a letter to his godson after declaring himself for the Dark side, but he was a bit afraid as to how the boy would handle it.
"I know. I want your opinion," Harry raised his voice, the alcohol boosting his Gryffindor brashness.
"She's a disgrace, that's what she is!" Ron remarked after he consumed enough alcohol to drown a goldfish.
Once the elf had disappeared, Harry sat down on his ornate couch, a piece Ginny insisted on, and waited for Ron to appear. He was sure that once Hermione told the redhead the bad news, he would immediately Floo Harry. He was debating whether to tell Ron about knowing of the situation before he did, but he knew that he was a terrible liar and it would be no use trying to hide things from his best friend. So when the flames changed to green and a disgruntled
If you haven't read my little ‘spin-off' story, you can read it on most sites where I have this up. It's about how Hermione got ready for the ball in chapter 9.
Read and review guys! Love reviews.
They let go and stood next to their father, ready to be introduced.
Draco nodded.
It was late in the afternoon, and he was really starting to feel pangs of hunger. He wanted to go in and get dinner started, but the blond was delaying him with his tantrum.
"Well, just that Arthur said the vote should go off without a hitch."
Like in most of them, the place was packed. Almost naked bodies gyrated to loud techno music, neon lights flashed, illuminating them and revealing that some of them were making out, or practically having sex standing up. Harry was amazed by what he was seeing. His wife loved Patong as she went there a lot. He couldn't understand it as he didn't imagine her loving the party atmosphere, which the city seemed to be all about.
"Oh, I know. He is very discreet about it though, so no one actually knows." She chuckled to herself at the little joke. "He loves to string women along just for the fun of it. How do
"I just hope that the Weasleys are not trying to turn them against me," she spoke up.
"You are right. I have become lenient with her," he admitted as there really was no way of denying it.
"Yes. I'm scheduled a week from now, but I'd really like to leave now."
“No thank you. Let’s get to business, shall we?” he suggested. The other two people nodded. “As I understand, Hermione would like to divorce her husband, finally, and keep her children as well.”
"Don't be silly. Where would you put them? A couple of other families are staying here too. Tomorrow it'll be like one big family picnic. It'll be fun, you'll see."
“Daddy! I’m done with the pictures!” the voice of Lily came from the stairs.
"Yes, if you want to know! That awkward fumbling that you call sex and lasts a grand total of about five minutes is not good enough!"
Finally, Harry arrived to his destination and gazed up at the great twin doors that led inside. He did not see a knocker or a bell, and was just starting to wonder how he would make his presence known, when they parted before him to reveal Draco standing there.
"Well, Harry, Ginny says that you would like to take your place in the Wizengamot." Arthur got right down to business.
"Of course, Daddy. I have an idea already." She grinned at Harry, probably already picturing him in the outfit.
"It wouldn't have worked. I sucked at the Unforgivables. Severus probably saved my life that day." His voice was still full of pain as he remembered his late godfather. "I was never really angry at you about that curse, even if I still have some scars. In a way, the pain felt like a relief. I felt more pain in my soul than the rips in my body from the curse. Then, what you did for us during and after the war ... I'll never be able to thank you enough for keeping me out of Azkaban. Your testimony on our behalf was what kept my mum and I out of there and gave my father a lighter sentence - even though he was such a bastard to you." He stopped and looked the other man in the eye. His own grey eyes were full of emotion and Harry was struck by how different he looked from the usual haughty Malfoy.
“Can’t she like, I don’t know, stay more?” James was clearly getting more upset.
Harry was satisfied with the day's work as he managed to get something for all of his children. For him, only the extended family was left. His wife, on the other hand, had most of her shopping before her.
He went into the toilet and enlarged his trunk with a wandless spell. His first order of business was to brush his teeth as he could still taste bile in his mouth. Next, he changed into his swimming trunks and flip-flops, and then applied some tanning potion onto his skin. Afterwards, he got out some money and put it into a small waterproof bag that had some nasty Thief Repellent Charms on it. With his wand, he shrunk his trunk again and darkened his glasses into sunglasses. He then put the wand into the bag as well and was ready to hit the beach.
Phase three went into action the next morning. Harry was having his usual breakfast and Ginny was still glaring at the plate. The kids were there as well, but they were a lot happier about their diet than they had been on the first few occasions.
"Fine. I think you should divorce her. I never knew why you married her in the first place. She's a groupie. She married Harry Potter, war hero, boy-who-bloody-lived, celebrity. Not
Harry pushed the disturbing images that Adrian's speech created in his mind to the very back, sealed in a box on top of shelf 'do not disturb'. He swore to stay away from all thoughts concerning Draco and sex in the future. They were too unsettling.
"So the name lives on."
Harry just sighed and didn't even comment on that.
Although the blond did flinch at what she said, she only had to look at him to know that he knew a lot about being inbred. "If people in a closed community intermarry too often, like cousins with cousins, then there's a good chance of them producing unhealthy offspring. Unfortunately, even the wizards and witches who appear healthy often have problems with having children themselves."
"Are you insane, Harry?" she practically screeched at him. She had the shower going by then, but she had obviously used some sort of a charm to make sure that she heard Harry through the sound of the water. "On the one hand, Ginny is shorter and way skinnier than I am. I'd never fit into anything and using charms on those clothes would ruin them. I've seen what she wears all the time and those fabrics don't take to enlarging charms well. Besides, the way we are now, she'd be really cross with me if I wore anything of hers."
Harry found a toy Snitch and decided to get one for James as he often said that he wanted to follow in his parents' footsteps and become a Seeker just like them. He had completed his purchase, but Ginny was still engrossed in the conversation. He squared his shoulders and got ready to ascertain his authority as a proper husband. A month earlier, he would have just let her enjoy herself, but now he had to change.
"Yes, Harry," she said with a sweet smile on her face. "I know you're terrible at politics, so that's why I never told you about them. My father has been holding onto them in your stead. He has our seat and we thought that it would be simpler if he just managed your seats together with the Weasley seat. You have one for the Potter and one for the Black family. He's been doing a splendid job and without getting paid too."
"I just don't know."
The next day Harry woke up feeling more refreshed and alert than he had in a long time. He had only been on the diet for less than two days, but it seemed to be working. Harry had so much energy that he wanted to jump out of bed, run into James' room and rouse him, then tickle Albus awake, and lastly, blow a raspberry into Lily's tummy. But they were with Ginny, he realised, and his good spirit threatened to evaporate. However, he shook himself and managed to not let that dampen his mood. He quickly got ready for the day. It was a Saturday, which meant no work, but Harry couldn't stop thinking about last night and contemplating Hermione's difficult situation.  Saturday or not, he had things to do today.
Draco quickly cast a locking spell on the door, and then dropped to his knees. As he started to divest Harry of his trousers, the other man could just moan and think what a lucky guy he was.
"So then, shall we go to my office to discuss plans?" Draco asked.
Harry finished his dinner quickly and he wondered whether or not he should change. He looked down at his house clothes, the rather worn loose trousers and the T-shirt and then looked over at his friend. Changing would be a good idea, he decided and let Hermione know that he would be in his rooms. So he went up to his bathroom, cleaned his teeth and face. Afterwards he selected his favourite emerald-green shirt and black trousers. He reluctantly put on a short black robe. He was still not used to wearing such things outside of work, but the shorter ones were not such a bother. They were quite modern as well, he supposed. He hadn't seen short robes until a few years before, and he was glad that they appeared as they weren't as annoying as the long kind. He didn't bother with his hair as he knew it would be in vain, so he went down to see that Hermione had already finished her meal.
Harry was painfully aroused. That much he knew. He also knew he wanted to explore further. He couldn't remember any girls' kisses ever affecting him so much, but he was also afraid. The thought of embracing what he felt was terrifying. It wasn't just the physical aspect. Kissing Draco felt so right, as if it was the one thing he was missing from his life. When he was still happy with Ginny, she felt like home. Draco, however, felt like fire; deliciously warm, almost burning, and still consuming. He felt alive. He didn't want the feeling to stop. It wasn't just about the physical things that Draco made him feel, either. All his life he had been looking at the blond, and while he kept telling himself that he was checking what his enemy was up to, he had been lying to himself. He had been watching the strangely beautiful pale boy he had met in the robe shop. Draco was also smart, intelligent, and he enjoyed his company. In their adulthood their differences had become milder and their similarities strengthened. Harry wanted to be with him. He wanted to be the one to whisper dirty things in his ear on a balcony in the middle of a party. He wanted that lean body in his arms and those lips on his. However, he also wanted to feel so calm, secure and at peace with the world as he has when he slept next to Draco in the greenhouse
* * *
As he entered the living-room, he knew what to expect. And there indeed was Hermione, sobbing, with her old beaded bag in her hand. He just went to her and hugged her, same as he would if Lily was in pain.
The blond sighed, and sat down on one of the sofas. Harry wondered where to sit, but decided to sit in front of him, to avoid getting caught up in something physical.
"Didn't you visit Wizard sites?" asked Hermione.
and the cover depicted a blonde witch in the arms of a dark-haired wizard, both moving towards each other to stop just short of a kiss.
On the way there, he thought about telling Hermione about his budding relationship, but he wasn't sure. It was a big revelation about himself, and he wanted to declare it from the rooftops. However, he wasn't all that sure just what sort of relationship he now had with Draco. Was it friends with benefits? Boyfriends? They just didn't get around to discussing it yet. In the end, he decided to see what Draco would do. If he didn't say anything, then Harry wanted to discuss things in the evening.
"Oh... that's good." She observed them with a suspicious twinkle in her eyes.
“Oh really? You are such an expert in relationships, Malfoy?” she said, not being able to let that slide. “I never heard of you dating anyone. Your marriage just came out of the blue.”
"Well, for a while, I humoured Ron. I accepted his proposal, but told him that I wanted a long engagement. He could visit me at my apartment, and we wouldn't have to put up with all the ruckus at the Burrow."
"It's some kind of a mediwizard. I wasn't really interested beyond that, I was just trying to fill in an awkward silence one time when I couldn't help being alone with her. She's so ugly too! Ah! I don't want to talk about her anymore! Primrose, who made your costume? That stitching is absolutely divine!" She changed the subject.
"Horses? No. I've only sat on the back of a Thestral once, if that counts."
Draco looked at him with eyes that seemed to gaze into his soul.
Harry was glad to be surrounded by them and hugged them tightly. Hermione and Scorpius also left the water and she had a question on her face. Harry just mouthed 'later'.
"I knew you didn't belong there, in spite of everything and your mum saved my life. She saved all of us."
They soon reached the entrance hall and Draco opened one side of the great doors.
"Harry, what were you thinking taking Hermione in?" was the first thing that  came out of her mouth.
“Well, during sixth year, when you were supposedly going out with Ginny, you spent more time stalking Malfoy. You always had something other than girls keeping you occupied when other boys had nothing but them on their minds,” she pointed out. She had apparently decided to occupy her mind with something other than her own problems.
“There is a woman who says is your wife outside the gates. She’s screaming and yelling.”
Dinky laid out their breakfast. Harry ate ham and eggs with toast, James cereals, Albus a sandwich and Lily porridge. The tea was served and doctored to their tastes as well and their fruit juice was poured. Ginny insisted on them having fruit juice even when she was not there. Just as every morning.
"Home. She's watching Ron's and your kids tonight," Arthur replied dismissively.
He looked up, and as grey meet green, Harry understood that Malfoy was as desperate to bring about the reforms as Hermione was to get her children back. While the witch thought about her family, the wizard thought about a whole generation. The dark-haired man nodded in understanding, confirming their earlier pact.
"We're friends," Draco pointed out.
Harry complied and increased the speed of his movements. Draco under him was trying to hold back, he knew, but he still made little jerks to either have Harry take more of him into his mouth, or put more of his finger into his arse. When the moans changed into Harry's name in a breathless and repeated fashion, he knew the man was close, and wasn't surprised when, his mouth was flooded with his seed, and the tight ring of muscles clenched around his finger. He tried to swallow, but it was so much, he choked, and ended up coughing it up onto the bed in an effort not to suffocate.
They got to a point where there was a great view of the city, and Draco pointed out that they could see the house from there.
"When did it start?"
"Fine. Whatever," she said and turned back to her packing.
"That's really not me, is it?" Harry mused.
"Just think, men like that used to stand where we are now." Draco draped an arm over Harry's shoulder, looking at the figures.
"No. I'm going to train to become a healer," Hermione said with a smile. "It'll take some time and I'll have to rely on the Malfoys for a bit longer, but they make me feel at home. At first I thought I was imposing, but they seem to enjoy having more people in the house."
"All right," Draco complied.
"That's the San Teodoro Church," Draco spoke up as the taxi pulled away. "It's one of the oldest churches in Rome. It had been renovated not long ago. Pretty place. We can have a look tomorrow when we go sightseeing. If you look up at those trees," he pointed above the build in front of them, "that's the Palatinus. It has some of the oldest ruins in Rome. We'll need a full day for it. The Colosseum is just on the other side. I have so much to show you, these few days probably won't be enough."
"Harry, why on earth would you do that?! You love your job!"
Harry Apparated into Malfoy Manor solely relying upon instinct to guide him. The upheaval in his soul was so great, he felt like he was again immersed in water like just a couple of hours before. His limbs moved with difficulty, and the currents of his emotions threatened to pull him down into the abyss.
Harry expected to get a taxi, but Draco assured him that the Leonardo Express train would be an experience in itself. As they sat down, he resolved to acting as unlike tourists as they could possible act.
"That is good to hear, but you could have just sent a letter."
"Oh, there's Linda! I'd better go and say hi." Ginny got up and was already shouting to her friend. Harry watched her go and looked to Arthur.
"That's right."
"I'm sorry, sir, but I'm afraid I cannot let you in the room without your wife being present."
"I can't believe you swallowed all that."
"I hope a new war isn't going to break out over these discoveries," he voiced his concern.
* * *
Harry was a bit afraid of what his children would say to that, but the exclamations of joy put his mind at rest. The older Malfoys were smiling as well, and Hermione wore a wide grin.
"I'm glad you can admit it."
The month of December had passed quickly and was blissfully almost over. He had been very busy, but his efforts had paid off. The voting for his seats was scheduled for January 9th, which was ironically Snape's birthday, as Draco had pointed out. Once that was done, he could finally end the charade. He wondered how Ginny was going to react, since the break with Light Wizards also meant a break with her family. He found himself not particularly caring.
Draco elegantly sat down in front of the grand piano, his long fingers caressed the keys for a moment. Then he began a beautiful ballad that enchanted Harry. As he watched his hands play the piano, he remembered them playing other things and had to fight the urge to drag the man away from the restaurant.
"We'll be keeping a close eye on them, Harry, rest assured," Narcissa informed him.
"Do you have news, or you were just bored?"
"I don't have scruffy trainers."
"Everyone, I have an announcement to make," Harry began. "We're not returning to our house. We discussed it with Draco, and for a while, all four of us are going to live in the Manor."
Draco wasn't very happy about not going after Ginny, but he understood that Harry wanted to spare his children. A clean break was going to be the best.
Harry was a bit nervous as he took in the pale feast of flesh, but he let it go and resolved to enjoy the moment. This was exactly what he wanted.
He felt lips on his. Thin but not too thin. More forceful than Ginny ever tried. They moved over his, and then pried them apart to plunge a tongue between his teeth.
"You don't have to."
Off she went, to plant herself in Draco’s lap, who grinned at her, apparently glad that she liked him. She gave him a big wet kiss, then rested her head on his shoulder. The man’s arms went around her to keep her safe.
"He's not going to be happy about it."
The morning after their first night together Harry woke first. He basked in the sunlight streaming through the windows and in the warmth of the arms of his lover. However, he couldn't stay there forever and decided to make breakfast for Draco.
"I wasn't in love with Ginny when I married her. But then why did I marry her?"
"Don't do this. Think about the children. I don't want to bring up what I saw in Thailand."
“No,” they chorused, but James was still looking a bit surly. He had been with his mother the longest, as she only started to travel a lot after Lily’s birth. Everyone stood to leave.
, and it basically depicted attempted rape. While that part wasn't good, the figures were still beautiful. Apollo was slender, fine featured, and if Harry remembered right, blond in pictures. Truth be told, he did look a lot like Draco, so Harry supposed, that was his type of man. He wished he could have taken a picture of Draco besides the statue, but they weren't allowed to take their cameras in. They did buy a book of the Gallery though. Harry considered learning photoshop.
"Harry, you know I can't do that."
"Draco, why don't you find something with music?" Harry asked one day after he came home from work and found his lover watching a movie again. "I know you learned to play the violin from the time you were a small boy."
"So do I. However, Ginny has not been around much these past years, so that may work in our favour. If we could prove her lifestyle in Thailand, it would also be good grounds for
"Now now, Mr Potter, that is over your limit," said the goblin from behind him, startling him.
“She loves to travel and before she never had the opportunity. I’m glad that I can provide that for her now and I’m happy to watch the kids. Of course I miss her, but as long as she’s happy, I’m happy. I don’t know where you are going with this Hermione. My marriage is a good one. I wouldn’t change anything about it.”
* * *
"My parents already know, and Hermione probably suspects, so we can let them know officially tomorrow."
Ginny seemed to think on it for a bit, then the light came on in her eyes.
“Happiness is not the purpose.” Malfoy seemed irritated with her prying into his life. “We have a son and my family has an heir. That’s all that matters. She can do whatever she wants as long as she doesn’t bring a shame on my name, or a bastard in my house. I don’t care. Nevertheless, your expectations in a marriage are different. He would have never meet your expectations, even I could see that from Slytherin.”
Now this folks, is a big one. You have all been waiting for it. :D Harry does a bit of traveling and I have posted pictures on my Facebook page that I used as reference. I'm also posting a link to the hotel I mentioned. It's a real place, I did a lot of research to be accurate, so please check it out.
"Mr and Mrs Potter! How good to see you! Albus run out of books again?" he asked.
"Really, Ron, what were you thinking?" He no longer whispered, but still didn't shout like he wanted to.
"Thank you for all your help, Arthur." He sincerely thanked the man, but couldn't help thinking that this was the last time they were going to have a pleasant exchange.
Hermione decided it was time for another drink and she got him another one. Once more, Malfoy drank it without looking, but couldn't manage to stop himself from the disgust showing all over his face. "Really, Potter, what sort of a Firewhisky do you keep?"
Harry turned and walked over to a small couch, tugging Draco along with him. He sat and pulled Draco down next to him. “I don’t have to go back,” he stated quietly.
Harry hooked his fingers into the waistband and pulled them down just enough to expose the head of Draco’s cock.  The foreskin was pulled back and the head was dark pink and wet with precome.  “Perfect,” Harry whispered.  He breathed a puff of warm air across the tip and Draco moaned as his prick jerked involuntarily.  Harry wet his lips and then darted his tongue out to tease all around the head.  Draco twisted the sheets tighter and arched his hips up seeking more friction.  Harry rewarded him by sucking the velvety head into his warm mouth and swirling his tongue all around it.
Draco just glared at Neville for a good long minute.  Draco’s voice when he finally spoke was dark and full of anger, “Yes.”
“I didn’t grab it,” Harry said defensively.  “I mean, he wouldn't stop and let me try and he obviously wasn’t doing anything.”  Harry’s cheeks filled with warm color as he squirmed under Dumbledore’s piercing gaze.  “I mean . . . it wasn’t, er . . . I couldn’t see any . . . yeah,” Harry sighed, “that’s when I grabbed the wand.”
“It has to be me, Draco,” Harry said quietly. “Your mother will need you as she recovers, and you know it.” Harry leaned into Draco’s grasp for a moment and then whispered in his ear, “Live your life and be happy Draco.” Then he carefully pulled away from Draco’s hands and walked over to Voldemort. “Send him back and break the curse.”
The oppressive silence of Draco’s failure was interrupted by a small squeaky voice. “Master Draco is needing you, Harry Potter,” Dilly scolded lightly. “Harry Potter is the most powerful wizard alive. Harry Potter must help Master Draco!” she insisted.
The day came and all of their friends crowded into their tiny living room and kitchen. Harry cooked a lovely ham. Draco got some noisemakers and they were spinning them freely. Harry decided to make a toast.
He searched for another hour when he decided to get off the streets and try his luck in another club. It was the same as every other before it with loud music and neon lights, but this one seemed to take debauchery to a new level. It had booths that people could separate from the rest of the world by drawing curtains around them. However, these were white and Harry could see the silhouettes of the people inside. He got a bit hot as he realised they were all having sex. In some of these partitions he could make out more than two people. He had only ever been with Ginny and he found himself wondering for a moment about what a threesome or moresome would be like. He shook his head. The place was getting to him. He was just about to tear his gaze from a booth where he could count about five people engaged in enjoying each other, when one of the people stopped and started to leave. As the curtain was drawn back, he came face to face with none other than his wife. She spotted him right away too and they stood staring at each other for what seemed like an eternity.
"You could quickly Apparate over to Gladrags. I know Ginny is a big customer of theirs and I would pay for it. Just tell them that I sent you and I'm sure they'd put something together for you in no time." Harry hoped he had arrived at a good solution. Women and their clothes...
"That was why we came to eat here. There is always a photographer about. The Alchemist is the most popular place right now. Famous people come here to be seen. I do applaud you coming here."
. It was uncanny how that boy loved Potions, when neither of his parents did. He was also extremely intelligent, having learned how to read and write at the age of four from his Aunt Hermione. Ever since then he had read everything he could get his hands on, first starting with Harry’s old school books. Of course, besides those there were not many books around, so they had to make frequent stops at book stores once he was done with those. Which took him three months. Harry just hoped he would use all the spare time he had at Hogwarts gaining friends. Albus wanted to go to Hogwarts already, but there were no early admissions. He couldn’t wait to discuss things with professors and finally have more people to talk to than Aunt Hermione. His parents hardly understood what he spoke about most of the time, hence all the reading. Not even Hermione’s children could keep up with him, both too much like their father, Ron.
"I want to see your favourite square." Harry grinned.
"Yes! My book has been doing good, your band is getting recognised, we can have a nice dinner out."
"Okay, Harry. I'll go and watch the boys fly then." Harry was glad to see that the loneliness was no longer in her eyes. She apparently enjoyed her time in Malfoy Manor and Harry was amazed by that. Who would have thought?
Harry roughly scrubbed the tears from his face.  Wait, what had just happened?  Had he really said that?  He had just been trying to get Draco to talk to him.  He knew he should go and apologize right now, but he was just too heart sore.  He planned to talk to Draco when he got home that night.
Blaise smiled warmly at Harry, “That’s okay, Harry.  Thanks for that, but I’m okay with answering the question.  I have nothing to hide.”  He flashed his most charming smile around the circle. “I like both.  The answer is, I like both.”
Harry had never before in his life given anyone a striptease, but the love and desire on his husband’s face spurred him on.  He popped the button and eased open the fly of his trousers.  He looked down, slid one hand inside and palmed himself, giving his dick a welcome squeeze.  Draco made a high needy groan and drew Harry’s attention back to him.  He was laid out in a long line, arching his hips off the bed and his hands were gripping the headboard so tightly that his knuckles had turned white.  “Fuck!” Harry growled.  Draco looked so delicious like that!  Harry hurriedly pushed off his trousers, leaving him in only his tight black boxer briefs.  He traced his fingers along the outline of his hard cock, teasing both himself and Draco.  Earning him another groan from the man on the bed.
Draco’s mother had made a miraculous recovery. The Healer couldn’t get over it. He was still regaling Draco with his convoluted theories of how he healed her, when Draco was once again summoned by Dilly. This time he was told that there was an important visitor in the library.
“I’m talking about the man who was moaning and crying out my name.  The man who was pushing himself onto my fingers and begging me to make him come!” Harry argued.  Harry swiped angrily at his eyes that were filling with tears again.
“Fuck!” Draco bit out.
But during their day of bliss, there was one thing that they hadn’t done.  Well, make that two things that they hadn’t done.  Firstly, they hadn’t fucked.  Like in the arse.  Harry wasn’t sure why they hadn’t.  Draco had slipped his fingers inside him a couple of times, and that had felt really good.  But they hadn’t gone farther than that.
“Master Draco is saying that the last three times Dilly is being in here.” Dilly scrunched up her wrinkled face and put her hands on her hips. “Master Draco is needing to eat, or he is falling ill!”
Harry tossed and turned most of the night, uncomfortable sleeping so close to Malfoy.  He could hear every little sigh and rustle from the other bed.  His brain putting unhelpful images to each little sound.  They both awoke with pain in the middle of the night and instead of waking Madam Pomfrey, they just moved the beds together themselves.  Then they both turned on their sides facing away from each other, to fall into a restless sleep.
"Sure, Harry," Draco said, his grin staying and took Harry's hand in his.
"You are very nice, but I'm really not gay," Harry insisted.
"You have been trying to learn proper Wizarding culture?" Malfoy was clearly surprised at the revelation.
"You're welcome, Harry," he said, still patting the thick unruly mane Harry called hair.
Harry blushed at the house-elves knowing what they had been up to.
"It's just that, you work so hard every day. I hate feeling useless. I want to contribute as well."
"Goodbye, Mr. Potter! Bring Albus when you can!" the little Malfoy spoke up from the doorway, where he was still standing.
"Were you?" Harry asked, not wanting to repeat what Draco said. It felt like an accusation.
"Yeah. Wasn't there a hedge around the road before?"
They entered the bookshop together and a jolly Christmas tune was playing. Harry looked around and noticed that above the entrance instead of a chime they had a fir tree with a face that animated itself upon their arrival and sang Jingle Bells. The proprietor behind the counter greeted them with a smile on his face.
Almost an hour later, they Apparated into one of the designated spots on the Alley and arm-in-arm swiftly walked to the restaurant. Harry's stomach was making audible noises by then and he really hoped they were going to get a table right away.
"Go ahead. Thanks to that little law you and blondie passed, I can have the children, your money, the house, everything. You can slobber all over the bookworm now. What Ron saw in her is beyond me."
Harry didn't get as much shut-eye as he had hoped; however, because he was woken again rather rudely a few hours later. It was another Weasley, though this one happened to be his wife. She was shaking him and calling out his name. He groaned and mumbled something unintelligent that he wanted to mean ‘go away', but he was unsuccessful as Ginny was relentless.
"Why?"
"I've had a crush on you since I saw you at Madame Malkins'. I tried to show off at every given opportunity, but it always managed to backfire on me," the blond admitted.
"Let's go home," Harry proposed and Ginny just nodded. They both Apparated home.
"What is it, Hermione?" he asked.
"Of course I am. I wouldn't have brought it up otherwise. I'll write him a letter after lunch. Have you ever been to Rome?"
"Oh," was all Draco said and he stood to get his own glass. He poured it full and sat back down, his eyes on Harry.
"What is that supposed to mean?" She raised her voice a bit and noticed from the corner of her eyes that the patrons sitting closer to them were eavesdropping.
"Well, I'm glad that's over," Draco spoke up and his calm tone startled Harry. He was still dazed from the slap and being told off by his wife. "Oh, come on Harry. I know this great restaurant nearby. We can finally have lunch together in public." The blond took his arm and led him towards the lifts. They were the only ones left on the corridor and their heels echoed in the empty space.
"Well, we stayed up all night on the solstice and had fun around the great bonfire in the garden." Scorpius began his account of the holiday. "When the sun finally came up the next day and the longest night was over, we cheered and thanked the gods. After that, we went into the house, got the presents from under the tree, and gave them to each other as symbols of how much we love each other. That's how wizards hold the holiday." The young Malfoy seemed very pleased with himself and Harry smiled at him in an attempt to disguise his puzzlement at the fact that he had never heard of such a thing. He supposed it was a dark wizard custom that he was going to have to follow in the future. Just as he was about to inquire of the whereabouts of the rest of the family, he heard the approach of the distinct steps of Draco. He was surprised for a moment by how easily he recognised them.
“We all know that you and Ginny had been dosing us with a complacency potion for all these years, but no longer. We could go to court now, and I’d have house-elf testimony for that. Thank you for that, by the way.” She paused for the dramatic effect. “If the Light side wouldn’t have made the law of Magical Creatures being equal in front of the law, then we wouldn’t be able to use it now. But you had to have that, to allow the house-elves to testify against their former masters.”
Harry got up and left with his head held high. At least if he studied some  law, he would be a better help to Hermione. Of course, she was probably  poring over books as well. He sat down at his desk, wondering where he was  going to get the books from, when Tyto, the Weasley family owl, landed in  front of him, carrying a familiar red envelope. With a sigh, he opened it as  he knew there was no use trying to get out of it. Just as he did it, the  voice of Molly Weasley rang out loud, deafening the whole office.
“So, apparently you also got a new gig from it,” Harry said, sitting down on the bed, getting ready to undress.
"Were you planning to?"
"What about?"
Harry laughed with her and imagined the blond playing with an equally blonde doll.
"I sent out my letters to some available positions. However, I didn't get anything back until we left school, so I had to go to the Burrow." At that point Hermione frowned. Harry recognised the sign of her memories becoming vague, just like his have. "I know I got back answers, but by then I was caught up in organising the wedding with Mrs Weasley. Then we got married a few weeks before you did, Harry. I got busy with helping Mrs Weasley around the house. She kept telling me that to be a good wife I had to learn this and that, and I was so eager to please. It's like I forgot all about my earlier plans. Why did I do that?" her face was puzzled.
"No," Harry admitted.
“Wait, you didn’t
"Good. If you would have said you were doing this because we're all friends now, I would not have believed you," Hermione confessed.
The room was almost dark, with a sliver of light peeking through the curtains. His sheets were a soft green, and his bed a lot more comfortable than in his dream. He was startled as the door opened, and Draco walked in carrying a tray. He was wearing pyjamas, with his favourite dark green robe thrown over it.
The first flecks of snow arrived, signalling the approach of winter. Harry invited Draco for a stroll, and the blond was surprised to find a snowball in his face. For a moment he almost seemed angry, but then hurled a ball of his own towards Harry. They had fun building a snowman, which of course led to a make-out session in the snow.
"I was,” she agreed. “I don't know what happened, but I feel like I woke up from a long sleep. Maybe it's my diet."
Harry did as promised and in a few moments joined the other man on his couch.
"Thank you," Harry said, and left, hearing 'phohb gaan my khraap' called out behind him. He assumed it was Thai for 'goodbye'.
Draco led him to his bedroom and the enormous bed they had shared the previous evening. They stopped next to it and Draco slipped his robe off, letting it pool around his feet. He locked eyes with Harry as he unbuttoned his shirt, but not too slowly, he was too impatient for that. As the pale torso was revealed, Harry couldn't help his gaze darting down to drink it all in. The flat chest seemed more inviting than Ginny's more rounded one, even though she never had large breasts, just when she was breastfeeding. It was those male nipples he wanted to taste. Then Draco bent to pull his trousers off, and in a second he was standing in a pair of tight boxer shorts.
"You were a kid too, when you killed Voldemort," he pointed out.
"Yes, Mr Potter. Albus Dumbledore, your guardian has primary ownership of your vault until you graduate at Hogwarts and he's set a limit of 50 Galleons a year gold withdrawal."
"Ah, Mr Potter," said the goblin from behind his high desk. "A withdrawal, right?"
“No. He’s a great father.”
Harry realised that the boy in front of him was probably Malfoy's son. He looked so much like his father with his large grey eyes and white blond hair that he was mentally thrown back into the robe shop where he and Draco had first met. Although obviously, the boy was a lot younger than Draco had been back then. He estimated him to be about Albus' age.
"I've promised to help you." Harry refused to hear her protests. "I have a lot of money, even with Ginny practically pouring it out the window on her trips. A lot of my money is invested in good, solid businesses that are making more money. Let me use it to help you."
"I go wherever I please!" Hermione told him with no warmth. "I am a woman and an individual. I don't need any man to tell me where I can and can't go, or what I can and can't do! These past years I've never stood up for myself, now I do. If I have to make an enemy of you because of it, then so be it!"
"What's that?" a woman asked.
Harry returned the kiss, spurred on by what they were going to do. The thought excited him beyond measure, but also frightened him a little. However, he trusted Draco's experience to lead him.
"Harry, you know I don't have any money."
"When did you learn that?" Harry wondered out loud. It wasn't a common language to study.
In his room, he again faced the dilemma of what to wear. He had taken the matter under consideration days before. It was very uncharacteristic of him, but he was going to stand beside Draco and all the impeccably dressed Dark families, so he didn't want to look like the poor orphan among them. That brought unpleasant memories back of the time when he was indeed the poor orphan. He selected forest green robes that complemented his eyes. He thought Draco would appreciate that since it was his house colour. He was already dressed by the time Ginny exited the bathroom in a cloud of expensive perfume that always made him cough.
"Oh yes, lots. Hildegard got a great champagne. I do love the idea of dressing you as Dumbledore," he remarked.
That strength did help him just two hours later when they broke for lunch. Harry avoided looking at Arthur and towards the audience. However, when they had to leave the chamber he could no longer avoid them, nor the press. There was a rule against reporters jumping on him in the hall, but outside they could do as they wished. He walked out the great doors with Draco, who didn't leave his side even as he was bombarded with questions.
"It is hard, but I try to stay away from her. Luckily, she was placed in the guest wing, which is as far away from mine as possible. She's Draco's pet project, apparently. He picked out her dress and everything. I really try not to meddle into his political affairs, but it is stressing to even know the woman is under my roof." Harry wrinkled his nose in disgust. Apparently, Draco's wife didn't share his views.
"A potion?" Hermione was startled.
Harry's utensils fell on his plate in a riot of noise. He stared at her with his mouth agape and she just looked down at her plate. He couldn't believe his ears.
"Wish they would restore it," Harry remarked, and Draco nodded. "So, where are we going now?" he asked. They had spent the whole day exploring the ruins, and night was fast approaching. It had been a good idea that they packed sandwiches for lunch, but it was getting colder, and Harry just wanted a warm place to rest, and some warm food to eat.
On the shelves many dragons stood. Some moved, some didn't as was indicated on their packaging and they ranged in size. The really large ones were on the ground though. One was about as big as Lily and Harry had a vision of that dragon taking up residence in her bed and her sleeping snuggled up to it. The thing was mostly green, with blue eyes and yellow stripes on its tail. He was sure he had found a great present and motioned for a shopkeeper.
"Do you need help, Harry?"
Draco sat next to Harry, and placed a small stack of papers in front of him.
"Yes. Look, Ginny, I don't want to complicate this," he began, trying, but failing to keep the pleading from his voice. "I just want this divorce quickly over and done with. You can have the house and the money I wrote on the proposition. All I want is to have custody of the children. It has been me who was with them more. You can just go and maybe live in Thailand."
"You got something."
"Harry, I couldn't find your trunk and your clothes were filthy. I found you some robes that are a bit bigger and may fit you,' Draco instructed as he went to execute his own morning ritual.
"All right, Hermione, I'll try." Harry gave up fighting her.
As they ate, Harry got up to refill his plate. He spotted the orange juice he had bought the day before and taking out two glasses, filled them with the drink. He took it to the table and put one in front of Draco. He sat down and turned to his blond lover.
“Well, it means that I like Draco a lot, and want to give him many kisses.”
“Yay!” she shouted, and rushed to her father, clutching his leg.
"I liked it."
"You could always take back your Wizengamot seats!"
Harry felt like he stood under a cold shower. His law-it backfired on him. A month before he could have just thrown the lying bitch on the streets. Now he was facing a court battle that would probably make all the major publication in Wizarding UK. He turned on his heel and ran out. He didn't stop. He ran down the brightly lit streets, music and the sound of people having fun a cacophony of sounds in his head. He was crying, his vision blurry, bumping into people, but he just ran until he could run no more. He stopped, leaning down and breathing heavily. It was over. His marriage was all over and if he couldn't convince a judge that he should raise his children, then they were gone too. His whole life just broke apart in front of him.
Harry blushed at how obvious he had been.
"Actually, his name is Albus Severus. I named him after the two greatest headmasters Hogwarts has ever known," he clarified.
"I'm really not interested in that, but if you take me here, I'll give you money."
Harry fought down his nervousness and attempted to concentrate on the gorgeous body under him. Draco was pale as moonlight, white creamy skin glistening in the candlelight. He was mostly hairless, whether naturally so or artificially, Harry couldn't tell. He was looking at Harry with an eager smile on his face, eyes shining with anticipation.
He still had the feeling that he had forgotten an important piece of his past. He followed the feeling and found himself sitting in the living room in the Burrow. Ginny was beside him and he had his arms around her as she leaned into him. Bill and Fleur were also in front of him in a similar position, but they kept glancing at each other even as they talked. Their eyes. They bothered him. He couldn't name what it was exactly at first, but then he realised that it was true love. They seemed to shine with an inner light. He looked down at Ginny and he couldn't see it. Then he thought of himself and he couldn't feel it. Not that love.
"It wasn't my idea, but I suppose you're right. However, that man, Adrian, you said, is gay."
"Don't frown, Potter. I know you didn't know about your seats, but I still can't help my frustration over that. You have no idea how much pain Weasley has been giving me over the years," he said, misinterpreting the other man's expression. Harry was silently glad for that.
"Harry, when did you start that special diet with Hermione?"
I know that Ron seems weird at this point, but I have a reason for that. Also, remember that this is 14 years after the end of Book 7 before the Epilogue and a lot has changed since then.
Chuckling lightly, Draco freed Harry's legs and he tumbled down to the floor. He slowly got up and sat back on the bed. Malfoy handed him the potion and he gratefully gulped it down. In a second, his headache was a thing of the past and he sighed in relief.
"That Malfoy turned out to be such a great man."
"I don't drink it, so I wouldn't know." Harry shrugged. "So, you said you wanted to bring about educational reform. Why are the Light Families against it and the Dark Families for it? I would think that it would be the Dark Families that would be against Muggle-borns integrating." He leaned in towards Malfoy, giving him his full, undivided attention. The other man looked down at the empty glass, collecting his thoughts for a moment.
"Don't you just want to try something different from time to time?"
"With a majority of one, the law passes. Congratulations to Mr Potter on putting his first proposal through," said the Chief and the Dark side clapped.
"You choose." Harry wasn't all that interested as long as he got something.
The boy shook his head.
He arrived to the Floo office in Patong, Thailand. The room where his seat jumped out of the Floo, after about half an hour of dizzying ride, was hot but not very humid. Coming from the cold winter it was a shock to his system, even though he had prepared by dressing in tropical clothing. He just had a loose shirt, shorts, and sandals on. His luggage was in his pocket, the big trunk shrunk down as much as he could manage.
"Did we ... do something?"
“Your mother and I haven’t been getting along as we should. She had been going away a lot, and it just doesn’t feel like we’re really married anymore.” Harry tried to explain without including what he had seen in Thailand.
They left the ancient ruins behind, and entered the zigzags of the city in a taxi. Harry thought that the following day they could spend exploring the modern side of the city. They soon arrived to a very large square.
"Well, I'd better be going." Draco put down his cup and stood to leave. "You can stay and talk some more if you want, Harry. Goodbye and see you later." He walked out the room, probably on his way to change as well.
"I think this is the nicest Arch of all of them," Harry said, looking at the lavish decorations. He especially liked the men in togas.
The Halloween ball was held at the home of the Minister for Magic, Hildegard Noble. She was a Muggle-born who had quickly risen in the anti-pureblood climate that characterised the decade after the Second Voldemort War. The home itself had once belonged to a pureblood family whose name Harry could not recall.
Harry hated to break up their fun, but it was almost tea time and they really needed to get back home. James spotted him first and got off the trampoline. Narcissa also stopped the swing and Lucius rose from his seat. Harry stepped to the threesome in heavy discussion and told the boys to say their goodbyes. The Potter family was sad to leave Malfoy Manor, but they all Floed home eventually.
“That’s not easily done.” He shook his head at the crazy notion. “Ever since the end of the war the Dark Families, well, what remained of them anyway, have been trying to bring about changes in many laws. We have realised that brute force will not save our culture from Muggles, so now we are trying to change the education system in order to better integrate the Muggle-borns into our culture. It’s my project, but I’m not getting anywhere with it. The Light Families are in majority and they are opposed to any sort of change. They claim that things are fine the way they are.”
"We don't even know who it is yet,” he reminded the hot-head and glanced back at another set of data in front of him. ‘It could be a woman,’ he thought, considering the shoe prints found at the scene.
"Are we landing on water?"
"There used to be a lot more Malfoys. They have a tapestry room just like the Blacks but in a better condition. I studied it a bit and had Lucius tell me about the family history. He doesn't have a lot to do, so we talk sometimes. It's strange how many mutual interests we have." Her voice trailed off and Harry wondered about how strange that statement would have sounded a year before. "He's great at story-telling. He explained that there were times when 20 or even more people would live in the Manor. I think he sometimes wishes the family were that big again."
"So, what did I miss?" she inquired as she looked at the two boys in front of her. Harry found himself blushing, but he didn't know why.
He leaned down to kiss Draco. It was sloppy and full of desire, but being inside his boyfriend on both ends felt incredible. He then stayed on top of him, just rocking his hips slowly, wanting the experience to last. However, he couldn't keep up the languid pace for long, and soon found himself grasping Draco's raised knees as he slammed into him. He was slightly afraid of hurting the blond, but he would have complained if he did. Instead, Draco just kept on moaning and urging him in a breathless voice to go deeper, harder, enjoying the slightly rough treatment. Harry filed away that knowledge to future use. Soon though, his mind was completely focused on his task, and he felt his orgasm approaching. He grasped the cock before him, forcing his own tide back, wanting to make Draco come first. He didn't have to pump the shaft for long, and Draco was soon shouting under him, coating his hand with his fluid. Harry felt the muscles that surrounded his own cock contract, and let himself go, let the tide overtake him with all of its force. He moaned long as he pumped all his come into the hole, only pulling out once he was all done.
“What if we changed the law?” Hermione asked. Harry almost smiled; his best friend was still the revolutionary that she had been in school.
* * *
“That is correct,” she said.
“Are you sure they are both the Weasel’s?”
Harry sat at the head of the table having breakfast and looked down at his wife. He had spent more time with her than ever before during their marriage. He had completely quit the Aurors and didn't miss it at all but was busier than ever. Instead of a regular job, he went around the Wizengamot members and courted them, just like Draco told him to. He had become a politician. It wasn't his chosen profession and he sincerely hoped he didn't have to do it all his life. Ginny was always by his side and he didn't even have to ask her. She enjoyed all the gatherings and dinners, which made her the perfect companion for his new job. Harry made sure that the men he meet saw him guide her at all times, asserting his authority. He didn't take pleasure in any of it one bit, but he was getting better at pretending he did.
Harry grinned at that. A part of him was so happy that the gorgeous man just wanted to be with him.
The children looked at him quizzically.
"Help her?" Greer interrupted Harry. "Why would you do that? Potter, have  you not studied Wizarding Law any more extensively than what was in your  training?" he questioned the young man in front of him, who just shook his  head. Greer frowned at his response. "Potter, it is the responsibility of an  Auror to be fully aware of the law and its intent as well. It states that a  wife wanting to divorce her husband can be made to leave his property as  soon as her intent is made known towards her spouse."
"Agenda number thirteen," the scribe read out. "Mr Malfoy's and Mr Potter's proposal for reforming Family law in the Wizarding world. This mainly includes rights of the wife in a marriage and the allocation of children upon the occasion of a divorce."
redhead stepped through, he was prepared.
Harry arrived in front of great iron gates that seemed to sparkle in the sunlight. Both wings had an ornate letter "M" boldly standing out amidst the twisting metal that composed them. He admired their beauty for a moment and then without taking his cloak off, he passed through the gates. They did not open, but just as Draco promised, he was keyed into the wards and could enter unhindered. The walk to the actual house took a lot longer than he remembered and was a lot more pleasant. He repressed a shudder as old memories threatened to haunt him and fought them off with the present sight. It was a clear day, the sun shined on him with the last warmth of Indian summer as he walked down the path that led to the great Manor. On both sides trees lined the way and he recalled there being a hedge before, but now it was gone. Deer and birds sometimes poked their heads out from the leaves and gazed curiously at him, even though he didn't take off his invisibility cloak till he could no longer make out the gates in the distance. The trees themselves were a myriad of colours: greens, yellows, reds, browns adorned them signalling the best days of autumn.
“No, Potter,” he said, bringing an end to the dark-haired man’s good mood. “It’s not that simple. Weasley has the votes and you can’t just take them back whenever you want to. He was given the votes because you were unfit as a minor. Of course, it was Dumbledore, the Chief Warlock, who appointed him as the guardian of your votes.” He paused a bit, considering his next words. Harry got the sense that Malfoy wanted to remark on that piece of the past, but eventually decided not to. “Since you never claimed them, you still have to prove that you are fit to hold the positions. Only the others can vote you back in. So you would need to convince the Light Families that you’re on their side, while also giving a reasonable explanation why you would like to have the votes now. If they know you want to change a law, they’ll never side with you. Although, in order to actually change the law, you would need the support of one side.”
"I know I'm a man." He smiled.
"Good morning to you as well, Scorpius, and a Merry Christmas."
In the evening the next day, the whole family was sitting down to eat a delicious meal. Harry looked around in happiness, and briefly wondered what a turn his life had taken. Then suddenly, a house-elf popped into existence beside him.
Ron visibly swallowed, and his air of confidence was diminishing right in front of their eyes.
The pool room was a lot like the greenhouses he had previously visited. The ground wasn't stone or wood but actual warm sand. It wasn't as white as in Thailand but rather beige. There were palm trees surrounding a large pool that apparently got deeper the further someone went in from the entrance. The pool itself was tiled with blue tiles that had the pattern of waves on them. Harry also spotted a large Jacuzzi off to the side. His children along with Hermione and Scorpius were playing in the shallower part of the pool, throwing a beach ball around. Harry laughed as Lily squealed when her ball went so high, Scorpius had a hard time catching it. Hermione spotted Harry first, as she was standing in the deepest part and was facing the entrance.
"Maybe my divorce made her realise that she should put more effort into her marriage. Maybe, she's afraid of losing you," she suggested.
Then Ron frowned at him in disbelief.
"You have to figure it out."
"All right, Malfoy. I understand. So, I need to get their vote. How do I make my intentions known and start the process?"
"Are you going to get a divorce now?" Lucius asked.
"Believe me, I can't do more than pull you off at the moment." He reached down and took the darker cock into his hand.
"Hello, handsome." He fluttered his painted eyelashes in a coy manner. Harry supposed that it wasn't the best come-on, but if someone was as pretty as that boy, he probably didn't need much.
"Why are you making such a fuss over your appearance anyway? It's so unlike you," Harry noted.
"What are you doing here with that man?" He came out with the question right away as he had no time to waste.
autumn and moved to a new house."
"I like how you taste, Harry."
He heard footsteps and turned to see Draco walking towards him. He sat down next to his head and put a hand on his shoulder as Harry made to get up.
Harry first visited the bathroom, as it had been a while and he had to toast a couple of times with his champagne to the Wizengamot. He gaped at the gold faucets he had found and remembered the elegant white ceramic ones at Malfoy Manor. He always held a sort of fascination of bathrooms, probably because so many things had happened in the ones at Hogwarts. Therefore, he often only remembered the bathrooms of some of the places he had visited and couldn't recall much of the other rooms.
The next day found Harry and Hermione sitting in the Leaky Cauldron again. They had previously decided that it was the perfect venue for their big row. Malfoy had carefully constructed just what they should say. They had to script the entire conversation, not only the most public part, just in case someone was near enough to overhear everything. As Harry was not good at remembering things verbatim, he was just given a general outline as to what he should say. Still, it was with a heavy heart that he prepared for it and only his Gryffindor courage kept him from bolting. He just hated what he was about to do.
"So what of Hermione, then? I can't be seen giving money to her, or anything, if I'm supporting her return to her husband," he asked, genuinely worried for his friend.
Harry groaned. After two months of not seeing each other, she finally came  back and that was what she opened with.
He entered the office and noticed Ron sitting in one of the chairs in front  of the desk. Greer Stewart, Head of the Auror Department, was an imposing  figure with his flaming red hair, light-green eyes and not to mention his  build. The budget didn't allow for large desks and his was as small as any  of the desks outside. Therefore, his already bulky Scottish form was made  larger in contrast. He was currently looking with a frown at Ron, who was  apparently trying to appear brave in spite of the stare. Harry admitted that  it must have been a difficult thing to do. In his Auror days Greer had been  known as a fierce interrogator. All they had to do was put him in a room  with a suspect and without saying a word, he would have the guy spilling his  guts out in thirty minutes. Harry quickly sat in the other chair, hoping  that the stare would not be directed at him as well.
“Let’s not be hasty,” Weasley inserted.
“Why don’t you come and find out, Malfoy?” He asked as he turned and lay back against the pillows.
“Why do you get to cast the spell?” Harry objected.
“Well don’t rush to stand up,” Hermione said firmly.
Harry skimmed his hands down caressing Draco’s inner thighs.  Draco whimpered and squirmed in response.   He slid his hands behind Draco’s knees and pushed them up and back, exposing all of him to Harry’s gaze.  Harry looked back up and got caught in stormy grey eyes.  He saw want and desire, but also uncertainty.  He was conscious that although he and Draco had had sex hundreds of times, this man lying beneath him, had never done this before.  He was determined that Draco would feel nothing but pleasure at his hands.  Maintaining eye contact, Harry said softly, “If you want to stop at any time . . . just let me know.”  Draco started shaking his head no but Harry continued, “I know this is new for you.  It’s ok if you change your mind, baby.”
“Why don’t we all sit and talk?” Thropwaite said, gesturing to the chairs clustered at the front of the classroom.
“You do realize I was pretty much raised by House Elves, don’t you Potter?” Draco Drawled.  “I would stake my life on the fact that neither Lucious nor Narcissa ever changed a nappy, wouldn’t you?”  That mental image succeeded in cracking them both up.
Harry wanted to tangle his fingers in the hair at Draco’s nape, but it still hurt too much to move, so he tried to put all of his emotion into kissing Draco back.  He parted his lips, and let his tongue dart out to lick Draco’s lower lip.  Draco made a soft sound and opened his mouth.  Harry pushed his tongue in to rub against his.
The rest of the day passed normally, or what passed for normal since the curse.  They ate their meals together at the end of one of the house tables.  In fact all of the eighth years had started sitting at different tables for each meal.  This new habit had rubbed off on the lower year students and many of them had also taken to sitting at the tables of different houses.  So Harry and Malfoy ended up sitting at the end of whatever table was convenient.  Most of the time they were joined by Ron, Hermione, Blaise and Pansy.  Their four friends formed a formidable wall of protection against the curious and overly nosy.
Harry assessed the situation before he opened his eyes.  He was lying in a bed, with stiff sheets.  He could hear the sounds of magic humming around him, and could smell the distinct scent of “Scourgify” and lavender that always seemed to permeate St. Mungo's.  He slowly opened his eyes and found Draco slumped, asleep in a chair next to his hospital bed.  He looked a mess.  His face which he normally kept clean-shaven, was rough with at least two days of stubble.  His hair was lank and disheveled.  And there were deep purple circles under his eyes.
Harry knew his mouth had fallen open in confusion, but Draco was still covering his eyes so it didn’t really matter.  He sat up and scrubbed both his hands through his hair in frustration.  “What the hell, Draco?  That makes no sense.  You wanted to stay . . . so you left me every night?”
Now Harry was stuck in this fucking trap and he would never be able to make it right with Draco.  Harry cast another “Lumos” to check and see if anything had changed, but it hadn’t.  He shouldn’t have given up.  He should have fought for their love.  All of the amazing moments of their lives kept replaying in his head.  Harry was too drained to cry anymore, otherwise, he would be bawling.  Instead, he slumped against a wall and waited for either salvation or damnation.
“Whah?”  Harry’s head was spinning so he leaned over onto Malfoy.  “You’re nah weak! You . . . you’re . . . so strong.”  Harry reached over and squeezed Malfoy’s bicep, “See?  Strong!”
Harry got to his feet too.  “I am serious, Draco,” he said the laughter draining from his voice.  “I had lost my memory.  I’m sure you’ll appreciate the irony of that.  And, well, you pretended to be my boyfriend.”
“No,” Potter grimaced, “Well… not really. I mean… it wasn’t like that…”
Draco lifted a wine bottle and gestured toward Harry, “Wine, Potter?  Or would you prefer pumpkin juice?” Draco added sarcastically.
Harry moved his right hand to rest on his stomach and held his breath again.  Was he really going to do this?  Right next to Malfoy?  His cock twitched again, and Harry slowly slid his hand down his stomach, pausing at the elastic waistband of his pajama bottoms.  Harry bit down on his lower lips as he eased his fingers under the waistband.  His free hand flew up to his mouth to silence the groan he made when his fingers finally closed around his hard dick.
“No, no… of course not.” Voldemort made a dismissive gesture. “That is not… possible.” He steepled his hands against his forehead appearing to be in great thought. “Ah yes!” A delighted smile crept over his hideous face. “I have it. I will require a sacrifice.” He folded his arms and looked both men over.
While Draco went to get the baby, Harry hurried around to gather the things he thought they would need.  When Draco returned with Atria Lily he found a quilt spread out in the dappled shade.  The wireless was brought outside and playing some soft music.  A small basket of baby toys was on the corner.  There was a platter of cheese, crusty bread, sliced apples and grapes all under a stasis charm.  And a chilled bottle of champagne rested in a silver ice bucket.
Harry took his index finger and gently traced the curves of Draco’s lips.  He paused with his finger resting on Draco’s lower lip.  “Yes, what?  What do you want me to do?”
“What is the meaning of this, Potter?  You can’t just barge in here without permission!” Draco shouted.  His face was white and he slowly lowered the wand he had tightly clutched in his hand.
Harry turned caught up in the joy of the moment and leaned forward to press their lips together.  He felt Draco stiffen for a moment before relaxing and open his mouth to him.  Harry cupped the back of Draco’s head with his free hand and slid his tongue in.  Al squirmed as if wanting her fathers’ attention all back on her, and they broke the kiss with a gasp.
“I can’t have a husband who won’t . . . who doesn’t want to be with me,” Harry wearily replied.  “I think we should  . . . separate.”  His heart was screaming at him to stop talking, but his mouth continued, “We can share custody of Al.”
“I’ve got you!  Baby, I’ve got you!  It’s ok,” he gave Draco a hard kiss, teasing with his lips and tongue.  Harry pulled away from the kiss and sat up, quickly shucking his shirt and pajama bottoms.  Then he pulled Draco’s shirt off him while he was still lying there looking stunned.  Before Draco could blink, Harry was back in his arms.  Harry growled as he felt his husband pressed against him at last.  The feeling of skin against skin was exquisite.  He rocked his body against Draco’s feeling the rasp of his nipples against Draco’s chest hair, knowing that Draco was feeling the same sensations.
“Good,” Bill said.  “See if you can make it to the main corridor?  And then come back.”
When he finally felt he could move, Harry cast a cleaning charm over both of them and turned on his side to face Draco.  Draco turned to face him too, and Harry reached out and used one finger to tenderly trace the features of his face; his pale eyebrow, his sharp cheekbone, his still pointy nose, the bow of his kiss-swollen lips.  Draco reached out a hand to cup Harry’s cheek, gently caressing him with his thumb.  “I love you,” Harry whispered, their gazes locked.
“Yes, bloody Merlin, yes, alright!” Draco shouted back.
Draco hoped to put an end to this nonsense. “Pansy, I dare you to not take a single drink until the end of this game.”
And then there was the kiss.  It had started innocently enough, a game of Truth or Dare enhanced with revealing charms that turned your hands red if you lied.  It had been the usual silly questions and dares until Michael Corner asked Blaise if he liked girls or boys.
Even though he was tempted to accept this brush off and move on to the kissing plan, Harry knew this was an important moment in trying to repair their marriage.  “That’s not good enough, Draco.  I think you owe me more of an explanation than that.  You didn’t want to stay with me . . . and now you do.  What changed?”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, puzzled by the comment.
He had stood in his walk-in closet for over an hour trying to decide what to wear.  Being married to Draco had improved the majority of his wardrobe but had done nothing for his innate lack of fashion sense.  Without Draco there to guide him, Harry had no idea what went with what and so he had fallen back on his default outfit of jeans, a t-shirt, and trainers.  Albeit, they were all of a much higher quality than he had worn prior to becoming involved with Draco.  Now he was regretting his choice and wondered if he should have dressed up more, to try and impress Draco.  “Fuck that,” he told himself, “Draco had fallen in love with me when I dressed worse than this.”
“Wait, Harry!  You can’t just . . .” Malfoy held up both hands like he was shielding himself from Harry.
“No, no, no,” Harry rushed.  “Unless . . . er, unless you still want to?”
“I did no such thing!” Malfoy fired back.  “You are the one who reached for my hand while I was still casting.”
“Just give us another minute.  He just regained consciousness,” Healer Wilcox, waved vaguely over to the side of the room where Draco was waiting with his arms wrapped tightly around himself.
He moved through his days as if in a trance.  His attention split between watching Draco and cataloging all of his memories with the other man.  His grades were dropping and he was losing weight, but he couldn’t care less.  Draco never even so much as glanced at Harry, much less had any kind of interaction with him.  It was clear that he just wanted to put the whole bonding behind him.  Harry wished that he could too, but even though they were no longer bonded, every particle in his body screamed out for Draco Malfoy.
PS here's a little smut for my anniversary ;)
“No that’s ok, you two are bonding,” Harry tried to keep a straight face as he moved to sit across from Draco.
“I do have some good news though,” Bill said brightly, trying to lift their spirits.  “I have developed the counter-curse and I will be able to sever the bond.”  He smiled and looked very pleased with himself.
Draco frowned and tensed, leaning forward, “Don’t leave me, Harry.”  His voice was barely more than a whisper but filled with desperation.
Harry gathered him up in his arms and pulled him into a tight hug.  “You need to let go, Draco, and trust me.  Trust me not to hurt you,” Harry whispered in his ear.  Draco’s arms came around him.  His hands bunched up the soft cotton of Harry’s t-shirt and he held him tightly.
, and right before he fell asleep Harry felt lips brush his forehead.
“No problem.  I’m on it,” Ron tossed over his shoulder as he left the room.  The healers left after him, deciding not to argue with Harry.
Draco leaned forward, intent on what Harry was doing.
“I fucking love you, Draco,” Harry whispered bringing their lips together for a slow deep kiss, filled with love and promises and the future.
Draco resolutely would not let himself think about the invitations. The three invitations that had each arrived eight weeks apart over the last six months. The invitations where Potter had asked him out for dinner… in what Draco could only assume was some sort of twisted Gryffindor ideal around reconciliation. Invitations that Draco had immediately incinerated, a hedge against the possibility of finding himself tucking them into some ridiculous spot such as his journal or under his pillow. Draco had refused to acknowledge the existence of the invitations, choosing to believe they had never existed at all. And since Potter never mentioned them either you would think that it would be an easy feat to accomplish—you would be wrong. No one else but Draco needed to know how difficult it was for him to keep his breathing steady and heartbeat from racing when Potter was in the same room. And now his house-elf was suggesting he contact Potter with his problem. Impossible.
The relief that began building when Draco started to speak, suddenly came crashing through his body and he couldn’t stop himself from grabbing Draco and pulling him into his arms.  Without finesse, Harry slammed his mouth against Draco’s.  His desperation, yearning, and love all came pouring out in his kiss.  He had one hand tangled in Draco’s hair and the other wrapped tightly around his waist, not letting the other man move even an inch away.
“Muggles have these things called baby monitors, that let them listen to their babies from another room.  Hermione created a charm for the same purpose.  It will vibrate when the baby wakes up and it will start to chime if she is crying.  It will get louder as she does.”  Harry held out his hand expectantly.  Draco reluctantly handed over his wand, and Harry charmed it and handed it back.  “You will be on the first shift.  She wakes, every three hours.”
When he saw the circle of students sitting on the floor, the dread made its way through his alcohol-soaked brain.  “No,” he whispered in horror.
Robards gave up on keeping Harry calm, “He’s at St. Mungo’s.”  The words were barely out of his mouth before Harry was striding out of the office and down the corridor, Ron jogging to keep up with him.
Apparently kissing Harry was no big deal because it had been over a week and Malfoy had said nothing to Harry.  In fact his behavior hadn’t changed one bit.  He was polite in DADA, and they continued to study together in the library.  It was as if the kiss had never happened.  Only the persistent tingling of Harry’s lips whenever he looked in Malfoy’s direction convinced him that he hadn’t imagined the whole thing.
Conversation over, they both crossed back to where Draco was sitting at the large table where they had spread out all the books they thought might help. Granger looked unhappy but Potter flashed him a small smile, and that worried Draco more than Granger’s unhappiness. “Since Harry is determined to go through with this mad scheme”—Granger reached over and squeezed Potter’s hand—“then I think I may have found a way.”
Harry reached down and gave his own cock a squeeze, willing himself not to come just from the decadent site in front of him.  Then he used his hands to spread Draco’s ass cheeks and lowered his mouth.  “Harr-aarghh!” Draco cried out at the first touch of Harry’s warm wet tongue.  “Aaaah!  Aaargh!” he cried out as Harry’s tongue swept across his pucker.  “Oh, please!  Oh, please!” Draco turned to mindless begging as Harry stiffened his tongue and pushed it inside him.  Draco babbled a stream of nonsense as Harry thoroughly fucked him with his tongue.
“How . . . er, how would we know?” Harry asked quietly.
“Thanks,” Harry said, still not turning around to look at Malfoy because he was too afraid of what he might see in his face.  He heard the other boy move over to his wardrobe and felt the familiar tug in his midsection that always preceded the pain when they moved too far apart.  Harry debated whether he could get away with getting out on his side of the bed, or if the pain would be too severe.
Harry frowned and asked, “What does that mean?”
“Look!  I don’t know all the details.  I just know that they told me they get paid.  There must be some sort of house elf employment bureau.  Surely an important Auror, like yourself, would be able to find out the details.  Otherwise, we are leaving here and returning to the hotel!  Where there are actual house elves!” Draco crossed his arms over his chest to punctuate his declaration.
A half sob half laugh came out of Harry’s mouth as squeezed Draco tightly, “Thank Merlin!”  Relief and happiness shot through every atom of his being.  He moved his mouth back to Draco’s and poured all the love he had into his kiss.  Sipping and licking and sucking.  Lips clinging, tongues searching, they kissed and kissed.
“Alright,” Draco nodded back. Just what Harry had meant would have to wait to be a topic for once they were back home.
They sat in silence, each man caught up in his own thoughts until Draco spoke again, “Then how did we . . . I mean, how are we . . .” Draco
“I haven’t forgotten.  We can just shower together,” Harry said calmly.
Harry pulled away before he could come.  He kissed a path down Draco’s chest, stopping at a nipple to lick and suck until he had him crying out.  Then he continued kissing and nibbling, following the trail of soft golden hair that led down to the waistband of the pajama pants Draco was still wearing.  When he reached the elastic, he licked along the edge purposely avoiding where Draco’s hard prick was almost pushing free.
Harry left the steamy bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist.  His clothes were so disgusting that he had just used an Incindio on them.  Now he poked around Draco’s bedroom, looking at his clothes.  He had worn some of Draco’s clothes before.  Draco was taller and more slender, but Harry could use magic to make any adjustments he needed.  In amongst the wizarding robes, Harry found some muggle trousers and shirts.  He chose a pair of plain grey trousers that he thought he could pull off, and a shirt patterned in grey, lilac, and blue that was made out of the softest material Harry had ever felt.  He found Draco’s underwear drawer and pulled on a pair of black boxer shorts.  A wave of desire washed over him as he pictured Draco wearing nothing but this pair of pants.  He pushed those thoughts aside and finished dressing, adjust the clothes to fit his frame.  He had no choice but to put back on his old trainers, all of Draco’s shoes looked too uncomfortable, and if he looked foolish – so be it.
Harry moved down Draco’s body until he was face to face with his cloth covered prick.  He rubbed his face along the hardened length.  He grabbed Draco’s hips and forced him to stay still when he tried to push into Harry’s touch.  Draco moaned loudly when Harry turned his head, opened his mouth and started sucking on his cock right through the fabric of his trousers.  He raised his head and smiled up at Draco, “You look so fucking good!” He released Draco’s hips and unfastened his trousers, dropping kisses along the elastic waistband of his pants and mouthing at the cotton covering his cock.
“How are you both feeling this morning?” Dumbledore asked them.  They both muttered quick and insincere assurances that they were fine.  “Mr. Weasley should arrive sometime this morning and he will get right to work solving this curse.  But in the meantime we have made some arrangements to help ease the situation,” Dumbledore paused briefly and then continued, “We have moved Mr. Thomas and Mr. Hopkins into your dormitories’, leaving the one they occupied free for the two of you.  Your belongings have already been moved there for you.”  Dumbledore paused again, longer this time, to let this news sink in.
“I’m not the one who botched the spell in the first place!” Harry shot back.
“What the hell, Potter?  You’re making no sense!”  Draco said angrily.
Draco turned to leave, but Harry hurriedly spoke up,” Don’t, don’t go.  It’s ok.  What . . . er, what did you want?”
They stared at each other for a long, intense moment.  Lust flared in both green and grey eyes.  Draco broke the stare, rolling over and grasping the waistband of Harry’s pajamas.  He lowered his head and trailed the tips of his hair along the bare skin that he exposed inch by inch.  Harry moaned and twisted beneath the silky strands.  Draco pulled the clothing all the way off, crawled back up his body, and knelt over Harry.  He held out his hand for Harry to cast a wandless lube charm, and then used that to slick up Harry’s cock.
“Hey Hilly, is everything ok?” Harry asked, still struggling to calm his racing heart.
“No.  I’m sorry, Harry,” Narcissa reached out and grabbed his hands.  “Please don’t give up on him!  He was so happy with you, and about the baby-“ her voice broke.  “Don’t give up, Harry.  He just needs time,” she pleaded.
“Oh!” Harry parted his lips and Draco’s tongue slipped inside, twisting and tangling with his own.  His hands slid over the warm, wet skin of Draco’s back and stopped on the firm slopes of his arse.  He pulled Draco closer and rocked his hips causing his dick to rub against Draco.  Pleasure spiked through Harry.  He pulled his mouth away from Draco’s and tried in vain to catch his breath.  “Feels so good,” he panted against Draco’s mouth.
New Chapter, as promised  ;)
Harry made a face at Draco, only just stopping himself from sticking his tongue out at the other boy.  He pushed up on his elbows and the blanket fell back to reveal his bare chest.  “Aaah!  Where are my clothes?” Harry looked at Draco accusingly, sure he must have had something to do with their disappearance.  To his consternation, Draco started laughing.  “What? What’s so funny?” Harry demanded.
Harry wordlessly conjured some lube and spread it all over his aching cock.  He wrapped his right hand around his cock and stroked, twisting his hand when he reached the head and then stroking back down.  He used his left hand to stroke his chest and pinch his nipples.  “Oh!  Fuck!  Fuck!” Harry gasped.
Harry got his trousers unfastened and pulled them down his legs.  That was so much better.  He threw them over the side of the bed too.  He looked over at Malfoy, he didn’t look so good.  His face was flushed and his mouth was open, and it looked like he was having trouble breathing. “Draco?  Are you okay?” Harry leaned closer to peer into Malfoy’s eyes.
It was late afternoon when Draco woke up. He showered and dressed before making his way to check on his mother. He nodded to the house-elf who was sitting nearby and then moved to her bedside. There was no change. She was still in the heavy drugged sleep from the Healer’s potion. He touched her pale cheek softly before turning back to the house-elf. “Notify me immediately if there is any change,” he directed.
“Draco! Don’t make me slap you again,” Granger shouted at him.
“Harry, no!” Draco protested, grabbing Harry’s arm and pulling him around to face him. Panic and dread, filled Draco. “You can’t do this! It’s too much! There has to be another way!” He couldn’t save his mother only to lose Harry.
Thropwaite responded again, “We have determined that the trainer was intentionally tampered with.  We don’t yet know why or by whom.”
Harry tried to speak but the pain was too great.  Ron and Hermione dragged him back into the room to sit at a desk.  “Professor!” Ron shouted.  The pain receded slightly.
Harry was sure this must be a trick but he couldn’t really think straight.  “Er . . . yes.”  Harry kept his eyes focused firmly on the floor in front of him.  “Ron!” he picked the next victim.  “What’s the best prank you’ve played?”
Just then a piercing scream echoed down the tunnel and both men froze. Potter dropped his forehead to Draco’s shoulder and took several shaky breaths. Then tightened his hold on Draco briefly before stepping away. “We can talk about this later? Yes?” he asked.
Boom!  Harry had just walked into a trap.  Here he was trapped in a windowless, doorless room, in a house filled with dark magic.  Who knew if the other Aurors would be able to free him?  He had tried every spell and charm he could think of, but nothing had made any change to his predicament.  He should never have accepted this assignment, knowing his concentration would be shit today after the confrontation this morning.
Wanting more contact, Harry pulled Draco over on top of him and pushed at his legs until they were spread on either side of his hips.  He had arranged Draco exactly as he wanted him with his legs and arse spread, giving Harry access, and his hard dick trapped against Harry’s stomach.  Draco clutched at Harry’s shoulders and buried his face in Harry’s neck, giving him kisses and love bites.  Harry moved both hands down to Draco’s arse cheeks, stroking and squeezing them.
“Did . . . uh, did I do something wrong?” Harry asked quietly.
Draco made a high moan in the back of his throat and tilted his hips to push himself further onto Harry’s prick.  Harry took this as his cue and resumed slowly pressing into his husband.  When he was fully seated he stopped and rested, placing his weight on his elbows.  “You ok, Baby?” he asked, looking into Draco’s eyes.
Bill cleared his throat before answering, “Uh, you may, uh . . . the curse might require you to . . .”
------
Harry threw his head back, a steady stream of “fuck yes,” “don’t stop,” and “please, Draco” falling from his lips.  He thrust his hips as hard as he could, rocking into Draco’s thigh.
Harry could feel the wild beat of Draco’s heart where their chests were touching, and his hard cock was pressed into Harry’s stomach.  “No?”  Harry ventured.
He had been there for a week when it happened.  They were all in the kitchen.  Harry was cooking, Ron was keeping the kids entertained with knock-knock jokes, and Hermione was setting the table.  Hermione froze as she was reaching into the cupboard, and looked down at her shoes, where there was a small puddle forming.  “Ron!” she said insistently.  “Ron!” she repeated.
Harry reached out to stroke his cheek, but he flinched away.  “But I’m not really him am I?  I’m not the one you fell in love with.  I don’t remember any of that!  I’m the fucked up kid who listened to a homicidal maniac!”  Draco looked wildly around the room and started to get out of bed, “I should g-.”
“She’s beautiful, Harry,” Arthur said, coming over to give Harry an enthusiastic hug.
“Draco, we have to talk about this,” Harry pulled his arm away from his face and leaned over him.  His grey eyes glittering with unshed tears.  “You’re not making sense,” Harry said, struggling to understand what he was saying.  “We’re married!  I love you!  Why would you be trying to not get attached to me?”
Harry slid his hand from Draco’s mouth to his cheek and gradually turned his face toward his own.  “Open your eyes, Baby,” he urged.  Draco’s eyes fluttered open and he found himself looking into stormy grey eyes.  “Don’t be scared.  It’s just us!  And we are so good together,” Harry moved as he was talking, so he ended up lying between Draco’s legs, with his arms propped on his forearms.  His right hand carded gently through his pale blond locks.  Draco kept his eyes open this time, and Harry could see so many emotions swirling there.  Too many for him to read.  Harry glided his left hand down Draco’s arm and rested it atop his hand, which was still clutching the bedding.
I'm posting this update on the one year anniversary of my first post to AO3!  It's been an incredible year.  Thank you to all who have read my stories and to those who have given Kudos and left comments!  I appreciate all of it.  C-
Draco made a small sound in his throat.  His arms were wrapped tightly around himself as if he would fly into a million pieces if he didn’t hold it all together.
“Ministry.  Sorting through some potions that were confiscated last week.”  Draco leaned up on one elbow to look at Harry, “We could grab lunch if you want?”
Draco crawled up onto the bed next to Harry.  “Hi.” Draco gave Harry a tentative smile.
It took a long time, but the other Healers left and Wilcox called them all back over to Harry.  “There was a lot of internal damage.  Some of the spells we couldn’t do until he was awake and we could see the extent of the damage.  We think we were able to repair everything,” Wilcox said bluntly.
How Harry felt? How did he feel? Draco was feeling light-headed and he was sure his heart was about to beat right out of his chest. “How… ah, how do you feel?” Draco asked hesitantly.
Draco seemed to wilt a little and his shoulders slumped, “Mother heard your pronouncement and declared that it was time for her to return to France.  She will be returning this afternoon.”  Draco looked away from Harry and took a deep breath, “All things considered we will have much more room at Grimmauld Place, so I will move there.”  At Harry’s relieved smile, Draco hastened to add, “I don’t believe for one minute that this arrangement will be sustainable.  We will want to kill each other within days.”
Harry cleared his voice.  “Yeah, I think so,” it came out as a rough whisper but he could speak.
During the silence that greeted Harry’s revelation, the door to the hospital room swung open and Hermione walked through.  When she saw that Draco was awake and sitting up, she rushed over to his side.  “Draco!  Thank God you’re awake!” she said, throwing her arms around him and getting as close as her big belly would allow.  “The baby will be so happy to hear her Papa’s voice again!”
He would not fail her, he was not his father. Draco returned to the library and retrieved the spell he had copied. He picked it up, refusing to even look at the evil book where he had found it. He folded the parchment and put it in his pocket before heading down to the dungeons.
Draco’s smile grew wider and more tears slipped down his cheeks as the ring was placed on his finger.  He grasped Harry’s left hand and gently removed his wedding band and held it up, “With this ring, I pledge myself to you, my husband, my heart, my body and my soul,” he repeated, emotion choking his voice.  Then he slid the ring back onto Harry’s hand.  “I fucking love you too,” he whispered.
The laughter faded as Harry looked into Draco’s eyes.  He slid his left hand back to cup Draco’s neck and bring him closer.  The right hand he slipped under Draco’s shirt to caress the soft skin at his waist.  With their lips just millimeters apart, Harry waited breathing softly.  He desired Draco so badly his whole body ached, but he also needed to know that Draco wanted him back.  So he waited.
Malfoy gave a mirthless laugh. “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”
“Yeah, right!  Hermione would have a fit if I owned a house elf,” tired of standing, Harry sat down on the couch.  He winced and then removed a dirty baby bottle and a teddy bear out from underneath himself.
“Sorry,” he mumbled as he rolled over onto Malfoy’s bed and got out of bed that way.  They walked together over to the screen and then Harry went to the other side of it.  They dressed quickly, each anxious to hear what Dumbledore had to tell them.
“But . . . I, er, I wanted to talk,” Harry tried again.
Draco’s fingers joined Harry’s tracing over his cock.  Harry moaned and thrust his hips up some more.  Draco’s hand brushed away Harry’s fingers and his hand tentatively closed around Harry prick.  “Please,” he whispered, and Draco’s fingers tightened in response.  “Oh, God!  Yes, don’t stop!” Harry couldn’t stop himself from thrusting up into Draco’s tight grip.  “Please, please,” he begged mindlessly.
“I don’t know,” Draco said tiredly, “I’ll owl you.”
“Baby, slow down,” Harry seized Draco’s hands and held his wrists still.  “I want to make this good for you.”  Draco opened his mouth to object, but Harry walked him backward and pushed him down on the bed.  “Scoot up,” Harry followed him down and directed him to move up on the bed.  When they were up on the pillows, Harry covered him, letting the weight of his body press Draco down into the soft mattress.  Harry spent a few minutes giving into the pleasure of kissing his husband.  Tongues dueling, nibbling, sucking his lower lip into his mouth.  Harry pulled back to breathe and was pleased with the dazed look in the other man’s eyes.  He sat up and straddled Draco’s hips.  “Now,” he said as he took hold of Draco’s wrists again, “leave these right here until I tell you to move!”  He directed Draco’s hands to hold onto the headboard above his head.
“No, no she’s fine,” Draco said quickly, and Harry sank back down to his pillow.  “Merlin!  I’m sorry.  I don’t know what I was thinking . . . sorry I woke you.”
“Harry, what the fuck?  Get . . .” Malfoy put up his hands to push Harry away and they landed on Harry’s bare chest.  Malfoy froze with his mouth open and his hands holding onto Harry.
Harry paused to place his wand on the dresser and then removed his shirt.  “Someone told me I was overdressed.  Thought I would take care of that,” he teased.
“Harry, Mrs. Malfoy, why don’t you wait outside while I check over Draco,” began the Healer.
“I don’t believe you,” Harry said with his heart hammering in his throat.  He knew he was taking a risk by pushing Draco, but he couldn’t lose him now.
Harry leaned down and sucked on his neck while he gave in to the urge to slam his cock into Draco.  “God, Baby, I’m close!” Harry knew this was going to be over much faster than he had wished, but he also knew there was no way he could stop himself from coming inside his husband.  He reached down between them and grasped Draco’s cock with a slippery hand, squeezing and stroking him as Draco rocked his ass up to meet Harry’s thrusts.
“Oh, Baby!”  Harry placed both of his hands on Draco’s cheeks and held his face tenderly.  He rested their foreheads together.  “That is perfect!  You go get Al and I’ll grab a few more things.”
“Uh . . .” Harry looked at Draco questioningly and then down at Al, and then back at Draco.  He knew Hilly wasn’t a child even though she was small, but he wasn’t quite sure about this.
“Oi!  Harry!  Come on, get out of that bloody bed!  You need to go.  Now!” impatience rang through Ron’s voice.
“Well . . . I want us to celebrate as a family.  I want our baby girl with us,” he tried to look away again, but Harry wouldn’t let him turn his face.
While Harry was standing by Teddy, Narcissa came over to speak to him.  She gestured to Teddy and the baby, “She’s perfect, Harry.”
He could feel the hot gusts of Potters breath as he spoke. “Malfoy… what are you doing?” he whispered in confusion.
“Harry!” Ron called, drawing his attention back over to the hospital bed near where he was standing.  Hermione was wearing a different hospital gown and had blankets tucked around her.  She looked tired but she was smiling at Harry.
“A bit messy,” Draco huffed, “I shudder to think what the Gryffindor common room looked like!”
Draco didn’t get to finish because Harry grabbed a fistful of his t-shirt and hauled him backwards.  He pushed him down onto his back and then laid on top of him.  “No!  You’re not going until we talk this out.”  Draco gave a halfhearted shove at Harry’s shoulders before closing his eyes and collapsing back onto the pillows.  “I’m not leaving you,” Harry gave him a swift kiss before continuing, “Look Draco, I know you’re an arrogant asshole and I love you anyway!”  Draco’s eyes flew open but before he could interject, Harry continued, “I’m an asshole sometimes too.  And you still love me.  I don’t expect you to be perfect, Draco.  I’m under no illusions about who I married.”  Harry framed Draco’s face with his hands, bracing his elbows on the bed.  “We fit, Draco,” he said in a low urgent tone.  “Neither one of us is perfect, but we are perfect for each other.  We fit!”  Harry started sprinkling little kisses all over his face.  “So. Let. Me. Love. You . . . And let yourself love me too!”
“Er, uh sure,” Harry said. “But I don’t think they will let us go to Hogsmeade this late.”
“You would feel compelled to . . . do . . . certain acts.  And you would feel pain if you resisted the compulsion.” Bill was looking around the room refusing to meet their eyes.
Draco waved his hand to cut her off and tell her there was no need for food when Potter’s stomach let out a large rumble. “Uh, sorry. Sorry about that.” Potter ducked his head sheepishly.
His attention was drawn back to Dumbledore when he resumed speaking, “Luckily, most of your classes are already the same.  Harry, you will need to join Draco for his Arithmancy class.  And, Draco, you will join Harry when he tutors the first years in flying.”  Malfoy’s startled gaze swung over to Harry, at Dumbledore’s last statement.
“But why now?” Pansy piped up. “Why has the curse hit now? It’s been six years since Potter defeated him.”
Harry had been halfheartedly looking through a Quidditch magazine, when a slight movement from the hospital bed caught his eye.  He threw down the magazine and leaned closer, afraid his eyes were playing tricks on him.
Harry hurriedly sat down in the chair next to Draco’s.  “I wasn’t waiting for that,” he mumbled under his breath.  Once they were all seated, the food magically appeared on their plates just as it had during the feasts at Hogwarts.  He could only identify about half of the things on his plate, but he refused to let that show and gamely picked up his fork.
“No!  No that’s not . . . that’s not what happened!  Draco, I . . .” the Healer cut Harry off before he could continue.
“Like that, baby?” Harry asked huskily as he sped up his strokes.  With his free hand he had been stroking Draco’s chest and stomach, but when Draco’s hips started rocking, Harry used that hand to keep him still.
Harry found his voice first. “You will remove the curse you placed on Narcissa Malfoy!”
“What in Salazar’s name are you saying, Dilly?” Draco shouted as visions of the green-eyed, messy-haired man filled his head. He and Potter had reached a peace treaty, of sorts. Potter had testified in both his and his mother’s favor after the war. And Draco had apologized to Potter in person, resolutely not letting himself get distracted by the intensity in Potter’s eyes.
Harry’s jaw dropped along with Draco’s.  What was Ron doing?
“Don’t leave,” Draco’s voice got stronger.  “I’ll stay with you all night.  I’ll do whatever you want.”
“Kinky!” Draco smirked, “am I finally seeing the real Potter?”  He thrust his hips up and rocked Harry’s ass against his cock.  Harry smiled and leaned forward, pressing another kiss against his lips before moving off the bed entirely.  “No fun by myself,” Draco complained.  “Get back here . . .” his voice trailed off as he watched Harry start to push his shirt off, baring his well-muscled shoulders.
“Oh fuck, Harry!  Please!” Draco begged.  He tangled his fingers in Harry’s hair and tried to pull him forward.  Harry resisted the pull and toyed with his slit, flicking the tip of his tongue inside.  “Aah aah aah!” Draco wailed.
Harry pulled off and looked up at Draco.  “Do you want to come like this?” he asked breathlessly, as he continued stroking his cock.  He leaned down and licked the tip again to punctuate his question.
“Oh Sirs!” Hilly looked up at Harry and Draco with a smile on her face and tears in her eyes.  “Can Hilly be taking the Little Miss to her crib?” she looked up at them expectantly.
Draco smiled back. “I love you, Harry James Potter.”
“Well, you could use a shower too.  And, anyway, it’s just like after Quidditch,” Harry said defensively.
There were five bedrooms and a shared hall bathroom in the boys’ hallway.  Harry was rooming with Blaise and Ernie.  Ron was in with Theo and Terry.  Neville had been placed in with Draco and Michael.  Seamus, Anthony and Justin were together, and Dean and Wayne were lucky enough to only have two in their room.
Harry stood just outside of Al’s room and peeked in.  The baby was making her fussy cry.  Draco was standing with Al cradled in one arm, and a baby bottle held in the other hand.  Harry leaned on the doorframe to watch.  Draco was wearing only pajama bottoms and had their daughter cuddled against his bare chest.  He was bouncing on his toes and lightly rocking his hips.  “Come on, my little star, just try the bottle,” he coaxed.  “It’s delicious, I’m certain.”  When he placed the bottle against her lips, she turned her face away and pursed up her lips.  “OK, then,” Draco turned and set the bottle on a nearby dresser, giving Harry a view of the long line of his spine and sweet curve of his ass.
Harry was enjoying flustered Draco, this was much better than the cold angry version.  And now that he had had the idea for the shower, he couldn’t get the thought of showering with Draco out of his head.  “Look, we can face in opposite directions if you’re squeamish.”  Harry turned and started walking toward the bathroom.
Making a mockery of all of Draco’s Shielding Charms, Potter walked right up to him and grabbed the parchment out of his hand. “What’s this?!” he demanded.
Harry reached over and rested his hand on top of Draco’s.  He squeezed it slightly, “I won’t laugh Draco.  I guess that means you hadn’t had sex by sixth year?”
Draco was continuing, his voice getting lower and deeper, “Merlin!  The things you did with your tongue, Potter!”
The first attack came in a flurry of claws and fangs and leathery wings. Draco had no idea what these creatures were but that didn’t matter as he and Potter fought for their lives. They stood back to back and flung curses for what seemed like hours until finally, the attack ceased. They paused only for a quick reassurance that the other wasn’t injured before continuing on their course.
She was cut off when Harry grabbed her arm, “No, no!  I need to see him!  I have to be with him!  Please!”
“Trust me. OK?” Harry asked with a sweet smile plastered across his face.  “Thirty minutes!  Back garden!”
Draco was released from St. Mungos the next day, but he flatly refused to return to Grimmauld place with Harry.  Narcissa had decided to take a suite at the Wailing Wraith, in Diagon Ally, and have Draco stay with her.  She and Harry both had high hopes that Draco’s memories would return to him naturally.  Draco was behaving just like the teenager his memory believed him to be, alternately pouting and acting stroppy.
Draco tightened his fingers around Harry and sped up his strokes, his fingers sliding swiftly over the velvety flesh.  “Come, Potter!  Come for me,” Draco demanded in a low voice.
“Did you like touching me?  Did you like watching me come?” Harry moved closer as he spoke, so he could feel Draco’s body heat and his leg was pressed alongside the other man’s.
“That’s impossible, Potter.” Draco turned and started rummaging in his wardrobe.  “How stupid are you?  Or have you forgotten we are bonded?” Draco scoffed.
“To my sister,” Teddy corrected.
Draco’s face turned bright red and he turned and started to rush from the room.  Harry swiftly moved to block him and grabbed his arm.  “No, you need to stay here and talk to me!” Harry demanded.
Draco whipped around to face Harry so quickly he dropped the clothes he was holding.  “What?” he squawked.
Draco’s right hand was resting on top of the bed.  Harry moved his hand to cover his and groaned at the pain that shot through his body.  Draco was instantly awake.  Blinking his eyes at Harry, while he used his right hand to push the hair out of his eyes.  “Harry?” he voice sounded rough and unused.  Harry tried to push himself up, but groaned again instead and fell back on the bed.  Draco rushed over and rested his hands on Harry’s shoulders, “You shouldn’t try to move.”
“Voldemort?” Potter questioned, making Draco flinch. “But… how could he…” Puzzlement and then anger flashed across Potter’s face. Potter yanked at Draco’s hair and forced him to face him again. “Draco Malfoy?! Were you fucking trying to summon fucking Voldemort?!” Potter’s voice boomed in Draco’s ears. “Not even you could be that stupid?!”
The bed moved as Malfoy sat up and swung his feet over his side of the bed.  Harry heard him say ‘
“I just couldn’t stop thinking about . . . before,” Draco shivered and shifted on his bare feet.
“It’s no problem,” Harry said hurriedly.  He needed to get away from Draco before he did something stupid like cry all over him or try to kiss him.  “I’ll let you get settled in, while I send an owl about the house elf.”  Harry moved down the hall towards his own room. When he reached his door, he looked back and Draco was still standing where he had left him.  He looked a bit lost or maybe a little defeated.  “Thanks, Draco,” Harry called back to him, “Thanks for trying this.”  With that, Harry rushed into his room before he lost all composure.
“What’s there to talk about, Potter?” Draco asked, still trying to push by Harry.
Bill’s smile faded when he noticed neither Draco nor Harry were smiling at this news.  “Or . . . we can just leave it if you prefer?”
“Why is the room spinning?” Harry giggled.  He closed his eyes to see if it would stop but that made it worse.  He opened his eyes again and they landed on Malfoy.  His hair was mussed up and his eyes were bright.  They had both tossed off their robes a few drinks ago.  Malfoy had taken off his tie and opened the first two buttons on his shirt, Harry could see the shadow of his collarbone and he was hit with the impulse to lick all along it.
“Have a nice wank,” Harry interrupted, laughing, “yeah!”
“Not the time Ron,” Granger then turned back to Draco. “Why isn’t Harry with you? Where is he?!”
“I’m . . .”
The other thing they hadn’t done was talk.  Harry still had no idea how Draco felt.  About any of this.  Was he really interested in Harry, or was this a case of pure expediency?  Harry was there, and he conveniently liked dick.  Would any of this have happened without the curse?
“Let me find out some more information first, please, Mr. Potter,” Pomfrey replied calmly as she continued with her casting.
“Well that’s not how you get it,” Draco said bitterly.  “I think you need to leave.”
Draco rose up on his knees so he could position himself.  He held onto Harry’s cock as he started to lower himself.  Harry resisted the urge to grab onto his hips and thrust fiercely, not willing to risk hurting Draco.  Instead he endured the delicious torture of Draco slowly lowering himself - wrapping Harry’s prick, inch by inch, in tight, slick, heat.
But with Malfoy plastered to his side, he had been unable to relieve his aching cock even once.  It was Friday morning, and he had woken up with full on morning wood.  Opening his eyes to see Malfoy still sleeping didn’t help one bit.  His long lashes fanned against his cheeks and his lips were parted the tiniest bit.  He looked so soft and approachable like this.  Harry knew the softness would only last a few seconds as he awoke, and then the hard expression would come onto his face and he would be cold and remote once again.
“This isn’t right!  Try it again,” Harry complained.  Malfoy said the spell again but there was no change and the blue light remained covering them.  They had gained the professor’s attention and Harry could see he was bustling his way over to them.  Wanting to solve this before they got chewed out by the teacher, Harry acted quickly.  “Here let me try,” he said grabbing Malfoy’s wrist to get his wand.
Harry looked at the man standing so stiffly in his living room and he had to acknowledge that this man was not his husband, not in their hearts anyway.  They wouldn’t be sharing a bed again anytime in the near future.  Harry heaved himself up off the couch, “There is a guest room across from Al’s room.  You can stay there.”  Harry led the way out of the room and up the stairs, while Draco levitated his trunk behind him.
“He was angry, Draco,” Bill said gently.  “It was meant to punish you for your failure to The Dark Lord and how you helped Harry in the final battle.”
Harry was too hopeless to temper his words, “Are you even the same man who was in my bed last night?”
Other than that, it had been just the two of them.  They had ignored the knocking on their door when it came, and then ignored the giggling that followed when Harry shouted at them all to, “Go away!”
“Good night then, Potter,” Draco said somewhat formally.  Then he went back up to the guest room.
Malfoy’s free hand gripped Harry’s shoulder and he felt his hot breath across his neck.  The added sensations were enough to tip Harry over the edge and then he was coming hard, all over his hand and the inside of his pajamas.  As the aftershocks rolled through his body, he felt Malfoy shudder and moan into his neck.
“Ok,” Draco answered hesitantly, “Let’s go flying.”
“That’s to be expected.  The pain potion we gave you should be helping soon,” the Healer said confidently.
“I fucking love you so much, Draco!” Harry said roughly, squeezing his hand tightly. Harry pulled a ring from his pocket.  The platinum ring was in the shape of a snake with green eyes. Draco had taken it off when he was in the hospital and Narcissa had given it to Harry for safe keeping.  Harry had been worried about rejection, so had held off giving it back to him.  He held the ring up, “With this ring, I pledge myself to you, my husband, my heart, my body and my soul,” and slipped it onto Draco’s finger.
“You know . . . the bouncing, rocking thing . . . the noises,” Draco’s frown deepened.
Resigned to another day of Draco avoiding him, Harry headed to the study to grab a Quidditch magazine that Hilly now kept organized on their own shelf.  He was halfway into the darkened room when he realized Draco was standing over by the fireplace, with a framed photo in his hands.  It was a wizarding photo from their wedding day.  They had both been dressed in custom-made tuxedos.  Draco with a green and silver brocade waistcoat and a green bowtie, and Harry with a black on black brocade waistcoat and a green tie.  They had been so ridiculously happy that day.  They had married in the back garden here at Grimmauld Place, surrounded by their friends and family.  Harry had never seen Draco smile and laugh so much.  The photo Draco held was a candid one that had been snapped when Draco had surprised Harry from behind and spun him around and into his arms for a passionate kiss in front of everyone.  They had both pulled back from the kiss and laughed with the sheer joy of the day.  This was Harry’s most treasured photo from that day.
“Harry!  What the hell are you doing?” Malfoy sat up straight and his eyes blazed.
It had been four weeks since their bond was broken and this Friday night his friends were being even more persistent than usual.  They had routed him from the Owlry and then plied him with Firewhisky.  Now they were dragging him back to the eighth years' common room.  “I just want to sleep you guys, what’s so important?” Harry asked.
Harry had been nearly an hour late for work this morning, but his idiotic smile hadn’t left his face for hours.  It turned out he hadn’t been able to have lunch with Draco after all.  Robards had pulled Harry into a strategy meeting, and he had had to send Draco a message canceling lunch.  The other Aurors had ribbed him, pointing out what a sappy lovesick fool he was.  But he took it with good grace, knowing it was all true.  He adored his husband and couldn’t get enough of him!
“I think she likes you too, Hilly,” Draco said gently.
Before Harry could respond to that ridiculous idea, Madam Pomfrey returned and brought Harry a cup of tea too.  “Glad to see you are awake at last, Mr. Potter,” she chirped.
“Based on last night’s necessity, we have installed a double bed in that room.  We have also connected a private bathroom to the bedchamber.”  His piercing gaze fell over each boy, in turn. “It may soon be quite awkward for you to use the common bathroom.”
Pansy rushed over and gathered him in her arms. “Draco, love.”
Harry pulled his hand away from his face, “Wait.  Where?  Let me see.”
“Baby, you’re doing so well!  Be good for me and don’t let go yet,” Harry leaned down and licked the hard leaking tip of Draco’s cock just as he slid a second finger into his ass.  Leaving him a writhing moaning mess, thrusting helplessly up into Harry’s touch.  The sight of Draco arching underneath him and lost in his pleasure almost made Harry come right then and he barely kept control.
“I don’t…” Draco began again, his mind scrambling for some explanation for why he had summoned Harry Potter instead of the Dark Lord.
Harry pulled back the tiniest bit and looked at Draco.  His eyes were still wide and he was breathing hard, but he hadn’t pulled away, so Harry leaned forward and press their lips together again.  The feel of his husband’s lips on his again, after days and days of worry, overwhelmed him.  He pulled Draco flush against him with one arm, while with the other hand he threaded his fingers tightly through Draco’s hair.  Draco’s lips parted under his and he slid his tongue into the wet heat of his mouth.
When he was finally seated, Draco rested one hand next to Harry’s head and with the other he cupped his jaw and pulled him up for a kiss.  Harry finally gave into the urge and grasped Draco’s hips, thrusting up as he held Draco firmly.  “Harry!” Draco gasped, and whimpered into their kiss.  He leaned back and started rocking his hips, pushing himself back and forth on Harry’s prick.
“You want me to kiss you?” Draco asked hesitantly.
She set him up in a nearby room with a hospital bed and a nearby bassinet.  When she left, Harry laid his daughter down in the baby bed and pulled it next to the hospital bed.  He lay down on the bed, the enormity of the day catching up to him.  He had the child he always wanted, but without the man who meant everything to him.  With his heart aching, Harry fell into an exhausted slumber.
“Harry Potter is being the most powerful wizard alive. Harry Potter will help Master Draco,” Dilly said with confidence.
“Good… good.” Harry nodded as he spoke, and then looked down at their intertwined fingers.
“Let’s move over here.” Bill stood up and moved to the center of the room.  Harry and Draco followed him.  “I need you to face each other and hold hands,” Bill instructed.
“What do you mean?  I uh . . . I do a lot,” Harry answered.
“You won’t survive,” Granger said harshly. “None of us would. Not without Harry as a guide.”
“This is for you, mother,” he said as he handed it to Narcissa.
“OK,” Harry said his shoulders slumped and his tone defeated.  “When can we . . . I mean, when will I see you?”
They made their way to the office entrance being careful not to stray too far apart.  The staircase revealed itself on their approach, and they soon found themselves seated in front of Dumbledore’s desk.
“We can talk later.” Draco pushed away from him more forcefully and this time moved out of his embrace.  When Draco moved off the bed and started to dress, the bond tugged at Harry until he too left the bed and moved over to the wardrobes.  They dressed without talking.  Draco put on a button up shirt, pressed trousers and his school robes. While Harry threw on jeans, a t-shirt and a pair of trainers.
Malfoy moved off the bed and stood next to it.  Harry tried to get out of bed on his side, but as he swung his legs over the side and started to stand his whole body started aching.  He stopped and flopped back onto the bed.  He turned his head and looked over to where Malfoy was bent over and clutching the bedpost.
“It is being the only way.” She folded her arms across her chest defiantly. She produced an ancient-looking book from her right pocket. “Harry Potter will be needing this.”
“No.  No, I uh, do.  Work I mean . . . I’m an Auror,” he said.
(See the end of the chapter for
As he lay in the couch listening to his baby’s wails, he got angrier and angrier.  “Fuck this!” he thought.  Draco had helped to create their baby.  He had a responsibility to both Harry and Al, he could damn well step up and share in that.  Before he could think too much about what he was doing, he stood and picked up Al.  He grabbed her bag filled with extra nappies, clothes, and formula, and apparated them both to the middle of the Malfoy’s suite at the Wailing Wraith.
Draco’s head turned restlessly and he groaned as he opened his eyes.  “Pahh,” he croaked.  “Water,” he whispered, holding his hand out in demand.  Harry handed him the closest thing he could find, a cold cup of tea.  Draco drank deeply and then made a face, “Couldn’t cast a warming charm, Potter?”
“Look, Harry, one day you are going to look over at me and think to yourself, ‘What the hell am I doing with Draco Malfoy? He’s an arrogant asshole, and I can do much better!’  And then you will remove me from your life.  It’s bound to happen sooner or later.  I mean I’m a former Death Eater.  There’s only one way this ends.” Draco swiped the tears away and closed his eyes.  “I was trying to protect myself . . . trying not to fall in love with you,” he said dejectedly, “failed spectacularly at that too.”
It was Ron who spoke up, “When we finally broke through the trap, it set off a secondary curse and the wall and ceiling fell down on you.  We had to dig you out of the rubble before we could apparate you here.”
Startling Harry, Draco dropped to his knees too.  Insecurity and cautious hope were written all over his face as he raised his eyes to look at Draco.  Draco twined their fingers together tightly.  “Almost from the first moment I met you, Potter, you commanded my attention,” Draco’s voice was soft but steady.  “You fascinated me, angered me, frustrated me, irritated me, thwarted me, amused me, haunted me and aroused me!  Ask any Slytherin from my year, and I’m sure they’ll tell you that I never shut up about ‘Bloody Potter’.”  Draco’s lips quirked up in a wry grin before he continued.  “I tried desperately, not to fall in love with you.  I was certain you would hurt me.  But I failed . . . spectacularly.  Honestly, Harry, I can hardly remember a time when I wasn’t in love with you.”
“Yes,” Draco’s whisper was faint and his eyes were pressed shut.
Both boys nodded at this and Harry was reminded once again about how many experiences they both shared.  Bill grimaced and then continued, “This may be a progressive curse.”
They brushed off the concern of their friends sitting in the common room, and headed straight for their room.  No sooner had the door shut behind them when Malfoy said, “I don’t know about you, Potter, but I need a drink!”
Harry relaxed into the chair and grinned at Draco, this was fun.  “Yeah, my stuff was too gross.  This shirt though, it feels amazing,” Harry emphasized his last words by stroking his hand down his chest.  It didn’t seem possible, but Draco stiffened up even more, at that display.  Harry looked around, “Where is Narcissa?”
“I, I… I don't…” Draco stumbled to explain what had happened.
Malfoy answered him, his voice hard, “He means it will likely get worse.”
Draco nodded, still not lifting his gaze.
Ron spun a fifteen-minute long tale of how he had booby-trapped Professor Flitwick’s desk with billywigs and imps.  Then he turned to Draco. “Malfoy, truth or dare?”
The room seemed to be getting warmer and Harry was getting lightheaded.  Was it possible that this room was airtight?  Was Harry slowly losing oxygen?  He made a sob and clenched his hands.  He wasn’t going to be able to tell Draco that he didn’t mean what he had said this morning!  He wasn’t going to be able to take it back, and he was going to die.  He had said a lot of awful things he regretted.
His body was still tense and stiff, but Draco leaned up and met Harry’s mouth with his own in a slow soft kiss.  “I want to,” he said quietly, “you don’t know how much.”
The other person who hadn’t come was his husband.  The love of his life, Al’s papa, had not shown up.  Narcissa had come by with apologies and more pleas for patience, but Harry’s patience was at an end.  This wasn’t right, it wasn’t supposed to be like this.  He had never planned on being a single parent.  He should have his partner by his side, helping him in caring for their daughter.
“Yes, to your sister, and to me,” Harry folded him into a big hug.  Then he stood up and asked, “Where’s my daughter?  She needs to meet her big brother!”  He sat Teddy in the armchair and placed Atria in his lap.  “That’s it, Ted.  Make sure you hold her head up, she can’t do that by herself yet.”
Despair shining from his eyes, Draco snapped, “What would you have me do then?! She is dying, Dilly!”
What was happening?  Why was everyone, even Neville, only asking questions of him and Draco?
“Hahaha, that’s the plan,” Harry laughed.  “Now about my question . . .”
“A couple?” Harry asked, finally taking pity on Draco’s discomfort.
“That’s . . . that’s inhuman!” Draco said.
floundered, unable it seemed to verbalize his relationship to Harry.
Draco didn’t trust his voice at the moment, afraid he might just start confessing his long-held crush and secret desires, so he just nodded. That seemed to satisfy Potter, who then took the talisman from his pocket and consulted it.
“She’s been cursed,” Draco reluctantly explained.
Harry chuckled as he just kept walking.  Their bond got painful for a brief moment, and then it relaxed when Draco started following.  When he got to the bathroom, Harry reached into the shower cubicle and turned on the water.  He spoke without turning around to look at Draco, “You better strip off, unless you want to get your clothes wet?”  Harry heard and angry grumble as a response, and then he heard the rustle of clothing being removed.
She unrolled the parchment and read through the contents.  “I’m sorry but I must respond to this right away.  Please excuse me,” she said as she rose.  “I shouldn’t be too long.”  Then she went into the adjoining room and shut the door.
-----
“We can and we will!”  Harry sat forward and leaned toward Draco, “You are not a teenager anymore, Draco. It’s time to grow up and be a man!  And start living up to your responsibilities.  You have a daughter now, and she comes first!  Look, I’m not talking about us, being together,” Harry waved a hand toward Draco.  “We can each have our own room.  But you need to be a father, and I’m not willing to do this part-time, so we will live together and both parent our baby.”  Harry was running on pure adrenaline at this point, but he needed to get this settled before he collapsed.  He looked over at Draco who was still frowning and sitting rigidly.  “Are we going to do that here, or at Grimmauld Place?”
“Well, I won’t be doing any of that,” Draco scoffed.
Harry leaned his shoulder against the door jamb, content to watch Draco rocking their daughter to sleep.  There was so much happiness inside of him that he thought he just might explode.  If he were standing in front of the Mirror of Erised right now, he would see this exact scene reflected back at him.  Draco looked up just then and caught his eye.  “I love you,” Harry mouthed.  Draco rose and laid the sleeping baby down in her crib.
“Alright then mate, take care of the kids, and Mum and Dad.  We’ll see you at the hospital,” with that, Ron disapparated Hermione and himself.
“Let me try now,” Harry said in rushed whisper, trying to get this fixed before the professor reached them, but when he cast the spell nothing happened.
Harry fought against the need to push Draco down and cover his body with his own.  He held himself back and continued this tantalizing kiss.  Harry licked at Draco’s bottom lip, and then pressed their lips together again.  Draco made a small needy sound, and Harry brought his hands up to thread through Draco’s hair and hold him steady for a deeper kiss, but Draco grabbed his wrists and pulled his hands away.  Draco broke the kiss and sat back away from Harry.
Refusing to acknowledge his doubts he took a deep breath and raised his wand. He spared a brief thought to the connection he always felt with Potter when using this wand, and then he began the incantation. Nothing happened when he finished and Draco could feel tears of frustration prickle his eyes.
Harry tried to be understanding but he was hurt when Draco refused to return home with him, and he did some pouting of his own.  After three days of silence between the two men, Narcissa sent Harry an owl with an invitation to join her and Draco for lunch in their suite.  So it was that Harry found himself with damp palms and rapid heartbeat, standing at their hotel door.  He scrubbed his hands over the sides of his jeans to dry them.  As he did this, he questioned his clothing choice again.
“That was bloody brilliant!” Harry said turning his head to look at Draco.
The red candle wax had melted and pooled on the table. Draco had been at this all night but he opened a new tome and started poring over the contents. He carelessly waved his wand at the candle, making it whole again and starting the process all over. His father had collected a ridiculous number of books on Dark Magic, and Draco had never appreciated his twisted mind more. He knew there must be an answer to the curse placed on his mother, and he knew it was probably to be found in one of these volumes in the Malfoy library.
Harry panicked.  Any dare Pansy Parkinson would assign him was bound to be humiliating, “Uh . . . truth.”
Draco took a deep breath, his posture was still tense and unyielding.  “Yes,” he breathed out.
As the sunlight slanted across his closed eyelids, pain throbbed in his head and Harry felt like something had crawled into his mouth and died.  “Good morning, Boy Who Lived!” shards of Draco’s voice sliced into his head.  Harry moaned as quietly as he could and tried to pull his pillow over his head.  “Here,” Draco was shouting at Harry again, as he thrust a glass bottle into his hand.  “Drink that.”
“You are in St. Mungos, darling.  You had a potions accident,” Narcissa’s tone was calm but she threw worried looks to Harry when Draco looked down at his hospital gown again.
“Yeah,” he answered, too caught up in the intensity of Draco’s stare to give a more coherent response.
“What . . ?” Harry was confused.  Was Malfoy saying what he thought he was saying?
Draco trembled, more out of shock than any fear Potter would actually hurt him. What had gone wrong? His brain scrambled to come up with an answer. “I… I wasn’t trying to bring you here. Something must have gone wrong.” Draco looked back down at the page in Potter’s hand.
“You could pay them,” Draco suggested.  Harry raised an eyebrow quizzically but didn’t reply.  “You can!” Draco insisted.
Harry reached out his free hand and clutched at the fabric of Draco’s shirt trying to drag him closer.  The feel of the fabric made it through Harry’s lust clouded brain, there was something wrong about this, if only he could remember what it was?  Harry pulled back abruptly, “Wait!  Why are you wearing all your clothes?  If we fucked, why are you dressed?  I would have felt the pull if you had gone to your wardrobe to get dressed!”
“This is not an exact science, as much as we would like it to be, Mr. Malfoy,” the Healer reprimanded.
“I think Dra . . . uh, Malfoy is the one who will mind, Pansy,” Harry challenged.  But even before he had finished talking, Harry could see Malfoy crawling across the circle towards him, a determined expression on his face.  Before he knew it Malfoy was in front of him, his grey eyes piercing Harry’s.
The students eagerly entered the DADA classroom this Thursday.  Professor Thropwaite had promised them that he was giving them some hands on practice.  He had obtained some cursed objects that were considered “trainers.”  They were the same kind that the Aurors used.  The objects were cursed with mild, non-lethal curses, so that the students could practice identifying and then breaking the curses.
After their friends had left, Madam Pomfrey brought them each a pair of pajamas.  She then placed a screen between them, so that they could have privacy when they changed but remain in close proximity.  The next minutes were awkward for Harry.  Each rustle of cloth from the other side of the screen had him imagining Malfoy removing another piece of clothing, until he was thinking about Malfoy naked and starting to get an unwelcome hard-on.  He rushed to finish changing his own clothes and practically jumped into his bed so he could pile the blankets over his groin and disguise his arousal.
“You better get used to ‘that racket’ because there is going to be a lot of that in your future,” Harry said, refusing to feel sorry for Draco.
Harry tried to smile but he was sure it looked more like a grimace.  He was glad he hadn’t eaten any breakfast because he was so nauseated he was sure he would have just thrown it up.  “Great,” he forced out through gritted teeth.
Harry slid his hand down from Draco’s hair so that he was cradling Draco’s face.  The moment stretched out, both quietly looking at the other.  Harry skimmed his thumb down so that it was gently gliding across Draco’s lips.  Draco kissed it softly and Harry dragged it down, pulling Draco’s lips apart.  Harry was tempted to kiss him right then, but he knew they needed to talk some more and that would never happen if they started kissing now.
“Merlin!  I am so happy to see you,” Harry said with a giant grin.  “I mean, er, you awake, that is.  See you awake . . .” Harry trailed off as he moved to hug Draco close to him.
Harry reached up and gently cradled Draco’s cheek. “Apparently there’s a loophole. A very big loophole.” He gave a small chuckle. “It even has a name: Persephone’s Provision.”
After what could have been hours or minutes, Uilliam came over to Harry.  “Our scans are all normal, Harry.  We haven’t been able to reverse engineer all of the potions yet, Draco was by far our best at that, but when we do, that may give us more information.”
Once there he filled Bill and Fleur in on the situation.  He sent a Patronus to Molly and Arthur, and one to Narcissa as well.  He wasn’t sure if he sent one to Draco, how he would respond.  He asked Narcissa to let Draco know he was wanted at the Hospital too.  He, then, apparated to St. Mungo’s.
Ron continued, “Have you ever been in love?”
“Oh, for fucks sake!” Draco moved one hand to the nape of Harry’s neck and the other to the small of his back and he dragged him forward until the full length of their bodies were touching.  “Does this seem like I’m mad at you?”
He heard Malfoy’s bed creak right before Pomfrey bustled back in .“All set then gentlemen?”  She whisked the screen away.  “All right then, you will both spend the night here.  If the pain comes back, we can push the beds together,” she said matter-of-factly.
“I’m sure you both are eager to hear our news,” Dumbledore began.  “Mr. Weasley, why don’t you explain?”
, and he had a hard time catching his breath.  The pain coursed through his body again and Harry cried out, ”Aaaaaah!”
And just like that, Harry’s heart broke again.  This!  This was everything he had imagined back when he and Draco had dreamed of starting a family.  Draco cradling their child and looking so happy.  Tears welled up in Harry’s eyes and fell softly down his face.
Harry closed his eyes as waves of embarrassment, anger, frustration, and arousal swept over him.  Everyone would know.  They would know he and Malfoy were sharing a room, and they would be speculating about what else they were sharing.  But then again, he was going to share a room with Malfoy!
Harry looked over to where Ron was leaning against the bed and holding his wife.  They both looked exhausted.  “Oh, sure, of course.  I’ll see you guys tomorrow,” Harry said as he followed the nurse out, with a sleeping Atria in his arms.
“I am not certain,” Professor Thropwaite began, “but we need to get both of you to the infirmary right away.  Miss Parkinson, and Miss Bulstrode, would you please notify the Headmaster that he is needed in the infirmary, immediately?”
”Do you have anything of his? That would have the most power,” Granger asked.
“Calm down gentlemen,” Dumbledore said as he moved toward them.  “Can you recount to me what happened?”
“Potter, er . . . Harry . . . we shouldn’t do this here,” Draco’s voice was low and urgent, but it did not mollify Harry.
“The distance needed to remain pain free may lessen and lessen,” Bill said quietly.  When he saw Harry’s confusion, he clarified, “You may need to physically touch at all times.”
Draco’s brow wrinkled and he gave a small frown, “Harry, as you have pointed out many times, we are already married.  What are you doing?”  Draco tried to use their joined hands to pull Harry up to his feet.
“Have you ever been in love?” Hermione’s voice rang out and all eyes turned to Harry.
“We think we were able to repair all the damage, but it is going to take some time to know for sure.  Mr. Potter’s body will have a lot of work to do too,” Wilcox intoned, talking right over another muttered “Potter-Malfoy”.  “Are you able to speak, Mr. Potter?” he turned and asked Harry.
”Master Draco and Harry Potter and Harry Potter’s friend are needing to eat.” She tugged at her ears some more in distress. “Dilly was instructed not to disturb. But Master Draco is calling Dilly here, so she is not being disturbing. Dilly has made sandwiches…”
He was sleeping deeply when he felt his wand vibrate next to him.  He rolled over and started to go back to sleep when it started chiming.  He lay there debating with himself about whether to get up and help Draco or let him sink or swim on his own.  He finally hauled himself out of bed, deciding to be a grown-up.  This was his daughter after all.
Far from moving away, Draco leaned his head forward and started grazing his teeth along the side of Harry’s neck.  At the same time he rocked his hips gently so that his hard dick slid back and forth between Harry’s arse cheeks.  A shudder ran through Harry’s body at the sensations Draco was creating.  “Draco!” Harry gasped.  His own cock was hard and aching now too.
Silence descended once more over the table.  Narcissa one again smoothed over the awkward moment.  “If you’re both finished, let’s adjourn to the sitting area?”  They moved across the room and Harry settled himself into an armchair facing the settee, where Draco and his mother were sitting.  They had just sat down when an owl arrived and Draco rose to let it in the window.  He fed the owl a treat and untied the parchment from its leg.
“Don’t . . .”
“I will break it Harry.  I’m very good at what I do.” Bill looked him in the eye this time.  He even started to put his hand on Harry’s knee for comfort, but pulled his hand back at the last moment, darting a glance at Malfoy.
“I think,” Draco’s voice broke on his words and he had to clear his throat and start again. “I think that is highly provident”—a shy smile crept over Harry’s face as he listened to Draco’s words—“since I happen to love you too.”
For one, there was the strange thing that happened in the library.  Harry had been returning from the stacks, his arms weighed down with a pile of books for his History of Magic assignment.  He walked over to where other students were sitting and working at tables.  He saw Malfoy sitting alone at a table, his parchments and books spread across the whole surface.  As he drew nearer, he watched Malfoy draw his wand and move the books and papers into neat stacks, leaving half of the table now clear.  Harry was so startled he halted in his tracks.  Malfoy hadn’t said anything or even looked at him, but Harry couldn’t shake the idea that he had cleared this space for him.  Harry sat in the empty chair and plopped his books down.  “Thanks,” he mumbled quietly.
Professor Thropwaite hurried toward them, followed by Blaise and Theo supporting Malfoy between them.  “Are you sure neither of you touched anything?” Thropwaite asked again.  Blaise, Malfoy and Theo leaned against the desk where Harry was sitting.
“Fuck, yes!  Touch myself . . . while you watch?” Harry’s voice came out in a gravelly whisper.
“That’s it baby,” Harry encouraged. He slipped one hand up the back of Draco’s t-shirt to stroke his back, and the other inside his pajama bottoms to palm his ass.  Draco’s ass was perfect in his hand, the skin was soft and silky and gently rounded.  Harry stroked, letting the tips of his fingers lightly brush at the cleft.  His own prick hardened and ached just from touching Draco.
Draco moved their hands so that he was now holding both of Harry’s wrists with one hand, still pinned against the wall.  He took his free hand and gently held Harry’s jaw, tilting his head so Harry was once again looking him in the eyes.  “I’m going to make you come now.” Draco’s voice was low, and his words made Harry’s dick twitch.  He slowly dropped his hand from Harry’s face. Draco stepped back and trailed his hand down his chest pausing to pinch at Harry’s nipple.  Then Draco moved lower, softly dragging his nails across Harry’s stomach and down through his happy trail.
The teachers walked back over to them and they fell silent.  Madam Pomfrey spoke for the group, “The curse that was triggered was some sort of a bond, and you were bonded to each other when you touched.  We don’t know the full terms of the bond at this point, but we know from your pain that there is a proximity element.  Mr. Weasley will be arrive by the morning to help us sort it all out.”  She took a deep fortifying breath. “Mr. Malfoy, we would prefer to wait and contact your parents when we have more definitive information, but if you wish it – we will notify them immediately.”
Narcissa held out her hands to Harry, and when he placed his hands into her, she squeezed them tightly.  “I’m pleased to see you, Harry.  Thank you for joining us,” she said graciously.  Draco lingered at the door for a few moments before moving to join them.  Silence descended as the two men stared at each other.  Into the awkward moment, Narcissa suggested, “Why don’t we proceed with luncheon.”  She gestured to the table, nearby, that was already set with linens and crystal.
Harry had spoken so softly that Draco wasn’t sure he had heard right. “What do you mean because of love? Do you mean because of my mother? Because we were there to help her?”
