Knowing that the room had once been meant for guests only made its present state even more pitiful.
Fay only laughed at him, exchanged a greeting with Zabini and walked away.
"There's the birthday boy!" greeted Sirius when Harry walked into the kitchen. It was fairly early and they were still in their pyjamas, but his godfather was as energetic as usual as he kicked back a chair for him to sit on. It was only when he passed Harry a fresh cup of coffee that he did a double-take, and his smile turned into a frown. "Godric, did you even sleep?"
The blond was in the middle of writing an essay for Arithmancy, and Harry, who had already finished his essay for Transfiguration, just watched him in silence. Judging from the complicated charts Draco was consulting and the slight frown on his face, the essay was no easy task.
A rush ran through him when he felt the small gap as if he were about to jump from a very high place to unexplored but promising depths. Harry could feel his heart drumming on his ears and a hand slightly tensing on his shoulder as he tentatively parted his lips too. The kiss turned
“You could have done plenty,” said another voice. Parkinson had stepped out of a compartment- more exactly, she had stepped out of Harry’s compartment, her angry face a stark contrast to Luna’s curious one over her shoulder.
“Make sure you drown in the next one, Scarhead,” said the blond.
“Merci, ‘Arry.” Fleur gave his cheek yet another kiss, before locking her arm with her fiance’s and smiling widely. Her hair seemed to float as she looked around with curious eyes. “Is your boyfriend here?”
“Well, thank
Draco scrunched his nose. “The least I could do is break this off, if I have a sliver of respect for my father-”
? Have you-” Draco halted his words, his eyes flickering towards the still lit fireplace. “You called him,” he said almost quietly. “And he wasn’t at the house?”
Kreacher chuckled. “Master is not here.”
“No, he’s not,” had said Draco indifferently, not even looking up from his essay. “He’s been
He used that irritation to answer Draco. "Not to you," he muttered. Clenching his jaw not only stopped him from smiling, it also made him look angry, like the whispering crowd watching them expected him to be.
“Of course she did,” drawled Draco, sounding quite pleased. He then shrugged. “That’s fine, I’ll help you tomorrow."
but I guess
Draco sent him a sideways glance and smiled. “All you have to know, Harry, is that I plan to keep my promise."
thought Harry, and sudden sharp pain on his knee made the images faint away. He was back at the office, kneeling on the floor as he had fallen. He looked up at Snape in alarm.
“But you should have seen it coming, Harry,” continued Fred rather seriously, his eyes glancing at Draco just as he rounded the corner. “He is a Slytherin, and a Malfoy at that.”
“That was
“I didn’t notice they were here,” confessed Draco, eyes fixed on Harry again.
Disguising his laugh at his uncle’s reaction as a cough, Harry looked at his aunt and cousin. Petunia was staring at the conversation with wide eyes, but Dudley was looking at him weirdly, and then he suddenly slapped his own thick neck with a hand.
"Bye, Harry!" called Hermione, waving at him from the door. "And bye, Malfoy!"
“If you have already received your schedules, I imagine there must be much more productive things to do with your time than gossip," she said, making a group of younger students mumble apologies and scramble.
"Very funny," said Harry. "Well, let's give it a try." He grabbed at the sides of the golden egg.
However, it probably wasn’t healthy for him to spend so much time exposed to the coldness of the owlery. Warming charms could only do so much, after all. But asking him to hang out in the library, for example, felt like something big, and it brought Harry back to the image of an explorer in unknown territory.

. Harry sat on the bed and opened the envelope quickly, his heart beating and mind going a mile per minute. Was there something wrong? The letter only had a single line, and it made Harry’s stomach sink.
Ron straightened up on his seat, looking pale. “Yes, captain!”
“You know, you are not the
“That woman
“Are you serious, Lavender?” exclaimed Parvati. “He is a jerk! He made Neville trip yesterday after class!”
“You heard?” Draco tilted his head, then blinking. “Ah, right, you left just after the match began.”
"They will sell us out," mumbled Ernie.
Harry frowned. “Ron, it’s alright-"
“Careful, Ronnie,” said Ginny, giving Harry a wry look. “You have a fanatic right next to you.”
Mr Weasley was waiting for him outside the courtroom and sighed in relief when Harry nodded at him. “I knew it would be alright,” said the man, giving him a pat on the back as they walked down the corridor.
And now he was growing as desperate as angry because Hermione doubted every word that came out of his mouth. “I know what I saw!” he snapped, cutting her off. They were in a classroom on the first floor, away from preening ears, but Ron still glanced around warily as if to check no one had heard his outburst.
Draco hummed and turned to look at him. "So, what did you do today in your little class?"
The blond hummed, leaning closer to Harry. “Alright, I won’t ask," he said as they started walking towards the village.
“Don’t listen to her, Harry,” said Ron from across the table. He had already begun on a slice of chocolate cake. “She’s just envious.”
Harry offered to carry Draco owl’s cage for him.
“Your boyfriend even closer?"
Harry was still brimming with anger and even if he knew that it wasn’t entirely his, in his panic he let it grow. “Not hearing it won’t change anything,” he said. It was harsh and made Draco wince, but Harry couldn’t help it. If Draco was taking this position now, what would happen later when the truth got out? “Draco, what is happening now-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then why didn’t you?”
“Too small to remind me of that one,” said Draco, giving Harry a grin that made it hard to tell if he was messing with him or showing off.
“A secret group for Defense,” mused Sirius, beaming at Harry. “That’s an
"Harry wouldn't call me petty."
“Then later,” joked Harry, laughing when Draco frowned at him. “By the way,” he added, turning his gaze to examine the village as they crossed it, just in case a certain horrid woman dressed in pink popped up. “What about you? Any accidental magic?”
“Hello, guys,” she greeted, before turning to look at Harry. “Liste, Blaise asked me to ask you if you have already bought something for Monday, or if he is going to have to hex you?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “No, because our circumstances are probably different.” He took out the badge from his pocket and held it up, showing off the glowing red letters. “He made this.”
“He is. But I’d like to make one myself."
Harry thought it should make him feel better, hearing that the Order valued what Draco had done, that they cared for him… but it didn’t. All he felt was a weight on his stomach, because the tapestry was right in front of him; undeniable, accusing.
He walked away then, fists clenched as he refrained from kicking the door open and stomping up the stairs. Behind him, he could hear Mrs Weasley and Lupin talking to Sirius, sounding upset. He heard the door open again and two sets of steps following behind him.
Ron raised his head, looking sour. "What does Krum has to do with any of this?" he muttered.
“Hello, Harry,” she said. “Would you like to go find seats with us, or is obstructing the corridor something Gryffindors like to do?”
Ron gaped, his face going a bit pale. “How did she know?" he whispered.
"Call him again." His attention went back to Draco, who was looking at him seriously, not deterred at all when Harry scowled at the suggestion.
The answering grin told him that she had understood and that she would use that information however she pleased, which was a frightening prospect.
” Harry grinned at his offended boyfriend. “But you have every right to be, I think."
Both Harry and Parkinson reeled back.
Harry realized he was measuring it.
Dumbledore started walking. “Budleigh Babberton.”
"Damn right we are. Everyone is coming, even that bastard Mundungus. Caught him trying to steal some things from here, so we will have to keep an eye on him, but he is fun company."
“You are ridiculous,” whispered Draco against his lips. His eyes were bright and mesmerizing, and all Harry could see until Draco pulled back to give him a white grin. “It wouldn’t hurt you to do it as well, you know."
"Yes, sir."
Harry thought she meant the gnomes, but Hermione laughed behind her hand and Ron frowned in disapproval. “That’s rude."
Harry nodded and signalled Draco to lend him his ear. He thought about telling him Sirius was his godfather, that he wasn’t a criminal and it was alright.
Harry wondered what Dobby would say if he asked about Draco.
“Yes, you are,” said Hermione. “You are going to report the truth, the exact facts that Harry says about Voldemort’s return.”
By the end of the inspection, Hermione had tears of fury in her eyes, glaring at Umbridge as she left and looking an inch away from hexing her. Harry felt the same way, after having to stand the awful woman treating Hagrid as if he were below her, speaking slowly and in a patronizing way. Hagrid’s loss at the treatment had only made it worse, the man looking severely less enthusiastic as he continued the class.
They walked together through the quiet halls, Harry pressing on the issue, grin growing every time Draco pointedly ignored him. "Well, go on," said Draco, coming to stop by the end of the stairs. He finally looked at Harry again, instantly frowning, "I don't appreciate you grinning at me like that."
“Must be catching it from you."
Harry was losing time. Sirius could be dying right now. Could have already died, or been tortured so much he had become like Neville’s parents. “There’s no use calling again, Kreacher won’t say anything else and I’m-” He was losing Sirius, and that made his panic rise up again, his heartbeat drumming on his ears and his hands twitching for something to do.
“I doubt it will be on the Lake again, Draco,” said Zabini. He started pushing the blond towards the castle. “Let’s go, before you embarrass us any further.”
At least that's what he plans to do. He wants to help Malfoy, even if he is an absolute git, because now he can't forget the haunted expression on Malfoy's face the entire year. Harry had thought it was because he was up to something, but now that he knew it was this…
Harry patted his arm softly. “Yes, you are."
Draco didn’t move, frowning at him sternly. “If you think,” he paused, looking a bit pink. “If you think I’m going to let you
to think of a younger Lucius dancing around a spacious room with a little Draco to the sound of his wife’s piano. It was
“Lines,” sighed Harry. “I have to write lines."
Lupin's eyebrows furrowed in a frown. "Harry, surely you understand why we might feel troubled by this."
. He wondered what he could be doing that early. Had he woken up already? Had breakfast with his mother and the empty seat on a long table? Or was he still under the covers, depriving the world of his presence?
"Your boyfriend calls you
Predictably, Draco gave him the absolutely amazing glare he had probably wanted to give him all the way there. "Do you think this is funny, Potter?" he asked, voice angry but still out of breath.
Draco stopped for a moment, before laughing even harder. “What the hell? That’s just weird,” he said between chuckles. It was a glorious sound, bright in the middle of the awful day. Harry would miss it terribly during summer, but he didn’t want to bring that up again.
“Godric, Harry, why do you sound as if it were the end of the world? I understand that you are whipped and want to see him, but...” His eyebrows furrowed and he placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Is there something wrong?”
Harry remembered Draco being more terrified than ecstatic, so he just raised an eyebrow. “Well, Firenze was the one that saved me.”
“Potter.”
thought Harry. “It’s a surprise."
“What did you do?” asked Dudley fearfully.
Hermione frowned as if offended. “It’s not
Draco frowned. “Ah, so it
“Peachy." Draco glanced at his friends and then gave Harry an odd look. “Can I speak with you for a second?"
“You better not go easy on the other Seeker,” continued Angelina. “No matter what."
“He stands for everything we are against, Harry” explained Mr Weasley, looking quite serious. “And he is one of our biggest threats at the moment. You saw how he has Fudge under his influence, and the Ministry along with him."
"I need to find a different way," finished Harry. He sighed. "I get it, but, Draco, it's so
“Big-time,” agreed Ron.
He felt like laughing. “You have to obey him,” said Harry, looking at Kreacher as the elf let out another choked sound. “He is in the tapestry. He is from the Black Family. You
Bill circled an arm around her waist, and she dropped the frown to gaze at him fondly. “It seems like you haven’t heard yet,” he said with a smile.
"Because it's
Harry can only look at him as Malfoy pulls back with a glare that lacks the usual fire.
“I’m good at most things, Potter,” said Malfoy, very snobbishly.
"Not yet," he said. "Hermione is helping me look into plants now, but so far no luck."
“Is being bossy a Black trait?” murmured Harry, grinning when Sirius looked offended. “Yeah, yeah, I’m going.” He climbed the stairs two steps at the time, noticing how the house looked much cleaner than last time. It seemed that Sirius had been as excited to live with him as Harry had.
"Not even wearing a hat for me? How cruel, Potter." The green curtains were pulled to the side as Draco walked out of the changing rooms, dressed in his emerald and black Quidditch robes. They suited him rather well, like the grin that curled up his lips. "My teammates are concerned about having spies out here," continued Draco, raising an eyebrow at the three of them. "Maybe speak a bit lower."
Harry snorted. “Don’t worry, there won’t be any more visits in the near future,” he said, thinking back to that particular trainwreck. An idea popped up in his head. “You know,” he added, keeping an eye on Draco. “The cave is still open."
Malfoy studied him carefully before stepping back. “Fine, have it your way.” He looked away for a moment and sighed, then turning back to him with a small grin. “How is your essay going? Need any help?”
“Not you too!” said Hermione. “I thought that with Draco you wouldn’t be so easily won over.”
Malfoy glared at him before giving him a nasty smile that made Harry feel a familiar pang of irritation and anticipate harsh words. “I suppose congratulations are in order, right?” mocked Malfoy. “I would have thought you would have enough with all the Gryffindors grovelling at your feet, but perhaps that wasn’t enough for you-”
“I just asked them to calm down,” said Harry sheepishly.
“He likes me now, but we used to
His interactions with his friends were tense. He could tell Hermione and Ron were as lost as he was.
Harry examined his friend, whose hair looked like she had passed her hands through it a lot. “How was it?” he asked while glancing at the Slytherin table. Draco seemed tired as well, waving Blaise’s questions off while pinching the bridge of his nose.
Ron spat the name in such a horrible way; angry, disgusted, hateful. The same way Harry had said that name before, the name of the boy with a malicious grin, and sharp words; of the boy who was petty, and prissy, who had a posh voice, and talked to Harry about his family. Who helped him with Potions and teased him for his mistakes. Who had the prettiest eyes Harry had ever seen, and the prettiest laugh he had ever heard. The name of the boy Harry liked. Draco’s name.
"Skiving off classes, Harry?" said Draco, cracking a smile. "Was Myrtle right about you being a bad influence?"
“It’s just a question, Harry, I know that you spend quite some time with Draco, who is your boyfriend, and it’s natural that you might feel, er, desire.” Remus glared at Sirius again when he whistled, but Harry was too busy combusting.
decided to be just friends," pointed Ron.
Whoever the previous owner was, it was clear that they knew what they were doing.
At that moment Harry had realized how much in deep shit he was, because Malfoy’s pale skin under his wrist wasn’t tainted by an inky mark, but marred with another scar, in a red crescent shape that couldn’t be anything else but a bite, and everything he had seen suddenly made sense and he had to get out of there.
“What are those things?” asked Ron as he walked in.
Harry remembered looking at him all night. “I did."
“I have to say, I’m disappointed so many of our housemates are so superficial,” continued Hermione.
Ron blinked too. “Isn’t that a sixth-year charm?”
Hermione smiled. “See? Harry is fine with it.”
thought Harry as he watched him disappear around the corner, his head light as he held a hand to the spot Draco had kissed, somehow still warm.
Draco leaned forwards, letting his head fall on Harry's shoulder. "I know," he said, voice as low as a whisper. "I know that, Harry. But even then, thank you." His hands tightened on their grasp of Harry's jacket. "I just don't know what to do now."
Malfoy looked at him when he didn’t answer, a pale eyebrow raised as a question. “Didn’t you already have a good laugh? What do you want?” he repeated, sounding irritated.
Ron and Hermione were sitting on the couch when he entered the Common Room, faces set on identical serious expressions that told Harry they had been waiting for him.
Sirius whistled. “Pretty eyes, huh."
become a blood traitor.”
“Score?” Harry shrugged. “I’ll be fine. After all, both Angelina and Oliver were great captains and I remember quite a few things they said.”
"It's both." Harry wondered if what he was going to say was too dumb, but Draco was looking at him expectantly, and Harry had said dumber things before. He cleared his throat. “I mean, it’s fun to trick them together, right? You know, you and me,” He gestured at them, “together.”
“Very,” said Harry, standing up again and unfolding his cloak. “Goodnight, Draco.”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “We?”
Harry wasn’t convinced, and it must have shown on his face because his godfather sighed and squeezed his shoulders. “No one thinks it’s your fault, Harry. We will figure it out, don’t worry about it. I’m sure it will be fine." Sirius smiled at him. “Plus, it’s thanks to your connection that Arthur is now sitting with his family, and not, well..., you know."
“What?” Sirius frowned in puzzlement, looking between Dumbledore and Harry before realisation crossed his features, followed by a groan. “Oh, don’t tell me it’s that slimy bastard.”
“I don’t wanna talk about it” grumbled Harry, voice muffled by the couch.
Harry looked up. “Is he your friend?”
“Win?”
"Oh! Young love!" exclaimed Rita Skeeter, waving her smoking camera. Her hair was in disarray, as if she had been running. "I've been after you for a while, but this is the money shot! You are absolutely adorable together, I'm sure everyone will think that."
"Harry," whispered Draco, and Harry noticed his eyes were slightly red.
Harry blinked. “So it’s all good?"
Pocketing her parchment as she advanced, Angelina looked positively intimidating, channelling the intensity that Oliver Wood had once portrayed but somehow worse. “This is my first and last season as captain, Harry, and I plan for us to win," said Angelina, waving a warning finger at him. “This is the only match against Slytherin, and we need to rank as many points as we can for a good start. I want you to get that snitch, and do so quickly."
Harry tensed, feeling alert. He and Malfoy might have established an odd truce at the moment, but Harry wouldn’t accept any ill comments about his friends. And he knew Malfoy was full of those.
Harry scowled. “Just get out of here, Zacharias.” Smith attempted to do so, but Draco’s wand remained where it was, pressing into the Hufflepuff’s skin. “Draco,” said Harry, bringing a hand to lower the other’s arm.
“Of course you wouldn’t,” mumbled Harry, feeling the fingers on his hair retreat. He opened his eyes slowly, smiling at the frowns directed at him.
The woman followed her son’s gaze to Harry, her blue eyes then darting back to Draco. Harry was starting to wonder how badly he had messed up when he realised that Draco was still looking at him despite his mother’s presence, not rushing to excuse himself in any way, which didn’t make sense unless he was not worried about her watching.
“Come back here, you coward!” yelled Nott, and Harry spun around to shut him up again but this time Crabbe stood up in front of him, meeting his frown. Harry scowled at him, directed one dark glare at Nott and went after Draco, breaking into a run as he rounded the corner he had disappeared behind.
He ran back to the Common Room to get Sirius' knife, and then back again to meet Ron and Hermione near the Defense Classroom. “I’ll keep watch,” said Ron quickly and Harry was running again with Hermione on his tail. He was feeling out of breath, but he couldn’t stop, not with Sirius-
Harry smiled. “Not sure if I want the Cannons in my walls, but alright.” He stepped in, taking a seat on his desk as he watched his friends examine his room. It felt nice.
“Now, I’ve prepared a few potions, some you might recognize, some you might not, but by the end of the NEWT you all should be able to prepare them.” Slughorn gestured at a cauldron near Draco’s table. “Anyone can tell me which one this is?”
Ron raised an eyebrow. "It's not really an option."
“No.” Harry wanted to say he had friends there, but he wasn’t sure if the Slytherins still liked him and there was no way he was telling the man about Draco. So far the public was unaware of their relationship and something about Slughorn told him that he was the type to exchange a secret for the right price.
"Ah, good to know," said Crabbe.
The wolf doesn't answer. Harry watches as it paces around the Shack, sniffing the air, then sometimes stopping to look at Harry before continuing, as if to make sure he is still there.
Hermione pressed her lips. “Fine.”
“He is fine. Now leave me alone.”
Draco huffed humorously. “Where are mine?"
“Professor?” Harry was the first on his feet. The Headmaster was wearing a purple robe, his half-moon glasses and a serious expression. However, the latter turned to one of tranquillity when he saw them.
Ron seemed to consider him for a moment before he let out a dry laugh.
." He wiggled his eyebrows at Harry. “Unlike
"Just a bit," conceded Harry, He smiled at his friends. "It will be fine, I'm sure they will behave."
Draco turned around and blinked at him. "

“Bye!” said Ron, stepping away from the wall, and from them.

clever."
To his puzzlement, colour rises on Malfoy's cheeks as he says, "Of course I do, I was under Wolfsbane, I retained some faculties- But that doesn't mean I was in control," he adds hastily. "I was merely watching my actions, the rest, it wasn't me."
The forest grew darker as they walked further in, and by the time they finally stopped the trees were so close together that there was no snow on the floor and no light either as if nightfall had fallen upon them. Hagrid seemed right at home, throwing the carcass on the ground and looking at the group with an eager smile. “Gather around,” he called. “The smell of the meat will attract them, but I’m going to call them anyway, so they’ll know it’s me."
PD: Can we talk about Montague? Because in the books Fred and George just shove him inside the Cabinet and the guy disappears for like days and reappears inside a toilet? And then he has to be transferred to Saint Mungo's because he is still like extremely confused? The book even mentions his parents going to Hogwarts.
“I don’t like the git,” added Ron. “But I’d be lying if I said he doesn’t care about Harry. And Harry cares about him too." Ron looked guilty for a moment, “Last year I was a git to Harry."
"Does this mean I can say Pansy Parkinson is kinda hot?" said a boy, sounding quite relieved.
“I can’t believe even McGonagall knows,” said Harry as they headed back to the Gryffindor Tower for their free period.
He squeezed his eyes shut and the light that had made the back of his eyelids look orange disappeared.
“I think your dad thought I was sick, or something,” continued Harry. “The worst part is that Draco told me his father thought I was making fun of him."
Harry hadn’t been there much last year, being too preoccupied with the Tournament, but he was sure that the last time he had been there he hadn’t even thought of the possibility that the next time he went it would be like this: Sitting on a table by the corner, two tankards of Butterbeer on the table and Draco Malfoy across of it, voice posh and sure as he went on about the magical relevance of owls, snakes and cats.
“Sleekeazy’s was invented by Fleamont Potter."
“Back? To the school?” said Hermione, and now there was a clear hint of alarm in her eyes. “Harry, what if he tells- He wouldn’t, right?” she asked, then hurrying to explain herself. “I know he isn’t happy with the idea, and surely Umbridge would do everything in her power to stop us before it's published.”
“Because you want me to skive off too,” pointed Draco. “Which is
Harry realised a second too late how bad of an idea it was, but Malfoy had always made him feel like rushing. And now the horrible screech filled the quietness of the owlery. The many owls took off at the same time, making their feathers rain upon them. Harry fumbled to close the egg, the stubborn thing refusing to do so. Pale hands closed over his, pushing, and the silence was restored.
Malfoy returned the nod and disappeared down the stairs, leaving Harry to the impossible task of finding Pigwidgeon among the many owls still flying back inside. He just hoped he didn’t resent him too much.
After an enthusiastic toast by Mr Weasley for Ron and Hermione, dinner began. The food was wonderful as usual, but perhaps it was knowing that this would be the last night before he saw Draco that made it taste especially good for Harry.
to happen in Hogwarts since
“Thank you, Ron!” cut in Harry. “I think they got the idea."
to help you with your homework instead of asking me?" said Hermione in annoyance.
The silence on the table became uncomfortable, so Harry, who had kept wisely out of the conversation, passed his bite of treacle tart and cleared his throat. “So,” he asked Ginny, because Ron was brooding and Hermione strangely quiet. “Dean Thomas? When did that happen?”
a pretty smile."
“What about Zabini, then?” asked Ron with suspicion.
“Don’t you have a booklist to read?” countered Harry, already opening the letter. It was shorter than usual, and began with a
“Well, I don’t know,” shrugged Ron. “Today he was quite late for Transfiguration."
“What do you think I should do?”
Harry ignored Ron's teasing jab, gave the man a nervous nod and excused himself. All the way back to the Tower, he repeated the words on his head. Because not only had the man spoken with weight and confidence that left Harry wondering where they came from, but the words had also confirmed something for Harry.
“Because you are being stupid,” said Ginny, ignoring his brother’s offended
“How can you be sure?” questioned Draco. “Only we heard them.”
Harry frowned. It did make sense, but Voldemort had still used his closeness to Sirius. And even if that weren't the case, Harry was tired of not being told things. "I understand," he said despite all that, because he did appreciate the man.
Harry smiled. "It's fine."
“I believe we are, Fred,” said George, then turning to Harry. “Say hello to the
“Yes? Why are you asking...? Oh,
The lock opened easily and Harry slipped in, closing the door behind him. He ignored the numerous cat plates and walked straight for the fireplace, took a handful of Floo powder, threw it into the fire and said, “Number twelve, Grimmauld Place,” to the green flames.
There were several things to worry about in the letter, but Harry’s attention was fully directed to the end.
“Are you alright, Hagrid?” asked Harry, because Hagrid not only seemed more bruised than before, he also looked unwell. “What’s up with the-” he gestured to his own face.
Silver eyes met green. “Perhaps you should,” said Draco. “And perhaps I should too. You might be criticized, but I-” he swallowed, “I would be publicly giving my back to my parents. What will they say about a Death Eater’s son that dates one of the people that locked his father up?”
Madam Pince glanced over her open novel as he walked in, eyes slightly widening as she took in his appearance. Harry was sure she had a hawk vision when it came to things that could damage the books, and he hoped there wasn't any surviving drop that would get him kicked out.
"It's like everything ends up working for you, lucky bastard," mused Draco. His eyebrows furrowed. "For a second there I thought Longbottom had killed you. If you hadn't-"
“You make me do stupid things.” Malfoy looked away. “I must be catching your Gryffindor idiocy.”
The doors shut close quickly, and Harry didn’t know if it had been him or the Room itself, but he was quite grateful. Feeling suddenly aware of the empty room, he gave himself some time to breathe and calm his heart before going to stand next to Draco.
Harry watched them leave, hearing their steps disappearing down the room. When he turned to look at the blond again, he found him looking a bit confused.
"Bigger," said Hermione. "Something that tells him how much he matters to you. Something that makes him want to try."
“Harry,” Hermione had run to his side to whisper and Harry listened to her without taking his eyes away from Draco’s. “If Kreacher has spoken then
The world froze around Harry, but he clenched his jaw and remained calm. "But we will."
“How would you know?” said Draco coldly. “I never
Draco took a moment to answer and Harry hoped he wasn’t going to say something like
“But, but-” stammered Hermione, but then her mind seemed to catch up and she sent Draco an accusing look. “You are just trying to bother me, aren’t you?"
Even if Lavender hadn't pointed it out during class, while giving Harry a pitiful look that made him have to bite back a harsh retort, he would have recognised the constellation. How could he not, when it never failed to wink at him from the small patch of night sky pinned to Draco's chest, always bright like him.
Hermione looked more concerned. “You saw him?” she repeated. “Did… Did he say anything?”
thought Harry, trying to calm his beating heart. It wasn’t their first time, not even the third, but perhaps it was the nervous expression on Draco's face that made Harry feel as if he were back at the owlery again. Draco was looking at him expectantly, eyes fixed on Harry’s despite the blush darkening his pale cheeks. Harry silently tugged him closer by the hand, using the other to hold the lower side of his face and gently pull him down. “Yes, sir,” he whispered before closing the distance between the two.
his cactus?"
“The ice cream shop in Diagon Alley?” Harry hadn't been expecting that answer, but Draco had answered automatically, as if he had known the question beforehand.
Draco scrunched his nose. “Don’t speak with your mouth full," he chastised, then switching to a bright smile and looking very pleased with himself. “And of course it’s good,
Sirius laughed. “Why? He’s after a snake himself? Wouldn’t recommend it, apparently they bite a lot,” he teased, reaching a hand to tug on Harry’s scarf and receiving a smack for the effort.
,” said Draco, but he looked rather pleased when Harry glanced at him. “
It sounded very cryptical, and many ideas crossed Harry's head. “You are not going to kill her, right?” he asked after a brief pause.
“Hello, Professor McGonagall,” said Moody.
“About my cousin? No, nothing past the trial.”
"You are important to me," said Harry, feeling his blood rush, heating his face. "I realised that when I thought I saw you. That you could have been there. For me."
“Is Malfoy okay?” grunted Hagrid, sounding confused.
“Well, Harry is a House Traitor” muttered Ron, narrowing his eyes at him. “I thought we were together in this.”
Thanks for reading! As usual, comments and kudos are greatly appreciated! See you on Monday!
I'll see you on Thursday for the last chapter of this instalment! Until then!
Draco was pacing around the owlery when Harry returned, face pale and eyes wide in fear. His breathing had become erratic, as he passed his fingers through his hair nervously.
With an apologetic look at Draco, Harry hurried to the Great Hall entrance. Ron stood by the stairs, backing up them slowly as Hermione advanced, face twisted in anger. Ron looked up at him, making Hermione notice him too.
True to his word, Harry stood there with him until Draco stepped back, after what could have easily been an hour. The blond didn’t look at him, but Harry could still see the red ring around his silver eyes as Draco said that he had things to do.
“Sod off!” snarled Draco, advancing with enough force to make Goyle stumble, but not enough to loosen his grip. “I can’t deal with you right now, Theodore. My father-”
As soon as the door closed, Ron fell back on his seat and let out a sigh. “That can’t be easy at all. I mean, his dad totally deserves it-”
The silence lasted exactly 1 minute.
“Move over, Molly, it’s my turn,” said Sirius, pulling Harry out of the woman’s arms to give him a hug of his own. “Take care, buddy, and do write to me.”
Harry rounded him with his arms. “As much as you need,” he promised and he felt hot tears fall on his shirt. He tightened his hold on Draco as he started shaking and looked up at the ceiling and cursed Voldemort for all the pain he had brought.
A tattered book was placed before Harry, pulling his eyes away from the cauldron, but just for a brief second. The swirly fumes reached for him again, making him feel both at ease and restless. It simply was the best thing Harry had ever smelled; a wonderful mixture of the woody smell of a new broomstick handle, something sweet he was sure was treacle tart, and...
And so more names were called, and Harry was once again reminded that the percentage of students of Hogwarts he actually knew was terribly low. He perked his head up when Dean called Cho Chang’s name, and laughed when Fred named the Fat Lady and was rewarded with a fluffy red and gold cushion energetically thrown towards his face, but then found himself zoning out, not really listening to the unfamiliar names being called, nor the snickers and comments of his housemates afterwards. He had just stifled a yawn and started thinking about going to bed when a particular name reached his ears and his attention was almost painfully pulled back.
Harry laughed, startling the group. “You are completely right, Ickle Diddykins.” Harry folded the letter carefully and pocketed it. “It’s from my
“They are torturing him, and I-”
The blond scowled at him and got closer to study the dummy, eyes tracing the dark cape and dark mask that was terribly familiar for Harry now that he thought about it. "A Dark Wizard," said Draco, confirming his thoughts. The blond glanced at Harry, then looking away. "It's a curious room, isn't it?"
“Seriously, Hermione, you should have been there,” said Ron, eating through his second serving of eggs and toast. “And be the voice of reason among them.”
"I know you like treacle tart, Harry," said Mrs Wearsley fondly as he served himself another slice. "I can send some with Ron next time I bake."
“Help you prepare dinner? Why not ask Kreacher?” asked Harry, not without the spark of anger that came whenever they talked about the elf.
“Not really, I just liked it."
“-you might have tricked the others and made Potter go along with your lie, Malfoy,” was saying Smith with a smug look. “But don’t even
Ron clasped his hands together. "You see, mate. Umbridge sucks. We are not going to learn anything from her."
But then the landscape turned into a city, and their tranquillity burst like a bubble. Harry felt Draco’s fingers tense, stopping their caress as the blond looked outside the window. Harry sat up and took his hand into his. “It will be fine,” he promised in a whisper and Draco turned to look at him and nodded.
Sirius snorted. “Yeah, yeah." He passed an arm around Harry's shoulders. "Well, let’s get downstairs now, let’s show everyone what your
“He is in the house!” yelled Kreacher, immediately letting go of his ears to hit himself in the head repeatedly with his small hands. It reminded Harry of Dobby’s episodes whenever he disobeyed Lucius. “He is upstairs,” croaked Kreacher again, as if he couldn’t help himself. “He is upstairs, Master Draco!”
Draco laughed. "Harry!"
at least that was what Lavender was saying during breakfast.”
“Listen, you didn’t hear this from me.” Harry smiled when Draco raised an eyebrow as if that were obvious. “But I heard that Montague was shoved inside that Vanishing Cabinet from the first floor.”
thought Harry as he took another gulp of Butterbeer, eyes on Draco’s gestures as he explained that those animals were worthy of being a wizard's companion due to their intelligence.
“I’m sorry, it’s a bit dirty,” said Harry, smiling at him. “But I brought it back.”
As the days passed and the answer didn’t arrive, Harry began to worry. This morning, he finally decided to send another letter, just a short one to check in. But Hedwig had returned that same afternoon with no letter and looking tired, as if she had flown back right away, which was really odd since Draco
“Thank you!” Harry huffed. But then Remus kept looking at him expectantly and he spluttered, “Do you think that I-”
?” Dudley said the word in a low whisper, as if it were taboo. “Did you curse him or something?”
Snape was rubbing his failure with Occlumancy on his face, since he had said the same thing back then, that he lacked the skill. He had to bite his tongue to refrain from telling Snape that what he had
“Pretty much,” answered Sirius, explaining Fudge’s paranoia about Dumbledore taking on the Ministry of Magic. If Harry didn’t already think the man was an idiot, he would definitely do so now. Sirius seemed reluctant to answer when Hermione asked about Hagrid. “He was supposed to be back by now,” he said. “But I’m sure he is fine. Dumbledore isn’t worried about it and he wasn’t alone."
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Hermione cut him off, “You shouldn’t help him, Harry. He could have done it yesterday instead of playing chess all night."
“Professor Snape says toads are useful for testing potions, due to their skin,” explained Draco, scrunching his nose again. “But useful or not I’m not touching any. They are
A whimper made them break apart, and Harry remembered that he had been sharing the compartment with three other people. Neville looked scared, blinking many times per second and glancing at the other as if looking for an explanation. Luna still had that dazed smile on her face and Ginny was looking away, arms crossed. Ron and Hermione weren’t there yet, and that made Harry remember something.
“An extremely simplified answer,” said Snape, but he still rose and addressed the class once again, which meant that Harry had been correct. “Nonverbal spellcasting requires a certain grade of concentration and mind power that
(See the end of the chapter for
"Your hair," whispered Draco, so close Harry could feel his breath. "It's still damp."
She wasn’t the only one that had stepped out. All along the corridor many heads popped out of compartments, probably lured by Blaise and Harry’s discussion.
Was Malfoy feeling lonely too, so exhausted of it he had accepted the company of someone he disliked?
This chapter is one of the long ones. Enjoy!
“Free my father,” said Draco, and when Harry didn’t answer he smiled. “But you can’t do that, so I want nothing, Harry.” He stepped closer and let his head fall on his shoulder. “Just be here for a moment.”
“Oh, shut up,” said Harry. He started pushing his laughing friends towards the exit. “Now leave, will you?"
George waved a hand in dismissal. “We aren’t part of the elite, the
“Harry,” called Draco, drawing his gaze from his lips to his eyes. They weren’t dancing anymore.
She looked sad, and Harry frowned, trying to ask her what was wrong. But Hermione yelled at him to go to bed and because he didn’t want to piss her off more, he started heading up the stairs.
. So you can go back before someone sees you.”
Harry grimaced. It was the truth, Trelawney had been a train wreck during classes, but there was another professor that had been a mess too. "Draco, do you think, er, that Hagrid-"
“For the Patronus?” clarified Harry. He felt terribly curious about it, especially after Draco had only called the memory ridiculous. Perhaps it was riding a broom for the first time? Harry had tried that one with Lupin and the man hadn't approved.
Harry shrugged. “That’s what your mom calls you."
Harry shrugged. "Not that strong."
are one to talk about favouritism,” grinned Draco, before a slight frown set on his face. “That’s why I was sure Dumbledore would pick you. You have always been his golden boy."
but Harry felt reassured enough to go with Hermione's plan.
Harry licked his lips, "Er, it's kind of a long story. I-."
him?” Sirius huffed a laugh. “It’s precisely for this sort of thing, Harry. Just like Dung. All Snivellus is good for is letting us know what Voldemort might be up to or not, and because the Malfoys used to be part of that circle, now he can tell us about them too. And, in his words, they have been set aside. The only one in trouble is Lucius, but come on, he had it coming.”
Harry frowned. “Alright, sure, but I think we should do the offensive spells first."
, said the grating voice in his head.
Viktor came to walk beside him, and his serious eyes shone when they noticed the pin on Harry’s shirt. He clasped a hand on his shoulder, giving him a strong squeeze. “Good,” he grunted. “Very good.”
Harry grinned. “Try not to get too bored without me.”
“Pufferfish spines,” said Harry, as a manner of greeting.
"Then it's you being slow?" said Harry, smiling when Draco, also predictably, huffed. "Didn't think so. I need to watch you do it, let's see…"  Draco jumped when a rather creepy looking dummy wheeled closer, a wand on its hand already raised in preparation. "It's just the Room," explained Harry, trying to hide his amusement.
Blaise blinked. “Well, I haven’t gone on any dates with Draco.”
“Alright, so I shouldn’t do what I want,” said Harry with fake dejection, and Draco scowled at him even more. Harry just looked back at him without saying anything, watching as his boyfriend’s resolve cracked.
“Hullo,” he greeted.
Lupin raised an eyebrow. “Like a double agent?”
“How is it my fault?”
“That's fair.”
over the dinner table, which was completely stacked with a generous banquet. Apart from the Weasleys and Sirius; Lupin, Tonks, Kingsley, Mundungus and even Moody had shown up.
“Oh, please,” huffed Ron. He shook his head in exasperation. “Quit it, we have played chess together and today you stopped Harry from dragging us to the Ministry.” He gave Draco a lopsided grin. “Just call me Ron.”
Nott wasn’t in the Slytherin table either. His father had been seen and was on the run along with others like Bellatrix. But Lucius hadn’t had the same luck. “Shit, Parkinson, where is he?” he asked. “Is he okay?”
Hermione gaped at him as if looking for something to say, but when she and Harry crossed gazes she let out a laugh, that turned into a fit the other two joined in. The rest of the table gave them weird looks and Neville silently pushed a glass of water towards them when Ron started coughing, having started laughing in the middle of a bite.
public meeting against Umbridge? No, I don’t think I do."
"The Seekers take a turn! They are neck to neck now! Looks like the snitch- MERLIN’S PANTS! That was a close one!"
“Godric...” Sirius stopped next to a familiar location. The door to the shop was busted, the floor covered by broken glass. “Those bastards really took Ollivander."
Harry sighed. Ron had a point, they had nothing better to do. “Fine. Then, last night I dreamt about moving down a hallway."
The silver eyes narrowed, the pale eyebrows over them furrowing into a slight frown. “Just shut up and kiss me, Harry,” demanded Draco.
He looked at Draco again, the question he had been about to utter dying on his throat when he saw his eyes, because they suddenly looked too
“Liar!” yelled Umbridge, violently throwing him to the floor. Harry's head hit the desk painfully, but now he could see the office clearly. Umbridge was standing in front of him, pointing her wand at him in a clear threat, and in a corner of the room stood Parkinson, holding Hermione by the arm while her dark eyes were fixed on Harry in annoyment. The door opened seconds later, and in walked more members of the Squad. Warrington dragged Ron inside by the shoulder and was followed by Nott and Bulstrode pointing their wands at the backs of Neville and Ginny.
“Come on, you two.” Sirius placed a hand on his shoulder, breaking Harry’s rather depressing line of thought. His other hand rested on Remus’ back. “We can’t stay here too long.”
“Or he’s just insane,” proposed Ron, grinning when Harry frowned at him. “And you are a bit insane too, going with his whims like that."
“Wait,” said Hermione, leaning in with a serious look. “Are you going to backstab her?"
“Charming,” deadpanned Draco. He straightened his back and raised their joined hands, then looking at Harry. “Ready?"
But the thought of Malfoy waking up naked and searching for his clothes is too...odd, and Harry feels strangely flustered on his behalf. He scoops up the shoes as well and walks back, trying to ignore that the pile of folded clothes on his hands has to include Malfoy’s underwear as well. Unless he went without it which makes it worse.
And Harry had been ready to take a page out of Hermione's book and punch the blond’s pointy face, but then his brain processed the message and he felt like he had been the one punched instead.
“Yes,” admitted Harry. “But I also wanted you to meet him, you know, as my godfather and all."
Harry looked down at the small box of toffees, a smile growing on his lips. “Thank you, guys,” he said. “I think he will like them.”
,” huffed Draco. He glanced around one more time before tugging Harry closer. “Just one, alright?” he whispered, cupping his face with a hand. “And then you go." Once Harry nodded, Draco closed the distance, the soft brush of his lips on Harry’s hesitant, slow and gone too quickly.
The last ones to arrive were the Creevey brothers, Fred, George, Lee Jordan and Luna, who wandered in with her usual dreamy look. If she hadn’t told Harry she planned to come, he would have wondered if she had gotten lost.
“No, it’s got nothing to do with you,” hurried Harry, backing up when Draco looked affronted. “I mean, there’s nothing wrong with us, or you, or anything.” He rubbed his neck. “It’s about someone else.”
His godfather nodded. “Yeah, I get it, you don’t have to make excuses for him. I’m not sorry that Lucius Malfoy will rot in Azkaban, but I’m sure that my dear cousin is greatly saddened and all that, if he's anything like Narcissa.” The man raised a hand to scratch his ear in a dog-like way. “That’s one terrible family, but they are undeniably obsessed with each other, which is why I was so surprised to hear he did what he did.” Sirius smiled. “I was wrong about him, he really did end up choosing the right side.”
” said the blond when he recovered.
And also, fun fact: I love dragons. That's one of the reasons The Goblet of Fire is my favourite movie.
He had been surprised when Draco, of all people, gifted him a children’s book for his birthday. The blond had explained in his letter that the Tales were a matter of common knowledge, and he couldn’t let Harry remain ‘
Hagrid laughed, explaining that it was just a superstition, which wasn’t surprising considering what other things the woman said. “Now, who can tell me why some people can see ‘em, and others can’t?"
“Maybe it’s a good thing.” Harry bit another piece of tart calmly while the entire table looked at him weirdly, and passed it down before continuing, “Defense teachers only last one year, maybe we can get rid of him for good.”
"I thought I saw you," blurted out Harry.
On his way down, Harry passed by a still bitter-looking but more subsided Ginny, that sat with her arms crossed on a couch listening to Ron’s whispers. Hermione waited for him by the entrance and told him to be careful before he left.
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him but didn’t say anything else, which was odd. Harry opened his mouth to ask about it, but then remembered something else. “Have any of you seen-?"
Harry didn’t know what to do, so he just offered a hand, “Just so you know, I’m a terrible dancer."
Draco scoffed at her and then sat next to Harry. The relieved expression on his eyes hardened as he noticed his bandaged arm and the scratches on his face. “What happened?” he demanded, grabbing one of Harry’s hands between his. “No one would tell us anything, they just whisked you away.”
“You can’t do that!” protested Fred.
Consciousness comes back to him slowly the next morning. There’s a weight on his chest and something soft under his palm. Still half-sleep, he strokes it, feeling strands of- He frowns, that’s not fur, it’s longer and more delicate. His hand travels down, trying to reach its end, and then there are no more strands, but smooth skin, warm at the touch, and there’s also a low sound, pleased and entirely human.
“I’m fine with it." The group turned towards the one that had said that, and Fay, in her usual bravery, only gave them a shrug. “Everyone should be welcome," she said, and Lavender and Parvati raised an eyebrow at her, then turning to look at Zabini, who smiled at them.
It was as if a dam was broken. The room was possibly noisier as apparently, half the people in the room had a secret crush on a member of their rival house.
“Goodbye, Harry,” offered Dudley.
“It’s
"He put himself there."
Ron showed them the class schedule. “Check for yourself."
“Harry."
“The Unforgivable Curses...” said Hermione, eyes widening when the beetle inside the jar jumped. “He tried them on the spider. Parkinson, why-?”
Harry halted on his steps and looked around the corner. A tall Slytherin girl glared at a Durmstrang student, who stood next to a column and kept stealing glances at her friend, a smaller Ravenclaw girl.
Harry gritted his teeth in annoyance. “I already told you I’m solving it tomorrow. Merlin, can you just calm down?” he huffed.
“No one has won me over, alright?”
“Don’t you want to hear about the Egg?” tried Harry.
Harry could only stare at him, noticing how his pale cheeks were red by the cold and wondering why that looked good when it must hurt. “Er-” he mumbled smartly, not sure of why he had called after him.
But Malfoy merely scoffs. “Because you always do what I want. We are not
funny.”
“N.E.W.Ts have me by the neck,” grimaced Cedric, sharing a few more words with Harry before going to sit with the Ravenclaws.
“I do, but you told me I couldn’t continue unless I got an
. Defeated again.”
, then their sides were not the same.
Ron grimaced at the name. “We don’t know, mate."
"No, you don't," said Draco, and Harry's head sagged to the floor.
Draco's silver eyes narrowed, hard like steel and directed at him. "For the same reason you didn't tell me
wouldn’t want one, but what about you, Ronnie?" He turned towards Ron with a grin, “You don’t have a
even, probably due to the absence of Snape. There was also an extraordinary smell, so wonderful that Harry caught himself following it all the way to a table next to a golden cauldron.
“No, thanks,” said Harry.
"WHAT?" The entire room turned to look at them at Hermione's outburst and the girl just gave them a polite nod that made Harry snort. She glared at him and cleared her throat. "I mean,
“Yes, well, I’m not good company right now,” muttered Draco, eyes fixed on the mirror above the sink. His fingers expertly fixed his hair, which didn’t need any fixing in the first place, and Harry allowed himself to watch him for a moment before retorting.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Maybe because you two were in the library."
Harry blinked. “Who?"
Fred and George shared a hushed conversation with Mundungus, while Ron talked to Bill about his broom, very excitedly. "It can go from nought to seventy in ten seconds, not bad at all, isn’t it?"
Harry blinked. “Sure,” he managed, feeling as if struck. “Whenever you want."
Harry had rushed to write back, a tight feeling on his chest as he whispered several curses. He hated it all. Hated Voldemort for creating this hateful war, Lucius for getting involved, the Ministry just because, and also himself for not being able to be there when Draco needed him.
“Did you listen to a word I
. Wasn’t that such a word? The first thing that popped up in Harry’s mind were Draco’s lips after kissing; red, wet and parted in a white grin… “No!” His throat had gone dry. “No, we haven’t done, er, no.”
It makes Harry feel irritated. “Why would I do that?”
The reaction was instant. Some present gasped, others exchanged nervous glances between them, and everyone seemed more engaged.
The blond looked away, grabbing the towel off his shoulder and fiddling with it. He cleared his throat, “We should leave before a Prefect decides to take a bath,” he said, making way to the door. Before exiting, he added, “I’ll keep an eye out.”
The world seemed to slow down as Draco turned around. Harry held his breath, because he had dreamed of this moment to the point it was embarrassing, of the moment his silver eyes found him and everything would be fine again.
Beat him.
Fred and George whistled.
Mrs Weasley opened and closed her mouth, exchanging a look with her husband. "I'm lost," she admitted.
Ron grinned. “I am too,” he declared. “Harry is going to coddle
Sirius rushed in moments later. “Are you okay?” he asked, and when Harry assured him that nothing had happened, he settled before the chimney and sent him a weird look. “Is this about my cousin?”
“Who is it?” asked Mrs Weasley with a smile. “Do we know her?"
Mrs Weasley blinked. “Oh, no dear. I’m sorry. It’s just very neat today."
“I meant the expression,” said Harry with an eye roll. “And they have other ones, like movies.” Of course, Draco scrunched his nose at the foreign word and Harry laughed. “I’ll show you one day, maybe during summer.”
“What?!” Harry looked at Ron in alarm. “What jinxes? Is Draco okay?”
“Draco,” called Hermione, making the blond look at her in surprise. The girl seemed to notice her slip up, but continued nonetheless, “About Nott...”
“I wasn’t going to,” protested Harry, despite having been a second away from proposing the very same thing. He drummed his fingers on the table, lasting exactly ten seconds before leaning in and asking Hermione, “What do you think he wants?"
Not even now, three days later during lunch. He chewed his food carefully, pretending not to see her narrowed eyes and pursed lips. Hermione wore the same expression of determination she had when learning a new spell, or working through an essay. She was looking at Harry like the riddle they faced during First Year, which was a scary prospect because she had worked through that one very quickly.
Later, when the aftertaste of the Halloween Feast grew bitter on his mouth, when the Goblet selected a fourth name and every eye in the room turned to him, Harry would have to disagree with Seamus. No, a Gryffindor Champion would
"No, it's not fine," said Draco. His silver eyes glanced around their empty surroundings before he leaned forwards to give Harry a quick kiss. It was short and gentle, like the smile he gave him afterwards. "I do like them. Thank you, Harry," he said and then grinned at him. "By the way, who gave you that scarf? It looks good on you."
"Right." Draco looked away. "I was just leaving," he said, making way the door.
Harry looked across the field towards the Slytherin stands. The emerald crowd was bumbling with activity, because if Gryffindor lost this match, Slytherin would be taking the Cup. Their last match against Hufflepuff had been a difficult one, due to their captain Montague still being in the Hospital Wing after the vanishing cabinet incident, but they had ended up winning thanks both to Crabbe and Goyle, that had plummeted Zacharias Smith with so many bludger hits that it even distracted Cedric, and to Draco, who had used that split second to his advantage and snatched the snitch and the victory for Slytherin.
Harry opened his mouth to protest, to tell Cedric he should grab it, or that they should grab it together. But, “I promised someone I would win,” he confessed, feeling uncertain “Are you sure it’s alright?”
Harry nodded in agreement. He did feel a bit guilty about the pile of homework waiting for him, but it was such a good day and flying sounded absolutely amazing.
“Hi, Neville. Hi, Luna, you have been spending too much time with Parkinson,” said Harry, making her laugh softly.
" he repeated.
“Zabini looks at everyone as if they were dirt under his shoe, Parkinson tells everyone they are dirt under her shoe, and I don’t have to explain
“Sod off, Malfoy,” muttered Ron. He frowned at Harry, “Why does he have to be here?”
to the list”.
“You knew?!” exclaimed Ginny. They all shrugged.
“He’s not a bad captain,” said Draco, one of his hands going up to Harry’s hair. “It’s getting long again.” He hummed and then frowned when Harry bit his own lip. “What is it?”
thought Harry.
“You will see, Weasley.” With those parting words, Draco turned to walk inside the room, Crabbe and Goyle on tail. Harry, Ron and Hermione followed and the latter two couldn't help but looked surprised when the Slytherins went to sit with Parkinson and Zabini.
Harry took another bite of tart to avoid answering, but his silence was mistaken for embarrassment and soon enough Sirius was joining in. "Yes, Harry, why not invite dear Draco over for your birthday? We are throwing a party."
, yes,” said Harry sternly, turning to look at the circle again. The crowd was starting to disperse and Umbridge had stormed off, leaving only Dumbledore speaking with Firenze, who had remained aloof during the entire exchange. “Actually, I think you might have seen him before too. Remember the forest in our first year?”
“But?” asked Harry.
"We're workin' in here today!" said Hagrid, smiling as he pointed at the forest behind him. "They prefer the dark!"
“Ronald!” hissed Hermione.
Ginny laughed. “Oh, you should have seen it. There was a scuffle at the end because the Slytherins were angry about losing the cup, and the entire Inquisitorial Squad got jinxed-”
Harry walked down the halls with renewed anger. Just when he had finally come to terms with being ignored, some unknown Hufflepuff had come out with the bright idea of badges.
“Luna, please move.” Draco’s voice was steady again, not matching the way he hurried to walk past her once she took a step aside. And just like that he was
“Of course I did. Right away.”
“This brings back memories,” he told Harry when he came to lean on the fence beside him.
“Lunas has him,” answered Harry, then turning to Draco. “And Cepheus too."
“Maybe you should go back to bed after breakfast, we don’t really have anything to do until everyone arrives.” Sirius sounded concerned, so Harry quickly shook his head in dismissal.
“Not much
Surely enough, the robes are still in the same place Malfoy had left them after shrugging them off. It was a smart move, all things considered, as Harry supposed one wouldn’t want to wake up to destroyed clothes every morning.
Harry felt his face heat up. “We are friends, right?”
It was late when Harry walked into the common room, feeling as if something was once again escaping him. He sat on the couch next to his friends, their chatter background noise as he tried to put his thoughts in order. There was something bothering Draco, he was sure of that. The issue was
This time, he didn't turn back when Malfoy called him and grinned to himself for small victories.
Malfoy looked uncomfortable now. “Unless she was right this time and you really are a twelve-year-old jumping to his death at any chance,” he added.
“Listen.” Sirius walked them up the stairs. “Dung is useful to have around, he knows people and places we don’t, but he’s also an absolute imbecile, so don’t let him get to you, okay?”
Sirius gave him a thin smile. “I understand if you don’t want to,” he said, looking uncertain. “It’s not exactly a good place, and Kreacher is just a vermin, but-"
In the end, Diggory seemed to believe him, and even added an apology about the badges, which Harry dismissed before making his way back.
Harry cut him off again. “It doesn’t matter what you should do! Draco,” he took in another breath. “Is it what you want to do? Because if it is I will accept it, even if I hate it, and I’ll still be here for you, but please, just tell me,” He raised on his knees to grab the blond by the shoulders, “Is that what you want?”
Harry really didn’t want to do that, the bitter dust tasted almost like coffee and seemed like a warning for whatever was below it, but Draco was looking at him expectantly so Harry summoned his Gryffindor bravery and sank his teeth on it.
“You can’t advertise for testers in the Common Room,” cut in Hermione, frowning at the twins. “Take your posters down, or I-"
Harry was getting more confused by the second. "Did you want me to tell her?"
Harry flushed. “Shut up."
public meeting?” Ron nodded and Draco tilted his head to the side, looking like the picture of someone in deep thought. “I wonder if I did," he mused after a while.
“As a captain, your team will look up to you, so it’s important to show fairness and respect, both with your own team as with others. Although,” Remus smiled at him. “I suppose there won’t be much trouble with the Slytherin team, right?”
"I like you, Draco," he said. "And I like you a lot."
“...You think so?”
They stepped back into the Entrance Hall, Draco telling him what he knew about his grandfather. Harry learned that Fleamont was the son of Henry Potter, a prominent member of the Wizengamot. Before Harry could ask more about him, a loud discussion reached their ears. They looked at each other, both recognising the voices of Harry’s best friends.
"Don't call me that.” The startlement in Dudley’s face made Harry grimace and explain, "It’s what my boyfriend calls me."
Harry wasn’t surprised when he found Malfoy already there, because he was always there, but he was surprised when the blond turned towards him and scowled darkly, killing Harry’s greeting before it could cross his lips.
“I do,” said Harry sincerely, feeling as if he were about to fly away. “It means a lot to me, Draco. Thank you.”
Harry had to stop looking at the exchange when he was tackled from behind by the rest of the team and pushed into a loud celebration. He quickly noticed the absence of Ron, who was making his way out of the field alone.
Ron looked at them in confusion. “What’s the big deal? Just sneak to Hogsmeade tomorrow and get him something. Like a vial of poison.”
“How would we know?” said Ron. “You are the only one that has been through that, you tell us.”
“Sure.” Harry sighed. “I seriously hate that woman."
Harry smiled, eyes fixed on the letter as he lightly swayed back on the swing. The heat of the day was finally retreating, but it also meant the light would be gone soon as well. He wanted to finish reading Draco’s letter before he had to return.
And the fact that he hadn’t slept much last night due to another dream of the corridor wasn’t helping. He dragged his hand over his face forcefully and tried to focus on the tenth question. It was about the International Confederation of Wizards.
“You think this is about you?” hissed Draco, holding his gaze with steel-like eyes. “Do you know what would happen if they found
Harry saw him meet his mother. Narcissa Malfoy was still the picture of prim and proper, not a hair out of place nor a single wrinkle on her clothes, but the way her pretty features were pulled down revealed her sadness. Seeing her next to Draco, the resemblance was painfully striking.
“But,” Hermione’s hands were clasped in front of her, “Harry, it
“Weren’t you going to buy sweets for your mom?”
Harry stopped him by the arm. “Draco," he said, eyes fixed on the other's face. "Are you alright?"
Harry let himself be guided to the Three Broomsticks in silence, trying to bring down the anger that had once again risen. The reason Cho had gotten angry at Cedric was that he had interrupted their date, something so common even Harry was aware of it and so different to the reason Draco had walked away without even bothering to protect himself against the rain. They couldn’t have that normalcy, and that made envy growl at Harry’s chest.
“But you don’t have to,” retorted Harry. His hands clenched and unclenched at his sides as he refrained from reaching for him. “I- Alright, fine, I promised I would accept your decision, but now what?” Draco seemed unfazed and Harry stepped closer. “
“Oh, right.” Draco pulled back a little so Harry could look at him properly and notice the silver and emerald badge pinned to his robes, just next to the silver constellation pin.
“Those are the ones that will show up on the exams, you know,” pointed Harry.
The halls of Hogwarts were still mostly empty, as the first and second years mostly remained in their common rooms and the older students hadn’t returned from Hogsmeade yet. Harry’s steps echoed around him as he made way to the library, shaking off the remaining drops of water from his clothes. The Impervius Charm had made most of them bounce off, but some had grouped together in the creases, making small pools.
“When?” blurted out Harry.
Myrtle let out a sigh. “Yes, handsome Cedric Diggory. It took him so long to figure it out that the bubbles disappeared... You should try it too, Harry."
But he didn’t, because he saw the way Draco sucked in a breath as if hurt, and then he felt even more disheartened when Draco’s voice trembled when he spoke. "I'm not a-"
Harry panicked. “No, of course not. You are always-." He halted his explanation when Draco started laughing and gave him a light shove. “You are a git."
“There’s no one but Kreacher!” said the elf with delight, letting out another laugh. “Kreacher is alone. Master has gone! Master won’t return from the Department of Mysteries!” With that, the elf scurried away, back to the shadows he came from.
“Because it’s
“To backstab her, yes.” Draco fluttered his eyes open and grinned at him. “I still think it’s a barbaric expression, but I have to admit it's oddly fitting.”
expensive and a green tone that resulted familiar.
"Oh, sorry. Wrong compartment,” she said. Then, an idea seemed to cross her mind, because she pointed at Draco. “Is your birthday on the 5th of June, by any chance?”
Before Harry could make his presence known, the blond turned around, and their eyes met again, startling both of them.
That made her look up. “I’m not
“Interhouse unity?” tried Ron, scowling at Zabini when he grimaced.
“Yes, well, I’m a Gryffindor, Malfoy,” said Harry, reluctantly letting go of his hand. “It’s what we do."
“Shut up."
“Potter,” he called. “I
"There's nothing to talk about with her," said Hermione disdainfully, which surprised Harry, because the girl had once gone on and on about the importance of International Magic Cooperation.
"Really?" Harry asks once he walks in and sees Malfoy on the old bed, long body curled up and moon eyes looking up at Harry. "Of course you wouldn't just sleep on the floor," he says, and the wolf yawns again.
“Wouldn’t it be the other way?” said Ron, immediately receiving a withering glance. “We wanted to tell you, mate."
Feeling like an intruder among the warm reunion, Harry took the first chance to leave the table once dinner was over. He didn't feel like returning to his bedroom, so he wandered around the house, once again noticing the distinct absence of Kreacher. The elf had been missing since they arrived, after he had started badmouthing everyone and Sirius yelled at him to get out of the kitchen. The way the elf had looked pleased to do so didn’t sit well with Harry, but Sirius was convinced he was just hiding in the attic.
“What’s wrong, Seamus?” asked Ron, when the boy plopped down on the bench near them.
“Fourteen years,” answered Snape. His voice was bored but knowing the man, it was clear he was hating her presence.
“The Dark Lord is skilled in Legilimency, which as you probably don’t know, it’s the ability that lets you extract memories and feelings from another person’s mind-"
“Alright,” conceded Draco, sounding a bit strained. “
Draco shook his head. “No, don’t write, I’ll see you at school,” he said, and turned towards the alley and walked in without another word.
Harry stood up, taking his wand and not knowing what to do with it.
“Harry, my boy!” greeted Slughorn. “It’s good to see you! And you must be Mr Longbotton!”
“Don’t worry,” grinned Harry. “I’ll protect you from the
"Scared?"
“Do you want my opinion or not?” hissed Hermione. “The tournament is a serious matter, Harry. Especially since someone wanted you in it. I think you should have started to prepare for the Second Task long ago. You have been rather careless.”
“Wonderful question, Harry.” Blaise’s eyes were fixed on the corridor ahead as he and Harry walked through quickly. “All I know is that I don’t hear from him all summer, and when I do see him he is in our compartment listening to Greg go on about The Quibbler instead of being in your compartment snogging you.”
Draco placed a finger on his lips, “I know” he said. His hand cupped Harry’s face as he looked sadly into his eyes. “I know it’s not going to be easy, Harry, but I want to try.” He gave him an uncertain look. “Do you?”
"To ask about Vincent's swing?"
“Because you wanted me to,” protests Harry. Because that was the reason, the wolf had growled at him not to go.
“Practising,” answered Ron, shoving Harry to start walking. “Wanna come?"
Ron and her looked expectantly at him.
Right. Harry had seen her in the Pensieve, chained but proud of her allegiance to Voldemort. And she was Draco’s aunt. “What about that burn?” asked Harry, not wanting to think much of that.
The only problem with the increasing amount of shared kisses was
Sirius scoffed. “That figures. Our information tells us Fudge doesn’t want you trained in combat."
“Yeah. We don’t talk much,” explained Harry. “I mean, we aren’t really friends.”
That made him pause.  It was true Draco hadn’t levitated anyone as his father had done, but there was no denying he had been pretty awful. Feeling a sliver of hope, Harry asked them, “But he grew out of it?”
“No,” cut in Hermione immediately. “I don’t need help."
Malfoy-
“Parkinson, we have to talk-”
she is convinced you have"
Harry laughed, keeping pace with him. “Come on."
For a moment there was stunned silence as the flames consumed the paper and Harry looked at Draco, waiting for his reaction.
,” said Harry, laughing when Draco turned on his heel to walk away. He followed, standing by the centre. “Alright, alright. We will start after the holidays."  Draco looked back at him but didn’t move. “Okay?” added Harry, extending a hand. “Now dance with me a bit more."
“Prefects can confiscate possessions if they are prohibited-"
Draco seemed caught off guard, and Hermione took advantage of that to add, “And call me Hermione.” She shrugged. “I mean, we have studied together.”
a fugitive." Harry sighed and passed a hand through his hair. “You really shouldn’t have come here, Sirius."
“Alright.”
"Didn't you go into the sewers to fight an honest-to-god
They fell into an easy talk, Hermione taking some notes to start making a schedule since the holidays were approaching and they would have to take a break. “Then we could get started on the Patronus by April, but-,” she paused, looking at him in alarm when voices started approaching, one of them sounding very posh and very irritated.
“I have to write, well, that,” said Harry, referring to the
friends,” said Hermione. “But both of us care about Harry, which is why we are no longer enemies."
be giving me criticism on names? Didn’t you just call your owl
As if hearing his thoughts, Malfoy threw Harry a disdainful glare over his shoulder before walking down the stairs. And Harry felt the rush of familiar anger that came with it. Because it was
Without hearing more of them, the Headmaster descended the steps once again, his robes flowing behind him and then there was a loud popping noise and he was gone. Sirius didn’t waste another second and dragged Harry inside.
Harry hummed. “I don’t know,” he said. “I mean, I do know but it’s hard to explain. I know it’s not going to be as simple as it should be, but-” He felt a bit embarrassed. “I just think that I'm okay with that if it's him."
They sat side by side at the stone bench, Harry in silence while Draco repeated what his mother had said. That his father had been caught at the Ministry, unconscious due to a spell, that he had been aided and immediately rushed into a cell, that his trial would be during summer. "And both of us will go," finished Draco, eyes cast down. "How can I look at him, knowing I put him there?"
“Flattery,” mused Draco. He directed Harry a white grin. “Keep it up. Do you agree with what they said?”
“Thanks,” said Harry, taking a bite. It was sweet.
because you promised that you
thought Harry, eyeing a customer whose face was fully covered by bandages. He turned to look at Hermione, who was moving chairs to open space by a corner of the room. “How many people are we expecting, exactly?"
“What are you doing?”
Hermione frowned. "I wasn’t screaming, and you can’t deduct points from other Prefects."
“Wait.” Angelina raised a hand as if to stop him, even when he wasn't saying anything. “You are telling me that
"No, Harry," whispered the blond urgently, holding onto him as if drowning. "You don't understand. My father-" He brought a hand to his mouth. "Merlin, what am I doing?"
“I thought you had cancelled your subscription,” said Sirius with a slight frown.
“Just get to the point,” said Angelina impatiently.
name again. But Hermione had been there, her presence a call to order. She had sat them down and demanded Harry told them everything.
"Is it gone?" whispered Malfoy.
Ron shrugged. “We figured they must be good if a posh git like him likes them."
Harry snorted. “Well, get used to it.” He tapped his fingers on his cup and looked towards the Slytherin table again, where Draco was reading from a book instead of having lunch despite Parkinson’s pestering. “Yeah, you two better get used to it.”
Draco wasn’t smiling as much as he used to in the last months, not even in the last years. He was a quiet presence that accompanied the Slytherins, looking as regal and indifferent as Zabini. There were no white grins, no malicious snickering, not even when Crabbe managed to trip Neville during Potions and the boy’s cauldron spilt all over the floor, and all the Slytherins laughed.
Harry wasn’t prepared at all. He had been mostly joking, but now that he could see the extension of pale skin bared for him, he couldn’t help but kiss it again, just below the ear. Draco tightened his grip on his shirt and let out a groan, the sound making Harry’s blood rush and, out of an impulse, he stuck his tongue out and tasted his skin.
Hope you liked it! See you on Thursday!
“Right, okay." It was the usual.
The last time Harry saw Lucius Malfoy look puzzled had been three years ago after Harry freed Dobby with a sock. There were no house-elves present at the moment but Lucius still blinked at him in surprise, his grey eyes then narrowing in suspicion.
“Terence Higgs too!”
“It’s… an invitation from Slughorn. He wants us to go to his compartment.” Harry passed Neville his parchment and pondered about ripping his own to pieces. He had no intention to go
It was what Harry had been waiting for, in some way, because the answer was out before he could think of it. “I can get them back.”
, Harry," he said, voice open in a way that cooled Harry down better than the freezing rain. "You can't ask me to stand still and watch something that will damage him, knowing I did
“What are you two doing?” said a third voice. They looked up to find an irritated Trelawney looking down at them. From their position on the floor, the woman looked very tall and menacing.
?” hissed Vernon, while Petunia muffled a horrified gasp behind her hand.
“Show off,” repeated Draco. He looked up at the ceiling and let out a long sigh. “This is a bit tiring, isn’t it?"
Draco’s hands were gentle on his hair, and Harry felt he could fall asleep like that if it weren’t for the way his heartbeat refused to slow down. He couldn’t help but let out a pleased sigh when Draco’s fingers accidentally brushed his hair without the towel and watched happily as the other smiled.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “The House separation is just a system, Ron. It was meant to encourage healthy competition, not feuds between students. Many muggle schools do it as well, the difference is that they encourage Inter-House unity. Hogwarts has forgotten that part, and instead lets the animosity between houses be overblown to this level.”
“That hurt,” he said and Draco pressed a kiss to the spot, his soft lips calming the pain his teeth had left and trailing up. Harry let his hand fall to the blond’s waist, finding bare skin from where Draco’s black shirt had ridden up.
Unfortunately, Harry didn’t have time to enjoy it because at that same moment the door opened quite loudly, making him snap his gaze towards it. A younger student stood there, one hand on the knob as her face began to turn red, her mouth opening and closing like a fish out of the water.
"See you later," said Harry, while Draco just nodded silently, eyes going back to the list once the doors shut close. Draco read it to himself until something made him stop.
As usual, the dinner prepared by Mrs Weasley had been wonderful, but Harry hadn’t been able to enjoy it. The prospect of telling them all was terrifying, but he
Harry looked at him seriously. “That would be a tragedy."
Malfoy sniffed. "To be fair, being a careless idiot while brewing could get you killed."
Harry raised his own wand. For the rest of the hour, he continued to steal glances against his better judgment, but Draco never looked back.
“Harry, what about the properties?” said Ron, eyes glued on his half done essay. “I only have ‘
“Your name was once there too, Sirius,” said Harry as he placed a hand over his boyfriend’s name protectively.
"Yes," said Harry, eyes tracing the parchment. "You should be able to get to the Tower without any problem."
Dumbledore gave him an odd smile. "We have plenty of things to discuss, Harry, but," the Headmaster glanced up at the doorway, "for now, you should go with your friends."
acting proactively against Voldemort, it’s just that he is also attempting to portray this
Hermione crossed her arms. “And why is that?”
He took a deep steadying breath, put on his pyjamas, got under the covers and resisted the impulse to take the pin out of his trunk and cradle it to his chest. Instead, he glared furiously at the ceiling of his bed as if it could provide him with the answers he desperately needed.
“Nice offer, but,” Sirius snatched the paper, folded it and placed it in the front pocket of Harry’s jacket. Then, he put an arm around his shoulders and turned to the tapestry. “Moony already did it for us. Now, have I told you about my uncle Alphard? He wasn’t that bad. I actually introduced him to your dad once, we ran into each other in Diagon Alley and...“
Perhaps the only Slytherin discontent with the article was Theodore Nott. Harry had not taken his father’s name out of his testimony, and even if it had been done due to them not being friends, he wouldn’t deny feeling satisfied by his irritation. Ron had suggested he had changed from one Slytherin rival to another and Harry had shoved him off the sofa. The only thing about Nott he cared about was that he had somehow made Draco feel troubled, which was more than enough to dislike him, he was not a rival and definitely not whatever Draco had been.
- was the Skeeter incident. Draco hadn’t talked to him for a month, but it hadn’t been really out of anger.
“What the-!” The blond brought a hand to his mouth to stifle his own reaction and looked around as if to check no one heard. Going back to Harry, he removed his hand and hissed, “Since when do you have an invisibility cloak? And what are you doing here?”
Harry was just in the middle of helping Colin when he noticed the time, quickly blowing the whistle he had summoned to catch everyone’s attention. “We are doing pretty good,” he said when everyone fell quiet. “But we are out of time for today, so let’s leave it here. Same time next week?"
” muttered Ron.
Ron joined them, complaining about Snape’s bitterness. Hermione shushed him and told him what happened, in an urgent tone.
Malfoy grinned. “I think you will be facing a mandrake next task. Better borrow Sprout’s earmuffs.” He then paused for a moment, thinking. “Or perhaps…”
Moody frowned at him but showed no signs of stopping and Harry started to feel a bit desperate. Next to him, he could see Nott and other Slytherins trying to step forwards, but Moody reeled them back with a dark glare.
That only made the sibling’s snickering grow louder and Harry felt relieved when Mr Weasley walked in to tell him they were leaving.
Lavender and Parvati straight out shrieked, making Dean wince and cover his ears. “How?” asked Lavender, looking fascinated.
move, considering it’s supposed to be a secret."
“Bill and I are getting married!” announced Fleur, raising a hand to show Harry the silver band on one of her fingers.
"You know," Harry gave him a thoughtful look, “Your Patronus
Hagrid seemed even more lost when Harry, Ron and Hermione came to stand next to him, looking at Draco as he walked away.
A hand was placed on his chest, gentle but firm enough to stop him, making Harry realize he had been moving towards one of the voices. He looked up, finding two silver eyes focused on him before Draco sent a nasty glance to a nearby group and grabbed one of Harry’s hands firmly, “Let’s take a walk, shall we?"
Everyone booed.
Parkinson seemed delighted. “If that’s the case, Potter is going to freeze to death waiting."
He mostly felt like shit. “Class is going to suck,” he said, taking his glasses off to drag a hand across his face. He probably looked as bad as he felt.
“He’s not one of us!” hissed Nott, turning his gaze to Draco again, head low like a creature ready to strike. “He’s just a fucking traitor-”
"So why don't you ask
Draco eyed Parkinson carefully. “Right, and what are
"I helped."
in past tournaments,” hissed Draco, definitely not amused. “Why are you being so careless? Do you want to prove Skeeter right?”
That appeased Fleur, and she and Bill exchanged a few more pleasantries with Harry before moving on to the rest of the crowd. On his part, Harry walked back to the table, where Fred and George were speaking with Mundungus yet again.
Harry exchanged another look with Ron, who had paused on his munching. “Mione, you just called him by his name.”
Harry was impressed, but Draco seemed thoroughly bored as he looked around, eyes lazily wandering around the room. Knowing him, he probably had ten bathrooms double the size at home, the git.
"Davies scores!” exclaimed Lee. “That is fifty-thirty to Ravenclaw!"
Lee Jordan’s booming voice announcing the entrance of the teams saved Harry from having to come up with an answer, but even then he found himself looking for one.
"Disarming," said Harry, grinning when Draco scrunched his nose in distaste. "It's useful."
George shrugged. “I mean, I have seen it happen."
the issue. He gave his friends another look, finding a firm nod from Hermione and a grimace from Ron. Harry cleared his throat. “It’s Draco. Er, Draco Malfoy."
“This is yours,” said Harry in confusion.
“I didn’t, but he also didn’t ask and Kreacher was already at the Manor when I arrived, so the occasion never arose.” Draco gave him a little smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “It’s better this way, Scarhead, so don’t say anything, alright?” The blond blinked. “Thinking about it, I shouldn’t even be here right now. “
funny, Ronald,” said Hermione acidly, nose scrunched in distaste. Harry raised an eyebrow at her but Hermione only looked away and picked a box from a nearby shelf. “So funny, Ron Weasley.”
Harry’s eyes went to Draco, but his were fixed on a book, apparently not interested in the potion nor him. It made Harry look down at his table, feeling the hole on his chest grow, biting at the flesh around it.
Cho's friend, whose name was something along the lines of Mariella, had wisely chosen not to stand near them and instead frowned at everyone else from another corner. She didn't look happy at all.
with no apparent reason, and then acted
But Draco didn’t give him time. “You said you would accept this if it was what I wanted.” There was an edge to his tone now. “Remember?”
. So, you have to tell me, have you heard anything? Does the Order know anything?”
“You?- Oh, right, sorry,” said Ron quickly. But then he hummed in consideration. “Mate, but maybe we could try to interpret your dreams?"
“He seems fine to me,” said Harry, turning back to his essay. Snape seemed resolved to send them impossible assignments since Harry got a high mark on his armadillo bile essay. Perhaps Malfoy could help him again with this one, about the different ways to use mandrake on antidotes. He would have to ask him the next time they met. Harry had helped him with Transfiguration on Tuesday, so Malfoy owed him.
Harry felt his throat dry, and took a deep breath, summoning all his Gryffindor bravery. But when he looked into the pretty grey eyes he had come to like so much, the words he had wanted to say for a long time finally slipped out easily.
Draco turned his frown to him. "Or perhaps he was just telling you to take a bath."
,” chastised Draco. His eyes went back to the fireplace but left quickly and he gave Harry a thin smile. “And whatever you might think, he is still my friend, and I have to talk to him before he does something crazy like owl my father.”
“Precisely what I have said and even though I can see you both have some opinions on the matter, I’m afraid it’s rather late and I have to return to Hogwarts.” He gave them another smile, but this time Harry thought it didn’t reach his eyes. “I bid you both a good night, and I’ll see you at the start of the term, Harry.”
"Nope, but that's a great suggestion."
Harry shook his head. “That was mostly you. I mean, I hadn’t thought about using the Patronus like that."
knew he was innocent, such a talented boy.”
“No way. Rather die than go with a Slytherin”
Remus cut him off. "Mundungus, that wasn't what happened. Draco was helping Harry and his friends, we misunderstood." The man let out a sigh. "He and Harry are still together."
Draco beamed at him. "Just the timing, Vincent really has quite a swing. We are training Greg too."
“History of Magic, double Potions, Divination, double Defense,” read Ron as they had breakfast. “Binns, Snape, Trelawney and Umbridge in one day. What a good way to start."
They approached the group, finding Draco looking at Luna with a confused expression as the girl talked about something. “And these,” was Draco slowly saying, “
“Hermione, of course.” Ron sniffed. “I would have taken her if she weren’t so proud."
Hermione stopped glaring at the twins, who were in the middle of a demonstration of one of their Skiving Snackboxes, and let out an exasperated sigh. “I can’t, there’s nothing that says they can’t test them on themselves.” She scrunched her nose as George vomited on a bucket again. “And nothing to stop the others from buying them, unless I can prove it’s dangerous."
bruised despite the passing of time. “Oh, hullo, Harry,” he greeted with the quiet voice he had started using since his classes with Umbridge. “What are you doing here?” he asked, then looking at the table and freezing when he saw Draco. “Malfoy.”
“Family is important, Harry,” said Draco softly, looking down at his feet. “I thought you might like to know a bit more about yours.”
is doing
“I can take care of myself.” His tone was harsh again, but this time Draco didn’t take it back. Instead, he tightened his hands in fists and raised his chin, looking cold and defiant in a way Harry hadn’t seen in a while.
“It comes from the idea of attacking someone when they least expect it,” explained Hermione with a small smile. “Or betraying someone when they trust you."
. Apart from training spells for the Third Task, Harry and Hermione would also discuss what Harry should do, and Ron would have to listen to them and complain the entire time.
“You weren’t.” Harry was starting to feel irritated. “It’s hard to explain and I don’t have much time, but he didn’t betray me or the D.A. He is just making Umbridge believe he did.”
Harry gulped down his drink and stood up as well. “It’ll be just for a while,” he assured as they walked towards the front.
Mundungus hiccuped. “Ah!” he let out, chuckling to himself. “I know what might cheer you up, Harry. I have been saving it for you, although you probably have seen it already.” The man began rummaging in his pocket.
“Alright!” came Slughorn’s voice. The man was standing in the doorway, looking breathless. ”I’m probably mad, but I’ll take it!”
“Harry, you have to understand, he was fifteen-”
"But enough to knock you off your broom," pointed out Draco.
When Harry turned around to look at him, the blond was giving him a weird look. "Is there any reason the Gryffindors have been glaring at me all day?"
“No wonder they went out of style,” finished Draco. He took another sip of Butterbeer, carefully avoiding the foam at the top, and then lowered his tankard with a pleased sigh. “This is nice,” he said, looking at Harry with a grin. “Not the best place for a date, but nice enough.”
“Clearly,” mused Draco, making Harry laugh.
Instead of being affronted, the man let out a laugh. “They are always guessing where I am, I’m sure they have no idea."
Blaise gave him a dark glare. “His father is in Azkaban, what do you think?”
?!" repeated Draco. He shook his head. "Not the moment. But yes, you will be getting that all year long. So...?"
are the one asking
, Pansy," said Blaise. "And he's getting worse. I think even his parents have noticed, last week-"
The morning after, Harry, Ron and Hermione woke up late to breakfast due to staying up all night discussing what could have happened at the Ministry. Hermione had turned on the Wireless, but it seemed like nothing had reached the media yet, so they ended up talking while Celestina Warbeck played in the background.
"Gee, thanks," said Harry, a dumb smile threatening to curl up his lips.
“Basically,” said Harry, then frowning at them. “Tell the rest that, and you better stop speaking badly of him, Sirius.”
Rumours about the competition, possible challenges and champions, impressions on the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students, complaints about the age limitation, and more. Overall excitement ran through the different discussions going on at the late hour, the chatter never seeming to die down but becoming bigger and noisier, probably due to the bottles of Butterbeer and Firewhiskey that had appeared at some point.
was next, and Harry wanted more. He pushed further, feeling the small sound the other let out. It was a brief, surprised sound that felt like winning a match. Harry wrapped an arm around Draco, holding him in place as he kissed him. There was another sound, short and pleased. Harry chased it, advancing until there was a sudden halt and the soft lips parted.
Draco eyes narrowed, but before he could say anything, Hermione started dragging Ron away. “Leave them, Ron,” she said, then grinning at Harry. “See you later."
a prat."
Harry had been interested, but he would have prefered to hear the tales from the blond and his posh voice. The sole idea had been something that made him smile to himself a lot, but as he looked at the book now, he only felt desperate. If he got expelled, there was no telling what would happen.
Thanks for reading! As usual, kudos and comments are greatly appreciated! See you on Thursday!
They were interrupted by the sudden scream of a woman that sounded vaguely familiar and stopped to look at each other in confusion, argument forgotten. "Did you see someone on your way down here?" asked Snape with narrowed eyes.
Luna clicked her tongue. “Killjoy,” she said, in a way that was so much like Parkinson that Harry laughed and Neville sent her a wary look.
Sirius' eyebrow twitched. “Yes, precisely."
“A bit weird, though.” Goyle blinked at the staring students. “What’s their problem?"
“I see,” said Angelina, pausing to think for a brief moment before frowning at Harry. “This better not affect your performance, Potter. The first match is against Slytherin and
“These are
“Yeah, it’s ridiculous,” repeated Harry, nodding to himself. But then another thought made him pause and turn towards his friend again. “But yesterday he was a bit quiet."
“NO!” exclaimed the three Gryffindors at the same time. “Sirius, didn’t you read the Daily Prophet today?” said Hermione.
“Keep digging your hole, Draco.”
Ron angrily munched on a turkey leg. “People these days don’t respect tradition.”
They gathered again during dinner after Ron and Hermione had finished their exams, and Harry, Bill and Mrs Weasley had taken another walk around the grounds. In which the woman kept asking Harry about his girlfriend, and Harry kept telling her there was no such girlfriend. Which was true.
“You have quite a collection, Harry,” commented Draco easily as he examined the parchment, calm and perfectly unaware of Hermione's words. “There are some names here I don’t know."
"You have that look in your eyes again, the one you have before you want to do something stupid," said Ron. "I'm gonna regret asking this, but what is it now? If it's following more spiders, I'm out."
“Maybe,” conceded Harry, receiving a glare. "I can’t say much, but perhaps that information could help? Sorry about your friend.”
“Dumbledore dragged him along to convince the man. A smart move from the old fart, I have to admit, since that idiot loves collecting people and Harry would be a fine addition. You too, Hermione,” said Sirius, gesturing at the surprised girl with his glass, “Damn smart you are, like Lily, once Slughorn sees that he will be asking you to join his little Slug club.”
Before Harry could open his mouth to ask anything, a pale finger was pressing it close. He could only stare at Malfoy, who held another finger to his own lips. Shushing him. They were awfully close, and Harry felt heat rising to his cheeks, his heart beating loudly on his chest.
“Honestly.” Hermione crossed her arms and huffed. “She’s so full of herself.”
Draco hummed. “Threatening a prefect? That will be another week then-"
Right until the moment a flash went off, like freezing cold water or a slap to the face. They pulled back, hands still holding on each other, and clenching tightly as they realized who stood in front of them.
“Shouldn’t you have mentioned that earlier?" chastised Ron, letting out a sigh. "Alright, let me see,” he passed the pages of the book again. “Here it is. Doors also mean change. Harry, I think there’s a theme here."
“Oh, shut up,” Harry snapped, but Parvati only sniffed louder and he finally decided he had had enough. “I’m leaving.” He grabbed his bag from the floor and got to his feet. “Might as well get early to class.”
“You need to learn by yourself,” sniffed Hermione, while Zabini asked “Why would I do that?” sounding genuinely baffled.
“Does he always coddle you like that?” asked Hermione after a while.
“Just because,” replied Draco coolly, and his eyes didn’t show a sliver of doubt before he turned around to face the door. “Let’s just leave this here.”
But Nott wasn't alone in his dark mood. Hermione also seemed deeply unhappy with how the article had come up, despite its success, as she still kept giving Harry dry answers and frowning at him whenever she had the chance. When he had talked about that with Draco, the blond had sighed and told him it would pass, and then they hadn’t talked more about the article, or anything along the lines. So Draco hadn’t commented on Nott's anger and Harry hadn’t mentioned the recently dream-acquired information of his father casting an Imperius on a Ministry employee either.
“Whatever the Weasleys did, I doubt it's your fault either.” Draco’s words cut his line of thought and made him look up. The blond raised an eyebrow. “Those two always seemed like the type to do whatever they please. If they decided to launch an attack, it was probably for a good reason.”
The blond grinned at him. “I see you are learning some manners, love."
“He did,” said Sirius. “Listen, Snape was no saint either, he didn’t miss any chance he got to curse James, but I’m not proud of what we did, and I’m sure James wouldn’t be either. Your father was a great man, Harry. Don’t judge him just for what you saw, a lot of people are idiots at your age.”
Harry shook his head, and then followed him outside the classroom and all the way to the Entrance Hall. It was getting filled by curious students that had walked out of the Great Hall, where dinner was still getting served, in order to see the cause of such ruckus. Snape quickly disappeared among the crowd, leaving Harry to do the same. He searched around for any familiar face while also keeping an eye on the centre, where Trelawney was sobbing into her hands, two large trunks resting by her feet.
“You mean like a play,” said Draco haughtily, and Harry wondered if all wizards were stuck in the past or only purebloods. Still, it was fun, and Harry felt good about knowing something the other didn’t. It made them equal, in a way.
of a cow on his shoulder was a sign that Hagrid hadn't taken their advice to start with something not dangerous.
“I see your hair isn’t much of a mess today,” mused Draco.
bastard,” he hissed, hitting Harry again. “Here we were worried about you missing dinner to get yelled at by McGonagall, and you were just fooling around."
“I remember, but I wanted you to be there."
Snape seemed delighted to insult him and tell him that no, Legilimency wasn’t mind reading because the mind was complex and couldn't be opened like a book. But Harry didn’t really listen, because it sounded an awful lot like mind-reading and he definitely didn’t like that.
Harry followed their retreat for a moment before looking at his friends again. Hermione had an odd expression on her face, lips pinched and brown eyes narrowed at Ron, who kept staring at the spot Lavender had left with a perplexed expression.
Draco stood by the fence, eyes fixed on the unicorns.
“Oh, yeah?” said George. “What if I scrub the floor with your face?"
bottle green, the same colour he had worn for Yule and that Draco had commented on.
The blond snickered at Harry’s bad attempt to repress a laugh, which resulted in Harry laughing anyway. There were more weird looks sent towards them, but Harry didn’t mind at all.
"I did, Harry," said Draco. "And that's exactly it. We didn't say anything, because you were already doing it."
“Ron!”
“Git,” muttered Harry, pulling him closer to press a kiss on his lips, effectively making the blond stop laughing. He smiled at him, “I missed you a lot, thanks for writing to me."
Harry could definitely see Draco go down that path, with how comfortable he looked before a cauldron. Harry himself was another issue. “I think I want to be an Auror,” he said, then popping the chocolate into his mouth. It was exquisite and undoubtedly expensive, as usual.
“I’m not saying they are all nice, Ron. But you can’t tag a whole house as evil.”
“You are hardly the right person to give advice, aren’t you, Ronnie?” Ginny smirked. “How many girls have you dated exactly? Zero?”
Professor Grubbly-Plank told them Hagrid was indisposed and firmly dismissed further questions, instead calling the girls to step in the inclosure. The guys were to stay back since unicorns weren’t much fond of them.
Forced to run with him, Harry felt as if wanting to laugh at how bizarre the situation was. And figuring he didn't have anything to lose, he did, almost stumbling when the force of it made him double over.
Startled by the sudden interruption, Harry looked behind him to find Dudley peeking into his room, his big face slack as he looked at scattered things on the floor.
Mundungus barked a laugh, spilling the beverage he held on his hand, to Mrs Weasley’s irritation.
The ride on the Hogwarts Express back to London was completely different from the one at the start of term. Their compartment was way less crowded now, with Luna having gone off with Parkinson, who remained angry at Harry, all sympathies for him that might have been gained during the year gone; Neville and Ginny weren’t there either, and Blaise had excused himself as well.
“Don’t fool around too much, lover boy, you have the examinations this year,” said Fred.
Harry smiled. “Perfect.”
“It’s distributed by Rubens Winikus and Company Inc.,” said Harry, grinning when his friends looked back at him in surprise. “But the basis for it was invented by Linfred of Stinchcombe.”
The blond stared at him a bit longer, taking Harry by surprise when he threw his arms around his neck, making Harry hold him tighter to not lose balance. His face was hidden in Harry’s shoulder now, muffling his voice as he answered.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "You didn’t, you just shoved me into the nearest room.” He threw Harry a suspicious look. “What's gotten into you? Is it the Inquisitorial Badge? I know you were very into pins last year."
“What happened?” repeated Draco, sounding irritated but still accepting Harry’s hand and letting him guide him closer. “The Weasleys happened! One moment I’m about to tell you to get your ass in the Great Hall before Umbridge noticed you are not there, and the next those accursed twins are zooming in with their brooms and unleashing a bloody dragon after me!”
“Bugger off, Weasley,” muttered Draco as he straightened on his seat.
Sirius scoffed. “I’m sure he knows that much, Harry. Wouldn’t be surprised if they celebrated my unjust imprisonment in his house."
“Yeah, I thought it was a bit weird,” said Harry. “But isn’t Lucius on the Board of Governors?"
PS: Right, so which was the best date? This one or the first one? Personally, I would prefer the ice cream parlour over either haha.
"Oh." Draco glanced away, cheeks even darker under the dim light of the room. Then he mumbled, "I didn't mind that either."
The pretty pair of grey eyes flickered up at him suddenly and the white grin turned softer at the edges, making Harry's breath hitch. He could only raise a hand awkwardly before Malfoy was dragged into the Hall by Parkinson.
“That you are. See you, Potter,” said Malfoy, making his way towards the exit.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. “Hermione, the points are the least of my worries right now. There’s no way we are winning the House Cup with Umbridge here.”
Harry turned towards the team and found Angelina glaring at him. “Harry, I told you we have to ignore them."
Harry stored the egg on his bag and went to follow him. He sent Myrtle a deep scowl, but the girl only giggled at him.
Draco hummed. “Perhaps I shouldn’t tell you yet."
The Room of Requirement was spacious and well lit, with a high-ceiling from which a chandelier hung, dark and elegant like the room itself. The word on the meeting place had been passed around during the day, and by 8, every student that had gone to the Hog’s Head was present and listening to Harry.
“You are not sure,” repeated Draco, then looking at him in dismay. “Merlin, Harry, what are you doing?"
“Harry, no! The bottles next to it would fall.” Hermione sighed. “Let’s just wait for Ron.”
“Wasn’t
"Is it true, Harry?" said Ron angrily. "Is it true? Is it
“Thank you,” he said, entirely conscious of the dumb smile he had on his face as he looked at Draco again. “But where are my flowers?"
Feeling his face warm, Harry rushed to change the topic. “So, they are making my Hearing a big deal to, er, slander me further?"
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Any suggestions?”
, you want me to live here with you?"
He was halfway to the Dungeons when he heard the discussion, loud enough to be heard down the hallway and make Harry rush over.
Hermione had given him a sad smile and her reassurance that she believed him, which Harry was eternally grateful for. She had also suggested he should write to Sirius, let him know what was happening. As it was usual with her suggestions, Harry found it absolutely brilliant.
print that,” hissed Skeeter, prompting Hermione to start bickering with her. Harry glanced away from the discussion and towards Draco. He was looking paler now, mouth pressed into a thin line that couldn't mean anything good. His eyes flickered to Harry’s, filled with something akin to uncertainty that made him feel uneasy.
“Me?”
Umbridge's speech was long and monotone, and soon Harry found himself drowsing and resting his head on a hand. Hermione seemed to be one of the few listeners, while Ron straight up yawned and started talking to Harry about his broom again.
“So you wanted to
not winning the House Cup this year,” muttered Ron as they passed by the Hourglasses at the Entrance Hall. The one designated for Gryffindor had suffered great losses in the past week and was now almost empty of rubies, in deep contrast to its neighbouring Hourglass, filled to the top with emeralds.
Hope you liked it! See you on Monday!
"What the fuck Mundungus? Why would any of us find that funny?" asked Ron, rounding the table with Hermione in tow.
.” Hermione gave him a saddened look. “Yes, Draco was there, but he didn’t talk to me, I’m sorry.”
. Harry was done with waiting. He
Harry frowned. “It’s different now,” he said, hating how weak it sounded. But it was true. Even if Draco wasn’t an outright advocate of muggle rights and still took pride on his blood status, there had been a shift on him, one that Harry believed would continue. “I think that if someone here knows how much of a prat he has been, it's Ron, Hermione and me. Not any of you."
“Harry,” called Hermione, making him stop staring and follow Ron and her across the crowded station. Many people stared, whispers following after them, but he paid it no mind as he searched for familiar faces.
“She didn’t say.”
The green flames startled them, taking their attention from their hushed conversation to the fireplace, just as Albus Dumbledore stepped out.
“Tell me again why we are here,” said the blond, as he frowned at the glass coloured mermaid on a window
exist."
Draco smiled at him. "Exactly. Now, hurry it up."
“What? Of course not.” Ron frowned. “You did amazing last Task.”
“I didn’t just-” Draco seemed to choke at his words and Harry wanted to punch himself because it was just then when he realised what Draco had done.
“He didn’t dance with me,” said Draco, then looking up at the ceiling. “And neither did you."
Harry was already smiling when he turned around, to find Draco standing there with an amused grin on his face.
Harry winced at that, looking apologetically at the owls that flew back in. “I really am dreadful company.”
Idk, sorry about the rant, I just found this while re-reading the book and thought it was AWFUL! He could have gotten horribly hurt. In the sixth book, Draco even mentions that Montague had to Apparate himself to escape the Cabinet and nearly died doing it.
