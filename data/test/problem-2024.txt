“I need to shower,” Harry said brusquely to no one in particular when the kitchen door was once again closed, and stomped to his room.
"Really good man, why are you so surprised? Did you forget the Dementor fiasco? The Hippogriff theatrics?" Potter started to smile, Blaise was full on laughing and Draco had had enough with the lot of them.
Draco sniggered while his friends found places around the table. Even if a niggling part of him was annoyed at the interruption. Draco was a sore topic in the Chosen One’s life?
After dinner, Harry and Draco would sit down on whatever room seemed the warmest that night, and slowly go through books and case files – Hermione had suggested they looked for precedents on the Auror’s archive. They fell into a bizarre routine, which was mostly based on tetchy comments with no real bite, lots of tea, and no progress on the case.
He glared at the dog all through his tea. Grumbled to himself while eating his toast. And finally opened the backdoor:
“No, it doesn’t Potter. I don’t need to be in a place where all sorts of ministry workers can easily get into. I’m still a Death Eater, and people are
, Harry paid extra attention to his surroundings, expecting his assailant to be back. He even poked around a bit on some old books he had lying around the house. But nothing came after him, other than the usual garbage, so Harry finally dismissed the whole thing.
Whoever or whatever the thing was, it was still marching purposely in their direction, ever closer. Harry and Draco moved back as one, shoulders touching.
He couldn’t really talk until his second cup, and Harry came to understand that the tense moments those first few mornings were more about Draco’s incapability of making sense before ten o’clock, and less about any lingering resentments.
. Ron laughed at him and got up to give Hermione the bottle. But by then the baby had lost her patience and started crying wholeheartedly, refusing milk or comfort.
“I can’t feel it,” he said and searched for Draco’s eyes, spooked. Draco was staring back at him in stunned silence. His grip on Harry’s arm was so tight it hurt. Harry supposed he should be glad his nerves were still functioning on the rest of his limbs.
Over the next few days, after what Harry had taken to calling the Naked Draco incident, (to himself, anyway), a truce of sorts was at last brokered between the two of them. Gradually, and sometimes a bit uncertainly, they started to seek each other out around the house. Draco would drop by Harry’s study and disparage over Harry’s taste in music (Harry was going through a Nirvana phase). Harry, never one to have a structured anything in his life before, much less a schedule, found to his surprise that he would wander into Draco’s office around dinner time unfailingly, and pester him until the man dropped whatever project he was working on and joined Harry downstairs. Draco actually liked to cook, much to Kreacher’s despair, and extensive negotiations had taken place until it was officially agreed that Kreacher would be responsible for breakfast and snacks, but dinner was Draco’s rightful meal.
Soon they were crossing the entrance hall, which managed to be freezing and give off a malevolent energy despite summer's best efforts. Merlin, how he hated this house. At least the roof on this section of the Manor was still holding.
?” Harry raised his eyes to find Draco, hands on his waist and knit in the brow, glaring at him. His t’s got more pronounced when he was ticked off, a distantly entertained part of Harry noticed.
Which, in Harry’s opinion, was code for: Lucius would try to do it himself, and the results were unpredictable. Harry scrubbed his face with both his hands, already exhausted, and gave a loud groan. “Fine," he said, at last, adjusting his crooked glasses. He then fixed Draco with a determined glare.
Potter rose, grumbling and shaking his robes. He was apparently done. Draco put his hands down but was unable to stop staring. Potter himself had his eyes firmly on the fireplace. He looked remarkably shy in the sudden silence. For someone that was shouting with such abandon just a few seconds ago, anyway.
“Oh God,” Harry wheezed, brushing his tears away with the back of his hand, still chuckling now and then. “I wish I could tell 15 year old me about this.” Draco huffed.
A horrified yell. “Stop being such a sentimental sap, you fool, I’m too hungover for this shit, ugh, why did I ever marry you—”
Draco glanced cautiously at Harry, trying to gauge his reaction at this frankly traumatizing confession. As he watched, Harry’s expression turned from solemn to disbelieving to wildly amused.
"Yeah. Mum got a little insane though. You know how she is." They smiled at each other. Draco scowled at them both.
“Oh, grow up, all of you,” said Hermione impatiently, with a roll of her eyes. “Since you’re both here, you will help us with the restoration.”
“Anyway,” Draco continued, “Astoria is sending a few books tomorrow. It will be good to go over them together. That is to say, it will be good for me and Hermione to go over them. You and Ronald can make tea and mind the baby.”
"You have a serious condition, Potter. This need of yours to fix the whole world in positively obsessive."
"This is from your vault, until Gringotts can make things straight officially," he said, extending a bag filled with galleons to Draco.
“That eats like a savage, shows no regard for rules, proper etiquette, or antiques, really,” Draco continued evenly, completely ignoring Harry’s outburst. “And most of all,
“Saying your hair is ugly isn’t a war crime, Weasel,” Draco replied calmly, peering at Weasley over the rim of his cup of tea. He bit back a laugh when the other man spluttered in indignation. Hermione sighed.
“Do you know who that is?” Harry asked, tilting his head to the side when the Grim started growling.
Harry grunted, putting his glasses back and mulling over the subject. He did find small tins of cookies inside his robe’s pockets, and sometimes sandwiches were waiting for him at his office when he got back from a raid. He just always assumed Ron or Hermione had bought extras or something. Come to think of it, Harry recurrently found ‘left over’ food inside his fridge that he had no recollection of ever buying. Draco was staring at him smugly when Harry’s eyes went back to him.
“Yes, well.” Draco exhaled tiredly, trying to think. What a fucking night. “If that thing was a person, then the white flash makes no sense. But he shouldn’t be dead. Maybe… Banished? If it was some other creature…” Draco shrugged. “Who knows.”
“Aren’t you supposed to keep this stuff from happening?” Harry yelled over him, franticly sending vanishing spells in all directions.
"Because it's humiliating," shouted Draco, reaching fresh levels of distress. "I already owe you enough! I took the wrong side of the war! I had to sit there and listen to you defending me at the Wizengamot even though I didn't deserve it! I have to count down every knut to be able to eat! Do you think I have the funds to re-roof the Manor?! My house is crumbling down on top of me and I can't get out, I can't fix it and I just want you to
“The house would probably be more willing to protect him, he’s part Black and all that tosh.” Ron pipped in, and Harry sent him a murderous look.
Draco nodded, feeling relieved at the implied request. Bartering goods – a much more enjoyable activity than this endless aid receiving indignity.
“Ron, I can’t believe you!” shrieked Hermione. Draco looked from her shocked expression to the dark rage building on Harry’s face.
He pondered to himself, feeling vaguely nauseous, how exactly was it that his life had suddenly been taken over by a bunch of overly eager do-gooders.  He just wanted to brood away his probation time all by himself, was that too much to ask?
“Bellatrix,” Harry mumbled darkly, leaning against a wall, arms crossed. Draco’s jaw went slack for a few seconds, and he murmured a soft ‘
And if you wear those tight jeans again, and if I’m feeling particularly nice, you might see me dance to something even
“That is none of your fucking business Malfoy! It’s my life, my bloody relatives!” Harry yelled back and Draco threw his hands in the air.
"Kitchen! If I cannot demolish this place, I might as well have some tea,” he reached the stairs and started jumping down the steps two at a time in his rush to get away. "You can leave Potter, you made your point. The Manor will prevail."
"So! Do you know how to make wolfsbane?" asked Weasley, breaking the uncomfortable silence. "I don't turn, but I get rather moody near the full moon, you know. Only I'm pants at potions."
? How exactly does one go about asking something like that? Draco shifted restlessly on the top of the bean he was supposed to be hammering into submission. Hermione had banned magic for this part of the task. In her defense, Blaise had almost – accidentally, Draco was sure – maimed Ronald with an overly enthusiastic swarm of nails.
"Just do it!" Draco snapped and waited while Potter shifted around uncertainly. He then adjusted himself, so they were pressed firmly against each other.
He did. There was a deep gash, elbow to wrist, on both his forearms. Harry blinked slowly at this. There was no blood, even though the cuts were deep. He could clearly see the layers of his skin, fat, muscle, like some twisted, horrible dessert course. But there was no blood. No pain, even. As Harry watched, disturbed, the wounds began to close on their own, and in a matter of seconds, smooth skin was all there was to see. Smooth, greyish skin, quite a few shades paler than that of the rest of his body. With his free hand, he cautiously poked at the place where one of the cuts had been. The skin there was numb and
Draco tried to scoot forward inconspicuously, in a bid to get closer to Ronald. Best mates were supposed to have this kind of information at hand, right? He scowled at the amused look Blaise shot him, trying to express to him the general feeling of ‘piss off’. The effectiveness of this was debatable, seeing as the bastard winked at him. He turned back around and found that Ronald was looking at him most suspiciously.
. Harry’s search had unearthed an article from around a year ago announcing Draco Malfoy and Astoria Greengrass were engaged.
I’ll make it look like an accident! I’ll-” raged Draco, struggling to get up. Harry wrapped his arms around him, fighting to keep Draco still, laughing so hard actual fucking tears were running down his eyes. The complete tosser.
While Draco busied himself stacking his parcels on the top of a long desk, Harry leaned back on his seat and took in the differences in the room for the first time. The whole… office, Harry supposed, was decorated in soothing tones of cream and blue. Harry was pretty sure this particular room had been painted a mildly traumatizing shade of yellow by Luna a few years back. Something about combating a creature that caused depression.
It was a soothing motion, really. Bizarre, but soothing. It should be uncomfortable. All their physical interaction up until now had involved fistfights, near-death situations, and stumbling around half asleep. There’d been none of this skin-to-skin contact. Ever. Though Harry supposed the whole evening’s debacle could in fact be considered life-threatening, even if not immediately so.
“Erm… Maybe we can just finish fixing your roof, and go from there?” Harry suggested, looking at Draco oddly. Draco sniffed at that bourgeoise plan, but nodded his head.
Draco noticed vaguely that Hermione was rushing Ron out of the room, but his main focus was on Harry. Magic was quickly impregnating the air and making the room smell like ozone, of all the things. Usually that would make Draco feel unsettled, but he was just too angry. He kept pushing forward until they were standing chest to chest, ready to come to blows.
Potter, I'm fine. It's called punishment for a reason. I was merely explaining about the roof expenses."
“Thank you,” said Draco, helping himself and settling beside one of the counters with a contented sigh. “No dogs in the kitchen,” he added firmly, and Harry turned around in time to see dog-Potter halt and sit down next to the kitchen’s entrance.
Draco retreated to Potter’s office while waiting. It was impossible to miss, what with the Gryffindor banner stuck proudly on a wall and piles of half-filled paperwork spread around the desk, Potter’s messy scrawl outlining everything. Draco had been pacing for the longest ten minutes – time enough to realize he was still wearing pyjamas. He quickly transfigured his clothes into something presentable. Draco would be damned if he would die wearing striped trousers. It was bad enough that he had them at all.
"See you later, darling." Pansy, the vicious harpy, waved with her fingers. Draco could hear her giggling even as she Apparated with a loud
!” he exclaimed, but Malfoy was already turning, shoes slipping on the wet stones of the street in his rush to get away.
“You are unbelievable,” Harry muttered and then spread his arms out in frustration. “I don’t get it, where did he go?”
“Excellent,” Draco said and turned to the pile on the floor. He arched an eyebrow. “I see your organization skills didn’t improve much with age.”
Morning light found them both sullen and subdued. Kreacher had indeed prepared an over-the-top breakfast and called both men down to eat at seven on the dot. Draco, for all his high levels of activity at the break of dawn the day before, seemed to be decidedly not a morning person. He dragged himself down, still wrapped in a robe, and stared listlessly at the empty plate before him.
A Dragonpox on Harry Potter and his disruptive ways, Draco thought to himself after Blaise had left him to finish his bath in sullen resentment. Why did he have to change the dynamics of their respectful rivalry with favours and fascinating morning woods?
“Harry?” a panicked voice whispered, and there were hands on his face, pushing his hair back, rubbing his temples. “Can you hear me?”
How else could Bill Weasley popping up in Malfoy territory be explained? The man strolled in just as Draco was threatening to throw a lamp at Potter. He looked around with curiosity, taking in the destroyed drawing room to which Draco and Potter had retreated after another screaming match in the kitchen. One of his lips quirked up- Draco was still holding the lamp over his head.
A distressed Potter was still tossing and turning, only now he was also spluttering water out of his mouth and nose while cussing. Draco smiled broadly. It was such a heart-warming sight.
“… truly fascinating, what they can do with magical houses. You should read up on some of the books I bought yesterday, Harry. It would really help you when you decide to remodel Grimmauld Place.”
They spent a couple more hours discussing theories back and forth, Harry getting more and more sleepy. Draco manhandled him up the stairs at some point, scolding Harry about his ridiculous notion that it was appropriate to fall asleep on one’s living room floor.
Draco squinted at his friend, trying and failing to find the strength to hit him. He sighed, primly rearranging the bubbles in order to cover his bits. Blaise rolled his eyes but didn’t comment.
“What the buggering fuck is that Potter?” he yelled, whipping his head around to see if they were being chased. They were. “
He was at it once more. How badly could a person possibly sleep? And one would think that Mind Healers would fall over themselves to rid the Boy Who Lived of scary dreams. Who was responsible for this atrocious state of Potter's affairs?
“Harry, how could you? Tampering with official forms, you know better than that. It’s the same kind of corruption we’ve been
“What the sodding hell are you doing?” Asked Harry, hoarse, eyes quickly taking in all the maps, sketches and books surrounding Draco and Ron on the library’s floor. Draco supposed they must look quite the pair, all dusty and disheveled after an afternoon of research. In retrospect, it was surprising it had taken the others so long to find them.
time. Potter sure had a good pair of lungs and the stamina to go with it). He was seized by this ridiculous notion that if he could only get to his feet, the ginger bloke standing in his library would disappear. Weirder things had happened. Specially lately. Just look at this Potter situation.
, because she came looking for me after I barraged into her room at fuck o’clock in the morning to leave Potter with her.”
Immediately after the war, he would wake up from one of those – and plenty others – screaming and shaking uncontrollably. But as the years went by, the dreams started to change. There wouldn’t be people dying around him, no sluggish legs that refused to allow him to run and save his loved ones. No terror, no hurt. Just a stroll around the places where Harry had lost something. Deserted sets from a terrible play. Harry learned to just go with these dreams.
“Away from your house, Potter,” Draco said in sudden irritation. The dog lifted his head in question but settled back down when he noticed nobody was actually talking to him. “Before I get arrested for spilling more of the Chosen One’s blood.”
When he actually found himself alone in his bed though, sleep abruptly disappeared. Harry stared at the ceiling, the image of Draco wet and completely naked intruding insistently on his thoughts. He looked… Harry sighed and ignored the little thrill going down his spine. He was fit, Harry supposed. Nothing wrong with admitting that. And if he was feeling weird… well. He probably just needed a shag, Harry reasoned with himself. That was all.
“Oh,” Draco rubbed his eyes. “I was going to turn them into dung beetles and put them in a terrarium. In the winter garden.” He shrugged. Harry gave a surprised laugh at that.
Harry spluttered and was about to go into a tirade that he had the highest case clearance rates in the Auror’s department,
It was enough to give him the vapors. Draco hid his face behind his hands and peeped through his fingers. It was a bit like watching two trains crash. One just couldn’t look away.
Potter gave him a murderous look and seemed to be on the verge of shouting some choice expletives when Weasley’s voice came booming from somewhere above them.
Draco gulped and glanced at the chandelier high above, which had started to shake in a rather disquieting manner. Magic was gathering around them at an alarming rate.
“Good.” He whispered, then frowned at the scratchy sound of his own voice. Draco conjured a glass of water and helped him sit up and drink.
“Weekend study group?” he suggested. Ron winced but nodded. Hermione was looking at him with a speculative expression.
“Piss off, Malfoy. I don’t see your report enlightening us all over why magic doesn’t work on this bloke properly.” he spat. Draco’s head snapped up, and if Harry didn’t know any better, he would swear Draco looked confused at Harry’s show of hostility. But almost instantly Malfoy’s face shuttered down, and his usual sneer was back in place.
He pointedly refused to acknowledge the small part of his mind that was feeling very grateful indeed at not being forced to spend another night alone in this mausoleum of a house. Draco transfigured another bed for himself – this one positively cozy, - and fell asleep before Potter returned.
. Cold had no effect on him. However, finding a hot cup of tea innocently waiting for him in the entrance hall was quickly becoming his favourite part of the day. Draco boasted about this. Harry declared the tea was only effective in bracing him against whatever madness he would find at Draco’s office. Draco told him to go fuck himself, but there was a biscuit next to the tea the following day.
“But here’s the thing, I don’t think there is.” Hermione gave an apologetic look to Harry. “Think about it. The house is Unplottable, under the Fidelius Charm. Blood magic would already shield Draco, to begin with. And Harry, you added a
“Right,” Hermione brightened, leaning in. “It’s very straightforward really. First, we have to dispel the dark magic that made the roof cave in the first place. Draco, you were right about that.”
“Stop. Please. I understand. So you and Mr. Potter had intercourse?” Draco spluttered, eyes going wide as saucers.
On the one hand, Potter was at least following the hierarchy, Draco though idly, trying to keep hysterical laughter from escaping his lips. He started off fire-calling Gringotts, then the Aurors Department,
He left them to their lunacy and went downstairs to procure himself some Earl Grey. Twenty minutes later, Draco strode in. He had seemingly gotten over Harry’s rearrangement of the house. His hair was wet, turned into a slightly more subdued colour than the usual shock of blond, and he had changed into perfectly pressed black trousers, a white dress shirt, and a waistcoat. Harry rolled his eyes. His own typical clothes for staying in were in fact just pants, but of course, Draco would be as pretentious as hell.
“I don’t cook, my study is off-limits, and you have to be nice to Kreacher. My elf, Kreacher,” Harry expanded when Draco stared at him blankly. “He’s really old, I don’t want you giving him more work to do.”
“Fine!” he yelled at the dog, motioning with his hand towards the entrance. And the dog came bounding happily in his direction as if that had been his idea all along. Draco had a gnawing suspicion it was.
“Nobody shrinks cursed objects, you simpleton. They might eat you out of spite. Astoria sent the clock by owl this morning.”
“Exactly.” Draco’s face was lighting up with enthusiasm too. Harry found himself thinking that he should smile more. It would do his reputation as a snob some reprieve. “This room is brimming with dark magic, and-”
“And the Killing Curse made him disappear,” Hermione murmured, sounding thoughtful. “It makes no sense. Draco, are you sure you cast correctly? It’s not an easy curse to perform.”
On the other hand, as the weather progressively got worse and rain started to be a permanent fixture to all days, Draco made an accurate correlation between the depths of Harry’s bad temper and just how wet and cold he was upon arriving from work.
could make Saint Potter move anywhere. Including out, as it happened. And oh, how Draco had yelled. And threatened. And insulted.
At least not for the first few days. Banging dishes around quite loudly one morning, Draco bared his teeth at the window, very annoyed. The creature was still there. In the exact same place. Didn’t it need water? Food? Reason stood that it had to go and procure those at some point. But no, the dog remained there like an enormous, drooling,
It was fine. He didn't complain. It could have been worse. He hadn't even pointed out to those Ministry simpletons that it was far from coherent to put someone in therapy for all the Dark Lord trauma, while still requiring said patient to live in the fucking headquarters of Moldy Voldy. No, no. Draco Malfoy was working on his temper. Until this morning when half of the Manor's roof had caved in.
“I hate you,” he informed Draco at last. And with a pointed scowl to the dog, apparated the lot of them to Grimmauld Place.
Back at the library after his bath, ready for supper and sleep, Draco found one Harry Potter standing awkwardly next to a table filled with snacks. He stopped on his tracks.
“Tory. What are you doing here? It’s not safe.” Draco admonished even as he embraced her. Harry averted his eyes, feeling inexplicably uncomfortable by this show of affection coming from Draco. Even his usual haughty tone had mellowed to something almost sweet.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. He’d gotten himself under enough control that his face no longer looked panicked-stricken. He was silent for a few minutes, and Harry, body still shaking, started to drift off. Reality seemed far away.
On the other hand, Potter, already frighteningly furious to begin with, had worked himself up into a rage. Magic crackled and zapped everywhere, and Draco had witnessed the demise of more than one of his mother's priceless vases in detached stupor.
"How dare you!" gasped Draco, clutching his chest in outrage. "The roof fell down on me, Potter! Literally! I was merely teaching it a lesson."
A lot of bad things could be said about Draco Malfoy. He knew that. Death Eater scum, spineless coward, snob. Fine. But
“Indeed, Potter. The general idea was to keep you from having nightmares, not giving you wet dreams.”
Also, I have absolutely no clue what the devil those British guys are using to measure distance now. Yards, miles? So I stuck to my good friend meter. If someone knows the proper terminology, I'd love to learn it.
“I told you, someone’s following me,” he said, seizing the fabric of Draco’s sweater with his left hand as he started to back up.
The dog came to greet him while Harry made his way up the stairs to 'Draco's rooms’. Harry sent the animal an annoyed glance.
In spite of all this, Potter had proceeded to merrily invite more Gryffindors over, each one bringing an assortment of supplies he deemed necessary. The day carried on in a mind-boggling succession of unlikely visitors. Draco became convinced at some point that he was just having a freakishly long nightmare. No cause for anxiety, he just had to be patient. Any minute now, he was certain, Nagini would come sliding through one of the corridors, and he would wake up shaking in his bed as usual.
“Well.” Draco paused, and then shrugged. He sat straighter and tried to look confident in a way that never fooled Harry when they were in school, and most certainly didn’t fool him now. “If it meant my life, of course he would.”
He went about his life in the tiny house he had bought in London a couple of years ago. He went about his job as a curse breaker and a consultant for the Ministry of Magic. He didn’t worry about any dogs.
"Articulated as always, eh?" Blaise was having way too much fun with the situation, in Draco's opinion. Even if Potter had the eloquence of a baboon.
“I’d never seen anything like that. Harry, it really looked like you were dying.” Harry jumped a bit when Draco’s fingers touched his arm, stroking him. Draco didn’t seem to be conscious of his actions, eyes distant and forehead wrinkled in thought. Harry sent a surreptitious glance at his friends, to check if they were aware of this new development, but they were paying him no mind. Well.
Harry practiced more of his magic.  They were in the sitting room, but since Harry had to move around to practice on different things, Draco hadn’t made the floral wingback chair into a sofa.  Eventually Harry got bored of practicing, even though it was fun.  He wanted to sit by Draco but didn’t want to bother him.  Those times Harry had fallen asleep, Draco had used his wand to carry Harry off to bed, but before that he must have fallen asleep beside Draco—against Draco, Harry realized, remembering the feel of Draco’s warm shoulder against his cheek.
, which was an absurdly slow-paced book about the intricate politics of fish-people, mermaids, and pirates.  There were lots of details and descriptions and names, such that even if Harry hadn’t had dyslexia he’d probably have trouble reading it, except Draco had whizzed through it at
“Don’t you like it?” Draco asked, when Harry took it out of the brown paper wrap.  “I thought you liked mine.”
“I just wanted a chance to read to find out what was going on.”  Harry just hoped that Draco didn’t remember that there had been a letter also.  There was no way he was ever going to let Draco’s younger self read it.  “That’s about the cure to age you up,” Harry said, nodding at the ledger in Draco’s hands, “so you should read it now.”
Harry just stared at him. He couldn’t feel anything in his body, nothing at all. “Why are you doing this? He’s meant to be your son-in-law.”
A cup of coffee stood on his desk, warmed with a spell, lazy steam rising from the top like the most beckoning of gestures.
“Hm,” Malfoy had said, pretending to think about it. “It’s true he failed to pass me. His loss. Your gain. The loss of the Auror Force and the whole magical world, really, but still. Your gain.”
“You could ask your future father-in-law,” Harry said, but he didn’t know why he said it. Maybe he’d been trying to provoke some kind of reaction, but beside him, Malfoy turned frosty. Giving up, Harry at last turned to look at him again.
“Malfoy! Expecto Patronum! Malfoy! Now!” Harry could do nothing but watch it on the IC:WUT/UC; the anti-Apparition ward was still in place; he hadn’t dropped the last Ward Bore. Harry wouldn’t be able to see it now, even if Malfoy did drop it. “Malfoy,” Harry said into the Wire, “remember when you did your Patronus for me? And I was behind you; I showed you how to stand. You came up with that memory, that beautiful memory; you relaxed and let it fill you. Let it fill you, Malfoy; relax; let me in; I know you can do it. I know you can do it; I’ve seen you. I believe in you. Do it for me. Do it for me.”
“You want me to do it? I’ll do it,” Malfoy said, beginning to saunter through the trainees. Bennet had moved back before the boggart had finished its transformation, and so the boggart had reverted into the rats in frilly dresses taking tea and crumpets, which had been the result of Wan’s Riddikulus.
Harry’s mind kept stretching, separated completely now, floating there above the table.  “Was Draco,” he began, but he already knew the answer.
Draco shifted in Harry’s arms, nearly of a height with Harry now, turning so that they were face to face.  Draco’s breath was there on Harry’s beard, his big bright eyes looking into Harry’s glasses—and then Draco’s lips were there, clumsily closing over Harry’s.  “No,” Harry said, pushing him away.
“Do I wish you felt better? That you didn’t have the flashbacks, or trouble sleeping, that you never had attacks, that you had never tried to kill yourself? Yes.” Kavika could be so still sometimes, like an anchor. “But you’re my patient, Harry. You wouldn’t be here if those things had never happened to you. It doesn’t bother me because your conversation annoys me. It bothers me because you are my friend, and things that hurt you also hurt me.”
“Have you heard of bunk beds?”  The arm around Harry tightened, then let go.  “Will it suit you if I transfigure my bed into two beds?  You can lie there until you hear me snore, to assure you I am asleep.”
one,” Fudge said, mirroring Harry’s earlier earnestness, “and a great one. Why shouldn’t you be afforded the—”
The book Draco had given Harry’s younger self floated over from the bookcase.  ‘Wellbeday’ was embossed on the bottom in gold letters, either the author or publisher.
“Sure,” Harry said, because Malfoy’s body was obviously not very nice at all. “Remember our rules for the class—never move against your partner without being quite sure they’re ready; never touch them without letting them know what you’re about to do. Okay, Malfoy,” Harry said again. “I’m going to come behind you and put an arm around you, and then my other arm is going to come around your neck. Is that okay?”
There was a pause. “Sorry.” Malfoy truly did sound sorry. Looking down the street, he rocked on his heels again, as though feeling the weight of himself. “She challenges me to be who I am,” he said at last, turning to face Harry so directly that Harry felt confronted. “She wants everyone to look inside themselves and find the person that they are there, and then reject anyone who would hold you back from being your most authentic self.”
Harry wanted to say yes and be done with it, because he didn’t know how to describe the things he was feeling.  He tried anyway, because he was thinking of the boy who
“It’s a bit intrusive isn’t it?  Like someone telling you that you can’t wear ribbons in your hair.”
Harry was pretty sure he was going to get one, seeing as how he’d get to go to a magical school where he had friends.  But maybe it wouldn’t be happy if Draco wasn’t one of them.
Now that Harry thought about it, he had no idea why he’d come.  He knew nothing about mums dying, after all.  He knew nothing about mums.  He knew nothing about
Harry picked up the bottle off the lab bench and put it into Malfoy’s hand.  “The powder,” Harry said.  “It’s making you want that.  If you fix it, it will go away.”
Ron looked doubtfully at Robards, then apologetically at Harry. “I’m sure we just want to keep Malfoy in case we have questions afterwards,” he told Harry, then glanced back at Malfoy. “I’m sure it’s not a problem for you to stay longer, is it?”
“Good.”  Draco kissed the spot under Harry’s ear.  “Because I promised you I’d never leave you, and I’m never going to.”
“Well,” Harry said, setting down the jar of memories for them to review.  “It wasn’t much of a reunion.”
“Draco,” Harry tried to say it as gently as he could.  “I didn’t know what I wanted.  I thought I wanted Ginny Weasley.”
“Yeah,” said Savage.  “I’ll bet.  Come on, Potter.  That was what you needed.”  She started heading toward the door.
“Hm.  That’s not surprising,” Malfoy said, setting the flower down.  “I imagine I spend more time with you than Vince and Greg.  You know them, of course?”
“I just mean it would be weird,” Harry said, putting a card down.  “It would be weird if I was ten but had a wife.”
“Er. I don’t know if ‘help’ is the right . . .” Catching himself rubbing the back of his hand, Harry made himself stop. He
Though Harry was waiting for Mister Malfoy to tell him to slow down, Mister Malfoy just said, “Would you like to try some magic?”
When Harry finally got the bottle open, however, the pink powder inside immediately whooshed up into his face.  Funny.  The powder hadn’t looked very mobile.  Swallowing a sigh and hoping the powder wasn’t going to make his skin fall off or his nose turn inside-out, Harry spelled the powder off his face and back into the bottle.  At least the powder hadn’t made him blind or stop breathing—yet.  As usual, the Auror Office was empty this time of night, so no one else had been exposed to the powder, and Harry figured it best to go to Malfoy and find out whether Harry was going to grow lizard skin.
Standing up, Harry rummaged about. Though he had never been very scholarly, his experience—and the innate proficiency the Horcrux within him had once given him—meant that he knew a lot more about Dark Arts than most. Harry found a quill, a cloth, charcoal, a candle stub, a knife, sterilizing alcohol. This would take some work to figure out, some experimentation. Harry was sure he could figure it out.
“You do hear what you’re saying? Bigoted death cult.” Harry held out his hand, palm up. “Name-calling.” He held out his other hand, balancing the two as though they were scales. “Murder,” he added, looking at one hand, “not giving him a chance.” Harry looked at the other hand, still weighing. “Imperius, torture, bigoted slurs, did I mention
Malfoy reminded Harry so strongly of Lupin in that moment that he thought of the way he had more than once seen Teddy and Malfoy, sitting under this very tree. When Harry didn’t take the chocolate, Malfoy put it on the bench between them and stood up.
.”  He pointed his wand at the fire, which seemed to stream toward Draco’s wand.  Soon the flames were weaving into the shape of a large lizard.  Or dinosaur.  Or—dragon, it was a dragon, like Harry had seen on a kite at the park, once, walking on the way home from school.  The flames shimmered into sparks; then the sparks popped out, fading in the air.
Once Harry was done with the number, he put the mobile up to his face like a real telephone, hoping to hear it ring.  When it didn’t, he took it away from his face, and then saw the little green telephone picture under the numbers.  Harry tried touching it.  Hearing the mobile make a bit of a sound, he put it to his face again.
Harry shook his head. “He’s grown. He’s changed. I can see that. I can forgive him. But that’s—that’s why I can’t . . . . The thought of . . . of . . .” Harry couldn’t even bring himself to say it.
“Usually,” Doctor Yin went on, “I would think that line would remind others they’re being invasive. Meanwhile, it would remind me that I have healthy ways of discussing painful things. But if I said it when I didn’t actually have a therapist, it would remind me I didn’t have that outlet right now, and that would suck.”
“It shouldn’t take too long.” Things finally seemed to be wrapping up, so Harry turned from watching Teddy to find Malfoy, who was standing a little bit apart with Rune. Rune was talking with his animated smile and frankly gorgeous hands, and Malfoy had on that intent, listening look.
People use statues for protection, Harry thought idly, and it wasn’t bad, to have someone there and not-there. In a way it felt like Kavika, the way he could drink coffee with her sometimes, and she wouldn’t say anything, wouldn’t pressure him to say anything. She would just be another presence, almost a reassurance that he didn’t have to be anyone particular for her.
The reporters poured in like garbage down a chute, fast and loose and like they belonged. Bulbs flared and went out, and above the chatter of questions was Robards, shouting, “I led the mission! I’m available for interview!”
Harry’s heart was pounding in his chest. His hands felt a bit sweaty; he used the cool smoothie glass to wipe them off.
In this man, Harry could see the child Draco had been—the pink cheeks, heaving chest, and abrupt defensiveness that came out of nowhere like a slap in the face.  “All right,” Harry said.
“What did I say about ‘should’?” Ron’s voice was gentle. “One day you and Hermione have to realize you’re not the ones that control the systems. The world would be a lot better if you were.”
“Exactly, Potter.  That’s why I never let her know what I really want or who I really am, and we both of us pretend I didn’t play with dolls when I was six.”
“Potter.”  Malfoy swallowed.  When he spoke, his voice was lower and more hesitant than ever.  “I can—I can be good.  At listening.”
In the evenings, Draco had Harry choose supper.  Harry only chose fish and chips once more.  After that he choose to have mini beef wellingtons like they had had for their first picnic, then curry like they had had for their second picnic.  Draco seemed amused by these choices but made them anyway, and Harry never ate until he got sick again.  Afterwards they did the washing up together.
“I’m a little relieved, I guess.” Sibanyoni’s had at least several cushions, all of which seemed quite well loved, and in these Harry found at least several threads to pick at, occupying his hands. “I think it felt like . . . work, to keep up with him. But I liked him. He was good. I don’t know.”
Cambridge was living that one week in March that already felt like May, before the dreary rain and cold returned to remind them of April still to come. The sun had just risen in a gentle arrangement of pink and gold, and blue was slowly populating the sky when Harry Apparated to the Academy to find a dozen reporters outside the Pallas Arch. Unauthorized personnel were not allowed within the wards of the Academy grounds, but since Apparition was also disallowed, the reporters knew Harry would have to appear outside before going in.
Harry finished, explaining that Malfoy still had not even passed Level One, couldn’t cast a Patronus, and furthermore was unnecessary for the purposes of infiltrating the Death Eater meeting. “If we really need to get the Ward Bore into the meeting,” Harry pointed out, “someone could Polyjuice as him.”
“You also know some of what I think the wizarding world does to children,” Kavika said, spelling the water from the pot to the cup, then bringing it by hand to Harry. “You know I wish it had been kinder to you.”
Harry looked over his shoulder at the witch Teddy had disarmed. “Stupefy,” Harry added, dropping the witch in her tracks. “Who is ‘we’ in this situation?” he demanded, turning back to Teddy.
Just then Heloise came swooping in from the doorway to the upstairs, and Harry wondered whether she’d slept up there, or if she hadn’t, how she’d got in.  She had a brown paper package in her talons, which she dropped on Draco’s lap.  Then she flapped over to land near the window, on a bar Harry hadn’t noticed before.
“Show it to me,” Harry said, and Malfoy at last took his hand off, baring his forearm for Harry to see. The skin was as clear as ever. It really was a well-made arm. Harry put his hand over where the Dark Mark used to be, and Malfoy gasped. Harry took his hand away. “Does that hurt?”
“I was,” Draco insisted.  “When I’m grown up I’m very sophisticated.  I’ll bet I hold my liquor excellently.  I’ll bet I have liquor all the time, and . . .”  He paused, apparently thinking up more parts for his story.  “And I have political enemies who try to make up bad things about me, but they’re not true, and I just laugh in their face.  Like this—ha ha ha!”
Harry thought about the little plastic soldier he had.  “I don’t need any toys,” he said quickly.  He was sad to give up the soldier, but he’d much prefer to live with Mister Malfoy.
Malfoy on the Parkinson raid, and didn’t really see why Harry didn’t. Malfoy wasn’t Ron’s trainee; Ron had never been an instructor. He didn’t know. And even if Hermione would see, she would want to support Ron too.
Malfoy’s nose came down and his derisive voice returned.  “One does not become proficient at potions without practice, Potter.  Did you think I was born a genius at it?”
Kavika obviously guessed, her steady look of appraisal making Harry regret the turn of the conversation even more. He wasn’t ready to talk about Teddy being an Auror again; he’d said all he could say. “Will you talk to Teddy about it?”
Diagon was in chaos. A non-mag automobile had crashed into the Leaky; a non-mag stood in front of Flourish and Blotts in a full-body bind while another non-mag shook her, screaming at her to wake up. The sound of shouting duels filled the air, bats from a Bag Bogey Hex; something was on fire. Fenrir was standing on the kerb.
; I just . . .”  Draco flung himself back into the corner of the couch, sprawling out again.  He moved around a lot, and Harry wondered whether Draco had too much energy to sit this long on the couch.  He didn’t appear to want to leave however, for he went on to say, “I just
Luckily, Draco began by perusing the books at eye-level, seeming to find several volumes of interest there.  “This looks good,” he said, pulling out a white one with a red stamp on the spine.  He’d almost got it off the shelf when he said, “Oh!  Fleetmoss and Sewell.  I’d wanted to get that one,” and began tugging at a maroon one with a faded cover.  “Hey!”  Then he hopped—literally hopped to the next shelf over.  “Is this—”  Pulling a crumbling grey book-shaped box off the shelf, he opened it to reveal a leather book inside with gilt-edges.  When he flipped open the cover, the pages produced the soft tones of a flute.  “Bright’s
It was painful, Harry realized.  He was feeling pain.  It hurt, particularly since he’d just realized how much he himself hadn’t minded kissing Malfoy.  He hadn’t minded in the least.
“You think if you forgive me, you’ll prove how good you are? How worthy of all the accolades, all the respect?”
Malfoy bit his lip, flushed and still a little sweaty from class. His shirt stuck to him in odd places.
“But you will,” Draco said.  “I think he must have wanted to meet you—very badly.  He tried to find you—he tried so hard to get to you.”
“Not my toy,” Harry told him. “Though I would see how you would get confused, seeing as how everyone is a toy to you. Does Astoria count as a person? Or does she just get put on a higher shelf?”
“Will Lucius Malfoy’s investments in NimbusTech influence company advertising in favour of Conceal?” another reporter shouted.
“Oh God.” Harry felt like he was gasping, but Ron had witnessed something like this before, and just held him, and held him. Harry wished he could bury his face against Ron’s neck and never look at the rest of the world again; he wished he could look at Teddy forever; he wished Hermione was there.
Manoeuvring through the crowd, Harry swiftly made his way to the men’s. Then he was there, and just being there felt cooler. Tiles were always cold somehow, and it was quieter, and Harry could take off his coat. Loosen his tie. Unbutton his top buttons; breathe. The men’s had four stalls, one urinal, two sinks, mirrors above them. The mirrors looked cool too; Harry wanted to put his face against them, but he didn’t. He was already feeling much better. He just had to breathe.
“That was because I’d already been affected,” Malfoy said impatiently.  “Once it takes hold of your system, it doesn’t matter if the object of desire washes off the powder; they’ll continue to be an object of desire until the victim is cured.  Therefore, if someone sees a person wearing the powder, the cure has to be tailored to the victim, not to the individual wearing the powder, even after the powder itself is neutralized.”
For some reason, Malfoy seemed even more amused by this. “A Malfoy has his secrets. I couldn’t possibly tell you.”
“Draco,” Harry whispered, moving over him a bit, kissing his jaw, his temple, his brow. “We’ll fuck again. I’ll make love to you again. I promise.”
“I hear they can be very attractive.” Kavika sipped her coffee. “There’s one famous fellow; who is he? Lewd Jaw.”
,” he said, and the stick rotated in his other hand.  “Stay by me,” he said, beginning to march in the direction the wand pointed and pulling Harry along.
“Just look at that,” Draco breathed. “You have come. Dribbling out of you. Like a used-up whore.” Then he leaned in, pressing three gentle kisses along Harry’s crack.
“Oh, no.”  Draco sniffled.  “Mother says—she says it doesn’t matter what you feel on the inside.  On the outside you always have to be courteous.  It’s this thing called decorum—like decorating.  That’s what being discreet is about, you know.  You decorate so people don’t know, only—I’m not good at it yet.  Mother says everything on my insides always comes out.”
“Enough of my remorse. I only wished to express my gratitude, as what comes next may seem ungrateful. I also don’t want to seem as though I had any kind of authority to advise or counsel you, but I feel concern for you, if Sweet Dreams is your only sleep remedy; I wonder if you have been adequately apprised of its side effects? Please ignore if the information I offer is know to you and therefore redundant. One side effect is the opposite of the symptom the potion is meant to alleviate; ie, it may result in nightmares. Another side effect—”
“Yes,” the man said slowly, brow furrowing.  “Like a magic . . . oh.”  Before, the man had seemed stricken, but now he seemed horrified, if his aghast expression was anything to go by.  “Potter, you . . .”
“I’m not perfect!” Harry yelled, finally losing his temper.  “I’m hurt!  I’ve been hurt!  You don’t profane me.  Draco, you heal me.”
Draco nodded.  “I don’t suppose you’d appreciate me going there without your permission, but I need to check some things.”
Harry sucked for a messy moment, and then it came—too thick and too hard into his arse, thrusting without any gentleness or finesse, and Harry moaned. He moaned with the slight pain of it and the onslaught of pleasure, the way it immediately was methodically fucking his guts. Harry moaned more as it fucked, drooling over Draco’s cock.
Over a week had passed since Draco had turned eighteen and Harry had gone back to stay at Grimmauld Place, but Harry had come every time his Patronus had alerted him that Draco was a new age.  When Harry came on the day Draco turned twenty-three, Draco was already in the lab again.
Harry stared at him, Draco’s tense little back.  The tips of his ears were red, and Harry didn’t really know what Draco was asking, but he was sure Draco himself didn’t quite know what he was asking either.  Earlier, Harry had been convinced Draco was asking whether his grown-up self was sleeping with Harry, but this seemed different.  Draco wanted to know whether Harry cared for him, and yet it still seemed to embarrass him.  Possibly with Lucius discouraging anything remotely homosexual, he’d also censured discussions of feelings.
“Magical nuns are very powerful,” Malfoy said primly, looking more than ever like a nun in his high collar.
Harry moved up so his eyes could meet Draco’s, Harry’s hand settling around Draco’s cock, the hairband tight at the base. “Let me take it off.”
Thank you to all of you who have been patiently reading and waiting and to those of you who have left kind and thoughtful comments. I've read them all and treasured all the kind things that have been said, even though I haven't been in a place where it was easy for me to reply. <3
Rainy April extended into the longer days of May. Harry was glad of shorter evenings, which meant less time tossing and turning, trying to find sleep. It felt more respectable coming to work with the dawn rather than before it, and the final week of exams found him in his office before the campus was swarmed with trainees.
“I once had a sex dream about Nearly Headless Nick. I had that embarrassed ‘I can never talk to anyone again’ voice nearly all of sixth year.”
Malfoy still hadn’t turned.  Annoyed, Harry grabbed his shoulder to force him to do it, but as soon as Harry touched him, Malfoy jerked away, stumbling into a stack of the boxes on the floor.  In the process he’d turned around.
“You still like me though,” Draco said after a while.  “You still like me even though I got you in detention.”
“I knew what you were trying to do.” Teddy’s voice was slow. “With the press conference. The things you said.”
“Thirdly,” Draco repeated again, softening his grip on Harry’s hand.  “I became convinced that if you couldn’t—you couldn’t even comfort a boy who was crying his eyes out because he just lost his mum—if you really hated me that much, you would never feel anything different for me.  Before that, I’d thought—I’d thought maybe, just maybe, if I waited long enough and tried hard enough, maybe—in ten or twenty years or so—maybe you could come around enough to—to at least—at least kiss me.  Once.  God.”  Draco looked away.  “I was so pathetic.  That was as high as my aspirations went.  All I wanted was for you to kiss me.”
Malfoy, who was beaming, nevertheless looked very startled to be so included, and nearly fluttered as Andromeda threw her arms around him.
“By having to hold my dick every other second because I want to come from your touch, just like a teenager?” Draco was facing him, but he still wouldn’t lift his eyes. His body was still flushed pink.
“Don’t touch,” Draco tried to say, but Harry was already touching him, trying to get him to lie down.  This was an absolutely stupid fucking idea, which Draco proved when he shook himself away from Harry’s grasp and cracked one of the scabs open, beginning to bleed again.
Harry didn’t ask it, because it highlighted just how much it had not occurred on him to call Luna just for the sake of her company, even though that was all he really wanted tonight.
“Er.”  Harry definitely remembered.  When he’d been searching for someone besides Malfoy who could help him with the Wood-Eye Lye, Mrs. Mulpepper had been eager to assist.  She had also been fantastically bad at it, pouring things in and out of the Wood-Eye Lye for an hour before Harry had realized she had no idea what she was doing.
“Do you need an ointment?” Harry said, already turning away. He kept a magical first aid kit in the room, just in case of magical injury during classes. “I could—”
Thank you for all of you who have been so patient and so kind over the long process of writing this story. I'm afraid this one just didn't come easily, but it was nice knowing that so many of you cared.
“But you know where it is?” Draco said eagerly.  “Is it in the Caribbean?  I’ve heard it’s in the Caribbean.  Are you going to the Caribbean?  I want to go to the Caribbean.  Some of the spells are different in the Americas, you know, and they’ve got coconuts—”
The view on the IC:WUT/UC swung away again, showing the door, the marbles. “Really, any time now.” Malfoy’s voice was tremulous under his breath.
“Most children your age have learned a bit more control.”  Mister Malfoy’s voice was still kind, even though he was saying Harry was bad.  Harry had heard that before, too.
“Fuck.” Harry had to close his eyes at the expression on Draco’s face. Fuck. It was too much. It was too much. “Touch me,” he heard himself beg, his voice ragged. “Draco.”
Draco blinked, then pulled away from Harry’s thigh. When he looked back, his eyes were larger, his mouth somehow redder. “You want,” he croaked, then cleared his throat. Then his hands were like claws on Harry’s thighs, his hips, Draco scrambling up Harry’s body until he stood on his own two feet. “That’s something you—is that something you want?” Draco’s breath was harsh, his hands still gripping Harry’s hips, his body swaying close. “To get fucked?”
“All right,” Harry said, even though it seemed kind of early for Draco to have to stop himself from coming.
Someone came out of the Pallas Arch, and a few of the reporters turned to see who it was and whether it was someone they would attack with questions, but most stayed focused on Harry and Lee, who was opening his mouth again.
“Of course, Auror Potter.  Only, we small business owners have to contend with so much.  Surely you can understand—”
Harry sighed. Vinicius had become an Auror shortly after Harry. They had begun to be friends in the early years Harry had been a part of the Auror force, but they had lost touch when Vinicius had become a liaison with MACUSA when Baggot had retired from the force. After ten years as a liaison, Vinicius had asked to be transferred back to the UK and had re-joined the Auror force. He hadn’t really remained in touch with Harry during his absence, but at the holiday party Vinicius had been charming and handsome. He’d had a crush on Harry before he’d left for the States, he’d admitted. When he’d invited Harry back to his flat, Harry had thought,
“Don’t be daft.  I’m thirty-two.”  The words didn’t have any real scorn in them, and Draco sounded sad, almost.  He looked across at the fire crackling in the hearth.  “
Harry himself wanted to visit Kavika, but Kingsley was partially responsible for Harry’s current anxieties, and Harry wasn’t sure he wouldn’t blame him if he talked to Kavika about what was bothering him. He didn’t want to put her in the position of having to defend her husband.
Fairchild behaving in her capacity as a member of our law-abiding Force?” asked Pillwickle. “Or did she aid and abet a vigilante organization to monitor the wards and pursue criminals at their own discretion, rather than seek aid of law enforcement? And if I’m not mistaken, one of our other trainees joined in this criminal activity as well.” Pillwickle smirked at Harry. “Or did you come to plead the case of your favourite little trainee once more?”
. The bench was cold under him; he could feel it through his jeans. It should be wet, but he couldn’t feel that, so he put his hands on either side of his thighs to wrap around the edge of the bench and squeeze. It was stone. Porous. Not as wet as he would have thought.
Greengrass tried to reply, but Savage yelled and Fudge yipped and Spragg began to move forward and Ron moved to intercede and more people were there and the chandelier overhead jerked on its ancient chains. Christ, it was going to fall on them. It was going to fall on them and they were all going to die.
Harry hurried to catch up, following Mister Malfoy, who lit up sconces on the wall as they went down the stairs.  “They have big machines,” Harry said, hopping down the steps.  Though he was downcast he hadn’t been able to convince Mister Malfoy to let him stay, he was very interested in the prospects of a magic lab.  “And they have lots of glass things with things bubbling and test tubes.  And they have a bed with straps and a way to get lightening.”
“You don’t tell anybody, do you?” Draco said quietly.  “About the books.  I just assumed you knew, but—you keep it a secret.  Don’t you?”
Draco shuddered at the name, but then let out a loud “Ha!”, this time in triumph.  “You’re wrong.  You killed him!  You said so—you killed him!”
“Now I’m going to put my other about your neck,” Harry said, then spoke over Malfoy’s shoulder to the class. “Remind your partner what you’re going to do when you’re going slow. When you practice, everything should feel comfortable. Malfoy,” Harry added, very softly, “relax.”
“In society,” Kavika said. “Not in your heart. You don’t have to learn to love Draco Malfoy, Harry. You don’t even have to accept the new person that he is.”
on the Timothy Tree, where the rain puddled in a leaf loosed fat drops one by one onto a leaf below.
All of his muscles were tensed in anticipatory dread, his bed drenched in sweat. He couldn’t seem to catch his breath. Gasping, he tried to throw the covers back, fighting with them, forgetting before he found his wand and Banished them. “Lumos,” he demanded, clapping his hand over his glasses, shoving them onto his face. “Accio glass. Aguamenti,” he added, once the glass was almost in his hand, and he could aim the water into it. He brought the glass up to his lips while his wand was still spurting. He should have cast Malfoy’s ice water spell.
Then he was pressing up against, Harry, all of him, Draco’s long bare body pressing against his, Draco’s mouth pressing against his, Draco’s leg pressing between his. He pulled away from Harry’s mouth with a satisfied little noise. “Rut against me,” he whispered, nudging his thigh higher between Harry’s own. “Use me; use my body. Use me for anything; pleasure yourself on me.”
Draco sat on the floor by the bed, his knees up with his face against them.  He’d changed his clothes, and the silver fox was sitting beside him, looking forlornly at Draco’s shaking shoulders.
Robards was having his afternoon tea, just as he always did, as though nothing in the world could ever go wrong.  “I’m afraid you’ll have to be more specific.”
Teddy’s Order of the Phoenix was trying to put in place measures that would help the non-magical world integrate with the magical, whether there was a Deal or not. One measure was the educational facilities, where non-magical people could learn about magical people, and magical people could learn about non-magical.
“I could be persuaded,” Teddy said, as easily as he said everything, but Harry could tell he was pleased. Taking Nyala’s hand, they turned toward the dance floor. “Tell Vinicius sorry,” Teddy said over his shoulder, as Nyala swept him away.
Harry thought he knew what Luna was saying: that the danger was worth it. Perhaps, by infiltrating the Neo Death Eater meeting at Windermere Hall, Malfoy was escaping his own dungeon.
Snape had come right away the first time it had happened, and Draco’s ageing was being sped up a good deal, so it should already be over, but it wasn’t.  Draco was still scrambling at his wet shirt, his breath coming in little hitches.  “What?” he gasped out.  “What—?”  He was looking at Harry, fully awake.
Harry was beginning to realize Mister Malfoy paused like that when he was disturbed by something.  It was very different to what Aunt Petunia did, which was to screech and shout and lock him in cupboards, and to what Uncle Vernon did, which was to grab him and shove him about.  Once when he’d got very, very angry, Vernon had knocked over a plant and broken the pot, sending dirt flying in a streak across the floor.  The way Mister Malfoy reacted made it rather hard to notice what things he didn’t like, but Harry was fairly certain Mister Malfoy hadn’t liked him falling off the stool.  Harry didn’t even know why he’d flinched.  Uncle Vernon had never hit him, so he didn’t have anything to be afraid of.
“Yes, Harry.” Draco’s voice was a soft ripple over him. “That’s some very good and proper begging. You like begging, don’t you? You like begging me.”
Vinicius seemed satisfied with the arrangement, though obviously interested in Harry. Maybe it could work out, if they got to know each other better. Maybe deeper feelings would come with time.
His thumb a bright purple, Harry had followed Draco upstairs to get their brooms.  In the afternoon they usually did other things while ingredients for the potions simmered or dried.  On two of the days they had gone flying at the green place in Wiltshire, and on one of those days Draco had showed Harry how wizards duel.
“Some. They’re—it’s better. But I still have nightmares, sometimes. I had them less. When I was—when I had a regular therapist.”
“I’ve got a student coming,” Harry said, glancing at the clock. His office hours were almost over, and Malfoy still hadn’t come.
Draco shuddered violently, making this horrified little noise. His eyes filling with something almost like panic, he bit his lip, squeezed his eyes shut, and looked away, flinging his hand down between his legs to squeeze his dick at the base so he couldn’t come. Fuck. Draco wanted to come just from that; Harry could feel it in the tremor that had gone through Draco’s body. Harry could see it, the violent flush coursing over Draco’s naked chest.
The brilliant light spilling from the veranda only just illuminated the tightening muscle beside Travers’s mouth.
“What is it, Potter?” Malfoy went on.  “Having had these Death Eater lips touch your perfect saviour skin, would you like to enact some form of punishment?”
, because then it was either Kingsley or Hermione herself, but Rune was eager not to leave Harry out, and he was rapidly explaining.
“Reveal is a risk,” Harry said. “We can all agree about that. But don’t give me this shite about pure-blood ‘way of life’. If you don’t think there are pure-bloods out there who want to destroy the current administration any way they can, you’re being wilfully ignorant.”
“Then why did you tell me?  You said he didn’t want me to know!  Is that why we’re not friends when I’m grown-up?”  Harry turned back to Draco.  “Did old-me made you think that because you did one bad thing, you had to do everything yourself all the time, and no one would ever help you?”
, Harry didn’t add, because books didn’t seem important right now—but they were.  They were to Draco.  They would be important to Draco, so they were important to Harry.
“Harry,” Draco said, but then didn’t say anything else.  Bending down, he carefully moved Harry’s hair—Harry guessed he had his scar back, and then Draco was putting Harry’s glasses over his eyes.  “
“Is this the same Order of the Phoenix dropping wards around the country?” Penelope asked. “Because if so, they are terrorists. Reveal
Harry’s brain was already too crowded to think about this; there had been too many people. He was already dreading the post-graduation celebration. “Right,” he said, stopping in the corridor near the stairs. “Listen, you go on without me, okay? I’m going to pop up to my office and square things away before the pub.”
This was also the reason being Malfoy’s instructor in that same subject was so difficult. Failing a trainee was much more difficult when you suspected yourself of being in love with him.
“It’s not me!” the figure said in reply, so panicked and desperate to be believed that Harry thought they must be telling the truth.
“Well,” Draco said.  “I’m not sure I like her—ow!”  Heloise gently closed her beak on the shell of his ear.
“Maybe don’t point it at glass,” Harry suggested, because of how violently Malfoy was waving his wand.  With the way Malfoy was doing it, if the beaker ever did levitate it was going to go crashing down again almost immediately.
Draco had gone pale again, looking from the slugs sliming their way out of Alby’s mouth, back up to Harry.
Draco’s arm slid around Harry’s shoulders.  The book on Harry’s lap wasn’t that heavy; he wasn’t really sure what Draco’s problem with it was, but now that he was sitting close to Draco it felt very nice.  Draco’s body was warm and solid, and he smelled like fish and chips and squid ink, and Harry had never sat with anyone’s arm around him before, even though he’d seen other people do it all the time.
“Do you honestly think the Honourable Lucius Malfoy wants his son to become an Auror?” said Greengrass from the hearth. He was examining his nails. “Really. It’s beneath him.”
“The wizarding world is an incestuous loop,” Kavika agreed. “This is the real reason we need Reveal: new blood.”
“Who?” Malfoy frowned down at Ron and Hermione’s dead bodies, and then, recognizing them, began to stifle a laugh. Soon he was guffawing.
“No,” Kavika agreed, “but if you think he’s doing it for your attention, you could tell him how it makes you feel. See what he says.”
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Come off it, Malfoy.  You wouldn’t question me while I was on Veritaserum.”
“Harry,” Draco said, his voice sounding exactly like comfort should sound.  “Oh, my darling.  Harry.”  Then Draco was pulling Harry to him, guiding Harry’s head, just like Harry had tried to do for him, only the way Draco did it was perfect, because he was murmuring and stroking Harry’s hair and saying things like, “Harry, don’t cry,” and, “I’m here.  It’s me.  Shh.  I’m here.”
“Why would the Board allow blood discrimination to continue?” another reporter asked. They were one of Luna’s, from
“The wizard who killed your parents lived in that house for two years.  It became an—an evil place, and no one should ever want to go back to it.  For years, not even the grass would grow here.  The flowers are only just starting to return.”
“Before that, I used to have it with my sisters,” Andromeda went on.  “Narcissa used to make the fire rainbow-coloured.”
“Like locking someone in a cupboard,” Harry said.  “Sometimes for a whole week, and not getting to eat proper meals.”
“What would you prefer I call you?”  Mister Malfoy asked, turning away to clear a spot on the table.
Harry looked over his shoulder in surprise, but Draco never seemed to notice or care when he contradicted himself.  An explanation that Harry was doing exactly what Draco had told him to would probably not be welcome just now, and for the first time, Tailored Tinctures and Draco’s flat felt too small.  Harry felt like he couldn’t breathe.  He wanted to get out, but he couldn’t leave Draco alone here.  Upstairs would be better at least, away from that bedroom where Draco had awakened over and over again hating him.
“I forgot all about your Muggle relatives,” Andromeda said, looking thoughtful.  “I’m surprised they’re still around.”
Ludville had been taken to Azkaban for holding to await her trial.  When Harry went to the prison, however, he found that Ludville had been transferred.  “Who signed the order?” Harry asked, afraid that he already knew.  Only a few people were authorized to transfer prisoners out of Azkaban.
“He was,” Greengrass agreed pleasantly. “Recently Astoria’s began to find him . . . unreliable. Unpredictable. It’s a shame, really. One would think the union of Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Black would produce an extraordinary heir, but instead we are left with this . . . little scrap of nothing, really.”
They went to the Leaky.  Harry gave Draco black hair and green eyes and a foot in height but didn’t manage the beard or the scar.  Just to ‘amuse himself,’ as adult-Draco had said, Harry gave himself blond hair and grey eyes, fixed his eyes so he didn’t have to wear his glasses, and hid the beard and scar.  At the inn, Draco did make fun of the lighting, and the floor, and the furniture, and Lucille, the waitress.  He also peevishly said something about reading the menu to Harry, but once they got their Butterbeers he said, “You like Butterbeer as well?”
No one had ever said anything like that to Harry before.  Harry lifted an arm, fully intending to push Draco off of him, but that wasn’t what he intended at all.  His arm went around Draco’s waist, then tried to hold him closer.  Then he was doing it with his other arm too, and the tears were pricking behind Harry’s eyes again.  “I don’t want you to leave me,” he heard himself say, and his voice sounded bad.  It sounded so bad, with a big crack in the middle, and wet directly afterwards.  His voice sounded wet.
, or something like that, but he couldn’t think of the words.  Again, he wanted to hug him, but Draco wasn’t doing it and initiating felt so awkward.  At a loss for what else to do, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand.
The problem was that Harry just wasn’t smart enough to put the parts of this case together.  A couple years ago, he would’ve taken the problem to Malfoy.  Malfoy was brilliant and so clever, he’d see all the connections instantly, except Malfoy only took meetings by appointment, now.  Harry didn’t know what to put down for an appointment—
Harry hitched a shoulder.  “No one ever wants to hear my jokes.  Mostly I have to say them in my head.”
“Let’s send this back, shall we?” Draco said, snatching away the red and gold gown, then sweeping off to rewrap it.
“We went to school together, didn’t we?”  Malfoy didn’t even wait for an answer.  “Of course, we would know each other.  You’re famous, and I’m—well.  We were friends, then?  I always thought we would be.  Father must be so—well, but you’ll have met my father, wouldn’t you have?  You know how he is.  Anyway, he said I should get to know you.  Were we in the same House?  Did we play Quidditch?”
Harry thought about the topical analgesic, since he truly did feel poorly.  It would probably ease the ache in his throat, or at least alleviate the cough.  Harry thought about how Malfoy said he would rub the cream onto Harry’s throat, and then he did what Malfoy had told him to do and went away.
“Uhn!” Harry shouted, convulsing on the bed, but Draco just held on, and then he began to fuck, and fuck, and fuck.
—eager and hopeful and a little vulnerable.  Harry hadn’t heard him sound like that in weeks, which for Draco had been years.  This was what Draco sounded like with his defences down, when he was completely open—when he wasn’t hiding or blocking anything, when he was confident enough in what he was doing that he could be himself.
His face wasn’t going red like Uncle Vernon’s—not like Uncle Vernon’s at all.  If anything, it was getting paler.  Paler and paler, his mouth going hard and flat, instead of open and yelling.  His hand, though—Mister Malfoy’s hand was closing into a fist, tighter and tighter, and the knuckles were white.  It wasn’t moving, but Harry started backing up.  He backed up until he was against the wall, wanting to block his glasses again—and yet, somehow, he knew that that would make Mister Malfoy madder still.
thing; it has to push the Force and the Academy out of existence. Why is Spragg even here, if he just wants to pull the whole thing down?”
“I’m saying, we need to be careful,” said Hermione. “If people break the Statute willy-nilly, it makes the Deal that much harder. It’s already hard enough as it is.”
Harry took the wand, just so the light would stop shining in his face.  Draco moved his head and shoulders back to his bunk.
Draco stepped in, his movements so precise, just like Harry remembered.  “It’s still dark in this foyer.”  Taking out his wand, Draco pointed it at the ceiling.  “
“Draco Malfoy.” Luna closed her eyes. She wasn’t wearing any top, and the moon bathed her breasts a luminescent colour under the film of bright water. Her eyes popped open. “You know he kept me in a dungeon? He didn’t come to save me, anyway.”
Releasing Harry’s lip, Malfoy’s mouth closed over his, lips moving over Harry’s in such a slow, hot gentle way that Harry shuddered.  Oh God.  He hadn’t done this in so long.  No one had kissed him in so long.  He’d been too busy; he’d been too focused.  He’d been disinterested, because there was no one he’d wanted to kiss—but he’d been wrong.  He’d been wrong, because there was Malfoy, the lazy wet thorough exploration of Malfoy’s mouth on his.
Draco looked down at him, a smile turning softly on the side of his nice-looking mouth in the glowing starlight.  “Well, there was a very vain queen named Cassiopeia,” he said, then told the story of the queen who was punished for her vanity.
Harry showed up at Tailored Tinctures the next day with a Pensieve and shopping.  The Pensieve he left downstairs; the shopping he brought upstairs, where he knocked on the door.  Draco opened the door, and Harry almost dropped the bags.
“Right.” Harry ripped off his glasses. It was something to do, and he didn’t want to have to look at these people. “What about human culture?”
“Edgar Travers? Over there.” Malfoy waved vaguely in the direction of the figure Harry had been watching earlier.
By the time Harry was done, Draco appeared thoroughly ensconced in reading.  Harry went to check on the potion downstairs, leaving his Patronus with Draco.  The potion appeared fine, so Harry came back upstairs, lighting another fire in the hearth.  Thinking of what Andromeda had said about Draco and hearths, Harry cast a few of the colour spells again and opened up the ledger to read it again.  He wanted to make sure he understood the cure, but he found himself mostly just looking at Draco’s handwriting.  Everything about it was neat, precise.  Controlled.
On the day it was raining in Wiltshire, they didn’t go flying, but did stop potion work so that Draco could teach Harry a game called Exploding Snap.  They played it ten times, and Harry watched very closely to see whether Draco was cheating, but he didn’t seem to be.  “You hated it so much last time,” Draco said, when Harry pointed this out.
“Yes,” Harry said, remembering how hard this had been for him to believe.  He wasn’t sure he’d ever believed it entirely; he’d just trusted Draco so completely that it hadn’t mattered.
“They’re right here.”  Harry set the jar on the table, hesitating.  “I hate your job at Slug and Jiggers,” he said, after a moment.  “Your boss is abusive.”
“Fuck you?” Draco asked calmly, with those same long strokes sculpting Harry’s cock to attention, drawing it higher and harder and hotter. “Or get you harder?”
Draco’s lips twitched—something like a smile, but something like a frown too.  “You’re very fond of reminding me of that fact.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, trying to think of something to say.  “You’re an excellent potions consultant.”
“Why did you have to have your hair cut?” Harry asked, remembering Draco had said something about it before.
“Good.” Draco’s voice was low and hot, a vibration against Harry’s throat, his hand slowly stroking up Harry’s cock, then back down.
buy her bonbons; he’d probably still go see her every day after work, every morning once he got Tailored Tinctures.  He’d still wear his hair short and pretend he didn’t like blokes, because what mattered was that his crazy Mum in the Janus Thickey Ward not worry about him.  A life of his own didn’t matter to him at all, and Harry wondered if it ever would.
“Don’t worry,” Malfoy said, sweeping through the sun-dappled room toward one of the Pensieves. “It’s not pornography.”
Malfoy looked a little speechless, possibly with happiness. His cheeks were so flushed it made the little blond left in his hair stand out. “I didn’t—didn’t occur to me.” He coughed, and Andromeda squeezed him again.
Harry felt the cold air. He smelled the wet leaves. The cold of the bench should have seeped into his robes by now, chilling his thighs, but it did not. His body temperature remained his own, as though encased in a bubble.
So, Harry followed Mister Malfoy, who seemed to be following his stick up a set of concrete stairs attached to the estate.  They went up two storeys, then down a covered concrete hall open to the air on one side but filled with numbered doors and potted plants on the other.  They stopped at door 127.  “Probably best to stay out of sight,” Mister Malfoy said, leading Harry to stand behind the plant, then pointing his stick at him.
, she’s not right.  She isn’t a pure-blood; she won’t give you pure-blood babies.  You wouldn’t be doing your duty, because she’s a filthy fucking—”
“Come off it.” Harry shoved him, feeling phenomenally better at this evidence that Malfoy was distracted—not that Harry had really expected Malfoy to do anything. Ever since the Patronus incident, Malfoy had barely spoken two words together in Harry’s classes and had barely deigned to look at him—though Malfoy’s coursework had mildly improved.
Harry cleaned up again, considering giving up.  Instead, he went back into the kitchen and got another sandwich and another glass of milk, then brought them out to Draco.
“Vince really loved fire,” Draco said, almost wistfully.  “When he learned Incendio he was so happy.  He was good at so very little.”
“I called this press conference because the Board of Regents should have to answer for their behaviour,” Harry said. “They should have to answer for why they allow purism and blood discrimination at their Academy, and why the only punishment for hate-speech is two weeks of suspension. They should have to answer for why the trainee responsible should be allowed to return to Academy at all.”
Andromeda looked down at him, her brown eyes measuring.  “I suppose,” she said finally.  “If it means so much to you.”
“It worked just fine.”  Then they were entering the lab, and Draco went on, “We need to leave this place, Harry.  It’s not safe here anymore.”  Even as he spoke, Draco was packing the papers from Vance into a leather satchel.  Then he pointed his wand about the lab, shrinking notes, bottles, and ingredients and adding them to the bag.
Even if it didn’t taste like a cake, Harry sort of wanted some.  He was pretty hungry, and he’d only had half of his hot chocolate.
“Oh, I know,” Harry said, turning back to see where Malfoy and Astoria had gone. They were already making their way through the room, greeting Fairchild and Mark, Achar—members of the new Order. “What?” Harry said, turning back to Ron again.
“Because you know I’m just helping you read.  I do it like this with Vince.  He doesn’t think I’m a freak.  He knows I’m just helping him.”
“Potter,” Mister Malfoy said again, still seeming at a loss.  His lips quirked, almost a smile, but then he swallowed it.  “Potter, I would—I would never put you in a cupboard.”
“More like acquaintances then?” Malfoy said, sounding so casual that he was very obviously disappointed.  He was poking through the objects on the lab bench as if he already knew he lived here—running his finger along the edge of the empty Pensieve, poking balls of fluff and curling his lip at them.  Absently, he picked up a dried flower and smelled it, as though he didn’t even notice he was doing it.
“At this rate,” Harry said, “I’m not sure I’ll even get into the Academy. You lot have a habit of blocking the entrance.”
“What happened with the books—that’s accidental magic.”  Mister Malfoy’s voice sounded gentler now.  “It happens when a magical child is scared, stressed, or hurt.  You’re saying that’s never happened to you before?”
“Shh,” said Mister Malfoy.  “Harry, it’s okay.  Please, you’re okay.  It’s all right.  You’re all right.”
“Like that,” Harry said, hands going to the fastening of Draco’s trousers. “That was good.” Draco’s hips gave a little jerk, Harry guessed because he was getting Draco’s trousers off. They were old-fashioned, buttons all the way down. Harry was beginning to hate buttons, particularly without his glasses, except that Draco was strangely still under Harry’s hands, as though he was afraid that if he moved, Harry would stop. Harry sort of wanted to tell Draco that nothing other than the word, “Stop,” would stop him right now, but he didn’t. Instead Harry worked on getting the final button, and then Draco’s trousers were open, and Harry tugged on them a bit to slide them farther down Draco’s hips. Then Harry’s hand was on Draco’s underwear, pulling it down, freeing Draco’s cock.
“Kingsley already has an Order of the Phoenix,” Harry tried to say, but Teddy was already shaking his head.
“Oh,” Malfoy said.  “As if you didn’t expect me to drop everything, just because you arrive in the middle of the night in all your Auror splendour and say ‘Malfoy, I need you,’ ‘Malfoy, I trust you more than anyone’.”  His voice was bitter, mocking.  “Did you really expect me to refuse?”
“Of course, it worked.  The powder causes anyone wearing it to become irresistibly attractive to anyone who sees them.  I’m not attracted to you at all now, so it’s obviously working.”
Harry waited, wanting to hear whether this thought made sense, wanting to hear that it was comprehensible, valid in some way, excusable, realistic, something. Milligan waited too. At last she said, “So, is Vinicius that person?”
Kavika’s brow knit in slight confusion. “I think I’ve lost the thread of the conversation, Harry. If he had nothing to do with Travers, why are you disappointed in him?”
The next morning, they had cereal again for breakfast.  Harry tried to convey with his reaction to this that he was not nearly as impressed by Andromeda’s breakfasts as he was by Draco’s, but Harry didn’t actually want to be rude to Andromeda, so he wasn’t sure Draco got the message.  Afterwards Draco said they were going back to his shop.
Harry’s warm words hadn’t made Malfoy blush, as Harry had half expected. Malfoy didn’t even seem to have heard them, and then Harry realized what he was doing—keeping Malfoy after class.
“I told you,” Harry said.  “I’m not arresting him.  I—he’s helping me,” he went on, desperate for the crying to stop.  “Malfoy’s helping me with something.”
“Yes, well. I shouldn’t have done it for you, or else you’d know that when the International Statute of Secrecy went into effect, it was ostensibly about the law.”
“With that magnificent lab I’ve got?”  Draco capped the phial.  “Don’t be absurd, Potter.  Of course, I can do it.”
Chuckling, Ron let him go, and they walked into Bickford-Buckley, into its cool dark halls, deficient of people in this happy hour, while everyone else milled about in the square, speaking of Malfoy.
Harry knew this confusion.  He was so familiar with it, and when Draco was eleven and every year he’d remembered since then, Draco had talked around this as though it were perfectly acceptable to talk about which boys you found cute as long as you didn’t mention being attracted to them.  If Draco had ever mentioned it directly, he’d hurled slurs and insults, some of them as vicious as anything he’d ever said about Muggles or Hermione, and Harry had just assumed it would be a while until Draco outgrew that.  Perhaps he never had, and yet he’d talked about it so gently with Harry over that game of Exploding Snap, when Harry had been eleven and it hadn’t even occurred to him that gay people existed.
Harry frowned, but not because he didn’t know where this was going. Even though the first time Harry had reviewed a memory with Kavika, he hadn’t been sure what the point was, he had soon come to learn that reliving things could be helpful. Even though he remembered the past, walking through it now as an adult could bring new things to light. The problem was, there were just so many memories to choose from.
“No,” Harry said stubbornly.  “I’m still . . .”  Picking up his fork, he loaded it up and tried to eat the bite.  He honestly tried, but when it got to his lips, he just couldn’t do it.
“Why do you have to be so . . .”  Draco pressed his lips together, breathing hard through his nose.  His eyes were bright.  “Fuck,” he said, expelling a breath.  He leaned in close, forehead almost touching Harry’s again, but Harry’s glasses were in the way.  “Why do you always have to be so bloody hot,” he muttered.
Ron had his hands in his own pockets, and his gaze on Harry was clear, open, and kind. “At the Auror Department. When everyone had Apparated to Windermere, and the Dementor was Kissing Malfoy. I heard you tell him how to cast a Patronus.”
“Yes,” Duggins was saying. He hesitated. “I mean—plenty of people are quite upset about the appointment. Understandably so, given that some of Minister Fudge’s policy positions are less than palatable.”
Christ.  It wasn’t even Malfoy’s fault.  Harry had drunk the Veritaserum and the Firewhiskey.  Malfoy hadn’t planned it at all.  He’d done nothing wrong; Harry had just—babbled like a fool, and he wasn’t even sure why he’d done it.  Malfoy had just . . . been there.  And he’d asked—sort of.  Not really.  Christ.
“Fuck.”  Ron stood up.  “Mate.”  Then he came around on the other side of the sofa, so he could put his hand on Harry’s other shoulder.
When Savage reported having seen Harry in the Auror Office, Vance had broken into Grimmauld Place in hopes of stealing evidence that would lead Harry to the warehouse, not knowing Harry had already been.  Savage had left out the fact that Draco had been with Harry, because Vance had only commanded her to tell him about Harry.
“Fuck,” Malfoy said again.  His voice was soft.  “I’ll bet you would.  Harry Potter, saviour of the fucking world.”
“Um.” Harry licked his lips, and then Harry saw that Draco’s ears were pierced.  Several times.  One of them was, anyway; Harry couldn’t see Draco’s other ear with the way his head was angled.  Harry couldn’t see any earrings in the ear that was visible, just little holes.  Draco would have woken up with the holes; his older self didn’t necessarily have earrings sitting about waiting to be worn.  Harry had never noticed Draco having any piercings when Harry had first met him again at Slug and Jiggers, but Teddy had said Draco had had them.  Draco had
“Hullo, Instructor Potter,” said Malfoy’s soft voice, and Harry felt like it opened a lock inside of him.
“I didn’t know what to do,” Harry said.  “I wanted to help you—but I didn’t know how.  I didn’t know what you wanted.”
“Right,” Harry said slowly. “I have to go to my office and prepare for the day. If you don’t have a difference of opinion.”
“I know.” Ron grasped his shoulder, squeezed, and let go. Then he was moving through the crowd, winding his way to Hermione, who always spent these holiday parties doing way too much politics.
“All right,” Harry said loudly. “Now we’re going to talk about how spells we don’t think of as combat spells—Riddikulus, Expelliarmus, Tarantellegra—can be used to fight even the darkest of dark arts, because the opponent doesn’t necessarily expect them.”
Harry remembered how Draco had looked sixth year.  Harry knew now that Draco had been afraid, that his paleness had been dread, the pinched lines by his eyes and mouth weariness, his sneers his only defence against a horror that had been eating him from the inside out.  All the life had seemed sapped from him then, weighing his shoulders down, and Draco now looked nothing like he had then.  His face was frantic, vital with distress and panic.  This was not the slow sucking power of terror over time; this was the abrupt and violent collapse of a whole world.
“Right. All right.” After scribbling something on his pad, Duggins flipped through it, checking various notes. At last, he looked up. He was still flushed, but that was just his complexion, and Harry shouldn’t be holding it against him. “Do you want to talk about Minister Fudge, then?”
“Oh.”  Draco flopped back into his corner of the couch, but this time he curled up instead of sprawling out.  After a while, he said, “I used to want to be a dragon tamer.”
“What?” Malfoy said, dreamy and dazed. His eyes came open, half-lidded. His lips were wet, and Harry wondered how he could have thought Malfoy wasn’t beautiful—even with full knowledge of exactly how.
A look of naked surprise crossed Malfoy’s face in a way that made him look strangely vulnerable, bright grey eyes too wide in his narrow face.  Then the mask slipped in place—that old mask that made him no less lovely, just completely inaccessible.  Sometimes Harry wondered what he had done to make Malfoy dislike him so much.  “I’m not going anywhere with you,” he said coldly.
“Angry,” Harry said, then was surprised he had said it, because the point was the coffee had been good. Walking into his office, where he could finally be in the quiet, away from everybody else, and finding coffee hot and waiting for him had been good. Knowing someone hadn’t felt the need to talk to him or greet him or demand things from him, that Harry had got to have this warm sweet little thing just for himself—it had been so good. The only problem was that—“It was Malfoy,” Harry said.
“Harry. Harry.” Then he was pushing Harry away with his other hand—doing it again, teasing him, and Harry just wanted to be close together; he wanted them to be close—Harry didn’t know what he said, but Draco said, “Shh. Harry. Let me get on top of you. I promise I won’t stop touching you; I promise. I’ll touch you forever.”
“Checking your blood.”  Mister Malfoy wrote something down on the parchment, then turned back to Harry, making another movement with his stick.  “
Harry didn’t know what exorbitant meant, but he did get some information from this.  “Is that why you’re the only one I can trust?”
The words came out before Harry knew what he was going to say, and then they were there, and he couldn’t take them back.  “I’ll snog you.”
Mister Malfoy just sighed.  “I was used to getting my way.  You obviously are too.  There was no possibility, in retrospect, that we would work well together.”
“But how could you not . . .”  Draco’s face was splotching up with colour.  “I mean.  Didn’t you . . . ?  And, and Oliver Wood.  You said—and he was—I thought you meant—?”
Possibly Malfoy deserved to be embarrassed; he’d spent a decent percentage of his life trying to embarrass Harry. Harry still pitied him.
Sensing that this was about to get out of hand very quickly, Harry put his wand to his throat, amplifying his voice. “She didn’t mean the world is ending,” he said over the crowd. “She meant because this is a change not only for the non-magical world, but for our own.”
When Harry moved, he could not tell whether they saw him. When he reached the door, he could not tell whether they tried to stop him. He did not feel as though he was there at all, winding down the stone steps, striding down the stone corridor, pushing on the wooden door, into the cool winter air, across the stone walkway of the cloisters, onto the dead grass.
“Indeed.”  Mister Malfoy took something out of one of the cabinets, but it looked much more like bread than cake, and Harry tried not to feel disappointed.  “I’ve realized it’s our in-between birthday.”
“Don’t you remember?” Dumbledore asked, and Harry did remember. Voldemort—no, Death Eaters—no, it had been someone they knew, a friend—someone had split pieces of their soul, long ago, and planted them inside of Ron and Hermione. Eventually, those pieces of soul had found their way out.
Pushing down his other emotions, Harry tried to keep his voice level.  “It’s close to supper-time.  You should eat something.”
“Potter,” Malfoy began, then stopped.  He picked up something on the tray.  “This is a topical analgesic.  I can rub it on your throat, so you can—”
brats,” Draco said, throwing the pillow aside.  “Do we have to wear disguises again?  I want to look like Professor Lockhart.”
“You don’t have to.” Malfoy’s voice was as light and quick as ever. “You shouldn’t have to. I was the one that—” Finally, he looked away. “I’ll go. I can drop out. I thought we could—I don’t know what I was thinking. It never would have worked.” Malfoy turned neatly, slipping his hands into his pockets, heading for the door.
Draco’s fork clattered on his plate.  Harry guessed maybe Draco’s table manners weren’t perfect either, since he was dropping cutlery on his dishes.  Or maybe he knew how Harry had slept in Dudley’s bed that one time.
“You were right,” Harry said, fingers brushing the back of his fist. “I shouldn’t have you plan my lessons for me.”
“You really are a dunce at potions,” Malfoy said, jerking a cutting board off of a shelf, then slamming it on the table.  “The lye is a diversionary tactic to make it harder to discern the potion’s key ingredients, and the dust from the wooden eyes makes it dangerous to test, even though the lye is highly diluted.”
Just.  The thought of Draco being open enough to be with someone like that made Harry want him more.
“You’re not here for stories of my school years.” Harry didn’t raise his voice, but silence usually fell when he talked anyway. “I’m not here to talk about them. I save that for my therapist.” Harry waited for the nervous laughter, which came like a slowly lapping wave, then quickly faded. “I’m here to teach you how to protect yourself. If you have questions about that, ask away. As for questions about Voldemort—”
“Right,” Harry said.  “What if you want to do something that’s important?  More important than whether people are nice to you.”
Malfoy’s indicator solution for Wood-Eye Lye worked beautifully.  Harry’s problems with the Auror Department, however, persisted.  Harry didn’t want to complain to anyone, so he didn’t—except for Malfoy, just every once in a while.  Most people didn’t understand the intricacies of his cases anyway, and those who did—such as Savage and Ron—were also part of the problem.  And then there was Auror Vance.
“You’d do well to remember that there was a war in the first place,” said Savage, who had become an instructor after her retirement. “I didn’t see you there fighting He Who Must Not Be Named.”
“Shh,” Draco said.  “I won’t leave you.  I won’t leave you.  Harry.”  Pushing back the fringe from Harry’s forehead, Draco kissed him.
Years ago, in the ancient stone basement that was the Ministry of Magic, Harry had sat in a similar room around a similar table. Harry remembered it now, the claustrophobic feel of it, the feeling that no one was talking about anything that was actually happening, the feeling that he couldn’t change it, even if he tried.
Then, grunting, Draco came, the beginning of his orgasm crashing with the end of Harry’s, hard and wet inside of Harry, so deep inside he couldn’t even feel the come, so hard for so long that Harry’s cock was almost loose and flopping as Draco fucked him through the end.
, and everything went back to its normal colour, lit by the burnished gold of the fire and candles still lit around the room.
If Proudfoot lost, Fudge would win. The Deal would be doomed, and Harry could not go to Kavika for help. The pub door opened and closed behind him, and Harry turned around.
“Kingsley is here?” Harry looked around, but they were in a corner of Knockturn Alley, and all he could see were a few Aurors whizzing by on broom above them.
“Probably,” Draco said, finally rising from his stool.  “But I’ve got to make enough money to keep her somewhere, and it should be comfortable, and she shouldn’t have to work.”
The fresh air was like a light breeze that had decided to be friends with Harry, touching his cheeks, too hot in the pub; stroking the back of his neck, sweaty under hair and his too-warm collar. When Harry looked to the right, the whole mass of cloaks had folded themselves neatly into a stack at the foot of the booth, tucked under Teddy’s chair.
When Harry had brought his ideas for the education centres to the group, Malfoy had been among the first to seize upon the idea, building on Harry’s preliminary suggestions. Since the fall, Harry and Malfoy had been two of the main people working on the project, and Harry felt some discomfort with it now, working so closely with Malfoy. After a half-hour or so, however, Harry wasn’t thinking of the memory in the Pensieve Yin had watched with him, because Malfoy was excited about all the things they could teach non-magicals, and things non-magicals might teach them. He got . . . bright, when he got interested; the yellow light of Rombe Pickle shone in his hair, his face flushed.
“I don’t remember her looking like that.” Harry finally looked away from her, back to Ron. “They bring their kids now?”
Harry took the crystals. Doctor Yin went back to gulping their smoothie, and Harry found that they were right. The way the crystals pulled together had a weird sort of tension that was interesting to manipulate. You could change the configuration, you could even put space between them, but eventually they snapped back.
, and the gun shot out a flag that said, “Bang!” The next trainee came up in the queue, and the Boggart shifted into a Death Eater for the next trainee and another Dementor for the trainee after that.
Malfoy scowled at him, looking spiky.  “I’m not allowed to use magic,” he bit out.  “All I have is potions.”  He seemed to be saying this to Harry more than Mrs. Mulpepper, but Mrs. Mulpepper was the one who responded.
Taking out his wand again, Harry banished the broken dishes, then cleaned up the food with spells as best he could.  Then he went into the kitchen, made another sandwich, and poured another glass of milk.
There had been gold coins in one of the pockets of a coat in the cupboard, which Harry retrieved and shoved into the satchel.  Next, he found the small box on the bedside table, which Draco had said was a mobile phone.  It still didn’t look like a phone to Harry, but it appeared undisturbed since last time.  Harry guessed Vance hadn’t had a use for it—but Harry did.
This was all the good Yin had done, give him nightmares. Had Harry really needed to be reminded? Fumbling in the dark, Harry found the after-nightmare potion, then cast Lumos. He drank the potion, flipped through Malfoy’s parchment to read about it, just to see Malfoy’s neat and careful hand.
“Look!  Auror Potter, look!”  Malfoy was excitedly looking over his shoulder at Harry, his wand held aloft.  A feather was floating in the air about a foot from it.  “I did it!  I did
Draco surged up, tear-stained eyes face-to-face with Harry’s, and then Draco kissed him.  It was a very messy kiss.  Draco’s face was wet, his mouth too full of mucous.  Harry held onto him and kissed him back, until Draco pulled away.  “I’m disgusting.  Sorry.  I shouldn’t have—”
“Right.” Seeming to snap out of it, Malfoy looked about, and yet did not seem inclined at all to move. His expression seemed almost lost. He obviously had not been listening, and Gibson, Adebayo, Hasan and Zane had already found partners. That left Yi and Ewing, who found each other.
“Potions?”  Mrs. Mulpepper looked up at him, sniffling.  “ID?”  Her eyes widened.  “Oh, but Auror Potter, sir!
“No one cares if I’m an Auror.” Malfoy’s voice was rather loud, but then his features twisted again, and he spoke more normally. “I know who my father is,” he said tightly. “I could have anything money could buy; I could be anything he wants me to be. The difference is,
Malfoy’s eyes locked with Harry’s. Harry was sure Malfoy was going to argue, what with all his pretension toward modesty not five minutes earlier, but instead Malfoy reached for his collar, eyes still fixed on Harry’s. Slowly, he began to unlace it.
“Okay,” said Harry, because he was fairly certain that despite Doctor Yin’s eccentricities, the experiment would probably not involve alpacas or other live animals. Perhaps it would involve taxidermy ones.
Whirling around, Harry pointed his wand at the taxi.  He only remembered one spell that seemed at all helpful.  “
Malfoy’s eyes flicked to the ground, the stain of pink spreading down his neck. It didn’t do him any favours in the mauve and pink he wore. The splotchiness of his skin didn’t help, but Harry couldn’t help himself; he watched the blush spread. The vee of Malfoy’s rather frilly pink blouse was deep, and Harry could see the blush spread down over his collarbones, and under, contrasting prettily with the delicate chain that clasped his ridiculous mauve cape. Malfoy was wearing women’s clothes, Harry was pretty sure. “He didn’t mean what he said,” said Malfoy.
The letter went on like this, and on, and on, each of the remedies listed in alphabetical order. Harry skipped through the pages to the end, wondering if Malfoy had written anything other than an instruction manual. The list ended on the fifth page, with only one paragraph above Malfoy’s large, swirly “D.M.”
For a moment, Harry watched how the firelight from the hearths played in Malfoy’s hair.  “I know you dislike me intensely.”  He paused, half hoping Malfoy would dispute that as well, but he didn’t.  “But you’re the only one I can trust right now.”
Harry came over to the bench where Draco was working, noting the floating spoon measuring out ooze and the sieve that appeared to be straining wiggling hairballs.
“They don’t,” Harry said, trying to push his magic back.  Now was not the time to have the conversation about how none of the ideas that Dumbledore had were nasty.
“No,” Harry said, forgetting the Veritaserum.  “I mean, yes.”  He scrubbed his face.  If Veritaserum had made him say no, then there was something wrong with Ron working there, even if he hadn’t realized it.  Fuck.  Harry couldn’t talk to Hermione about it.  He couldn’t talk to anyone.  “He’s just—he doesn’t know anything.  About how that place works,” Harry said, and then he found himself talking, about how the Auror Department worked.
“Thanks for coming,” Harry said. Having said what he wanted to say, Harry moved away, but the reporters—as usual—pressed in.
Draco sat across from him, barely making any noise.  When Harry glanced over, though, Draco had a scone for himself and some berries.  At least Draco was eating, even if he wasn’t sleeping.  Because he was trying to cure Harry.  Embarrassed and upset all over again, Harry took a swig of the orange juice, then tucked in to the bacon.
“Good.”  Draco turned back to the fire again.  Harry thought he wasn’t going to go on, but suddenly Draco added, “It doesn’t do to be too clever.  You don’t know—you don’t have parents to tell you.  But it’s important to be intelligent, but not—not bookish.  People think you’re boring.  Or a prig.  Severus . . .”  He darted a look at Harry.  “That was what Mum meant about Severus.  She said he was too clever by half, and people were always—they always made fun of him, because he’d be off in corners by himself, reading.”
Malfoy’s smile widened, so bright and happy it transformed his whole face. He was pink with exertion. “It’s your trick,” he said, easing off of him.
“You shouldn’t have to save the—” Harry had stood up, turned around to face Teddy—whose face had changed to look exactly like Harry had, when he was seventeen. “World,” Harry said, his heart breaking.
“I think that’s why I—” Harry had to resist going to him, touching him. Malfoy looked like he was in actual pain, and Harry shifted his weight, shuffling. “I think that’s why I fell in love with you,” Harry said. “I didn’t mean to do it. I didn’t notice it was happening. You were just so—so brave, and so stubborn, and . . .”
, why—why would you—why would you choose to be—why . . .”  Draco’s face contorted.  “I thought you were like me!”
“Confirmed?”  The worry was beginning to sound like alarm.  “But—”  Cutting himself off, Malfoy swallowed hard.  “I don’t have a—”  Malfoy stopped again, his eyes widening.  He looked Harry up and down.  “I—we’re not roommates, are we?”
“He’s fine,” Harry said, still trying to make his voice sound deep.  “I really need a number to call a taxi, though.”
“Mmph.” Harry twisted on the bed, and it was so hot; he was so hot for it. “Get me—get me—harder. Get it harder.”
“Don’t be a nit.  Swamp-things aren’t related at all.  Here.”  Draco handed the book over the side of the bed, so Harry had to grab it or leave Draco’s small hand holding an enormous tome.  “You can use my wand, too,” Draco said, handing that over the side once Harry had taken the book.  The wand was still emitting light, flashing in Harry’s eyes.
“He did so under my supervision,” Harry said through gritted teeth. “I teach Advanced Defense Against Dark Arts as well as Sorcery. Destruction of a tree that had only been kept alive through human sacrifice deserves top marks, not expulsion.”
Six days after leaving Tailored Tinctures for the last time, Harry was getting worried.  Maybe Draco just didn’t want to see him, but maybe something had happened.  Maybe something had gone wrong with the cure.  Maybe Draco was lying there, unconscious, waiting for the final year and he was just—never going to wake up, and Harry would get another horrible letter about Draco hating himself and sacrificing himself for Harry.  Again.
“But mine does.” Malfoy had moved to the laces at his wrists, now. “My parents’ Patronuses match, you see. It represents their love. Their devotion to one another. Devotion resulted in me. Magic is very strong in my family, you know. I think the Dark Lord must have done something to you.”
“You are most definitely thirty-one,” Draco said, turning to him.  “What I’m saying is that I know nothing about the way children’s minds work, and yet despite like my lack of experience, you are in my sole custody.  Knowing what I know now, I’ve realized—that’s quite a big responsibility.  If you were to be harmed, I would find it impossible to live with myself, and believe me.  Living with myself is already hard enough as it is.”  The scroll-thing snapped up behind him, the small
meant that he didn’t mean the other things he’d said then, but Harry had no way to tell without asking.
The train in the memory was coming to a halt, and Goyle was throwing open the door, pushing his way into a crowd of second years. Crabbe and Zabini followed. “You go on,” Malfoy told Parkinson, who was holding out her hand for him. “I just want to check on something.”
At a bit longer than chin-length, Harry’s hair was only just long enough to pull back.  When he did, tying as much as he could back so it wouldn’t sit on his neck and overheat him, the bits in front usually escaped, hanging around his face.  He’d been meaning to cut it, as the annoyance of having it in his face outweighed the annoyance of having to get haircuts—and make nice with the haircutting people, who all wanted to hear what it was like to be Harry Potter.  Oh well.  Pointing his wand at his head, Harry cut the whole back part off, then tried to take it over to Malfoy.
Mister Malfoy looked a little sad about that answer.  “Harry.”  His voice was so slow and measured that Harry immediately tensed up.  “When you’re with your aunt and uncle, do you get enough to eat?”
As the trainees continued to practice the holds, Malfoy and Teddy continued to perform a cut above the rest, and Harry thought about what he would do for any other trainee who was doing particularly good work. He’d been walking between all the pairs of sparring partners, helping them with their techniques and offering pointers. When he finally came to Malfoy and Teddy, he stopped.
“I won’t do anything,” Draco said, detecting his advantage.  “I’ll be a bystander.  Bystanders are allowed.  I just want to see.  I promise.”
Harry had been folding the parchment and tucking it into his robe, but now he couldn’t help himself.  He smiled.  “Gawain Robards.”
After three minutes of stunned confusion, the obvious occurred to Harry: that Malfoy was getting therapy, that Malfoy was Leblanc’s patient, and that Harry was never, ever going to use Doctor Leblanc as his therapist ever, not if she was seeing Malfoy. Something about it was just too strange.
When they got back to the Auror Office, Savage went over to chat with Proudfoot instead of going over the case files as Harry had expected.  “New consultant in town,” Savage told Proudfoot, grabbing the phial of Dream Dram from Harry.
They had not encountered anyone when they had entered the library, which was a relief. Harry didn’t particularly want to be seen walking about in the early morning with Malfoy. Perhaps this was because Malfoy had said he was going to show him something confidential, but perhaps . . .
“And where were you?” Savage demanded of Penelope. “While I was in the Order of the Phoenix, where were you?”
So, Harry sat there as Malfoy cried, wishing he could remember what Ron did when Hermione cried.  He couldn’t remember.  He couldn’t remember.  When Hugo cried, Hermione hugged him, but that wasn’t the same.
Harry had to angle his broom handle downward, going toward the ground so he didn’t get crashed into.  Draco kept doing it though, spiralling tighter and tighter, until suddenly he stood up on his broom and jumped off.
Harry’s breath caught. His eyes closed; Malfoy was, in that moment, too beautiful to see. “Please,” he whispered.
Huffing a breath, Draco rolled his eyes.  “I meant, I have to have told you about it sometime in the future.”  Harry watched as Draco arranged himself to dip his face in the Pensieve, and Draco glanced back up.  Catching Harry’s expression, Draco lifted his face back up.  “Don’t I?”
But his hands weren’t on them any more; his upper body wasn’t on him, and Draco was rubbing Harry’s come on his own body, and the kisses were almost like—a distraction, as if Harry wouldn’t see that Draco was doing it. Pushing Draco off of him, Harry got Draco down on the mattress again, Draco blinking at him in startlement. “I’m going to lick it off you,” Harry said, then proceeded to do it.
After a moment, another server came by with a gleaming tray, and Malfoy set the glass upon it. Harry was just beginning to get bored again, and to notice that the washed out colours of the memory did Malfoy no disservice—he almost looked elegant in his dark robes, laced tightly up to the neck, and pale features—when one of the glass doors began to open. The figure entering the ballroom was Parkinson Senior, Harry was fairly certain, though he’d only ever seen him at the trials. Malfoy was opening the adjacent door, though, exiting to the veranda as Parkinson entered the ballroom.
Harry took a step away.  “You can do it, Malfoy,” he said.  “You always can.  You’re so good at this.”
“Yes,” Harry said, feeling a familiar sting.  “I think—I think people made fun of Snape.  And it wasn’t right.”
“You keep telling me your age.”  The smirk came back, a hint of a smile by one cheek.  Fuck.  Draco was so fucking gorgeous.  “I was going to suggest that we go down to the lab and get to work on those memories.”
“That’s what Kavika said. Not about Nifflers.” Somehow, the way that Doctor Yin got a bit off topic made Harry feel even more comfortable, as though they were really having a conversation. “I used to have dreams about forgetting Teddy all the time.”
Tailored Tinctures opened on the ground level, where Potage’s Cauldron Shop used to be.  Malfoy put his bedroom down there too, which made the sitting room upstairs twice as big, though Malfoy only seemed to fill it with more books.  Having the bedroom downstairs made sense, Harry supposed, as Malfoy practically lived in the lab that took up the main floor of the shop, but Harry found it inconvenient that the loo was upstairs.
Harry wasn’t exactly sure what confirmed bachelor meant, but he was pretty sure it meant single.  “Good.”  He played a card.
Sometimes when Harry thought about the kitchen table, serving Vernon and Petunia pot roast, he imagined the car, the flash of lights, the abrupt jolt, a swift black and then a silence. Sometimes when he thought of Voldemort now, Harry could feel the Aveda Kedavra, the flash of green. The scent of wet pines in the Forbidden Forest. Narcissa Malfoy’s white face among the trees. He could feel it now, the jolt, what it felt like to die.
Andromeda’s eyebrows rose in surprise at his sudden appearance.  “Marshmallows are quite difficult to transfigure.”
Harry remembered that night, standing outside the Higgledy Piggledy with Malfoy. He remembered the way Malfoy had looked when Fudge had won—just as devastated as Harry had felt. Harry had never thought, not even in a million years, that he could operate on the same political spectrum as Malfoy, much less that he would find a kindred spirit in him.
“I want,” Harry began, then started again. “I want it to be okay. That it’s comfortable. That I don’t need—more, that he doesn’t need more, that it’s not . . .” Harry ground his teeth. “It’s not painful. I’ve been in other relationships—they were painful. I fell in love before I knew what I was doing, before we really knew each other, or we grew up and . . . I just want it to be okay. That we’re like this.”
Harry wondered why he hadn’t been able see when they were both in fifth year how vulnerable Draco had been, but Harry already knew the reason.  Harry had been vulnerable himself, more vulnerable than Draco ever had been, but in a completely different way.  When you were sixteen it was hard to know people other than yourself.  It was hard at thirty-one as well, but some things were easier.  Some things were so much easier.  “I like you,” Harry said.
Harry swallowed.  “Well—I.”  He swallowed again.  “I haven’t kept track of what you do in your own time.  You’re . . . discreet.”
“I’ve helped crack the case of the century, Abel Alby will get what’s coming to him, I’ve broken up with my boyfriend, I’ve got a million potions to brew and only this shop to do it in, and your Patronus keeps following me about mournfully like I’m a carcass she’d really like to gnaw on but doesn’t get to.  How do you think I’m doing?”
Someone pushed against Harry. “Does it hurt when you disappear?” asked a short girl with a round little nose.
“Your aunt and uncle are filthy rotten liars,” Draco said vehemently, then turned back to the bookcase.
“Malfoy,” Harry said, then realized he didn’t know what to say. The nausea was back. “Don’t bring me coffee,” he heard himself say.
“Oh,” Harry said, and the energy that had been driving him before made itself known by its sudden and complete absence.  Harry felt like everything stopped, just stopped, his heart momentarily seizing in his chest.  “Malfoy,” Harry breathed.
“Do you really think she would take away her love?” Harry came closer, close enough now to put his hand on Draco’s shoulder.  Harry knew better than to do it.  “Draco, she loves you so much.”
“It says here it’s been kept a secret from us for hundreds of years,” said a man, waving a pamphlet.
In front of Draco was the table, around which sat a dozen or so witches and wizards. Harry recognized all of them, though he didn’t necessarily remember all their names. Some were old classmates from Hogwarts, others relatives of classmates or people he had met in the Ministry, varying in age from early twenties to late seventies.
, went Harry’s brain, and something shifted inside of it, not quite clicking into place. “I just meant . . . he’s a different person, now. It shouldn’t matter anymore. I should . . . maybe I would be attracted to him. If he hadn’t—if he wasn’t. Who he is.”
,” Mister Malfoy said, which Harry guessed made it wet, and then the wet cloth was wiping his neck, his stupidly sweaty hair.
Alby’s testimony helped bring down Clint Matinsky, a Florida man who had been on MACUSA’s watch-list for a decade.  Before then, MACUSA had never been able to prove anything.  Matinsky had been shipping Alby the illegal ingredients, corresponding with Alby via two enchanted typewriters that printed messages long distance.  This meant the Auror Office was able to confiscate years of records detailing who was involved in the illegal supply chain.
Harry laughed, but quickly coughed—Malfoy wasn’t laughing. He was looking away, biting his lip, scarlet beginning to curl into his cheeks. Harry hadn’t meant to embarrass him—or he had, a little, but not like this. “Malfoy—”
“If it makes you uncomfortable, you’re free to tell him that,” Kavika said. “You don’t have to accept someone’s actions just because their intentions are good, Harry. Not everyone deserves the benefit of your doubt.”
Aurors impounded the warehouse on Colville, collecting all the potions and ingredients.  While the Life Water was immediately handed over to the Department of Mysteries, many of the confiscated items remaining needed to be identified before they could be properly handled.  Had Robards still been in charge, even he would have ceded to the argument that a potions consultant would be required to deal with everything.  Thus, Draco’s position within the Ministry became official, and he was offered a stipend for the work as well as a title.
Draco sucked in a breath. “Of course, Harry. Of course, I’ll fuck you. Poor darling. You just need cock, don’t you?”
Harry knew better than to ask for another slice, so he just nodded.  Even though he wouldn’t mind more tart, he didn’t want to repeat an episode of vomiting, especially as there wasn’t a toilet nearby to sick up in.
After breakfast Draco wouldn’t let Harry even clean his plate, casting a Scourgify on it and putting it away.  If the washing up was really that simple Harry didn’t understand what had taken so long earlier, but he figured it was best not to argue.  After that, Draco gave him towels and then left Harry in the bathroom, saying he’d put the new clothes in there with a spell.
But Malfoy didn’t come back, and after a moment, Harry let himself breathe again. Well. Well, that hadn’t been as awful as he had felt so sure it would be. That had been almost—easy. Maybe Malfoy hadn’t even followed him into the men’s; maybe he’d just had to use the toilet. Maybe no one had noticed Harry escaping—except Hermione, and probably Ron, and they had seen him like this before anyway. They knew what to do. They gave him his time alone. Sometimes they stayed close and brought him water, but they listened to what he said he needed and didn’t do what they thought he needed instead. They didn’t touch him. They didn’t try to tell him he would be okay.
“I only wish I’d thought of a way to do the same. I was making the mistake of keeping my head down until I was an Auror.”
Harry perked up.  They did not have fires very often at the house on Privet Drive.  Aunt Petunia said they were a waste—of what, Harry wasn’t certain.  Whenever they did have fires, Uncle Vernon fell asleep in front of them while Harry cleaned, and then there was never anywhere to sit by it.
“When that happens,” Malfoy said, “know that there’s someone else who knows it all, feels it all, went through it all, and that someone loves you. He loves every particle of you, every damned infuriating piece of you, and he accepts you. Every fucked up inch of you. You could do anything, Potter, and there will still be someone who knows you and wants you for exactly what you are.”
“Baggot has this line,” Harry said, “about them being kids. ‘Children will be children.’ It’s what the Board says about Travers too. Pillwickle said . . .” Harry shook his head. It was still disgusting. “He actually said to me,” Harry quoted carefully, “‘you wouldn’t want to ruin a child’s life, just because he’d made a mistake.’”
Draco sagged a bit under Harry’s hands, but seemed to be feeling the pain less.  “Who else?” he demanded.
“I never promised anything,” Malfoy said, tossing his head.  The dim light of the kitchen caught in his hair as he took the Veritaserum from Harry.  “I hope you don’t go into every interrogation blindly hoping you don’t get asked questions when you’re on Veritaserum.”
Ron nodded in Rune and Malfoy’s direction. Malfoy, having left Rune behind, was coming towards them.
Harry looked up. Malfoy was there on broomstick, and though some of the people were trying to reach him, straining and jumping, he was too far above them all for anyone to reach.
Malfoy took a noisy breath, then another one, breathing hard. “But you . . . You can’t. You said you
“He’s not going to be an Auror. He’s started . . .” Pulling the crystals apart, Harry let them snap together. “It’s an organization. Kind of. To work on non-mag and magical relations.”
Feeling himself blush, Harry shifted in his chair.  He bet all the girls found Draco very handsome too.
There was a pause.  “On the contrary.”  Draco’s voice was low and rumbly with Harry’s ear against his chest.  “I always thought it very nice.”
“Old-me told Draco he was the only one I could trust,” Harry piped up, because even if old-him was a prat, at least he’d said that one nice thing.
“More,” Harry croaked, when Malfoy released him. Harry discovered he was clinging to him, his fists full of the back of Malfoy’s shirt. It was probably Astoria’s shirt, and Harry gripped it harder. “Please, I love you. More.”
Harry stared at the alpaca, realizing this would probably really work for Luna. Luna was better at using her imagination; it would probably work for Penelope, too. Penelope always wanted someone to talk to; it wouldn’t matter if it was an alpaca. And alpaca would probably work better for her than a person on her own imagination; she would have an easier time with someone to listen who couldn’t respond with human feelings. Even George might like a therapist alpaca. He never took anything seriously; perhaps having an alpaca to talk to would be ridiculous enough that he could remove himself from the truth of what he was saying for long enough to believe it was a joke.
For some reason, Mister Malfoy didn’t believe he could live in a cupboard under the stairs.  Perhaps he thought Harry would be too noisy.  “I could—I could stay out on the roof,” Harry suggested next.
him, and that wasn’t weird.  It was perfectly normal to want to sit by someone you liked. People did it in school all the time.
“He thinks Father pretends to be more important than he is,” Draco explained.  “You don’t think that, do you?  Father’s the best man there is.
“Expelliarmus,” Harry said, then aimed down with his broom. “Stupefy,” he added, pointing his wand at the woman he had disarmed as he hopped off his broom.
“Right,” Harry said, despite the fact that his heart swelled at those words.  He stroked Draco’s back.  “Right.  But I didn’t know.”
Kavika went over to the table, arranging the coffee things. “Did you?” she asked, as she pointed her wand to boil the water in the teapot. “Feel gratitude?”
The humour fell out of Malfoy’s face, but his voice remained light-hearted. “You’re asking because of who my father is.”
“Do you know, so do I?” she said. “There are factions who think that Draco Malfoy joining the Auror Department would make the Auror Force more sympathetic toward neo-purists who dabble in dark arts. If that’s the case, at least Draco won’t be much help to them.”
“Anyway,” Harry went on.  “You couldn’t make me watch.  My magic is stronger than yours; there’s no way you could make me stay.”
Draco was pulling things off the chimney piece of one of the hearths and throwing them on the floor.
Harry looked down at the sofa, the table beside it.  The table had a book on it, probably one Draco had been reading, not repairing.  The book was leather-bound with vines on the cover and fairy tales inside.
Draco’s face was twisted into an ugly expression Harry remembered well from school.  He just hadn’t remembered it hurting like this.  “All right,” Harry said, turning and walking from the room.
Casting a quick healing spell on the scab, Harry got it closed up, then opened one of the jars he’d grabbed.  “This is a salve; let me put it on you; let me—”
Malfoy’s face fell a bit, but then his mouth settled into a line.  “Right.”  He began walking down the long dark hall.
Ron glanced away, into the crowd, but he didn’t seem to be looking at anything in particular. “I never thought I was going to be the person I am now,” he said finally, turning back to Harry. “I wanted to be—you know—tough. Impressive. Someone who . . .” Shrugging, he looked down at his hands. “I don’t even know what. It’s different than I expected,” he said, lifting blue eyes back to Harry’s. “Life is different.
Glancing at him as they walked through the orchard, Harry saw that Teddy looked at ease, but he almost always looked at ease. “Do you think you’ll try to climb the Timothy Tree?”
, and no one had ever done this to him before—maybe Molly.  Maybe Hermione, once, or Madam Pomfrey.  Harry wanted to crawl out of his skin.  He wanted to curl into Malfoy’s touch.
Harry wasn’t sure he could take it—but Draco’s wand was pointed at his own cock, casting that slow stroking spell on himself.
“Some help you are,” Harry muttered to himself, but just then he saw a door, and above the door it said thirty-three.
Having assessed the office, apparently, Malfoy slipped his hands in his pockets and turned to face Harry once more. “This has nothing to do with you.”
Kavika chuckled. “One must obey one’s conscience. Especially when it comes to coffees.” Turning, she spelled Harry’s cup over to him, then picked up one for himself.
After several long minutes of Malfoy standing there, Harry just inside the door, Malfoy spoke.  “I just . . .” Trailing off, Malfoy turned around. His pink skin had gone pale, almost a sickly grey colour, though quite red about the eyes. Harry could see how tired he was, haggard lines about his face.
“You’ve been fucked twice,” said Draco, who was still fully clothed, except for his erect prick emerging from nearly pristine trousers. “Another time by a toy. And then I fucked your mouth; you have come drying on your face. You’re moaning over that toy just like a whore—are you sure you need another fucking?”
“So that’s how you know so much about confiscating illegal dragons.”  Enough time had passed since Norberta that Harry could feel amused.
“It’s not what I meant to do.” Tugging Harry’s hand away, Draco put a bit of distance between them, then rolled over, facing Harry finally, putting his hand flat over the scar at the center of Harry’s chest. “I was going to make you feel good,” Draco went on. “I wanted to make you feel so good.”
been Imperiused!  It was him!”  Suddenly straightening up, Alby thrust out his hand, pointing at Draco.  “He must have put it in my cabinet when he was working here!  He’s been controlling me the whole time!  He’s nothing but a snivelling conniving—”
“That’s what everyone keeps saying,” Harry said. “He’s not an Auror either. And is it true that Aurors aren’t children? I’m training them; I’m training Teddy, and what if . . . ? Malfoy only wanted to be an Auror in the first place so he could—” Harry cut himself off.
“No?”  Harry was unsure where this obsession Malfoy had with being drunk came from.  “I was just going to say, since your birthday is at the beginning of June and mine is at the end of July, that means we get almost two whole months of in-between birthdays.  In fact, it’s our in-between birthday right now, which means—”
“Right,” Ron said, clapping him on the back, “and you’ll be here, when he’s at Academy, and I’ll be there, when he’s on the force. It’s not all bad, Harry.”
January passed into February, February into March. Harry watched Malfoy, Malfoy at Order meetings in Rombe Pickle, serious and intent and thoughtful; Malfoy under the Timothy Tree, laughing with other instructors or trainees. The strangest thing about watching Draco Malfoy now was that Harry could still see the ways in which Malfoy wasn’t beautiful: the splotchiness of his skin, his thin lips, the lack of cheekbones. When Harry looked at him now, though, he saw the pinkness of those lips, the length of Malfoy’s lashes, the strength in his hands. He saw the firm, confident set of Malfoy’s shoulders and he thought about how they would feel under his hands, how that mouth would feel on his.
be.”  Draco’s voice was dull, neither interested nor mocking, and Harry glanced up again to make sure he was okay.
“Yes.  Your parents fought him bravely.”  Andromeda went on sipping tea.  “But that was a long time ago.  Voldemort returned when you were at school.”
“If anyone had told me I shouldn’t be an Auror . . .” Looking down, Harry discovered he was rubbing the scar on his hand, then made himself stop. “It’s not that I think he can’t handle it—the actual job, I mean. But it . . . wears you down. Not just the late nights; it’s finding out the—the sheer
Luna looked back up at the sky. “I could write them in a poem,” she said, “if you want it. So you remember.”
“Exactly.  Besides,” Draco added, another trace of a smile ghosting his cheeks, “I have no experience with breaking into the Ministry.  It will be great moral support to go with someone who’s done it before.”
“Now give it a good time,” Draco said, and held the dildo against Harry’s lips. “Treat it like you would a nice, hot prick you would really like to fuck you.”
“There.”  Turning back to him, Draco sneered.  “So, I am one.  I’ve told you that, have I?  And you believe it; you think I’m a boy-lover too.”
“My good friend Andromeda is helping with traffic control down below,” Harry told the woman who needed to get to the city. He put his hand on Nyala’s arm. “Are you okay?”
Christ.  Malfoy was so impossible sometimes.  “Here,” Harry said, taking out the phial of bubbling goo in his pocket.  “If you don’t want to make conversation.”
Malfoy just stared at him again. When he finally spoke again, his voice was unexpectedly light. “I’m not a Death Eater. I regret what I did. What my family did. I’m sorry for it. I’m ever so
“I’ve narrowed down a list of ingredients based on those diagnostics I ran, but I’ve quite a bit of work left,” Draco said.
Kavika could look so generous in her sympathy, her large eyes carrying her heart as well as Harry’s. “And you tell me that life is better now, and you shouldn’t be anxious,” she said. “You, who witnessed blood sacrifices and won for us a war.”
Draco scowled at him.  “I said that it was perfect.  You’re always perfect.  Everything about you is—fuck.”  Leaping off of the sofa, Draco began to pace.  “How does this even work?  We’re not even
“I think it would be awful,” Draco went on.  “Family is more important than anything.  It’s all right, though.”  He settled in on the other side of the couch, leaning against the arm and sprawling his legs out, the picture of a miniature little adult at ease, his hands folded over his chest.  “Since we’re best friends, I imagine we Malfoys are like a surr- . . . surrg- . . . adopted family.  You could come to our house on hols.  I bet you’ve done that loads of times.  Isn’t my mum the most beautiful woman alive, Harry?  You must love her very much.  She makes people feel comfortable.  She always wants everyone to be comfortable, even people who are never comfortable, like Severus.  Can you tell me about a Christmas we’ve had?”
“I’ll bet the Board are the sort who just want to go back to the way things were before the war,” Penelope went on. “’Things used to be so good before we were so divided’; ‘remember when we all used to work together?’ and that rot. I wouldn’t be surprised if the lot of them were Concealers.”
Harry had just found the address for the warehouse when Andromeda knocked on Teddy’s door.  “I have made hot chocolate,” said Andromeda.  “Draco seemed to think it was important you have some today.”
“Someone made a sacrifice to the Timothy Tree and bound the life of it in the tree. That’s why it’s been there for so long. And the life inside of it’s why it’s so picky about who climbs.”
Draco put the lamp down awkwardly and stammered a dumbfounded "Really?" – that had Potter snickering. Draco glowered in his direction.
“Get Potter.” he wheezed at the baffled rookie on call, who had been quite clearly just taking a nap on a couch in the corner. When the trainee continued to blink at him owlishly, Draco banged his fist on the counter and shouted:
“Where is that blasted dog?” Draco interrupted, closing and shrinking his trunk. He took a few steps towards the hallway, squinting in the direction of the backyard. “Usually, I can’t take one step without tripping over him, but
“I took the chambers across your room,” he said, and Harry paused for a second at the use of the plural term before deciding maybe it was best he didn’t know.
A blonde head suddenly popped from behind a wood plank, giving Pansy another start. Draco looked at her with a manic glint in his eyes.
Harry spluttered powerlessly, incapable to choose which part of Draco’s statement he wanted to protest first. Draco’s eyes merrily twinkling away with malice also weren’t helping Harry regain his cool.
So, before anyone complains about the dogs and chocolate bit, let me tell you that dog-Potter is based on a real life delinquent canine. Who did in fact eat a whole chocolate cake in the dead of night. We only found out about his crimes in the morning. He didn't even get sick.
"Circe's saggy tits!" Draco wheezed to himself, clambering out of the bed in a mad dash that somehow caused him to fall hard on his behind. "Fuck!"
"Quite. It came to my attention that you require a new wand, Mr. Malfoy. Since your old one has been malfunctioning," McGonagall interrupted briskly, and another parcel was shoved into Draco's hands. "This should do nicely for now."
“He’s back,” Draco said, getting straight to the point. Harry tilted his head a bit, giving Draco a curious look that clearly evaluated, if not his mental soundness, at the very least his sober status.
Harry turned his head to find Draco sprawled on an armchair still on his pyjamas, looking sleep-deprived but otherwise unharmed.
“The wards are protecting the house, Master Harry. They was weak for a while, but then Master Draco saved us.” Kreacher looked at Draco with obvious adoration. “Master Draco is being wise as he is handsome, Master Harry, like a true Black.”
“Well. All right then. Potter, I found a way to repay you.” He declared, trying to look poised. Harry narrowed his eyes at him.
.” He staggered forward to where they last saw… whatever it was that they saw. Smooth cobbled stone and water were all that remained.
Anyway. I love you, even if you’re an infuriating little git in the mornings. As for my wedding present to you… I sure hope you find the idea of revenge appealing. Because I’ve got a few pictures of last night after you got spectacularly smashed at your own wedding and I suppose you’ll be wanting them back, especially after you remember exactly what you got up to. (Stripping ring a bell to you? Pole dancing?)
"Do shut your mouth, won't you Potter? You'll get flies in it." He drawled, trying to give the bane of his existence the most disdainful look he could produce.
“And then this morning!” He could see that his therapist was smiling gently, always a clear sign he though Draco was being silly. “This morning I woke up first, and
Harry discovered that if he came into Draco’s room early in the morning and bribed him with a cup of tea full of milk and sugar, he would get up and agree to join Harry for breakfast. He would follow sleepily in his pyjamas, body warm and pliant as Harry manoeuvred him into the dining room.
“Shut up, Potter!” In a bout of madness that he would never be able to fully explain afterwards, Draco stepped in front of Harry and raised his wand one last time. “
Evening found Draco sunken to the chin in his bathtub, pondering the merits of never getting up again. He was utterly exhausted. It seemed to him that every single muscle of his body was aching. He wouldn’t be surprised if someone informed him that his magical core had been completely depleted. Hermione Granger had proved to be one ruthless supervisor. At one point, Draco had suggested just leaving the house as it was, honestly, he wouldn’t mind. A bit of extra air in a couple of rooms, wasn’t that healthy? A while later, Potter himself had lost his temper when a bean fell on his head and proposed very loudly they really did destroy the whole place, probation be damned. Draco could live somewhere else in hiding, apparently.
"My probation. Yes, Saint Potty, I know," Draco interrupted, feeling mildly consoled when he saw a muscle ticking angrily in Potter's jaw. He got to his feet and started dusting his clothes.
“I saw you!” Harry persisted, grabbing Draco’s arm, and shaking him. “Walking after me like a bloody lunatic wearing that stupid cape and…”
, this chilly air all around you. You were shivering, and getting paler and paler. I couldn’t get you to wake up. I told Kreacher to go reinforce the wards.”
They ended up ransacking Grimmauld’s library for any books that looked promising to the case and reading them sprawled on the living room's armchairs, a roaring fire making the whole space pleasantly toasty. After his second piece of chocolate cake, Draco’s mood improved drastically, and Harry made a note to himself to always have sugar on hand.
us in the next turn!” Draco nodded, and they ran faster, desperate to get to the other end of the narrow passage. Harry reached out his hand and Draco took it, letting himself be side-alonged.
“Potter!” Draco finally roared in indignation, snapping Harry out of his daze. Very aware he was rapidly blushing, Harry staggered back.
If you don’t want proof of your regrettable dance moves to be affixed on that delightful board of Most Wanted at the DMLE entrance hall, I would advise you to go to that same club this week, and captivate me with an equally ridiculous performance. Might I suggest the Macarena?
“Well, we all knew your investigative skills would be sloppy at best, Potter.” Draco drawled, and Harry broke out of his reverie.
"Malfoy," Potter interrupted him. Draco shifted on his feet, something in the other's tone abruptly making him feel uncertain. "What do you mean, you have to count your money to eat?"
was not one of them. He agreed he made poor choices in his youth and, to his chagrin, was mostly inclined to worry just about his own problems, the rest of the world be damned. He wasn’t proud of that, but he accepted the assessment. However, all of his selfish actions and judgement lacking conducts were always made with a sound mind. So why the fuck was he seeing things?
“Oh, Harry!” Draco peered at him from his place and actually grinned. “Did you know this chandelier is cursed to spit candles on people passing by?”
“Fine,” Harry said tiredly, starting to put food on his plate. He was about to tuck in when he noticed Draco watching. The ‘eating like a savage’ remark from earlier made his ears burn, and Harry glowered but forced himself to eat very slowly. Draco snorted, amused, but refrained from commenting. They finished the meal in almost companionable silence.
“Why do you guys reckon he is after Malfoy now?” In response to Ron’s question, Draco waved his arms around rather crazily in Harry’s direction, making a sound of distress that clearly stated Draco held his old school nemesis responsible for all his misfortunes.
“It’s a short list.” Harry exhaled, frustrated, playing with a loose thread on the tablecloth. “Most of the Death Eaters had been caught and imprisoned by then. I wasn’t working on any big cases that I can think of. Nobody I arrested had been released. I don’t know.”
“Hm.” Draco tilted his head, sending dog-Potter a malevolent look. “I wish. Last year this bloody mongrel ate my whole birthday cake. Triple chocolate, and ordered from Paris. He didn’t even get sick.”
“This is why we went to war against you people, you know,” Pansy had declared darkly, glaring at the hammer Harry had just given her.
"Give me that, you tosser," he tore his wand from Draco's hand and cast a general drying charm around himself. "I should hex you."
“Zabini!” Draco bellowed in outrage when he could finally breathe again. Blaise’s amused smile wasn’t helping him find his lost poise. “Have you no decorum?! One afternoon with Gryffindors and you turn into a heathen?!”
Ginny and Harry were yelling terrible things at each other, their relationship finally crumbling to the ground seven exhausting years after the war. On that evening in the middle of October, the weather was raging with rain and wind all over London, and in Grimmauld Place, the walls were shaking with magic and hurt.
"Muggles call them probation officers," Pansy interjected, and three pair of eyes stared at her in equal amounts of bafflement. She shrugged and calmly inspected her nails. "It's been the longest summer."
“What’s this?” he asked when no explanation seemed forthcoming. A little bird came out of the clock and made an obnoxiously loud chirp.
Draco, for his part, continued to work. He travelled a bit. Got banned from Spain after his dog peed in an Ambassador’s side table. It was an antique, and the man was very crossed indeed. Draco then figured out, after many lost galleons on boots, that the stupid animal would just as happily chew on potatoes - of all things -, if only Draco supplied him with a big enough stock.
“Like you can see at all with those hideous glasses.” Draco snapped, voice raised enough to be heard above the rainstorm, and pointed his wand at Harry’s face. “
Harry looked at his own hands, annoyed. Figures. Why was he always the one with the strange visions?
Harry had eventually walked out of the house in a furious haze, lest he blew the whole thing up by mistake. Their words were ringing in his ears, and his chest was a tight ball of pain and anger. He was wet and chilled to the bone in a matter of seconds, but actually rejoiced in the unrelenting downpour beating his skin. He strode blindly in the dark, not caring about anything anymore.
Kreacher was absolutely no help. One look at Draco and he started wailing quite piteously that ‘Master didn’t warn we are having visitors!’. Which in turn made the dog take great interest in the old elf. The animal was taller than Kreacher, even on all fours, and seemed immediately determined to stick his snout into Kreacher’s face. Harry figured it was a ‘further investigation purposes’ kind of thing, and that Kreacher should be glad the dog wasn’t sniffing his behind. The elf ran, screeching. The dog chased him, barking joyfully. Draco yelled at him to behave, being successful only in setting off Walburga’s portrait.
"I didn't forget anything Malfoy. Like I didn't forget that in the end you were just scared and wanted out. Your mother was just scared and she…. And you helped. Both of you. Ok?"
Draco paused for a second to glance at him. Astoria was clearly a sore topic, and Harry didn’t even know why.
Taking the executive decision of letting the situation play itself out, and not call in reinforcements, Harry continued walking along the narrow, claustrophobic streets. He was an Auror, damnit, and far too old to be afraid of the dark. A few minutes later the figure appeared again, this time a little bit to his left. Through the corner of his eye, Harry could just make out the dark cloak that seemed to absorb what little light the streetlamps provided. He tried to face the threat, turning once more and was again greeted by empty space.
“She’s fine, if a little annoyed with me,” Draco said, turning his back at Harry to go fuss over some dish or other. “She thinks I’m exaggerating and that she could go home.”
“Who just sacrificed so much to keep the whole of the wizarding world safe.” Draco scowled at that. His therapist raised an eyebrow, not in the least intimidated.
These events, as Draco had taken to calling them, started getting more frequent. During field expeditions, he would get the weirdest impression someone was following him. He saw shades everywhere. Discussing the situation with his parents didn’t help. They immediately assumed it was some unhappy war victim, still after revenge against pardoned Death Eaters. Discomfited, Draco finally scheduled an appointment at St. Mungos for the next week. He supposed he had Black blood after all, and Salazar knew his ancestors could be notoriously insane sometimes.
“Merlin,” Harry said in between puffs of breath. Draco agreed with the sentiment, but his mouth refused to form coherent words for the moment. Bloody hell. He had just gotten off with the boy that had consistently vexed him since he was
Harry called Ron and Hermione in, ignoring Draco rolling his eyes and muttering something under his breath that sounded remarkably like ‘no self-reliance’. But Harry was fairly sure that tinkering a bit with the Auror’s report forms back then justified asking help from people he knew would never betray his trust. Even if Hermione would be dismayed. Which she was.
“I’ll go wash up,” Harry said, feeling rather defeated. Draco was nowhere to be seen when Harry went down to have dinner.
“Great, so now I don’t have to worry about the safety of my goddaughter, just that I’ll leave her without parents,” Harry grumbled. Hermione rolled her eyes and seemed about to say something else when Draco strolled back into the room.
“I’ve been thinking about the case,” Harry said eventually. Draco just raised an eyebrow in question, delicately wiping his mouth before taking another sip of his drink. “Made a list of who could have held a grudge against me two years ago.”
That particular night witnessed one of the biggest arguments Harry had ever had in his life, which was really saying something if you consider who we’re talking about.
Harry woke slowly, aware someone was shaking him, but not being quite successful in opening his eyes. He groaned, feeling sore and weak as if he’d suffered some terrible accident. His whole body was shaking and covered in a cold sweat. He could feel his heart beating at a frantic, unnatural pace.
"Malfoy, old chap, you can't do that," Blaise chided, still relaxed in his broom, floating above his friend.
I love you, Draco. I always have, ever since you first sent me that horrible, smug letter. I wanted to punch you then, but then I decided that you would look better on your knees instead of at St Mungo's (which is probably not as romantic as I wanted this letter to be.)
Draco found himself sitting stiffly in an armchair at the library a couple of hours later. He was utterly horrified. Harry Potter was currently kneeling in front of the fireplace screaming himself hoarse at the Minister of Magic.
Thank you for the kudos and the reviews! I'm having a lot of fun writing this fic, and I'm glad you had fun reading it too! =D
“Focus!” Harry snapped when Draco took too long to open his door, being too busy finishing an insult. Draco shot him an annoyed glance but entered the house.
“But Harry,” said Hermione tentatively, interrupting them before the argument escalated. “If the wards aren’t holding-”
Harry let out a muffled sound, and laughter prevailed over common courtesy. He doubled over, leaning against the hallway wall when it looked like his legs wouldn’t support him for much longer. He tried to control his breathing, but then met Draco’s narrowed eyes and fuming expression, and that set him off again.
made them both jump. Draco looked to his left, only to be confronted with Ronald Weasley standing by his side, struggling to balance two enormous rickety baskets in his arms. Draco gawked in a most undignified manner. The previous somber mood was quickly forgotten.
"Mother always told me to have a glass of water after bad dreams," said Draco sweetly. He fought down the urge to maniacally hoot at the evil glower Potter was sending him. The effect was somewhat lost when the person looked like a half-drowned cat.
“How did you know to do that thing? For my nightmares.” Draco turned his head towards Harry, who was looking back at him, appearing at once shy and determined. Draco shifted to his side, muttering a cleaning charm at the mess pooling between them. He bit his lip, considering.
“And my sentence is your business? If you can stick your righteous nose in my affairs, THEN SO CAN I!”
“We apparated first.” Harry pointed out. He was giving the little girl a besotted smile that thoroughly disgusted Draco. “He followed us.”
“Well if you must know, Potter,” Harry snorted at his annoyed tone and Draco rolled his eyes. “It was last year. Things were bad at the Manor. You know.”
“Well. Yes, thanks, Kreacher.” Harry said quickly before the elf decided to break down in song. Kreacher bowed before disappearing. “No breaches then, see.”
“If the wards were really in place,” said Hermione, face acquiring that faraway look of when she was working a puzzle, “then this person wouldn’t have been able to get access to Harry in the first place.”
By lunch time they were all snapping angrily at each other. By teatime, Pansy had inevitably broken a nail and thrown the mother of all tantrums. Hermione finally relented and said they could continue the next day. Pansy immediately left in a huff, without so much as a good day flung their way, the savage. The Golden Trio had then buggered off to Merlin knew where and that left Draco soaking alone in hot water, trying to regain the feeling in his legs.
“All the more reason to fix this.” Hermione gave a frustrated sigh and closed the book she’d been studying. She nicked some chips from Ron’s plate. “We have nothing. He can’t live with you forever.”
“I remember you being awake and already behaving like a pillock during breakfast back at Hogwarts,” Harry commented, after watching Draco try and fail to dunk a biscuit in his teacup.
A shocked Draco was on the other side of the door, stark naked and frozen in the act of drying his hair with a towel. None of them moved for a few stunned seconds. Harry could feel his mouth opening and closing silently.
“You…” Harry pointed at Draco with a shaking finger, and then at the dog looking at him with his tongue lolling out. “You named your
“What then?” he asked, and searched Draco’s eyes for an explanation. Those bright grey eyes slowly perused his face, and Harry couldn’t help but feel a bit like one of his cursed objects, being irrevocably pulled apart under Draco’s scrutiny.
"Sure Potter. I'll hire some contractors." Potter’s hand was abruptly halting him in the middle of the hall. All amusement was gone from his eyes.
Draco at five o’clock in the afternoon, on the other hand, was an unpredictable source of mayhem. Harry had come home one day to a cauldron flooding Draco’s office with weird bubbles that turned into a slippery black paste when popped. The dog was madly trying to catch them but succeeded only in skidding from one side of the room to the other, crashing into the furniture, while Draco shouted at him to
Harry cried out. All at once warmth and feeling were coming back to his skin, stinging him. The colour was back. Harry gaped. He would have been up and shouting if he didn’t feel so close to passing out.
Harry sighed to himself and scratched distractedly behind Potter’s ears. Draco had adamantly refused to say anything more since he’d woken up and had left to change his clothes once
the barely concealed gazes of the others in their direction. There would be no end to the teasing from Zabini. He would taunt him forever.
"You think somebody made the roof fall on purpose?" he asked, running both his hands through his hair and making the whole thing reach a new level of unruly.
“Very kind of you, Potter. I give you my everlasting gratitude, of course.” Draco stated carelessly, sounding every bit the pureblood idiot Harry knew and disliked.
Ron glowered, but Draco just arched one eyebrow, disdain written on his face. Harry met Hermione’s eyes with amusement.
“You named your dog after me!” Harry exploded, this time red with fury. “Bloody hell Malfoy, what is
Draco still couldn’t quite believe he was back in this position. So to speak. Wasn’t it just an hour ago he had pledged very seriously to himself to be as cold and sneering as a Malfoy ought to when dealing with the Saviour? If Harry weren’t such a Gryffindor, he would have sworn that this was Slytherin subterfuge. Shameless Salazarian manipulation.
“The least you could do is help me with these things. You’re a Potter too, you know.” dog-Potter’s only answer was a consoling bump to Harry’s leg.
"Well? What are you waiting for? Trumpets announcing the way to the gates?" Draco asked, exasperated. Potter was still smiling a bit, green eyes extra bright in the morning light, and that made Draco irrationally angry all over again. He needed to have a word with his Healer. Clearly the man was an incompetent buffoon.
enticing than Kung Fu Fighting (which, by the way, is a fucking excellent song, Malfoy, don’t make me ask Heloise to bite you when he delivers this letter). Also, the Macarena? Please. That’s for beginners.
“He was hysterical, babbling something about the house being under attack, and that its master was dying.”
The creature showed up in his yard one afternoon, out of nowhere, looking mournful and quite pathetic with his knotted, filthy fur and big sad eyes. It sat very still, strategically positioned so that Draco would spot him out the window every time he went into his kitchen.
“What the fuck, Draco,” said Harry, getting annoyed himself. “This just proves we need to move faster.”
“Wonders will never cease.” drawled Draco. Harry crossed his arms and muttered some expletives under his breath.
“Don’t call me that,” Harry growled, but all he got as an answer was a disdainful look Draco sent from over his shoulder.
Harry rolled to his back but kept close. Draco wondered idly what had happened to Harry’s friends. To Draco’s own friends. For that matter, what the sodding hell had happened to his left sock? He frowned at his foot, distracted. Turned his head to Harry and blurted:
“Yes, Draco. He sent me a lovely letter apologising in the beginning of summer. And he has been helping me with the magical theory for reversing memory charms.”
“This ‘right’ of yours. I asked if I could give her your address, and you said I could. So what is it now?”
“Sit down, Draco,” the man sighed, shaking his head. They were meeting in a small office on some forsaken part of the Manor. Draco had spent a good 15 minutes putting up privacy charms on the doors. The thought of the Golden Trio listening in on his session actually made his stomach roll.
I just knew you were going to become a part of my life again, and I couldn’t wait. Even all of those excuses to meet you over and over to discuss the “blackmail” photos were just me trying to spend more time with you. I’m sure you knew that too, but it was always such fun to see your face when I tried new schemes to get them back. (Do you remember the one where Blaise got turned into a kitten and he kept licking his hands for weeks after? Pansy was so mad at us.)
!” The chandelier was in fact a popular drinking game for the Gryffindors, who would try to dash from one end of the room to another without getting hit. “Get down from there!”
“I’ll check if you have any new cases today and bring them back to you,” Harry said, at last, unable to bear another second of the stiff mood between them. Draco half turned towards him, staring at Harry as if he had no recollection of ever meeting him before.
"I'm going to use the pieces as tinder," Draco continued cheerfully, voice far away as he rummaged around the bottom of the roof, one lone strand of pale hair sticking out and signalling his position.
Now. Draco would forever reject this order of events. In his (always correct, mind you) opinion, it had all started with that blasted dog.
"I did not!" Potter protested, flushing bright red and sitting up. "I- I would never. I don't even like-" Potter gave a mean glare and finally exploded:
"I… Well." Draco darted his own eyes around the drafty room, uneasy. Grasped for a derisive posture. "Look, I'm not
"What's this now?" Harry Potter stuck his head out of the bed, looking drowsy and confused. His hair was an appalling mess sticking in every direction.
Draco huffed and went to his own side of the library. He sulked for a minute, grinding his teeth. Potter was leaning against the bedframe, and by the looks of his frown, he was equally bad-tempered.
Last came a good-natured fellow who introduced himself as Charlie Weasley – to which Draco wondered if he was bound to meet the whole family in one go – and dropped a shrunken package full of construction material on the floor.
"Well," said Blaise, still peering over the axe like it was some exotic plant, hands at his back. "As much as I am enjoying this Excalibur debacle, I'm afraid I must take my leave."
While Potter gasped next to him, pointing his wand in every direction, and scrambling for his glasses, Draco turned to look behind himself. Sir Brutus Malfoy was now shrieking and shaking a parchment angrily in their direction. His portrait hung skewed and his blond eyebrows were distinctly singed.
“No. I named him Potter after a disastrous afternoon where he chewed on Pansy’s designer shoes, successfully dodged all of her hexes, jumped out the window from the second floor of the Manor, fell on my mother’s rose bushes and was then chased by peacocks.”
Or should it be Draco, now? After all, since I achieved one out of two of my goals last night (your words, not mine) I’m feeling rather… generous. Especially after you wore those not-jeans-but-leather pants again.
“So,” said Ron, after a good five minutes of Harry silently brooding over people thinking his house was dark. “Are you fucking him?”
It started small. Quick glimpses of something black and shapeless, that nonetheless left Draco anxious. He would see it while walking the dog across the park. Sometimes, shopping on Diagon Alley, a shiver would make him pause and look around.
you do it? How do you make even a handwritten letter sound like the work of a complete and utter wanker? I could almost see the derision leaping off the parchment, in your
Harry did file a report. Ron snorted loudly at Harry’s description of being pursued by a large, hooded man in the middle of the night.
“I’m… Sorry, I thought I saw something.” Harry shifted, gazing at the dim street. Their only companions were the biting gusts of air and the rubble tumbling around on the ground. The rain was still falling, making it hard to distinguish a lot of sounds.
“M’fine.” He mumbled, struggling to sit up. His vision swam and nausea suddenly gripped him. Draco hurried to help him, hissing at him to wait. “Just a dream,” he said after a brief pause where Draco conjured an alarming amount of pillows for Harry to lean against.
Nothing would make a difference. The creature stalking them seemed immune to all magic. Draco could feel the panic tightening his throat, making his voice hoarse as he showered their enemy with every curse, hex, and spell he could think off.
"Really, Potter," he drawled. "Are you taking these excellent danger-detecting instincts of yours to the Aurory?"
"I shared this very house you are so hellbent on saving with Voldemort, did you forget that?" Potter shot him a dark look.
“You need blood-replenishing potions,” Draco said somewhere above him. Harry tried to focus on what he was doing, tried to argue that it had to be just a
“Well honestly Harry, you can’t expect to live there as it is. With that horrible portrait and ghastly wallpaper. Why, the dark artefacts alone….”
“Tactful as ever, I see,” drawled Draco, leaning back on his chair and fixing his cuffs. He looked so put together, no one would ever say the man had spent the night up obsessing over Harry’s vital signs. “Say, are you trying to break a record for the number of cuss words per minute?”
“Yeah, but it’s been a week, Harry. He has to be missing his friends. His life. That Astoria bird. We need to step up.” Ron reasoned with his mouth full, and then quickly dodged a smack from Hermione, who was hissing ‘
“Why would Harry- ah, you mean your dog. This is too confusing, can’t we call him something else? Ow!” Ron sent Hermione a disgruntled look over being pinched into silence.
“Kreacher will be preparing the masters’ breakfast tomorrow morning at 7.” The elf stated, rather peevishly, if Harry could say so.
“Give her to me,” Harry said, extending his arms. The little bundle of rage was passed to him. “Hello, Rosie. I know, we were so mean to you this morning. Old fools, the whole lot of us.” He murmured gently, rocking her, and in a few seconds, the baby was peacefully having her breakfast.
“Why are you here ruining my bath?” Blaise leaned over, jaw resting on his hands, grinning like that weird Muggle Cheshire Cat.
“Hermione,” he nodded towards her, before taking back his sit in the armchair next to Harry’s bed. “Where’s the ginger one?”
“Um…” said Harry, when three pairs of eyes focused on him. He straightened himself further up against the pillows “Yes, well, there was blood, but I couldn’t find any wounds. It was just a stupid nightmare. I was sitting next to the Grim, just… there.”
an animal person. He held no regard for beasts, excluding maybe his owl. And even that only on the days the bird didn’t try to bite his fingers. His past was sprinkled with unpleasant events involving the animal kingdom, be they hippogriffs, giant snakes, or peacocks. He had no reason to believe canines were any less worrisome. So, he resisted the small urge to engage the dirty dog camping out on his property and squashed any thoughts of – Merlin forbid – feeding it.
But as he got closer, he saw it wasn’t Sirius at all. This dog was much bigger, with fur cropped closely to his skin. It was lying on the exact spot Harry had fallen and opened yellow eyes that glowed eerily when Harry sat by his side. They faced each other for a while, and Harry took in the way the dog almost shimmered in the dark forest as if it weren’t entirely there.
?!), and a valiant attempt to shake the axe loose off the floorboards been made more than once by each of the four people present in the drawing-room.
“What the hell?” he croaked. The dog, deeming his job done, stopped his sad noises and settled down next to Harry, head on his lap.
They squabbled all the way to the atrium. Harry’s reaction to the dog news was a hearty laugh and a: “Yeah, good one Malfoy.”, to which Draco had taken great offence. Why couldn’t he have a dog? Was there some sort of law disputing a Malfoy’s right to own a mammal? Harry called him an oversensitive prat, Draco accused him of chronic idiocy and they almost forgot about the time limit hanging over their heads when Draco finally side-alonged Harry to his house.
"Right," Potter rubbed his forehead in annoyance and sighed. "Malfoy, you know I'm supposed to keep an eye on you. It's on the terms of…"
"I believe the plan was to incinerate the house, wasn't it darling?" Pansy asked in affected innocence, eyes twinkling. Draco made a face at her.
“Oh,” Draco froze and stared at Harry with surprise. Potter was blushing a bit, but still smiling. Draco made a big production out of rolling his eyes.
“Draco? Is that you?” came a melodic voice from the kitchen. Draco quickly gripped Harry’s wrist to prevent the Auror from attacking. A slender woman dressed in casual clothes entered the living room. Blonde, with delicate features and a kind face, she didn’t fit at all with Harry’s conception of what any friend of Malfoy should look like.
Next came all the joys of looking after a living being. Draco waged war against the stubborn fur, washed the dog until his fingers were pruning, and had a rather disquieting meeting with fleas. He called for reinforcements. Pansy Parkinson and Astoria Greengrass appeared in his house soon afterwards, carrying books, dog food, and mockery.
Harry shook his head again and then pointed at the incriminating pile of paper still scattered on the floor. “What’s all this then?”
“They’re swots, right?” he asked, taking up the vacated space the dog left next to Harry and leaning against the headboard. Harry just shrugged. He had no idea who Conway was, or what a way line might be, for that matter.
“Yes. Would you say, given his upbringing and natural inclinations, that he… Is he… Normally, I mean, does he like…” Was Draco rambling? He suspected he was rambling. “Because it’s appalling, you understand, but some were raised in a certain way and afterwards…”
“We broke up, alright? After the battle,” Potter yelled. Draco felt a slow smile forming on his lips.
“Be that as it may, I’m not your hostage,” Draco said, and arched a brow when Harry turned to scowl at him.
Draco stared from Hermione’s earnest expression to Weasley’s suddenly mollified nodding. Turned to Potter, who was studiously not meeting his eyes. His face was darkening to an intriguing beet-red shade.
a frantic voice, vaguely familiar, boomed through the forest, coming from everywhere and nowhere. Harry frowned at his surroundings, still feeling calm and detached from the whole thing. The Grim stood up, towering over Harry, who continued to just sit still and bleed.
"A re-" He watched Draco look down and around with a frown, even going so far as to check inside the bouquet itself. "You didn't give me one."
With that he was turning and walking into their room, Draco’s mind spinning a million different ways a minute because that- What had that been? Was he saying that he didn’t want anything to do with Draco anymore? Was he saying he wanted more to do with Draco? Did he, perhaps- Well, did he mean… Was it possible…?
"Is that so?" Draco turned back around on him, raising a brow. "And how's that?" Alright… he couldn’t resist.
“Hermione, darling, is perfectly pleasant.” Draco looked to Blaise, who looked just as disturbed as Draco felt over the matter. “And we agree that it’s time we put all of this school rivalry nonsense behind us and, since all of our schedules have lined up just so, we thought it would be great to vacation together!”
Blaise turned traitor and grabbed him before he could add one more murder to his long life of mistakes, sighing and half-laughing with a cheerful, “Well, this is going to be a fun trip, gentleman, don’t you think?”
“What?” Harry pouted, standing back up just to place a hand over his heart in mock hurt. “You don’t trust me?”
“Honestly,” Pansy tsked. “Potter already agreed to the trip and you know that Weasley will do whatever Hermione asks of him-”
Pansy, the little harlot, had waited until Draco had taken a sip of his tea to tell him and Blaise her latest bit of news. As it was, while Draco hadn’t spitten his tea out because he was a gentleman, thank you, he did immediately start choking. Blaise didn’t even attempt to help him, in shock himself — not that Draco could blame him. It wasn’t everyday that their former best friend turned traitor was telling them that she had sold them out to Gryffindors.
