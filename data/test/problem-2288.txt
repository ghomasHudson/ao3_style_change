Draco’s attention was automatically pulled back to the here-and-now. He dreaded the idea of more of them infesting what he very much believed was His school; generations of Malfoy’s had attended Hogwarts, all of them graduating with top grades, and going straight to Oxford or Cambridge. Draco belonged here, in these halls, where his father, and grandfather, and great grandfather had all roamed these hallowed halls.
“Go away, Bryn” Draco heard Ron say, voice low and menacing. The lanky boy- Bryn- tightened his grip on Harry’s arm and turned his saccharine sweet smile to Ron.
“It is lovely to meet you, Sirius. I know little of my mother’s family, so it will be a pleasure to stay with you and get to know you more.”
Draco read along, muttering under his breath. It read; ‘Sirius, what a lovely surprise to hear from you. So nice to hear about Draco, as well, though I have never met the boy. I am delighted at the prospect of correspondence with you. The ‘black sheep’ of the family, if you’ll pardon the pun.’
Blaise smirks as me as if he’s doing me a favour, and not thoroughly humiliating me for the second time in half an hour, and I'm about to AK myself on the spot until...
He doesn’t know what to do, and so he does what he thinks he would want, if he were in Draco’s position. He goes to get Teddy from Molly, and carries the napping infant into their bedroom. Draco is asleep, on his back, looking so peaceful, as if the day before had never happened. Silently, Harry lay’s Teddy’s body on Draco’s chest, and silently retreats. Teddy’s small, chubby body offers a unique sort of comfort that only children can provide.
“Oh! Hey Draco. Didn’t see you there” he heard Harry yell over to the corner where Draco had been not-so-subtly watching them. Harry was still draped across Ron’s lap, and Ron was just laying back on the sofa, eyes closed, basking in the first Friday night back.
“It’s still a no, Gin. and I think you should go home.” he sounded tired, and Draco had to wonder how long Ginny’s crush on Harry had lasted, and why it was only coming to a head now.
He also told Sirius, lying on the sofa with his feet in Sirius’ lap, explaining about the skinny blond boy at his school who was both shy and confident at the same time, who trusted Harry enough to go to him with family troubles, trusted Harry enough to cry in front of him.
Harry was pulling on a t-shirt, and Draco watched the rich brown planes of his stomach disappear under the soft white cotton.
“I am so sorry harry, more than you could ever know. I am sorry for all of it. I am sorry I tried to give you up to you-know-who during the battle. I’m sorry I didn’t apologise the minute I first saw you; I just didn’t know what to say.”
Harry was awoken by Teddy’s cries, early enough in the morning that it didn’t make sense to put him back to bed, so harry wandered down to the living room bleary-eyed, and lay down on the sofa, settling the baby onto his chest. He was on the brink of sleep when he heard tapping at the window, and he waved his hand to let the owl in.
Draco came down, and the five of them drank and talked and laughed whilst they were waiting for Pansy. Harry noticed that Blaise was sitting a bit too close for comfort, but thought nothing of it. Eventually, Pansy descended the stairs looking resplendent in a skin-tight blood-red leather miniskirt and black bra. As before, she was also in a thoroughly scary pair of stilettos, and they clacked down the stairs as she made her entrance.
“Come on, then” came Remus’ deep, gruff voice and Draco closed his eyes against the pain as he slid out of the car. Remus looked at him, bemused, before turning on his heel and marching off to the front door of the house.
Luckily- not that anything about the whole situation felt much like luck to Harry- they landed in the attic unscathed.
“Aren’t you going to uni? Any of you?” Draco asked after they had finished. The question had been weighing on his mind for a while.
In the few short hours since Draco had been there yesterday, the village had been adorned with bunting in cheery pinks and yellows and blues, and once again Draco feels like he’s wandered into an Enid Blyton book. This England is miles away from the London mansion and private school and skyscrapers he’s used to, and it’s jarring. He feels almost as if he’s in a foreign country.
When Draco finally emerged the next day at around noon, having the decency to at least look ashamed, Harry just gave him a brief nod and greeted him with a curt “Malfoy” before taking Teddy off to the park for a walk. he knew how petty he was being, but he decided that whilst Draco acted like the prick he had been at school Harry would refer to him as such; no ‘Draco’, only ‘Malfoy’. He also knew he didn’t want to see Malfoy for a good long while, and that part of his anger had been jealousy; he couldn’t remember the last time he went on a night out. When he returned from the park, he floo called Andy to see if her and Narcissa would take Teddy for the night, to which they of course said yes. He then owled Dean and Seamus to see if they were up for a night in Soho. The two owled back almost immediately, with a very enthusiastic yes. As a muggle born, Dean had taken Seamus and Harry to their first gay clubs, and the three went sometimes. Harry usually felt too guilty for swapping Teddy for a night out, and so since he had taken custody they had only been three times in as many months, but Harry needed to expel some energy after the hospital trip and the fight.
Much to his surprise, Harry and Ron returned later that evening. He had though Harry would want to spend the evening with Sirius. He said as much, but Harry had explained that he felt he had missed too much school already, but he was leaving Friday after lessons to spend the weekend with Sirius.
“no I don’t suppose I would want to share a tent with our gracious saviour. I must admit I’m overjoyed to know I won’t hear Granger and the Weasel shag all night though; the thought alone is enough to drive me to suicide”
He heaved himself off of his step and went to the farmhouse in search of Sirius, who seemed to spend a lot of time indoors. The door opened with just a twist of the handle. It made sense, but still shocked Draco somewhat, as he was used to London, where thievery was rife and you had to lock your door just to step out and chat to a neighbour.
Soon though, Draco gets swept up into conversation with Bill, the brother from the day before, and forgets all about his little spy mission to learn more about the people around him. He spoke to Bill about how he was finding the farm, and even though he had barely spent a week there, Bill seemed genuinely interested in his opinions and thoughts, which made a refreshing change from Harry and Ron.
But in recent weeks, Harry had been a sounding board and a safe space for Draco, and all Draco wanted was to return the favour. He would endeavour to do his best, to fill all the gaps that Ron couldn’t. Ron was a brother to Harry, and Draco could never replace that, nor would he wish to. What Draco needed was to be the best boyfriend in the history of boyfriends, only he wasn’t quite sure how to go about it. Despite Harry’s reassurances, he still felt as though his asexuality meant he was lacking in some way, that there was more he could-and perhaps should- give.
“We’ll leave youse two to it, aye? Harry’ll get youse for lunch” Remus said, holding his elbow out for Sirius to hold on to as they walked back to the farmhouse. Draco and Pansy scarpered into the cottage and collapsed onto the sofa. Pansy immediately swung her legs over his and he was transported back to hours spent in her bedroom, the two of them tangled up on top of the covers of her bed, talking about nothing and everything; discussing which boys they found attractive, complaining about their parents, the like.
Draco gasped. It was as if his deepest fantasies had come to life. He was in shock, and barely managed to reply with “I- what?”
Hermione just rolled her eyes and took Ron’s hand into her own. Harry was shocked she wasn’t immediately and vehemently objecting to the suggestion of taking alcohol on a school trip, but he supposed she had broken the rules a lot over the years, it just barely seemed like it at the time because the situation was always so dire. Despite himself, he found he was looking forward to their weekend. He absently wondered who the other three would be.
“No, not really” Draco said, laughing dryly. “I just caught my father in flagrante with one of his friend’s wives”
Draco went to take another sip of his drink and Harry deftly swiped it out of his hand, before taking a sip and exclaiming “Jesus Draco, are you drinking pure vodka? No wonder you’re this out of it”
I hate him for his patience, and for how right he is, and for how much I want him still, even after I saw him with his tongue down another man’s throat. Just as he’s about to close my door I say “wait”, my voice scratchy and hoarse.
He was well aware of how pathetic his crush was, but each day he spent in Harry’s company only made his feelings increase, and it was hard to avoid him when they all studied together nearly every day. The only time they weren’t together was when Harry and Ron had rugby training, and on weekends. Harry and Ron often went into the village to see Hermione- who, as it turns out, is not Harry’s girlfriend but his best friend, who Ron is quite hopelessly in love with- and Ron’s little sister. There seemed to be something about Ginny. Ron teased Harry about her a lot, and Harry would always respond with “shut up, Ron”. She was the one who called Harry ‘daddy’ on Instagram, and Draco was curious about their dynamic.
The days until Wednesday passed without incident. He, Ron and Hermione shared a chocolate cake Monday night after Teddy had gone to bed. He didn’t tell them about his imminent meeting with the Malfoys, scared they would distrust Malfoy and accuse Harry of putting Teddy in harm’s way by allowing Draco into his home. He had received Narcissa’s confirmation of her and Draco’s attendance on Monday afternoon. It was a painfully formal letter, but nevertheless she graciously accepted his invitation. Tuesday passed in a blur of preparation. Harry wished to make something somewhat impressive, and also provide a selection, desperately wanting to impress the Malfoys, who were the wizarding version of aristocracy, or landed gentry. He strapped Teddy to his chest before setting off to Tesco, already used to the weird looks he received from muggles for being so young with a baby that was a stark pale to his dark skin. He got all the ingredients he needed. On a whim, he ventured into Covent Garden to get a selection of loose-leaf tea from the fancy tea shop there.
“and then Draco came and said that I didn’t have to forgive them but I had moved past it because if I hadn’t they wouldn’t be in my house around Teddy, which is true but then she cried harder and I told her that I have you and that I’m happy now, but then the minute she calmed down, Draco explained to Blaise and then I could hear Blaise shouting about the cupboard and the starvation and about how badly they bullied me about it without knowing and then I forgot you were coming so I had to bring Parkinson down to make the cake which barely helped because I can’t relax if I’m not alone in the kitchen but she looked so upset I couldn’t tell her to go away and it’s all too much and, and I- I”
He hoped it was enough. He hoped it wouldn’t scare Draco off, or remind Draco how different their lives were. Draco grew up in a sprawling country side estate with hunting and ascot. Harry grew up in a cupboard.
The last sentence hit me like a bludger to the stomach, and I stare helplessly as my closed door, desperately wishing Potter will come back even though I know he won’t. I can’t do this. I can’t talk to him. I also can’t let him continue without knowing my feelings, and so like the coward I am, I decide to write it down.
Harry chuckled, and said “you’ll want to see this mate” before going to the door and flinging it open. “Darling!” squealed Pansy before leaping into his arms, bride-style, and licking along his collar bone. “you taste divine, Potty dear” she said, grinning at him like the Cheshire cat.
“think about it. You look like you’ve had a hard day- if you’re not too angry, I’ll get takeaway and we can eat it on the sofa like normal, and if you don’t want to be with me I’ll bring it to you when it gets here. I might not understand why, but I’m still sorry I upset you Draco.” He says, patting my shoulder and leaving just like I did to him almost two years ago now.
I watched this all from my armchair, the unwilling spectator. I was about to get up and go after Hermione when Potter flopped onto the armchair across from me, staring at me with that intense gaze of him that reminds you that you are faced not with an eighteen-year-old, but with the man that managed to defeat the wizard not even Dumbledore could. After a long minute of being stared at, I turned back to my book and was getting stuck back into the world of Bram Stoker and his blood-sucking fiend, Potter said “how do you do it?”
“I sent Dean and Seamus home.” She said, before lapsing back into silence. Minutes passed, with only Draco’s deep breathing to be heard.
Ron and Hermione stood in the corner with Teddy, looking confused and massively out of their depth. Perceptive as ever, Pansy walked over and carefully scooped Teddy into her arms, cooing over him for a bit before looking at the two Gryffindors standing before her.
“Ron! Put your arse away. I’m sure that whoever is outside doesn’t want to see your dick this early on a Saturday.”
Draco was so enamoured with this new discovery of the Golden Boy he felt himself reply in the same language; “mais quand? J’ne savais pas que tu étais allé en France?” (but when? I didn’t know you had been to France)
Harry laughed. “this isn’t for you mate, this is for Pansy and Blaise. Just wait, and you’ll see what I mean” Harry said, heading upstairs and thinking about how Pansy’s new habit of coming in the front door so she could fling herself into Harry’s arms would shock Ron.
“thank you, Harry, this looks wonderful.” Said Narcissa with more warmth than Harry had expected. As they ate, they made somewhat stilted, but not awkward small talk, until all of the sandwiches and most of the cakes were gone.
It had been a pub night, and me and Potter were making our way home when he stopped and turned to me, and confessed his sodding love to me. Well, not quite. It was all “I really like you” and “you’re funny and smart and better than me in every way”- well, not quite. But there were a lot of compliments, and he said “I really think this could work” That was the sentence that stuck with me. I liked Potter, I mean who wouldn’t? all tall dark and handsome with green eyes and good with children, and since my lecture he really was kind. Always making me cups of tea and doing dinner and things that make my heart melt. I like him too, a lot, too much even, but I’m not stupid. “I really think this could work” of course it couldn’t. I’m the ex-death eater, the only one on the wrong side not in Azkaban apart from Goyle and maybe Pansy, if she counts, and I did more for Voldemort than the other two combined, and thus I am the public scapegoat for any and all frustrations left over from the war. I could never be with Potter. The public wouldn’t let us. Hell, even his friends probably wouldn’t let us. I knew he was wrong, I knew we could never work, and so what else could I do except lie through my teeth?
“That sounds like a story I want to hear” Draco replied, wondering how Harry ever managed to date Cedric. They were equally good looking, but Cedric had been at Hogwarts since year seven, so Draco had no idea how he had met Harry.
Immediately all eyes were on Harry and Bianca in the middle of the floor. Harry positioned himself behind her, broad hands on her waist as she bent down and began to roll her hips suggestively intime to the music. Harry did the same, their hips grinding in unison as they danced.
“fuck ‘mione I barely know. Me and pansy had a lovely day shopping. Don’t give me that look, Ron, I had fun. Anyway, great day and then Teddy was fussing so we watched a film and then Pansy wanted to help me put him to bed and so we went up and we were chatting and then my childhood came up because I accidentally said I wasn’t allowed to watch films because I’m a fucking idiot and I forgot they don’t know and then she asked why and you know I have my policy about not lying because it’s part of me and I shouldn’t feel ashamed about it so I told her the barest bones and she had a breakdown about how she used to treat me. She hugged me and started sobbing, like proper crying, so I sat on the armchair and let her sit on my lap so she could cry on my shoulder and she kept apologising and crying and crying and apologising and you know I don’t like that.”
Eventually, though, Harry arrived, Draco saw him through a window, strolling down the winding front path in his dungarees over another large sweater, and an orange beanie over his riotous curls. He always dressed like a ninety’s poster boy.
He started dancing in earnest now, clearly affected by Ron’s impending return, given that it was too early for anyone sane to be dancing.
Luckily, just as the cold was beginning to get hard to bear, people started getting up and turning in. Hermione and her parents piled into their little mini and drove off into the night, followed by the vast amount of Weasley’s. Draco took the upheaval of guests as cover to make his exit, and he silently made his way back to his little house that was slowly growing on him, despite its small size.
Draco stared up into the darkness, pushing away all thoughts of Harry. He let the knowledge that he was back at Hogwarts, and safe, rock him into a deep, easy sleep. Free was enough, but now, at least by Potter, he was forgiven.
Draco used to love them. He loved being doted on, praised to the high heaves, shown off. He had a marginally better understanding of the wider world now, and now all he saw were old white men and their wives with too much money to spend in a lifetime, hoarding wealth and making political decisions that just kept the poor in poverty and made the rich richer. It was becoming hard to pretend he agreed with their politics.
Harry wormed his way through the crowd on the dance floor, scanning the writhing mass of bodies before he found Draco dancing with Pansy. He grabbed one of Draco’s hands in his and dragged him out of the club. “Harry, what’s wrong? You’re shaking, did something happen?”
When he next emerged in the kitchen, Pansy was bouncing Teddy on her lap, Draco had his head on the table and Blaise was watching in mild amusement.
“I don’t know how interested you are in rugby, but the first proper match against another school is in two weeks. You should come. It’s a home game so on our fields, yeah” Harry whispered as Draco desperately tried to copy the lesson notes he’d missed from Harry’s notebook.
“get the fuck out of my bed , Potter” Draco drawled, kicking the sleeping boy next to him, weirdly fearful of how the raved would respond.
That day, Sirius had mentioned that Effie was coming over for dinner again. It was a monthly thing, he explained. He also explained that she was Harry’s paternal grandmother, and that her and her husband Monty had emigrated to England from India when they were in their twenties, and had bought this farm, which at the time had been entirely dilapidated, having been bombed in the war with no one around bothered to rebuild it. The only things that had survived were the farmhouse and cottage, but they were worse-for-wear and surrounded by the debris of bombed-out barns and animal carcasses.
Then again that was Draco’s MO. Always pining over men who didn’t want him back, mainly straight boys at school who had wowed Draco with their confidence. Because of this, and because he had always been too scared to come out at school, Draco hadn’t even had his first kiss yet. It made him a bit ashamed to think about it, but with Harry sitting there, glistening with sweat and chatting to Ron about something Draco didn’t really understand, Draco couldn’t help but think about how nice it would be if Harry wanted to kiss him, and how unlikely that was to ever happen.
“Oh, Draco” Harry said when he looked up. he dropped the book and walked over to Draco, wrapping his arms around Draco’s shoulders and squeezing him tight.
They walked for about two hours, going around the tiny village about three times. Sirius knew most of the locals by name, and they all greeted him cheerily, which he hadn't expected. His view of old english villages were that they were all quite racist and homophobic. When he voiced this to Sirius, he hummed.
Harry wandered over to the tents, where Ron and Hermione were. As much as the idea of Malfoy being too weak to carry his own bag sat uncomfortably with Harry, he was glad for the extra weight; the extra challenge. The burn of his legs with the added weight would hopefully distract Harry enough that he wouldn’t be reminded of his year of horcrux camping to painfully, or too often. He and Hermione, but mainly Hermione, had spent the week teaching Ron muggle camping traditions, and Harry found himself looking forward to making a campfire each night, sharing the firewhiskey Ron had snuck into his bag and having fun, like normal teenagers. He was excited to star gaze and roast marshmallows and generally feel like a teenager for perhaps the first time in his life, and with the extra weight of his bag he knew he would still get the gratifying release of emotion that exercise brought him. Surprisingly, he found himself actually excited. Excited enough to almost forget who he, Hermione and Ron would have to share this experience with. Almost.
“Potter, you have spent every day of your life since age eleven being told that you are a Good Person, capitalised. You are the saint, the saviour, the golden one, the epitome of goodness in our world. Eventually of course, through no fault of your own, you believe this. You internalise the belief that you are a Good Person, again capitalised. When you look in the mirror, you see a Good Person. When you talk to your friends, you talk to them as a Good Person. Forgive the intrusion, but the first eleven years of your life were spent believing you were worthless, yes?”
He withdrew his phone, and to his drunken delight, saw that harry had accepted his request and requested to follow him back. grinning like a fifteen-year-old girl, Draco goes to look at the pictures. Unfortunately, he was seeing everything double, and so resolved to do some thorough stalking in the morning, when he was just a tad more sober.
He looks contemplative here, as if only realising that I am capable of goodness; as if only realising that I am my own person, not a pawn of my father.
Having finally tracked down the elusive desert, not wishing to return empty handed, Draco wandered into the hospital wing at 9pm, and saw Harry, broom free, head in Luna’s lap as she French plaited his hair. He looked so happy, despite the pain he must have been in, and Draco almost felt he couldn’t disturb the two, no matter how jealous he may have felt. Harry’s face broke into a grin when he saw Draco, tart in hand, and like a child on Christmas he reached out and made grabby hands, unable to sit up while Luna played with his curls.
He finds her in the kitchen, with a glass of wine and a plate of biscuits. She looks up when he walks in, but doesn’t say anything. Instead, she rises, drains the last of her wine and takes his hand, before dragging him back to his room. She climbs onto the covers, and he gets in next to her, laying his head on her lap like he used to when he was little.
“I’ll make a compromise Harry- if we go to a muggle club, will you come?” reasoned Neville. Harry considered- he could do with a night out in anonymity, and he hadn’t had any action in a long time.
Draco didn't know whether to be complimented at being called ‘decent’, especially given that Harry didn't act towards Draco as if he thought he were decent, or insulted that Harry didn't care about why he was there, but before he could dwell too much, Harry and Ginny were right by the gate, so he stepped aside to allow the cows through, then joined them on the lower level. For the rest of that morning, the conversation went forgotten.
“These things take time, you know? And we need to have a friendship that is free of that childish resentment before we can start anything more than that, and we’re just not there, you know? We need more time to trust each other as friends and Harry knows that, but whenever he’s mad at us he keeps insisting we just need to hash out all the old stuff and then jump each other.”
“you better not step on my toes in those” grumbled Harry, coming up behind Draco and wrapping his arms around him, resting his chin on Draco’s shoulder, even though he had to bend slightly to do so. “I don’t want broken toes”
Sometimes, in times of self-doubt, he wonders if it is internalised homophobia as a result of his father and school environment, but he is generally quite confident that sex is just something that holds no appeal to him.
“I cannot imagine how hard it must be for you to be in this position” Harry says softly, and Draco feels a large, warm hand cover his. He opens his eyes again, looking down at the contrast between brown and white skin.
“don’t leave” he heard the slurred mumbled words and rolled his eyes. He stripped, and accio’d his pyjamas before changing and slipping into bed next to Draco. With a wave of his hand he turned the lights off and settled down to sleep. He heard rustling, and soon a head was on his chest, and a leg was thrown over both of his. He deeply regretted not putting more clothes on Draco, but imagined he would have found it a near impossible task. When he heard Draco’s breathing deepen and even out, he slipped out and went downstairs. He sat at the table, ate brownies and pondered the situation as he waited for the others to get back.
Effie and Monty had then bought the farm, re-named it after themselves and re-built it from the ground up, starting with only a dairy herd and a handful of sheep. He spoke of how they worked tirelessly to create a business that was strong enough for them to pass down to their son, of how this was where Sirius came when he was kicked out, how he became a second son to them, and thus how he inherited. He ghosted over James’ death, but talked of how he and Remus had moved here straight after, adopting Harry as their own and raising him as they knew his parents would have wanted.
“Hermione, this is Draco. He’s my cousin, staying for a few months and helping us with the farm” Sirius said when she finally paused to take a breath.
“I always wanted a brother” he offered into the raw space between them. “I thought,” he coughed, voice breaking a little. “I thought that maybe if I had a brother Father might leave me alone a bit more. I always had to do and be everything, and god, it was the worst feeling in the world. I was just never good enough.”
“there’s your feelings. Those are important, and I’m sure you have a lot right now” Harry said, still just standing in front of Draco.
“Shit, shit I’m so sorry, I’m sorry, sorry” Draco babbled, stumbling back and smoothing down his t-shirt.
“Harry. I’m not having my sister present whilst I try and woo Hermione. Bring Luna.” Ron said, which a self-deprecating laugh.
“Hermione mentioned coming over later, I’ll get her to talk to him” Sirius murmured back, and Remus nodded before standing and stretching. He nodded to Draco, making his earring glint in the sunlight that was streaming through the windows, and left the kitchen.
He wore his walking boots anyway, mainly because the village was surrounded by countryside and he wouldn't be surprised if the celebrations took place in one of the surrounding fields rather than the village square.
“s’alright mate. I would say it’s because you’re my brother, but I would abandon Percy in a heartbeat”
“Thank you” Harry said, ignoring propriety and hugging her. He felt her slender hands rest on his back for the briefest of moments before he let go.
“My rooms up here if you wanna go...?” Draco asked instead, feeling utterly out of his depth. He’d only ever had five friends round to his house before, and he’d known them all since before primary, and they all had houses just as big.
“Oh hey! Draco” from the other sofa, he looked up and found himself staring directly into disarmingly green eyes.
Someone had hung some lanterns, which glowed a comforting orange in the summer night as Draco and Pansy followed Sirius and Remus out of the house and to the big table.
To Draco’s parents, studying sciences or maths implied studying for a future vocation, such as medicine or engineering, and Malfoy’s didn’t work such menial jobs- they’ve always had enough money not to need to. Draco’s father had wanted him to study economics; ‘Draco my boy, people with money must understand money’, but Draco could think of nothing worse, and so had insisted that the class was full when he applied. Despite being governor, he knew his father would be unable to interfere so directly on his behalf without raising questions, and so Draco was safe for now.
Ron snuck into his tent and brought out a bottle of Ogdens, opening it with zeal and taking a hefty swig before handing it to Hermione, sat next to him. She drank from the bottle more primly, and passed it to Harry, who drank deep. His new bulky physique had led to a surprising tolerance for alcohol. He passed the bottle to Malfoy, who sat on his other side, and the boy also drank deep, a bit too deep perhaps, given how thin he was. They spent the next hour like that, passing the bottle round. They chatted, or rather five of them chatted and Malfoy stared pensively into the fire, his hair falling around his pale face flushed rose with alcohol.
“show me your constellation” he says. Malfoy giggles, before turning his head to face Harry and saying
Harry stumbled groggily down the corridor to where he could hear Teddy crying. Eyes barely open, he scooped the baby up and collapsed into the plush armchair in the corner of the nursery. Teddy calmed immediately and soon was fast asleep. Unfortunately Harry was not so lucky. As he stroked the sleeping boy’s hair, he wondered how he had got there. He was barely 18 and basically a dad already; Andromeda helped with Teddy as she could but was so deep in her grief, she had become neglectful of the infant, and before it could border on abuse Harry had swooped in without thinking, taking full custody of the baby and moving into Grimmauld place. He had enough money that he needn’t worry about a job yet and for all intents and purposes, he was essentially a stay-at-home dad before he had even reached adulthood.
Here at Hogwarts, if you made the team, your GCSES, A-Levels, UCAS application all came second to rugby. The school lived, breathed and ate rugby, and it was damned good at it too.
“I'd be honoured to be your first. And second, and third, and hopefully all the ones after” Harry said, and god but Draco could have died on the spot. Instead, all he mustered up was a breathy
The bonfire was crackling nicely now. He was sat sandwiched between Ron and Hermione, his favourite place to sit so as to stop them necking in his presence, and they never seemed to mind much. Ron was using a small knife to sharpen sticks into points so they could roast marshmallows. Once he was done, he nudged Harry with his elbow, so Harry held his hand out and said “accio marshmallows”.
One thing led to another, and we got together. It was weird. He was older, and when you’re sixteen and in your first relationship with a man, that year difference feels so much more significant, and he lorded it over me a lot, made me feel inadequate. We dated for five months, and the week before our six-month anniversary, he told me he ‘wasn’t looking for anything serious’ which was bullshit, because six months is pretty bloody serious at our age, quite honestly.
“Oh, tell them to bring their stuff, and we can all change in here, yeah? Right let’s change into normal clothes to get them here. I look like a brown Elton john in this, which doesn’t bode well for secrecy”
“you- you don’t regret it, Potter? You’re not here to beat the death eater for taking advantage of you in your intoxicated state?” the words didn’t contain the bite Draco intended, instead they came out weak and shaky.
“she looked like Hermione because she’s Hermione’s cousin, and god I wasn’t ‘all over her’, we were dancing.” Here Harry looked annoyed and god, Draco could have cried knowing that he had somehow caused this.
“yea, and blonds” replied Harry, giving Teddy his finger to nibble on. Draco coughed, and Harry and Pansy shared a look before laughing. To Harry’s surprise, even Blaise smiled.
Harry and Blaise spent a lot of time discussing racial politics, and they bonded in their shared identity of being people of colour in a predominantly white institution. As Blaise was Black and Harry Indian, they shared and compared curry recipes, and had become fast friends.
“I really, really didn’t want to do this in my office” he starts, reaching out for one of my hands. It’s shaking when I lay it in his large, dark palm.
“I love Plato!” Harry replied, which Draco wasn’t expecting. He had prepared for an answer along the lines of ‘er, who’s that?’ but alas, Harry continues to astound with his intellect.
Harry handed Draco his phone and the four of them assembled into a little group. Harry slid his arm around Luna. She smelled of lemons, he thought absently. She stretched onto her tip toes and kissed him on the cheek, and he grinned at the camera.
It almost seemed as if Harry was having relationship drama… about a boy. That didn’t make sense though. Rugby boys weren’t gay… they couldn’t be. They were always so mockingly homophobic. But it really sounded as if Harry had had a run in with an ex-something.
“D’ya bring scones, Ron?” Harry asked, but nodded at Draco nonetheless. Draco counted this as a win.
Finally, Ron’s brothers spoke a bit of sense into him and he broke up with her, and year thirteen was a bit like a dream. We were all good again, and Ron and I were getting closer and building a better friendship.”
She ushered Draco down onto the bench at the table, and Harry looked amused at the whole interaction. Just as Harry himself was sitting down, Sirius and Remus came in.
Draco leaned over the balcony, watching the almost angelic scene beneath him; the two women cuddled up to Harry, who sat in the middle, watching the fire and singing some of the most beautiful words Draco had ever heard. Loathe to interrupt, he walked slowly down the stairs and made himself a cup of tea- his preferred way to start the day. He walked past the trio on his way back to his room, but Luna reached a nymph-like arm out and pulled him down gently to sit on the sofa by her feet. His heart constricted at the kindness of the gesture, especially after Luna’s ordeal at the Manor, but she said she had forgiven him last night, and here she was proving that her words rang true. He absentmindedly rubbed at the forearm where the faded mark lay, heart aching at the pureness that remained in Hogwarts, despite Voldemort’s (and his, he supposed- he had let the Car rows in, after all) best efforts to corrupt the school to its core.
Harry and Ron looked at each other as they heard footsteps go down the hall and then stop, as Cedric presumably went to the other room on this floor.
“it’s alright my darling. I had my suspicions, but as yet I never had any proof. I think I can handle it, though.” She said. Draco didn’t know how she was always so strong. Here he was, crying like a baby, when his mum had just found out- from her own son, no less- that her husband of twenty years was sleeping with another woman.
It bought a small amount of male satisfaction that Cedric seemed quite desperate for Harry’s company again.
She nattered on though, talking about her day completely oblivious to the missing person, which Draco could see was making Sirius and Remus uncomfortable, likely because it showed the progression of her illness.
Draco doesn’t reply, but rather takes a risk by dropping his head onto Harry’s shoulder. He relaxes when Harry rests his cheek atop Draco’s head, and it’s all Draco can do not to squeal. This is the most intimate he has ever been with a boy, which is very embarrassing but also so, so nice to experience.
Just as the panic threatened to overwhelm, he heard a deep voice behind him say “er, Malfoy, do you need any help with that?” Draco stiffened, embarrassed at being so obvious in his struggle, and turned around to face Potter. He didn’t know what to say. he couldn’t lie, but dear merlin he couldn’t possibly ask for help. He looked at Potter. Despite Potter’s usual insistence to wear clothes at least two sizes too big at all times he was in form fitting running shorts that showed off impossibly muscular thighs. And not impossibly in the hyperbolic describing-attraction way, but truly impossible. Potter may have been a good quidditch player, but he had never trained on a professional level and school players did not train in a way that allowed for that kind of muscle.
“Draco.” Replies Draco curtly. Quite rudely, even, if Draco cared about being rude, which he didn’t. He was so used to being mocked for his name, and he knew how mean rugby boys could be.
“Does it do takeaway?” Harry asks, and Peterson frowns slightly. “I thought we could go out for lunch one day next week, as a change” Peterson said, stepping subtly closer to Harry. I’m clutching the stem of my glass so tightly it’s a wonder it hasn’t snapped yet.
“someone Neville has been trying to set me up with for months. I have no romantic interest in him nor him in me and so we settled on a no-strings-attached arrangement. He’s nice, but he’s not you.”
“Blaise hasn’t- has he ever done anything like this before?” Harry asked, unsure of what he wanted the answer to be.
Harry shook off his confusion and jogged onto the pitch. He joined the crescent the other boys had formed around their coach, situating himself next to Ron and preparing himself for the gruelling two hours ahead.
“Shit. It isn’t Hermione, is it?” Draco asked, scandalised at the love triangle emerging in his mind.
“Because if you go, you can always leave, and you may feel a sense of closure. If you don’t go, there’ll never be an opportunity for that” she had said, and it was like she was reading his mind.
My father made his claim upon my mother in their fourth year. His father had heard murmurings that Rodolphus Lestrange was not fussed about which sister it was that he married, and my father considered Narcissa to be the prettiest (and sanest, but he never says this out loud) and so he staked his claim, ensuring that she would be unable to accept if Rodolphus did indeed decide to propose to my mother.
“you’re disgusting Parkinson” laughed Harry, “and technically, its ‘god-daddy’” he said, before turning to the floo, hearing Draco get up off the sofa to follow.
“It’s lovely to meet you, Hermione,” Draco replied, happy that she seemed to have taken to him faster than Harry and Ron.
“I really thought he’d come here to find us. God, he pisses me off so much sometimes.” she said, more to herself than to Draco.
“I’m confident enough in my academic ability that hopefully my grades will allow me a place” Draco said, trying not to let himself think of what he would do if he didn’t get in.
“Weasley, if only Harry liked me the way I want him to” Blaise’s deep voice rumbled, and Harry instinctively knew Ron had turned bright red. He heard Pansy chuckle beside him, and he smiled, wrapping an arm around her.
Harry couldn’t be considerate. If he turned out to be kind, Draco would never be able to drag himself away from this. Not that he wanted to now, with Harry’s green eyes boring into Draco from behind his glasses, his dark skin glowing in the midday sun, such a contrast from Draco’s alabaster. Draco wanted to keep this moment forever.
“A shame indeed, I would have liked to meet your friends” Harry says, tightening his grip on me and stepping a bit closer- his way of signalling he will want to leave soon.
Draco would spend his mornings following Harry, Remus, or one of the Weasley brother’s around the farm, doing his best to help despite his staggering incompetence. They didn't really need his help; Molly’s overabundance of sons meant that there was always manpower available when needed, but Draco was there to earn his keep and so he awoke at five each morning, usually to help with milking the cows, before following his assigned babysitter-most often Harry, who barely acknowledged his presence at all- for the day around the fields for hours until lunch. After lunch, he was usually let off, and this time he spent in the house with Sirius, talking.
Harry gingerly sat on the edge of the bed, cross legged rather than stretched out like Draco. Draco picked ‘how to train your dragon’ because it was a sweet kid’s film that he had seen before, and he didn’t want anything too heavy.
He was awoken as promised the next morning, and opened bleary sleep-blurry eyes to the figure of Harry standing over his bed.
Once Harry is well and truly gone, though, the weight of his familial problems comes crashing back down, and Draco goes to find his mother.
“Come here” Harry said, before pulling Draco against him. Draco cuddled into his side, and Harry dropped a kiss to his forehead. Draco blushed at the domesticity of it.
“Fucking muggles are we, Potter?” I say, smirking. This act that Blaise and I are putting on reminds me so much of before the war that I struggle not to cry. I detest who I was then, but God do I miss being the Ice Prince of Slytherin. I miss the superiority, the confidence, the knowledge that every Slytherin would do my bidding at the drop of a hat. I miss having that power. In today’s post-war landscape, I am powerless.
The first rugby game of the year was coming up, and Draco was trying too hard not to think about what it meant that Harry asked him, especially as none of the boys had mentioned it, so he assumed that meant that Harry hadn’t invited any of them.
Draco slid in the front on the other side, and they were off.  It was a maybe 15 minute drive, and Draco stared at the fields as they flew by his window, blurred white dots of sheep adorning the landscape. Then, a few houses joined the sheep in the fields, and before he knew it they had entered a little village. The buildings were small and quaint, mainly red brick. They had manicured front gardens and little white fences and Draco felt a little like he had fallen into an Enid Blyton book.
Blaise came back every summer with tales of conquests made in Italy. Of steamy kisses and tan skin in the piazzas of Rome. Of shared ice-cream and sea-scented hotel rooms along the southern coast.
Draco had never showered faster in his life. When he emerged, in a pair of Harry’s trackies and a blondie t-shirt (the joke was not lost on him), Harry was sat on the bed, softly singing along to a song he didn’t know but recognised as Hozier.
He heard the stairs creak again, and Harry hastily drew back the covers on the empty bed, hefted the boy into it, covered him again, and hid in Draco’s bathroom, locking the door behind him.
With a wave of his wand, mellow and soft music filled the room, and Harry just held Draco there, whispering into his ear.
He was too stressed to do homework, and so just sat at his desk, staring out the window and wringing his hands for what felt like hours until there was a tentative knock at his door.
“it’s okay Pansy. You didn’t know, no one new. I preferred the teasing to pity, honestly” he said, but she just cried harder. He navigated them over to the armchair before turning them. He sat down and pulled her into his lap, letting him cry on his shoulder. After about five minutes, he heard the door open and looked up to see Draco standing there. Harry wrapped his arms around Pansy before saying to Draco “my childhood came up.”
Draco stumbled, foot slipping on a loose rock that he hadn’t seen, and he was caught again by none other than Potter, who gently propped him up, and then, as if sensing the exhaustion that permeated Draco’s very bones, murmured “it’s not long now, Malfoy, and then you can rest until tomorrow”
It was coming up to the October half term, and Draco was definitely ready to go home. Through some miracle, and possibly the close proximity of their living quarters, but since that fateful Sunday after the first whiskey night, Harry and Ron had blended near-seamlessly with Draco’s group.
“Why’s he even here, anyway?” Ginny asked, looking put out that Draco was seemingly the one coming between her and Harry, oblivious to the fact he had no romantic interest in her.
Ron and Hermione helped, of course. They had helped him fix up the ancient house of Black, putting in a nursery and tidying up the garden. The three of them had put all the heirlooms and old furniture in the attic and on the fourth floor, sealing the top of the house off. From the third floor down Grimmauld was near unrecognisable. It was the epitome of modernity and had everything a child could wish for, at Harry’s insistence. He was adamant that Teddy have all he had lacked as a child. The kitchen was large but cosy, as it was slightly subterranean. They had decked it out with light wood and dark granite, and in a typical display of whimsy, Luna and Molly Weasley had bedecked the kitchen in homemade bunting. The living room was bright, with a muggle telly, and a host of plush sofas and armchairs. The floor was currently scattered with toys Harry had not had the energy to put away earlier. The entrance was light and inviting, Walburga replaced with countless photos, muggle and wizard alike of all those Harry loved and believed Teddy would need to see every day. Harry and Teddy’s parents, Sirius and Lupin, the Weasleys, Luna, many photos of the golden trio, often with Neville in tow, face obscured by a large plant, that had been taken over the summer after the war. Photography had become Harry’s new thing. He was so scared of losing any more people, and he learned to cope by taking as many photos as he possibly could, so should the worst happen and yet another of his loved ones died, he would have so many versions of them on film he would never truly leave him. While the others found this somewhat sinister and paranoid, they all indulged him, and he had been gifted more cameras than he knew what to do with on his 18th birthday after the war. Teddy was in many of these too. Him with Tonks and Remus, him with Harry. Him being held by nearly everyone Harry had ever met. Teddy barely had object permanence, but his bedroom walls were covered with photos of him with the minister for magic, the headmistress of Hogwarts, the head of the Wizengamot, the list goes on.
He regrets the last part the minute it leaves his mouth, and he stares up into the darkness breathing raggedly, waiting for Harry to leave, reject his love, kick him out, but the cries continued, and Harry didn’t move. Draco fell asleep to the sounds of tears.
Draco watched Harry sway, and on the line ‘mama, ooh I don’t wanna die, sometimes I wish I’d never been born at all’ he knew he unequivocally loved Potter. In what way, he wasn’t entirely sure; he would happily have Potter as a friend and nothing more so long as it meant he could be as close to the boy as possible.
Here Harry laughed at his own joke, and Draco couldn't help but think how handsome he looked when he laughed, how carefree and uninhibited.
“I have little in the way of romantic experience, but my best friend Pansy is not only a girl but also a hopeless romantic, and I know she’d tell you to remember that Ginny’s feeling’s are her own responsibility, not yours, and so is how she handles them. If she wants to put them on you that's her decision and her responsibility.” Draco said.
Harry was due to arrive any minute, and Draco was unsure of whether he should wait in Harry’s room with Ron, or let Harry come to him. He settled on waiting in his own room. It was a Saturday, so Theo was out cavorting with Daphne.
“Andi replied to me” Sirius said, turning his face skywards to look up at Remus. A single tear wended its way down his cheek. Remus looked down with the softest expression Draco had ever seen.
“Good birthday so far?” Harry asked, bringing a hand from behind his head to nudge his glasses up his nose.
“That's rich coming from you. Where’s any of tha’ fucking communication between you an’ Ron, eh?” Harry asked, suddenly angry. Draco was honestly surprised.
The next thing he was aware of was a knock on the door. When he opened it, he saw that he had been lost in his book for hours; darkness had fallen, and stars twinkled and winked at him from overhead. Harry was stood at the door, looking more put together than Draco had ever seen him. He was in a baggy short-sleeve button down and jeans that looked to be older than Draco’s father.
“Yes Ronald, but you have the emotional capacity of a teaspoon.” Hermione replied, flicking him on the nose.
The first Tuesday of the holiday found Harry back in Draco’s room, as they decided what to do for their project. Draco had spent an hour deciding what to wear, which was futile because almost his clothes were the same style, or the same colour. He decided on jeans, again, because Harry wore a lot of jeans, and his denim dungarees, and then a soft long sleeve jersey top that Pansy had bought him.
I don’t trust myself to speak, but I take my wand from my bedside table and open the door so he knows he can come in. he sits gingerly on the side of my bed, so I am staring at the outline of his thighs in the dark. I do not expect what he says next.
And I’m not saying that to be snobbish, but god I hate them and they hate me. I always feel so… small when I come here. Everyone’s in love with Harry and despite the fact that we’ve been in a loving and committed relationship for the past five years, I am still seen as a mere…obstacle in the pathway to the saviour.
Greg and Vince nodded, clearly just excited at the prospect of stronger stuff. Draco was wary. He liked his friends, but not enough to trust them to look after him during drunken mishaps. Draco would never admit this, not even to himself, but he was abysmal at holding his liquor.
Harry and Ron had made it back to their room half an hour before curfew, having spent most of the day gallivanting around the countryside with Hermione. It had been amazing, and she had promised to bring Ginny the next time she came down to see them. Going back to Hogwarts after eating chip butties in a proper ye olde English pub with his two best mates in the whole world was bittersweet, but Harry was also really starting to like his new school. He was in bed, reading a book when the door slammed open.
“I know you’re gay, Draco. It's not exactly subtle, not to someone who’s also gay. I also know that your mother knows that I’m gay, even though your prick of a father doesn’t, excuse my language.”
“you can take him through to the living room while we clear up, Mrs Malfoy. It’s just through that door and up that small flight of stairs- the room you floo’d into” he explained, before gathering plates up, and placing stasis charms on the remaining food.
Once there, he curled up in bed on top of the duvet, fully clothed, and fell into a fitful sleep. When Remus came to get him for dinner, he said he wasn't feeling well enough.
“I don’t think Harry likes me much, or will ever like me much, but that doesn’t change that this is the nicest place I’ve ever been, and that you and Remus are the kindest people I’ve ever met. I really don’t want to go back to my father.”
It all came back to Potter on this infernal weekend. Every time he closed his eyes Draco could feel the warmth of Potter’s body wrapped around him, Potters soft breathing stirring up the hair at the nape of Draco’s neck. Every time he adjusted his bag he was reminded of Potter’s unexpected kindness. Draco didn’t know what to do. He and Potter, despite not being enemies, or hostile, or hateful anymore, were still no closer to being friends, or so Draco thought. Once this weekend was over, they would go back to their own worlds; never talking, never interacting, never cuddling under the stars on a crisp welsh September night his brain treacherously supplied. Draco heaved a sigh, that same bittersweet feeling filling his veins.
Harry held Luna’s hand as they followed McGonagall’s swift, un-faltering footsteps to a far corner of the castle, which was to become their home. Upon reaching a large ornate door, she turned around and announced to the gathered teenagers the decisions made for their Eighth year.
Maybe, just maybe this won’t be so bad after all, I think as Potter stands behind me and slides his arms around me, pressing kisses to my back and shoulders.
Draco wanted to melt into a little puddle. How could just one phone call make him feel all warm all over?
“that means only bad things, very bad things. Bad things like us being in a group with Malfoy bad things” the ginger said, fighting against his girlfriend who was pulling him closer to the board.
Draco exhaled slowly, pressing the heels of his palms against his eyes, ready for the onslaught of disgust and rage he was surely about to face. He waited long moments, but the angry words, the pain of a punch never came. He felt instead a large palm running comfortingly up and down his arm and he dared to look up.
Pansy almost dropped her mug. Wandless magic was done only by the most powerful and experienced of wizards. Most are only able to do a wordless Lumos, nox, or if they’re lucky, an aguamenti. That Potter treated a wandless incendio like it was nothing was crazy to her. He must be a veritable well of raw power. She couldn’t tell if it made her feel more safe or more nervous to be stuck with him for a weekend.
Harry pushed Teddy in the baby swings and soon the little playground was filled with the sounds of Teddy’s giggles and Harry was once again reminded of how right his decision to adopt Teddy had been, even though he was approaching his nineteenth birthday and had been a ‘dad’ for almost a year now. He was also grateful that he had made the decision to write to Narcissa that morning last November; a decision that had led him to waking up in a warm bed with Draco draped across him this morning. Harry smiled as Teddy clapped his chubby hands at him. Draco was also wonderful with Teddy, even though he acted very much like a cousin rather than a co-parent, but it was rather early for that, Harry supposed.
Sirius looked amused but stayed silent, and the drive was over before Draco knew it. They all piled out of the car and Draco noticed that Sirius was leaning on his stick even more heavily than before. The walking around the village must have been hard on him.
“The bar's in hell if it means being better than aunt Bella” Draco said and Sirius snorted and gestured for him to sit down.
Narcissa stood up and swept harry into a hug that surprisingly reminded him of Molly. He relaxed into her embrace, glad he had reached out to them for Teddy, now he saw all the love that lived inside Narcissa. She gave Draco a knowing look, and excused herself to the toilet. Once she had gone, Draco opened his mouth. “I was so awful to you. God Harry, I had no idea. I thought you were doted on, that you were worshipped, and you weren’t even fed” Draco sounded horrified. Tears slid down his porcelain cheeks, but he made no move to wipe them away. Harry sat down to him on the sofa and put a hesitant hand on the blond’s shoulder. “you didn’t know. And this can be a lesson to always be kind to people because you never know what they’re going through. A lesson you can teach to Teddy when he’s old enough to understand.” Harry said, gently. He wasn’t sure that he had quite forgive Draco for his past bullying, but he could see that the remorse Draco now felt was real, and that was good enough for Harry. Narcissa swept back in, announcing that they should be heading home. She thanked Harry profusely for the tea, and promised to be in touch regarding both Andromeda and when the two could see Teddy again.
They continued the fake relationship act a little too long, with a little too much intensity, but it was just so nice to kiss someone, and after what must have been over a bottle each of champagne, Harry awoke the next morning to Luna in his bed, very scantily clad. Oh shit.
Draco could have kicked himself, of course. England was full of universities, of course there would be one close by, should he wish to go.
“Christ, Draco. It's mid-November and you’re only in a t-shirt. Here" was all Draco heard Harry say before Draco was leant against the wall on the other side of him. He drunkenly protested at the loss of Harry’s warmth, and well, Harry, but then something big and soft and warm was being wrestled over his head, and through the drunken haze Draco realised that Harry was dressing Draco in his hoodie.
Harry sent up a silent prayer to all the gods out there for the strength that allowed him to keep the boy on his shoulder without his body flagging. He heard a door open and close, and risked peeking out of the cupboard door. The adrenaline was fading now, and in its absence, dark memories of another cupboard began to flood his mind, overwhelming him.
in this Draco describes his asexuality as making him 'not normal'. i don't believe this at all, but in my mind that's how his character views it, not what i actually think. asexuality is completely normal, so please don't listen to people who say otherwise.
I made it as gentle as I could, and he nodded gracefully, and said “of course”, before turning round and we walked back to our flat in silence.
“S’alright” Harry said, steadying Draco with a broad hand to the shoulder. The warmth of Harry’s hand soaked through to Draco’s skin and he nearly melted. God, his school-boy crush was really getting pathetic.
They made their way down the stairs and Harry could hear Ron’s loud laugh followed by a “you’re not so bad, Zabini. I see why Harry likes you”
They had a vast quantity of chickens, for the eggs, who ran around freely, though many of them stayed around where the farmhouse was.
“sleep” Potter whispered back, before turning Draco round and wrapping an arm around his middle. When Draco woke up, the arm was still there, Potter’s gentle breaths soft against the back of his nape, and for the first time since fifth year, Draco was looking forward to the day ahead.
“where is that sound coming from, Harry? Its oozing out of the walls.” Asked Draco, already slightly slurring after only two glasses
She kept glancing through the living room window that faced the farm house, and after an hour she heaved a deep sigh.
“Draco! There's a good lad. Sure, you must be Ginny, it’s the hair you see. And Luna, I met you at the ball. That means you’re Hermione. Every bit as lovely as Ron described” Seamus said, clapping Draco on the back and winking at Hermione.
“it’s Teddy’s bedtime now, but the two of you are welcome to stay for more tea, if you would like.” Harry said, bending to take the infant from Narcissa.
Harry also learnt some of the languages, to prove to Hermione his trip wasn’t lacking education, and arrived on Platform 9 and 3/4 well-rested, well-adjusted, and secure in himself, having experienced pure unadulterated happiness for the first time, to counteract the pure unadulterated loss that walked beside him like a shadow. He was tall, tan and ready to face the year ahead. His hair had grown long, and for the first time in 18 years the wrinkles on his face came from laughter, not worry.
Her and Potter had been having, well not quite an argument but definitely what my mother would describe as a ‘heated discussion’. I couldn’t quite hear what they were saying but it got more intense until Hermione stepped back, tears in her eyes and walked off, sniffing as Potter yelled behind her “’mione, no, I didn’t mean- I didn’t, shit ‘mione I’m sorry!”
I immediately feel guilty when Harry’s face falls though, and he looks so dejected, like a kicked puppy.
“Reet. reet, so this isn't pity this is me making up for my behaviour, and trying to start over. And also because Sirius, Remus and Hermione all told me to get me ‘ead out me arse” Harry said, laughing uncomfortably.
“So, you wanna talk? Or distraction?” Harry says, looking at the ceiling and Draco marvels at how considerate he is, how empathetic.
Suddenly, two staircases appeared, and flowed up to a second level of the common room, like a wrap-around indoor balcony, with doors lining the walls. Harry checked the clock and saw it was 9, like McGonagall said. He summoned his Gryffindor bravery and was the first to walk up the stairs, Ron quick to follow, ready to unpack and settle into his room so he could go straight back to whispering sweet nothings into Hermione’s ear.
Draco groaned again, unable to voice how embarrassed and still sick he felt. Harry laughed again; a belly laugh that made Draco feel warm inside.
“the duke of Edinburgh, or DofE awards are a muggle educational initiative designed as a form of fun learning experience that strengthens university applications. There are three levels, bronze, silver and gold. I assume we would only be doing bronze?” Here McGonagall nodded, and said “and only the expedition” and so Hermione continued. “the bronze level consists of spending six months developing a skill, doing consistent exercise, and volunteering as well as the expedition. the bronze level expedition is a weekend of camping basically, but hiking too. Its designed to help develop skills like teamwork, map reading, navigation and orientation, and so on. In small groups, usually of about six, students must plan a route of a set number of kilometres through the countryside over the course of three days and two nights. This route must pass through specific campsites for the group to sleep at on the two nights. On DofE, the students must carry their tent, sleeping bag and roll mat, as well as all their food and portable camp stoves. At most muggle schools, the bronze level is completed in year ten, with a practice weekend expedition with teacher guidance, and then a second real ‘examination’ weekend with no guidance but regular checkpoints to ensure safety.”
Harry let the song fill him up, and the adrenaline he always felt before a night like this kicked in, and he opened his mouth
They ended up watching clueless, because it was on Draco’s ‘recently watched’ playlist and Harry said “no I LOVE that film!” and so what could Draco do but watch it for the second time that week?
Bryn’s comments had also heavily implied that Harry was gay… or at least not straight. And surely, if he was dating Hermione, he would have said so. Draco tried to suppress the little flip of his stomach when he realised that Harry was attainable to him as a man, and possibly single. He knew Harry would never go for him anyway, so there’s no point in hoping.
Despite the fact that his date was really just his childhood best friend, he was excited. He loves an excuse to properly dress up. he has a host of suits tailored to his exact measurements that fit his body like a hug, and he can never pass up an opportunity to wear one.
The words made a heat start to pool in Draco’s stomach, which only intensified when Harry turned around. His green eyes were stunning without glasses, so much brighter with the (oh my god is that eyeliner) black lining his eyes. His lips were pink and glossed, and his hair glowed with small glints of gold flashing here and there. Draco was speechless, even more so when Dean came barging in, shirt unbuttoned and trousers sinfully tight, and shouted to Harry, “it’s time for the last song my man!”
Unlike most other schools, the dorms weren’t in their own buildings but rather part of other buildings that also had classrooms and staff offices and the like. Draco lived in what was colloquially dubbed ‘humanities house’ because it was where English, History and Economics were taught. There were some common rooms there as well, which was where he was headed now. It was a gorgeous stone building, only a few decades younger than the castle itself, and was officially named after Edward the confessor. It was absolutely huge, with a reception foyer and two wings. One wing held dorms for year twelve, and the other classes. The main part of the house had prefect dorms.
“Of course. Make yourself comfortable” he said, helping her arrange the blankets and pillows before going back to his bed and finally falling asleep.
“of course not love, you wouldn’t be able to fetch me cups of tea if you couldn’t walk” smirked Draco, turning his face to kiss Harry. “Pans wants to do our makeup. We shouldn’t keep her waiting”
God it just makes me feel so shit. I haven’t told Harry this, of course, because then he would simply stop coming to the events and honestly they’re like 40% of his job at this point and in terms of public image and thus public support of the ministry as a whole, Harry Potter the Saviour-Golden-Bastard-Who-Couldnt-Die has to keep making appearances. And so I keep coming with him.
God, he needed to get over himself. He had been at the farm for what, a day? And he was already thinking with his dick. Draco shook himself subtly at the table to clear his head, and reached for the pot to pour himself another mug of tea.
The game started at two, and the time between breakfast and then was spent in a mad dash to get all his homework done, so he could focus on just Harry, both during and after the game. He also changed his outfit, about five times. He finally settled on a pair of Levi’s jeans Pansy had made him buy that he had worn about once, and a t-shirt he had ‘borrowed’ off Blaise about a year ago that Draco liked to think looked artfully oversized. Theo always insisted it just looked baggy, but Draco didn’t want to wear his usual posh clothes- he wanted to make a good impression, and displaying the wealth disparity between him and Harry’s friends hadn’t seemed like the way to go.
“Did you know about this Draco?” she said against Harry’s shoulder. “we were so awful to him and that whole time he was being locked in a fucking cupboard. A cupboard! And he would escape that cupboard just to come to school and face us being absolutely horrible about it”
“my, my.  Wank bank material for weeks right here. It would be months, but Potty dearest is wearing a few too many clothes for my liking” Blaise’s deep voice rumbled through the room.
“of course, mate. Anything. Hermione hasn’t gone back yet, she’ll be round at Sirius’ tomorrow to see you, yeah?”
“are you okay?” asked Potter softly. “if you didn’t like the kiss then we can forget about it, no hard feelings” he continued, and Draco felt his heart lift at the gentleness in his tone.
“you can owl Blaise, or Pansy and invite them over whenever. The room is all set up. They could come tonight if it isn’t too late notice- I can make dinner for us. That being said if you want to see them without me that’s fine and I hang upstairs with Teddy” said Harry as Draco emerged in the kitchen doorway.
I go, of course. Pansy is my best friend, horrible bint that she is, and it wouldn’t do to be the only eighth year not in attendance.
Harry had the decency to look sheepish, and opened his mouth to say something-hopefully an apology- but before he could Hermione stood and turned to Draco.
The answer came after a particularly nasty altercation with Potter after potions one non-descript day. I stormed into the common room, pulled myself up to my full height on that snake carved into the middle of the floor and practically shouted ‘I hereby stake my claim upon Harry James Potter of Gryffindor House’
As he was toeing off his boots in the hallway, he heard Harry’s voice coming from the sitting room where he always found Sirius waiting for him, either reading a book or going over the farm accounts. Sirius was basically the bookkeeper of Potter Hall Farm.
“Oh, no worries. Let me know anytime you need help, and I’m sure I’ll be asking you for help too” Harry said.
Harry nodded, squeezed Draco’s arm and went back to the kitchen. He and Pansy iced the cake when it was ready, and just as they finished, the floo chimed. Harry ushered Pansy into the living room, settling her onto the sofa, where Blaise wrapped an arm around her. He all but shoved his friends into the kitchen, before turning to put on a film for the Slytherins. He chose the jungle book, purely because it was almost two hours long and he needed the time to recover. He cast a muffliato on the kitchen door before collapsing into a chair.
“you vomited a lot more than that mate. I was with you for an hour in that loo. It was an awful pink colour as well.”
“of course you can stay, harry dear. Unfortunately none of the spare rooms are set up. You wouldn’t mind sharing with Draco, would you? The bed is big enough”
Draco waited in the living room for Pansy to emerge from his bedroom, which she had commandeered to get ready in. He was in his levis, and a soft cotton t-shirt his mum had bought him about a year ago. At Pansy’s behest, he had kept his hair in the braid she had put it in, and he tugged on the end as he waited for her.
“alouette, gentile alouette, alouette gentile alouette” she sang in a low, soft voice, slowly rocking the baby in her arms.
“Harry” Draco replied, nodding. His brain was too busy analysing the previous conversation to produce anything more conversationally sophisticated.
“Anyway, your mate passed out in our bathroom, so I had to carry him, and Diggory had started with us and was working his way up, so I had to carry your mate up, racing ahead of Diggory as he went into the other rooms. I even had to hide in the maintenance cupboard” Harry said, laughing so hard his eyes crinkled.
The black girl sniffed and nodded. She then closed her eyes and waved her wand and Harry’s bed magically expanded to fit three. Harry gave her a t shirt and she went into the bathroom, the sounds of her sobs muffled by the sound of running water.
Harry was hyperventilating now, his eyes closed. He felt Ron’s strong arms grip his shoulders and he heard his best mates deep, commanding voice telling him to breathe, and to calm down. He felt Hermione’s perfume envelope him as she put a soothing hand on his shoulder, and he finally began to relax, cocooned with the two people he trusted the most in this world.
She kept her smile to herself, aware that her apparent stoic demeanour was an anchor for them all. Once they had all gathered- one group of six and two groups of seven, she called one member of each team forward. Once this was sorted, she surveyed the group once again, and offered up a final prayer that this would work.
Members of last year’s team would have mocked Draco and Theo mercilessly, then accused them of sodomy, taken their wine and left. That was what Draco was used to. Not this.
“Is that him?” Pansy whispered in Draco’s ear. Draco grinned and nodded as he walked over to open the door for Harry.
He took a deep breath, and reminded himself that from now until November he was at these people’s mercy. Summoning all the good manners beaten into him as a child he nodded and said
The two of them sat on the sofa entirely absorbed in each other for hours. Pansy told him about how she had spent her first part of a-level summer, which included a lot of lazing about the house and a girls trip to Cornwall with some of her friends from school.
Harry carried on in the same fashion, and Draco found himself actually understanding. It killed him to admit it, but Harry was not only better than him at French, but also an excellent teacher.
Teddy then began to get fussy, so they apparated home so he could have his nap. The afternoon, and the rest of their days together that week passed in amicable monotony. Harry had decided that Draco’s first day had overwhelmed him somewhat, so the other days that week were spent playing in the garden, watching muggle cartoons, and some disastrous baking attempts on Draco’s behalf. Sunday rolled around, and to his astonishment, Andy arrived arm in arm with Narcissa for their tea and cake. No Draco though. Perhaps this was to become an old ladies’ affair, thought Harry, amused. Molly would be next. “Harry, I hope you don’t mind that I bought Cissa, there is always more than enough food.” Said Andy, scooping Teddy up and placing a smacking kiss on his cheek. “of course not. Its orange polenta cake today” said Harry, getting plates out. He then took some photos of the two women holding a smiling, dribbling Teddy before trying to feed him his dinner, without much luck. The three talked, chatting. Harry told them about his and Draco’s shopping excursion, and they told him about their childhood in that very house. Harry loved it. He felt a bit like an old woman himself, given that all his time was spent baking and staying at home with a baby, but something about the feeling made him feel safe. Soft embers glowed in his heart as he was accepted into the fold of easy, relaxed adulthood. “you’re terribly mature for your age, Harry. And I don’t just mean the war. Draco seems aged by the war but he’s still a teenage boy. He fusses over his clothes and hair. He reads awful action novels, he protests when I ask him to do the housework but you’re more, wise than that, I guess I would say” said Narcissa, somehow voicing his inner monologue. He smiled. He was glad he wasn’t the quick-tempered boy he had been, yet he was unsure how he had changed so much in less than a year, and Narcissa was right. It was more than the war. Perhaps it was the scale of loss, harry thought. He had come to appreciate the more important things in life at a younger age because he had lost so many of them.
“Bathroom’s easy t’understand. It’s only a shower though so if you’re ever wanting a bath you come up to the house alright? It’s usually just us, but people drop in and out all t’time. Alright?”
Sirius continued to look distracted, likely by thoughts of Harry’s behaviour, and barely looked up when Draco excused himself to return to his little cottage. He was slowly but surely making his way through every book on the bookshelf, and spent a lot of time either sitting on the little stoop at the front, laying on the lawn, curled up on the sofa or sitting on his windowsill in his bedroom reading. He fell into the books for hours at a time in the afternoon, using the escapism to distract from aching muscles and homesickness, and this afternoon he needed it to distract himself from missing Pansy.
“thank god you’re here Malfoy, took you long enough! I am aching for a piss but I didn’t feel I could ask Luna” at Draco’s furrowed brow, Harry explained, “I can’t walk without help because of the hole in my side, so I need you to help me get there- I can piss independently, though, don’t worry” Harry grinned up at the blond impishly, hair braided back like a schoolgirl.
After long agonising hours, they get to take Teddy home again. Harry refused to leave his nursery, and Draco came back from making a cup of tea to see Harry had fallen asleep in the armchair, as he had a penchant for doing. Draco worried for the state of his neck and transfigured a bed, before bending down to take Harry under the shoulders and drag him over to the bed. He eased him between the covers, and stood to go, but a warm, dark hand shot out to hold his wrist, then tugged, pulling him onto the bed. Draco sighed, easing off his shoes and slipping between the covers next to Harry, who had already fallen back to sleep. Draco sat up and sipped his tea, entranced by how vulnerable Harry’s face looked in sleep.
Draco walked in, head stuck in the Iliad for the hundredth time, but he looked up when he heard the words Harry was singing, ‘I wanna feel all your ass in Hawai’I, I want that jet lag from fucking and flying, shoot a child in your mouth while I’m riding’
“Oh my god??” she said, looking at Draco with wide eyes and gesturing into the doorway Harry just disappeared through.
“Oh, yea that was to make my ex leave me alone, the champagne just… accelerated it a bit, I guess. Was a bit of fun but we’re definitely only friends” Harry said, and Draco had to physically stop himself sighing in relief.
She had thick rimmed glasses on, and Draco found her strikingly pretty. She threw her arms around Sirius's neck, and then immediately started talking a mile a minute about her school studies as she waved goodbye to her parents and got into the car.
Draco asks Harry to meet again that week. Harry cannot wait to go to Draco’s house. After the cupboard at the Dursley’s, he thought Sirius’ townhouse was big, but it was a cottage in comparison to where Draco lives. Harry desperately wants to explore it.
Harry turned to the mirror, where he stood in the suit Luna had sent him, that had arrived mere hours before the ball. By some miracle, it fit him perfectly, except it was blue? Green? Turquoise? Teal? He wasn’t sure. It sort of shimmered in the light as he turned, the colours changing and shifting with his movement.  If he was feeling particularly poetic, he would say the suit was almost an exact representation of being underwater, with the silken material and deep rich colours.
The longer she took, the longer Harry sat panicking at the kitchen table. He sent a Patronus to Molly to let her know that ‘something came up’ and asking her to keep Teddy a bit longer. After an hour, he couldn’t bear the silence or the stillness, and he forced himself to get up and start doing something, just to flood out the screaming silence inside his head. Of all the emotional turmoil Harry has been subjected to- and he had had more than his fair share- he had never experienced anything like this.
“so you went from being a worthless person to being a Good Person. But when you were a child, you know you did nothing that merited you being worthless, yes? Your actions did not make you worthless, and you understand that as such, your relatives should not have called you this?”
According to muggles, he had an anxiety disorder, which manifested in his brain forcing him to follow certain rules in order to stay safe, after the two years of feeling completely and utterly not safe everywhere he was. He sighed; he had no choice after all. He selected a pair of relatively thin tracksuit trousers, alongside a thin black long-sleeve t-shirt. All too soon he was making his way down to the Great Hall, Pansy’s hand clutched in his, sensing his discomfort.
As expected, Harry had not slept well, but pleasantly he found himself on a sofa in the common room at about 5 am, with Luna’s head in his lap as she dozed and a fragrant cup of tea warming his hands and heart. “sing to me, Harry?” came Luna’s lilting voice, floating up to him in his daydream world. He stroked her hair as he racked his brains for the first line of what he knew was Luna’s favourite. “boys working on empty, is that the kind of way to face the burning heat?”  he began, voice a bit croaky from not being used much that morning, but Luna hummed with happiness, so he continued. “cause my baby’s sweet as can be, she gives me toothaches just from kissing me.” His voice grew stronger now, “when my time comes around, lay me gently in the cold dark earth, no grave could hold my body down, I’ll crawl home to her”
It ends with Hermione crying as Ron is on one knee in our living room, the ring that Potter and I helped pick glittering in a maroon velvet box. She nods, too moved for words and Ron scoops her up and whirls her round and in that moment I look at Potter, and he looks at me and I know we’re thinking the same thing.
Harry’s arms tightened around Draco and he shifted so his head was above Draco’s, Draco’s face buried in his neck. Draco had never felt so warm and safe.
That Friday, Draco was lying in bed re-reading his beloved Wilde when he felt the bed dip next to him.
Sirius announced their presence and Harry’s face stretched into a grin as he yelled “Hermione!” and leapt up, hugging her with so much enthusiasm he lifted her off the floor. She laughed and hugged him back with as much force, before he set her down and got out three bowls, before sitting back down and pulling her down next to him.
He liked both of the girls. They were sweet, kind and intelligent. Luna had seemed a bit weird, but her matching outfit with Harry was stunning, and so Draco assumed her ditsyness was because she was artsy. He couldn’t help but be jealous.
“Hey. Do you mind if I actually sleep on the edge? I might panic if I wake up in an unfamiliar bed and there’s no easy way out, sorry” Harry said with a sheepish smile. Draco nodded and went to get out of bed but Harry just rolled over him. Not to be pathetic, but Draco thought he could have died in that moment. Harry then snuggled under the covers like a child and it was just so endearing, Draco thought he might combust.
There was an immense change in Potter after that. He was more considerate, and made more of an effort with everyone, even me. We struck up a friendship of some sorts, mainly because I was the only one he could rely on to tell him when he was slipping back into old habits. Now, we are in our second year of ‘university’ as he calls it. We are each doing our masteries. I am studying to become a Healer, and Potter is training to teach, which is a new course brought in after the continued failure of Hogwarts to hire competent DADA professors. The school is a wizarding district in and of itself, by the Southbank, and I love it here.
“I’ll help, yeah? If you want to tell her today, I can stay until you’ve told her, or I can help you draft a letter? Anything you want”
“He’s very protective of his little family, you know? And no offence but we all know what Sirius’ family are like. I hope this doesn’t offend you but we had a month's worth of weekly dinners where the conversation was dominated by whether he was actually going to let you stay here or not” she said, and Draco stiffened somewhat.
Draco was shocked and a little jealous that he capitulated, and tried to focus on soaping himself in the silence that ensued. Luckily for his fragile ego, the shower water covered up any sounds they may have made, and quickly enough to make Draco feel a little better, he heard Harry’s voice.
By noon, Pansy and Blaise stumbled into the kitchen and tore ravenously into the muffins from a few days before, and the four of them drank enough tea to water a garden whilst Teddy crawled around on the floor, drooling over their sock-clad feet. Once she’d finished, Pansy scooped him into her lap and it warmed Harry’s heart to see her interact with him so lovingly. He and Teddy may come from the same parentless place, but Teddy would never grow up wondering what love felt like.
Draco falls asleep there, his mother’s voice enveloping him, her hand soft and gentle in his hair. Maybe, just maybe, he thinks as his eyes close, it might turn out alright.
“no, Ron it’s okay. I need you to do something for me. Can you tell Draco? Explain it all to him. He needs to know, but I cant- I cant say it. I just cant. Tell him all of it, yeah? Even what you didn’t tell Hermione. You can explain the rest to Hermione now as well.”
“Yeah, thanks Ron.” Said Harry, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders that he wasn’t even aware had been there.
“I’ll do the washing up” Draco said, desperate to prove he wasn't entirely useless. Harry and Sirius merely glanced at him, but Remus nodded and smiled at him, and Draco felt a little bit of warmth in his chest. Remus’ subtle kindness was a sort Draco was wholly unused to, but it was a nice feeling.
“right. I’ll put Ted to sleep and then we’ll eat?” Harry said, standing up. “Coming, Pansy?” he asked over his shoulder to her.
He said as much, announced it into the stale air of the kitchen. Harry and Hermione both turned wide eyes on him. Hermione immediately started protesting.
The attractive older man from Harry’s Instagram stepped out, and Harry launched himself at him. The two went staggering back against the car, Harry's arms tight around the older man’s neck. Draco felt a surge of melancholy that he had never had a relationship like that with his father, but then remembered that Harry's actual father was dead, and he felt awful. Ron was then hugging the man too, and they were both loading their suitcases into the back of the car.
“Sorry! I’m so sorry I’m late” he pants, standing in the doorway, looking around with an air of apprehension.
“no, but I knew Hermione had been up to something last night. She must have had a tip off from Lavender, who works as the Prophets magical creature liaison” he says, before kissing me much like he did the first time, close mouthed and sweet.
Draco sat down near the middle, and was immediately flanked by Pansy and Hermione. Judging from Hermione’s overly effervescent demeanour and the disapproving looks she kept giving Harry, Draco assumed that Harry had told her of their conversation and she was trying to prove that she had liked Draco all along. Which, to be fair, she had.
The evening progressed in much the same fashion. Harry and Blaise stayed somewhat sober while Pansy and Draco got steadily more hammered. Pansy drunkenly delighted in making as many lewd comments about Harry as he possibly could, while Draco turned a deep shade of tomato red and kept telling her to ‘fuck off’ with increasingly slurred words.
She strokes his hair and starts to sing the song she used to sing when he was a young boy. Her high, soft voice brings back memories of him and her walking hand in hand through the gardens, swimming in the sea in France, making cupcakes together.
“what the fuck, no. I don’t care who you sleep with Draco. I care when you bring strangers around Teddy” Harry was yelling now, seething.
“Right. We need to get you two ladies out of here” Harry said, unwilling to think about Hermione’s declaration until he at least had some food in his body.
Sirius and Remus then descended into conversation between the two of them so Draco excused himself and found Hermione and Harry sitting in silence in the kitchen. It was so at odds to the first time Draco had seen them interact, when Harry had lifted Hermione off the floor with the force of his hug. Draco hated that he was the reason for this.
The next thing to bring him out of his book was a light knock on his door. Looking out the window, he saw the light had dimmed considerably as the day bled into evening and he assumed it was Harry calling him for dinner, but instead it was Hermione. She was in a long, hippie-like skirt and baggy sweatshirt, holding a backpack.
Harry was also always ruffling Draco’s hair, or patting him on the shoulder if they passed in the common room, usually followed by a wink and a dazzling grin. It was killing Draco. Every time he saw Harry, he was desperately waiting for a nickname (pet name, his mind treacherously called them), a touch, a wink, and then after it had happened Draco could focus on little else.
He awoke with his head at an odd angle, not quite lying flat. He opened his to see Draco above him. Clearly whilst he had been asleep, Draco had come down, and was now sitting on the sofa with Harry’s head on his lap. Harry shifted so he was more comfortable, made sure Teddy was still asleep, and then fell back to sleep himself. Despite how scared he was to face Pansy and Blaise that morning, Draco’s hand in his hair made him feel at peace. Soon enough, Teddy woke up and started fussing for his breakfast. Draco rose, and took the baby into the kitchen, letting Harry sleep. Harry protested but ultimately was happy to take the extra time off.
Draco’s voice came from uncomfortably close, and harry realised he was stood, gaping on the threshold, and he walked in, sitting on one of the armchairs that faced the sofa on which Narcissa sat. Draco sat next to his mother, and reached out to hold one of Teddy’s tiny hands, smiling softly.
The pain in Pansy’s voice made Harry tighten his arms around her. He felt uncomfortable when people expressed such sadness on his behalf. He remembers feeling sick when Hermione had cried in third year when he had explained the full extent of the Dursley’s abuse to her. He never knew how to react. This was worse, because Pansy felt guilty. Guilt was a complicated emotion to grapple with, especially when it was valid, and Pansy was right, they had acted in a downright appalling manner in the younger years at Hogwarts. He stared helplessly at Draco, unsure of how to proceed. Draco approaches wearily and crouches down by Pansy.
“I can’t, I mean not after, I mean it pales in comparison” Draco started, but Harry cut him off, sounding commanding even with his voice sounding tinny through the phone speaker.
There are times when I love Harry, and times when I hate him. This is one of the latter. It’s the ministry Beltane Ball and as Head Auror Harry has to be there. And of course, as it has been for the last five years, wherever Harry goes, I go.
They found seats right at the front, and Draco sat in between Hermione and Luna. Hermione immediately pulled out a book, something about a Chinese Empress, and Luna chatted his ear off about her wild assortment of pets, many of which he suspected to be bordering on illegal, but the stories are terribly entertaining. Draco found that in spite of himself, he was having fun. He had thought he would feel bitter jealousy towards Luna, but he could see how clearly, she didn’t see Harry in any way other than platonic, and after she had exhausted her pet stories, she moved on to fawning over a girl she had a crush on. Draco didn’t miss the looks she kept sneaking at Ginny, and resolved to ask Harry and Ron about it when he could.
I can’t bear to face him, but I feel as though I have no choice, and so I get up, wipe my face and wrench my door open and I spit “what, over me already, Potter” with all the venom I can muster.
“fine, so long as its muggle. Let me get dressed.” Harry acquiesced, heading up to his room. Dean was waiting outside, and whispered to Harry as he entered, “I’ll find a gay club for us, so get ready properly’. Harry smirked at the meaning behind his words, and went in to shower. Dean had recently come out to Harry as gay, after a drunken fumbled experience with a Hufflepuff he refused to give the name of at the welcome party the eighth years had thrown one week into term in the interests of ‘house unity’ (read: house mass consumption of firewhiskey). Harry had rubbed Dean’s back as he had thrown up, and let him stay in his room with Draco because Harry was just gone enough that he too couldn’t quite remember which room was Deans. In the dark of the night, he heard dean groan and say “Harry, I think I’m, fuck, gay”. Harry had patted his head and promised not to tell anyone.
“I’d hoped I’d like you” Sirius said, face shining with mirth as he walked into the kitchen, Draco on his heels.
Luna floated over, dress floating around her legs like a cloud. “they’re not coming, you know. Voldemort Killed Harry’s parents 18 years ago today.” He hated how the harsh words sounded in her soft cadence, and he hated himself for forgetting. He was supposed to be Harry’s friend. Harry was always there to pull him out of a nightmare, to defend him when people remembered his initial role in the war, and yet he was sat here, having fun while Harry was suffering what must be the worst day of the year. He stands up on wobbly legs, and determinedly makes his way up to his room. Harry’s name dies on his lips when he enters and he sees the broad, muscled body of Ron curled possessively around Harry, and Harry’s body curled around Hermione’s in turn. His body turns to lead. How could he ever think he could help Harry at a time like this, when he followed the man that caused all of Harry’s pain. How could he ever even think of Harry as a friend, when he was so unworthy of the kind of friendship Harry offered. He cast a silencing charm on himself, grabbed the bottle from his bed and stumbled unnoticed into the bathroom, before he climbed into the bath, prepared to drink himself into oblivion.
Harry ate quickly and left, grunting something about seeing to his pigs, leaving the kitchen faster than Draco had ever seen him.
“she’s not my girlfriend Draco. She’s from Trinidad and that’s how they dance there to that kind of music.” Harry explained, before transfiguring his toothbrush into a glass and filling it with an ‘aguamenti’ and handing it to Draco.
“Draco, my sweet. I was hesitant to tell you over the phone but there have been some changes to do with your father and I. no divorce, of course. At least not until your grandparents die. They'd have a heart attack. But I did confront Lucius, and so we came to an agreement. He has moved to the coastal residence, and has left myself, and you, by extension, with the Wiltshire property. We will still holiday in France as a family, and come together at events such as Christmas, easter, birthday’s, soirees, the like. But for all intents and purposes, we are free of him for the most part.”
“I’m sorry Blaise put you in the middle of this. I wish I knew how to fix it, but this doesn’t come up in my reading” Hermione jokes, offering up a small half-smile to Harry, before shuffling closer to him on the sofa and curling into his side. He knows that she cannot offer a solution and so she is offering what she can- comfort. The presence of a warm body and a good friend to make him feel better. He hadn’t realised that he needed it.
Here, Pansy trailed off, and Harry squeezed her hand reassuringly. After a few moments, she carried on.
“of course I do, Draco” Harry whispered back, even though it was all too early and entirely the wrong time and he didn’t want Draco to feel trapped with him.
“Vernon has cancer. It’s not- it doesn’t look good. He's not gone yet, but he will, and soon. The council demanded you be invited to the funeral, whenever that may be, and so I am here to extend that invitation and make you aware of his circumstances.”
“I’m just glad it’s a fate you avoided. Narcissa was always on the nicer side. Nowhere near Andi, of course but… better than Bella at any rate”
“We’re adults, Sirius” Harry said exasperatedly, rolling his eyes at Draco as if it were an inside joke between them, and Draco felt his cheeks heat.
“Have you considered applying to the University of York? It’s not very far away from here. If you wanted, you could come back most weekends and for holidays.”
After about thirty minutes more dozing, he got up to go back to the kitchen and stopped in the doorway, taking in the heart-warming sight before him. Draco’s face was lit up with laughter, whilst Teddy’s face was covered in strawberry-banana mush as his tiny hand kept missing his mouth with the small pieces of fruit. He grinned, and realised that maybe, just maybe, he liked Draco a little more than he had expected to. The blond looked gorgeous in the early December sun, in one of Harry’s hoodies and a pair of soft cotton pyjama bottoms.
Harry’s face had dropped a little at the mention of his family, but some of the light crept back into his eyes at Draco's somewhat weak assertion that he wasn't like them. Draco remembered Sirius saying Harry probably saw Draco as the same as the other Blacks, and hoped that this conversation would help in changing that belief.
Draco didn’t know what to do with this. Harry kept laying himself bare to Draco. First the story about his childhood and now this. Draco didn’t know how to cope with this kind of a relationship; he had never had a friend like this before. He coughed, and ended up saying “she can’t have been good if she didn’t want to look after Teddy” he said, realising how true he felt it to be as the words left his mouth. Harry looked surprised, but then a massive grin split his face, “you are exactly right Draco, but I also can’t blame her. She wanted to live her life, but to me right now Teddy is my life and I love it. It’s like I said before. My life before the war was defeating Voldemort. After the final battle, while everyone else’s lives could begin, with no threats to impede them, mine felt like it was over. Dark lord vanquished; prophesy fulfilled blah blah blah. I didn’t know what to do with myself, but Teddy became my purpose, and I love it.” Draco was astonished at this admission, having never thought about it but he supposed it to be true. Harry’s life had ended during that battle, in more ways than one. Their food arrived, and Draco was pleasantly surprised to see that he really enjoyed what Harry had chosen for him.
“I think I'm asexual. Actually, I know I'm asexual” he said, feeling proud of himself. Feeling brave.
“Well, everything seems in order here. Good to know we’ll be practically living together, Harry. I’ll see you around” Cedric said, giving Harry a lascivious smile before leaving.
“You’re doing the right thing, you know? And Harry just keeps lashing out at everyone now, so whilst I know it's hard you need to try and not take it personally. I heard Remus go in to talk to him, which hopefully will knock some sense into him” Draco said, reaching for his own tea, and passing Hermione the biscuits.
“that’s because I love her. Maybe you’ve not been spending enough time with Hermione” Harry replied and Draco’s brain short circuited. This entire situation had been like a rollercoaster- throwing him for many loops.
Draco’s heart cracked. He had never seen Harry this vulnerable, even when he had seen his limp body lying in Hagrid’s arms during the final battle. He had never felt more grateful for his mother.
Ron piped up from behind Harry. Draco had forgotten he was even there. He had been too busy falling in love. Harry could recite Shakespeare. He was basically Draco’s dream man.
“Right, Harry this is Draco. You’ll show him where he’s staying before Ron comes, and I’ll pack youse some sandwiches for t'night” Remus said, and Harry nodded, getting up and hefting Draco’s duffle bag into his shoulder before gesturing at Draco to leave the kitchen.
“I hope you don’t mind dinner is quite simple, I spent most of this morning setting up the spare room” Harry said, placing the bowls of pasta in front of the three Slytherins seated around his kitchen table. “he did it the muggle way” explained Draco. Pansy bared her teeth again and said “I see now where those muscles come from, Dray dearest why didn’t you tell me how handsome our lovely saviour is now” she said, before turning back to Harry “peacetime suits you” she winked.
He checked his phone then yelled “shit, Ron! Hermione’s train gets into the village in like ten minutes, we gotta run. Sorry, Draco! I’ll see you around yea?” Harry grinned at him, before tugging on some beat up air forces, throwing a book at Ron to get him out of bed, and started putting things like a wallet and a portable charger in his pockets.
“Right, I think we should do a film analysis. It’s about French culture, right? And cinema is their septieme art, so I think film is a good idea, and then we can talk about its cultural significance.”
Draco is shocked for what feels like the seventh time that day when Harry reaches out to him, and pulls him onto the sofa next to Hermione. Draco sits stiffly, but feels warmth flood him when Hermione lays her bushy-haired head on his shoulder.
After quite a few of his mixed drinks, which by 8 had gone from 60% vodka and 40% lemonade to 80% vodka and 20% lemonade, Draco was relying quite heavily on Harry to keep him upright. He hadn’t been with Harry for the whole evening- at some point early on Harry had disappeared. Draco had caught a glimpse of him hugging Ginny tightly, after which Ginny whispered in his ear and kissed him on the cheek (it was at this point that the % quantity of vodka in his cup began to increase)
“There’s nowt up there for you” came a deep voice from behind him. Draco turned, bewildered because if he wasn’t in the house where was he to sleep? His confusion must have shown on his face because Harry let out a huff of laughter and opened the front door.
Harry saw Hermione’s inquiring glare and so returned to his native tongue. “I travelled Europe before coming here, I wanted a small taste of the youth Voldemort had taken from me before my adulthood began.” He explained.
“He’s come t’see Sirius, and do gap year shit, I don’t really ken, Gin, nor do I really care, so why do you? He seems a decent enough lad lets just leave it at that”
“it’s my godson’s. I just moved here, and my proper one got lost in all the boxes. I’m Harry, what’s your name?”
“I don’t- I don’t think I feel that comfortable wearing this outside” said Draco, looking at the floor and wringing his hands in worry, as if he would disappoint Harry by setting boundaries. Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s hips and said “then just wear them for me, just in here” before leaning in for another kiss, showing Draco that Harry would do whatever made Draco most comfortable.
Harry had worried that him coming out as bisexual would change things, but there was month after year eleven where Harry stayed with Ron and his family as the custody proceedings were settled, and Harry didn’t belong to the Dursley’s but didn’t quite belong to Sirius either, and so he stayed with the Weasley’s in the interim. Harry was overwhelmed by dreams that told him that Sirius’ acquittal hadn’t happened, and he wasn’t actually free and safe, but he was still stuck with the Dursley’s, and he woke up soaked in sweat and tears and shaking uncontrollably, like a lamb in a storm. One night, Ron woke up for some water and saw Harry sat up in bed, crying with whole body sobs violent enough to shake the bed beneath him, and Ron had just lifted the corner of the duvet, and when Harry choked out “I thought you wouldn’t want to” Ron had just scoffed and said “don’t be an idiot, Harry. We’re brothers, remember?”
“it’s not like I have anywhere else to go” shouts Draco back, his defensiveness a sharp contrast to his silence the past few weeks. “I’m not going to be celibate like you. Unlike you, people actually want to fuck me. People actually like me” he’s not sure why he says this. He knows Harry is loved more than Draco will ever be, but Draco relies on his pull nights to feel some semblance of self-worth and validation, and he cannot bear the thought of that being taken away.
“Alright Draco” Harry nodded to him as he passed. Draco hadn’t exactly been… forthcoming with friendship so far, but Harry didn’t want to jump the gun and ignore him completely.
After a lot of tea, cake, and kissing Teddy goodbye, Harry floo’d to Dean and Seamus’ flat in Hogsmeade. He was greeted by the sight of Dean’s bare arse and Seamus lying blissed out on the sofa.
“And Sirius, see he gets so bad about his family, you know? What they did to him. What your people did to ‘im, and I didn’t want you coming anywhere near ‘im. And god, when you and him started becoming all friendly like? I hated it. He’s mine, you know? He’s my fake dad, not yours. And you’ve got parents. It felt like you were taking ‘im away from me.”
Hermione stood and sniffed when Draco got to the front door of his cottage. “Keys are front pocket” he said and Hermione stuck her fingers in and pulled them out, opening the door for them. She flopped onto the sofa and Draco handed her a cup of tea, setting his down on the little lamp table next to the sofa alongside the biscuits.
The meal finished quickly after that, with Draco offering to stay and clean up. Sirius shot him a grateful smile, and patted Draco on the shoulder as he passed in his haste to leave the room. Harry had run off the minute Effie’s plate was finished and it was polite to do so. Draco assumed Sirius was off to find him.
Given that Harry cared far more about being comfortable than he did about adhering to fashion trends, he almost exclusively wore running shorts and trackies and hoodies and the like, so he was all set. The others were a different story all together. It had been a long night of Hermione shouting and the Gryffindor boys being generally useless. Harry had never been so grateful to see her leave a room.
The night passed in much the same fashion, with the addition of more of the heavenly spiced cider, many bottles of wine and lots and lots of Molly’s cake. Draco had an amazing time, despite the fact that he only truly knew one person in attendance, but given that Hermione, the adults and most of the older Weasley brothers had gone out of their way to make him feel welcome, the party didn't feel disjointed or strange to him.
“Aye, that he is,” Harry sighed. “He tried t’kiss me last summer and I was just drunk enough that I let him for about a minute before pushing him off, and since then he won’t leave me alone.”
His mum gave him a t-shirt that his aunt Andromeda had left, which was her husbands, and so should fit Harry. Harry was delighted with it, and then proceeded to strip to his underwear in the middle of Draco’s room, hanging his clothes on the back of Draco’s desk chair. The domesticity made Draco yearn
Determined to return the favour, Draco bound up a copy of perhaps his favourite modern book, ‘Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe’. It was his own copy, with his own annotations and highlights throughout. After sending it to the Burrow with his owl and a note that read “as you have given me your music, let me give you my literature. Enjoy, D.M” Draco suddenly panicked that it was too personal a gift to give someone so soon into such a tentative friendship, but alas it was too late.
“I hate to impose, but would perhaps Pansy or Blaise be able to utilise your spare room at some point?” Draco tried to sound as polite as humanly possible. Harry looked up in confusion “there is no spare room set up Draco. I can do it this week though.” He said
Harry opened the door to Draco, standing there looking weirdly nervous. These past few weeks, Harry has also delighted and being flirtatious with Draco, watching the blond blush and stammer every time.
Dinner conversation started off easy; talking about the farm and plans for the upcoming summer. At a natural lull in the conversation the old woman, Effie Draco thought Remus had called her, turned to Harry and pinched his cheek and said “look at how big you’ve gotten James!”
“it’s a French muggle song about a bird” said Draco behind him. “she used to sing it to me when I was a baby”
There were some girls dotted around the dining hall, looking surprisingly pristine after a night of drinking, and one couple in the corner was necking already.
Harry frowned, before getting up and settling Teddy into a strange baby-swing contraption that he had found at a muggle store. He then floo called Hermione, to see if he could wrangle a meeting with Kinglsey that morning. “for you saviour, anything” she winked, telling him to get changed and floo through in fifteen minutes. Twenty minutes later, he found himself sat in Kingsley’s office, Teddy on his lap, desperately trying to explain why Draco is moving in with him without seeming crazy. Kingsley understood, even if the Wizengamot members in attendance were disapproving. Kingsley gave permission before scooping Teddy up and letting the boy play with his robe collar. Harry snapped a photo of his godson in the minister’s office, before thanking Kingsley profusely and rushing home to help Ron and Charlie with the bedroom. He had chosen one for Draco on the floor below Harry and Teddy’s, in the hopes that Draco would be able to sleep through the numerous night-time crying sessions. They cleared the room of dust, before transfiguring an armchair in one corner, and a desk and chair set to be placed under the window. The three men and baby then went down to eat leftover orange polenta cake from Sunday’s tea, and Charlie gave Teddy a small dragon toy he had brought from Romania. It breathed fake fire and kept the infant occupied for hours.
Once the chill had started to seep through Harry’s large hoodie, he scooped Teddy out of the swing, strapped him to his chest and headed home again, hoping that Teddy would go down for his morning nap easily and Harry would be able to snatch some precious extra minutes in bed with Draco. He hums on his way, one hand wrapped protectively around Teddy’s back. He often gets a lot of weird looks as a black man with a white baby, but the streets are still relatively empty at this time, and he isn’t sure anything could dampen his mood today. He arrives back at Grimmauld in high spirits, puts Teddy down with little fuss, and makes another cup of tea before drifting back upstairs and slipping into bed. Like a magnet, Draco immediately rolls over and tucks himself into Harry’s side, one arm and leg flung over Harry’s body. Harry kisses Draco on the top of his head- his hair smells of jasmine and sleep and Harry smiles.
Of course, Harry still spent masses amounts of time with Ron, and Hermione, but now they were together it left him a lot of free time to see Draco.
“finally, as I am head and thus may change whatever I please, I have decided to reduce the prevalence the housing system here at Hogwarts. Students will dine with those in their year, and all class projects will be done with inter-house partnering’s. Finally, as Eighth years, you will be roomed in pairs that cross the houses, and house unity is just as much a goal as achieving your NEWTs.” She smiled now, saying “we have borrowed much from the muggle education system, to ensure that we never see them as ‘lesser’ ever again. As the equivalent of sixth formers, you will be allowed to wear professional and appropriate muggle clothing if you wish. Finally, some of your chosen subjects will also offer the novel adventure of ‘school trips’, which we hope will bring exciting variety to your studies.” Turning, she then ushered everyone in to acquaint themselves with their new home.
Harry finished his rant, closing his eyes and resting his head on the back of the sofa. Draco was momentarily distracted by his jawline, but only momentarily. He was too occupied with their conversation.
It hurt Draco more than he was willing to admit, seeing Potter curled around Granger like that. There was no romance in it, but the tenderness was clear and hard for him to look at. He was also shocked that the Weasel didn’t seem to care that Potter was apparently whispering sweet nothings into his girlfriends-and, if rumours were to be believed, future wife’s- ear. When the sweetness of the moment became too much he ruined the moment by bringing it to the Weasel’s attention, expecting an argument or at least some possessiveness from the Weasel, but all he got was mocking from Granger, and Potter’s stance didn’t really change, until he went off with the Weasel to sort their pathetic excuse for dinner.
“Oh, Draco no of course I want you to. We all want you to. I just thought that you might be put off by whatever went on between you and Harry and Hermione?” Sirius asked, clearly knowing more than he let on, likely told by Hermione herself.
It’s good though. An ex-death eater being in the bosom of the most decorated war heroes keeps me safe, even if it is leeching at my sanity, and Potter and I make an unusually good pair. At least, it was good, for a good year and a half. Fantastic, really, until last week.
He hauled him and his cargo up the next set of stairs, and the realised he didn’t know which of the two rooms was Draco’s. he went to the closest one, and pushed the door open as silently as possible. He saw a body sprawled on a bed, topped with a head of white-blond hair, and knew he had guessed right.
Harry was just admiring himself in the mirror when the doorbell he had had installed specifically for Pansy rang, echoing throughout the house. Harry raced down the stairs to ensure he got to the door before Ron or Hermione. Draco knew not to open the door and disrupt the ritual. Ron was waiting at the bottom of the stairs.
The jealousy in Draco burnt hotter and hotter, the green-eyed monster rearing its ugly head as it unfurled in his stomach. No matter how awful it made him feel, he couldn’t help but stare at Harry’s muscled form in the low light, the way his hips moved so fluidly, the protective way his hands gripped Bianca’s hips as they moved.
“It's nothing. You're the only person under forty who can tolerate my presence so it's the least I can do'' Draco joked, but Hermione detected the underlying dejection.
It was a good night. The drinks were just beer, and no one took it too far. In the privacy of their room, Dean and Seamus were much more couple-y, and it was a heart-warming sight.
It was Wednesday night and Harry was packing all his stuff up. Because Hogwarts was a private school, they got a whole three and a half weeks off for Christmas hols, and Harry was ecstatic. He was shoving all his clothes and books in his suitcase haphazardly, knowing that later he’d have to sit and fold everything to make it fit, when the door knocked.
Potter just shook his head, and when he had unpacked most of Draco’s bag into his own, Draco saw the considerable (and again, impossible) size of Potter’s biceps as he hefted his now-full bag onto his shoulder, before wandering off to where the tents where without a word or even a nod. Draco heaved a sigh. He felt simultaneously worse and so, so much better. The embarrassment of knowing that Potter knew how weak and pathetic Draco really is burned in him, the feeling leaden and nausea-inducing in Draco’s stomach, but the fact that Draco didn’t have to carry what he so clearly was unable to released a surprisingly large weight from his shoulders. As he tried to lift his bag now, he could do it easily.
“That's amazing, love” Remus said, pressing a soft, chaste kiss to Sirius’ lips. “You should invite her here, t’farm. We could have a family dinner; you, and her, and Draco, all the outcast Black’s together.”
“Come on, Draco! You’re a good-looking bloke. Surely there’s been one girl you’ve had your eye on” Harry says, evidently wishing to embarrass Draco more.
“But, Draco, I really, really want you to marry me” he says, and I feel the tears fall. It’s all I can do to nod and he grins, a bright dazzling thing that illuminates the whole room.
“Harry! Ron! We’re having a bit of a lad's drinks in our dorm tonight; it’ll be great craic. Welcome in the new year with style and all that. Bring yourselves along lads, sure it’ll be grand”
“owl your friends. I like cooking and I haven’t practiced real food recently; it’s just been bread and cake. It’s nothing to me, promise, so long as you help lay the table” Harry winked, delighting at how Draco blushed pink- maybe Seamus had a point.
“i don’t want to talk about it I just, I wanted to say I'm sorry if I had done anything to make you feel like you couldn’t tell me, like you had to get Ron to do it because you thought I'd react badly. I never want to make you feel like you can’t tell me things”
It was more information than Draco had expected, and he was grateful for it. He wasn’t sure what to say, though. It felt like navigating a minefield.
“careful mate, she’ll want her own soon” laughed Harry, seeing how excited Hermione was to spend time with Teddy.
“for fucks sake” Draco groaned, banging his head against the table. Teddy screwed his face up, a tell-tale sign that he didn’t like the noise. Harry swooped in, scooping him from Pansy and rocking him against his chest, kissing the child all over his face. Soon Teddy was giggling again, and Harry shifted him, so his godson was perched on his hip.
Hermione was practically dragging Harry and Ron by their hair to see the notice board with the DofE groups.
At nineteen, he was being forced to face the fact that maybe, just maybe, his worldview was wrong. It wasn't a comfortable feeling.
Pansy kissed his cheek and rubbed his back, before looking over her shoulder at Harry, who was dithering in the corner and generally looking quite pathetic.
“of course you do, darling. My taste is impeccable and my knowledge of you comprehensible. Now come on, if I don’t start getting ready soon, we’ll never leave.”
“Er…” he said again, elegantly. “Come in?” was all he could think of. It wasn’t supposed to sound like a question but oh well.
Harry answered the phone looking panicked, and Draco worried that something was wrong, but by the time he hung up, it all seemed okay.
“Draco, remember that day at Hogwarts when I asked you a question and then you told me I wouldn’t like the answer?” I nod, still to hurt to look at him.
On softly padding feet, clearly another victim of a bad night’s sleep, Hermione came to join them, kissing Harry on the cheek and laying her head on his shoulder, happy to be enveloped by his warm voice, “I didn’t care much how long I lived, but I swear I thought I dreamed her, she never asked me once about the wrong I did”
“then you shouldn’t have looked so sexy when you did it” sniffed Dean before padding into the kitchen. The rest followed, and harry set about making a full English- better than any hangover potion, in his opinion.
“Yeah mate, look at that!” exclaimed Ron, bumping Harry’s shoulder as they strode back to their building to shower and dress for dinner. He would have to write to Sirius about it, it would make him happy to know that Harry would be safe here.
I thought Potter liked me, just as much as I liked him, but I guess not. I dropped my bag and practically ran into my room, slamming the door and falling into my bed as the tears start to fall. I feel utterly pathetic, but death and heartbreak in the same day is just too overwhelming and so I let myself cry.
“He knows. He was a student here, too. Not a Rugby boy though, he was much too punk rock for that. He didn’t tell you because he wanted you to come here for yourself, not for anyone else, no matter how important they may be. I thought that now was a good time to tell you, though. He would be so proud of you” she said, her voice wobbling at the end.
Harry awoke to the sound of Teddy crying, and rolled out of bed to run to his godson. In his haste, he forgot about his guests and so was only in his sleeping shorts. He carried Teddy downstairs and fed him his milk and some banana slices for breakfast. After a late night and rude awakening, he was exhausted, and was so focussed on trying to make sure the banana went into Teddy’s mouth and not on the floor he didn’t hear the footsteps behind him.
The night was lovely, and the two groups of friends got along like a house on fire. The club was heaving, and alcohol was flowing freely. Much like the night before, harry noticed that Draco was supremely bad at holding his liquor. At one point, he looked very close to being sick, so harry manhandled him out into the alleyway that served as the smoking area, and not a moment too soon. The minute the fresh air hit Draco he doubled over, one hand bracing himself against the wall and threw up, a lot. Harry propped him up and rubbed his back. A kindly smoker gave Harry a bottle, and after making sure it was definitely water, he held it to Draco’s lips and helped the sweaty, wasted blond take small sips. He knew he should get Draco home, but he didn’t want to leave the others with no explanation. In his drunk state, he could think of no better option than to mutter under his breath “accio Blaise”, immensely grateful for the fact that he was a powerful enough wizard to do so.  A minute later, Blaise stumbled out of the door looking very confused at how he had been magically dragged there. He saw Draco and then Harry and before Harry got a word in said “he always does this. Good thing you were there to get him outside. Take him home, I’ll look after the others.”
Out of sheer laziness, and because he knew teddy liked it, he sent a Patronus summons to Draco instead of walking upstairs to get him.
Thursday morning dawned, and Draco was practically buzzing with excitement to see his mother again, and apprehension about his father.
After what felt like ages, Pansy and Draco emerged. Draco was in black jeans and a sheer mesh black top, his hair artfully mussed. Pansy was a vision. She had obviously changed her mind from the dress she was in before, and this one left just as little to the imagination but it was a stunning glittering purple that went wonderfully with her sleek black bob. She was in black stilettos that looked impossible to walk in. on seeing him stare she winked and said “they’re charmed so they feel just like normal shoes and so that I don’t break my ankles.”
Draco heard mud squelch under the tyres of the Land Rover as the tank of a car crested the hill. All around him were green fields dotted with sheep and horses and cows and the occasional barn. In the shallow valley below him was the heart of a farm.
He had actually refused to apply to any university, yet another grave sin in his father’s eyes. He had called it a gap year to appease his father but he didn’t know if he ever wanted to go to uni. He knew he was young and such a decision should be taken less lightly, but with every week spent on the farm, the idea of Draco claiming the cottage as his own and staying for the next few years- longer, even- got more and more appealing.
i do recommend this film!! i watched it on a school trip and my french teachers laughed at us hating the sex scenes :)
He and Ron waited until the service had started, then slipped into the back of the church, sitting in an empty pew at the very end. He saw Petunia’s head turn at the intrusion, saw her face screw up in anger and bitterness as she beheld them. He saw the tears glinting in her eyes, and tried to remind himself that today she wasn’t his abusive aunt, today she was merely a woman mourning the loss of her husband. He didn’t succeed. He knew she was both, and that the tumultuous emotions of the day would likely make her crueller to him, if she got within spitting distance.
Draco was slowly going feral. Potter refused to stop talking to that infernal snake. The sibilant, guttural sounds made heat pool in Draco’s stomach, and Potter’s incessant stream of chatter with the grass snake now wrapped around his bicep meant that Draco had been in a state of latent arousal since ten in the bloody morning.
“Lovely to meet you my dear” she said as she stepped back, keeping her hands on Draco’s shoulders. “You must be eating more! You are so skinny! Sit, sit please”
Pansy squealed “can I help?” Draco shot her an incendiary glare, but she just winked at him before batting her eyelashes at Harry.
“the very fact that you came here with your mother, instead of staying home, shows that you’ve grown, let alone the fact that you’ve apologised. Your actions in the war are forgiven, and understood, so we don’t need to have that conversation. Thank you for apologising, and accepting the mistakes you made.”
Harry turned to pick his t-shirt up off the floor and heard Pansy whisper “daddy-mode Harry is coming back” to Draco.
“it's nothing, mate. Honestly” Harry said. “we’ll go to lunch, and you just shower in our room, yeah?”
Harry scoffed. “I think the fact that I came dangerously close to fucking Luna last night proves I’m not gay. I’m bi. Will that be an issue?” he said, eyes flashing dangerously.
“of course not. We’re all good. And we definitely got the point across to Cedric. He was staring at us for the rest of the night. especially when we left”  she giggled.
“you’ve grown up nicely, Weasley, but I must say that Granger looks utterly edible in those jeans” she said, slowly raking her gaze over Hermione before taking her arm.
“Breakfast now lad, and a bit of a break for you. Other than the lambs there’s near nowt to do. Everyone’s got ta be fed, ‘course, and Harry’ll probably exercise the horses today but you’re done, I reckon.”
It got even worse when the poor mother of too many children got bent over a table and fucked within an inch of her life in an effort to produce another (illegitimate) child and bring her husband home from the war. Draco choked. He had quite forgotten how explicit the French were- how prudish they considered the English to be. He didn’t know where to look. His eyes darted between Harry and the whiteboard, his palms sweating, and he felt very much like a fourteen-year-old gearing up for his first wank.
“Draco, just because Ron knows more doesn’t mean that you aren't also there for me, or that I don’t massively appreciate what you do for me” Harry said.
Draco stumbled to catch up with him, and squinted ahead to see where they might be going, but was fruitless in his endeavours. They tramped across damp grass for about five minutes until the torch alighted upon a tiny cottage that looked to be about two rooms big.
updates won't be daily, but I wanted to post this second chapter just to get the story going a little bit
“I’m going to have to carry Pansy so he’s all yours” said Blaise as he attempted to help Pansy stand. Harry rolled his eyes before bending down and picking Draco up bridal style. Blaise gave up with Pansy and did the same, and the two of them slowly made their way upstairs. Harry directed Blaise to the spare room, before taking Draco to his. He dropped Draco onto the bed and as he was conjuring a glass of water for the blond, he saw Draco trying to undo his shirt buttons, without much success. Harry sighed, and undid Draco’s shirt and slid it off him. He then did Draco’s shoes, socks and trousers, before rolling the underwear-clad boy under the covers, and leaving to check on Teddy.
“our muggle consultants have sent me a list of things to take into account whilst packing, and I believe you would all benefit from listening.” Here, she unrolled a piece of parchment, and cleared her throat. “do not, under any circumstances, wear jeans. There is supposedly a late-summer heatwave this weekend so shorts, and light t-shirts are recommended. Sportswear such as tracksuit trousers, leggings etcetera are recommended. Light rain jackets are required, as well as sturdy hiking boots. Of course, many of you won’t own a single item of clothing on this list, so you have tonight to work on transfiguring your robes into appropriate clothing.”
I have never known real love, Draco. I would never take that away from you, never, ever begrudge you that, not matter who it may be with.” She smiled sadly at him, and Draco felt a tear escape his eye. His mum deserved better. So much better than his bastard of a father.
“Oh, Draco, my sweet. I’m so sorry you had to see that” she says, reaching up to smooth his hair down, giving him a watery smile. He can see tears gathering in the corners of her eyes.
Draco’s mum arrived, laden with cakes from a local bakery, and Sirius led her through to the kitchen, as Harry and Draco stayed in the sitting room.
“Potter, if you could please turn your music down for one minute?” (he cringed internally at this, his attempts at politeness always sounded so alien when directed to anyone his own age) “I have something I was hoping to talk to you about.” Harry scrambled to sit up in bed and waved his hand, shutting off the music completely. He looked up at Draco with eyes that looked more awake, and were filled with an earnestness and attention that Draco felt somewhat undeserving of.
“For god’s sake, Draco. You didn’t know, yeah? It’s fine. And seeing your dad cheat on your mum is a big deal. It’s a massive deal and I’m glad you called me to talk about it, so now talk to me about it”
“book 16?” Draco asked, and Harry nodded mournfully. Then he turned and fiddled with the black box on his bedside table that Draco now knew to be a modified version of a muggle speaker, and soon a deep, strong and melancholy voice filled the space.
I say, standing up and patting him briefly on the shoulder as I pass, his green eyes staring into nothing.
Luna laughed, the sound light and effervescent. “Anything for you, my darling” she replied, shifting a bit but staying on his lap. He lay his head on her shoulder, looking out at the school grounds for a few minutes before he nudged her.
“Coming up to six, I reckon” Ron replied, jumping down from the tractor and grabbing the tin from his hands and jogging up to the farmhouse door.
“Oh yea, we wanted to get ready together. Actually Draco, could you take some photos of us, Ron isn’t wearing that shirt to the actual ball.” Harry asked.
“cool. I can’t talk to Ron about it because even though he accepts me he turns redder than his hair at the mere thought of me having sex” Laughed Harry. He then got off his bed, and walked over to Draco’s, and stuck out his hand, echoing that first day all those years ago. “so, friends?” he asked, spearing Draco with his piercing gaze once again. Draco was speechless, and could only grasp the strong brown hand in front of him, willing strength into his limp hand.
Pansy linked her arm through his as they made their way down the hall, before selecting what Harry called his ‘Slytherin shirt’- the deep green one with the embroidered snakes.
He found Sirius and Harry sitting at the table as he came in and sat down. They smiled at him and wished him a happy birthday, and Sirius shoved a plate of scones and a card at him. The card was from his mother, and he smiled so wide his cheeks ached. He noticed the lack of a card from his father but chose to ignore it.
On the other hand, Vernon died before he got to see Harry succeed despite the abuse. And, even deeper, a chain in the last, biological link to his parents was gone, and Harry felt them slip even further away from him. He felt tears well in his eyes, even though his chest felt empty and cavernous.
They passed a lovely weekend, spending most of it in the formal drawing room with the fire on, and his mother’s Edith Piaf records filling the room with lovely music. Without Lucius, they both revelled in the freedom. Draco hadn't even realised how restrictive and strict his father had been until Draco could eat biscuits whenever, and read in the receiving parlour and play music loudly and wear his pyjamas all day and eat cake late at night, sitting at the kitchen table with his mum instead of eating in the dining room. It was an amazing feeling. He had never felt closer to his mum, either.
Unsure of how to react to the knowledge that Ron was naked in front of Harry- despite the six years of boarding school, Draco had never had that experience with a roommate- Draco dithered in the corridor until the door opened.
“ils t’ont aimé, ils t’aime encore. Tu n’es pas seule. Même sans parents, je t’aime” (they loved you, they love you still. You’re not alone. Even without parents I love you)
Draco mumbled a thanks before tucking in with all the grace of a starving Ron Weasley. Harry said as much, making Seamus and Dean laugh. Draco finished his breakfast in record time, but then turned slightly green and ran out of the room again.
He is jolted out of his reverie by Hermione returning, two steaming cups of vanilla black tea in hand. She curls up next to him on the sofa, wordlessly handing him a mug, and then looking at him expectantly.
Pansy immediately turned her back to him and curled up, indicating that she wanted him to mirror her position behind her, and he did, tucking his knees behind her knees and wrapping an arm around her stomach.
Harry called to Draco then went to their room to get ready. He wriggled into the same pair of black jeans as the night before, and slipped the shirt on. He went to button it up and stopped short. “Pansy!” he yelled. “it’s not got bloody buttons!”
He awoke to the sound of giggling, and looked up groggily to see Pansy standing in his doorway in a t shirt that must have been Blaise’s. He wondered why she was laughing until he realised the three of them were on top of the covers, Dean and Seamus in only their underwear and Harry was lying on his stomach with Seamus’ hand on his (luckily pyjama clad) arse. Harry just groaned and closed his eyes when Pansy yelled “Blaise! Get in here, you’ll want to see this”
“Notice what? How he didn’t greet me? Or tried to ask you out twice in front of me? Or lied and said the party was on the one day I was busy so he could get you alone? Yes, I noticed” I said venomously, feeling too dejected by Peterson’s actions to remember I’m not supposed to talk to Harry about this. I’m used to talking to Harry about everything.
“the two of us?” Draco sneered, “got a boyfriend I don’t yet know about, Potter?” he asked, quickly looking back to his book to hide his nervousness as to the answer.
Harry tenses, his grip around me going iron-strong. I wince a bit and shift on my feet and he notices and immediately relaxes, entirely in-tuned to my body language as I am to his. I’m response to him tensing, I drape a hand over the back of his shoulders and softly comb my fingers through the hairs at the back of his nape, and I feel his shoulders melt a little at the touch.
Just like all those nights before, they didn’t touch, and slept back-to-back, but the soft sounds of Ron’s snores kept Harry anchored, and he knew he wasn’t about to wake up in a cupboard under the stairs with the last years having never happened.
Taking a deep, steadying breath, Draco picked up his French sheet and the engraved cross pen he received for his sixteenth birthday from his mother, and made his way down the two flights of stairs before he was outside Harry’s room. He knocked, and then immediately regretted it. He heard movement from inside the room, then Harry’s laughter-laced shout of
He stumbled into his clothes he had laid out the night before, eschewing his trainers for a pair of brand new shiny walking boots his mother had insisted he buy, with all the latest mod-cons of hiking.
Draco hates that he has Harry in his bedroom just to leave him there, but knowing he’ll be waiting when Draco is done is enough to spur Draco on to telling his mother.
“I can’t help feeling like I’ve fucked it, but it wasn't even my fault. Why can’t the lass just leave me alone?” asked Harry.
“Mate, honestly its hardly a massive deal. We weren’t going to let you get bollocked on the first weekend of the year. Anyway, carrying you up those stairs was easier than rugby training” replied Harry, grinning.
When Draco finished reading he looked at Sirius, who had a sheen of tears in his silver-gray eyes. “This is amazing, Sirius” he said, and he heard his own voice crack a little with emotion. He distantly noticed Hermione slip silently from the room to let them have their moment.
There was that mention of the girl again. Draco was burning to ask, but he and Harry were no closer to being friends then they had been on Monday, and he doubted he would be met with a positive reception.
“I haven’t, since I was sixteen. You’re the first Black in decades” Sirius replied. Draco felt a sadness weighing on his heart. As much as he hated his father, he loved his mother and he doesn’t know what he would do without his little family unit, as cold, stiff and unaffectionate as it is. His turmoil must have shown on his face.
All through the day, Draco worried about how Harry was doing. He desperately hoped he didn’t have a run in with his aunt or cousin. He kept checking his phone under the table in lessons to see if Harry had texted but he never did, beyond one text to confirm he and Ron had reached London. Then again, Draco supposed it was awfully bad form to be on one’s phone during a funeral, but he hadn't expected Harry to stay for the whole thing.
“no, a loving one.” Replied Harry bluntly. He had become better at talking about the Dursleys recently, and he saw a mind healer to help him cope as he raised Teddy when his only point of reference was his own upbringing. “my muggle relatives abused me up until I went to Hogwarts, and every summer when I went back.” He said, unable to look either of the Malfoy’s in the eye. Spurred on now he started, he ploughed ahead. “they made me sleep in the cupboard under the stairs. They would lock me in there if I did something they considered ‘bad’, which was often. They starved me, which is why I think I like baking so much now. It reminds me that I have control over what I eat. That’s why I wanted to raise Teddy, to give him everything I never had.” He finally looked up, and to his surprise it was Draco who had teared up.
Harry grew louder here, and Draco’s heart ached as the sound of the two men’s voices swirling together in the dark vortex of the room, ‘and it’s worth it, it’s divine’
Half way through the film, Narcissa and Sirius came through, with trays of tea and cake. Narcissa had tear tracks down her face, but said nothing, only taking Harry’s hand and squeezing it. They all sit and eat cake, until Sirius gets a call and speaks
“Y’alreet?” The man asked, nodding at Draco, before wrapping an arm around Sirius and then Remus in a half-hug.
Ron just lifted the corner of his duvet in a silent invitation, and Harry threw a t-shirt on before climbing in next to him. It was reminiscent of the Christmases Harry had spent with Ron’s family when he was younger, when Harry was weak and underfed and terrified of adults and so stuck to Ron’s side like glue. They had shared a bed then, Harry unable to sleep by himself without being wracked with night terrors of cupboards and beatings.
“what is it, anyway?” Malfoy asked, looking slightly horrified that Harry was so comfortable around the snake.
“Dray darling can’t you learn to share” she whined. Draco choked on his pasta and Harry heard Blaise laugh for the first time. It was a deep, rumbling sound, and soon Draco’s face matched the colour of the rioja he was drinking. Harry decided he could let out his Slytherin side and have a bit of fun. Blaise seemed to dislike him somewhat, but he sensed an ally in Pansy
“it’s fine Ron, he’s grown, and so have I. I didn’t kill Voldemort (and be killed, he thought to himself) just to come back to school and continue petty rivalries.” He took a deep breath, entered the room and leaned heavily on the closed door behind him, eyes closed, fatigue hitting him like a freight train.
He could not, however, say this to them, he simply nodded, settled onto the floor by Blaise’s bed and held out a hand for a glass from which to drink.
The most striking was of Harry as an infant. He was held in the arms of a beautiful woman with rosy round cheeks and long curling red hair. Next to her stood a man who looked identical to Harry, yet his skin was just a few shades darker, an arm around the woman and smiling down at Harry. It must have been Harry’s parents, or ‘real’ parents, as it was clear that Remus and Sirius considered Harry to be a son, and Harry considered himself their son as well. They looked so happy and Draco wanted to know more than ever what had happened to them.
After all the prep and too much snacking on various muffins and biscuits and slices of banana bread, Harry excused himself to go and get changed.
“I know, I just, I can't help but feel like I'm not enough.” Draco said quietly, aware he was putting even more emotional stress on Harry and resenting it.
Draco arrived last back at Grimmauld, and stumbled out of the floo to see Harry intensely focussed on the book Draco had given him. The sight made Draco’s heart squeeze; the furrow of his brow and his eyes travelled relentlessly across the page.  Harry was so invested he didn’t even acknowledge Draco’s presence, and not wishing to disturb him, carried on up to his room.
He led Draco into a small room at the very top of the house, in what must have been the attic. It was clean and well kept, with a single bed pushed against one wall, a large chest of drawers wedged in a corner and a desk pushed under a circular skylight.
“not allowed?” Pansy said, and Harry realised maybe Draco hadn’t explained the abuse. He scratched the back of his neck and smiled sheepishly. “yeah, my relatives where somewhat abusive when I grew up. I was usually locked in the cupboard when they watched films” he said.
This was all forgotten though, when they began to pull up the driveway to his home. His mother reached out to take his hand, and he realised that hers was shaking.
They had finally arrived in the field that was to be their home for the night. Harry set his bag down and rolled his shoulders- they were killing him, but the burn in his thighs was welcome. He watched Malfoy collapse on his bag and felt a bit sick about how weak the boy was. It was a painful reminder of the war to see Malfoy looking much the way he had in sixth year. Harry’s new physique meant he saw a different person in the mirror now, and he was grateful for it.
“the stars are too blurry. I can’t distinguish them” Malfoy spoke slowly, clearly trying not to slur his words. He looked lovely in the firelight with the night sky around him, thought Harry. So very, utterly lovely. Harry grinned at him and was delighted to get a grin in return, Malfoy’s straight teeth glowing.
“Blaise, would you want to come?” when the boy shook his head, Harry said “would you be happy watching Ted for a few hours, or should I leave him with Molly?”
“we’ll be there.” Said dean. “now leave us to continue what you so rudely interrupted, unless you wish to join of course.”
It was six days later, the day before the new term started. Harry came down for breakfast in the morning to see Molly and Sirius siting at the table, clenching mugs of tea and looking sombre.
Draco was rooted the spot, unable to tear his eyes away, and even missed the cheers and whoops as Hermione began to do the same with Ron, as no-one had ever seen her so that loose at a party.  The song began to end, and Draco heaved a sigh of relief, hoping the spectacle was over, but to his disdain a new song with the same beat and accent began, and Harry and Bianca showed no signs of stopping, in fact Harry yelled in delight as the song came on, and the two went at it with renewed vigour.
To Draco’s surprise, it was Sirius who was stood outside the next morning, knocking at a much more acceptable time of day. He was leaning somewhat heavily on a cane, which surprised Draco even more. Perhaps it was why Sirius never seemed to be doing any actual farm work.
“Oh, sweetheart come here. Whatever it is, you can tell me” His mum said, holding out her arms to him. He goes to sit next to her on the sofa, taking her slender, elegant, bejewelled hands in his.
He loved it there, but he always missed his friends whenever he was away from England’s mountains green.
“why are you being so nice to me Harry? I was so out of line the other day, I haven’t even properly apologised yet, and you’re offering to host a dinner party for my friends?” he held his hand up to stop Harry speaking when the other boy opened his mouth. “before you remind me that you are the perfect saviour and you are just this selfless, I need to apologise properly. I was being entirely unreasonable and not listening to your request. I wasn’t thinking of Teddy either, which is abominable, and I now understand and fully accept that he comes first in this household. I am so used to my father’s homophobia towards my sexuality that I immediately assumed you were angry due to prejudice, and not good reason. I am sorry.” This was the Draco that Harry knew. “it’s okay, Draco. I understand your reasons, and yes. Teddy always comes first. You have the freedom to do whatever you want but if that includes people, especially people I don’t know, please let me know first so that if needs be, I can organise Teddy staying with someone else.” Harry said, deciding the apology was enough for the blond to be ‘Draco’ again.
There is a little-known tradition in Slytherin house. Little known on purpose, of course, we keep our cards close to our chest. Whilst the rest of the wizarding world sees and frowns upon our ‘arranged’ marriages, little do they know that we often arrange them ourselves- to an extent.
Harry then found himself seated in McGonagall’s office, as per the request she issued when he walked past her to enter the common room an hour before. He stared dazedly up at the portraits of past heads, thinking that had he known McGonagall would have been late he would have brought his iPod with him.
The Potter boy slides in to the chair next to Draco, and pulls out a lined notebook, his school planner and a Charlie and Lola pencil case, which draws a startled laugh from Draco, which he immediately regrets now that the Potter boy is looking at him with those awful (hot) green eyes.
