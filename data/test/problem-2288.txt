“Tell me,” he said. “What happened?”
Harry’s hand moved away. He covered Draco’s hand on his chest with his own again. He let out a sigh, and that awful distant voice told Draco that it was a sigh of disappointment.
“Right, him. You told him that, and I quote, ‘if you want a job done, you do it yourself, and you do it as quickly and thoroughly as possible.’ Now, we can’t let Sir…”
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, his voice breaking the heavy silence. “It was just once, but – Ginny, it was like I could breathe for the first time, like my magic was his magic, and it was just for a second, but I – I’m sorry.” The apology came out choked and broken, tears welling up and threatening to spill down his cheeks. Ginny just stared at him, unmoving, unblinking. Draco hugged his arms around himself, holding himself back from going over and pulling Harry back into his embrace. Ginny let out the breath she had been holding, ragged and torn.
Harry couched out a laugh that came out sounding more like a sob. “When did you get nice?” he asked thickly, sniffling. Draco chuckled.
“Who sleeps in the other room?”
Draco gave Harry’s hand a squeeze and smiled reassuringly at him when he turned with frustrated concern in his furrowed brow. “It’s fine, really,” said Draco. He shifted his weight a bit with a long, deep breath. When he looked up at Hermione, his gaze was level and calm.
“How would you know?” Harry snapped. Draco blanched. “Maybe that’s why he never liked you back, have you ever thought about that? Maybe it was because you kept pushing him away until he realised he was better off without you? Maybe he did love you, but you were just too self-absorbed to see it, and he gave up! You ever think about that?”
Draco nodded slowly, looking up at Harry with an incredulous smile. “I’m not dead,” he said. Harry shook his head with a silly grin plastered on his face.
“We will make it look like you succeeded in killing me that night,” Dumbledore continued, as easily as if they were discussing the weather. “You will escape with the other Death Eaters and become a double agent for the Order. Everything you hear, every plan and every word, you will report back to us. It is crucial that you not be caught. Do you understand?”
Neville slid into Draco’s vacant seat, fixing Harry a pointed look. Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Oh?” Draco asked, a punched-out gasp. The air was suddenly too close, too cold, his lungs unable to draw in a full breath.
“Nah, I just have never come that hard before,” Harry said. He waved his hand, sending a cleaning spell skittering across their sweaty skin, taking the spent condom with it. Draco thought about complaining – he never liked the way cleaning spells felt, like scrubbing with a dish cloth – but he was too tired. He nestled against Harry’s chest, and, with Harry’s hands running down his back, his magic like a warm blanket settling against his sweaty skin, fell into the deepest sleep of his life.
“We love you, too,” said Draco. He wrapped his arms around Teddy as he stood and kissed the top of his head. Harry smiled at them, the skin at the corner of his wrinkling adorably. The sound of their children’s laughter carried through the open window with the warm summer breeze. Harry’s magic flowed with the breeze, caressing his husband’s cheek lovingly. Draco’s heart in that moment was so full, he thought his ribs might break trying to contain it all. There, in that old cottage kitchen, their lives were complete.
Harry shrugged. “It just…”…
But Harry didn’t let him finish. Draco laughed into their kiss, let it get messy and uncoordinated.
“Weasley. Granger,” Malfoy said, giving them each a curt nod. When his gaze landed on Rose, his brow furrowed. “Tiny Weasley,” he said at last.
“Are you alright?”
“Of course I did! Do you even know me at all?”
“I don’t know, sir,” Harry said. He turned in the doorway, one hand on the frame as he smiled coolly at Robards. “I’m a pretty lucky man. Takes coming back from the dead to know.”
Draco leaned forward, his elbows braced against his knees. He opened his mouth, thought better, and closed it again. He fidgeted with the signet ring on his right hand, twisting it around and around as he frowned, deep in thought. When Harry reached out and put his hand over Draco’s, he didn’t pull away. He looked up. Harry had never learned how to hide his emotions. Draco read them all as they played out across Harry’s face – fear, anxiety, love. Draco turned his hands, held Harry’s in both of his. And there – there was hope, right there in the slight raise of his eyebrows, the tightness in the corner of his mouth.
“You were just a baby at the time, so you probably don’t remember her,” he continued. “She’s Victoire’s aunt, Ginny. I started dating her while we were still in school, but we broke up a couple years after the war ended. It was the same situation, I loved her but just not in the way she deserved. I told her that I was bisexual, she assumed that there must be someone else, then, and before I knew it, she was gone.”
“I believe you.”
“Tea, then? I’d kill for some Earl Grey.”
Ron waved him off. “I owe you one anyway,” he pointed out. When Harry looked confused, he clarified, “From putting up with me and Lavender back in sixth year. I can see now that was an unholy nightmare for everyone.”
“For fuck’s sake Ron, that’s not what – ”
“If you’re Uncle Harry’s boyfriend, does that mean you’re going to marry him?”
Harry didn’t go out for coffee much. Between work at the Ministry and co-parenting Teddy with Andromeda, free time was scarce, and when he did go out it was for a drink at the pub with his friends. But it had been a few years since he and Ginny had split, and his friends wanted to play matchmaker. So here he was, standing in the queue to order coffee at a Muggle coffee shop, while his date sat a table by the window.
“Draco….”
“Get. Out,” Draco growled. “Now.”
Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. He looked down at the pale blue rug and stuffed his hands in the pockets of his jeans, rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet. Part of it was that this was his job – if they lost their only witness, they would have no hope in solving this case – and part of it was his promise to Narcissa. But the truth was bigger than that. He hadn’t seen Malfoy in years, not since he had given back his wand after the trial. They hadn’t said much then – two exhausted kids, their loss reflected back at each other – it was a moment passed too quickly. Since then, though, Harry had kept tabs on Malfoy, watched his professional career from afar, imagining a time just like this where, maybe, they could start over. So he told Malfoy as much.
“Hermione’s going to France this summer with her parents,” said Ron. Harry hummed. “And Fred and George are still setting up their shop in Bristol, Charlie’s in Romania, and Bill’s travelling for work, so it’ll just be you, me, Ginny and Percy this summer. It’ll be pretty quiet, compared to London.”
As Draco added salt and pepper, Harry asked, a sinking feeling in his gut, “So you can get out of this house? Was that what you were going to say?”
Harry fidgeted with his cup. It was bright orange and emblazoned with the Chudley Cannons logo – a gift from Ron when Harry had taken the Defence Against the Dark Arts position.
“Pansy,” he replied.
“I’m sorry for waking you,” he mumbled, already drifting off again.
“Fuck.” Draco fought to keep the smile from spreading across his face, but how could he, when faced with such reckless affection? “Fine. But you know what this means, don’t you?”
“Harry?”
The sun began its climb into the overcast London sky. Draco rolled up the note he had written on a small slip of paper and tied it with a spare bit of kitchen twine. He fed Scorpius, grabbed his wand and wallet, pulled on his shoes as if he was just popping out to the shops for milk. All the while the note burned in his pocket.
“Goddamn it, not again!”
Draco scoffed. “People always ask me that,” he said, reflecting Harry’s posture and draping one arm over the back of the sofa. “How did you know you were gay, when did you know, were you abused as a child, why would you choose to live like this?” He shook his head, his smile twisted, pained. Harry watched him in silence.
“You gave me more than that,” Harry said softly. Draco pressed his lips together and focused on pulling the tiny fragrant thyme leaves from their thin branches. “Why?” Harry persisted.
“What good comes from you being in love with a fucking ghost?” Draco retorted with a hint of his old sneer. “For fuck’s sake, Harry, you have a whole life ahead of you! Who knows, the love of your life is probably back in London somewhere, and you haven’t even met them yet! You can’t stay here with me forever!”
“Come on, Draco,” Harry said. He stepped back to admire his work before turning a determined look on Draco. “It’s one night. And you said you were spending the morning with your mother, so your evening will be free, right?”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Alright, fine, I’ll give you that. Now, on to my grievances.”
“That’s one way of putting it,” Harry muttered.
When Draco got home from work one night, it was to the strange sight of Harry in the kitchen, cooking. They had both agreed that beyond the basics, the task of cooking should be left to Draco. Not that Harry was a bad cook, per se. Just a dangerous one.
“Oh,” she said. Harry looked sheepishly at her, half-turning into Draco as if to hide from her surprise. “
kissed
“His friends would rip you apart if they found out.”
“I didn’t even want to be here in the first place,” Draco grumbled petulantly as he got to his feet, dusting the ash from his knees. “I’ll be in your office, then.”
“Are you really fine with it?” Draco asked. “All of it? After everything I’ve put you and your family through? With Harry not marrying your sister? With him being with me? All of it?”
“N- wait, your servant is named Kreacher? Seriously?”
It was
Harry’s usually open-book face suddenly shuttered, growing cold and distant. Draco steeled himself, even as his stomach sank. This was for the best, he told himself. For both of them. A clean break.
“Of course.” Harry stepped aside to let him in. “There’s a fire in my room, you can dry off there.”
He opened his eyes. Harry was so close, he could see the faint laugh lines beginning to form at the corners of his eyes, of his mouth. Each breath was filled with cedar and black pepper and cigarette smoke from the balcony above. Harry’s upturned face was lit by the market lights strung up on the railing, softly glowing like a dying sun.
Draco tried to shrug and winced. Harry’s brow furrowed, but Draco shook his head a little, letting him know he was fine. “Two sides of the same coin, hate and love,” he said at last. “That memory I showed you? The first one? That was when I began to realise…so many things, but mostly that I had loved you all my life.”
“I see the school still lets you in,” Harry shot back from behind his book. Crabbe made a step towards him, but Draco quickly intervened, pulling Crabbe’s attention back to him.
The attendant led him from the antechamber down a lofty hallway to a set of great oak doors guarded by knights in the forest green garb of the Royal Guard. The attendant waved his hand, and the knights opened the doors, revealing the throne room in all its glory – sweeping pillars and buttresses that disappeared into vaulted ceilings enchanted so that stars winked down at Harry from inky skies, distant galaxies wheeling overhead; banners whose subjects frolicked with bearded unicorns on fields of finely woven wildflowers; black stone floors with a white marble inset that depicted the royal insignia, a crowned winged serpent ouroboros –
“Very astute observation, young sir.”
“You know why he stayed with Ginny? He loved her, but he was scared. Scared to come out and say he liked men and women. Scared what the world would say when they found out their saviour was queer. He had survived everything else, but he had seen what could happen to those who were different, even in your world. He had so many expectations set on him, so many people looking to him for guidance, and he was so tired, so
“We’re going to have to do something about this,” Harry said as the silence stretched on between them. “You think the Headmaster would let us switch?”
“I couldn’t stop thinking about you all week,” Harry whispered. Draco grinned.
“Fine, recovering at St. Mungo’s,” he said, a smirk slowly spreading across his face as he attempted to sidestep past Draco to get to the desk. “Seriously, were those glasses?”
“No.” Draco shook his head. “Don’t say it.”
“ – what my life has been like these past few years! I’ve been perfectly happy here, I have my job, I know who I am here. Here, on my own, I don’t need you.”
Hermione blinked at him. “I have so many questions,” she said, half to herself. “But I guess now’s not the time… Right, well, I guess I can’t hold your parents’ decision to continue enslaving house elves against you. Erm, right, so. That just leaves my last grievance then.” Her head shifted amongst the flames, and Draco could imagine her rolling her shoulders back, the young lawyer in training. “Over the years, I have known you to be a coward. I have known you to be arrogant, rude, and mean, not caring about anyone but yourself. So how can I expect you to treat Harry well?”
it. I had almost killed two other students by that point and was planning to kill Dumbledore! You should have killed me when you had the chance. Could have saved your side a whole lot of trouble.”
Only, when he popped into the great high-ceilinged atrium, he realised that he head no idea where the Auror office was located. The court rooms, his father’s old office, sure. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement? Not so much.
“Well,
A couple years later, when Harry was sixteen, his friends decided to have a Hallowe’en party at the old manor – “It’s a real-life haunted house, Harry! It’s perfect!” Ron had pointed out when Harry had been reluctant. He made himself smile and went along with it. In the end, he, Hermione, Ron, Ron’s sister Ginny who kept looking at Harry when she thought he wouldn’t notice, and their friends Neville, Luna and Lavender all piled into the drawing room of the dilapidated house.
“My parents, much like Robards, didn’t approve of my, er, lifestyle choices. Except I also had a bit of a drinking problem at the time, so there was that as well.” His smile faltered. “Although, they definitely still don’t approve of the gay thing – if you thought I was verbally abusing you while we were at school, you should have heard some of the things my father said when I visited last Easter. First time in two years, and Father’s vocabulary has only improved.”
“Thank you.”
“And? Get to the point, Piers.”
“You ashamed of me, Potter?”
“Sure, yeah,
Ron eyed him as he chopped. “You’ve gone soft, Harry,” was all he said. But Ron knew his best friend, and there was more to this story than Harry was telling. He pursed his lips. Harry would tell him in his own time.
Harry shook his head, his gaze dropping to the papers on Draco’s desk. “Yes, I do,” he murmured. “I
“Straight people,” he grumbled under his breath. Harry’s eyebrows shot up. Draco, noticing, winked at him and added with a crooked smile, “Present company excluded.”
Dumbledore considered him over his half-moon spectacles. “You have piqued my curiosity,” he said, his blue eyes twinkling. “Very well. Send in this mystery person.”
The front door had been boarded up, as had most of the windows. Everyone knew, though, that one of the boards covering the drawing room window was loose, and all you had to do was push open the sash to get in. One by one, the three of them wiggled their way through, dropping down onto a grimy chaise lounge below. Harry made his way into the middle of the room, craning his neck as he stared at all the fine furnishings, now shrouded in heavy cobwebs and a thick layer of dust. The walls were decorated with rich purple wallpaper, the marble floors covered in ornate rugs that coughed up small clouds beneath their feet.
, he thought,
Harry swore under his breath. He pushed his hands under Draco’s navy blue jumper, calloused palms rubbing up Draco’s stomach and sides. “Bed,” he growled against Draco’s bruised and bitten lips. “Now.”
Harrys grin softened. “I love you, Draco Malfoy,” he whispered against Draco’s mouth. Draco beamed.
“I really have to piss.”
“Sounds nice,” Harry murmured, smiling against Draco’s lips as he leaned forward. “Can’t imagine you keeping bees though.”
“Do you have any more?”
“Term is starting next week, what did you expect?” she asked innocently. Harry glared at her.
“We should go,” he whispered to Draco.
Of course. Harry knew that. McGonagall finally took pity on him and got Malfoy’s attention, asking if there was anything he required before term started. Harry frowned at his eggs. Why was it so hard to talk to Malfoy? Neville looked over at him pityingly.
“What are you doing?”
Harry shrugged, his cheek against Draco’s damp shoulder. “No,” he said with a heavy sigh. “Not right now, anyway. You’re working. I should let you go.”
As they turned the corner into their hall, they saw a cluster of Draco’s friends outside their door. Draco swore under his breath. One of them must have heard, because one by one they all turned and saw the two of them standing, frozen, at the end of the hall. Draco wrenched his hand from Harry’s grasp, and when he looked up, he saw the split-second moment when Draco’s fear was hidden by the impenetrable mask he had worn for so long.
Harry shot a meaningful look over at Draco, who rolled his eyes back at him. He turned back to his friends.
“Hurry up, Potter,” he growled. Harry’s smile broadened. Instead of speeding up, he went almost impossibly slower, pulling Draco’s jeans down inch by inch. “Potter,” Draco warned. Harry just grinned. Draco kicked his legs, trying to get the jeans off faster. Harry allowed this with a small shake of his head, but when he settled himself between Draco’s legs, Draco knew his attempt to speed things along had come at a price. Harry kissed up one thigh, one hand brushing up the other side. Draco squirmed as his mouth neared his crotch, the hand on the other leg rubbing circles into his inner thigh. “Gods, please,” he whined, even as Harry pulled away to turn his attention to the skin above the waistband. He could feel Harry’s smile as his lips trailed along the elastic, could feel his breath ghosting over his cock, and it was driving him nuts. “Please just, Merlin, do something, fuck, enough teasing…”
“I’m sure she would,” Malfoy replied with a smirk. “I imagine it’s bigger than the entire Weasley house.”
Draco mulled this over. “I don’t blame you,” he said finally, not meeting Harry’s hopeful eyes. “I – I’ve fancied you since we were in school, but refused to acknowledge it. It was Blaise – Zabini, yeah – who first pointed it out. He said, what was it… ‘sometimes we lie to ourselves because it’s easier than the truth.’” He sighed. “He was right, of course, the bastard. But I thought it would never come to anything, so I just did my best to ignore it, which, during the war, was easy enough. That night you were brought to the Manor, though… seeing you like that… and then during the Battle, in the Room of Hidden Things….” He trailed off as he closed his eyes, the memories flashing against the darkness of his mind – Harry’s face, swollen from a jinx, his eyes begging Draco not to give him up; Harry’s hand reaching for him as the flames closed in around them; Harry, after the trials, offering a smile and a cup of tea like he was an old friend.
“I mean, after the war,” Harry said. Draco groaned and rolled off Harry, landing with a huff on his back next to him. “What? Something must have happened. You work in a Muggle coffee shop. You share a flat, even though you and I both know – ”
That weekend was a Hogsmeade weekend. The night before, the first snow of the season fell, covering the grounds in a bright white frost. It wouldn’t stick around for long, and it wouldn’t properly snow for another week or two, but it was enough to get everyone excited that Friday night. The eighth years huddled around the common room window, watching the fluffy snowflakes fall with a wondering light in their eyes. It was like the war had never happened and they were all eleven again, experiencing their first snow at Hogwarts. Even Draco stood at the back of the group, a small smile on his thin lips as he watched the snowflakes float past outside.
Harry laughed. He leaned his forehead against Draco’s with a wide grin. Draco couldn’t help but chuckle as well.
Ron’s eyes followed Draco’s every move as he sat down on Harry’s other side. Draco ignored him and leaned over Harry to ask Hermione if she had seen the news about the recent tests of a new experimental potion at St. Mungo’s – the two had miraculously bonded over a shared intellectual curiosity that often left Harry third-wheeling in the conversation. He gave Draco a look and received a confused eyebrow raise.
Draco whipped around to gape at him. Potter chuckled. “Well, over your trial, really,” he corrected. “She couldn’t understand why I defended you in court, after – she all but blamed you for Fred’s death, even though it wasn’t your fault – and there were other things,” he finished with a shrug. Draco narrowed his eyes. He suspected Potter was skipping over far more than he let on, but for once, he decided not to push things.
Harry shook his head. “They’re fine, I Talked to them an hour ago, I just….” He paused, biting his lip. He stood by the cot – he and Draco had managed to make it a bit larger, thanks to Draco’s more confident Transfiguration skills, and added a Cushioning charm so that it wasn’t so hard on Harry’s joints. Draco’s copy of the
“I have no idea.”
“Yeah,” he sighed. “Sorry about that.”
“So are you two…friends?” Hermione asked tentatively, looking from Harry to Draco and back. Ron appeared to catch up with the conversation and narrowed his eyes at Harry again.
“What do you mean things? Do you mean – oh.” Harry drew back to look Draco in the face. “I’m not calling you Daddy,” he said firmly. Draco blushed.
“You’re not going to leave?” Draco mumbled, his eyelids already drooping.
he was a Death Eater.
“We thought the young Greengrass girl would be a suitable partner.”
“He’s been out there a while,” Ginny pointed out. “You sure he’s okay?”
The priest hesitated. “Yes,” he said finally. “I do.”
“What are you up to?” He shot her a suspicious look, lost somewhat since she couldn’t see much of him from the fire.
“Was that what you were worried about?” he asked. He pulled Draco back down to him with a messy kiss, licking his own cum from the other boy’s mouth.
Draco spluttered and scoffed, his face aflame. “I’m sure I have no idea what you mean!” he stammered. Ron’s shit-eating grin split across his face.
Ginny snapped around to face her, eyes as wide as dinner plates. “And you think that’s okay?” she hissed. “They could have killed each other by now!”
“Hermione, Ron and I spent another year fixing this place back up – God, it was so bad, like, it was bad when the Order was here back in fifth year, and when we stayed here for a bit when we were hunting Horcruxes, but Jesus. Kreacher was furious, we had to toss so much stuff, half of it was cursed and the other half was a health hazard, it was ridiculous. Ron jokes that that’s what did him in in the end – poor thing died about, oh, a year and a half ago, about round when we were finishing the renovations. I’m kind of glad Teddy didn’t meet him, I think Kreacher would have given the poor kid nightmares. That’s about it really, that’s all that’s happened in the past five years.”
One, two.
Draco looked up, his grey eyes filling with tears. Harry held his chin gently with one hand to keep him there and gave him a small smile.
“I could ask you the same,” he replied. He sighed and crossed his arms, stretching his legs out under the table. “I’m okay. Getting back into work. Draco’s fine too, if you were wondering.”
“Yes, thank you.” Draco’s voice sounded strained. “As for your, er, previous question, no, being his boyfriend doesn’t mean that I’m going to marry him. The word you’re thinking of is fiancé. Very different.”
“Er, yeah. Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.”
“I’m afraid I’m out of your favourite biscuits,” Harry was saying, stretching up on his tip toes as he rummaged blindly for the Jaffa cakes on the top shelf. His hoodie had ridden up as he reached, revealing golden skin and the dimple of his low back just above the elastic of his pants. His joggers had slouched indecently low, revealing the top few centimetres of tight black boxers. And Merlin, all it would take was one small push…
Draco’s shoulders slumped as he sidestepped away from Harry, his head spinning. Harry turned away from him, but Draco could have sworn he was holding back a laugh.
Draco grinned. “I’m full of surprises,” he said. Just to prove his point, he flipped them around so that Harry was beneath him, his knees framing Draco’s hips and his mouth open in a surprised ‘o’. Draco set almost immediately to kissing and sucking at Harry’s neck, attacking the sensitive spots behind his ear and where his neck met his shoulder. Harry squirmed beneath him with a pleased little smirk on his lips.
He thought of bright green eyes and sun-kissed skin, and the tears rolled down his cheeks.
Draco dragged his hands over his face, his fingertips covering his mouth as he stared at Harry in consternation. “Okay,” he said, lowering his hands back into his lap, “start from the beginning. What happened exactly?”
“And what conclusions would that be?”
“I can also burp the ABC’s!” Teddy added. Draco gestured at the child as if he’d just won a court case.
Harry lowered his head. “Yes, sir.”
“What happened?” he asked, frowning. Hermione let out a dry laugh and gestured at Harry, who was wondering if he could summon his Invisibility Cloak and hide beneath it forever.
Draco sighed, but stood up with a small smile. “Fine. But you have to explain to my mother why I’m not spending Christmas dinner with her.”
Draco propped himself up so that Harry could see him roll his eyes. “You are insatiable,” he told the grinning boy beneath him.
He threw his hands in the air. “I never said that. No punching or dueling was my only request.”
Bill slipped out the door ahead of them – Charlie was kept back to help the girls with bringing the food out. Happy faces began to lose their brightness the moment eyes began to catch sight of the pair walking side-by-side.
“Yes?”
It was Friday. Most people were staying up late to do anything except homework. Only Harry and Draco had gone to bed early, but it was only so they could talk together as they usually did. How Harry wished they were doing that instead, if only he had kept his mouth shut. If only he hadn’t let Zabini get in his head. It was his fault, really, for seeking him out in the first place.
Draco stared at the words he’d had just written. Three little words. He really shouldn’t tell them. It would make it too easy to figure out who he was. They would hate him. He didn’t want this to be over yet.
“Of course,” Pansy waved her arm between them, “I do not have secrets in my relationships. It’s very unhealthy.”
With one last fleeting glance at the wilted man’s expression, Harry turned away and apparated out of the flat.
Harry rolled his eyes. Draco stifled a laugh, which earned him a quick glare from the man he was supposed to be helping examine.
Harry shook his head. “No, it’s about something else you said. You’re right; it’s time for me to take care of my own wellbeing. I can’t do that here. I’ve been chasing down bad guys my whole life but I think it’s time to finally let someone else do it. I can’t duel myself out of everything.”
“Can’t a man just like a beverage without everyone drilling him about it?”
She looked down to count the change in her hand. “Harry’s been obsessed with you for eight years. By proxy, we had to be too.” She split up what looked to be half of the loot and dropped it into Ron’s now open hand.
“There was another person then,” Ron suggested.
When it was almost muted, he looked over at Malfoy, who was cowering behind the sofa with ears covered. "I told you!" he exclaimed.
Harry snorted. "You sound like Hermione." Malfoy made a face, but there was little malice behind his eyes. "Honestly, I wish I could have a break from it for once. I feel like every day, I'm being told something new that I have to remember for the next case. It's exhausting, really."
There was still tension in the room, even as Terry began to change the direction of the discussion, or perhaps it was only around the former Death Eater. It began to ease gradually as Draco eased. Harry leaned close, and Draco obliged, pressing their shoulders together as two even pillars of support.
The pair tore apart. Harry threw himself into the opposing wall. They both snapped their heads in the direction of the sound.
Harry’s eyes darted back to Malfoy, noticing his fear. Harry suddenly began to dig through his pockets before pulling out his wand. Malfoy tightened his hold on his own. Instead of attacking, Harry threw the piece of wood on the ground and pushed himself harder against the table. “You shouldn’t have come here,” he urged, refusing to look at Malfoy. “I don’t want to hurt you.”
Harry shook his head. “Just passing through.”
“I don’t want you to be like me.”
Play dumb or play it off? Harry’s eyes moved up to the top of Malfoy’s head. The blonde held his breath. “You have very nice hair.” A smirk twisted his lips as his eyes reconnected with Malfoy’s. “I thought I’ve said that before.”
“You can trust me,” his voice croaked out. “I swear.”
Malfoy's mouth fell open, looking positively aghast. "You mean muggles eat by stabbing stuff with sticks? They don't even have forks or other tableware? How do they eat soup? What kind of uncivilized-"
Draco had to swallow hard as he put his pen back to the parchment, trying to force himself to write the words he was thinking.
“I would love to, but as you might recall, I have no where to go.”
"But they shouldn't be able to get away with it," Malfoy argued. "Why have you never talked about this before? Muggles can't just-"
“Ouch, that bruise isn’t looking so good,” voiced Ron, eyeing the purpling spot on Harry’s cheek. “Carson got you good, mate. You sure you don’t want to go to the infirmary?”
"Sorry," Malfoy muttered. He didn't put his hand back on Harry's face, and Harry found himself oddly disappointed.
Draco sent her a sharp glare. “He’s not my boyfriend.” He softened then. “And it couldn’t be just anyone. He knows what it’s like. He was in the thickest part of the war, just like me. He doesn’t pity me, and he doesn’t tell me I’m over exaggerating. He’s just… He’s there whenever I need him.”
Unbeknownst to Harry, Draco remained in his bed with his eyes wide open as he stared at the closed bathroom door. He was still trying to wrack his brain. Still trying to make sense of what he had just heard and what it meant.
Harry traced the shape of the mark a few more times before lightly brushing his calloused fingertips over the length of his forearm. A few times, his touch went up into Draco’s palm, the skin there feeling surprisingly sensitive, before going back down his arm again. It caused a shutter to run through Draco’s body.
Weasley rolled his eyes and turned back to his friends. Both Granger and Potter scoffed and sent light glares as well before returning to their huddle.
The question he had asked Andromeda made more sense now. Her response meant even more.
Harry raised his brow at Ron. They’d just been sent to the bar to order more drinks and were currently waiting for Aberforth to return with their Butterbeers―they seemed to be the only ones who drank such tame stuff in that place. “Like what?”
He summoned up that famous Gryffindor courage and pulled himself up again. He could do this. He had to. He wasn’t going to let the first bump in the road ruin what he had with Draco.
Malfoy uncrossed his body, smacking the table as he got to his feet. “Well then, Kreacher,” he said loudly, “take me home. I need to get some clothes.”
A long sigh left Harry's mouth as he grumbled, "Sadly."
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, his voice husky and making this ten times harder for Draco.
before putting the book down to say a final goodnight to the droopy-eyed boy.
Heather had more empathy. When Pansy frowned at the pair, Heather pointed to her upper lip. Pansy copied the gesture before her face became as red as her lips, and she began to fervently clean off her face without ruining her makeup.
Time passed. Ron and Hermione began to talk amongst themselves, attempting to include Harry but seeing that it wasn’t going to happen. He liked hearing the steady rhythm of their conversation anyway. It was familiar, calming.
Finally, he lifted his wand hand and let the piece of wood rest delicately between his index and middle finger, his thumb resting on the end to keep it in place. There were a few small gasps which he expected. The way the Dark Lord held his wand was nearly as recognizable as his snake-like face.
He followed it down to another generic face, but this one had magenta hair, and the one below it had blue. The name under the blue-headed face read: Edward Lupin.
“There, I’m out,” Malfoy said through the door. “I’m not going anywhere, though.”
“And you really do have nice hair.”
Harry had been waiting all morning for this question, but Ron decided to wait until Hermione was also present. Her wide-eyed gaze was not lost on him.
"So, they taught you how to cook so you couldn't use magic?"
I don’t know why I have a thing about Harry being mildly James-like when it comes to flirting with Draco. I think it just fits well with their history of rivalry and while Harry is generally awkward and unsmooth, he is the king of sarcasm and I think most of his flirting has a sarcastic undertone to it, or that’s what he intends when he’s messing with Draco. Let me know if it feels authentic to his character or not for future reference, I just really like it.
being there." Harry licked his chapped lips. "You know what, it doesn't matter. I'm going."
He snatched up the other two mugs so quickly that some of the contents sloshed onto the already sticky counter. He shot Aberforth an apologetic glance. The man looked unfazed, grabbing a nearby clearly used rag to throw over the wet spot. Maybe they should give the Three Broomsticks another shot—at least they would know their glasses were clean.
It wasn't until one o'clock that Harry began to consider lunch. When a commercial began to play, he got up and went to the fridge only to come across a scarce amount of food. "Damn, we finished the leftovers."
“Potter. Potter?” The frantic voice from beside him pulled him from the green light behind his eyelids.
Malfoy began to pick at his sleeve, his voice falling low until it was almost inaudible. "You're not the only one who rather not have a reminder of their past."
Harry’s eyes slanted to Draco. That wasn’t the first time he’d heard of a possible leak in the ministry. The last one had told Terry Skeres where Draco lived, but there was little to no investigation ― the safety of ex-Death Eaters wasn’t high on anyone’s priority list at the ministry.
“I sent you owl after owl. You ignored almost every single one except for the last telling me to leave you alone.”
“That he’s…” Harry stopped himself. He wasn’t supposed to say that. He promised Draco he wouldn’t tell anyone, not even Ron or Hermione.
There was some more arguing from his friends, but he brushed them off and left the Great Hall with the Slytherin, feeling many different gazes on his back.
Harry realized that his quick action to get away from Draco might have been taken wrong. He shook his head rapidly. "No, it's okay. I just wasn't expect-"
Malfoy couldn't say he slept poorly the previous night, though. He'd actually found comfort relatively quickly after he had saved Harry's glasses from breaking under his heavy head and pulling the throw blanket over his sleeping form.
He released Draco’s shirt only so he could brush his thumb underneath his eye. No tears had escaped—Draco was too good at compartmentalizing—but Harry could see its ghost. “I’m sorry.”
“It’s not,” Harry spoke bluntly. When it came to matters such as this, Harry had quickly learned that it was better to not beat around the bush. Malfoys certainly knew how to ask for something without actually saying it.
She shrugged. “I came by the weekend after you brought me here and we started talking. Harry was hurt at the time though and I didn’t want to bother you.”
Just as Ron went to open his mouth, a folder landed on the desk between them. They both snapped their attention to the head of the Auror's department. "Everyone's busy on their own cases, but I've got a report of an Unforgivable Curse in a mostly muggle area."
Not giving Saint Potter another thought, Draco went into the library. After a swift greeting to Madam Pince, he went to his usual section.
Hermione stalked closer, dropping into the chair beside him.
"Grace, tell Will to redirect his anger at his mother where it belongs," said the woman in the coat as she wrote something at the desk. After the red-head hung up the phone on a disembodied voice, which made Malfoy frown, the woman in the coat tore a check to hand to the red-head. "Guilt, be gone!" she exclaimed.
Only once he was standing outside Malfoy's door did Harry's Gryffindor courage begin to falter. Why was he doing this again? What was Malfoy going to think? Then again, since when did Harry give a damn what Draco Malfoy thought? He could be kind if he wanted to be.
“You can use our Floo,” Terry offered. He started towards the house, Harry and Ron were right on his heel. “You’ll end up in visitors but it’ll still be quicker.”
Harry held him tighter, if possible, resting his chin on the top of Draco’s head. “I’m not going anywhere.”
Ron only turned to Robards once she was out of sight around the corner. “I brought him because-”
A smile played on Harry’s face as he continued to keep his head down. “Well, I thought it would be a good time considering I just got indefinite time off.”
“Shut it, Ferret,” Ron snarled, and Hermione glared from around him.
Never before had Draco thought that helping someone cook could involve so much sexual tension. That night they finished eating in record time.
The healer had her lips pursed and tried to avoid eye-contact as she passed Draco. “Auror Robards, I have a few more questions about what happened.”
He picked up the paper. The first thing that caught his eye was the picture which was front and center and took up nearly a whole column on its own. There was no denying it was Harry or Draco. In the photo, Harry pulled Draco to a stop, earned a confused look from Draco, and pulled him in for a sweet kiss.
1 May 2001
She narrowed her eyes but otherwise didn’t disagree. She slowly returned her gaze to the window.
Harry’s jaw clamped down so hard that he was certain the attendant heard. He hurried with the door and the lift began to move. Thankfully, Harry was the only one who had to get out on level two – or the only one willing to. The moment the door closed again behind him, he dropped his shoulders and let out the long exhale of breath he’d been holding.  If this was just the start of it, what else was he in for?
Harry raised his brows. “Did you ever stop?”
“No, he just insults me.”
They still bickered constantly. So much that they often found pillows being flung at them when they got too rowdy in the Common Room. They tended to take most of their energy out on the quidditch field, at least. Harry won every game.
Zabini sighed and reached out to touch Draco’s leg tentatively, the same one Harry just had his hand on. Draco was still in too much shock to move. “Potter found me because he figured me out, and he threatened me because he’s jealous.” His eyes found Draco’s once more, and it simply threw another cog into Draco’s spinning mind. “You should be careful with that one. I think he has some possession issues. He was so scared of giving you a choice that he tried to scare me away.”
Flying was always an excellent way to take his mind off of things. Sometimes they flew together, and other times Harry would give Draco his space and go on his own, although never without asking if Draco would like to go first.
Deciding on a trial, he stopped moving his fingers in his hair. It caused a small whimper of protest that was nearly inaudible. Harry resisted the urge to smile. “Do you want to go to sleep?”
A muffled clatter lulled Harry out of his rest. He levered an eye open. The room was still very dark with the exception of the light which leaked in from under the door. A shadow moved passed the crack and Harry’s mind jumped to alertness. One hand grabbed his glasses while the other reached for the spot beside him. He frowned when he didn’t feel anything beside him. With a few blinks through the magnified glass, his sleepy brain began to connect the dots.
Draco sat up a little straighter. He rested his book in his lap, placing his hands on top as he stared forward, suddenly appearing very ridged. “Oh.” He swallowed hard. “And how did the Weasley clan take that?”
The man scoffed. “Please boy! Who couldn’t recognize Harry Potter? I assume it helps that I used to see you fairly often when I had the morning shift.”
Neville was the only one looking at Draco, his hands fiddling in his lap around a bottle of Butterbeer. “You caught me out after dark snagging some food before we had a connection to Aberforth, and you let me go. You didn’t say anything even though you knew what I was doing. I never did get to say thank you for that.”
Harry scoffed. “I don’t think that’s possible.”
Harry snapped his head up, and Malfoy quickly began to think of a way to take back his statement. "If you don't mind, yeah. That would help a lot."
Ron nodded. “It’s just… I have my suspicions about Dean and now you… I don’t want people using my sister like that.”
“Yeah, buddy?” He paused at the door, turning back to look at the boy.
Harry’s heart pounded in his chest the whole way home. To his great relief, the front door was securely locked when he arrived. He charmed it open.
Ron grabbed his cloak, throwing it over his shoulders before turning back to Harry. "He's calmed down, and we've put a tracker on his wand. We'll know every spell he casts up until the trial."
Let me tell ya, my obsession with BBC America growing up is my only saving grace with British slang and it's subpar at best.
Harry gave a short nod and guided Draco around to the sitting room. He could feel the eyes of the three Weasleys on his back but he was more concerned with whispering a rushed of apology to Draco.
It felt like Harry’s life was playing out the happy ending of a story. A rose-colored haze covered his eyes wherever he looked. It only increased exponentially whenever he looked at Draco.
Harry nodded. “I’ll make more of an effort. Goodnight, Andy.”
From the way they spoke, Draco became more and more convinced they were a muggle-born due to them mentioning things like being hunted or on the run. The more certain of this he became, the more his chest ached. This wasn’t the type of person his father had always told him muggle-borns were. They were clever and funny and kind. They were exactly the kind of person he always wished he had in his life when he was alone. How could they ever be bad?
A pang of panic sent Harry’s heart pounding. He never actually told any of the Weasleys about Draco other than Ron. From the way Ron had talked, he assumed they just knew. He hadn’t even considered properly coming out to them. “Ron said you all already knew.”
Harry considered this. Maybe Malfoy wasn’t just trying to keep all of his limbs away from the fire, but he was also trying to warm himself. It was only meant to be a joke, but Harry nudged to the middle of the sofa.
There was a question in Malfoy’s eyes. He found the answer himself, but it appeared to vex him. “Still as chivalrous as ever, Potter,” he said on his signature draw.
The sudden silence pulled his eyes back up to the other man. Malfoy's face was pinched. He kept his hard gaze on the boxes of food, his fingers running over them like he was trying to open them but not putting in quite enough effort to actually do it. "No, they… He's still at the manor, I think. I don't have as much contact with him, so I'm not sure."
Harry chuckled. "You sound like Ron and Hermione."
Malfoy looked away quickly, trying to pay no mind to how the other man's shirt had risen up to display his midriff when he raised his hands above his head.
“A smart one!”
Hermione abruptly stood.
“I’ll admit I wasn’t the biggest fan,” he said gravely then let out a short, irked huff, “but Ginny scolded us all pretty thoroughly.”
“Does it look fake to you because it doesn’t to me?”
"ARRGH!" Skeres fell to the ground with a loud thump.
The familiar chime over the door sounded their entrance. For a moment, they were too distracted with their conversation to notice anything different about their surroundings. It was only when Harry looked up to greet Heather that he faltered.
An opportunity came to light when he noticed Justin Finch-Fletchley having a particularly difficult time as his every attempt at
Harry stood up and walked toward the counter to make his cup of tea. “Go to bed, Malfoy,” he said as he passed.
Harry lifted his head, a wicked smile on his lips. “Maybe I should arrest you.”
“Then why couldn’t we talk about it earlier?”
They rounded the corner to the guest corridor, Harry nearly slipping on the freshly mopped floor. His eyes instantly wheeled around for Filch or his ugly cat. Even Malfoy chasing him took a backseat to the thought of Filch catching him ruining his cleaning. It appeared to be his lucky day because the only person he saw was Hermione speaking to the knocker on their door.
He wasn’t at all careful about it, and Malfoy’s eyes were fluttering open soon after. There was an initial flinch of shock before his eyes began to clear, and he focused. “Potter?”
Harry nodded. “Yes,” a grin spread across his lips, “he is.”
The green color faded from his vision and instead he soon found the warm colors and various patterns of the Burrow before him. The plump woman bustling around the kitchen spun around at the sound of the Floo. Her face instantly lit up at the sight. “Harry, there you are!” Molly Weasley left her station at the stove to give the man the type of hug only a mother could give.
He started to walk towards the street, but he still didn't see the restaurant when he got there. Why did that name sound familiar then? He shoved his hands into his pockets, frowning at the streets. Just as he was about to turn around and give up his search, his hand rubbed against his wallet. He stopped in his tracks. Was that where he remembered it from? Malfoy couldn't have been living that close to him without him noticing.
Molly, Charlie, Percy, and Fleur exchanged looks. George even looked up from Victoire to give Harry an odd look as he passed. Harry didn’t pay them any mind.
As if they were both trying to prove their points, they began to see each other even more often the following days. Harry came over the next day to take Malfoy shopping for basic household items and stayed well into the evening to have dinner and watch more television. He also brought several sets of clothes with him, which they stuffed into the bottom drawer of Malfoy's dresser. When the weekdays returned, Harry started apparating straight to Malfoy's after work and not going home until well into the night.
"Right, you were raised by your muggle relatives," said Malfoy though it seemed like it was supposed to be a reminder to himself rather than a statement. He focused on Harry again. "You're close to your aunt, then?"
Harry’s bright mood lasted the rest of the day. It seemed to even throw off Malfoy, who flinched when Harry shot him a wink in Potions. Ron groaned audibly. “Malfoy’s right. You are terrible.”
“He doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore, though. When it looked like the Dark Lord would win, and the Malfoys would be at the top, he was more than happy to be seen with me. That was until we were painted as public enemy number one from every corner. Now, who would want anything to do with the Malfoy name? Who would voluntarily be a social pariah?”
Ron batted away the paper. “I’ve seen the papers and I know my partner. He’s not under any influence. There’s no news so get over yourselves and get back to work.”
Taking a deep breath, he summoned up all of his Malfoy pride and pulled himself up to his full height. He entered the room with his head held up high. “Good morning, Granger, Weasley.” He went around to the other side of the cot and handed Harry one of the cups in his hand. “No coffee, only tea.”
Malfoy had gotten close again. He reached up with both hands and pushed down the white-blonde head, raking his fingers violently through the soft locks.
This assumption was only confirmed when Harry returned but was still missing a key article of clothing.  “Er, I think you’ve forgotten something,” Draco pointed out, trying with all his might not to stare at the shirtless man.
Harry narrowed his eyes, Malfoy’s face becoming slightly fuzzy. “Obviously. What did they teach you in Slytherin? Why would you be friends with someone you don’t like?”
The couple flew apart. They turned towards the sound to see someone on the balcony, pounding against the door. Harry fell off the sofa, scrambling for his wand.
Harry shook his head like his words were light and meaningless, but Malfoy could feel the weight in each syllable. "Just the memories."
The odd case of enemies, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, turned friends was the newest mystery of Hogwarts castle. Had Harry, Ron, and Hermione been first-years, they likely would have tried their hand at cracking it. A few younger students certainly gave them curious glances as they jested with each other between classes.
Harry knew this as well and knew it was a losing game to try to stare Draco down. He started towards the door. “I need some air.”
“It’s the end of March,” Harry croaked. Malfoy frowned. He couldn’t see the connection to anything that happened during the war or prior. “Dobby died today,” Harry clarified.
Draco shook his head. “She’s my aunt,” he assessed the stability of the fence before resigning to choose a somewhat newer looking post to rest against, “I shouldn’t have been so surprised by the resemblance.” His corners of his eyes tightened, his gaze going far past the breeze strewn grazing land that he stared at. “Then again, most people have at least seen pictures of their relatives before.”
He had lost his appetite. The sun was already going down. Instead of waiting around for it to become a respectful hour to go to bed, he decided to just curl up and hope his mind would take pity on him and give him good dreams.
After they were finished up, Harry took their dirty plates to the kitchen to wash them. Malfoy perched himself on one of the barstools to watch and continue their previous conversation as he had the night before when Harry was cooking. Harry knew he could clean everything up in a snap with his wand – he spent enough time in the Weasley household to know a few cleaning spells – but he wasn't ready to leave yet.
Hermione studied Ron’s expression for a long moment, and Harry was surprised to find that it was awfully similar to how Malfoy analyzed him. Ron felt her stare and merely gave a small shrug. She gushed out an exasperated sigh then turned back to Harry. Her eyes studied him for only half a second before she leaned over the table to take his hands. “If there is any sign that he is up to something, then you have to tell us. You can’t cover for him. We will help you.”
Draco stepped closer until he was right in front of Harry. When Harry only kept blinking at him, he reached down and grabbed his hand. Harry let him pull him to his feet then lead him to the couch. He wasn't really sure what to think. He felt like a passenger in his own body.
Harry took the cup, looking at the man with narrowed eyes. “Yeah, right. I’ve been here enough to know that’s not true.”
Draco blinked once, then turned and watched the professor walk away towards a group of Gryffindors. He couldn’t recall the last time he’d earned house points. He almost forgot that it was something that was still going on. It was hard to believe there was ever a time that house points had been so important to him.
Pansy left after a cup of tea which Draco forced her to drink to calm her down. She continually apologized to Draco about letting it get out but of course he didn’t blame her; if she’d been the one to leak the story then she wouldn’t have included herself and Heather in the pictures. Draco offered to let her stay the night so she wouldn’t have to be home when her mother got the paper but she had the feeling the men needed some alone time.
Harry rolled his eyes. He looked around. "Where's the remote?" When all he got back was a confused look from Malfoy, he began to motion pressing a button with his thumb. "The controller, what you used to turn it on before?"
A pout formed on his lips. “All of it?”
Pansy’s mouth fell into a perfect, dark red ‘O’.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Okay…”
Draco licked his drying lips. “How did you deal with leaving your family?”
Harry swallowed down the ball in his throat. “No, sir, that won’t be necessary. I’m sorry for my behavior.”
“Yeah, I got hurt. I’m better now. Let me work.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’m fine. I just went around the corner.” Harry’s well-tuned eyes saw differently. Draco’s fingers were trembling as he pulled the containers of food out. There was no sign of distress on his face other than a slight crease in his brow. His anxiety was likely still working its way out of his system.
Malfoy jumped to his feet and rushed over to examine the stove. "This has to be magic," he muttered, hovering his hand over the warming stovetop.
Harry Potter was Draco’s boyfriend. Draco was glad Harry closed the door because that meant he couldn’t see Draco grinning to himself like a madman. After all of these years of pain and isolation, Draco had assumed he would never be happy again. He had completely given up on the notion of finding someone to spend his life with. He assumed that just wasn’t for people like him. Death Eaters didn’t get happy endings. No one else seemed to think he should get one and they made sure to tell him.
This time it was Ron who lunged forward. “You’re lying. They were friends in school. Why would he do that to Malfoy?”
Draco spun around to grab the last pillow on the bed and launch it at Harry, who quickly ducked. “That’s not what I meant.”
“It’s not even that bad,” Malfoy insisted though he began to untuck his shirt. “Snape did the best that he could.”
Harry was honestly confused. Did he mean move? Once again, it seemed like an easy thing to clarify. Instead, he kept glaring.
He didn't get far. Draco launched himself forward, grabbing Harry's wrist. "Harry, please. You're in no state to be out there. Just sleep a few hours.
The warm smile on Zabini’s mouth flashed with wickedness as quickly as the shade in his eyes darkened. “Fight like Draco did? Oh no, wait, he didn’t even have the brains to walk away.”
“Shouldn’t you be apologizing to me for earlier?”
“Who had March in the pool?” Susan asked.
"Cappuccino and," Harry clicked the roof of his mouth with his tongue as he examined the menu, "a ham and swiss."
He batted away her accusing finger. “I also told you that I started letting him in and that we occasionally had dinner and shopped together.”
Draco shrugged and let out a small hum, but in it, Harry could almost hear the words,
“Right, you work at the Prophet,” Harry said. “Do you have any idea where they are getting their information? Half of what they’re releasing isn’t supposed to be on public record.”
“To—play—quidditch,” Harry said very slowly, earning a deathly glare. “I thought that was obvious.”
Draco’s steps were slow, but he eventually made it to the entryway. “He should have thought about that before. I tried to help him. He wouldn’t accept it.”
“We know,” Ron and Hermione chorused.
“Nothing, it’s only…” This was clearly a sensitive subject. He had to choose his words carefully. “Things seem to have
They sat down to eat. The whole time consisted of Draco being a flustered mess while Harry smugly watched, feigning ignorance.
The image of Malfoy's wide, overly bright eyes and the utter relief across his whole body when he'd opened the door was still lingering in Harry's mind. He didn't realize how much he'd scared the other man.
“No, no!” Ron exclaimed. “No details, please.”
"Like a preservation spell?"
“Yes, well, some of us don’t need to have our nose in a book twenty-four seven. I swear one day I’m going to look over, and you’ll be sleeping with one on your head.”
Harry sat up. “She did?”
To Harry’s dismay, Draco removed his head to look at Harry’s face. He was analyzing. Before he could overthink too much, Harry pulled on a mischievous smile then let his weight fall back.
“Do I deny it?”
Draco reached towards the handle. His hand trembled. This could be some sort of trap. Ron just wanted him to open the door, so he could attack him again. He wouldn’t be the first. He had a wand, though, and the wards weren’t that strong; he could break down the door if he really wanted to. Draco opened the door.
Draco Malfoy was standing in front of him. In Hawaii. In a resort in Hawaii and he's wearing a shirt similar to Harry and white linen pants. He had a blue lei around his neck and a drink in his hands.
"I'm sorry I didn't get you something that beautiful. I only got you chocolates." Harry sat back down in front of Draco.
"Ellie definitely found her match," Jane smiled, saying exactly what Harry had thought when he met the two.
"I'm still trying to live with it you know? The guilt. I'm getting therapy but it's still a lingering feeling and I know I deserve it but it doesn't make it hurt less."
Teddy grinned triumphantly, his missing front teeth showing. "Make it three and we have a deal."
"Holy shit," Harry panted. He held Draco up as he slowly slid out of him, watching his own come drip out of his fluttering hole and down his legs.
He made his way towards the table, smiling when Malfoy noticed him walking towards them. The group was sitting on the opposite side of where they sat down a few nights ago.
"What's this?" Ron asked picking up a note to do the same.
Margot was very friendly and Harry could see that Jane wasn't quite chatty but she always jumped in the conversation whenever she could. But she mostly sat back in her chair and listened to her fiance interrogate Harry, a fond look on her face that Harry could only describe as love.
"You didn't answer my question."
"Yes," Harry said at the same time Malfoy answered, "No."
Lionel double-checked both of their tanks, instructing them to take two sips from the regulator to make sure that the air is on. He then helped them fix their gear properly, telling them he would be right there on the boat whenever they decided to come up.
smut smut smut. lmao just a warning in case you want to skip to the end.
"Hey, Mimi. I bought you some sweets." Harry said, setting down the bag on the counter.
"Aloha, Mr. Potter," A nice lady in a floral dress greeted him as soon as the elevator doors opened, and put a lei around his neck. Harry thanked her and bumped into another woman, who handed him a blue drink.
"And?" Malfoy looked at him, raising his brow.
"I asked the hotel staff to pack me some light food. I figured we'd get hungry after swimming."
Songs mentioned in this chapter are:
He handed out sweets to every student in the class, mindful of all their allergies. That afternoon, Harry went home covered in glitter and carrying a bag full of sweets. After making a quick change of his clothes, he decided to stop at the coffee shop for about an hour before going to pick teddy up from Andromeda's for the weekend. He brought a small bag of sweets for Mimi, making sure they were all muggle.
He pumped hard as he thrust in and out of him, biting his neck and his back and anywhere he can get his lips and teeth on. "I'm close," Harry moaned.
Potter raised his brow, "And you are?"
The thing is, he wasn't sure how they would react to him dating Draco Malfoy of all people, but if all went as well as Harry hoped, he would be telling his best friends soon.
"Just this park I found a few weeks ago. I come here to write on weekends it's really nice," Draco said as the two made their way inside the park.
"Is the Auror force kicking your arse?"
"It's not an engagement or wedding ring or anything like that," He said making Harry giggle. "I found it in Italy, during my first year there. The nice witch who sold it to me told me that the stone, Ametrine, is a combination of Amethyst and Citrine, which are two of the most powerful healing stones. I've been wearing it for the past few years and it centers me in a way and helped me heal a lot mentally. I was hoping it would do the same for you if you ever need it."
So, when he entered the changing rooms after a long and exhausting game, he first noticed how quiet it was.
The two moved around the water, imitating the fish and hiding behind the coral under the water. Potter swam next to him, turning his head when he spotted a large group of fish, Draco taking a mental picture of everything Potter did.
And then there were two.
He passed the picture to Potter. The man smiled at the picture before declaring that he should take one of Draco too.
Draco nodded, picking up half a sandwich to take a bite. When he felt Harry's eyes on him like they had been earlier. He turned towards him cocking his eyebrow a bit. "What is it now?"
," Ellie rolled eyes for what seemed like the hundredth time that night. "Be back to your room by ten o'clock sharp, or I will hunt you down, take you to the nearest island, and leave you stranded."
He apparated to their house and knocked on the door. Their house was much bigger than his and it made sense since they were a married couple with a baby. Harry peeked inside to see their window open and heard the cries of one-year-old Rose throughout the house. Harry assumed she was still teething and made a mental note to try and find something that could help with the pain.
"To us," The two said in unison.
I Was Born To Love You by Queen
Malfoy's eyebrow shot up, his lips twisting into a smirk, "I didn't realize you owned the state of Hawaii, Potter."
He stashed his wand away as soon as he moved, never really using it. He only did the occasional wandless magic around his house, and ever since he started fostering kids, he's used magic less and less, usually only when he visits his mother.
"You look so good like this," Harry's lips reached for his earlobe biting on it. "You have no idea."
He wasn't sure if they should be doing this with the spray still on but he didn't have the time to think or care if it felt uncomfortable. All he wanted to do was keep kissing Malfoy and get his hand around his prick.
Harry was speechless. He stared at the silver ring in his hands and at the man sitting in front of him in the form of Draco Malfoy. Was he dreaming?
"Hello Ellie," Harry chuckled, taking off the soaked sunglasses. "Just Harry."
After the war, he got an offer from Shacklebolt and didn't even think twice before accepting. He passed his NEWTs with flying colors and started training. Eight years later, he was an Auror and he wasn't really happy.
That's when he heard it. or him. A voice Harry could never and could never forget no matter how hard he tried to. A voice that terrorized him for most of his adolescent years.
Harry didn't like elevators. He preferred the constantly moving stairs at Hogwarts. But, this entire trip was about trying new things, so he sucked it up and ignored the weird motion sickness, and took the elevator down seventeen floors.
"Wow that's a long time," Harry breathed out, making the two laugh.
there's light smut in this chapter you'll know when it starts lol
Ellie wasn't like any of the other kids he's fostered. She was a loud and angry child, reminding Draco so much of himself at that age. With her mother in prison and her father walking out on them from the moment she was born, she had the justification for being so angry. Although their relationship may seem rocky to outsiders, Draco was dreading the day she actually found a family to adopt her.
Harry didn't think much of it and simply pocketed the small strip of paper.
"Describe perfect."
"Are you here alone?" He asked her.
"Ready as I'll ever be," Draco said, following Potter out of the lobby and into the fresh tropical air.
"Elizabeth!" Malfoy turned to her, "Surely I've taught you better manners than that."
"Yeah Draco," Ellie smirked. "Or I might say something. By accident of course."
Harry grinned and looked up at Draco who was biting his lips, a nervous tick Harry discovered he had, along with playing with strands of his hair. He opened the box and found a beautiful silver ring with a yellow and purple stone attached on top. Harry raised his brow curiously. A ring could mean a lot of things.
"Anything’s fine," Harry said, his voice muffled by the table underneath his face while quiet, relaxing music filled the room at a low volume.
Before he knew it, he found himself leaning forward. He did not doubt in his mind that Malfoy did too because their faces were not inches apart.
Friday came and Harry found himself sitting at his desk, completely surrounded by both muggle and magical sweets from his students and their parents, and some from his coworkers. He had a great day at work and was actually dreading Valentine's Day a little less.
The restaurant was lively. That was the only word Harry could think to describe it as he took a seat on a yellow chair. The tables were sound and each of them was filled with grinning people deep in conservation with whomever they were dining with.
About an hour after they received their food, Ellie had finished half of her pasta and all of her fries. "Can I go watch the luau now?" She looked at Malfoy with a pleading look in her eyes.
Harry hadn't seen him since he returned his wand shortly after the war. Malfoy had thanked him and apologized for terrorizing him in school. Harry waved it off and got an invitation to stay for tea at the Manor. The two had a short but civil conversation while avoiding the subjects of the war and Malfoy's dead father. Harry then went home and never saw Malfoy again.
Harry's lips moved softly and slowly against Draco's. He was kissing Draco Malfoy. And Merlin was it amazing. Harry felt butterflies in his stomach. He felt the flowers in the park bloom into spring early as the wind whispered its own blessing into ears.
"Yes that's me," Harry said, standing up from the small couch.
"In a way, Yes."
Harry smiled. "It would be my pleasure. Thank you for the invite." He gave each a kiss on the cheek before bidding them good night.
Harry hollowed his cheeks before taking in as much as he could, wrapping his hand around the base where he couldn't reach. He was happy to learn he didn't have a gag reflex. The water sprayed on his back as he bobbed his head. The noises Malfoy were making were absolutely sinful.
"Yes! Yes yes yes!" Harry sank to the floor before Draco could get up, he tackled the man in a hug before cupping his face and slamming their lips together. "Yes," Harry sobbed, pulling Draco closer.
Draco had gotten used to them by now. Telling Jane and Margot and the few guys he's slept with that it was the work of a rabid family cat from when he was younger. No one questioned him and he'd never really minded or felt insecure about them. But Potter, he looked guilty.
Ginny came home for a weekend, the first time Harry had seen her in over a month apart from floo calls and letters. Harry greeted her in the kitchen. She hugged him and grabbed his hands and said, "I want a divorce."
Harry moaned at the feeling of being enveloped by the tight wonderful heat.
"Oh!" Potter exclaimed, shuffling to sit back up before reaching for his bag. "I actually do. Mione gave it to me to take pictures."
Potter nodded, already halfway through taking off his wetsuit. "Yeah, everything went great. You, Draco?"
"Thank you, Haku," Harry suddenly remembered what Hermione said about tipping the hotel staff and reached in his pocket pulling out the muggle cash he had converted from galleons and handed a twenty to the man.

"Promise me you'll enjoy yourself, okay?" Hermione bit her lip and gave him a small smile.
But now in his eight-year, he's noticing Malfoy, of all people. And it was so hard
Harry laughed at the comment. He definitely always enjoyed his time at Lively Cafe.
"Secret admirer?" Malfoy raised his brow, "Merlin, is that what you think?"
Harry tried his best not to snort at the interaction between the two.
Harry snorted, getting up from the stool. "Goodbye, Mimi. I'll see you tomorrow."
Malfoy's head snapped up, arching his brow in confusion, "Uh I'm having breakfast with Ellie and the brides, then I'm free all day I think," He said before quickly adding. "Why?"
"Can I get the chocolate cake?" He heard Ellie ask.
Instead of a verbal answer, Harry showed her the book cover he was reading. A memoir about a young girl and her dysfunctional American family. Ellie moved closer, eying the book before nodding.
Harry was surprised no one had walked in on them but he also thanked the gods. Months and weeks spent admiring the blond git from afar and he finally had him.
Everyone had already left and Harry was happy he would get the showers to himself. It wasn't that he didn't like changing in front of people but he would prefer it that way. He made his way towards his cubby to take off his quidditch uniform.
"Let's do it," The two hugged and cried and kissed and spent the entire night curled up in their bed reminiscing their Hogwarts days and their new prospective futures.
The two got together right after the war. Ginny moved in with him at Grimmauld place and the two spent that entire summer renovating the place as a nice distraction from everything. They built a home together and Harry was genuinely happy. Right after Hogwarts, Ginny got an offer to play for the Cannons and started traveling, completely severing the bond they spent that year building.
Harry tried not to visibly frown as he walked towards his usual table the next day, only to find it completely empty. He sat down, still unable to mask his disappointment. He read his book and drank his coffee while one question filled his mind.
Harry hummed, "I met your friends."
He stayed for dinner at the Weasley household, spending some much need quality time with Rose and catching up with the pair. Ron and Hermione had eloped a year after leaving Hogwarts. and Rosie came a few years later. Harry wasn't one who really believed in soulmates but if they existed, then his best friends were soulmates.
"No, I don't. And it's okay because I don't really need one," Harry tried his best to explain to the seven-year-old why he was happily single.
In the middle of the room standing with a single rose in his hands was his boyfriend Draco Malfoy.
"Suck me," Malfoy pulled away. Harry didn't have to be told twice. He got down on his knees on the cold shower tiles and shivered when Malfoy wandlessly cast his clothes and glasses away.
He got off the bed and headed to the en suite bathroom to do his nighttime routine. Once he was done, he climbed into his bed, deciding to read a few more chapters of his book.
Malfoy exited the elevator on the fourteenth floor and Harry accepted a dinner invitation for the next day at seven, to meet his friends Margot and Jane.
"Oh yeah?" Draco panted.
Harry looked at Malfoy who looked unsure of what to say or do. "You can join me if you want. I could use the company." Malfoy stared at him. Harry's cheeks flushed at the possibility of being rejected. He already accepted his fate when he heard Malfoy say "Okay."
"Bloody hell. Are you lying?"
He opened the door to his cottage and smiled when the warm air hit his face, catching a whiff of cinnamon. He took off his shoes, then his coat, hanging it on the coat rack near the door. He jumped when he felt something near his foot and chuckled when he saw the calico kitten nudging at his show on the floor.
Harry pulled back with a smile, staring at Draco's closed eyes before gently pecking his nose. Draco's giggled as he opened his eyes and Harry's heart skipped a beat.
Harry thought about it for a second, "Not really, no. It just kinda happened. I guess it's what was expected of me."
"I tell everyone I got mauled by a cat."
"I'm asking you to marry me," Draco said softly, leaving forward to kiss Harry's cheeks before bring up his thumb to wipe away the tears.
"Or downright creepy," Ron chimed in.
"Everyones going to lose their shit when we tell them."
They walked on the hot sand for a few minutes until they reached the boat. A small middle-aged man, who Draco assumed was Lionel, waved at them with one hand and the other on his hips.
"Hermione recommended this place," Harry said, taking a sip of his very fruity drink. "I just got a divorce so why not a vacation."
"Harry's a cop," Ellie answered for Harry before he could.
Malfoy chuckled and pushed a loose strand of hair back in his bun, "She's been going through a tough time so she gets to be angsty once in a while. Plus, so were we at that age."
"That's it?"
Harry listened as Malfoy talked passionately about what he loved to do and Malfoy listened to him talking about his job, asking questions about Teddy, obviously wanting to get to know his little cousin more.
Growing up, he'd traveled to many exotic places. He spent countless holidays at his family's villa in Italy. He'd dined on the Eiffel Tower and once swam with actual dolphins in Ibiza. But never had he been to Hawaii or anywhere in the states. He didn't know what to expect.
He and his mother moved back to England a few weeks ago because she wanted to get closer to her sister. Draco agreed to move back with her and he'd been spending most of his time in the muggle world to get away from the scrutiny of the daily prophet if they ever found out he was back.
Draco listened attentively as Lionel explained the process. He helped each of them with their tanks to ensure proper functions.
"That's good. They liked you too. You got the lesbian stamp of approval."
"Oh, can we Ellie Please? You'd look so adorable."
"He has our gear. He's going to explain everything once we get there but we're getting our tanks ready first, then change into our wetsuits on the boat on our way to the diving spot." Draco simply nodded, reflecting on how relatively nice it was being around him when they weren't trying to bite each other's heads off.
"Have fun Harry, call if you need anything," Luna smiled before hugging him goodbye. Harry flooed back to his own house. He took out his wand and cast a Tempus charm. It was currently only 4 PM meaning he had an hour to get ready before Draco came to pick him up.
"So," she started, taking off her sunglasses and laying them on her stomach while she laid on her back in the pool chair. "What do you do, Harry?"
"It's alright, I ordered for you guys," Jane smiled, and Draco returned it thanking her. He trusted her to get something he liked.
"I get it," Harry said sadly. "She doesn't wanna lose hope."
"What made you start leaving the notes?"
Harry blinked, not really knowing how to answer Teddy's question. "I guess it would be nice. But I'm happy with just you in my life," Harry smiled. Teddy beamed at the statement and reached forward to kiss his cheek. "See? I get kisses from you!" Harry laughed pulling the boy into a hug.
People walking alongside the water, some hand in hand, some with families and others alone. There was a seating area near the pool, an outdoor bar, and what looked like a restaurant. Harry took a sip of his drink and decided he couldn't finish the drink without at least eating something.
The two talked for a few more minutes and Harry told Hermione about his plans to go to the spa the next day until the line fell dead and Harry was back wallowing in the silence of his hotel room.
"No no nothing like that. He lives in a muggle neighborhood now. Rarely uses magic. He's changed a lot but, I guess, but so have we, right?"
"Malfoy," he breathed. Surely the drink he was handed wasn't that strong, he couldn't be hallucinating.
"I think I do."
Draco sighed, throwing the heavy duvet off him before making his way to the bathroom. He got started with his morning routine, still doing everything at the hotel that he would do at home, even though he had to leave most of his facial products back home at the expense of his suitcase being too heavy.
He quickly walked towards Harry who was still standing the doorway and took harry's hands in his.
Draco followed Lionel's exact instructions and placed the air source in his mouth taking two more sips of air before taking a giant step into the water. Potter soon followed and soon they were under the clear blue water.
"Fuck," Harry had never heard him curse before and that one word stirred something inside him.
"Again," she said, finally getting up from the pool chair. "I had no way of knowing the time."
Draco laughed, throwing a large green grape at Potter, the fruit colliding with his glasses. "We don't talk about that."
They laughed, Malfoy nudged his side gently and their arms rubbed together raising goosebumps on Harry's side.
"Hey, Harry," Mimi smiled.
"Are you all ready to order?" she smiled, flipping the notepad in her hand and scribbling something down while she waited for them to place their order.
Draco arched his back as Harry watched the way his cock eased in and out of him. Draco's ass was deep. Deep and hot. He pumped in and out, afraid he would be told to hurry up once again. Draco didn't say anything for several minutes; he whined and whimpered as he moved his hips back meeting each one of Harry's thrusts.
"I do. I'll eat anything if I'm honest, but this looks delightful. Thank you," Draco smiled as he bit into a strawberry. The juice trickled down from his lips to his chin and Harry couldn't look away at the bright red contrast against the white pale face.
"Hi," She said again with a smile. "Whatcha doing?"
"Shut up, Potter," Draco giggled pulling Harry towards the water. They stood under the spray, letting the cold water wash them.
He heard a pause. "Right," Ron answered. "Well, stay safe mate, and keep in touch," It wasn't much but Harry would take it.
He couldn't see her eyes but Draco would bet anything she was rolling her eyes behind the sunglasses. She took a seat next to him across from Margot and muttered a "morning" to the two.
"Here are your menus. Let me know when you're ready to order," A waitress came to their table and set down three large laminated menus in front of them.
"No, she does not," Malfoy smiled. "So you're here alone?"
Harry nodded, giving in to his godson. "Now let's clean up this mess that you made you little monster," Harry reached forward, taking the glitter from Teddy before picking up the boy in one swift move, throwing him over his shoulder. Teddy squealed and giggled, asking to be put down but Harry refused until they reached the living room, tossing him softly on the blue sofa.
"You're very bright for your age," Harry chuckled.
"You should kiss my cousin Draco. He's nice and wants someone to kiss too," Teddy said with a shrug and went back to pick up more paper from Harry's rug.
Harry loved it. He relished in the fact that he the one was making Draco feel this good. Harry was close so he reached around and replaced Draco's hands with his own as he pumped Draco's cock himself, milking it.
"Harry has a date," Teddy grinned proudly looking up at his godfather.
"We're engaged," Draco repeated Harry's words. "Happy Valentine's Day, my beautiful Fiancé."
"No," he shook his head slowly. "Not since we defeated him." Potter looked down at Draco's chest. He had the same look he had earlier when he first saw the marks.
Baby Rose smiled on Harry's lap as she reached for his curls. Her cheeks were red and puffy, a definite sign she had been crying. Harry lets her tug on his hair softly, while he turned his attention back on Hermione and Ron.
Harry's knees buckled.
Hawaii was everything and nothing he had expected. It was so sunny -- definitely, a huge contrast to the gloomy London skies Harry had always been used to.
"Y-yeah," he stuttered before shaking his head quickly. "Yes, everything went great Lionel thank you so much."
"Or boyfriend?" Jane piped in and Harry almost missed the look on Malfoy's face.
"Harry, do you have someone you love?" Teddy asked Harry while the two were picking up the pink and red paper scraps from the living room floor.
Making a mental note to call Hermione later that night to tell her he arrived, Harry took that much anticipated and needed nap.
"She is. No magic talk."
"Well, he's blond," She said.
Potter threw his head back in laughter. Draco watched his chest move up and down and his arms flex as they leaned back on the boat supporting the rest of his body. Why was he so fit?
He trailed his fingers down Malfoy's crack and hovered it above his hole, slowly sliding his thumb in and decided that Malfoy was indeed loose enough to take him. The thought of those pale long fingers buried inside himself made Harry's cock twitch.
Ron answered the door and grinned when he saw Harry. "Hi mate! Come in," He stepped aside letting Harry inside his house.
Harry looked over at Malfoy, "I take it she doesn't like makeup?"
"Malfoy?"
"Did you always want to be a cop?" she asked.
"He quite likes being alone," Malfoy repeated to Mimi. He didn't look like he wanted to be in this situation no more than Harry did.
The song mentioned in this chapter are:
"Please undress to your comfort level and then relax face down under the sheets. I'll be right outside. Let me know when you're ready," She smiled before leaving the room and closing the door behind her.
Harry laughed, "What other Malfoy is there, Mione?"
The two ate dinner together and Harry cleaned up his kitchen while Hermione packed some food to take home with her since Harry was leaving the next day and wasn't coming back for fourteen days.
His and Ginny's marriage was doomed from the beginning. Harry always knew he preferred men yet he couldn't bring himself to end it. She was all he knew and it was selfish but he didn't want to lose that familiarity. That safety net he built for himself. But it was never fair to Ginny.
Six years later, Harry felt pressure from everyone in Ginny's family to propose. He did, she said yes, they married a year later only to divorce after just three short months.
"Hi, hello," Harry said, suddenly feeling nervous. These were Malfoy's best friends and he wanted to make a good impression. For what reason? He didn't quite know yet. "I'm Harry," he reached his hand out for the brunette to shake but she got up and hugged him instead.
and not
The pool itself was filled with people -- mostly screaming children. But most of the chairs were empty. Harry found one on the side, in the shade, and laid on top of it while swapping his regular glasses for sunglasses.
"I'm Draco Malfoy. I'm good at everything."
Harry was about to stop her but he couldn't help but smile when he heard his other best friend's name over the phone. "Yeah? You alright?"
"Okay, I'm sorry. Please continue."
Malfoy smirked and pulled Harry back up, kissing him hard. "Be my guest," He whispered against Harry's lips, "I prepped earlier but you're welcomed to check."
"They kept making googly eyes at each other last night," She said, taking off her sunglasses. "And yes, it was disgusting."
Harry didn't tell them about the notes, not sure if there was even anything to tell yet.
Lionel laughed, "Glad you guys had fun. Did everything go smoothly with your gear?
Malfoy rested a hand on his hip and rubbed his temple with the other one. "I swear that girl will be the death of me," he sighed.
Hermione visibly tensed but smiled as she passed him the plate with a nod. "Yeah, he says have a safe trip."
The park was really nice -- well kept but not crowded. Harry smiled as he walked alongside Draco and pondered whether or not to take the man's hand in his. Their fingers were brushing past each other as they walked. The whole scene was so cliche and Harry held his breath, reaching out and intertwining their hands.
It was a nice day outside, it felt and looked like spring, nothing like the dreadful weather in England, and Harry was thankful for that. Outside was crawling with people but it didn't feel a bit crowded.
"You're taking pictures of me?"
Waking up the next morning, the previous night felt like a dream to Draco but it wasn't. Potter was there in all his glory. The bird's nest on his head somehow got bigger and Draco wanted nothing more than to run his hands through it.
But Malfoy had other plans.
Malfoy turned around and the first thing Harry noticed was his cock. All angry and red and completely enveloped by his hands.
The waves of the ocean mixed with the music playing at the restaurant behind them were just background noise. He stared at Malfoy's perfect face in the dim lighting. From his pointy perfect nose to his beautiful grey eyes and perfectly threaded eyebrows, to his perfect pink lips.
The two sat on the deck facing each other, the small spread of fruits and finger sandwiches in between them while they stared out into the water.
After arguing with Malfoy about who would pay the bill, Harry reluctantly let him agree to pay because Malfoy claimed the bill would go on the wedding party's tab. The two left the restaurant and started walking towards the beach. Harry was already regretting the fact that he wore open-toe shoes.
He was okay with it though. A lot of single people say they're happy being single but Harry honestly was. Between his work and looking after his godson, Teddy, he hardly had the time to date. Especially since he rarely left the Wizarding World and everyone there just so obviously wanted him for his fame.
and he found it.
Harry looked at Malfoy and shrugged, "I don't mind if you don't. I'm here alone anyways. I could use the company."
Valentine's Day that year actually fell on a weekday so all the festivities would happen during school, which harry was glad for. His heart swelled anytime one of his students would bring him sweets. He also passed some out to all of them like he does every year to make sure no one ever went home empty-handed. Overall, he definitely grew to like the holiday more and more each year.
Ellie adjusted her towel and turned to look at Harry, "It was nice talking to you Harry," She smiled at him before going back inside.
"Hey," Malfoy smiled.
Both Jane and Margot beamed, raising their glasses. Harry raised the orange cocktail he was drinking, and Ellie, her apple juice. "To Jane and Margot."
He wore grey muggle slacks and a button-up shirt and he still towered over Harry by a few inches. His eyes widened when they finally made eye and Harry could've sworn he heard a gasp escape the man's mouth.
"I wanted to go scuba diving tomorrow. But I'm all alone and I might drown." Harry shrugged.
As he ate alone at his small kitchen table, he contemplated getting a cat.
"I'm-" he pulled away.
Jane snickered, "Leave the poor girl alone, Draco."
When he had heard about his divorce to the Weasley girl, he told himself he couldn't care less what the Wizarding World's golden boy was up to, but now, after seeing him, a small part of him secretly hoped Harry was queer.
"He always leaves before I come in?"
"I love you," Harry smiled when the boy giggled, "And your Grandma Andy, and Uncle Ron, and Aunt Hermione. I love a lot of people."
“Who knows,” he murmured. “Piers runs his mouth like his life depends on it, he’s probably got a whole story cooked up, whether it’s true or not doesn’t matter. He and Vince have at least told everyone we – they know that I’m gay. You’ve heard them, they don’t need much in the way of proof to believe it.” He let out a sharp exhale that was meant to be a laugh. “They’re probably telling people you turned me gay. Like I needed any help in that department.”
“Good night, Malfoy.”
“The truth is,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper, “you don’t choose it. You just know that you’re not like everyone else. For me, it never really mattered until – well. Until I met Harry. Not you, obviously, my – er – it sounds weird to say it, but my Harry.” Draco huffed out a laugh. “He was never mine, though. Unlike you, he never was – at least, I don’t think, although maybe, he never said, never… Anyway. Erm. The first time I met him, we were, er, getting fitted for our school uniforms, and he was just this… scruffy looking kid, but for some reason, I really wanted to impress him. I wanted to be his friend, but he didn’t, and we very quickly became enemies. As we got older, though, I realised that there was something else. All the boys were talking about girls, all the girls were talking about boys, and I… all I could think about was Harry. But of course, that was never an option.”
He would lay awake until past midnight, toss and turn for a few hours and snatch fragments of restless sleep, only to wake up just before dawn without any hope of going back to sleep. This wasn’t anything new – he had been dealing with insomnia in one form or another all his life. These days, when he woke up, he would sneak down to the common room, wrapped in his bathrobe, and settle into the window seat to watch the sun rise over the grounds. He had accidentally startled a house elf cleaning the ashes from the grate the third or fourth morning he had done this. In the end the elf, Gerald, started bringing cups of tea for him to drink.
Draco harumphed and extracted himself from Harry’s arms. “Oh, no,” he said, making his way towards the living room and the awaiting fireplace. “I spent far too much time on all this just to stay in. You’re just going to have to wait.”
“Bloody hell.”
“That’s an impressive bit of magic,” said Draco, handing the map back. Harry placed it on top of a folded cloak on the bench behind them. Draco suspected that it wasn’t his school cloak, not the way it shimmered in the silver light.
“What would I know about?”
Harry set up the wards around the room before turning off the lights and trying to get comfortable on the cot bed. He didn’t trust his transfiguration abilities enough to make any adjustments. He remembered all the times he’d slept in a bed just like this one, but could not remember how he had ever fallen asleep on one.
“That bad, huh?”
“We’re wizards, you gorgeous dolt.” He pulled out his wand from his pocket and cast a Warming charm around them, enclosing them in a bubble of warmth.
Harry scoffed and rocked back on his heels. He stuffed his hands in the pockets of his leather jacket. He raked his eyes up and down Malfoy’s form, or what he could see of it from the waist up. His hair was brushed back off his forehead, a faint blush lingered on his high cheekbones, his black apron was covered in coffee grounds, and the sleeves of his cotton button down were rolled up to the elbows. Harry frowned.
Harry’s frown deepened. Ron always got sentimental after watching
“Well,” Potter continued, jabbing his pen at his note, “I bet they’re getting them from this market for cheap. How else would they be able to produce so much of the potion without a large stock of the stuff? And they couldn’t replace it with anything because you said it was one of the few ingredients they couldn’t swap out, right? So….”
Draco turned and caught Harry’s lips with his just to be sure. Harry grabbed hold of the front of his shirt, pulled him impossibly closer, licking up into Draco’s mouth. The kiss was slow and deep, exploring the sensation of lips against teeth against tongues. Then Draco pulled away, kissed along the line of Harry’s jaw, nipping his teeth along the line of his neck, making Harry gasp out a moan. He pulled at Harry’s jumper. Harry didn’t hesitate in taking it off and tossing it into a corner. Draco pushed him back towards the bed, a predatory glint in his eye as Harry, grinning, backed up until his knees hit the bed and he stumbled onto the mattress with a yelp. Draco snickered. Harry scowled, but then Draco was crawling on top of him, straddling his hips as he pushed him back into the mattress.
“Stop,” Draco whispered, the tears beginning to spill down his cheeks. But Harry pressed on.
“Draco? Are you there?”
? Your vegetables are burning.”
Pansy threw up her hands in exasperation. “Because you are fucking miserable, you prick!” she exclaimed. “When you’re not working, you’re home, by yourself, and when you’re not doing that, you’re getting drunk off your tits and having lousy one night stands that make you even more miserable than before! You’re not happy, Draco. You haven’t been in a really long time. So I’m sorry for trying, alright? But don’t you dare come crawling to me for help when you realise the best thing for you is about to go back to fucking Scotland thinking that the love of his life is better off without him.”
Madam Pince, who had been re-shelving books a couple shelves away, poked her head around a bookcase to shush them. They both sheepishly bent their heads over their work. Harry glanced over at Hermione, only to find her scribbling on a piece of spare parchment. He frowned. A couple minutes later, she shoved the parchment across the table to him. He took it, his frown deepening as he read.
“I’m afraid I can’t tell you that,” he said. “Not until his next of kin’s been notified.”
Harry didn’t know how to deal with a crying Malfoy. The last time he had, Malfoy had tried to curse him. But the man had just lost his parents, and Harry did know how to deal with that.
“And I like the crusts off.”
He could see it all. A letter written in green spidery ink, a giant of a man leading him down a bustling street, a dusty shop as a wizened old man handed him a wand made of holly, a castle ancient and familiar. A turban unravelling, a gilt mirror in a shadowy room, a blank diary with the name T.M. Riddle embossed in gold, a bloody fang. A gaunt man with matted hair, a flaming goblet, dragons and mermaids with rusted tridents, a boy dead at his feet. A toad-faced woman in horrifying shades of pink, rows upon rows of milky crystal balls, a behemoth of a snake, an old man with kind eyes and silver hair tumbling off a tall tower. A ring, a locket, a cup, a diadem, a sword at the bottom of a lake. Draco, kneeling before him, fear in his grey eyes as he said, “No, I can’t, I can’t be sure.” And always, always, a green light, blood red eyes, and a high, cold laugh.
Ron snorted. “Yeah, right.”
Draco shrugged, cradling the book in his lap. “I quite like Tolkien,” he said, a defensive edge to his words. “Pansy, of all people, came across this set while in Paris last winter, from that little shop, Shakespeare and Co. Sent it over as a Christmas and a ‘Congratulations You’re Out of Azkaban’ present.” His lips tilted into a soft smile as his fingers traced a pattern into the clothbound cover. “I read them all in the span of a month. Then I got the rest of his works and read them as well. Mother teased me about it, said she’d never seen me read so much in my life.” He chuckled, but the laugh faded even as it left his mouth. “The stories gave me hope,” he said, mostly to himself, and blushed. He put the book away in his messenger bag, refusing to even glance in Potter’s direction. But then he heard,
“Didn’t you hear him? There isn’t any other way!” Draco snapped. He pulled his hand from Harry’s grip. Harry frowned, stubborn.
“You’d better,” Ron finally managed to choke out. “What the bloody hell was that about?”
“Is this?” Harry asked. “A date, that is?”
“I had been about to give up hope when an acquaintance told me he knew of someone who might have a supply of powdered Erumpent horn, and I’ll be honest, I was pretty desperate at this point. My client had said he needed the potion by the end of the month and if I couldn’t get it, he would find someone who could, and honestly, I can’t lose another client. It’s hard enough to be a freelance Potion Master, but trying to be a freelance Potion Master as an ex-Death Eater? Doesn’t matter what I do, people still don’t trust me. Anyways, I was at this dinner party Blaise was hosting – you remember Blaise? Zabini, yeah, that one. He’s doing pretty well for himself. So he’s having this dinner party, yeah? And I’m bemoaning to Pansy – Parkinson, yeah, we’re quite close – about how hard it is to find powdered Erumpent horn and this guy – I don’t even remember his name really, I think it was Murphy Evans or something, his initials were M.E. anyway, that’s how he signed his letters – he says he might know someone who could get me powdered Erumpent horn. We exchange details, and by the end of the week, he’s set up a meeting with this Ivanovich guy.
He didn't get out of the way before Harry leaned back and crushed him into the back of the sofa again. This was even less uncomfortable than before for both of them. Harry ignored the feeling of Malfoy's shoulder pressing against his spine and pushed back more.
,” pressed Ron, who was once again somehow catching on before Harry, “we’ve known you for almost eight years now, and I can count on my hands how many stories from your childhood I’ve heard.”
"Late night again?" Ron asked, the nag of concern in his voice. That concern had been slowly growing lately whenever Ron or Hermione talked to him. It was pointless, though. He was fine.
“Wait! Come on, Malfoy,” Harry called though there was a certain amount derision in his tone that even Harry knew he wouldn’t have turned back for. Maybe this had been a mistake.
There were some nice things, of course. Saturday mornings at the English Rose Café were always pleasant. The same barista was always there and had taken to getting their usual orders of coffee and muffins prepared the moment they hit the door.
Molly hurried out of the house. While they waited, Harry bent down to Teddy’s level and listened to him explain why he placed each sprinkle where he had and the meaning behind the colors. Teddy took colors very seriously.
"God damn it, I can't tell you anything!" Harry grabbed the pillow from behind him to smack Draco.
“Probably.”
The boy remained stiff for only a moment. His arms gradually wrapped around Harry as well. Rigid at first and then relaxing, until his fingers scratched into the fabric on his back and clung on. Draco buried his face away into the crook of Harry’s neck. Not seen, not heard, and yet Harry could feel a slight moister on his shoulder. He didn’t care. He began to rub soothing circles into his back and continued to play with his hair.
He felt elated at the sound of his name in a whisper. He was even more mesmerized by the way the pair of lips just above his thumb moved when saying it. He wondered what they’d feel like…
Harry slowly unlocked his jaw, allowing a slow exhale of breath. “Let’s go,” Harry huffed, ignoring Robards comment. “I want to go home.”
They pulled back instantaneously. The kiss had been short and simple, both of their minds still whirling from what they had both just felt. They stared blearily at one another, blinking through their hazy thoughts as they tried to guess what the other was thinking.
“I might have said some things,” he mumbled, fumbling with his cuticles.
Harry never actually cared what the man thought of him. If he could help it, he'd never see any of their faces again. But Vernon's and Petunia's constant badgering that they should all fit in still lingered deep inside him. Not to mention the very common schoolyard taunts in muggle schools —young kids throwing around the word 'gay' as an insult without really understanding the word yet.
Zabini sighed and rolled his eyes. He fluttered his hand over his shoulder as he made his way towards the door. “Be careful, Potter. Malfoy’s stink is difficult to get rid of once you’ve gotten too close.”
Harry scoffed, but his eyes became wide when Draco feigned consideration. His brow crinkled, and he tapped his chin in thought. “I guess I can stay,” he sighed like he’d finally been knocked down into persuasion.
He opened the door. The owl sored in and perched on the back of one of dining chairs. Draco untied the letter and the owl instantly flew off, not giving Draco a chance to respond. She did that on purpose. She knew he’d try to talk her away if she allowed it.
His shoulders loosened, and Draco began to feel relieved before Harry even nodded. Harry's jaw was still tight, but he let Draco guide him back to the dining table. He reheated the takeaway and sat to eat with Harry. It was a mostly quiet affair. Draco could still see Harry's wheels turning. He was barely keeping himself in his chair.
Harry took another large gulp of the drink, finally forcing the food down his cotton-filled throat. All the while, Malfoy was still watching him closely. Harry hoped this had ended the conversation, but deep down, he knew it hadn't.
Harry nodded solemnly. “You have a point there.”
He turned to put the glasses on the side table, not noticing that Harry had reached out to match his motion. However, instead of reaching for a pair of nonexistent glasses, his hand found Malfoy’s hair.
Draco had barely moved in his spot. Growing more and more annoyed that Harry wouldn't listen to him. "Can you stop scolding me for five seconds, or do you just not want to solve this case?"
A blissful smile was already beginning to slide over Harry’s lips. “Is that a yes?”
He snapped his head back, his brow still furrowed. “He’s clearly okay,” he gestured to where Harry was sitting up in the cot, “and he has his new mate to keep him company. We aren’t needed anymore.”
“Okay, let’s start.” Malfoy sat up very straight, giving himself an air of importance that reminded Harry of Hermione when she was about to tell him and Ron off. “First-year, you were the one sneaking around after curfew and got us detention.”
Draco shrugged. “Maybe both. I’ll throw in Pansy so she can write a nice piece on the madness of Harry Potter for the Prophet too.”
He was once again expecting some sort of serious response, but Harry could only smile. “Don’t worry, Malfoy. I forgave you a while ago, obviously, but I appreciate it,” he added quickly, seeing the downturn on the other boy’s face. “Besides, it wasn’t all you. My cousin’s been calling me gay since he learned the word―I’m not even sure he always knew what it meant. It doesn’t bother me.”
He was lifting the shirt up farther, examining the pale lines he had placed there almost two years ago now. Suddenly he couldn’t believe Malfoy had ever switched sides in the war. Why would he want to be near someone who did something like this to him?
"No luck with Macnair, I'm assuming," Draco spoke carefully. He remained in the bedroom doorway, not yet sure if this was a situation that required a door between them.
The curly-headed boy snapped his head back to look at Harry, nearly tripping on the final step. “You’re Harry Potter!” he exclaimed.
He wondered how far Draco had actually gotten. What if he was curled up in an ally having a panic attack? Harry had no way of contacting Kreacher to send after him. He could call Hermione, but Draco would skewer him if he let one of his friends see him like that. Not to mention how awkward of a conversation that would be with Hermione.
Neither noticed that they had missed lunch, but their stomachs made sure to call them inside by dinner time. Only once they were sitting, Harry remembered Draco had also skipped breakfast and began to feel guilty. He pushed platters towards him as they filled up their plates.
"Surprisingly not," Malfoy said. Harry started to feel dejected again, but he found the other man smiling softly down at his drink. The same expression grew on Harry's lips.
Malfoy looked at him curiously now. “Why
He tiptoed into the room, not closing the door to refrain from making any more sound. He moved quickly and silently to the other door across the room, not turning on the light until he had the door closed behind him.
Harry nodded. He hoped she was right. He really hated being in fights with his best friend. It always brought up bitter memories from their time in school. “Sorry for always putting you in the middle of things, ‘Mione.”
Malfoy’s eyes snapped open, and he glared at the dark wood grain. “You saved my life, you bastard, then you saved me from Azkaban,” he spat like Harry had done something insulting. “So don’t think for one second I’m going to stand around and let you wallow in self-hatred!”
Draco was still surprised by this. Longbottom’s new self-confidence was nearly unnerving. He was the same blithering idiot he’d always been, but he was not afraid to stand up for himself or others anymore.
"Er, I don't know, I threw it when it wouldn't shut up," Malfoy said honestly.
This night was no different from all the others, although he did consider grabbing the bottle of Fire Whiskey from the kitchen to nullify the pain in his leg before going to bed. If only he didn't have work the next day. It was tough to be an Auror with a hangover.
“He’s in love with him.” The whole room stopped breathing for a beat. Eyes moved slowly to the person who had spoken. It was Ginny.
While his tone caused Malfoy to flinch, he recovered quickly, pulling himself up to his full height and squaring his shoulders. “No.”
Draco pushed off of the railing and held out his cup to Harry. “Clean these then go get dressed,” he ordered. “Wear something presentable.”
Draco nodded slowly but there was still no emotion on his face. It drove Harry mad. “Dray,” he pressed softly. “You’re allowed to show me that you’re upset. You don’t have to hide from me.”
Harry straightened. That had woken him up a bit. He assessed the young man on the ground. He looked utterly pitiful, and it wasn't just his sorry state or the restraints; it was his whole demeanor. It was like the world had kicked him when he was down, and he just never felt like getting back up again.
The days went on, and Harry continued to answer questions. He even began to give information unprompted, although he always felt arrogant afterward. Why would anyone want to know what foods he liked or pitiful stories of his childhood? Nevertheless, each time he did this, Draco seemed to ease a fraction more.
“Oh, that’s excellent,” Hermione gushed. “I saw some advertisements for a new exhibit at the Natural History Museum. We should all go sometime.” She dropped her voice and leaned closer. “Ron could do with some culture. He thinks all muggles are like the ones from that office show he likes.”
There was a smirk playing on Harry’s mouth. “It is in my job description.”
Andromeda waved an absent hand. “Oh, you know the Weasleys love a party. Most of the order is here as well.” Suddenly, Harry was very happy that he hadn’t decided to invite Draco.
“Grimmauld?” Draco looked as if Harry was talking nonsense. “No, you hate it there. I can hold out. I’m used to this. I’ll put up some wards-“
Malfoy didn’t say a word as he rounded the couch and sat down beside Harry. He pulled his feet up and tucked into the far corner.
Draco re-read the letter several times. They were an eighth-year so he should have known they’d been involved in the Battle of Hogwarts. He knew better than to talk of his own experiences. Not many people could relate. It would be easy to figure out his identity.
Harry could feel Malfoy’s eyes on his back but did not turn, even as he spoke in his usual long draw, “No, thank you.”
"I thought you said it was a difficult poison to catch if you didn't know it well."
Harry shook his head, his tense jaw twitching. "It's okay. I should have listened to you. You said you didn't want to leave." Malfoy involuntarily hiccupped again. "I'm sorry," Harry realized he had yet to really apologize. "I should have thought about it. I would have been with you, though. I wouldn't let Skeres hurt you again."
“What are you on about? How do you know that?”
“Goodnight,” several people called after him, but no words left Harry’s mouth. He was oddly deflated.
When Sow returned an hour later, she coaxed Draco into helping her again. As they worked, Harry noticed Hermione checking the clock. “You can go home, I’ll be okay,” he assured her. “I’m sure Ron will be home by now.”
Zabini’s languid gaze moved back to Harry. “Privately,” he insisted once more.
“Fits?” Malfoy repeated carefully. None of that sounded like Harry, especially against a helpless house-elf. Another cold, slimy feeling ran down his body as his thoughts went to his father. He couldn’t be like that.
Harry rolled his eyes. “You know you actually may be able to beat me one day if you would just take one little risk.”
“My question first.”
Harry rolled his eyes. "Thanks."
A gentle smile curved her lips, but Draco swore he spotted something glittering in her pale eyes. “Not at all. They are quite real. Everyone knows it.”
Ron and Hermione were the only people of importance who might have had a problem with their friendliness. However, the most significant argument had come only once while the three were studying in the library.
She rolled her eyes. “Please, like you haven’t at least thought about it.”
Malfoy’s response was almost instant. “This arse is cold. Move closer.”
Malfoy started to turn back into his apartment.
Harry didn’t look up, now using his wand to heat up the brew. He shook his head. “Not until this damn camomile kicks in, and it never puts me all the way to sleep.”
“You know you can tell us if something’s going on, right?”
Draco’s head snapped up. Disappointment was spread thinly across the librarian’s face, her lips pursed as she glared at him. “Sorry,” he mouthed.
Draco paused as they passed his mother. “All right?” he asked her.
Hermione didn’t get a chance to argue. A green flame sparked in their fireplace only moments before Harry materialized in their sitting room.
Snow soon stuck to the ground of Hogwarts. Holiday cheer swept the castle in a tidal wave. Many were primarily excited to go home for the holiday break. Nevertheless, it was not coming quick enough for a few.
“Mum? What’s going on?”  Mrs. Skeres stopped pushing on the door. They all looked back to find Terry inching down the stairs behind her. The furrow in his brow smoothed when he spotted who was at the door. Harry tensed, expecting him to bolt, but instead he continued down the steps. “It’s okay, Mum. I was expecting this.”
Harry curled a finger under Draco’s chin; his eyes were trained hungrily on Draco’s lips like an animal looking at its next meal. “Probably not.”
Malfoy gave only a meager shrug, trying to concentrate more on his book. “I think he went down to the Slytherin dorms for the night. I don’t think he’s capable of going more than a week without a shag.”
Ron sat back. His lips pressed into a thin line. He tried to work this information through his mind. He’d defended Terry so much when the incident happened because he had understood what it felt like to lose a brother and also because he was biased against Draco. Now, he couldn’t ignore facts, and, whether he would admit out loud or not, he was beginning to believe in Draco. “I’ll pull his files. He should still be under monitoring and receiving counseling.”
Harry sat up just as quickly. “No, I didn’t say anything. They figured it out.”
All of this didn't outweigh the benefits of staying at the flat. Or maybe it did. He was staying there to get more restful sleep, which wasn't happening, but he was also there to help Draco, and it wasn't Draco's fault that Harry's mind hated him.
Malfoy’s smile had fallen away as well. “It was an experimental spell. He couldn’t fix all of it perfectly.”
“He also told me you weren’t cleared to go back to work and yet-“
For the first time, Harry truly connected all of the pain in his eyes. It was the guilt that ate at him each night when Harry had to hold him. The distant look when he became quiet for a few days. The self-torment when he didn’t eat.
The sun streamed into Harry's eyes. His sleepy brain assumed he'd crashed on Ron and Hermione's sofa again; he couldn't be in his own bedroom at Grimmauld, light usually avoided the windows of the townhouse as if it was magically inclined. The clinking sound in the kitchen was alarming, considering there was a fifty-fifty chance it was Hermione, which was never good.
Harry’s eyes snapped back to him. “It’s none of your business who I’m with.”
Draco looked stilted. He was well aware of Pansy’s issues with her mother. Pricilla Parkinson’s expectations for her daughter were what drove her to work for the Daily Prophet in the first place, in hopes to follow her mother’s footsteps as Editor in Chief. However, Pansy had always been content in the gossip columns or fashion commentary which wasn’t going to get her a promotion anytime soon. The woman also had an innate hatred for anything muggle.
"Do you need a healer?" Harry asked.
Harry gave a little snort and sat back, a pleasant hum in his chest. “Well, my offer stands from last night. Really, any night that you need it. You don’t even have to ask. I get it.”
Harry stomped away. He only went a few doors down before looking back again. He hoped once he was out of view, Malfoy would come out. For a moment, it looked like it would work. The handle clearly moved, but there was a pause and bounced back to its original position.
, Mr. Potter.”
Draco’s eyes fluttered open. “For being stupid.”
It wasn’t long before both boys were on the ground wrestling, both trying to make the other look as ruffled as possible and exceeding exponentially. Everyone soon began to realize they weren’t going to get a proper explanation for what was happening.
“Too!” Ron jumped to his feet. He searched Harry’s face for only a moment before accusing, “Bill’s the other one, isn’t he?”
"Are we offering it?"
can’t keep up with something?” Ron pressed, his eyes wide. He looked back at Harry. “See what you and Malfoy have done? You’ve broken her.”
Malfoy stared at the clock. If Macnair hadn’t done it by now, then he likely wouldn’t do it at all. He would want the body to be found on the anniversary day; that wouldn’t happen if he waited too late.
Reluctantly, Draco went along with the distraction. They decided on Indian food, and Harry went off to collect it.
Harry didn’t respond. He continued to grind his teeth, dropping his eyes away.
“You rather liked your name being associated with mine at the beginning of this year.”
They both turned away from the laughter and yelps going on among the trees and continued their walk.
The cake was cut and served to waiting hands. Knowing that it was likely rude to dash off before he even tried the cake that Molly made for him, Harry decided to stay long enough to at least finish a piece. Draco wasn’t surprised or upset. He was content to wait for few moments longer.
The room had suddenly gone very still. Even the healer stared at Harry with wide eyes. Everyone knew that name; it had been in the news long enough during the trials. The issue was debated this way and that. Everyone knew who Draco Malfoy was and what he was.
"No," Harry answered Malfoy's question, finally earning his eyes. He looked at him, as well. "I care about her, but…I think that one's over for good."
He gave two hard knocks to the door. There was utter silence.
There was a deep frown on Malfoy's face, aging him considerably. "Why do you keep coming here? What do you want?"
Harry frowned, his eyes accessing. Finally, he took a step back. “We’ll stop for now. If you don’t want to go too far, then-“
Harry’s blood had been steadily heating up until it was now at a low simmer. "And what is that supposed to mean?" he spoke darkly.
Draco yanked his hand away and stared at the door with wide eyes. Then a sing-song voice called out, "Draco, rise and shine!" The doorknob began to giggle, and he was only able to sit up before the door flew open. "Your fav-"
Ron rolled his eyes and leaned back against the wall. They were currently tucked into an alcove during their free period. Now it made more sense that Ron had suggested it instead of going to a more public place like the library or Common Room like they usually would.
Malfoy's shoulders fell. His eyes flicked up and down Harry before he let out a sigh. "Fine, maybe I had done something."
A smile started to crawl across Draco’s mouth as he stood. He walked with Harry over towards the Gryffindor table; their hands were still clasped, which Draco used to pull Harry closer and mutter. “You didn’t have to do that in front of all of them.”
Harry shrugged meekly. “Did anyone not?” He looked at Hermione, remembering the way she used to blush when Fred teased her. If Ron hadn’t picked up his slack quickly, Harry was fairly certain Fred would have eventually done it for him.
Heather’s eyes went wide while Harry bit his lip to keep from laughing. Pansy’s venomous gaze snapped to Draco. He shrugged. “What? Are you going to try to act like it’s not true?”
He nodded, feeling his cheeks warm. “I love you, too.”
Malfoy threw his leg over his broom. “If you take much longer I’ll need to take the elixir of life.”
Skeres had just been let out. If Harry were in his shoes at that moment, being released after being forced to stew in one's anger for three days, he knew exactly what he'd do next.
Harry flicked his wand.
Malfoy shrugged. "None of the big stuff, something about it being too hard to move out," he clarified. Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. It was a very nice apartment building, sitting on the modern side of London architecture. Harry couldn't imagine anyone living here had money problems. "Mother helped me fill in the gaps," said Malfoy, tapping the ornate, glass side table that somehow managed to fit in.
Occasionally, one of them would bring up something heavy again, but it never felt out of place. It was actually incredibly relieving to know that someone else understood, and not just the mournful comments in the halls that never seemed to disappear. The stranger seemed to understand things that had happened that no one else quite did.
Harry sighed and fell away onto his back. “Okay.”
Draco wrinkled his nose. “Do they?”
“This situation is different."
Harry appeared a little startled but also amused by this change of events. He didn’t argue as he switched places with Malfoy, even taking up being his backrest. However, despite not being of any help, he continued to lean forward as Malfoy had. Only, this seemed to be to cover up the way his fingers were fiddling at the nape of his neck.
He took the Floo. Kreacher bounded into sight before Harry could even take a step away from the mantel. “Master, you have a visitor. They are waiting for you in the drawing-room.”
Harry’s eyes widened. He dropped his threatening demeanor, even taking a step back to offer silent assurance that he wouldn’t try to attack again.
If Draco did hate Harry, then he likely would not have stayed in the bed all night. That, of course, was not worth spending too much of their time dwelling on.
Of course, all of that did not make the other parts go away, the part that Harry had been unintentionally picking up on before. Loneliness. It surrounded him like a dull grey aura, a stormy cloud that reflected in his eyes. Maybe it had always been there to some degree and Harry had just had too much going on to notice.
His gaze had fallen from the horizon to his empty cup. He clutched it like there was still something warm steaming inside. “Nothing, I’ve told you, I only want the flat to look nice.”
“That
“Come here,” Harry hissed, pulling him up the stairs towards the dorm rooms. Malfoy followed his steps, his instinct to not call attention to Potter dragging him into his bedroom only slightly outweighing his need for answers.
Draco was pulled out of his thoughts by an overly sweet scent. He looked away from his own cauldron which held a shimmery, silver liquid to glance at Neville Longbottom. He was sharing the table with him while they worked on their assignment. Currently, Longbottom was frowning down at the lilac swirl in front of him.
Harry smiled. "You say I'm the people pleaser, but why don't you do something, for once, to just please yourself. No one has to see it. Not even me, if you don't want me to. Just do what you want; be who you want. You don't need permission."
With the flat having no access to the Floo network and Harry needing someone to lean on just to walk, it was understood that Draco had to apparate them home. This proved somewhat concerning.
“What happened between you two?” Harry hadn’t meant to say it out loud, but it came out just as quiet and earnest as he had thought it.
Harry jumped forward instantly, taking his hands. “I know, I know!” he assured. He gave them a squeeze, trying his best to silently persuade him of what his words could not.
It was a humorous concept to Harry because he knew otherwise, but he tried to hide his smile as best as possible. He did a poor job.
Another part of the job that made Draco absolutely crazy was how often Harry was working out. He hadn't noticed it before, but as Harry got more and more comfortable, he slowly drove Draco more and more insane. Really, the number of dishes he had nearly broken after looking over to see Harry doing pushups on the ground was indeed troubling. He was lucky he hadn't been holding anything on a particularly warm day when Harry took to walking around and working out shirtless. This Auror job was going to be the death of either Harry or Draco, and it was honestly a toss-up as to who it would be first.
Harry knew what he actually wanted, though. "Malfoy, it's okay," he hummed but kept his distance. "You're okay. I won't make you leave. It's okay."
This was all the permission he needed. Harry pulled his wand from the bedside table on his other side and performed a wordless summoning charm, pulling Draco’s bed from across the room until it bumped up against his.
She frowned. That wasn’t the question she’d been expecting. “I left when I turned seventeen,” she said as if he should already know this. “It caused quite the row. I still have a few of Bella’s scars.”
“It was!” He shot a mischievous look towards his sister as she brought out a bowl of mashed potatoes. “You’re almost as good as my sister at coming up with rhymes.”
Malfoy shrugged. "Only if you keep bringing food around. I was running low." He pointed his chopsticks at him threateningly. "But not as much from now on. I've had to throw it away, and I hate going down to the trash disposal thing."
“I never did!” Neville rebuked.
The warmth began to flow through his veins and into his limbs. “And he didn’t care about my scars or my past―which he knows better than anyone. And he insisted that I know…” he had to swallow the lump in his throat. “That I know how he feels. He even tried to protect me.” He gestured at Zabini as if giving an example to some third party in the room. “If I believe that anyone loves me, it’s him. It’s always been him.”
Draco was curled into his sofa. He stared at the television. His eyes were mostly glazed over, not really taking in what he was watching. It was how he had spent most of the last week. Every once in a while, he’d crack open a book, but he was pretty certain he’d read all of them. He only considered making potions once, but it just didn’t sound entertaining whatsoever.
"Hey," Harry placed a hand on Draco's knee, getting his attention back, "I'm only messing around," he assured. "I never looked down on you for any of that stuff. If anything, I was sort of jealous. You took it in strides. People said a few bad things about me, and I just…" Harry trailed off, remembering several instances where it seemed everyone had turned on him, such as when they thought he was the heir of Slytherin or that he had put his own name in the Goblet of Fire.
“Er, sure,” Neville was the first to agree, Hannah, nodding alongside him.
“Well,” Draco interrupted his daydream, “you see now that there is a reason I don’t like to drink.”
There was no natural light coming into the basement kitchen, so time ticked by quickly without notice. It was nearly ten when Harry finally took note of the clock. “I suppose you’ll want to be going home soon,” he sighed, his eyes falling to their empty plates.
Harry handed the last of the dirty plates over to Audrey, Percy’s girlfriend, who was helping Molly scourgify the mess. He was about to sardine himself into the sitting room with everyone else when Charlie caught his attention.
"Really?" Malfoy said slowly. "I never would have imagined. I thought you were going to put it under a lamp and wait."
Something shifted briefly across Longbottom’s face, but it quickly snapped back to his original glare. “I’m not going to fall for something like that.”
Harry tried to push against him. “I’m not-”
“They do realize that boys and girls are prohibited from being in the dorms together, even the eighth-years. McGonagall warned us that she’ll do rounds.”
He sunk back into his spot and grabbed one of the Butterbeers, nursing on it until some of the harder stuff came around again.
"An inquiry isn't going to do anything," Harry argued. "Someone in the ministry is giving out private information, information that is causing harm. Doesn't that qualify for a little more concern?"
Malfoy snapped his head to the other man with wide eyes. The horror of his expression was that of if Harry had just disgraced the entire Malfoy line and included his unborn children for the hell of it. "Do you know what kind of treasures you have here? Obviously, it isn't as extensive as the one at Malfoy Manor, but they chose well for the limited space they had."
Neville rolled his eyes and shoved Harry’s shoulder. “Oh sod off.”
Harry sat up abruptly and tossed the closed snitch onto the pile of clothes by his wardrobe. “You’re sleeping here tonight,” he declared.
Harry wished he could be as creative as Draco. He wished he could draw or write or do something that would describe exactly what he saw. All he knew how to do was fly and fight and move forward. He was always moving. It was not until now, not until Draco, that he had ever even considered staying still or going slow. He never thought of enjoying a moment. He never thought of enjoying being with a person. He liked being with Draco though, he loved it.
He followed Robards all the way to the Head Auror office. The door swung closed behind them. There was a shutter in the air as the Silencing charms which layered the room reignited with the click of the latch.
Harry sat up. “Hey,” he said softly. His heart sunk when Draco instinctively recoiled from Harry’s hand on his back. Draco quickly muttered and apology and leaned back into his touch. Harry moved his hand slowly up and down, feeling suddenly self-conscious. “We knew we would have to do this eventually. We’re going to get through this. All of the people who matter already know and they accept us. The rest can honestly fuck off.”
A smug smirk spread across Malfoy’s lips, and he settled back into the chair, resuming his prim posture. “I’ll wait here for you.”
Draco crossed his arms with a firm pout forming on his lips. "Well, we can't come back here again, then."
ou for being just as much of a mother to him as Molly was and, at times, maybe even more so.
He liked being with Ginny, but they were never like this. Hermione never saw him playful. Premature worry lines around his eyes seemed inevitable. Maybe he was occasionally like this with Ron or—her heart ached—Fred and George. He was having
Malfoy shrugged. "My father used to say much worse to ours all of the time. I used to laugh when he did." Harry started to open his mouth, the image of Dobby's fearful eyes whenever he thought he made a mistake splitting his mind. However, his words disappeared when Malfoy went on. "I don't think I ever really thought it was funny. I just preferred that he yelled at them like that than me."
Harry suddenly straightened. What kind of question was that? More importantly, what answer was he expected to give? “They’re a wizarding family, like the Weasleys.”
Trying to change the subject, Harry reached over to the pile of restaurant menus on the counter. "What do you feel like eating tonight?"
“What are you doing?” Draco questioned.
“Come on,” she chirped, suddenly sounding a little more upbeat. “She’s just down the hall.”
The dark eyes that stared into him were not angry. They were wide and searching as if trying to find something to counter his suspicions. He never found it. He was reduced to asking out loud. “You are truly in love with him, too?”
“The Office?” Harry asked.
Harry went to answer but he paused as he looked at Hermione and Audrey. He wanted to tell them all, especially Hermione, but he considered that he should likely discuss it with his partner first. “Come in side with me?”
With another sharp glare out of the corner of her eyes, she picked up the mug. After another thorough examination, she finally brought it to her lips. She jumped when the warmth touched her lips then her eyes widened. Her gaze snapped to Heather, who was watching carefully from behind the counter. A smile spread across the muggle’s face. “Do you like it?” she called from across the shop.
Harry suddenly wished Draco hadn’t turned the light out yet. The only thing he could see was the man’s faint outline from the alarm clock light on the bedside table. Maybe it was a good thing he couldn’t, though. It helped him speak the truth. “Yeah, I am.”
Harry chuckled but nodded. “Probably.”
One beat passed before the real world and the dream world finally began to untangle themselves. Malfoy had been sleeping in Ron’s bed. Harry had invited him. Harry was awake.
you up at this hour?”
Malfoy eyed him in that careful calculating way that made Harry wriggle about. “Yes, you seem to. Why is that?”
“You should!” The offended rush of Harry’s voice made Malfoy flinch. “I don’t just like you because I can insult you.”
Harry rounded the counters and met Draco in the sitting room. He took him by the shoulders and pulled him to meet Harry’s gaze. “Hey, it doesn’t matter what he thinks anymore. It doesn’t matter what anyone thinks. We’ve got each other. That’s all that counts.”
This proceeded for the rest of the week. It wasn't until Friday that anything changed.
“I want all of you to get along.”
“You’re wrong.”
“I’m sure you can,” he said, patting her back, sarcasm dripping off his words. Harry chuckled. Hermione rolled her eyes but stopped arguing.
Hermione’s eyes bulged. “They honestly don’t have anyone here that can help? It’s a hospital!”
Malfoys shook his head profusely. "It's not just Skeres. It's everyone. I-" He hesitated, glancing at Harry once before turning his eyes to the expanse of his apartment. "They all hate me, and they have reason to." He began to pick at his sweater again. "I'm the reason so many people are dead."
Harry started down the entry hall. It had taken some great effort but the portrait of Walburga Black had finally been removed. All of the rotting wallpaper had been torn down and replaced with fresh coats of taupe paint which was slowly being covered by pictures of the children who lived there.
Zabini was not frightened. His face softened, his hand gently moving past his knee to draw lazily across his thigh. “That it was a lie.”
An uncertain smile stretched Draco’s face as he narrowed his eyes at Harry. “I love you, too?” he phrased it more like a question than a statement. When Harry had nothing to say in return, he rolled his eyes and gave a light shove. “Freak.”
Harry rolled his eyes. "We aren't talking about me."
Draco had some remnants of discretion. Though Harry could feel his eyes nearly the whole day, Draco did not say a word about Zabini. It wasn’t until that evening, when they were getting ready for bed, that his silence finally broke.
“I don’t complain,” Harry attempted to defend himself. He never complained. He just didn’t like people fussing over him when it wasn’t necessary.
He riffled through his wallet and pulled out the amount in cash before taking the large bag of takeaway he had ordered. He hadn't been sure what Malfoy would like. He wasn't even sure if Malfoy liked Chinese food. Did he even know what it was? Wizarding restaurants mostly consisted of pubs and cafés. He never really thought about international cuisine before.
“Merlin, Harry! Can you leave me one sibling?”
Harry was smiling from ear to ear as he dropped into the chair beside him. Malfoy closed his book but didn’t mark the page as though he hadn’t actually been reading it.
Harry shrugged. "Hermione's always telling me to be nicer to him. I'm better at that than cleaning up that place."
"Because you wouldn't stop flailing around," Harry exclaimed. "Or when you missed the snitch because you were too busy mocking me. Or when Moody turned you into a ferret because you were being a prat. I wouldn't call any of those perfect moments." Harry's smile grew with each example he gave, remembering each event with fondness not unlike some evenings he'd spent with Ron recounting the same times as they both nearly keeled over laughing.
“You’re a speccy-eyed wanker,” Draco said in a stage whisper.
"I would."
Harry pulled back from their lazy kiss to admire Draco through hooded eyes. He couldn’t even fathom how he’d gotten here. Over four years ago he’d been a stumbling drunk and now he didn’t even remembered what liquor tasted like. “Thank you,” he said softly.
She shook her head profusely. “It’s no big deal. We can take some time off.”
The fullness Harry had felt moments ago faded as heat ate up all of the contents in his stomach. He couldn’t see Malfoy’s face but the other three had malicious gleams in their eyes, only spurned on more by the smirks twisting their faces. Zabini was the only one who didn’t look delighted, but his cool gaze was not exactly concerned for what was happening either.
Harry shrugged as he made his way towards his bed. “That wasn’t the part that bothered me.”
"I- I'm sorry. I went too far."
However, this comfort didn’t last. He could feel her gaze focus and begin to assess him. “How are you?” She tried to speak casually, but he could hear the concerned undertone. He didn’t miss that.
They’re turn was before old bar Harry usually got pissed at each nigh but he didn’t feel cheated by not going to it.  In truth, he’d nearly forgotten about it.
Harry sighed, getting up from his chair. He went into the kitchen while Malfoy stayed seated, craning his neck over the bar top to watch. Harry opened the door, and Malfoy jumped at the sound of the crisp seal breaking.
Harry rolled his eyes. "I'm okay on the sofa."
Draco rolled his eyes.
“You went alone?” exclaimed Draco. Harry cringed into the cot. He had been severely hoping that would be glossed over. Draco stomped up to the injured man and smacked his leg, causing Harry to wince back in pain. “You went after that maniac all alone, and look what happened! Did you have a mental break?”
Harry stopped dead in his tracks. Of all the people he might have guessed that would show up at his office, Lucius Malfoy was not near the top. However here he was, being pushed away from the Auror office doors by two men from Magical Law Enforcement Patrol.
Heather accepted this name a little more readily though her smile faulted upon looking at Draco again. Harry could imagine what she was thinking. He didn't look like a Drake.
Harry was on the verge of arguing when Malfoy moved his hand until he felt a less densely packed area. The lines were not as defined, and some were even shorter or thinner than the rest. “It’s okay.”
“We aren’t that obvious,” Draco snapped.
Malfoy abruptly became stuck to the grass, his whole body tensing up. Harry stopped and looked back. He might have thought someone had turned Malfoy into a statue, but no piece of marble could have eyes filled with such fire. “Is that what all of this is about? You want to know why I’ve returned? Want to know my
“I need to use the loo,” Harry said, any better excuse evading him. “Go on ahead and save me a seat.”
Harry’s amusement completely fell away. “Drawings? What drawings?”
Ron raised his brows. “Oh come off it, mate. I’m not an idiot. You two clearly have something going on.”
Harry narrowed his eyes. His thoughts instantly jumped to a conspiracy. “He didn’t know that this morning.”
Draco raised a brow. “I’m not good, remember? I’m evil.”
“If you found out Zabini had feelings for you, would you take him back?”
"All right, laugh at this," Harry huffed. He got back up and sat on the couch, leaning his full weight back onto Malfoy's splayed body.
Harry smacked his lips together a few times before giving a quick closed-lipped smile. "All better."
Like Harry Potter temperament detectors, another Weasley manifested at Harry’s side to restrain him before he did something stupid.”
He began to look around the rest of the apartment. A television was tucked into a small entertainment center beside the fireplace, a thermostat on the wall, switches, and plugs everywhere. He wondered what Malfoy had been doing with all of this by himself. He couldn't have been there long to not have at least figured out the stove.
Curiously, what sent the most acid to his stomach was the way Zabini treated him. Being the only two Slytherin boys to return, they were naturally partners in nearly every class. Zabini hardly acknowledged Malfoy’s battered appearance unless someone he thought worth noting was around to hear and then he would happily jibe at him. He had quite easily become the top of the Slytherin social ladder simply through his easy derision of his roommate. Not to mention that their close proximity for the last seven years gave him access to plenty of dirt. Very little of it seemed to break the ranks of the Slytherins but they were all gleefully eager to spread it amongst themselves and send inside insults Malfoy’s way whenever he passed.
The first thing he processed was the straggly, waist-length, staunchly blonde hair that didn’t look very far off from the color of his own. He couldn’t recall if the Lovegoods were pure-bloods or not. He wouldn’t be surprised if they shared some sort of common ancestor on the Malfoy line. He was a Black and a Malfoy. There were few people in the wizarding world he wasn’t related to.
“Neither of us has an owl on hand and Ron would likely show up to check on me if I did find a way to notify them. Do you want that?”
Harry couldn’t forget it, though. He didn’t know what this reaction meant, and he couldn’t stop overanalyzing it. He finished changing then crawled under the duvet with Draco.
A shaky breath wracked Draco’s body. “You can’t leave again.”
“Harry.”
“Yeah, my wallet is by the door.”
"Fine, she can slip poison in their afternoon tea. No one will have to know-"
“Draco,” Harry said softly. Draco’s eyes flashed to him. Harry nudged his head, urging him near.
“I was angry, okay? I just heard that I wasn’t cleared, and he wanted to keep me locked up in the house. He wouldn’t even let me go for a walk.”
“Because I feel like it,” Harry said, his tone nearly matching Malfoy’s. “Is that really such a hard concept?”
I apologize if there are any format errors. I’m uploading this on mobile because my computer isn’t working. I’ve already had stuff crash before and lost a lot so I wanted to get what I already have written posted in case my files get corrupted again. Hope you like it!
Teddy, who’d happily taken up the task of handing out slices of cake, ran up to Draco to hand him an extra sprinkled piece. Draco honestly thought he didn’t have any room to eat more yet but he found himself unable to turn down the child. Did puppy eyes come with the werewolf gene?
“Harry.”
Draco was still in the room when Harry woke up. It was such a bewildering sight that he couldn’t help but stare.
“Harry?” His eyes darted towards the clock. It was quarter to one. “Why are you home early? What happened?”
Harry stepped into the fireplace, powder in hand, and announced his desired destination loudly and clearly before whirling away and in emerald flames.
“You mean the image that everyone hates?”
It was meant to be comforting, but Draco looked as if he’d been shot. He yanked his hand away and shoved himself back against the headboard, as far from Harry as possible.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "I know that, but how are you cooking it?"
“Oh right,” she hurried to scribble down her number as well as something else. “Our address as well,” she said, returning the pen and paper, “call or come by if anything happens. If we aren’t there, we’re in the office.”
"It's the alchemic symbol for death. Macnair had it tattooed to his chest."
With his desk marginally cleared off, he left the classroom. He started towards his chambers to drop off his things before going to the final feast but his feet slowed at the same spot they always did. He paused then looked up at the fifty or so names carved into the wall beneath the words BATTLE OF HOGWARTS MEMORIAL. There were too many to have a portrait of each but several people had their portraits littered around the castle.
“No!” Harry exclaimed, earning several looks from the other occupants of the room. This really wasn’t the type of conversation they should be having out in the open.
Malfoy scoffed but began to stir honey into the other cup he had already prepared. Each of them sipping off their own cups, they moved to the couch and sat in silence, enjoying the early morning silence.
Packing with two wands was a quick affair. It only took a few trips to get everything to Grimmauld, and it moved twice as fast when they got Kreacher to help.
He had begun to realize that most of his thoughts were not his own, they never were. He never hated the house-elves growing up seeing as they were the closest things to friends he had, but his father did so he did. He also had no real qualms against Dumbledore, but his father did so he did. Draco never set out to follow the Dark Lord’s bidding, but his father did so he did.
"Why not? You love it here," Harry questioned. "There's almost no one here Saturday mornings."
Malfoy scoffed again. "Not a problem."
“His information put Harry in the hospital!”
A short chuckle sounded across from him. “You said it, not me.”
“I won though.”
“I should have warned you about Andromeda,” Harry sighed. He leaned against fence of the paddock, barely paying the sway of the old wood any mind.
Harry had reached his peak of tolerance one day when Draco walked out of the bedroom in nothing but pants and one of Harry’s shirts; Harry’s broader shoulders had stretched out the cotton leaving it to drape off of Draco’s shoulders though Draco was taller and therefore it didn’t quite reach his thighs like many of his own lounging sweaters did.
Hermione stared at him for a long moment.
Draco could see the tightness on his mother’s face. “We won’t be staying long, only the holidays. Molly Weasley invited us for Christmas.”
In all truth, Harry would much rather go to Malfoy’s than spend the night at Grimmauld. He would always prefer to do that if he didn’t feel like such an imposition when he did. Still, it was nice to hear Malfoy be so adamant about it. He must really care if he was volunteering to stay at the musty old house Harry grudgingly owned.
He straightened. “Does she know about,” Harry hesitated, not sure how to classify it, “about me staying here?”
Harry shook his head. "You didn't have anything to do with it." He began to stuff his mouth with more noodles, trying to keep his mind occupied by something else – anything else. He could feel Malfoy watching him but refused to look up.
Harry was too busy watching his hands to comprehend what he was saying. He snapped his eyes up to Malfoy. "You mean spend the night?"
They got through one and a half episodes before Malfoy looked over at Harry to see his eyes drooping. He stood up. Harry’s eyes shoot open at the movement. “It’s okay,” Malfoy cooed. “Go to sleep.”
“I don’t know, Hermione,” Ron sighed. They were clinking around in their kitchen, preparing a simple dinner for themselves. “To rely on someone that much? It isn't healthy. He can't only be okay if Malfoy is around. That's not healing."
Harry sighed. This was no time for deep reflections about his previous schoolyard nemesis. He only had a few more hours of sleep to hold onto before he had to be up for class. He dropped down into his own bed and sleep soon drew him in.
Draco flinched at the vivid memory they shared. It was the one memory that had yet to be used as nightmare fuel in Harry’s mind, perhaps because he knew Dumbledore had planned it. He wondered if Draco was as lucky.
The shock in his eyes gradually fell, and he began to push himself up onto the bed. “I- I’m sorry,” he croaked. “I just need-” His voice broke off. He hugged himself, his nails digging into his sides.
It was hard to tell if Harry was even awake until a smile, which was more like a grimace, tugged on his bruised face. “Hey,” his voice was like gravel. It made it hard for Draco to maintain his anger. Hard but not impossible.
She sat primly, her eyes scrutinizing. “He’s in the girl’s loo.”
ignoring me.”
Every time, there was that look in his eye. That uncertainty and distrust, as if with each offer he was waiting for the catch. He looked even more uncomfortable when it never came.
Malfoy became silent. He was contemplating the fact that there was not one but two empty beds upstairs and an open invitation to use one.
“Sorry, mate, I’m a taken man.”
“Nothing
After a brief pause on the edge of Essex, they manifested outside of a brick house on the edge of Attleborough. At first glance, it looked forgotten. Most muggles who passed likely assumed it held no occupants. However, as  Ron and Harry walked further down the short path from the main road, some of the glamour began to fall away. The structure appeared more secure. Twisted vines climbing up the wall were well tended and not the overgrown spider webs they looked like before. Whoever was keeping them had apparently been working recently because there was a wheelbarrow with new blossoms sitting in the yard, waiting to be earthed.
