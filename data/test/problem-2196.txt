Draco’s eyes filled with helpless anger as he listened to his mother’s words. “But that Bond is supposed to safe you when you were… kidnapped or in some other way forced to leave your partner’s side. It’s not supposed to be used to force you to go back to him when you left on your own will! How can he twist the Bond like that?”

Neville – Knockyourwood
“I, Narcissa Malfoy, née Black, call upon my right and my magic to cut the Bond to my husband, Lucius Abraxas Malfoy. Let all the ties be cut, let all the contracts be broken. I shall never again spend his money, shall never again use his name. He shall never again spend my money, shall never again call me his wife. From now on I bind myself to my son, Draco Lucius Malfoy and I shall protect him and stand by his side. No matter his name, no matter his status, no matter his father’s will. I call upon my magic to let me free and take my former husband’s ties with it.”

curse at the werewolf. However, before the curse could leap across the clearing to hit Remus, the air started to vibrate with a sudden energy, causing the red spell to simply fall apart mid-air. Everything froze as the three enemies felt the wave of magical power roll over them, leaving them breathless. But it wasn’t the sheer amount of power that caused the werewolf to forget the situation he was currently in. It was the familiarity of the magic that almost made him tear up. The human’s mind didn’t understand why it felt so familiar, but it still frantically tried to locate the source of the magic. The wolf however, howled excitedly as it recognized the sudden presence of the long missed pub. But he quickly grew agitated when he realized that the wave of magic was already fading without a trail to follow. The human and his wolf desperately tried to catch the scent of the painfully familiar magical signature again, and by doing so they forgot their surroundings for a second too long. A second Bellatrix Lestrange used to cast her favorite curse once again. This time, the curse hit its target.
it is 9:56 and you are not in my office
: ask him if he’s sure he’d risk batdad’s approval like this
: ok that’s completely okay

I don't even know if some of this will be funny to you. But I kind of love this chapter, because I got to play around a lot. There are a lot of new formats (emails, calls etc.) and I really enjoyed writing this :D

Harry couldn’t help but laugh a little, although he only did it in his mind. Trust his magic? When had he ever truly trust anything? He had been let down too often, had seen friends turn into enemies only for them to come back and lie into his face about always believing in him. Sure, he trusted his few close friends, but he still couldn’t tell them everything. He trusted Dumbledore but still couldn’t help resenting him every time the summer began. He had trusted Sirius but he had never been blind to the flaws of his godfather. And himself? He had never trusted himself. Too many times his accidental magic had betrayed him at the Dursley’s, leaving him alone in his cupboard, without any food or contact to other people. Too many times he had acted impulsively, and with doing so he had made everything so much worse. So with all that, how could he trust his magic?
: half of Hogw has a crush on you potter
: I didn’t know about that
: I KNOW we were little shitheads but… he’s still so hurt
: as a narrator? Oh god ….
Best,
: forgiven
: No.
: you might have noticed that Sirius and I have matching chat-names

I hope you enjoyed this, post a comment with your favourite shitpost or meme and maybe these children will have to suffer through them in future chapters.
: why are you like this
: don’t u dare
: I didn’t know Snape is a halfblood

: bro of my life, pls don’t leave me
: so its dumblebro’s fault
: this is honestly so interesting, I need to borrow ALL of your books
She shook her head and lifted her hands. “I’m sorry, dears, but it’s not possible for you to visit Harry just yet. The poor boy is hidden in a safe house and is still recovering from his wounds.”
The young wizard didn’t know how long he had been lying here in this forest, his eyes closed and his mind focused inwards. He couldn’t really be bothered to care anyways. Voldemort, saving the world, even his friends – everything seemed to be so far away, as if it was part of a different reality altogether. In some part of his brain a tiny voice was screaming at him to get up, to tell everyone that he was still alive, and to do his duty as the Boy Who Lived. But most of him was still tired. Not in the physical sense, in contrary, he actually felt better than before he had been kidnapped. But his thoughts swirled around slowly whenever he considered standing up.
: (Can’t hold memes back anymore)
: Potter, Harry
: omg
: lol which chat have you been added to

On behalf of all workers here at
The meeting with the prime minister took place last week Wednesday at 3pm. Unfortunately, your afternoon tea with Secretary Moncreaux took place at the same time, and therefore I met with the prime minister on my own. I’ve given you the protocol of the meeting on last Friday.

Parvati – thefirstone
: yes about that
there comes a time in life, where we all have to ask ourselves: how far are we willing to go?
Anyway.
So as you might have noticed, there is now a final number of chapters added. At the moment I'm pretty sure there'll only be 15 chapters, because those sum up the plot which holy fuck how did this fic even develop a plot???
: petty
Hello Mrs. Fudge, this is Percy Weasley speaking. Your husband has mailed me, saying that he won’t come into office before lunch as he feels quite sick. You mentioned that he’s left already, so I assume he has returned to you safely?
: 8:18 am
Harry – ILivedBitch
= Narcissa
: that’s hetero erasure but I ain’t even mad
: well I can definitely tell you know that you’ll regret asking us

: fuCKING UMBITCH
: (harry, u can’t say that to a slytherin u naïve little idiot)

: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
: H, you’ve never been unproblematic
love u guys
: no need to sound so smug, sev
: :) :) :)
Next to her Ron argued quietly with the family’s owl, Errol. The old owl might have flown against various windows a few times too often, but it still knew that Ron didn’t have the authority to send the letter he was currently holding. As one of the youngest Weasley family members he couldn’t just write an official letter to Gringotts. Ron knew this very well, but desperate situations and all that, so he tried anyway.
: we have our own ways to get what we want, draco
: me and Luna have fundamentally different ways to see the world around us
: McGonagall, Minerva
Daphne – ExcuseYOU
: no way did pompom let you leave the bed with a flue
: I expect to see you and your two boyfriends for dinner tomorrow night
: really clueless
: ur point?
: ha, u wish
: im not shut your mouth
: no sweetheart that meme is already dead again
: I do believe –
Ten galleons that he’ll send you a sick memo in the next… thirty minutes.
: yea yea whatever

: I already made a study plan, but I wanted to ask if you can give me any pointers on which topics in transfiguration will be most relevant

: I mean this passive aggressive ‘I guess u like her more than me’ kind of anger
Sorry for the delay you people, I've had a super busy week (and it's gonna get worse, yay). But today is a public holiday in Germany, so I had time to format this whole thing and finally update :D

: r e j e c t e d
: oh thank merlin
: same
: I’ve been trying but u people keep dragging me into this mess
: NOTHING
GRYFFS
I REALLY hope you like the way I kind of showed the development of the Severus-Remus-Sirius relationship. These men had a lot of things to get over first, before they were ready to think more about their future. Also I would like to remember you that a lot of things were never shown “on-screen” in this fic, like the time when Voldi was still alive and the three worked together to fight him. They already came a long way before this fic had started.
: you are a WIZARD tho?!?
: yeah well now that I have all of your attention: millie told me something I would like to verify
: I can’t believe Potter is in love with our batdad
: I’m //this// close to winning the bet
: it’s “inter-house relationships”
: its not like you have immense magical power and the most sway over public opinion out of anyone living in Great Britain right now
: u trying to tell me u would ever break up with Harry Bloody Potter
: your plan involved murder, nev
: always
: okay so during lunch I was watching crazy lady
: determination
: great for surprise bondage sex tho
Anyways, I hope you liked this chapter and as always I'm always open to suggestions!
Or maybe he wasn’t quite so sane anymore. He didn’t really remember what it felt like to trust his own mind. To see something and to be absolutely sure that it was there, and not just a cruel trick of his own imagination. To hear something and to believe that other people could hear it as well.
: ur a fucking peacock draco don’t lie
… yes, Mr. Weasley.
: a big mood
: literally what the fuck is wrong with you all
“Harry had to endure horrible things because of Voldemort yet again. I am as shocked and angry as all of you are, but right now we need to focus on the only important task: we need to find Harry.”
: uuuhhhhmmmmm I know nothing
: w hhhh
: can't argue that
: !!!!!!!
: He has one of the strongest patronus I’ve ever seen. He loves teaching. He doesn’t care how clothes look like as long as they are soft and warm.
: I can’t believe it either but yes
: Noted.
: so what did snape write
(Is memers a thing? If yes, then it probably shouldn't be, tbh..)
Millicent – AngryCat
: so if we manage to kiss with neither of us crying that’s like already a success
: gryffs, do you have any concept of ‘blackmail’ at all????
moving on

: AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
: the court meeting is at 5pm on sat
: yes well im glad to see you taking your health so serious, Minerva
: why does everyone think bill is hot
: Ah yeah, cut the call. Ehm.
: fine
: but we all know who was the WORST
: Though I must confess that I still don’t know what exactly a Goldblum is.
: “chapter”????
: I know I was surprised too
: haha stoooop
: *firth of all
: he says he can taste if gold is real or fake???? i… don’t know if that’s true???
: ima tell albus about this
: Is it because the night would be nothing but sad darkness without the stars and the moon to brighten it up?
: ok ok so do I have green light???
: oh yes :)
: wait so the movie is about a woman and a bee
: ive only kissed one (1) person and cho wouldn’t stop crying
: I know its difficult
Daphne – ExcuseYOU
: hello professor
: (aren’t you demi)
If you go to a parade, have fun and please be safe!! <3
: and I know it’s a bit weird coming from someone younger, but
aw is that norberta’s baby??
: except me cause I got a boyfriend before u so obvs I am better at life than u
: nah me and ron once discussed this for like two hours
: what if we have prior commitments?
Immediately, the former silence was interrupted by angry and nervous shouts. Dumbledore himself closed his eyes for a few seconds. The white-haired wizard seemed to age a few years just sitting there. The tumult continued for a short amount of time until a loud growl silenced them all. Everyone stared at Lupin, who’s eyes appeared to gleam a little more yellow than normally. Obviously the usually so calm man was loosing his patience.
: ….. 11%
: literally though not be That Muggleborn™ but why aren’t school counselors a thing here?
: it’s UnderSecretary to the Minister and you know it
: detention
: do I have to go on or have I embarrassed myself enough
He sent a note at 8:15. Barely over twenty minutes, but I am a man of my word. I’ll transfer the galleons after lunch.
The universe may think it played me, but I changed the rules of the game and have become invincible.
Pansy – GossipQueen
: u two are so cute stop it
: never in their whole existence have british people been known to express their feelings in an “enthusiastic” way
: well that explains a lot
: Draco
: THE FUNDS
: he can’t say YES either!!

Percy Weasley

: Ginny, you asked me out over wiz-chat

Avhar.

: circe, just answer the question
: No fuck that was a joke I didn't think that one through
: the house elves complained enough about the last blood staines
: yea I know

Really tho I had no idea this fic would involve so much plot. Where did it come from? Where does it go? Nobody knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (least of all me, tbh)
…. Yea no

: since when has this been a thing
: you know
Wish I would understand what she’s talking about one day.
: so then severus seemed to … pause for a moment, and then he stared at me and said “Sirius is a dog. Remus is a wolf” and then he looked quite horrified and whispered “I am a damn furry”
: the frickfrack
: im the only one allowed to tease him about it fyi
: R U D E
: I  …. I can’t figure out if I should be offended by that
: it's muggle food, good stuff
, spells that every student his age could cast. But now that he was watching the core of his magic running through his body, he felt the potential behind all that power. Somehow he had the feeling of swimming against the tide – if he could just learn in which direction the water was going, then he could turn around and swim with it. His magic could be faster and stronger.
: ok true but I really like being ur friend now, Draco. And I don’t want to give that up
: you’ll see
: how much longer are u going to pretend u aren’t dating oliver
: why are you so angry, Sirius?
: I’m – what?
: “The patient shows no more impairing effects from the extended exposure to dementors”
: I have my ways to win back sev’s approval ;) ;) ;)

: bye bye dursleys

As Harry’s Head of House, I am writing you in regards to his feedback (because he’s a Gryffindor).

: oh thank god you’re still here
Remus Lupin felt dirty. It wasn’t only an effect of staying in the woods for a whole week. He used cleaning charms on himself every morning and again when he had found a safe place to sleep. It wasn’t the same as taking a shower but it fulfilled its goal. No, he felt dirty because of where he was. The wolf inside of him growled as he stood at the edge of the forest, looking down at the large mansion seated in the valley below. It was an impressive building, more impressive than practical. The owners obviously wanted everyone to know that they had more money than any normal person would earn during their whole lifetime.
Now, as for the sad news. My people, my folks, the next update will sadly be only in two weeks, so Wed. 4th of July (wait isn't that Murica Day. You know, the bday of Captn America?). I'm really sorry about that, but I've been drowing in work and I haven't been able to write up new chapters, so I have to give myself some time to stock up again.
: …. am I supposed to be offended?
AND THEN I DIDN'T!!!!
: U LIMP DICKED FRENCH FRY

I hope you like it!!!!
: how does it feel, legally having a father and a brother?
: anyway
: not us because it’s still winter holidays
Harry had never thought about how magic looked like. Sure, different spells had different colors, and you could see what magic could
: all of you are responsible for my headache I hope u suffer in hell
: exACtlY
Crabbe – Muffin #1
: not big enough
: she is running to the library

Ron frowned, but he put the letter down. Errol tuted excitedly, obviously proud to have won the discussion.

The snake shifted again, as if she feared to say too much.

Fact 2: Uploading this chapter was delayed by 30 min because I couldn’t find a song to listen to while proof-reading this mess.
: it’s a friend of my brother and hes super boring and has been talking about his carpet collection for an hour now
: fuck
: EVERYONE heard the rumors
P.S.: Regarding Harry’s powers – I’m trying, Minerva, I really am. Yesterday he apparated through the anti-apparation wards at Grimmauld Place (you know, the ones
anyone need some salve for that?
He didn’t feel cold or warm or… anything really. Everything that made him a thinking human being was focused on the small spark of pulsating power that he had managed to locate in his chest. It was nestled inside his body in about the same height as his heart, but on the right sight of his body. The snake, which was still winded around his eyes, had hissed excitedly in his ear when he had found the spark. Somehow he was able to actually
: parvati wanted to get out of a boring conversation
: some of these potions could help a lot of people

Sincerely,

I hope you liked this chapter as much as I do! I'll try to answer all comments I have left unanswered in the next two to three days, but I already read them all and I can't tell you all how happy they make me!!! And look at all the kudos, like when did this even happen????

: Well, I went back to my relatives, obviously. They were back home by that point. But my uncle locked away all my books and everything – so really, I started learning about magic at Hogwarts. The first lessons were a bit overwhelming, haha.

I honestly do not know where the content of this chapter came from. I've never even watched the Bee Movie. All I know about it is from tumblr. I don't know if the woman qualifies as a furry. All I know about furries is also from tumblr. I try to avoid that part of tumblr though.

Good Morning Minister Fudge.

If you feel like you need a vacation - take it. That's all I'm gonna say here, but if you are that overworked intern who gets guilted into doing overtime, or that employee who feels like the company is gonna crash if you take a week off - listen, if you need a vacation. Take it. Don't """power through""".

Daphne – ExcuseYOU
::…::…::
: he introduced my father to trashy reality tv
: same
She took out her wand and caressed the sleek, black wood lovingly. “You must understand this, Draco. I never loved your father. I thought I did, for a while, but I was fooling myself. I respected his power and his name and I respected my parents’ wish that I should marry him. All these years and I never really learned to love him. There is only one person in this world that I love, Draco, and that is you.”
: he wishes
: don’t worry, im fine
and Cuthbert is a teacher. On the payroll.
: Snape, Severus
: hmmmm better, go on
: why does
“No. I’m sorry, but Harry needs to rest. He is safe and he is recovering, with the best healers by his side. I’m sure he would let you stay at his side the whole time – but right now it’s best for him to simply rest. You will see him when you all go back to Hogwarts, surely.”
: pls just answer the question dad
: remus told me about those texts to snape
: is… is he okay
(See the end of the chapter for
Anyway, I hope you liked this chapter as well! Thanks for all the kudos and comments until now! Next chapter we finally start the new school year in Hogwarts :D

BETRAYAL
: Yes, I can see how this can have a major impact on the grades of younger students.
“He has Padfoot.  He has Padfoot in the place where it is.”  Harry called out.  Trying to get his message across.  He had no idea whether it registered before Snape had stalked out, his robes billowing in their characteristic manner.  Then Umbridge had threatened him with the Cruciatius curse.  He looked at Draco, wide eyed.  If she used it here, with them both in the room, there would be no way to hide the bond, and more importantly it would not only cause him agony, it would leave Draco a crumpled mess.  Hermione intervened before he could do or say anything.  She tricked Umbridge into coming in the forest with them and the idiot had insulted the Centaurs.  Then the three Gryffidor friends were off on Thestrals to the Ministry, with Ginny, Luna and Neville in tow.   Harry wished he could warn Draco he was leaving the castle.  He wanted to tell him that it would hurt, but that he was doing it to save Sirius, who was like Blaise in so many ways.  That he wouldn’t be doing this for any other reason.
: no one should ever listen to anything he says
: idec your suffering is pleasing me
: love you too…. Bitch
: but it still increased my hoe cred that I went with u

I'll answer all your awesome comments tomorrow, I promise!! Also the new ones on "There's a meme for that". Reading them all makes me super happy, so if you like this chapter but can't think of a comment copy&paste this: "Dragons just be like that sometimes" and I'll know you liked it! :D
: your username literally has the word bitch in it, Harry
: isn’t that just bestiality
: with no reception
A BAD NAME
: 25%
: bc you are my boyfriend
: well the important thing is that you never have to go back there and you can start leaving all those horrible memories behind you
: it’s been five minutes harry, just ask a question
: I don’t even have time for lunch because of the transfig essay :(
She held out her arm and Draco quickly stepped forward to take her hand. They walked towards the old but comfortable couch and set down, holding each other close. Like so many times before Draco felt a painful stab of guilt as he thought of everything his mother had given up for him. She had told him that it wasn’t his fault and that she would gladly follow him everywhere he had to go, but it was still difficult for him to see his mother like this.
: Are you alone?
: he def would do that
: pans
u mean fudge
: like. I can all him my boyfriend??? Because????? That’s what he is????!!!!!
: im slowly getting suspicious of your enthusiastic support, pansy
: I only skimmed the chat I thought we are protesting the system
: are we ignoring that Malfoy apparently thought Ron’s appearance was reason enough for me dating him
Harry contemplated shifting onto his back. It seemed like a huge task, too tiring to even consider. Most of the time he didn’t even open his eyes, because keeping them open would take to much energy. And if he closed his eyes he could pretend that it was all only a bad dream. He could dream himself away to Hogwarts, into the arms of his friends. He could dream himself on his loyal broom, flying upwards until his breath turned into ice and he could touch the clouds.
: hey
GRYFFS
: uuuhhhhhhhhhh no
: Oh, to be young again
: it’s called repressing traumatic experiences, Harold
: you already know that you’re right mione
: he’s pooping
: Remus Lupin is much more than a werewolf, you know. And the fact that he’s a werewolf does not make him a lesser being.
it would slowly drain my will to be a teacher, so let’s make it a Sherry Thursday, what do you say, old friend?
: u are an idol for all of us

The snake swayed contently.
: I know we talked about this before, but are you guys really okay with me being adopted by snape first
: Yule might be already over, but it’s never too late for presents.
The three children – they were still children in her eyes and it would probably never change – in front of her were still protesting. From somewhere inside her the witch took the strength to shake her head again.
: I still love you, but…  I don’t think we can go on like this
My name is Percival Harrington, and I’ll be your host for the next two hours! Now, I’m sure you’ve all heard about the special topic we’ll talk about today. Or maybe you just don’t care, because all you care about it today’s guest! I wouldn’t fault you for that haha –

: none more important than my wish to see you
burned through them. Hot knives seemed to carve out parts of their flesh, digging deep into the skin to carve cruel pictures onto their bones. The wolf wanted to run away and hide, but as he was trapped inside the tortured human’s body, he grew more and more furious with every second. Meanwhile Remus felt his control slip with every additional second. He was screaming, his throat raw and his face frozen into a mask of pain. But Remus knew pain. He had known pain since his childhood, had grown up with it and still lived with it every single month. He knew pain and even while being torn apart, he was able to gain some control over his body. From somewhere far away he could hear the mad witch’s gleeful laugher, and he felt a rush of hatred fueling his efforts to gather his magic. On the outside his body shook with spasms of pain, but in the inside Remus was pushing it all aside, fighting for a clear mind.
: we’ll be careful, I promise, and we’ll come back before it gets dark
LOVE YOU.
: those are suspiciously detailed examples
: same
: bro…. yes bro
: H do u need us to come upstairs?

: Well, that explains where Blaise has been the whole day too
: next to “didn’t chose this but might as well make the best out of it”
: my father wouldn’t survive without her
: I just wanna watch the world burn

Seamus – IfFoundReturnToDean
: so bad

: and Flitwick just really quietly said “I’m gonna levi-lose my shit”
: umm…. A few meters? Onto the roof of our school
: MALFOY
Just… just tell him to hold on to Ms. Granger, yes? And for Merlin’s sake, stop forcing the boy to take Potions, you’re making both him and Severus miserable. Ron doesn’t even want to be an Auror anymore, though I’m not sure “Professional Memer Hell Yeah” is an acceptable alternative.
Come on, Perce, is he there yet??
come back to the dorms we gotta have a talk
: he’s number three

SHOT THROUGH THE HEART
I'm SO sorry for the wait everyone, but this last week was really draining and I was not in the mood for comedy at all.

spell into the man’s chest. While it wasn’t the intended use of the spell, it did its work very effectively. Rodolphus was thrown off his feet and almost crashed into his wife several meters behind him.

: also, hypothetically

: Well. Ehm, Harry, first of all in the name of our team and all our listeners, it’s great to have you here.
: we wanted to wait with that
: I am confused about who I am supposed to threaten so
: in third grade I had an argument with Lucius during the winter holidays and I lost my only friend for almost three months
BACKSTORY TIME
: you know Harry genuinely looks up to you, right?
Molly turned around to face Dumbledore again. “One and a half months! And you heard Severus – under which conditions they held him in that horrible prison. No food, no water, no light…”. She started crying again, with her husband rubbing her back helplessly.
Neville – Knockyourwood
: u haven't slept in ur own bed ONCE this week
: u know that sev wrote potion books?
fuck Nott Sr.
Cause it's called 'Clueless' !!!!!
: well it combined my 2 fav things: dragons and quidditch

: im still shook by weasley’s flirting game
: and rly it’s nor like me and draco had much of a choice

: nothing but the thought of missing something else to learn
: so gross

: what did you do
P.S: Harry and Draco were busy trying to teach Herbert how to fly. And also making out.
She looked at a wizard in the far corner, dressed completely in black. Although he was part of the Order and on the same side in the war as they all were, he seemed to stand apart. Severus Snape returned her questioning look with cold eyes. “About one and a half months. This confirms the words of Calver and Korrham, the Death Eaters who were guarding Potter’s cell.”
: To quote my son: “Nah”.
: ur awesome
Enjoy!

: are u fucking kidding me percy
: Is anyone even fucking straight in this chat
: rip the Smith, he won’t be missed
is Narcissa Malfoy, which I think suits her perfectly :D
: but also yea, the Malfoy thing makes sense now
Luna doesn’t understand the concept of using something else than your name as your chatname.
: at Hogwarts? Anything is possible
: I'm not good at it so don't ….. expect too much of it
wait who is “Cuthbert”?? sounds like a fake name to me
: I mean we are GRATEFUL dammit
: because of slytherin?
: can I come too
: btw

: *doubt*
ILivedBitch – Harry <3
: oh yeah?

Sinistra: Horrorscopes

Harry furrowed his brows and stared at the snake in confusion.
: pls mione we had this discussion just a few days ago
TheSmarterOne – Padma Patil
: I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO
I can’t believe we’re actually doing this
: so why does Malfoy know about this??
: This is worse than I thought.
: h i g h k e y  s c a r e d
: 1 u dropped your phone again, ddint you
: You grew up in the muggle world, right? That must have been difficult, knowing you are different from everyone else.
: “look at me, I’m Harry bloody Potter”
: wait which wall???
: also im an owl
Yes, Mr. Weasley.
: yes please do

: I was at the top of the game and then I went to Hogwarts
: and I’m sure mum and dad would be proud too
: excuse you
: I saw my opportunity and I was sleep-deprived enough to TAKE IT
: what
: I’m getting Dobby’s triple Cs who was talking about alcohol??
: I don’t think anyone can make draco malfoy feel obligated to do anything
: I’m not going to open the door
Through the haze of sensing his magic he could hear a by now familiar chuckle beside him. The snake which had opened his eyes was still there, protecting and guiding him.
SLYTHS
: but he’s very powerful so it’s easier to accept
: send me a pic?
: its canon
: yes don't worry Draco
Harry tugged at his hair, leaving it in even more of a mess than its normal state. Just like his life. Why did stuff like this always happen to him?
: apparently
: WHY are there so many of them???
: I know right, he’s amazing
: wtf no don’t do that
: how did u manage to convince harry to help you again?
: Hermione would never question the textbook, so she followed everything to the letter
: I guess
: it’s also okay to be angry about feeling conflicted
: their first fight
: then yes, we are filtering your mail
: TrYING his BEST
: must have been my inner Slytherin
: sending two toddlers in a raincoat and telling them to pretend to be harry potter has less potential of ending in a catastrophe tbh

: also that sensitivity and emotional intelligence training mione forced us to do was actually helpful
: …. oh well, I am sure Minerva would agree that a pet turtle would be completely harmless and might bring some joy to the students
“Those boys are the best thing that could possibly have happened to Draco.  You should be pleased that he has them.  Besides, Harry is the only one who can give you access to the Manor. So you need to learn to play nice with him.  I believe you once saved his life for the sake of your son, surely you can manage to be polite to him for the sake of Draco as well.”
Draco looked up and laughed.  He didn’t know what he’d do without Pansy.  She had seen him through his worst and somehow still managed to make him laugh, even when he felt like a walking catastrophe.  Catching the nearest waiter’s eye, he ordered an overpriced bottle of champagne and a collection of pretentious cakes and sandwiches.  They proceeded to spend the rest of the afternoon in a much lighter mood.  Eating the delicious, if overpriced food, enjoying the spa and laughing at the mistakes their friends had made over the years with their love lives.
“Thanks.”
“Harry… Don’t say that.”  Draco moved so his face was close and hovering just above Harry’s. He looked completely distraught.
____________________
“Hasn’t Harry already told you everything?”
Harry started grasping at straws. “We could tell people.” Draco scoffed at this.  Harry knew exactly why.  His side of the war were the sticking point and had been since the beginning.  Ever since the day Draco bumped into them in Diagon Alley, he knew that neither his family nor the public would be accepting of this relationship.  Even when Draco came off probation, and Harry would at least not be breaking at least a dozen departmental rules by being with Draco, their relationship wouldn’t just be frowned upon, people would actively try and tear them apart.  The risk to Draco’s safety would be enormous.  If it had been him alone that was likely to end up hurt, then he’d take the chance any day in order for this relationship to be real, but he couldn’t do it to Draco. “Fine, we can’t tell people.  But we could leave.  Go somewhere where no one cares.”
“Can’t we keep it quiet, till they come home at Christmas”
“How many are there, Harry?”  Remus enquired.
Al and James looked at each other knowingly and then left the room leaving her and Scorp alone with their Dads’. Scorpius and Mr Malfoy sat down on the chairs opposite the one her Dad was sitting on.  Lily remained in his lap.
“Yes.  But don’t let go.”  Harry squeezed Malfoy’s hand harder in reassurance.  Nothing would have made him let go.
“That’s the attitude.  You seem a bit more like your old self today than you did last time.”
“Headmistress McGonagall has invited you publicly to attend the 25-year anniversary celebration of the battle of Hogwarts – are you planning on going?”
It wasn’t fair, but changing a significant part of how their world worked wasn’t exactly something two teenagers lost in time could manage.  At least not yet.  It would take a lot more political clout than they currently had.  Their seats in the Wizangamot were one thing, but what they really needed was networking and connections.  Peers that would work with them and agree with them when it came to voting.
“If…if… you want to…”  Harry said, shyly – stuttering slightly.
not Potter’s baby.” Another nod from Draco and he waited for Pansy to read to the end of the letter.
“If you need anything at all, we’re here, okay.”
Lily didn’t know how she got the courage to go up Scorpius that morning.  She thought it may have mostly been Hugo’s teasing that eventually made her do it.  Then he said yes, causing her heart to race in excitement, rather than the anxiety previously driving its rapid pace.  Then the anxiety set back in.  She seemed to have spent the whole day in a whirl of emotions.  One minute looking forward to seeing Scorpius that evening, the next dreading it and trying to find ways to get out of it.  Hugo was not helping at all.  He thought her panic was funny.  Lessons seemed to move both too fast and too slow at the same time.  When dinner time eventually arrived, Lily picked at her food before leaving the table having sat down for less than five minutes.  She knew it would be at least an hour before Scorpius came to meet her in the Library.  She guessed he would wait for Al to start Prefect duty.  She headed there anyway, finding a quiet spot near the back where her and Scorpius could have some peace.
“You need to go see Madame Pomfrey.  You’re both bloody freezing and soaking wet.  Neither of you were well to begin with it seems.  You need a healer.”
“Good.  Could you please lay the table for me and Sirius.  As well as little Harry and little Draco.  Draco’s mother isn’t very well and will be in her room.  I’d appreciate it if you brought her a tray of something.”
Scorpius began unpacking the feast as Hugo, Lysander, Rosie and Al plonked themselves down on the blanket, Rosie casting a quick engorgement charm so they would all fit.  After eating the group spent an hour running round the park and playing on the children’s playground.  Then they all headed back into the village as a group to do some shopping before they had to be back at the school.  It was approaching 4 o’clock when they walked through the gates to the castle grounds.  Lily and Scorpius separated at the entrance hall, as Lily wanted to go put her stuff back in her room and get cleaned up before dinner.  Scorpius went back to his dorm in Slytherin to do the same, accompanied by Al, chatting happily about their day and the feast planned for the following evening.
“And I thought I was insatiable?”
Draco was feeling on edge.  He could feel that bubbling sensation that often pre-empted him becoming manic.  He knew that Blaise and Harry were both worried about him tipping the other way.  About him becoming non-responsive, but he knows better.  He knows the other end of his disease is the one that is currently threatening the edges of his sanity.  Dealing with the constant ups and downs had been part of his life for years.  The Black madness was something, in his youth, that he’d written off as unfortunate but unimportant; only affecting other people.  He was the perfect heir.  He obeyed his parents’ every wish.  Why would he ever be affected by something so… uncouth.  It was the attack from that thrice damned hippogriff that was the start of it.  The attack had started the swinging of the pendulum further and further to the edges of extremes.  It hadn’t been very noticeable until fourth year, and then the swinging had got more violent.  Days of no sleep.  Days of needing to do everything and anything.  It was almost a relief when the depression of his 6
“And we’re are both immensely glad for that.”  Draco said, cheekily.  Harry could tell that he wasn’t unaffected by the knowledge that Harry had been in enough pain to vocalise it.  Draco was trying to put on a brave face.
“I know… It’s pretty bizarre.  But you can smell it right.  I could the first time I transformed into Padfoot.”
“Am I? How?” Lily responded coyly, trying to play innocent, but hoping what he said was true.  The way he said it made her want to make him loose control.
“Not really.  Look, Ginny has been your friend for almost 30 years and your wife for nearing 20 of those.  You know her best.”
“Do you need us to gag the press?”
“I’m tired too.”
Draco put Teddy on the floor again, and the boy tore out of the room as fast as his little legs could carry him.  Harry and Draco, followed more sedately behind him, although making sure he stayed in sight.
“Um… a bottle of…” Teddy scanned through the wine list and wished Draco were there to choose.  He was so much better at these sorts of things.  He ended up just pointing champagnes three quarters of the way down the menu and hoped it would be okay.
“And you’ll let me and Harry continue to call you Tom.”
“It’s definitely a factor.  And it was hard, especially at the beginning.  Draco was really unwell, which didn’t help.  Harry was just as messed up, albeit in a vaguely more functional way, but wouldn’t admit to his problems far too often.  Even now, when they are so much better, they’re both pretty much disasters half the time.”
“I think things are going to be a bit busy pretty soon.”
Collecting the Horcruxes turned into a much simpler task than any of them could have imagined.  Certainly an easier task than Dumbledore had made it out to be in the future.    Harry and Draco collected the cup the following day from Gringotts.  They already had plans to go and decided to kill two birds with one stone.  They spent about an hour with the Goblins confirming Draco as the head of the Malfoy family, as well as the Lestrange one – that trial had been rushed through and the brothers and Bellatrix were already sentenced to Azkaban, leaving Draco free to take up the title of head of the household.  This, most importantly, allowed him access to the family vaults, where, as Narcissa had predicted, in the Lestrange vaults, the cup was located.  They also sorted themselves new identities.  They were now much safer under the guises of Orion Malfoy and Henry Potter.  The other thing they were able to do was to name their little versions as their heirs, ensuring that they had legal guardianship over them.  It meant that if Dumbledore ever did find out that little Harry wasn’t where he’d put him, there was very little he could do to take him away from them.  They wanted to avoid that confrontation if they could, however.  There was one thing Dumbledore had gotten right about his plan for little Harry to be raised by the Dursleys.  Little Harry was probably better off not being raised in the spotlight, and if Dumbledore tried to fight for custody, there was no doubt in their minds that it would end up as media circus.
“Will you… please don’t tell anyone else about where I am.  I don’t think anyone else would understand.”  Harry begged
Hermione remembered reading that passage to Rose for the first time, then telling her about how her and Ron had become friends after battling a troll in the Hogwarts bathrooms all those years ago.  The scene from the book had been so similar, but not quite.  There were other scenes like that, now she thought about it.  The whole fifth book had been about Fred Wolfstar rescuing his best friend from the bottom of a giant lake.  The inspiration could only be the sodding second task from fourth year.  Evan James wasn’t exactly a subtle pseudonym either, not if you really thought about it.  Did that mean the dedication was meant for her and Ron?  She could feel tears welling up in her eyes.
“Lily, you can hold her.” He tried to reassure his daughter.
“Healers aren’t as good as you at grooming charms.”
Lily wasn’t sure how much time had passed.  She must have fallen asleep at some point and she felt drowsy and disorientated, unsure what had woken her but not really caring.  She just wanted to go back to sleep so she could forget about everything.  There was a knock on the door.  This confused her slightly as nobody usually knocked on the dorm door.  Her roommates obviously didn’t, and Hugo almost never bothered.  She peeped out from under the duvet to see who was there.  It was Hugo.  He was stood in the open doorway, looking at her.  The knocking had clearly just been to get her attention.
“Potter.  Have you not been listening to a word I’ve been saying?  If anyone finds out what happened yesterday, I’ll be accused of using magic in some nefarious way to control you.  Even if they just find out that you’re visiting here more than you should officially, you’ll end up in trouble with the Aurors, and I’ll end up locked away under suspicion of manipulating or tricking you.”
“And what do you expect me to do?” Al said.
Draco was asleep, curled up in the hospital bed.  Harry and Blaise were still awake though.  Harry sat on Blaise’s lap in one of the comfortable armchairs in the room.
“You two are more important than my job.”
“How long?”
They sat in uncomfortable silence, each drinking their tea slowly.
“What’s the significance of that specific room in Hogwarts?  From what you’ve told me before I thought you and your mystery man used to sneak around half the castle.” Doris asked,
“What Doris says?”  Draco sounded puzzled.
“Yup.  So I ended up going round to theirs and shouting at them.  I know they didn’t mean to do it, but he was a state and I had to leave him like that in order to reassure them.  He was the one that needed me.”
“Mipsy, Draco has just had a bit of a shock.  Could you bring us something to drink?  I’m going to take him into the study.”
“Your cousin made it especially for Grandma Andi.  He’s very good at making cake.”  With Andi downstairs and unable to hear them, Harry felt comfortable about talking more freely about his lovers.  The toddler wasn’t quite at the stage where he’d be able to give away Harry’s secrets.  “One day I’m going to introduce you to him.  I’m sure he’ll adore you as much as I do.  So will Blaise.  He’s Harry’s other friend.  He doesn’t make cake, but he will draw you lots of pretty pictures.”
“I know I made a huge mistake, but do you really want to throw away the years we’ve had together”
“What the fuck was the ferrety, failed, Death Eater doing in your house, and more importantly why was he wearing what appeared to be one of your jumpers?”
“Can’t do what exactly?  I can’t comfort you when you’re upset.  Can’t touch you when it’s all I can think about.  When I got here this morning you had shut down.  I don’t think you know how much it hurts me when you’re like that.  I know you can’t help it.  But I can’t help wanting to help you either.  I felt like it was all my fault for leaving yesterday.  But it had been such a good day, and you were in such a good mood.”
“It wasn’t all locked up then, remember.”
“It will be with you shortly.”
________________
“Not a bloody clue.”  He husband answered, unhelpfully.
“Fun.  We’re just learning in the Slytherin common room.  The NEWT students are particularly pissed off at the lack of practical learning and they weren’t going to let her stop them getting the grades they want.”  Blaise responded.
Blaise snorted at the teasing.  It made this whole thing feel a little less weird.  He looked at the two other boys.  He had a similar feeling to Harry’s statement.  It was rather fun to look at the two naked boys in the bath.  Alcohol was definitely helping.  The room felt smug.  It had known what to do.  It could feel the magic of the three of them and wanted them to be happy and together.   It was important.
“It’s possibly not, by itself, but losing interest in activities is a sign of depression.  He told me he was upset that we didn’t see it for what it was.”
Hermione flinched slightly under his glare.
When they reached the office, Lily was surprised to see Al and James walking towards the entrance too.
“Like you can resist getting your hands on anything muggle related.  Just think what your Father would say.  Besides, they also have games on them.”
“You shouldn’t worry about me, guys.  I’m not the one who’s going to be affected by this.  It’s just my fault…”
“If you think it might help her.  I wouldn’t want anyone to have to go through it alone like I did.”
“Draco…”
“Seriously.”
“I don’t understand.  Nothing in our research said anything like this would happen.”  Remus said.
“Neither do I.  But maybe two heads are better than one.  You clearly don’t want to do whatever it is that has been slowly killing you over the last year.  And don’t try to deny it, you look like shit.  Maybe I can think of a way out of it that you wouldn’t have thought of.”
Hugo considered for several long seconds. “Wait there.”  He then disappeared, presumably into one of the dorms.  Scorpius had no choice but to stand like a lemon and wait for Hugo to come back.  It felt like and age had passed with waiting, but in fact it can’t have been more than five minutes when Hugo returned.
“Well, it’s just one more thing to add to the list of things to look into.  Do you two want to learn how to produce one? It took me bloody ages, but if we start now, hopefully you’ll have it by the end of the year.”  Potter sounded genuinely enthusiastic about teaching the two Slytherins a charm that many people never mastered.
“I guess it is.  He’s not going to come back.  Are you going to sign the papers?” Hermione replied.
“Not just yet Dad.  You take her.  Please.”
“I don’t want to be a father right now.  I want to finish Hogwarts and hang out with my friends.  I’m not ready for that kind of responsibility.  I love her.  But I don’t want to have a child now and have my life be determined by one stupid night where I wasn’t thinking.  When I get have a child, I want it to be because I’m ready. When I have kids, I want it to be because of a decision not a mistake.” His voice small as he confessed this.  He knew his father wouldn’t judge him for it.
Harry was shivering with cold.  He could feel snow between his fingers.
“Draco…” Harry asked warningly.
“Already knew that.  My father held me under the cruciatus curse this summer on the megalomaniac’s orders.”
“That’s the blood ward keeping mother and me in here down.  We can apparate up to the main house now.  It’s a bloody long way to walk.”
“Oh… Sorry.”
“They think we’re back together.”
“You know, the three of us.  We’re here for you.  Whatever you need.  Harry and Draco have an abundance of free time, and the last thing I need is them being bored in this place.  I’ll end up coming home one day to find the whole place up in smoke if they don’t have something to occupy themselves with.  And they adore Teddy.”
“Very eloquent Potter. And how exactly are you planning to do that?”
They batted ideas around like this for a little while, some sensible, others frankly ludicrous.  Harry was feeling more optimistic about the whole ridiculous scheme.  It ended up being a decidedly pleasant meal, and conversation until, over dessert, Pansy came up with another idea.
Harry opened his eyes.  He felt disorientated.  Even more disorientated than he’d felt when he and Draco had ended up back in 1981, which was saying something.  His mind was trying to put together what had happened.  Looking around the room he spotted Draco.  He seemed to be in a similar state to Harry.  Then he noticed the two older wizards.  Their wands were raised.  Aggression all over their features.  The memories hit him like an assault.  No.  They couldn’t be allowed to do it.  He doesn’t care what the plan was anymore.  He pulled his aching body, with as much speed as he could manage, towards the naked boy in the centre of the room.  Draco was next to him, clearly having come to the same realisation and done exactly the same thing.  They had to protect Tom.  They had promised.
“Because sitting here and waiting isn’t exactly productive.”
“Tell someone.”
“You see if you can find that menu whilst I run this into Blaise. Okay.”
Draco was glad that he had double potions with the Gryffindors third period.  If he hadn’t, he would have made some kind of commotion in the Great Hall to get away with what he was about to do.  Instead, all he’d have to do was sabotage someone else’s potion.  Given it was Severus’ class, he knew he wouldn’t get into trouble, even if the potions professor found out.  As he was walking to the cupboard to get some ingredients, he managed to drop the porcupine quills into Longbottom’s cauldron unnoticed.  He’d timed it perfectly.  Just as he was making his way back, past Potter’s desk, Longbottom increased the temperature underneath his potion and it exploded.  In the chaos that ensued, Draco was able to place the note and ointment into Potter’s open bag.  Hopefully, Potter would find it before his detention that evening.  Draco wasn’t sure, but he thought he’d know as soon as the detention started whether his plan had been successful.  It hadn’t taken long for him to conclude that Potter could be the only explanation as to cause of his hand hurting so badly the night before.  He still didn’t understand why it had happened, but there was no way it was a coincidence.
“I inherited it when I was 17.  It was Harry’s.  He got it off his godfather, who was technically the last of the Blacks, although if Draco wanted to, he could take up the title.  Technically so could I through my mother’s side of the family.  I think Draco gets priority though in succession law as Andi was disinherited and he’s one generation older than me.  It also helps that he’s a pure blood.  It’s all a pile of bollocks though.  Harry’s godfather left him the property and the rest of the Black estate, and he handed this place down to me.  He doesn’t like coming here and has only been in the place once since I took it over.  Look forget about all that, it’s not important.  Come through to the living room and I’ll light a fire.”
“Not anymore.” Harry was unwilling to give any more information than that out about Malfoy.  He didn’t think it would be too hard to discover that one of his children was friends with a widowed old school rival of Harry’s, and as much as he trusted Doris with his secrets, this would be too big and it would only take one slip, anyone spotting the name of Draco Malfoy paired with his to cause scandal.
“One Americano with oat milk.”  Teddy announced, when he reached the table and sat down.  It was felt a little awkward with the two of them sat there.  Teddy was a virtual stranger.  Justin began to put three sachets of sugar in the drink.  He liked his coffee sweet, but mostly he was doing it to distract himself from the man opposite.
“They were.  I was only 13 and I still remember how it felt being around the two of them that day.”
“I would request that you don’t come to the gate at the Manor.  Draco doesn’t like it when anyone gets too close.  Harry can sense when people arrive here.  He’s the one who determines who can come and go freely from here, as well as the Manor.”
“Okay.  So staying away at night isn’t going to work for the time being then.”  Blaise rolled his eyes.  “Why’d I let myself get dragged into this?”
“Well I think there is only one solution for now.  How about we take the rest of this wine; maybe get a second bottle decanting just to be safe; and go sit in your hot tub and get plastered whilst you tell me what Potter is like to fuck and fill me generally in on all the sordid details.”
“I have one question.  When I do this, will the wards reset preventing those who previously had access to the property from entering?”  This had been a major concern for the two of them.  Although Harry had said he didn’t want to go back to Grimmauld, there were personal items that should still be there, that he wanted.  He knew Harry could have entered the property and changed the wards manually, but it was a slow process and risked being found.  This way the wards would reset instantly.  It would mean Draco and Harry could go to Grimmauld for one last time.  Draco knew it would be hard on Harry, it would be hard on him too, but he wasn’t going to deny him the chance to collect the few things his parents had left him.
Blaise looked stunned at Harry’s pronouncement.  “I know you suggested it before, and I know you know that both me and Draco would be happier if we didn’t have to worry about you quite so much, but you don’t have to, you know.”
“Don’t really want to eat in bed, but not sure I can manage sitting at the table.  Sofa and a crappy film?”  Harry replied, quickly assessing the options.
“You don’t need to decide now.  Let’s go home.  Mother and Andi should have headed out on their latest holiday, as planned.  We’ll call Blaise and see if he can keep Teddy overnight.  He spent the day there, and Merlin knows what trouble Blaise has let him get into.  He may be seventeen, but I still worry when he’s around Blaise for too long.  Bad influence that he his.”  Draco was pleased that this earned him a smile from his husband.  He kissed Harry lightly before continuing.  “Even so, I think it’s best if he stays there a little long than planned.  We need some time to ourselves.  We can be alone in our beautiful house.  I have an amazing bottle of whiskey that is just asking to be opened and drunk.  We’ll spend the evening in the hot tub with the house elves bringing us canapés.  Then we can wrap ourselves up in our huge bed, and I can show you exactly how much I love you until you fall asleep in my arms.  The morning will be soon enough to work out what you want to do next.”

“We will do everything to protect Harry and if that means we have to keep quiet about him being nowhere to find, so be it. We’ll tell them about the safe house. But Ron and Hermione are already worried because their letters all returned to them unopened. And the seventh school year will start in only two weeks. How will we explain Harry’s absence if we haven’t found him until then?”

Dumbledore quickly threw some floo powder into the flames of his fire place and called out the name of his loyal friend’s home. He waited anxiously, but managed to hide his surprise as the green flames formed into blond hair instead of black one.

I will still use AO3, but I can't stand even looking at my profile name, because I feel guilty for disappointing y'all. But now I have a chapter, so I allowed myself to look at your comments (WHICH I WILL ANSWER. EVERY SINGLE ONE.) and ... people. My people. The only reason I'm not crying is because I'm at Starbucks right now.

“You have chocolate on your face.  Do you know that?”
“Then we can stay there.”
“Harry!”
Andi took a sip of her tea before she spoke.
“It’s a pile of bollocks though.”
_________________
“Seems like a plan.  Wish the room could help us understand this weird link a bit better, not just giving us solutions to the short-term problems though.”
“Love you, Draco.”
“It’s fine, Scorpius. We should probably go find the others now anyway.  I’m not sure I want them to stumble on us like this.”
“And you’d know all about that.”
“Don’t you love that we’re each other’s favourites.”  Harry said.  Smiling at Draco.
“No…! You and him.  Back then.  Just the once or was it…?” Pansy looked at him again and seemed to read his mind, raising her eyebrows at him.  “How in the name of Morgana did you keep that a secret?”
“We’re planning on having the Wedding next summer, after school’s finished.”
It had been 10 years now, and no one had seen or heard anything from Harry Potter.  He’d just disappeared.  Hermione and Ron had searched but there had been no trace of him.  The Auror’s had searched too but had had no better luck.   They’d gotten reports from all of the witnesses that had seen him dash madly through the Ministry that day but hadn’t been able to track his movements any further.  It had taken them six weeks to break through the wards on Harry’s old room in Grimmauld place.  Ron and Hermione had had to get Bill in to do it in the end.  The room had been filthy when they’d finally gotten in.  It smelled musty and unused, and there was dust coating every surface.  Worse, the sheets looked like they hadn’t been washed in months and Hermione had winced in disgust at the obvious semen stains.  The t-shirt and jacket Harry had been wearing when he ran out of their house had been left abandoned on the floor.  They’d found his phone in the jacket pocket.  The last text message he’d received didn’t hold many clues.  It had come from an unknown number, and the message itself didn’t tell them anything about where Harry might have gone, or why he’d just abandoned his life.  When they tried contacting the number it had been disconnected.  They had managed to trace the last place the phone had been, before whoever it belonged to had abandoned it, but the phone itself was long gone by that point.  They guessed that the owner of the phone had removed the battery before dumping it in a bin at the airport and taking a flight out of the country.  There were no records of Harry Potter on any of the flights that had left in the two weeks following his disappearance.
“That’s disgusting dear, but I’m taking at as ‘yes, I’d be delighted to make you your favourite desert’.”
Harry also continued to see Doris on a fortnightly basis.  He still hadn’t revealed the identity of his mystery man to her.  They stayed mostly focused on how he was feeling in the present.   It was in his last session in November that the Malfoy topic finally came up again, quite by accident.   Harry was talking to Doris about coming out to Lily, and what he had felt at the time about both seeing her with a boyfriend and about how he felt telling her about the divorce and his sexuality.
“Two Harry’s and two Draco’s.”  Sirius confirmed with a wide smile.  Harry’s fun-loving godfather was enjoying this a little too much.
“The biscuits are very important.”  Blaise grinned.  “Although seriously.  Does one of you want to give me a hand?  I feel very left out right now.”
“Scorpius, where have you been?  I was getting worried.” Al said, then he caught a glance at Scorpius’s face. “Fuck, what the hell’s happened?”
Andi didn’t hesitate to answer, and Harry knew he’d made the right decision in offering.  “Harry, you’re an angel.  I can come and find you when I’m done.  I shouldn’t be more than an hour.  Just tell me where to come.”
“You left.  Something happened.  I know it was bad, but I don’t know exactly what it was.”
: as in something that has a lot of fur?
: shut up u survived
: well we would love to have oliver
: Weasley, Percy
Narcissa nodded, no sign of the pain she had endured noticeable in her face. She would do it again and again, endure all the pain her husband and his Lord had thrown at her and even more if it meant she was able to stay at her son’s side.

: W H A T   T H E   F U C K
: Penelope is single again?????
Harry stared at the snake, trying to fight the image of the Sorting Hat deciding which students were ‘stupid’ and should be send into the Forbidden Forest.
: Not for a muggleborn! I thought potions were like cooking for the longest time! When you cook a meal, it often doesn’t matter in which order to put the ingredients into the pot. Or what kind of knife you use. You also don’t need to constantly clean the knife, because everything gets mixed up in the pot anyway. I was never taught all these things because – as you say – for someone who grew up with magic, or for someone who has a natural affinity to potions, these things are obvious. They weren’t obvious to me.
: ok but can we focus on the important things here??
Parvati – thefirstone
he deserves it)

Dean – KeepHim
The cell was small, measuring maybe four square meters. The walls were made from some rough kind of stone, but he couldn’t see the color, as it was completely dark inside his prison. It was cold, and the air was heavy around him. The only noise he could hear was his breath, his heartbeat, and the low hum of his own voice.
I mean he basically contributes as much as Cuthbert at this point

The bird had come back in the morning. It didn’t seem to be afraid of the human sitting in the middle of the forest. It also appeared to be very busy, collecting all kinds of small branches and fallen leaves. Harry observed it, oddly reminded of his friend Hermione. She also appeared to be busy all the time, always researching something, having new ideas and running around. And she always had the need to solve every problem in the exact same moment it occurred.
: I'm the dad tbh
: so me and Harry were texting last night bc we both couldn’t sleep and we can do that these days without u know insulting each other and that’s still kinda making me nervous bc I could easily fuck that up so… I might have started rambling

Hermione sighed and turned towards her boyfriend. “It’s okay, Ron. We will simply have to make a stop at a Muggle bank to get the money. It’s probably quicker than changing Galleons into pound anyway.”
: HARRY DO YOU HAVE A PET DRAGON????
Crabbe – Muffin #1

Her partner’s face was expressionless, but he raised a single eyebrow, his wand still pointed at Remus. “Remus Lupin, isn’t it? Didn’t you teach at Hogwarts? No wonder that our children learn nothing at all when their teachers are stupid enough to trigger every single ward in the area.”
Ok, bye mum.

Ron – CannonBALLS
: …. I feel like this isn’t the first time you thought about this
“How about Charlus?”  Sirius said, strolling into the room with a wolfish grin on his face and Narcissa at his side.  “It’s a family name and I hardly think you want to go by your grandfather’s name.  Fleamont is a ridiculous name.”
“It wouldn’t have worked between us any better though, would it.” Harry said, approaching the forbidden subject.
“Can’t forget them can we.” Draco sighed.
“Well it’s not something that he really talks about.  Him and mother got married in order to have me.  He sat me down and told me when I was twelve.  Gave me the whole love is love speech and explained how him and mother got together and why although he wouldn’t change me for anything, that he didn’t expect me to have an arranged marriage just for kids, no matter what.  It wasn’t just about gender, I think it was to do with the whole blood status thing too.  The last thing he ever wanted me to think, was that the Pure-Blood rhetoric that he was raised in was the right way to view the world.”
“Molly has him, she picked him up from nursery earlier.  Andi told her about wanting to be there for her sister tonight and Molly practically leapt at the chance.  I think Victoire is staying there too.  Bill and Fleur wanted a date night before the new baby arrives.”  Harry answered, then, turning towards Draco, nudged the seemingly distracted blonde with his shoulder.  “You doing okay, love?”
“Me too” Hermione said, as if that wasn’t a given. “Are you going to stay in the castle, or commute from here?”
__________________
“She did.  Now come here.  I want to celebrate no longer being married.”  And Harry reached out to pull Draco into his lap.  Harry could feel himself getting hard as he kissed Draco, whilst the other man straddled him.  Harry stood up and with Draco’s legs wrapped around his waist, carried the man he loved into their bedroom.
“Well it’s either that or they hear it from the papers”
“It’s from Molly.”  Harry answered, turning on his stool so he was facing Draco.  “She wants me to come over on Sunday.”
“Yes.”
“Potter am I now, Malfoy.”  Harry sneered right back
“You need to stop this Potter.  It doesn’t matter anymore.  It doesn’t matter that you love me.  It doesn’t matter how I feel.  We can’t be together.  Aren’t the papers celebrating your upcoming nuptials with the Weasley girl, enough to tell you that? What do you think they’d all be saying if it was us?  Do you think they’d all be celebrating?  Do you think your family would be smiling and happy at the thought of us together?”
“Cake.  Cake.  Cake.  Cake.”
“Can you give points too?”  Blaise said, with a very devious grin.
“What?” Malfoy sounded curious.
Draco’s sessions always started pretty much the same, discussing one or other of his major anxieties.  Lateness was a common topic.  The first time he’d come to the office, nearly 20 years ago, he’d arrived over an hour early and had a panic attack when he’d gotten stuck by the lift for 5 minutes.  The thought of being late for anything was still a major trigger for his anxiety, but it had improved with Doris’s help.  One of the most important lesson he learnt from Doris over the years was that he’d probably always have anxiety, but that he could learn how to manage it and not let it overwhelm him; that he could still function even with all of his issues.
“Not sure.” Harry watches as Malfoy fumbles next to him and grabs a wand.  He casts a tempus charm.  “It’s just gone 7pm.”
“Things like me and Ginny.” Harry sighed.  “Draco broke up with me the day I got too drunk to remember.  It was why I was drinking.”
“No.  It’s not him.  Well it is.  But it’s not entirely his fault.  I told him it was over.  He came to see me this evening.”
“Because I was a prat.”
“I mean… Before… back there… If it had come to it.  If it was die and save the world, or live and let Voldemort destroy everything.  I know what I would have done.”
The picnic on the lawns was lovely.  Tori’s eight and nine-year-old girls were playing with a quaffle and running around and laughing.  Draco held the 9-month-old baby in his lap, playing peek-a-boo and delighting in the babyish giggles he was causing.  Tori had always wanted lots of kids, but Theo had been reluctant.  Tori had won out, or well lucked out, as Draco knew that at least little Timothy, had been an accident – one caused at one of his and Harry’s parties and mostly likely the result of Blaise being in charge of the drinks again.  He was pretty certain Cleo, their eight-year-old, had been the result of a forgotten charm too, but Theo had never admitted to that slip up.  Despite not wanting a large family, Theo loved his four children, the eldest of whom was at Hogwarts at the moment, and he was completely devoted to Astoria.  Draco was eventually dragged out of his internal musings about his friends by Astoria speaking.
“Hey baby girl, you awake?”
He was placed in the middle of the bed, an arrangement of pillows waiting to prop him up.
“You know I don’t want her.” Harry said and reached his hand to touch Draco’s face.  He didn’t want Draco to be mad at him.  He needed him to forgive him for his appalling cock-up.  “You know I only want you.”
“The music doesn’t matter.  Just dance with me.”
Before Harry left, he put himself on the rota for Thursday and Monday mornings for the next month.  Angelina said he’d get a chance to spend time with a few of the different classes and age groups.  He hoped that his Dad skills would remain intact for dealing with older children, as well as babies and toddlers.  He’d gotten very used to only dealing with teenagers now all of his three were at Hogwarts.  Getting home he found a pile of mail stacked neatly on his kitchen table.  Most of it was rubbish that he promptly vanished; adverts and what looked like an invite to speak at some event that he had no intention of replying to.  There was also a letter from Ginny.
“Then show me.  This is more important than what the Ministry thinks is good or evil.  The Ministry approves Umbridge and we all know she’s a slimy evil little toad.”
“I’ll do what I have to.  Whatever she thinks is best for her I want to help her with it.  I’m not leaving her alone to deal with this.”  Scorpius felt determined in this.  Knowing his father was behind him whatever happened gave him the courage to move forward.  He would tell Lily what he wanted but also let her know that he would back her decision.
“You are more than I could ever have wished for, my son.”
Soon Draco was straddling Harry.  His shirt was undone, and Harry’s t-shirt was lying abandoned on the floor next to them.  Draco relished the feel of Harry’s tongue against the skin on his chest.  Kisses trailing each of the scars.  Both of them still wore trousers but Draco could feel Harry’s erection hard against his own through the layers of fabric. His breathing was getting quicker, and he could hear and feel that Harry’s was doing the same.
“Start over from the beginning.  If you need to have the house constantly being redecorated, then that’s what you should do.  They won’t complain.  They’d do anything to make you happy.”  Harry would too, but he didn’t say it.
“No buts.” Blaise interjected.  “Go.  You can’t shut out everyone else from your life.  Things are good right now.”
With that Ron grabbed some floo powder from the mantle, throwing a pinch into the fire.  He stepped in and disappeared back to the Burrow.  Harry looked up at the time, it was after midday and he’d missed breakfast, his stomach was rumbling.  Heading towards the kitchen with the kitten still in his arms he thought about lunch.
“I get it.  But soon?”
“What was it supposed to do?”
“Well it all seems very positive.  But remember, if there is any sign of trouble, any at all, don’t hesitate to let me know.  Thank you for your good work.”  Harry had to fight to keep the smile plastered on his face when he heard this.  He knew exactly what Kingsley was asking of him and he hated it.  That it was Kingsley dealing with Malfoy, rather than Robards, the head of the DMLE, told Harry everything he needed to know about the Ministry’s attitude towards Draco.  Malfoy was nothing more than a pawn for the new minister to use for political gain.
“What were you going to throw at me?”  Blaise called from the other side of the table, clearly having been listening in to their conversation.
“Pafoo.  Friend.  Dwayco.”  Little Harry said and gave the toy to the small blond toddler.
“Something like that.” Hermione shook her head at the bizarreness of talking to this woman, who apparently knew both Harry and Draco, though she wasn’t sure how well.  “Look I should go.  My husband and kids are waiting at home for me.”
“I…  You seriously brought your godson up here.”
“We can’t change that now.”
“I guess that makes sense.  And it will be an amazing achievement.” Harry said and paused, taking a deep breath “Okay I’m ready.  Let’s go for it.  Don’t blame me if I scratch the furniture or something.”
One of the other’s coughed and pulled the two teenagers from their conversation.
Harry moved to sit on the bed Lily was in.  He pulled her into his arms and hugged her tightly for several long and silent minutes before deciding to speak.
“Hi…”  Justin said, slightly awkwardly.
“What!?”  Ron choked on the bite of sandwich he’d just taken.  Melted cheese was dripping down his chin.
Two weeks apart from Draco and Harry thinks he's going to fall apart.
Harry flattened his hand and stroked against the bulge in Draco’s pyjamas.
______________
“You’re going to have that engraved on your tombstone.”
“All the time.  Doesn’t change things though.  This was how it was supposed to be.”
“But you’ve come close?”  Pansy replied, reading his tone.
Draco had read the short letter through six times already.  He needed to talk to someone or the anxiety that he could feel brewing was going to bubble out of control and he’d end up having a panic attack.  He called one of the house elves and asked them to bring him a couple of glasses and set a bottle of red to decanting before fire-calling Pansy.  She’d been his best friend for years and had known he was gay almost before he had realised himself.  She was also the only one who knew that he’d once had a crush on Potter, even if she didn’t know the full story.  As far as he was aware, the only people who knew the full story were still himself and Potter.  He couldn’t imagine Potter telling anyone.  But then he couldn’t imagine Potter ever getting up the courage to come out either, so maybe the Weaslette now knew everything.  He threw the powder into the fire and watched the flames turn green before kneeling and speaking Pansy’s address.
“I thought you were fine.” Harry laughed at Draco’s antics.
“Yes.” Draco pouted.   He really hated it sometimes when Tara was right like this.
“You’re just too good a person.”  Teddy purposefully moved his hand to stroke down Justin’s arm.
As always, all grammar. spelling mistakes and typos are my own  - and I'm sure there are countless numbers of them.
“No!” Malfoy snapped.
“Everything okay hon?”
“Not that much.  Besides, I don’t care, and I am an adult.”  Justin replied and Teddy felt the warm hand reach under his jumper and hold his waist.
“It’s more…well…” Harry took a breath and then blurted everything out. “Our marriage seems to be falling apart.  She’s never there, and when she is, we either don’t say a word to each other, or we argue.  Something feels wrong, but I don’t know what, and I don’t really know how to fix it.  Hermione and Ron say I just need to sit down and talk to her, treat her to a night out, a holiday, but I’ve got this nagging feeling that she’s hiding something from me.”
“You said blood wards.  Your aunt would have been able to take you from the step in the morning.  That’s what likely linked the wards to her.  But you’re definitely the closest blood relation to you.  You could pick yourself up and then the wards would attach themselves to your blood.  You could pick up baby Harry and we could take him away.  He’ll never see the inside of that house.”
“Don’t worry, there are no Malfoy kittens to stop me today.”
Remus wanted to chastise the boys for revealing so much about the future.  He may have provisionally accepted that they had changed time, but he didn’t see why they needed to reveal future knowledge to everyone else and increase the chance of things going wrong.  He knew it wouldn’t do any good though.  Neither boy seemed to care very much about the whole issue.  Besides, thanks to their meddling with time, it may not even turn out to be true anymore.  Instead he decided to accept that they were just going to reveal things he’d rather they didn’t and said, sensibly.  “So we don’t have to worry about them, yet.”
Harry raised an eyebrow.  James had been wearing a pair of baggy shorts with no shirt and both Susan and Teddy had appeared to be wearing boxers and t-shirts.  He was sure the one Susan had been wearing was one of Sirius’s old t-shirts that had been left in one of the drawers.  He didn’t like the thought of his son spending the night with a girl he’d only known for a few days.  Then, Harry supposed, at least James was an adult.  Lily was still a child and had managed to get pregnant by doing things he definitely didn’t want to think about with his partner’s son.  James having a girl to stay was definitely better than that.
“You were amazing today.”  Harry whispers, not wanting to wake Draco up, who was still softly snoring on the sofa.    “I mean.  I wasn’t sure whether we’d actually manage.  How the hell did you get him to come?  When I left to get Teddy, it really didn’t seem like it would happen.”
