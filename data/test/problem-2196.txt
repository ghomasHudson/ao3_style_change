"We’ve met before, Draco. You were always near. I don’t know much about reincarnation and souls, I’m not sure I even believed in anything like that before. Or maybe I just never thought about it that deeply I guess. But I think it’s very rare to be meeting someone in more then one life. The only other two souls I have met in one of the past lives are Hermione and Luna. But you were in every single one of my lives." Harry said and caught Draco’s hands in his. "You have no idea how special you are to me, Draco."
we have some more fluff and ehm, porn in this chapter. In the next one we will hopefully get somewhere with the story.
"Well, it’s true. I’m Harry Potter, nice to meet you." Harry says and Weasley’s jaw involuntarily drops.
My mother’s love for me was unconditional and uncomplicated. My father’s not so much. But right now, I could see pride in his eyes. Seeing the future was no ordinary skill and nothing one can learn.
"Atonement… partially. I've done terrible things... You have no idea." Harry said and there was this terrible sadness in his voice. "Also, I owed it to your mother, she protected me when the only thing I offered her was an information whether you were alive. Then there is the bathroom incident when I accidentally almost killed you with sectum sempra." Harry said and Draco shuddered. "But that’s not all. I regret not taking your hand when you offered me friendship. I always had friends and especially Hermione covering my back, without her, I wouldn’t have made it so far. I wonder how much different it would have been if we were friends. I know that you had your Slytherins but somehow, you always looked a bit lonely. I might be wrong but they seemed more like your followers then your friends."
"I already did, Draco. Besides all the insults you have thrown my way and me yours pale up when we consider I almost killed you and if Snape wasn’t there at the time, you would have bled to death." Harry said as he reached for the other boy’s hand to hold it. "I’m so sorry I hurt you like that Draco. I swear I didn’t mean to, at the time when I learned the spell, I didn’t know what it does."
I enter Madam Malkin’s and the shop assistant asks me if I need robes for Hogwarts. I say I do and she ushers me onto small stool to take my measurements.
"Draco, you don’t see things clearly. He hurt your mind as much as he hurt your body, maybe even more. Your body needing sex or reacting to touch doesn’t make you a whore. Him, raping you, doesn’t make you dirty or ugly. There is nothing dirty or ugly about you little prince. Nothing." Harry placed a gentle kiss on his forehead. He was determined to kiss Draco as many times as it takes until the blond realizes just how he feels about him.
I decided to take into account a opinion of Homoho3, who wrote in her comment: ”alright boys enough with the chit chat now K-I-S-S”.
When they apparated back to the Grimmauld’s place, it was already evening. They could hear shouting from the sitting room. They quickly hurried there.
"No." Draco whispered. He was lucky Robards phrased the question like that, if he asked whether Draco ever was a Death Eater, the answer would be different.
"Of course he noticed. You are a nice person Hermione. But he is not. The end justifies the means could be very much his motto. Yet he has all those medals and orders and never uses Dark Arts. Such a farce. He definitely didn’t hire Quirell for his teaching skills, the blabbering idiot won’t teach us anything useful. He must have other reasons to keep him close."
Draco felt he wanted more though. His heart hurt thinking that Harry is probably at the moment with little Weaslette, comforting her after the funeral. Merlin, he was a terrible person, Weaslette’s brother died and yet Draco was being jealous about her being with Harry.
I exchanged a few letters with Harry during August, so we got to know each other a bit better. I knew everything about his abusive uncle and aunt from Hermione but reading in a letter from Harry how good day it was, when his cousin left a whole sausage on his plate and he was allowed to finish it, made my heart ache for the boy.
"He can be talented wizard and mad at the same time. He has this friendly grandpa persona going on but …. Look, we can talk about Dumbledore some other time, there are too many ears around now." I say and somebody – oh,  it’s Blaise Zabini, chuckles next to me.
"They say there is Harry Potter on this train, can you believe it?" Weasley asks, and both me and Harry start laughing.
"Stop, Draco. That’s not true. He hurt you but you are still you. Still beautiful." Harry kissed his cheek. "Breathtakingly so." Another kiss, this time to his temple.
"My name is Draco Malfoy." I extend my hand to him. I must not butcher my introduction this time. Better keep it simple.
"Hermione, tell me this is just a dream." the redhead whispered as angry tears started to run down her cheeks.
"Shh, no, no Azkaban. We will go home, Draco." Harry said and Draco pressed himself as close as possible to the black haired wizard, as if touching him could wash away all the humiliation and pain he was feeling.
"I mean about calling you names and being a dick to you." Draco explained and looked her in the eyes.
Draco’s breathing was growing ragged. Harry could tell he was getting close. He traced his thumb over Draco’s soft lips, he wanted to kiss him senseless but was afraid to stop watching his reactions in case something went wrong.
"I will." Harry kissed him tenderly. "I promise I will but not yet. You aren’t ready. You need to heal a bit more my little prince."
"I know that but I also now I will bolt the second I see the fire." Draco mumbled against his neck and Harry sighed.
"You don’t want me. The Dark lord had me and I’m damaged goods and you don’t want me." Draco whispered. He wasn’t going to cry but he couldn’t help it.
"We will be together. I will take care of you, I promise." Harry reassured Draco. "I will be with you the whole time, it will be okay."
"Oh, the little Slytherin that keeps annoying our Ronniekins! We’ve heard all about you," one of them says and I honestly have no idea whether it’s Fred or George, I could never tell them apart.
"It will be quite large, covering your whole forearm and usually it would be done in more then one session but Harry really needs to practise, so I’ve made this tea." Hermione said and gave Michael what looked like a cup of tea. "There are anti-inflammatory agents and strong pain killers in it, it might make you a bit sleepy but it’s absolutely harmless."
"You have nothing to be sorry about, I was the one to scare you, I should have explained." Harry said and brushed hair away from Draco’s face. "Now, I will get under the blanket with you and hold you to warm you up, will that be alright?" Harry asked.
I’m sorted into Slytherin and it pleases me this time as much as it did the last time. It’s not surprising at all, I’m much more fitting to be one now. But when both Harry and Hermione get sorted into Slytherin too I’m besides myself with joy. Weasley watches Harry sit down at our table with open mouth and I can’t help by smirk at him.
"Harry, I…please…don’t" Draco started to say something, not knowing himself what, but panic was hearable in his voice.
"That’s enough! Ginny, you will not talk to Draco like that. I get that it’s a shock for you and I’m sorry but you will not point your wand at him." Harry chastised Ginny who only started to cry more.
I, of course, already learned this so I quickly turn my match into needle and open a book of advanced transfiguration under the desk, not to provoke McGonagall too much. I thought she would be too occupied by helping other students who seem to be struggling  quite a lot. But unfortunately she isn’t.
"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try —" And Harry tries but it doesn’t work either.
"Good," Harry said and leaned above the blond boy to look into his eyes. "Just keep an eye contact with me and think about the memories that you want to show me. I don’t want to hurt you. It will work the best if you stay relaxed and let me in."  Harry said softly.
"I saw him walking with his parents towards the Forbidden forest, " answered one of the younger students.
"People always do. Slytherin is the house with most prejudice against it. It did produce many dark wizards, more then other houses but it also produced the most healers and potioners. I for one, would be proud to be in Slytherin."
"I usually sleep in my underwear." Harry stated, remembering then yesterday Draco panicked when he started to undress. "Will that be okay?"
"I did see a few healers, mother brought me to them secretly. But you see, this is not really common condition. People usually don’t get long time exposure, they either go crazy like Longbottoms, so whoever tortures them gives up or becomes bored. Or they simply die."
"It’s alright, Hermione. I have to go drop Ron there anyway. I will pick up your things and you can stay in the bedroom next to Draco’s, if you would like?"
Draco was kneeling on the ground and softly crying. His hands were clutching and pulling at his dishevelled hair. "Father...father found out mother lied to the Dark Lord. I... couldn't do anything. He killed her... she is gone. Mother is gone." Draco whispered.
"Why? I would say it’s much better here with all the parties involved present. " She snapped and stared at Draco.
"Oh, I see. Thank you Draco. I’m sorry too. I also wasn’t nice to you, I even punched your face once."
I make sure that he doesn’t see it as I write Mr. Ollivander a cheque for thousand galleons. It's more then some people make in their entire life but I am a Malfoy and if there is something I don't have to worry about, it's money. Harry wakes up Hagrid who meanwhile fell asleep on the chair and we leave the shop with our new wands.
"Not at all, my dear Hermione. There are many types of Weasleys, some of them are idiots but some of them are clever and useful." I say and go looking for the redheaded twin terrors.
"No. My father did." Draco replied, shaking. His heart was beating fast and he broke cold sweat. The veritaserum was too strong, he was getting dizzy.
"Oh, shut up, Potter." Draco snapped back and Harry was glad to see he seemed to feel a little bit better.
"No, I finally see things clearly. Great Harry Potter, fucking his best friend’s girlfriend and playing house with death eaters." Smirked Ron and then looked Hermione in the eyes. "I wish I knew what a slut you wer before I started to like you. It’s over between us. You just couldn’t help yourself but spread your legs for the savior, huh? How was it? How did it feel to have-"
"Yes." Draco agreed. He wasn’t worried about the potion. He trusted Snape’s expertise and Hermione’s brewing skills, it was going to work.
"I will not disappoint you father." It would be very hard not to do well at Hogwarts as I already went through the whole curriculum once. Oh, the perks of being time traveller in eleven years old body.
"Calm down, right know I’m the one controlling it, it’s not going anywhere. I can bring us back to the ground but I will not do it."
"You did. No excuses, we don't have time for excuses. What about your mother, Narcissa Malfoy, did you kill her?"
"Tell me." Harry demanded. He wasn’t normally so pushy but he was already high strung since the morning because of the funeral. And then seeing the bruises getting worse and hearing Draco’s statement was just enough to push him to his limits.
"Yeah, Snape did quite a good job patching me up on the spot and then mother hired the best healers in the country to finish the healing." Draco explained.
The truth is, Draco thought, Harry and Weaslette looked good together. Ginny’s long ginger hair, pretty face and full breasts were ideal contrast to Harry’s masculine features. Her body, unlike Draco’s bony one, must be soft all over. Harry probably loved hugging her, kissing her, getting lost in her softness.
"Yeah, don’t worry. It will be like yesterday." Draco mumbled and blushed a bit, averting his eyes from Harry.
"I’m sorry, please don’t be angry, I didn’t mean to, forget it." Draco muttered and avoided his eyes, embarrassed.
"You are so beautiful Draco. I have no idea how could I ever think being friends with you would be enough. I want you. I want all of you."
"It hasn’t been even ten days since I’ve been with him and I’m already spreading my legs for you when you didn’t even ask me to, acting like a bitch in heat. He was right, I’m a whore."
Of course, I will do the same even for Hermione, but she seems to be doing just fine, chatting with Daphne Greengrass. Daphne will be surprised when she finds out Hermione is muggleborn, but I know Greengrasses are pragmatic and value skill and wit over blood. Also, Daphne is no Ron Weasley and has a tact, so I’m not worried she wouldn’t treat her with respect.
It was surreal. Harry walked through the ruins of the broken castle as if in a dream. Voldemort was dead and Harry was back. He looked around, his friends were comforting and healing each other but one person he was looking for was missing, the most important one.
"Yeah, we probably overdid it a bit. Ginny tried to snog me but I didn’t want to, it just wasn’t right." Harry said and Draco paused for a while, surprised Harry rejected Weaslette’s advances even in drunken state but quickly resumed massaging.
As they ate, there was a sudden change in the boy sitting across from him. He grew quiet and began to play with the food on his plate.
As the two walked side by side, Harry couldn’t help but notice how much the man had changed in the past four years. Professional Quidditch suited him… His chest and arms had filled out more and Harry noticed a beautifully even tan spreading across the man’s exposed skin.
Professors Snape and McGonagall came running around the corner and quickly took the children away. Snape took the three boys to the Hospital Wing while McGonagall ushered Harry to a separate room. She began asking him what happened, and he honestly couldn’t even remember. He knew Draco had been insulting him and he knew he used magic, but he had no idea how. He didn’t even remember saying a spell…
“Teddy is my godson. Do you remember Professor Lupin? He is his son, with Tonks.” Draco’s eyes widened. Harry figured he just realized Teddy was technically his cousin.
“Harry…is that why you’ve been acting this way? Did something…did something happen at school?” Remus had a strong tone of concern as he asked the question.
Harry arrived back at the Burrow and was met by a furious Molly Weasley. “You may be Harry Potter, but you are still my child and my responsibility! You can not go apparating off into the night without telling anyone!”
But apparently this statement was all that was needed to wake the younger boys up. “Scorpius can stay over at our house?!” Teddy’s hair flashed a bright yellow before calming back down.
Lily Potter didn’t know what happened, but she knew her Harry was hurting. She continued their drive home because she knew she needed to get her son home. As soon as they entered the door, before Lily could say anything, Harry drug his trunk upstairs and slammed his door. James stared at his wife in shock and confusion.
Changed the rating to 'Mature' for this chapter and the upcoming chapters! As always comments/kudos welcome! Enjoy!
Harry was just about to find himself a space in the living room with his cup of tea when Charlie came around him. “Where’s the boyfriend?”
Harry looked over at the boys and saw they were finished with their meal and were now getting antsy.
“Well…I heard from Pansy Parkinson that Draco is…getting married.” Harry could actually hear his heart stop. He heard its final beat, then nothing else.
“Oh, you mean the Death Eater and the Golden Trio – sharing a meal.” Draco heard the sarcasm in his voice and hated himself for it. He really didn’t mean to be rude. It just…happened sometimes.
Harry had supported himself and Teddy with the money Sirius left him in his will after the war, but once he moved back into Grimmauld – Harry knew he needed to have a job. Something to occupy his time and his mind, but also something that allowed him to be home with Teddy a lot.
“Oh – um…why?” Draco continued to watch as Harry took small sips of his tea while staring directly at Draco to ask his questions.
As his body and head recovered, the events of last night came flooding back to him. He slowly put on some clothes and begin to head to the kitchen. Molly was finishing cleaning-up breakfast and motioned for Harry to sit down. “Figured you needed your sleep – kept you a plate warm, dear.”
Draco had no idea what he was going to do about his father and the deadline. He had no idea what the deadline meant or what would happen if he missed it. But he did know one thing.
Harry honestly didn’t know what to say. Part of him wanted to say “Yes! Absolutely!” because, if he was being honest with himself, he did. But he also knew that this would be a big step and didn’t feel ready.
The two discussed various topics while drinking glass after glass of whisky. They were typically light-hearted mixed with funny stories of their days of Hogwarts (never anything
“I’ll get it!” He came running down the stairs in his final outfit choice – dark jeans and a maroon button-up.
James Potter had talked about the Malfoys a lot as Harry grew up. After Voldemort’s defeat, many Death Eaters escaped and were never found, but some were captured. Lucius Malfoy was taken into the Ministry of Magic but used the defense that he was under the Imperius Curse and therefore did not know what he was doing. He swore that if he had known, he would not have been a part of any of it.
Harry waited several seconds before responding, and even when he did – it wasn’t with words. He moved towards him and closed the small distance that sat between them. He pressed his lips to Draco’s and wrapped one hand around his head. Draco tried to fix his shock and respond back, and quickly found himself pressing back against the man on his sofa.
“This is coming out all wrong” Harry continued. “I’m sorry I left. Like I said, I can be quite impulsive sometimes and I just didn’t know how to deal with what had happened. So, I went to the Burrow. I went and talked to…Charlie actually.”
get over it. We can lay low for a bit or be as in their face about it as we want. It won’t matter. They don’t matter.”
“Maybe. But the more I looked for you this time, the more I had to really think about why I was doing it… So, when this case came up, I thought it would be a good opportunity. If I did find you, I could ask for your help. And then maybe you’d come out of hiding and…back to…” Draco thought for a moment Harry was going to say ‘me’, but quickly changed his mind. “…the wizarding world.”
Harry wanted to turn the attention back towards Draco. “If you don’t mind me asking, where is his mother?” But as soon as the words were out, he wished they weren’t.
Harry knew Remus was right. He had no reason to act this way towards his family. “Fine. I’ll tell you. But I need
Draco couldn’t muster up words in the moment and continued to stare at Harry, who was growing noticeably uncomfortable.
Harry realized he had lost himself in thought and looked up to find two concerned faces staring back at him, “I’m – I’m fine guys. Really. I just…I need to get to Draco. Can you two watch Teddy today?” Hermione and Ron nodded in agreement before Harry left the house to apparate to the Manor.
“All this to say, that’s why I came over. I need you to watch Teddy Saturday night…I have a date.” Harry tried to hide the flush on his face but knew it was useless.
When Harry returned home that night with Teddy, his mind was in a permanent state of chaos. So much had happened and he didn’t know where to begin or how to process it all. His relationship with Draco was out – the Prophet made damn sure of that. This meant everyone in the nearby wizarding world knows about the couple.
Dean smiled, “We know Harry. I think Malfoy is just messing with you.” Harry turned to look at Draco who smiled. Luckily, Harry smiled back, and Draco could exhale.
“Mommy and daddy got divorced when I was born. But I spend a lot of time with my dad.” Harry looked over at the boy, then back at Draco who was choosing not to comment on his son’s outburst.
Once word had spread and Draco and Harry made their hand-holding debut, Harry was extremely grateful that he had told his friends ahead of time. The whispers and stares were intense, to say the least. For some reason people were strongly invested in his relationship. And it came from all sides.
It was scary how much he thought about that as a child…and even into his teenage years. But by then, his thoughts became more heated. He thought about how this man could take him into the Quidditch changing room showers and unravel him slowly.
The moment Draco opened the door, Harry knew something had changed. Draco’s expression was solemn and serious. A stark contrast to the face that had kissed him on this very stoop one week prior. “Hi Harry, come in”.
“When I got to Romania, everything fit. I felt at home – more at home than I ever felt anywhere. But I knew that I was giving up a lot (and making my mother very nervous). So yes, I am okay being here. But there are reasons I left – and I do keep thinking about those reasons.”
When Harry checked the time he nearly jumped. “Blimey! It’s already half past twelve. I should probably get going.” Harry drug himself up out of the armchair he had grown to love in the library.
Lucius continued to stare a hole into his son. “Draco. We discussed this. You are not to have any contact with…Mr. Potter.” Lucius made a quick glance towards Harry and said his name like it was a curse.
“Well, Potter. That’s my cue. I trust you can see yourself out.” Draco motioned towards the door and was about to turn towards his bedroom when he heard Harry begin to speak.
After showers and a change of clothes all around, the family gathered for their Christmas Eve dinner together. Molly had prepared a nice meal but had always insisted on saving her best for Christmas night. After dinner, members of the family dispersed to different areas of the house. George took Ron and Ginny outside to have them test some new products for the shop. Molly and Arthur were snuggled up by the fireplace listening to music. Hermione and Percy had found themselves in a corner discussing their latest book reads and swapping recommendations. Bill and Fleur had left early but promised to be back early for Christmas morning.
. And if he doesn’t, screw him! Find another!” Harry couldn’t help himself, he allowed himself to laugh for what felt like the first time that summer.
“Take your breakfast to your playroom – I’ll be there in a bit.” Draco and Harry watched as the boy grabbed his plate and moved out of the room.
He marched up to the cottage and found it still inhabited by a much older muggle gentlemen who took pity on Draco. Draco explained that he had left his family and was looking for a fresh start. The man explained that his wife had recently died, and he was trying to retire to France and live his remaining days with his grandchildren. Draco offered him all the money he had. The man smiled, and that was it.
Draco watched as the witch moved in her chair uncomfortably while never letting her face show it. “Oh, I see. Yes, well I imagine he wouldn’t be too pleased about your relationship. But honestly Draco I don’t know much about pureblood customs – .”
came to meet with him and was ready to talk seriously. Kingsley explained that he was trying to set-up a new program at the Ministry for muggle-borns attempting to acclimate to Wizard lifestyle. He said that he always felt the Ministry had done a poor job of integrating muggle-borns into Wizarding society and with all of the prejudice they had just encountered (Harry felt this was a very innocent way to say
When they made their way into the backroom Harry was in shock. Draco had converted the formal dining room into a playroom for Scorpius – the kid had…everything. There were toys as far as the eye could see and various magical objects sitting about.
Draco shot Harry a look of shock. “Of course not. I barely even know her. She’s from Beauxbaton and has been chosen by my parents. I’ve had exactly one conversation with her and that was about school…”.
Harry left the Ministry feeling…different. For the first time post- war, he felt excited. Hopeful. He had allowed himself to not think about Charlie or Draco and instead focus on himself. Doing something for himself.
“And you say you love this boy? Like, actually love him? Not just an infatuation or something because he was your first?” Sirius was more confident about what he wanted to say.
It took every ounce of him, but Draco pulled back and stood up off the bed. “I think I should be getting home. It’s getting late and people will probably be wondering where the Big Bad Death Eater drug their Savior off to.”
“I need…” Draco paused and looked around for a moment. This pause caused a shift in Hermione who sensed a problem in the air and threw her wand up to cast a silencing charm around them. Draco continued, “I need to talk to you about something rather important.”
“No, Draco…he’s right. I’ve really enjoyed seeing you, but I do intend to take Scorpius back with me. He deserves a proper family.” There it was.
When Teddy and he arrived at the Manor at precisely 12:55pm, they were not greeted by Luxley as before, but rather by an older witch who looked almost giddy.
“…I don’t know what I’m going to do without him Harry…” Harry wanted to yell and scream at this woman for making Draco this broken man. Harry stayed quiet and held Draco again.
Harry thought the conversation was over, but found his godfather still sitting on the side of his bed. “Harry, we do need to talk though.”
The last name was from Hogwarts. Harry listened as Dumbledore let out a bellowing “Cedric Diggory!”. As Cedric rose to accept his position, Harry felt his heart stop. Harry knew Cedric. Well, he didn’t exactly
Draco finished his tea and placed the cup in the sink. He rinsed it out, cleaned it, and placed it on the drying rack with the rest of his dishes – one plate, one fork, and two glasses (one for water, and one for tea). He dried his hands and began to put his boots on.
The letters, thinking about his father, and being rejected by Harry had put Draco in a terrible mood for the rest of his break. He had once been so looking forward to his time alone, but now, all he wanted was someone to talk to. Someone to confide in.
“Yeah, well, you know…she asks about all my former classmates who also happen to be saviors of the wizarding world.”
Harry wrote to Ginny at Hogwarts and found she was just as Hermione said as well. She was happy to have something to “blame” their breakup on. Although, Harry didn’t really think it was fitting to think of it that way, he let her have it.
“I’m sorry that happened to you Astoria. I’m sorry you fell in love with someone who couldn’t give you what you wanted…I really am. But you understand…you have that now. You have a husband who I’m sure loves you very much.” Harry watched as Astoria’s mouth twitched into a slight smile. “Doesn’t Draco deserve to be happy to…?”
When it came time for his own trial, he expected it would be quick. There was plenty of evidence to suggest he attempted to kill Dumbledore, he let Death Eaters into Hogwarts, and he was in the room that caught fire and nearly killed The Savior. But to his surprise, when he went before the Wizengamont, he saw the face of that very same…savior. His savior.
“Yeah…she said she’s happy now too. She said she wants to see our son though and hates that she’s missed so much of his life. She said we can figure out a visitation schedule later and she knows it will be difficult with her living in Scotland, so she basically said it was up to me – whatever I wanted…” Draco had the smile back on his face and Harry couldn’t help but mirror it on his own.
Ron joined the team in their second year and things started to fall into place. Hermione would come watch their games and sometimes would attend practices, but she always said “if you boys put half as much focus on your school work as you do Quidditch, you’d be in much better shape!”
Draco froze. He would know his father’s voice anywhere. Harry felt a chill run over Draco before he backed away from him.
Slytherins use their house name when they’re frightened? Because I can assure you no Gryffindor yells out
He made one final stop at his family’s secret vault in the cellar of Malfoy Manor. He took out the money and held it in his hands, studying it. He knew he needed to convert it to muggle currency and didn’t really know how much it would be – but whatever it was, it would have to be enough.
Draco tried to hold back, but once again felt the words coming, “Since the beginning of the summer.”
“Well, guess he’s more modest than I thought. Yeah, he went off about how I hadn’t treated you right and basically called me selfish. He said you deserved someone better. Someone who loved you. In the moment, I was furious at the allegations. I truly thought I was going to pull my wand on him. But after thinking about it later, I realized he was right. I really didn’t treat you right Harry. I knew you were developing feelings and I didn’t stop you. I think part of me just really enjoyed the affection and even though I wasn’t developing the same feelings, it was still nice to…experience whatever it was we had.”
“No, it’s alright Hermione. He’s right. Slughorn doesn’t like me. He never has actually, and I didn’t really expect that to change this year.” The table went quiet.
“Alright Draco?” The boys hesitated before sitting. They just stood in front of Draco, hands still clasped against one another.
anymore. When you return to school, you are to begin thinking about your future. You will need a wife – your mother and I will arrange that. You are to produce an heir. Go back to school. Focus on your studies. And prepare for the life you were born to lead.”
“You know what Harry. This was a mistake. I can’t deal with this right now. We weren’t ready for this.” And just like that…Draco walked away.
But since coming out, he hadn’t really dated anyone… There was a brief (yet heated) long distance relationship with Charlie, but that dissolved rather quickly. They’re still friends, but neither of them was ready for whatever that relationship was becoming.
It seems Teddy caught it too because the boy quickly turned to Scorpius, “Wait. Ron isn’t your uncle.” The boy had a moment of realization fall on his face before smiling and continuing, “Is he?!”. The boy quickly turned to look at both Draco and Harry who were silent.
The next morning, the rumor-mill was working in overdrive. By the end of breakfast, it was very much known that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were an item. The specifics surrounding the couple varied widely. Some heard the truth – they had been found shirtless and making out. Others heard they were caught in the boy’s restroom having sex. And some even went so far as to say the two were running away together… Regardless of the
Harry felt proud of Draco for doing that. He felt his heart swell and wanted to show Draco how proud he was, but when we looked at his boyfriend, all he saw was anger and fear.
Harry gave Draco a confused look, “Malfoy, how is it that your son knows who I am…?” He watched as Draco’s flush became permanent, but his face twisted into defense.
Draco awoke the next morning and recalled the dream from last night. He quickly remembered the events of the previous day and let out an audible groan. He dressed himself for the day and made his way into his kitchen to prepare his breakfast.
“I know you Harry. I’ve known you for 6 years and just because we don’t hang out like we used to, doesn’t mean I don’t care about you. And… I know that a lot of us not hanging out has to do with me and how I handled our…situation, but…”
Harry tried to concentrate on his first practice of the year, but his mind kept alternating between Draco’s sudden dismissiveness and Oliver’s sudden…presence. Harry was exhausted after only going at it for an hour and decided to call it for the day. The rest of his team looked just as relieved as him – the first day of classes was difficult for everyone it seemed.
Harry had strange dreams that night that entailed Draco dressed in all orange with orange body paint on. Harry grew confused when Dream Draco stopped what he was doing and started tapping his foot.
“Yeah, she is. Honestly, she was fine with it the minute I told her. After the war, she really wanted to abandon all of the pure-blood nonsense we had been spouting and re-focus on just
He was so conflicted. He knew he liked Oliver. Hell, he had liked Oliver, in some way shape or form, since he was 11.
Lily had a feeling this is where the conversation was going. She took a deep breath and prepared herself. She wanted to make sure she did this right. “Well, sweetie, Sirius and Remus love each other very much. Just like your father and I do. And when two people love each other, they kiss each other. Sometimes a man loves a woman (like me and your father), sometimes a man loves a man (like your Sirius and Remus) and sometimes a woman loves a woman. Does that make sense?”
Harry broke the kiss and looked back at Draco and smiled before turning his attention to the children in the kitchen.
him. And while we don’t know how, we do know that you are strong Harry. I’ve spent my whole life trying to protect you. I talked a lot about Death Eaters because I wanted to make sure you understood that men like Lucius Malfoy were evil…I did this so you could stay away from these people. That was me trying to shield you from the evils in the world. But that was also me not remembering how strong you are. I’m not going to pretend like I’m happy about this, because I’m not. But I’m going to trust my son and defer to his judgement. If you say Draco is not his father, then I believe you.”
As soon as they returned to the Gryffindor common room later that day, Hermione and Ron decided to charge.
sound like a dick. He was really working on that, but years of harassing his peers had caused a semi-permanent dick-ish tone to come out of his mouth whenever he spoke.
Upon arriving, Harry just simply was not prepared for the “fans” he would have upon entering the school. It seemed like people couldn’t get enough of The-Boy-Who-Lived. He found people staring at him during classes and at meals. Sometimes people would approach him and ask for an autograph. He never really knew how to respond to these situations, so he just politely smiled and said, “no thank you”.
“Well…you said it.” Harry hated the way he was sounding. Dean moved to stand up from the couch, but Harry reached out. “Dean, I’m sorry. I’m just…I’m not okay. Thank you…for trying”. Dean smiled and nodded his head before heading back towards his own table to study.
Draco just sat there and kept listening, intently. He never made comments other than the occasional grunt of acknowledgement or “right, uh-huh”. When Harry got to the part about Dean and the kiss, Draco shifted. He looked uncomfortable. When Harry told him what Dean did after, Draco looked puzzled. “Wait. He…turned you down. For the Weasley girl?”
“Yeah, so, change out of your sleep robes…I guess. And come meet us.” Harry motioned towards his outfit as he spoke.
Harry couldn’t help but comment on the difference between this conversation and their conversation when he came out. “I thought you two would be better about this…more…sympathetic”.
Harry found himself stretched thin trying to balance his schoolwork and his role as Quidditch captain. The Dean situation was starting to move on, but Harry still felt a small pit of jealousy when Dean would walk Ginny to Quidditch. Often, Dean would say a quick “hello Harry”, before walking away without a reply from Harry.
“You have to stop saying that! I’m not a ‘you’. I’m a person, Charlie! I’m a person who deserves someone who wants them back. And if that’s Draco, then Draco it is.” Harry knew that wasn’t the best way to say that, but he was taken aback by this conversation with Charlie. He really didn’t want to be here.
“Okay.” Because why not? He knew Ron Weasley wouldn’t hex him in the presence of his girlfriend and Harry would…well, Draco didn’t really know how Harry would handle it, but he imagined it would be safe, nonetheless.
The summer between fifth and sixth year was hard. Harry wanted to be left alone as much as possible, which was very rare for him. He always wanted to be around his parents. Even as he had gotten older and all of his friends kept talking about how “lame” their parents were, Harry never felt that. His parents were perfect. And that’s exactly why he couldn’t be around him. They’d want to
Draco looked up in surprise and then concern, “Harry… What are you doing here? Is everything alright?”
When Draco noticed Harry enter, he tried to fix himself. He sat up and began to slick his hair back. “What is it with you and restrooms, Potter?”
“Potter…can I help you?” Draco kept his eyes glued to the top of the man’s head – refusing to allow himself to look further.
Yet another thing that had changed – Ron. A week after the final battle, Kingsley Shacklebolt (the new Minister of Magic) offered auror positions to Harry, Hermione, and Ron. Only Ron accepted. Hermione insisted that she would finish her final year of school and McGonagall agreed to let her take her NEWTs courses via owl. Harry didn’t know what to do and so decided to do nothing. Ron, on the other hand, quickly took Kingsley up on the job and soon started training. Every day of training was another day of Ron gaining confidence. The auror offer combined with the events of the battle left Ron more sure of himself. This was something that was
Draco laid back on his bed and closed his eyes. So many thoughts flooded into his brain at the same time.
It soon became time to return to the living room for gifts. Everyone took turns opening and before they knew it, the room was covered in bright paper. Lily and James brought out their wands and began the process of cleaning up the room when Harry noticed Oliver bring out a small box. “I have just one more for you Harry.” Harry looked down at the box and back up at Oliver. He also noticed that his parents and godfathers shared a look.
“Scorpius! Isn’t that a funny name? His dad’s name is Draco, which is also funny…” Teddy was bursting at the seams while talking. The minute Draco’s name was mentioned, all eyes turned to Harry – who went red.
“I’m not trying to push you into anything, but I enjoyed last night…and this morning. I’ve been enjoying whatever this is since it started, and I want to continue it. So, if this is some sort of quick thing for you then it’s best to end it now.” Harry couldn’t help but notice how much the mood and tone had changed since the bed this morning, but also knew Draco was right. Teddy didn’t have either parent and also deserved stability.
“Well, I wouldn’t use those terms, but yes. More or less. But you don’t have to. You can continue to sit alone and talk to…no one.” Her tone sounded dismissive, but he knew her. She was using a tactic to get him to go.
she was going to have with me – until I fucked it all up. It would be hypocritical of me to be mad at her for wanting to live the life she wanted. I just wish she was here so Scorpius would have a mother…” Harry heard Draco choke up on the last words before he turned to look at the floor.
Harry looked at him confused. Draco rolled his eyes and continued. “Sex dreams Potter. About blokes.” Wow, how did this guy defeat a dark lord?
Hermione and Ron shot him back a smirk, “Of course mate. I thought that was obvious. It’s kind of the same with you. I mean I didn’t know
On the Monday of his third week into term, a mound of brown hair pulled out a chair at his table at the back of the library and sat down. She opened up her books and began to study.
nice and all, but if it’s all a guy has…I’ll pass.” Oliver winked at Harry and he felt his face flush.
“I see…it’s the same with us. I needed help when Astoria left. So, I moved back here with my mother and began the remodel.” Draco looked as if he didn’t mean to include the part about Astoria, so Harry felt it best to leave it alone.
It was in that moment that an idea crossed Draco’s mind. Possibly a foolish idea…but an idea nonetheless. He would circle back to it later.
Draco finally found words in his head and he couldn’t just sit here and listen to Harry ramble any longer. “Potter…where is all this going? What are you trying to say…?”
And without fail, some heavy breathing and several minutes later, Harry pulled off to sit at the end of the bed. Draco moved up behind him.
Hermione and Ron gave Harry a confused look. “Then if you’re not with Oliver, mate, what’s going on?”
reached for Draco’s hand when they walked down the hall. He always showed up to the astronomy tower first and he always made Draco feel like the most important person in the world.
He motioned towards his small dining table and Harry began to unpack the bag. There must have been a charm placed on it because the man just kept pulling out more and more food. Once it was all laid out on the table, there was no place for plates or utensils. Harry looked at Draco as though he was expecting him to do something about it and when he found no response, he flicked his wand and the table doubled in size and plates and utensils began to be laid out in front of them.
“Harry…do you like Dean?” Harry looked up in fright. Hermione’s suspicions were confirmed right then.
“Granted, most days it was pretty negative. Especially in the beginning…those first few years at Hogwarts were nothing but thinking about how terrible you were.” Draco’s heart dropped but who was he kidding – he was terrible.
Stuck in his thoughts – Harry heard a tapping at the window. Draco’s bird sat there, tapping its foot in its usual irritation before Harry went to grab the letter.
Astoria is back because she doesn’t want Scorpius to live with Draco. She’s been fine with it for the past 4 years when she thought Draco wasn’t
After the night of October 31, 1981, Lily was always protective of her son. When Sirius and Remus first started taking Harry to their house for sleepovers, they had to promise to be careful with him and to not let anything happen to him. They promised Lily that when Harry was with them, no harm would ever come to him.
“You’re…you’re not? But I thought, I thought he came to your house for Christmas. And rumor has it that you were kissing him on the Quidditch pitch last month.” Harry turned to look at his friend.
Harry read every letter Draco sent him, then through it in the fire. After leaving Draco that day, Harry had felt horrible. He allowed thoughts of self-doubt to creep into his brain. Logical, rational Harry would try to come out and say “Harry, he was just looking out for you. He didn’t say he didn’t want you – he said you needed time. And he’s right, you probably do. You were really hung-up on Charlie; you need more time to be sure of things before you start something with Draco.”
The night continued in the same way. Various people would go to the bar, order shots for the group, the group would take them, and the speech would slur more and more. Harry noticed the more he drank, the more he looked at Charlie. The more he looked at Charlie, the more his chest tightened. Harry realized that as his chest tightened, it wasn’t because he was sad. It wasn’t because he lost his “first love” and it wasn’t because he was hurt. It was because he was angry. He was angry that he allowed himself to get this way. He was angry that Charlie was leaving. He was angry that no one else was as upset as he was.
In the beginning of their breakup, Harry went to the astronomy tower every single night. Part of him knew Draco wouldn’t be there, but just being in their space made Harry somehow feel whole. But in the past month, he forced himself to stop. He tapered off. Three times a week, once a week, once every other week….and now, never.
feeling some of the worst pain I’ve ever felt. I’ve forced myself to think terrible things about myself, about you. I have most certainly not ‘moved on’. I wish you would have just…talked to me. We could have figured something out, Draco.”
After about a month of living in the cottage, Draco finally had to go into town. He needed to figure out his food situation (having gone through what the old man left behind). It was in town that he found out he lived in Lancashire and that the reason so many sheep lived on his land was because he was technically supposed to be a sheep farmer.
Draco and Harry hadn’t spoken much since the night he brought him dinner. Draco wasn’t sure who was avoiding who at this point but did know he wasn’t going out of his way to interact with Potter either. Their last conversation had hit too close to home for Draco. So, Draco decided to go back to keeping his head down.
In his pathetic excuse for a living room, he found a blissfully asleep Harry Potter. The man had apparently stripped down to his underwear to sleep and haphazardly slept under only half of the blanket he had transformed for himself. Draco hated himself for looking, but honestly couldn’t help it.
about Oliver being in his home, with his family, for Christmas. Harry changed his clothes three times that day before he finally heard a knock at the door.
Harry smiled, “No, I know. I meant that I surprised myself. I didn’t know I was going to do it until I did it. I’m like that sometimes…I can be a bit…impulsive, I guess.” Harry looked down at his lap.
“What? Did you hear how I was a poof? Cause that’s what I’ve been hearing too. I’ve been hearing that I like to take it up the arse and that I’ve been dumped!” Draco let out a laugh that made Harry uncomfortable. “I suppose you’re hear to rub it in, huh? Get back at me for making all those comments about your godfathers? Hex me for calling you a ‘poof’ all those years ago? Well, have at it. Here I am.” Draco held his arms open for Harry.
It had been one very long week after Harry’s party. One week since Charlie and Draco had argued. One week since Charlie officially ended things with Harry and one week since Harry (stupidly) tried to kiss Draco Malfoy.
“He said you saved the world…that you were super powerful. He said you…” the boy wouldn’t meet Harry’s eyes and he was getting worried, “…died.” There it was.
“That’s…that’s exactly what I wanted…” Scorpius seemed surprised by the wizard’s response. The wizard simply smiled and looked at Teddy.
Harry could have sworn there was a suspicious tone in that question but decided to ignore it. These were his godfathers. They loved him. He loved them. If he couldn’t talk to them, then who would he talk to?
“Just after the way he spoke about you at your birthday.” Harry stood confused. “He never told you how he went off on me and I nearly hexed him into next century?” Harry, still confused, shook his head and Charlie laughed.
Narcissa approached her son and looked him the eyes. Harry could tell Draco was trying not to cry. She took her son’s face in her hands and looked as though she was studying it for a long time. When she finally spoke to her son, it was barely above a whisper. “Does he make you happy?” The woman refused to lose eye contact with her son.
“Harry. I…I like you too. And I’m proud of you for facing your sexuality. Trust me, it isn’t always easy to do.” Draco smiled and watched Harry return it. “But…this is all pretty new to you. Are you…are you sure?”
“Uh-huh, and now? Is he ‘up to something’ that you need to ‘figure out’?” Hermione was loving this all a little too much.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat with the rest of Gryffindor and anxiously waited to see whose name would be pulled for Hogwarts.
“Trust me Potter. On that one, you have nothing to be sorry for. The man deserved what he got. And without him – I am much better off. My father had some very fucked up views on things.”
Draco raised up and looked down at Harry, “Yeah – I’m sure. Are you…are you sure? Cause if you’re not, we can stop.” Harry felt Draco raise up and pressure left his body. He didn’t like it.
Harry was quickly starting to see that keeping all of these thoughts and feelings to himself was not going to be helpful. So, he decided to talk with Ron and Hermione.
After about six months of this, Draco knew they would need more. He started talking to people in town about his situation, saying ‘he had to return home to take care of family’, which honestly wasn’t a lie because his mother was doing much better now and was set to be released from St. Mungo’s soon.
“Yes, he was, but…” Draco was hesitating, “it was all true. Every single piece of it.” He looked at Harry and knew he was likely thinking about Blaise’s last statement. “Blaise had every right to be upset with me. I…I have been talking about you quite a bit.” Draco brought his eyes back down.
“Oh yes! He tried to get out of it at first, claiming he couldn’t return and then immediately ask for time off, but I insisted! He’s missed too many family events already and you’re just as much of a brother to him as Ron is!”
Harry decided to stay silent. This only prompted his parents to worry more…and it wasn’t long before they called in reinforcements. When Harry saw his Sirius and Remus walk through the door later that night, he rolled his eyes. Of course his parents brough them over… Oh, and of course his parents are going out for a ‘date-night’…how convenient…
“Oliver…” Harry really didn’t know what to say. He felt foolish, standing almost naked against this wall. He also felt very embarrassed, because Oliver was right….
By this point, the Prophet was already running scathing editorials on the Malfoy family. Speculation surrounding their freedom and why Lucius wasn’t killed on site mounted and it was all becoming too much.
Harry stared at the man in front of him. He had no idea that Charlie was also gay. This was going to make things much worse…
The rest of his family began to make their ways towards him, making their introductions and shaking hands. If Oliver was intimidated by the three men, he didn’t show it. If anything, Harry thought Oliver looked rather…comfortable.
have anything to do with Draco Malfoy and the reason you scarfed down your dinner like it was the last meal you’d ever get?” Harry was shocked by the actually
Draco turned around to give Harry his book with a sly grin. “Potter, why is it when I look at you, I always find your mouth open? You didn’t need to throw your book on the floor to get a good look at my arse. You could have just asked.” Draco winked and Harry felt his entire stomach drop.
The two kissed for a rather long time until they heard a cough from behind them and a “Christmas dinner is almost ready! Please everyone meet in the dining room! Oh, Draco dear, how great of you to join us…Harry, will Draco be staying for dinner?”
The other man apparently didn’t feel the same way. Draco watched as Harry’s eyes looked him over rather slowly before his mouth began to speak, “Um, I was instructed to invite you to breakfast.” He said as he let out a yawn.
But that’s all this was. A childhood fantasy. And after all the fantasizing, he was still left with the same thought as before…he loved Draco Malfoy.
Two hours before they were set to leave, Harry heard someone coming into the room. Harry figured it was Ron wanting to ask for the millionth time, “Do you think Hermione would be cool with me getting drunk tonight? But like, are you
“Yeah, well, I didn’t want to label you if you hadn’t done so yourself. It’s important to let people speak their own truth.”
Harry had been pretty proud of himself. It had been 2 weeks after their talk, and he wasn’t feeling anything towards the man except lust. He allowed himself to give everything (well, not everything…yet) to this man and would reciprocate every time and was even getting to the point of being really good at initiating. He was enjoying the process of learning about himself and his body. What did he like? What didn’t he like? How far was he comfortable with going? All of these things were things Charlie was there to show him. And Charlie knew quite a bit. He knew how to explain things to Harry before they happened in a way that made Harry more comfortable and also extremely turned on. He was actually just…really good in general. Granted, Harry didn’t have anything to compare it to, but he was enjoying himself.
“Harry, we have to talk about this.” Charlie said with hesitation and trying to compose himself. He hated to stop what was happening but knew this was going to need to be discussed.
“There’s a problem there Astoria. I’m his family. He doesn’t know you. And he certainly doesn’t know this new husband of yours. He belongs with me, and that’s where he will stay.” Harry loved hearing this come from Draco.
“Actually, we don’t. What we need to do is get all of this back in the barn and head inside.” Draco started to pack up his materials and watched as Harry still stood there, brush in hand.
Harry’s mouth went dry. He wasn’t prepared for this conversation, but at the same time – he needed to have it. Before he knew it, he was crying on Hermione’s shoulder while she comforted him “Harry, it’s okay! It’s really
“No. I’ve seen you sitting here for the past couple of weeks. It’s smart. Out of the way of people staring and silent. Thought I would join you.” There was no request in her voice.
“Harry…” Draco wasn’t a fool though. As much as he had always wanted and thought about this, that meant he also thought about consequences. “What exactly do you want…?”
“I think it’s brilliant. It sounds like something you would do Potter. I think you’d be really good at it.” Draco gave Harry a sincere look. Harry waited for a joke or sarcastic comment, but it didn’t come. Just a smile and a look.
Draco thought he had stepped too far when the room turned silent except for Ron who turned red and said, “Oi! Please don’t talk about that when you’re dating my best mate! I don’t need to know what he knows about Weasley…parts OR Malfoy…parts, thank you!” On that the whole room erupted into laughter just as Harry descended the last stair and entered the living room.
“Draco, I understand wanting to get away. Trust me…I really do. But you’re wrong. I talked to everyone I possibly could. Your mother, Blaise, Greg, Pansy, Theo…everyone I could find who might know where you were. They all were concerned. They had all been writing to you but said their owls just kept coming back. Your mother is doing better and just kept asking for updates every time I went to visit her. There are people that care about you Draco…”
Harry noticed a change in Draco once they returned. Harry could swear he felt that the boy was trying to talk to him. He would catch him in the hallway, walking towards one of Harry’s classes, but when Harry went to approach – the man would walk away. There were times when they would pass each other in the hall and Harry thought he saw Draco’s mouth open to say something, but when he looked closely, the mouth was closed, and the man was soon gone.
“Salazar Slytherin!” Harry Potter stood over him by the fire – also shirtless and in his pajama bottoms.
After a week of this, Harry was enjoying the smirks he and Charlie would share across the living room after dinners. He liked this “secret” the two of them shared and anytime he found himself staring at Charlie he remembered he could actually have him. It was an exciting feeling. But he made sure to keep himself together. This was his mate’s older brother. Granted, the two of them hadn’t spent much time together while Harry was growing up, but still. Harry loved being part of the Weasley family and had no intentions of messing that up.
having Harry and Hermione in the house and Ginny announced she had been recruited for the Holyhead Harpies and would be staying at the Burrow after graduation until the Harpies’ season started in September.
Draco wasn’t allowed at her trial but had heard that she had been let off with no consequences. He didn’t know how, and he frankly didn’t care, she was free; that’s all that mattered.
He also learned of many relationship revelations that had occurred since the war. Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley had re-kindled their romance (not that Draco cared or anything). Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley were now together (which made Draco confused because he assumed they always had been). Luna Lovegood was now dating Neville Longbottom (Draco didn’t care for Neville very much but had grown fond of Luna during her time at the Manor and was glad she was happy). Padma Patil was now dating Terry Boot (Draco didn’t even know if he could pick out who Terry Boot was so he couldn’t care less). The most interesting pairing to Draco was actually Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan. It seems the two had been together ever since Dean and Ginny broke up and had made it public over the summer.
“Ah- I see. Well, very pleased to meet you Mrs. Greengrass. Your grandson is wonderful, he’s all my godson talks about.” This made the woman even more giddy.
He continued to eat with them throughout the weekend. By lunch on Sunday it had become expected. No one batted an eye when he sat down, and they were starting to warm to the idea of him being there.
But by that point, he knew it wouldn’t happen. And he told Ginny as such. She took it well and eventually left to finish her studies at Hogwarts before leaving permanently to play quidditch professionally. She now held a long-distance relationship with Dean Thomas, which Harry feels is for the best.
When Cedric left the maze, cup in hand, the entire school cheered. Harry watched as Cedric’s father ran down from the stands and met his son. Harry’s heart swelled. He told himself it was pride from seeing their champion win and witnessing a tender moment between father and son, but something told him he was fooling himself.
That night, Harry couldn’t sleep. He kept tossing and turning and thinking about Draco. Finally, he decided he couldn’t take it anymore and decided to go for a walk around the school. He knew it was past curfew, but he also found these late-night walks to be strangely exhilarating and calming.
“He does…He doesn’t tell him any bad things. He tells him the truth, or at least the truth that a six-year-old should hear. He shows him pictures of you.” Astoria smiled and Harry continued. “Astoria…Draco would never take him from you if the roles were reversed. He loved you…I know he still does. He wants you to find happiness just like he has. He won’t keep you from him…but you can’t have him completely. You can’t take him away.” Harry wanted to make his point as clear as possible and once again it looked like he had Astoria’s attention.
“Hey Oliver! What can I do for you?” Images appeared in Harry’s head of what he could do for Oliver and Harry forced himself to re-focus.
“No I’m not! I already told you both I was fine with it! Happy for you even! Smitten!” Harry’s voice had gotten higher and Draco felt this was strange. Why was Harry trying so hard to convince everyone he was okay with the relationship when it obviously made him uncomfortable? Was Savior Potter secretly homophobic?
Draco figured the letter was standard for all returning eighth year students – talks of the ‘impact of the war on your education’, ‘education is important’, and this is ‘optional’. Draco couldn’t help but scoff at the word – ‘optional’ for all but him.
His immediate concern was Draco. They had discussed not going public for the past several months and now here it was – out in the open.
They spent the afternoon with each other in the Malfoy study. They alternated between kissing, laughing, talking, and reading. When evening was approaching, Draco brought in a house elf and gave instructions for dinner.
“I…wasn’t running away from you or anything.” Harry said almost as if he could read Draco’s thoughts. “Well, I guess I kind of was…the kiss…it just…took me by surprise.”
“Look. It’s fine. It was what it was – an impulse kiss apparently. Like I told you after it happened, it doesn’t have to mean anything, Harry.” Draco quickly acknowledged the use of Harry’s first name and hated himself.
“He’s my goat, Potter. He’s kind of…attached to me. And it seems like it’s going to rain soon, so he’s probably just scared and wants to come inside.” Draco stood to let the goat in.
But if you ever asked Harry what his absolute favorite part of his childhood was, he would say staying over at his godfathers’ house. Harry’s godparents were actually his god
The two would have stayed like this and Harry would have been content, but as soon as it started, it was over. “Daddy!” a scream erupted from upstairs and both men took off running towards the room.
I started messing around with a couple of guys in Ravenclaw, if you can believe that. I threatened them that if they ever told anyone I would cast a permanent curse on them that would result in boils popping up all over their face.” Harry and Draco both smiled.
Harry smiled and nodded. He stood up and made his way towards the door. Before he left, he turned around one last time, “Goodnight, Charlie”. Charlie looked up at him and smiled, “Goodnight, Harry”.
“Hi.” Was all Draco would allow himself to let out. He knew there was so much more to say to the man, probably a ‘sorry’ for starters, but it wasn’t coming.
“You go…” Harry said. “No, you.” Draco smiled. He really didn’t have anything important to say so felt it best to let Harry go.
Everyone took it rather well. None of the Weasleys cared (seeing as how Charlie was gay, it would be hypocritical if they did). And Hermione went in with full support…too much support at times. So, when Teddy was old enough to speak, she began teaching him the proper language to use for Harry and his ‘Uncle Charlie’.
Harry was surprised by the reaction, “Oliver… you made me happy too. And if Draco didn’t exist…” Oliver cut Harry off before he could continue.
“When he confronted me about them, I didn’t want to lie…I thought if I just told the truth and told him that we loved each other…maybe he would care that his ONLY SON was happy. But he didn’t care. Actually, he was furious. He took my owl and locked her away. I snuck out of the house and used an owl from an owlery nearby to send you the letter for your birthday.” Draco paused. So much was starting to make sense to Harry. This is why he didn’t hear from him…
“And raise a glass to losing your virginity!”. The room immediately silenced. “Let’s have a toast to falling stupidly in love with someone who will never love you back. This is to the man who was nothing but honest with me and I went and mucked it up with my
But Draco was strong – he never allowed himself to act on these dreams. He would simply wake up, acknowledge the dream in his head, shake it off, take a cold shower, and go back to bed. By breakfast, the dream was lost somewhere in his bed sheets and would never see the light of day.
“He said I could possibly be…bisexual. Or something.” On that Harry looked up at Draco who was definitely already staring at him.
Against his better judgement, Draco lamented. He offered Harry some of his clothes and the two made their way outside.
“Ron was…less enthusiastic. It was strange really. He actually didn’t say much of anything. He just kind of sat there and nodded his head. When I told him I was bisexual, he hugged me…He said he was happy for me. But when I told him about you…that’s when he shifted.”
“You used Occlumency to compartmentalise the trauma, keep it from affecting you too much, and keep going, correct? If we’re wrong, you’ll need to let us know, this is just the educated guess we’ve been working under since you… well.”
A hissing voice rises from the locket. “He doesn't think you're as good as them, Draco. All this time you've been helping him, and he's been pining for his
He wonders if his attacker got what he wanted. After all, Harry hasn't left Draco, has instead stayed by Draco's side this entire time. The papers have only reported on Harry's heartache, not a "newfound life free of Death Eaters" or whatever Draco's attacker was hoping for.
now-confirmed Death Eaters were arrested… Though You-Know-Who got away… So did Bellatrix Lestrange.”
“As long as he doesn’t ingest it or get it on his mouth area, he’ll be fine. We also checked for any other allergies, but it’s just grapefruit, so that’s lucky. It could have been worse if it were a common potion ingredient.”
He's quite certain he would be put out if everyone else knew the truth before him. Well, unless he was in a coma or something, that
Draco considers the question. He doesn't want them to be broken up, not anymore, not now that he knows that hasn't actually been Harry's side-piece and that it was all a misunderstanding.

Draco is silent for a long while, just staring back towards the large crystal and it’s almost sickly green glow.
being taught by the Boy Wonder himself to learn how to cast that charm.” Draco tilts his chin up with a small sniff. “Some of us are very skilled with magic and are raised by people who are very skilled with magic.”
As she enters the tavern, hurrying towards the kitchen, something bright catches her eye, and she comes to a stop.
At least he hasn’t been doing it in public, and people haven’t known about any but his first attempt. If he’d told everyone, he’d be both frustrated

will be able to cherish it, and place Draco’s among all the other Malfoy weddings across the centuries—despite… Despite.
They huddle together, and Harry can feel his pulse pound his throat again. The draw box regarding their use of the Peruvian instant Darkness powder, it's the fact that they can't see the herders either. Which means that they can't pick them off one by one.
Somewhere around the fifth month, Draco starts helping the weavers. For all that he's claimed to have no skills, every single tapestry, every single piece of cloth... Everything he weaves comes out magnificent, more amazing than anything Adriana has ever seen before.
He wonders what food used to taste like. He knows, in his clearer moments when everything is less fuzzy around the edges, that he used to like certain tastes. He wonders what they were... He wonders what they tasted like.
As they stand there chest to chest, Draco rubs his nose against Harry's, a silly little sign of affection he enjoys.
“You're such a muggle-born, even though you're not actually a muggle-born,” Draco sniffs, and lifts his nose in the air in that snobbish way he does.
Still, he listened in on what she had to say, and if it's true, it's going to mean some very bad things for the rebellion. Though, there's also the possibility that they will be able to turn it around.
For the two friends he never thought he’d have, who he hated for so long for taking what he saw as his place.
“They're both fine; Narcissa and Lucius have been helping Draco with Teddy now that Draco has become more busy healing people.”
He doesn’t know how long it’s been, he hasn’t seen his own reflection either… He doesn’t know if perhaps he fell into a coma and
Sometimes he wonders if, perhaps, he’s already dead. If this is some odd sort of afterlife. One he’s doomed to stay in forever until he reaches a point where his mind devolves into madness. Or perhaps the void of death finally claims him.
As Umbridge continues to sputter, Malfoy sends a smirk that’s clearly aimed Harry’s way before he turns back to his breakfast. Harry keeps on staring. Keeps remembering the feeling of Malfoy’s body pressed up against his, and the way he smelled of lavender.
Harry is in the foyer with Blaise, and it's first now that Draco gets any sort of good look at him. He adamantly refused to before after all.
“No chance of that, you git,” Harry says and shakes his head, before he presses another soft kiss to Draco’s lips.
He’s so focused on Malfoy he doesn’t even hear the footsteps until the door to whatever room they’re in is ripped open.
He knows that he's missing something. That a great deal of who he is has been washed away in the grey of the world... He remembers that there used to be colours, but he still can't see them.
Harry hasn’t cancelled Saturday, and he’d hardly just not show up. That… That would be very out of character of him. Every time either one of them has needed to cancel so far, they've sent an owl or Floo called beforehand. So clearly he's got nothing to worry about and this is all just a silly misunderstanding that Draco's under because he's being a snoop and listening in on someone else's conversation.
“A little spy, huh?” Black snorts. “Sounds a bit like old Luscious Lucius, that. Always looking to get ahead.”
Harry has no doubt they might be forced to Apparate to safety more than a few times in the process, so having Apparition points to return to will be critical. Otherwise they risk
. People are coming up to him to apologise for not believing him and being mean and gossiping… And Harry can’t pay attention because he’s too busy thinking about Draco Sodding Malfoy.
“Look, you've all been complaining so much I just started tuning you out. It reminded me of when Pansy would get into a snit at school.” He doesn't even have the decency to look up at Harry.
“Well,” Draco says. “If we think that Helga Hufflepuff's cup might be one, then I'm going to say that we should also count Rowena Ravenclaw's missing diadem. It may be missing, but who’s more likely to find it than someone as obsessed as Thomas? Do you think the Sword of Gryffindor…?”
Suddenly, Harry finds himself with Draco in his arms, clinging around his neck and whispering “yes, yes, yes” over and over.
He considers sending Aquilla to them with letters, but even that he doesn't dare. He's written the letters, but they remain on his desk. Unsent for the foreseeable future.
"How, my Lord? Is there anything I can do?" Lucius glances nervously at Nagini where she lies coiled at the Dark Lord's feet. He wonders if her calm appearance is a front and she's instead ready to strike at any second. He wouldn't be surprised if that were the case.
“We do, yes. We have one of the largest and oldest private collections in the world. Rivalling even that of Hogwarts, though ours has had less…
before. It feels entirely out of character. Of course, Harry thinks, if you're thinking your own actions and reactions are out of character, maybe that's a sign that you're losing your mind?
He rubs at the tears on his cheeks, wishes the flow would stem so he could appear stronger than he is. So he could at least look a bit less pathetic than he is.
How lucky the God of the Stars is to have such a lover, she thinks with a sigh, before she feels silly and puts the sketches away with a giggle.
Draco finally turns his head and just briefly catches sight of a man who would be handsome if not for the horrific grimace on his face. The man disapparates with a crack, leaving Draco standing still in the middle of the street, still bleeding, clothes and hair ruined, and with the sinking feeling that whatever potion the man threw at him, it only needed that first touch to work, and he vanished it to keep Draco from analysing it to find an antidote.
improve but… Then you stagnated again.” Mother looks sad. “That’s when the healers suggested that maybe we should reunite you with your wand.”
He changes into his pyjamas swiftly and as he slides in between the sheets he sighs and places the mirror gently beneath his pillow. If Father tries to contact him, he’ll know instantly.
Slitting someone’s throat never gets easier, but it’s a necessity. Now they just have to figure out where to dispose of the body. They can be sure that no other Herder won't come along, and they don't want to be found out before they can do what they need to do.
Draco frowns. That… that must have been the people with the magic that hurt. He vaguely remembers them coming, casting spell after spell and then they all seemed to give up and stopped coming.
Draco has no illusions regarding the fact that his potions business would likely be more profitable and have more clients if he didn’t use his own name and pretended to be someone else. Draco is not, however, willing to make that change and he can get away with not doing it because he doesn’t need to. He’s privileged enough to not need to rely on his business to survive, it’s more of a hobby for him than anything else.
outdoors—Harry’s not going to get him mountain climbing any time soon—but the kind of outdoors that a well cultivated garden or lovingly cared for field constitutes.
They make it up to the actual Manor without any sort of incident, but Harry still feels unsure. Ever since Ron and Hermione left them, he just can't seem to get control over his nerves. Their leaving must have shaken him worse than he ever could have imagined, but they were his only friends for so long that he just sort of thought they'd always be together. He never expected them to leave him behind.
For the briefest of moments, Harry lets go of Draco’s hand, before he catches him around the waist instead.
really throughout this entire journey. But this particular thing? He was willing to draw blood on it.
"I... Beg your pardon if this is rude, but I was wondering if there is, perhaps, any place nearby that needs a worker? And somewhere cheap to lodge? I'm afraid I do not have much in the way of money." He speaks in a low voice, and it's smooth and almost seems... There is no echo to it, but Adriana almost feels like there should be. As if his voice should be more than it is...
He huffs slightly. “I can only hope and pray to Circe that my parents chose their secret keeper better than yours did. There are enough orphans in this room.” He looks away then, because he
He wasn't expecting the feeling of glass breaking against his head, liquid sliding down his face—more than just blood—to a shout of "That's for my sister, you fucking Death Eater whore!"
The words still make Draco slightly nauseous. He’s been putting off Saturday brunches with his parents for Potter, claiming work engagements, he's moved them to Sunday on occasion but... He's spent some Sundays with Potter too, having wanted to wake up with him too.
He can’t allow himself to dwell too much on it. He can’t break down in front of his parents, they’ll want to know and he’s not… He’s too embarrassed, too
The sides of the man's mouth twitches, almost as if he were about to smile. "I would be much obliged."
about this whole thing. He is going to mock Draco’s dramatic heartbreak vacation until the end of time, and Draco has no one to blame but himself.
, in fact, Draco Malfoy who’s using his entire body to push Harry against the wall. Harry has never seen Malfoy’s face this close before—holy shit he can even see individual lashes around Malfoy’s pale grey eyes—and his hand
Ron shakes his head. "Nah, but we managed to trace it to an apothecary where it had been sold just around the time of the attack. Except, uh, it had been reported as stolen, which is why we checked it out first."
He can’t let himself cry, not in front of them, no matter how much he wants to. Not yet, not until he’s far weaker than he is now. Perhaps he will allow himself some tears when they reach May, when any hope of rescue has been properly vanquished from his heart.
Harry used to think he wanted and needed someone like Ginny, but they’d realised fairly quickly after the war that they made better friends and siblings than they did a romantic couple. He doesn’t regret the relationship they had, though, because Harry loves Ginny and they both learned a lot about themselves through it—like the fact that Ginny doesn’t want children, but Harry absolutely does. If they’d stayed together, one of them would have needed to compromise. Harry sometimes wonders how well that would have worked out for them.
Draco shakes his head. “No, but we should still probably be careful just in case. Let's not take any chances. If we don't, we might be able to actually sleep inside after we get the poison and destroy the locket.”
It doesn’t take him long to start sobbing in earnest, his whole frame shaking with the force of his grief and sadness, the loud sound of his crying almost echoing in the empty room. He pays it no mind,
Sometimes he's tired, and he lies down in the grass next to the pond. He wonders if he did that before, before the world turned grey.
They snuck around the building, they placed some bits and bobs around outside on nearby buildings. And then Harry turned them into bombs that he'll set up when the time is right. They've made sure that the bombs are far enough from the building that they won't affect the walls. They don't want to risk blowing up a hole in a wall and allow the Inferi to swarm inside.
“I ran into Parkinson, and she mentioned that she hasn't seen you around for months. That none of your friends have. I got worried.”
“I know it doesn’t seem like it, and a lot of the members of my family have been… Well. Stringent. But overall? In the context of the rest of the Sacred Twenty-Eight? The Malfoy Family has always been one of the
Draco’s facial expression cannot be described as anything short of awed as he opens the box and looks inside. He clasps a hand to his mouth.
It turns out to be Antonin Dolohov behind the mask, and Harry isn’t surprised. He would be just the kind of person to do this kind of thing.
Perhaps it was all just payback for how shitty Draco was when they were children. Perhaps the way he and Harry hashed it out was all just a lie, and Potter's been thinking he's the dumbest shit in the world for ever imagining that he or any of his friends would ever forgive Draco for his past. Perhaps this has all just been a long complicated lark at Draco's expense.
He takes a small glance at Potter and finds that his face is twisted in a grimace, but he doesn’t exactly look…
"For me, please, promise you'll try..." It's so selfish of him, Draco thinks, to make Harry promise, but he doesn't think he'll be able to rest easy if he doesn't. And if Draco became a ghost... He's quite sure that would be even worse for everyone involved.
“Is it still in your bag, Harry?” Ron’s face is still red with anger, but it's set in an expression of grim determination now.
“Well, we need to be sensitive about this. Malfoy must have been terribly upset when… Well, things seemed to be like they seemed to be.”
They have no idea what will happen now, they have no idea how the upcoming fight will go or even what will happen to them, their friends, or the Inferi.
"Yeah, because there wasn't." Ron shrugs. "The potion was a new invention, it wouldn't be in any book in any library. But that ritual spell, that lets you find things without intent, without knowing what you're looking for… it helped us find a clue at the scene of the attack even though it's been months."
If he's depressed, if he has depression, then he needs to go and do something about that. He needs to do something besides lying in bed and ignoring the clutter and mess in his apartment... if he's depressed, then he needs to actually get help.
Zabini just shrugs, looking bored. "You're sharing a room, yeah? I figured you must have seen his prick at least once. We've been having a bet going in the Slytherin common room since year three whether Potter is hung, average, or miniscule."
Draco listens to Harry chatter away as they head back inside, the charmed wheelchair easily moving across the gravel path under Harry's confident lead.
He can only hope it’s not some sort of temporary thing. That his father was only safe from Azkaban as long as Draco himself was in… Well, the state he was in. Though he doesn’t understand why the Wizengamot would have cared about that at all.
He frowns and tries to find his way to the Great Hall, but he keeps getting turned around and finding weird dead ends. In fact, the layout is very different from the
He makes it to Diagon Alley painlessly enough and starts to head to the Ministry to book his Portkey and get that whole thing sorted. He
“I just haven't felt like cleaning, not that it's any of your business. What are you even doing here? Go away, I don't want you here.”
Sometimes they walk with him, the noise of their voices washing over him as he carries the small furry creature with him. Its tongue is raspy, almost hurts when it licks his jaw. The sensation, so different from everything else, is welcome.
As Pansy launches into a long tirade about the latest dumb shit Blaise has been up to—no wonder she refused Draco’s suggestion to invite Blaise along, she wanted ‘complain about my boyfriend’ time—Draco lets her words wash over him. It’s a comfort and almost nostalgic thing.
The apparitions start laughing sneeringly. Harry turns on his feet immediately staring at Draco, watching as he turns frighteningly pale.
Draco suddenly places something in Harry's hand, and when he looks down he realizes that it's a bag of Peruvian instant Darkness powder. He has no idea how long Draco has been carrying this around, but it's going to come well in hand. With it, they'll be able to keep the herders from seeing what is up with a crystal. And if they can't see it, then they can't counteract it.
"All right... But I'm not making any promises!" She glances around the town square, relieved to see that there are still many people milling about—even though it's nearing dusk.
He shies away from the thoughts of what he nearly led his friends into, just because he forgot about the two-way mirror. He might have gotten them killed just because he lost his head, because he can’t keep Voldemort out of his thoughts.
He's even managed to keep it a secret from Draco (easier said than done considering that Draco is—no matter how much he may protest—both nosy and a gossip. He also happens to have an eagle eye for any and all changes to their flat).
“You truly do need it, Draco. You’re practically a ghost, you’re so pale. Staying inside brewing all day isn’t good for you!”
“We don’t think you’re involved with dark shit, Draco, chill.” Blaise rolls his eyes. “But we know you’ve… had someone. You’ve been sneaking around with someone for months, you know your ‘job’.” Blaise gives Draco a very arch look.
“Yes?” Draco’s eyes are glittering in the candle light as he leans his head on his fist, his lips curled in a beautiful smile.
Crabbe and Goyle immediately lumber off, looking cowed, but a tall guy Ron doesn't remember the name of stays with her.
So instead of blurting it out, possibly cheapening what should be an important moment for them, he blurts out something completely different:
Nausea climbs up his throat. Potter’s going to twist everyone against him, make everyone turn against him. Maybe that’s… that was the plan all along? Maybe it was all about turning everyone in Draco’s life against him?
We’re bloody well risking our necks to keep you ungrateful sods alive and all you come with are insults and accusations,” he sneers at them. “No wonder you’re not exactly
Someone takes him away from there, takes him back to what he thinks was once his room. And he goes to bed.
Draco’s hands shake as they clutch the vial of Basilisk venom. When Harry turns his gaze to Draco's face instead, he looks close to tears.
“Stop beating around the bush, Malfoy.” Harry pushes himself further into Malfoy’s personal space to throw him off kilter, to
"Turns out that Unicorn blood and Basilisk venom stain something terribly, and you need special stuff to remove it from glass." Ron nods. "It's why he vanished the glass too, rather than just casting Scourgify."
"He did," says Neville with a nod. "He's also expressing concern over the Ministry's interference with Hogwarts and refusal to teach Defence properly at a time such as this when we're 'more likely than ever' to need it."
No. No, they’ve never been like that. It would make far more sense for Weasley or Granger to be Potter’s Other.
“Don’t come inside, I’ll clean it up,” Harry says, feeling utterly dejected. It was all going so smoothly before this.
He turns to Draco, hand moving towards his pocket to bring out the ring, when he notices that Draco’s wearing a pained facial expression.
The man smiles at her then, and he almost... Well, Adriana must be seeing things because there's no reason this man would be
“Are you kidding? Our Harry? Who seemed to be good just about anywhere as long as there was a minimal bit of comfort?”
Draco presses his lips together. Emotions are for behind closed doors where no one can judge you! Bloody Gryffindors.
Draco falls to his knees and immediately starts to alter the circle using ink he summoned from their safe house and a brush he transfigured from a can they found in the cupboard.
Cassie, in typical cat-and-kneazle fashion, completely ignores him and bats at it again. She continues to bat at it, yowling loudly as she does so.
“Mr Malfoy,” she says, and suddenly she’s holding a vial with disgusting looking red liquid in it. “I must ask that you drink this potion immediately, the sooner, the better your chances.”
Now that he thinks about it, Draco wouldn’t be surprised if more than a few people have been told that their Other is
He will write them letters, one for each of them. Personalised and loving, so that they can carry something of him with them wherever their lives will take them in the future.
He thought there could be… Perhaps even if Draco hadn’t been deceived, even if Harry’s interest and their relationship had been genuine, they would have ended up breaking over the question of children.
“What the—? Well well well… So the blasted thing decided to skirt the rules, huh. Went to see Cousin Cissy. I’d be impressed if I wasn’t so pissed off.” Black gives Draco a glare—Draco thinks at least, it’s hard to tell through the mirror. “So?”
on the table by the bed, and crawls in under the covers. Cassiopeia lies down on the pillow next to Draco’s head and lets out that loud rumbling noise.
“No, I… I understand.” Harry gives him a wan smile, and pulls a galleon out of his pocket. He puts his wand to it, and Draco can only assume it’s one of the coins Granger used the protean charm on back in fifth year for their little battle club.
Harry stares at him for a long time, trying to parse what the hell Draco just said, before he realizes that Draco's right. If the diary was a Horcrux—and Harry is sure that it was— then the Basilisk venom was what destroyed it. After all, Harry used the fang of the dead Basilisk to pierce the diary and that was when the ghost of Tom Riddle disappeared.
It’s been heavily remodelled and cleaned out. It’s… lighter, clean. It’s so… it reminds him so much more of what it looked like during his childhood rather than when You-Know-Who had been in residence.
if Draco notices. It wouldn’t be the first time one of them has set up a romantic evening for the other. Of course, Draco’s tends to be less ostentatious, but that’s just because he knows that’s what Harry wants.
“Well,” Draco finally says. “At least we have somewhere to head to next. Something we can try to research and see if we can find: Hufflepuff’s cup and Ravenclaw's diadem.”
Who knows, maybe Ron and Hermione or even some of the others will make it to their location before Harry and Draco put their plan into motion, but there's no guarantee. Their friends just have to know that they will set it off but if they make it... They can help.
happier, maybe. But it's not exactly realistic to even really imagine something happening between him and Malfoy. He's not even sure
green in his face, before colours seem to explode outwards from them, painting the world around them with all the colours Draco had somehow forgotten existed.
It's still kind of the only thing that makes sense here. Potter is the one who came here and started talking about how he misses Draco, and how he'd noticed that Draco was getting worse and he'd broken up with Draco because of that, and he’s here saying that he thinks Draco probably has depression. So clearly that means he broke up with Draco because he'd thought Draco had depression.
Adriana has heard the story a hundred times, surely, at this point, but she never gets tired of hearing it anew. No one tells it as well as her mother, she's sure of it.
Healer Binns lets out a loud hum. “I suppose you could call it an Occlumency accident, though we’re still not sure what triggered it.”
He cannot possibly stay here any longer, surrounded by memories of what he thought he and Harry had. Painfully reliving a relationship that was just a play, a most cruel joke, is not something Draco can stand. He's always been a coward, but more so he's always been driven by self-preservation.
“Right,” Harry says and squints at Draco. “So you're saying the Sword of Gryffindor was made by goblins? I kind of assumed that Godric Gryffindor made it himself…”
Draco stares at him then, and his face suddenly turns brilliantly red. Very much like a ripe tomato. and Harry realizes that there is actually something that does not look really good on Draco: he's not really an attractive blusher. It's splotchy and patchy and stands out so starkly against his pale skin it almost looks a bit weird.
His biggest fear is that the Herders will send Inferi inside without coming in themselves. He's levitated the remaining Herder’s body away and hidden it, so that they won't suspect anything when they come back.
"I really need to leave," Harry whispers, though his hands still hold Draco tight. "I really wish I didn't need to, but I do."
Footsteps and loud shouting suddenly echoes through the room and Harry feels his pulse spike. His breathing grows shallow, and he doesn't know what to do with himself. He moves backwards, closer to Draco, closer so that he'll be near and capable of protecting him better.
"Because he couldn't tell anyone what they'd been used in… though usually he would just have reported it as
break up with Ginny before all of this. So he doesn't really have anything to be apologetic about, especially since it's just that he thinks Draco is pretty, right?
It’s possible, isn’t it? Considering how terrible Draco used to be, and all the mistakes he’s made. Isn’t it arrogant of him to think that someone like Harry, who suffered so much due to Draco and his parents, could ever forgive him?
As Healer Binns’s magic washes over Draco, he relaxes into the bed and tries not to think of anything at all.
It tingles and warms and feels like something he’s long forgotten. It’s like a memory of a sensation suddenly overlapping with reality. It’s as if he feels it and remembers the feeling at the same time.
Father mentioned that there is at least one portrait of him at Hogwarts, but Draco doesn’t know if he wants to go see it.
They sneak through the house until they finally get to a blank wall. There's nothing but fancy looking wallpaper. They've already passed a few doors, but the place where Draco stops, there is no door.
Laughing, Harry opens the door and yells something down the hallway. Draco can't even begin to fight the smile that the sudden stampede of footsteps brings to his lips.
“Are we… okay? I mean, uhm… Are we broken up or…?” Harry says as the silence has lasted for a short while.
And… it is. Now that he’s thinking about it, that actually sounds quite lovely. His family certainly have more than enough money to get through all the red-tape regarding private international floos, and Draco knows his parents would metaphorically jump at the chance to spoil him in such a way. He’s been very strict regarding wanting to work on his potions business and living in his own apartment—even though of course he’s always had his full Gringotts vault to fall back on—so to give them a chance to spend money on him…
Harry nods. “She remains the Matron of Hogwarts, and she has expressed that she is on our side, too. A few of the teachers have been forced to leave the school, due to... Different allegiances. But that's neither here nor there. The most important players are luckily on our side.”
Draco happily chats with her. Mipsy came by and warned her, and has been staying on to help out even though Loulou and Bibi no doubt have things well under control on their own—Mipsy has never really been willing to share Draco, having been his nanny elf as a baby. The Villa is well cared for and according to Loulou the herb garden is flourishing extra nicely this year.
“Oh, don't start!” Harry's going to strangle him. He's absolutely going to strangle him if it doesn't start talking clearly and stop getting sidetracked in these endless rants about nothing useful at all.
Of course, the assailant hadn’t known about the automatic ledgers, so he probably thought that he was home free with nothing to trace him back to what had happened at all.
Harry rolls his eyes, but doesn't interrupt this time. He's just going to let Draco go off on these tangents and talk about how great his family is since it seems like that will actually make things progress quicker than if Harry tries to make him get to the point.
He can… only assume that Potter and his side won it, for surely the Dark Lord would not have spared a second to keep Draco alive
“I've had it!" Draco suddenly yells and gets to his feet. He stomps off into the forest and Harry watches him, afraid that he's leaving too. That just like Ron and Hermione, he won't come back.
Draco loves to have him there, just the two of them or with a five year-old Teddy running around their legs. He wants to give Teddy as many memories of him as he can, before he’s gone. He’s old enough that with the help of photographs and stories, he should be able to remember Draco.
The green glow is visible from far away, and Harry thinks it's some form of faery fire until they get close enough that Draco gasps and stops. The green light comes from a large green crystal that is hovering in the air above some sort of altar. Around it all is a large circle of runes and sigils that reminds Harry of nothing so much as an alchemy circle he's flipped by in a few of his textbooks back at Hogwarts or a "Black Magic" circle from Muggle telly.
He remembers the feeling of Malfoy’s hand pressed over his mouth and how soft his skin had been. His nose had been filled with the scent of lavender, and now Harry can only wonder where it came from. People don’t
he tell them that he's having wet dreams about him? They'd be horrified and possibly even angry! Harry knows
He wonders if he will know more names, more than just that of the small furry creature. He wonders if, perhaps, he will remember his name, or his parents' names, or the Manor's name... Or perhaps even the names of the strangers he once thought might be his friends.
It becomes background noise to the point that he stops even hearing it, and instead starts to slowly fall back asleep. There's no real reason for why he's so tired today, but he gets these spells occasionally.
time hanging out with You-Know-Who was more than enough and decided to not join his ranks again, they’re hardly going to be leading anyone through the wards.
Harry’s just relieved no one has turned to him yet, that they’re all too distracted by the newspaper to remember that he’s in the room at all.
and no other could know love better than she. The God of the Sun did not falter with his loss, did not diminish at having his lover ripped from him; instead he burned ever brighter. He became more determined than ever, and ever more fierce in his desire to end the God Wisher's mad rampage.
“Bloody—! No!” He stalks up to the chairs and grabs his wand before he shoulders his way past Potter. “I explained all of that in the letter, and I will reiterate what I said in the end: piss off, Potter. I’m not having this conversation with you. You seem to be under the impression that
“Yeah,” Harry grinned, “Remus taught me. It was great actually as he’d learned a few of my dad’s recipes which he then passed on to me. I make a mean chicken biryani.”
Draco seemed to be drawing close to completion, as he was emitting high, punched out noises. Harry could feel the towel grow sodden as a wet puddle of slick spread out around them. He looked up, over Draco’s head and froze in shock when he realised they were facing the large bathroom mirror.
“But why can’t you tell people it was a spell?” Ron blurted out. “That’s what I don’t get, I mean, it’s not your fault and people are going to think…well.”
“Is that what you’d like?” Harry asked, grinning, reaching up to move them around, Harry still almost fully clothed in his suit whilst Draco sat exposed and naked atop of him. The omega’s chest was rising and falling in puffed pants of air. Harry sat up further, pressing his mouth against Draco’s ear and whispering hotly.
However, after Crabbe had presented as an alpha, his parents had transferred him to Durmstrang in order to try and make a new start, hopefully resulting in a good mating arrangement. Goyle had followed soon after, which had stung Draco slightly but he couldn’t begrudge that Greg had probably always been closer to Vince than he had Draco.
“And I’d like a roof of some sort,” Draco added, “but…” he paused and looked at Harry, “I know you don’t like small spaces.”
“I feel sick,” Draco whined, his head turning to one side and his grey eyes opening to look pleadingly at Harry.
“Mm,” Harry murmured, not the least bit interested in Dean’s plans for his sexual exploits. “What about you and Hermione?” Harry said looking up, “Is she going tomorrow?”
Draco accepted a glass of water a few moments later from Harry, staring down at the cup and feeling pretty shoddy about himself. He should be
“Steady,” Ron warned under his breath, disguising it as a cough. Harry felt fucking furious, what right did any of these people have to start talking about an omega they didn’t even know like that? Besides, it wasn’t even true, now that Harry had seen Draco without a tear stained face and bloodshot eyes, the omega was actually quite pretty. His white blond hair had turned shiny from the prenatal potions and since Harry and Madam Pomfrey had been forcing him to eat better, Draco’s face had rounded out a little. His features were sharper than most omegas but it just served to make him look more elegant and refined, like some sort of aristocratic lordling.
“I s-should really have sleeves as an omega,” Draco murmured, glancing back at the mirror and running his own fingers up his pale arms. He turned back to Harry with a gleam in his eyes, “But I think my mother might have been quite daring for her time!”
“There we go,” Harry whispered, encouragingly. He tried to ignore the fact that he was completely hard in his jeans and had been since the first moment he had walked through the curtains. There was no denying it now, just how much Harry’s alpha, and Harry himself, wanted the boy in front of him.
was he saying? As if to try and prove a point, he held up his own large hands despite Draco not being able to see them through the curtain.
It had been incredibly awkward, Draco would stand stiffly and try his hardest not to look at Harry whilst the other man splayed a large, warm hand over his still flat belly. Thankfully, Draco’s utter humiliation and nerves mitigated any potential embarrassing bodily reactions that he might have otherwise had with a handsome alpha that he liked touching him.
“Bill’s French wife’s cousin is here,” Muriel declared, “she’s an omega and around Harry’s age at that.”
“Okay,” Draco nodded, suddenly looking very sleepy. Harry felt a little guilty, it was probably the middle of the night and the poor omega was still very pregnant.
“Yes, well, no one’s ever accused you of being a blushing wallflower Harry,” Remus replied looking amused. “Draco on the other hand…”
“I know,” Harry said firmly. “But the truth is Draco, you’re pregnant with my child.” Harry regretted the way Draco stiffened. “I feel responsible for you even if it was due to a spell. Our lives are going to be connected now whether we planned for it or not and I’d like to get to know you properly.”
love was not enough?” Snape paused, his head hanging between his shoulders. Remus’ eyes took the opportunity to flick nervously up to Harry’s.
It had been two weeks since Draco had been taken to the Hospital Wing and so far, along with the help of Severus’ home brewed scent suppressors, Draco had managed to keep his ‘condition’ away from prying noses. Unfortunately, it looked like the dab-on tinctures had reached their limit and the whispers had already started up from that morning.
“I’m sorry,” Draco murmured, feeling even worse. On top of making a complete fool out of himself, he had also gone and ruined Harry’s night.
“Oh f-fuck,” Draco whined, squeezing his eyes tightly shut and trying to focus on not coming too soon. He knew Harry wouldn’t mind but Draco wanted to hold on to this current thread of pleasure for as long as possible.
Draco eyes were wide and amazed as Seamus levitated the amorphous blob over the table where it went shiny and taut, stretching into the recognizable form of a sausage dog.
“Bigger, right,” Harry nodded, waving his wand as the bolster pillows began to lengthen like playdough sausages rolled under your palm.
“Is that you Harry?” A dark haired beta woman who looked to be in her late thirties was beaming at them. “You know, my assistant Agatha told me there was a rather dapper alpha looking through my windows but imagine my surprise when I saw who it was.”
“Do you not like it or something?” Harry asked, ignoring the shocked murmurings as he swung his legs over the bench and sat down next to Draco. Harry towered over the omega, along with most of the betas and even the alphas on the Slytherin table. Plus, he did look so much older than them, Draco couldn’t imagine what was going through some of the staff members’ minds as he saw even a great number of professors were peering over at them from the high table. Draco knew that knowledge of the spell was being kept strictly between Professor McGonagall, Severus and Madam Pomfrey.
“You want my cock?” Harry asked, quirking a thick eyebrow as Draco felt the rigid weight press against his thigh, the wet head slipping on Draco’s skin.
worthy ones Ronald,” Hermione snapped, causing Ron to look sheepish and cower slightly behind Harry. “It’s just, oh Harry, I know it’s wrong, but when it gets out that you’ve gotten an omega pregnant…”
“Molly says they make me look distinguished,” Harry gave his friend a shit eating grin. “What do you think Draco?”
Harry nuzzled into Draco’s neck, swiping his tongue delicately over Draco’s scent gland before groaning. A thick honeyed apple was released into the air but the element of frost was there too, sharpening the tang and making Harry burn with want. He lathed up Draco’s throat in kitten licks, making sure to imprint his own scent in every dip and groove of the omega’s body.
Eventually they came to an area where a young blond witch sat next to a massive glass sphere, close to the size of a small room. Draco tried to look inside, however the sphere was almost opaque, being full of densely swirling snow.
“Draco,” Harry hissed, leaning forwards and holding Draco’s face in his hands, he gazed at the omega in wonder for a moment before kissing him squarely on the mouth and whispering, “I think you’re having the baby sweetheart.”
is where you’ve been storing all your body heat.” He laughed as Draco glared up at him. The younger boy’s petulance quickly dissolved, however, as Harry began to thrust his finger in and out of the omega’s writhing body. As Draco lurched forwards, more of Harry’s cock was forced into his mouth but as he jerked back, Harry’s finger slipped deeper into his body.
“Isn’t that dirty?” Draco asked, turning round slightly and frowning at Harry, he looked completely perplexed and Harry simply wanted to gobble him up.
“I must then entreat you Harry,” McGonagall paused, considering her words carefully, “please consider your next move with your usual level of empathy.”
“Oh you poor dear,” she tutted, “I remember how it is, in fact my daughter Pippa is going through the same thing – I recommend buying a heated wheat bag from Cobblepebbles on Diagon. They’ve got a great selection of nice smelling ones too, like lavender, or I think for a little extra they can infuse the wheat with a sample of your alpha’s scent.”
“It’s fine,” Draco smiled tightly, hoping that the three of them didn’t really still see him a some dumb school kid.
Thank you for reading and being kind. I wrote this as I have been feeling terribly down and I appreciated your kindness and support immensely. I hope you enjoyed it and are well.
“Do you want to get some air?” Colum asked, turning to Harry. “I heard you mention you’ve got a headache and it’s wicked hot in here.”
Draco pouted and reached for a ripe persimmon, not bothering to cut it into slices before he bit into it. Juice exploded across Draco’s tongue, it was sweet and rich and he smiled happily up at Harry.
“It’s not that,” Draco shook his head, “I love clothes, but Aunt Bella has always said you shouldn’t let omegas feel too fancy about themselves.”
“Oh,” Draco blushed, Harry said it so matter of factly, like it wasn’t something that should be concealed from polite society. Bellatrix had even refused to use the word ‘heats’, instead referring to them as ‘tri-monthly flushes’. Draco’s eyes suddenly widened as he looked back at Harry, “I d-didn’t do or say anything did I? It wasn’t like a real heat?”
“Merlin’s balls Harry, you rob the Louvre or something?” Sirius guffawed as Harry rolled his eyes. “Are we on the run from Interpol now?”
Currently, Harry was out on the pitch enjoying a game of quidditch with the rest of Gaedere House. The older man had left Draco revising for Charms in the Morgana Suite. Draco hoped Harry wouldn’t be angry with him after he discovered what had happened but it wasn’t like Harry had ever tried to control Draco’s movements.
“Yeah, course,” Harry replied, settling down on the sofa. “Although if you’ve got a bump now are those things going to be in the right size?”
“What f-for?” Draco snapped, he was still feeling nauseous from his over ambitious breakfast and being around so many different alphas and betas in the crowd was making him dizzy, tendrils of panic prickling down his spine.
“I thought you’d have more clothes,” Harry frowned, peering into the closet and seeing only a few hangers occupied. A moment later he could scent that he had embarrassed Draco again and internally cursed himself. “Are you not really into things like that?” Harry ventured.
“You made me a cake!” Draco exclaimed, extracting himself from Harry’s arms and waddling over to the table.
Harry’s mouth went dry as his gaze lingered on the unmarked juncture between Draco’s neck and shoulder, right where a mating bite would go. The skin was so white and creamy, with the three recognisable dark freckles. Harry couldn’t stop himself from moving one of his own hands to rub the back of Draco’s neck, just to see the satisfying contrast in their complexions.
The next morning Harry had promised he would teach Draco how to bake brownies. As usual he had awoken with a sleepy, snuffly omega curled up in bed next to him.
Draco gave a strangled gasp, allowing Harry’s fingers to pull his chin back up, his back curving lower and causing his passage to tighten around the intrusion.
“I –I –“ Draco began before Harry could bear it no more and he let himself collapse into a delighted peal of laughter.
“Right, let’s make some brow -“ Harry was cut short by a dramatic squeal. He gaped as he was met with a flash of Draco’s very white bare buttocks, jiggling wildly as the omega scrambled to pull the duvet up from the nearby bed and around his nude body.
Draco flinched slightly as he realised Harry’s green eyes were now on him, having caught Draco staring at the alpha.
“Yeah,” Harry shrugged nonchalantly, “but I’d like to be around at first you know, help look after the baby – change nappies, that sort of thing.”
“Don’t you think you owe Venetia an apology?” a willowy beta girl Draco knew was called Iona crossed her arms over her chest and levelled Draco with a demanding glare.
“Have you bought some things then?” Ginny asked, peering over to the bags that Harry was carrying. Draco tensed as Harry yanked the bags away from the curious red head, he knew full well that one of them contained his bunched up slicked jeans and underwear. “Smells a bit…” Ginny frowned and sniffed the air before her face split into a shark like grin.
The trolley lady’s face morphed into a sympathetic expression as Harry scented that she was an omega herself.
Harry had always expected to bond with someone after years of dating. Maybe after he had progressed to becoming a mid level auror and was ready to start a family. He tried to imagine that still happening, of meeting someone else in the future. However, no matter how many times he pictured it, the person would always morph back into Draco.
After presenting omega, however, it switched more to just being icily ignored. A month ago, Draco had been half wondering if he had started turning invisible as a group of second years had obliviously barrelled into him on the third floor corridor.
“No, I do!” Draco insisted quickly, blushing as Harry chuckled. Madam Pomfrey bustled over to them a moment later and sequestered Draco onto a bed further along.
“Oh dear,” Hermione laughed, “that does sound like a pickle. I thought you and Harry bought some maternity wear in London?”
“It’s okay, it’s okay sweetheart, I’m still here,” Harry murmured, managed to extricate himself completely before hurrying to get a towel. Harry wrapped the thick purple cloth around his middle, hoping to conceal his own state of arousal before he leant down to scoop Draco up and lift him out of the now empty tub. “I’ve got you,” Harry told the struggling omega who pressed his face against Harry’s scent glands before falling limp in his arms.
“Are you excited to be a dad?” the girl who had broken her arm asked, the colour returning to her cheeks after a particularly strong episkey.
Draco stiffened and blushed, his grip on the menu tightening as he tried to decide between poppy seed cake or a slice of Battenberg. The latter was usually his favourite, however for some reason Draco had gone right off the smell and taste of almonds recently, perhaps it was a pregnancy thing.
“Madam Pomfrey says you have to eat more,” Harry frowned. “Especially as you’re not fully mated,” he looked somewhat uncomfortable saying the last part.
“I think y-you should buy that shirt,” Draco said, almost too quickly to be intelligible before disappearing back behind the curtain.
“Hold on,” Harry instructed, placing his hands over Draco’s bony hips and hoisting him up onto Harry’s thighs so that the two of them were facing the same way.
“Oh wonderful, I’d love to hear some new opinions on a couple of my more recent designs,” she said, clapping her hands together. “Oh but for Circe’s sakes, you’d better both come in before you catch a chill. Deadly this wind is, it’s coming from the north.”
This new position, however seemed to have allowed Draco to finally get better access to himself as he let out a sigh of hiccoughing relief. Harry closed his eyes and tried to think about literally anything else. He could do this, he could get through this if it meant looking after Draco. He could only hope that Draco’s memory of the night would be hazy enough so as to not cause him any unnecessary mortification.
“Draco!” Harry shouted, holding the omega’s trembling body tightly before jerking his head up to stare dangerously at Smith. “
“Maybe you should go on a walk?” Neville piped up. “It always clears my head when I’m in a funk. You never feel worse after a walk you know.”
“Sort of,” Draco’s eyes flicked downwards, showing off his fan of blond lashes as he opened the door.
“That’s the spirit,” Ron nodded, looking like he was trying not to laugh. “I’ll go get the sausages.”
“Draco had hot soup spilled on him, I don’t suppose you have any soothing ointment left do you Katie?” Hermione asked.
“There’s a bump?” Harry jerked his head to stare questioningly at Draco. There was a strange expression on the alpha’s face that Draco couldn’t place but it almost made him want to run and hide.
Draco shook his head, “I’m fine, thank you.” He ignored Harry’s teasing smile. Draco knew full well the alpha found it amusing that Draco refused to take off his large fuzzy cardigan in front of Ron. Even if the older students had more progressive views of omegas, there were some things that just weren’t done in Draco’s mind. That argument however, always felt a bit weak whenever Draco looked down and saw his stomach.
“Right?” Harry laughed. “Also apparently me, Ron and Mione are in a very dramatic love triangle. I’m secretly married to Celestina Warbeck, one of my godfathers turned me into a werewolf, I actually got this scar from my
“Right,” Ginny declared loudly, sliding off the bed to march over to Seamus and jab him in the chest, managing to look intensely menacing despite being a fair bit smaller than him. “You, Finnegan, are not to go breathing a word of this to anyone. We don’t want the whole school getting the wrong end of the stick okay?”
“Do you cook?” Draco asked, remembering that one of Harry’s godfathers had mentioned cooking in his letter.
Although Harry’s custody of Draco would end after the baby was born, he was sure the alpha wouldn’t let his child live in squalor. Regardless, Draco knew he wasn’t welcome back at the Lestranges, not that he would ever subject his baby to Bellatrix.
Draco’s neck was long and swan like and Harry could see the line of three freckles he had spotted that first time in the Hospital Wing.
“I’m worried people will stare,” Draco admitted, knowing that everybody already did anyway. As was typical of Hermione though, she didn’t scoff or dismiss Draco’s concerns, instead she nodded thoughtfully.
“W-Will he be okay?” Draco asked tentatively as Hermione ushered him through a large door with a stone relief of an Arthurian knight.
“Yes,” Snape sighed without inflection as he gazed up at Harry with beady, almost black eyes. “And I am glad for it. Draco inherited none of his father’s pompous manipulation and deserves to be cared for in the way he so craves. I trust you will take good care of him.”
“You don’t have to, sorry,” Damien’s face fell. “It’s just there’s an alpha in my year called Finneas who keeps trying to get me alone and I don’t like him.”
“What a shame for you that the selfish spell you created decided to save parts of both of them,” Remus remarked wryly.
“Why didn’t you tell me they were here alrea-“ Snape fell silent as he saw Harry standing next to the Lestranges.
The original date of the wedding, the fifth of June, had actually proved a little too soon for all that Harry had wanted to set up. Instead, it had been moved to the fifth of August, meaning that Draco would have already given birth and had some time to recover. Harry couldn’t quite believe that in only a couple of months he would have both a child and a husband.
Remus gestured for them to all go over to the sofa area, offering to take their coats which he hung up on what looked to be a repurposed muggle traffic light.
Harry glanced to observe the younger boy on the bed beside him. Draco had evidently fallen back asleep, his face half smushed into the pillow and his other cheek bearing crease marks, red against his milky skin. The omega’s hair had been growing quite quickly since he became pregnant and it was spread out around him like a silver halo. In truth, he did look like an angel, albeit with a small patch of drool on his chin.
Draco let out a stuttered whine, his mouth still full of Harry’s cock as Harry pushed in a digit, slowly and only to the first knuckle. Draco’s walls contracted around him, squeezing the intrusion as if his body wasn’t sure whether to suck it further up or push it back out.
Draco began trying to take off his nightgown, weakly scrabbling at the straps before Harry shushed him gently, helping the omega lift up his arms and pulling him free of the creamy silk. Immediately, Harry plastered his naked chest against Draco’s back, their skin slipping together with sweat. His hands snaked round Draco’s sides, cupping and kneading his small breasts as the younger boy moaned, throwing his head back against Harry’s shoulder.
“Oh yeah,” Harry laughed grimly, “as you can imagine he’s well chuffed him and Remus are going to be grandparents already.”
“Merlin,” Ron yawned, stretching up and cracking his back from side to side. “our DADA coursework next term is being organised along with the Auror Programme.”
“I’m serious you berk,” Ginny half snapped, shoving at Harry’s legs. “Sometimes I think you forget my mum’s an omega. I know what it’s like okay? I just wanted to let you know that there’s no hard feelings.”
“Well I didn’t design the building, what about the clothes?” Olive snorted as Harry shot her a guilty look.
“More than!” Olive laughed before her eyes fell questioningly on Draco. “And who’s this lovely young thing?”
The omega visibly cringed as he hugged himself tighter. Harry felt a little winded by the revelation. He had known of course, that at some point Draco would start producing milk in order to feed their baby after birth but he hadn’t realised that such a thing could occur in only the second trimester.
“I think I might just sit it out,” Harry sighed, hoping everyone wouldn’t give him too much grief about it. “I promised Draco I’d help him revise for History of Magic.”
As per Draco’s sole request, there was a vast stone patio with ornamental balustrade. It was on this that Harry had arranged for the chairs and flower arch to be set up for their ceremony.
Draco wasn’t stuttering as much as usual and Harry hoped that Hermione was right and the younger boy wasn’t feeling too nervous. Although as a result, it did mean that Harry now noticed that Draco had a very slight lisp, or perhaps it was just his incredibly posh accent.
Draco shivered and whined, pawing at Harry’s shirt and dislodging his flower button hole. Tiny white petals stuck to Draco’s damp hands and then his cheeks as he hid his face with his fingers.
“Yeah, Madam Pomfrey says we shouldn’t apparate or floo for at least another week after Draco’s injury,” Harry told her. It’s not a big deal, we’ll find a quiet compartment on the Hogwarts Express and then get the bus to Padfoot’s.”
“What are you doing?!” Draco squeaked, causing Harry to freeze and peer down at the omega. Draco’s face seemed to be a mix between scared and affronted and it almost made Harry laugh before he shook his head.
“I’m not sure,” Harry cleared his throat, “I mean, I have bigger hands than you,” Harry blinked at his own insanity, what the
“Sorry I’m late,” Harry announced, affecting his best nonchalant cheer. “Thought I’d come and check on how you’re feeling today?”
“Plus I was lying before,” Ginny continued, completely undeterred, “I do think he’s pretty. I reckon most people do, they're just too scared to admit it because his family were all Death-Eaters.”
“No,” Harry growled darkly in response. Suddenly, the mood in the room changed as Sirius’ face lit up and he shrugged off his jacket, jumping up from the chair.
“Sounds like our baby’s hungry,” Harry laughed before peering into the soup bowl and pulling a face. “You don’t like broccoli?”
“Oh keep your knickers on,” Sirius huffed, “It wasn’t meant to imply anything other than Bellatrix has always been a vile piece of work. The woman burned ants with a magnifying glass for fun whilst the rest of us played gobstones and made sandcastles.”
Draco nodded in thanks as he hurried to pull on the clothes before wrapping himself in a very large, fluffy buttercup yellow cardigan that smelled like the nice beta.
Sirius was sat on the sofa reading a travel book about Bolivia. Remus was leaning against the mantelpiece, offering Draco advice whenever he reached a confusing set of German instructions.
“Do you want me to take a look?” The woman with the plait asked, coming over to Draco and gesturing for him to sit back on the bed. “I’m training to be a healer, my name’s Padma.”
“I had to get you in an ice bath,” Harry began, “to cool your temperature. You were pretty out of it but I promise I left your underwear on. I was just worried Draco, you were burning up and the healer said it was the fastest way. You started showing signs of going through a semi-heat but I
“Absolutely irresponsible,” a man was snarling, “I took you into my home, fed you, clothed you, and this is how you repay us? By attempting to bring further shame to our families?”
Draco woke up gradually and it took a good few minutes before his eyes focussed and he seemed to become properly aware of the surroundings.
“Never mind Harry, I know you and the rest of the Weasley boys have never paid much mind to fashion. You know, last Christmas I gave Percy a hand woven shirt made with silk from Serbian sugarplum silkworms? Well two months ago I find out the rotter went and washed it above forty degrees!”
Harry thought that was understandable, especially as Molly had already put her foot in it slightly by talking about how she had already been thinking about decorating the garden for Harry’s eventual coupling over a year ago. This, having been before Draco was even in the picture, had led to the omega unhappily assuming it to mean that Molly had originally had a different bride in mind.
With that Harry left, striding purposefully past the milling students until he finally re-entered his original compartment.
“Oh, this is Draco,” Hermione, flapped her hand dismissively from the wardrobe. “Draco, this is Padma, Felicity and Katie.”
“By the way,” Harry cleared his throat and turned to the Lestranges, “I think you’ll find that medical custody of a pregnant omega falls to the alpha they coupled with.”
Harry flipped the covers back and rummaged around for some clothes, grateful that he’d had the mind to at least put some boxers back on last night.
“So how is the little omega?” Ginny asked, immediately moving to lie in the warm patch Harry had just vacated. “He popped yet?”
“What? Don’t you fancy it?” Ron asked, raising his eyebrows. Traditionally every year for Seamus’ birthday they would all apparate down to London and go out to some wizarding club. The night could get pretty raucous and give everybody blackmail material for at least the next year.
“I’m sorry, what?” Harry scrunched up his face. Everyone in Gaedere slept around, they were in their twenties and he really didn’t get why it was suddenly worthy of a meeting. Did they think Harry was some sort of sexual ambassador or something?
“Let’s do that now!” Draco gulped, scrambling to try and get up but accidentally slipping on the snow and careening down. Harry caught Draco immediately, one hand bracketed gently on his belly and the other on Draco’s left hip, holding him tightly. Draco could feel the heat of Harry’s body and realised that this new position meant that Draco’s bottom was pressed backwards into Harry’s crotch.
Draco was lovely, Harry concluded. He was sweet and clever, albeit painfully shy and at times amusingly innocent and proper. He was earnest in his feelings and didn’t ever use his omega status to try and manipulate those around him. Despite having been raised by the Lestranges, he was nothing like the calculated harshness of his aunt or the blustering pretensions of his uncle.
“Yeah, sorry,” Harry sighed, scrubbing his face and trying to remember if he had brushed his teeth that morning.
“Now let’s just shuffle you forwards a touch,” Harry murmured as he helped the younger boy wiggle into a position that didn’t strain his back but also gave Harry access to begin his massage.
“So, do you like it?” Harry asked, turning back round to see Draco smiling dreamily up at the patterned ceiling. An aged fresco of constellations adorned the exposed surface, dry powder pigments in hues of blue illustrated astrological charts overlaying alabaster stars.
Draco gasped as Harry crowded him further, gently lowering them both to the ground. “You know, we haven’t made a snow angel yet,” Harry told him, his voice quiet as Draco became acutely aware of quite how close the alpha was, all the points they were pressed against each other.
The shop had pale wooden floorboards and painted yellow walls. There were racks and rails of clothes, including an entire display section for shoes. Draco struggled to take it all in before realizing there was even a staircase leading to a second floor.
“You go ahead,” Remus smiled, “I think I might take advantage of Professor Sprout’s generosity and harvest some of this fabulous rosemary and mint for mine and Sirius’ Sunday Roast.”
“There’s a rollercoaster!” Draco blurted out as he watched the cart of laughing, screaming witches and wizards do a loop the loop. The cart had been transfigured to look like a sleigh, whilst charmed wooden reindeer sped along the track.
“Actually,” Remus cleared his throat, “there’s one more, it’s only small but something Sirius found the other day. This is for you Draco, from us.”
“Hey, you’re Harry Potter aren’t you?” the Ravenclaw boy asked as he sat up on a bed and waited his turn. “You’re having a baby with that Seventh Year.”
Draco keened as Harry let out a laugh, the alpha’s hand snaking down, bypassing Draco’s hardened prick and instead caressing his balls. “You want my fingers?”
“Nah, we’ll do the rink first,” Ron peered down at the map, “work up an appetite then have lunch somewhere, I bet there’s loads of free samples.”
In a somewhat startling turn of events, Harry had insisted they buy nearly every outfit Draco had tried on in Olive’s boutique. This meant that over the last month Draco had very much enjoyed locking himself away in the Morgana Suite and trying on all of the delicate items of clothing, marvelling at himself in the mirror.
The thing about having grown up already semi-famous and then becoming quite popular on top of that, was that Harry had always been rather hesitant to get too involved with people he didn’t already know very well. He glanced down the table, whilst he had lots of friends and was never short of social engagements, maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to start branching out and showing more of an interest in other people’s lives.
“Good, now we’ll put this dress in the ‘definite’ pile and you can try on some more clothes for me okay? Maybe I’ll finally learn something about fashion.”
“You d-didn’t bite me,” Draco murmured as Harry sagged in understanding and quickly gathered the younger boy up in his arms, holding him close and nuzzling into his hair.
Draco looked out across the Great Hall from an empty corner of the Slytherin table. He had been pushing the peas around on his plate for the last ten minutes. Finally, the doors swung open and the Gaedere students came traipsing in, laughing and talking.
Harry helped Draco to turn on the taps, along with one specially installed for bubble bath, when there was a tentative knock on the door. Harry left Draco in the bathroom, happily swishing the growing bubbles with his fingers whilst Harry tucked himself back into his trousers and gingerly cracked open the bedroom door.
“I guess,” Harry replied, feeling secretly very relieved. He really loved Molly Weasley and it would be terrible to have disappointed her.
Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise, “A bit late for that, don’t you think Professor? You’re the one that left that journal somewhere Draco could find.”
“Why?” Katie scrunched up her face, “Your last NEWT was yesterday, you do realise the beauty of that is
“Well,” Harry cleared his throat, “I would love it if we stayed for a while longer. I think you’d really like the rescue penguin section, you can buy a bucket of fish to feed them. However, the last thing I want is for you to be walking around cold and uncomfortable. I don’t think cleaning charms work very well on…
Draco watched as Harry rolled up the sleeves of his shirt, revealing hairy, dark forearms, the corded tendons flexing as he grabbed his tall ginger friend and steered them over to the Gaedere table. Draco blushed and flicked his eyes downwards back at his abandoned meal.
“I know I d-don’t have any occasion to wear it,” Draco whispered, turning back to Harry and smoothing out the front of the dress self consciously.
Draco gaped at the festive flurry of sights, sounds and smells rolled out before them. The Winter Wonderland was absolutely massive. Much bigger, Draco suspected, than the one in Hogsmeade would have been.
A moment later, Severus Snape appeared at the top of the stairs, long black dress robes trailing behind him and a silver brooch in the shape of a sprig of holly pinned to his chest.
“Yes,” Draco replied, looking excited again and hurrying back into the changing room before drawing the drapes.
“Oh, this will not go well,” Hermione muttered, rapidly casting her own cooling charm over the previously hot custard as it began to expand and pulsate.
Draco blinked as he tried to recover from the emotional whiplash. Remus let out a long suffering sigh before shaking his head at Harry, “You’ve just got to remember how to deal with him occasionally,” Remus explained before leaning forwards and giving Draco a tentative smile.
“Draco? Hey, what’s wrong?” Harry hurried to push the covers off himself, reaching over to squeeze the younger boy’s shoulder.
“What do you mean your allowance?” Harry frowned. “Didn’t you inherit from your parents, like I did?”
“Right you,” Olive looked up at Harry before pointing towards a comfortable looking sofa in the corner. “I reckon you might as well take a seat whilst Draco and I start staging the next Fashion Week.”
Draco blinked up into Harry’s concerned expression, realizing that the alpha was cradling Draco’s face tenderly as if inspecting him for any signs of injury.
Draco felt pleased as he wriggled back on the sofa. Harry leant in to him a moment later, the alpha’s breath hot against the cold shell of Draco’s ear.
“Crikey,” Ron groaned, rubbing his own aching calves, “we’re meant to be going out tomorrow night for Seamus’ birthday.”
“Well, like Remus said,” Harry declared, stretching his neck lazily from side to side, “let’s leave the past in the past.”
“Y-You really think so?” Draco looked so incredibly earnest that Harry found himself nodding vociferously. “Aunt Bella thinks these types of clothes are…” Draco trailed off, casting his eyes downwards and his scent changing from apples.
Hermione had yet to say anything, but Harry could tell she was bursting to. He had managed to get his best friends alone that evening, in a small study room in the Gaedere annexe. The walls were covered with Rococo style paintings, the occupants of which were listening closely. Harry figured as soon as he left, the figures would be off, dashing between canvases to spread the news that Harry Potter had impregnated some hapless omega.
“Have you told Sirius and Remus?” Ron asked as Harry pulled a face. He had already sent a letter to his godfathers that morning via owl. He vaguely remembered they were Indonesia right about now and wasn’t sure what time the post would arrive.
Harry felt momentarily bitter that Hermione would know that, having touched Draco a lot more than Harry had over the last couple of months.
“Well we’re graduating in a few months and I’m also going to be a father by then,” Harry replied wryly. “It was probably about time.”
“Fuck, I’m so lucky,” Harry groaned, kissing the omega again, licking his way hotly into Draco’s lax and receptive mouth. Harry’s hand didn’t stop massaging and pulling, milking all the aftershocks of Draco’s orgasm out of him. Eventually, it became too much and Draco let out a whine of discomfort, clearly over sensitised as he weakly tried to push Harry away.
was me trying to do the right thing. Siphoning you my magic and making sure you ate alright for those first couple of months,
“I have photos of her and she always wore s-such pretty outfits. I really like…” Draco’s pink tongue darted out to lick the end of his finger before he leafed through the magazine in front of him, “this one!” Draco announced happily, twisting the page so Harry could see a full spread of different outfits. They were all very sweet and elegant looking, with more lace and ruffles than Harry had expected.
The teenagers were on a beach somewhere, with Sirius leaning nonchalantly against a rock with his hands suspiciously hidden behind his back. The two girls were striking poses on the sand. One of the girls Draco didn’t recognise, although there was something strangely familiar about her face. She almost looked like Bellatrix, but her hair was lighter and her eyes the wrong colour.
“Mr. Potter,” she announced, her lips coming together in a thin line. “I would appreciate you coming with me.”
Harry nodded, feeling even more nervous than he had done earlier. “I wanted us to have a home, somewhere nice for Lyra to grow up and I thought you’d like this place. It’s got a Potions room and herb gardens and there’s a patio and plenty of fireplaces for floo connection. I’ve already got the paperwork ready to get us linked up to the Ministry and Padfoot’s and…” Harry trailed off.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut in concentration before opening them and finding that a large, frosted snowman had appeared beside Harry. It was nearly as tall as the alpha with a bright orange carrot nose and shining coal buttons.
“Yes,” Draco nodded, chewing on his lip, “I checked n-no one was around before I levitated my trunk in.”
Harry and some of the other older students were out helping Hagrid stable the pregnant thestrals away from the ravages of the thunderstorm. Draco winced as a particularly loud clash echoed across the landscape, rumbling like a Hebridean Black. He cast another tempus and chewed on his lip anxiously, Harry had left about an hour ago and Draco really hoped the alpha wasn’t still in the outskirts of the Forbidden Forest with the elements as they were.
“I find it difficult to get comfortable,” Draco admitted when Harry asked. “My back is aching a little.”
“Harry Potter!” Olive called out angrily as Draco hurriedly picked up a decorative woven blanket from the back of a nearby chair and covered himself with it.
“Would you like me to show you how it’s done?” Madam Pomfrey asked. “You’ve got such sensitive skin, I think it would be best if we could avoid using a pump as much as possible. Mr. Potter, unless you are going to be assisting young Draco with this, may I suggest you might wait outside?” Madam Pomfrey asked, looking questioningly up at Harry. “I am aware that as Draco’s legal alpha I cannot ask you to leave, however –“
“Why aren’t you eating?” Harry’s voice sounded deep and concerned. Draco wasn’t sure if the Great Hall had fallen silent again or not. He cracked open his eyes and peered up through his blond fringe to see the alpha staring down at him curiously.
“From you both huh?” Sirius gave his godson a pointed smirk as Harry’s face made a strange expression before glaring at the older man.
“Whatever,” Harry shrugged, “he’s obviously not suffering like I am if he made it to morning lectures.”
Draco was beautiful, delicately swollen with child, his paper white skin stretched thin over aristocratic angles. His sharp nose complimented his petite face and his ash grey eyes, although closer together and less doll like than most omegas, were intelligent and at times, even fierce. Harry thought of the graceful curve of Draco’s neck, the three freckles under his ear and how his hummingbird heart would beat a tattoo as the vein in his throat pulsed whenever Harry touched him. The way Draco’s blush would blossom like spring sakura, darkening to candied cherries as it spread across his chest, now puffy with the beginning of small breasts.
“I’m going to get off the bed and give you some space okay?” Harry clicked his tongue frustratedly, his inner alpha screaming at him that he was doing something wrong by moving away. Harry ignored it, not wanting to crowd Draco when he was this upset.
“This is an apprenticeship application,” Severus frowned curiously down at the papers, flicking through them with the tip of his wand. “For Potions?”
“Don’t tell her that,” Harry grinned, glad that Draco seemed more relaxed again. “Her ego’s already the size of a planet.”
“Look what you do to me, angel,” Harry whispered as Draco stared hungrily at Harry’s blood swollen prick. Harry’s shaft was pulsing and the veins stood out rigidly, leading up to his throbbing bulb, the foreskin already wrinkled down as the dark slit gaped and leaked precome. Harry let go of Draco’s delicate wrists, manoeuvring the omega round so as to bring his round bottom up to Harry’s face.
“I love it!” Draco exclaimed, laughing messily before blowing his nose again. “Harry is this really our home?”
Maybe Bellatrix was right, but Draco was fully prepared for being unwanted by everyone for the rest of his life, so long as he could keep his baby.
Draco stared at a small tube of tinted strawberry lip gloss that had fallen out of his Christmas Day cracker, before deciding to dab a little onto his lips using the tip of one finger. Draco stared at his reflection and couldn’t help but finally feel a little pleased with the result. He hurried out of the bedroom to where Sirius, Remus and Harry were waiting for him by the front door and tried not to let his face match his pinafore as both Harry and Remus gave him compliments.
“Right then, you’d best change out of those wet robes. I’ve got some joggers here along with a sweatshirt that I think will fit you."
“Thank you,” Draco nodded. He grabbed his nightgown out of the drawer before hurrying over to the ensuite bathroom. “I’m j-just going to change, don’t leave yet.”
That was what Ron had said whilst cracking open another beer. Harry glanced up to see Draco still staring at him, his lips open now and small, relieved breaths puffing into the air every time some more milk came out. But what if Harry didn’t want to confuse Draco? What if he just wanted the omega to be his, properly his?
Harry joined hands with Draco, guiding him across the floor as they waltzed to the music. Draco was clearly classical trained and Harry had to apologise a few times for nearly stepping on the omega’s toes. Draco, having ditched his heels, was now pale and barefooted as he swayed and twirled. Fairies hovered about with firefly lanterns and Harry laughed and nodded for Draco to look as Professor McGonagall attempted to do an ambitious spin with a rosy cheeked Arthur Weasley.
The waiter walked away as Harry leaned forwards to press a kiss on Draco’s cheek, “you’re going to need the energy,” he growled, low and promising as Draco’s gut flared with arousal.
“Oh, okay,” Draco said quietly, biting his lip on a pleased smile. He had never heard of an alpha helping an omega with their nest before. Providing scent for it sure, but to actually be bothered with the trivial details of making it? That was certainly not something Draco had imagined an alpha would concern themselves with.
“It’s okay,” Harry laughed, “I know what you’re trying to say. You’re right, it does seem a little unfair. Would you like me to take off my trousers?” He reached down to the drawstring of his bottoms whilst looking questioningly at Draco. Harry paused, not wanting to commit to anything without the omega’s express approval. It took a few moments before Draco licked his lips and nodded quickly.
“Ronald, I swear if I ever get pregnant you are not allowed within ten feet of the delivery room,” Harry could hear Hermione snap as he and Draco tried to suppress their giggles.
Merlin it was wrong, Harry knew it was wrong but he bit his lip hard as the moving picture of him fucking into Draco floated across his vision. Dream Draco’s mouth was wide open in a perfect circle as Harry held the omega’s thin wrists behind his back with a single dark hand. The omega’s own ivory skin would be shiny with sweat and his small pert breasts would be bouncing happily with Harry’s thrusts.
Harry moved back slightly so as to get a better view. Draco was kneeling, his head turned to one side submissively as he held his nightdress bunched up for Harry’s viewing pleasure. Below his swollen belly, Draco’s omega cock was stirring slightly from a nest of light blond curls. Little pink balls hung behind, the skin taut and shiny, pushed forwards by the meat of Draco’s thighs and the manner in which he was sitting.
“Well, look at that,” Harry said, beaming at Draco who couldn’t help but feel a little smug. The three of them carried onwards. When Harry noticed that Draco had lost a mitten, he carefully wrapped his hand around Draco’s bare one and pushed it into Harry’s warm pocket, holding them together there.
Draco stared at Harry for a moment before shyly replying, “and you’ll be a daddy,” under his breath.
Olive spent the next half an hour or so showing Draco all around the store, picking out various pieces and creating a teetering pile that bobbed along mid air behind them, eventually depositing itself in the curtained changing room on the second floor.
“P-Perhaps, if that’s what you want?” Draco replied. Harry knew he was going to have to push a little harder.
“Yes please,” Draco replied bashfully, however as Draco tried to twist towards the window to give Harry access, the omega let out a hiss of pain.
“Merlin yes, Draco,” Harry gasped as the omega moved away from Harry’s own ministrations and instead wriggled across the bed so that his face was inches from Harry’s prick. Harry looked down as Draco cautiously ran his index finger up the shaft, tracing the thickened vein. He glanced nervously up as if expecting Harry to tell him what to do but the older man smiled back, cupping his hand round Draco’s head and stroking his hair. Harry was more than happy to give Draco time to explore and figure it out at his own pace.
Draco squirmed slightly, he knew that Ginny Weasley would also be there on Boxing Day and whilst apparently there were no hard feelings between her and Harry, Draco couldn’t help but still feel a little uncomfortable around the fierce and accomplished woman.
“I mean,” Harry huffed, “it’s not meant to be like this is it? By the time an omega becomes pregnant you’re normally meant to already be close with them so stuff like this would come naturally. I feel like I’m cocking this up royally. When I tell Draco to eat more, he gets nauseous, when I don’t nag him, he loses too much weight. If I try to chaperone him everywhere I feel as if I’m acting like some sort of dominating alpha and scaring him, but when I let him go by himself…” Harry trailed off and looked miserably down at the sleeping boy. Draco’s fan of blond eyelashes were twitching as if he was dreaming about something. Harry could only hope it wasn’t a nightmare on top of everything else.
“If you want to borrow the Cobblet book from me, feel free,” Hermione told him, “I finished it over the summer.”
“Shall we put them out of their misery?” Harry whispered questioningly to Draco, who nodded before grabbing Harry’s hand.
“Oh my love,” Harry’s own tension bled away as he smiled at Draco, stroking his cheek, “don’t be. I’m here okay, I’m not going anywhere, I’ll be right by your side for everything.”
“Didn’t you have a meeting with Professor Tung?” Snape snapped, standing up and brushing himself down, two alarmed and chittering beetles falling out from the folds of his robes.
“Yes,” Draco nodded, “It’s a peacock.” Draco’s happiest memory had been of the first ever photograph Bellatrix had found of his mother. In it, Narcissa had been picnicking on a great lawn, laughing and surrounded by white peacocks. Draco glanced back to the mobile and sure enough, an elegant peacock was fanning out its tail right behind a large, shaggy dog.
“I’m just warning you!” Damien exclaimed indignantly as a few compartment doors slid open and people poked their heads out. “How do you know it’s even yours? Magical signatures can be faked!”
After his nightly cleansing and care spells, along with brushing his teeth and having changed, Draco exited the bathroom back into the comfortable warmth of the main suite.
“Oh I gave up on that long ago,” Remus replied breezily, “But Sirius has a nice bottom so I decided to put up with it.”
Draco sniffed and nodded, tipping himself forwards as much as he could into Katie’s warm hug. There was a knock on the door a moment later before Hermione poked her head round.
“Oh sweetheart,” Harry sighed with a sympathetic expression. It was the first time Harry had used such a term of endearment to refer to Draco, despite the women of Gaedere doing so regularly, and Draco bitterly regretted that he couldn’t even enjoy it.
“I believe I owe you an apology Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall stated over what Harry swore was her eighth cup of tea that morning. He figured though that the headmistress probably really needed it considering one of the omega students was pregnant on her watch.
Draco let out a shaky exhale of breath as he drew his hands away from his very miserable looking face.
spilled his soup and his legs got burned. Padma had just finished putting ointment on them when you decided that it was completely appropriate to barge into our non alpha dorm room unannounced.”
