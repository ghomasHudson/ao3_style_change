"Maybe you'll reconsider? About Polyjuice."
"I should write you down maybe? Don't pretend you don't know what I want to hear."
"Huh? No I'm not!"
"Hm? What part?" Harry put his legs wider, his cock standing at attention. "You were doing fine. I just asked to be more gentle."
Finally after another few times Draco grumbled with annoyance, "Would you stop doing that?!"
"It's just... It does not make any sense!"
"Yes, but not on literal paper."
"That wasn't what I meant. And stop calling me Potter!"
"Merlin, Potter, third time since morning!" he said with exasperation; his heart beating faster than it would've from just a short spry walk. "Can't you keep yourself in check even during lunch today?!"
"Nope. This hour is all blowjobs. And I haven't finished."
A minute later Draco stopped mid-stroke as he heard somebody walk into the bathroom. Then the door of the adjacent cubicle clicked shut and once again there was total silence. Just like in most places, all Ministry bathroom cubicles had a multitude of standard charms for increased comfort and privacy, including outgoing silencing charms that didn't let sounds out, only in. Draco huffed, not trying to be discreet. He absolutely hated to be disturbed while wanking. He needed peace of mind for that, and it was difficult as it was to be doing it in a stall of a public bathroom instead of the safety of his own home. There was an easy solution for that, but he never dared to cast two-way silencing charms fearing that it might interfere with the existing ones and trigger a cascading effect that might lead to all kinds of unforeseeable consequences; ever since the incident with his first Arithmancy project it was a phobia of his.
"I mean cheating." Harry looked at him aghast, to which Draco only smirked. "We become boyfriends, but you fuck however many women you want behind my back. It's going to be over if I find out. Naturally. But you still can try your luck."
The vision once again changed to fucking. Faux-Draco was precariously standing on the tiptoes of his right leg, face-to-face with faux-Harry, who held faux-Draco's other leg under its knee and with languid strokes gently thrust into him. Draco had not even known that anal sex was possible in such position before he saw it in Harry's mind. He still had doubts that it was manageable in real life. But it hardly mattered considering how hot it looked. Especially because their half-open moaning mouths were interlocked in a sloppy kiss.
Draco blushed as he was standing up. "Of course not!"
Harry lay down behind Draco and caressed his arm. "Come on, face the reality. You're into me."
"Thanks."
"Conventionally it's always snogging, then cuddling, then oral or sex."
"What my hair color has to do with anything?!"
The only thing that annoyed Draco a little was that Harry, as was not unusual for him to do while masturbating, seemingly was incapable of sticking to one thing and constantly switched scenarios. This time between fucking Draco and sucking him off. And, to his luck, for the first few minutes Draco was watching everything from a third person view. Masturbating to the visuals of fucking himself was weird no matter how many times he had seen it. Not that Draco never came to that though.
"I'm aware. But many would think that you're just a complete fruit like me no matter what you say. So when we're going to break up, it's going to be harder for you to -"
"Really."
Harry slowly stroked his cock and noticed that Draco was not moving - his arms still folded over his chest, but his cock was no less hard. Harry chuckled. "Not going to wank out of spite?"
"Stop you?" asked Draco confused.
A small smile didn't leave Harry's face throughout - he always found something incredibly erotic about shaving somebody like that, be that a man or a woman.
Draco grinned. "Did you just say that dicks don't discuss you? It looks like you already had too much."
Then he looked up with a smirk. "Still think blowjobs can't be hot?"
"More like how do I find somebody?"
"Wanna snog?"
With his pants gone, and his hard cock pointing straight into my face I grimace as I'm forced to raise back up. I should've started with the shirt, but sometimes I just forget about it and as if in a rush go straight for the pants. And the shirt obscuring the view grit on my nerves. A naked abdomen... No, naked everything is much better.
I want to sling my arms around him and mash my cheek right into his groin, to be somehow even closer to it, but I don't dare. It doesn't feel like it should be part of a blowjob, so as always I don't do it. Or Malfoy might think that this isn't what it is. And this is definitely only a blowjob.
At first Harry was surprised at how uncaring Draco was about wanking so openly, but then, after thinking it over, decided that there was no harm in it, and started joining from time to time if he felt like it.
After another few plunges which miraculously happen without gagging, I decide not to tempt fate more and return to the normal blowjob. I barely able to hold myself from looking up to see the expression on his face, to learn whether he liked it and appreciates my accomplishment. Or maybe he would just say it... No! Have I forgotten?! I hate his voice! Then instead maybe he can pet me at least? No! That would be to much familiarity! We aren't even friends. Stop-stop-stop! I don't need praise. I didn't come here for that. I'm having a cock in my mouth and that is enough. That's all I need.
"Don't be ridiculous. I meant reintegration into society. Harry wouldn't have gotten into a relationship with Draco if he didn't -"
"No! I meant that I'm only into women!"
"Really? Hm... Well, that still doesn't mean that you had a good blowjob. Want me to show you what a good one is?"
"Just because. I'd let you fuck me though," said Draco. Harry was taken aback. When Draco had said that he did not want to fuck him, Harry had thought it was the same thing like with the blowjobs at first. But they were way past that. After a drawn out silence between them Draco said, "You do fuck women though, so what's -"
"Yes."
Ron stopped muttering while pointing his wand at the stew and quickly hid his wand in the left sleeve the second Hermione walked back into the room.
"Because of my amazing blowjobs maybe?"
Draco felt his whole body becoming uncomfortably stiff as he understood the implications. Now he was not only not sure what exactly he said after the wank, but whether he said anything in the process of it that might have been even more incriminating and what other unbecoming sounds he might have unintentionally made. Second after second ticked by, underscored by his steadily increasing heartbeat thumping in his ears, as Draco did not dare to tear his eyes away from the sign and look at Harry. His mind feverishly worked on possible explanations with desperate hope that in the cubicle Harry had cast the conventional silencing charm that cut off sound in both directions and heard nothing before he came out.
Faux-Draco looked ashamed and said nothing, only nodded, to which faux-Harry gave an approving smile and gave the tip of his cock a playful kiss, signifying his forgiveness, which not necessarily meant acquiescence, and resumed stroking the shaft.
"With a close-up of the cock. Thanks. Just what I need."
So I open my mouth and slowly slide my lips over the glans. I like how the cock presses on my tongue. It doesn't differ much from the way I was sucking it with the foreskin covering the glans, but something about it is different. Maybe it's all in my head and the knowledge that this should feel much better for him, is what makes me think that. But in the end it doesn't matter - what is in my head is the only reality I have. I start to go back and forth, not even covering the first three inches. Knowing full well when to stop before the tip would touch the back of my mouth.
"No. I already said that. And that's a stupid thing to ask. Of course I'm going to say No irregardless of my intentions. I might be completely honest, or be a lying bastard. How would you know? We're both trained a bit in Occlumency, so even a statement under Veritaserum can't be trusted. Besides, I might think one way now and change my mind over time. Honestly, Harry, you are not a child. Why do I need to say all this self-evident crap?"
"Was just checking. Better safe than sorry," he mumbled.
"Yep. My brain does that sometimes when it comes to you, love."
Finally I feel satisfied with it and part my lips. But then stop. No, first with the tongue... I pull my tongue out and start to caress the glans with its tip. Barely touching it at first. I finally able to taste his precum. It spurs me on. But then I pull my tongue as far as possible, thought it isn't too different, and start swirling it around the cockhead. I wish I had a longer tongue. With my hand I pull on the shaft away from my mouth, making the ridge of skin holding the foreskin stretch and then start tickle it with my tongue. I hear the first indication that Malfoy likes it as he lets out barely perceptible slow exhale through his nose. I hope he's desperate for me to finally take it into my mouth. But I'll go on my pace. As always. So it's just incidental. I am, in fact, deciding that right now is the time.
"And don't forget that I want to see one of you blow the other," said Jane to Harry.
"You can at least eat her out. Maybe then -"
"That's not what -"
"- for you to talk to men. Heard it a hundred times already. For that case there are toys. Magical ones, I mean. They can do a pretty decent job on their own if you into that kind of thing. I never liked them though and rather just wank. I'm sure Hermione, like most witches, knows what's best. Ask her."
Harry snorted. "And who of us is the woman then?"
Maybe Malfoy would ask for me to..? No! I got what I came here for! I don't even want for him to suck me off. He probably isn't even good. Yes! Most likely he's lousy. But maybe he wants it, but embarrassed to ask me to help him learn? I'd be patient... And it's not like he has to exert himself with me being so damn horny. I'd be happy for just a handjob... Or even through my pants... No! What am I thinking again?! ... Not again! Those are DEFINITELY new thoughts. Very unlike-me ones. Probably because I didn't sleep well last night. Yes, that's the explanation.
With clean hands and dirty mind Draco stepped into the rightmost cubicle. He did not even remember when exactly he had stopped fighting himself and began to wank to Harry's fantasies completely guilt-free, replaying the ones that he liked most in his head, but it was a long while ago. In rare times it was not enough because never felt attracted to Harry the way he was to women, but it hardly mattered after having a fresh image from the ride in the lift. So there was no question as to what he would be imagining this time.
"I did not say anything," said Harry unfazed.
Draco's face got even redder as he with shame was staring at his semi-hard cock and he mumbled, "I'm not even bi!"
"Gimme," said Harry holding out his hand. Draco gave him the remote and Harry turned back to the channel Draco wanted to watch. "Mmm... They aren't even all that good-looking. The pair in a blowjob is way hotter." Harry switched back to the blowjob. "And besides, remember how two months ago you were happy to have a Playwizard with ten-seconds-long moving pictures?" Harry tried to imitate Draco's voice as he added, "And with no sound!"
"It does to me."
Jane looked up at Harry. "Is he in denial?"
"Pfff... What does it mean? Like I -"
"I'd miss sex! I mean real sex."
"No! Tomorrow might be late! Come on!" said Draco bursting with excitement and yanked the blanket off Harry. "This is something else! I'm telling you!"
"I like my muggle life," said Draco.
"Or is it enough for you when I swallow after blowjobs in the living room?"
With his cock in his hand Draco began visualizing what he saw Harry do with him in his imagination minutes prior as he felt the envy flare up. He knew he was being ridiculous, but he could not help himself but feel jealous of the version of Draco Malfoy that lived in Harry's fantasies. What he wanted the most was for that made-up version of himself to finally come out of the dream world. He wanted to merge with it. He did not want merely to keep watching the made-up Draco to be patted, caressed, and spoiled. He wanted to actually experience it. He craved to feel Harry's real, flesh and blood fingertips touching his skin. Overall Draco wanted to become Harry's secret boyfriend, or girlfriend, or whatever Harry wanted him to be. He had not just stopped minding seeing himself in girly clothes, but wanted to wear them for Harry. In his flat Draco had a narrow in type but extensive in variety assortment of clothes he saw himself wear in Harry's fantasies. A special wardrobe, magically warded, just in case somebody who came over decided to snoop, that was full of skirts, light sundresses, crop-tops, stockings, underwear, and other related miscellany. After each time Draco saw Harry imagine him in something new, he went straight into muggle London in search of that something and bought the most similar thing he could find. For years gradually expending the wardrobe. And, of course, sometimes wearing those clothes around the house; having stockings on Draco particularly liked.
"Huh? I know that cunts are not your thing. What that has to do with anything?"
"Yep," said Harry, who was no less inebriated. Harry released his own cock, though continued to play with Draco's. He stroked Draco's cheek with his knuckles and nodded towards the screen. "They are having so much fun, aren't they?"
"So that means that when you will have served your sentence and get your magic back, you'd give me one?"
Harry waved his hand dismissively.
"Just once... It's not like I'm asking you to tell me that you love me."
"Can we really do that?"
"Okay... Mmm... For instance, I don't even know what to say to them."
"Naturally."
When the fantasies were visual, Draco either had to watch everything from Harry's point of view, or saw both of them together as if they were on a stage and he and Harry, of course, were the only spectators. Actors and spectators at the same time. With Harry also being the director of those raunchy plays.
Harry didn't pull back and let Draco finish in his mouth. After seeing him cum so many times, he was a bit curious as to its taste. Which turned out to be not too bad. He pulled back from the cock and swallowed.
Harry shrugged. "That was the condition I was talking about, remember?"
"You want me gone?"
"I like it better," said Harry after switching the channel.
I'm not as much as sucking, as caressing the cock with my tongue and lips for several minutes without even touching it with my hand; both of my hands are holding his thighs. I'd rub his thighs as well, but I can't. Because he is Malfoy. And that would be too much.
"You only promise!"
"I didn't mean it like that. I know we're men, but I don't see myself, right? So it is different."
"But I am!"
"How do I do that?"
Their one-way connection was abruptly cut seconds later - Harry's climax always did that. As if the magic that sustained the transmission of thoughts was used up and had to recharge. And Draco once again was left one-on-one with himself.
Draco grinned. "Itty-bitty Potter is a bottom. What would people think..."
What Draco never could understand was why faux-Harry never let faux-Draco fuck him. Harry had pertaining fantasies about it, which were not exactly about fucking, but more about faux-Harry trying to persuade faux-Draco to fuck him, and faux-Draco refusing each time. Giving some ridiculous and evasive reasons or without any at all. Acting all capricious about it. Draco knew that Harry wanted to be fucked - he felt it. But it turned Harry more to watch faux-Draco refuse, turn around, presenting faux-Harry his bum, and ask faux-Harry to do him instead. As if imagining them temporarily switching roles would disrupt the established order of things after which there would be no going back. Not that Draco was miffed about it - those were Harry's fantasies, so he had every right to imagine whatever he pleased. But when Draco wanked on his own while thinking about Harry, he was not as strict about it and sometimes fantasied about reversing their roles. Especially he liked imagining fucking Harry while wearing at least something from his special wardrobe, which always made him giddy from the naughtiness of it.
The screen went black for a moment, and then the next clip started. Draco huffed.
"And don't forget to clean the dishes like yesterday." Draco motioned back to the lots of dirty pots and plates strewn all over the counter and sink area. "I'm not going to do it with my hands again when it costs you a wave of your wand. I'd rather go to Azkaban."
"And what is she then?"
"That bloke I saw you snogging with that night in the alley, what about him? You said you met him that very day. And with me you refuse to -"
"You do remember that several months in I did say that you may bring women as long as they are muggles, right? So you may bring him here."
"Thanks," said Draco. "This time I tried not to diverge from the recipe much. ... And we're out of eggs."
"Night."
Snape grabbed Harry by his shirt and slammed him against the wall. Not hard, but it had a similarly sobering effect as a slap a minute before. "I would've taken it from you by now if for not one crucial detail - it HAS to be given willingly!"
"I might've found a tiny bit of sense in all your nonsense when Draco was still on parole. He's a free wizard now. He did not leave Harry."
"Where is the famous Gryffindor courage? Don't you have any left?!" said Draco somewhat resentfully as he heard the sound of running water after Harry opened a tap, in full confidence that silencing charms wouldn't let it out of the cubicle; venting his frustration verbally always helped him more than seething silently. Even knowing that he had a tendency to blame an unchanging status quo on somebody else, Harry in this case, than on his own inaction, he could not help but continue in the same vein, "Why wouldn't you ask something already?! Fuck, Potter, Fuck!" He repeatedly hit the back of his head against the wall. With a dejected voice, believing that he was speaking into the void, he finished with, "I would do anything... Just ask... Ask, damn you to hell!"
"I just hope your Playwizard journals weren't discovered by muggles. You could've at least considered that muggles don't have something like that before throwing all of them into the garbage bin."
"Thanks, Malfoy," I mirror back. I know that me thanking him might make me seem needy, but I just can't not say it back after he thanks me. And I hope that it helps him to understand that I do it for myself, thus the thanking. He gave me a favor! Not the other way around.
Enough! I don't own this bathroom! Other people are allowed to use it any time they want! he scolded himself in his thoughts. Nobody knows that I'm wanking, so stop fretting! Even if they knew, there's nothing wrong with getting off like this! Besides, nobody's going to find out what I'm thinking about while I'm at it!
“Do they mean anything?” he asks, gesturing to his hands.
“None of your business,” retorts Malfoy.
“Not too far!” Harry shouts back. “Hold on!”
“Didn’t want to bring your man today?” Seamus jokes as he fixes a pink triangle pin to his shirt.
“I won’t answer!” But Harry’s words are lost to the whoosh of the flames.
“They’re nice, right?” she asks, softly so the Slytherins don’t hear.
“Not me!” Hermione protests. “The others, maybe. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. Didn’t want to give McGonagall a glimpse of what goes on during pub nights.”
Harry nods and mounts his broom, kicking off into the air. He’s flown a bit since the war, just with his friends in the Weasley’s backyard, but everytime he flies he remembers how much he loves it. He does a few laps around the park, relishing in the wind in his hair, the thrilling speed of a broomstick. Malfoy flies high above him, doing lazy circles in the air.
It’s a Thursday morning. Harry wakes at dawn, sleep disturbed by nightmares per usual. After tossing and turning for a while, unable to fall back asleep, he rises from his bed and putters around the kitchen, making coffee and deciding to take it up to the roof to watch the sunrise. It’s a beautiful morning, the day warming quickly as the sun peeks above the horizon and spreads brilliant yellows and oranges across the cloudless sky. He sips his coffee, ignoring the fact that it’s too hot as it scalds his throat on the way down, and then stomps back down to his flat and circles the main room no less than three times before deciding to go for a run to rid himself of his restless energy.
Ginny leans over to kiss Blaise. “This was lovely, good to see you Pansy, Malfoy. Let’s do this again soon.”
“Have you even ordered drinks yet?” Malfoy frowns and pushes in front of Harry, signaling to the girl working there. They order, and as they wait for their drinks, he eyes Harry. “What’s the matter with you?” he asks.
“I hope you’re insinuating that I’m wealthy and beautiful,” sniffs Malfoy, “and not the other thing.”
“Oh, god,” Malfoy groans, as if he’s just now seeing his flat through a stranger’s eyes. “It’s horrible. Let’s leave immediately, I can obliviate you and we can forget that you’ve seen I live in a pigsty.”
She sighs. “I know. I just...what else am I supposed to do?”
fault?” he frowns. “Tea?”
“Really? Where?” he replies, curious.
Reaching out a delicate hand, Malfoy picks up his drink and follows him back to the table. Harry picks his way through the crowd, trying not to spill any vodka soda on his jeans while processing their conversation to the best of his partially-tipsy abilities. Getting along with Malfoy? What an evening this was turning out to be.
He waits for Harry’s opinion. “Well? What did you think?” he prods.
“You’re crazy. Why don’t you just tell Blaise that you want an open relationship?” Harry reasons.
“You did
“It was on purpose,” says Harry indignantly. “I meant to.”
He nods. He feels a little anxious, sure, but mostly he’s excited to celebrate with his friends. Luna hugs him tightly, and then they step out the door. Seamus and Dean don’t live too far from downtown London, so there’s no need to take the Tube to get to the march. As they near Hyde Park, Harry sees countless other people coming from all directions on their way to Pride. His heart swells with the knowledge that there are so many other people like him out there. He’s thrilled to finally celebrate his sexuality with his community, to be out to the world. Nothing can compare to the feeling of liberation he feels as he sees the huge crowd, full of people covered in glitter and rainbows and carrying signs.
Harry grins. “You’re in for a treat. You have to watch the television series when you’re finished, it’s incredible.”
“Er, no,” he replies. “Sorry for just appearing like this actually, but I need to ask you…do you think I should move? Like, do you think that’s okay?”
And that is how Harry ends up riding his motorcycle across London with Malfoy clinging on tightly behind him as they zoom through yellow lights and turn sharp corners that give Harry such an adrenaline rush he thinks he might pass out.
Pansy sets down her wine, relieved to have a conversation opener. “Thanks, Potter. It was quite the ordeal, let me tell you. Once you’ve been through a war, exams seem absolutely pointless.”
The group meanders down the street to the nearest gay bar where they can drink and dance and celebrate. A whoosh of cold air greets Harry as he walks through the door, most welcome after spending hours in the sun. The bar is packed with people who’ve just come from Pride. Harry is quick to join the drinking and dancing; he and his friends throw themselves onto the dance floor and jump up and down to the music. He finds himself dancing with Ron and Pansy, quite the odd pairing indeed, but their energy is infectious and Harry can’t help but smile and smile and smile.
have a long day of learning how to fill out paperwork. And filing. Is that all interns are good for these days?” Hermione grimaces.
It must be because he is such a great prat
“I mean, I was just going to go home after this.”
“Nothing important,” Harry says. “Why don’t you debrief me on all the goings-on at the ball? Apparently it was quite the scene.”
Standing up, Malfoy grabs his book and straightens out his shirt. “Therapy, Potter. You should try it sometime.” He whisks out of the cafe, leaving Harry to gape at the spot he just was. In some ways, Malfoy is nowhere near the boy he knew at Hogwarts, and in other ways they are exactly the same. Trying to reconcile the two in his head, Harry also makes his way out of the cafe, deciding to drop his books off at home before exploring the rest of the neighborhood. He hopes he doesn’t run into Pansy Parkinson next while he’s doing his grocery shopping.
“You don’t want me to follow my dreams, Ron?” she says. “Even you have to admit you can’t compete with his eyebrows.”
“Why’d you host a big party then?” Malfoy asks, tapping ash off the end of a cigarette. He’s wearing his many rings again, and they glitter in the moonlight.
Malfoy studies him closely. After a long pause he says, “You’re not at all what I expected, Potter.”
“Poetry?” asks Malfoy, lying on the carpeted floor in front of the fireplace.
“No, that has six!” Harry laughs. “‘We are very high’?”
Malfoy scoffs. “Here? In this shop?”
“Hash browns!” Ron bellows, overhearing their conversation. Everyone sitting nearby looks over at them, startled by this outburst. Despite himself Harry bursts out laughing, and soon everyone at the table joins in. Hermione laughs so hard she snorts and tears are running out of her eyes. What a state they are all in, thinks Harry.
“I just…” he shakes his head. “It’s not that bad.” Malfoy fixes him with an incredulous look. “Okay, it’s pretty bad,” Harry says, amending his previous statement. “I’d pegged you for a neat freak, though. Especially considering how you dress and all that.”
“I’ve been depressed, Potter,” he snaps. “We don’t all have the energy to clean all the time.”
what you’d never forgive me for?” Malfoy shakes his head. “I must say, your priorities seem a bit warped, Potter.”
“I dunno,” Harry says. “Maybe.”
This doesn’t surprise Harry all that much, given Malfoy’s own words to him at the pub. “Did you know he was gay?” he asks.
Malfoy looks at him in confusion. “Lunch?” he says.
Turning on the coffee pot, he opens the junk drawer in his kitchen and rummages around for a pen. After finding two that don’t work he finally finds one that does, barely, and scribbles a note to Malfoy on a paper towel.
“It’s not a bad idea at all,” responds Luna. “I go to therapy.” She crosses her legs and leans back against the sofa.
in the family of things.”
“Goodness,” she says, peering through the back door to see what he could be up to. “You better go, Harry, I’ve never heard him yell like that.”
“Ugh.” Harry grimaces. “I forgot. And I don’t know how to ride one, so I might leave it here for a few days or something.”
Hermione responds carefully. “I think people understand that you’re having a hard time right now, and that having fun at a party isn’t always easy. But we did miss you after you left, Harry, no matter what you might think. This was your party after all.”
by Kurt Vonnegut. Muggle books have always been his comfort, and he’s glad there’s a bookshop around the corner stocked with classics. He curls up in bed and reads about fifty pages before his vision begins to go blurry and he falls asleep.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Whatever, Malfoy, you could at least say hello.”
A lightbulb goes off in Harry’s head. “No, I want waffles. Hermione, can we get waffles?”
“I’ll take that as a compliment,” he grins, standing up and stretching. “Let me know if you need any recommendations. I’m gonna check out the bookshop.” Harry pats Malfoy’s shoulder as he heads over to bus his coffee mug and plate before going into the adjoined bookstore.
“What would you get?” replies Harry.
“Hear, hear!” Dean says, raising his glass. “A toast to Kevin Richardson and his glorious eyebrows!”
“I see now where you got all your bruises from,” Malfoy mutters into Harry’s ear. He just grins as the light changes to green and they’re off again, approaching Big Ben as they cross the Thames.
“I just want you to be happy,” he says. “So, no, I’m not gonna talk you out of it.”
There once was a great prat named Malfoy
“And you didn’t?” she asks gently.
“You don’t have to leave,” Harry protests, but she ignores him.
over the prairies and the deep trees,
“I dunno,” Ginny answers. “But I like...want to hang out with her all the time. Like even when I’m with Blaise I just want to be spending time with Luna instead. Does that make me a terrible person?”
He wastes the rest of the afternoon lounging about, doing some tidying, and otherwise preoccupying himself with odd jobs around the house. Kreacher appears no less than four times to try and persuade Harry to let him do the cleaning.
“Obvious to everyone except me, apparently,” mutters Harry. “He got a nose piercing too.”
“Nah. He’s not thrilled about it, obviously, but I think his pride is more wounded than anything. I don’t think he’s ever been dumped before,” Malfoy muses.
“Were you not taught how to eat properly?” Malfoy scoffs as a chunk of tomato slips out of Harry’s sandwich.
Harry can spend hours in bookstores. He loves perusing the shelves, talking to the employees about their favorite picks, exploring genres he loves and ones he barely reads, and just the comfort of the quiet atmosphere filled with people who share the same interests as he. Today is no different, and Harry is so engrossed in the selection of used and antique books that he loses track of time and emerges from the shop almost two hours later and several galleons poorer.
He swings open the door to find that the only people left are Ron and Hermione, who are in the process of vanishing empty bottles of alcohol and cleaning the kitchen. They look up as he and Malfoy enter.
“Shut up,” he says around a huge mouthful. Malfoy looks pained as Harry talks with his mouth full, and he can tell it takes him an enormous amount of effort not to comment on it. Harry tries to suppress a grin. “Are we almost there? I’m tired.”
A bell tinkles as he enters the café, and he’s immediately greeted with the comforting smell of coffee and old books. Harry smiles at the curly-haired witch who’s working at the register. “A small coffee, please,” he says, counting out the knuts and sickles. “Oh, and a Danish pastry too, thanks.”
Malfoy soon joins him on the ground. “You’re crazy,” he declares.
“Yeah. I guess. After fighting a war, chasing so-called bad guys didn’t seem that appealing all of a sudden.” Harry tears his eyes away from Malfoy’s to stare at the concrete below him, feeling more sober than he’d like for this conversation. He traces a shape in the dust with his finger, remembering his decision not to return to Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione had been so excited to rebuild their lives, start careers that weren’t dedicated to chasing Voldemort for a change, but Harry never shared their enthusiasm. On the last day they could sign up for their NEWTS, he had gone to McGonagall and withdrawn his application. A screaming match with Ron and Hermione had ensued, but they’d understood Harry’s decision with relatively little explaining. Their world had just shattered – it wasn’t going to be that easy to pick up the pieces.
“Sorry,” Harry shrugs. “Look, you do enough around here. You can finish up when I leave and go to Molly and Arthur’s, okay?” Kreacher shoots him a foul look and disappears with a crack. Sighing, Harry finishes making his bed and checks the time. Nearly 5:15. Satisfied that he won’t be the first person there, Harry apparates to the Burrow.
for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.
She chuckles, letting him out of the booth. “It’s your turn this time, just put it on my tab. Oh, and can you get me a vodka soda?” she calls as he heads to the bar.
Harry nods. “No problem. Er, I’ll go grab something for you to wear. The bathroom is just next to the kitchen.”
“Still. Everyone was talking about how much you contributed. I just thought you should know.”
They squish together on the sofa to watch the movie but end up talking over it half the time. He doesn’t quite know how the conversation turns from Notting Hill to his party from last night, but around a mouthful of Chubby Hubby, she says, “I noticed Malfoy was at your party yesterday.”
“I won,” Harry answers gleefully, propping himself up on his elbows.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s not Celestina Warbeck, is it?” Harry grins.
As if Dean’s conjured them into existence, Ron steps out of the Floo, Hermione following close behind. He whistles when he sees their decorations. “Very festive,” Ron says, nodding approvingly. “Hope we’re not too late.”
“Ah, yes, I thought you might bring that up. As it happens,” replies Ginny, “we got to talking during the ball. Not about anything in particular, he asked how quidditch was going, apparently he loves the Holyhead Harpies. And we talked about the castle and the restorations. Blaise’s been very involved with children who lost their parents during the war, which, I mean, good for him. But mostly just life in general. He really is a charming man. And hung like a—”
Secondly, Pride has become increasingly capitalist, where we cheer for huge corporations that don’t give a shit about our rights. Why do you need that rainbow pin to show that you’re queer? You don’t. And to make matters worse, the rainbow flag was created by Gilbert Baker, who was in the U.S. Army.” Malfoy angrily gestures around him. “Pride isn’t a fucking party. We’re still fighting for the right to
Tempted as he is to ask what exactly that means, Harry decides not to press the matter. Instead he leans his head against the railing and gazes up at the sky, wishing they could see the stars. Now that he lives in London, the sky is never clear at night, and often Harry finds himself longing for Hogwarts and the quiet countryside.
“Er, thanks,” Harry replies. He thinks he did an adequate job of dressing himself. Seamus hands Harry a beer and ushers him into the kitchen, where Ginny and Luna are decked out in lots of beads and singing to ABBA at the top of their lungs.
No one has any better ideas and so they meander to Ginny’s flat. Harry’s allowed to lead the group, even though he doesn’t really know where he’s going, and so he walks a couple feet in front of everyone, drunkenly enjoying the summer night. His head is no longer spinning and he’s now able to appreciate the beauty of London at night as he half-listens to his friends talk about something absolutely ridiculous. A wave of nostalgia hits him; he’s been through a war and came back from the dead and here he is, celebrating Pride with people he would never expect to be friends with. Nothing could be better than this moment.
“Potter, what a surprise,” he replies, setting down the book he’d been reading. “Didn’t expect to see you this morning.”
“Potter,” Malfoy snaps. Harry’s attention comes back to the present moment and he takes a few deep breaths to calm himself, reaching for his bottle of water. Once he feels more steady, he meets Malfoy’s eyes. “It’s fine,” Malfoy says flatly. “I’ve forgiven you for everything a long time ago.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “Get over it, you’re already wet.”
The book is lying on the sofa; Harry tosses it to him and joins him on the ground, lying on his back beside Malfoy, who opens the book and rolls over on his stomach so it’s easier to read.
Harry laughs and rises from the floor to grab a pint of ice cream from the freezer. “I’m rather partial to Hugh Grant myself.”
“I haven’t broken up with him
Climbing to his feet, Arthur casts a quick cleaning charm and the grease disappears from his hands and face. He puts a gentle hand on Harry’s shoulder. “I insist, my boy. It’s rightly yours. Thank you for letting me play around with it.”
“Oi!” yelps Harry. “That hurt!”
“Of course not. You can’t control how you feel,” he says gently.
“Come on,” Malfoy insists. “I can come up with one right now, ready? A haiku.” He clears his throat for dramatic effect and Harry rolls his eyes.
She nods and shortly returns with two enormous shot glasses. “Cheers,” Malfoy says, picking up his whiskey. Harry does the same, and after clinking it against Malfoy’s, throws his head back and downs the whole thing. He winces as it sears the back of his throat, but the warm feeling that it leaves in his stomach is most welcome. He’ll need it, if he’s to face the rest of the night with a smile on his face.
“Oh, yes please,” she sighs. “As I was saying, it’s your fault. This started at your stupid housewarming party that you weren’t even there for, because you invited Luna and I hadn’t seen her since school. We used to be so close, I don’t know what happened, and we just were talking the whole time, and we’ve been seeing each other a lot since then.”
Harry waves awkwardly to Pansy and Malfoy, the latter of whom crooks an elegant eyebrow and takes a sip of his drink, before following Ginny as she sweeps out of the bar. They emerge onto a crowded street full of people hurrying past the small pub on their way home from work. The setting sun casts a golden light over all the buildings and as dusk approaches, London is no longer sweltering hot.
Malfoy reaches out a hand and Harry helps him up. “This was surprisingly fun, Potter.”
“Oh.” Harry’s a bit thrown off. He thought they were having a good time, despite the intense conversation they’ve just had in the middle of it, and anyway he doesn’t want to go home just yet. There’s nothing for him to do there; he’d probably just end up sitting in bed and wasting the rest of the day away doing nothing productive. “Well, I still haven’t seen your flat,” he points out.
Ginny nods. “Thanks.” She turns away to head back into the living room but, thinking of something else, addresses Harry again. “Also, how are you gonna get that bloody motorcycle home? Ride it?”
The month of May passes with little fanfare. Harry spends it cleaning Grimmauld Place, to Kreacher’s immense distaste, sleeping, and learning to cook things other than eggs. But mostly, he goes to bed early and wakes up late, eats very little, and tries to get out of the house a couple times a week to see his friends. Now that NEWT results have arrived, most of them are busy applying for jobs and internships. Ron has started Auror training, and Hermione has been welcomed to St. Mungo’s as an intern in the Spell Damage ward. Both of their hours are long and whenever Harry sees the pair, they’re exhausted. Ginny has received her official welcome to the Holyhead Harpies, so now even she’s wrapped up with practice and constant travel. Harry’s tired too, all the time, though he doesn’t have a reason for it. Sure, his sleep has been interrupted by nightmares practically every night, but he feels like it’s not really an excuse.
“Fine! Fine, Potter. You’re a terror, truly. I don’t understand how someone can be as stubborn as you are.” Malfoy looks extremely displeased, but Harry’s thrilled.
Ginny grins. “It’s a deal.”
“This one’s called ‘Wild Geese’,” says Malfoy, and begins the poem. His voice is soft and a bit rough and Harry is soon lost in the world that Mary Oliver spins.
“Big Austen fan?” he asks, plunking down his own coffee cup and taking the comfy armchair next to Malfoy’s.
“Thanks for cleaning everything,” Harry says to them, feeling a bit guilty that his friends had done all the work. “You really didn’t have to, you know."
He takes a few steps onto the roof before glimpsing another figure standing by the railing. The figure turns around and despite the dim light, Harry can see that it’s Malfoy. The wind is whipping his blond hair around his face, and he’s wearing the same black shirt he was wearing at the pub that first night, but his sleeves are rolled up to his elbows and he looks significantly more relaxed than Harry’s ever seen him.
“Merlin, Malfoy,” Harry says in wonder. His flat is actually gorgeous, it’s at the top of an old Victorian building and half of the walls are red brick, extending meters above Harry’s head before meeting a pointed ceiling. There is a huge fireplace in the middle of the wall and above it the mantle is packed full of books. Not to mention the dark mahogany bookshelves that line the walls, going all the way up to the ceiling. But Harry will admit, it’s a mess. There’s a laundry bin on top of the kitchen table, clothes spilling out of it and onto the floor. The kitchen looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in a week, dirty dishes and mugs stacked precariously in the sink. Books and papers and dirty napkins are strewn across the glass coffee table, blankets piled up on the couch, shoes everywhere, half-empty teacups sit on the floor in front of the sofa, and what looks suspiciously like muddy footprints trailing towards a closed door that Harry can only assume is the bedroom.
Yawning, despite the early hour, Harry pokes Ginny in the side. “Might get going,” he mumbles.
? I have so many questions.”
Hermione drains the rest of her wine. “Staying for dinner? It’s Ron’s turn to cook.”
They’re almost at the Globe Theater when the first raindrop falls. The sky’s been overcast all day, but it’s London and so it’s usually grey — Harry hadn’t thought anything of it. He realizes just how bad his mistake was when the sky opens and rain begins pouring down.
“Pansy’s girlfriend?” Seamus asks gleefully. “That’s news to me.”
“Did you have a good time?” asks Ginny anxiously before they’ve even taken two steps.
“Whatever you say, mate,” Ron says sagely. “Honestly, that explains why he’s been so tolerable these days.”
Harry pulls on a pair of shorts and sneakers, not bothering to change out of the t-shirt he wore to bed, and steps out the door. He breaks into a run once he’s on the street, enjoying the fresh morning air and the birds chirping in the trees. Though he doesn’t usually run he’s not unfit, and so over forty-five minutes later he ends back up at his house, out of breath and sweaty.
Before he can pick up the tray of drinks and bring it back to their booth, Malfoy stops him with a hand on his shoulder. “I’m going to say this to you only once,” he says in that soft, rough voice. “I’ll be the first to admit that I was a posh git when we were at Hogwarts. But after the war, the Slytherins fought hard to prove that we learned and changed, that we’re worthy of redemption, and everyone else seemed to agree that ideological rifts – whether that be between houses, muggle-borns and purebloods, what have you – only do damage.”
He shrugs. “Dunno. Soon, I hope.”
“Is that what you’re wearing to the pub?” Harry asks, eyeing her sweaty uniform.
Esmerelda returns an hour later with Malfoy’s reply.
“I have to confess something,” she says as ‘I Want it That Way’ comes on. “I have a huge crush on Kevin Richardson and would 100% break up with Ron for him.”
“I think
“Thanks for telling me earlier,” Harry says sarcastically. “I’m gonna take a seat.” He sinks to the ground, resting his back against the railing. It’s not particularly comfortable, but he’s not really in a state to notice.
“I have two things to say to that,” Malfoy answers. “Firstly, I’m glad political marches aren’t a necessity and that it’s easier for people to be openly queer. But people forget we owe our rights to the black, trans women that started the Stonewall riots and heralded change. Look at these police officers here to protect us! Cops were the ones who raided queer spaces in the 1960s and beat us and threw us in jail.
“Almost where?” grouses Malfoy. “I told you, we aren't going to my place.”
He groans and extracts himself from the blanket that he’s somehow sharing with Malfoy, who is fast asleep next to him. Harry glances around. Ron and Hermione are passed out on the sofa, Dean’s sleeping in the armchair with his neck tilted at an unnatural angle, and Seamus is lying on the carpet with a sweatshirt balled up under his head as a pillow. Harry can only guess that Ginny and Luna have managed to make it to the bedroom.
The rain has completely stopped but both of them are soaking wet. Harry pulls off his helmet and shakes his head, spraying Malfoy with water droplets.
“Ginny, am I a terrible friend?” he’d ask.
He nods. “It sounds like you’ve kind of decided what you’re going to do, then.”
“Is he really that upset?”
Ron shrugs. “I thought it was pretty chill. Loads of people showed up, I’d forgotten about most of them to be honest. Talked with Luna some, we definitely have to invite her over sometime. But everyone else ‘Mione and I have seen recently cause of our NEWTS.”
Harry stares at the note for a couple minutes. The letter is both formal and informal at the same time, but so typically Malfoy. When Harry asked him to play Quidditch he didn’t really think he’d agree. That, and the fact that seeing Malfoy’s full name written out like that is very strange. Harry blinks several times, reading over the signature again.
“Adam,” the stranger replies. He’s rather cute, tall with dusty brown hair and lots of freckles splashed across his nose and cheeks.
“I think they’re perfectly in line, thank you very much,” he mumbles around another mouthful.
Harry laughs. “Paper’s easier to carry than literal gold coins,” he points out. “But I agree. Seamus and Dean were talking earlier about how Pride has been turned into a carnival rather than the political march it used to be.”
“You’re such a prat,” Harry says, looking over at him, and this is just enough to give Malfoy an edge and with a burst of speed he reaches forward and catches the Snitch.
“Thanks,” she replies, taking his arm and leading them down the street. “Really, thank you for coming to meet them all.”
Malfoy gasps. “Betrayal! New friends, is what I need.”
“I don’t even know your name,” he says.
Malfoy shakes his head. “No, I’m done making excuses. I had a privileged childhood and was raised by two parents who loved me and had basically everything I ever wanted and I
“What a mighty high compliment, Potter,” he replies wryly. “That must have really cost you.”
“Like five minutes,” replies Ron. “Just waiting for Luna and Ginny to get back from the bathroom.”
“Leaving?” he asks.
Harry trudges down the narrow staircase to the kitchen, where he makes himself a cup of coffee and scrounges around for something to eat. He decides to whip up a couple of eggs, and after eating them out of the pan in front of the sink, he heads back upstairs to shower and find something acceptable to wear.
Once upstairs, Harry grabs a couple of towels from the linen closet and tosses one to Malfoy. “You can shower first,” he offers. “Do you need to borrow some clothes?”
“Tired after a long day of doing nothing?” sneers Malfoy.
“Bit loud downstairs,” replies Harry. “Was starting to get a headache. Crowds, and all that.”
Ginny shrugs. “Nah, you had other things going on. He was in your year, and full disclosure – you might be seeing him around. I’m just warning you in advance.”
In response to this, Malfoy rips up a handful of grass and chucks it at Harry’s face. It lands on Harry’s shirt and he brushes it away, still laughing. “Let’s go again,” he suggests. “I brought a Snitch, if you want.”
After a delicious Molly Weasley meal, Ginny accosts Harry in the kitchen as he clears his plate.
Harry lets out a great sigh. “That is so unfortunate. Let me try again.” He clears his throat, earning a nasty look. Laughing, he begins his limerick.
Taking a drag, Harry hands it back to Malfoy. “To answer your question,” he says, “My friends thought it would be a good idea. I didn’t realize how many people they were inviting until they all showed up.” He makes a face.
“He jokes now,” quips Harry. “For your information, I’ve always loved to read. Not Hermione-level dedication or anything, but I wasn’t allowed to do much else when I was at my aunt and uncle’s and I kind of fell back into it this year.”
At a red light, Harry looks back to check if Malfoy’s doing okay. Beneath his helmet, Harry can make out a wide smile on his face. A giddiness from riding in a downpour has hit Harry as well, and he can’t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of their situation. Malfoy hears him and starts laughing too, and Harry’s heart swells up a bit, at the sound, at the summer rain, at the fact that not twenty minutes later the clouds are breaking and the sun begins to shine.
thanks for reading! this chapter is absolutely so stupid but i hope u got something out of it anyway lol
“Been thinking about getting some tattoos, what do you think?” asks Malfoy idly, examining himself in the mirror.
“You’re so dramatic.” Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Also, I don’t think you understand. I really haven’t cleaned it in a while.”
Before he leaves the flat, Harry owls Ginny back, knowing she’ll be pleased that it was her suggestion that worked out in the end.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Yes, I’m aware. I’m sure I was greatly missed. I just forgot you were there.”
Harry leans back in his chair. “Good on you, mate,” he says, for lack of anything better. Letting out a huge yawn, he scoots his chair back and stands up, stretching. “ Not gonna lie, I’m getting pretty tired.”
“He’s really changed,” agrees Luna. “He apologized to me for what happened at the Manor during the war. It was very kind of him.”
Harry excuses himself for a quick bathroom break and to grab some water, and when he emerges it’s impossible to push his way through the crowd back to his friends. Giving up, he ends up dancing with a group of random strangers who welcome him into their little circle.
are moving across the landscapes,
“Better,” she says, stepping back to admire her handiwork. “Are you ready?”
She laughs. “See you around, Harry. Thanks for breakfast.”
“I know,” Malfoy says, sounding immensely pleased. “Nothing rhymes with Draco either. Now you can’t write a nasty poem about me.”
He shrugs and stabs at the remains of his curry with a fork. “I dunno. Maybe.” Luna waits patiently as he struggles to articulate his thoughts. “I just think that everyone was able to grieve right after the war, like when we were going to everyone’s funerals, they properly got out their emotions.”
“Harry!” Ginny yells. He jumps, spilling his tea all over his lap.
Malfoy sneers. At this point, Harry thinks that sneering is just his automatic reaction whenever anyone says anything to him, because seconds later Malfoy looks much more pleasant and is responding to his question.
!” cries Harry. “Dementors? Really?”
, it reads,
“Sirius would want you to do whatever will make you happy,” she responds gently.
“What did you do?” Harry asks.
“Draco,” Pansy chides, but somehow Harry isn’t all that offended. Malfoy’s comment didn’t have any edge to it; it seemed like something he said out of habit rather than something he actually meant to be insulting.
“Is that a threat?” Malfoy cuts his eyes at him. “Anyway, I’m sure I’ll see you soon, I’ll give you back your clothes then. And watch out for a call from Blaise,” he says before stepping into the Floo.
To Harry’s immense surprise, Malfoy laughs. It’s not a fake laugh either, it’s a genuine chuckle that Harry would have never expected to hear come out of his mouth. “You horrible woman,” he says. “And you, Blaise, really? Leaving us alone with poor Potter the second you arrived? Horrible, both of you.”
“I like her
“You do not have to be good.
He leans over to examine the menu in Harry’s hands, and Harry can feel his body heat through his thin cotton shirt. Malfoy must be equally as drunk as he is because he squints at the menu for far too long before answering. “Yes, they have hash browns,” he replies.
going to my flat,” insists Malfoy. “We can get sandwiches, though.”
“Oh, good,” he responds. “I’ll just tell Blaise to firecall you with all his complaints then, shall I?”
“Aha! You three couldn’t hold off on talking about me for five minutes.” She doesn’t sound upset in the slightest. “You missed out on a fun night Harry, you should have been there.”
“You did save my life too,” Malfoy replies softly. “Don’t think I’ve forgotten -- the last time we flew together was when you saved me from the Room of Requirement. That’s why I was a bit surprised that you asked me, of all people, to play Quidditch today.”
“I owe you? For what?” Harry says, indignant. “And I’m always nice.”
Shortly, Ginny emerges barefoot into the living room, squeezing her wet hair with a towel.
Harry laughs. “Okay, Ron is actually not that judgmental and you know it. But sure, wanna come to mine?”
“It’s not,” replies Malfoy.
Harry laughs. “If you had dropped the bowl I never would have forgiven you.”
Harry groans. “Okay, let’s see. How about,
“And you deserved it,” he says pointedly. “I won that fair and square.”
He returns with a soft t-shirt and a pair of old jeans that hopefully won’t offend Malfoy too much, and knocks softly on the bathroom door. The shower is on but Malfoy opens the door, wearing nothing but his trousers. Harry gulps as he catches a glimpse of the pale scars across his chest. He knows they already had this conversation, but still --
“You’re horrible at this game,” he taunts after they reach the ground, waving the Snitch in front of Harry’s face. Harry makes a grab for it but the Snitch is just out of reach and he ends up knocking both of them over onto the grass. Harry feels a bit bad for assaulting Malfoy like this, but needs must. After a brief scuffle he emerges with the Snitch and holds it out so Malfoy can’t snatch it back.
“I’m not sure that’s exactly how it worked,” replies Harry. “Also, don’t think I have the talent.”
“Do you smoke a lot?” Harry asks, changing the subject. He’s genuinely curious, now wondering if he was high that first time they met at the pub.
Malfoy, standing in the doorway, clears his throat; Harry had forgotten that he was still there. “I’ll leave you to it,” he says, nodding to the trio. “Have a good night.” Harry watches as he shuts the door gently behind him. After he leaves, Hermione lets out a little laugh.
Harry blows on the chili before taking a bite. “Delicious as always,” he declares with his mouth full. “Doesn’t need a thing.”
He smirks. “Want a hit, Potter?”
Harry raises an eyebrow. Grinning, he says, “Got a little rowdy, did you?”
“And I will definitely not miss Walburga,” Ron puts in. “TRAITORS AND FILTH!”
Luna scoots closer to Harry and wraps her arms around him, leaning her head on his shoulder. “There’s no proper way to grieve. Just because you didn’t cry doesn’t mean you’re broken. And you’re allowed to take as much time as you need to process.”
“Malfoy?” he asks, heading over. Malfoy’s head whips up, startled.
Astoria nods. “I don’t think either of them are based in magical theory.”
“For the record,” he’s saying, “this is the first book by her I’ve ever read.”
Ron nods, satisfied by this answer, and returns to his milkshake. The other table finishes their meal before Harry’s table does, and after they’ve paid the bill, Ginny, Dean, Seamus, Pansy, and Astoria all squeeze into their booth despite the fact that there is no room for them. Ron squishes Harry against Malfoy, who’s pinned to the corner of the bench.
“Me too,” replies Luna. “Do you get nightmares? I can’t sleep through a full night anymore.”
Harry’s throat closes up. He manages to croak out a response before fleeing the bathroom, leaving Malfoy to shower in peace. The image of the crisscrossing scars, Dark Mark on his forearm, septum piercing, rings piled on the edge of the sink will probably be burned into the back of Harry’s mind for the rest of his days.
Five minutes later the music is once again blasting on full volume, but this time it’s the Backstreet Boys. Hermione knows every single word to ‘All I Have to Give’, and when the song finishes everyone gives her a round of applause.
“Well, I do live here now,” Harry answers.
Malfoy plops down beside him, sighing. “Fuck. You’ll never be able to look at me the same, Potter. Just when I thought I managed to convince you that I was the superior one.”
Making his way into the backyard, Harry encounters Arthur lying underneath Sirius’s old motorbike. “Decided to have a go at fixing the old thing, huh?” He asks wryly, taking another bite of chili.
“Wouldn’t miss it,” replies Harry. Grimacing, he adds, “Thank you both so much for coming, again. Sorry I was missing for most of it. D’you think people minded?”
In the night he would piss in his bed
Harry walks over to his new motorcycle and runs his finger down the smooth handlebars. “We’ll figure something out,” he says, but he’s a bit distracted thinking about Sirius riding the bike when he was young, gleeful, wind tangling his long black hair. Arthur seems to understand his introspection and leaves Harry to it, heading back inside to help Molly with dinner. Harry allows himself to stare at his motorcycle for a couple more minutes, just missing Sirius and his father and Lupin, until he shakes himself free from the nostalgia and rejoins the party.
the mountains and the rivers.
“Do you want to go get lunch?” he asks after taking a long drink from his water bottle.
“Don’t hurt yourself,” Malfoy says as Harry tips the contents of the pan into a bowl. Harry hands it to him, along with a serving spoon, and they sit at the table to enjoy the meal.
. Harry knows if he stays he’ll fall asleep right here on the carpet, and so with massive effort he hoists himself to his feet. Malfoy eyes him, not moving from the carpet.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
“Should we go back in?” asks Malfoy, sounding reluctant.
, and when he sees this, Harry has no choice but to make fun of him.
They sit in silence for a little while, just remembering. The Malfoy that Harry knows now is so completely different from the Malfoy he knew in school that he’s managed to separate the two into separate beings: one that Harry’s grown to enjoy quite a lot, and one who he literally sliced open because he hated him so much. It’s not unlike Harry’s own perception of himself. There’s pre-death Harry and post-death Harry, and he can’t imagine how they could ever be the same person. He doesn’t really recognize himself anymore, if he’s being honest. Who was that boy he once knew?
Ginny shoves his shoulder affectionately. “Thanks. Dummy.”
are heading home again.
Harry doesn’t reply, just lets her words sink in. He knows it will take a while to believe them, but she’s right. There is no correct way to process everything that’s happened in his life. Or, the way he’s doing it is the right way, at least for him. They sit on the floor like that for a while, intertwined, among several takeaway containers holding the last uneaten bits of their food. After a while Harry extracts himself and reaches for the television remote.
“Speak for yourself,” Pansy says. “I was having a very nice conversation with Potter, until Draco started trying to rile him up.”
Harry rubs his eyes. “I’m really sorry. I guess we’ve both been massively shitty people. I-- I wish I could take it all back, just so you know.”
Taking a sip of his coffee, Harry rolls his eyes. “You know what I mean.” He pulls a chair up to the table and takes a seat, munching thoughtfully on his pastry. Noticing something different about Malfoy, he frowns. “Hey, what’d you do to your face?”
“Let me out, Potter is suffocating me,” Malfoy whines, but no one except Harry hears him over the loud conversation and he’s forced to drop the matter. After several very uncomfortable minutes of Malfoy’s bony elbows digging into Harry’s side, they finish up, pay the check, and exit the diner.
“Great!” he enthuses. “Really, I’m sure you’re making it out to be much worse than it is. You, messy? I doubt it.”
Malfoy snorts. “How’s that for alliteration. In that case, I’ve got a question for you -- why didn’t you get your NEWTS with the rest of the Gryffindors?”
The next day, Harry gets out of bed at one pm. He’s not quite sure why, seeing as he went to bed at a reasonable time the night before; maybe it had something to do with the fact that he was tossing and turning until the early hours of the morning. He probably shouldn’t have lit a fire in May, it’s way too warm in his house for that. And to be fair, he had woken up before noon, but his bed was just so comfortable that he couldn’t muster the energy to get up for an hour or so. It’s not like he has anywhere else to be except the Weasley’s at five pm.
“Well, now he and I have another thing to bond over,” jokes Harry.
“It’s nice up here,” Malfoy says as he comes nearer.
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
“I’d hardly call myself a stranger, Potter.” Malfoy levels his grey eyes at Harry. From somewhere behind them sounds the clink of several drinks being placed on the counter. Before the bartender can leave, Malfoy tears his piercing gaze away from Harry and stops her. “And two shots of firewhiskey. Please.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He doesn’t remember ordering but he must have because what seems like only seconds later, the waitress places a glorious waffle in front of him. Harry digs in, and it’s the most delicious thing he’s ever eaten. Next to him, Ron is slurping happily on his chocolate milkshake. Even Malfoy has indulged himself and is eating a huge stack of pancakes drenched in maple syrup.
She shoots them a mischievous smile as she skips away to help George with the plates. “Are you three helping with dinner or not?”
As it nears seven o’clock, Harry is beginning to curse himself for not having a hard out. His stomach is growling, and at this point it’s just Blaise, Ginny, and Pansy having a loud conversation as he listens. Malfoy adds a sarcastic comment every now and again, but for the most part seems off in his own little world. Harry was hoping that he and Ginny would have some time alone to actually catch up, but it doesn’t seem likely.
Malfoy hits him. “Shut up, you know it’s amazing. And no, it definitely has five.”
“I dunno.” Harry takes a seat, squishing between his two best friends. “I’ve barely thought about it. It’s just too dark in Grimmauld Place. And damp. And old. But I feel like…d’ you think Sirius would be okay with it? Me selling his house?”
“Just shrink it,” George says, overhearing their conversation as he walks into the room to grab a slice of the sourdough bread Angelia brought over. “It’s Muggle so it probably won’t harm the engine.”
Arthur smiles. “Shall we head inside? Hopefully the rest of my children have arrived by now. You’d think at least one of them would have a watch…”
“Sorry, didn’t realize anyone was out here,” Harry says.
want to play Quidditch with you,” he says hastily. “But I mean yes, all my other friends are busy.”
Harry cuts his eyes at him. “We’ll see about that.” They stop at a deli at the end of the block and order two massive club sandwiches that take forever to arrive. They eat them on the walk home, and Harry ends up dropping half of his fillings on the sidewalk.
Malfoy smirks. “Thank you, Finnigan, I’ll take that as a compliment.”
As soon as Harry steps into the apartment, he knows it’s the one. He’s quite surprised that it only took a day and not even a dozen flats to decide on the perfect one for him, but as he gazes around at the big windows, brick walls, and modern kitchen, Harry can’t imagine looking for anything else. He signs the lease that night, excited to be out of Grimmauld Place as soon as possible.
“Takes one to know one,” grumbles Harry. “Do you want ice cream?”
“Yes,” Ron agrees. “I want a milkshake. Please Hermione, can we get milkshakes?”
“Is it weird for you that we’re best friends even though we dated?”
Laughing, Ginny agrees. “Yes, please. Oh hey, I hear you’re moving! Finally! You have to let me help you find a place.”
“So good,” Luna agrees. The conversation pauses as they concentrate on their food. Suddenly Ron looks up, an expression of alarm on his face.
“I’ll be right back,” she says, leaving them to decide on their orders. Harry stares at his menu for a few seconds before realizing that all the words are swimming around the page and he can’t read anything.
“Did I hear about them,” scoffs Malfoy. “Blaise hasn’t shut up about it in my ear for the past four days.”
“So what are you gonna do now?” asks Harry.
“Come on, it’s not even that dirty.” To prove his point, Harry runs a finger along the cement. It comes away covered in dust and Malfoy sneers.
Malfoy seems to get it immediately. “I only did my NEWTS because I didn’t know what else to do,” he confesses. “School is all I’ve ever known. I don’t know who I am without it. After everything had fallen apart, it was just the logical thing to do.”
Ginny removes her hands from her face and looks up at him from her place on the floor. “I just don’t think I’m cut out for monogamy, or something.”
“I will
“This was fun,” Dean says as they gather together after the march is over. “Bar?”
“Terrifying girl,” Blaise says admiringly. “I’d better go after her.” Harry watches as they disappear into the crowd, then returns his attention to the Slytherins sitting across from him. Malfoy is studying him thoughtfully, chin resting in one hand, the other wrapped around a fancy looking cocktail. It doesn’t escape Harry’s notice that he wears dozens of rings on his skinny fingers, some large, some smaller, mixing both silver and gold. He’s stopped slicking back his hair too; it’s grown out a bit and falls gently around his face. Combining that with an impossibly stylish black long-sleeved button up, Harry is forced to admit that Malfoy looks a world away from the pale, scared boy he once knew.
“Is that real?” one of the guys asks, pointing to his scar.
Harry wakes early the next morning feeling like someone hit him in the head with a bludger. His mouth is dry and tastes like something crawled into it overnight and died there. All of his muscles ache from sleeping on the hard floor.
Harry blinks several times to process this new information, as well as the new piece of metal in Malfoy’s face, which works unfairly well on him. It makes sense, Harry supposes, and also explains his recent confidence and impeccable style. Not that all gay people were fashionable, but Malfoy’s always been exceedingly posh. His bewilderment doesn’t escape Malfoy’s notice. Shaking his head, he drawls, “Really, Potter, you didn’t know that I’m gay? Thought I made it pretty obvious.” He meaningfully gestures at the book he’s currently reading.
Even Seamus is impressed with his outfit, and whistles as he sits down. “Bloody hell, Malfoy!” he exclaims. “Guess you didn’t spend all that time in the closet for nothing.”
,” she says, laughing a bit. “Ben & Jerry’s?”
He nods. “I’m not gonna lie, Gin, that’s big. I know you’ve only been together for a couple months, but still.”
Just as Harry exits the last place he’s looked at, he receives an owl from Ginny. It’s just one line and the slip of paper contains a time and address that’s not too far from where he currently is. He has barely enough time to grab a tea from a shop nearby and make it to his appointment on time.
The rest of their conversation gets a bit unintelligible from there, the alcohol doing most of the talking. But after the food is gone it seems to take a bit of a turn, as drunk confessions do as the night goes on, and Harry finds himself telling Malfoy about the Dursleys.
“Harry! Were we expecting you tonight, mate?” Ron asks.
She fixes Harry with a piercing gaze, then sighs good-naturedly, all the tension going out of her body. “Oh, never mind that! We have lots of stories to tell you. Maybe not while Molly and Arthur are in the room though.”
“Shut up, Malfoy,” he mutters. “I’m not in the mood.”
“Master Potter,” Kreacher wails the fourth time he appears. “Master Potter must not do Kreacher’s job! Let Kreacher do the cleaning of Grimmauld Place. You must.”
Eyeroll. “Harry, don’t be stupid. Of course not.”
He looks so uncomfortable admitting this that Harry bursts out laughing. A smile curves Malfoy’s lips at this response.
Malfoy ends up winning this round, distracting Harry by telling him that he saw some Dementors earlier in the park.
made horrible fucking choices that hurt everyone around me. I wish I could go back and slap some sense into myself. I’ve spent this whole year trying to distance myself from who I used to be but it still doesn’t feel like enough. It feels wrong — I
“Appreciate it,” Ron mutters sarcastically. “Would have also appreciated not knowing his dick size.”
Harry shakes his head. “You can, I don’t feel like it. I’ll see all these people tomorrow at the weekly Weasley dinner anyway.”
Harry finds himself taking the blunt from Malfoy’s fingers. Never in a million years did he expect to be getting high on the roof with Draco Malfoy, but then again, nothing in his life turned out to be normal. They stand like that for a while, passing it back and forth and admiring the sprawl of London below them. There’s a pleasant breeze, and it’s not too hot for a midsummer night. Harry tries to pat down his hair as the wind tears through it; he’s sure he looks absolutely ridiculous, at least compared to Malfoy, who somehow seems strangely elegant and very human with a blunt in his hand.
“Oh, Harry, my dear boy!” Molly whirls around and gathers him into her arms in a warm hug. “You’ve caught me. You look too skinny, are you eating enough? Here, have some chili. Tell me if it needs anything.” Before he can protest, she ladles a huge helping into a bowl and forces it into his hands.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Well I know
over and over announcing your place
He desperately scrapes his brain for something to break the awkward silence. “Congrats on finishing your NEWTS, you both.”
The way Malfoy’s gone all defensive doesn’t escape Harry’s notice and he immediately feels guilty. “I’m not making fun of you, or anything,” he replies. “I get it, you know? Sorry if it seemed like I was poking fun.”
win,” argues Malfoy, “since I came up with two whole poems
“You’re such a dirty cheat,” complains Malfoy, pinching Harry’s arm, hard.
We are quite high.”
“I know that,” Harry argues, not understanding where this is going. “As if I wasn’t part of those efforts.”
“I’m gonna go home,” Harry tells Ginny as he finishes up and puts his plate into the sink. “I need a nap.”
Harry fidgets. “Yeah, well. Not like your life has been so perfect either.”
Hermione sets down her glass and pats the sofa next to her. “I think that’s a good idea, Harry. Being in that big house by yourself can’t be good for your mental health. Where are you gonna go?”
And will end up an old ugly bat.”
Wincing, Harry shrugs. “Er...kind of. It’s not like I
Harry groans. “It was nothing like that! We were just on the roof talking. Also, getting high.”
“That’s good,” he agrees. “You have to make one now.”
always is.
“Why are you even here?” Harry retorts. “Seriously, did you just come over here to make me miserable?”
be sitting on the ground like that.” Malfoy’s voice comes from somewhere above him.
“Bloody hell, Ron, I almost had a heart attack,” Harry answers, letting out a sigh of relief. “I think I can live without the hash browns.”
Harry, quite used to Ginny’s peer pressure, shakes his head. “I know Gin, really, I don’t feel up to it. But have a great time. Say hi to everyone for me.”
“Harry!” Arthur bellows from the backyard upon hearing him greet Molly.
“Missed you yesterday,” she says. “The work you did on the castle…phenomenal, Harry, really. It looks amazing. Good as new.”
“What are you reading?”
Harry laughs. “Well, in that case there might not be.” Hermione fist bumps him and accepts a margarita from Seamus.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Whatever,” grumbles Malfoy. He waves his wand, sending the clothes back into the basket and the dirty mugs into the sink, but it doesn’t do much. Harry wants to offer to help, but knows that Malfoy would just take offense at that and so he leaves it alone. He heads over to the sofa, stacking the books that lie on the floor onto the coffee table and folding up the blankets and laying them over the back of the couch before taking a seat.
Harry manages not to get himself in trouble until the weekend, which is when he and all of his friends are attending the London Pride march. He’s never been able to go before for several reasons, including the fact that he had spent his summers either trapped at the Dursley’s or on the run from Voldemort, and also had no idea he was bi until fairly recently.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Very helpful, Gin, thank you.”
“Drive a little slower, would you?” Malfoy yells. “I’d like to live for more than twenty years, thank you very much.” The traffic signal in front of them turns red and Harry screeches to a halt.
“You’d think the Wizarding World would be advanced enough to have a more just economic system, but I guess not. And what about the AIDS epidemic?” asks Harry, feeling it’s necessary to bring up. “14 million people have died so far, and Reagan didn’t even
He shakes his head. “Do you know how to count? It has four!”
much,” she complains. “I hate having crushes. It’s debilitating.”
Harry grimaces. “Yup. Got it in a...car crash,” he lies, remembering what Petunia had told him about its origins years and years ago. The guy seems to believe him easily enough, and they dance together for a while, until Harry finds that he’s suddenly kissing this stranger. It’s fun, he decides, relaxing into the kiss, and anyways this guy is really good at it. After several minutes of intense making out Harry eventually pulls away, smiling sheepishly.
Ginny shrugs. “I have no clue. Somewhere in the park.”
Shrugging, Malfoy twists his rings around his fingers again. “Enough.”
“This is amazing,” he whispers to Ginny, who’s walking next to him. She squeezes his hand. The march isn’t starting for another half hour, so they decide to seek out Malfoy, Pansy, and Astoria.
“That’s true. Are you making tea or not?”
“That was crazy,” declares Malfoy as Harry parks his motorcycle in front of his building. “You’re a fucking crazy driver.”
“Do you have any idea where they’ll be?” Hermione asks. “There’s so many people here, it’ll be impossible to find them.”
Dean snaps his fingers in support. “Fucked how the wizarding community thinks we’re past all of the homophobia and biphobia but we’re really just as bad as the Muggles,” he says. “Honestly, the Muggles are probably making more progress with LGBT rights than we are.”
“Hey, Potter,” she greets him as he slides into the booth, directly across from Malfoy. “Nice work on the castle, by the way.”
“Invited, am I? Have I been forgiven that easily for making fun of your outfits? You’re not wearing shoes either,” he points out.
Heading into the kitchen, Harry opens the cupboard where he knows Ginny keeps her hangover potion. He unscrews the cap and braces himself for the horrible feeling it brings, but after swallowing a disgusting mouthful he feels much better. His stomach growls loudly, and Harry decides to cook some breakfast. Thankfully Ginny keeps her fridge well stocked, so after putting on the kettle for tea, Harry whips up some scrambled eggs and a potato hash, which he knows Ron will be thrilled about after the hash browns were missing last night. Shortly, Ginny joins him in the kitchen in search of the hangover potion. He passes it to her wordlessly and spoons some breakfast onto a plate. They sit at her round table and silently eat their food. Gradually the others begin to get up and join them for breakfast, first Hermione and then Luna.
Harry heads into the kitchen, deciding to make more coffee while he brainstorms other things he could do, but
“I’d expect nothing less,” replies Harry. Too tipsy to apparate safely back to Ginny’s flat, they meander slowly down the street, enjoying the last of the daylight as they crack jokes on the way home.
Harry does just that, and parks the motorcycle in the alley out back when he gets home, admiring just how gorgeous it is, polished metal shining in the moonlight.
Malfoy sneers. “What didn’t I do, you mean. Clean, mostly.”
Dean nods and turns to Harry, who’s been happily observing the conversation. “When are Ron and Hermione getting here?”
“Someone hasn’t heard of self-control,” he murmurs, examining Harry’s recent purchases.
“This is amazing,” says Hermione with her mouth full. “I didn’t even realize how hungry I was.”
Despite himself, Harry laughs. “And yet I’m sure you’ll keep trying. So, Mary Oliver?”
Harry wakes surprisingly clear-headed for the first time in a while. He’s excited to explore his new neighborhood, and sure he’s spent lots of time in this area with Ron and Hermione, but walking down the streets will be different now that he lives here.
“Hello,” Malfoy says petulantly.
“Well, that’s new,” he replies, blinking. “Is there anyone in particular, or…?”
Harry laughs and kisses her on the cheek before heading outside. Arthur is standing beside a polished motorcycle and looking very proud indeed.
“Still here, Malfoy?” Harry asks. “Don’t you have somewhere to be? Oh wait—”
Harry considers this. “But if Divination is the magical equivalent of say, tarot card reading, does that mean it holds more credibility? Because in the magical world it seems to be treated pretty much the same.”
Potter is sitting here too
“That is so rude!” Malfoy says, shoving Harry and beginning a limerick of his own.

She pouts. “McGonagall is gonna be upset you didn’t show.”
Seeing as there’s no food in his house, Harry decides to stop at a coffee shop for breakfast. He’d spotted a little independent coffee shop down the street when he was moving in, he thinks it’s attached to a bookstore too, so that’s where he heads.
the world offers itself to your imagination,
They apparate back to Ginny’s flat, which lies right around the corner from Ron and Hermione’s. Harry throws himself onto her sofa as she heads into the bathroom to shower. He amuses himself by flipping through one of her Quidditch magazines, musing if he should get a new broom or not. He hasn’t flown in ages; maybe the new Nimbus will inspire him to get back into it.
Malfoy laughs softly in his ear. “Potter, you’re useless,” he says. “Didn’t you want waffles?”
Not bothering to knock on the door, he steps inside and encounters a still-empty home. Rounding the corner, he glimpses Molly standing in the kitchen, stirring a pot of chili and humming to herself.
Harry isn’t quite sure where to begin the process of moving into a new flat. Hermione is gracious enough to set up a few appointments for him to look at flats in their neighborhood, so that is where he heads. After looking at a place off a noisy street, another place with windows that face directly to another building, one with saggy floorboards, and another one that just doesn’t feel right, he’s about to give up. At least for today, he’s sure Hermione will return tomorrow with an even longer list.
Harry grins, delighted. “So that means I win,” he says. “Unless you want to finish and tell me that everyone wished I was dead, or something like that.”
“The last time you spoke?” Harry frowns.
“Draco Malfoy has a very messy flat
Harry looks over at him, a bit taken aback by the politeness of his inquiry. “Good, thanks. They’re both doing training right now, Hermione’s at St. Mungo’s and Ron’s in the Ministry.”
“Oh, speaking of the Slytherins,” says Ginny as she sips her margarita, “we’ll probably run into Malfoy and Pansy and Pansy’s girlfriend at the parade. They said they’d try to find us.”
“Yeah, it was,” he agrees. “Er, can I use your floo?”
“It was horrible,” says Harry honestly. “Really, the worst thing I’ve ever heard. Also, the last line only has four syllables.”
. Maybe they should start addressing each other by their first names, Harry thinks, seeing as they’re sort of becoming friends now. In any case, that’s a matter for another time. He dashes off a reply and then tries to keep himself busy for the next few hours before noon but finds it quite impossible to get any reading done in his anticipation.
“Of course.” Harry retrieves a pint of ice cream from the freezer and two spoons and they spend the rest of the night talking about Blaise and then Luna and then nothing in particular.
“Thanks. See you,” calls Harry as he steps into the fireplace. The flames whoosh around him and Malfoy’s gorgeous, disaster of a flat disappears from view.
“Well, that makes two of us. Come on, let’s go back in. Everyone’s probably gone now, finally.” Harry climbs to his feet and reaches out a hand to help Malfoy up, and they head back downstairs to the flat.
Malfoy scoffs, suddenly sounding much more like the boy Harry’s used to. “The ball, Potter. Unfortunately you did not grace us with your presence, but everyone else who’s ever set foot in Hogwarts was there, you know.”
He will never clean
Harry blushes. He’s a little embarrassed about missing the second half of his housewarming, but when he thinks about the kindness of his friends, he knows Hermione’s right, of course.
“Yeah.”
Harry looks down, noticing the deep purple mark by his elbow that still hasn’t faded from the first time he crashed his motorcycle. “Had a bit of an accident,” he says vaguely. “Hey, what are you up to this afternoon?”
didn’t have a long day learning how to fill out paperwork. Seriously, Harry, you dodged a bullet by deciding not to become an Auror. At this rate my job is going to be 80% bureaucracy and 20% field work. Merlin.”
The lift did not even switch from horizontal to vertical movement as Draco felt an inexplicable rush of excitement. It took him just a second to realize that among at least a dozen people was also Harry. Who, apparently, did see Draco come in. Seconds later the visual part came and Draco watched stepping behind himself in the free of other people lift, reaching around with Harry's hands and starting to undo his own pants. Draco cursed his luck.
"Why should I care?" said Draco. "My friends... I mean my friends back then all knew that about me. Back then they sure would've been shocked if they learned that I am together with you. But now? Who cares?"
"Ehm... Are you asking about the mechanics?"
"But you... I mean what about all those witches?" said Draco with surprise.
"My dignity doesn't allow me to wank to a measly blowjob when there is an actual fucking a press of a button away. I have standards."
"So what of it? When I had sex for the first time I also wasn't completely sober!"
Draco's mouth opened and closed as he stared down at Harry, but no sounds came out.
"Is it really so difficult to ask me to do it?"
"Said recently to you. I've known for a while."
"You've got to see this!"
"All the difference. You want to go further, than you have to -"
"So why those insinuations?"
"Again?!" Draco exclaimed and Harry nodded simply. "You're being ridiculous. There's a simple charm for this."
"So you are going to keep meeting with other men?!"
Draco blushed. "I lied. Last week when you had to go away for a few days, I... Mmm... I was taking a shower and... I wanked imaging you blowing me."
"They are snogging," whispered Ron, his face was still red.
"Huh?! It's like you want me to cheat!"
"Shut up."
"They aren't that little. And don't call them bells!"
Harry with wide horror-filled eyes watched Snape kneel into a knuckle deep, pink from blood water beside unconscious Malfoy and pour the contents of a small vial into his mouth. Then he began chanting something so unrecognizable that did not even seem like any language should sound. After just a minute Snape stood up and addressed him. But Harry in his shocked state was not able to distinguish a single word and it all went by the same way the gibberish he heard before.
"I'm not going to bite your dick off because I am a bit tipsy!"
"Still... I think it's because you're cooped up in here. So with having no alternative you -"
"More so. What's the problem then?"
"Mmm... I don't really have a preference. I like normal sex a lot as well."
"Sure you aren't... We're just live together, sleep in the same bed, and have sex."
"You can't be serious!"
Harry parted his lips and finally put them around the cock. Harry knew that Draco wasn't going to last long after all the edging he has done over the past half-an-hour, but he didn't expect to have his mouth to be filled with cum after barely a few hearty sucks. Harry grabbed the shaft just as the first spurt hit his tongue and stroked it for a few seconds as spurts kept coming. And when he deemed Draco to be done, Harry turned to the drain and spit the cum into it.
"Your reassuring me of that is not very reassuring."
"I'm not trying to do anything," said Harry from behind him as he stroked Draco's slick with soap throbbing cock with one hand, and with the other massaged his no less soapy balls. Harry stood a little sideways, careful not to touch Draco's body with his own very much hard cock, knowing full well that it would freak Draco out, just like it had last time.
The foreskin is just another barrier for me to enjoy peeling. The last one. With my hand I pull the skin of the cock towards my mouth, and when I pull back, sucking, I gently nibble the bunched-up foreskin with my lips. I even chew on it with my teeth. But I do it extra carefully. Giving it barely any pressure at all. I don't even know why I do it. I just do.
Draco blushed looking down at Harry, who had his cock lying across the face as he sucked in both of his balls into his mouth. Maintaining suction Harry pulled back a tiny bit, then sucked the balls back deeper into his mouth. He repeated that again and again.
"Besides the Ministry and Hermione?"
"Will you stop with this nonsense already?! Harry said that he also liked boys while we were still in Hogwarts."
"You would be if you keep drinking. I'm living with you. I know that it does not take you much."
"What's more likely, that mine and Harry's combined judgment is wrong or yours?"
In that half-a-minute Draco did not see or hear any more thoughts that were not produced by his own mind. He slowed down feeling that he was on the verge of a hiccup and downed the rest of his tea. Maybe Potter was just passing by and it was safe to ...? But before he managed to finish that thought he saw another vision, this time of himself sitting sideways on Harry's lap, wearing the same scant outfit, while Harry was feeding him a chocolate cake.
"Have oral sex..."
Harry grabbed a shampoo bottle from the rack and handed it to Draco, who took it without a word.
He pushed that train of thought aside and tried to concentrate on the thing that would make him cum and kept on wanking, imagining how nice it would feel to have Harry's cock up his bum and visualizing it. The imaginary Draco always enjoyed it so much...
"We? We don't do anything. But if you want to experience how it is to get fucked in the arse, I suggest you go and find somebody who would do it. There are several charms that might be of help, so I can teach you if you want."
I slowly slide my lips off the cock, my eyes are closed, and make a gulp. It's nasty. It's disgusting. And I love it beyond measure. But my body seems to be of the other opinion. But no matter. I manage to suppress its urge as I make another few swallows of mostly saliva.
Draco motioned to the screen. "I already can see what you understand by that. I'm not impressed."
"Yes, and the other half is of her face. Doesn't look in her eyes just melts you?"
The last thing that went through Draco's mind before Harry broke the silence by clearing his throat, finally forcing Draco to look at him, was him cursing those baby-blue, sparsely strewn with small orange daisies nylon stockings that he had donned on that morning, which were still hidden beneath his trousers. As if they somehow were the cause for his fuck-up. Even at moments like this he instinctively tried to shift blame to anything but himself, be it even a garment.
"So? It's not the same."
"Surely madam Pomfrey has more of blood-replenishing potion," said Harry, but it sounded hollow even to his own ears.
"Ehm... Harry? What are you doing?"
Harry was standing on his knees over Draco's chest and playfully tapping his cockhead on Draco's tongue. Each time Draco tried to capture it with his lips Harry would pull it up with an impish smile and giggle.
"Not as easy without your hero status, right?" Draco said smirking. "You have to do more than just show your face to get witches fall all over you?"
"I dunno... Normal? Not skinny? Doesn't she have the most amazing tits?"
Harry chuckled. "Ron has been my friend for fifteen years. By that logic I -"
Draco remained in the cubicle for another minute after he heard the door swinging as Harry left. He ignored that intrusive thought, that gnawing doubt that plagued him from time to time, the one that wanted to convince him that those were not Potter's thoughts. Never were. That it all was a product of his own mind. That he just was deranged. Went off his rocker. From all the shit that the Dark Lord made him see and do. Or from that unknown curse that Potter hit him with back in Hogwarts from which he still had some thin scars, predominantly over his left ribs.
"I never asked you to!"
What Draco liked the most about his ability to read Harry's mind was to not just know that he was desirable in that way, but to actually feel it. If only Potter held himself in check more, and didn't indulge in it so damn much! Sometimes, especially when those visions happened when Draco saw Harry with Ginny, not that over the years it had happened more than a handful of times, he wanted nothing more than to grab Harry by his shoulders and shout in his face, "What the fuck, Potter?! Don't you have any shame whatsoever?? Hold yourself in check!"
"Nothing. I said already that I also like shaving."
"Well, it's something," said Harry and turned around.
"Take whatever you want from the kitchen," said Harry motioning to the small kitchen. He gestured to the living room. "TV, couch... Bathroom is there." Harry pointed to the left. "I don't have a lot of space as you see, but I think we'll manage. Anyway, I'm off to work. Hope my place is going to be still there when I return."
In a way this was their usual wanking session, but because it was Halloween on a weekend, there was alcohol, and significantly more than usual.
"Found much?" Ron shook his head avoiding her eyes. "Then let me help you" - she pointed at one of the gravy boats. "This definitely contains either Draught of Living Dead or Kaspian Nightmare. And this" - she pointed at cheese - "is full of some exotic deadly toxins. Looks suspiciously yellow and stuff! Don't you think?! And see all these holes?? They must be from how exceptionally corrosive the poison is. Beware!!"
"Or is it because I was with -"
"Pfff... I'm not even sure that you're bi and sleeping with me because you have no other options."
Draco had no doubt that Harry had some experience with men because it felt so real. He did not care how exactly Harry got the experience - whether it was in the past, or Harry was cheating, or he and Ginny had some sort of an arraignment. It was irrelevant. What mattered was that Harry had given blowjobs. For Draco even the idea of Harry sucking somebody off who was not him for some reason was a thrill. Maybe because it differed from Harry's fantasies, in which even when they were not alone, Harry engaged sexually only with him. So Draco liked to wank imagining Harry blowing some bloke in a dark alley, especially with that imaginary Harry thinking that that bloke was a substitute for the real Draco.
The lift was gradually getting emptier and emptier all the while the imaginary-Draco was pressed, but gently, as always, cheek-first into the lacquered wooden wall of the cabin and fucked from behind. The imaginary-Draco seemingly enjoyed it more than the imaginary-Harry.
Draco was sitting in the cafeteria on the ground floor of the Ministry, eating his lunch while staring at a blank wall not thinking about anything in particular as he saw a vivid image flash in his mind for just a split-second. He barely held himself from chocking from the suddenness of it. In the image he saw himself standing by his current table in the empty cafeteria with a dreamy look, as if in waiting, clad in nothing but a frilly, layered, maroon mini-skirt and black fishnet stockings.
"Only we began with oral because I wanted to try it!"
"I don't know what you're talking about."
"What kind of a question is that? There are muggle clubs and bars that are for... for just men."
"I..." Harry began but he was not even sure what he wanted to say. He with unfocused eyes stared at a wall trying to come up with something.
"I am NOT your boyfriend!"
"Me? No." Harry squinted at him in mixture of confusion and disbelief. "I just stated the obvious way out for you. I like being fucked, but it's not like I can't live without it. And overall, people cheat. Lots of people. If you're going to be smart about it and don't get caught, then chances are you'd get away with it."
The words barely registered in Draco's mind as Harry grabbed his cock and started to stroke it, all the while looking up completely nonchalantly with a small, almost wicked smile. Draco stared not believing his eyes. The feeling of somebody else's hand wrapped around his cock, what he hasn't had for a while, hampered his thinking.
"Take a bath maybe?"
Ron nodded solemnly a moment before the double-doors opened and Harry walked in with Draco in tow.
Though Hermione lobbied to broaden the criteria and apply it to everybody but murderers, knowing that otherwise it would dissuade people from voting for it, in the end she had to give in and agree to what she was able to persuade the majority of the Wizengamot to. The program accepted only convicts that were not seen directly engaging in violence. Which to an extend defeated the purpose of Restorative Justice. But Hermione hoped that with time, after the program would show positive results, which she had no doubts about, it would be able to accept a broader swath of offenders.
"Well, if you could've gotten to his place, you wouldn't have -"
Harry without a word pointed at the bathroom door, drawing Draco's eyes to it and to a standard-sized piece of paper that was taped to it. The paper was not even simply white, but seemed to glow, which made it seemingly impossible not to notice. And yet, somehow Draco had missed it when he, in his horny state, had rushed to the bathroom no more than twenty minutes ago. It stated in big letters that were easily readable from where he stood: "Unidirectional silencing charms are taken down until further notice. Use your own. - Administration."
"Doing what?" said Harry innocently as he was smearing his precum on Draco's pursed lips. Draco demonstratively turned away, and Harry's tip left a wet trail on Draco's flushed right cheek. Harry glanced back and saw Draco still stroking his own cock, which assured him that he wasn't going too far yet. "Come on... I want to hear it."
"No. Me saying all that shouldn't affect any potential jealousy on my behalf in case you're not a complete moron. And if you are a moron, then, given that I would know whether you are by now, me saying all that should only lessen any potential suspicions. Though depends on which levels we're thinking, if there's an even divide between us, then we might play ourselves. But since I'm probably higher up, means I can adjust my thinking to odd number and -"
"I like your blowjobs."
I know that he's getting there by his breathing and how much often his muscles start to contract. Particularly on his abdomen. I don't even think about slowing down. I make his cockhead hit the back of my mouth on each stroke, even though I'm at my limit and barely hold myself from gagging. I want him to enjoy it... No! I do it only to get his cum! His pleasure is incidental and completely irrelevant! ... If he would only grab my head and force me to deep-throat him... I'd take a face-fucking. Even through gagging. I can take it if he wants me to.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
"Muggle women don't know who I am."
"Then shave yourself."
"Besides..." He pulled back the foreskin and concentrated on the glans, squeezing out a stifled sigh out of Draco. "I'm not forcing you. Just say two simple words and stop me." Draco remained silent, discounting his light whimpers. "Just as I thought..." Harry returned his hand back to the shaft. "We'll make your cock nice and clean..." - he moved his fist back and forth, knowing full well how Draco liked it - "Nice and clean..."
"You're not my boyfriend!"
"So what, no more women for me then?" Harry said finally.
"You may fuck me mouth if you want. Just like the other day."
Draco tried to quell his misplaced vexation at somebody using the bathroom at the same time as him. He hated how he still felt entitled about such petty things and had been actively trying to better himself, with not much success though.
"Mister Malfoy is going to turn into a corpse by then. But, why not? Let us wait..."
"Ts-ts-ts... Plight of a convict..."
"Sure-sure. Whatever you say."
Harry pulled back a little. "Yep, you shouldn't... Although you're hardly doing anything besides being busy just standing."
Ministry lifts were slow. But that had been the case for ages, and almost everybody, including Draco, was so used to it that a thought that it might be different never crossed their minds. His, and by extension Harry's, floor was on the minus seventeenth level, so the ride there, with a multitude of stops along the way, took a good five minutes as usual. During which at first Draco went through an imaginary spanking and then fucking.
Draco turned and saw Harry holding a razor.
Draco was taken aback and stared at Harry for a bit. "Really??"
As Harry's second foot got back down, Draco looked up, mindful not to stare at Harry's very much hard cock that was closer to his face that he felt comfortable with, and asked, "Happy now?"
"Sorry."
"Yep."
"I don't. I'm just saying what already should be obvious to you. Hm... I think I said the same thing just a minute ago."
All his previous grievances at the disturber of peace immediately forgotten, Draco resumed wanking, revelling in the steadily growing in intensity sensations, stroking his cock at a significantly slower pace than usually. His own arousal mixing with the one from Harry made it a lot stronger and within a minute he had to let his cock go lest he finish right that moment.
From those words Harry had a flashback to what had happened at the graveyard almost two years prior. Which not in the slightest helped him remain calm and think rationally. Snape shook a coil of thin transparent tube with short glinting needles at both ends that he just finished conjuring, drawing Harry's attention to it, as if emphasizing that Harry had no choice but to comply. In the background Harry wandered if Snape becoming physical for the second time in the past minutes, which Snape had never done before, was connected with Snape's allegedly fictitious Unbreakable Vow that nobody seemed to take seriously besides Harry.
"Big surprise. You never know. That's why you have to actually say that you want me to blow you again."
Couldn't he have undone them himself?! I fume as I quickly go through the ridiculous number of tiny buttons that no normal shirt should have. It's like he knew that I was going to be doing this and on purpose put on a shirt with 20 buttons. What the fuck?! Only as I reach the last few at the top, I realize that I counted them as I was undoing them. There are actually 22 of them! It must be on purpose! And barely a minute ago I thought that he is a decent human being...
"That's not my problem. I'm not cuddling with you, and more so not sleeping in one bed with you when you just want to get an occasional blowjob from me. Or give one."
"Don't worry," said Harry lying beside Draco an hour after Jane has left. "Jane said she had fun and wants to do it again."
Harry was about to turn around as Draco exclaimed in an almost offended tone, "But they are having sex! Right there!"
"The charm gets rid of everything. And I liked leaving some untouched. ... Please?"
Draco huffed. "Of course not! Because I don't love you."
"Even if not, that doesn't change the fact that Harry would never have gotten into -"
"Just look at HER and at the women in porn, they all are -"
"You brain jumbled up your dreams and the reality. Remember we recently watched a documentary about cognition? That must be it."
"Because you need to finally see reason!" Harry rolled his eyes. "We can't even see her twat. I mean, there's barely a tit showing." Harry ignored the rambling and kept stroking his cock lazily. "... And now the best of all - they're showing this bloke's mug. That's what we need!"
Hermione shrugged and said also in a hushed tone, "Good for them. It just means that in Draco's case my program has worked as intended."
"Well, everybody CAN cheat at anything, or more like try to. The Slytherin way is not to get caught. It always was the unofficial motto back in Hogwarts regarding pretty much everything. So if you do it in the quintessentially Slytherin way, then you get what you want and nobody gets hurt. So a win-win."
Harry was not sure whether he imagined it, but before the words in an unknown language began it sounded like Snape muttered, "Bloody morons everywhere!"
"This never happened to me before..." he mumbled dejectedly. Worst of all he felt about hardening back when Harry, as per condition of their threesome, sucked him off. Not even entertaining the idea of touching Harry's cock with Jane there. At least it was comforting that midway Jane decided to help Harry and they both sucked him off.
Draco sighed barely containing himself from calling Harry a weirdo. "Merlin... Whatever."
They argued for another minute before hearing a muffled pop in the corridor. Ron was first to rush out of the living room. He was about to wish Harry a happy birthday when he saw him hugging Draco as their faces were glued to each-other.
It took some convoluted justifications, but Hermione managed in the end to persuade the panel that Harry Potter was the second victim to Draco's crimes. So since Aberforth did not show any willingness, Harry came in. Harry also was not that enthusiastic about the idea. But he wanted to support Hermione, so after several mediated meetings with Draco in the Azkaban, Harry agreed to give it a try.
"Potter, taking a shower with you is weird enough."
"I didn't ask you to wank me. I can do it even without any material."
"There are??"
He was about done licking his hand clean as he heard the door to the adjacent cubicle open, reminding him where he was and bringing him back into reality. He as usual planned to wait until Harry would be gone.
I start to wonder whether I should do it today as well, and quickly decide that there's no point in thinking. I brace myself. I know I'm bad at this. But I like it nonetheless. I take my hand off the cock and put it on his thigh instead. Shimmying my chin a little I carefully make the cock inter my throat. I slowly keep going until my nose gets pressed into the pubes that I like so much. I feel being on the verge, but stay motionless like that for several seconds, making swallowing motions. Then I slowly pull back. Most of my gagging happens when a cock is on its way in or out and holding one in isn't too difficult. Almost not. At least I try to talk myself into believing that. So I can't just face-fuck myself on his cock, no matter how much I want to. And it's not like I want it so much... Or at all really...
Snape stared at him intently and Harry realized that he was waiting for a confirmation. "Got it. Sectumsempra. Also very dangerous."
"I can't be hurt by what I don't know, right? Kant's not my thing."
"And I want to be able to use magic again. We all have our pipe dreams."
I know it's wrong. And not wrong in a general sense, but just... He is Malfoy! What Ron or Hermione would think? Ron in particular would say that Malfoy bewitched me and insist on checking me for curses.
Harry sighed. "Well, thanks. But can you be a bit more descriptive? Come on! Am I really asking this much?"
Harry himself thought that a curfew for Malfoy was a silly idea. But he agreed to the terms and had to follow them. Though he did not plan on running to the Ministry to tell-tale on Malfoy even if he was an hour late once in a while. But Malfoy, who did not know that, almost never came home without having at least an hour to spare.
"Had sex with my mouth..." Harry continued while slowly stroking his own cock and playing with Draco's balls.
"What insinuations? It seemed that I was quite straightforward."
Done with Harry's back, Draco asked him to turn. Harry did and Draco started to rub the sponge over Harry's chest in circles, slowly going lower and lower.
"Ehm... Stop playing with your balls and concentrate on your cock, or stop altogether?" Draco huffed and looked up at the ceiling. "I guess I did spend too much time with your two little bells."
"Your first somewhat sound arguments today. But don't think that I haven't thought about it all myself. Is there a remote chance of you being right? Yes. Would I act like you as if it isn't a marginal chance? Nope. Otherwise..." She sighed, tired of rehashing it for the Nth time. Then she heard steps approaching. She looked at Ron sternly. "One word... One!"
"I... Ehm..."
I've no idea where he likes to cum. And I don't care. He has no other choice but to finish in my mouth. As always. This is part of the deal. Even though we haven't discussed the terms. I came for this and I'm going to get it. There isn't going to be a warning. There's never one. And I don't need it. I know when he gets close maybe even before he does.
"We're not. I'm ready to do or say pretty much everything you'd ask me. Within reason."
"Blowjobs are different and don't count."
"Come on. I helped you cum. Help me cum as well." Draco grumbled. "I used my mouth, now use yours and say how you liked it."
"Assuming that Harry did it on his own." Hermione groaned with frustration. "Even putting bewitchment aside. Malfoy might be just playing Harry. No potions or charms. Nothing like that. Just straight up manipulation."
"I... I wouldn't be against it..."
"No-no-no. It's not going to cut it. You weren't against it for the first time. For the second blowjob you'd have to ask for it."
"I am DEAD serious! And you were bummed that Harry told me about getting together with Draco ten months before you? Harry asked me not to tell you, but it just has to be said - it was ME who persuaded Harry to finally tell you. Understand? That's what your attitude does! Your best friend wanted to keep you in the dark because he knew you wouldn't accept it. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
"That does not answer my question."
Draco huffed, folded his arms over his chest, but still pressed the Return button. Draco was given more liberties than he had expected when Harry took him in, but he still had to keep himself in check and remember that he was kind of a guest. To that day he still wasn't able to understand why Harry, of all people, took him in. And Harry's explanation that it was a right thing to do didn't sit right with him.
Harry pulls him over to the Gryffindor table and they sit down to wait. When Ron and Hermione get to the great hall for lunch they find Harry and Draco sitting at the Gryffindor table, Harry leaning back against the Slythryn’s chest.
“Oh, no, Sweetheart, panic attacks are not weakness, they can't be punished out of you, it only makes them worse. I’d know,” I try to reassure him.
I sit with Harry and his friends at dinner, and to my surprise they had already heard about what had happened. I explain it in more detail, and the twins cackle gleefully. Luna smiles.
---------
He stiffens, then screams and screams, the sound is heartbreaking. I quickly put up locking and silencing charms, knowing he won't want people to know. When he finally stops I start to sing the first song that comes to my head.
This Roman goddess-duo are like ATC at the arrival and departure gates. Abeona is the goddess for outward journeys and safe passage, while Adiona protects travellers on their way back home. Both goddesses have a special focus on children as Abeona guides them as they leave the nest, while Adiona assures their safe return home. Abeona and Adiona work together to ensure travellers can complete their journeys, and their names mean “to depart, or go forth” and “to approach, or visit,” respectively. They are both considered to be aspects of Juno.
Even though Sirius and Remus didn't die Harry still looked up to them, and they won't have a child of their own because Wolfstar for life, (not that adoption isn't an option or anything, but Sirius is much happier being the cool uncle.)
I shrug.
As Nagini’s soul piece sinks into the Malachite Voldemort appears and begins to throw hexes at the barrier, some of them Avada green. A few of the goblins falter, their surprise showing on their faces, and the barrier collapses, as if in slow motion.
I'm not expecting one, so I continue eating. I jump when Archimedes lands on my plate. He sticks out his leg imperiously, and my heart sinks. When I’m not fast enough he nips my finger hard enough to draw blood. I yelp and quickly take the letter, then watch him fly away. I open my letter slowly, trying to convince myself Father isn't angry at me, that I'm not in trouble.
I walk a bit farther before calling back, “Albus… Albus where did you go...”
“It was tampered with, and very shoddily I might add.”I tell him, “Professor Slughorn taught Uncle Severus, and he has a reputation for collecting people who he thinks will be famous. Many people in his class lost limbs or were permanently disfigured, he only paid attention to those he favoured.”
Do you want a short epilogue?
“No!” I shout angrily. I let go of the tight hold I keep on my magic and it slams him into a wall, his wand flying into my hand. I rush over to my Mate as soon as I have made sure that Lucius is indeed unconscious.
He grumbles and buries his head back in my neck.
We head to a new room, this one is just white marble with a runic circle drawn in the middle. Four more goblins are waiting there, and they join hands around the outside of the runes, and the Malachite is placed in the centre of the circle.
“About Ronald.”
Harry nods.
I had been hoping we would be able to get rid of the old coot legally, but I guess not. Oh well, legal isn't nearly as fun as my way.
His heart leaps, he can see Draco
She practically wrote it because I had no ideas, but I was unable to add her as co-creator. Oh well.
“I never hated you, I just acted that way to hide the fact that I like you,” Draco replies softly.
Seeing his confusion I explain. “We can’t do Dares, now can we? There’s no room. I’ll go first. Truth or Truth?”
, the Dark Lord’s snake!”
“May 1993, it’s in the Chamber of Secrets,” he says, as if it’s no big deal.
“I have something to tell you. Draco Malfoy is my Mate.” I hold my breath, waiting for an outburst.
Harry didn't know what to do. He couldn't kiss Draco, he'd give himself away for sure. He couldn't stay under the mistletoe for the rest of his life, either. He started breathing faster, thinking about the problem he had gotten himself into. Eventually he would have to kiss Draco, and he would find out Harry liked him.
“Thank you,” I murmur, kneeling beside them. “You were very brave, and you saved many lives. I will always be grateful.”
A spell? I wonder indifferently. He leaves, foolishly taking my silence for agreement, and I reenter the classroom, making sure to give a snort full of derision once the blasted old man is out of earshot and smirking when Theo gives me a thumbs up to indicate the spell worked. I’m glad that he knew a spell for amplifying sounds, I knew he would, what with all the reading he does. I take a seat and listen with relish as the class spends the rest of the period whispering about my confrontation with the Headmaster.
I wake up slowly from the best sleep I’ve had for a long time. Suddenly I remember what happened last night. Nonono, I had a panic attack
“It’s alright, Kitten, she’s on our side,” I try to soothe him, moving closer.
My ears flatten and I look around hoping for an escape. He growls again and I whimper.
“We feel”
“I- What about your friends. What will they say? And my Father will be furious that you, of all the people I could have chosen, are my Mate. He’s already angry that I decided to be a Sub.”
“Why can’t I go to Hogwarts yet?” Lily asks, as she has every year since she had been old enough to understand what Hogwarts was.
,” she hisses hopefully.
We all laugh, and the mood lightens quickly. We spend the rest of lunch joking around getting to know each other better.
Once I have recovered Griphook teaches me more about my Creature Magics and how to control them. I also claim my Lord and Heir rings. I put them on one by one, and they blend together, shimmering between the different crests. Griphook tells me that they will protect me from harmful Potions and Spells as well as most compulsions.
” I whisper. Nothing happens. “
I stare at it for a moment in disbelief. I know the only reason he didn't send a Howler is to not draw attention to my mistakes, and now I’m going to have to leave my Mate.
Harry nods thoughtfully. “Do you know anything about Horcruxes?”
“Do you really think that they would go through all that work then not lock the door?”
“So? Binns wouldn't notice if we were gone or we came in late. Now give us back our wands and shove off.” I say snarkily.
Should the next Chapter be Blaise and Ron while they are in the closet? If so, what POV?
Soon the halls are empty and Harry still hasn't done any homework. He keeps getting distracted, glancing up at the blonde to watch him study. Once the last student is gone Draco looks up and Harry’s eyes flash back to his books, praying that Draco didn't notice.
“I talked to diary Tom Riddle, then he called the Basilisk. I tried to talk to it, but it had gone mad. Tom had my wand, and Fawkes appeared with the Sorting Hat. I pulled the Sword of Gryffindor out of it, and stabbed the thing in the roof on the mouth. It got me with it’s fang, here on my arm,” he explains calmly, showing us the scar. “Fawkes cried on it and healed it, then I stabbed the diary with a fang and it bled ink.”
“I like you, Ron,” I whisper, making him shiver.
I barely make it to my room, and I don't have time to put up locking or silencing charms. I’ll just have to hope I can pull myself together before everyone returns. I curl up in the corner farthest from the door and cry as quietly as I can. I’m hyperventilating, I can't slow my breathing down, Father is going to come in and punish me, I need to stop, be quiet,
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
’ I think, rushing into the tunnel.
“You're one to laugh mate. Draco does the same thing to you,” Ron says.
So...
Draco shifts, putting his chin on Harry’s head and rubbing his back, and Harry’s breathing slows. Without thinking he buries his face in Draco’s neck and wraps his arms around Draco’s waist. He can feel Draco’s chest rise and fall beneath him, calming him down the rest of the way. They stay like that for a few minutes, before Harry breaks away and looks at the floor, embarrassed.
“But F-father said Malfoys don’t have panic attacks, so I have to be punished so I stop being a baby.”
