Several times, especially when the plane shook from turbulence, Draco had considered jumping out a window, trusting  his vampire strength to protect him, and casting a Cushioning Charm to slow his landing.
"Apologizing every time you say something awkward. At this rate, you'll be apologizing until the lights come back on."
And the sinking, velvety blackness as Draco drank, until Harry’s limbs were sluiced in soft lead. Until his eyes had fluttered shut and stayed that way, and he’d sunk down and down…
Harry had nearly risen from his seat, but Hermione had an iron grip on his elbow. “Sit. Down.” She hissed. “Read,” she thrusted
“This corona virus.” Neville looked from McGonagall to Harry and back again, clearly unsure how much he should divulge. “It’s spreading.”
Harry awoke hours later. The sun, which had been filtering weakly through the narrow windows above their prison had turned to night. Bright fluorescent lights were in every corner.
“’Took care’ of her?’” Ron had turned pale beneath his freckles, and his fingers caught Harry’s in a vise. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Your Muggle subjects waste away. Your wizard subjects die. The magic takes up no permanent residency. What exactly is my money funding here? More death?”
flight  to Las Vegas. Not only was Potter in America, he was nearly as far away from London as you could be without falling into the
Draco forced his fangs back, and his eyes met Harry’s. They looked at one another, for the first time, as something more than mortal enemies.
McGonagall sighed, exasperated. “Draco, you are one of the brightest students in your year. If you believe this so ardently, you must have a prevailing scientific reason, an awareness of some magic that protects you. What is that magic?”
He rode the lift to the top floor, pacing back and forth, staring at his reflection in the mirror. If Potter was hurt, if there were signs of a struggle, blood…
“You’re obsessed with Malfoy,” she accused. “You need to let it go. The war’s over. Voldemort isn’t coming back.”
“That’s a good thing, right?” Draco protested, “We want to make sure none of this is traced back to him!”
“Thought you’d come looking for me.” The waiter appeared at his elbow almost as though he’d been conjured there.
Dijikstra and Heath didn’t notice. Their eyes were fixed on Draco, who had taken a small step toward them, his eyes turning black. Draco tipped his head to the side and smiled in a way that would have made a demon proud. “I just have one question.” He gestured to the rod in Heath’s hand, and his fangs slid out. “That little device there—does it work on vampires?”
“I don’t back down,” Draco said, even though the fear and adrenaline had him shaking. “Not anymore.”
Harry glanced over at Draco, then away quickly. He was sprawled out on the couch, one hand resting on his stomach, rising and falling gently as he breathed. Harry's cheeks flushed. Why did everything Draco did make Harry feel like he was an exposed nerve, sensitive to the slightest breath of the wind? Why did Draco make him feel so
Lucius looked through the wrought iron gate at Draco, who shuffled his feet nervously. He hadn’t dared to enter without his father’s permission, not since he’d been Turned. He always waited for someone else to walk through the gates first.
All to save her son. All because it was the best chance for Draco to live, no matter what happened to her, no matter what side ended up winning.
They worked in silence beside each other for a while, using a couple of the emergency flashlights to light the area.
This was originally gonna be four chapters. It definitely is going to be longer than that. Hope all of y'all are staying safe and healthy, and finding ways to connect with people in spite of the isolation. It's rough out there.
“I’d rather be here, anyway. You know that.” Harry was sort of looking forward to his time alone. At least he’d be able to visit Dumbledore’s grave in private, without a thousand eyes watching him. He could sneak down to the kitchens and see if the house-elves would let him experiment with a few recipes (he’d gotten very into cooking these last few months; it was a side effect of a childhood spent with food scarcity)…
Draco sat bold upright, his heart racing, chest heaving, as a feeling of emptiness slowly spread inside him.
Draco’s teeth sank in effortlessly, applying the barest amount of force to puncture Potter’s skin, and immediately the blood started to flow from Harry’s veins into Draco’s mouth, down his throat.
Shoutout to @tearinmyarc for helping edit, especially since I was on Benadryl (again) when I wrote this chapter, and I uh--sleep-wrote?!?! Nonsense?!?! So thanks for catching that.
Harry pulled out his Marauder’s Map. “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” he whispered, and waited as the map filled with ink.
Anyway, thank you so much for everyone who's read, left kudos, commented, etc. It's been a wild ride, but we're almost there, y'all.
But Draco had already thought of this. “I flew the Thestral at 9,000 meters. I’ve been in quarantine for long enough that there’s no trace of it. I didn’t touch anything—"
For a heart-stopping moment, he thought the pain came from his scar. He lurched to his feet, groping desperately for his wand, thinking of the graveyard and Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort—
Harry wondered. He thought of the choked way Draco had responded to his prodding about the tower, the defeat that had sunk into him, the way he’d hung his head, like he couldn’t bother to be mean anymore.
The fuzziness turned to a velvety soft blackness, taking over Harry’s vision bit by bit until he finally sank into it, and knew nothing more.
Harry opened his mouth to tell Ron more, but before he could, the door burst open. Before either of them could react, Harry felt the Freezing Charm take hold of him.
But when Draco looked into Harry’s eyes, and Harry’s hand grasped at his, locking that velvet box between them, which held nothing more than a simple set of silver rings, engraved with the words that Harry had whispered to Draco the night of his mother’s death, the words that meant more than
Bolton took her arm, and the two led them down the hallway.  Draco tried to peer into the windows, but all he saw were empty cubicles, a few scraps of parchment and broken quills, a wastepaper bin that hadn’t been properly emptied.  He even saw a Muggle copy machine, the light blinking a dull orange color, as he peered in through an open door.
“Nothing important.” Harry looked up at the ceiling, where the camera rested. He was pretty sure that they could hear what he was saying.
He’d gotten a little flat just a few blocks from the Ministry, and Blaise and Parkinson had both stopped sending him Owls since the party.
“Mr. Malfoy—” while Draco and Harry had been arguing, a white-robed Healer had appeared at Lucius’ side. Her hand on his shoulder was comforting, but her tone was final. “It’s time.”
Harry and Draco had settled into a tentative truce over the past few days. Stuck as they were in quarantine, it had become obvious that they needed to establish a few ground rules in order to avoid killing each other. Especially since Draco was apparently designed to kill people.
He’d snapped into reality, terror freezing his arousal in its tracks. Potter was sagging against him.  He’d passed out. And he was so pale—
Draco frowned, though his heart leapt. “So what is to keep you from taking power from me? Or my cousin?”
Draco shook his head. He’d been hoping these sort of thoughts would go away with time, after what he’d done, but they’d only intensified.
“You were in quarantine, and no one was watching you together, trying to figure out what you were to each other. Isn’t it interesting that you became something else whenever the outside world didn’t matter?”
McGonagall flicked her wand and froze him where he was. “Test him.” She called, and Longbottom sauntered back in, looking smug.
But he still felt—weak. Exhausted. It was an enormous effort to sit up, to squint across the cell in the dimming light.
He couldn’t spend one more second pretending to be this person, the one he’d been during the war, who sneered at wanton destruction and cared only for himself and no one else.
“The Healer was lacking some information.” Draco swept on hurriedly. “Information that would save her.”
Ron snorted into his pudding, but Hermione pulled a face. “Why do you let Malfoy get to you, Harry? It’s not like he’s coming up with anything new.”
And then Malfoy stopped, so abruptly and precisely it seemed almost inhuman. He turned his head slowly until he was staring exactly at where Harry was standing, and his nostrils flared, like he was scenting the air.
Of course, he could have talked to Malfoy, but he wasn’t sure if such a thing qualified as a sane interaction.
They were teenage enemies, participants in a war bigger and darker than either imagined, spilling each other’s blood on a bathroom floor.
“Since we’re in one of the most security-heavy, aggressively American places in the world,” Hermione said. “I’d really prefer you keep your voice down.”
“I can do whatever I need to protect the safety of my students, Mr. Malfoy.” McGonagall’s voice rang out, and a moment later she appeared at the top of the staircase, her emerald robes swirling behind her. “I will send you and Potter supplies.”
And he was getting so thin. There were hollows under his ribs, and his veins stood out purple against the skin of his forearms. His muscles flexed and slid as he moved with graceful precision, like a trained dancer.
The waiter smiled back, and Draco noticed his eyes were a pale green, like seaglass. “I think you could
Beside Draco, Potter’s blood was rising in his face, his heart had sped up again, and Draco could see the moisture his breath had left in the air. He licked his lips.
him. Declared unilaterally that he’d risk everything. The moment they’d shared, through the bond, battling through the cadre of guards that faced them, was enough to assail Harry’s fears, to show him that Draco was all-in.
of rain hitting the top of the prison. Saw only the sunlight through his window as it got weaker and weaker, until the automatic fluorescent lights kicked on.
But even if Draco hadn’t been a vampire, he could always tell where Potter was. It was like an obnoxious sixth sense, some lingering clairvoyance.
The cowboy’s eyes twinkled. “I’m mighty pleased to hear that, Mr. Malfoy. And this must be your cousin—Abraham—”
Draco shook his head. He needed to focus. Harry was lying on his bed, unconscious. Draco had managed to Disapparate them both out of the bar and into the Hog’s Head, and then it had been a simple levitation spell through the darkness.
“I’m not a Legilimens.” Hermione said. “I just have common sense. And we’re going together, or not at all. So
For the first time, a look of pure anguish crossed Harry’s face. The sight almost made Draco drop his wand, almost made him rush in and take Harry in his arms, smash his lips to his again, because it was the only thing that ever felt right.
Harry hadn’t visited the portrait of Ariana Dumbledore since the Battle of Hogwarts. He hadn’t even bothered to reopen the passageway. In fact, he would have felt better if no one had ever disturbed her at all.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Madame Dijikstra said, placing a placating hand on Draco’s arm. “I can assure you that we have made progress. We’ve simply had to make—adjustments to our earlier timeline.”
It didn’t matter; his father had rushed to the gate anyway, his wand and the moonlight lighting his way, not even bothering to comment on Draco’s inability to create a corporeal Patronus, an ability the rest of his family had easily recovered after Voldemort’s death.
And when Harry finally said “Yes,” and Draco he got to his feet and pulled Harry into a kiss, it wasn’t the shouts of the photographers, the gasps of Hermione and Ron, or the murmurs Harry made against his mouth, that he heard. He didn’t hear the adoration, or the disapproval, or even Luna’s, calm and steady,
“Nothing, Harry okay? I’m a bloodsucking monster, which you’ve probably thought since I was eleven anyway, so—”
Even asleep, Malfoy carried a tension in his shoulders. Harry half-expected his eyes to snap open, for him to spring into action.
“The people who took Harry and Ron. I’m a monster, Granger. And I’m going to be starving when we get there.”
“Yes,” McGonagall said. “It seems that you could be, were you to be in a place heavily trafficked, like Kings Cross station, recently.”
Draco’s blood went cold at how close he’d come. He’d been dimly aware of something amiss, some voice at the back of his mind telling him to pay attention. Then he’d noticed that the noises Potter had been making, those noises that lit his entire body afire, had stopped.
Draco started down the stairs first, hurrying so that he was several steps ahead of the others. The staircase descended through the center of an opulent lounge. Golden carpeting adorned the floors, and the walls had tasteful, elegant paintings of wizards and magical creatures. The figures in the paintings blinked at him sedately as he descended, seemingly unbothered by his presence.
“I bet he’ll lock his doors and stay inside, and set one of those ridiculous peacocks on the Muggle postman.” Harry said. “Maybe he won’t come back at all.”
Draco hadn’t fucked him like he loved him. He hadn’t fucked him like someone who wanted a life with him, someone who wanted everything they’d seen in each other’s eyes, everything they’d felt the past few months. He’d fucked him like a dying man on his way to the gallows.
Draco had stood in the corner, inspecting his nails and ensuring that there was no blood left anywhere else on his person, doing his best to look unbothered by the fact that everyone seemed to be ignoring him. Thankfully, Hermione easily redirected all of the questions aimed at the state of Madame Dijikstra.
“Enough! Of course a filthy Muggle virus wouldn’t take hold of me,” Malfoy tried to move, but the spell held him fast. “Just clean me and let me go home.”
There were so many things that Draco wanted to say in that moment, so many things he wanted to Harry to know. That Harry had brought happiness to his life when he thought he deserved nothing, that he could be content to simply watch Harry from across a room, and it would be enough, that there was no one else in the world that Draco could imagine waking up next to, that he had been in denial about love being anything but destruction, but he thought their love might just be enough to withstand anything, that he was sure and terrified all at once, and he loved him so fucking much he wasn’t sure his immortal body could contain it…
McGonagall flicked her wand, and Malfoy felt himself able to move again, but her glare froze him all the same. “You aren’t going anywhere, Mr. Malfoy.”
Harry shook his head. Thankfully, the Fiendfyre hadn’t permanently damaged the room’s magic. It had only destroyed the thousands of artifacts in the Room of Hidden Things, the bust of the troll, the glass stopper with that dark red substance…
Harry wandered over to one of the grand columns next to the bench. He leaned against it, taking his time to mull over his answer. Finally, he said, “I wanted to see how you were doing.”
Harry’s response was sudden and instant. He pulled Draco in even closer, until he could whisper in his ear.  “Drink from me, Draco. Take—whatever you want. Take it—I—please. I want you. I want it.”
“Don’t talk about that night,” Draco hissed, remembering with a flash the hatred etched on Snape’s face, the jeering laughter of the other Death Eaters as he’d fallen, and that sickening sense of horror that he’d really done it, more than the mark on his arm, the attacks on Bell and Weasley, this was it, he really couldn’t go back now. “Don’t talk about it—ever.”
“LIKE HELL.” A large figure emerged and tackled the cowboy to the ground. They rolled over on the floor, the larger figure’s red hair flying, his fists pummeling the cowboy’s head over and over.
And in a moment, Draco was gone. He dressed and left the room so fast, it was like he’d nearly DisApparated.
He usually only came here at night, when the rest of the castle was asleep. He didn’t have an Invisibility Cloak like Potter’s, of course, but he could cast a Disillusionment Charm well enough. He’d been trying for days to find a way for the Room to make what he needed.
While the cowboy was descending the stairs, another woman emerged. She was dressed in black robes, patterned in the style of snakeskin. They seemed to ripple and undulate as she moved, changing hues every time the fabric caught the light. Now golden, now green, now red.
“I don’t care, Potter!” Draco shouted. “You hear me?” Green sparks shot out of the end of his wand. “I. Don’t. Care.”
Hermione seemed to be fighting an internal war. Finally, she said. “Let’s just focus. Can you tell where Potter is?”
He was still saying it as Harry came closer, quieter and weaker each time. Harry reached him and wrapped his arms around Draco’s chest, curving his body over Draco’s, who still held his mother in his arms.
They were two young boys, journeying through the Forbidden Forest, drawing closer to each other as the darkness pressed in from all sides.
“I don’t think it works like that,” Draco said, to buy himself time. He had been seeing things, feeling things—extreme weakness, the bleak walls of a cell, iron bars, bolts of pain, startling terror, a flash of light…. “I’m not channeling his spirit.”
“Why are you acting like this? We’re—” But Harry stopped, seeing too late the coldness in Draco’s eyes, the lack of feeling that took over his countenance.
Ron got to his feet, cracking his knuckles. He swayed, as though drunk, but his blue eyes were narrowed in fury. “Let’s go, cowboy.”
When Draco was sure he was gone, he sank to his knees and sobbed, harder than he had the night of his mother’s death, when Harry had held him, murmuring into his hair, holding him together while his world broke apart around him.
“I can control myself.” Draco said, trying not to watch as the flush crept all the way down his neck. “Vampires can go weeks without blood before they start to desiccate.”
“This is Vegas.” Draco said to Hermione’s disapproving expression. “And he had such startling eyes—” In fact, they’d reminded him of Harry’s eyes. They had that ability to change color, to darken with desire or widen in surprise. And the way he’d bit his lip ring. Delicious.
notice was quite an experience as well. Especially watching him as what Draco was doing to him tore him apart, as pleasure crossed the lines of his face, magnified because he had an audience, and Potter was a show-off if he was anything else…
Asleep, he had that same air of deliberate, effortless movement. His chest rose and fell delicately, and the shadows beneath his eyes had sharpened.
Draco had thought they were together.  He kept waiting for Harry to pull him aside, or into one of the fancy hotel rooms. For an opportunity to declare what they’d both felt, to seal it with their lips and bodies. For Draco to tell Harry how sorry he was that it had taken him this long.
And Draco looked upon the face of Harry Potter for the first time since that wonderful, terrible night.
After another week, Harry could tell that Draco was getting desperately hungry again. He kept watching Harry eat, and he sounded as though he were having nightmares.
Draco had stopped feeding to grind himself against Harry, the friction pulling the most delicious noises from him, making him practically keen.
He went to the portrait of Ariana. She looked at him blankly, nearly as frozen as the Muggle photos.
"You're funny." Harry pressed on. "And you never make me work late when we work together, and you made sure I was okay in the storm, and sometimes I think--" he stopped.
“Which means you are subject to the same laws as everybody else. It is about time you learned to abide by them.”
He couldn’t finish his sentence. Draco had already pulled him out of the kitchen, raced with him up the stairs of the house until they reached a bedroom with white sheets and dark, crimson hangings across the windows.
Malfoy could tell that Harry was wrestling with the desire to be polite. “Fine,” he said finally. “Can I—”
“How? We don’t have any magic. These damned—bars—aren’t going anywhere. And Hermione—” He started to cry again. “She isn’t coming!”
“Erm,” Harry began awkwardly. He and Ron didn’t talk about Harry’s relationship with Ginny even under the best of circumstances, and how would he explain that he hadn’t so much as
whilst you were quarantined. You will cut a respectable figure for yourself and for our family. You will accept the condolences that no doubt the entirety of the gathering will offer you. And you will help me dedicate the class gift to medical research.”
The clean-up of the facility in Vegas had taken a great deal of forensics, paperwork, and interrogations, which Harry had volunteered to oversee, of course. Hermione and Ron took up flanking positions beside him, and it had been a treat, to see the American president, who had always claimed to be a more powerful wizard than any Brit, defer to the Chosen One’s accusing glare.
They were tired and sweaty from wall ball, and Draco was laying on the floor, staring up at the ceiling. His white t-shirt was a little see-through, stuck to him with sweat.  Lately, the tiniest athletic activity seemed to exhaust him.
“Now, Heath can perform magic as well as any fully trained wizard. It has been 3 days since his transfusion, since
“I just told you, Potter. Fuck off.”  Potter didn’t need to know he’d been looking at vampire anatomy, trying to figure out how much blood he could ration before he started to desiccate.
“Perhaps not.” McGonagall said, and her voice was almost sympathetic as she continued. “But they will not have the answers you seek.”
Harry’s eyes met his. The other’s were wide and almost completely black, and there was some dark red substance staining his lips. Harry felt a sudden urge to reach for them, run his fingers along those lips, see what they
If Harry was being serious, Draco was going to make sure. He wouldn’t be made a fool of by Harry Potter.
And the pain raged through, replaying every word, every kiss, every look between them that spoke of something terrifying and awe-inspiring, growing even more with every passing second, like the sun breaking through the clouds.
Even he and Ron had reached their breaking point—but with Malfoy—he wouldn’t last twenty-four hours.
“D’you think Hermione’s coming to get us?” Ron turned to Harry after running his hands along a wall, his expression hopeful.
“We’re going to break out of here,” Harry got to his feet and looked around the cell, swaying a little as he did so. He felt dizzy and weak, and his heart seemed to flutter in his chest. “There’s got to be a way. Come on, help me.” He ran his hand along the iron bars and the solid stone wall, hoping for some jolt of electricity, a buzz of another presence. Some indication that his magic had not entirely deserted him.
Harry drank, and something about the rush of the alcohol, and the way Draco's eyes were still glittering, the splay of those hands against the red velvet, gave him the courage to do what he did next.
Hermione’s plan turned out to be casting a Tracking Charm on Malfoy’s book, which she’d managed to do while leaving for the loo. Malfoy, too distracted by Potter’s nosiness, hadn’t even noticed.
Draco pulled Harry to his feet, so that they were nearly chest to chest. Harry was a little shorter than Draco, and when he looked up, it was to see Draco's soft, thin mouth, to feel his chest rise and fall against his own.
He got up and walked over to Harry, then took his hand. Harry tried to ask a question, but Draco shushed him, which was probably for the best. At the touch of his hand, Harry's brain had completely shut off. He didn't think he could string a sentence together.
“What if I didn’t use public transportation?” Draco said, ignoring this. “I could go in, come right back. Easy.”
But he was interrupted by Hermione, who rushed into his arms and kissed him through the blood that still trickled from the wound in her forehead.
“You’re just upset because I’m better than you!” Ron smirked, directing one of his knights to begin beating up Harry’s bishop.
Malfoy took his mouth off of the man’s neck and looked Harry up and down, a sly grin curling across his features. “Harry,” he purred.
But now, all Draco was aware of was Zabini’s ignorance of his mother’s passing. How could someone be insensitive to an event that shook the entire Earth, that rearranged the atoms of Draco’s body? How could he be so cavalier about such a catastrophe?
And as the mug of hot chocolate that Harry had so meticulously crafted for Draco cooled in front of him, Harry started to wonder again whether death from exposure would be preferable to being snowed in with Draco Malfoy. They had been sitting at the same table in  silence, listening to the indie music playlist repeat itself, and Harry felt like he might spontaneously combust from the awkwardness.
“And I cast a few Confusion spells to make sure they thought I wandered into the desert and died.” Hermione shrugged. “It’s simple really, just a matter of concentration.”
“He’s late,” Harry paced anxiously around the Atrium, leading to not a few camera flashes from the assembled press, as well as a sympathetic glance from Hermione. “We were supposed to make our statement at seven. It’s seven thirty.”
But the Sun was shining, and it was a warm day for March. The very least he could do was spend some time outdoors on his broom.
Harry looked at him for a long moment, his chest aching. "Well," he said quietly. "I don't think you're a placeholder, if that's any consolation."
Harry tried to steel himself against the feelings rising up in him, tried to let Draco walk out the door. He knew that it was different this time, that if Draco walked out, he would never come back. What had happened between them in quarantine, the electric moments they’d shared in Vegas, would dissipate into memories, clouded over by cobwebbed nostalgia and circumstance.
“Glad I finally managed to shut you up,” Draco spat, before dashing down one of the moving staircases.
Finally, Draco snatched the lube out of Harry’s hand and slicked up his fingers. “C’mere,” he whispered, and Harry positioned himself precisely between Draco’s legs like he’d been waiting for this all along, like this was something they’d done a thousand times before, and it seemed that way except for the fucking
It wasn’t that it was difficult for him to stop. It was just that every time he drank someone else’s blood, he grew frustrated and angry. And he drank deeper and deeper, trying to convince himself that it was all he needed. That he wasn’t missing anything.
“You aren’t taking me seriously,” Trelawney sniffed, tossing back her hair. “It is an affront, Harry, though not an unusual one. We Seers have always been ignored, always mocked and ridiculed. It is, alas, our Fate.”
The people who died for him, even when he didn’t ask it, even when he would have given anything to have taken their place.
“You know, I’m so relieved that the myth about vampires and mirrors turned out not to be true.” Draco shuddered. “I don’t know what I would have done.”
And it was Malfoy who had discovered the broken Vanishing Cabinet, Malfoy who had mended it and used it to let the Death Eaters into the school…
But for Harry and Draco, this moment was an iridescent, gleaming glass landscape, set upon the mantle. Nothing less than a snow globe, frozen in shining time.
They’d been flying for five hours, and Draco was starting to get used to the occasional stretches of turbulence, the uncomfortable seating. And his stomach
It's been months since the last time Draco and Harry saw each other at the party. Draco's an intern for Minister Shacklebolt, and Harry is an Auror with Ron and Hermione. Feat. way too many Twilight references, because it's just too funny. Hermione being the only useful member of the golden trio.
Draco swore. “How long is this going to be?” Draco ran a hand through his hair, feeling his chest tighten.
“You’ll have to get in line.”  Draco said, unable to keep the contempt from his voice. Hermione backed up slightly, sensing his change in tone, so that she was a fair distance from Bolton and Dijikstra. Her beard had nearly disappeared, and she seemed to be shrinking, the hair on her scalp expanding. Her hand drifted, ever so casually, to her pocket.
“I’ve spoken to her Healers,” Hermione interrupted. “She has only hours left. Is this how you want to spend that time, Draco? Out here, trying to go against her wishes? Or with her, to say—”
“I love you,” he whispered, and he pulled Harry in for another kiss, his hands gentle, stroking at his neck and his chest, still licking up the traces of blood that trickled from the wound in his neck.
Well, his obsessions had always proved correct, hadn’t it? Any time there was something Dark or dangerous going on, Malfoy was probably at the bottom of it. Laughing the whole time.
“Surely wizards have a cure for this sort of thing,” Harry had heard about the virus from Hermione, but most of the students sneered at Muggle technology, and were woefully uninformed on non-Wizarding current events. Only the Muggleborns really kept in touch, but Harry got the impression that their reiteration of Muggle News hardly earned them social points.
But the humor was short lived. When she arrived, her eyebrows were set closely together, and her mouth was a thin, firm line.
Ariana sighed. “Sometimes we can’t accept the things that are most obvious to us. Albus certainly knew that.”
going on in Draco’s body, the way every nerve ending caught alight as Harry clenched around Draco’s fingers, the soft groans Harry let out that made Draco want to die, the way they fit together when Harry finally rode him.
Harry had arrived to see Lucius pacing the gate, shouting abuse at Draco. And then Draco had knelt before his father, his shoulders slumped in anguish. Lucius Malfoy’s face was etched in disgust.
“You may as well come in,” Harry said finally, opening the door wider. When Draco brushed by him, he shivered.
Eventually, he’d managed to control it. He’d snuck the books up to his room, the ones from the depths of his father’s library, done even more research at Hogwarts. He knew the rules: spell a piece of jewelry to walk in the Sun. Don’t get too upset, or your fangs will show. Stay in big populations, where you won’t be noticed. Replenish the blood when you’re done. Wipe their memory. Heal the bitemarks. Disappear.
“My mum died,” Draco muttered. “Git.” This was exactly why he didn’t want to go to this party. Too many people only grateful for what they had gained. Too many people joyful at reuniting.
He wondered if Draco was dancing on the balcony, his tongue shoved down the throat of some poor girl, one he’d probably told all manner of sweet things, running her hands through that bright blonde hair, feeling his lips pressed against her neck—
He’d said goodbye to Ron and Hermione at breakfast, where Hermione had spent the majority of her time scrolling through her phone, reading the news of the corona virus as it spread throughout the UK.
Harry had barely looked at him once they emerged from the facility, panting and bloodstained.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione had begun to send Patronuses and Summon owls, and within hours, the American and British authorities had assembled in one of Treasure Island’s famed conference rooms to shout at each other.
And then they were kissing. Kissing like their lives depended on it, like they might disappear if they fell apart. Draco’s fangs caught on the edge of Harry’s lips, and he flicked his wand to stop the kettle as it screamed so that they would be the only noise, inside and out, bursting through his chest, a dam that had suddenly broken, a tidal wave of warmth rushing through him, so intense it brought tears to his eyes.
But the assembled press, the onlookers, Harry and Draco’s exes, ready to pop out of the woodwork any moment….
“Hogwarts will always be a safe place,” McGonagall agreed. “Though I can’t imagine families won’t want to see their children now more than ever. Has anyone—how severe are the symptoms?”
And he couldn’t help but remember the Battle of Hogwarts, when Lucius and Narcissa had not even bothered to defend themselves, simply running through the crowd, between the fighters, screaming for their son.  “
Draco could smell his blood, feel the heat that radiated from his skin. He could hear Potter’s heart speed up, a withering drum of rhythm and excitement.
And there was Malfoy, pacing in front of a seemingly blank stretch of wall, his face contorted in concentration.
The witch’s eyes flashed. “I admire your persistence, even if it is misplaced. Until next time, Mr. Potter.”
Kissing and biting and licking until it took all their strength just to lie next to each other on the bed.
Harry’s mouth was wide open, surprise and adoration lighting his eyes, and Draco knew that even the most magical photo would never capture the wonder blossoming inside his heart.
He’d gathered that the Ministry was still working on hunting down some of Voldemort’s more avid followers, that there was another sect threatening Muggle rights in America, that Potter had been designated to head this task force…
Draco didn’t speak until Longbottom had left the room, casting a suspicious glance over his shoulder as he went. The last thing he needed was
He lowered his wand, but Harry didn’t step back. They faced each other, the two young wizards, who for all their differences, all the conflict that separated them, were now in exactly the same place…
Harry didn’t know what to say to that. He, too, was trying to reconcile with all the lives he couldn’t save, the lives he
“What are you doing?” Harry shouted as Ron walked out of his cell, his face smooth and blank, tears still falling from his eyes. “Where are you taking him?” The cowboy followed him, his wand held aloft like a puppeteer.
“You’re not supposed to know about that.” Hermione looked from side to side, as though she were worried about them being seen. “Can we go somewhere?”
Draco looked at him, and his eyes had turned gray, the color of a sky that threatened snowfall. Magical. Fantastic.
Draco looked into her brown eyes, remembering all the times he’d spat at her. Called her ‘Mudblood’ and worse. Laughed while Snape mocked her, done his best to make her feel small.
"I just mean--" Harry waved his hands emphatically "--the whole idea that all we do is try to fill the void inside ourselves with parties and frivolity while our lives are empty--it's just not how most people are. Every Hemingway book is like, "They go to parties and nothing happens."
Draco shook his head, shutting the front door behind him and locking it with a spell. He had to see if Harry was alright. It Harry truly wanted him gone, he would be.
Draco took one last look at Harry before disappearing through it, wondering if he was making the right choice.
our magic. We are simply taking it back. Where weaker people would see theft, I see justice. The scales are balanced, and the magical world remains forever separate from the nonmagical.”
They always used to spend parties like this: ensconced in a single room, sprawled around each other on the floor, dizzy with smoke and drunk on Firewhiskey. All of the Slytherin parties, the Yule Ball, any of the Hogwarts celebrations, had ended that way, with Draco and his mates in some room, laughing themselves hoarse, forgetting everything but the night.
So why all this time in the library? Why was he always pacing the Slytherin common room late at night, as though puzzling out some great mystery?
“That might just be the meanest thing you’ve ever said to me,” said Harry absently. There were sections on water kelpies, dragons, vampires, werewolves…Malfoy had never been interested in such things before. Harry was fairly certain he was still repulsed at the idea of part human creatures, just like Voldemort had taught him.
Hermione looked over at Draco and her face soften a bit. It was like she could tell by his voice that he was being sincere. It didn’t take long before her expression changed to being cold again as she didn’t want to be fooled so quickly before there was any proof of Draco
“Of course, I mean all of that. I mean, why wouldn’t I mean it?” Draco tilted his head slightly, getting slightly lost in Harry’s bright green eyes.
Harry wore a robe of bottle green that went well with his eyes. Cedric went with a traditional black tuxedo for the dance. There were 3 groups of people at the Ball. The first group was looking over at Cedric when he entered the room to see who he went to the dance with. The second group was looking over at Harry once he and Ron separated so Ron could go find where his date was. Some thought for a while that Harry and Ron went together, but once they saw Ron with his actual date, they realized Harry was going with someone else. Intrigued they watched to see who was going with the infamous Harry Potter. The third group was of people who didn’t notice nor did they care.
Draco and Harry begin to talk about anything and everything as they go over and sit on the picnic blanket that they always leave laid out on the ground. They smiled and had a few laughs as Draco was acting silly to get Harry to laugh. After a while they held hands and look out at the stars and Draco would occasionally kiss Harry’s cheek because he could and mostly because he liked to see Harry’s cute reaction. Harry's neck would tense up like a turtle going back in its shell while smiling. Draco would chuckle at this expression which would make Harry slightly upset and telling Draco to stop teasing him.
Cedric’s soft smile just melted Harry’s heart as he began to blush before awkwardly saying, “cool, great, I’ll see you around.” When walking away he tripped on his rob, but at least he didn’t faceplant. Harry just laughs it off and quickly walked away to go find his friends.
Draco went to his room and quickly got everything that he needed for school packed away. He had sent out someone to go get his book for him as he didn’t want to interact with people just yet. He really didn’t want to get in a dual with someone and get put back under house arrest again. He was getting excited to see some of his friends. Luckily for Draco, he didn’t have to wait long as he had to be on the Hogwarts Express tomorrow. He got his letter around noon and he spent the rest of the day preparing what he was going to say and do tomorrow. He even planned his outfit for tomorrow. He needed to wear something that wouldn’t make his hair pop out in a crowd and a hood would be too suspicious.
“You know, about wanting to be good. Ever since I woke up near the end of the war, I just knew that you were going to change.” Harry turn and looked into Draco’s eyes. “I know that you helped wake me up Draco,” Harry said with a small smile on his face.
But there was that one week where Harry couldn’t see anyone because he was stuck in detention with Dolores Umbridge.
Draco was one of the last to get off the train and once he entered The Great Hall all eyes were on him. It was obvious that people were very wary of him and very angry that he was even there. So many people wished that he would have been sent to Azkaban or at the very least would have just stayed home. Draco kept his head held high, not wanting to be seen as weak, all out of habit, and took his seat at the Slytherin table.
Harry wipes tears from his eyes and quickly got up. He turned away from Cedric and started running to find the cup. He was going to get this cup for Cedric. Harry truly felt like Cedric deserved this cup, but with him, out of the race, Harry was going to have to win it for him.
“C-Cedric!? How… how could you- you of all people. How could you do this to me!?” Harry yelled and he clenched his fists.
“I know all of you were probably not expecting me to be here today and I completely get that. I just wanted to say… I am so very sorry for all the things that I have said and done to the people in this school. To be honest I was all talk and some of you already know that. I have already sent my apologies in the form of letters to the people I have affected the most, but I just want to say it again. I am sorry for making fun of people and calling some mudbloods, especially you Hermione. I am sorry to all of the Weasleys for making fun of them,” Draco paused before looking over at Harry Potter. “I am also extremely sorry to Potter. I know I didn’t send you a letter, I just didn’t know what to say. I was a thorn in your side just because of the people you hung out with and because I was honestly jealous of you. I hope that one day you all can forgive me. Believe it or not, I really want to change for the better, I just hope you all will let me… Thank you.” Draco stepped away from the podium and went back to his seat.
Cedric saw Harry after a while of walking in the maze. Cedric was relieved to see Harry, he thought the one who set off the red sparks to get out of the maze was him. A dark voice in the maze started whispering in Cedric’s ear, trying to get him to fight Harry. Ignoring it Cedric called for Harry’s name before getting hit with such an overwhelming amount of pain.
“What are you talking about? There is nothing wrong with my hand,” Harry says as he shows Hermione his right hand. Hermione rolled her eyes and grabs Harry’s left wrist and held it up. The sleeve of this sweatshirt fell revealing the scars from his hand.
“What if it was of my own doing? What would you say then?” Harry asked. He was mainly asking this because he is genially interested in what Draco’s response would be.
Draco had no idea if Harry knew at all that he tried his best to save Harry. Draco tried everything he could to save Harry Potter without anyone knowing and Narcissa was in on it. Draco had no idea why he did what he did at first. After a while though, he realized that he needed Harry around and things would be horrible without him. If there was anyone that Draco was going to learn to trust to help make him a better person, it would be Harry Potter.
“I never hated you! Even before this year! I can’t believe I am going to admit this, but—I never hated you, I thought I did for a long time, but I learned that it was more jealously than hate…” Draco was now blushing. He couldn’t believe that he actually admitted that he was jealous, but here we are.
Recently people in the Slytherin house have been making fun of Draco and making hateful comments about Draco being gay. Draco wasn’t sure how they found out about it, but he can only assume they snooped through his things. Ever since people in his house started being homophobic, Draco has always been suspicious of others whispering to each other. He was worried they were all about him trying to turn Harry gay or something like that. Harry snapped his fingers in front of Draco’s face. “Sorry, I was… zoning out. What were you saying again?” Draco looked over at Harry.
“I’m sorry, but I don’t know anything. My father almost completely stopped talking to me. He only talked to me when he had to, but it had nothing about what was going on. Not even my mom would tell me anything without getting in a lot of trouble. I am just in the dark as you are. Sorry, I am not much help,” Draco said with a slightly sad voice. He felt bad he wasn’t any help at this moment.
On Draco’s way to Potions, he got pulled by the arm, forcing Draco to turn and face who pulled his arm. The one who pulled Draco’s arm was Ron. Ron then grabbed Draco by the collar and pulled him closer. “I don’t know what you are up to, but we will find out. I don’t believe you for a second that you have changed… No matter how convincing it is…” Ron says as he glares into Draco’s eye.
Class when by as normal. Ron kept his eyes on Harry and Draco as they passed each other notes back and forth. Ron was being more protective than usual since Draco joined their friend group, at least in class. When class was over Ron quickly “pulled” Harry out of the class, but Harry still managed to slip Draco a note without Ron seeing.
Cedric was in shock from what just happened. No one had ever broken up with him, it was usually him breaking up with them. Then again it was going to happen eventually since Cedric couldn’t bring himself to break off the relationship since Harry looked the happiest, he has ever been. Cedric was waiting on Harry to lose feeling for Cedric, but getting caught with what he was doing came first.
Harry was extremely shocked; this was his first kiss. There were no longer any butterflies in his stomach as they were going crazy like rockets. His heart was pounding so loud he could no longer hear his thoughts. As soon as Harry registered what was going on, he kisses Cedric back. If Harry didn’t know he was at least slightly gay before, kissing Cedric confirmed that he was. Harry quickly got ahead of himself and asked Cedric to be his first boyfriend. Cedric chuckled and nodded.
The person to take Draco’s place in “Inquisitorial Squad” who ends up catching Harry was non-other than Pansy. She wanted to bust them for taking Draco away from her. Draco on the other hand was the one to get any details on what the Slytherins were up to, but they still managed to get caught because of Cho getting the truth serum and spilling the beans. The bad dreams that Harry has do still have Cedric in it but more of the cheating since he didn’t die in the 4th book.
Draco was Harry’s support system alone with Ron and Hermione. Harry had to remind Ron that he was still his best friend. Ron and Harry never had their fight where Ron stopped speaking to Harry. The reason this never happened was that Harry could open up and chat with Draco to get a second opinion on how he was acting and anytime Harry felt like he was alone in this fight Draco and Hermione reminded Harry that he wasn’t alone. Hermione could be a little harsh by the way she told Harry that he was not alone in this fight because of how irritated it was that Harry talked like he had to fight Voldemort alone. Draco had to be a calm middle ground and helped Harry come to terms with the fact that no matter what he did, he wouldn’t have to fight this alone. Draco also mentioned that this was just as much of other people’s battle as it was Harry’s.
“Cedric, are you okay?!” There was a panic in Harry’s voice. He kneeled on the ground and placed his hand on Cedric’s cheek.
Pansy just huffed after being told off by Goyle and stayed silently angry for the rest of the evening. Draco was not surprised by this at all and just ignoring her occasional
H- ‘Let’s have a picnic for dinner! Meet me at the Astronomy tower at 6 p.m. I want to hang out without having Ron or Hermione breathe down our necks and watching us. Also, I will not be taking “No” as an answer. See you later Draco.’
Harry and Cedric agreed to keep it a secret that they were going with each other because they wanted to shock everyone. They didn’t want to follow the “norm” of it being a girl and a guy at the dance together. There was no way Harry was going to wear a dress anyways. Cedric did try to see if Harry would shock people even more, but Harry was too uncomfortable with the thought of
“Thanks,” Harry says as he gives off a week's smiles and starts heading over to the trees. The first tree he went to look at was the one he saw Draco in last year, the same tree he was under when he was turned into a white ferret. Bingo. That was the tree Draco was just chilling in. He was reading a book and eating a green apple.
“Well, it depends on what you mean by that because I have a feeling you don’t mean it exactly how you said it,” Harry states.
Potter sat back, comprehension breaking across his features. “We’ve been in quarantine. How often do you need to—”
When they’d been dressing for bed (both facing their own respective walls), Harry had caught a glimpse of Malfoy’s torso in the full-length mirror.
“His family—“ Harry’s fingers twitched. “Is it his blood? Is he trying to save her? Is that why he tried to leave?”
As Harry watched, the dot that represented Malfoy got up and began to pace the library, going to a shelf and back again. All of a sudden, it started moving into the hall.
Draco thought he saw Harry move, but he willed himself to look back at Professor McGonagall. He didn’t know how to explain what had happened last night. He wasn’t sure he
He had to admit, everyone looked like they were having a great time. The press of bodies was packed so tightly, it was difficult to find room. Couples were making out all over the dance floor, and he was certain that the party wouldn’t end here for most of them.
There had been a chance of snow this weekend, but Harry hadn’t taken it seriously. The forecasters said it might snow nearly every winter, and they were always wrong. Nothing like that was going to happen, especially in Texas.
Draco set his jaw. “Message received.” Draco took a step back toward the door, but Harry moved around the kitchen bar, until he was facing Draco, exactly dueling distance apart. “Tell Granger for me that our deal’s off.” Draco said. “And I’ll see her in the debates.”
The cowboy waved his wand, and the desert floor in front of them shimmered to reveal a staircase, well-lit and ornate, descending below in a tight spiral.
“I don’t want to make you uncomfortable or get you involved… you will only be angry,” Draco stated really not wanting to get Harry involved.
As soon as Draco heard those words, he felt so bad. He didn’t want Harry to feel like this. Draco gently rubbed circled on Harry’s back whispering that everything was going to be okay. “He can’t hurt you anymore. I’ve got you.”
And now he had to stay in a huge population, just to blend in, just to make sure no one came after him with wooden stakes or pitchforks, fake it and smile and act like everything was fine for the rest of his immortal existence.
"You ever read those romance novels?" He tipped his head to the side, and took the bottle back. His fingers fumbled over it a little, and Harry realized that Draco was already tipsy.
Why did Draco have this effect on him? It wasn't like they were friends. He wasn’t even that mean, he was just... indifferent.
“It’s a good idea to have access to food from the Hog’s Head.” Harry said after a few moments. “Aberforth can—”
Of course Potter had to follow him. He’d been too crazed with hunger to bother hiding where he was going, and Potter always had that obnoxious affinity for sheer dumb luck.
Hermione picked up one of the hairs and held it to the light. “And I assume they know me too well for me not to be disguised?”
“I remember everything that happened between us, Malfoy.” Harry’s eyes were suddenly that near-glowing green again, and Draco felt curiously vulnerable as he walked over to the bench, towering over him. “I remember every second.”
Ron crumpled on the floor in a heap, sobs wracking through him, “Hermione,” he kept murmuring, over and over.
Lucius had chosen to walk away when Draco got like this over the past month or so. Even during the end of the quarantine, when Draco refused to take a walk outside, to visit his mother’s grave, just below the peonies that she’d insisted Lucius plant just in front of the living room window when they had gotten married, no matter that they “ruined the whole aesthetic.”
It  painted a curious picture: Minerva McGonagall, the brightest witch of her Hogwarts class, looking for all the world like one of those Muggle pet fish.
What was he supposed to do now? He could hardly tell Potter what he’d been trying to do in the Room of Requirement. And he was so…
Malfoy took that news with a surge of relief. With Potter all the way across the world, there was no chance they’d run into each other.
One day, Harry caught him coming back after sneaking out through the secret passage. His hair was ruffled, but he looked as pale and sickly as ever. “They closed Quarantine.” Draco said. “How’s that for ironic?”
Ron looked sheepish. “What do we do with this?” he held the rod gingerly, as though afraid it would go off.  “We’re—”
Harry drew his knees up to his chest and wrapped his hands around them.  “Still. You can’t just go into Hogsmeade every time you’re hungry. What are you going to do?”
“Because—” Harry stopped. Something was holding his breath in, keeping his words caught in his chest.
He loved that temper, especially the way Potter’s simmering anger sent a burst of energy through his own veins.
“Ugh. Fuck me.” Malfoy’s voice seemed to come from far away; Harry was feeling at the man’s neck now for the wound, two puncture marks that leaked the blood like water through a sieve. He started a spell—
"I don't like having something I said to someone in confidence become everyone’ favorite daytime soap opera." He moved his bishop and took out another of Harry's pawns. "Check."
He made his way through the crowd as Malfoy’s lips moved against the man’s neck, his blonde hair streaked with sweat. He was wearing a silk dressing gown over his pajamas, but he made it look elegant and sensual as he reached up to pull the other man closer.
Voldemort had made him a vampire against his will, in the final moments of the Battle of Hogwarts. The Dark Lord had been raving in the Forbidden Forest, his mind already half-broken from the destruction of his Horcruxes, waiting frantically for Potter to arrive, and he’d wanted ‘a bit of fun.’
"Last year." Blaise rolled his eyes. "He's decided that since she doesn't love him, he can't ever love, blah blah blah...your basic indie rom com moody bullshit."
Harry wondered whether he should step back through the wall. News of his whereabouts would certainly spread, and he couldn’t bear to see another article in the
He looked at the wall above him, tried spells to carve it out, to open it from that end. Perhaps he was just exhausted. He pointed his wand at a piece of rock that had broken apart from the wall. “
Ron clambered to his feet and began to feel the walls around his cell, but Harry could tell by the heaviness in his steps that he found it difficult, too.
“Because I don’t know where he is.” Hermione put a hand in her hair, which was frizzing like it always did when she got too excited. “He and Ron went into the desert three days ago, and I can’t find them. I’ve tried all the usual spells, but there’s nothing to show where they went! They’ve vanished!”
you..” he traied off.  “Right this way.” He made a sweeping motion, and ushered Draco and Hermione through the door.
He’d gone to Lucius to see if they needed help, but Mr. Malfoy had already contacted McGonagall, who was absolutely livid that Harry had flouted the rules.
And he didn’t know if Draco heard it, if that was what he felt as he grabbed Harry’s chin and wrenched his head to the side, sinking his fangs into Harry’s neck. Harry’s bones melted in pleasure, and he sank forward onto Draco.
Already, the lack of magic inside of him made him feel old and exhausted. Harry fought to keep his eyes open, afraid that closing them would mean they never opened again.
Harry carefully scooted back in his cell to where he’d flung his wand against the wall in frustration, after his magic had continued to fail. He picked it up and held it close to his chest, feeling it warm against his heart.
Not only was he incredibly loud, panting and clattering his way down the hallway, but Draco could hear his heartbeat.
The figure across from him, a mound of maroon and orange, finally stirred. Ron unwound his lanky limbs and pulled himself to a sitting position, using the bars as leverage. “M ‘fine.” Ron mumbled. “I just wanna go home.”
Malfoy hadn’t even intimated that he’d heard Harry at first, until the third time he’d caught Harry staring at him from across the room. “Jealous of my perfect features, Potter?” he tilted his face up, so that the light illuminated his aquiline features.  “It’s what comes from not having a mother like yours.”
That was ridiculous; they were mortal enemies, antagonists. And Harry was in love with Ginny Weasley, had been since he’d seen her kissing Dean, and his affection for her roared to life inside of him…
Draco hadn’t expected Potter’s name to have such an effect on him. But the way she’d said his name, like she’d just spoken to him yesterday, like she would a brother, made him flinch. “Let me guess,” he began, his eyes roving up and down Hermione’s body, “You’re drawn in by my velvety darkness. And you’ve caught me, Granger—'
Finally, Ron kicked the cowboy in the knee, and he relaxed his grip just long enough for Ron to break free. He took the scepter and pressed it into the cowboy’s forehead. The man screamed in pain, but Ron only smiled and pushed it harder.
Of course, this only made Potter watch him with even more interest. Draco could practically see the cogs in his head turning. He took a long swallow of pumpkin juice.  It tasted like sawdust, like every other human food always had, but it was better than skipping the meals.
“Malfoy?” Harry’s wand was pointed precisely at his chest, like he could hear where he was from the hallway, and he didn’t lower it, even when Malfoy held up his own empty hands defensively. “What in Merlin’s name are you doing here?”
“No, it’s fine.” Harry felt curiously adrift from the both of them. He’d already accepted that he’d be spending the break alone, and he wasn’t sure if he was ready to change everything. Ready to face the Weasleys, who were supposed to be spending the holiday grieving. Or Hermione’s parents, who wanted only to reconnect with the daughter they’d thought hadn’t existed for nearly a year…
“This is just research on Dark creatures,” Harry said, disappointed. “It’s for Professor Sheen’s class.”
What was this new disease? How dangerous was it? And what would happen to the school if it continued?
Harry reached out, but his fingers brushed only air.  He got a flash of impressions: Hermione’s exasperated expression, the thrill of a kill, the sweet taste of blood.
The cowboy looked at him, his brow furrowed. “You’re supposed to be one of the greatest wizards who ever lived. What will happen, I wonder, when that’s all gone?”
." Harry rolled his eyes. Draco was so paranoid. No wonder everyone annoyed him. "Sidewalks. Boots." he held up his foot. "I'm golden."
"Yeah, I'm not a fan." Harry could feel himself getting warmer inside, and took another sip of the vodka. It was starting to taste a little better now, though he still wished he had a chaser. "There are still things you can live for."
A wizard in Surrey had manage to manufacture a vaccine in the first week of May. Within weeks, enough of the population had been inoculated that quarantine had lifted. Even in the mMggle world, people had started to poke their heads out into the world again. Friends embraced on the streets. Lovers reunited.
“Ignore him,” Pansy Parkinson snapped. “Blaise, why don’t you stick that perfect nose in someone else’s business?”
She towed him down the hallway and toward a flight of stairs. He clattered after her, neither of them speaking. Draco was getting a little winded. For someone so small, Granger was
Harry thought. No matter what McGonagall said, he considered it an absolute injustice that Malfoy wasn’t serving time in a jail cell right now.
Harry sat down on his bed, feeling his heart race as he tried to form the words. Draco went still, frozen, the ball still clutched in one long-fingered hand.
There was disgust and hatred etched on Draco’s face, and a tenderness so whole and complete that Harry’s knees started to shake. “Potter,” he whispered, and his wand hand shook.
No one in the Order would ever trust a Malfoy, Draco’s brief friendship with Potter notwithstanding. The act had been dropped as soon as the Ministry had resumed normal duties; Shacklebolt detested propaganda, and he didn’t want a Malfoy within spitting distance of his system of government.
Harry felt a trickle of hope surge into his limbs. How could they have made such a foolish mistake? They could escape easily now, bring the whole Ministry back to dismantle whatever horrendous operation these American wizards had going.
I'm having a great time with this. Hopefully y'all are too. Shout out to @tearinmyarc for editing, especially since I'm currently out of my mind on Benadryl bc pollen is a BITCH.
Lucius’ nostrils flared. “Our protections—they don’t detect the virus. What if you’ve been exposed to it?”
“I’m assuming that’s why you’re doing this.” Draco looked around. “Do you want me to kiss you? It would make that Weasley girl
What if Harry just wanted to move on because he knew, like Draco always had, that there was no point in a love that sweeping, that all-encompassing?
And here they were. He could see some red dirt through the narrow windows above their cells. They were underground, their cells seemingly carved into the rock itself and festooned with narrow iron bars across from them. Their wands, Ron’s Deluminator, and all of their other magical items were gone.
“And he also saved your life!” Hermione’s left hand twitched, and Harry knew she was thinking of the
"If there's a power outage, there's a water outage not far behind it. He kicked the mop bucket to Harry. "Fill this up. I'm going to make sure we have enough drinking water stocked."
Now, Harry stretched out on his bed and stared at the ceiling. His stomach growled; Aberforth had sent over food, but he was still hungry. It seemed that he was always making up for those years of near-starvation at the Dursleys whenever he was at Hogwarts. The thought of being stuck in this room with little food and no entertainment for an indefinite period reminded him uncomfortably of the time he, Ron, and Hermione had spent hunting Horcruxes.
“Fat chance, Hermione,” Ron mumbled around a mouthful of kippers. “Malfoy’s a whiny little bitch, and always has been.” He took a massive swallow and continued. “I wouldn’t put it past him to finish his master’s little mission posthumously.”
Harry didn't know what made him do it, but he reached across to grab Draco's chin and force his head up, so that he was looking Harry in the eyes "Do I look afraid to you?" Harry asked.
Technically, Draco Malfoy wasn’t one of those trusted few.  But Percy Weasley had left a drawer in his office unlocked the night they all returned, and Draco couldn’t help himself. Potter’s file was
“You couldn’t help yourself.” His father said. “It’s perfectly understandable. It’s in your nature. You are the same as Bellatrix, or Greyback--”
“You’re doing this because you love Harry. Don’t pretend you don’t.” Hermione reached in her bag and pulled out a thermos. “Here.”
“Potter, a damsel in distress. I could never imagine.” Through the bond, Draco felt a flicker of irritation at that line.
full of pictures of Harry and his friends, crime scene photos from various cases over his time as an Auror, photos from the Battle of Hogwarts, the scene of his parents’ deaths.
Suddenly, a head popped out of the wall a few feet ahead of Harry and looked up and down the alleyway. Harry instinctively shrank back.
Harry was not afraid of his own death, but he didn’t want anyone else to die for him again, to be blasted apart defending him, to spread their hands and take the blow meant for him, to tell a joke only for it to be their last…
The Hog’s Head had even more dust than usual on its tables, and it was easy for Harry to see where Malfoy had been. He had left a clear trail through the floor, the sweep of his dressing gown an obvious sign.
“—stronger whenever you fall in love.” Hermione finished. She sat across from him and put her elbows on the table. Up close, Draco could see that she was in pretty rough shape. There was a cut across her forearm, and the ‘Mudblood’ scar stood out sharply on her skin. Her eyes had dark circles beneath them, and he was pretty sure there was dirt and leaves matted in her hair.
“And no one came for you? They just let you leave and bring backup? Tell the world of their evil plan?”
Draco glanced over at Harry. He was face down on the floor, but Draco could tell by the rise and fall of his back that he still breathed. He thought of the night before, the way Harry had clung to him, moaned his name. The longing that coursed through his blood, both Harry’s and his own, like they were feeding off each other, having finally stopped denying something they’d both felt for so long…
“I wanted to stop loving you!” Harry shouted, desperate for him not to leave, in spite of his earlier plans, in spite of what he’d decided when he’d heard the knock at the door and
“I don’t need anything from you or your filthy Mudblood friends,” Draco hissed, gathering up his papers.
Perhaps they were leaving them to rot. He hadn’t been able to bear telling Ron that they’d ‘taken care of’ Hermione, whatever that meant.
“As I was saying.,” Hermione interrupted. “There is no way to permanently remove magic from someone without killing them, and no way for magic to exist once the person hosting it has died.”
Harry grabbed his coat, unable to believe his luck, and dashed out the door, only to skid all the way into his bike, sending it, and himself, tumbling to the ground
When he arrived on the level, he spotted Malfoy in an instant. He was indeed dancing, wrapped closely around a man who was even taller than him, built like a rugby player, with a scar across his left cheek. As Harry watched, Malfoy leaned up and latched his lips onto the man’s neck. The man threw back his head in pleasure.
“You know your mother wouldn’t want that.” Lucius broke in, his voice twisted in anguish. “To become—”
Ron had sat up to watch Harry’s attempts. At his question, he shook his head. “I tried everything Hermione taught me about undoing enchantments. Everything--the cowboy and the woman came in here to watch me do it. And
He’d been ready to pounce, but Draco’s presence complicated things. What was he doing here? Who was the man with him? An accomplice? A
Malfoy always sounded so smug, so convinced that he was superior just for never bothering to come after Harry.
McGonagall shook her head. “Leaving the castle would put you, and everyone you come into contact with, in danger. You will risk exposure to the virus once again, and you could then expose anyone you come into contact with. Draco,” she said, her voice softening the tiniest bit, “The best thing you can do for your family is to stay away from them.”
He waited for the monster to erupt in his chest. The one that had emerged so viciously when he’d seen Ginny and Dean embracing in that corridor during Sixth Year. The one that assured him that Ginny had been it: is person, his soulmate. The person he was meant to love for the rest of his life.
“You could learn a thing or two from Greyback,” she chortled when she found him, guzzling at the neck of one of the Death Eaters, their blood staining the front of his collar. “He knows how to kill without being too messy.” She flicked her wand, and the body slumped against him, dead.
Draco looked over at him, frowning, as though he had forgotten he was there. "Come inside. There's no way anyone should be on the road right now."
McGonagall had shared the password with him (“Fawkes”) at the beginning of the year, but he wasn’t interested in reliving all of those memories. He just wanted to have a normal year at Hogwarts, for once. He just wanted to be a first year again, where his biggest problems were Snape giving him bad marks on his Potions exam and winning the next Quidditch match.
Ron stepped in between Harry and Draco before speaking, “I think you should go; you have done enough. For the sake of our friendship, I hope you are not lying to us, but for Harry’s happiness I hope you are wrong, at least wrong about what you saw.”
Cedric and Harry talked for a little bit longer before Cedric went back to his table. Harry sat down and could bring his full attention to his food. He didn’t get to eat much since he was busy looking for Cedric or talking with Cedric. He had to eat quickly though because everyone had to head to their common room soon.
They have all made it off the train and made their way to The Great Hall. Harry was looking for Cedric, but couldn’t see him anywhere. After a while, Harry started to get worried. It wasn’t till after they sat down and started eating that Harry felt a tap on his shoulder.
“You really need to stop running away from your issues,” Harry joked while smiling at Draco. “And to answer your question I didn’t mean it in a bad way. What I mean was, I know people will look at us weird and think it is wrong for two males to be together like this, but I can’t help that I need you like that.” Harry was blushing and starting to get really awkward. “What I mean to say is… I like you Draco… Like, a lot.” Harry chuckled softly.
Harry was nervous for the entire class period and didn’t know what he was going to do. He wasn’t even sure what he was going to say. He tried to come up with something but, nothing came to mind. Draco tried to talk with Harry and the same with Ron, but Harry simply could not hear them as he was stuck in his thoughts. He just mindlessly went through class doing what he was told or doing what he was reading in his potions book while making some mistakes.
Harry kept eye contact with Draco and waved. “I’ll see you in our next class together!” Harry yelled before bringing his attention to where Hermione was leading him, picking up the pace to make it to class on time.
In the Triwizard Tournament, the second event involved saving someone you cared about. Now, since Harry and Cedric were both competing in the tournament, they couldn’t save each other so someone else was picked.
“I don’t want to ruin this wonderful night but there is something that I would like to ask you about. Is that okay?” Harry asked quietly. He felt bad but he wanted to know about the whole Death Eater thing.
After they were allowed to start eating everyone got to talking. Draco was sitting between Goyle and Pansy. It really didn’t take long before Pansy started hardcore questioning Draco. “What was that all about Draco? Did you really mean all that you said? Are you really going to change? That isn’t very ‘Draco Malfoy’ or ‘Slytherin’ of you!” Pansy questioned. This is one of the main reasons Draco didn’t tell her about wanting to be good over the summer. It would have all been a waste of parchment paper.
“I can see why you think I would be a good teacher, but I was talking about you, Harry! You are the one who performed that one big light from the difficult Patronus charm that fought off hundreds of Dementors. You have a lot of experience with using defense spells than any of us,” Hermione pointed out.
“I will not be telling Dumbledore!” Harry explains as he yanks his arm back to his chest and getting up from his seat on the couch in the common room. “Dumbledore is a very busy man. I don’t want to waste his time on such silly matters like this,” Harry looked away from Hermione. It was very obvious that he is still upset that after his trial that Dumbledore has been ignoring Harry completely.
Over the course of a week, Harry started to pay more attention to the things Cedric was doing. He saw just how “friendly” he was acting to some of the guys and girls. Cedric mostly did a lot of flirting with Cho and this one guy who was a Slytherin. This broke Harry’s heart, but he just had to wait a little longer. He wanted to see Cedric kiss someone before he would believe it in his heart that Cedric was cheating. Sadly, Harry got what he was looking for.
“Don’t you start with that! That’s bollocks and you know it!” Harry yelled before taking a few breaths to calm himself down. His expression lightened and he was now calm. “I’m sorry for yelling at you… I just want you to let me in Draco. Or anyone for that matter.” Harry paused for a moment. “Is that what you are scared of? Letting people in?” Harry walked over to Draco till they were about 2 feet away from each other.
And just after Draco said that Hermione appeared right on time. Hermione could tell what was going on from what she saw as she walked over to the two. “Harry! Ron and I were looking all over for you! Class is starting soon so if you don’t want detention with Umbridge I suggest we get to running.” Hermione didn’t even wait for a response as she grabbed onto Harry’s arm and started dragging him in the direction of their next class.
Draco was just hanging around in the Astronomy Tower hoping Harry would come by. He was doing this every day while Harry was away in detention, just waiting for him to come back. Draco was leaning against the railing looking out into the distance. Harry walked up the stair and was surprised to see Draco there. He was surprised that Draco didn’t turn to look to see who was coming up the stairs.
Slowly after a lot of time, Harry and Draco become really close. Ron and Hermine were not okay with this new friendship but any time they tried to bring it up with Harry, he would get really mad. “I’m an adult, I can make decisions for myself of who I should hang out with it. You guys are like family to me. Just please give him a chance, at least for me,” Harry was always saying something along that line whenever Hermine or Ron would protest Harry spending time with Draco.
“I am going to head out, I will chat with you guy later,” Harry got up, trying to not act like he is rushing, and makes his way out of The Great Hall. He waits till he sees Draco out of view before following after him.
Harry was confused and thought that Draco was trying to pull a prank on him. After weeks of Draco chatting with Harry when he could in and out of class in a friendly manner, Harry started to believe Draco was turning good. It was a surprise, but a nice one to experience. Draco was now one less person to worry about this school year and Harry was okay with that. Just means less stress for him on one thing.
“You are so clumsy Harry you need to be careful before you end up killing us both one day!” Draco laughed and got up. Draco turned and held out his hand to Harry, helping him up.
His mother on the other hand really didn’t want Draco to be a Death Eater. Since there was now, most definitely, going to be a second war. Narcissa didn’t want to risk losing her son. She was already a Death Eater, along with Lucius, and she didn’t want to drag her only son down this dangerous road. Another difference between her and Lucius was that she would be accepting if Draco actually wanted to be a Death Eater or not. She just wanted to make sure that this was something that Draco wanted because there was no going back once he joined.
“To be honest,” Draco kept a straight face and continued after a short pause, “I never really hated the mudbloods.” Once Draco finished that sentence his father’s jaw dropped.
The room was quiet for a while before a few people clapped. That was something that Draco never thought was going to happen after his speech. McGonagall Thanked Draco for his kind words and started the hat sorting ceremony. To Draco, it felt like the air around him lightened up. It didn’t feel like it was hard to breathe anymore, he felt more relaxed than ever before. It really felt like he was starting all over again. It was like he was back in his 1
“I completely understand Draco… Please just let me in, if you can’t trust anyone else, trust me,” Harry smiled softly and held out his hand. After a few moments, Draco took Harry’s hand.
Draco felt a hand on his shoulder and when Draco didn’t look up immediately the hand on his shoulder lightly started shaking him. Draco sat up and rubbed his temple with both hands. “I wasn’t asleep, Mr. Slughorn I— “Draco stopped mid-sentence as it was not Mr. Slughorn. The person that had his hand on Draco’s Shoulder was Harry freaking Potter. Draco was shocked but quickly gained his composer. “Oh, Potter, hey… Um, do you need something?” By Draco’s voice, you could tell he was put off guard.
“I just wanted to apologize… about Ron. After the war, Ron has been very protective of his friends and family. You can’t really blame him, he lost family in that war.” Harry turned and looked out the window. Draco nodded hoping Harry saw him out of the corner of his eye. Silence fell between the two and Draco started fidgeting with his sleeve. “I believe you by the way,” Harry says softly.
Harry was trying to control his tear as he went out looking for Draco. He knew that he would need to break up with Cedric as soon as he saw what Draco said was true. Harry just couldn’t face Ron or Hermione after what just happened, but he really wanted to see Draco. He wanted to apologize and tell him that he broke things off with Cedric, but the hard part was trying to find Draco in this massive school. He had to find him quickly since it was almost time to head off to his next class.
Draco chuckled to himself before folding the paper and putting it in his robe. “I’ll see you soon Pottah.” Draco headed off to his next class. All-day, the only thing that he could think about was going and seeing Harry and having a little picnic. Draco was also nervous because he couldn’t tell if this was meant to be a date or not. I mean Harry just got out of a relationship, but who knows what is going on his Harry’s head.
As soon as the class was dismissed, he got up and made his way to the courtyard. He was hoping he wouldn’t see what he thinks he will see, but he can’t just sit by and let someone cheat on him. This was going to be the end of the relationship if Cedric does make out with this guy.
“Kind of… Yeah. I know it is silly, but I fear people might use me now that I am being good,” Draco says quietly for only Harry to hear.
Draco was really worried when he barely saw Harry and anytime that he did, Harry looked so tired and was consistently holding his left hand. When Harry got to go back to his normal schedule again Hermione ran into Harry in the common room and noticed his left hand.
Ron and Hermione were talking have their own conversation trying to figure out what they should do this time since Voldemort was back. Hermione can already tell that she is going to get annoyed at Harry for focusing so much on Cedric when they have a huge problem to deal with.
Instead of Azkaban Draco was under house arrest for the whole summer, the mail going in and out of the Malfoy house was monitored, his wand was taken away, and Draco was also required to attend lessons with a therapist. Draco had to go see a therapist once a week for the whole summer. At the end of the summer, the therapist would be one of the people to help decide if Draco was ready to be released from house arrest and was allowed to go back to Hogwarts.
“Harry? Is something the matter?” Draco asked as he raises his brow in a questioning manner. “Something on your mind?”
“Harry- I-…it’s not what you think!” Cedric quickly told Harry while taking a step away from the guy he was kissing. “The kiss didn’t mean a thing! You got to believe me; it wasn’t you, so it didn’t mean anything! Harry, love look at me…” Cedric honestly didn’t know what he was saying at thing point he was just saying whatever came to mind without really meaning it.
The rest is known. Harry grabbed onto the cup and was transported to Little Hangleton Graveyard. The same graveyard he was having nightmares about and the one that held Tom Riddle’s grave.
“I know it is hard to believe it, but I am not lying to you. Why would I lie to you when I have spent all this time building a friendship with you? I might have been mean to you in the past but not like that!” Draco has a worried expression on his face. The more Draco thought about it he remembers every time he saw Cedric, he was flirting with someone different. He couldn’t believe how he didn’t see this sooner or how come Harry never noticed a thing. Draco started getting angry again and he just snapped, blurting out: “You’re so dense you didn't even notice! pay more attention to him and you will see that I am right!” Draco immediately regrated saying that out loud, it was meant to be a thought in his head, but it was too late now. Draco really didn’t want to lose his friendship that he just got with the golden trio about something that he was not lying about. He wasn’t trying to hurt Harry, but he was not going to hurt him more by keeping something like this a secret from him.
changing for the good. “And why should we believe you Draco? You have been nothing but nasty to us for the past 7 years.” Hermione stated as she crossed her arms.
This conversation was just making Draco angrier by the second, but he kept his cool. “You couldn’t get Harry back even if you tried,” Draco said with a smirk. “So, have fun not being as popular—oh and by the way, having Harry being your only claim to fame is rather pathetic if you ask literally anyone. I’ll be off to class now.” Without another word, Draco headed off to class. He was late and almost got detention, but he managed to talk his way out of it.
“Sorry, am I interrupting here?” Draco smirked and let out a soft chuckle. Draco made his way over to Harry and took a seat on the blanket. “Where did you get all this food?” Draco looked around at the food that was laid out in front of them.
“So, you got a week of detention? Did anything happen in there?” Draco asked as he studied Harry’s expressions. Harry got tense and it looked like he started sweating.
H- ‘I am doing pretty good. To be honest, it doesn’t feel like anything has changed. The only different thing is I don’t hang out with Cedric anymore, but we were also both busy, so we never really hung out too much. Everything feels normal like; we never dated.’
Cedric and his dad, Amos Diggory, did a lot of traveling so even if Harry were able to send Cedric a letter it was a low possibility that Cedric would answer it. That being that he would be so distracted that he would forget about the letters entirely. Any free time Cedric did have was watching Quidditch with his dad or socializing.
“I thought you were hesitant with whether or not Voldemort was back or not? What made you suddenly change your mind?” Harry asked, looking at Hemione with one brow lifted.
“Thanks, Draco. That means a lot to me because I know that Hermione means well, but the way she was acting when she saw my hand was so pushy. She was trying to get me to go out and do something about it. There is nothing I can do about it at this point and there are more importing things to think about anyways,” fight as harry finished talking the bell chimed saying that it was time to get to their next class. “Why does that bell also seem to go off after one of us finish talking?” Harry quickly added as the bell stops chiming.
“I see… Well, how about you meet me on the quidditch field after practices and we can go do something to get your mind off things? I can already tell this year is going to be stressful so breaks from these stressful times are needed!” Cedric ruffled Harry’s already messy hair and smiled softly.
From that day forward they had become a couple. Ron was completely shocked, but Hermine called it. After they had been spending too much time together and how Harry would act when talking about Draco, she just knew Harry liked Draco. She was happy to see him so happy. She hadn’t seen Harry that happy in a long time. Of course, Ron threatened Draco if he ever hurt Harry he would have to pay. Draco was nervous but promised Ron he would do nothing to harm Harry.
Cedric did threaten that he was going to try and get Harry back, but that never ended up happening because he officially started dating Cho. He wasn’t a player anymore and was actually really happy with his relationship with Cho. He did end up apologizing to Harry and Draco and then left them alone except for when it came to getting help with some spells in the club; “Dumbledore’s Army.”
There was a long moment of silence. It was a nice comfortable silence. Harry was thinking of how much of a crush he has on Draco. While Draco on the other hand was thinking if it was time or not to confess his feelings. It had been a long enough time since Harry’s breakup, so Draco found it a safe time to ask.
Draco initially asked for time to think about it. Once Draco had a clear mind of what he wanted to do he went up to his parents to tell them told them what he was thinking and feeling about the whole thing. Draco didn’t want to be a Death Eater and once his father heard that his son wouldn’t join him on his team in the war, he got angry.
“Yeah! I didn’t see you get off the train!” Harry says as he quickly stands up and turns his body to hug Cedric. “How was your summer?” Harry had the biggest smile on his face. Harry was really happy to see Cedric.
Without even thinking Draco blurted out, “I don’t think there is anything you can do about the people making fun of me because I am gay…shit…” Draco didn’t mean for that to happen, his emotions were just getting the best of him. He really didn’t want to tell Harry yet as Draco wasn’t sure how Harry would react. “I… I’m so sorry I didn’t mean… I should go,” Draco quickly said, and he turns and ran away from Harry going into the building. He was trying to go to his room and just lock himself away in there till things cooled down. He wasn’t sure Harry was mad or not, but he just needed to get away for a while in case Harry was mad.
But it was gone. He felt only a slight twinge at the idea that Ginny might have moved on, and he couldn’t figure out what it was—regret? Remorse?
“You aren’t saving me again.” Draco caught the ball and squeezed it so hard, he popped the rubber open. “It’s not worth it.”
Hermione’s hand went to the necklace around her neck. “Is there any chance of recovering it?”  Draco could swear that her hair had started to take on a darker tinge, and her beard seemed to be getting thinner. The hour must be nearly up.
“Floo Powder is banned as a form of travel. We are only allowed to travel through Muggle means, and since most of the muggle transportation is either faulty, lengthy, or defective, we are confined to this area for the time being.”
“I have been a teacher for forty-one years, Mr. Malfoy. Please do not underestimate my ability to read young minds.”
“Well, not permanently. Magic doesn’t work against its original wizard, and it diminishes the longer its away from its host. But I’m hoping to eliminate that.”
Ron shook his head. “The spell works over long distances. She said it would help her find me, if we ever got separated. I could always find my way back to her.” Ron’s eyes were wet again, and his chin trembled
Draco moved closer to him, drawing his wand as he did so. He pressed it into Harry’s neck, right where his pulse throbbed. Harry didn’t flinch, only looked at him, tears rolling down his cheeks.
“You have ‘an unerring capacity to do the right thing,’ that’s what he said to me. You’d walk through fire to save someone else.”
Cages lined the walls of the room. They had iron bars, like old prison cells, equipped with a mattress and a place for washing. Each cell was just barely wide enough for a person to lie down in, and they were packed close to one another like sardines.
Even though Voldemort’s followers were imprisoned or dead, and Shacklebolt had announced a new era of resistance to the prejudices of the old regime, the ideas Voldemort had helped to perpetuate still remained in some capacity.
With a flash, Draco remembered the Battle of Hogwarts again, the frenzy that overtook him as he ripped into wounded victim after wounded victim, feeding and feeding, his vision tinted red, seeing nothing but paper-thin flesh, veins like underground springs begging to be tapped.
Harry watched with only slight interest, assuming Malfoy had just thought to stop for lunch, or spend more time walking around his bedroom. He glanced at the window as the rain beat savagely against it; the trees bent and swayed in the wind, and lightning crackled across the sky. Neither of them would be playing Quidditch today.
A mission that had led to all three of them: Harry, Malfoy, and Dumbledore, at the top of a lightning-struck tower…
There was a mysterious fog clouding his vision. Black and thick like smoke; he groped through it. Sound was muffled, but he could hear the edges of a conversation. The clatter of dishes and plates.
“We haven’t really talked since the quarantine.” Harry said. “She seemed like she wanted to keep her distance.”
Draco had revived him long enough to shove a Blood Replenishing Potion down his throat, then tucked him into bed.
McGonagall eyed him for a moment. “Very well. Potter, back to the Gryffindor dormitory. And do not repeat everything you heard in this room. The last thing we want is for students to panic, is that clear?”
“We—that is to say—he—was up late last night,” Draco willed himself not to glance at Potter, and betray the whole game. “
He’d gripped the seat and closed his eyes, feeling the ground drop out from beneath him. The ground grew smaller and smaller below, until the plane reached ‘cruising altitude’ above the clouds.
He needed to control himself. Part of him wanted to go back in there and drink Zabini’s blood until he was a mess on the floor. Part of him wanted to drain him, kill him and let his father deal with how to cover up his monstrous deeds.
“I can be out of the gates by the morning.” Malfoy said. “I’ll send word to my family, if you’ll just—”
And Draco moved, so quickly that even Harry Potter, one of the greatest wizards that had ever lived, didn’t have time to react.
And Draco didn’t either. He didn’t even know if he meant what he’d said, about making Harry forget. For how
He leaned against the wall and tucked his head into his chest, cradling his wand. At least, if he was killed in the struggle, it would be a painless death. Quick and easy.
“You are both poised to be leaders of the community, following your graduation from this school. Potter, you have already expressed your ambition to become an Auror. And Malfoy, Professor Slughorn tells me that you have a talent for politics.”
But watching Harry, ruffled and nervous in his work robes, it was Draco who felt like the breath was stolen from his chest.
Harry was just starting to think that this job was...bearable. He got free drinks, and the customers were nicer than most. No one was yelling at him or telling him that he needed to make something of his life, and his coworkers were kind and outgoing and didn't seem all that gossipy. So what if he had a problem with one coworker? He could avoid him, and life would go on…
“The survivor’s guilt is normal, too. But there is no way of knowing if your choices would have kept more or less people alive. You defeated Voldemort in the end, and the Wizarding World is at peace. That is what matters.”
Finally, in some desperate attempt to regain control of the volatile tension permeating the room, Harry said, "I propose a drinking game."
“Oh.” Ron looked confused. “She was talking through one of those mirrors during quarantine to someone. Wasn’t that you?”
It was exhausting to pretend to be better than your nature; it was why he’d joined the Death Eaters in the first place. Not betraying Potter had made his skin crawl.
Harry reached a hand through the bars, straining with his shoulders. He was just able to grasp at the fingertips of Ron’s outstretched, trembling hand. “They told me—” he began, then started again. “The witch told me—they ‘took care’ of her.”
And the office did have small changes. There was the portrait of Dumbledore, snoozing delicately in a high-backed chair. The Order of Merlin, First Class, which Minister Shacklebolt had bestowed upon McGonagall for her courage at the Battle of Hogwarts (McGonagall never polished it; she had been so disgusted with the Ministry’s initial response to Voldemort’s return that Kingsley had to practically beg her to accept it in the first place), the Sword of Gryffindor in its crystal case, and a few portraits of cats that gamboled about good-naturedly, hunting various squirrels and birds through the paintings, the antithesis of the sicky sweet kittens that had adorned Umbridge’s office.
Shacklebolt, Weasley, even the wizard who came to check the plumbing, all shared a similar distrust for anyone who was under Voldemort’s influence, even if they had all pleaded to be under duress, even if his father’s money had kept them out of prison.
McGonagall sent her Patronus to check in on them every few days, but their conversations were short and unproductive. Her Patronus merely delivered information, and it was always the same: cases were increasing, it still wasn’t safe, they didn’t know how long it would take, and more were dying every day. “Do you need anything?” the Patronus always asked last, but Harry couldn’t think of anything that was actually necessary.
Draco stepped into the blinding glare of the spotlight, raising his hand up instinctively to cover his eyes. Percy Weasley was speaking, his voice magically magnified. “And it is my great honor to introduce these next two young wizards, who went from enemies to friends as a result of their quarantine.” He paused, his chest seeming to swell with self-importance.  “Above all, this pandemic showed us one thing: we are better—together.”
Draco casually withdrew his wand from his pocket, keeping his same nonchalant expression. “And how do you know that?”
But Harry and Draco couldn't care less about what anyone else thought. For Blaise and the firefighters, this was a natural disaster. A blizzard of epic proportions.
This was so ironic that Draco simply laughed, gesturing to where Potter was clearly attempting to eavesdrop even though he’d been Charmed. “You want to lecture
Of course, they started off with completely different hobbies, opposite daily routines. When Harry read, Draco exercised. When Draco practiced spells, Harry watched
"Well. I try to turn towards the light as much as I can." Harry said, relieved to find that his voice wasn’t shaking. "There's only room for one emo kid in this cafe."
He felt feel full for a moment, before the hunger set in again. He’d looked in the mirror before he’d come down. There were already dark hollows beneath his eyes, and his skin had a sickly and bluish tinge to it.
Malfoy was up to something. After all, it was spring break, and they’d all turned in that paper weeks ago. What was he researching now?
“No it wasn’t. It was for all of us. For a better future.” Ron repeated the words his therapist had taught him with the same monotone voice Harry had come to recognize.
“I don’t mind, really.” Harry said. “If it’s the only thing to keep you alive. I said I’d help you—”
Harry couldn’t help himself. He stepped closer to Draco, one of his hands tracing the edge of Draco’s collar. “I don’t know.” Harry whispered.
“Shut up and listen to me,” the voice that issued through the phone was clear and direct. Of all of the golden trio, it was Hermione that had changed the most since the battle. Where before she’d been intimidating, she was now terrifying. Where before she’d been intense, now she incinerated. Whenever she spoke, the room went completely silent.
And in front of a group of very uncomfortable-looking wait staff, Harry had finally grabbed Draco by the shoulder and turned him so that they faced each other.
Draco shook his head, but his right hand, which didn’t hold his wand, closed in a fist. “He doesn’t love me. I don’t love him. It was a
And then there was the small matter of Potter climaxing from the mere hint of pressure, from Draco’s fangs sunk into his throat.
“My apologies, Mr. Bolton. We were just discussing our dinner plans,” Draco said. “Would you two mind joining us at the Eiffel Tower’s restaurant later this evening?”
are magic.” She corrected. “Yourself, Mr. Mafoy, withches and wizards of a purely magical heritage. But a Mudblood? Someone who by accident of birth managed to get the gifts that were rightfully ours? They have
“And you are the Chosen One,” she said sadly. “You are the Master of Death. You died, and here you stand. You have survived the Killing Curse not once, but twice. Both you and Draco might be indestructible, as you said. And yet, both you and Draco are held together by thinly stretched scars. The slightest blow, and you’ll bleed again. All those old wounds, the ones you pretend aren’t there, will reopen. And there will be no hiding.”
“Go back to school, Mr. Potter.” Lucius spoke in his eloquent, clipped voice, which belied his disheveled state. “You should be in quarantine. This is a family affair.”
They sat in silence for an entire episode and halfway through the next, before Draco got up and stretched. "I'm gonna make a breakfast sandwich." He said. "You want one?'
“Then take off that ridiculous Charm and follow me.” The man let out a sigh and disappeared back behind the wall.
“You—created these snakes?” Hermione said from beside him. Her wand was out, and she was speaking without taking her eyes off the snakes. “How? Magic cannot create living things!”
“The old and the immunocompromised are having the hardest time with it,” Neville said. “The casualties are--concerning.”
“You’re an intern. They barely notice if you’re breathing.” Hermione raised her wand. “At least hear me out.
Draco opened the door, casting one last glance Harry’s way. “Aren’t you even going to walk me out? You
And Harry walked toward Draco slowly, his feet barely making a noise on the expensive, ornate carpet.
To his right, the floor opened up, and people were dancing. There were couples all over the floor, spinning and twirling in each other’s arms, or simply holding each other.
“We can?” Harry was shouting too, striding up right into Draco’s face.  “How about this: I love you. I love you, Draco Malfoy. And I know that you’re hurting right now, and your whole world is upside down, but you love me, too.”
But he’d quickly learned there was something—sweeter about it if it was someone he was attracted to. If it was someone he drank from in the throes of passion, or the lingering aftertaste of a kiss…
“What the Hell does that mean?” Harry got to his feet, but the witch raised her wand threateningly, and he sank down to his chair again. “What are you doing with the Muggles? What are you going to do with us?”
“Like I said, I will have someone bring you supplies,” McGonagall’s reply was curt and direct, but her voice softened as she said. “That is my final word, Potter. Let me know if you develop any symptoms.”
The Room of Requirement had transformed into a sizeable dormitory, with Harry’s suggestions. Malfoy had simply stood to the side and looked sullen, but Harry could tell he was at least somewhat grateful.
At first, it had been exceptionally boring. There Malfoy was, reading and taking copious notes in a journal. Harry had tried to see what it was numerous times, but Malfoy always kept the book flat on the table, and bent over his work whenever Harry walked by.
Harry was still watching him, a curious feeling spreading through his chest, when he finally fell asleep.
Before he’d fallen for a boy with dark hair and green eyes, who always did the right thing, who held him as his mother died and world broke apart, whispering the only words that Draco could hold onto in that moment. A boy who was so close, Draco could practically reach through their connection and touch him, so close that their feelings blended together, twining until there was no separating them.
Harry shifted, rolling over to face the wall.  The beds the Room of Requirement had supplied were exceedingly comfortable, at least. Malfoy was already snoring beside him.
