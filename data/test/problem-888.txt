"Are you playing messenger now?" Draco teased, restraining himself from tearing into it immediately. He didn't want news that he was over-eager reaching Harry. He had to preserve his advantage, after all.
and saw some new speculation about an affair she was supposedly having, or how Oliver was gay and had only married her because he needed to produce an heir.
"Let's start again. What is your name?" the man asked as soon as the door had closed, and Draco closed his eyes, his magically bound hands tightening into fists under the table.
"It was his idea," Harry murmured, Draco's fingers tickling his lips. "He and Teddy came to me more than a month ago. He wanted it to be a surprise."
The dark-haired wizard squirmed, feeling foggy from oversleeping. They'd spent the entire night making love, finally falling asleep sometime around dawn. He looked out the window, frowning at the pitch-black expanse outside. He had no idea what time it was, but he was sure it was late – probably the middle of the night.
Draco tucked a lock of Cal's black hair behind his ear, completely intoxicated by the picture he and Harry made. It was almost exactly the way he'd pictured them at Ron and Hermione's wedding, when he'd come across Harry cradling his sleeping godson. He hadn't been able to envision how staggered he would be at the sight of Harry pressing a fond kiss to Cal's forehead, though, or how fiercely
"The Australian wine guide I consulted said it is best served aged, so I thought you might like to try an experiment," Draco explained, his smirk turning into a smile when Harry still looked perplexed.
Ron thought grumpily, glaring at the empty stairs. Seamus’ relationship had really taken off. Ron had been shocked at all the things the Irishman and the usually shy Hufflepuff had gotten up to. She was incredibly flexible and inventive, if Seamus was to be believed.
He looked over at his laptop screen, impatient for a response from Gryffin. After spending a considerable portion of his evening obsessing over Harry Potter, he really wanted the easy comfort of talking to the man. Gryffin was funny and laid back, nothing like uptight and judgmental Potter, he thought with a curl of his lip.
They'd lost an entire crop of grapes their first year, thanks to inexperience and an unseasonably cool spring with a late frost. Neville had researched like a madman after that, even more determined to make the winery a success after the initial setback. And he had.
Steeling himself, Draco crossed the room, careful to keep his fingers from touching Harry's when he handed him the whisky. The courtship rules weren't that strict, of course, random brushes of hands would be fine. Still, he didn't trust himself have any skin contact with the dark-haired wizard, afraid even the slightest friction of skin on skin contact would leave him helpless to do anything but throw Harry to the floor and fuck him senseless.
Fifteen minutes late. Draco crossed his arms, his eyes narrowing as he watched the fireplace. Harry had really better have a good excuse, because –
"Is Ollie home?" Nev asked, looking around. He figured the fewer people who knew about this train wreck in the making the better, and he doubted Pansy had shared any information with her husband. Both Draco and Harry had told him about the Unbreakable Vow she'd sworn with them.
He waited until he was sure they were both in the trance-like state before rising, digging through the bag he'd brought with him for Calming Draughts and a slew of other potions. If they were watching what he thought they were, they were going to need them.
Draco couldn't help but return the smile. He picked up the small bag, fishing inside so he could see what Harry had brought. His brow furrowed in confusion when he pulled out two silver bracelets and two small vials of a lurid purple potion.
Hermione heard the Floo roar to life just as she was putting the finishing touches on dinner. As she was finishing plating the takeaway, at any rate, which in a way could be considered making dinner, she reasoned. She grabbed a dish towel to wipe a stray bit of curry from her hands and walked into the sitting room.
Draco and Blaise walked down the short aisle, stopping when they reached the bank of floor-to-ceiling windows at the far end of the main ballroom. Narcissa and Daphne had completely transformed the room. The trees outside the large windows had been covered in fairy lights, which twinkled beautifully against the dark night. Inside, large potted evergreen trees guarded each corner, decorated tastefully with soft lights and flowing ice blue and silver ribbons.
Blaise squinted as he studied Draco's clothing, deciding he was presentable enough. He knew the meticulous blond would never forgive him if he let him walk into Harry's surprise date looking disheveled.
"I mean, had I known, I could have saved myself some embarrassment. As it was, I went on and on about how much I adored his work – do you have any idea how bloody mortifying it was when I found out I'd been writing to him all along?"
"Are you sure, Harry? You shouldn't give up just because you've had a setback," Pansy said, regarding the wizard seated in front of her with concern.
those people?" Blaise growled, winging the file folder across the table angrily. It slipped off the other side of the polished conference room table scattering parchment and statements across the floor.
Draco's eyes narrowed and he reached out and pulled his laptop away from Blaise, who raised his hands in defense and adopted an innocent look.
"What did you give Harry? He's dead to the world," he said, nodding to the unresponsive man on the sofa.
She brought her attention back to Hermione, smoothing some nonexistent wrinkles out of the simple silk sheath she wore. Everything about the wedding – from the elegant bridesmaid dress to the sensible favors – just screamed Hermione. Ginny smiled, tucking one of Hermione's errant curls back into its pin. Hermione's light cream-colored dress fell in graceful waves around her, its scooped neckline accentuating her slender shoulders and graceful neck. Her hair was piled up on top of her head, secured by about a hundred pins and Great Aunt Muriel's goblin-made tiara, the same one Fleur wore when she married Bill.
"I'm sorry that was necessary," Harry said, the smug tone of his voice assuring them he was not the least bit apologetic. "This is Draco Potter-Black, my husband, and Carina Potter-Black, our daughter. She is two."
Hermione choked off a suggestive laugh, running her bare foot up Theo’s leg to ensure his other wand was raised as well.
"To me, at least," she said, sitting on the sofa with her legs curled comfortably beneath her. It was a cool night – especially for early July – and she wrapped one of Freddie's blankets around her bare arms.
"Harry," Teddy said, his deepening voice startling Harry. When had the skinny little boy become a man? He leaned in, returning Cari to his arms and pecking him on the cheek.
Harry watched as Ron gave up on conversation and dug into his own meal, he wondered if Malfoy had ever made it. It was one of his favorite things to whip up on a cool evening. A pantry pleaser, he'd told Sly, since it went well with virtually any kind of protein or sautéed vegetable.
Harry chuckled, turning back to the pile of parchment in his hands. James Evans' latest book was almost ready to go to press, and he'd never been more satisfied with one of his manuscripts. The publisher had loved the change – from single Auror to family man – his main character had undergone this time, saying it would open up the appeal of the series to a new audience.
Draco decided not to be coy, wrapping his hand around his own cock and giving it one firm stroke. He heard Harry curse softly, and soon Draco's cock was enveloped in tight warmth as well. Draco closed his eyes, unable to concentrate on the amazing feeling of Harry's rough palm on his cock and watch Harry at the same time. It was too – strange. It had been odd enough when they'd done this with the cock rings, but now, knowing it was Harry's hand on his cock,
She frowned, nodding as she thought about the inevitable fall-out when they revealed their identities. She was sure to bear the worst of it, since they would both be aware that she'd known from the beginning. Pansy was sure Draco would find a way to hold that against her, Unbreakable Vow or not
Cal's lip trembled, his boyish pout softening Draco's resolve. He knew he didn't see Caleum enough, but it was just too risky have him here in England where they could be seen together.
"He's fine," Blaise cut in, bringing a hand up to rub soothing circles against the boy's back. "Remember when we talked about this last year? There are some bad people who don't like your father, and one of them found out where you live. We're just here until the Aurors can catch him."
Draco nodded, the tight fist of terror around his heart still constricting painfully. If Harry said Cal was with Neville and Blaise at the safe house everything was probably fine, and he was right – there was no way he'd be able to ditch his Auror guards in the condition he was in.
Of Malfoy. Holding Ron in his seat while he waved a very beautiful – and mostly blurred out – naked witch away. Harry was visible in the background, quite obviously asleep with his head on the table. The table that looked – Harry squinted, leaning closer to the photo – like it was covered in something sticky. Like a spilled drink.
"Illegal to interfere?" Hermione still wasn't sure what bearing that had on Harry's pursuit of Draco.
. He'd been ridiculously attracted to the bastard when they'd run into each other at the meeting, and every time he'd seen him since. Harry knew if he was being honest, he'd have to admit the tingles he'd felt the night before when Malfoy entered the bar hadn't been entirely born of anger or frustration.
Blaise tipped an imaginary hat at Draco as the other man left the office, whistling softly to himself as he made his way toward the office's apparition point. Blaise shook his head fondly, watching him walk away. Draco was already on the road to smitten, that much was clear. He just hoped things worked out.
He shook his head ruefully, finally removed enough from the memories to feel sorry for his ex-wife. She'd married him hoping for an exciting life filled with luxury and entertainment, and she'd ended up saddled with a baby and a disinterested husband.
His fingers traced the outline of his own features, but feeling Draco's. The blond let his head fall back, his eyes tightly shut at the sensation of Harry's callused hand cupping his chin, his thumb ever-so-gentle as it stroked Draco's cheekbone.
"He's … different," Ron said, surprising both Harry and Hermione by coming to Draco's defense. "They're all different now. Everyone has grown up."
Harry watched the smile play across her face as she read Sly's words, knowing she'd reached the part hoping for a face-to-face meeting.
ran the office, not the other way around. In turn, Harry had shared a few stories about working with Hermione, though he hadn't named her. From his response, Sly had quite enjoyed hearing about the perils of working with one of your oldest friends. They'd both been careful not to divulge what they actually did for a living.
Harry nodded. He could feel the bond buzzing in the back of his mind, and his magic was agitated. Despite that, he still felt no threat from them.
He grinned, sitting back to enjoy the unfamiliar film. He'd already worked his way through his favorites –
"So Draco was over for dinner. It seems he's met someone. Online." Her gaze was steady as she studied Neville. She saw him stiffen, confirming her suspicions. "Nev, what the fuck is going on?"
Hermione pulled his laptop over toward her side of the table, pulling up the document Harry had been working on all morning. It was nearly blank.
"Oh, yes. He said he'd be sending something through the agency today, though I have no idea what it is," he said, lifting the flap on the basket curiously. Harry gasped when he saw what was inside; the small basket was obviously magical, since the interior held what looked like a several-course meal big enough to feed a small army.
"It's no problem," Draco assured them, rocking back on his heels. "Just do whatever you need to for Freddie. You'll let me know if you need anything?"
Draco snickered from his place on the chair. Harry looked up, noticing the portrait of Severus Snape above the mantle for the first time. Had that always been there? He'd been in Draco's study several times over the last few days, and he didn't remember Snape being there. Harry squeezed his eyes shut, hoping the dour man would be gone when he opened them. No such luck.
He glanced over at Cal, running his fingers through the dark hair that spilled over the pillow. He'd be six next month. Draco's smile faded as his thoughts turned toward telling Harry about Cal. He'd spent countless hours over the last week thinking about it, and he still didn't know how to proceed.
“Serves you right,” Theo muttered, tucking his growing cock back into his pants. He’d be fully hard again in just a moment if she kept standing there like that, one hand on her hip, biting her already full lips as she puzzled over what to do.
He Summoned the contents, picking through the jumble of paperwork until he found the Gringotts statements they'd just been discussing. The Ataliers' son Cato had been steadily embezzling from them since he took the helm of their apothecary business a few months ago. Profits had been declining, but the Ataliers preferred to blame Draco's management of their investments and properties for the losses instead of their son's obvious duplicity.
His wand trembling in his hand, Theo turned his gaze to the parchment, repeating the incantation. This time, to his surprise, the parchment shivered and sprouted a thin layer of bark across its surface.
Draco shook his head, resolving to leave as soon as he found the newlyweds and said goodbye. It was ridiculous to pine over Potter – there was no way anything could possibly happen between the two of them. He felt a momentary pang at the thought of losing his easy conversations with Gryffin, but he was a realist. Harry Potter would not date Draco Malfoy, and even if he would, Draco Malfoy had too many responsibilities to even consider it. He'd known Gryffin had some degree of fame, and he'd figured they'd be able to deal with it. But Harry Potter? He would have no chance in hell of keeping their relationship out of the papers, and there was no way he'd put Cal in jeopardy like that. The press would have a field day investigating his every move if he and Potter were together, and that would eventually lead them to his son.
Grimacing, he grabbed his wand, casting a quick spell to rid him of his erection. The charm wouldn't last long, but it should get him through until lunch, when he could Apparate home to take care of the problem Gryffin had caused. Draco grinned, remembering the very uncomfortable evening years ago when Professor Snape had called all the Slytherin first year boys together to talk to them about sex, even more mortifying for Draco since he'd been his godfather as well as Head of House. Severus taught them all the useful charm, which Draco had employed more than a few times in his early years at Hogwarts.
The elf hesitated, looking down at her feet. She was wearing ballet slippers today, and Draco had to fight to keep his thoughts focused instead of letting them wander to why exactly the diminutive house-elf would be wearing the odd footwear.
Harry sighed, throwing back the damp and sticky bedclothes and heaving himself out of bed. Cleaning Charms worked perfectly well, but this was the second time tonight he'd woken up in a pool of his own sweat and come. It was getting ridiculous.
Draco hummed his approval, biting his lip as he tried to decide what to do next. His regular email box was likely overflowing with messages, and some of them might well be urgent. He also had a few letters to read and respond to, and a dozen contracts that needed his attention before they could be sent out that afternoon.
She grabbed Harry's hand, taking a closer look at the tattoo on his finger. "It's brilliant," she said, kissing Draco on the cheek when he joined them. "Congratulations."
Harry dropped Draco's hand, kneeling beside Cal. Kingsley moved his wand, pressing it against Harry's chest. "
Draco looked away, studiously avoiding eye contact with the other patrons. He didn't understand the compulsion to sit in a room with dozens of other men watching women undress. Dozens of
Harry smiled, excited for the afternoon to finally arrive so he could introduce Cal to Teddy. He couldn't wait. Despite their age difference, he was sure the two boys would get along fabulously. Andi had already agreed to let Teddy stay over at the chateau while Harry and Draco went on their honeymoon, giving the boys a chance to get to know each other. Harry wondered if Narcissa knew what she was getting herself into – either boy could be a terror in his own right, and together Harry was sure they'd have the start of the next generation of the Marauders on their hands.
Draco fidgeted with his cuff links, clenching his hands and forcing them to his sides when he caught himself. Malfoys did
Draco wondered, hoping he could redirect his thoughts enough to avoid using the spell again. It wasn't exactly painful, but it wasn't a comfortable sensation, either.
His heart was pounding in his chest, his body already slick with exertion though he'd yet to even enter Harry. Draco carefully positioned himself at Harry's entrance, teasing the loosened hole with the head of his cock before slowly - excruciatingly and punishingly slowly- easing it inside and past the ring of muscle that immediately tensed at his intrusion. He held his position, not even daring to breathe, until he felt Harry relax around him, gently, carefully, reverently pushing deeper until he was fully seated.
"Devastated Auror caught in love triangle between Boy-Who-Lived and Puddlemere Keeper!" the headline screamed, accompanied by a picture of a distraught-looking Smith shielding his face as he left a restaurant.
Luna smiled softly, nuzzling her face against the warm bundle in her arms before handing it over to Harry. Draco stood behind him, a look of complete awe on his face.
"I'm not just anyone, and that's fabulous," he said, truly happy for his friends. Neville and Daphne had married less than a year after he had. Initially, Draco had questioned his friend's decision, but as he got to know Nev, he began to see the same brave, beautiful, courageous man Daphne did. "Really. I'm thrilled for you two. When is she due?"
Harry looked at Draco, who hadn't moved from the chair. One elegant eyebrow was arched, and Harry knew his tardiness had been noted.
"I'm sorry to be rushing this, gentlemen," Kingsley said softly, pulling Harry's attention back to the task at hand.
over the last few weeks, eager to learn more about his and his father's namesake constellations. When he'd learned he was going to have a sister, he'd focused even more on learning some of the more obscure ones. He'd liked his parents' choice of Lyra or Vela before he met his sister, but neither of the names seemed to fit the blonde-haired, green-eyed baby in his dad's arms.
Harry very nearly closed the window, growling out loud at yet another attempt to get his attention with a lame pick up line.
"Wards," came the answer to his unvoiced question, the voice becoming louder as the man approached. "You triggered them when you entered the vineyard."
Good for shock value, but probably detrimental to his cause if he really wanted Harry to stick around.
"Don't worry about this," he said, waving the small stack of parchment. "I'll take care of it. I'll send you an Owl after the meeting. You should go home, get some rest."
"He's out with the team," she said after a moment, her expression reluctant. She clearly didn't want to have this conversation.
Draco sighed, switching tactics. He was trying to pull together one of their infamous Slytherin parties, and for that he needed Theo.
"Harry? Draco? I have some books I think you two should take a look at," she called from the other room. She knew enough to stay there until they came to her – the last person who had surprised the couple, Ron, had been Stunned.
"You lived in there?" Draco asked, his voice incredulous. He wouldn't let a house-elf live in those conditions, let alone a little boy.
"You should thank Neville and Blaise too," he said easily, purposefully misinterpreting Draco's words. He knew the blond was talking about his role in bringing Cartwell down, but he really didn't want to talk about it. Not tonight, at least. "They spent all morning in there with me."
Harry and Hermione had been in favor of having a traditional Muggle ceremony, but Draco and Narcissa had been strongly against it. In the end, they'd decided to write their own vows, being careful to avoid any words that might have magical implications.
"I suppose I should have asked," he said sheepishly, risking a glance at Draco. He relaxed when he saw the other wizard was smiling.
Draco stood, frozen, as Harry approached, his lungs screaming for air as he held his breath, hoping the wizard wouldn't notice him.
George nodded, stepping into the Floo in Harry's study and disappearing in a whoosh of green flame. His audience gone, Harry allowed himself to dissolve into giggles, laughing madly at the thought of George's modified cock ring causing his member to harden at the slightest touch, even after it had been removed. He was sure the poor man was practically in agony, but it was still amusing. And George
"Fucking hell, Harry!" Ron shouted when the Auror hit the ground, his eyes blazing with anger as he watched his friend get to his feet shakily. "What the fuck, were you thinking?"
immortalize his love for Draco and Cal in print, even if no one but their friends knew who had inspired the characters.
"Your compassion astounds me," the blond drawled. He was surprisingly steady after the four tumblers of whisky he'd already consumed.
Draco popped another DVD into the player yet again glad he'd purchased the Muggle device a few years ago. Like all electronics, it had taken some complicated warding to protect it from the ambient magic in the room, but it was all worth it now.
"Harry, Weasley," Blaise said, pulling a similar medallion from around his own neck and tossing it to Harry. "Use it only when it is safe for us to return."
"It's Mr. Potter-Black for me, as well," he said, smirking when the man actually flinched when he looked at him. "Harry and I aren't just married, we share an eternity bond."
He sighed, bored with the film already. Deciding a book might hold his interest better, Draco turned the television off and Summoned the first edition copy of
Draco bit his lip, wondering if he should ask Harry what his intentions toward Caleum were. He passed over it, deciding it could wait until after the marriage contract was signed. He'd prefer it if Harry adopted Cal outright, but it wouldn't be the end of the world if he didn't. He knew Harry would likely want to have at least one child of his own, preferably two, to carry on the Potter and Black names. Harry was great with Cal, and Draco didn't doubt he'd show the boy as much love as he did any biological children he might have, even if he didn't legally adopt him.
"Everything going well, then?" Harry asked when Ron returned with a small pot of butterscotch, averting his eyes as Ginny poured the lot of it over her vinegar-soaked chips. Her small moan of pleasure at the taste of the combination had him gagging silently.
He had a deadline coming up, and he'd been too distracted by Sly's messages to really concentrate on it. Shoving the temptation to drink away his disappointment, Harry re-settled the laptop on his knees, his brow furrowing as he called up the document he'd been working on and began to write. Maybe this forced separation from Sly would be a good thing – he might actually get some work done himself.
"You're naked!" Draco cried, his eyes still wide from watching Harry, clad only in an apron, bending over the stove.
"An open letter from the Savior of the Wizarding World about his mystery love interest, inside on Page 8!"
"Harry James Potter-Black, Head of the House of Potter, you have petitioned the Ministry to adopt Caleum Alexander Malfoy. Is this your wish?"
Blaise had been by earlier, assuring him Cal was safe and that no word had spread yet to the wizarding papers. Everyone was back in the chateau, which Blaise assured him had only suffered minimal damage in Cartwell's attack. He'd also brought Harry's present from the day before with him, a small vial of Pensieve memories. Draco had sent it home with Blaise, unwilling to take the risk of someone picking it up by accident at St. Mungo's. He had a feeling it wasn't something Harry would want anyone else to see.
They chatted on about wedding plans for awhile, and Draco gave Theo a few suggestions for Ron's stag party when the wizard rejoined them after clearing up in the kitchen. Draco and Cal didn't stay much longer, since he needed to get the young boy home and to bed.
Silver was the predominant color in the room, celebrating the couple's rare bond. It could easily have been overdone and tacky, but there was no chance of that happening with Narcissa Malfoy at the helm. She'd spent days poring over plans with Daphne, occasionally joined by Luna and Hermione and even more rarely, Draco or Harry. The effect she'd managed was elegant and glamorous, with just the right amount of sparkle and glitz to add an almost fairytale quality to the room.
Harry shook his head still stunned the spell had worked. Something had happened when it was combined with Ron's
"I hope he is," Caleum whispered, snuggling closer to Blaise, leaving the man wide-awake with surprise while he fell into a fitful sleep.
Draco's eyes widened in horror as he absently watched Potter turn an alarming shade of red, noting with detachment that it didn't look like the Gryffindor was breathing at all. He had much more important things to worry about. Like the fact that
"It's perfect," he murmured, pressing another kiss to his daughter's head before handing her to his husband so he could gather his almost-too-big son in his arms or a hug.
"You're not going anywhere, Malfoy," he said, his tone suddenly professional as he checked Draco's pulse. "Your breathing's still a little erratic, but your heart rate has stabilized."
“You can definitely manage the spell,” she said, leaning forward to whisper in his ear. He shivered as her hot breath ghosted over his neck. “You just haven’t had the right motivation.”
Whatever Harry had been about to say in his own defense was stopped by the faint ping that accompanied a new email. His gaze dropped to the screen, and he nearly shouted when he saw an email from Sly.
Harry nodded. Hermione noted his earnest expression and sighed in resignation. If Harry was going to have an internet dating ad, then Hermione would make sure it was the very best it could be. By the time the two were finished, they had crafted an ad that clearly spelled out what Harry was looking for in a partner, keeping the language and tone casual and easy, just like Harry.
"Harry Potter, representing Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes," the dark-haired man said from the back of the room.
"It will be fine," Harry repeated, easily following Draco's troubled thoughts. "Ward and lock the room, and I'll be through in twenty minutes. We won't do anything that will interfere with the courtship, I promise."
"One can only hope," she muttered, dousing the lights on their way out. She had a feeling things were going to get even more uncomfortable when Harry and Draco could touch each other freely. She just hoped they waited until everyone left before jumping each other tomorrow.
write those emails, didn't you, Potter? You didn't farm them out to Hermione or someone else, did you?"
The book was taking a different path than he'd originally imagined, but he was happy with it. Harry grinned, saving his work and stretching again as he stood. Until now, the Aurors he wrote about were all single, and happily so. His main character in this manuscript, though, was married with a son. A six-year-old son, who liked puppies and snowball fights.
"No, Harry, no!" Teddy giggled, his eyes on Freddie to make sure he didn't hit her as he flailed. "No, you can't!"
It was unexpected that I would meet an old acquaintance by random chance and find myself instantly attracted to him.
"A few more hours," Ron whispered in his ear, his gentle tone a startling contrast to the vice-like grip he had on Harry's arm.
"That's barbaric," Hermione complained, her words slightly slurred from too much celebration. "Buying someone's love?"
"Thank you," he whispered, his voice thick with unshed tears. Ron had done something highly illegal to keep Cal safe. "Thank you."
, as though part of Harry was now inside him. He didn't have to try to cast anything with Harry's wand; some part of him
"I'm fine," the wizard said, rummaging through the bag for a sandwich of his own. He stripped off the meat and cheese, eating the piece of bread plain.
I, Harry James Potter of the Noble Houses of Black and Potter, do hereby formally announce my intention to court and marry. As is my right and due by virtue of my station, I am here by invoking
She smiled weakly, a sick feeling blossoming in her stomach. She grasped for a subject change, babbling about the problems Hermione was having finding the types of flowers she wanted, which were apparently out of season in Great Britain this time of year, and the snit Molly was in because they'd insisted on having the reception catered instead of letting her take care of it.
"Oh," she said, unable to figure out what else she should say. Was Draco really here seeking advice about pursing Harry?
Hermione sniffed, clearly skeptical. After all, it sounded like it was all a ploy for gifts. Harry had been frantic yesterday when he hadn't heard back from Draco about a gift, worrying he had offended the man by sending something so trivial. The thank-you owl had come shortly after his panic attack, but the memory worried Hermione. What if Draco didn't think Harry's gifts were worthy?
"These H-Horcruxes," Draco stammered, his eyes still locked on the rock where memory Ron had destroyed the locket only moments before, "That's – why – how –"
"The publishing house asked for a more youthful look," she said, biting her lip as she studied him carefully. "They wanted this latest photo to be hip and sexy."
"Yes, that's it exactly," she giggled, closing Harry's laptop and heading back toward the Floo. She'd left Ron alone in the kitchen, which meant breakfast was probably a disaster. "I'll see you later, Harry. Think about what I said, alright? You should tell him who you are – or at least that you're James Evans – before you meet."
The grizzled Auror perked up at the new information, pulling Draco's file closer to him. It didn't say anything about the existence of a chateau in France.
"Sir," he said formally, inclining his head at Snape a though he weren't sitting there completely starkers and the man
"He said you were resting. I'm not bothering you, am I? I can come later," Harry said, unsure of what the protocol for visiting new mothers was.
Neville burst into the room, ready to pull Teddy and Caleum apart if he had to. From the ruckus he'd heard from the other room, he was sure the two boys were at each other's throats. He skidded to a stop in the middle of Draco's study, shocked to see the bickering boys sitting next to each other, Teddy's arm wrapped around Cal's thin shoulders, arguing with a portrait.
“It was brilliant,” he murmured against her lips, letting his renewed erection brush against her hip so she knew he was only teasing as he continued on “–and shocking behavior from the famed Gryffindor princess.”
He dutifully followed the instructions, turning to the second page. Maybe Harry had signed it? Draco's breath caught as he read the only printed words on the page. The dedication page.
Draco used his thumb to tip the plastic man's head open, cupping his palm underneath to catch the sweet that fell out. He popped it in his mouth, grimacing at the too-sugary confection. He offered one to Neville, who politely declined.
Neville watched as Draco cast the box aside, holding a slightly scuffed wand in his right hand. Why would Harry have sent Draco a wand? Wands were extremely personal, not something another person could choose for someone. Hell, that was the reason he'd had such trouble at Hogwarts. He'd been using his dad's wand, at his grandmother's insistence. Wands chose the wizard, not the other way around.
"No, thank you," he said, tossing a Galleon onto her tray anyway. She smiled and winked at him, moving on to another table.
"I just need to know that you're going to explain it all to him some day," Neville said suddenly as he made to leave, his gaze seeking Harry's assurances.
Grey eyes sought him out across the crowded club, and Harry's pulse jumped when they made eye contact.
, Draco thought, studying Potter's striking green eyes, full of love and pride. Draco tamped down a feeling of what he refused to acknowledge as jealousy at Potter's expression, telling himself it was merely the old rivalry between them rearing up again. Why should
Draco thanked Merlin and every god he could think of when the maitre 'd appeared, oblivious to the tension between the men, and offered to lead him to his table. He watched Harry for a moment longer before nodding, following the man deeper into the restaurant without another word to Harry or Ron.
He resumed his offensive against Cal's stomach, not stopping until the boy started flailing and he nearly lost his grip. Laughing himself, Blaise lowered the now-boneless boy to the floor, gently settling him against the priceless Aubusson.
He hadn't been available for meetings lately, but the business hadn't suffered. Blaise was talented enough to run it on his own, not that Draco would ever tell the man. His ego was already big enough.
Harry took a step closer to Draco, taking his hand again. Though he doubted it was real, he could have sworn he could hear Draco's rapid heartbeat. Then again, it could just have been the echo of his own.
“It is, isn’t it?” Draco replied without the slightest bit of modesty. Slytherin was known for its killer parties, and he wasn’t above taking credit when he was the mastermind.
Ron cut him off, smiling smugly as he took a forkful of Harry's rice. It was an intentionally casual gesture, meant to show the other man that their conversation was over. "Oh, Harry wasn't at the wedding alone, Zach," he said, taking a bite to let the wizard have a few moments to mull his statement over. "He was there with someone he's
"No, wait," Draco said, holding up a hand when he saw Ron's discomfort. "Don't answer that. I'm betting tomorrow's gift will explain it. That git's too Slytherin for his own good."
Kingsley paused, his gaze traveling around the room. He knew how much Harry had been looking forward to a big wedding ceremony, and he wanted to give him as much of the pomp and pageantry as he could, even here, amid only their closest friends in Harry's study.
Three days later, Harry was still waiting for his reply. Hermione's rational influence quelled his panic; surely Sly was still on his trip, and he would reply when he could. While Harry knew that was likely the case, he couldn't help but worry he had been too forward in his response. Sly's gesture with the wine had been so sweet, and Harry had admittedly imbibed several glasses before he hit send after writing his latest missive. Sly seemed sophisticated; maybe his sloppy approach had offended him?
"I was kidding, Hermione," he said, his lips twitching in amusement. Why was she so worked up over where he sat at the reception?
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's waist, crouching down so he could see Blaise in the Floo. They'd already called Hermione and Ron, letting them know it might be a few more days before they were ready to see anyone.
, she thought with a smile as she squeezed his shoulder and stepped back, intending to leave the room so he could change.
he thought, cursing himself roundly for making this into a competition when he felt Gryffin's grip change, the unfamiliar planes of his other palm now grazing over Draco's heated skin. The tendons stood out on Draco's wrist as he fisted his bright-red cock, his tongue raw from pushing up against his teeth as he struggled not to moan. He would
Part of him was soaring at the knowledge that Harry was in love with him. He wanted nothing more than to throw caution to the wind and go after him. The other, more rational, part held Draco back. There was no hope of it withstanding today's 24-7 news cycle and the constant barrage of press. No one had invoked
"Oh Daph, that's wonderful news!" Hermione gushed, forgetting her concern over what was playing out in the other room as she and Pansy rushed forward for more details.
"No, not yet," Draco said, frowning slightly. "I'm not sure I'm ready, Blaise. What if he has a horrid reaction to my identity? I just don't want to lose whatever it is that we've got going on."
"It wouldn't be a bad thing to take this slow, like he says, Draco," Blaise said after reading the email. He smirked at the signature – a Gryffindor?
“It’s a difficult concept, Theo,” she said, stroking the back of his hand with her thumb. It certainly wasn’t out of his grasp as a wizard, but she could tell it was making him doubt his skills. “It isn’t that you
says –" Harry broke off, looking at Ron with concern. "Are you alright, mate? Not having second thoughts are you? Because Hermione would kill us both, you know."
"I think I know," Ron said carefully, piecing everything together in his head. Everything he knew about Sly. Everything he knew about Malfoy.
Draco sighed, narrowing his eyes as he looked at the man who, against all odds, had become one of his closest friends. "Fine. Firewhisky, though."
"But –" Draco looked around, dazed. Surely, Neville wouldn't allow the greenhouse to be turned into a wintry retreat. What about the delicate plants? The fragile fruit trees Neville cherished were covered in snow, their leaves a shockingly vibrant green against the white flakes. "The snow, the plants! It's –"
Harry shrugged, taking another slow sip. Draco watched his throat work as he swallowed, feeling the blood rush to his already half-hard cock at the sight.
Now, though, ten minutes before the ceremony was about to start, he was beginning to get anxious. He hadn't seen Blaise, Cal, Harry or Kingsley for more than an hour. He could feel Harry through their bond, so he knew the man was happy and excited – if not for that reassurance, Draco might have torn the chateau apart looking for him.
not? – they'd be great together. They're both strong-willed enough to reign each other in, and they're both capable of a tremendous amount of love and affection. It's something neither had as a child, not really, and you know they both crave it. And Harry really wants children. I think he'd adore Cal."
He could feel the tension radiating off both men, and it had a distinctly sexual feel to it. Plenty of anxiety as well, he could tell, but he had a hunch it was going to be a challenge to keep the two of them apart much longer. He knew Harry's plans though, and he figured the Pensieve memories would help dampen their arousal.
Kingsley laid the contract down on the table, tapping it twice with his wand over the Ministry Seal. The seal glowed deep purple, accepting him as an official with the authority to oversee the oath.
Draco felt Harry relax underneath him, reveling in the corresponding hot feeling of satisfaction sweeping through his own body, knowing his lover wanted him any way he could get him. He didn't put much stock in traditional romance, and he doubted he ever would. Oh, he realized Harry would need him to trot out the traditional trappings every so often – pretty words and unexpected gestures – but he also knew in that moment that Harry would accept him for who he was, as well as who he wasn't.

"Caleum," Draco said sternly, "We've discussed this. It's better for you to remain in France where you won't be constantly hounded by reporters. You know I love having you at the Manor, and I hate when I have to leave you, but it's for your own good."
!" Draco shouted, his outrage covering the gasp that had escaped his lips when he felt Harry's hand caress his balls.
Draco slipped one of the bracelets around his wrist, shivering slightly as the cold metal snaked around his skin. He tossed the other to Harry, relieved when it crossed the barrier ward without a problem. He grabbed the vial of potion next making sure it was tightly capped before throwing it to Harry as well.
"Completely," Kingsley assured him, his white teeth gleaming as he grinned. He was beyond pleased to be officiating another wedding ceremony for Harry and Draco – this one the glamorous affair both men deserved, full of family, friends, laughter and champagne.
Harry might have tackled Draco the second he stepped out of the Floo had it not been for Ron's restraining hand on his bicep. The tight squeeze reminded him where they were and what they had to do. The magic of the ancient spells that forged the courtship and marriage contracts was enhancing the natural attraction and pull he and Draco felt for each other, which meant Harry was nearly jumping out of his skin with need.
"Went a bit awry. The sensitizing charm was … too much," George said, moving gingerly toward the Floo.
"Yes," Harry said, wrinkling his nose in mock distaste. "Theo's set up some sort of bar crawl that ends at the strip club in Knockturn Alley."
He watched in horror as the blond git moved through the crowd –how was it possible to look graceful whilst dodging drunken dancers? – and approached the trio near the bar, nearly groaning when Ron slapped him on the back, leaning in to talk with him over the loud music.
Pansy's grimace softened as she considered Neville's words, the possibilities becoming clearer. Neville
"He is, but James Evans is a penname," Draco said, twirling the glass absently on the table. He didn't notice Neville's eyes close, or the way the Gryffindor swallowed convulsively. "He uses a glamour, so the photo in his book isn't really him."
"Mmm," Harry moaned appreciatively when Draco's cool hand slid into his pajama bottoms, wrapping around his erection.
He tried to turn over, his eyes snapping open when his torso didn't respond to his command. He blinked sleepily and his arms automatically felt around for his son. Cal was splayed over Draco's chest, his head resting against his shoulder.
Luna startled everyone when she cleared her throat, clearly fighting back tears. Her husband, Rolph, sat at her side, stroking her hair lightly.
"Fine. Read it. But then you owe me three chapters, Harry Potter. You won't leave this house until I have them."
"I'll see you around, Pansy," he said before turning to nod stiffly at the blond, who moved from the doorway to let him pass. "Malfoy."
Harry nodded, unsure of how to answer. It wasn't hard to imagine Draco's reasons for keeping his son's existence a secret. It was amazing he'd managed it this long. Harry's resolve strengthened even more, his doubts about his relationship with Draco taking a backseat to his concern for the little boy.
The witch studied him curiously, her eyes wide as she took in his still-red face and the light sheen of sweat that now covered his upper lip.
Draco smoothed the duvet over his sleeping son, feathering kisses across his cheeks and forehead before spelling the lights off and creeping toward the door. C.C. was snoring softly in a small pile of blankets on the floor, though Draco predicted the fur ball would likely finish the night in bed with Cal. He'd never been allowed to have Argie on his own bed, but he didn't have the heart to place a similar restriction on Cal.
Draco thought morosely, reaching onto the table beside him to grab the box of malted milk balls Harry had sent over earlier. At least he had chocolate.
Nev nodded, his eyes sparkling with excitement even as his mind whirled. As happy as he was to have shared his news, he wasn't about to let Draco distract him from his original purpose – to find out what had the blond so upset. Blaise had Fire-called an hour ago to let him know Draco was on his way to France, apparently disturbed over something his online mystery man had said the night before.
Harry's dark mood lifted a bit as he was reminded of the revision tables and homework schedules Hermione used to torment him with in school. Things hadn't changed that much. He supposed that was the danger of having one of your best friends as your agent. He offered her a contrite grin of apology. She smiled sweetly back.
Seamus and Dean elected to stay as well, leaving Theo and Blaise to help Draco get the two men home. They decided Apparating was too dangerous in their current state – and Draco was too tired to take the lot of them by Side-Along – so they opted to Floo from the Leaky Cauldron.
– unless his translation was wrong. He didn't know what Smith was playing at – the decidedly nasty turn the articles had taken definitely didn't make it seem like he truly wanted a reconciliation.
The dark-haired wizard smiled, rummaging around in his pocket for a small plastic toy. He sat the PEZ dispenser on her desk, digging further until he found a photo as well.
"And it's a bit hard to attract a fit-looking wizard when you're knee-deep in witches, I suppose," she said with a laugh.
"We've had a few last-minute additions. A couple more classmates that hadn't thought they could make it, and then Gin asked me to add two people as well," she said carefully, cringing as she looked at the newest name on the guest list.
lab?" he asked incredulously. "That thing took three adults four hours to set up! He's been engrossed in experiments ever since it came. He may give you a run for your money, Draco. I have a feeling you won't have the highest Malfoy Potions N.E.W.T. score in a few years."
, he thought as he watched Draco un-ward the Floo and Fire-call his own solicitor, heedless of the late hour.
“This calls for a reward,” she murmured, letting her hands slide down his body to rest on his cock, which was straining against the fabric of his trousers.
"I think I fucked it up," Draco said, his head buried in his hands. Blaise crossed his legs, waiting for the blond to explain. "He told me he's James Evans, and I freaked out."
He scanned through the emails in his inbox, scrolling down until he found one from Gryffin. Curious, he thought. There was only one, and it was dated the day he left. He opened it quickly.
Draco glanced around his office, grateful the Aurors hadn't trashed the place in search of proof that he had embezzled money from the Atalier Family. All they'd find, of course, was proof that Draco had discovered the problem some months earlier and recently started monitoring the business' accounts. Bloody idiots. They'd just ensured their son would do time in Azkaban for embezzlement. Draco hadn't reported his findings to the Ministry, hoping the Ataliers would be able to resolve it without the help of the courts. Once charges had been filed though, there was no way to go back. Cato would be held accountable for his actions now that his parents had filed a formal complaint of embezzlement.
"If there are any here who have legitimate claim to Caleum Alexander Malfoy and who do not wish this bond to continue, please speak now."
They'd shared a lot of mundane facts about themselves, arguing back and forth about wine and favorite foods, trading jokes and tidbits of their daily lives that wouldn't give them away. Harry was still laughing about the anecdote Sly had told him about his secretary last week – by all rights, it sounded like
"At first glance, I thought it was horrible," Neville continued, laughing softly when Pansy nodded emphatically. "But then I really considered it, and it makes sense. They're perfect for each other."
"There is no antidote to Veritaserum, at least nothing that can be taken after ingestion," Seamus said, uncorking two of the vials. "Your magic literally expelled the potion after you passed out. It's probably what saved your life."
Ron nodded. "Mum said Gin and Theo felt an instant connection, too. It's how she knew Theo was serious."
"I, er, should go with him," she stammered, watching Ron approach Neville. The two men headed out toward the gardens, and Ginny started to follow. "Ron doesn't know anything about flowers. I should make sure he's telling Neville the right thing."
Computers and other electronic devices did not respond well to magic, which meant taking them through a Floo ride or Apparating with them could cause the devices to short out. Harry's laptop had wards around it to shield it from the ambient magic in his home, but those protections wouldn't hold up to the forces of magical transportation.
Theo frowned, raising his wand to try the spell again. He looked up, surprised, when Hermione stopped him.
Instead of backing off, the Auror slid into an empty chair at their table, earning a low growl of warning from Ron. "The papers will have a field day with this little rendezvous of yours, you know. First Oliver, now Ron? Poor Hermione."
Draco's hand found Harry's under the podium, squeezing it tightly. Just a few more questions, and they could head back to France. Neither missed living in London, though they did make it a point to stay in one of the Malfoy flats in the city several times a year. Never Grimmauld Place; that was why Harry was so willing to have the press conference there. With any luck, the media would camp out in front of it, hoping for a glimpse of the family, never realizing they didn't actually live there.
"He seems to know a lot about babies," she added, looking over his shoulder to watch as Caleum carefully pressed a kiss to the sleeping girl's forehead.
“Fucking hell, Hermione,” Theo ground out, releasing his death grip on the chair and letting himself buck up into her mouth. It only took a few more strokes and sucks before he was coming hard enough to see spots.
Harry could feel it immediately – an almost physical ache inside him that demanded contact with Draco. Their joined hands were no longer enough and he whimpered when he felt pulled toward the blond as though they were magnets. The urge was nearly too strong to fight. Their magical cores were now bound and reaching out to each other, seeking to reunite with the familiar magical signature of the other.
"Can't," Draco ground out as Harry's thumb swept over the head of his cock, the sensation further heightened by the smear of precome that had gathered there. "Too much. Can't –" he broke off, his words lost in a moan. "
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. I dream about them, write about them, and generally obsess over them, but they aren't mine. Thanks to Kamerreon for the beta … you rock!
Kingsley risked a glance back at Harry and Draco, his face heating as he realized they had already shed their robes, still wrapped around each other in a passionate kiss, their hands ripping at their remaining clothing.
asked Harry if it would be alright for the shop to carry a similar product, since he figured Harry's idea would appeal to more than a few wizards out there.
Kingsley examined both signatures, nodding as he tapped his wand to the final blank on the parchment.
"So you'll be over here," she said, tapping her wand to a table near the side of the room. She knew Harry hated sitting with his back exposed, so placing him near the wall made sense. She'd seen Draco at enough events over the years to know it was his preference, as well.
"The Diagon Alley warehouse isn't as cut and dried," he continued. "The zoning there is less clear, and I have the junior counsel looking into precedent. We'll need to know how other clubs and pubs are zoned and which permits we'll need before we try to go before the board. I'll have that report on your desk within the week."
, Potter," he drawled, smirking in satisfaction when the dark-haired man blushed a deeper crimson, his green eyes widening behind stylish wire rims. "Though I'm surprised emails have the same effect on you as the
"What part doesn't he know? That you were a Death Eater? That you still dabble in the Dark Arts? That you're a cold-hearted bastard who isn't capable of love?"
Harry groaned in frustration, wondering why Draco had stopped. They'd waited months to get here, and now that he finally had Draco inside him, Harry wanted him to
"No worries, Hermione," he said, grinning. He could set her mind at ease if that was what she was worrying about. "I don't mind sitting with the left-overs."
"Oh, for Merlin's sake," Draco sighed rolling his eyes at Neville's pregnant pause. "I'm not angry with you, though part of me wants to be. And I don't need to be indulged or pandered to. I'm fine."
A wave of disappointment so heavy it was almost palpable shot through him as he read the words on the screen – an apology from Sly, saying he'd be out of contact for a few days while out of the office on a business trip. Harry sighed, running a hand through his messy hair. He glanced from his laptop to the bottle of whisky, his eyes narrowed as he thought.
People always talked about how a bride glowed, and they were right. Hermione was no exception – she looked ravishing, and so happy it almost made Draco's heart hurt to watch. But Weasley – he looked like he'd gotten every birthday and Christmas at once, so shining with love and joy that his entire face lit up.
, what do you mean? Take care of me? A father's job is to take care of his son, not the other way around," Draco said, fighting to keep his voice calm.
Cal murmured something sleepily, nestling deeper into Harry's arms. They'd spent the afternoon skating and playing in the snow, breaking for a quick picnic amid the twinkling Christmas trees before opening the pile of presents Harry had brought. As Cal had suspected, most were for him. The best – and most surprising – had been a tiny Crup puppy, which Harry trotted out from a hiding spot at the back of the greenhouse after Cal and Draco had unwrapped everything under the tree.
done something? Where would that leave his relationship with him? A note stuck to the screen caught Harry's attention, and he leaned over to grab it.
He was unprepared for the jolt of magic that wrapped around him. It was so unlike what he'd experienced in the promissory ceremony with Patrizia. He'd felt the tingle of the ancient magic then, but nothing like this. He could
"It's a Muggle sweet," Draco answered, studying the item carefully. "Harry collects them. This one is made to look like Justin Timberlake."
Draco stilled his hips, his eyes trained on Harry as he tried to gauge the other man's response. It was true that they'd never once talked of who would top or bottom, but this had felt natural and right. Draco didn't mind bottoming, and quite enjoyed it on occasion. Still, he always felt most in control when he was on top, when he could control the depth and pace of the strokes, when he was the partner responsible for bringing them both to the height of pleasure.
"Yes," he moaned, his hips bucking as the spells spread pleasurably through him, preparing him for Draco's cock.
He knew Hermione would do her best to negotiate a shorter tour, knowing that Harry hated public appearances. Keeping up the glamour was draining, and he disliked being in large crowds. He hadn't been comfortable as the center of attention years ago, and he still wasn't now. Wearing a face that wasn't his made it somewhat easier, even though he'd recently begun to wonder why he'd chosen the features and coloring he had.
Harry had Floo-ed to Pansy's office first thing that morning to cancel his account with Magical Dating Online. She'd tried to talk him out of it, but the stubborn Gryffindor wouldn't be dissuaded.
"You were the one who wanted this much control," she whispered, her lips grazing his ear as he bent to accommodate her. "You were the one who fought to be so involved in the editing process. They don't do this for most writers, you know. You could at least pretend to be interested."
Though he hadn't thought it possible, things got worse. Draco watched, his stomach plummeting with each passing second, as Harry replayed the rest of the Battle of Hogwarts in precise, horrifying, sickening detail. All through it, Harry repeated his litany of apology, repeating the words over and over until they were nearly a meaningless hum in the background.
"Of course you are," Theo said, rolling his eyes. "Perfectly fine. The Healers routinely keep people in the hospital for two nights when nothing's wrong with them."
Harry. Draco closed his eyes, fighting back a flood of panic. It was ridiculous to be worried about him now, after the fact, but he still couldn't wrap his mind around the fact that Harry had nearly been killed yesterday. He was a stupid, stubborn, beautiful man, Draco realized. Harry hadn't given a second thought to putting his own life on the line to save Cal's. Draco relaxed slightly, trying to regulate his breathing. Harry knew about Cal, and he wasn't angry. Oh, he was sure the man wasn't pleased, especially to have found out the way he did, but he was still proceeding with their courtship. He still wanted to be part of Draco's – and Cal's – life.
"Don't be ridiculous," Smith drawled, and Harry had to bite back a snarl. He hated everything about the man – especially the fact that he'd lost his virginity to him. "You're the best man. You can't leave."
The name niggled at Blaise's mind, but he didn't know why. Did they know a James Evans? Someone from a younger year at Hogwarts, maybe?
Ron grimaced, wincing gingerly after jumping down off the tabletop. He couldn’t remember exactly what he’d been doing up there, but between Draco’s smirk, Lavender’s glare and Harry’s blush, he was pretty sure it was bad.
"I'm going," he said, directing his words at Blaise instead of the infuriated blond. "Fire-call me later, yeah?"
Twenty minutes later, Kingsley stood in front of the same tall table they'd used for the promissory ceremony. Harry had dragged it into the study, thinking it would be best to minimize the amount of time the wizard spent in the house and limit his access to the room with the Floo. It seemed safest, just in case the bond didn't accept him as a non-threat. Kingsley's wife stood off to the side, looking both sad and excited for the man she considered a son and his bond mate.
he thought dryly, his lips quirking at the awful image of Madam Malkin's pins anywhere near his bits.
quite loveable, as was Cal, Draco reasoned. And Harry was obviously comfortable with children, seeming to know exactly what to say and do to put Cal at ease.
know, right?" Ron asked, cornering Neville as soon as they were out of earshot. The rehearsal dinner was in full swing inside, with everyone enjoying cocktails before Molly's home-cooked meal.
Ron was surprised when Harry joined them on the dance floor as the song ended, stealing Hermione away for the next dance with a huge smile on his face. Ginny appeared at his elbow, and he held her stiffly, his dancing even clumsier than it had been with his bride.
"I'm glad he hasn't fallen off the face of the Earth, Harry," she said slightly condescendingly. "And you're right; he was terribly rude to leave his response this long. Now shut the bloody hell up and get to work!"
"You're a peach, Madge-pie. An absolute queen among witches," Blaise said, batting his eyelashes at her coquettishly.
Though they hadn't spoken about it, he knew Draco was following the stories obsessively. Oliver had Fire-called a few nights ago after having a few drinks at the Manor, promising that he'd managed to convince Draco that nothing was going on between him and Harry. Neville pushed back from the table, ready to head out to the greenhouse for a bit. Draco had finally agreed to take the magnolia trees out of Stasis, and he needed to check up on them to make sure they were suffering no ill effects.
Their eyes met for a moment as they fumbled to uncork the vials, not looking away as they blindly brought the potion to their lips, swallowing at the same time. Draco shuddered as he felt the potion slide down his throat, accompanied almost immediately by a heightened awareness. He could feel the slight breeze from a half-opened window caress his skin, the soft touch making his cock jump. He grabbed his wand to activate the bracelet, his eyes falling shut at the unbelievable sensation of the cold silver sliding down his arm as he did.
Draco swallowed, the need to feel Harry's skin against his own was almost overpowering. Neville's arm tightened around his shoulders, letting him move forward, but restraining him at the same time.
Harry smiled sadly, watching Neville take another drink. He hadn't even tried to get a word in edgewise during the usually calm man's furious rant, correctly assuming Neville was looking to vent, not looking for answers. Now though, it seemed he was ready to listen.
"Oh, good. Blaise said you were there, but I didn't believe him. Is Cal alright?" she asked, puzzled as to why Draco would be in France on a weekday.
"I can tell you know that permission will not be given to photograph or speak with Caleum, and the same will go for Carina when she reaches Hogwarts."
Saturday's gift was sitting on the coffee table in front of him, with several passages marked for future use.
Harry laughed again, something tight loosening in his chest. This little boy – this perfect copy of Draco, with olive skin and black hair – was everything and nothing like he'd expected in the frenzied hour since he'd learned of his existence. Beautiful, privileged, confident, smart, brave – Harry looked at Neville's hand on the boy's shoulder, following it up to offer an encouraging smile to the stoically silent man –
"No, none," he said, his voice a bit scratchy with disuse. He wasn't allowed a very active role in the editing process. As Hermione had said, it was a miracle he was there at all, and only because she'd insisted. He hadn't had the privilege the first few times around, but as a best-selling novelist, he had some pull now. "Thank you. It's fabulous. Brilliant work, everyone."
He looked at Draco appraisingly, resting his hip against the bed as he tipped a potion against his closed lips. Draco tightened them, unwilling to take anything until he knew exactly what was going on.
time, don't drink so much so fast," Bill said, rolling his eyes. "I haven't had to use that spell since we found Percy flat-out tanked in the back yard after he proposed to Penelope the first time and she said no."
The blond glared at Blaise, marching over to snatch his wand from the man's outstretched hand. He'd been irritable for the past few days, since their chaperones – namely Blaise and Hermione – had decided it was inadvisable for Draco and Harry to see each other at all until the day the no-touching ban ended.
Draco's brow furrowed for a moment as he leafed through a large stack of parchment, messages Madge had given him the moment he entered the office. He'd missed several fairly important meetings yesterday afternoon, but he hadn't been in any frame of mind to stay.
Draco blinked back the sudden prick of tears at having his son in his arms again, healthy and whole. He didn't even register Cal's familiar use of Harry's name until the boy was wiggling away, small-gloved hands pulling at Draco's arm to get him to stand.
Cal hesitated, then placed his own in Harry's larger palm, shaking his hand. "My name is Caleum Malfoy."
he assured himself, his brow furrowed as he tried to remember why if he'd actually modeled the glamour after Malfoy, or if it had just been a fluke.
his son looked in Harry's arms, their dark heads touching as Harry carefully bent to tuck the sleeping boy into bed. He'd completely exhausted himself playing in the snow and had fallen asleep on the picnic blanket about an hour earlier.
Harry smiled sleepily, pushing his computer to the far side of the bed and allowing the letter to settle on the bed. He was too tired and wrung out from finishing his novel to answer tonight, he decided. Sly had given him a lot to think about.
Cal rolled his eyes, looking so much like his father in that moment that a startled laugh slipped past Harry's lips.
"That's –" Ron said quietly, his eyes locked on Harry and Draco, who were still holding hands. The sparks everyone had seen literally fly between their skin, had gone as quickly as they'd begun, but the sight left everyone speechless. He had no idea how to explain it.
Harry whimpered, squeezing his eyes shut as a wave of nausea swept over him at the thought. He fumbled in the medicine cabinet, his hands closing over the last bottle of Hangover Potion. He spared a quick glance for Ron – still passed out cold in the tub – before uncorking it and downing it in one gulp. He could always go out to buy another for Ron later. This was an
on the table in front of her. Thankfully, Hermione noticed from her spot under the table, the girl had chosen a seat a few down from where she and Theo were sitting.
Draco shook his head and he heard Neville huff out an angry breath behind him. None of their friends understood how Patrizia could just walk away and never look back, but Draco had come to view it as a blessing in disguise.
"Isn't that a bit much?" Draco asked, a smile lighting his face when the tall, dark-haired man came into view.
Hermione fussed with Harry's newly lightened and lengthened hair, tucking it behind his ear and then changing her mind, roughing up the blond strands.
Hermione nodded, tears clouding her eyes. She wanted Harry's wedding to be special, but circumstances were preventing that. It was complicated, just like most of the rest of Harry's life. Just once, she'd love for her friend to have a normal experience.
But then Draco was kneeling above him, wrenching Harry's trousers completely off. He didn't take the time to similarly divest himself, instead simply unfastening the button and zipper and taking his thick cock in his hand, a sigh of pure relief escaping his lips as he gave himself several experimental strokes. Harry watched, eyes heavily lidded with desire, as Draco pleasured himself, his own cock jumping at the sight as though the pale hand was fisting it instead.
He watched Draco carefully, unsure of what part he'd played in Potter's latest bit of exhibitionist wanking. Something was up, he knew, from the way his normally calm godson flushed suddenly. Severus cast a speculative glance around the room, but found Draco's bedroom door still tightly shut. Not a spell, then.
. He didn't bother reading the article – likely more drivel about who the slimy Slytherin was dating now.
"You win, you little monster," she teased, packing the tiny pieces away in the box with her wand. "I still say you cheat."
"Excuse me," Draco said shortly, striding off toward the exit. He knew Pansy would follow him, which was fortunate, because this wasn't a conversation he wanted to have in the middle of a wedding reception.
"Going," Snape said, holding up his hands. He knew how much Potter meant to Draco, which meant he'd need to find a way to call a truce with the man or risk Draco removing the portrait. "Bring him to see me after you two are engaged."
Blaise closed his eyes briefly, nodding. It was likely that news of Cal's existence was spreading already.
Harry growled in frustration, pushing Draco back with his palms as he drew his body away from the blond's. Draco's confused frown became a smile when Harry pulled him down to the couch and straddled his lap, pausing so Draco could position his cock before sliding down onto it with a satisfied grunt.
"Eat. You need a shower, and we only have a few minutes," she said, crossing her arms as she leaned against the counter, watching him with narrowed eyes. "I told Abigail you had an emergency, but she expects us there this afternoon."
"Draco, you're angry you had to find out about your mother that way, but it's for the best. You needed to see it. And you need to trust that Harry didn't show you to gain the upper hand. He hasn't mentioned it to anyone but me, and I doubt Narcissa has either. She's already canceled the life debt," Neville continued, allowing himself a satisfied smile when Draco stiffened. Just as he'd thought – the bloody wanker was worried Harry had gone through with the courtship to satisfy the life debt. "She did it before he testified even, so forget that too."
"It felt like a shock for me," Daphne offered. "My mum warned me, so I was ready for it. No one told Nev, though, and he actually yelped when it happened."
Harry Potter, and if what the wizarding papers said was true, he could certainly afford the hefty price tag.
Harry snickered, wondering how Draco would react when he read it. He was sure the blond wouldn't like being cast as a woman, but Harry was a realist. Although homosexuality was accepted in the wizarding world, it still wasn't something most of the population was completely comfortable with. Not enough to buy books about a gay character, at least. He couldn't share their relationship with the world, and Harry realized that might not change for many years. Not until Cal was older or the climate in the wizarding world changed dramatically, where the Malfoy name was concerned. Still, he
“Not a bad idea,” Lavender said, handing the soda back to Draco and grabbing Ron’s wrist. “I can think of someone
Hermione's eyes narrowed at the rejection, but she straightened and sauntered over to the patch of sand Ron had settled onto to read the paper. Yesterday's news was more alluring than she was, was it? Hermione smirked. She'd change his mind about that.
They could hear him laughing as he disappeared. Ron waited until he heard Teddy's bedroom door shut before he whirled around, his brow furrowed as he spoke sharply to his wife.
"We were married a year after our repeated seventh year at Hogwarts," Draco continued, the words coming easier as he saw Harry didn't recoil. The sooner he did this, the sooner they could get on with things. "It was an arranged marriage. Her father contacted my mother, and I agreed. We hoped it might salvage the Malfoy name, but it didn't seem to make much difference."
He grinned. Some things never changed, and one of them was the way his red-headed friend always thought with his stomach.
Hermione accepted the mug of coffee Harry extended toward her, folding her legs beneath her as she sat in the large, comfy chair he offered. She pulled his computer into her lap, balancing the mug on the arm of the chair.
Harry almost growled in frustration. Malfoy was leaving? Just like that? Harry almost stood to follow him – though for the life of him he couldn't figure out why Malfoy leaving was a
The wizard smiled, confident in his sale. It would take a very powerful wizard to be able to detect the magic swirling around the piece. This was
"We divorced in 2005. January," he said with a grim smile. "Start the New Year off right, she'd said."
Harry sat across from her, his elbows on his knees, studying Hermione's face as she read. She was his agent, but more than that she was his biggest fan, and his toughest critic. If the ending was pants, she'd let him know. Hermione's lips pursed in concentration as she scrolled through the last three chapters of his novel, occasionally reaching out for her mug to take a sip of the strong, sweet coffee Harry had given her. He was just about to jump out of his skin when she finally looked up with a huge smile.
The last article had nothing to do with Draco Fire-calling Pansy, though. He assured himself he was only doing his duty as a good friend in checking up with the couple. It couldn't be an easy time for them, with reporters camped out on their doorstep and dogging after Oliver, hoping for a photo of him and Harry out somewhere together.
Oliver drew his head back out of the fire, shaking some ash off his robes as the green flames dissipated. He'd promised Blaise updates on how things were going, and he'd just made his second Fire-call of the afternoon. No one knew what was keeping Harry and Draco, though they worried one of the men might be having second thoughts.
have used – immediately shot to the forefront of his mind. But no, as usual, he'd blurted out the first thing that popped into his brain.
"She signed away all her parental rights with the divorce," Draco said with a sigh. "I bought her silence with a hefty settlement, and she was free to pursue the life she'd thought she was getting when she married me. It's probably for the best."
Blaise thought about the last few men who Draco had taken into his bed, which was how he always thought of it. They certainly weren't part of Draco's
Draco pulled a dormant Golden Snitch out of his pocket, absently stroking it until its tiny wings began to flutter. It was charmed to stay put until thrown, so he didn't have to worry about it escaping and wreaking havoc through the chateau. It was a poor substitute for Harry, but since it had been one of the gifts from him, accompanied by a written promise to play a Seeker's game sometime in the near future, Draco kept it close.
He measured out the coffee, finding comfort in the ritual. Harry leaned against the counter, toying with a magnet shaped like a Snitch he had taken off the refrigerator, while he waited for his coffee to brew. The thought of Sly having a beloved childhood pet made him even more attractive, though Harry couldn't work out why. He guessed it was because it made him sound so normal – Harry's first pet had been Hedwig, and Merlin knew there had been no normalcy in
"First time," Draco murmured, sucking hard against Harry's neck while he thrust his hips into him roughly, eliciting a long moan from the dark-haired wizard. "Second time," he continued, punctuating his words with another hard thrust. "Third time," he gasped, panting as he thrust again, the resultant friction almost too much to bear.
"Harry's not well," she said, pushing him lightly away from the table. She blocked Zach's approach with her own body, angling toward him so Harry could get away. "The flu, we think. He was just leaving to see if he could track down a potion for his headache."
"It's not as bad as all that, surely," a disembodied voice called out, startling Draco from his reverie.
“Merlin, yes,” he moaned, bucking up into her palm as she stroked him through the wool. He lifted a hand to delve under her skirt, delighted to find there wasn’t anything between the tight leather and her skin. “Best study session ever.”
Draco sat back against the plush velvet, watching the scene before him with detached amusement. It wasn't that he couldn't appreciate the beauty of the naked, writhing women on the stage, it was just that they held no real attraction for him. Large breasts and long, shapely legs had never really appealed to him, though his former wife Patrizia had possessed both.
"Dashing, Mr. Potter," the older witch said finally, nodding her approval. He glanced back to catch his reflection in the mirror, shrugging lightly. He looked like himself, in a tux. Nothing extraordinary.
Harry eased his way out from Draco's grasp, wincing as his muscles protested when he stood. They'd been a bit over-enthusiastic in some of their positions the night before, and he was suffering for it today. He grinned as he thought back to some of the more promising ones they'd tried, making a mental note to use them again – soon.
"Just take that off – carefully!" she chided when he hurried to remove the jacket. "Mind the pins. The finished tuxedos will be ready for you to pick up next week."
Draco's lips twitched again, his eyes losing focus slightly as he remembered his mind-blowing wank with Gryffin the night before.
Harry nodded, carefully placing the now-wrapped box on top of the mantle. He'd asked Neville to come pick up the gift, since he didn't want to send it by owl. He grinned, wondering if he'd finally get a chance to see Nev's house after he started dating Draco. The whole area was under some sort of protection charm and Harry had never been able to visit Nev and Daph because of it.
Draco felt panic ripple through him. Had the trick Ron and Blaise pulled with the Aurors not worked after all? Had someone come after Cal?
"I've already spoken with Neville," Draco said stiffly, hoping to avoid a drawn-out row with Blaise. He'd come to France for some quiet, after all, not to continue to rehash this ridiculousness.
"It sounds like you're falling for him, Harry," she said carefully. "We're just worried that you're going to get hurt. This is hardly conventional, you know. You're becoming attached to someone you've never even met."
He'd been working steadily since she left, but Harry still cringed when he heard Hermione's footsteps approaching. He'd managed about a dozen more charms, which meant there were still many to go. They'd set up their operation in the back room of the joke shop, since George had a few spare counters they could use to prepare and store the plants until the wedding on Saturday.
"What should we do with him?" Blaise asked, inclining his head toward Ron, who had also drifted off.
Blaise nodded again, his mind racing. He needed to get to France. Cal needed to be secreted away at least until they knew what was happening. If Cartwell was working with someone else in the Ministry, they would have access to Draco's property holdings. They'd be able to find the chateau.
Kingsley nodded, wondering what was going on. Knowing Harry, the man was doing his best to convince Draco
She pinned and measured for several more minutes, humming to herself to fill the silence. Harry just watched Ron, the two of them carrying on a silent conversation through their expressions. Ron knew exactly how Harry felt – he'd been standing on that stool only twenty minutes earlier.
"Took one," Blaise said, squeezing his eyes shut and sitting up, rubbing his hands briskly over his face.
he thought, his eyes scanning the screen as he looked for any sign of Sly. It was several minutes past 9 p.m. – maybe he'd gotten delayed.
, he thought fondly, grabbing her and kissing her exuberantly on the cheek when she'd finished her spell.
," Draco spat, his eyes flashing. "You shouldn't have had this pushed on you. Children, all three of you!"
"Every boy deserves a puppy," Harry had said with a simple shrug, placing the squirming ball of fur in Cal's arms.
"Harry James Potter, Head of the House of Potter and Head of the House of Black, your magic has accepted that of your chosen partner. Do you accept the awesome burden of your newly forged bond?"
"I'm perfectly fine," Draco snapped, slightly irritable from the last round of invasive poking and prodding the Healers had subjected him to before releasing him earlier.
“Hermione left her robes,” she said, grabbing the black material and stuffing it into her bag as well. Hermione had probably given up studying and headed down to the party herself, and she could give them to her when she saw her.  “I’ll just take them to her, shall I?”
He could hear Draco's laugh echo down the corridor as he fumbled for his wand, shutting and locking the door. He threw back the duvet, fisting himself roughly until he felt Draco's rising arousal through the bond. He held on until his husband was close, too, letting himself go so they could come together. As mad as he was at Draco, he didn't want to deny himself the closeness and satisfaction that followed when they came together. He'd start on Draco's punishment later.
He'd managed to avoid Malfoy so far, but he knew his luck wouldn't hold out much longer. Dinner was about to be served, and Harry would have to take his seat at their table soon. He took another swallow of the wine, making sure to smile broadly when he saw Hermione trying to catch his attention from across the room.
"He's been practicing on the house elves," Draco said with a laugh, sliding a pan of roasted shallots and mushrooms out of the oven and resting it on the counter. He turned, stirring the garlic cream sauce bubbling away on the range. "He's determined to be the best cousin he can be."
"Those aren't your only options, you know. For having children, I mean," she said, slightly uncomfortable.
Neville threw down the paper in disgust, pushing his unfinished breakfast aside. Harry had steadfastly been refusing to comment on the Smith situation, which had only fueled the rumor mill more. Today's article featured quotes from the slimy bastard about things Neville wasn't even sure was physically
"Caleum Alexander Malfoy, you have petitioned the Ministry to allow Harry James Potter-Black to adopt you. Is this your wish?"
"No," he said, exhausted from nearly a week spent as the go-between in the middle of the great Malfoy-Potter feud.
Draco was counting on some sort of violent reaction to the news, something to break the compulsion to continue answering. There was only one name left. Draco Malfoy didn't love many people, something he'd never lamented until now.
She softened visibly at his gesture, the tight lines around her grim mouth disappearing as she smiled girlishly at him.
Harry tensed, his struggles stopping. Blaise was right. The old traditions had to be followed to the letter, or he could no longer hide behind the ancient law to shield them from the press. And after what Ron had just told him, they were going to need it more than ever.
"Speaking of another dirty Slytherin bastard," Ron began, stopping immediately when he noticed his sister's narrowed eyes.
"How's your replacement doing?" Harry asked warily. Ginny had not been pleased when McGonagall and Pomfrey had banned her from flying just two months into her pregnancy, something rather integral to the job of flying instructor. She had taken over for Madam Hooch several years ago after retiring from the Holyhead Harpies.
Draco smirked, and Harry fell back against the pillows, realizing he wasn't going to come back. He could feel the smug satisfaction, tempered with arousal, flowing through their bond.
," he muttered. "It was nothing. A minor disagreement. Now that the boys know my opinion on their little farce, I'm sure they'll talk to Draco about it before they do anything irreversible."
"No, thank you," Kingsley said, crossing his legs as he settled into the comfortable sofa. He'd arrived a little early, thinking the two young men would be anxious to sign the contract and get started on the next phase of their lives. Harry hadn't told anyone Kingsley would be the one to administer the contract, but no one had been terribly surprised when he'd turned up. It would ensure the privacy Harry and Draco needed, since they knew they could count on Kingsley to keep a secret.
Harry woke to a tapping on his window. It wasn't even light out yet, and he fumbled for his glasses, casting a quick Tempus before letting the owl in. Just after 3 a.m.
He was prepared to see a physical manifestation of the bond after what happened at the promissory bonding, but Kingsley was still awed to see their auras swirl around them. The silver of the
"Mr. Potter, if you would please exchange rings with Mr. Malfoy," Kingsley said, his snicker barely hidden. He had obviously overheard Hermione's comment as well. "Please repeat after me: I give you a symbol of my love, devotion and fidelity."
The tired editors and publicists glowed at the praise, some of them breaking into spontaneous applause. This was another reason he was allowed into their inner sanctum, a place most authors were refused entry – his charm and modesty. They all truly loved working with Harry, who rarely missed deadlines or threw fits over edits or publicity schedules. James Evans was a hard worker, a talented writer and an all-around nice man.
"You need sleep," she said shortly, rolling her eyes when his hands flew to his face again, checking to make sure the glamour had held.
It hadn't felt like walking away to Harry, though. It had felt like walking into a new beginning, one where he could do whatever he wanted and be judged on the merit of his work instead of the scar on his forehead. And so James Evans was born, along with a crack team of fictional Aurors who solved wickedly complicated crimes in 300 pages or less.
Draco stroked himself, shuddering as his warm hand closed around his hard cock. His breath hitched when he saw Gryffin's words appear.
Harry's face lit up in a big smile. He loved his friends, especially when they looked out for him like this.
He gave her a winning smile, handing over a bag full of Galleons and grabbing the box from the counter. She was still staring at him, but he was too happy to care. He'd spent days agonizing over the perfect present, and he was so relieved to have hit upon something he was proud to give Harry.
Just like he'd watched him all those years ago in the alcove at Hogwarts. Fresh embarrassment flooded over Harry, and his cheeks heated even more.
Hermione clamped a hand over Harry's knee, which had apparently been bouncing madly as he once again ran through the list of reasons why Sly might be avoiding him.
Draco inclined his head, letting the subject drop. He fully intended to find out the particulars of Harry's duel with Cartwell, but it was clear Harry didn't want to pursue it tonight.
: A lot of reviewers have asked about Cal's identity. You'll find out more about him in the next chapter.
"Before we start, I just want to thank everyone for coming to bear witness for us," Harry said, smirking when he saw knowing smiles appear on everyone but Hermione's faces. "It means a lot to me – and to Draco as well, I'm sure – to know we have friends who care about us as deeply as all of you do."
may have, but Patrizia didn't feel the same way," Draco said with a grimace. "The life-in-exile bit got old for Patzie pretty quickly. She hated being cloistered in the chateau, which is where I insisted Cal be raised. She hated living with mother. She hated that I refused to go out at all anymore, other than to work and a few absolutely necessary social functions."
"I won't finalize the contract until you do," Harry said, his tone laced with warning. Until the marriage contract was signed, there would be no sex. And Harry didn't want to have sex with Draco before the blond knew everything there was to know about Harry's involvement in the war.
He hurried down the hall to his office, almost afraid to check his email. He expected a few angry missives – surely Gryffin wasn't so patient that he'd let a five-day absence go unchecked, especially since Draco had promised he'd only be out of contact for a few days at most.
was the witch Gryffin had alluded to, but she had assured him her labor had been quick and easy when he'd asked. Nothing like the ordeal Gryffin had relayed.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. Not mine. My most heartfelt thanks to Kamerreon for keeping me focused and on-track (as well as grammatically correct!).
"We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of Draco Potter-Black and Harry Potter-Black," Kingsley said, winking at the two men in front of him. "Unfortunately, these gentlemen were in such a rush to be married that we couldn't invite everyone to the original ceremony."
"Both of us?" Harry asked, his attention back on the manuscript. They'd been working on details for their upcoming wedding ceremony for more than a month, and Harry felt fairly useless in every area but the food.
"'Mione?" he croaked, blinking as he searched the table for his glasses, not realizing they were still on his face. He swallowed, grimacing at the taste in his mouth, and rubbed his eyes, the action pushing his glasses aside. He took them off, regarding them with surprise before replacing them and clearing his throat. "Hermione."
Pansy's frown grew as she turned to watch them, wondering how she'd possibly missed them on her way in. Of course, the box she was carrying was terribly heavy, so her attention had been focused on not dropping it, not on her surroundings, but still.
Harry thought, releasing the clasp on his cock ring. The odd sensation of his own hand on his cock was immediately noticeable, its slightly rough skin so much different from the softer, firmer grasp Sly had used. He barely had to stroke himself at all before he was coming, black spots bursting behind his eyes as he convulsed with the force of his release.
"Do you think I don't know that?" He asked, bracing a hand against the mantle as he spoke. "I think I've been half in love with him for years, I just didn't realize it."
Harry belatedly realized Pansy was still in the doorway, and he gestured for her to come in as he began to explore the contents of the basket. The food had Warming and Preservation charms on it, which meant it would taste as fresh as it had been when Sly prepared it earlier that day. Harry smiled.
Draco examined the object, grinning when he saw a shrunken bottle of Ogden's. Harry must have remembered it was what he preferred to drink before nerve-wracking meetings. Tomorrow's date with Harry would definitely count.
The silvery liquid shimmered and rippled, a soft sparkling mist rising up out of the basin. Draco knew what he saw when he dove into the memories would likely terrify him. He was positive though, that whatever it was, whatever these dark secrets Harry had chosen to share with him, and not the rest of the world, it wouldn't change the way he felt about Harry.
Harry released a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. He gave Hermione a lopsided grin, his cheeks pinking slightly in embarrassment.
Hermione looked up, the frown she'd been wearing while reading easing. She stood and put her arm around Harry's strong shoulders, leaning in to him.
"Your daddy has lots of people who love him," Blaise said, pausing his tickles so he was sure Cal could hear him. "And he's definitely one of the smartest wizards I know, and I know a lot of wizards."
He looked up as Ron ducked through the door, looking dashing in the black dress robes Harry had chosen for him. Both Ron and Blaise would be standing up for them at the ceremony, but they'd chosen not to have any other attendants. Draco had figured Harry would want a huge wedding party to accommodate all of his friends, but the other man had surprised him yet again, deciding instead to have only Ron and Blaise.
Ron paused, turning to face Harry. He'd been studying photos of Caleum on the mantle, fascinated by the way Malfoy's face completely transformed when he was around his son. He looked – happy. Relaxed. Natural.
Draco took another sip of wine, savoring the way it rolled over his tongue as he swallowed. His laptop was open in front of him, waiting for him to log in to the Magical Dating Online site. He glanced at his watch – a few minutes after 9 p.m., which would be a few minutes after 8 p.m. in London. His balls tingled as he envisioned Gryffin waiting, trussed up in a similar cock ring to the one he was currently wearing, worrying if he would show up.
Harry grinned at the boy, his heart melting even more when the boy offered him a tentative smile. He nodded once to Blaise, letting him know he'd understood his earlier words. Whatever it took, he would make sure Cal was safe from whatever was out there.
, he mused, scooting forward to open the box. He looked up at Draco, his confusion evident when he pulled one of the bottles out of the box. It was an Australian Shiraz, his favorite label out of Coonawarra. Ten bottles of it, it looked like.
Draco cut him off before Harry could say something that would make him crumble – like 'I'd really like to be friends'. The thought of exchanging friendly emails with the man he was in love with but couldn't have was too much.
Draco laughed aloud when Harry's latest gift arrived, utterly delighted. It was the perfect companion to the gift he'd received yesterday.
I wanted to dash off a quick thank you for everyone who is reading, and especially those who are reviewing. The response to Must Love Quidditch has knocked my socks off! *blows kisses*
"Thanks for coming, Kings," Harry said, squeezing Kingsley's hand affectionately. He reached behind him, grabbing Draco and pulling him forward. He'd never known the blond to be shy, but it seemed like he was hesitant to address the Minister on his own. "This is my intended, Draco Malfoy. Draco, I'm pleased to introduce you to Kingsley Shacklebolt."
won't make me," Cal said, his tears finally brimming over. "She said I have to take care of you, because you're too stupid to let anyone else."
His best friend Harry was falling for Malfoy. And he couldn't do a thing to stop it, because they were so damn
Harry faltered, wondering if Draco was struggling with him being Gryffin as much as he'd struggled with Sly's identity. "I was just thinking about you. I'd really like to –"
The darkness of his hate for Voldemort. The guilty desire to give up his life, to stay in the comfort and quiet of the afterlife, instead of returning to the chaotic war that he knew still raged. The bone-numbing exhaustion, mental and physical, born of years of fighting that made it so appealing. The resentment he still felt at times for being forced to choose between saving the world and staying with those he'd loved and lost.
"Wasn't talking about me," he slurred, blinking sleepily as the Dreamless Sleep began to take effect.
"Good, good," Draco murmured absently, his attention drawn to his computer screen. He'd promised himself he wouldn't check his Magical Dating Online email before he'd cleared the inbox on his desk, but he was having trouble fighting the temptation.
"We're putting the cart before the horse," she said, all business, as she released Harry. "We have to make Harry's response witty and intelligent enough to keep this guy interested. We can worry about Harry's reproductive future later. Say, after they've had their first date."
that had been Sunday's gift. It was the first gift Blaise actually exclaimed over, though the cost or rarity of the book hardly meant anything to Draco. He didn't dare actually read it, lest he disturb the Preservation Spell someone – likely Harry, since the book had come from a Muggle auction house – had placed on the book. He ran a finger over the cover, tracing the title and author's name. Ellis Bell. It had been the perfect gift, really. Not only did it mean Harry remembered his sympathy for Heathcliff, but the inscription inside had melted the last of his resolve.
"Yes, that's true," he answered, his eyes sparkling as he looked at the woman currently carrying Draco's child.
"I give you a symbol of my love, devotion and fidelity," he murmured, the words loud enough to reach the entire room but spoken only to Harry. "
"Drink?" Draco asked, pushing the door to his study open. It seemed like the safest place to entertain Harry – no bed, and a sofa too small to encourage any horizontal activities.
Blaise saw Draco stiffen, and he knew the man wouldn't want Cal to see the emotions that were likely playing across his face. He charged forward, swooping in and lifting Cal into his arms before the boy could protest.
Ron nodded and Hermione stood to pull Harry into a light embrace. He bent to rest his head on her shoulder and she pressed a kiss into his rumpled hair.
"I'll take that as a yes," Hermione said, fighting a smile. She really did love seeing Harry so excited, even if it was tempered with concern that this entire online dating thing could blow up in his face rather badly. Her eyes narrowed as another thought occurred to her. "You
Kingsley nodded solemnly, waving his wand in an intricate pattern. Harry repeated the pattern, closing his eyes as he felt energy snake around him.
Harry's head fell back, his entire body convulsing with the force of his orgasm. He nearly bit through his lip before he realized it was alright to scream, letting himself shout loudly as his cock pulsed, shooting jets of come across the arm of the sofa. He shuddered as another wave of pleasure shook him, his muscles twitching with the strength of the unexpected aftershock.
"We've had some good talks. He's right for you, Draco, I just know it. He loves you, and you've fallen in love with him, too," Blaise said, his voice low.
"Harry said you'd be stubborn," Seamus said with a sigh, putting the potions on the bedside table and sitting on the bed. He dug through his pockets, retrieving a small notebook. "I wrote it down, so I'd be sure to get it right. He said: Tell Draco to take the damn potions and get some rest. Everything is taken care of, and Ron and I are house-sitting for him in case any unexpected visitors come by."
– had exchanged over reputable places to buy exotic spices in London. He'd ended up sending a bottle of aged balsamic vinegar to Sly –
He watched a witch twirl around a pole, doing things with it that should not have been anatomically feasible, his lips twitching with laughter as Blaise leaned forward, tucking a shiny Galleon into the scanty G-string she wore. The money disappeared at once – Draco wondered what kind of charm they'd used, curious about how they'd managed that piece of complicated magic – which was fortunate, since the skimpy fabric didn't look like it would have withstood the added weight of the gold coin for long.
"I'm corresponding with a bloke who was in Slytherin. We met through that site I told you about last time I visited," he said.
"This is a potion to ensure there is no permanent damage to the tissue you bit through when you nearly severed your tongue earlier," he said, his tone disapproving. "The other is a muscle relaxant, which will help you get comfortable while your magic stabilizes. I'm not sure how you did it, or if it was even a conscious thought, but your magic forced the potion out of your system. You must be a very powerful wizard, Malfoy, to have been able to do that."
Draco had made good on his promise to fuck Harry, and the dark-haired man had returned the favor a bit later during their shower. He fervently hoped their uncontrollable urges would calm soon, since he didn't know how much more he could take. He was edging toward thirty, and at the moment, he felt every one of his twenty-eight years.
Pansy paused, waiting to see if the vow would let her answer. "I don't really have a say in it," she said carefully, sighing in relief when no buzz of pain wracked her skull.
Harry grinned, an expression of total confidence settling over his features. He knew much of the world thought he had some sort of superhuman instincts or force guiding him, but he knew the truth. His hybrid Gryffindor and Slytherin qualities had served him well before, and he'd make them work to his advantage now. Harry Potter was a very determined man. When he wanted something, whether it was the end of Voldemort or Draco Malfoy's attention, he got it.
Draco closed his eyes, willing the tears away. He was no longer the Head of the Malfoy family, having renounced the name and put the title – along with the deed to Malfoy Manor and a significant amount of money that was set aside for only the heir to the family – safely in a vault for Cal, should the boy choose to take it up when he came of age. He was officially the Head of the House of Black now, Harry's wedding gift to him. He stalwartly summoned his Malfoy mask, even though he had no claim to that family any longer. He still had his pride, and he'd be damned if he was going to show this much emotion in front of dozens of people, even if they were their friends and family.
Hermione was enraptured, her attention completely drawn away from the mangled napkin in her lap. Neville took a sip of coffee, being much too tired lately for tea, and continued.
Harry stepped down off the stool, retreating behind the make-shift curtain to change out of the stiflingly hot tuxedo. He made a mental note to check with Molly to make sure they were blanketing the park where the ceremony would be with Cooling Charms. He didn't want Ron sweating his way through the bonding, after all.
"I told you I'd let you know if anything changed, Gin," he said, grabbing a cold bottle of Butterbeer from the kitchen and collapsing in his favorite chair.
Harry was covered in a sheen of sweat, his cock so hard he was nearly begging for release. He keened as he found just the right angle, bearing down on Draco as he fucked himself on the Slytherin's cock. He thought he was at the apex of pleasure when Draco's lips met his, and
Draco swallowed hard, worried he wouldn't be able to force the binding words out of his mouth. Harry squeezed his hand again, and he felt Cal's small hand slide into his as well.
Harry quirked his eyebrows thoughtfully, spinning to check on his frittata again. Draco licked his lips when Harry's bare arse was on display as he bent to see to it. He carefully lifted the finished egg dish out of the oven, resting it on the range so it could cool.
at Harry and he didn't really have anything to do with the situation. How must Draco feel? "Why, Harry?"
"Whatever you want, Cal. I'll have the house-elves make us some of your favorites, and we can go riding afterward. Alright?"
"Potter!" He bellowed, stalking toward the bedroom. He threw open the door, glaring at Harry, who was fastening the button on his denims.
"Wait, go back," Blaise said, his voice suddenly serious. He had shifted his chair over so he could watch the screen as Draco scrolled through the entries.
Harry almost groaned, the only thing preventing the sound from escaping his lips being the total lack of oxygen in his lungs. He'd forgotten to breathe again.
The same silver runes appeared on Harry, and Draco touched the tip of his wand, also glowing silver, to the parchment. His vows appeared there as well.
"If he sent that Patronus to someone else in the Ministry, then yes," Ron said, his frustration clear. He hated waiting around for Cartwell to make a move, but he knew this was their best shot. "Malfoy would have had this place registered, even if it was under a higher security clearance."
"I was just leaving," Harry said, trying to push past the wizard as politely as possible. Malfoy and Pansy were gone, but he'd seen the door they'd left through. If he could get away, he might be able to catch them.
She looked around, laughing when she saw Neville and Daphne disappear into the green flames. Pansy and Oliver were already halfway to the Floo. It was obvious that everyone had felt the same pulse of sexual energy when Harry and Draco had signed the contract. The irresistible pull the two men felt afterward seemed to be contagious.
He saw the malicious glint in the other man's eyes, and he knew it was over. Draco had just unwillingly given him the opening he needed, and if he took it, Draco's life would change dramatically.
"The Wizards' Council – I'm sure you know that preceded the Ministry, yes?" Hermione nodded and Neville continued. "Well, the Wizards' Council intervened on behalf of the Ravenclaw Family's interests. The girl was imprisoned so they could no longer court, and arrangements were made to force Durward into a marriage with a more suitable match."
Harry had been writing his wildly popular Auror series for three years. He started after a bad injury in the field had shaken him up enough to quit the Auror division. Ron thought he was mental; they'd wanted nothing more than to be Aurors for years, and after only five years – two of those spent in training – Harry was walking away.
Draco frowned, turning the lightweight box over in his hands. He felt a pang of excitement as he studied the dimensions of the box – the very familiar dimensions. He'd had two strikingly similar boxes in his lifetime.
"Of course, that all depends on getting that zoning change approved," Blaise said, not even bothering to hide his grin, since Draco wasn't looking at him anymore.
"I don't think he'll be upset that you're James Evans, exactly," she said carefully, picking up their conversation seamlessly as she settled on the comfortable sofa. Harry followed her lead, perching in a chair and leaning forward. "But you should have told him immediately when he told you he liked the books so much. He'll be mortified, don't you think?"
"Just a few more procedural things about the Monday night meeting," Blaise said, his body tensed to flee as he forced his voice to remain calm. "Wedgewick has requested you attend naked. It's a formality, really. It will simply make it easier for you when you trade sexual favors for the votes you need."
"Not that I'm not thrilled to see you, because I am," he said carefully, squinting as he watched Draco's eyes shutter, all emotion gone, "but why are you here?"
"I'll be back down for him," Theo said, disappearing up the stairs. He raised his voice, and Draco assumed Potter's bedroom must be somewhere on the second floor. "He can sleep it off in the guest room."
Harry pushed back from his desk, wincing as he stretched. He'd been hunched over his laptop all afternoon, furiously writing to make the latest deadline for his next book. Hermione wasn't speaking to him – aside from extremely professional emails inquiring after his health and the status of the new chapters, which was arguably worse than a total cold shoulder – and he thought finishing these early might get him out of trouble.
"Well, that's a bit chintzy," Blaise drawled, wrinkling his nose. "A copy of a book he gets for free? One you've already read, even?"
He didn't respond, edging back enough to fumble with the fastenings on Harry's trousers instead. This was no time for romantic gestures, not when he was poised on the edge of razor-sharp desire. Harry gasped when Draco reached his prize, long fingers delving into the now-open trousers and curling around his erection.
Neville pulled a similar disc out of his own shirt, shrugging uncomfortably as he murmured the words and disappeared.
Harry stopped breathing, his mind racing. His hand was frozen, still touching Draco's, but he was powerless to move it.
"Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire," Draco said, his jaw clenching when the potion wasn't satisfied with his answer.
, Blaise thought, standing to go ask Madge for some tea. Draco was in a mood, which meant it was going to be a long day.
Harry nodded taking a sip of the Shiraz he'd poured himself earlier. Every time he drank it now he thought of Sly's assessment of the wine, calling it bold and spicy without being overly sweet. It was ironic, since that was how Harry would describe Draco. His favorite wine and his favorite man.
"A little warning next time?" he snapped, frowning at the brothers, both of whom were laughing at him.
Hermione bit her lip, her eyes wide as she followed the unfamiliar ceremony. She was bursting with questions – Why give them three years to break it off? What happened if they decided not to marry next week; would they still be bound and unable to marry another until the term expired? Why have a ceremony of intent at all? Was all this pomp and circumstance necessary? Couldn't they just skip to a wedding ceremony? – but kept them to herself, knowing she'd have plenty of time afterward to investigate the matter thoroughly. She looked around, noticing for the first time that everyone else in the room was entranced, their postures stiff as though braced for some sort of blow.
Draco's mouth was dry, and he licked his lips, swallowing to wet his throat. The first question had been too open-ended; he could get away with a vague answer. The others, those were specific and easily addressed. He relaxed slightly, keeping himself on his guard but knocking his panic down a notch. Maybe there was still hope.
"I don't want to know," he said, giving Draco a shrewd look before turning and walking out of the portrait.
He slid a finger under the cock ring, releasing the clasp. Instantly, the sensation of Gryffin's rough palm against his rock hard cock disappeared. Draco moaned, fisting himself, his hand flying as he quickly sent himself over the edge, Gryffin's name on his lips as he came for what seemed like an eternity.
"Why a Pensieve, though?" Draco asked, still stroking the soft stone. He could swear he felt it move under his hand, as though responding to his touch.
with my other clients, Harry. I've tried to coddle you lately, since I know you're excited about this mystery man and the anonymous relationship you two seem to be starting. But it can't interfere with your work – I won't let it. You have a deadline next week, and you still haven't finished the manuscript. I know you have three best-sellers under your belt, Harry, but Abigail won't wait."
"Madam Atalier," he greeted, standing to bow formally to the middle-aged woman before skirting his desk to press a kiss to her outstretched hand. She and her husband owned several large apothecaries around Great Britain, and Malfoy Industries had been advising them on real estate purchases and business investments for years. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"
He saw Ron wince in sympathy as yet another pin missed its mark, this one stabbing Harry in the ankle. He flinched, careful to keep his mouth shut this time.
"Everything go alright?" Harry asked, wondering what could possibly have taken Theo away from his wife's side after her complicated birth.
"Draco Potter-Black, so help me Merlin, if you ever desert me on another Weasley weekend we're finished, eternity bond or no," he muttered darkly as he Summoned his wand from his bedside table, stalking out into the hallway to set the children to rights. He'd use a Sticking Charm to keep them in their beds if he had to.
It had been a constant battle to keep his thoughts away from Harry, but a necessary exercise. He'd never wanked this often in his life, not even after his emails and chats with Gryffin had taken a decidedly sexual turn.
Cal leaned in a little closer, his eyes seeking out his godfather briefly before he continued. "You're Harry-Bloody-Potter, The-Blasted-Seeker-Who-Never-Loses."
Draco shivered, feeling cold and bereft as soon as Harry leaned back, instantly missing his closeness and heat. He looked at Cal, who was racing around the small pond, his hands out as though he were flying, laughing gleefully as his cloak billowed out behind him.
Draco blew out a breath, laughing. He let Harry lead him to the sofa, pulling a small vial of swirling silver mist out of his pocket. He shared a look with Harry, nodding resolutely before uncorking the vial and tipping it into the basin.
Draco shivered and Harry wrapped his arms around him, transporting them to the next memory. It was no less traumatic, but he figured a change of scenery might shock some sense back into the blond.
“Oh,” Hannah said, finally rounding the corner and finding Theo’s study carrel. She looked around, confused. “Harry said Hermione was here, too. Draco told me you were working on Transfiguration. I’d love to watch.”
Neville released him, joining Draco on his slow walk through the rows of grapevines. He understood why Draco would come here to think – he often wandered these same rows when something was bothering him. The two of them – with Blaise's occasional help – had nurtured the land, spending hours returning the ailing vineyard to its present state of health and fertility. Draco had struggled in those two years after Patrizia left him. He'd suddenly found himself questioning everything about his life – his sexuality, his place in society, his worth as a father, his decision to hide Cal away from the world. The winery had been his salvation, giving him an outlet to pour all of his anxious energy into.
Harry buried his nose in his daughter's tufts of blonde hair, inhaling the sweet scent of baby that was more intoxicating than anything he'd ever smelled before. He loved Cal, and that wouldn't diminish one bit with the arrival of their daughter. He met Draco's eye, seeing nothing but love reflected back. He'd worried, back when Luna had first approached him, that Draco and Cal would be upset if he chose to have a child. He'd been blown away by their response – both father and son had been enthusiastic from the start.
"I talked to the supplier Theo wants to use, and it sounds like we'll get a good deal on the furniture you approved for the club," Blaise continued, swallowing a laugh when Draco abruptly turned in his chair, now facing the dark computer screen.
He was still laughing as approached the fireplace, casting a wary glance up at the empty portrait before stepping into the Floo.
Draco nodded, sending Blaise a silent word of thanks for defusing the situation and cluing him in to who the woman was – no doubt the fuming witch in front of him would be even angrier had he blanked on her name.
"Stop hogging the newlyweds," Pansy complained, sidling up to them and kissing both men on the cheek. "May the blessings of Merlin be with you."
"I did, and you're lucky I'm not hexing you for Fire-calling him. Honestly, Blaise, I'm an adult. I don't need looking after."
Harry could feel the hot prick of tears, but he made no effort to stop them. Everything he'd ever wanted was right here in this room.
And suddenly he was coming in hot spurts, his arse clenching around the pleasurable intrusion of Draco's fingers …
Harry laughed softly, and Draco's eyes widened. It wasn't possible for their bond to transmit thoughts or images, though in that moment he could swear the Gryffindor was reading his mind. His emotions must have been crystal clear for Harry to pick up on his internal disappointment at losing the ability to use his Malfoy Mask with his husband.
"Aha!" He cried triumphantly when he read the words on the sheet. Hermione grimaced – she'd obviously lost. He handed her the small square of parchment. She groaned at the word that magically appeared, the moment he'd opened the envelope: Wrong.
Harry tapped his foot impatiently, glaring at the clock on his computer screen. Still thirty minutes until it was time to meet Sly. He groaned, stroking his erection through the rough fabric of his denims. He'd been half-hard all afternoon, ever since he'd gotten the charmed cock rings from George. Harry grinned, releasing himself with a sigh.
Ron coughed, looking away again. He seemed more comfortable with his gaze locked on the door instead of on the man in the hospital bed.
"Just a minute," Harry responded, doing the same deep-breathing exercises he could hear his bond mate going through.
"I take everything back I said about this internet dating thing, Harry," Ron said, sighing in delight after finishing his second piece of Pavlova, a large meringue shell that had been filled with fresh raspberries soaked in Framboise.
That had been an hour ago, and Harry was still no closer to finishing the chapters Hermione had demanded before making a dramatic Floo exit. He sighed, rubbing his face with his hands. His band of streetwise and hardened Aurors were stuck in a warehouse in Kent that had been struck by Fiendfyre; they had to find their way out without using magic, which would trip the wards left by the evil wizards they were chasing. The characters had been on the brink of death for weeks; Harry had tried writing the last three chapters of the book over and over again, but nothing worked.
Blaise heard a heavy sigh and an ominous silence. Against his better judgment, he propelled himself forward, walking through the open door into Draco's study without so much as a cursory knock.
"It's not. It used to be a way to solidify a wizard's intention to court, but now it's a way to prove your esteem before the actual dating begins. No marriage contracts these days, not even arranged marriages, are forced."
was at his wit's end with the wanker. He had the benefit of knowing that the blond pulled himself behind this mask of distain and aloofness when he was truly hurting, but Potter didn't know that. It had been so obvious that Potter had been excited to see Draco, but the prat hadn't been able to see past what he had considered an affirmation of the
"I'm fine. You didn't need to come home," he chided, pausing to study Freddie's increasingly agitated movements and noises. He'd only been half kidding earlier; she really did seem to need to eat all the time.
"I suppose not just any words though," he continued, his lips quirking. "Tell me, was it just the sound of his voice, or do you have some perverted kink for potions ingredients?"
Draco didn't notice when everyone left, but Harry felt the tug of the wards announcing their departure. Without relinquishing his spot in Draco's tight embrace, or un-molding his lips from the blond's, Harry pointed his wand at the fireplace, warding it against any interruptions with a nonverbal spell.
"It's not like that, Potter," he said, his voice pitched low so it didn't carry as they walked out of the room.
was the law he proposed. It's a formal Wizard's Oath to pursue a courtship. It literally means pursuit with determination and resolve, or something like that."
"Er, hi?" Draco answered, dusting the hearth with his hand before kneeling. "Did you need something?"
Neville paused, trying to read Draco's mood. He didn't know if he should apologize for keeping the secret or ask how the blond was coping with the news. Draco's carefully neutral expression didn't help.
"You're not," Draco said sharply, sitting his lunch aside to examine Blaise more closely. He pushed the man's feet off the low coffee table, crouching next to him to place a cool hand against his feverish forehead.
Harry gave Neville a bleak smile before joining Draco in the Pensieve. It hadn't been his intent to view them alongside the other wizard when he'd extracted them, but he could see now it was the best way. He'd be able to answer Draco's questions along the way, and offer support to help him get through the worst of it.
Ron nodded, releasing her reluctantly as the song ended and Fleur materialized, ready to take Ginny's place.
"That's good news," Draco muttered, booting the machine and anxiously tapping his foot as he waited for the monitor to spring to life.
"A bit rocky, just now, but I think everything is back on track," he said absently, a fond smile on his face as he studied the bottle. "He told me who he was last night, and I didn't react well, I'm afraid."
"George," Harry said absently, typing furiously as he finished his thought. He had a deadline at the end of the week, and he was struggling to meet it.
"Yeah," he answered, sliding off the stool and pressing a kiss to Hermione's cheek as Tom led them to a booth in the back. After all, the sooner they finished their meal, the sooner he could check his email.
Harry sent another glare at the reporters when they began shouting out questions again, waiting until they had stopped before continuing. He murmured something in Hermione's ear, and she disappeared inside the house, returning with Draco and Carina.
He grinned when his eyes lighted on Draco, who was standing in the doorway of the kitchen clad in black silk pajamas. His hair was still damp from his shower, framing his face in messy blond tendrils that Harry was quite sure were not usually allowed to air dry.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. If you haven't figured out yet that I'm not JKR, well, you haven't been reading closely enough! Thanks again to Kamerreon for her fabulous beta skills!
Harry nodded encouragingly, squeezing Draco's hands. He hated that Draco had been married before, but how could he resent something that resulted in Cal? The boy was fast becoming like a son to him.
"Two sugars and a splash of milk?" she said dryly, her smile growing as she looked at Blaise's mock-innocent face.
The post wasn't signed, nor did it have contact information appended aside from an identification number. Draco knew what that meant, since his own post was similarly devoid of personal information. Pansy only allowed high-profile clients to be anonymous on the site, and only after she had verified the person's identity and need for secrecy herself. After the verification process, the client was randomly assigned a number and a generic e-mail address. Even if Draco wanted to, he wouldn't be able to wrest the mystery man's identity from Pansy; she swore an Unbreakable Vow with each of these special clients, ensuring their privacy.
Green eyes studied Neville wordlessly as Harry waited for Draco's reaction. He hadn't included a note of any kind, assuming anything he could say wouldn't have been enough to answer the myriad of questions he was sure Draco would have as soon as he recovered from the shock of seeing his old wand.
"Can I bring you anything, sweetie?" a waitress drawled, giving Draco what she no doubt considered her best come-hither look.
"Everything is fine," Neville assured him, chuckling at Draco's flustered reaction. It was great to see the blond's usually unflappable control disrupted – well worth the effort it had taken to cast Shielding Spells around the trees and plants. "Same spell we use on the vines when there's an unexpected frost."
Harry laughed, grabbing his wand and casting a Warming Charm over their breakfast. It could wait, but Draco obviously couldn't.
He broke away, covering the ground between them and the ornately carved doors to the ballroom in a few powerful strides. He bypassed his own table, heading straight for Ron and Hermione, who had just cut the cake and were now stepping onto the dance floor.
done something with someone? He wrinkled his nose, disgusted with his inability to admit – even to himself – that realistically, it wouldn't have been just
"They wanted to be frogs!" Victoire whined from the stairs. She was sitting on the top step, her silvery blonde hair brushing the ground.
Pushing thoughts of his father out of his mind, Draco ran a finger over the nondescript box, unsure of whether or not he wanted to open it. Neville watched silently, unsure of what would evoke this reaction. Normally clear grey eyes were clouded with doubt and regret, and the man had gone as still as a statue.
The flames turned a bright green, and Harry stepped out of the fireplace. He was holding a small magenta bag – Draco's mind vaguely registered it was probably from that joke shop one of the Weasleys had opened, he'd heard Harry was a partner – and wearing an expression of contrite apology.
They were silent for a few more beats, until Harry gave a choked laugh, his eyes wide with panic and distress.
He shook his head, grimacing when the movement caused pain to spike through his temples. He was resolute in not allowing himself the potion, but a strong jolt of caffeine might have the same results.
Draco's heart stuttered, and he could hear the roar of his blood pumping through his veins. It was the only way he knew he was still alive. Because surely –
Draco frowned, studying the program an usher had given him on the way in. He'd expected Hermione would have insisted on writing their own vows, but it didn't look like they had. It seemed to be a pretty straight-forward ceremony, not many frills. He glanced at his watch, looking back at the door again. Pansy and Oliver had just come in, and he motioned them over. He doubted they'd be sitting together at the reception, but at least he didn't have to be alone for now.
“She took my robes,” Hermione said with a frown. How was she going to get back to Gryffindor Tower without her robes?
He stood, pushing his chair back and making his way into the kitchen to brew some coffee. He loved tea, but situations like this one called for coffee, he thought. He was two days out from his final deadline, and he had no clear plan of attack. He couldn't focus. His mind slipped back to Sly's latest email, and Harry laughed as he pictured a pre-teen Sly with a loyal Crup tagging along behind him. He had no way of knowing what Sly looked like now, let alone then, but his imagination was rich.
He finished his tea, finally caving to his curiosity and calmly unwrapping the gift. It looked like a book, and he figured Harry had probably given him a signed copy of the James Evans novel that had just been released.
Harry's grin nearly split his face as he saw his friend's tactical error. Before he could warn him, a sharp Stinging hex hit Ron squarely on the arse.
Blaise rapped on the open door sharply, ostensibly announcing their presence. Draco knew it was a show for the woman he was leading in – Blaise was well aware of the Amplifying charms Madge had placed on the corridor so no one could sneak up on her boss.
Draco shook his head, becoming more resigned. It was a direct contrast to the anger Blaise had expected.
Ron smiled, nodding. The words did nothing to assuage his fears about Harry and Malfoy, but they did remind him why they were there. He had no reservations about marrying Hermione. He'd sprint down the aisle to her if he could.
"A simple ceremony with Kingsley, then," Draco said, his voice rough. "We can re-take our vows in front of all our friends and family at a later time."
The press had backed off Harry, as per his orders, but they were still camping out on her doorstep daily and printing stories about how her marriage was in trouble. She and Oliver were handling it as best they could, but it still infuriated her every time she opened the
"Fuck off, Zach," Ron hissed, making sure his colleague could see the tip of his wand, which was trained on him under the cover of the tablecloth. Hexing a fellow Auror would cause a headache at the Ministry, but it would be worth it. "Get out of here."
"Some of us are capable of doing more than one thing at once," she chided, turning the page of the contract. "I'm paying attention, but I'm not sure
Harry stumbled through the Floo, almost losing his grip on the bulky box in his hands. George had provided them with numerous pranks and gags to help get them through tomorrow's stag party, and Harry had volunteered to take charge of them. He figured it gave him the chance to sort through the box and remove anything that would truly embarrass – or, knowing George, maim or injure – Ron. Charlie hadn't entirely been joking about Hermione's fear that the party would get out of hand.
Ginny smiled and nodded, her eyes traveling to the door when it opened. Harry could literally see her joy when Theo entered, cradling a tiny dark-haired baby in his arms.
The fact that he had no desire to fill the position for more than a term or two was what had made Oliver Wood an excellent choice as Ginny's replacement. He was on a forced medical sabbatical from Puddlemere United due to a wrist injury he'd gotten earlier in the season. It didn't prevent him from flying, but it would never heal properly if he had continued to play Keeper with the injury. He was spending his recuperation time helping out.
"Well, I think it was nice of him to offer to help," Hermione said, twirling a bite of pasta on her fork. "And we finished much faster than we would have without him."
"However did you avoid Ravenclaw with awesome powers of deduction like yours?" She snapped, grabbing Draco's sandwich from the desk and taking a bite. She was missing lunch to run this errand for Harry.
The flames roared to life, and Draco stepped back, leaving room for his guests to climb through. He sighed when he saw a familiar face appear.
"Don't. I know this has something to do with him. Every distraction or problem you've had over the last two months can be traced back to him," she said, her voice softening. "I know you think you know what you're doing, but you really need to meet him in person. Soon. Or at least find out who he is. You're in this too deep."
The bride always looked flushed with excitement, but you could tell a lot about how successful the marriage would be by watching the groom. Some didn't watch their wife-to-be walk down the aisle. Others watched, but didn't stare. Weasley, though, watched his bride progress down the aisle like a starving man looking at the only food for miles.
"We'll try a bottle now, and then let the rest of them sit in the wine cellar," he continued, his smirk returning when Harry's eyes lit with understanding.
Draco felt Harry's hand twitch in his own, and he clamped down on his urge to mold himself around the other wizard on the spot. Every molecule of air between them felt like an insult; he wanted nothing more than to insinuate himself into Harry's very being, joining their bodies as their magic had just joined.
"Even though they're blaming us for bodging it up?" He wasn't really surprised at Draco's order – he wasn't the type of man to let his client get taken advantage of, even if it was by a family member. And that client was technically no longer a client.
"We had dinner a few weeks ago at that new place in Hogsmeade. His wife was a much more charming than I remember her being in school, but Merlin, can that woman eat! I assume it's mostly the pregnancy, but still. It was more than a little revolting to watch her eat ice cream topped with cockroach clusters and mustard," Draco said with a slight shudder.
Ron laughed, shaking his head. If Lavender was so excited about the party, surely he could coax her out of her bad mood with some dancing and alcohol?
Draco pursed his lips, but decided not to answer. Instead he unwrapped the bundle, revealing a bottle of red wine. He turned the bottle slowly in his hands.
Harry caught the bottle Ron tossed at him, testing its warmth against the back of his hand before scooping Freddie out of Hermione's arms and settling on the couch to feed her. He figured it was the safest place to be – they couldn't hex a man holding a baby, could they?
printed – part two of the story, which included photos from Smith's two-year relationship with Potter. Smith claimed they were on the verge of reuniting when Oliver caught Harry's eye.
"Alright, who's next?" He looked around, pointing at Luna. She grinned back at him, asking her question before Hermione had a chance to pretend to lift the Silencing Spell. She'd been exempted the first time around.
"Just Neville?" He asked, bracing for an angry outburst. They definitely still needed a chaperone – the little show with the sparks confirmed that – but he didn't want everyone to watch as Draco viewed some of the worst moments of his life.
"Ollie sent me everything from Quidditch tickets to his grandmother's heirloom necklace," she added, giggling when he kissed her again.
"I doubt Smith would appreciate hearing that," Draco said, his tone still cordial. He felt Blaise stiffen behind him, but ignored it. Draco looked over Harry's shoulder, watching the Auror's approach dispassionately. "I wouldn't want to cause any more trouble between the two of you."
The Auror laughed darkly, scanning the file again. There were dozens of photos of Malfoy and his love interests there, and none of them looked like he'd been trying particularly hard to hide. Was something different about this one, then?
was late, and it was throwing off his entire day. He'd spent the week since his unfortunate run-in with Potter – because that was all it was, and it ended badly not because he was jealous, but because he hated the prat, he assured himself – settling into a comfortable routine. He'd read several newspapers with his breakfast tea before taking the Floo directly from the chateau to his office in London. He'd taken to turning down all evening and early morning invitations and appointments, both business and pleasure, so he could spend more time in France.
Draco rolled his eyes, grinning when Madge entered the room. She tutted over Blaise for a few moments, casting the same spells Draco had, and coming to the same conclusion.
"He's out in the vineyards with Nev," Blaise said. "Call tonight before bedtime? I'll make sure he's here."
"Been waylaid by Theo, have you?" she asked with a grin. She was absolutely glowing. "I can't get him to come away from the nursery. I'm surprised the mediwitches haven't kicked him out!"
"I'll use magical restraints if I have to, Malfoy," the man whispered in his ear, and Draco's head snapped up, the familiarity of the voice breaking through his terror.
for each other. Malfoy was a git, but he if really was Sly, then there was no denying he and Harry would be great together.
Draco winked at Neville. "We should also thank you for standing by us through this courtship. It couldn't have been easy for you, especially these last few days."
“N.E.W.T.s aren’t for months,” Draco said, shrugging easily. “One night of fun won’t hurt you. It may even do you some good. Studies show that –”
Kingsley placed a hand on both men, careful to gauge their reactions. This far into the marriage ceremony, it shouldn't cause a problem, but few things ever went according to plan when Harry was involved. He nearly sighed in relief when both Harry and Draco nodded slightly, looking up to meet his eye.
They made it up to the bedroom eventually, partaking in the scented bath Harry had drawn – perfect for sore muscles – and the soft sheets he had procured – deliciously soothing against sex-chafed skin. Harry stretched and yawned, resisting the urge to ruffle the blond hair on the pillow next to his.
Draco blinked as Harry became engulfed in a halo of riotous color, the silver of the bond snaking its way through blocks of deep purple and turquoise swirled with green, yellow and orange. The streaks of red were a surprise, but he couldn't help but smirk when he saw pulses of pure white as well, something he was sure would be conspicuously absent from his own aura, which was also rendered visible by the spell. He couldn't help but smirk at the mix of colors and the shocking streaks of white, irrefutable evidence that the Goody Two-Shoes Gryffindor was essentially pure and innocent at heart.
"It's just for a few minutes, then we can go have fun," Harry said with an easy smile. He'd been a lot easier to be around after Draco had accepted his courtship offer two days ago.
See disclaimer in Chapter 1. I don't say I own them; you don't sue. Thanks go to Kamerreon for her awesomeness!
Ron turned when Ginny joined them, narrowing his eyes at the meaningful glance she shared with Neville.
they wouldn't have done anything together. Harry dismissed his earlier worries, wondering if Hangover Potions had some sort of unknown hallucinogenic side effect. Really. Him and
Harry blew out a breath, stepping into the kitchen. He pulled out a bottle of his favorite Shiraz, decanting it to let it breathe. He figured the wait would be easier with something to drink. He'd felt bold and daring while penning the letter to Sly, but some of that Gryffindor braveness deserted him now. What if he didn't show up? Or worse, what if he showed up but thought Harry was some sort of perverted freak for suggesting the game?
"I suppose you're right, Hermione. I could send him a few naked pictures of myself in my next email; that would clear things right up," he said, testing his theory.
Harry nodded and withdrew his head from the fire as Hermione headed back to the kitchen to return the takeaway to its original containers. She shook her head with a good-natured grimace at the irony of it.
tradition," Draco whispered, the disdain clear in his muted voice. Harry opened his mouth to protest, the words dying on his lips when Draco bent and wrapped his lips around his cock.
Draco opened the box, holding his breath as he delved inside, batting away the layers of gauzy cloth wrapped around the heavy object. He was surprised at how small it was, expecting something two or three times its size given the weight of the box.
"Thank Blaise. It was his idea," he said, snorting. "Hair Thickening Potion? Leave it to a Slytherin."
"I expect a full report on how they work!" George called after him, blanching as he realized what he'd just said. "Er, scratch that. A report on
Harry looked puzzled, especially when Ginny's eyes widened at something she saw in her brother's face.
I have always done what was expected of me. I sacrificed myself for the greater good on more than one occasion and I have no regrets at having done so. I did what was expected of me, often at great personal loss.
"You've definitely got the makings of a Slytherin on your hands, Harry," Neville said, tickling the boy in Harry's arms.
Draco laughed humorlessly, and Blaise bit his tongue to refrain from pointing out that Cal's stubbornness was definitely an inherited trait.
"I'm sorry to drop in on you like this," Hermione said with an apologetic smile, "but I found something I thought you should look at straightaway."
"Leave it," Harry hissed, not taking his eyes off Cartwell. "See to the other one. Find out who he is, who else knows."
The bit in the kitchen is dedicated to Chi.Z.B. It's swapped from your request, sweets, but it made more sense this way, since it was Harry's kitchen. *grins*
She laughed, wagging her finger at him. "You're a still a boy to me, Teddy Lupin, and don't you forget it! Now get to bed, and I'll be there soon!"
Draco cut his eyes toward the door, and seconds later Madge knocked and entered, Levitating a tea service for two in front of her.
, she thought, biting her lip, already braced for the worst with the notoriously hot-tempered blond, who likely wouldn't be as reasonable as the Gryffindor.
Draco noticed Harry's free hand fist, and he smiled, knowing exactly what the other man was struggling with. It was going to be torture not to touch him, kiss him,
Theo cleared away the dishes, refusing Draco's assistance on the grounds that he'd cooked, so someone else should clean. He took the opportunity to question Gin, who had just returned from tucking Freddie into her cot. Cal was sprawled on the floor, coloring a picture of a very misshapen hippogriff.
Harry's smirk grew when he saw the outraged faces of many in the crowd. Luna, standing toward the middle of the pack, was the lone exception. She was smiling broadly, sending the occasional wink to her goddaughter.
