Ron shakes his head, unpeels himself from Hermione and slithers around the outskirts of the circle to wedge himself in between Harry and Dean.
The pressure is exquisite, the knife’s edge between pleasure and pain, and Draco can barely think, wants to move, forces himself to hold still. He keeps his hand wrapped around Harry’s cock and tightens his grip, starts to slide his hand back and forth.
Not to mention, he’s running after Malfoy.
Harry moans.
and watches the small, brown owl take wing, lifting a weight from his shoulders as she flies, disappearing into the distance.
“Harry,” Draco whispers, and his new truth, his new reality starts to take hold, and no matter how much he fights, how much he cries, it cannot be changed. He loves, he loves, he loves
“Did you…” Harry asks and Draco just shakes his head, and then Harry gives him a filthy grin. “Well? What are you waiting for?”
Malfoy’s wand!”
The paper lowers enough that Harry can see that one aristocratic eyebrow is arched in disdain. “Lovely? I think you’ve got delusions of grandeur.” The paper goes back up.
Harry frowns, brings to mind the face of a girl, pretty enough, he supposes, but not someone he’s ever given a second look to. He’s been too busy looking at Draco.
,” and Harry looks over to see Malfoy casting a shield, right in front of —
Harry’s cock is hard and flushed and damp at the tip. It’s long and thick and mouth-wateringly beautiful, if such a thing can be said about a prick, and Draco licks his lips as he stares at it.
“I wasn’t sure,” he says softly, and leans in to kiss Harry again. “I thought… but I wasn’t sure.”
The door closes with a soft click, and Harry is right back at it, only now he’s pressing into the heat of Draco’s body, not deep, just gentle, like a promise, even as he sucks hard, and Draco throws his head back and bites his lip as he comes. He comes hard, like he’s seventeen again, and he’s pretty sure he just came all over Harry’s Auror robes and possibly his face. It is, without a doubt, the hottest thing Draco’s ever experienced.
“You should come on my face,” Harry says, not looking at Draco, cheeks flushing red. “Just. You should really do that.”
The door closes but, Draco notes, as Harry leans in again, and urges Draco to lift his hips so Harry can slide down his trousers and briefs, the door isn’t closed all the way. And it’s absolutely not locked.
“What? What are you talking about?”
As if Hermione had not literally just said the same thing.
He had no idea it could feel like this, no idea this is what it was like.
Draco retaliates by leaning in and pressing a hot, open-mouthed kiss to the tender skin just behind Harry’s ear and Harry feels his cock jump in response. Thankfully, it’s their turn to step behind the wards, and ignoring the disapproval of the others behind them, Harry wraps both arms around Draco and lets him apparate them away.
“I think,” Draco says carefully into the dark, “You’ll have to stay with me.”
“Think I had a dodgy curry for lunch,” Draco grits out, jaw clenched, and Richardson pulls back.
He doesn’t even care that Hermione was holding her best friend while he bled out. He doesn’t care that she’s lost her heart’s center, same as he has. Draco knows, he’s so sure, that he’ll go to Harry, and Harry will be okay. He’ll be smirking that stupid fucking Gryffindor smirk that says he knows he’s played you, he’s gotten to you. Draco has loved Harry for close to twenty years, but he’ll be the first to admit, sometimes Harry can be an asshole.
Draco snorts. “No, Potter, I’m not dating anyone. I’m not waiting for reasons other than, the timing just hasn’t been right, and I haven’t really been that interested after. You know.” He glances away.
He reaches out, takes Draco’s hand, and nods. “Shower. Bed. Together.”
He’s dying to ask a million questions, like has Draco always known he liked boys, does he like girls too, does he like Harry specifically, is this something he wants, but he takes a breath and bites his tongue.
Harry leans back, delighted. “You’re such a fucking swot,” he says affectionately and Draco punches him lightly.
“You know,” Draco says thoughtfully, “Even though you can’t touch me, there’s no reason I can’t touch you, right?”
Draco grabs Hermione by the collar of her shirt.
Freedom.
“Fucking do it,” Harry hisses and Draco
Keely sets the plate down in front of him and Draco starts to eat. He’ll spend the morning working on the business of the extended estate. Reviewing the accounts, going over the investments, those sorts of things. The lawyers will arrive at 10:30 and stay until after the luncheon that Draco knows Keely’s been planning for weeks. After they leave, Draco will head to the sauna for the purification ritual. Draco actually loves this part, especially when Harry joins him in the sauna. Then he’ll walk the house, attic to cellar. After supper, once it’s dark, he’ll head out to walk the grounds. Magic requires that he trace the perimeter of the property, and spend time with the land. He knows the house elves have spent the last few weeks clearing the paths, and he’s thankful it hasn’t snowed much this winter. It’s going to be cold though.
Harry follows him, heart pounding in his chest. Malfoy sounds terrified, and Harry realises he doesn’t like that at all.
“You’d really want to?” Harry asks, his voice rough.
To everyone’s surprise, including Draco’s, somehow he and Potter have become, well, friendly. They’ve been paired up in classes, spent time together on the Quidditch pitch, and have somehow gotten in the habit of walking down to dinner together. There’s also been a lot of really intense eye contact, and Draco’s not quite sure what to make of that. If it were anyone else, he’d call it flirting. Not that he’s got a lot of first-hand experience, what with the war and all, but it seems like
It’s the first time Harry’s touched a cock that’s not his own, and he can’t believe how incredible it feels. He’s hard too, so hard it almost hurts, but hearing the way Draco moans and cries out is so, so satisfying.
“Not in my plans today, Potter. Sorry to disappoint. Who the fuck are these guys?”
Harry snickers and opens his eyes. “Maybe so, but it seems a long way from not liking me at all to crying in your gin about how lovely I am.”
“I do,” Malfoy says softly.
“So,” Harry says after a moment, “That happened.”
“But,” Harry tries again and sputters when Dracos shuts him up by sticking his tongue down his throat.
Malfoy gives a soft groan, the kind you make when you’re stretching, and Harry pictures the length of Malfoy’s body, and the way his skin would look against the dark velvet of his comforter. Malfoy gasps, and yeah, Harry can hear him. Harry can hear
“Fuck.” Harry kicks at a clump of dirt.
“Not to me,” Harry says quietly, watching as Malfoy approaches him. “It’s really not evident to me at all.”
Draco leans forward, rests his elbows on the desk, and gives silent thanks for the ostentatious, mahogany monstrosity his predecessor had apparently insisted on. Harry fits just fine underneath, and the privacy panel extends all the way to the authentic Persian carpet. As long as Harry is quiet, Richardson won’t know what’s happening here.
Harry glances around the room and realizes something. Sure, his friends are watching them with avid curiosity, but there’s no censure, no judgement that he can see. In fact, if he had to comment, Harry thinks, he’d have to say that the feel of the room is… encouraging. Blaise gives him a thumbs-up, and Ginny actually fucking applauds. Seamus is still shrieking, but that’s to be expected, Seamus does get worked up about things, and when Harry looks at them, Dean just grins and mouths, “Get it, Harry.”
“I just,” Draco makes grabby hands and tries to pull Harry back up by the shoulders.
The way they do, your found family, your home
“Well,” Malfoy says, “Could be worse.”
“Yes,” Draco hisses, “Fucking touch me, Harry,” and Harry shoves his hands down the front of Draco’s joggers.
“That was fucking fantastic,” Malfoy says. “Now I need a shower.”
. Things like those words.
Draco rolls his eyes and pulls Harry close.
Harry moves even closer, tucking his nose into Draco’s neck. Harry’s hand slides down because Harry Potter is a handsy fellow, and shamelessly takes any opportunity to put those hands all over Draco’s body.
And that’s a hell of a thing to feel at 24 years old.
Richardson sticks his head in. “Have you seen Potter, Malfoy? I thought I saw him come in.”
Harry’s not entirely sure he understands the rules of this game or where Luna even got this bottle. The bottle spins, and whoever it lands on, the bottle will ask a question, give a dare, or just simply order the victim to kiss someone. There’s no rhyme or reason Harry can understand, but it’s pretty funny. He sees Neville give Ron a quick kiss, laughs at Pavarati’s rendition of some muggle boyband’s big hit, watches as Hermione attempts a backbend, and ends up in a heap on the floor. Dean kisses Seamus. Pansy kisses Luna. Ginny snogs Nevile and it’s
, and Harry hears a yelp and a thump from somewhere off in the distance.
They stare at each other and Draco sees it, the moment Harry decides. His gaze turns hot as he gives Draco a blatant once-over and then his mouth quirks into the most beautiful smile Draco has ever seen, and this is it, right now, this is the moment that Draco realizes he’s in love with Harry Potter.
That’s certainly what everyone else does.
who is laughing at the story Harry is telling. He’s laughing so hard that Harry has to steer him away from a table full of posh mums and their even posher babies.
Malfoy shrugs. “Could be boils. Have you ever had boils on your arse, Potter? Or your prick?”
“Told you,” he gasps, his heart still racing as he tries to catch his breath. “Told you it wasn’t going to take long.”
“Oh.” Draco says and then, as if it’s finally sinking in, “
Draco gives another long suck, pushing his mouth down as far onto Harry’s cock as he can without gagging and Harry collapses back onto the lounge.
“You’re touching me,” Malfoy says, “Just the way I like it. Gentle on my face, then you move your hands down my chest, and you’re kissing my neck. You know how much I love that.”
They look at each other, and Harry shrugs. “We use the Seamus definition in Gryffindor for Never Have I Ever,” he says and Draco looks at him blankly. “Mutual intent to orgasm.”
Draco stares at him, and at first, doesn’t see anything that might obviously make Potter too dangerous to be around other people. His hair is the same, messy and falling in his face in a way that absolutely should not be endearing but is. His same round glasses are slipping down his nose. But then, as Draco scans his body, his eyes widen, and it’s clear what’s happened.
Draco grins, and it hits Harry, he’s beautiful like this, flushed and tousled, face so soft and open it takes Harry’s breath away. Draco sits up and yanks his shirt off over his head, tossing it to the side. Harry sees the faint lines of scars across his chest and reaches up to run his finger gently over them.
“I want you to suck me off,” Draco says plainly and Harry can’t help the shudder that rolls through him at Draco’s words. “Been thinking about this for so long, you on your knees, your mouth... Fuck’s sake, Harry. Your fucking mouth.”
“How?” Harry glares at him. “I don’t know about you, but I’m not all that keen to head into the Forbidden Forest at,” he glances at the clock over the mantle, “eleven o’clock at night.”
“Fuck’s sake, Harry, talk about gorgeous,” Draco says.
He’s not in it alone.
He hears the sigh. “Fine. Do, pray tell, convey to me what you think you’ve heard.”
“I look at you a lot,” Harry whispers, as if confessing something secret and hidden. “I always want to look at you.”
Harry takes his time, gets acquainted with Draco in this new way. He closes his eyes, sinking into the feel of Draco in his mouth, the smell of his body wash, the taste of his arousal, heady and rich in Harry’s mouth. He pushes down on Draco’s hip with one hand, the unspoken “stay still” clear, and he hears Draco give an honest-to-god whimper as he threads his fingers through Harry’s curls, and Harry starts to move.
“The Dare is this,” the Bottle says. “Draco Malfoy will go with Harry Potter to a place of their choosing, immediately, and Draco Malfoy will bring Harry Potter to orgasm at least once.”
Malfoy isn’t back yet, so Harry waits, uncomfortably aware that the game has clearly broken up, and everyone’s giving him a wide berth. Luna, Hermione and Pansy are huddled over the bottle, and Harry can smell the smoky scent of the diagnostic spells they’re casting.
It’s Richardson from down the hall, and Draco knows that he knows that Draco is in here. He might even have seen Harry come in.
Draco stares at him.
Draco spins Harry around and pushes him towards the bed, and he’s laughing as he says, “Yeah, I can do that.”
For a long moment, the only sound in the room is their gasping breaths, and then Harry speaks.
, Harry feels something rising in his chest, some overwhelming emotion he can’t put a name to, but it’s
“Please don’t freeze your bollocks off,” Harry says earnestly, letting go of Draco to push back from the table and stand. “I’m actually quite fond of them.”
“I’ll owl Kingsley Monday,” Harry says, heart pounding. “I’ll say no.”
Draco had leaned in to kiss him, gentle and slow. “You’re important too. I’ll wait.”
It’s open and wanting, his gaze fierce as he says, “But Harry. I am.
“Draco, we’ve got to… oh my god, yeah. Okay, that’s…
,” he shouts that last part down to the large black shadow that’s stomping around, still making angry noises. “And if we don’t climb down, we’re going to have six fucking days of cock boils.”
. Not about
, and Harry is stunned by the look on his face.
“I just don’t think. No one’s ever. Just said that.” Draco admits, his voice quiet. “To me. No one’s said it to me.”
Even though he’s pretty sure, Draco has to ask.
Draco stuffs his things and a bottle of water into his sisal market bag that Blaise claims to have gotten for him in Africa, but Draco is pretty sure he’d seen something just like in John Lewis. He reminds himself that he has a perfect right to hang out in the hedge maze, shoves his feet into his sandals, and walks out the door.
Harry is suddenly flush with rage. The nerve, the
. Fuck, I… Yeah, I want this with you. Can you just, please.
He climbs up next to Harry and sits, focusing first on relaxing his body. He breathes deeply, unclenches his jaw, and feels the slight lawyer-induced headache start to fade. He lifts his shoulders, lets them drop, once, and again. He rolls his head left, then right, and breathes in the steam and fragrance.
“Can you feel them?” Draco asks, fascinated. “How do you piss? I mean, it must make all sorts of things difficult.”
“You’ll live,” Harry pronounces. “You’re lucky though, another centimeter or so, and it might have hit the eye.”
Draco shifts, peers over the edge of the tree limb and looks back at Harry with wide eyes. “I think it fucking worked,” he whispers, and Harry leans over next to him.
, flushed and tousled, and Harry can see the smear of his release across his belly and chest. Holy shit, he must have come so hard, Harry thinks as Malfoy swipes a hand down his neck. Then Malfoy stretches, contentment and satisfaction clear in the line of his body.
He lifts his head and their eyes meet.
Harry sighs and takes the opportunity to shake off and pack himself back up, ignoring the way that his dick is getting interested in these proceedings.
Potter laughs outright at that. “Malfoy, you’re the least subtle person I know.”
The cut is relatively shallow, running from one side of Malfoy’s forehead down close to his eye, and as Harry wipes it clear, the bleeding is already slowing down.
So Harry shows him, again and again.
“Draco,” he whispers, “Fuck, I want to touch you, but…”
It’s never, ever felt like this. Harry feels like he’s been hit by lightning, like his skin is on fire. Like his spine has liquified and pure desire has replaced the blood in his veins. His knees are weak, and his hands are shaking as he reaches up to trace the line of Malfoy’s jaw.
Draco’s eyes are closed, and he’s holding on tight. “Yeah. Okay. Same to you, you bastard.”
Malfoy continues. “So unicorns are pretty mellow and gentle. Docile. They love virgins but don’t do anything to err, non-virgins. Just ignore them. They’re honestly pretty dumb. Gorgeous, but thick as bricks.”
Harry lands next to him, hovers anxiously and then grabs his wand. He quickly levitates the wreckage off of Malfoy’s leg, and casts a quick and dirty stasis charm. He pulls his sleeve down over his hand as he drops to his knees, and carefully wipes off the blood.
As Harry listens to the slick sound of an oiled hand moving over what he assumes is a now fully erect cock, Harry reaches down and rubs his own prick. Which is also erect, Harry realizes. He’s gotten hard listening to the sound of Malfoy getting himself off. Huh. That’s new.
“Pomfrey has bonsais?” Draco asks, momentarily baffled, and then “Wait, you’ve gotten a lot done in just a few days.”
The scortátus is still there, but it’s just standing quietly, and Harry can see the red gleam of its eyes as it looks back up at them. It’s glowing now, a faint gleam of silver around the dark bulk of its body, and Harry would swear it’s making eye contact with them. He sees the eyes dip as if it’s nodded its head to them, and then he hears it moving away, thrashing through the underbrush until finally, it’s gone and the forest is quiet around them.
Typical Saturday night, really.
It’s very awkward because there’s really not anywhere for Harry’s legs to go other than for him to sort of slide them under Malfoy’s, who looks at Harry as if he’s gone just the tiniest bit mad, and then slowly bends his legs to make room.
Malfoy holds the shield and Harry
Harry runs a hand through his hair as the Bottle continues to spark gently. “Harry Potter, do you forfeit the Truth?”
Like Malfoy, when the war was over, Harry had spent the summer rebuilding Hogwarts. He’d also spent those months going to funerals, consumed by grief for all they’d lost. He and Ginny hadn’t even tried to rekindle their earlier romance, both of them knowing that any comfort they might take in each other was resting solely on the fear of being alone, not on the joy of being together. Just one more casualty of the war, Harry thinks.
The walls of the maze are tall enough that it’s cool inside, but not so tall as to feel confining. Draco casts an anxious glance behind him. He really does not want to get lost, but there’s a mystery here and Draco really wants to solve it.
“This is not,” he says carefully, looking away from Malfoy, “my favorite place.”
Again, Malfoy mimics him, stretching out his long legs, resting his feet next to Harry’s. Malfoy’s wearing black socks with a firework design that keeps blooming in a shower of colors, over and over again. It’s mesmerizing, and every time he wiggles his toes, the pattern shifts.
“Do you want me to…” Harry starts and he’s not sure if he’s relieved or disappointed when Draco shakes his head.
He wraps his hand tightly around his cock and begins to move, gently at first, but it’s good, it’s so fucking good, the way Harry is spread out beneath him, arms wide as he stares avidly at the show Draco’s putting on.
The problem is, Harry doesn’t really want to get off with just
“I love these,” he says quietly and Harry shrugs.
Draco’s wand wandlessly. Thankfully, the scortátus hadn’t stepped on it, so Draco is able to use it first to
Harry mumbles something into the pillow that Draco can’t understand but makes him smile anyway.
“Harry,” he whispers, and his eyes fill as he looks over at Harry, who’s grinning now. “Harry, this is a Visconti.”
“Why tonight?” Harry whispers, relishing the feel of Malfoy’s skin under his fingertips.
Today, though, Draco notes, things actually look good. The connections between their different properties are strong, and nothing stands out to his inner eye as being particularly problematic. There’s something minor happening in the woods at the western edge of the chateau’s grounds, and Draco makes a mental note to reach out to Henri to have him take a look.
“Harry’s here,” he offers, and Keely rolls her eyes at him as if to say
Harry climbs down. They’re still well out of reach of the scortátus, but Malfoy’s found a nice, broad limb, sheltered from the wind. Harry slides down next to him, and they try to figure out how to get situated. It’s wide enough that one person sitting would feel quite safe, but not wide enough for two men to sit side by side. Finally Malfoy sighs. He moves into position, sitting with his back against the tree trunk, and lets his legs fall open.
Harry is sat on the couch, head back against the cushions. He’s slowed down on the shots, so he’s got a comfortable buzz on, and finally feels like he can breathe. He glances next to him and gives a happy crow of delight.
“Don’t wanna,” Draco mumbles, knowing full well that he’s being ridiculously dramatic, but he’s reached that stage of tipsiness where his filters have gone down, and they’ve gone down hard.
He shifts up so that his bum is resting on Harry’s sternum but Harry doesn’t seem to mind the weight, the way his eyes are glued to where Draco’s hand is holding his painfully hard cock.
Harry sits up and Draco can’t help himself, lets out a mournful burble at the loss of sensation. He frowns, though, when he sees the look on Harry’s face. Harry looks almost shy, bites his lip.
You’ve prepared, you’ve set up candles and lanterns and everyone has
Still deep in thought, Draco sets his water bottle down and walks into the maze.
“Boils?” Harry makes a face at Malfoy. “Wait, can it do that?”
Harry doesn’t always agree with tradition, but he does appreciate the weight of it.
“What?” Ron mouths back.
The ceiling comes down, the shield flickers out, and Harry fucking
“I love you,” Draco says and Harry pauses in his explanation of the special ink he’s purchased, to look at Draco, to shake his head and smile.
“Must be why Pomfrey sent you out here,” Draco snickers, “You’re more in need of meditation than anyone I’ve ever seen, Potter,” and he dodges as Potter knocks into him with his shoulder.
Draco glances down and then gives Harry a little smile. “I didn’t know, exactly. I wondered. Sometimes I’d see you looking at me.”
“Are you going to come with me?” Draco asks and smiles, relieved, as Harry nods.
Harry shakes his head. “No. It’s good, fuck. I had no idea. But I want you in me.”
Believed you were destined for glory, once you believed you were
“Absolutely. It’s fucking cold out there, no reason for both of us to freeze our bollocks off.”
Baffled, Harry folds up the note and slides it back into Malfoy’s pocket. He hopes he can be forgiven for lingering a bit over the curve of Malfoy’s ass, but it’s just really nice. In the other pocket, there’s also a piece of paper, so Harry pulls that one out and unfolds it.
“Granger,” he says, suddenly delighted, “There you are.” He raises one eyebrow at her because he knows it makes her laugh these days, and says, “Looking smashing, darling, simply smashing.”
Malfoy shoots him a keen glance. “Well,
Harry understands that, he does. Because he was trained by the best as well, though their methods leaned more towards the physical side of the spectrum, rather than what Draco endured. He’s told Harry about how his parents would just act like he wasn’t there, sometimes for days on end, and how confusing that was, when he was so young. He still has moments, Harry knows, where he’s not really sure that he exists. That anyone can see him.
Because that’s why they’re here. To get Harry off, and even though it’s awkward as
care — of course, he
Harry rolls his eyes and starts to walk towards the hallway that leads to the bedrooms. “Not really, Hermione, but that’s never stopped me before. Maybe while Malfoy and I are flower-picking in the Forbidden Forest at fucking midnight, you could check out that bottle, see if it’s been cursed?”
Malfoy takes a quick look over his shoulder.
Draco stares up at Harry and licks his lips. “What do I want?”
“Do we have to go back? Can’t we just sleep here?”
“Oh,” Harry says, “yeah. Draco and I got chased up into a tree by a scortátus. It’s still out there, so someone should probably go track it down or something.”
Being back at Hogwarts has been interesting, to say the least. If Draco’s being sincere, which is not a thing he really enjoys so pay attention, he’d have to admit that he’s been humbled by the forgiveness he’s been shown. He’s done his part, obviously, putting in long hours over the summer on the reconstruction, making public declarations of regret about his own wrongdoings (and if those happen to be 100% genuine, well, that’s really no one’s business but Draco’s), not to mention sending personal, handwritten apologies on the advice of his mind healer. Yeah, he’s done that too.
Harry’s eyes close and Draco watches the way he gives himself over to the sensation. “But it might,” Harry says, and gasps as Draco slips in deeper, “Might not.”
The letter has also been witnessed and signed by both Pansy and Ron, and when Harry taps their signatures, the authentication spell flares up his arm in a burst of gold and sparkles.
he needs. Nothing’s that interesting is the problem. It’s hard to see a future when he still can’t quite believe he’s going to live. Classes are whatever. He has no idea what he wants to do when he graduates. Even food doesn’t taste that good anymore. Everything is just. Grey.
Harry comes willingly, sliding up Draco’s body in a way that has Draco groaning. Harry fuses their mouths together, and Draco has to say, that Harry Potter wanted to wait is in no fucking way an indictment on his skills, because the man?
Draco plants a kiss between what he thinks are the shoulder blades, although it’s difficult to be sure, and there’s another mumble, a cough and then Harry rises to the surface of the blankets like some bewildered sea monster. His hair is a disaster, there’s a pillow crease on his cheek, he smells like smoke and stakeout, and he’s the most beautiful sight Draco’s ever seen.
Hermione stares at him. “Draco, no. You don’t want―” She stops, presses her lips together. “Draco, you don’t want to see him like this. He wouldn’t want you to.”
Draco raises his eyebrows and nods solemnly. “It certainly did.”
He remembers the feel of Harry under him, the taste of him and the scent of him, the way Harry had watched him as he’d come, and he knows, he’s ruined for anyone else. But, he thinks, as he recalls the look on Harry’s face as Draco had kissed him in the glow of the setting sun, the way Harry had pressed his forehead to Draco’s and murmured his name, and it settles into his gut, a deep and shining certainty, that whatever this is…
“Harry’s worrying about saying no to Kingsley,” Ron mumbles from where he’s buried his face in Harry’s shoulder.
of dissatisfaction and then freezes, but there’s no sign from behind Malfoy’s curtains that he’s heard anything. It also appears that he’s forgotten to cast a silencing charm because Harry can hear him, quite clearly.
“So, no wands, no way down, and cock boils at sunrise,” Harry says, staring up into the night sky. He can see the moon and stars through the trees. He shivers, it’s colder at this height, and the wind is picking up. Harry pulls out his extra sweater and manages to shrug it on without falling out of the tree.
Harry can’t help laughing. One thing he’s learned about Draco in the past several months is that he’s as bad as Hermione when he gets a thought in his head, and he can’t help chasing it to every possible outcome he can imagine. Draco’s whip-smart, it turns out, but also deeply intellectually curious in a way that Harry just is not, and that look, that question, are very familiar to Harry from classroom discussions, dinner conversations, and even one particularly memorable shower argument.
“Oh,” Draco says breathlessly. “Fuck, Harry. What have you thought about?”
“Cock boils sound terrible.” He gets to his feet. “At least let me get some shoes on.”
The moment feels fragile, like some delicate, new balance has been established between them, and, Harry realizes, he doesn’t want it to happen like this, and he sure as hell doesn’t want to push Malfoy into anything he doesn’t want to do.
“Coming, Potter?”
“Yeah,” Harry agrees and they stand silently for a long moment. “Do you have any idea where to start looking?”
Malfoy’s voice crescendos.
It seems like a fine time to practice a bit of wandless magic, and Harry feels a flush of satisfaction as warm, fragrant oil coats his palm and drips down onto his belly. He’s not sure why his Lubrico always smells like sandalwood and incense, but he likes it. He wonders idly what Malfoy’s Lubrico smells like.
“You will,” Harry says, and his smile is everything as Draco realizes he’s murmuring aloud. “Draco, it’s already so good, just because it’s you. Everything else is just. Extra.”
from his orgasm. It’s difficult to muster up the self-disapprobation he thinks is absolutely the appropriate response to his own creepiness.
“Mr. Malfoy,” she says, giving him a suspicious look. “What are you doing lurking about the teacher’s lounge?”
“What,” Draco practically begs, “ What things?
Of death any one of a thousand times but this,
“What about wandless?” Malfoy asks and Harry sighs.
Harry nods frantically and then reaches down, pausing Draco’s movements. “Too good. Just. Fuck, hold on a moment.”
Draco just nods curtly, feels Harry’s fingers slip down and past his balls to stroke at the delicate skin there.
Whatever you want. Just tell me what you want.”
“Like a scortátus?” Harry asks and Ron blinks in surprise.
He pauses, takes a breath, and focuses in, pulling magic out of his core, and then his hand is dripping with warm oil that smells of sandalwood and incense.
Draco shrugs. “People always expect me to bottom.”
Draco feels Harry’s hands stroke firmly from the base of his spine all the way up to his shoulders and back down, coming to rest on his low back. Draco turns his head and presses a kiss to Harry’s shoulder, and then reluctantly shifts and pulls out.
He reaches out a hand and draws his fingers lightly over the bulge in Harry’s jeans and Harry shudders, trying not to fall out of the tree. They shift position, and Harry ends up sitting, back pressed up against the tree and legs stretched out. Draco starts to turn to face him, and Harry shakes his head.
“I mean,” Malfoy says, and then inexplicably he begins to laugh. “When you put it like that, it sounds, well.”
Harry groans and lets his head lean back against the rough bark of the tree. “Well, that’s just fucking great, isn’t it.”
“From that stall over on Diagon?”
“No, wait!” Potter says, more loudly than is warranted as Draco is standing right here.
Then Draco almost chokes on his inhale because that utter
Harry looks closely. It’s dated almost two years prior.
“Weren’t you listening?” Malfoy stares at him. “Yes, it can do that. It’s binding magic.” He looks thoughtful. “I do wonder where Lovegood picked that thing up.” He shakes his head. “Anyway, yes, Potter. When you agreed to play, you agreed to be bound by the bottle’s judgment.” He makes a face. “I don’t know about you, but I’m not really keen on a week’s worth of boils.”
“Well,” Draco says, and licks his lips. “Here’s what I’m thinking. This bark is kind of rough, and you’re in jeans. How about you with your back to the tree there, and me, on top of you.” He makes a gesture at his lower body. “Joggers. Easy access.”
Not so much for Harry though. He and Ginny hadn’t even tried after the war was won. Harry had spent the summer going to funerals and trials, arguing for leniency and forgiveness. Saying goodbye to his beloved dead, never to be forgotten. Romance had been one of the last things on anyone’s mind. When they’d all returned to Hogwarts, Harry had thrown himself into the work of the reconstruction. At first, his body had been numb with leftover fear, then exhausted from physical labour. It’s only more recently that he’s begun to feel stirrings of a more carnal sort.
Draco is pretty sure he loses some time to Harry’s mouth, the way Harry sucks and licks, the way Harry somehow manages to slick up his hand wordlessly and wandlessly, without letting up the suction, and how he wraps that slick, hot hand around the base of Draco’s cock.
Harry grins, and he looks so young and so beautiful that Draco’s breath catches in his throat.
Harry had said, and Draco had replied—
Draco just gives him this look, this exasperated, fond look. “You’re an idiot, Potter. Of course it means something. It means everything.”
from — one minute, they were waiting on their backup team, the next, there was the unmistakable feel of the wards slamming down, cutting them off from the rest of the team, and then.
The game continues with more uncomfortable truths and ridiculous dares, and then Harry sees it. The Bottle sparks green and silver and lands on Malfoy.
Harry stares at him and begins to grin. “Well, you are blonde,” he says and Draco smacks at him half-heartedly.
Even though Keely lives with them at Grimmauld Place, she’s as tied to the Manor as Draco is, and always comes for the Solstice rituals.
Harry lets himself relax, leans back, and rests his head on Malfoy’s shoulder so he can look at the stars, and has to admit, the extra warmth is really pretty nice.
“We can bring him back. Hermione, I know the spells.”
too interested in his simul-casting, and he foresees many long nights in the Department of Mysteries in his near future.
It feels as if his orgasm is being wrenched out of him from the depths of his very soul as he slams in as deep as he can get, the heat of Harry’s body enveloping him, and he feels the way Harry clenches around him, pulling another wave from him.
“I mean,” Harry feels compelled to point out. “You did just have your tongue in my mouth. Pretty sure that’s a first-name-basis kind of activity.” He doesn't point out that Draco's just called him by name.
“You be quiet,” Draco thinks he hears Harry mutter, and then Harry just fucking
They’d been friends, then more, and now, after tonight, Draco thinks, lovers. That last barrier between them to be taken down.
“Wait, us?” Harry asks and realizes that yes, the bottle is actually pointing exactly to where they’re pressed up against each other, and not just at Malfoy as he’d thought. “Okay, so what is it?”
Harry dies on a beautiful, sunny May morning. The sky is so blue, and the cirrus clouds look like waves rolling into the shore. Harry dies exactly the way he lived, Draco thinks. Reckless and selfless. Throwing himself into a fight that wasn’t even his. Draco can’t speak when Hermione comes to tell him, eyes red and swollen from weeping. She still has his blood on her sweater. She’s soaked in it.
Draco nods, not taking his eyes off of Harry, and then they’re kissing again. Harry pulls back with a gasp.
“Harry!”
Finally, Draco opens his eyes and blinks at Harry, clearly dazed by the force of his orgasm. “Fucking hell,” he croaks. “That was amazing. You’re gonna have to give me a minute, I can’t feel my legs.”
“But,” Harry sighs. “So we need to head into the Forbidden Forest, look for some flower, and we might have to stay all night? What does an enchanted bottle even need a flower for, anyway?”
He looks up to meet Harry’s astounded gaze. Harry’s eyes are wide, his mouth open and gasping. He’s leaning back on his elbows, blades turned away from his body as he watches Draco, as if he’s seeing something rare and precious, something beautiful. When their eyes meet, Harry groans, long and low, and Draco can feel him shaking.
Harry hears those words all the time, Draco knows. People mean them in different ways, but they all say them to Harry. Strangers in the street, when what they mean is thank you. His friends with their impossible easy affection. The way Harry and Ron will give each other exaggerated kisses when they take their leave, while Hermione just shakes her head and laughs. The way Molly will look at Harry with exasperated fondness and swat him with a dishtowel as she says it. Harry hears those words all the time and says them too. Words come easy to Harry these days.
Malfoy snorts. “Keep it in your trousers, Potter. Not sure if you’ve noticed, but we’ve got a tiny situation happening here.”
“Truth or Dare, Draco Malfoy,” the Bottle intones, and Malfoy leans back with what can only be described as a smirk playing about his lips.
“I’d think that was evident to see, wasn’t it?” He takes another step.
Harry slides down so that he’s lying flat on his back. “I’ve thought about you, over me…” His voice trails off and Draco swears he sees Harry’s soft cock give a twitch, as if valiantly trying to rise to the occasion. “Jerking off over me. Fuck, Draco, would you?”
Harry shrugs. “It’s about all I can do so far.”
He tries to make his voice sound distracted, busy. Occupied.
“Harry will know where to find you in the morning?” Ron asks carefully, and Draco stares at him and then just nods.
The hedge maze appears empty as Draco approaches it. He doesn’t want to call out for Potter, because he is unquestionably here on a casual visit. If they meet up, they meet up. Draco shrugs internally. It’s cool either way. Obviously.
Malfoy has opted to stretch his legs out, back up against the main trunk, wand gripped tightly in one hand. He’s closed his eyes, and his chest is heaving as they both start to come down from the adrenaline of the race.
“I want this,” Harry says finally, “With you. Not just because of that monster down there wanting to kill us or because of the threat of boils. Because I do. Want you. Did you know?”
“Draco,” he pants, “Fuck, that’s. Oh my god,
Harry moves his hand faster, focusing on the way Draco’s abs flex as he moves. “Fuck, Draco, you’re so…” he gasps, feeling that white-hot heat gathering deep inside of him, knowing he’s so close to the edge. “Can you… fuck, just…”
Hermione says nothing, and there’s nothing to be said, is there? Draco knows that for the rest of his life, this will be the defining moment. The moment that separates before from after.
Draco rolls himself over so he’s lying flat on top of Harry, his hard cock pressing into Harry’s belly. He thrusts once, then again.
He steps out from behind the flaming pile of metal and stomps forward, curses firing so fast from his wand that they light up the dim interior of the warehouse. He’s pretty sure he’s also simul-casting with both wand and non-wand hand, which isn’t even supposed to be possible, but Malfoy’s down, and Harry can’t hear him at all, and he needs this to be over.
Hermione snorts as Ron says philosophically, “It’s winter, mate,” and puts a hand on Draco’s elbow. “I’ll see you at home,” Ron says to Hermione, and pressing a quick kiss to her mouth, apparates them away.
To be happy, to have cake if they want it, and we want them to know
But here’s something unexpected, Draco Malfoy slouching into the room like he owns it. Draco Malfoy looking around and then. For a moment Harry thinks he’s been caught as Draco’s eyes narrow as he looks at Harry’s bed, where Harry is lying under the cloak. But then he just smiles and turns away, walking towards his own bed.
They make their way to the kitchen and out the back door. From there it’s a short walk to the small cedar structure on the edge of the lake. Keely’s clearly already been here, as there’s a fire burning merrily on the hearth, and tea has been set out at the table. The sauna itself takes up the back half of the structure, and Draco knows Keely’s been in there as well, lighting the fires, setting out the ritual oils.
Draco leans in, nips at his jawline, mouths his way over to the sensitive skin just under Harry’s ear. “I want to.”
Draco snickers and the air between them lightens.
Draco has no sense of how much time has passed when he feels Harry’s hand on his knee, and Harry says softly, “The timer’s run out, love.”
“Now I’m all self-conscious,” Harry complains. “It’s a lot of pressure.”
He looks up to see Malfoy staring at him, but as soon as their eyes meet, Malfoy looks away, flushing.
“You can have them all, Harry. For the rest of my life.”
Harry slicks up his prick, which is really hard now, as he listens to Malfoy’s gasps.
Harry laughs in spite of himself. “It’s just. Kingsley… People… I know they’re going to feel let down.”
He’d tried to explain once to Harry, what he sees in his minds’ eye.
“What do we fucking do?” Malfoy yells out.
Malfoy stares at him. “What are you suggesting, Potter?”
Malfoy snorts, takes a sip from an actual crystal snifter, the pretentious bastard. “I’ve been here all evening, Potter.”
Harry blinks his eyes open and can’t help staring. Malfoy is
Draco lets himself drift off. The sun is rising. The longest night is over, and it is time for rest.
“The problem is, Potter,” he says seriously and Harry snorts. “I do believe you’ve broken me, ruined me for anyone else.”
Draco pulls his hand back and Harry legit whines.
“It’s time,” he says quietly, and Harry doesn’t say a word, just nods and gets to his feet.
Harry’s never quite figured out if there’s any rhyme or reason to the sparks the Bottle emits as it spins and chooses its next willing victim. There’s nothing he can identify, but they’re pretty to look at, nonetheless.
Harry breathes, rolls toward him, slings one arm heavy across Draco’s chest. He’s warm and solid in the dark, and his arm feels nice across Draco’s chest. He feels Harry’s hand pressing into the cold skin of his shoulder, Harry’s thumb tracing the ledge of his collarbone.
And it feels like a gift.
“That ass Macmillan knocked your shears into the cauldron, didn’t he,” Draco says and Potter stares at him.
Draco rolls his eyes and then gives Harry a smile that takes Harry’s breath away. “Harry. I want this. I want
More often than not when it’s blustery and cold,
His voice is soft but clear, full of longing and Harry is breathless, flooded with memories of a cold night and a boring Ministry party. Escaping the crush of the crowd to a small balcony, only to find it occupied. The way Draco had smiled at him, the way they’d talked. The feel of Draco’s mouth under his, and how Harry’s body and mind had come alive and taken flight in a way he’d never felt before, and certainly hasn’t felt since.
“Yeah, I’m in,” he says and sits up to scootch backwards and join the circle that’s formed.
Harry reaches down, starts jacking himself off, hard and fast, even as he rolls his hips to meet Draco’s thrusts, even as he keeps calling out.
It turns out, compared to the real thing? Harry’s imagination has failed him profoundly. He’ll have to return it, get a better one. Maybe speak to the manager.
,” and then they’re kissing.
The paper snaps back up into place and Malfoy says, “Fine. We can go to the place with the muffins.”
Draco thinks of all the other things he could say. The way the house would go cold and silent in the aftermath of his parents’ fights. The way they’d already made their choices, before he’d even been born.
“So I just wanted to be prepared, should the occasion arise.” Malfoy reaches out, skates one hand gently over the bulge in Harry’s jeans. “Seems like it did?”
Draco is shifting on top of him, and it’s good, so good, that it’s all Harry can do to keep from crying out, and then Draco does it again, and Harry starts to rock his hips too. He shifts his hands up, tracing over Draco’s ribs until he gets to his nipples and as he gently thumbs over them, Draco’s head drops back onto his shoulder and he moans.
spelling the curtains closed.
“I’d like it if you stayed,” Potter says, much quieter now. “I’ve missed you.”
. He’d just like to know that Potter’s okay.
Draco nods. He doesn’t love Harry’s Auror work, and he knows Harry doesn’t love it that much these days either. Things have calmed down since the war, and most of the time, Harry is dealing with the petty, day-to-day evils of peacetime. He’s not enjoying it much. Draco knows McGonagall’s been recruiting him to DADA for years, and he rather thinks next year may be the year Harry packs it in and accepts. Draco’s always known Harry was born to be a teacher, he’s just been waiting for Harry to catch up.
Malfoy fucking kisses him, right here in front of the sink and the urinals. It’s surprising which is why it takes Harry a minute to catch up. Once he does though, he's fully committed to the moment.
“Limited,” his mind healer had said. “They were limited. Imperfect.”
. Potter has seen the way Draco looks at him when he thinks Potter isn’t looking back, and he knows about Draco’s terribly embarrassing and inconvenient feelings. Draco closes his eyes against the humiliation of it all.
, even his pout sounds cute now, and Harry thinks blindly that he might be in real trouble. “Yes, you’re right. Talking. That’s good.” He leans back and fixes an expectant gaze on Harry.
Soon, there aren’t many left standing. Harry glances down to realize his whole body is alight, as if he’s wreathed by lightning, and he is incandescent in his rage and fear. He thinks vaguely that he should be trying to preserve the scene, but all he can manage to do at this point is pull back from unleashing a lethal level of power.
Draco looks around, and finally shrugs and scoops up his tank top. He casts a quick
“It’s just,” Draco says thoughtfully, “there was a branch of the Abernathy family, the Flanagans, and they raised all sorts of magical creatures on their estate on the southern coast of Ireland. Dark creatures, Harry.”
“Malfoy,” Harry whispers, and then, “
He starts moving forward, and hasn’t gone very far when he hears something up ahead of him, and throwing caution to the wind, he hurries forward, following the twists and turns of the maze, chasing the sound that he can’t quite identify, until a voice pulls him up short.
“What’s the consequence?” Harry asks and can’t help but notice the way Malfoy is leaning forward, resting his chin on his hands, eyes gleaming in the light of the fireplace as he watches Harry, and Harry can’t interpret his expression at all.
Harry grins and slides down to the floor, lands on his knees. “Like this?”
Harry reaches up, presses Draco’s hand to his own face, and then turns his head to press a gentle kiss into Draco’s fingers, curled around the handkerchief.
“Are you ever wrong?” Harry had asked, fascinated as always by old magic.
He’s not sure anyone’s ever wanted to get it right with him before.
charm snap into place once they’re far enough apart. He hears Malfoy’s tuneless whistling, and at that familiar sound, Harry’s heart rate finally, finally starts to slow down.
“How on earth…”
Harry shakes his head. “So what do we do now?”
Potter flushes an even deeper shade of red. “I’ve got, err,” he gestures, “elastic waist pants, so I can just sort of pull them down if I need to, you know.”
There’s a moment of silence broken only by the crinkling of the wrappers as they open their candy, and the sounds of an angry animal stomping through the underbrush as it approaches. They’re high enough up that Harry can’t quite see it clearly, but it’s big.
, tightening his grip and moving his hand faster.
That maybe now you understand.
“Forget I said anything,” Harry says. “I mean, I know you don’t… You’re not. About me. I know that.”
He waves a lazy hand at his robes, and the stains disappear. Draco has to admit, he’s a bit disappointed, but also relieved. Draco carefully puts his own clothing to right and then looks back at Harry. He sighs, pulls out a handkerchief, and leans in closer, wiping Harry’s face clean.
“Besides,” Draco adds, slipping his hands up under Harry’s sweater and shirt, fingers cool against Harry’s hot skin, “if we don’t… now, we’ll have to wait a full week, because of the boils. Do you want the boils, Harry? Because I really, really do not.”
“What the fuck is that?” Harry asks, wedging himself into a vee of branches.
“Now, you’re gonna finger me,” Malfoy says with a tone of great satisfaction, and Harry’s eyes widen.
Ron flops down onto the bed, slinging an arm over Harry’s stomach. “You already know what I’m going to say.”
“What do you mean?” Draco had asked, heart pounding.
“Malfoy, where’d you come from?”
The air is thick with the smoke of missed hexes and curses, and he can smell them as they fly past him. Harry is somewhat hidden behind some huge piece of industrial equipment, its purpose entirely unfathomable to him. At least he’s got eyes on Malfoy, Harry thinks, who’s got his back pressed to the wall, sheltering behind his own unidentifiable pile of metal and rubber.
The hubbub of the common room is cut off when the door closes and Harry can’t help but fully experience the utter awkwardness of the moment.
And just like the candles, its reflection amplifies the glow
“Potter. Harry.” Draco looks a bit dazed. “Fuck.”
“Unicursal, it means there’s just one path to the center, and then you take the same path out. You can’t get lost.” Potter tosses Draco a quick grin over his shoulder. “They’re for walking meditation.”
“Off,” Draco says, sounding overwhelmed, now pulling his own shirt over his head and tossing it aside. “Fucking take this
Feeling more grounded, Draco looks around the familiar room, leans back against the wall, and lets his eyes close. He takes a moment to scan his own body, his inner eye looking for tension or discomfort. He stretches over to release his lower back, wiggles his toes, feels the way the heat presses in, the way he’s starting to sweat. Then he stills his body and opens his mind, softly murmuring the incantation that invokes the Head of Household link.
“I look at you too,” Draco says, and reaches up, drags his knuckles down Harry’s cheek and across his mouth. “So much, Harry. You don’t even know.”
“Harry,” Malfoy says quietly, suddenly sounding far more sober. “Look at the date.”
They’re stripped down to their pants, and Harry is currently mouthing his way across Draco’s chest, as Draco grasps at the sheets, his back arching into the wet heat almost involuntarily. It’s so good, so fucking good. It’s never been like this, Draco thinks. He has a feeling Harry Potter may ruin him for all other men. Draco suspects, in fact, he already has.
“I’ve just…” Draco runs a hand awkwardly through his hair. “I’ve never, you know.”
“I did,” Harry says quietly. “I do.”
Draco stares at him, eyes wide, and then licks his lips reflexively. “Oh.
Draco’s face closes down and he takes a step back. “Oh. Of course.”
Draco gets to his feet, teeth chattering. “It’s bracing,” he says and Harry rolls his eyes at him.
“You’re on, Potter,” Draco says, and he’s still laughing when Harry apparates them straight to his bed.
They head back to the common room, followed by a crowd of people, including all of the 7th and 8th-year students, as well as McGonagall and Urkowitz, the new DADA professor. Ron explains as they go that the bottle had been cursed by Lola Flanagan, a sixth-year girl who’d transferred in from somewhere in Ireland that year. Apparently, Harry had turned her down in the fall, and she’d taken it poorly.
To be honest, every time Draco’s pictured having sex with Harry Potter, he’s always assumed he’d be the one bottoming.
Draco drops to his knees, doubles over like he’s been punched in the gut, because he has.
Draco doesn’t look up as a warm body slides into the booth next to him. He doesn’t look up as an arm is draped across his shoulders and he doesn’t look up when a hand reaches over to grab the whiskey glass and lift it to the interloper’s lips.
They walk in silence for a few more minutes, and then, after one last turn, they’ve made it to the center of the maze. Labyrinth. Whatever.
So, it’s been months, and Draco’s been surprised to find how much he’s enjoyed it. How fun it’s been to get to know this Harry. They’ve been friends for years now. After the war, Draco had worked hard to redress the wrongs he’d done, and Harry. Beautiful, brave, forgiving Harry had offered his hand in friendship in front of the whole world.
Harry sighs, and flops down next to Draco on the bed. Draco shifts so he can see Harry’s face, reaches over, and traces a circle on Harry’s chest.
Ron smiles and Harry enjoys the way his eyes crinkle up at the edges.
Now they’re here, in Harry’s bedroom, sprawled across Harry’s very comfortable and expensive mattress. Draco can’t help but notice that Harry’s put clean sheets on the bed and tidied the room. Flowers on the dresser. When he’d opened the door to his bedroom, Harry had waved a hand, and candles had burst into flame, leaving Draco to wonder when, exactly, Harry had decided he was ready. He’s set a romantic scene, that’s all Draco’s saying.
Harry wraps his arms around Ron and closes his eyes. “It’s not that easy.”
He sees the way Dean and Seamus sit up quickly; the way Ginny leans in, looking intrigued. Ron, bless his soul, just rolls his eyes and mutters something in Hermione’s ear.
Draco starts to move, slowly at first, giving Harry time to get used to the sensation. He shifts his hips and knows exactly the moment he’s found it. Harry’s eyes fly open and his mouth rounds into a gasp of surprise that ends on a moan as Draco keeps up the slow and steady pressure. Harry’s cock is hard now, and he’s starting to move too, starting to make these small groans that race down Draco’s spine like wildfire.
He follows as Potter turns, waiting for Draco to catch up before starting to walk further into the maze.
Draco doesn’t see much of Harry before lunch. He’s locked in the study with the lawyers and businessmen, and it’s the type of meeting that would have Harry punching himself in the face to relieve his boredom, so for everyone’s sake, it’s best that he’s off doing whatever it is that he does during Solstice Day while Draco attends to business.
As he slides over the edge, feeling safe and warm and so close to Draco, he hears Draco whispers something back to him, and it’s not until they wake up hours later, not until Draco has pushed deep into Harry, moving within him with such power and grace that it almost makes Harry cry at how connected and intimate it feels, that Harry remembers what Draco had said to him.
but Malfoy just keeps looking at Harry.
“Would that be so bad?” Harry asks finally, uncharacteristically hesitant. “If people knew?”
and he
“Maybe,” Harry says, “You might be willing to…” he looks Draco up and down, eyes landing on the substantial bulge in Draco’s leggings. “Maybe you’d be willing to indulge me? In something
“I want that too,” Draco says, just as quiet, and watches the way Harry smiles.
“Wandlessly?” Harry asks urgently and Draco nods again. “That’s so fucking hot,” Harry breathes and leans in to kiss Draco again.
Malfoy shrugs. “I’ve just, for a while now. Really wanted you. And I’ve been feeling lately, it seemed like maybe you wanted me too.”
“Did you just banish my shoes and socks?”
There’s a pop as the wards come down, shouts as the rest of the team apparates in.
“No,” Harry says, and common decency be damned, he yanks Draco in for another heated kiss. There’s really a lot of tongue involved. “I don’t mean we need to
Does Malfoy mean what Harry thinks he means?
It’s much easier going with the light, and even though Harry knows this is dangerous, he can’t help falling into something of a trance as they walk along. He’s lost all track of time when Malfoy stops suddenly and holds up his hand.
His tone is confident, but his look is uncertain, and it touches something deep inside of Harry.
“Fuck’s sake, Potter,” Draco says.
“Anyway,” Draco says, peering down at the ground, “the scortátus seems to have settled down. This might work, Harry.”
“Shh,” Malfoy says, “I thought I heard someth—” and then there’s something large crashing towards them.
She skids to a stop, takes in their rumpled appearance and clasped hands, and just smiles.
It’s an unseasonably warm day for mid-April, and Draco knows the hedge maze isn’t that far from the Hogwarts grounds, though students don’t tend to spend time there, what with it being generally overgrown and altogether creepy. Most of them have had enough of that to last a lifetime, thank you very much. Draco would generally include himself in that category, but the lure of Potter is too strong.
Ron turns his head and grins. “Ten points to Potter.”
This seems only to encourage Draco, who slides one leg in between Harry’s and Harry is shocked to realize he’s halfway to hard, pushed up against this shop window in downtown London. He’s pretty sure they need to get off the street
The power’s gone out though, to be fair,
, Potter? There’s no Bottle here, and I’ll take any consequence it gives me before I do something to you that you don’t want.”
Harry’s ears are ringing in the aftermath of the violence and he doesn’t even realize he’s shouting, frantic to find Malfoy, which is why he doesn’t hear it at first, Malfoy’s voice groaning. It only hits him when he crawls over the pile of scrap metal and rough shingles from the roof to find Malfoy lying on the ground, blood streaming from his forehead, and his left leg pinned under a chunk of something.
“I didn’t say it to—” Harry begins, and Draco reaches over blindly to pat his face.
“I love you,” Harry mouths at Ron, who stares back at him, obviously perplexed.
“Perhaps?” Harry says encouragingly and Malfoy rolls his eyes.
“Come here, Potter. I know you’re cold. This way we can share body heat.”
“Oh, Draco,” Harry says, and leans in to kiss him, once, and then again. “I know, sweetheart. I already know.”
“I think you had a
The man is like an octopus, Draco thinks, not for the first time, as he extracts himself from the bed. Five years, they’ve been doing this, and he’s still not sure how Harry manages to hold on to him.
want this.”
It’s not new, this thing between them. It’s not fragile. Draco’s not going anywhere for long, and he’s pretty sure Harry knows this. Pretty sure Harry knows he'll always come back, as long as Harry wants him to. But even now, it’s hard to find the words.
“It’s like a constellation, but of energy rather than stars. I can see the boundaries of the land. The manor glows at the centre of it. And our other properties and holdings, they’re all linked, regardless of distance. I can get a sense of where there might be issues.”
Malfoy presses his lips together and then nods. “I like breakfast.”
Draco obediently drinks, and when he’s sufficiently warmed, he takes himself upstairs and into the bedroom. Harry’s left the drapes open, and Draco can see the first blush of dawn outside as he carefully strips down to his pants and slides into the bed next to Harry.
This is a thing that happens
Malfoy shrugs. “Most wizards can’t do wandless magic, Potter. It’s not a big deal.”
Harry glances at Malfoy again, who’s swaying slightly and is now staring. Not at Harry’s face though. He’s staring at Harry’s prick.
in particular. Harry knows that he’s never been particularly known for his subtlety, but he’s quite sure no one’s picked up on these particular thoughts. Well, he's not entirely sure, actually. Hermione does often pat him understandingly and say things, "You know we love you for always, right, Harry?" and Ron says things like, "Malfoy's not a bad bloke, really," while making Very Meaningful Eye Contact.
“Don’t come yet,” Draco says softly and Harry shudders. “There’s more I want.”
“No,” he says, heart in his throat. “Like this.” He puts his hands on Draco’s hips and pulls him down, so Draco’s back is pulled flush against his chest. Harry shifts and Draco tips backward, and Harry can’t help the groan that escapes as Draco’s bum presses exactly where Harry wants him, and Draco gives a soft hum of understanding.
Harry watches as Malfoy grabs his towel from where it’s draped over the foot of his bed, and winds it carelessly around his narrow hips. Malfoy picks up his shower caddy with his fancy body wash and expensive shampoo, and walks over towards the boys’ bathroom.
“How’s your day?” Harry says, realizing he’s been silent far too long, staring at Malfoy, who is looking back with a puzzled expression.
“That’s both awesome and somewhat terrifying,” Draco observes and Potter shoots him a wry grin.
“I know,” Harry whispers back. “Go do your thing. Come to bed, no matter how late or early it is. I’ll be there.”
“I was thinking,” Malfoy says, staring straight ahead, “the Room of Requirement?”
Harry follows him, stumbling a bit in his eagerness. He halts next to the lounge. “How, errr…” he coughs, face flushing. “How do you want me?”
Potter just keeps giving him that knowing look and then simply raises one eyebrow.
Draco can feel it building, and he’s not quite there yet, when there’s a tap on the door.
Harry looks at him closely. “Are you sure? I know we were joking earlier, but. I’m not expecting anything. We don’t have to do anything.”
Harry looks sleepy, and Draco is flooded with a rush of affection for him.
Draco manages to say, “Potter? Oh yeah, he was here, headed off about ten minutes ago, said something about,” and Harry gives another long suck and Draco hates him, he really does, and he’s
“Don’t do it again,” Harry whispers. “Don’t leave.”
He doesn’t realize he’s saying this aloud until he hears Draco murmur between kisses and nips to his throat, “Fuck, I know.
Draco moves closer as Harry steps back, hits the door and halts. Harry sees the bartender set her paper aside, watching avidly.
. That moment hasn’t happened yet though, and it’s been weeks.
Finally, there’s a ceasefire, because all of the attacking group are down. Incapacitated or dead, Harry really doesn’t care much. Breathing hard, he shoves his wand into his thigh holster and turns, running back towards the debris where he’d last seen Malfoy.
Harry pulls back and stares at him. “You’ve got a what now?”
It must have been fast.
“I should blow you,” Malfoy whispers, breath hot in Harry’s ear, “Like, right here, on my knees, right now. Then you should take me home and fuck me.”
Sometime between the first sip of coffee and the last crumb of muffin, Malfoy becomes Draco.
Malfoy looks away, and Harry would almost swear that he’s blushing. It’s hard to tell in the moonlight.
“My mother,” Draco says finally. “She’d just come and sit with me when I was doing my lessons? Or, reading in the solarium. Sometimes she’d tell me about.” He pauses, takes a breath. “Flowers. The herbs in the kitchen garden. Like that.”
It’s also the case that since being back at Hogwarts, Harry has been in somewhat of a fog. He doesn’t seem to feel strongly about much of anything. Hermione thinks he’s depressed. Ron thinks he needs to get laid. Ginny thinks he needs something that absolutely isn’t her.
“I don’t,” Harry says delicately, “think Hagrid uses the same kind of assessment scale that we do for what counts as dangerous.”
Potter shrugs, lifts one hand as if to run his fingers through his hair, something Draco knows he does when he’s uncomfortable. Potter yelps as he remembers his hands and drops his arm quickly.
“Hmm,” Malfoy says, and Harry sits up and twists himself around so that he’s facing Malfoy.
Malfoy is drunk.
Love is right here, reflected back to you in the mirror
Harry gives a small
“I need you to trust me,” Draco says quietly and Harry knows he’s asking for so much more than this moment. “Please.”

charm will carry his voice directly to Malfoy’s ear, and sure enough, he hears a soft chuckle in return.
“You sure?” Harry asks around a yawn and Draco laughs.
He holds his hand out, trying to visualize the way McGonagall always tells him. She can’t figure out why he can’t do this. His power is off the charts, she’s told him, but there’s something that blocks him from accessing it without his wand.
“Well,” Harry says confidently, “if it was cursed, Hermione and Pansy will figure it out.”
right now, but this is the first thing he’s seen in so long that’s actually caught his attention. Draco’s body is long and lean, and he seems almost to glow in the sunlight streaming in through the large windows. He’s muscular but not bulky, and there’s a smattering of hair across his chest that is oddly enticing.
He puts his hands on Harry’s chest and gently shoves him down, and Harry goes willingly, tumbling onto the soft velvet of the comforter. Draco follows him down, and then they’re kissing again. Soon Draco’s moving from Harry’s mouth to his neck and Harry groans and turns his head to give Draco better access.
Draco nods. “Harry, I’ve... just… you know, for a while now.”
Draco wants Harry to talk to him, to call him by name. To let endearments fall from his lips, to tell Draco that he sees him,
When Draco wakes up, it’s still early, that soft grey that means the sun is on the rise but has not yet appeared. It’s December 21st, Draco thinks, and it’s the Solstice. The shortest day, and the longest night. He rolls over and comes to rest against a warm shape that’s not much more than a lump under the covers. He wraps his arms around the snoring mass, which responds with a grumble and attempt to bury itself even deeper under the pillows.
Harry’s not even sure when it happens, he just knows that by the time he’s ushering Draco out of the cafe, it’s

And today there is a chill wind from the north.

Harry’s wand, then to find the path. He casts the light again, and they resume walking, only this time, they’re side-by-side. This time, they’re holding hands.
“Spin the Truth or Dare Bottle. Are you in?”
“Harry,” Draco gasps, and Harry lifts his head, gives Draco a wicked grin.
“I want this,” Harry breathes and can’t help himself, leans in to steal another kiss. “I really,
“I need to wash my hands,” Harry says and Malfoy kisses him.
“Perhaps I like you a bit. A small and completely reasonable amount.”
Well, he doesn't
They’re laying down now, Harry tucked between the vee of Draco’s thighs, chest to chest, and Harry props himself up to take a look at Draco, who’s flushed and tousled beneath him on the couch. Harry gives him a wicked grin and then begins kissing his way down Draco’s chest, marveling at the feel of the soft skin under his tongue.
“A note,” Malfoy says, lining them up perfectly and starting to rock his hips. “Check my back pocket.”
Harry bashes into Malfoy more than once, and finally, Malfoy says, “Fuck it,” and casts a low
“I thought that was the idea,” Harry says but slows his hand. “What do you want?”

The way Draco had left the country the next morning, and there’s been no word of him since.
“Fuck, I don’t know,” Harry gasps, letting his head fall back against the pillows. He’s overwhelmed at how good this feels, how
“Draco,” he starts and Draco kisses him, sudden and fierce.
They make their way back through the warehouse, casting the

“Blessed Merlin,” Harry whimpers as he rolls over like a puppy in the snow.
“Oh, that’s good,” Malfoy murmurs. “I feel it all way down my body. I’m starting to get hard, feel that? That’s what you do to me, just touching me like this.”
“Okay,” Draco whispers. He gets to his knees, grabs the lube and slicks himself up, hissing a bit at the sensation.
“Sweet merciful Merlin,” Draco breathes.
He breathes in the icy air, breathes out the pain of his past until he feels all those spaces inside filled with the crisp, clear night, and it seems, as he approaches the completion point, that there is no difference between Draco and the land he walks; they are one. When he steps on the exact spot where he started, the magic tightens until it’s almost painful. There’s a pop, as if he’s cleared his ears, and Draco knows. His intention has been accepted and the ritual is complete for another six months. His presence as Head of Household is accepted. His intention is judged sufficient.
“I got this,” Harry says, bracing himself over Draco’s body with one arm. He swipes his free hand through the mess on Draco’s stomach, then grasps his dick, easing the slide with Draco’s own come, who’s watching this unfold with a grin.
“I know you’re tired,” he says, “so why don’t I take the lead here?”
They’re pressed together now, chest to chest, thigh to thigh and Harry feels sparks skittering under the surface of his skin as Malfoy wraps his arms around him, hands sliding up under Harry’s shirt to drag blunt nails across his lower back, and Harry shudders, a low groan escaping him.
Harry stomps off to his room, throws the door open. He hits the bathroom and then sits on his bed. It’s not even eleven and it sounds like they may be out for the rest of the night. He grabs a small knapsack and stuffs an extra sweater, a bottle of water, and a handful of candy bars inside. Then he changes his socks, laces up his trainers, curses his fucking luck one more time, and heads back to the common room.
Harry rolls back over, clearly almost asleep again even as he says, “Do you need me for the daytime stuff?”
He and Malfoy exchange a knowing look. The Pansy-Hermione friendship this year surprised everyone, and, Harry thinks privately, scares them all as well. Individually, they’re formidable. Together, they’re terrifying.
There’s a snort. “Schoolyard gossip, Potter? That seems beneath you.”
Draco pushes him back down and kisses his way down Harry’s throat even as he runs his hands down Harry’s side and Harry cries out with how good it feels, how amazing it is to be here with someone else. Not just anyone, Harry realizes. How amazing it is to be here with Draco.
In the light, a life where candles burn on a windy night and the house is full
The first time Harry says it, Draco leaves.
Hmm. That could work, Draco thinks. That could work very nicely.
“Holy shit,” Harry finally says.
“So,” Harry says. He leans over, rummages in his bedside table and pulls out the lube. “You down for this?”
. He clearly trims the hair around his prick, and it looks good, thick and oddly enticing. Harry frowns into the invisibility cloak. What is happening to him? Why is the sight of Malfoy’s cock, soft and heavy between his muscular thighs, so intriguing?
. Those words that are still here in the room, echoing off the walls. They hadn’t even been fucking, they’d just been in bed. Sitting quietly, not doing anything. Draco had been reading, Harry had been watching him. And he’d just said it.
Malfoy lifts his head, leaving his hands where they are, and looks absolutely delighted.
“You’re so fucking amazing, Harry, I can’t believe this. Never thought I’d get this with you. God, you’re so beautiful,” and Draco is pressing kisses to the top of Harry’s head.
“Hmm?” Draco says, and Harry sighs. He looks exhausted, and Harry just wants to bundle him up and carry him away.
But, it’s Saturday, the night is still young, and Harry’s already finished his Potions essay, so he throws caution to the winds.
He slows a bit, lets Harry ride it out, and Harry sighs, a long, low exhale, and opens his eyes. He looks stunned, Draco thinks, his chest heaving.
, oh my god. That’s so…”
Someone gasps. Someone moans, long and low, and Draco presses in even closer, the long, lean lines of his body firm against Harry. Draco’s body is warm in the cool, Spring morning, and the plate glass of the window is cold against Harry’s back as his shirt rucks up, and he hisses and arches at the sudden chill.
“No,” Potter says, his tone pleading and his face open and sincere. “I have, actually. Can we just. Come to the center with me, I’ve got some things there. Food.”
Draco groans, sits up, and kicks off his jeans. Harry reaches up and starts easing Draco’s pants down.
Harry eyes Draco’s body. This is so fucking creepy, he
But a few days ago, there’d been that Potions Incident. Draco had been paired with Neville who’s turned out to be surprisingly relaxed when there’s not a war on (not to mention, he’s fit as
Harry sighs. “I want to hold you,” he says quietly, and Draco pushes himself up so he can see Harry’s face.
“He’s alright,” Pomfrey says and Draco hears the sounds of tea being poured. “You know Harry. It’s going to take time for the curse to dissipate,” and wait a minute, what now?
“I just,” Malfoy runs a hand through his messy hair and Harry feels almost smug at how wrecked he already looks. “Do you want this?”
Because it’s time for dinner and the candles are lit and
“You’ve missed me,” he says flatly, quite sure this is some joke at his expense. “Har bloody har, Potter.”
You’re in the dining room, and you wave your hand to bring light
Harry feels like someone’s dumped a bucket of ice-cold water over his head. That’s right. Malfoy’s drunk.
“Excellent,” Malfoy says, and comes over to stand next to Harry. “You’re buying.”
Harry pulls him closer, kisses him soft and slow. “For once, just listen to me, you ridiculous man. Medi first, then naan.”
“—been tough on him, of course, but he agreed it’s best he stays isolated. I’ve sent him out to the hedge maze today to get some sun. To keep him occupied.”
Just, it feels like maybe it’s something.
“Oh fuck, that’s not a unicorn.” He abruptly changes direction, bolting off the path away from the whatever it is, calling over his shoulder, “Potter, come on,
It also hasn’t escaped his notice that more and more often, lately, there’s one specific jawline, one specific chest that makes him lie awake in the night, aching and wanting. Harry looks across the room to where that chest is sitting, currently curled up in the corner of the couch. It’s not just his chest, Harry has to admit. It’s his… everything.
Now, Harry doesn’t really have anything against Draco anymore. The war seems to have burned all that out of Harry, especially when he’d heard at the trial what had been done to Draco to keep him compliant.
Suddenly exhausted, Harry shifts so he’s wedged in between Draco and the couch back. He curls around Draco, who’s still got his arms wrapped around Harry, holding him close. Harry can’t help the yawn that splits his face.
“Fuck,” Harry says glumly, “I’ve only got four.”
“After shift?” Harry asks, not wanting to push too hard, but damnit, he’s been waiting for so long. “Today?”
“Just… Draco.” Harry can’t figure out how to put it into words, so he shows him.
Harry takes a deep breath and then nods, just once.
“Harry will know where I am.”
Malfoy nods. “I think I can stand. Tell you what?” He gives Harry an impish grin, and even covered in dirt and blood, he’s the most beautiful thing Harry’s ever seen. “Whoever binds up the most perps pays for curry.”
“You alright there, Potter?” Malfoy asks, and Harry can hear the amusement in his tone.
“It’s okay, I’ll just
“Up you get then, Draco,” he says firmly, as Draco closes his eyes in protest. “Let’s get you back to the Manor.”
Harry rolls over, murmurs something in a sleepy voice that Draco can’t quite understand, but he doesn’t need to. There will be time enough later for talking, for sex, for making plans, but for right now, all that Draco wants in this world is wrapped around him in this bed, grumbling as he tucks his frozen toes between Harry’s legs.
He’s being a cliché, he fucking knows it. It’s raining, for Merlin’s sake, a deep, heavy, soaking November rain. When Draco gets back to Harry’s flat to find him sitting on the sofa, head in his hands, Draco is shivering, soaked to the skin.
“Of course I do,” Harry says fervently. “I mean, the Bottle wouldn’t have… it wouldn’t have given you the Dare, right? If I didn’t?”
, and then there’s a flash of light and the ceiling comes down and the shield flickers out.

Harry is pretty sure that Malfoy must be extremely drunk because there’s no other logical explanation as to why Malfoy has not only followed him into the men’s room at the pub, but is currently standing
He quickly kicks off his own pants, and slides Harry’s boxer briefs down over his hips, taking a moment just to appreciate the sight before him. Harry Potter is lying there, in nothing but his own skin, flushed and hard, eyes bright as he grins at Draco, and then he deliberately bends his knees and opens for Draco.
This paper is a heavy, cream-colored parchment, and it’s dated at the top. The body says, in that same elegant script:

watching him as he pees.
The Bottle continues. “The time limit for this dare is two hours and the timer begins in ten minutes.”
He leans in, presses an open-mouth kiss on Harry’s jaw, and begins working his way down to Harry’s neck, that sensitive spot below Harry’s ear that makes him shiver and cry out.
He’s lying in his bed under the invisibility cloak. He’s not doing anything, which is probably part of the problem. He’s just lying there, trying to find the energy to get up and do… something. It doesn’t matter what.
Harry flushes and shrugs, running a hand through his hair. “I just, I saw it. Made me think of you.”
, and Draco takes a breath as the tap comes again.
“How?” Harry asks and Malfoy shrugs.

great when it all came out), he is proud that he spoke up (early and often, as Hermione likes to say) to advocate for forgiveness and inclusion, and now, months later, things have moved from uneasy truce to genuine friendships.
“Climb, fucking climb,” Malfoy hisses, setting off, and Harry hastily follows him up, limb to limb until they’re as high as they can safely go.
That there are Slytherins included in that group no longer surprises Harry in the slightest. He’s seen the way they’ve worked, he’s heard the anguish in their voices as they recount their own pain, and ultimately, Harry knows, they just want to move forward in this post-war world, the same as anyone else. As much as Harry hates his role as the
“For as long as you want me,” Draco whispers, his chest aching.
He takes a deep breath through a throat that’s inexplicably thick, and feels tears prickling in his eyes.
Harry snorts. “It’s just, you know that thing you said, about me just taking it?”
“I was thinking,” Harry says, pulling his face into a pensive expression, “that if it were true, perhaps we could have breakfast.”
“More?” Harry whispers, sounding almost broken at the idea. “There’s more?”
Oh yeah. Drunk. Definitely drunk.
, in the same way everyone else cares about Potter. He cares the completely appropriate and totally platonic amount of caring, and he’s not worried or anything. It’s just, he’s gotten used to seeing Potter around, in classes, at meals. Wandering back from the showers with only a towel wrapped loosely around his narrow hips, his surprisingly broad chest still damp, cheeks flushed.
“Fuck, that’s…” Harry presses hard, scrapes one nail carefully over sensitive skin that tightens up, and Draco arches into the touch. “Yeah, that’s really good,
“It’s not that I don’t. I do,” Harry says fervently, and watches as a smile starts to cross Malfoy’s face. “I really, really do. But, you’re drunk.” Malfoy moves closer, slips his hands back into position on Harry’s bum, and begins nibbling on Harry’s neck. “Gah, fuck. Malf—
Harry tosses his coat towards the rack and kicks off his shoes. He slides onto the couch, tucks himself under the blanket and presses himself up against Draco, right where Draco likes him to be. And he hands Draco a bag.
“Let me, Harry,” Draco says, not even really knowing what he’s asking for. “Let me.”
“Hmm,” Harry says. “Okay, and?”
“Do that spell again,” he says, his voice low and rough, and it takes Harry a minute to find his focus.
Harry sips the whiskey, lets the music wash over him. He’s very good, this guy, and Harry wonders how he ended up playing at this tiny muggle pub in London, what his story is. Then the man begins to sing, and Harry feels like he’s been punched right in the gut, because he knows that voice.
“No, just if you…” Draco rises up and makes room for Harry to pull his jeans down.
Harry thinks in shock.
Draco looks around with interest. It’s a small clearing, only about six or seven meters across. To one side, there’s a picnic table set up, and to the other, a small pavilion containing a comfortable-looking double lounge.
Draco scrambles to his feet and nearly impales himself on Harry’s scissorhands as he rips off his clothes, tossing them behind him. He straddles Harry’s thighs and reaches down to take himself in hand.
“That doesn’t seem fair,” he whispers and Draco laughs out loud.
and falls off the couch, and Harry is pretty sure he hears Ron say
After making sure the leggings really are as good as he remembers, Draco drops down onto the edge of his bed and ponders what else he might need for a casual and totally spontaneous visit to the hedge maze. He finally settles on a large towel to lie on and a book, because it’s absolutely plausible that Draco Malfoy would want to sunbathe in the hedge maze with a novel. He doesn’t actually have any novels in his room so he has to grab one from Pansy’s.
“You must know, Harry. I’ve wanted you for ages,” Malfoy breathes, leaning in again.
Harry sees movement out of the corner of his eye, casts hard and there’s a scream. Ahead of him, there are three wizards locked together, facing him, and as he advances, he sees it happen. The middle one’s nerve breaks and she turns to run.
“To being young and stupid and having absolutely no fucking idea what happens next,” Parvati yells, and another cheer goes up and the party is
And then, one day. Harry gets home a bit late. Draco’s on the couch, reading, curled up under his favourite fluffy blanket, forgotten tea going cold. He hasn’t even realized how late Harry is until Harry stumbles into the room, pink-cheeked from the January cold.
Draco is crying out now, almost incoherent as he grinds back against Harry.
here, Harry, and this
, here at the Ministry, where he has a desk that he’s sitting at. A desk under which Harry Potter is currently kneeling, looking up at Draco, flushed and wanting.
something to do with it,” Harry retorts as he manages to push himself up and off the lounge without slicing the cushion to shreds.
“Draco Malfoy,” the Bottle says and it sounds somehow portentous to Harry’s ears, “Do you accept the terms of this Dare?”
“Yeah,” Malfoy says gloomily. “They’re really rare, which is good, but once they lock onto your scent, they don’t let go. They’re fucking relentless. The only option is to kill them before they kill you. I had no idea there were any around here.”
“Maybe what?” Draco asks and Harry stares at him. “You just said, maybe…”
Draco gave up feeling embarrassed about leaning on his friends for these nights twice a year a long time ago. He’d stopped feeling guilty after staying up all night with Ron, about five years after the end of the world. Ron had wept openly, curled around Draco in the dark. Draco had wept too, and had felt something in him let go that night, as he understood that he’d been forgiven.
Draco kisses him, deep and slow, and then stands up, reaching for the button at his waistband.
“You two all right?” is all he says though. “Need the medi team?”
Draco rolls his eyes and lets go of Potter’s arm. “Okay, fine. I was just curious as to where you’ve been.”
and kisses him. When Harry’s imagined Draco kissing him, he’s always thought it would be more, well. Dramatic. That they’d be arguing and Draco would shove him up against a wall, bend him over a desk or the couch in the common room. The tables in the great hall. Harry’s thought about it a lot, actually, and it hasn’t ever, in his imagination, been like this.
“Where are you?” Draco asks. “I don’t see you.”
“Well,” Draco concedes, “I might have been marginally concerned. You disappeared from Potions and no one’s seen you since, and your guard dogs haven’t been at all forthcoming about where you were.”
He cringes at his tone. He sounds breathy, anticipatory. Eager, in fact. Which, he is, obviously, but still.
, Harry.”
“Should we talk about this? I feel like we should talk about this,” Harry says.
“Pretty hot though,” Harry says.
Ron’s here now, and eventually, the others come, and the days pass. Every morning, Draco wakes up and he remembers. They try to comfort Draco, and Draco wishes he could give that back to them, but he can’t. For Draco, there’s no room for anything but Harry now, and Draco is so full of his absence, he thinks it’s possible he’ll never be anything but empty again.
Their eyes meet and hold, and Harry holds his breath. They’ve been dancing around each other for months now, and Harry knows all of their friends are sick of it, and, he’s finally acknowledged, Malfoy’s never going to make the first move, so if something’s going to happen, it’s up to Harry.
Richardson gives Draco a concerned look. “You alright there, Malfoy? You look a bit…”
Hermione’s eyes overflow and she wraps her arms around Draco, pulls him in close.
Chaos.
Harry rolls onto his back. “No worse than usual. It’s just. Kingsley wants a decision.”
Harry and Draco make their way to the large, cargo bay door, and out into the warm sunshine. They pause and Harry glances over at Draco, battered and bloody, but still here, still standing. Harry lets himself exhale, lets down his guard. They’re okay.
Harry can see Malfoy go pale.
“And,” Draco continues, “what even counts as sex, anyway? Does it have to be penetration? Or just…”
“Well,” Draco shrugs, “I can be sneaky when I want to be.”
and so connected to every sensation in his body. As he groans, his head tipping back so Draco can fasten his mouth to Harry’s neck, Harry thinks he feels more
Malfoy, realizing how much Harry is on board with what's happening, somehow gets even more enthusiastic. He mouths his way across Harry’s jaw, his clever tongue doing something exquisite to the sensitive skin just below Harry’s ear that has Harry crying out. Fuck’s sake, Harry didn’t even know that
“Why’d the Bottle pick you?” is what Harry says instead of answering the question, and Malfoy looks startled.
“Oh well,” Harry says cheerfully, “My mistake.” He gets up to head back out to do rounds. “That’s too bad, because if you did somehow like me, I was thinking…”
“I know,” Draco pants, “How long until the curse wears off?”
“How was it?”
He wraps one hand around the base of Draco’s cock and settles into a rhythm, moving his hand in tandem with his mouth. His own cock feels impossibly hard, but right now, he’s fine waiting. This is about Draco, who is coming undone so beautifully under Harry’s touch.
before Ron is called to arrest them.
“I don’t want this,” Harry whispers, and to his horror, he’s perilously close to tears. “Fuck off, Draco.”
“I want your cock,” Draco says and Harry can’t help the way his hips jerk. “Get it out, Harry, come on.”
“No,” he says. “I want you to finish in me, I want to feel it.”
Malfoy has owned his mistakes, spoken passionately for reunification and healing, and most of all, he’s put in the time and the sweat. Like the rest of them, over the summer, he'd worked hard on the restoration. It had been rough when the term had started, but by the time the Winter break had come and gone, Malfoy and the other Slytherins had been folded back into student life at Hogwarts. It hasn’t been easy for him, Harry knows, but the grudging respect he’d given Malfoy for the way he’d stood up and done the right thing has shifted into something else now.
She settles on to the bed next to Harry and he reaches out, smiling as she intertwines their figures.
,” falling from his lips as Draco moves, faster and faster, hurtling now towards the inevitable culmination.
Harry barely has time to register that they’ve landed in Draco’s living room when Draco is shoving him over towards the couch. Harry drops down and Draco’s on him, legs splayed on either side as he straddles Harry’s lap. He’s really quite flexible.
, and then there’s a soft red light emanating from his wand.
All that to say, he and the other returning Slytherins have been folded, albeit a bit reluctantly, back into the social scene at Hogwarts, and anyone who knows anything knows that the only place to be
so that the door she’s tried to push closed behind her remains ajar. Draco looks about but there’s no one else in the corridor, so he leans against the wall and listens.
“Is that a fucking unicorn?” he yells, starting to pant from the exertion.
“Fine.” Draco frowns at the ground. “Yes, I want this with you too. No, it’s not just because of boils and monsters. I would also very much like to have sex with you tonight, though the logistics of making that happen in a tree this far off the ground are somewhat beyond me at the moment.”
The Moonflower is, well, lovely, Harry has to admit. It’s tall, coming almost to their waists, and it’s a large flower that looks almost like mother-of-pearl in the moonlight. Just to be on the safe side, they each pick one, and then Draco says, “Maybe a second? For backup?”
“I can’t feel my legs,” Draco mumbles, pressing his face into Harry’s muscular abdomen. “You’ve broken me, Potter.”
“So,” Harry says finally, as they leave the darkened grand entrance hall to the castle and head outside, “You think it was cursed? The bottle?”
With the flowers safely stowed in their packs, Harry looks at Draco.
And so, as the sun starts to set, they manage to get their trousers back on and make their way to the picnic table, where a delicious summer picnic has been laid out for them. Draco laughs himself hoarse at the sight of Harry trying to stab the chopped steak, and finally relents and makes sure Harry is well-fed. As it starts to cool off, Harry walks Draco back to the entry of the maze, and they wander back to Hogwarts, shoulders occasionally knocking together and exchanging grins. When Draco leaves Harry at the door to the hospital wing, they share one last kiss before Draco finally pulls reluctantly away.
“Oh fuck,” Harry says, and they start to run.
“That was,” Harry pauses, clears his throat, “I didn’t know. I didn’t know it would be like that.”
He’d walked Harry to his doorstep and kissed him. The kiss had turned hot, then something more, something consuming. Draco had pulled back, mindful of not wanting to push Harry, and Harry had reeled him back in, kissed him again, and said, gasping, “I’m ready, fuck. Fuck, Draco, I’m ready.”
After the luncheon is cleared and the lawyers have taken their leave, Draco goes upstairs to get ready. He looks up as Harry walks into the bedroom.
“What?” he asks, glancing around. “What did I miss?”
, you’re making me come.”
And then Harry had slid off the desk and onto his knees and Draco’s pretty sure he’s sleeping with an insane person.
It’s better when Harry comes along, even if it’s just for part of the ritual.
“I just don’t get it though,” Harry says. “Why does that fucking thing hate virgins? That’s so stupid. Virginity is a ridiculous concept anyway. How do they even know?” Suddenly, something occurs to him. “Wait just a fucking minute, Malfoy.”
As Draco makes his way back to his room, he feels something that he’s not sure he’s ever felt before. He’s not even sure this feeling has a name. It’s something like contentment and something like hope and something like gratitude, or maybe even some brand new blend of all three, a new feeling no one has ever felt before.
Harry can’t help himself and leans in to kiss Draco again, now that he knows it’s allowed. Now that he knows it’s
Hermione snorts. “You’ve never really been much of a planner,” she points out. “If you know you don’t want to be an Auror—”
You can hear the others moving about the house
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Malfoy nod. “I mean, Hagrid said he’s cleared out the dangerous stuff, yeah?”
And suddenly Harry is laughing too, the absolute absurdity of the situation hitting him. The scortátus really doesn’t like that and starts rearing up, pawing at the tree and making a noise that’s almost entirely unlike a horse’s neighing, and much more like, say, a person being tortured. It’s a big tree, but Harry swears he feels it shake under the attack. He and Malfoy immediately quiet down and stare at each other.
They’re pinned down in some dusty old warehouse. Harry doesn’t even know where these guys
“Yeah, maybe? Do you want me to stop?”
He has to press a hand to his own aching cock. It’s true, he does want this, but not more than he wants Draco to want it.
Together, they leave the heat of the sauna. Harry throws open the front door, and they plunge themselves into the snow to the side of the path from the house.
“Was that, err. Was that okay?”
“I mean,” Harry says hastily, “That was amazing, and I fucking mean it, Draco. Best thing ever. But maybe…” His voice trails off and he bites his lip uncertainly.
Draco can see how that might get dangerous and wishes he’d thought to get a haircut before coming out here.
“No, we’re supposed to be talking about… something… the thing. The anti-corn.”
Harry looks up at that. “Those really were good sandwiches,” he agrees.
Harry slumps back and sighs. “Sorry.”
“You didn’t bring your wand?” Malfoy asks in what could best be characterized as a shriek.
“Potter,” Malfoy says, and Harry looks over to find him staring straight ahead, grinning. “I have no fucking idea.”
Draco laughs, steps away, and turns back, holding out a hand. “C’mon, Potter. Let’s go. I’m cold and tired, and I want a shower and bed. With you, preferably?”
Draco listens to Harry breathe in the dark, lying next to him in their bed. Draco knows he’s not sleeping. He also knows it’s not “their” bed. It’s Harry’s bed. Harry’s flat. Draco lives somewhere else, though he also knows, of course, that he’s most alive here. Draco’s got his own side of the bed, his books stacked on his bedside table, and Harry sets out a glass of water for him every night.
Potter flushes. “Well, it’s not pretty, but the house elves cut everything into bite-sized pieces before they bring me food, and I can just sort of…” he mimes a stabbing motion, “spear it on the end of one.”
want this.” He glances away and then meets Harry’s gaze determinedly. “Don’t you think it’s been long enough? Don’t make me wait any longer.”
“Oh,” Malfoy says flatly, “So sorry. I must have misinterpreted the meaning of your tongue down my throat,” and he turns, as if to leave.
Harry opens his eyes. He feels stunned, lit up from the inside out, and he’s honestly surprised to see that his body isn’t glowing or shooting off sparks.
Malfoy had said Harry’s name as he was coming. Does that mean something? Harry’s pretty sure that means something. He has absolutely
Harry nods and Draco’s gaze softens.
, and it doesn’t seem possible that his love no longer has anywhere to go, when Harry has always been so much larger than anything else on Draco’s horizon.
“We’re going to die,” Harry says conversationally, knowing the
Draco pulls himself out of the trance and blinks at Harry, who’s looking red-faced and sweaty. In the summer, they race out of the sauna to dive into the lake, but winter’s ritual is a bit more invigorating.
“I have an idea, Malfoy,” he says, and Draco nods. “How about, we go back to mine where I’ve got some Sober Up, and then we can get started? I think if we’re dedicated and stay focused, we can probably get through the whole list by tomorrow night.”
But you know, all of you, that this is what happens and so
“Err,” Harry says, running one hand awkwardly through his hair.
to dampen the fabric, and then steps into Harry’s space and carefully wipes his own come from that beautiful face. It’s so tender and so profoundly erotic, Draco feels breathless with it.
“This okay?” Harry murmurs, his voice rough.
“Dunno,” Harry says, risking a peek out and hissing as something flashes by, a bit too close for comfort. “They don’t seem pleased to see us, though.”
Draco sighs. “Yeah. We should.”
Harry closes his mouth with an audible click.
Draco tries not to shriek out loud, but it’s difficult when it feels like his balls are contracting back up into his body.
“Forget it, it’s not working.”
“Not really,” Draco had answered. “I’ve been wrong about the severity of the issue? Or like, the cause of it? But that there’s an issue, no, I’ve never been wrong about that.”
Sometime between the first sip of coffee and the last crumb of muffin, Malfoy becomes Draco.
Harry gets to his feet, quickly unbuttons his own jeans, slides the zipper carefully down over his aching erection, and then kicks them off along with his boxers. He shoves Draco over onto his back, who goes willingly, a warm and amused look on his face.
Harry says, voice scratchy from sleep, “Late, like 3:00. We were just about to pack it in when the bastard showed.” The satisfaction is clear. “We got him dead to rights. Ron’s going in today to handle the charges.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Fine. Harry.”
Harry gives head with more enthusiasm than just about anyone Draco’s ever been with.
The pen is beautiful, solid and real in his hand as Draco removes it from the case. The body is deep purples and galaxies swirl down to the gleaming palladium nib.
“Well,” Harry says with a yawn, “Pansy told Ginny that Blaise told Luna that after I left pub night last week, you got drunk and told Ron how much you like me.”
“It’s okay,” Malfoy says, and then, inexplicably, “I’ve got a note.”
Draco knows how wrong they were, how wrong he’s been. How hard he tries now, to be better. To be worthy, especially of this. Harry’s mouth on his neck, his hands on Draco’s body. Harry knows too. Draco’s sure he does.
“Wait, what?” Malfoy asks and Harry sighs.
. “I don’t understand.”
Harry snorts and takes another swallow from his mug. “I love you,” he says fondly even as he grimaces at the taste. “That’s all.”
“Love you too, mate,” Ron says, and pulls Harry into an affectionate headlock, planting a loud kiss on his forehead.
“You’ve got nobody to blame for that but yourself,” he advises as he slides off of Harry and pulls himself to standing.
Draco watches as Harry actually shudders at his words.
As he walks, Draco reminds himself of all that he loves, all he stands for, and offers it back to this land that has sheltered him and protected him. It’s not the land’s fault that its people betrayed it, Draco thinks, as he does every Solstice. It’s not the land’s fault that it sheltered evil; that’s all on the humans who’ve lived here. Draco vows, as he does every Solstice, that it ends with him.
By the time they’ve made it to the clearing, Harry’s so tired he’s having trouble keeping his eyes open, and he only realizes they’ve arrived when he hears Draco mutter, “Thank fucking Merlin,” and, dropping Harry’s hand, Draco hurries away.
Draco reaches out, and slowly slips off Harry’s shoes, dropping them to the floor. He casts a discreet cleansing charm and Harry laughs even as he shivers and Draco grins at him as he begins to run his hands up and down Harry’s legs.
Harry steps towards the sink but Malfoy moves in even closer, getting in Harry’s way. He reaches out and puts his hand on Harry’s shoulder.
Finally, Harry looks up and meets his eyes, and something in his expression relaxes at the look on Draco’s face. “Yeah, I really fucking want that,” Harry says hoarsely, and Draco nods, just once.
“Oh right, other pocket, Potter. Check the other one. Put that one back though. It comes in handy.”
. Draco wants to believe that Harry knows him through and through, and loves him — not in spite of, but because.
Harry nods, swallows. “That I should think about what I want to do, not do something because I think it’s what people want me to do.”
“Tomorrow?” he asks breathlessly. “I’ll meet you there after classes?”
“Yeah,” Harry says, “I think you can… Yeah, more, Draco. Fuck.”
“I’ve had worse. So have you. We’ll be fine.”
. I can’t. It’s not. You’re drunk.”
“Yeah,” Draco asks, and presses in a bit harder, a bit deeper.
“That, Potter,” Malfoy says finally, “Is a scortátus.”
“Holy fucking
Harry shouts and thrusts up against Draco’s hand. His skin is hot and velvet-soft, and Draco lets himself indulge, grasping him firmly and running his hand up and down. Harry is moaning now, soft sounds that are music to Draco’s ears, and he tightens his grip, presses his thumb over the spongy tip and Harry cries out wildly.
what’s going on.
, Harry thinks. Does Malfoy have a lover? Is he going to preserve this memory for his lover to get off to? That’s certainly an idea. Harry’s prick gives a sort of interested twitch and Harry lifts his head to give it a startled look and then settles back onto the pillow.
Malfoy bends his knees and cages Harry between his legs, and Harry thinks somewhat hysterically,
For now, though. They’re standing here together in the sunshine. As the medi team descents upon them, Harry looks at Draco, who’s looking back, the smile he saves just for Harry, saves just for these moments, playing on his lips.
That Malfoy is fit as fuck has also not escaped Harry’s notice.
It’s pitch dark, of course, and Draco is so thankful for Hermione, who’s introduced him to Muggle cold-weather gear, so he’s wearing a parka, warm hat, mitts, and a scarf wrapped twice around his face, as well as something Hermione called trail shoes but just look like beefed-up trainers to Draco.
Harry looks across the room to where Blaise and Ginny are snuggled up and watches as Ginny fastens her mouth to Blaise’s neck, who, judging by the look on his face as his eyes flutter closed, does not mind this turn of events at all. Friendships, Harry muses to himself, and in many cases, more.
Draco ignores him, steps closer, and sees the way Potter freezes, his throat bobbing as he swallows.
But grace is not earned, it’s only given, like forgiveness,
Malfoy moves as if to sit up, and Harry presses a hand to his shoulder.
Draco pours the tea as Harry settles himself opposite Draco at the table, and Draco takes this opportunity to look at him, really look at him, as they drink. Harry looks tired, Draco thinks, but also there’s something different about him, a sense of freedom or lightness. Again, Draco lets himself hope that perhaps Harry is finally ready to make the change. He’s so stubborn, Draco thinks affectionately, loyal to a fucking fault, and he cannot be swayed to do anything before he’s ready, but this change has been a long time coming.
,” Harry says. “I just don’t know what I’ll do if I don’t accept.”
“Just tell me,” Harry says breathlessly, “Anything.”
And if once you believed yourself too marked, too damaged for a life
The Bottle rolls over twice. “The consequence is four days of offensive body odour. Do you forfeit?”
The first thing he does is go back to his room to change his clothes. He shucks off his robes and pulls on his stretchy khaki leggings and his favorite pink tank top. He may very well wish to do some yoga in the hedge maze, and it’s important to be prepared for that possibility. The fact that these leggings do fantastic things for his arse, and the tank top shows off the lean curve of his biceps, well, that’s neither here nor there. Total happenstance.
“I want to touch you,” Harry groans. “This fucking sucks.”
“Are you drinking brandy?” Harry asks and Malfoy looks startled, and then snorts.
“I think I’ll take the Dare,” he says, and Harry would almost believe he feels that casual about it, but he sees the way Malfoy’s throat moves as he swallows, notes the way Malfoy’s hand is clutching the back of the couch.
, it’s also. Well. It’s exciting.
You did not think you were destined for this. Once you
“Ow,” Malfoy hisses. “Fuck’s sake, Potter.”
“It’s you,” Draco says quietly. “It’s magic because it’s you. Because I love you.”
“You want to get comfortable? I think you should be lying down for this,” Draco says, and doesn’t wait to see what Harry’s face is doing, though if the groan Harry gives is any indication, it’s probably pretty great, and turns to walk over to the pavilion.
“I’d never sell you out,” Draco says quietly. “Not ever.”
“We can’t,” Draco gasps even as Harry sinks to his knees, “Fuck, Harry. We can’t, not here.”
Harry hears the sound of music, something slow and melancholic, from an open door and decides to stop in. One drink, he thinks, before heading back to his empty flat. Maybe he should get a dog. Or a ficus. He’s not sure what a ficus is, but he thinks Luna’s talked about them being difficult to kill. It’d be fitting, he thinks.
The thing chasing them has slowed down, almost as if it knows it’s got them now. Malfoy frantically boosts Harry up. Harry wraps his legs around the branch and reaches down to haul Malfoy up behind him.
Draco turns and looks over the oils that Keely has set out. As always, she’s given him a range of options, and he takes a moment to check in with himself, to see what feels like the best fit for this particular solstice. He finally settles on frankincense and cedarwood. First, he dumps a ladle of water on the hot rocks of the heater, then lets a few drops from each bottle fall, the scent of the oils mixing with the steam that’s now billowing throughout the room.
It hasn’t escaped his notice that it’s not the hips and breasts of his female classmates that draw his gaze or fill his mind’s eyes when he jerks off in the shower in the morning. Rather, it’s the memory of a sharp jawline or the thought of that smattering of hair on the flat planes of a more masculine chest that make his breath catch and his toes curl as he hunches over himself, trying not to groan audibly as he comes.
Harry nods, looking deeply pleased with himself. “Guy at the store said it’s a good one. The colours, they just reminded me of you. That time we went stargazing.”
“No,” Draco says softly. “It wouldn’t be so bad.”
“I love you,” he whispers to Harry who snuggles in closer.
Malfoy is standing right in front of him now, grey eyes gleaming in the candlelight. He’s settled into himself these days, Harry has noticed. He keeps his hair short on the sides, longer and tousled on top. He’s taller than Harry and he’s filled out, still lean but not so lanky anymore.
, Potter.”
“Curious,” Potter repeats. “You were… curious?”
“Breakfast?” Malfoy looks a bit confused.
Not Harry though. Harry’s just lying here, doing nothing.
The bottle lands on Malfoy and sends out its customary poof of smoke and sparks. Harry hasn’t quite figured out the pattern, it’s not like blue means truth and red means kissing. Malfoy’s poof is a deep pink-purple and there are definitely sparks happening as well. It’s really pretty, actually, and Harry sort of loses himself in watching the colors until suddenly he realizes everyone is quiet and staring at him.
He looks over at Ron who just gives him a wink, and Harry shakes his head, suddenly so grateful for Ron and Hermione. Then Harry’s gaze shifts to Malfoy who is just giving him a thoughtful look, and when their eyes meet, Malfoy smiles at him, small and sweet.
Maybe it's that simple, that we want the ones we love
Draco arches his back to give Harry more contact, and then says, “Harry, fuck, just do… something,” and Harry does.
It's a full moon, and there’s a chill in the air, and Harry wishes he’d thought to grab some gloves and a beanie. Malfoy looks cozy and cute in his giant hoodie.
Malfoy pulls back with a gasp. “Fuck,” he whispers, fingers tightening on Harry’s skin before he takes a step back. “Are you… Is this okay, Potter?”
Because he knows how you get after that third glass of wine.
He thinks about love and loss. He thinks about his father, dead in Azkaban not six months after his sentencing, and his mother’s flight to France. She’ll never set foot on British soil again, he knows. He thinks about the power of love and forgiveness. The way Hermione had offered him Rose to hold, not even two hours old. The way Ron had fought for him and Harry, had turned the tide of Weasleys towards acceptance. The way Harry looks when he laughs. When he cries. When he rages. When he comes.
“You’re on,” Harry says.
a minute, Malfoy.”
There are more awkward disclosures. Blaise has to demonstrate his O face and Ginny has to critique it. When Seamus claims he doesn’t know the length of his penis, fully erect, a ruler materializes in front of him with a pop. Harry is watching the Bottle as it spins, sparking silver and purple, and takes a breath when it slows to a stop, pointing directly at him.
“Shh,” he says, and Harry stills.
“You are insane,” he hisses, mindful of the fact that he’s still at the office. “Harry. What the fuck?”
“You should move up,” Harry says and Draco stares at him, then shifts so he’s over Harry’s belly.
There’s a pause and then Malfoy says quietly, “It could just as easily be me, Potter.”
The scortátus obligingly gives an angry shriek and kicks the tree again, almost as if it’s saying, “Get the hell on with it, you fucking virgins.”
Harry pauses and turns back. “Yes?”
“The issue is, we’re up in a tree, it’s fucking freezing, and if we lose our balance before we’re done, either the fall will kill us or that thing will.”
Harry’s eyes sheen in the candlelight, and Draco is shocked to feel his own throat tighten in response. It’s so powerful, this moment, he thinks. So powerful moving inside someone else, someone else letting you in. No less powerful for Harry, he thinks. Letting someone else in. Slowly, so slowly, Draco rocks his way forward until he’s all the way in.
“Draco,” Harry says, and Draco’s eyes snap back up to his face. “While we’re still young?”
“I love you,” Harry mouths again at Ron, exaggerating his lip movements.
Harry stares at him, and Malfoy just looks back, his gaze open and steady, and Harry sighs.
And then, Malfoy starts to talk.
As first kisses go, it’s. Well, it’s terrible. Harry just goes for it with his mouth open, misses the mark, and lands somewhere to the right of Draco’s lips. He corrects quickly and ends up clashing their teeth together and he’s pretty sure he’s just bitten Draco’s lip. Harry pulls back, and they stare at each other, Draco balefully rubbing his mouth.
Harry wipes his suddenly sweaty palms on his filthy trousers. “You’ve got some mad luck, you bastard.”
Malfoy slows down and squints, then mutters something and the light brightens. There’s something there, maybe 100 metres away and it’s gaining on them. Harry catches a glimpse of eyes flashing red and then Malfoy shouts in alarm.
His voice trails off. He gives Harry a careful up and down, then gives Draco the same treatment, and his expression changes to something a little knowing, a little amused, and he coughs.
“Good?” Draco asks quietly and feeling as daring as he ever has, reaches over to trace his thumb up the line of Harry’s hard cock. Harry throws his head back and cries out.
Harry pulls back from Draco, panting.
Harry opens his own knapsack, grabs his water, and drinks. He stuffs the bottle back in, pulls out two candy bars, and hands Malfoy one. Malfoy looks at it in surprise.
“Wait,” Draco interrupts. “Did you say Flanagan?”
Draco nips at Harry’s throat, drawing another frantic sound from Harry, a sound he’s pretty sure he’s never made before, and then Draco is sitting back and yanking Harry’s shirt up.
Draco indulges himself and just looks. Potter is lean lines and curved muscles, with a smattering of dark hair across his chest and a delicious trail that leads down to his… “Merciful mother of Merlin,” Draco whispers. “My god, Harry, if I’d known…”
He takes a few breaths, tries to think some unsexy thoughts, and soon, it feels, the crisis is averted.
Harry can’t help but glance over and, to his surprise, he meets Malfoy’s gaze.
“Do you get off on this? The risk of getting caught?” Draco whispers, and Harry shrugs.
“Are you fucking kidding me, Harry? I’ve been having detailed and explicit fantasies about being able to do whatever I want to you, and you just having to…” Draco licks his lips, “just lie there and take it. I’ve been thinking about it for months.
“All right there?” Ron asks from two meters away. He knows not to get too close on a Solstice Eve.
“That was,” Harry says fervently, “The best thing that has ever happened to me, Draco Malfoy, and I
Broken is how Draco would describe them. Broken beyond repair, long before his arrival.
The sounds Malfoy is making are incredible. Bitten-off gasps, whispered pleas, a long inhale, and a drawn-out cry. Harry pictures Malfoy’s face, the way his back is probably arching off of the bed, the way the muscles of his stomach are probably contracting. The way his finger looks plunging into his own body as he jacks himself off. Harry can hear the sound of Malfoy’s hand, and his own hand moves faster and faster.
“We should…” Draco says and Harry shakes his head.
“I mean it, Malfoy, I’m not sure how good my control is.”
“No, it’s whiskey,” he says and holds out the glass. “It’s Macallan. It’s nice.”
is on Potter’s good side.
Gasping, ears ringing, Harry collapses onto Draco, who doesn’t seem to mind the mess Harry’s just made of him, nor the weight of him. Draco just pulls him close, running his hands up and down Harry’s back as he whispers. It takes Harry a few moments to come down from his high before he realizes what Draco is saying.
Draco gets himself into position and pushes in slowly.
Malfoy sighs. “Neville said there’s a clearing about a two hours’ walk on the path, and he thinks it’s pretty likely there’ll be moonflowers there. They only bloom on the full moon, in full moonlight, so we’re in luck.”
“Was she at the party?”
“I think that chunk landed right next to me and then fell over onto me when, err, I sat down suddenly. Didn’t hit me directly.”
Harry pauses. “Truth,” he says finally, heart rate starting to rise in anticipation. “I’ll take Truth.”
The paper rustles a bit and then Harry hears, “Lies, Potter. Calumny and lies.”
, Draco, fuck, you’re making me…” and his back arches as his release spatters across his taut abs, and Draco thinks Harry’s face as he comes is the closest thing he’s seen to perfection in this world.
It’s still new, this thing between them, so much still unspoken. Draco has no idea what they’re doing, only knows that he likes it, doesn’t want to stop. That doesn’t mean he wants to get caught receiving a blow job at his desk. In the Ministry of Magic, where he fucking
“Me too,” Harry says softly.
Hermione stares at him, aghast.
“I love you,” Harry says quietly, and brings Draco’s hand up to kiss his fingers, one by one. “Always and forever.”
“Hmmm,” Madame Pomfrey says, and then something shifts in her expression so that she looks first almost thunderstruck, and then very, very knowing in a way that makes Draco squirm uncomfortably. “Alright then, carry on.”
Draco rolls his eyes, grabs Harry’s hand, and pulls him down the sidewalk towards the apparition point that’s around the corner.
Ron and Hermione bundle him out of his room and down the stairs, then up to the Owlery, where Harry pens a quick note, dictated by Hermione.
“I don’t want you to feel rushed into anything.” Harry feels compelled to point out, even though the sound of Draco saying words about having sex with him has him very, very, interested. “I mean, would we be doing this if we weren’t here?”
Draco had inquired, just out of curiosity, fairly early on if that might be something Harry was interested in and he’ll never forget the way Harry had paused, and then looked at him, so direct and open, it had taken Draco’s breath away.
“No,” Harry says, dazed by the way Draco’s touching him. “I don’t. I just. I don’t want to do this just to not have boils. I want it to…” He pauses. “I need it to mean something, Draco. Something more.”
Harry reaches up, presses his hand over Draco’s and finally looks at him. Their eyes meet and hold, and Harry can feel it between them, that same electric spark. Draco’s face is raw and open, and Harry thinks again of that kiss, the way Draco had gasped and opened for him.
Draco had only nodded, having read about in the
“I think I ruined the moment,” he says glumly, fully prepared to walk Draco to the closest apparition point, then immediately quit his job and move to Southern Australia so they’ll never have to speak of this again.
Harry takes a deep breath and all of a sudden his hands feel three times their normal size and he doesn’t know what to do with them. Should he reach up to touch Draco’s face? Maybe tilt Draco’s head to one side? Nibble gently on his lips? All of a sudden, Harry wonders if he’s ever successfully kissed anyone in his life.
Draco pulls an offended face and casts a quick tempus to keep up the ruse. “With all due respect, Madame Pomfrey,” he says, “I’m not lurking. I just happened to be passing by, that’s all. Simply coincidence.”
Draco sighs. He really doesn’t want to get up and face the day, and once more silently hexes the Head of Household status magic that requires these rituals of him, but if he doesn’t complete them, his ties to the Malfoy estates all over the world weaken, and the wards close against not only him, but his mother as well. So twice a year, Draco takes the time away from his shop and his potions to come back, to walk the house and the lands, to cast the magic that binds him to this place, even though it’s not his home anymore, and never will be again. He does it for his mother. Because he loves her, and because it’s what she needs.
Harry feels a sense of something rising in him, something wild and unfamiliar, and he realizes, it feels like—
He’s quite sure he’s just about to get up and change that, when the door opens, and who should come wandering in but Draco Malfoy.
Harry is torn between wanting Draco to come in his mouth and wanting to see, but the desire for the latter wins out, so as Draco gives a frantic moan and an involuntary thrust of hips and cries out, “Fuck, Harry, I’m coming…”, Harry pulls off and gives Draco one last firm tug and watches Draco fall apart.
Draco comes even closer, hands outstretched.
“These too,” he says softly.
“Fine,” Malfoy says, sounding profoundly blasé, as if he hasn’t just shaken Harry’s world to the core with the hope that maybe, finally, they’ll move through this impasse. “Just so you know, Potter, I don’t put out on the first date.”
Draco gives a wordless cry as Harry begins to jerk him off, slow and steady to start. He’s so hard as Harry touches him, and Harry catalogs every gasp, every shift of Draco’s body, what makes him moan and shudder, and it’s the hottest moment of Harry’s life. Draco gives a half-laugh/half-sob when Harry mutters this in his ear.
Draco shuts the door behind him. It’s late, and the night is quiet and so dark. As Draco crests over the rise of the land and walks downhill towards the road, the lights of the Manor disappear behind him. It’s so clear tonight, and the glow of the full moon means he has no need for a Lumos just yet. He casts the incantation with one hand and jams the other in his pocket. With his wand trailing the gold and silver sparks of the spell, he walks.
, he thinks, of Draco Malfoy to act as he’s the one who’s been wronged. As if he’s the one who’d been left behind. He whirls around as the music ends and he sees Draco stand up, take a step towards him.
And Harry hasn’t been back since.
“That doesn’t sound fun, though,” Harry says grumpily and he feels Malfoy shrug.
Draco wanders out into the dark, flanked by Ron and Hermione. There’s discussion about who is going where that he ignores, staring up into the dark of the night sky.
“Come on me,” Harry whispers and licks his lip. “Do it, Draco, come on. Come on my face,” and Draco feels it, the way his balls tighten and his whole body shudders and then he’s coming, as hard as he’s ever come in his life, watching the way his release spatters across Harry’s lips and cheeks, watching the way Harry’s tongue darts out to taste him.
“So, uh…” he starts but cannot, for the life of him, think of how to finish that sentence as Malfoy, still holding his hand, draws him down the corridor.
“I have an idea,” Draco says, sounding almost drunk. “Fuck, hold on, you gotta hold on, Harry, or I’m gonna come.”
He looks up to see Potter watching him thoughtfully and thinks over what he’s just said.
“I mean, I’m a virgin, so it’s me the thing is after.”
, things like
. I mean, we need to
Harry swallows. This is really not how he’s imagined getting close and cozy with Malfoy, which is something he’s actually imagined rather a lot. He sighs and carefully climbs around Malfoy, and sits.
Malfoy’s eyes meet Harry’s.
It begins, as many Saturday nights do, with an informal party in the 8th year common room. It ends with Harry running for his life through the Forbidden Forest, which is decidedly less typical these days.
Malfoy takes another sip of his drink.
Draco shifts, rolling onto his back and pulling Harry over with him, so he can wrap his arms around him. “We are really spectacularly good at that, I’ll have you know.”
Finally, with a gasp, the kiss gentles, and then Harry pulls back a bit, leaning in to press a kiss to his husband’s forehead. “Don’t fucking do that again, Draco. You scared me.”
“I do,” Harry whispers, heart in his throat. “I really do.”
“Nice of you all to drop by,” Draco calls out. “Want to clean this mess up?”
“Now,” Ron says with great satisfaction, “You need a shower, and then we need to celebrate.”
Malfoy stops by the table where the others are working and says something quietly to Hermione, who just stops what she’s doing, looks at him for a long moment, and then nods. Malfoy returns it, and then they’re out the door, walking quickly down the wide stone steps.
Draco moves in, and Harry’s heart starts to race. This isn’t impulse, this is slow and deliberate. Draco’s eyes are locked on Harry’s and suddenly, Harry knows, it’s all going to be different from this moment. This is going to change everything. Draco’s hand comes up to curve around his cheek, and when Draco skims his thumb across Harry’s lips, he leaves sparks skittering in his wake. Then he closes the gap and presses his mouth to Harry’s.
“What?” he hears Potter say in confusion. “Hey, Malfoy, what is it?”
He freezes when Harry places one hand on his chest, gently holding him back.
“Fine,” he says after a moment and straightens up, “All good here.”
“Move up,” Harry whispers, and Draco is helpless to do anything but comply.
Also, Malfoy had said his name. So there’s that.
Harry blinks slowly and turns his head to look at Draco.
Something bitter flashes across his face but the expression is gone before Harry can really make sense of it.
And then Draco fastens his mouth onto one of Harry’s nipples, tongue flicking even as he presses down firmly on Harry’s achingly hard cock, through the denim of Harry’s jeans, and Harry’s hips snap up as his back arches and he
“No,” Draco murmurs, so close now that Harry can feel the heat of him, so close that it wouldn’t take anything at all to end the distance between them, just a slight shifting of his body. Harry holds still.
an erogenous zone. He yanks Malfoy even closer, and Malfoy returns the favor by planting both hands firmly on Harry’s ass and squeezing.
Without thinking, Draco says, “But no way to have a wank.”
Harry had taken his hand, smiled. “I know that, you idiot. That’s why. Because this matters.” He’d looked suddenly hesitant. “Because you’re important.”
Harry coughs. “Err, yeah. Sounds good.”
“Love you too, you daft bastard,” Harry mutters. “Now go to sleep.”
There will be chocolate cake for dessert because it’s something you love
Ron walks over to them, gives them a quick once over, and he doesn’t miss a thing, sees the way they’re clinging to each other, the way they’re holding on tight.
“Long day,” he says and Keely nods from the stove.
He’s sitting directly across the circle from Malfoy. Not that it matters. But he is.
With the sounds of your family and the smells of dinner and you know
Harry makes a noise of protest and snuggles even closer. “In a minute,” he whispers, almost asleep now. “Just give me a minute.”
. In spite of everything, Harry’s own cock starts to get interested in the proceedings and Harry can’t quite stifle a groan.
They stare at each other for a moment. Harry manages to extract his arms from the cocoon of blankets he’s created for himself, and wraps them around Draco to pull him close as they settle back amongst the pillows.
Harry’s eyes widen under the cloak and he tries not to make a sound as he watches what Draco is doing, because Draco is. Well, he’s taking off his clothes, there’s really no other explanation. He’s stripping down, carefully folding his clothes up and setting them neatly at the foot of his bed, the priss.
“Do you agree to be bound by the consequences if you should forfeit the Dare?”
, Harry thinks a bit resentfully. He gets offers all the time. He gets notes slipped into his pockets in the hallways, owls at breakfast, whispered invitations at tea, and on more than one notable occasion, howlers. He’s really not sure why people think that’ll be successful, but it’s happened enough that they’ve had to increase the wards around Hogwarts to divert them.
“I can’t believe you, Harry,” Draco says, still laughing. “Did you really have to…” and then he freezes before turning slowly to look warily back at Harry.
By now he and Malfoy have drawn up next to the forest, and by unspoken agreement, they both stop. Harry bites his lip and sighs.
“Harry,” Draco hisses. “Harry, you have to stop, the door is still open,” and Harry just gives him a cheeky grin, waves his hand, and the door swings shut.
He comes in and sees you at the mirror and he laughs
Which brings them to now. Harry had opened the door, pulled Draco in. He’d barely shut the door behind him before Harry had been yanking at Draco’s clothes. They’d almost met disaster as Harry had tried to remove Draco’s trousers while leading him up the stairs by his tie, but they’d sorted it out.
Draco leans over and just before he pulls Harry’s hand off of his cock and replaces it with his mouth, he whispers, “Might even be good.”
Harry starts to nod and then stares down at the blades protruding from the ends of his arms in horror.
“Harry.”
Then, Draco says, “You might want to lean back and enjoy the ride.” As he settles his body back onto Harry’s lap and crosses his legs, he tosses Harry a self-satisfied smirk over his shoulder. “Don’t fucking let me fall out of this tree, Potter, at least not before I come,” and Harry can’t help the bark of laughter that’s yanked out of him even as he registers the unbelievable feeling of Draco’s legs closing around the sensitive head of his cock.
Harry looks a little dazed and his hands slide around to grab Draco’s ass and pull him into a grind that’s downright filthy. They move together, the mattress creaking under them until Draco suddenly freezes, rolls himself off Harry, panting, and presses one hand hard to his dick.
“Oh no,” Harry murmurs into Draco’s chest, sounding sleepy now. He manages to wave a hand, and the candles go out. “Whatever shall I do about that?”
Potter snickers. “I’ll have to tell them that’s what you called them. Of course, they don’t seem to have done much of a job of protecting me, since here you are.”
Written for the @drarrymicrofic prompt from July 16 (yeah I know, I’ve been caught up on other things) - “Curious”. Since @the-starryknight proposed this, I’ll say thank you to them as well, as this moment just sort of sprang fully-formed into my head. I’ll also thank @kingsofeverything and @tackytigerfic for the writing tags!!
grace is unending and love,
“What are you doing here?” Potter sounds more resigned than thrilled.
He turns and follows the road. No words are needed now for this magic; it simply requires presence and intention. Draco intends to care for this land, this Manor, even if he can’t live here. As he walks, he thinks.
And with that, Harry heads upstairs and Draco bundles up to go walk the property lines. Thankfully the house elves have their own magic and have cleared the path for him, so all he has to do is walk down the long driveway and turn left when he gets to the road.
Harry nods as Draco’s meaning becomes clear.
“Well,” Harry grins, bites his lip, and looks flirtatiously up at Draco through his ridiculously long, inky lashes. “Maybe I’ve thought about you.”
Harry is well aware that he should feel
. Yes. I… I see your point.” He looks almost shy for a moment. “Do you want to… come back to mine?”
Harry groans as Draco’s mouth touches him, and Draco loses himself in the taste of Harry’s skin under his tongue. He nips and licks and presses hot, wet, open-mouthed kisses, working his way higher and higher until he can’t scrunch up the fabric anymore. Harry has slid down on the lounge chair and Draco can see the sizable bulge he’s sporting as he pants.
He leans in, tangles his fingers in Draco’s hair, pulls him close, and kisses him with everything he’s feeling, everything he wants to say but can’t. Harry kisses Draco with gratitude that they’re not dead, with satisfaction at the pleasure they’ve just shared, and with hope that this isn’t the end of this moment, but that maybe, just maybe. It can be a beginning.
“No,” Draco says. “It’ll be fine.”
He watches as Ron chooses Truth and has to disclose the subject of his most recent wet dream (Madame Pomfrey in full uniform, which has most of the room groaning and Hermione giving Ron a thoughtful look that Harry really does not want to understand). Luna chooses Dare and has to kiss Neville, which she does, so thoroughly that Harry wonders if they’ll be able to continue the game. It wouldn’t be the first time a pair has had to leave, but no, Neville collapses onto his back, chest heaving and Luna settles back in her spot, looking extremely pleased with herself.
,” Harry says and Malfoy laughs.
Finally, Harry’s breathing calms enough that he can lift his head to look at Draco. They smile foolishly at each other.
Harry thinks and sighs, remembering when Theo had gotten that consequence and how really, truly offensive the BO had been. “No, I do not forfeit, I’ll answer the Truth. The last time I got off with another person was, err…” he sighs heavily and can feel his face flushing, “never. I never have.”
Harry looks at him and then nods. “You?”
“You need to take me to him,” Draco shouts.
Hermione tugs Draco towards the door and pauses to wind his scarf around his neck and tug a hat down over his ears.
Ron Weasley, Draco’s favourite ginger (except for the rest of them, of course), takes another sip of Draco’s whiskey and sets the glass down on the table. He gives Draco a squeeze and tugs him towards the edge of the bench.
“It’s just that when I’ve been with people in the past, they’ve always just expected. You know? I can’t remember the last time someone asked me what I wanted. They just assume I’m going to top.”
Draco looks at him closely but Potter just gives him a small smile, and Draco shrugs.
“I don’t!” Harry says loudly.
Draco stares at the T Rex, eyes narrowed as he thinks through the implications. Harry had
And your name on his lips is a benediction
“Fuck,” Draco whispers, “Do you really… is that what you want?”
“I love you,” he whispers into Harry’s dark curls and Harry’s grip on him tightens. “Like, a lot.”
Draco shrugs. “Tonight? Probably not. Eventually? Absolutely. In any case, that’s really not relevant, because we
Familiar face in a familiar place, surrounded by light
Suddenly, Draco arches back and gives a deep moan, and Harry feels Draco’s whole body shudder, feels the hot spatter of his release as Draco comes, and somehow that’s enough to get him there, and he cries out, too overwhelmed to be embarrassed at how loud he is, as he thrusts up one last time and comes.
“He’ll be here soon,” Ron says and heads to the door.
“What? Why are you stopping?”
“I know,” Harry says hastily. “It wasn’t my best work. I can do better.”
Draco gasps, his breath ragged. She’s right, of course. The price for that kind of magic is steep, and there’s no way Harry — brave, beautiful, steadfast Harry  — would ever consent to that. Not even to save his own life, Draco knows.
“Me too,” is all Harry says and for another long moment, they just smile foolishly at each other.
“Fuck,” Harry hears Malfoy say. “I’m picturing you here with me. Your hands on me.”
And, like many a Saturday night, as the evening progresses, they turn to the Hogwarts version of Truth or Dare. Harry’s not entirely sure why they even bother anymore. The current seventh and eighth years are a pretty enmeshed group at this point, and he’s not sure how much more they really need to know of one another, but it can get pretty amusing.
Finally, Malfoy comes out. He’s changed into comfortable grey joggers and a giant blue hoodie, and has a black beanie shoved onto his head. He’s got a knapsack similar to Harry’s, and he looks, well, delicious, Harry thinks. But also concerned.
At first, the trees are sparse enough that the moonlight can light their way, but that soon shifts.
This moment, it feels monumental, as if the words he’s about to say mean so much more than just this moment.
Malfoy is groaning now as he describes what he’s doing to himself, and Harry takes advantage of the noise to ruck up his shirt and undo his trousers and shove them down. Just to get more comfortable, he assures himself. That’s it.
Harry stares at him, looks at Hermione who just nods, eyes shining. He takes a deep breath, then reaches up and takes Ron’s hand, lets himself be pulled to standing. “Yeah. Let’s go.”
Draco breathes in again through his nose, out through the mouth, as Luna instructs them to do in yoga class. It seems to help, so he does it again.
Harry slams back the shot and winces at the taste, wiping his mouth. He’s in the common room of the 8th Year Tower, surrounded by his friends, and for the first time, he feels something like hope beyond the heartache. Neville cranks up the stereo, Seamus pours another round of shots, and Luna is off by the window, carefully draping something that looks suspiciously like a rainbow feather boa around the window frame.
Draco opens the bottle and slicks up his fingers. “I’m just approaching your arse with the reverence it deserves. A work of art, Potter. Truly.”
Draco kisses him.

“We’ve got a date, Potter. And you’re buying. I’m going to need the fancy naan after today.”
of a man under his desk leans in again, and closes his mouth around the tip of Draco’s achingly hard cock. Just the tip, sucking gently, and his hand moves so slowly, and the door opens.
Draco smiles as Harry makes a face at the first sip, the same as he always does because he hates the herbal taste, but it’s all part of the ritual and tradition. They sip in silence and finally, Draco sets down his cup and stands up.
“Harry?” Draco asks nervously.
Ron raps on the frame of the open door and sticks his head into the room, taking in the sight of Harry lying face down, starfished across his bed.
Draco runs his hand over the bare skin of Harry’s calf. “No one’s ever called me pretty before,” he says thoughtfully, and leans over to dart his tongue into the crease where Harry’s knee is bent, enjoying the way Harry shudders. “I think I like it.”
Malfoy shrugs disinterestedly. “You just said you were thinking something. It’s a rare event, so of course, I took note.”
A task, a place to be as you work together to light your home.
Now they find their rhythm. Someone groans, long and low, and Harry realizes it’s him, realizes it when his lips part and Draco’s tongue finds his, generating a spark that flows from Harry’s mouth down his spine. Harry brings his other hand up and pulls off Draco’s beanie, wraps his hand around Draco’s head, pulls him closer, Draco’s hair silky beneath his fingers. The kiss shifts and there it is, the heat Harry’s always known lies between them, and that spark turns to flame.
Potter looks baffled. “My who?”
“It’s not that,” Potter whispers, and Draco’s near enough now to feel the heat of Potter’s body so close to his own. “It’s more, oh god, Draco,” and then his mouth is on Draco’s and it’s like an avalanche of need has been unleashed in Draco’s heart.
Draco’s not too proud to admit that he flees the scene, shoulders hunched and ears burning. As he makes his strategic retreat, he starts to plot, thinking about what he’s just learned.
Huge shoutout to the nsfw chat on the drarry microfic discord for helping me through the socks and shoes issue!
“No,” Malfoy says thoughtfully, “They really don’t. So odd, too. Most criminals are thrilled when we show up at their secret lair.”
Harry’s orgasm hits him, inexorable and unstoppable. It rips through him like a tidal wave, turns him inside out with the force of it, his entire body shuddering as he gasps, until finally, he drops back onto his pillows, chest heaving.
“Eloquent as always, Potter.”
“Yeah, like that,” he hears Malfoy breathe. “Then you cast your Lubrico,” and Harry hears him mutter the charm. “Wrap your hand around my cock, just like that.”
“I know.
Harry was right. He hates it.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry whispers and presses down again. “You have no fucking idea.”
“Why would a unicorn be chasing us?” Harry says as they pound down the path. “I thought they were friendly? Especially to…” He shuts up, wondering how much more awkward it can get.
“I agree.”
anything, Hermione.
That’s another thing that’s held no interest for Harry. He wanks occasionally, usually just to manage his morning wood, and it almost always feels fairly perfunctory. Kind of bland. He gets off and it’s fine. But this is the first time in so long that he’s felt… excited. That it’s to Malfoy’s naked body is somewhat curious but not, Harry has to acknowledge, really all that surprising.
“What,” Harry asks, hand moving faster now. “You gotta tell me what you want, Draco,
Ron’s face goes serious. “Yeah, mate. Ugly magic. C’mon, you have to actually present the flower to the bottle.”
This was not how Harry had expected the evening to go.
“One, two, three, four, five and that’s six,” Malfoy says with a grunt, levitating the last of his bounty into a pile.
Slowly, he and Draco separate, pull their clothes together, and look at each other.
Harry just nods and follows Draco down the tree. Once they’re on the ground, he’s able to
Draco shakes his head. “They’re a bit more flexible in America. But it’s been a long time.”
And that’s saying a lot because Draco had his gay awakening by walking in on Blaise Zabini masturbating in the Slytherin showers.
