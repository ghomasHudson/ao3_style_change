“The water as it stands has several purposes, and all of those purposes rely on its existence or its ability to remain still. The water is a path that many variables use, and when divining with water, it is up to us to bring the force that will change its course.”
The sound of Blaise yelling almost distracted him, but he didn’t care, couldn’t care, not when the answer was right out of his grasp, just out of his reach.
“You’ll see me again.” Draco leaned down to press a kiss to Harry’s bottom lip before he took flight.
“You,” Harry said, abandoning Scrimgeour, letting one of the Dementors take him instead. “What’s your name?”
A satisfied hum left Potter. “Which is why predicting the future is so difficult. You were just one variable among hundreds of others. If I had gone in with the intent to amend for variables, I think I could have had a general idea of my day, but nothing is ever set in stone.”
has many different variations and forms, and I am going to teach you one of the more well-known methods today.”
I didn’t have a backup plan. I’m not like you, Harry. I didn’t have the money to leave my job and hope for something else. I thought I could handle it.”
“It’s not the same,” Potter continued, a small frown in place. “I always thought I could feel his Horcruxes so strongly because of the connection, but the pull of that magic was so similar.”
“Badge will expire in an hour, if you need more time, any Ministry employee can renew it. Enjoy your stay.”
The man titled his head, eyes roaming over Harry’s face to the two Dementors floating nearby before squinting at him.
When Minerva left to get Dumbledore, and Snape was left pointing a wand at Moody, Harry knew they didn’t have much time.
When Draco made it to his shop, he slammed the door behind him, not bothering to turn over the closed sign.
It was obvious by the way Potter’s stupid face scrunched up that he didn’t get it. Some Auror he was.
Harry lifted his head when it looked like Malfoy might come but instead, Malfoy’s fingers were removed.
Harry’s eyes closed briefly. “I’m sorry. You don’t always say it back and that hurts. I thought you didn’t want me to say it. I thought—”
Draco closed his eyes tightly at the desperation he could hear. The earnest innocence hurt, and he couldn’t imagine having lost someone so young.
Draco reluctantly had to agree. Potter was a walking wet dream. He looked over to the head the Ravenclaw table where Harry was talking animatedly with Lovegood. By his wildly moving hands, it was about something that Harry was rather passionate about.
Time passed the longer Draco sat there, his legs cramped as he alternated his position, but he couldn’t change it, couldn’t get up and leave. If there was a breakthrough, he wanted to be in his studio for it.
“There isn’t enough room for you—Oi!—get your bony arse on your own damn chair—Harry I swear if you don’t—”
“I don’t.” Malfoy began to pet Bandit and a small purr could be heard. “Could be both or neither for all I know.”
“Merlin,” Draco whispered, fingers coming up to poke the air near his face. Harry knew it was his aura.
“Don’t tell me you don’t have one.” His eyes were pleading and so sad. If Draco had a heart, it would have hurt to see.
“I’m not condoning, I’m just saying the magical signature is so subtle that it would be hard for Aurors to track for sure.”
The Dark Mark wasn’t just ugly in appearance, but ugly in the residue, ugly in the way it stained not just the skin but their whole core.
“Don’t offer what you can’t promise,” Draco whispered as Potter sucked a mark into his neck. He wanted to say more, wanted to demand more but with each swipe of a tongue against his skin the further his mind slipped and all that remained was Potter—just Potter.
“Of my what?” Draco asked, tone as dangerous as he could make it. He watched Longbottom shift uncomfortably and a few others sniff the air before turning toward him in alarm.
Part of him wanted to point out that he should be telling his partner that instead, but Draco was selfish and wanted to be the person Harry relied on.
“Yeah, but they don’t get any now,” Ron argued as he pulled Blaise with him into the back room. “They are ungrateful pricks.”
“More than I should.” He wasn’t sure if the honesty was the alcohol or Potter’s presence. “I like being alone while I work, but without something to focus on, my mind is pretty loud, you know? Far louder than my empty flat.”
“Not only have Wizards always held a superiority complex, they’ve also never changed or adapted. None of you have. It’s the same ancient practices since the beginning of time. Non-wielders on the other hand have done nothing
It seemed Potter was waiting for a response, still immobile. The sight was ridiculous. Draco pulled the shirt too hard and it knocked Potter’s glasses half off, one side still in place.
Tiny. Harry hummed, eyes following Luna’s as she stared at nothing. Strings of Magic were visible, but he had chalked that up to Hogwarts since there were strings of Magic
Sirius was weary, older beyond his years and just tired. Less wrinkles in areas than Lupin, but more worry lines than someone of his age. Sirius’ hair was long, a bit matted and sprinkled with many grey strands.
“Speak for yourself,” Draco scoffed. “I deal in nothing but upstanding and legitimate transactions.”
If that was the case, then Potter was never going to be able to feel it. There was no way in hell he’d teach Potter how to do Life Magic.
“I love you for that, you know,” he whispered as soon as they were out of earshot. “I was almost about to fall asleep.”
“He wouldn’t have happened to have mentioned what it is supposed to be, did he?” wondered Blaise as he shot a dubious look at the glass object.
.” Draco scooted away as the vulnerability of the conversation got too much, but Potter moved with him, and he wasn’t sure if he was comforted by that or not.
If that was his reward, then Draco didn’t mind one bit. He winced as there was no smooth glide and only a rough chafe. “Do you have lube?”
That had always been something he had wanted to do as a kid. Soul bonds were permanent, irreversible, and sometimes deadly. He had never been quite Gryffindor enough to take the plunge. Draco wondered if that had changed over the years.
“I thought maybe you could save me,” Malfoy whispered, and his voice was choked. “I knew he liked you, I could see it in his eyes when he spoke of you. He had never looked at me like that. I thought maybe if I explained to you how much he meant to me that you’d leave us be. I finally had someone who didn’t care that I was a Death Eater, someone that didn’t care how tarnished I was. I thought that maybe you could save my failing relationship if you just walked away. I just wanted to talk.”
“Revenge was always a what if, a thought when I couldn’t sleep, and my mind wandered. A fantasy in the shower when I couldn’t focus. It was just a half-formed idea that I never thought would happen. But then you came along and suddenly it stopped being a what-if.”
He could tell he made a mistake the moment the words came out. Potter’s demeanour changed. It went from tense to aggressive in a flash.
“Ick,” Ron covered his stomach with his hands and his face twisted in disgust. “Flirt somewhere else.”
It was Harry’s turn to arch his brows. “I’d tell you but it’s part of an ongoing investigation. I can’t divulge confidential matters, I’m
Draco rolled his eyes as he ignored the way Harry tensed. “Your skills in stupidity far outmatch mine, you should be proud.”
Draco narrowed his eyes as Andrew Baxter, famed defense attorney, stepped out of the shadows and into the light of the dimly lit alleyway. This wasn’t completely unexpected, Baxter was good at his job, but spent too much money on a lifestyle he couldn’t afford. If the man was taking payoffs to get his clients off, then this wouldn’t be surprising. The man
His Magic followed the imitation of his hand as the statues of the Wizards exploded outward, screams and chaos ensued.
“Paintings actually began as traps. It was a way to observe one’s enemy without them knowing. In the beginning it was a mixture of illusions combined with the paintings. The art wasn’t complete, but the illusions made it appear so, which meant less work for them but shoddy spellcasting in the long run.”
a waxy oil spell that he used when making candles. That would have to do. It was preferable to a dry hand.
Harry reached a hand down to fondle his balls, mouth parting at the sensation as his hand tightened around his cock. He wasn’t sure he’d last long, not with how worked up he was. When his mind not only pictured Malfoy’s smell but the man himself, Harry knew he wasn’t going last long
Heat. He could feel his cheeks heat up and the way it made the bartender grin just had him flushing harder.
Harry flopped on his sofa as he tried to prepare himself for tomorrow. He didn’t want to go. Being around Ron and Hermione had been bad enough, he couldn’t imagine the entire fucking Ministry. Maybe Ron was right, maybe he could talk Ashwood into letting him work more from home.
Blaise looked around, as if expecting Pansy or Draco to say something, but no one did. “I don’t mean to be rude—”
“No,” Harry argued. “I found what kind of person you are. I found you in ways I didn’t expect, not physically but I still found you—found
“No,” Lucius said, head shaking rapidly. “There’s no way. No room for him. Not happening. Absolutely not.”
“That’s because the majority of wizard society preaches the horrors of Dark Magic. How can you get a different viewpoint if that’s the only point of view you’re able to see?”
When the lift opened on his floor, Harry ignored the glares as he stepped off. The relief of being away from too many people was short-lived, as the hallway to his department had even more people running around.
“I figure the scarf can be something you use after we have sex. It can be the focus your Healer wanted. Someone stinks, place it over your nose and smell me.”
Despite the fact that he flooed in, Draco nodded quickly, not wanting to pass up a single moment. There was a silence that settled between them and he was loath to break it, but Draco wanted to explain some of his behaviour away. Wanted to bring up his ex-boyfriend.
Draco laughed before jumping up and wrapping his legs around Harry’s waist. “Good.” Killing had been his job in the past after all. One he kind of missed.
“It’s too late for that,” Luna said, eyes still locked on his. “We both know you are invested, and not just your mind, Harry.”
This time it wasn’t love that was the issue. It was the crippling self-doubt that his ex-boyfriend had managed to bring forward. Everything about who Draco was as a person had suddenly come under attack. He knew deep in his heart that it was just the heat of the moment, but how do you block out the hurt that won’t leave? Is there a way to kick out the parts that don’t belong? Charge rent or just evacuate the negativity?
“Worse than I thought,” Longbottom mumbled, and Draco got the impression he was talking to himself. “If that was your best attempt, I don’t think I want to hear about any others.”
“I’m not bothered,” Malfoy said, an amused quirk to his lips when Harry touched his hair again. “You like it?”
Draco watched Scorpius try and fail at suppressing an amused smile. “Why do I subject myself to this? I
“I don’t think I could even if I wanted to,” Harry admitted. The damn Mark refused to leave. The Mark was still moving rapidly at a pace that Harry was having a hard time tracking. Souls didn’t do that. Sometimes, a soul wanted to stay but it wasn’t the same. They didn’t dig into his body; they didn’t burrow further.
I hope you liked this week's update and I really love how much y'all are liking this story. Means a lot to me. And as always, I'll see you next time!
Look at me coming through with an update two weeks in a row. Let's hope my motivation continues to allow me that. Nothing worse than wanting to write but not being able to, having no motivation at all.
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked in an attempt to change the subject. The last time Potter started in on everything wrong with the government, three hours had passed and so did Draco’s plans to get drunk and break in his new dildo.
A puff of air had his hands twitching and he just wanted Malfoy’s mouth on him. Frustration mounted the longer Malfoy toyed with him.
“You look dashing,” Draco said, eyes bright as he pushed Lucius to the side to pull Harry into his arms. “I knew purple was your colour.”
“It’s my fault,” Harry whispered from his new position on Draco’s lap. “I added too much magic and the normal weather issues have been magnified.”
This was another anonymous prompt. "I don't know if this is still open, but could you do a drarry fluffy fic where Harry and Draco are not in a secret relationship but everyone thinks that they are?"
“There are dozens of ways to kill someone that leaves the soul intact. The Killing Curse doesn’t just kill the person it hits, it kills the soul too. What’s the point? What did the soul do to deserve that?”
Harry’s nose scrunched as he looked at Lucius’ offered arm. “I’d rather off myself.” Their usual insults trading back and forth.
“Have kids, they said. It’ll be fun, they said,” Lucius mumbled under his breath, ignoring Draco’s dark look.
Harry laughed at the same time the buzzing rose in pitch. “Do you want to eat the same thing every day for the rest of your life?”
When he was met with an eye roll, it distracted him. Was it normal for someone to have such a pretty shade of blue eyes—pale, so pale that they appeared grey?
He said nothing, unsure if it was because part of him wanted to believe Neville or if he just didn’t have anything good to refute it with.
“Aren’t you supposed to be in there?” Draco jerked his thumb behind him, not bothering to glance at the wall. “You
“But—” All thoughts left as Malfoy sunk down and he moaned loud and long at finally getting what he wanted.
“I’m not—we’re not—it’s—” Harry let out a frustrated sigh. He knew what he felt but couldn’t articulate it into words.
When Malfoy shut the fridge with a grimace and settled on toast, Harry pushed away from the table and caged him against the wall.
“When was I supposed to come first?” Draco asked, voice breaking. “When was I supposed to matter? When was I supposed to be more than an afterthought?”
When Malfoy tried to move past him, Harry pushed back until Malfoy was pressed against the wall and caged between a hand on each side of his head.
“No,” Harry admitted slowly, eyes on the way the woman didn’t hesitate to pull out her wand. “And I’m beginning to think they don’t know either.”
“Azkaban?” Harry asked, an impatient hand gesturing for more. “What does he have to do with Azkaban?” He tried to search his memories, but the Dementors didn’t know the prisoners’ names.
The girth of the dildo was nice, it made him want to sit back and ride it. Perhaps another time. The image of getting himself off by riding the dildo while Draco was asleep caused another groan, only this one deeper instead of loud.
“You still have my gratitude,” Malfoy whispered as he pushed off the wall and turned towards his door. One of his wings lightly touched Harry’s face, as if it were a caress and Harry wanted to hold onto it and never let go.
When Malfoy lifted his legs to wrap around the pole and he simultaneously dropped backward, hands grabbing hold underneath him in an upside down position, Harry’s mind blanked. Malfoy’s hands remained firm, but his legs began to extend downward, towards his head.
Each new day brought in new trinkets and Harry wished he could meet whoever left them behind. Fairy still seemed a bit outlandish to him, but after the glitter, was there really any other options?
Rolled eyes and pinched brows was not an attractive look, and Harry wanted to say that too. “How am I supposed to know what you mean?”
Well, it was better than nothing. Draco gathered Sirius’ possessions and placed them in a magically enlarged pocket of his robes before he hurried after Potter.
Lupin smiled for the first time since the memory began and it transformed his face as his eyes shone as he looked at Sirius.
“Can we just talk about it again?” Neville asked, hands grabbing at the ends of his hair. “I’ll feel better about it all.”
It was a prison, but not just for the inmates. Azkaban was a way for the Ministry to control Dementors.
Malfoy’s eyes were cold and familiar. They could talk about it later; he wasn’t done with the discussion
Ron held the gaze before he took a deep breath. “Last page. Her information is there, but you didn’t get it from me.”
“Erm,” Harry’s fingers tapped against the library table, lost in thought. “I don’t know, different sentiments?”
Draco picked at the hole in the wood that had formed from when he had placed the runes all those months ago. It had decayed, just like he thought it would. Only Potter wasn’t there for him to rub it in.
“I like Professor Potter!” Pearson, a student near the back said as he clapped his hands once. “He’s really cool.”
“Tell me,” Draco said as he trailed the dagger up Lorian’s cheek, not enough pressure to cut but enough to leave fear in its wake.
“Not to interrupt or anything,” Brown said louder than necessary. “But if I’m going to help you, I’ll need to get in touch with some contacts. Do you mind if Declan and Nayden stay here for a few hours? I don’t trust anyone else.”
Oh. Callused hands gently touched his boot before they vanished, and the gentle touches went to his already swollen ankle.
“Things change when variables change,” Potter continued. “Most variables have minds of their own. Since you embody your own will, it’s difficult to predict in the context of my own future. Your choice to stop in the corridor changed my present, it changed what happened, and that can be hard to foresee.”
Potter let out a slow whistle. “What was he doing there? Those vaults have no descendants to claim the contents.”
happened around him that were hard to explain other than the obvious. Magic. What else could manifest his desires into tangible things? What else could explain the unexplainable?
The threat was familiar and almost nostalgic. As Draco stepped into the fireplace and the warm heat enveloped him, he thought about how far they all had come as friends. They had even added additions to the circle, and he was grateful for that.
Draco closed his eyes again and melted into a warm embrace as strong arms wrapped around him. He was tired again, but it was okay, he could sleep. Potter would protect him.
“No.” It was whispered pitifully, and he hated it. “I don’t want to talk about it. I just want to drink until I forget what my family is like.”
?” There was an accusation in there somewhere, but Draco didn’t care, he wasn’t bothered by it. “Snape, the one person who would fill Sirius’ character with lies.”
Draco reached into his robes and pulled out the photo he got from Kennedy. It was a little crumpled around the edges, but it matched the subject to a tee.
Harry wasn’t sure if there would ever be a way to get Voldemort’s soul out of him. None that he knew of outside of soul sucking or death. He had come to grips with the reality that he might always have it inside him. Could the body withstand two souls? He didn’t know. It wasn’t something that had been done before.
“Huh,” Luna’s brows furrowed for the barest of moments. “It’s not unheard of, but certainly nothing done recently.”
Harry would’ve liked to say that he was not, but his mind conjured images of the two of them fucking in public, eyes on them—whether it was positive or negative, it didn’t matter as long as they didn’t look away.
“No, we are exes. Draco is my ex-boyfriend.” He shot Draco a glare that he hoped was intimidating. By the smirk on his face, he figured that he hadn’t quite hit the mark. The git was enjoying it!
“I tried to be what my parents expected of me and that ended in disaster. I tried to own who I am, and I was shamed for it. I tried to accept my Veela heritage and you made me feel like I was tainted for it. I tried to be a good partner and look at how that turned out. I tried to be a good Quidditch player and you sabotaged me. If that’s not trying, then what the fuck is?”
“Ah!” Draco tried to throw Harry off of him, but his wrists were caught between a strong grasp above his head. “Quit it.”
. Every time they made skin contact, he was sure an indentation was made, was sure he’d always remember the caresses, was sure each kiss was seared into his brain.
Harry tried really hard not show his surprise but by the way Lucius folded his arms, he wasn’t so sure he succeeded. Surely, that was the first time in Lucius’ life that gratitude had ever been uttered, right?
“Harry is in the middle of all of this,” Dumbledore began, tone solemn, and Draco hated him a little bit for it—hated that Potter was used as a low blow. “Voldemort made sure of that. No matter how much you disagree with my choices, nothing can be done about it.”
Harry lifted his hips to allow his trousers to slip down. The air felt cold to his now heated skin. Part of him wanted to hide but Draco’s eyes were already on him.
Harry placed his chin in his hand as he regarded Lucius closely. If it was anyone but Lucius, he’d have taken the case in a heartbeat. The Malfoy family was not one he thought of often or ever wanted to.
“No.” Never. “It lets me know he’s okay.” Whenever Potter did a spell, Draco could feel it, could tell what the spell was and how comfortable he was at the time of casting. Their connection didn’t tell him anything that Potter wouldn’t have. It just made it easier.
“He’s got a mouth on him,” A woman said as her tongue poked out and her eyes gave him a slow once over. “Draco likes that.”
The hand on his cock tightened and he couldn’t withhold a moan if he wanted to. The pace of both hands increased, and Draco’s concentration started to fail.
“If the two of you can make it work, despite being complete opposites, then I have nothing to worry about,” Ron explained, signing quickly. He hoped this would make the two of them leave quickly.
The war. An uncomfortable feeling took root and Draco wanted to back away from the conversation. That was a topic that was a hard no for him, it was still hard to talk to his mind healer about, let alone other people.
“Yes,” Draco smiled warmly. Sometimes, it surprised him how much he enjoyed feeling Potter’s magic. It was a tether, one that Draco relied on when he didn’t think he was okay.
Back in his broom closet, Harry began to hate masturbating in general. How many times would it take before he rubbed himself raw? Even with the images his mind always conjured, there was no enjoyment this time around. Not when he could still see Malfoy’s expression whenever he closed his eyes.
Emotions, fickle things that when they weren’t his own, Harry quite liked them. It was fascinating to see how quickly emotions changed with humans. Anger came in fast but quick to leave, sadness lingered far longer than he expected, laughter was a band-aid and happiness warped every other emotion.
Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s hair. “My own morality is suspect, something I don’t care about or stop to think of. But yours? Your morals are strong enough for the both us. Are you going to be okay?”
“When has Malfoy ever got off his lazy arse to hand-deliver anything? He was obviously there for you.”
“It went from a gaping pain to a dull ache, but the ache never went away. I’m not like other people, those who would have just moved on. How could I when everything I loved about him never left? Everything that I fell in love with is still a part of who he is.”
“You’re the one who likes pet-names, not me.” Draco’s eyes were still on a boring Advanced Potion’s book and he was tempted to summon it away.
That had Harry spinning around rapidly, ladle in hand and eyes narrowed dangerously. “Chimaera?!” He swept his gaze up and down his husband’s body, trying to figure out the damage.
Draco didn’t understand where it began, where it was located or how it worked. All he knew was that he could ask questions to the phone Harry gave him and it would answer back. Sometimes the lady trapped in the phone would send him to the internet to provide information or other times to a little telly inside the phone too.
A Patronus was supposed to be beautiful. Something Wizards could only conjure if they had a happy memory, a
“Well,” Ron looked at Hermione for help. When she didn’t meet his eyes, Harry snorted. “It was like he cared.”
It was sickening. His free hand clenched, it was hard to not let his anger out, hard to not fight all of them. Every last Wizard that planned the task.
“Who’s Pashkov?” Sparks asked as she began to fill out Wizengamot papers, he assumed it was to notify them that there would be an arrest.
Uncle Vernon had always called him a freak, and while Harry never understood the venom in the words or why being different was perceived as a bad thing, he was beginning to understand that his uncle had
Draco wanted to wince at the fact that these injuries happened at some kind of muggle event, but he was still caught up with his boyfriend being utterly sappy.
“So deep,” Malfoy said, voice so quiet that Harry was grateful for the silence in the room. “Like it.”
“There’s a lot you don’t know about me,” Malfoy tried to wink but he closed both eyes. Harry had to wonder if he was tipsy already.
“We’re not going to find him,” Draco warned. “Who knows how long he’s been sitting on this breakout. He’s been in Azkaban for a decade. Why now?”
to come out no matter what he did, the walls were covered in goodbye letters his past students sent him, some drawings scattered around the place and a few file cabinets that were on their last leg stuck out. But despite all that, it was
“By the time I got there, I saw the proof, saw the confirmation. Lupin was a werewolf, and not only that, he saw me too. The only thing that saved me that night was Potter.”
“No,” Harry held on tighter. He loved Hermione but he needed Ron at the moment. “Just don’t judge me.”
Draco arched his brows. “If I wanted an inaccurate version of Sirius then I would only listen to positive versions of him. What you saw, and what Severus saw
Harry huffed as he set down his quill and started rifling through his desk. “I know their stats as a team and their stats individually. I know their current line-up, their past line-up, and their records going back to the beginning, but I was talking less
“Secrets of the Darkest Arts,” Draco whispered, a finger gently tracing the spine. Not many were printed, and he’d only seen the book a few times as a kid in the library at the Manor. At least he had, before the Ministry took possession of the place.
“And what was I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you? Wait for you to love me?” Greyson looked away and Harry’s unease grew. “It’s your stupid Veela that was the problem.”
“Pardon?” He straightened up and pulled at his already pristine robes. “Why am I to blame? I’ve done nothing.”
he wanted to repeat but his mind had blanked, his hands moved at a pace that was too rapid, his lips parted and the pleasure that felt like a scream came out as a whimpered gasp of Draco’s name.
I know some of you have mentioned wanting to know more about the colours and what they all mean. The majority of them I have already said in the story itself what they were. Not necessarily at the moment he sees the colour but he does explain most of them. A few new ones were brought up in this chapter that will eventually come out. I do it this way because it flows with the story. I don't like to overexplain things and dump a bunch of information on the readers. My style is to have the readers learn things as Harry does, or learn things as the other characters do.
“I can feel it.” The look he received let him know that that wasn’t enough. “Dark Magic, George. If done correctly and in healthy amounts, we can see things others don’t notice. I told you, it gives us the ability to see things in a new light.”
“The ripples are there from the previous rocks, and they might be hard to distinguish, but we know they are there, we know how they have shaped the water, and that’s all that matters in the end, really.”
“Friendly my arse. The last time you had a ‘chat’ you sent him to St. Mungo’s where he was unconscious for
“You lost before it began,” he whispered as he ran a finger through the come on his cheek and placed it in his mouth. Not the best taste, but the way Potter’s eyes homed in on his mouth was worth it.
Harry was embarrassed to realize that he was still on top of Draco. He rushed to stand, offering a hand to help.
Harry froze as his hands fell limply by his side. That had never crossed his mind. “That’s not what happened. If I didn’t want to talk to you any more, I’d have told you so.”
When he got a nod back, it left him confused. How could the answer be sort of in the journal? What did that even mean?
Draco had always known he was different, special even. He didn’t need his parents to tell him that, because they never did.
The air shifted, and Draco suddenly didn’t want to be in the room. He knew that it was a turning point, whatever Potter said would change a lot of things, and he wasn’t sure he wanted that.
“So that’s where your low standards came from,” Ginny mumbled when she knew the Romilda was out of earshot. She rested her chin in her hands and waited to see the disaster unfold.
Less emotions and more memories when taking a soul from a dead body but who was he to turn down sustenance?
“Yeah, what else are you?” Harry whispered, grinning when Draco whined. “Come on, you haven’t said today’s.”
“You tosser,” Ginevra murmured, but her lips were quirked upward, and he didn’t think she was upset at all.
“When you became a teacher, the papers never really said what it was that you did, just that you were separate from Hogwarts.”
Hold had landed face down, and he winced a little. That had to hurt. He rolled her over before summoning ropes and tying her hands together.
“Yes,” Draco nodded, hair falling into his eyes. “With your cloak on no one will even really notice. Close enough to a robe anyway.”
Harry arched his brows at the thin paperwork before he narrowed his eyes at the guard. The man’s uniform had the name, Pashkov sewn in.
“The times are changing,” Mina whispered, as her hands mindlessly pulled open the prisoner’s folder. “I think I will too. Align myself with those who foolishly place their faith in the unknown.”
“I knew it wasn’t his job to take on a role that was never meant for him, but I couldn’t see past my own grief. At the time, I didn’t think I’d ever see Lucius again. Something else my son hasn’t forgiven me for.”
Mina frowned and she squinted her eyes at him. “I think when the free will of one contests the will of another, there have to be regulations in place otherwise there’s only chaos and no order.”
Harry wished they hadn’t. It would have made tracing Malfoy’s magic a hell of a lot easier. It would have given him a chance to see the power in the spells and even the creative design of the wards; all of which give insight into the caster.
“Why did you learn it?” Lucius asked. “I thought that sometimes Dobby would say things in another language, but he was always… odd… so I chalked it up to his eccentricities.”
It took longer than he thought it would to get there, but when they got closer, he couldn’t help but gape. The Black & Malfoy vaults were old, required higher security, and was secluded from other customer vaults. As he looked at the brigade vaults, it made his own look tiny.
“I require proof,” said Filius. “If Draco is being nice, then the end of time has come early, and we should evacuate.”
“But it’s all being wasted on Malfoy.” Draco narrowed his eyes as he clenched his fists. “What could Harry possibly see in him? Sure,
Love as strength was such a light mentality that it made him sick. But the depths of love came in layers and his were strong. Strong enough to burden the anger and embrace the pain.
“Oh?” Harry leaned away till he could see Seamus’ face. There was a pink hue to his cheeks and that wasn’t something that happened too often.
“Sorry,” he shook his head slowly as he tried to get back to the conversation. “Right, he became my neighbour and I got to know him more. Instead of wondering what his life was like, I began to wonder if he was taking care of himself. If his time during the offseason was going well, if he was having fun, if he was okay. I just kept thinking of him.”
With the intent to run after him, Harry went to remove the invisibility cloak but couldn’t. It wasn’t the same as Dumbledore’s spell—it felt different. There was a familiar warmth to the magic, that had his eyes closing.
As Harry came to with the sound of jeering Death Eaters echoing around the forest and Hagrid’s yelling, he realized he could still feel Draco.
Before Draco could come back with a retort, Harry’s mouth touched his skin; it started at the base of his spine and moved to his crack. Draco bit his lip to stop any noises from coming out and felt a victory in Harry not knowing.
“That’s what I like to hear,” Draco pat his cheek once, narrowing his eyes when Killian tried to bite him.
When Brown stood up to leave, Harry walked her to the door. “You can keep the folders; I made my own copies.”
Store fronts, bodegas and hole in the wall restaurants packed into the hell that made up downtown London—that was expected. But what wasn’t was the way a bodega’s bricks were pushed in an unnatural angle as if it had been forced to the side. Harry’s eyes settled on the building next door to it and rose a brow at the pub, one he couldn’t remember being there before, but if he was being honest with himself the only surroundings, he ever paid attention to were people.
“Go right ahead,” Malfoy lifted a hand towards the door. “You are the one that needs me, not the other way around. Don’t forget that.”
Draco didn’t say anything, and he knew that would speak volumes, but he didn’t want to admit that it had been a year, a full year since his last appointment.
More than half the room broke out in cheers and it was more than he expected. Draco watched families hug each other. Watched those he could have sworn would have been against changing anything embrace the decision. He grinned when he caught sight of Declan and Nayden jumping up and down while trying to hug each other at the same time.
“No,” he whispered. It couldn’t have been that easy, couldn’t have been right in front of his face the whole time.
“Gossip, you mean gossip,” a bright voice chimed in as Luna entered the room fully. “Ronald says gossip shouldn’t have a place in papers. Even if it’s true.”
With watery eyes and a bruised heart, Draco lowered his protection spell and watched as the tendril snapped in his direction before darting forward and latching on.
“Because you yelled at me.” There was a small smile on Potter’s face and Draco felt his face get hot and he blamed it on the alcohol.
His eyes slipped closed when he felt how restless his anger made the Dementors. That was the biggest difference between them and him. Dementors took emotions but had none of their own. Emotions can be borrowed, and sometimes they lingered after a soul was inhaled, but it wasn’t often Dementors wanted to borrow any.
“Why?” Draco asked as he reached out a hand toward Harry, as if wishing he could hold him. “What was the point?”
A hollow laugh echoed around the room and it made him flinch. It was cold, just as cold as Malfoy’s eyes and it was uncomfortable.
Draco felt a pang of sympathy or perhaps pity for Severus. He had never been in that position. As a kid, he was the tormentor, he was the one casting the spells and mocking others.
Harry grew bored of their colours, wanted to see more. He scanned up and down the street, hoping to see greys, more green or even red. It was another tug of his magic that caused him to roll his eyes and instead look for yellow, black and white.
Blaise rolled his eyes as he sat down behind his desk and began to pull out paperwork. “He asked about you while you were in your studio, asked all kinds of questions.”
The whisper carried and it brought a smile to his face. Past him never would have understood his current life. Who he had once been was in for a whirlwind as the discovery of self-love blended into loving others.
Harry’s eyes stung as he left the Headmaster’s office, left the hallway, left the school and left every chance of a happy ending behind.
Draco looked down at his fingers again as the nerves came back full swing. It wasn’t hard to picture the man Potter had been who had looked death in the face and lived. It was intimidating to be on the receiving end of a glare so strong and filled with emotion.
“Ron talked to you?” His voice hurt and so did the headache brewing behind his eyes. “He yelled at me the last time I talked to him.” Draco had known that it had been deserved, but no one
Panic. That was the first thing that Draco was able to make out on Sykes’ face. The man probably assumed his tracks had been covered. But it was Draco’s job to unearth the truth. “As I said earlier, my well wishes are with you. Not many people can do what I can, Mister Sykes. I wouldn’t make me wait much longer if I were you.”
“Good, maybe that means I will actually get some sleep tonight,” Ron grumbled, folding his hands behind his head. “Hopefully the Slytherin stays home.” There was a pause as he tilted his head. “Or gets caught by the police. Either would make my night.”
“No, that’s not it.” Harry bit his lip as he shook his head. “He tried so hard. I can tell by his written thoughts. I’ve never seen anyone think so much about their actions before. Malfoy truly wants to be a better person, and I know he can be.”
“Would there be a clause for those who can’t pay?” Draco could tell that Garnett was just as confused as he was. “Or those who send their children places using floo? Charging to floo will cause parents to have to personally apparate their children if they can’t afford to floo. This will be a setback for wizarding preschools. Some parents
“What’s with this shit?” Ron yelled, voice barely heard over the new upbeat song playing. “Why invite us out if all you’re going to do is
“I think Wizards spend a lot of their time forcing things to go their way. Use force when they can’t find another explanation, think power will be the answer. But power runs out eventually. Wizards can’t accept that some things aren’t meant for them, that they can’t access everything, that it’s okay to be excluded from some things.”
Ron cleared his throat as he checked the time. “I have to get back to work if I’m going to get off in time for tonight. But I think having Harry over is a good thing.”
Malfoy shook his head slowly as a finger moved back and forth. “You made me wait so long that I’ve forgotten how to say your name. Earn it.”
They didn’t often get too deep when discussing what it was between them—something that Harry was okay with; deep conversations weren’t his thing to begin with.
“Voldemort is going to come back, doesn’t matter how it happens or when. No point in trying to stop it.”
“Prophecies are what you make them,” said Draco as Sirius and Lucius split off and went in the other direction.
It wasn’t until he landed in the café’s floo, that Draco realized Potter was early. Not only early, but waiting for him next to the table, as if he wouldn’t sit without them both being there. It was not only a surprising change from his usual company, but it was also charming—utterly charming.
amused. “Can’t say I have a lot of practice with that. Usually been on the receiving end, but they say you only live once.”
“Life,” Draco said. “You can’t bring something forward without leaving something in its place. If a piece of the dead comes back, then a piece of the living has to be traded in return.”
“That’s exactly what I am going to do,” Draco mumbled under his breath as he turned the page. Magic in the corridors and the Great Hall would get him an unnecessary detention. No thanks.
“Hermione,” Ron said, a fond smile that warred with an eye roll. “No need to bombard him with a million questions.”
“Am I supposed to feel bad for them? Am I supposed to care that they are seeing the exact same treatment they bestow on others?”
An orgasm was right around the corner, but he didn’t want it without Draco’s too. He tried to hold it off by grabbing the base of his cock, but it was getting harder to control.
Okay, it's approaching midnight as per usual for these weekly updates, so I'm going to stop here. I'll try and reply to some of the previous comments before I go to bed, but honestly I bet I'll open up another freaking Ao3 browser.
“I think you have too much faith in me,” Draco said with a small smile. “There are better people to follow.”
A shake of Potter’s head wasn’t enough to deter him. Draco moved a hand to pinch Potter's nipples again and then repeated the request.
A shrug was his reply as a small smile was sent his way. “I think I will always want to convince others of the things they don’t understand, but it’s not my place to do so, and I should have known that already. For that, I apologize, Malfoy.”
“As if that makes it okay,” Draco scoffed, eyes looking at the castle wall in disgust. “We should have known! We should have had a chance to say no.”
Snape said nothing, but Harry didn’t really expect him to. The pride in admitting that he was wrong was too high. A human thing, really.
He hated that his eyes were stinging again. All of it was against his permission. But since when did emotions ever care about a silly thing like permission?
Harry startled, having to grab hold of a bar to remain standing upright. The possibility of human contact hadn’t once entered his mind. Sure, Wizards were there, but most of them there were catatonic and unable to move.
That, Harry, knew. He smiled at the memory of the first time he had seen her do it. Luna had weirded him out a bit in the beginning, and sometimes still did.
The crack of an apparation cut him off and Harry waited until they landed before he shoved Malfoy’s arm off him.
“I’m going to put on a show,” Seamus said, eyes excited. “Haven’t been able to get on a broom in ages with being reserve and all.”
Andrew Baxter smirked as the Patronus disappeared as quickly as it arrived. They were only a few steps away from getting the proof they needed to take down Potter
“If you’re wrong…” Sparks trailed off as she placed her hands on the desk and leaned forward, eyes narrowed in an attempt to be intimidating.
The smile turned into a familiar smirk but where it had once been associated with annoyance, Harry now found it attractive.
I want to write a longer ending note but my back is still hurting, I'm very sleepy, close to midnight once again and my mind is frazzled.
Harry put his quill and notebook back in his bag and ignored the unsaid questions on Greyson’s face.
“Some of them are dead,” Sirius murmured as he stepped out of his cell, avoiding a large hole in the process.
Malfoy looked around the room, eyes pausing on each student working or reading before he took a deep breath.
“I have to check up on the guard.” He was still suspicious about the warden too, didn’t trust her at all.
“Hm?” Harry hummed as his tongue swiped along heavy balls. Up close, to Malfoy’s crotch, the scent was stronger, more stimulating, enough that all his mind could focus on was Malfoy.
“I’m beginning to see that,” Potter said softly, eyes glancing up briefly before he stood up. “I’ll tell the Goblins your request and I’ll be back with their offer.”
“I’m sure you’ll figure it out one day,” Draco said, not looking at Potter. He couldn’t. Not if he wanted to leave with a semblance of pride intact.
When there was no answer, he looked up, brows arching at the closed-off expression and unfriendly eyes.
“Next time,” Potter said more in wonder than an agreement. Draco wasn’t sure how to respond. It was obvious that they still needed to talk if Potter hadn’t thought a next time would take place. Instead of voicing anything, he lowered a hand to lightly scratch his nails along Potter’s chest and stomach, his
“Draco likes what?” The familiar drawl made Harry’s skin crawl and his nose to wrinkle in disgust. Merlin, he couldn’t stand Malfoy.
“What are you doing?” The question came out breathy and he placed his hands on Malfoy’s stomach to act as a buffer between them.
The folder was placed on the desk as Harry leaned forward, a smile curved his lips and his eyes were soft, far softer than Draco wanted directed at him.
“That will be your downfall,” mumbled Harry as he let his Magic seep into the red until it morphed the spell into something else, something Dark.
Emily nodded distractedly, eyes on Harry excitedly showing Draco that he could find Draco's namesake among the stars.
“Been harassing people, have you?” Draco said instead of speaking the words that had been aching to be spoken for months.
“Really?” Declan actually looked interested and Draco was annoyed that the kid was so easily distracted.
The long fingers he had jerked off to gripped his shoulders hard as Malfoy settled firmly on him. The weight was just as pleasant as it was uncomfortable.
“Even if we had known the place existed, until Sirius told us himself then we’d never have found it,” Draco continued, eyes still wide. “And because he let us in on the secret, we are now bound by our own souls to keep it. We’ll never be able to tell anyone as long as Sirius is alive.”
Ron threw his hands in the air. “You’re right, I don’t understand it. You’re just waiting for him while he’s not doing the same.”
Draco took a step forward until he could peer into Potter’s face. “Potter, we have bested the Weasel twins for
Harry stopped looking at the trinkets and instead focused on the Magic in the room. The tendrils floating in the air were just as sentient as the rest of the house—strings of Magic messing with things in the room, moving objects on its own and even intertwining with whatever it fancied.
That was a hard question. There were so many that he wanted. Would there be another time? Or was this it?
“Can they get in trouble?” She wondered as Harry tried to get his anger under control. “Surely it’s against the rules.”
Harry took several deep breaths, wanting to keep going, keep taking, keep eating but fought the urges and allowed the soul to move away from his lungs and up his throat and onto his tongue.
“I keep him in here for his safety. The box is charmed on the inside, so no worries, he has all he needs.”
Sarcophagus. It gave him the willies just thinking about opening a coffin. Curse-Breaking was not for him.
“Did it work?” Harry asked, unable to stop himself. Part of him wished he had taken more of Sirius’ soul, that way he wouldn’t have to ask questions, he’d just
“What do you mean?” Draco blinked, adopting an innocent expression that had stopped working on Dobby when he was three. “I’m just telling my friends.”
It was fascinating. An entirely new concept to Harry. The soul would be powerful enough to maintain a charm like that, but it had to have serious repercussions, souls weren’t meant to be used in such a way.
Ron clenched a fist around one of the memos before he threw it at Harry. “One of these days, you’ll have to act your age.”
Take what? All he could focus on was pushing through his own magic. His eyes were half-lidded, which only happened when he was drunk, but that was an accurate descriptor for how Potter’s magic felt.
Hello! Back for the weekly update. This chapter was interesting to write, that's for sure. I think the message in the story is pretty important but I'm not going to preach or go into details, we all can read between the lines.
Duty. It all came back to duty. Despite what Lucius felt, he put himself back in the only mindset he’d ever followed. To follow one’s duty.
The shouting had increased and Draco wished he hadn’t arrived late. It was hard to tell what was going on. What stood out the most was that each of the council tables had been separated as far apart as possible, and that had him rolling his eyes. One would have thought that they had matured over the years.
If word got out that he was working with the Aurors, he’d be ruined. No. Decimated. He’d be decimated. Draco already had enemies, already had lowlifes just waiting to take his spot. They’d be out for blood if there was even the tiniest
“The only plant I can think of that would smell bad enough is Witch’s Ganglion. It’s usually found in swamps. I have a few in stasis charms for the wealthier clients, the ones that refuse to travel to get it.”
There was such a pretentious smugness in his tone, so Harry did the only thing he could think of and swallowed around his cock.
“Potter you told me that if you don’t acknowledge the past and present before you divine, that it won’t work, you won’t get what you want out of it.”
“Damn right we do.” Draco agreed, giving Potter a rare smile. “The Weasley twins will regret the day that they pranked us one too many times.”
closed the robe and tied it far more aggressively than was necessary. Draco couldn’t decide if it was a beneficial or detrimental decision.
When Draco kissed back, lips moving in a way that had Harry groaning, he had a fleeting thought to thank Emily. Because really, this was everything he had wanted and more.
A bright light exploded, and even as he rose a hand to block it out, he couldn’t look away, not if answers were to be had. The circle created a dome, a barrier of some kind, one where the light was trapped inside.
The Dementors would have taken her soul regardless of what she thought, but as she laid on the ground, eyes wide as the hood was lowered, it was her choice. The ending was her decision.
Draco expected more confusion, questions or funny stares. What he didn’t expect was for a flash of understanding to appear briefly in Potter’s eyes.
“It was different back then.” There was a fondness to his eyes that matched his tone, and it fascinated Harry. What was it about Voldemort that drew people in? “The Dark Lord has a personality that is unmatched.”
When his shirt was opened and the wound was slowly closing, Declan jumped back toward Brown with wide eyes.
Ginny scoffed, and he hated that it reminded him of Ron. Ron would have supported him if he wasn’t busy with date night. God, married people were sickening.
“Some of them are really spot on. She thinks that you would make a terrible cook. Which is amusing when you consider how efficient you are at potions.”
“I’m going to pretend you didn’t say that,” Ron interjected, frown on his face and hands on his hips. “Your last check-up was pants, I told you to lay off—”
He waited until Harry had bottomed out before biting. The cock inside him twitched but Draco knew it wasn’t exactly from pleasure. The bite of a Vampire
“Doesn’t discredit it either,” Draco retorted as his hands balled into fists. “Whether you like it or not, Sirius
memories, but they served as a memento of what made waking up each day so precious. The collection was there whenever he needed the reminder that he loved just as much as the love was returned in kind.
“Since when is having morals disgusting?” Harry countered, poking Ron’s ear. What was with these two?
. When a finger touched the tip, Harry’s eyes closed, the touch was feather light and he wanted more.
“Oh my god!” Harry choked, eyes going wide and travelling the room, making sure no one heard his crass boyfriend. “There are
“It worked,” whispered Harry as everything stilled before he let go of the portrait altogether and ignoring the sound it made as it fell backwards. “Are you okay?”
“You’ve never been innocent,” Draco said as he thrusted up, hands fondling Harry’s arse. “Not in Hogwarts when breaking every school rule and certainly not now.”
“What happened to me?” Draco croaked, fingers digging into Harry’s shirt as he wiped his eyes. “I felt like I was exploding.”
The familiar uncomfortable itch of being watched had his head turning as they neared the entrance of the school. Standing by the door were three adults who nodded occasionally at students or paused to stay something.
“Potter,” Draco returned as he took off his cloak and held it limply by his side, unsure if he was supposed to put it away himself. Potter clearly had no sense of manners.
“I know.” Draco melted into the hug. “I know it’s all stupid, and I’m working on it. I just haven’t gotten there yet, but I will.”
Harry shrugged as he took the book out of Draco’s hands and pulled him into a hug. “I’ll deny it.” A slow smirk curled Harry’s lips and Draco almost wanted to step back.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Harry swore, his breathing increasing in tempo to match the sound of running he could hear.
Harry tilted his head and closed one eye. “Mmm, I don’t know if you are qualified to make that accusation.”
Potter was on the couch, a book in one hand, a quill in the other, a Muggle device of some kind in his lap and an intense gaze on his face.
Before he could ask when that was, he was pushed backward on the bed and Malfoy was climbing on top of him. “You like this position? Seem to favour it.”
“You really think me that pathetic?” Draco opened his hands, palms upward as he turned around. Neville never pitied him, but the sadness on his face was a close second, and he hated it.
“There’s a bakery next door,” Weasley said as they moved towards the door. “That old lady was nice, even if she was a bit…dodgy.”
The whooshing of air nearby let him know that Smith had pulled out his wand. Still wasn’t enough to have Draco looking up.
“Well yes,” Kennedy said slowly with a small quirk of his lips. “But I also personally know every single story that walks through my doors.”
Harry didn’t mean to, but he tensed. The way Ron’s eyes narrowed was a bad sign. Ron was too observant for his own good.
“You can’t have missed me,” Harry laughed as he was pulled into many directions as each and every Dementor touched him at some point. “I’ve been with you the whole time.”
“Was the dildo big?” Draco wondered as he squinted, Ron was too far away but he was pretty sure a scowl was directed his way.
Another pinch to his nipples and his back arched as he came, hips thrusting quickly and Malfoy’s name on his lips.
a strong-willed Omega. I’m not going to cave to what society wants from me and I sure as shit am not going to sit around and wait for what I want. I’m a strong-willed Omega who is going to do the taking, and if that bothers you then you can get bent.”
Painting-Malfoy shook his head slowly, but his face was sad, and Harry wasn’t sure what to make of that.
Snape’s eyes narrowed before he flickered toward Lucius. Harry couldn’t tell if he knew it was Lucius or not.
Lips met his skin, tongue tracing the runes and Harry’s mouth parted, letting noises he didn’t know he was capable of making spill out.
“Besides his friends,” Draco continued with a pointed glare that he hoped got his ire across. “Was there anyone you ever noticed or heard that was close to him?”
“And?” Harry’s arms were folded. The way Ron floundered was honestly the only entertainment he had in weeks.
made up of Magic—pure Magic born out of the act of thievery. That’s why they are so mischievous, it’s what they were created out of.”
It wasn’t until they had let him into the hive that he realized when the Dementor he met in the destroyed neighborhood had accepted him, that
Whatever he had been about to say was cut off as Draco gently rolled Potter’s balls and closed his eyes.
“Not some of my better moments,” Harry said, hands raised. “I can own up to that. I was a touch… obsessed as Ron would say. I would call it aware, but that’s splitting hairs.”
“He screamed with you,” Lucius drawled from a crouched position right next to Harry. “For a moment, I thought you both were affected.”
“I see you’ve never changed,” Harry whispered as he turned to leave. “You know, back then when you left, I blamed myself, but I thank God every day that I never married you.”
“I do, ma’am, but I’m not wanting to invade Malfoy’s privacy, I just want to go over some of the things you told the Aurors.”
“If you want plausible deniability,” Harry began with a deep breath before moving Hold’s hand towards the spot that Malfoy’s was already placed. “Then I’d get out of here.”
“When you haven’t had food for a while, you’re more tired than usual, your energy is low, your magic doesn’t seem as strong, etcetera.”
Gryffindors, Draco thought in disgust as he wrenched his wrist free and stormed out of the library. And just as last time, he wasn’t able to leave without one last look over his shoulder.
“But—” It was mumbled against Harry’s lip and that was just incentive to keep kissing Draco. As their lips moved, Harry slowly let out his magic, let it enter through Draco’s mouth.
Smith rolled his eyes. “Which is exactly why we are trying to get rid of it. Don’t you want to walk freely without those beady eyes staring at you?”
“Why you?” The barely concealed suspicion was amusing. That was a look he hadn’t seen since they first crossed paths after the war.
“Bite your tongue,” admonished Draco. “There will be no correlation between me and your wretched House.”
. And no one is standing up for us. There is no fancy Light side commanded by a false fucking prophet preaching goodness fighting for us. So excuse me if I don’t bloody care what happens to Wizards. Voldemort could pick all of you off and I still wouldn’t give a fuck. It’s what you all deserve.”
When mischievousness entered Potter’s eyes and a slow smirk formed, Draco groaned. “You came in here to purposefully annoy me?”
‘What.’ It was mouthed with impatience. Draco tilted his head toward Harry before lifting his nose toward Nayden.
“Right after I kill this headache I have,” he finished with a yawn, arms stretched above his head. Harry was distracted by the way his hair stood up; it was almost like looking in a mirror.
“I’m offering you the job, Potter,” Ashwood barked. Her tone booked no argument, but he had never been one for social etiquette.
Surprisingly, Draco shivered at the thought. Potter could watch him, that wouldn’t change anything, but maybe he would like what he saw.
“He didn’t,” Narcissa said. “Blaise may be a pureblood, but he wasn’t one descended from the sacred 28.”
A visible scoff had him snorting. “I know that sounds like I’m humouring you, but I’m not. If you keep expecting wonder without putting in the effort, you’ll always be disappointed.”
Arthur and the twins exchanged a look, which Harry ignored. Didn’t care if they were suspicious, they were no threat to him.
“I really want to fuck you, but I don’t think my foot is going to let me.” It wasn’t a terrible pain, and he’d probably be fine with some potions or spells in the morning, but he didn’t want to make it worse.
“He looks so approachable when he's with his cat,” Romilda whispered to Ginny as they watched the Malfoy work on homework, while the boy also had a free hand petting the cat. A loud purr rumbled around the quiet of the library.
Sirius paused his ministrations, tongue still sticking out to glare at Harry before he continued to clean himself.
That had several whispered conversations fueling the rumor mill as everyone began wondering where the cat was.
“He fucking would give me an illegal book,” the man cursed as he ran his fingers through his hair. “A conniving prick, just like his sister.”
“I don’t know,” Potter whispered as he brushed aside the broken glass with his foot and knelt on the floor in front of Draco. “Maybe because you yelled at me.”
“Ugh, don’t remind me.” A dramatic hand to the forehead had Harry smiling. “I was late for my shift, just wanted to sleep in for once.”
“Of all the days for Seamus to be late,” Dean swore as he checked the time. They were all standing at the entrance of the party, two closed double doors with a poorly written sign that read,
That wasn’t a bad idea. Harry wrapped the scarf a little tighter before pecking Draco one last time. “Thank you.”
“Good, then keep talking.” He glanced at the time and sighed in disappointment. There were still a few minutes left before his coffee would be done.
hungry, yet. Harry flopped back on his cot with a loud sigh, arms folded, eyes closed and lips in a pout.
Harry held up a hand when Barty opened his mouth to argue. “If you are as important to Voldemort as you say you are, then I think I’ll let him come for you.”
The sound of a rustling cloak before three Dementors swooped down, placing a carved bolder behind his knees.
“I don’t know why she never went back, but I get it.” When Harry glared at him, he raised his hands in surrender. “You don’t understand what we go through.”
“That’s fine,” Harry began as he took another step forward, watching as they all gripped their wands tighter. “You can just watch then.”
“Exactly,” Blaise agreed with a harrumph. “Which is why the next time he Floos, I need you to say that.”
Ron looked around, as if hoping someone would stick up for him. Neville and Dean pretended to be in an animated discussion and Seamus held up his hand as a barrier between him and Ron.
“I’m right here with you,” Draco promised before stepping in front of the Patronuses. “They can’t harm me.”
Harry shook his head as he tentatively reached out. He sighed a little when Draco let him cup his cheek.
Harry watched Draco search the room dramatically, as if hoping to spot something. “What are you doing?”
With each stroke magic was felt in the atmosphere and he could already see little bits coming to life. A rustle of clothing, a wiggle of a hand or a bare hint of a smile. As he added finer details to Sirius’ hair, he could see it move just a little, enough for him to ease any worries about the final outcome.
Draco paced the hallway angrily and a little worriedly. It was just like Potter to make him wait. The bloody git couldn’t have the decency to show up on time. Normally, he wouldn’t worry about Harry, but the
“No. My turn.” The pace quickened, and Potter rode him harder, gasps spilling between the both of them.
The wicked quality to Draco’s voice had him sighing heavily and he blamed Hermione for it. “Do tell more, Granger.”
Malfoy hissed; eyes so narrowed it was hard to see them. “Don’t presume to know anything about me, nor my past relationships.”
“No,” Harry pressed a kiss to the tip of Malfoy’s nose and grinned when he got a glare. “Only your thoughts matter.”
I had a lot of fun writing this chapter. Even if I did have to rewrite multiple times because of my computer. Piece of shit.
Before Harry could agree, the sound of distant running echoed around them. A glance toward the shelf showed they were a few rows away from a hundred.
“My whole life has been nothing but changes,” Harry pointed out. “I’m used to adapting. I’ll handle whatever happens like I always have; a touch of stupidity and a whole lot of reckless bravery.”
Zabini pulled out a crumpled piece of parchment that had seen better days. “It would appear that the choice in entertainment was changed recently. It
work for the Ministry after all. They’ve never exactly been for the people, so excuse me if I’m against everything they stand for.”
Harry placed his other hand on the bars as well as he leaned away in surprise. People always suspect something isn’t quite right with him—
“And what he’s done isn’t?” Malfoy crossed his arms. “Don’t talk about things you don’t understand.”
“Why a painting?” Harry asked as he tried to think through his options. “Why trap him as a portrait? A silent one at that.”
The soft smile he got in return melted him completely and he blamed Ron for making him susceptible to such a Gryffindor notion and then blamed Harry for making him fall deeper into his emotions.
An oof of pain left Draco as Harry jerked in alarm. The movement caused the lumpy bean chair to move in a further uncomfortable position. How Harry’s students put up with the chairs was beyond him.
Malfoy pulled out his wand and conjured a do not disturb sign before holding open the door. “After you.”
Scorpius nodded his head with his brows furrowed in thought. He bade both his parents goodbye before walking slowly back towards the Slytherin table.
“I don’t care,” Draco huffed, hands coming to his hips an indignant expression on his face. “I don’t care if it wasn’t directed at me. I’m not going to stand by and watch you die! Not if I can help it.”
“What are you?” Moody whispered, eyes wide in horror as more and more of the mark left his arm to migrate toward Harry’s finger.
The fragrance of the perfume might have smelt okay normally, but with his heightened sense of smell, it was nauseatingly sweet. Perfume was deceiving already: covering up natural body scents by masking them. Not only could Harry smell the perfume, but he could smell the underlying natural scent of the woman—the combination was sickening.
Ron’s face fell but he squared his shoulders and sat up straighter. “I understand why you left, I do, but I have to stay. I need to see this through. I’m making a difference, I know I am. If I.A can make a case against them, then I can start over. I can bring in new Aurors and train them right. I can do this Harry. I
Draco didn’t answer right away, eyes still on Harry’s aura. There was an awe to his face that made him wonder if he had been like that the first time too. Had he marvelled at colours in the same way?
what he could possibly gain from a relationship with someone who doesn’t even act as if they are dating.”
Harry closed his eyes, letting his Magic rush forward, coming head-to-head with the wards of the school. It was old Magic, the kind that had been applied over and over as the years passed. Magic from a variety of people, probably the teachers each year.
Harry’s fingers traced the journal and he knew his face was morphed in a frown. “Ron stayed and I don’t understand how he could.”  He had tried to listen, tried to hear Ron’s input but nothing made it okay.
It was laughably over after that. Oh, the Aurors tried to put up a fight. There were screams of, ‘Patronus!’, but those were temporary and minimal with how many Dementors there were. What good was a spell that needed a happy memory if the memory’s emotion was going to be stolen anyway? Where was the happy then?
I was surprised by the love for this ficlet. I still get random spurts of notes where it comes back. I loved it, and I adore the art so much. You don't even know.
Sirius had yelled but it was muffled over the sound of racing wind that whipped at Harry’s cheeks, leaving stinging cuts.
Draco wanted to hide his face in his robes. Of course Potter would arrive at the worst possible time. That was just who he was.
“Hi little tellies!” Draco waved at their new camera, one that Harry now manned, taking in Draco’s new hobby in stride.
Potter offered a hand as he stood up and Draco took it a little cautiously. Whatever was to happen would change things, and he wasn’t sure he was ready for that.
Draco wasn’t sure if that was a compliment, not when he had seen the weight of the words on both positive
Pretty. The words made him scoff at the same time it made him hungry for more. Praise wasn’t something he cared much for but hearing the compliment from Harry
“What are we supposed to do?” Harry asked, looking around the bathroom, nose wrinkling. “Just sit here?”
Another shake of a head had Harry groaning. “Well someone did, and I’m beginning to think it was whoever took your counterpart.”
“I don’t want to,” Potter said softly, so quietly that Draco was grateful that his studio held an echo. “But I will, because I want to see him again. I want a second chance too.”
The silence that followed was more telling than the entire conversation. Desperation meant nothing if it led to a brick wall.
“I don’t need an Alpha,” Draco said, fingers running through his hair—shaved at the side, the contrast of long strands melting into a fade of barely-there fuzz. “Nor would I fucking want one.”
“Merlin,” Brown breathed, an actual smile on her face. “I haven’t seen you outside of brief Prophet articles.”
Harry threw out his hands, darkness encasing the grounds, wind picking up to near hurricane levels as thunder roared and rain came pouring down. He could hear glass break and he hoped it was at least a few windows.
The painting was wrong, all wrong, and he knew it, but he couldn’t change it, couldn’t fix it, because it was how it was supposed to go.
A slight mewl brought Draco’s attention to bleary green eyes blinking up at him. The sight took his breath away, but his mind painfully forced it to return. Even his anatomy was smitten. Perfect. Bloody perfect.
Malfoy’s finger was still inside of himself and it was tempting, very tempting. Harry placed a hand on Malfoy’s thigh, keeping his legs spread. The other leg had been placed on Harry’s shoulder before he turned his head enough to kiss Malfoy’s leg.
He waited until she took over before asking Crow to be the one to do the design. “I’ll handle the runes, but first I need to speak to someone.”
Draco shook his head, unwilling to agree. “Harry is your best friend. If I had told you that I wanted to do a piece on Sirius for
A hollow laugh escaped Draco as he slid to the floor and wrapped his arms around his knees. “Do you know how many times I wished that were true? How many times I wondered what my life would have been like if you had just
“I fail to see how taking out all Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans except Chocolate, Gin, Firewhiskey, Éclair, and Lobster classifies as wanting the best.”
Eight months since his last breakup. Eight months of lonely nights, cold sheets and an empty ache in his heart that wouldn’t go away.
Draco tried not to be flustered by being Potter’s sole focus. He usually was, but this time it was different. Potter actually
His life would be easier if Potter wasn’t so difficult, but as Draco said his goodbyes and Flooed home, he realised his life had
The air was thick and dense as Draco walked through the narrow hallway. He tried to ignore Potter and focus on the house, but his presence was felt despite his efforts.
Harry had expected to come out of the Ministry knowing more than when he had entered. What he hadn’t expected was to have more questions.
Malfoy half sat up, letting Harry continue to pound into him. “When you come, I want my name on your mouth, I want it ringing in your ears.”
“Is she drunk too?” Malfoy whispered; face barely lifted up as he squinted at the fireplace. “What’s a Heliopath? And why does it fly?”
“They’re throwing the match,” Hermione said confidently when the Portree’s Keeper failed to block another goal. “Why? Why would they do that?”
The best he could do was sit against the wall, legs extended, and wallow in his head. Fuck Malfoy and his perfect scent.
“Do you—” Draco bit his lip as he tried to find a sensitive way to approach it. “Do you think I could look at what he left behind? I won’t take anything.”
“Black used any spell he could with little knowledge on what it did. As long as it hurt the target, he didn’t care what kind of aftereffects there were. He acted first and only ever thought about the consequences if he was
“Oh?” Harry arched his brows as he walked ahead. “If you know me so well then what is it you think is happening?”
“It’s like you were just waiting,” Sirius whispered, pain colouring his tone. “Waiting for the chance to get rid of me. You never stood up for me like you did others. You fought so hard for people like Snape, who
Harry didn’t answer. Instead, he leaned forward to slowly inhale, letting the mark into his mouth and wrap around his lungs. It wasn’t quite like sucking a soul, but there were still flashes.
Kennedy moved away from the file cabinet and he hoped that wasn’t a sign of sorts, hoped that he wasn’t going to be shown the door.
“Oh?” Harry arched a brow, smirk quirking up the corner of his mouth. “You care about others now? Since when?”
drew his attention but that disappeared when Draco pressed his lips to Harry’s and kissed him softly, a barely press of lips but it was enough to have his stomach fluttering.
Harry pulled on Draco’s arms until the git landed in his lap ungracefully. He laughed when Draco scowled at him. “What did you do? You only use flattery when I have to cover your tracks.”
“Well, that’s something,” Coil said as he closed the notebook and shot Harry another glare before taking the portrait and leaving the room.
me. How am I supposed to think you won’t leave me to rot here?” Arms gestured around the room as Sirius sneered at the decorations and portraits on the wall.
The plaque on the wall that bore Sirius’ name was faded and the edges had corroded from the lack of magic in the vicinity. It was obvious that Potter had not kept up the maintenance of the house after Sirius’ death, and he had to wonder if Sirius himself had ever kept the house in proper standing.
“Hm?” He blinked rapidly, eyes moving from the finger in front of him to end up focusing on a smirk—a smirk that had no right looking that good.
“So then are we rooting for the underdogs? The team that has bad luck? Sounds like something we’d do.”
“I can’t believe we are putting our livelihood in the hands of Malfoy,” Seamus said as he took a swig from his flask. Harry would toast to that. He wanted to reassure everyone that it would all be okay, but he didn’t exactly trust Malfoy either.
“Just the first one.” He watched the way Draco’s shoulders slumped and he wondered if apologisng would make up for it, but it wasn’t until Draco’s eyes opened and he could see how glassy they were that he did reach out.
Brown tossed several folders on the table. “1. Lane. Chairman of the Werewolf council. He’s been operating an illegal fighting ring.”
But the passion simmering deep in his gut was new, an experience he wasn’t sure what to make of. His body was reacting before his mind could, something Draco took notice of, a sly smirk with a thumb still in his mouth.
“You know,” he whispered as he placed his hand in the pot that held Floo powder. “I have learned a lot about Sirius over the past few weeks and if you think the person who loved so strongly, and so fiercely wouldn’t be able to see me and give me a second chance, or at least talk to me, then I don’t want to paint him anyway.”
Potter moved til he was on his back, knees extended upwards. “And what was the wager? I don’t remember there being one.”
“Do get off the floor, won’t you?” It was drawled in a condescending tone, one that Harry didn’t care for.
It did to Draco. He was curious, that didn’t happen often. He opened his mouth to ask, but Potter kept talking.
“Maybe because you stopped being an Auror,” Harry said as he looked up from the letter for the first time. “He knew you’d have gone after him.”
The silence in the room was deafening as Harry walked out and part of him wanted one of them to say something, but that was the reckless part, the one that Draco always said was itching for a fight.
He looked up at painting Malfoy and could see a sadness to them, but it held no surprise. And wasn’t that just depressing?
“I wanted to kiss you,” Malfoy rubbed their noses together and he could feel fluttering eyelashes against his own. They were close, so close but it still wasn’t enough. “I wanted to snog you right there in the club.”
“I didn’t kill them if that helps,” Draco mumbled. “When I got there, they were forsaken just like me.”
Potter grinned so wide Draco could see his gums and it took his breath away, it wasn’t fair. When he was pulled forward and they walked back the way they came, Draco couldn’t help but push it.
“Yeah.” The smirk melted back into a smile, only it was wide and gross. It was too early in the morning to put up with
“Sorry to interrupt,” Declan cleared his throat. “But I was wondering if you could tell me some stories about my mum while she was in Hogwarts?”
“Depends on you,” Draco said, nose pressed against his cheek. “Are you ready, Harry? Are you ready to become my mate?”
Stifling silence was a comfort as Harry tried to regain composure. His erection wasn’t easy to ignore. He was either going to lunge across the table and have his way with Malfoy, or he would go back to his office and jerk off,
“What’s that?” It sounded weird to him. Why would a pig have warts? Was it somewhere ugly? Somewhere they sent ugly people to?
The tightness was nothing on the pleasure he could see on Malfoy’s face. When he bottomed out, Harry had to focus on something else because Malfoy’s scent was so overpowering. His eyes fell on a flushed cock, shiny at the tip and twitching the longer he stared.
Reluctantly, Harry had to admit that it wasn’t a terrible plan. He would rather it be someone else who’s appearance was messed with.
Don't know if you have guessed it or not, but the song was, 'Begin Again', by Taylor Swift. This one was actually interesting to do. I wanted to get the vibe of the song, but take it lyric by lyric, you know?
Harry rolled his eyes. “That kind of talk is exactly why they don’t like Vampires. Your cockiness offends them.”
“Okay,” he said before walking around the desk and pulling Ron into a hug. “There are parts I don’t agree with, but I get it. Doing what feels right to
Harry looked down at the journal again before tracing a finger along the spine. “The last entry I read was about love.”
“I got the second layer of the grisaille done,” Draco pursed his lips. “It’ll take a few days to cure before I can do the next but it’s improvement.” Some artists, like Pierce, could do most of it in one step but Draco hadn’t ever mastered that and had to work in sections to make sure his proportions and final adjustments were lined up properly.
The question threw Draco, he glanced over but his brows furrowed at the equal confusion on Potter’s face.
Harry rolled his eyes as he shoved Barty in the nearest kitchen chair. “She’ll somehow tie it to seasons of time and some bullshit about a millennia ago when things were
“I’m sure he was,” Draco said, the urge to throttle Phineas just as strong as it had been before. “But I’m not doing a piece on him.”
Goyle’s voice startled him but not enough to take his eyes away from the photo. It was interesting to see Malfoy so peaceful, not really a descriptor he’d have ever used for him.
By the increase in volume, George knew that his brother was just getting started. Honestly, Fred was the more dramatic of the two of them and it was best to let his brother continue talking. Merlin knows what would happen if any of it became suppressed.
When they walked into the court, ready for whatever case was on the schedule for the day, over half the council members glared at them—including Harry. He didn’t care about that; his mind was focused on the changes to the court. Where there had once been four tables dividing each council—keeping them as separate as possible—there was now only one long table where no one was separated by councils. They were one. One council, one court, one community.
Silk restraints were calling his name. The desire to use them again was too strong to ignore. The last time they had used that, Harry almost broke the magic in them when Draco edged him for over an hour. That should have been the only thing he grabbed, but Harry never could resist a dildo.
Harry tried to wandlessly summon his wand just in case things went sour, but he stilled when Malfoy whispered, “You’re right.”
The sound of bustling house elves wasn’t enough to distract him from Potter’s eyes, and he wished he had just skipped his morning ritual altogether.
He loved to see them, but Merlin was he glad to see them go. Harry placed several Sterilising Charms around anything they touched as soon as he heard the whoosh of their Floo departure. The smell of the spell was preferable than what it was before.
Crooks stared at nothing for far too long, and it was disturbing. Before he could decide the best way to kick her out, she startled hard enough to jostle the tray of fingers.
Confusion bubbled up inside of Draco the longer the date continued. Love was supposed to be a blinding disaster. One that he saw coming but chose to endure the pain anyways. Love does nothing but
“That night, when I brought you here after the club, you told me to let you in. I realized that I had already let you into my heart. My magic recognized that, it included you in my wards ever since, not really sure how to undo it either.”
Painting-Malfoy regarded him intently, eyes searching for something before he huffed and gestured his hand forward as if giving approval.
It was an opening. He could admit it all to Harry and have the long-awaited conversation or he could continue to live in denial.
I'm looking forward to the next part too. There isn't many parts left, actually. Getting closer to the party 👀👀 Part of the next part will be based on some art that someone drew which was inspired by this Draco. I finally was able to include that in my writing and I'm pumped.
Harry would have closed his eyes if that wouldn’t have made it look worse. His hands were itching to pick back up his book and hide forever, even if it was upside down.
When Potter didn’t say anything, he peered up and leaned away at the expression on Potter’s face. It was calm and filled with something that he didn’t know how to describe.
Kissing Potter wasn’t what he thought it would be. There was chemistry, but not enough, not what he had imagined and thought over when he allowed himself the chance to fantasize. A brief sense of disappointment filled him, and he couldn’t fathom why kissing Potter wasn’t good.
Before Harry could speak, Draco marched to him angrily, hands clenching at his sides. “It was a Death Eater, wasn’t it? Which one was it?
Draco trembled as he took a breath, not deep enough to last long but enough that Harry knew he’d get a rush from it.
When Amos narrowed his eyes, Draco didn’t fidget, he didn’t squirm, he was serious, and he wanted Amos to
“Yes. Considering Regulus’ death and Sirius’ imprisonment, it would seem that Pollux’s decision was unwise.”
“Excuse you?” Nott angled his head towards the painting—it was massive, taking up most of the back wall—frown in place and eyes narrowed. “This is on loan from a reputable museum—not that you would know anything about that—you can’t take it.”
“Just leave me alone,” Draco whispered, and he hoped that it carried, hoped that one didn’t have to shout for the intercom to pick it up.
The snort he got in return was not appreciated. “He’s only been gone a month. Not enough time to miss him.”
“I can hear you,” Harry scowled, eyes still on some kind of tentacled creature as he let Lucius pull them away. “I just ignore what you say.”
“I’ve never understood the emphasis people put onto a scent,” Potter said as he scratched his chin. “Books, movies, magazines; they all romanticize the way people smell. Something that my mind naturally tunes out. They all act as if the first whiff is love at first sight. Sometimes people smell okay, and sometimes they reek. But that’s all they are to me, a smell.”
Had he been looking at it wrong the whole time? Should he not have been observing the weather in its basic form? Was there another message somewhere?
Lucius let out a low groan that was drowned out by Hermione’s equally low gasp. Harry glanced at Draco, pleased to see a wicked smirk on his face.
Yellow light was surrounding his hands and he wasn’t sure what it was. Oh, logically his mind understood. The years of dreams, flashing lights, whispered Latin words and Uncle Vernon’s insistence that magic was a figment of his imagination and nothing more all led up to this.
He tried to count each step, but he never could count beyond twenty but that’s okay because Dudley was still learning to count to ten. So Harry would count to twenty and then start all over again. He wasn’t sure how many times he did that but when he eventually came to a standstill, he didn’t recognize anything around him.
His mother had rarely spoken of Sirius, but the few times the papers mentioned him, his father would laugh and mention the irony of the whole thing. The Ministry couldn’t lock up real Death Eaters easily but had managed to capture an innocent man.
“I’m going to kill Lovegood,” Malfoy grumbled, hair dishevelled, clothes the still mess from the night before. There was a red mark along his cheek, as if his hand had been pressed against his skin the whole night.
“First lesson you learn when working for Gringotts is that Goblins are hoarders. They don’t take in anything that doesn’t benefit them, but they also keep everything else.
Severus lifted his nose in the air and turned his back on Draco. Clearly death hadn’t matured him any.
“I can see them,” Harry said, rolling his eyes when Hermione looked at him with doubt. “They only let those they want see them. They have chosen Luna.”
“I don’t think that’s true,” Harry murmured, wishing he could make sense of the blurry aura. It didn’t make sense no matter how he tried to reason and that alone filled him with a need to figure it out. “I think you get into more trouble than you fix it.”
Draco glanced at the clock hanging over the sink. “We don’t have much longer before I have to wash the dye out of your hair.”
The long-suffering sigh was familiar, and he hadn’t realized he missed it until now. Strange that he had even missed Ron being annoyed with him.
The appeal was there, but he couldn’t help but wonder what it would have been like if it were reversed. He wanted to feel rough fabric against his skin, wanted to see how little skin Potter would reveal as the night wore on.
“I tried to combine Futurology and Aeromancy and somehow my magic recognized yours in the rain storm I was in when in the staff room. It’s not like normal magic. It knows what it's doing.”
much power. A power that filled him with awe, a power that touched his own Magic and for a brief moment felt as if they had intertwined.
It wasn’t until a flash flood hit the kitchens, a windstorm tore apart the Great Hall, a sandstorm struck the Quidditch pitch, and erosion struck the Black Lake’s shore that Potter started watching him closely. He felt eyes on him even when no one was there. Draco knew that he’d have to figure out the mystery of the weather just to get Potter off his back.
“We are.” It came out more of a question than anything. He wasn’t sure what they were, all he did know was that he wanted to leave.
The dragon lifted her head, watery eyes on him before briefly glancing at Draco. Harry placed a hand on the side of her head, careful to avoid a particularly large spike. When she let Draco on her other side, he knew they were safe.
Harry had been to his fair share of Mind Healers in his life, and even once to a Muggle therapist. He’d been inside many offices, but as he stood in the doorway of Mind Healer Hold’s office, he couldn’t help but be confused.
“Wait,” Harry shook his head. “I didn’t want to steal from Greengrass in the first place and now you want us to steal from
Was it a skill of Potter’s that made Draco want to instinctively believe him? Was it personal magic? Or was it just charm?
“I think it’s cute,” Dean said, head in his hands as he watched a new dancer take the stage. “Shut up.”
Harry tried recalling if Draco had said a particular shop but he couldn’t remember. Just when he was about to begin going to each shop, a familiar mop of blonde exited an apothecary.
“He mentioned my name,” Harry said, amusement rising at how uncomfortable the portrait looked. “I’m not an expert in the emotion. Dumbledore would say I got rid of Voldemort with love, but I honestly have always thought I got lucky. I have a lot of love in me, but I don’t think it was something I ever wielded, not in the way people think.”
When there was another magical pinch to his arm, Harry couldn’t help but laugh—only it sounded like a wet chuckle.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake—” Malfoy snarled as he rounded the corner, wand raised and a harsh sneer in place.
“Are you telling me the Dark Lord had Horcruxes?” Despite him being dead, panic welled up, and Draco felt his fight or flight reflexes kicking in. The latter predominantly stronger.
The smirk against his lips was not appreciated. Ashwood had written him up. It had been worth it though, oh so very worth it.
Avoiding Malfoy was harder than he thought it would be. Getting Jackson to go to the Department of Records for him was easy. Barrelling into what he had thought was an empty room when he caught sight of Malfoy’s retreating back was not—the people in the Minister’s debriefing seminar had not been amused either.
“Oi! You’re being too loud and it’s messing with my vision,” Seamus said as he pulled out his flask and tipped it towards Harry before taking a drink.
“No,” Harry snorted. “Those are the playing pieces. You choose one to be you. It will be your character piece for the whole game.” He watched the way Draco straightened up and peered at the pieces with an intense stare, as if judging them.
“I’m not sure what will happen,” Luna admitted with a small frown. “All I know is that change is coming and I don’t know if it’s benevolent.”
“The nice Aurors. They are questioning people in Diagon Alley and here who might have seen a missing person. I can’t remember much, but the one in charge...she had such nice fingers.”
He wasn’t ready, wasn’t ready to talk about it, nor did he want to pretend everything was alright when it wasn’t.
He could see their happy memories blended into one giant combination making it hard to grapple with which memory was whose. That alone bombarded his mind and made it hard to concentrate, but combined with the pain, he was struggling.
“I never told anyone, mainly because I was embarrassed, and I didn’t want to put energy into something that was obviously never going to happen.”
Whispers of whatever happened in the bathroom with the Idiot Trio were making rounds, again. He tried to tune them out, but it was hard. Did Potter really take down a Troll? It was hard to believe. What with how
,” Draco grinned. “He didn’t hear that growing up at all and I think he says it so much because he’s trying to make up for lost time. I don’t mind. I like hearing it. Makes me melt a little bit to know that he loves me so much.”
The bookcase in the staff room held books from all required lesson plans from each teacher, that way if a student came looking for help, any professor could provide help should the one they were looking for be absent. He pulled all the ones on Divination out and went back to the mess he created on the floor.
Too many Wizards. The place was a revolving door of people and Harry hated it. It disgusted him. That many people shouldn’t exist.
“Don’t throw up, please,” Harry warned as he stepped into the fireplace. “It won’t match the décor.”
No, the boy was surrounded in red—so much so that it drowned out any other colour. For the first time that he could ever remember, Harry was concerned for another person.
