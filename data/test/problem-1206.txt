Harry, who has been relatively quiet, stares at him for a moment before he blurts out, “Why do you always say things which make me want to kiss you so fucking bad?”
"Studying, Potter. Something you might not have heard of,” Draco replies distractedly. The git is annoying even in the morning, probably likes to wander around and
He goes back to bed, he cradles Harry’s face and shushes him. “It’s alright, I understand. I’ll stay.”
“Harry, dear. What do we owe this pleasure to?” Narcissa asks as he enters the room.
“Hey Mum, hey Dad,” he says as a way of greeting as he sits down beside them.
When they pulled apart, he said, “don’t worry, you both. He is not my Harry anyway. I’ll be fine.” Malfoy didn’t look fine and even Harry could tell that.
He thanks the man and hurries to Wiltshire after making his payment.
“Well, as is my duty, I shall teach you.” Uncle Padfoot says with a pained expression and Harry thanks him enthusiastically which makes Uncle Padfoot wince and Uncle Moony sets off laughing again.
“Shit, I didn’t see you-”
And that’s that. He stays the night, for the first time in almost two years. He would be inhuman not to, not when he saw Harry’s face. He had been inhuman loads in the past, not anymore. That he had promised himself, that summer of 1998.
“are you sure you want that? You won’t regret it when you get your memories back?” Malfoy asked slowly.
“Oh, I always thought you’re gay.” Ginny comments and many of them nod agreeingly.
Just then, Harry comes home and they order takeout, both of them too tired to cook dinner.
, I won’t be a part of it. Not anymore. You asked for time, I said alright. It’s almost been one year since we started going out. A year and half since your breakup and if you aren’t ready because you can’t face the public. I can’t. Had you said you can’t because you aren’t ready. I would have had no problems, but this Harry. This I won’t tolerate, not any longer.” He gets up from his seat and comes to stand infront of him.
“But Weasley, just think about it! We might have had Krum with us tonight as your partner and not Granger.” Draco says and scrunches his nose in mock disgust and the couple sends a stinging hex each and Draco yelps.
“Engagement rings, thank you.”
Draco snickers and Harry can’t help but join in as he thinks about the look on everyone’s faces. But first he needs to tell his friends.
They both stare incredulously at Luna who gives them a sheepish smile and a small wave. Devilish the lot of them, thats it.
Harry ignored her and lifted his eyebrows at malfoy again, “well if you take away the ones I had. It’s only fair, I get those back.”
He tries to sleep via Occlumency, it’s a tedious process but it’s not like he has something better to do. He is surely going to be sporting dark circles come morning. Thank Merlin for glamour spells.
“I always knew this dream would break, mione. I’ll be fine. I have reg.” Draco sighed before he came to stnd directly infront of Harry.
“Very well then, Harry. You have both our permission to marry our son and we both would be honoured to welcome you into the Malfoy family. I…I might have been wrong about you afterall.” Lucius says and coming from him it’s high praise. He is glad both of them and he tells them so and both of them smile fondly at him. They make him stay for tea and afterwards wishes him luck as he floos to Diagon Alley to meet Hermione and Pansy at the new cafe.
“oh, absolutely. I think my actual self would be actually thankful. And please do this as soon as possible.” Harry requested, although his tone showed anything but.
He playfully shoves Ron and then turns to kiss his fiance. Let the papers make what they want of that. He’ll be coming out in two days via the Quibbler anyways. As they break apart, he smiles softly at Draco and he smiles back.
Send me a prompt if you want!
Rubbing his eyes, he ventured out of their bedroom, yawning as he went, he smelled toast and maybe eggs and bacon from the kitchen so he went that way.
As he entered the kitchen, he found Draco sitting on the counter, engrossed in a book. Just the usual then.
He gives Harry one last smile before apparating away.
“Yes, of course.”
Draco says nothing but spreads his legs apart and Harry seats himself against Draco’s warm and solid chest without another word.
“Draco, you know I don’t mean that. And- and I didn’t mean any of the shit I said after waking up,” Harry tries again, he knows it’s futile somewhat but he can’t just give up. “I should not have accused you like that. My last self was a number one arsehole.”
“It’s going to be a real shocker to our friends as well. Do you think they know somehow?” Harry asks because it’s weird how Hermione who always is perspective in most things and Ron, who might look oblivious but was so observant all the time had no idea. He didn’t even think about Blaise or Pansy or the rest of their friend group because it would transform into a headache and he was enjoying his rare day off with his fiance.
“What is it, darling?” He asks extra sweetly. Harry’s expression wobbles for a second- oh the brat knows he is in serious trouble, good.
“So…”
“Because it’s considered bad luck,” Harry reminds him, making Draco pout sullenly.
.” Harry says fiercely.
“stay…” it comes out in a whisper of a breath but he knows that harry understands him all the same.
“No I don’t,” Harry protested quickly. Far too quickly.
Harry smiles while shaking his head and softly caresses his left cheek. “Not until dinner, love.”
In the last, Draco agrees on a goth look with a short dress and mesh slacks. Harry with golden eyeliner which Pansy says would look godlike on his brown skin, so Blaise is going to do the same. He decides on wearing just his flag colours, with clip-on earrings and everything.
“Strip out of your outer clothes and go wait in our room.” Draco orders but Harry defiantly rolls his eyes.
He stops breathing as he slowly enters the room. Draco doesn’t object so he is fine. When he stops a feet away from Draco. He looks so frail like this, like he hasn’t slept or eaten properly in days, he probably hasn’t.
“What shall we ever do?” Harry wonders outloud.
The sight that greets him as he enters the kitchen is mouth-watering, not only are there fried eggs, toast, bacon and even pumpkin juice. But there’s also Harry in the most tiniest pair of pants Draco has ever seen and his mouth is watering.
“So, did you want something? Because you look like you do or did you suddenly remember that even though you are twenty seven, you have two very much alive Uncles in your life. Which one is it?” Uncle Moony asks as he adds chocolate chips to the dough. He steals a bit of dough and a chunk of chocolate from the bowl and directly puts it in his mouth before Uncle Moony starts up on why he shouldn’t do that.
“Thank you, Haz.” Both of them reply in unison, sparing him a glance each before focusing on the work at hand.
“Oh come off it, as if you both aren’t deadly as well. Head of DMLE and Head of Unspeakables. I think that makes you both more dangerous.” Hermione replies and he shrugs in response.
The questions did come, in the most casual ways and after so many weeks that Harry had almost,
“…yes, I did, you know to ask for their permission. How did you-” Draco doesn’t get time to finish because Harry is onto him.
“What am I even doing?” he thinks out loud, he is sitting in an empty room and he has been trying to play one song for the last two hours, to absolutely no avail. This is going to suck, all he had wanted was to gift his boyfriend a recording of their favourite song on his birthday but no- he is a disaster.
“I want to ask for Draco’s hand in marriage.” Harry blurts out, the silence that follows is deafening. He looks from Malfoy to the other, both of them seem to be in an intense conversation which is being spoken through their eyes.
“I love you too, love.” Draco replies and then he is out. His last thought as he goes to sleep is that he is blessed.
“So, well- why aren’t you both reacting in any manner?” Harry asks, a tinge of frustration in his voice.
“No, no why would you think that?”
“I needed to claim all the Malfoy estates because Dad reckons he hasn’t got long and well I was tired of that particular argument.”
“Potter, Regulus is, Regulus Malfoy-Potter is our son. Or I should say
Ron looked torn between shocked and upset and Hermione was actually crying. She started protesting but Draco just shook his head and smiled at her.
, Potter? Me who has been unable to answer my kid why his other father has not come home except for that he is still sick and needs rest? Me who has been-” he stops abruptly and takes a deep, calming breath, “Anyways, my point is I didn’t do a
“See you in another life, Harry. Or maybe, another unplanned meet, exactly twenty years after?” Draco tries to joke but his humor doesn’t work on Harry. Draco softly caresses Harry’s left cheek for a second too long before he pulls away completely and gone is the man he fell in love with. He is replaced by the public front again, and Harry finds himself missing it.
“Harry, go get dressed love. We have to leave in thirty minutes and I don’t want to be late to this party.” Draco says as he enters the room and finds Harry lying on the bed.
Endless love.
“Hey Zia!” Harry greets her brightly, just because he is going through internal war doesn’t mean he’ll just give up his manners.
friends.
“and the child-”
“Aunt, you know it’s nothing. Moreover, we both love spending time with Teddy.” Draco says before Harry can even open his mouth to protest.
“And what would you like me to tell you? That I forgive you and you’re welcome back in my life? Is that what you think would happen when you came here?” Draco taunts and shit if he doesn’t deserve it.
He tries to find Draco in the throng of people. He wants silence now. To grieveq, as he finally can. He searches all across the place but no one has seen Draco since he threw his wand at Harry.
Neville is going in his usual wool sweater and trousers and his flag around his shoulder. Theo is matching with him.
“Visit?”
“Why are we still a secret?” Draco asks after a moment of silence and Harry, he feels himself freeze.
He conjured up a hair tie and made a messy bun out of his disastrous hair, it was too hot to keep it down any longer.
“Bacon, eggs, toast and juice okay for breakfast?” Harry asks and Draco nods mutely before taking a seat at the table.
He can’t express the amount of love that passes through him at that single sentence. Draco went to Godric’s hollow to ask his parents. The gesture is so sweet that he can actually feel his heart ache. They lose themselves in one another after that, no longer waiting for words to express their feelings, but rather showing it with their actions as they make sweet tender love.
It had been a very very bad idea to let Harry go unpunished for the moment. Because Harry has been nothing but a brat ever since they got here. He has been touching him and leaving soft kisses everywhere. Innocent enough for giving them publicly unless one knows what to look for.
“Yes, Lucius I haven’t lost my way and I know Draco doesn’t live here any longer, since you know, he lives with me now,” he retorts back- Merlin it’s weird enough calling Lucius by his name in his head, it’s weirder when he says it out loud. “I actually wanted to ask for something.”
“Alright, the two of you. Enjoy your night, go home safely. I need to get going if I want to make it home before him.” Harry says as he gets up and kisses both their cheeks one by one.
A shiver runs down Harry’s spine and Draco grins slyly, even after a decade Harry has the same reaction. Honestly, it’s good for his ego.
“Oh I’m sure he won’t.” Father replies as he enters the room.
“Did he say something else?” Harry asks because something tells him he is being withheld from information.
“Hmm, what happened to traditions huh?” Draco murmurs sleepily.
“But I can see you wearing yours, son.” Father says.
“We are to babysit Teddy. Andy’s friend has gotten terribly sick and she has to go urgently.” Harry explains.
. and it was true because hermione had threatened to do exactly that if he landed himself in the hospital yet again.
“Victor Fucking Krum!” Harry says out loud and it makes sense with all the obsession and everything that he say in his fourth year.
“This is making me wanna sleep all over again, y'know?” Draco mumbles against Harry’s neck.
“Yup”
“Sorry, love but I used to detest any musical instruments when I was younger and your grandparents never did force me to learn.” Dad says as he smiles sheepishly at Harry, “You can ask Padfoot, I’m sure he knows.”
Slowly, he thinks of pulling away even if he can’t bring himself to actually achieve that. It’s Draco who makes the first move, he always does in these situations. Draco might break first, literally and metamorphically, but he never shows it outside. Not when they are out, and he is vulnerable to the world.
“You should really stop refering to being an Unspeakable as dubious work you know?” Harry says as he snuggles closer to Draco.
“Well I’m gay through and through,” Theo says next and kisses Neville on the lips as if to show that.
And then clicks and holy shit-
“I think it is time to go,” Dad says morosely.
Harry softly caresses his hair and sighs contently. This is what home feels like.
“can you tell me more about it?” Harry asks, genuinely curious.
“Yes, it was. Come here,” Draco says and tugs Harry close. He snuggles closer and Draco places soft kisses against his neck.
So he plays.
“Oh Lucius, why don’t we hear out the young man before you start with all your nonsense.” Narcissa says and she waves her hand towards Harry in a way to tell him to continue.
“To…to come out to everyone.” Harry stutters and Draco looks up into his eyes.
“It’s just that you don’t feel like going through the hassle of being dragged through the mud for me. For
Draco remains silent.
He notices the tiny, slightly out of place hair strands out of place. The clenched jaw as he tries to keep himself together and how he unconsciously keeps brushing his left arm.
Draco smirks at the idea and slowly follows after Harry
Blaise agrees on full black, as usual. Just the make-up would be his highlight, according to him. Luna is going in a fairy dress, Ginny in shorts and a sleeveless camisole.
The three of them sat in silence for thirty more seconds before Hermione got up, mumbled something about
Send me a prompt  there if you want!
They talk some more. Harry’s heart growing heavier by each passing second. Why was this so fucking hard? He has had twenty fucking years to mend his heart but all it took was one conversation,
What things? Don’t ask.
, Ron shouts inside his mind and shares the look with Hermione. Malfoy, probably for the first time in his life looks dumbfounded. This moment should go down in history.
“I don’t understand how you are friends with Hermione Granger and still have the audacity to insult books.”
He goes into their closet and the sight that greets him makes his cock twitch. Harry is standing their in black stockings, and a garter belt- complete with lacy black panties.
“Harry,” Uncle Moony sighs and shakes his head. He has been stealing cookie dough from as early as he can remember, why stop now.
“Harry?”
Ron is now red in embarrassment so it’s Hermione who answers, “Well, love can I then? Since you don’t seem like you can talk in the next hour?” Ron nods his head resigned and Hermione smiles her cat-ate-the-canary smile. Oh this is going to be
“don’t mind me asking but Potter, you have never taken interest in music before…”
“Yes, we did.” Draco says back.
This must be a dream, Harry decides as last.
“Hey Mione, I can hear Pans in the background as well.” Draco says when he answers the phone call. It had taken him some time but now he could easily use most muggle appliances.
He had looked at Harry then his hand, given a slight shake of head and a tight smile before he took his hand away.
“Is that so? The slut doesn’t want to be punished? That won’t do,” Draco tuts and he is onto Harry in a second. He just crowds him against the wall, not even touching Harry yet and Harry gasps loudly.
“uhm, okay. Ha-Potter, could you tell me what year this is?” malfoy asked, did he really think harry to be so dumbheaded that he would forget the year.
“Sorry bud but now is sleeping time,” Harry says.
He had been surprised when he noticed that they both had chosen almost identical rings for each other, except for the size of the diamonds. He had kissed Draco very inappropriately when he had noticed, much to Ron’s horror. Seriously, the dramatics never stopped when it came to Ron and Draco.
“Harry,” he warns and that’s enough.
“Yeah, he was.” Draco agrees but he doesn’t say anything else.
“I don’t…”
“Yes, Mr. Potter. The ring is ready and just how you asked it to be. I’ll bring it right out,” the old man says, who Harry got to know was the owner of the shop from Pansy.
“as your appointed healer, if nothing else.” malfoy replied before leaving his private hospital room.
It was a warm summer morning when Harry finally woke up. A slight pleasantness was in the air even if it was sultry hot. Harry loved it. He stretched his bones languidly, chasing away the last bits of sleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
He is at the train station again, he recognizes it very well from all those years ago. He smiles as he sees someone approaching. He wonders who could it be when someone says from behind him.
“Can I sit then?”
He steps out of the cafe and on a impromptu decision apparates to Godric’s hollow instead.
and Draco stops for the moment.
doing the 100 days of drarry drabble on
She is a bonded house elf with wages, designated hours-even though she never listens- and everything else that Hermione has worked so many years for.
, he had said between laughs. Yeah, Harry was. He was out of his mind in love.
He is about to give up when there is a light knock on the door and comes in Hermione’s voice from the other side, asking him if he needs help or not.
Pansy in her signature heels and dress but make it pride colours. Ron, after a lot of coaxing decides on blue trousers, a pink and violet custom made sweater which apparantly Hermione had ordered almost three weeks ago. That makes him beam at her.
“Why isn’t all this taught in Ancient History?” Hermione demands.
“We can bake cookies and then make a pillow fort?” Draco suggests because as usual Draco’s sweet tooth is showing, plus he is great at baking. Cooking on the other hand falls under Harry’s expertise.
“What?” Harry asks, bewildered. Yeah, he didn’t get it at all.
“Alright,” Draco says, the picture of nonchalant and casually swirls his drink and takes a sip. He then smiles at Harry, and says icily, “Have at your peace and quiet, Harry. I won’t stop you.” He looks directly into Harry’s eyes as he throws back the last of his drink before talking again, “
Draco growls lowly in his ear and catches his earlobe between his teeth and gives a soft bite, “You’ll be the death of me.”
“Harry, love. Today marks our ten years and in the past decade, I have learned so many things, I learned kindness and how love feels like and how- what I’m trying to say that in the last decade you have made me a better person each day and made me fall more in love with you. I want to do that for the rest of our lives and even if I don’t really deserve it, I want to make you mine forever. So tell me, Harry James Potter, will you do the honour of marrying me?” Draco finishes with a smile and a single tear rolls down Harry’s cheek.
Not many knew that he wasn’t human any longer. Not quite, not anymore.
“I think you know the answer, don’t you Draco?” Dad asks and Draco sighs before nodding his head.
Contrary to what people might say or think, it’s not Draco who wants to follow all traditions. Merlin knows he has had enough of those in his entire life. But Harry is hell bent on following each and every one of them and well, it’s not like Draco could ever say no to that fucker. And maybe, he likes them just a teeny tiny bit but no one is ever going to know that.
“So this is it, Harry.” Draco says, he slowly lifts his hand and caresses his left cheek, ever so tenderly. “Goodbye,”
never mind that, best not mention that to Harry, “So I used a number of chords in this like D major 7, E minor 7, F sharp minor 7 and G major 7. And there are some more things as well, but ultimately there’s my special lick in this, something which is purely mine. The turn you’ll hear, that is.”
what he supposed to say then?
“Not at all, Harry. You know Teddy loves both of you.” She smiles knowingly before cutting the floocall.
Harry goes home early that day, there’s no one, just the empty house and him. He screams and cries his heart out, just like he had done twenty years back. He wishes to never meet Draco in this life ever again. His heart wouldn’t be able to survive that.
When Harry finally calms down, Draco looks at him and tries to convey everything. It somehow works.
Draco wraps his arms around him and holds him close and suddenly all the tiredness and stress and tension starts to seep out of him.
Harry’s yet to be home, so he decides to hide his ring and take a long bath.
He closes his eyes, hoping the mortifying feeling would go away. It doesn’t. Not even one bit.
“No, Harry. You know it’s true. That’s what the press would always believe no matter what I do, no matter how much good work I do, it will always be there. I have accepted it but that doesn’t mean you have to as well. The implications of being with someone like me would be a lot. I understand, I truly do.” Draco sighs and no no no Draco is understanding this all wrong.
“What do you mean?” Harry questions.
Malfoy finally gestured at his left hand and he say it, a solid but thin band of gold with small diamonds encrusted. It looked perfect. Just what Harry would have wanted for himself. Did he choose the ring himself then? Not detered, he slid the ring out of his finger. It was with some struggle but it came out atlast. But malfoy was still standing with his hand open.
Harry was dressing when he left him in the room, he casts a tempus charm just outside the door. It’s almost noon, Salazar knew why Harry didn’t even bat an eyelid at his late morning.
“Okay me now!” Draco squeals and Harry shakes his head fondly, “I’m bi. And ready to die.” Draco smiles cheekily at his own joke and Harry shakes his head. What did he do to get this bloke in his life?
“Come here, you little miscreant. Let’s finish up the rest of the colours which Uncle Harry bought and we can start making our pillow fort then.” Draco says and Harry can easily hear the playful wrath in his voice at Harry’s name.
“No, Draco. It’s not like that. Just that the media has left me alone for the first time in so many years and I just want to enjoy the peace,” he says the last words quietly.
Well, it was now or never. He really was getting influenced by Harry and the other Gryffindorks.
"Hello Harry." Fred said to him, smiling.
"Harry!" Harry woke to red and George violently shaking his shoulder.
"........" Harry looked at the twins and sighed heavily, sitting at one of the tables.
"Because he began acting weird around her a week before she disappeared. He used to be such a sweet guy, rumor has it is they were in love. But his eyes lost the twinkle in them and began looking at her with hate and anger." She said sadly.
"It is abit late for such a young man to be wonderng about the castle." He smiled.
"As I was saying." He started. The class paid attention to Snape, but Harry was still curious as to whom produced the sound. He looked to his right and found Malfoy's eyes on him.
"Malfoy, why are you on my boat. We aren't exactly on the best of terms. I'm sure one of your fans would love to have you in their boat."
"I shall see you tomorrow at breakfast my sweet." Edward said affectionately to Madeline before kissing her cheek softly and left her to her quarters. He smiled to himself on the way to his room.
"So....What was it you saw?" He asked gently. Harry took a deep breath before he began his long story, starting with His first dream on the train.
Dumbledore led the group to Madam Ravenclaw's portrait. She smiled at the sight of Dumbledore.
"well....what are you doing here?" Fred asked. Snape raised an eyebrow.
"Then let's-"
"Even better, the great Harry actually coming up with something sinister, careful Harry some might think you've become a Wesley." Fred jeered. Harry chuckled and began eating.
"Edward please!" She begged.
"I did not wish to cause him any pain."
"Nothing sir." Harry muttered. Draco slightly flinched and looked in pain before looking away.
“oh, and if we are actually married. I would like a divorce, immediately if possible. You can take whatever you want from my vaults if you want, if money is what you have been after. Reckon you wouldn’t need much, what with your family fortune but I guess some people are never satisfied.” Harry taunted because that’s what he knew best, even if Malfoy looked like he was on the verge of crying.
“Could either of you just call him? He is my Healer so he must be here, right?” He asks hopefully, something in their eyes tells him that he is very very wrong. They are excused from answering him when Zia enters. She is an assistant to Draco and under his wing, one of his best students.
“What for?” Draco inquires as he absent-mindedly plays with Harry’s hair.
Harry wakes up to the scritch scratch of a quill, when he looks out of the open window, the sun just peeking out of the horizon.
It’s true afterall, after their jobs took a turn, neither of them had been visiting Teddy or most of their friends much. They should fix that.
Seriously these two are in so much sync that it terrifies him at times.
“What secre-” Draco starts but suddenly it’s Ron on the line, “Hey mate. Don’t pay them mind, I have never seen these two more drunk. Hermione wanted to call to tell you that everything is in proper order and they have told Harry that tomorrow you have a picnic under the stars, as a gift from them. We’ll meet you after, yes?”
“Marry me, again? It’s our anniversary in 12 days. We can do it then.” Harry suggests, and a small smile seems to tug at Draco’s lips.
“No, Daddy.” Harry says, and Draco pulls back. Harry shoots him one last defiant glare before he walks off to their playroom.
“Hermione reads to know stuff, whether muggle or magical. I read for fun. There’s a difference there. My stories are fiction, hers are of law and Magical theory.”
He looks back at Harry on the bed, his pained expression; still he arches his eyebrow in question.
“Well, it seems we didn’t anticipate a lot of things, love. Starting with how we are going to find new friends because these bastards are ridiculous. The whole lot of them, except maybe Luna.” Draco says and Luna gives them a grateful smile.
“I missed you. Dada said he didn’t know when you be back.” Reg mumbles into his neck, it’s mostly gibberish but Harry understands one and half year old pretty well, as he hugs him still, then he looks into his eyes with slight tears and says seriously, “Dada was so sad,” and then he hugs him again.
“Maybe our coming outs,” Pansy comments from beside Blaise and he looks at Draco for confirmation and he shrugs.
“Draco is telling the truth, Harry. You both are married.” Ron said, and are these people alright? Harry was getting worried.
When was his bestfriend going to tell him this? He sorta feels betrayed but how-
“We made the blue cream and some smeared in his hair so I did it again,” Teddy giggles at that and Harry can’t help but join in as well.
“Yes, of course Harry.”
But oh, Malfoy starts talking again, “Maybe we should do something about that. Maybe that’s what we are lacking, education. Proper education on Wizarding Traditions and Customs. That is the main reason I still hate Muggleborns, not so much as before but still I resent the fact that they just come in our world, know nothing of it and don’t even try. Maybe we should help them, that’s it!” Malfoy’s eyes lit up as if he just solved one of the bigger problems in his life.
“I’m so happy for you, my darling.” She says as she comes closer and hugs him.
“I think I’m ready.” Harry declares suddenly as they lay in each other’s arms in the sunny garden of Grimmauld Place.
“Can Papa read me a story?” Reg asks and Draco nods his head so he looks at Harry who does the same and then they go to Reg’s room.
an earthshattering light comes out of the string and then out of his body as if he is glowing.
And fuck, it feels so safe again. He doesn’t have to care after the world, it seems. The warmth and magic of Draco’s body and core slowly merging with his own as they stand like that, in each other’s embrace for several minutes.
“Well, what is it Potter? I would like to sleep.” Draco states, his voice ice cold and a slight shiver runs down Harry’s spine as he remembers the last time he had been like this. It had been after Harry had gone on a date so many years back, before he came to his senses that is.
“what can i do?” harry asks softly, like he knows that any louder and draco will shatter completely.
Harry takes a calming breath and goes down on his knees. “This is what I’m talking about,” he says and fiddles with his jacket and produces a black box, a ring box and was he ……
The gates opens to him without any sort of hindrance. Just as he was going to knock on the door, Mipsy opens it and pokes her head out.
“Okay, I have some experience with the guitar,” Hermione offers and he is grateful to have her in his life.
“so does he know then? Doesn’t look like it,” Malfoy claimed, and Harry wanted to strangle him because he was aware that the
“Draco, please. Don’t do this.” Harry pleads and Draco’s eyes flash dangerously.
Harry had popped the question soon afterwards and that’s how he is here at the altar, taking his vows which he is going to uphold for the rest of his life.
“It’s the bloody first day today. What on this god forsaken Earth are you even studying?” Harry asks, head still on his pillow.
“the family ring.” Malfoy coldly stated. Oh, he then noticed the Malfoy family ring on his tiny finger of his right hand. He practically threw that into Malfoy’s hands. Who wanted to be even near that thing?
“Ron and Blaise will be here shortly so you need not worry about it, darling. We’ll be alright on our own till then.” Hermione says back and Pansy adds,“Draco never comes home early so you needn’t worry about it.”
Another time, they had been walking side by side on the pavement and there had been a old woman sitting a bit far away, Draco had inconspicuously taken out some notes and had stopped exactly infront of the woman to tie his shoes, Harry had pretended to be bothered while he looked ahead. When he looked back, the woman was smiling at them with a bundle of muggle notes in her hands.
“Oh I’m so sorry-”
They all congratulate them as hugs and kisses are exchanged. Harry is grinning throughout the night, even as they make their way back home.
That’s how Andy finds them, when she comes back in the middle of the night. Her friend is fine and spending the night at the hospital, so she came back for some rest.
He was right, of course but not entirely. Just as Draco finished the book he spelled it back to go to it’s place and then, the prat summoned another one.
“Can I have some more cookies?” Teddy asks through a yawn. It’s almost 9 o'clock, but they hadn’t been able to put him to sleep still.
Harry can’t help but move forward and hug him tightly. He is crying himself as Draco tries to wretch himself free.
He apparates just outside of the Manor gates, after all these years it’s fairly easy to enter. The Manor has transformed drastically, and Narcissa and surprisingly, Lucius’s warm welcome behaviour had helped immensely.
“Don’t remember really, twenty years I think. If not more, time has been slow.” Draco replies wistfully.
There’s a pin drop silence around their table as Harry finally announces that he is bi and infact engaged to Draco. Draco, for his part, just smiles at them and squeezes Harry’s waist reassuringly.
“You mean anyone who even shows a slight interest?” Draco quips and gets swatted on his head for that.
“Alright. Thank you, Harry.”
“Please don’t go, please,” Harry says just as Draco gets up to dress.
“Well, I guess not.” Harry replies, cluelessly.
He calls for Draco as he makes way towards their bedroom. The lazy bastard that he is, Draco just grunts in reply while still lying on the bed.
“It’s a cafe and bar, of sorts. They provide a mixture of normal drinks but add alcohol to it. You should try the vodka and peach drink. It’s absolutely perfect.” Pansy answers as she calls over a waiter.
“Draco…did you…visit my parents yesterday?” Harry asks as they keep their coats.
“You won’t be able to tempt me. You should try something else, Potter.” Draco replies but Harry hears him stand up and come to his bed anyway.
“Well, I’m just going as an ally. Mostly for Ron but all of you are going to be there anyways so I took a day off.” Hermione says and wow, Hermione and off days. That’s almost unheard of.
Harry could still hear some words ringing in his mind. Child? He had a child? He was a dad? He had to-
“Nothing.” All of them reply in unison so Harry narrows his eyes at them but no one breaks. He huffs and says, “I didn’t anticipate this somehow.”
“Harry, anyone with or without eyes knows about the both of you. Maybe not the press but definitely anyone who has been in the same room as you both for more than, say, ten minutes.” Hermione explains and Ron snorts beside her.
“Oh,” Hermione says and nods her head.
Teddy is already at him so Harry kneels down and hugs his little guy tightly, “I missed you too, pup.” He says against his messy black curls.
Nothing to think over or anything. So what they were just fuck buddies? Fuck buddies can provide support in extreme cases and yeah, that’s it. He should get up and see what’s Harry making. Maybe he would get some? He stayed the night, Harry should offer breakfast and be gracious and all that.
“Alright, both of you. Stop laughing at my expense. I know the irony of the situation.” Ron says at last.
“Yes Daddy?”
“Tell him I know what I’m doing. Well somewhat. Do you think he will say yes? What if…what if he doesn’t want to marry me? What will I do then, Mum? Honestly, I have no idea but I hope I don’t have to think about that. I shall get going now, it’s late and Draco is waiting.” He caresses the grave once fondly, says his goodbye and apparates away.
As they pull apart, someone behind them mutters, “Fucking finally!” And then all their friends are there, yelling out congratulations in various degrees as they come out from wherever they were hiding.
This is what feels like being at home.
And Harry? Harry continues to live on forever, his beloved by his side.
“Indeed, we should. What about an exclusive vacation to some exotic place? You think they would like that?” Draco suggests. It’s the least he could do after such an wonderful arrangement.
Malfoy’s eyes flashed angrily before the icy facade was back on, “i didn’t want dissolve the marriage. I have no obligation to return the rings. And even if I did, I won’t. My Harry gave them to me afterall.” Malfoy said coldly, but his voice broke at the end.
“Harry and Draco are dating!” Zabini yells, and the whole common room comes to a still for exactly one second as they all look over at Zabini before they all turn back to their respective works, some even rolling their eyes. He hears mutters about it
“So which poor lad is it?” Uncle Padfoot asks directly.
“Finally got their heads out of their arses and are in a heavy snog session which, trust us you wouldn’t want to witness.” Hermione answers and both of them whistle.
He takes Harry’s hand and points towards the sky, slowly making an imaginary line with their hands.
“Yeah fuck.”
“Yes, Mipsy I’m aware that Draco isn’t here. I’m here to meet Lucius and Narcissa actually.” He explains, Mipsy nods her head and vanishes with a small pop, only to return twenty seconds later, and asking Harry to follow her to the parlor.
“Gran asked to be good, but Uncle Harry I’m always good.” Teddy says with his puppy eyes and Harry couldn’t help but agree.
“Anything you have to say?” Draco asks, he knows it’s his last chance but…
“You too, son,” Dad adds as he looks at Draco who beams back before nodding enthusiastically.
His body lights up and he can literally taste all of the excess magic that his body emanates out, he sees it split into two before one half returns to his own and the other gets inside Draco. They lock eyes for a flash before it blacks out completely.
“Yeah, I know that we don’t usually…that this isn’t a- I just can’t be alone tonight. It was- I had to kill one of the criminals and I just didn’t think I would have any more blood on my hands and it’s just making-” he rambles so Draco gives in.
“It’s just that…the press, they will be out for blood and you know what type of stories they will be printing when they-” he stops abruptly because maybe the words won’t be perceived in the way he wants them to.
“And whoever said that I’ll marry you. That too for the second time. One time was enough, don’t you think?” Draco teases, and he knows he did the right thing this once.
“What do you mean by someone like me?”
When he stops infront of his parents grave, he finds fresh flowers there already.
They talk a bit more, standing there about Harry’s life before Harry suggests getting coffee. Draco hesitates for a second before agreeing.
“Please,”
Harry leans forward and slowly captures his lips with his own and Draco promptly forgets the rest.
“Can we decorate them?” Teddy asks tentatively as Draco finally sets down an entire tray of chocolate cookies on the kitchen counter.
There was nothing tender about Draco Malfoy, everyone knew that, everyone confirmed that, everyone who wasn’t one Harry Potter.
“I love you, Draco Malfoy.” He says into Draco’s ear.
Hermione and Pansy leave him to make preparations for the party. He is supposedly the one who is hosting and throwing the party but those two girls have done literally all the work and have refused to take credit for it. Just some wine from the Black family’s private stocks and Harry is more than happy to give a bottle or two. He has plenty, and then there’s the Malfoy’s private stores as well, which is what he mostly drinks. Seldom he needs to use the ones of his own.
“Well…” Draco starts, then promptly stops then he grins at Harry and says, “It’s going to a bloody big shock. Imagine thinking their Savior is a perfect little heterosexual to suddenly getting to know that he is not only bisexual but also engaged to a bloke who happens to be his former rival, ex-Death Eater and is doing dubious work at the moment.”
“Hello, love. What a pleasant surprise!” Mother says as he enters.
as if it’s a very common thing to carry around a fucking battle axe around in the Eighth Year common room.
“Pray tell why you are sitting here examining one?” Harry asks as they come and stand infront of him. Ron then notices Hermione sitting in the chair infront of Malfoy, effectively making her almost invisible to anyone who enters.
“Mipsy is here to greet Harry Potter. Who does Harry Potter like to meet? Master Draco isn’t here today.”
“I’m sorry, Pans,” he apologizes but she waves him off.
The lady smiles at him again, not a single sign in her face saying that she is frustrated or annoyed that Draco took such a long time.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And mine.” Ginny says possesively beside her and kisses her cheek. “I’m lesbian, as my dear ex just pointed out not five minutes ago.” She smirks at him and he flips her two fingers.
“ugh, you’re so annoying. its January 2001, unless i was unconsious for more than two weeks, then it would be february 2001.” harry replied, and the fuck was he alone? that too with malfoy to keep him company. he was about to ask just that when malfoy said-
“Where’s Draco?” That’s the first thing that comes out of his mouth. Hermione looks pained, so he turns to Ron and he has an almost identical expression. And then all of it crashes down on him.
Ron and Hermione share a look. Harry always hated when they did that, especially after they got together.
“Do I need to repeat myself? Or are you going to be a good boy?”
Harry had been adamant that Draco understood this.
I made my way back to my room and got into bed, even though I knew I wouldn’t be sleeping any time soon. All I thought about was Harry, his touch, his hugs, that kiss. The way he looked at me, how he smiled.
prisoner, you may not -.”
“Do it.” He whispered.
“Now that I can do” I replied and grabbing him by the arm we carried on walking to the village, our friends ahead of us and lost in their own couple-world.
Draco simply stuck his tongue out at him.
We stood in silence for a while, drinking our tea and stealing glances at each other. If I wasn’t so nervous it would have been rather cute.
Pansy giggled. “Now go Draco, we’ll sort out your room for tonight.” Her eyes glinted in a very Pansy-way and as quick as that my suspicion arose.
“Let’s go then” he said. He leant in for a quick kiss and we Apparated back to Hogsmeade.
“Right, well we’re off!” Potter stood up abruptly and wrapped his cloak around him. “Have fun kids, see you all at breakfast?”
You would think that I had stabbed Potter if you heard the gasp he let out. I had no idea what he was thinking, but her suddenly turned beet red.
“Graceful, Malfoy” he snickered at me.
The whisper froze him to the ground. Draco turned to his mother with more fear than he ever thought possible.
I smiled fondly at him, of course he would wish happiness to a stranger. “I hope he is too.”
“How could I not, you look angelic when you sleep.”
“OK fine, I’ll go, stop manhandling me woman!” I shove at her until she lets go, smiling triumphantly. “One drink, and I’ll be coming back. I need my beauty sleep, you know that.”
I wordlessly passed her the dictionary, and she hummed in thanks.
“I’m ready” Harry was the first to say.
“Well it’s not like I’m parading it am I? I don’t even know what I am, and I don’t really need the Prophet to start reporting my shit like that!”
, never to him…
Harry just laughed and turned to open the portrait, stepping back to allow me out first and we started walking towards the Entrance Hall. I looked at Harry and saw a smile playing on his lips and I asked him “what are you thinking?”
“About time” he said, and fucking smiled at me.
Harry faked an offended gasp and looked up at Draco. “You would
“We do darling, just one drink and we’ll let you off” Pansy agreed.
“Breathe, Malfoy” his voice said. “Try to slow down your breaths.”
I grabbed my wand and padded over to Harry’s room and pressed an ear to his door. Silence too. The bastard better not be sleeping.
Gripping his head I delved back into a messy kiss, and slowly started grinding against him. His grip on my hips tightened and I couldn’t help the needy noises coming out of my mouth. With a particularly loud groan I tilted my head backwards and Harry’s lips immediately went to my throat.
“Why?”
“-or three” Blaise interjected.
“I want to have your babies!” Pansy practically moaned, and the three of us roared with laughter.
I did wonder though, was Potter serious on his flirting or was he having a bit of fun? Was he actually interested in something, or was I clutching wands? It was too easy to imagine him being interested in me, Merlin knows how many nights I fantasised about Potter opening my bedroom door without knocking, closing it behind himself and stopping my shout of indignation with a kiss that left me breathless. Him and I clutching at each other, desperate to get our clothes of, us stumbling to my bed, still touching and grabbing and tasting each other…
for the War! Don’t be an insufferable
Harry and Draco reluctantly pulled away from each other. “We’re here, Hermione, be right there!” Harry called out.
“’Your’ team Potter? Might I remind you that you’re no longer considered a Gryffindor?”
I didn’t know why I felt so comfortable talking with Harry, especially considering I hadn’t told anyone about my summer, not even my best friends. But Harry… I guess I believed he understood me better than most. He knew what it was like to be hounded and judged by the press – I remembered what had happened in fourth and fifth year. Harry understood what it was like to be hated by the public, and knowing that helped me open myself to him.
We were both quiet for a while, though it wasn’t entirely uncomfortable. I had the distinct feeling that he wanted to say something, but I didn’t pressure him. It was hard to ignore my base, Slytherin instincts to nag him until he spilt all his secrets.
“What in Merlin’s name do you think you’re doing, boy?” Father hissed at him, teeth bare, eyes flaring with a madness that Draco was not going to miss. “I am going to
Harry’s jaw practically hit the floor. What the fucking fuck was going on?!
I bristled slightly at the mention of the Weaslette name, but ignored it for now, there was absolutely no need for me to get jealous of some red-haired harlot when I was the one currently on a date with Harry. Instead I went back to the menu and decided to have half a chicken with a side of salad and a portion of grains and nuts. I put my menu down and looked around, trying to make eye contact with a waiter to take our order.
“Well, yeah.” He seemed to blush a bit, and seeing Harry both giggle and blush did things to my stomach that made me feel both sick and elated. “So ask away!”
that Malfoy will not hesitate to call for Voldemort if he realised who was tied in his home.
Ron grasped Draco’s shoulder again and gave him a one armed hug, Hermione reaching around Ron to also hug Draco. “We’re with you little ferret” Ron said, grinning at Draco’s eye roll.
Harry snorted. “We actually do have all day love, what’s your rush?”
“I’m not saying it’s bad” he frowned at me. “Just confusing you know? I like girls, since always, but I think I like guys too, or at least one and, I don’t know, it’s so confusing. I never really had a chance to think of stuff like that you know, thanks to a bat-shit crazy fucker I never had a normal childhood or time to even think about these things, and now there’s this infuriating, annoying prat who I can’t stop thinking about, and all I know is that I’m not sure what to do about it or how to know if he likes me back.”
“I completely forgot, I’m so sorry” he blurted.
Harry cut off his blabbing with a kiss, effectively silencing his complaints. He wanted to show Draco with the kiss the pain this situation was causing him, how he wished things would be different.
Draco had woken up and caught Harry staring at him. He raised an eyebrow suggestively.
By the time we got to the pub, our friends were already sitting at a round table. Pansy and Hermione both gave me a mischievous look, which I ignored to walk straight to the bar with Potters. He got us each a glass of Firewhiskey, and we turned to sit at our table, and that’s when I noticed that the remaining two empty seats were together. Which explained the mischievous looks. I rolled my eyes and sat on the one next to Blaise, Potter taking the one next to Weasley.
Harry’s hand trailed up and down Draco’s thigh, gently caressing, slowly teasing. “Well my love, I know how much you enjoy being touched and teased, so I would start there.” He looked down quickly and saw Draco’s erection slowly filling up his trousers. “Would you look at that, it’s already working.”
“And why am I obliged to accompany you?”
That was the first time, Harry had seen Draco Malfoy being tender towards someone who actually knew him. The first and the last time.
“Papaaaa,” Reg cries out as he launches himself into his arms and it grounds him. It gives him peace and then enters Draco. He looks proper as always, no one would be able to tell that he is messed up. But no one is Harry Malfoy-Potter.
“Godric, you are worse than Hermione. Why don’t you come to bed?” Harry asks with hope.
“I love you,” Harry says softly as he caresses his cheek. Draco leans on his hand and mouths the words back.
Then comes the Wizarding Vows and as Luna binds their hands together with a magical strings they recite the vows again as they take the oath.
“It’s Draco,” Harry says and at Uncle Padfoot’s dubious expression he elaborates, “Draco Malfoy.”
Draco had been one of the most useful spies in the War. And the most wonderful boyfriend as well. It had been hell to keep it a secret from anyone and everyone. Even still, because now it just felt intrusive to both of them. This relationship was something ethereal to the both of them and it just felt too private still to share it with the world, when they didn’t have much time to themselves, almost a year into the relationship.
“Actually I’m in a bit of a hurry right now. I wanted the Malfoy signet ring.” Draco says, getting to the point quickly.
Kreacher was cooking behind him, he actually looked happy these days, getting to serve not one but two people. One of whom was a direct descendant from the Noble House of Black. He didn’t even grumble at Harry’s requests these days and wasn’t that a feat.
“what about them?” Malfoy inquired and Hermione asked at the same time Hermione cried out, “harry, can you please
“You are still not forgiven, just so you know.” Draco says and Harry doesn’t know what he shall do. He’ll do anything, murder if he has to.
“Oh he won the first one. He said you both were in a actual relationship. I said you were just tired of fights and were being civil for our sake. Everyone had different answers.” Neville answers and wow they got
He can’t help it, it’s funny. They are both idiots, utter idiots. Harry looks very much like he wants to join Draco in his amusement but he holds off for ami minute, looking slightly put out. Then he joins in as well.
, he had said at last before standing up and slowly disappearing into the sunset.
“Before wands were created, and that was about two or even three thousand years ago. Weapons were what we used. Muggles got the idea from us, we used weapons not only to kill but also to channel our magic through it. Myth is that Battle Axe among a few others were thrown over hundreds of miles to kill the enemy. To create illusions and as such. Before proper spells were made and everything else. Ask Weasley if you don’t believe me, he would know.” And all three sets of eyes are upon him. Damn Malfoy for bringing up ancient history.
After the promise is made, they both go to tuck in Teddy. It doesn’t even take more than five minutes for that kid to fall asleep.
“I thought you forgot,” Draco says and laughs wetly against him.
“Would you like to engrave something on the inside?”
“I don’t reckon so, it’s a…it’s something I made, inspired by ‘Get You’ by Daniel Caesar.” Draco doesn’t say more, knowing Harry would neither be interested nor he would understand.
“Well then, Harry. Do promise to visit again and soon.” Mum says and gives him a sad, tight smile.
It takes him five more years before he is ready. Before that, neither he nor Draco contact each other. He doesn’t interfere, he doesn’t stalk him, doesn’t even keep a track. Because he promised himself he wouldn’t, not until he was ready.
Once they are seated, Harry asks, “So you’re with Astoria then?”
He smiles as he makes way towards the banquet hall where the party would be held. He whistles softly as he takes in the final decorations. He had helped selecting everything but Hermione and Pansy have done it again with their skills and creativity.
“We have a secreeeeeet,” Pansy sing-songs in the background.
“Wait, so almost all the heads of the Ministry are not going to be there tomorrow?” Blaise asks and six of them turn to glare at him but it’s Harry who replies.
He apparates to the Maya Magal in London, it’s apparantly the best place to get engagement rings and both Pansy and Hermione vouch for it.
He roams around the house in order to find Draco, finally making way into their bedroom where he is sitting with his hands on his lap, waiting for Harry.
Exactly 2 days and 17 hours after Malfoy had dissolved their marriage and left, Harry’s memory came back. The impact of it was so bad that he was screaming his lungs out by the time a nurse came to check and she immediately called for Healer Malfoy-Potter.
“How do you- nevermind. You can’t tell anyone but well it’s Draco Malfoy,” Harry confesses and Uncle Moony starts laughing.
“Uhm, I’m sorry did I miss something?” He asks incredulously.
At this point, Draco has given up any pretense that his erection is going to go down anytime soon. It’s his bestfriend’s engagement party for fuck’s sake and here he is walking around with a hard-on where anyone who is anyone in the Wizarding World is easily able to see him like this. Harry is so fucking fucked. And just then he looks up to find Harry coming his way again! Everyone just thinks he can’t get enough of his new fiance, if only that was the case.
sound before he slowly leans forward and suddenly he sitting sideways in Malfoy’s lap. Ron might have been okay with Harry and Malfoy dating but that doesn’t mean he wants to see them doing that! He likes it as much as Harry likes watching him and Hermione.
“I have to, for both of us perhaps. Find me someday when you are unashamed of us, and ready to face the world for me, for us. If fate wishes, we’ll be together again. Until then, au revoir.” Draco gives him a small smile before he leans forward and presses a soft kiss one to his lips, another to his forehead before he moves away.
Its about 6pm when he leaves the graveyard and goes to pick up the ring.
“So you’re all okay with this? Us being together? And me being bi?” Harry asks, just to make sure.
“Dracoooo,” Hermione slurs and that astonishes Draco because Hermione never drinks a lot. Just a glass of wine or maybe two mugs of lager but not so much to get drunk. Just ‘happy tipsy’ she had called it when he had asked years ago.
“Did you just-” Malfoy starts saying, at the same time Harry says, “Fuck, I said that out loud, didn’t I?”
Harry moans into the kiss loudly and slowly they pull apart. Both of them panting, Harry more so than Draco.
He had tilted his head slightly and raised his slowly to his cheek but stopping just before they touched.
And he had asked for a divorce and…and Draco had readily accepted it, as he said….was his faith. And shit shit shit, Reg. What had he told Reg? He needs to grovel at Draco’s feet, hopefully he would forgive Harry. And- he can’t even think about it anymore.
“well, I would be going really blunt now because reg would be wanting answers soon.” Malfoy motioned his hands around as if whatever he said made sense and who was this reg person even?
“So who was it?” It’s Pansy who breaks the silence.
i hope you like it!
“Girls nah!” Harry exclaims and Ginny frowns and exclaims, “Hey!”
. Now who is it?”
“That was wonderful, Draco.” Harry praises and smiles at him. It pretty much lights up Draco’s whole being.
“Was planning on making a attack on the Ministry tomorrow. Would definitely be successful.” Blaise replies instead.
“In here, Hazza,” Uncle Moony calls from the kitchen and he heads that way.
“Sure, mate.” Ron shrugs and Hermione starts to get up so as to provide them some privacy, no doubt but Draco has no problem with both of them knowing and is currently with his friends announcing the news on the other side of the common room.
“Uncle Padfoot! Uncle Moony!” He calls loudly as he steps into the living room. They should be at home, otherwise he could always just steal a piece of chocolate and let Uncle Moony figure out who dared to steal them.
He opens the box and Draco looks up at him, “Yes, you idiot. I was planning on asking you tonight but no you always have to compete me.” Harry huffs and then Draco starts laughing.
“And you have the ring?” Hermione questions as she sets down her wine glass. Seriously is this a cafe or a pub?
“So, how have you been?” Draco asks as they both sidestep away from the door and stand at the store window.
shines through everything at last, crystal clear- thanks to Fred and George’s handiwork. He gets down on one knee and takes out the ring box and holds it open.
“nothing of it. Regulus is my son and he’ll be known as such from now on. I would like to see you try otherwise.” Malfoy basically growled. Then he gave one mock salute to Harry and turned his back to them and strode out of the room.
It happens again, of course it does. But this time it’s Draco asking Harry to stay back. He lost a patient, they couldn’t have been saved, he had tried everything. But still he thought it to be his own fault.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was gone for almost five days, it aches his heart how much he was missed by his little love and how much he is loved. He locks eyes with Draco then, who has the mask set in place properly again. He arches his eyebrow at Harry, a silent question that he can very well understand. He pleads back silently as well to keep it until they are alone. Draco gets it.
“I’m sorry that I didn’t believe you or my friends or even my own self, I should have.” Harry sighs and rubs his eyes under glasses.
“Because I love him, I know it can’t be as simple as that but that’s the gist of it. I love your son with my whole being. I can’t imagine a day where I can’t see his face or without his insults which have somehow become a constant as well. I tried to find the many reasons for which I should deserve to marry him, I can’t find one. But I want to, I want to be deserved enough to marry Draco Malfoy. I want to make him happy for the rest of his life and I want to do this right for once, that’s why here I’m asking permission for his hand because even though it doesn’t matter nowadays. Draco loves tradition and for him, this is of great significance and I want everything to be right this time.” Harry finishes and when he looks over at them, because he had said most of that looking at the carpet, Narcissa’s eyes a bit glassy and Lucius who never shows emotion, is actually beaming at him.
Draco apparates directly inside the Manor Gates after picking up the ring.
“How do you know it’s a bloke?” Harry questions but Uncle Padfoot just snorts.
“Yes, right about everything can be non-alcoholic or purely alcoholic as well. The mixtures are just out speciality.”
“Yes, you did.” Ron says and pats Harry lightly on his shoulder.
“As I have always said, it’s a secret Potter.” Draco chuckles softly at that and Harry joins him.
“Goodbye, darling.” He says as he kisses Pansy’s cheeks and takes Harry’s hand. They bid their goodbyes as they walk towards the appration point.
“Good morning,” Draco greets back as he stands awkwardly in the kitchen, not really sure what to do with himself.
“My turn,” Harry says and takes his hand in his and delicately places the ring there.
“Yeah that’s right, Ron. Who was the bloke or non binary person who finally made opened your eyes towards the other genders.” Blaise inquires as well.
Harry leans in slowly towards Malfoy’s mouth and Ron can practically cut the tension with a knife, he doesn’t want to witness this.
“So when are you going away then?” Draco asks somewhat petulantly.
“i’ll contact hermione and ron. just- sit here and try not to break anything or get out of bed.”
“I’m so sorry to throw this upon you both. I know how busy you both are,” she says as she gets up from where she had been kneeling infront of Teddy.
“What is it about?” Well, that is easy.
“Which part really? Because I had known Harry wasn’t straight for a long time.” Ginny adds in and Harry levels her a look.
'No, not here-' his train of thought was cut off when his vision went black.
"......It's fine potter..."
"Mister malfoy, I do know that veela laws protect you from any serious punishment, but I do have to ask you refrain from attacking any of my students, even though they may say vulgar things. I know my asking of you won't do much, but I do have to ask you to consider it." Dumbledoor stated.
Harry found himself in the Forbidden Forest, in the dark of night with only the light of the full moon.
"HARRY DON'T!" He heard someone below yell, but Harry didn't care. He had it within his reach. Harry flew up higher, hand out to grab it.
"......Yes sir, I just thought I ought to be prepared." Harry lied. Snape raised an eyebrow.
"It is not fine Harry, I will not allow them to treat you so harshly. Damn muggles." Draco growled, causing himself to cough harshly. Harry softly rubbed Draco's chest.
"Of course." The portrait said. The twins and Harry quietly walked away as they left the weeping portrait.
"I shall keep it in mind." Draco said coldly.
"Agreed." George said as Harry put the cloak up and looked at his map.
A crowed hallway.
"None of your business, Malfoy." George said.
"No sir." He said through clenched teeth.
"Are you sure that's a good idea Harry?" Fred asked. Harry smiled.
"Thank you. For everything." He said smiling as he waved his hand and opened the door to let the others come in.
"What to do about Draco?" George finished.
"I'm sure, I remember my dream as if it were this morning." Harry said stirring the potion.
"Yeah, as ready as I'll every be." He said walking down the hallway. He yawned and rubbed his eyes. The twins looked at eachother than at Harry.
"You've been acting strange. We want to know why." George stated, the twins crossing their arms and giving Harry the big brother look.
"This way." Harry said quietly looking at the twins, and headed down a hall. A few steps down and Harry noticed a pair of footprints on the map.
Harry froze and turned his head to the side. It was only him and the twins in the hallways, which caused Harry to furrow his brows in confusion.
Draco said flying to the castle.
"This turns the person who ingests it into stone." Dumbledore said amused. Harry and the twins looked at eachother shocked.
"Well we took Care of Magical Creatures, this year and what do you know, one of the first things we learned was Veelas." George said.
"Let us head to professor Dumbledoor's office, Harry can rest there, and we may explain your odd behavior." Snape said to Draco.
"You followed me?" He asked. Draco looked away from Harry.
Harry closed the door and turned around, looking at the giggling twins in front of him.
"You-...you want to be...be friends?" Harry asked.
"Come." Snape said as he led the twins out first. Draco rubbed Harry's back and began leading him out.
"...I didn't want to worry you-"
It's been two weeks since Harry and Draco have started dating, and in those days Harry has been noticing the glares and dirty looks from Draco's fanclub. But what seemed to bother him most was the fact that there were some.....sexual looks towards him as well.
"Everything is because of these bloody books!" Harry yelled.
"What's the matter potter, never seen a veela before?" He asked as he flapped his wings and flew him out the hole.
He finds him in the same sixth floor bathroom, with the help of Marauder’s Map.
Harry frowns at the words in the sky for a moment, then opens his mouth to say something to Draco and freezes when he sees him on knee.
“Cousin! Let’s have an adventure! Like like the ones Uncle Harry had.” Teddy exclaims just as soon as Andromeda apparates out. Really this kid was going to
doing the 100 days of drarry drabble on
“Yes, exactly. And bad boys don’t get rewards. They are punished. But you already knew this, didn’t you? You love being punished.” Draco asks and Harry looks away in embarrassment, “Aww, look at this. He is embarrassed.” Draco scoffs.
“You mean
All is good, afterall.
“Just want to please you.” Harry gasps out and turns around. He takes Draco’s face in his hands and kisses him. He licks and bites his bottom lip twice before pressing in, asking for entry. Draco complies with complaint and lets Harry kiss him however he wants.
When they finally pull apart, Draco’s eyes are red and he is still hiccuping.
“C'mon love, it’s more like two minutes.” Ron explains and Hermione starts snickering. Harry actually needs new bestfriends and soon. These ones just won’t do anymore, he decides.
“No thank you, Pans. I have to go back to my boyfriend who shouldn’t even suspect that I have been anywhere but work today. Do you have anything non-alcoholic?” He directs the last question to the waiter who has come.
“it’s no use stopping the inevitable, Mione. He would know eventually and I rather face it myself firsthand. Would be the best route for my heart, you know?” Malfoy said sadly. As if he had something to be sad about, Harry scoffed mentally at that. And what ths fuck?
They steer back into what they will be wearing and which type of makeup would look the best.
“Yes, but I’m interested in you,” Harry replies earnestly and it takes all of Draco’s self control to not blush-he doesn’t think he succeeds much. Well, at least it’s dark so hopefully Harry doesn’t notice it.
and how as
As soon as Harry hears Draco call out his goodbye, he takes out his notepad from under the socks in the drawer and checks everything he needs to do in order for everything to be perfect tomorrow.
It wasn’t different in such a manner that normal people, the public basically, could see it. No, it was different in its subtle ways.
Draco hasn’t been more confused in his entire life. He gives Harry a questioning look.
Pansy is the first one to reach them and she engulfs Draco in a hug and murmurs something in his ear which makes Draco swat her arm. She is onto Harry when Hermione arrives, closely followed by Ron, Blaise, Luna and Ginny.
“Well Potter, I always thought you were all talk. It seems you’re just proving me right.” Malfoy says and rolls his eyes. And that was a fucking wonderful tactic, although Ron isn’t sure Harry got it.
He thinks as he turns around,
“Yes, we agreed to keep it low, until the press had calmed down from the breakup. It’s been four months since they stopped printing about you and Weaselette. Don’t you think it’s time?” Draco inquires.
“No Zia, please don’t cry. I’ll… I’ll talk to him, alright? Don’t do anything just yet? I fucked up real bad this time, just let me leave and I’ll try my best.” Harry pleads and Zia hiccups softly. She checks his quickly with red eyes and deems him free to leave.
“Yes I know. I’m- I’m proposing Harry tomorrow.” He announces and he is confused by their identical expressions of surprise and then repressed mirth. He didn’t except that.
It had been reckless as anything for Draco. There were so many people in for Bill’s wedding and the Death Eaters were off somewhere preparing and Draco had slipped out unnoticed from the Manor and apparated directly inside Harry’s room, because he was tuned into the wards. All members of the Order were. Harry had been alone at that time.
“Merlin, it’s good to see you. How long has it been?” Harry asks, even if it breaks his heart; even if he knows that today marks twenty years since…since they-
“You do realise that when I say come out, I mean about our relationship as well?” Harry asks because surely Draco can’t be-
“I can’t, Harry. I just can’t! They are out for my blood as is and you want me to-” Draco sobs, it’s the first time Harry had seen him cry like this or cry at all. He is always so prim and proper, and here he is with his hair disheveled, red rimmed eyes and splotchy face.
“Aww, sweetheart. Maybe don’t mess with these two then. One of the most successful business man who is so accomplished in hexes and jinxes and our Minister of Magic. Deadly couple these both.”
the walls broke at Draco’s whispered use of Harry’s given name.
“No, just something light and simple would do. He doesn’t like heavy jewels or jewels for that matter.” Draco says, belatedly realising that he used the masculine pronoun instead of the neutral one, Hermione had told him that Muggles didn’t always see eye to eye with same gender relationships like Wizards and Witched did.
If anyone was ever asked, how would you describe Draco Malfoy? There would be so so many answers: rude, obnoxious, posh, git, pointy, and numerous more. What they would never is: tender.
“Malfoy- Draco don’t be sorry. It’s alright,” he moves forward and caresses Draco’s cheek in  such a loving manner that he swoons, “i understand.” Harry gives him a tight smile before squeezing his hand. One. Twice. Before he goes back to his food and Draco feels a ten ton weight being lifted off his chest.
“Yes sure.” Draco replies, he instantly knows what he wants. In the end, the lady- Lara tells him to come back in two hours for the ring to be ready and he thanks her and gets going.
When they finally arrive there, Andy is telling Teddy to be a good boy and not trouble him or Draco.
“I still don’t understand why he just did that, why did he listen to you and divorce you?” Hermione inquires because of course she doesn’t understand.
“Because, Granger, everyone knows all this. All purebloods and halfbloods have been raised along these stories. It’s not our fault that nobody thought about the Muggleborns.” Malfoy’s going to get hit any moment, Ron is sure of it by the expression Hermione is sporting.
but Harry can’t be sure.
“Hello, my loves.” Harry greets them as he enters the kitchen as last and both of them turn to smile at him.
was him.
There’s a pleasant breeze blowing and the place is absolutely perfect,
“Hmmm, it’s just six in the morning though.” Draco replies and gives him a sleepy smile. “I’m nervous. They all thought I was- what if-” Draco starts confessing but Harry’s hearing none of it as he shushes him with a whispered
“I missed you too, my reggie-teggie. But guess what I won’t be going anywhere now and we would have so much fun, won’t we? We’ll ride on the broom again all around the house while Dada goes to work, innit?” Harry asks and Reg beams at him, “And I’ll try to make sure Dada isn’t sad anymore, yeah?” And he nods enthusiastically.
His already flowing magic, now flooded through his veins and once a highly attuned to magic person- Harry forgot the word- from the Mysteries had stumbled upon him by mere accident. They had stopped in their tracks as they looked at him with wide eyes. They hadn’t said a thing, he got to know it from Hermione afterwards.
He makes goes to the Wizarding Jewelry Place first and asks for the ring.
“If anyone even imagines thinking something of that sort, they’ll be facing me.” Harry promises.
“I’ll start then?” Pansy suggests and before anyone can respond she is talking again, “I’m a raging lesbian, if there was ever doubt to my homosexuality then I would like to apologise.” She smirks at them and all of them laugh loudly at that.
“So that’s a yes then?” Draco asks, it doesn’t hurt to be sure. Harry looks at him with are-you-actually-this-daft expression, usually Harry is on the receiving end of that expression.
“I still don’t like you going away from me,” Draco grumbles as Harry takes his washroom kit and places a soft kiss on Draco’s lips. And then he gives Draco a tight smile before leaving the room entirely.
after that, they start saying over each other’s house more often. slowly, gradually comes a day when there hasn’t been a night in the whole month whenthey haven’t been in each other’s arm the whole night. they don’t even have sex all of the time, it’s fucking weird and draco is clueless as fuck.
“Oh, just Harry and Draco sleeping on the same bed, somewhat snuggling.” Ron says as if it’s a very normal thing and happens everyday in his life.
“Draco!” Harry exclaims, looking at the man who stole his heart all those years ago.
“Oh? I have something to ask as well. You can go first though,” Harry offers and smiles charmingly at him.
“Can’t very well go around saying my actual job, can I now? It’s better for Hermione, she just says she works in what was it? Secretary to some unknown person who did some useless job. As if the greatest witch of our time would do something so mundane and insignificant.” Draco scoffs and he is right, Draco can’t really say where he works in the Ministry because people would check and that would be troublesome. So he just does
“It’s fine, love. Don’t get worked up. We did infact, vow to share everything. I consider this my honour.” Draco squeezes his hand lightly and really, what did he do to deserve this thoughtful and wonderful husband, again?
“Of course you don’t. You have no bloody clue, and you know what you don’t need to. You can fuck off whenever you want and I won’t stop you. Who the fuck would I be, wasn’t that what you said?” Draco rages on, then he says it again, it comes out utterly broken, “Who the fuck, indeed?” And then he sobs, openly, all masks gone.
as far as harry was concerned, he had last played in hogwarts, although he did still participate in some of the impromptu Weasley weekly sunday matches but he doesn’t think Draco knew about that. harry’s words seemed to stop malfoy in his tracks. he frowned at harry, then he stared into his eyes for a long time before harry looked away.
Harry serves them both before taking his seat directly infront of him, smiling before he devours it.
“You thought it was Krum he was jealous of at the Ball but it turned out to be You!” Harry joins in and both of them stare at each other before bursting out loud at the situation.
He frowns as he vanishes them and conjures up his own flowers in their place.
“malfoy, do you really be asking me that? don’t you have better work to do? or did your small brain forget the date?” harry scoffed. malfoy was undetered, he asked harry the same question again, as if he hadn’t even heard harry’s words.
He loves giving out punishment as much as Harry loves getting them and tonight is going to be delightful. He already has plans ready for the evening in his mind. It’s only a matter of very less time.
“Piano lessons.” Harry quips in.
Just before midnight, Draco traps Harry between his body and their bedroom wall, “Hello, love.”
“Why, Daddy? I’m just getting ready for the party.” Harry tells him and again gives him a sweet smile.
…5 hours later…
even if Malfoy had appeared confident just a moment ago, he took a deep breath before he started, looking determinant, “you’re a professional quidditch player. You resigned from the aurors about nine years ago and have been persued by various teams, and have changed teams twice. You now are the main seeker for Puddlemere United. You got hit pretty hard by a bulger before losing consciousness. And then here we are two days later. Does that answer your questions?” Malfoy asked calmy, it’s a lot to take in. Well, Harry never fancied being a Auror all that much after defeating that noseless bastard so it’s a good decision on his part. He wondered how he came to the decision.
Harry frowns at him for a moment but stands up and faces Draco. He really hopes Hermione and Pansy can see them and start-
game without getting injured or is that too fucking much for you?” draco asked, and while the words and the tone of his voice were in perfect contradiction; one thing was clear. Malfoy was concerned about Harry. but that was something he would focus upon on some another moment when his mind wasn’t full of some half a billion questions. starting with what in merlin’s name was malfoy doing here?
“No, you don’t need to look at me that way, you git. I know it was my idea to come out and I’m just being anxious about this but-”
“Well we can’t right now and you know, good boys don’t start stuff they can’t finish. You know what that makes you, Harry?” Draco questions and tilts his head.
“Just preparing,”
He wouldn’t ever stop this hilarious, inconsequential arguments he got into with Draco on purpose. Not for all galleons in the world.
“Really, darling? No one would have guessed via how you are in a relationship with a bloke, now would they?” Theo quips and the rest of them chuckle.
“Let’s keep it to two, yeah?” Draco suggests as he draws Harry close.
When he returns, he finds both of them laughing with blue buttercream smeared all over Draco’s apron and hair and there’s a lot of melted chocolate covering various parts of Teddy.
Draco didn’t have time to say goodbye to his mother as Harry dragged him into darkness.
Harry moved back up to Draco’s ear and whispered, “let me take care of you, love.”
He blushed slightly but rolled his eyes exaggeratedly. “I don’t know how many more dreadful things I can handle.” He said, sounding like the drama queen he really was.
Draco’s breathing was heavy as Harry started trailing kisses along his jaw. He paused at Draco’s ear for a nibble and a lick, and carried on his path down his neck, kissing, biting and licking as he went. With Draco’s hands gripping his hair, he left a particularly strong love bite at Draco’s collar and he moved further down. He trailed kisses and licks down the scar he had once left in a bathroom, and took care to kiss right above Draco’s heart which he felt fluttering madly under his lips.
Hermione said it should be, and after making Draco agree to send a plea for help if he got in trouble, as well as making him promise he won’t stray far, Draco left the protective bubble around the tent and walked into the trees.
Harry turning around knocked me out of my thoughts, and he passed me a cup of tea. I sipped it and groaned – it was perfect.
Sleep clearly wasn’t a priority in my life anymore. I couldn’t take it, I just had to know for sure. How would I sleep without knowing what Harry was thinking?
I raised an eyebrow in confusion. “Where are we going, then?”
Harry barely was able to contain his distrust to the boy, but seeing how forgiven his husband was towards the boy that had caused him to lose his voice endeared Harry to no end. Shacklebolt had even granted the pair a full 3 months fully paid leave for them to get used to their new reality. Harry, though, suspected it was a simple bribe for the pair to not sue the Ministry for health and safety negligence.
My heart seemed to skip a beat. “Your poncy prat?”
“I just know.” He gave me a small smile. “They have the sauces in bottles, so you can add spicier sauce separately if you want, but if I were you, I would go for ‘mango and passion fruit’. At least that’s Ginny’s and Hermione’s favourite sauce.
Harry takes Draco on their first date
In his frustration his pace picked up, and I hurried after him to keep pace.
I woke with a start, soaked, gasping for breath and indeed surrounded by tentacles. It took me a few seconds to notice those tentacles were actually Harry’s limbs and that I was drenched in sweat. A while after that the memories of what happened a few hours before flooded my brain, the rush of emotions making me shudder.
“We’re just finishing a translation for tomorrow’s lesson. We were nearly done before you rudely interrupted us”, I threw Potter a pointed look, ruined by the small smile I couldn’t stop from appearing. “Where were you, playing Quidditch? You know you’re not allowed on the teams this year, you old fuck.”
A loud pounding on the door rudely woke me up again.
“But they match the shirt!” She protested from across the room. As I looked at my clothes I reluctantly had to admit she was right. I glanced backwards to make sure they weren’t looking at me and saw they were hunched together whispering frantically. I quickly changed and, yes, I changed my boxers too. I then stood in front of my mirror to inspect my outfit.
Harry took a step this time, eyes fixed on Draco’s as he stood right in front of him.
“Look closer, Draco! His eyes look very green – wait is that his scar?!” Lucius practically squealed like a child that had been given a crup for Christmas.
was enough. Their lives were nothing if not unpredictable, but their love for each other was something they could both enjoy and trust. With a smile and a squeeze to his hand, Harry lead Draco to their new today.
Hermione and Weasley were already halfway to the portrait, but Potter stood waiting for me to catch up. Smiling, I joined him, and together we walked down to the great hall chatting about schoolwork and the latest gossip.
I reached towards his face to stroke a lock of hair off his forehead. He gasped as
His words were my undoing. I buried my face in his glorious hair and came. The orgasm hit me so hard I’m sure I blacked out, but I could hear Harry groaning my name as he came too.
“Draco, please shut up” Harry smiled and hugged me again. “I haven’t forgotten that you were a Death Eater and I don’t care either way.” He placed a kiss on my lips and pulled back again to look me in my eyes. “The Mark doesn’t define you and I think I know you well enough to know that you don’t believe any of that nonsense anymore, right?”
“I was wondering if you need help, actually. Is it your first time coming to Nando’s?” He casually asked.
And stared into grey eyes.
Draco squirmed in discomfort this time. “It has been a long time since then, Harry.” He said quietly.
My stomach did a funny leap at hearing that. “My my, Potter! You are full of surprises! I did not know that!”
He heard the low voices of his love and Dean followed by their footsteps as they both went into the tent, and he tensed. Hermione shuffled backwards to look at him in the face.
“OK then, it’s a date.” He leant down towards me and I had a glorious flashback to last night as he leant down and kissed me tenderly on my cheek. “Have fun in class without me.”
Draco glared at him.
“Thank you so much for coming again Linda” Harry jumped to his feet in his excitement and reached out a hand for Linda to shake. “I don’t know what we would do without you!”
“For fuck’s sake Ron I can hear you!” Harry yelled back. “I’ll be out in a second!”
Boy, could I ever relate to that. “Family… they can be complicated.” I mumbled.
We all walked up to our common room to get our cloaks and scarves, and traipsed our way to the pub. It was early December, and the snow levels were steadily growing. Forced to walked down the path in twos, I found myself walking next to none other than Potter at the back of the group, his nose looking steadily redder from the cold. It was truly adorable.
I turned to him. “I don’t remember giving you permission to search my belongings Blaise, or have the Aurors asked you to search me?”
What a weird question. I looked at Harry, hoping for some help, but he looked like he could barely contain himself.
Harry came back a few minutes later with two cups of tea, a milky one with two sugars for Draco, and one with just a dash of milk with no sugar for himself. He put down the milky one in front of Draco and pretended to gag. “There’s your piss, love.”
I separated my lips in a gasp to breath and his lips immediately went to my jaw, kissing and licking his way to my ear.
Sorry it took so long, life got in the way! Hope you enjoy the story so far :)
He stared at Draco as Draco stared at him, and Harry thought he saw an emotion flicker in Draco’s eyes, something that almost immediately disappeared, making him believe that maybe he had imagined it.
Harry stopped walking again, and held my hand firmly so I would stop. He looked at me, and pulled me into a strong hug. I couldn’t stop the tears from falling then, so I hugged Harry and buried my face in his neck so he wouldn’t see.
Narcissa just looked at her son. Her face was blank, but comprehension dawned in her eyes.
I couldn’t help but smile at him. “So, where are we going? To the Three Broomsticks?” I asked him.
Lucius Malfoy.
Draco closed his eyes and inhaled deeply before looking back at Harry. Harry pulled Draco’s finger out of his mouth, placed a kiss on his palm and reached out to Draco to get him sitting up.
“Er… what the fuck is peri-peri?” I asked Harry, looking down at the menu.
I swallowed down the thickness in my throat and pushed the thought out of my mind for now. Without letting go of Harry’s hand, I got my textbook and parchment out and started taking some notes for class. We worked silently for a while until Flitwick announced that we should start the practical test.
Hermione looked at him thoughtfully. “Would you like me to reverse the spell?” She asked quietly.
He looked at me and I could tell he was trying to gather his thoughts about the whole thing before he spoke. “Yeah, I just kissed a guy, but it was all I could think about for the rest of the summer. Every club we went to I was looking for that bloke, even though I knew I’d probably never see him again or he wouldn’t even remember me.”
He grinned at me and leaned closer to me. I couldn’t look away from his eyes, the whole world had turned emerald green.
“Go on another date you mean?”
Draco gets some help in getting ready for his first date with Harry
Draco’s step this time wasn’t quite so small. “At the beginning of the year we weren’t friends, no. In October we started becoming friends, but by December we were… something more.”
“It was you who found me” he said, turning his head slightly to place a kiss on Draco’s hand. “Thank you.” He whispered.
Flitwick carefully ‘sampled’ the wine again. “Well Mr Malfoy, I am impressed! 10 points to Slytherin!”
Probably no one was more shocked than myself at his unexpected friendship with Hermione. After our first evening back, I had cornered her and apologised for all my past mistakes – everything from the name calling, to the beaver-teeth incident in fourth year. I half expected her to punch me in my beautiful face again and was already planning my next apology after I jinxed all her hair off, when she flung her arms out and hugged me tight. She said she wanted to start over, and I had agreed. Behind all the forced prejudice that father had planted in my mind about Hermione and muggleborns, there was a witty, compassionate and incredibly smart witch that for years he was too blinded to see. We shared our notes with each other, we did our homework together and soon we shared meals and argued theories for hours at a time. If someone had told me 7 years ago that I would consider Hermione to be one of my best friends, I would have laughed and hexed their pants on fire.
The softness of his lips contrasted with the sharpness of his teeth as he bit my lip. As I gasped his tongue entered my mouth and licked mine tentatively before we both furiously began snogging each other. One of my hand gripped him by the back of his neck and the other held onto the collar of his coat, pulling him against me as close as we could be. I slanted my face just slightly to kiss him deeper and he moaned in appreciation and tightened his arms around my back.
Our common room had large windows that showed off the magnificent views of the surrounding mountains, and a glorious view of the lake. A large fireplace took half of one wall, and overstuffed armchairs dotted the room, and a large oak table with stiff leather-backed chairs sat by the window. It was here that I was sitting with Hermione one evening, each with all our Ancient Runes books taking over the entire 10-seat table and arguing over the essay translation we were set this morning.
“How do you know how I take my tea?” I asked with surprise.
A pang went through Harry, Draco would definitely recognise him. After all those years of their open hostility, insults thrown back and forth and fights, he was sure Draco would know him immediately. Harry hoped desperately that Hermione’s brilliant mind was coming up with a way to escape, panic was threatening to choke Harry completely.
“Well, here’s the Malfoy you owl-ordered Potter” he said sarcastically and finally let me go. “Be good you two, and I want you both back by 9!”
Cute. Gods, was I really that sappy?
“You’re leaving?” Weasley smartly deduced. “Give me a second, I need a piss and I’ll come with” he was half rising out of his chair when Hermione grabbed his hand and roughly pulled him back down into his chair.
Harry didn’t intend to stop, but he couldn’t resist teasing his husband. He licked along Draco’s crack twice more before planting a firm kiss on his opening, followed by a soft lap and a small kiss. He pulled back slightly and met Draco’s indignant gaze.
“Fancy seeing you guys here” said a familiar voice.
I saw him shake his head in quiet laughter. “I know, they really were ignorant in their hate.”
we only have 15 minutes!” Pansy screeched and started throwing clothes at me. “Put all of these on,
My jolt must have stirred Harry as he squeezed me gently and said “thank you for sharing that with me Draco.”
Then, nothing.
“Well of course that makes sense” he chortled. “But OK. What do you want to know?”
Next thing I knew I was laying on top of Harry, both of us panting and neither letting go of the other. It was a while before I truly noticed the mess in my pants and how uncomfortable it was becoming and looking down I saw that Harry was in the same situation. I flicked my wrist and both of us were instantly clean.
“See you tomorrow darling” Pansy said, tiptoeing up to place a kiss to my cheek, and she shooed us out of the room.
Draco looked at him in shock. Why had he done it?! Wasn’t it obvious
I gave him a wicked look. “There’s a lot you could learn from me actually.”
Thank you so much for reading!
“Draco.”
“And what kind of ‘different things’ were you looking for?”
The ‘restaurant’ was packed full of muggles of all ages – families, couples, groups of friends both adults and kids, you name it. There was even an old couple far out in the corner, a man and woman that seemed to be in their late 70s or 80s, and it looked like they were having a date night too. It had taken us nearly half an hour to get seated, so the idea of queueing once more did not thrill me at all. But the smell was good, I’d admit that much. The food better be worth it.
Hermione again seemed to know what he was thinking, but it was Ron that shook his head in answer. “Sorry mate” he clapped Draco on the shoulder and stepped towards Hermione, putting his arm around her shoulders.
Harry rolled his eyes “yes Draco, I want to date you.”
Harry guffawed behind me as I straightened with indignation. “But Sir, I’m no longer part of Slytherin.”
Once hidden, Harry grabbed my face and gave me a heated kiss. I clung to his hips to stop myself from falling if my knees collapsed and gave as good as I got. Our tongues wrestled in each other’s mouths, teeth nibbling at lips and moans being drowned by the other.
“And that’s why you love us so much!” Blaise said. He walked up to me and caught me in a bear hug. “I hope your date goes well Draco, we would wait up to hear all about it but I’d rather sleep soundly through the night.”
Could it be? Could I possibly be that insanely lucky?
“Are you both sure?” Hermione asked for like the millionth time. Harry looked at Draco and met his eyes. He could see there the same anxiety, fear and determination that had been haunting him for the past week. “I have figured out how to erase all your memories of each other of the past year, so you don’t forget each other entirely.”
He just laughed out loud, and the sound did something funny to my stomach. “I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t hoped for any midnight visits from you before.” He sounded casual, but the blush that appeared on his cheeks betrayed him.
“I’m sorry about that” I mumbled. “I didn’t want to get into trouble.”
“very well, Potter. If that’s what you wish for, then that’s what you get. Don’t say I didn’t warn you,” Malfoy said one last time. Harry just snorted at that.
“Did you- did you write this with someone specific in mind?” Harry asks and isn’t that the question Draco had been dreading to answer.
“So what should we do to you, Harry? Put a plug inside you or should it be a cockring this time?” Harry shivers in response, Draco smirks at him and leaves it for now. Maybe after they get back…
Thus, starts the process of decorating. Teddy wants to whip the buttercream and he wants five different colours and two different types of sprinkles. And of course, both Draco and Teddy bat their eyes at him so Harry has to go out to get them. Not that he minds.
“Not in this lifetime, Harry. Maybe the next one?” Draco asks, sadly with a little bit of hope. He hesitates for a moment before he moves forward and fold Draco into a hug.
son.” malfoy closed his eyes and took a deep breath, “and don’t even try contacting him by anymeans before- no even after you have gained your memory back. Because trust me it will, and it won’t be pretty. I don’t want my child to go through anything that would cause him trauma, and trust me when your own dad can’t remember you, that’s going to fuck up anyone’s mind real bad, especially for a one and half year old.” Malfoy spat out.
), harry had to watch draco fall deeper in love with someone that wasn’t him. merlin, there was only so much one could handle.
(16:18) what tower do you belong to?
(16:36) i highly doubt you’re him though
"Look, I just think you're interesting. You seem...fun."
.....i love you too.
(16:22) :(
Are you alright, Harry? What happened?
(13:51) remember to change my contact name!
Ah ah ah
And no, I don’t have a crush.
honestly, harry was pretty stupid for agreeing to help draco to court someone. someone that wasn’t
“Yeah, figured that.” said Harry.
(11:38) very fitting, don’t you think?
"Well, why don't you tell me who you are and you can let me be the judge of that?"
in some sort of way to embrace
“could you tell me about her?”
(23:31) u continue to surprise me
“See something you like, Potter?”
think mine’s some weird wrinkly old man
How could Draco not have noticed? The late nights, the weekends away, Potter smelling like women's perfume-
sure u weren’t mate
"I'm sorry," Harry had told him.
"I wanted to get to know you better."
“–Antoinette over there has been trying to follow in her brother’s footsteps, you see. Killing off squibs, smuggling dark artefacts into Wizarding Britain. Caught her this morning.”
(16:43) i didn’t mean that
draco hated wandering around hogwarts at night. really, he hated it. there was just something so eerie about the place. but harry had suggested a week ago that he should indulge in something that his crush liked to show that he cared. and what better way than to ask harry to play a quick quidditch game with him? so here draco was, in his quidditch robes at the quidditch pit with his broom, waiting for the stupid green-eyed boy to arrive.
It's two years into Draco and Harry's relationship when everything begins to fall apart.
Harry slammed his hands onto the coffee table, making Ron and Hermione jump. “Can we please stop discussing about how sad my love life is?” Hermione’s pitying look gave Harry an uncomfortable feeling.
(10:23 am) you wake up early
“You changed.”
Harry
(16:11) my friend would kill me if i was
“how’s the courting going, oh dear one?” pansy asked which prompted a soft smile from draco. “it’s going good, i guess. he still hasn’t figured it out though. i’m afraid he still thinks i’m courting someone else.” at this, blaise raised an eyebrow. “did you do anything to make him think this?” draco shook his head. “not really, i don’t think so. he suggested to start calling him by his first name the other day which i did, but he still didn’t figure it out.”
(11:33) i’m 19 too! :D
(16:18) do i know you?
“What?! No, I don’t!”
well i’m trying
Right as Malfoy leans away, Harry spots Zabini and Nott dragging in three men and shoving them into the holding cell. “Caught all of them this morning.”
(13:39) destiny brought us together
love you mate <3
“Say, want to wager a little bet, Potter? Whoever captures more dark wizards by the end of this month wins.”
With all his baggage, and his faults, and his insecurities, and his problems. He had foolishly let Harry in, had foolishly believed that this could be different, that Harry's sweet nothings and promises were true, that Draco was still loveable even after everything,
“harry confessed? to you? then ran away?”
“You’re quite bad at it, Potter.” said Malfoy.
but sure.”
draco smiled before getting up and brushing the grass off his robes. harry ignored the way his heart swelled when draco helped him up.
(23:20) ????
Sorry, Theo. Forgot about you.
Prat.
(13:33) you’re already saved as soulmate in my phone :P
"Why?"
“Side-tracked.”
Right, so
%%%%%
Malfoy twirled his wand around. “Ah, but there is where you’re so dearly wrong. I forgot to mention, Antoinette has accomplices–“ Malfoy leaned in to Harry’s ear, his lip brushing across Harry’s earlobe, making a shiver run down his spine. “–Three accomplices, to be exact.”
“It’s fine, ‘Mione. Seriously. It’s just a little crush, anyway.”
“I never apologised properly, did I?” At Harry’s confused expression, Malfoy continued. “For stomping on your face and breaking your nose in sixth year.”
Nope, Harry takes it back. He hates Malfoy, hates him with every fiber of his being.
He screams and throws the newspaper to the other side of the room, his Dark Mark showing on his left forearm as if it's taunting him. His vision is blurring and his head is spinning and Draco is letting out heart-wrenching sobs as he feels his heart break even further. He's mad at the Weaslette, at Potter, at himself that he let it get this far. Mad at himself for falling in love with
Harry was mad, angry. Seething was the word. Ron stood on one end of the couch, hands held up while Harry stood on the other, wand brandished at Ron.
"Well of course it is. It's still growing every day too."
if there’s one 19 year old bloke from hogwarts who’s pretentious, it’s malfoy
and promptly stopped Harry, glowering at him. “Master Harry will not be answering the door. Kreacher will bring Master Harry’s guest!” Before Harry could protest, Kreacher disapparated. From the top of the stairs, he could hear the door opening and the sound of Malfoy’s posh voice. Bracing himself, he walked down.
have u somehow died on ur way to honeydukes?
Harry muttered through clenched teeth. “Yes.”
in his second year, when he didn't die by the hands of the Dark Lord while he was under the roof of Malfoy Manor, when he had been pulled and saved from the Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement, when Harry had testified for him during the Death Eater trials, when he was granted a much lighter sentence by the Wizengamot compared to the rest of the Death Eaters, when Harry had offered him an olive branch during their Eighth Year and shook his hand,
sure mate
(17:23) well if it makes you feel any better i don’t judge people based on their pasts
Hermione twaddled out of the kitchen carrying Hugo, looking equally tired and amused at the scene that was playing out in front of her. “He’s right, Harry.”
Thank you.

"Will the two of you dumb oafs let me go?" Draco shouted, trying to wriggle his way out from Blaise and Theo's iron-like grips. "This is the best for you, Draco! Please trust us," Pansy had pleaded, her eyes boring into Draco's. Draco raised an eyebrow in suspicion before sending a wandless stinging hex to Blaise and Theo, causing them to yelp in pain and let him go. He snatched the newspaper from Pansy's hands and let his eyes rake over the front page. He could hear Pansy protesting and Blaise sighing in defeat.
(16:15) didn’t you do it too?
- had proposed. He can't bring himself to look at their happy faces as he crumples up the paper in his hands. Draco tries his best to take a steadying breath, making sure his voice doesn't break. "Leave." Pansy, Blaise and Theo are standing behind him silently, shifting from side to side. "Draco-" Pansy tries to take a step closer, tries to hold his arm but he shakes her off angrily. "I said
anyways, sort of a filler chapter??? wanted to make this chapter a little angsty but realised it was a bit too early for that, a bit boring but i guess it’s sort of a warm up for me to get back into writing. i’ll also be introducing new couples/pairings in over time as well as changing up some pairings :) i also put emojis in to test the waters, tell me in the comments if that’s fine!
"No, I didn't mean it like that."
(11:26) knows what i want
(16:11) i go to classes fyi
Harry turned around, glancing at the clock in panic. Sure enough, the clock striked 4 and the bet was over. “You know what that means, don’t you, Potter? You have to go on a date with me.”
Hermione and Ron were clearly messing with his head, trying to butt into his life just because he’s single while everyone else around him was getting hitched.
“It felt like something I needed to do,” Harry shrugged. “It was my dream back in Hogwarts. And I guess after defeating Voldemort, people just expect you to continue catching dark wizards for the rest of your life.”
(23:46) obviously
“Yeah, I know that, ‘Mione. But–“
Harry’s eyes lit up. “Okay?”
i texted them at 1am
“I know, I know! But, if we’re truly being honest, Harry–“
(11:18) hi...
Harry harshly tugged Malfoy to the side. “What are you playing at, Malfoy?”
Yeah, and me!
%%%%%
i’ll meet you guys in 10
I wake up at 8am?
Who’s got you all blushy looking at your phone?
He was sitting in the living room, a wine glass in his hand. Pansy had come over in a hurry, trying to stop Draco from reading the latest edition of The Prophet. Blaise and Theo had followed after her, holding Draco back as he tried to snatch the newspaper from Pansy's hands.
and as harry smiled and grabbed the pale boy’s face into his own hands while leaning in, as draco met his lips halfway and
from the corner of his eye, he saw pansy roll hers. “salazar, you’re pretty slow, aren’t you? have you seen the way that git looks at you sometimes? honestly, i don’t know what’s even taking the both of you so long to just admit that you like each other.”
draco had sounded so soft, pleading. and harry felt his chest tighten. he took in the way draco’s cheeks looked a bit sunken in and the way draco’s eyes looked a bit redder than usual. harry pushed away the urge to pull the boy in for a hug.
Harry pulled Draco into another kiss.
“Why did you become an Auror?” asked Malfoy, breaking the silence.
It seemed like Malfoy had done everything in his power to make it the worst night Harry will ever have. First, they stopped at the Leaky Cauldron– much to Harry’s dismay. Malfoy had refused to floo over or apparate as well, so Harry had to
anyways, as always: i don’t own harry potter in any way, all rights go to jkr. with that being said, i also don’t support her or her transphobia in any way. trans women are women, trans men are men. <3
(13:33) too late
%%%%%
"Did I just hear you laugh?"
coming!
Malfoy turned to face Harry, an alarmingly soft expression plastered on his face. “Do you not like being an Auror?”
"Which?"
(11:22) oh really?
no i know something’s up
(11:35) it could be my nickname for you
Says the big wanker.
“Favourite colour? Really?” asked Draco.
(11:43) my friend told me about it and i was bored so i did it
you know how competitive mione gets when there’s malfoy in the same class
i’ll be introducing the rest of the weasleys into the story soon enough, eg: the twins and ginny + others like dean, neville, seamus etc.
That’s not what I think
Do you want me to look at your aura later?
they replied at 8:30
%%%%%
(17:16) that turned dark real quick
we’re having it with the slytherins
“For the love of Merlin, what are you doing, Potter?”
it’s fun i tried it
fuck what if the guy’s a pervert
still, it was fun. even got mione to try it
Malfoy had sent him an atrocious looking outfit and owled that under any circumstances, Harry
Hermione quirked an eyebrow in amusement.
(13:24) pick one for me
(16:10) i’m thoroughly offended soulmate
and a light blush on his cheeks, asking harry “how do you court someone without being dramatic and over the top?”– well, harry couldn’t quite say no, couldn’t he?
didn’t know you follow internet trends draco
(10:24 am) or miss
(13:27) bloody hell
you say this as if she’s never smiled at her phone before
” Hermione glared at Ron as he rubbed over his stomach where Hermione clearly just elbowed him. “– But, you do talk about him an awful lot. I’m just saying, it’s not such a bad thing if you like him. He’s changed.”
(23:21) omg
“Harry! Nice robes!” said Seamus. They made their way over to the table and Harry glared at Ron which made Ron sheepishly glance at him and wiggle further into his seat. Malfoy had seated himself beside Harry, a bit too close as their knees occasionally bumped into each other. Harry hoped the dark atmosphere of the Leaky Cauldron could hide the blush threatening to show on his cheeks. They spent about an hour there talking and drinking and Harry actually had a good time, being able to catch up with his friends as Malfoy spoke with Zabini and Nott in hushed whispers until Malfoy had grabbed Harry by the arm, pulled him out of the booth and announced that they were leaving. Harry didn’t miss the small wink Zabini had given Malfoy, and the faint blush that spread on Malfoy’s cheeks.
(23:38) why not
(17:26) :)
(23:20) for what?
harry
She shrugged, putting Hugo down in his cot before lowering Harry’s wand. At this point, Harry didn’t know whether to feel betrayed or mad. They didn’t think he could win over Malfoy? Of course he could win over Malfoy. Harry was the one who spent most of his childhood trying to avoid getting killed by a dark wizard anyway.
“potter!”
"Oh my god, I did. I made you laugh. I made you, in all your posh and stony glory, laugh."
His eyes rake over the article on the front page, once, twice, three times, before his wine glass drops from his hand and shatters onto the ground. From the corner of his eye, he sees Pansy flinching but that's about the least of his concerns right now. Not when Draco's heart feels like it's been ripped out from his chest and stomped all over. Not when tears are prickling at the corners of his eyes and his vision's blurring and his head is spinning. Not when Harry and the Weaslette's happy faces are planted on the front page of the Prophet, a bejeweled ring shining on her forth finger.
is it just me
if i have to hear hermione nag me one more time about the importance of university and studying so help me harry
(See the end of the chapter for
as softly as draco could say it, to the point that harry almost missed it if he wasn’t pressed up so close to the other boy, draco whispered. “do you still love me?”
The sound of the doorbell broke Harry out of his trance as he stumbled out of his room heading for the front door. Kreacher apparated right in front of him with a loud
Excuse me?
he sounded.
harry heard his heart break because,
i tried ur stupid number neighbour thing ron
Who’s managed to capture and thaw the ice cold heart of Draco Lucius Malfoy?
Well, as long as you know what you’re doing, Harry.
Draco isn't stupid, he knew this would happen eventually. Who could love an ex-Death Eater? Who could love
apologising to almost the entirety of hogwarts was one of the hardest things draco ever had to do. seriously, swallowing up his pride? that wasn’t what malfoys do. but it was nice to have people forgive him and put the past behind, and so draco mustered up all his courage and apologised.
"Ha, got you. Favourite subject?"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
(16:32) not much
but you know i never pass up the opportunity for some good old gossip ;)
%%%%%
“Get to the point, Malfoy.”
Draco didn't need Harry to explain to understand what he meant.
It’s two years and three months into Draco and Harry’s crumbling relationship when Draco finally comes to terms that it–
“maybe start calling him by his first name? to get comfortable with him.”
"Treacle tart."
"You can keep acting as indifferent as you want but I know you're warming up to me. You wouldn't still be on the phone with me right now if you weren't."
to be with you, Draco.”
“Then he fled?”
(23:21) mid terms aren't for another 2 weeks
and not as the Boy-Who-Lived. He wanted what Hermione and Ron had. It was getting awfully tiring to constantly have to third-wheel the two of them whenever they met up.
, exceptionally good. Needless to say, it pissed Harry off. Not to mention the fact that Malfoy seemed to enjoy doing paperwork. He’d come in and walk over to his desk opposite of Harry’s, set down his bag and go over to the cafeteria to make his coffee the way he liked it before coming back to start on his paperwork. Two sugars, two creamers and stirred exactly five times. Not that Harry was paying any attention to Malfoy or anything, mind you. He had this obnoxious hum every time he sat down to do his paperwork. He’d play with his quill, biting on the tip of it with his mouth as he filled up his paperwork. It made Harry all sorts of bothered.
the second time draco came to him, harry had already braced himself for it. hermione and ron certainly wasn’t any help when he told them about his inner conflict, the both of them only exchanging knowing glances before telling harry, “don’t worry.” harry had no idea what they had meant by that.
I hate the two of you.
“Why don’t you try it then?” Harry raised an eyebrow mockingly.
“It was more of a, ‘If I dedicate my life to catching dark wizards and risking my life, then maybe people would stop treating me like a social pariah for the rest of my life.’ but I guess I grew to like it. Can’t say I wasn’t surprised though when Robards partnered me up with you,” said Malfoy, chuckling. “Getting the Saviour to keep an eye on the Death Eater.”
and if anyone noticed the way harry smiled like an idiot the entire day, nobody commented on it.
"And you chastise me for asking you about your favourite colour?"
(23:16) doing what?
"No! Fuck, I'm really cocking this up, aren't I?"
Now you know you can’t lie to me
to court someone who evidently was not
%%%%%
(11:22) how old are you then
Harry glowered, his right hand gripping onto his wand tighter. “I want to be with you. And I think you want to be with me too.”
sorry guys! false alarm
%%%%%
???????
Draco closed his eyes and released a trembling breath, his hands still clutching onto Harry’s robes tightly. “I want to be with you too.”
You’re a right arsehole, Draco.
red harry.
%%%%%
draco smiled bashfully, looking down at his feet. “he’s a good guy. sometimes, i think i don’t deserve him. that i don’t deserve him and everything that he is because i’m me and he’s, well,
i thought you said he wasn’t an old man?
so indeed,
Harry’s eyes widened.
"That's not a no, fair enough."
i will find out about it
the first time draco came to harry, he felt an unexplainable ache tearing at his chest. really, harry didn’t know why he felt hurt. him and draco were friends–
"....Is there a sentimental value to that?"
I’ll find out sooner or later, dearest!
(17:10) oh come on
got a bit caught up
“Okay.”
harry was a gryffindor after all, and weren’t gryffindors supposed to be brave and courageous? right now, harry seemed to just be crumbling. and as draco leaned in to give harry a hug, harry pushed the boy away, ignoring the way draco’s eyes fall.
sure, he was happy that harry returned his feelings. he was happy that harry had literally told him that he was in love with him. salazar, this was not the way he expected it to go down though. the next day, no matter how many times draco had tried to talk to harry, the other boy would run away before he even got the chance to walk up to him. draco felt helpless, defeated. how was he supposed to tell harry that he loved him too when the boy wouldn’t even let him speak?
%%%%%
Harry slammed the front door behind him.
Harry only smiled wider. “I don’t care.”
and as if realising the sudden weight of his own words, harry ran, not caring about the way draco shouted after him.
(13:26) i just let out the most scandalised gasp ever
“i would’ve thought he’d figure it out. considering i did it the day after he suggested it. but he just nodded and returned to his book. he even ignored me for the entire day after that!” blaise and pansy only laughed which earned a scowl from draco.
(23:42) it would be a disgrace to all soulmates out there
%%%%%
(11:30) highly unlikely
the bloke’s 19?
In a fit of rage after yet another one of their fights, Draco's wall had shattered. He had screamed at Harry, said things he didn't mean, let the old him- the him who cursed Katie Bell and his best friend, the him who insulted Muggles and Muggleborns, the him he had so desperately tried to stamp down and push away- come back. Draco knew this was it, that this was the end, that whatever little hope he had left of trying to fix them is gone. Draco knew they couldn't be saved any longer.
(23:07) hey
but the stupid green-eyed boy with an absolute mess of a hair that made draco’s stomach turn and fill with butterflies.
Harry was baffled, to say the least.
Or the rest of the Slytherins in the class earlier.
Harry suddenly found his face only mere inches away from Draco’s.
You blushed during Snape’s class just now too
Harry groaned too. “Not you too!”
harry is in plain text.
(16:55) xxx
(11:23) maybe you really are some weird wrinkly old pervert
Malfoy snorted. “Only asking. Don’t get your knickers in a twist.”
“Asked you first.”
"Meaning?"
Death Eater. Doesn’t really make much of a difference, does it?”
of course! he’s our age
“for merlin’s sake draco, i can’t do this anymore!”
Hey Luna
(See the end of the chapter for
yeah mate, definitely an old man.
Harry wouldn’t lie to himself. Malfoy did age well after the war and any person with two functioning eyes could see that the young Malfoy heir had obviously grown into his features. His face wasn’t as pointy as it was back in school anymore, his facial features filled out over the years and he no longer slicked back his hair with gel, instead letting it down freely. Harry noted that whenever Malfoy didn’t slick his hair back, his hair often curled into soft waves that framed his face really well. It would be much easier to keep hating Malfoy if he didn’t change his ways but he did. He had apologised to Harry after the war, thanking him for speaking at his trials. He’d donated to charities, gave money to the restoration of Hogwarts and tried his best to clear the Malfoy name. It took a while for the Auror office to stop giving dirty glances at Malfoy whenever he walked past but they slowly got over it and by the second year that Harry and Malfoy were partners, everyone seemed to warm up to him. Harry hated to admit it, but Malfoy really was making a good name for himself and as much as he didn’t want to, Harry quite liked the new Malfoy.
"Pft. Never."
%%%%%
Harry cleared his throat. “You know, I saw this thing once. The muggles do it. You throw a nut into the air and try to catch it in your mouth.” To demonstrate, Harry threw a nut into the air and tried to catch it, only for it to hit his nose and fall onto the floor. Malfoy snorted.
Harry was a competitive person.
Draco opened his mouth to say something and then stopped, as if he was contemplating whether it was the right thing to say. Alas, “Mine is green.” he whispered.
Do you ever learn to shut up, Blaise?
(23:12) did i wake u?
shut it blaise
(13:26) are you a hogwarts student too????
Harry’s job used to be tolerable, likeable even. He’d go out onto the field, duel with some dark wizards, capture them and be patted on the back for doing another great job, yet again. It didn’t matter that Malfoy was the one beside him through it all instead of Ron, Harry loved the adrenaline. He liked the fast-paced nature of his job, he liked doing what he did best. Sure, some would call him weird for actually enjoying dueling dark wizards but defeating Voldemort at age 17 just does that to you.
"Aha, see. I told you 21 questions would be fun."
Ron threw his hands up in defence. “Well, obviously, I don’t like the idea of you liking Malfoy. Honestly, there are many other blokes out there, mate–
(13:28) although i do get it. posh university for a posh guy like you
Malfoy seemed to try even harder to make Harry really have the worst date ever– he prepared a choir who followed them around Diagon Alley for approximately 10 minutes chanting
So...
, he could certainly get over a certain grey-eyed, platinum blonde haired boy. “i’m in love with you, draco. i can’t do this anymore because i’ve fallen in love with you.”
(15:35) lol
%%%%%
(16:54) fair enough
" He hears the three of them sigh in defeat and the floo flaring to life with them disappearing into the green flames and finally, Draco lets himself fall to the ground on his knees and sobs.
%%%%%
draco didn’t know what to do.
what about me?
Harry, you are not going to die.
holy shit did i just give my number to a weird wrinkly old man pervert
Harry was not clapping, he was
mione and i are heading to the library
where r u!!!!!
Harry had sighed in relief and Malfoy had huffed in annoyance. “Well, looks like we have to cut our date short, Potter.”
They pulled away after a while, gasping for breath, and Harry leaned forward, resting his forehead against Draco’s. “I want to be with you, Draco.”
Harry smiled. “I just do.”
Draco knows he's a lucky man, it's been proven to him countless times throughout his life; when his father didn't punish him after he found out Granger had surpassed him in studies yet
(23:42) what kind of soulmates would we be if we barely knew anything about each other?
started playing from the radio and Malfoy turned around to face Harry, his face split into the biggest grin Harry had ever seen. “Blaise got into muggle music lately, said this would be the appropriate song choice for when I, inevitably, win our bet.” Harry grumbled and glared at Malfoy. He could hear people clapping around him and waiting for Malfoy’s next move.
“Really, Draco? What did you think? I would just announce I’m bi and not tell them that I have a fiance?” Harry snaps angrily because clearly Draco is being ridiculous.
“So can I please kiss you? Because 8 would really like to,” Harry requests and Draco can’t do much but nod.
by some unspoken agreement, whoever gets home first would shower and if the other still hasn’t arrived, they will floo into the other’s house. most nights it’s harry who arrives first because of his regulated auror hours but when Draco has an early shift he is waiting for Harry to get back with tea already made.
“Okay, but only if you promise,” Teddy says atlast and holds up his pinky finger.
“I’m so sorry, Harry. I tried to talk to him, he just went all cold and didn’t listen to a word of mine. Just threatened to fire me and left.” Zia continues and boy, his level of fucked knows no levels because Zia is crying now!
“We should really thank Hermione and Pansy for this, don’t you think?” Harry asks as they finally sit down on the picnic blanket. The sky is bare of any clouds and they can easily see all the stars.
They might have been wrong about some things but this thing,
He is almost under again when he hears the whispered
Draco
Harry is panting by the time he finds his lips. His wand vibrates in his pocket at the slight reminder that it’s their anniversary.
“Yeah, mate. It’s old news anyways. As for being engaged to the Ferret. Could have chosen better but well all that obsession at least makes sense now.” Ron teases and there are snickers all around.
“He isn’t lying, son” someone says from behind him and seriously why is everyone always speaking from behind him- he sees Draco’s eyes widen and he gasps in shock at the person.
“As if, darling. It’s the other way round, everyone falls over their feet for me.” Blaise preens and Pansy shuts them both with two mild stinging hexes.
“What in Merlin’s name are you doing at Circe o'clock in the fucking morning?’ Harry half groans, half shouts from his bed.
“So who all are going tomorrow?” Harry asks his usual friend group. Everyone responds with a yes and how is that possible?
It’s not awkward at all, like Draco had thought it would be. Instead they talk about work- more like complain about it- before finally Draco takes his leave. After they decide to meet the coming Wednesday.
Pansy and Hermione snicker at him, “Oh shut it. As if you both wouldn’t do the exact same.”
“Then sleep, love. I’m shocked you even thougiof studying after last night’s welcome back-War’s over party.” Harry says and magically draws the covers over them. He moves slightly so that they are side by side but doesn’t pull away from Draco.
“anything an amateur like me would know of?” Harry queries, peering curiously at the music sheets. By his confused expression, Draco is sure that he doesn’t even understand a single thing in it.
After his night routine is done, he slips under the covers. He immediately misses the warmth of another body beside him. It’s hard to sleep alone after so many years together. It’s like he has forgotten how to do it entirely. He reminds himself that Harry is just on the other eastern wing of the Manor, it just makes matters worse.
“Don’t do this,” Harry says resignedly, he can’t just function without Draco any longer.
“Well then, it’s style is neosoul jazz-”
As he closes his eyes again, there’s just one word on his mind and subconscious.
They are still chuckling as he discusses the details of the date he had set up for tomorrow. Nowhere public because neither of them liked that, so instead he had picked up a picnic spot for tomorrow night. It would be great fun to propose in the middle of night with only the moons and stars providing them light.
It’s tradition to call each other names when wishing the other on a special day and at this point, it’s quite adorable.
i hope you like it!
“Too late for regrets now,” he comments and then adds because well Harry does have a ulterior motive, “I want to learn piano actually and Dad said Uncle Padfoot might know.”
Harry is leaving Quidditch Qualities after an early Christmas shopping when he bumps into someone.
“What would you be looking for today, sir?” she asks politely.
Draco cuts him short because that’s it, “If it helps I’ll come out with you, practically everyone already knows but I’ll make it official just so everyone doesn’t pounce on you. Will that be alright?”
“Yes, I think I am ready.” Harry says with conviction.
Draco then smiled, Harry didn’t like that look one bit, he looked at Harry through his red eyes and said, “i must have forgotten to mention but I’ll make sure Regulus stays with me. What with you being unable to even remember him. I’m sure I would have no problem at all. And don’t even try otherwise. Consequences would be deadly.” Harry shivered at the words but still, didn’t understand who Regulus was. The only Regulus he knew was Sirius’s brother and he was long dead.
Just as he closes the door, he hears the tiny footsteps of his baby boy and yeah there he is, sprinting towards him.
As Harry looks around the table at the end of the night, and sees the happy faces of his friends who has somehow become his chosen family. He just feels one emotion. Love.
“Malfoy’s right. Muggles stole our designs and ideas but couldn’t do the same with our magic. We moved forward to wands and they, well they kept trying to replicate but came up with better weapons but not magic. All this was before the witch killings when Magical and Non Magical people lived together in harmony and knew about our community. All of that went downhill when the Muggles thought we ‘refused’ to share our magic.” He looks at the three of them, Draco looks like he already knew all this, which is true of course. Harry and Hermione look surprised and super uncomfortable by the information.
“Yea, yes. He um went home. Asked me to do the last check-up and then you’re good to go.”
Just Hermione is left.
Harry makes a soft
“Yeah sure thing, Andy. I’ll be over in ten.” He replies to Andy’s flaming face through the floo.
“You’ve been a lot around Sirius, shouldn’t have let that happen, now what is it you want?”
“Nah, bi.” Draco waves them off and it’s Harry’s turn.
“You’re getting me wrong, Draco.” Harry says at last. Draco shakes his head ruefully and says, “Oh no, Potter. I have observed and obsessed over you for more than half of my life. I
“Well, it’s the same person who might have instigated it years ago but Ron had been quite oblivious that time. Much like you and Cedric, Harry.” Something in her voice tells Harry that she is giving a clue, to maybe Harry exclusively because the others still look clueless as ever.
“What bets and how did Blaise win?” Harry asks, he doesn’t really want to know but at the same time he does.
“We had placed numerous bets of course.” Hermione replies as if this is something she does on regular basis.
“Is that so?” Father says as he tilts his head, “Very well then, I’ll go get it.” He leaves the room and Draco is left with his Mother.
“MUM! DAD!” Harry exclaims and he runs towards them, he vaguely thinks if they’ll be solid or not. They are.
“Give me your hand,” Draco demands and Harry smiles fondly at his tone and gives his left hand. Draco takes out ring and places it on his ring finger where it will rest forever.
Smiling sleepily, he looked beside him to find it empty, that made him frown. He knew Draco had no shifts today, not until 4 o'clock anyways.
It feels unreal as Draco comes over and places himself on Harry’s lap and softly kisses his lips and says against his lips, “Happy coming out, love.”
“My my, someone is trying to woe a pureblood,” Uncle Moony says with a laugh then he asks, “So is this young woman or man or person?”
Draco gives him a sheepish smile and Harry shakes his head.
“Nothing, nothing will make them see it except time and effort. Promise me, Malfoy, you’ll do everything to make them see,” Harry asks fiercely and thus Draco promises.
“A Battle Axe, of course,” Malfoy says
“What Harry? That when they know you’re dating a Death Eater? Is that it? You’re ashamed of me? To be with me?” Draco questions him and it’s not that, it’s really really not that but-
He trusts Harry to be like this infront of him. Harry feels awful for the warmth that blooms in his chest.
“Oh this is going to be absolutely hilarious. Do tell, Siri that when he starts giving you lessons.” Uncle Moony finally wheezes out.
But the lady doesn’t even hesitate before giving him a smile and leading him towards the middle of the store. She starts showing him a myriad of rings- all of them elegant and classy with intricate designs but nothing that would suit Harry.
“Harry, it’s no good talking about that. You know that as well, why break the walls I needed years to build just for one conversation.” Draco says as if he can still read Harry’s mind, even without actual legimancy.
The Day Harry became Master of Death and came back from the place where souls usually depart forever, life has been different ever since.
He places a tender kiss of Harry’s forehead, just where his scar is and Harry feels Draco’s love. When they pull away, Harry’s eyes are burning slightly and he sees that Draco’s molten metal eyes are watery as well.
“Oh, hey Harry. So I conclude your memories are back?” Zia asks somewhat subdued, it’s a weird thing on her. She is usually this bright and happy ray of sunshine, so he frowns.
“Thank you,” Draco whispers and kisses him softly. Harry returns the kiss just as tenderly.
“Gin, as much as I love you. You are a lesbian yourself and in love with a mysterious blonde. Much like me, so shut it.” Harry says goodheartedly and Ginny makes a face at him but shuts up.
When they apparate inside their Grimmauld Place, Harry still but still challenges Draco with his eyes.
“Thank you.”
“I can’t even look at you right now.” Harry says and drags him in for a rough kiss.
The thud of Voldemort’s body as it falls in its final defeat is deafening. Then there’s the noise, the crowd cheering and shouting in joy as the world gets rid of one of the darkest evil. It’s also filled with loud pops of Disappearation as the remaining Death Eaters flee the battlefield.
“Here you go, son. I’m sure Harry would be quite delighted.” He hands Draco the ring and engulfs him in a rare hug as well. Draco can’t believe it, his parents approve. Not that he didn’t know that, but it’s different to know that so explicitly.
“Hello,” he greets James and Lily as he sits down beside their grave on the ground, “So I wanted to ask you for Harry’s hand. I know it’s an ancient practice and well, you are dead but I want to do this right. I was raised this way and I’m rambling.”
“Oh you want me to prove it?” Zabini asks Draco and both of them look at Harry. Harry nods his head minutely. Now’s a good time as any and well if his bestfriends are actually correct then well….
“Is this what you want then?” Draco asks and Harry eagerly nods his head. Draco smirks,
And then, Draco knew. Just like that. And, and, and he didn’t flee, even when Harry asked him why, he had shook his head and told him it was harder to get rid of him. And that was that. Harry knew on that day, that he was going to marry this man and this man only.
when harry woke up in a hospital bed for the millionth time, his first thought was
“Oh hey, good morning!” Harry calls when he finally sees Draco and he takes that as an invitation to come in.
“Draco…” Harry gasps, and his eyes widen. Maybe this was a bad idea, well it’s too late now anyways.
“What lessons?” Uncle Padfoot asks as he enters the kitchen.
“Harry, just spit it out alright?” Draco sighs as he looks at him. Well then….
“break the bonds then, the certificate would already be produced after we do that. I’ll contact the advocate right after.” Draco put forward his hand and Harry hesitated for a bit before putting their hands together. The touch was familiar, the skin soft and tender. Harry didn’t even dwell on that for more than a second.
“How can I earn it?”
“What do you mean they didnt?” Harry asks him and tilts his head.
“Oh, you know. Just the same old, Ginny and the kids keep me happy, more or less. And there’s always the Auror job that I have.” Harry says as if not every single person in Wizarding Britain doesn’t already know this.
He asked him to sit down beside him, and instructed Kreacher about more breakfast before getting back to his book. There were only a few pages left to it. So Harry thought it wouldn’t take him much longer to finish.
“I swear to Merlin-” Ron starts saying, promptly waking both of them up but he stops short for a second when he sees them. He cocks his head to one side for a moment before he says, “It’s almost eight and unless you both want to miss the first classes or be on a empty stomach till lunch, get dressed.”
” Draco thunders out and Harry flinches slightly at the anger in his voice. “Well, once a Death Eater always a Death Eater.” He says with resignation and Harry opens his mouth to protest but Draco stops him.
Send me a prompt  there if you want!
“Maybe we should do this again?” Harry suggests and Draco nods in reply as he buries himself in Harry’s neck.
It was a wonder to be assigned roommates, everyone knew about Draco’s spy status and Draco was given a Order of Merlin just like Harry and all other War Heroes. Harry had his suspicions that McGonagall might have read in between the lines somehow. Impossible as it was but then again she was Headmistress for a reason.
Harry smiles and laughs quietly against his lips as he whispers the same back.
“Ah yes, why are you here? and where?” Dad says with amusement, then answers himself, “Well answer’s quite simple. You’re in the connected mindspace of both of you. That’s why you’re together. And you’re here because Death wanted a glimpse of their masters and we wanted to meet both of you.”
A tempus charm shows him that he has about three hours to get home before Harry starts to suspect anything and that’s plenty of time. He apparates to the cementry in Godric’s hollow.
Draco shakes his head fondly and says, “Does that mean my Aunt knows?”
"Same reason as you, love.” Draco smiles ruefully.
“Right here!” He shows them the ring and they coo over it for a minute. “Is this place even a cafe or is that just for the name?”
“Do you think I just do it tonight? It’s pub night and everyone said they will be attending this one as it’s the first one in almost two months.” Harry suggests and Draco shrugs before saying, “You could, before you back out or something. Or maybe you can take some more time to think this over.”
McGonagall’s day when he went to Hogwarts.
“We must leave now,” Mum says and before he has words in his brain, she is placing a kiss on his forehead and a quick hug around his shoulders, followed by Dad.
“what now?” Harry asked, irritatedly.
“okay so it’s 2011 and I have somehow forgotten ten years of my life. So what’s up with me right now then? Senior Auror? Please don’t tell me I went for Minister!” Harry tried to joke, it wouldn’t do good to panic now afterall. “and however did I end up here? Malfoy mentioned something of a game?”
“You would- you would do that for me?” Harry asks with so much hope and something else he can’t name, that it makes Draco’s heart ache.
everyone’s morning.
For now, he will prepare a dinner for the both of them because it’s his off day and he wants to cook something special for their anniversary. So he makes all of Harry’s favourite stuff and even chooses the best wine from the Malfoy Private cellar.
As Harry stands in his empty living room, he wonders when if ever he would be able to tell the world and would Draco accept him then?
Malfoy’s hand pulled into a tight fist and Harry noticed that he still had a wedding band. So of course, Harry asked, “what about the ones you are wearing?”
“I’ll be taking him with me. Or since ha-potter is the one who is leaving. Reg would be staying with me.”
Well, Harry’s going to woe and court Draco Malfoy and win him soon. Just some lessons (and his Uncles antics) then he has all he needs to make Draco Malfoy
“A bad boy?”
Just before falling asleep, he remembers that he hasn’t told anyone where he would be and they might be worried. He lazily casts a patronus and tells his stag to go and tell Ron and Hermione that he is safe and he is going to sleep but nothing else.
He had been shocked when he met Lucius as Draco’s boyfriend for the first time since the war, it had been after two years of dating Draco and he had been invited over. Gone was the bigoted, slimy bastard he knew, this Lucius was still as much of an arsehole but not the same one. They were not friendly exactly, but he liked to think that he and Lucius got along nowadays. Well it’s almost been eight years so he guessed with time anything was possible.
They look at each other tenderly with all their love on display, then slowly come closer. As if it’s their first kiss and it feels like such as well, almost shyly they kiss each other, tender with love and rough with passion.
He gave up dating altogether after a couple of years, he couldn’t keep secrets from his partners and the guilt of that grew with every second. Then he met Draco Malfoy.
He takes a moment conjure some flowers before he starts talking again, “So I want to marry your son. Why should he marry me? I don’t know that. Merlin, I don’t even know why he loves me. Me, who is an angry arsehole to everyone and who never smiles. Weasley’s definition not mine, just so you know. I can tell you why I love him though? Maybe that will be enough to convince you both. Harry, he has always been my guiding star. I don’t know how but even in school when we were at each other’s throats, he had been someone constant, someone always there. No matter in what way, just there. And afterwards, the war where well you know things happened and I was so bloody naive but he was there as well. He had been my only hope back then, that Harry might be able to save all of his from the doom which was Vol-voldemort. And he did, he even initiated the house unity in Eighth year and then we got seperated because of our careers and look at us now. Both working at the Ministry and even our departments are connected, somewhat. I’m an Unspeakable, you see. You would know that Harry is Head Auror but not about me. I don’t know when that star, that hope became my everything. Slowly, but consistently. We grew closer and I can’t imagine a day without him anymore. At the end of the day, I need to be around him else I can’t fall asleep.
“But we just met-” Mum starts to say when Dad shakes his head and mouths
“Uncle Harry, look! Cousin Draco now looks just like me!” Teddy squeals as he points at Draco. Draco glares at Harry, daring him to utter a word, so of course Harry does.
” Harry makes a poor impression of Sirius and smiles as he thinks the scene which is hopefully happening in some other world.
“Play it for me?” Harry asks and how can Draco even think of saying no to him, afterall he made this with Harry in mind.
“Well I’m gay.” Harry rubs his neck as he looks around.
forgotten about the whole thing.
“And we’ll be together after some hundred years, yeah?” Draco asks casually, too casually like he knows something.
“So I’m proposing to Draco tomorrow, I think it’s about time, you know? It’s just…I- I miss you. Like I have everything but one. Draco’s parents, they aren’t bad. I think I like them somewhat. Yeah I know how that sounds, Padfoot is probably horrified right now.
“Harry, Draco! Wake up! Both of you are going to be late!” Ron bangs against the door but they have a muffliato up. So he just barges in after a moment because Harry’s magic recognises Ron and doesn’t stop him.
“Oh, you know? Someone who hasn’t read a single book outside of school curriculum. Even then, you didn’t read half of them.” Draco snickered.
and left the room hurriedly. Ron took off soon after.
“Oh yes, we should definitely try that, right Harry?” Draco agrees and Teddy looks up at Harry with those same puppy eyes. Harry shoots Draco a quick glare before he agrees wholeheartedly with him.
It had taken a lot of courage and almost a year and half of dating each other when Harry finally wpilled his darkest secret in the darkness of the night when he couldn’t see Draco’s face. Draco had taken it all in, nodding for a quick second before he changed the subject and Harry was relieved. He hadn’t wanted any more questions, not that night and Draco, bless him, understood that.
Harry walks into the cemetery in happy spirits. He can’t wait to tell his parents about his decision to marry Draco.
“Well that was unexpected.” Pansy finally breaks the silence.
She smiles fondly at her boys, covers them with a blanket.
“I can’t, not right now. It’s fine, Mione. Don’t worry about me.” Malfoy said with a broken voice. Harry had never seen Malfoy showing this kind of emotion publicly before, but Harry didn’t care.
“Was I really the only one to think that Harry was bi and Draco was the gay one?” Theo asks and by the looks of most of his friends, no most of them thought the same thing. Well, it’s not like he ever came out properly or anything. He just started dating Draco and let people assume whatever they wanted to. Maybe it was a bad decision to not include their friends. Maybe.
“Hey Dad, do you know how to play an instrument by any chance?” Harry asks through the floo.
He is out of the doors within an hour with his best friends at his side.
“Well, I hope he says yes, else…” Draco replies as he hugs her back.
Once, Harry found him smiling at some kids, playing with a ball- one with the Malfoy crest perfectly clear on it, when Harry had brought his presence to Draco’s attention the smile was gone but so was Harry’s heart.
“Gay,”
He had married Ginny afterwards because that’s what everyone wanted. So he did, but he invited Draco to the wedding because Harry knew Draco wanted him to.
“Merlin and Godric both, couldn’t you have picked up anyone else?” Uncle Padfoot asks with a desperate tone.
is something they have been right about all along.
Harry mostly ignores him as he gets dressed himself. Harry won’t even hear the end of it if he goes to Andromeda’s house, half rumpled clothes because it clearly shows what they had been upto.
Harry never found Draco Malfoy again, not even a glimpse. Not for as long as he lived.
“As if I would ever,” Harry scoffs and takes him in a tight hug.
So now, Andy knows. Before anyone else in either of their lives, because she is a perspective and oh well.
“Your rings, Potter.” Malfoy out forward his hand, Harry frowned at it.
“Told you fuckers I would be winning.” Blaise smirks at them all and what?
“Circe’s saggy tits, where are we?” Harry whirls around to find Draco looking around amazed.
“But I don’t wanna sleep! I don’t see you more, I want to be with you!” Teddy exclaims and Harry and Draco share a look.
“My Saviour.” Draco exclaims and Harry can practically see him rolling his eyes even if Draco’s eyes are closed and tucked inside his neck. They talk softly for some more time, just basking in each other’s presence without anyone to interrupt them or anything looming over their heads.
“Sure you haven’t lost your way here? Draco doesn’t live here any longer.” Lucius says at the same time.
The word rings clear even as he sees another man come out of the door, encircling his arms around Draco, giving him a quick peck before getting inside again.
It happens so suddenly that no one knows what to do, just as Harry utters the last words
“Malfoy, what in Merlin’s name is that thing?” Ron screeches before Harry can.
Fucking hell, now is not the time for this. Nor do they have time for any of
From the other side of the room, Harry hears someone howling with laughter and looks over to find Zabini and Parkinson toppling over each other in laughter as Draco sits there with a red face. He mutters something about it not being bloody funny through gritted teeth but Harry has plenty practice reading his lips in the past couple of years to discern correctly.
Draco is sitting with his back to the door, against the last stall, just infront of the wash basins. He doesn’t even hear Harry coming in, only noticing when he places a hand on his shoulder.
. Do whatever you feel like. You are The
When she enters, he sees that Pansy is with her as well. Atleast between the two of them maybe he’ll learn something.
“Harry, is there something you have to tell me? You seem…..off.” Draco comments, and obviously he is off. He does not want to-
He is baking cookies by the look of it and Harry’s face lits up at the thought. Any baked good and you should always go to Uncle Moony, even Molly can’t beat him.
“Another one? Already?” Harry groaned, how could a person read so many books and for fun?
“No, you don’t understand. You don’t have the motherfucking pressure of the Wizarding World upon you! They fucking expect that- no Draco, just no. They tear me apart on my one mistake. What do you think would happen if I come out? Don’t you see it? They want the perfect Saviour, not whatever messed up shitass I’m.” Harry bellows out and Draco calmly listens to all of it without so much as a comment.
Draco had stopped laughing then, looked at him for a long time, then finally said,
“Yeah yeah, I don’t understand how you don’t get bored.” Harry regretted saying that the moment he met Draco’s answering glare.
“Hi…” Harry breathes, as he arches his neck in a silent request. Draco places sweet kisses all over his jaw and neck, sucking new marks and biting the tender skin now and then.
“Happy Anniversary, Ferret.”
After peering at his sleeping face, Harry closes the door and places a one-way muffiliato charm, so Reg can’t hear them but they can still hear him. It would cancel out the minute Reg wakes up and Harry would get an alert. He and Draco had modified it themselves.
“Let’s go, swwetbean.” Draco says and leads the way towards the center where Pansy and Ginny are standing.
Ofcourse he does. He isn’t a idiot for nothing.
How did life come to this? He didn’t know. What he did know was, he wasn’t ever letting it go.
“We are in my mind,” he replies and Draco arches an eyebrow at him. Yes he knows how barmy he sounds but its the
ps- part three is well on its way!!!
“When did you come back?” Harry inquires because it can’t be-
He had taken one look at Draco and pulled him for a hug and then kissed him slowly. Savouring the feel of Draco’s lips against his, lest it be the last time.
Because when Harry finally confessed his feelings, Draco had laughed. It was so cruel and full of viciousness, something he hadn’t witnessed since they were in school.
“It’s about love. Love, in a selfless form. Like when you love someone so very dearly but you can’t have them but that doesn’t stop you from loving them. You just love them more and more and never think about not receiving the love back.” Draco gives him a small, sad smile.
“See Cissa, I told you he had ulterior motives after all,” Lucius says as he looks over Harry suspiciously.
