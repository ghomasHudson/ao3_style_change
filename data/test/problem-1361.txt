“I know,” Veronica replied. “But in some ways that just makes it harder. Knowing how much me doing this is going to hurt him. Hurt all of them. My friends, I mean.”
“I never thought I’d see the day where I’d like the idea of being the equal mate of Harry Potter,” Malfoy chuckled. “So, do you want me to give you a proper bite now, or shall we be horribly scandalous and do it in front of the whole school?”
“It’s not that simple,” Veronica argued, shaking her head. “I can’t just kill him, there’s a few things that need to be taken care of first, that’s why we need to find what we came here for. And- and there’s other things too, and we’re just not ready. I know you want to fight, but as things are… Until we do what we came to do, we just can’t win.”
Veronica flinched at that. Apparently, about four years before they’d started Hogwarts, Draco had been abducted by people who saw a death eater’s son as a blemish on the wizarding world. He’d been rescued quickly, but not before being subjected to several unpleasant hexes. Although she hadn’t known it at the time, that had been one of the main reasons for his meek demeanor when they’d first met: experience had taught him that public spaces such as Diagon Alley were dangerous.
“Stop it,” Malfoy insisted firmly. “I don’t want to hear a recitation of all the griefs you have against me, especially since it’s making me actually start to believe it’s you, Potter, and there is no way I can accept that eventuality.” He turned away from Harry, his hands on his head as his perfect posture slumped into what could only be described as a hunch.
“You didn’t betray us,” Veronica spat vehemently, because in her eyes, he very much hadn’t. He’d been forced into a bad situation, and if anyone was to blame, it was Veronica, since she was the one who’d fallen for Voldemort’s ministry trap hook, line, and sinker. “And there’s no way you’d ever try and set us up. You’re not like that, Draco.” She didn’t have to look to see that Ron and Hermione were exchanging that look they got whenever Veronica stood up for Draco. It was a look that said, “Here she goes again,” and “Why won’t she just see sense?” and something else as well that Veronica hadn’t quite figured out, but was a little bit pitying, she thought. “Which is why,” she continued, “I’m going. Like I said, I’ll see you guys in a bit.”
“I’m not sure we’ve cut down their forces enough for that,” Hermione replied. “They did take some heavy losses, but they’ve still got quite the advantage.”
“Better than we could have hoped for,” Hermione said grimly. “A couple of people have died on our side, but there would definitely have been more without the Felix Felicis.”
“But while the death toll is low, there’s still plenty of people who won’t be able to fight anymore,” Hermione continued. “Lavender was maimed by Greyback, and I think there were a couple of other victims. Plus there’s plenty of curse victims. But more importantly, we need to talk about what we’re going to do once the potion wears off. Our luck is going to run out, Vee, and we need to be prepared for that.”
She opened the pouch and pulled out the snitch Dumbledore had bequeathed her, earning herself a raised eyebrow from Draco. Drawing the snitch up to her mouth, she held it to her lips as she said “I’m going to die”, and the golden ball opened up, revealing the ring she’d long suspected was there. She turned the snitch over to drop the ring into her hand, then held it out to Draco on her open palm.
“Negotiations are still in progress on that front,” Malfoy replied. “But I’m not here for a mate, surely you could smell that.”
“Well you should,” Malfoy retorted. “Because he’s mine.” Malfoy’s eyes glinted with just a hint of possessiveness, and Harry wasn’t sure whether he was infuriated by it or turned on. “Now back the fuck off before I tell Professor Snape on all of you.”
And yet here was 15-year-old Harry, waiting in line for the first scent party of the term despite the queasy feeling in his stomach. The reason was simple: shortly after the Yule Ball the previous year, Harry had finally presented his secondary gender, and he was an omega.
“No Draco, it doesn’t,” Harry admitted, smiling and shaking his head. “At the beginning of term, it would have, but now… I think I’d rather like it, being properly bonded to you. Maybe even mated, someday.”
“Oh!” she said again, this time excited as an idea occurred to her. Her hand jumped to the mokeskin pouch she carried around her neck. “I have something for you, hang on!”
He was more than a little dizzy from the smells and losing hope in his chances of success when he collided with someone new, and, after finding their neck, he leaned in to have his nose filled with a pleasant odor of grass and wood and wind that reminded him of quidditch, with just the slightest herbal scent. Rosemary, maybe, in a small enough quantity to be enjoyable rather than overpowering. It was distinctly alpha, but not in an in-your-face sort of way, just a sort of calm strength that commanded respect without being authoritarian. The scent made him feel safe, and Harry felt himself relaxing for the first time since he’d left the common room for the party. This was the one. The person he would let claim him. If they wanted him that is.
“Sev,” Draco said simply. “The dark lo- no, Voldemort killed him. I had to go retrieve his body. Thankfully he didn’t have the snake eat him. And then… there were some potions Sev left for after the battle, I was helping to distribute them.” He yawned. “Salazar’s balls, I’m tired.” He leaned over, resting his head on Veronica’s shoulder. “Mm, you need to eat more, you’re bony.”
“Or death eaters,” Ginny added. “Since we’ve already established that they’ll likely be here before long.”
“Why the bloody hell would I dream about you, you wank-?” Draco growled, raising his head off her shoulder and opening his eyes, which widened comically when he saw her face right next to his.
“This has to be some sort of sick joke,” Malfoy said, taking the words right out of Harry’s mouth. “Polyjuice potion, that must be it. Tell me, who are you really?”
Draco had absolutely no interest in rugby, but he had a lot of interest in Harry, and if Harry was asking, yes was the only answer.
“Ah. Let me explain. I am Sirius Black, your mother’s cousin. This is Potter Hall Farm, your home until mid-November, that being said there is a permanent position here should you choose to take it,” Here, Sirius smirked as if he knew the idea of life on a farm was Draco’s absolute worst nightmare.
Harry’s gentle voice soon joined in, ‘oh mama don’t fuss over me. The way she tells me I’m hers and she’s mine, open hand or closed fist would be fine, blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine’
Whilst the t-shirt was quite tight (uncle ted was not one for sports, he was thin as a beanpole) Harry was not a very tall boy, and so it hung just to the edge of his boxers, giving the impression that he wasn’t wearing underwear at all. Draco may be asexual (Hermione had taught him the term when he had confided in her over text once. She had been asking him about his feelings for Harry, and it all just came out), but he still felt affected by the allure of sex, even if he never wanted to have it, and oh god did he feel affected right now.
Soon, Pansy fell asleep, the balmy summer air and stillness lulling her into a gentle doze, and Draco lay, head pillowed on his hands as he stared at the blue expanse of the sky. He was startled when he heard heavy footsteps and looked up to see Harry walking towards the apple trees. Draco waved when Harry looked over, and to his surprise, Harry changed course and started walking over to them.
Harry and Ron came and went two more times, for the table and the other bench, and while Ron was cheery and earnestly wished Draco a happy birthday, Harry was studiously avoiding looking at him. Draco sighed internally. If that was how Harry wanted to play it, so be it. Draco was over it already, not that there was really anything to be ‘over’, but as much as he was aware that Harry was attractive, he utterly refused to play cat-and-mouse with someone that would blow hot and cold and pity him. And frankly, at almost twenty years old, Harry shouldn’t have to be told by others when he was acting in a stupid manner.
Cedric said nothing, but sniffed, and then left. Harry decided to take the safer route and waited in the bathroom for Cedric to check the other room, then go down all the flights of stairs and leave the year twelve’s wing of the building. When all was silent again, Harry eased out of the bathroom, slipped out of the room, and stole down the stairs in record time.
I made my claim in fifth year. I am still not entirely sure how, but my father discovered that I was homosexual, and he flew into a rage unlike one I have ever seen before. My dear mother tried to defend me, and he had the audacity to lay his hands on her. He hit her; the first time I have ever seen him do so, and in that moment I swore my revenge.
Draco was so happy to be home. Back in his massive house in his massive bedroom in his massive bed. He missed his mother, and it was nice to see her again. He had spent all of last night with her in her dressing room, braiding her hair like he used to when he was younger, while he told her all about school and his new friends Harry and Ron and how they were rugby boys but not prejudiced and so unlike the rugby boys of the years before.
Pansy’s scream shook Harry from his thoughts as the six of them walked in the ever-intensifying heat of the late summer sun. “what the fuck. I didn’t know there were snakes in England. What the fucking FUCK” she yelled, rooted on the spot and staring at the ground in fear.
Draco’s heart ached for the tumultuous and painful life Sirius had lived through so young, and he simultaneously admired Sirius for being so strong, and so cheerful even through all that he had faced. He also ached for Harry, and how unimaginably hard it must be to be orphaned and not be old enough to even withhold memories of your parents.
“I know this is weird but can we hang around here, just until they’ve buried him? I want to make sure he’s really gone.” Harry said.
Harry stumbled down the corridor, brain thick with sleep, and scooped Teddy up and carried him downstairs for breakfast. Teddy was old enough for slightly more solid foods now, and so Harry made up a bowl of Weetabix and warm milk, as well as a plate of banana bread that Harry had made yesterday, cut into small chunks. Out of sheer laziness and hunger, Harry cast a charm on the spoon so it would feed Teddy for him and then sat down to his own breakfast of a raspberry and white chocolate muffin and a mug of green tea sweetened with honey.
Draco nodded, and Pansy giggled. “I forgot how much of a lightweight you are Dray darling” he shot her a look full of rage and embarrassment, and Blaise laughed at him too.
to him before. Good, yes maybe when he had been saved from the fiendfyre and when Potter had testified for him but never nice, never friendly, yet here Potter was, murmuring about how it was only two or so more hours before they could set up their camp for the night, and how Potter could do most of the tent sorting and Draco didn’t know what to do. It felt wrong to receive such kindness when he was so utterly undeserving of it.
By the end of his story, Harry was looking at Draco’s ceiling, rather than Draco himself. Desperate to have Harry’s attention back, Draco said “well he sounds like a rat bastard. You’re better off without him”
To his eternal gratitude, he wasn't awoken the next morning until breakfast time, at about nine, meaning he had a chance to sleep off the cider. Breakfast consisted of eggs, bread, beans and mushrooms. Almost a full english.
“None taken darling. We are equally uninterested in each other”  Luna said with her characteristic bluntness.
He also resolved to deconstruct the superficial, stereotypical and quite probably classist view he held of them, too. He had thought farming to be awful. Backbreaking work with little to no rewards historically done by the peasant classes and currently done by the working class, but Remus had been kind to him, and Sirius was obviously as posh as Draco given that they were related, and this challenged his preconceived notions of ‘farming folk’.
They sat pressed against each other on the sofa, the little dvd machine balanced on Draco’s legs. At some point, she laid her head on his shoulder and he felt all warm at the proof that she genuinely liked him and felt comfortable with him. After the film ended they chatted for a bit, and Hermione drew her head off his shoulder but immediately threw her legs over his thighs and he was once again left to marvel at how quickly she had taken to him, and what a lovely feeling it was.
Much to his horror, Draco started to cry even harder, and Harry just stood there, arms wrapped around Draco, cocooning him in warmth and surprisingly nice cologne.
Here she gave a wry smile, looking rather obviously at the group of Gryffindor boys sat around a chess table.
Remus picked up the slack, asking Draco an endless stream of questions about his schooling, which subjects he had studied, what he wanted to do at uni, if he ever went. Draco tried to keep up as best he could, pretending that the cold silence radiating off of Sirius and Harry was something he hadn't even noticed.
in case you're confused about Draco's birthday not being in June, I took the creative liberty to move it to July for the purpose of Draco and Harry sharing a birthday month (for the purposes of this plot, it matters)
Harry thought it was an apt song for the moment. He often felt as if he was flying on broken wings, trying to make the most of the damaged goods he believed himself to be.
As he pondered this, Harry’s words swam around his head. God, Harry would hate him so much more if Andi was introduced, as it would be something Draco had in common with Sirius that Harry didn’t. Well, Draco decided, Harry would just have to deal with it. He was nearly twenty now, that was old enough to move beyond feelings of jealousy that revolved around parental figures. and, thought Draco petulantly, Harry had had Sirius and Remus his whole life, Draco had only had them for a few weeks.
Slipping out the front doors of the castle, Veronica couldn’t help but pause to turn around and take one last look at the castle that had been her home for six years. It was here that she’d learned magic, both the kind cast with a wand and the kind that came from the bonds between people. She’d felt love here, maybe not romantic love, but the love that was friendship and the familial love that came from people like the Weasleys, and Sirius, and even some of the professors to a certain extent. Like McGonagall, who felt a bit like a stern old aunt who hid her fondness behind a mask of impartiality. To Veronica, Hogwarts was a place of safety and happiness, despite the fact that she’d experienced more threats to her life here than with Dursleys, and suffered some of her most miserable days here as well. She would miss- well, she wouldn’t miss it since she’d be dead, but it was hard to let go of this place that meant so much to her. At least by dying, she’d be protecting it.
“About that,” Veronica started. “I was talking with Hermione and Ron, and we were thinking it’d be best to change tactics. We want to beef up the defenses as much as we can so we can fight with a smaller force, and evacuate everyone else.”
“They’ll understand,” Sirius told her, reaching out a hand as if to rest it on her shoulder, but drawing back after his fingers started to go through her. “It may take them some time, years even, but by the time they join you, that anger will be gone, and they’ll just be glad to see you again after so long. I’d know, that’s how I felt seeing these two again.” He jerked a thumb at Lily and James.
In other words, how many deaths was she responsible for. How many people had she failed to save? How many lives had been lost from her failures? Even though she was going to die tonight without having ever killed anyone directly, she would still bear the guilt for every person who had died at Voldemort’s hands.
“Of course I would,” Draco told her. “But they did everything they could to ensure my survival. They’d want me to live, not trap myself in the past.”
“Keep it,” he said, his voice choked. “I- I’d rather not keep you here like that. I mean, I want you here, but… I want
“Or third year you almost got kissed by a dementor, though I guess that wasn’t really Moldy’s fault…” Ron continued.
“We should also ask the professors of course,” Hermione chipped in, reluctantly getting dragged into their pace as always. “Not only would they have knowledge on the school’s enchantments, but they are powerful wizards and witches, not to mention being something of experts in their own fields.”
Harry’s hand instinctively flew up to slap over his scent gland. The morning after the scent party, he’d gotten Hermione to help him place a glamour over the claim mark, since claim marks were associated with omegas and betas (especially omegas) and might give him away. Unfortunately, Ron had seen the mark before then, and even if he hadn’t, it was hard for two of them to keep a secret from the third member of their group. Case and point: the current interrogation.
“You’re wrong,” a new voice said from beyond the wall of seventh years trapping Harry against the stone wall of the hallway. “He didn’t reject everyone. He just rejected everyone but me.”
“There you are!” Draco exclaimed, speed-walking his way over to them. Draco didn’t run, not unless it was absolutely necessary. He claimed it was beneath his dignity. That, and the pained stiffness of his movements probably was a sign that, for the moment, running was beyond his capabilities. “Veronica, before you do anything stupid- don’t argue, you know you’re going to, you bloody Gryffindor- when we were working on the Felix Felicis, Sev gave me something for you, that I was to give to you if anything happened to him. He said it was absolutely necessary for you to see it
Harry felt an exasperated rush of relief. Trust Malfoy to manage to stroke his own ego while still saving the day.
Veronica waited until she was within the trees before thrice turning the stone, and watched as everyone came out. She wasn’t surprised to see her parents or Sirius, but she was taken aback when they were joined by two more figures who she’d never met before, but had seen often enough, since they both shared traits with Draco.
happened,” Harry insisted, because it was true, nothing had happened. At least, not the sort of thing that usually happened to people who paired up during a scent party.
“Yes,” Veronica said, ignoring the small niggling voice of doubt at the back of her mind. What if they were wrong? What if Voldemort hadn’t really hidden it here when he came for his staff interview? What if-
“Always a pleasure, Malfoy,” Harry grumbled with a roll of his eyes. They split up, carefully maneuvering their separate ways past still-senseless students until they could leave the hall.
No potion or muggle pharmaceutical could prevent heats or ruts. Centuries of potioneers and herbalists and doctors had tried. Many had made wondrous discoveries, yet none had succeeded in finding any means of staving off that monthly menace. The only saving grace for alphas and omegas was medicines to reduce the effects of their ruts or heats, allowing them to at least remain functional, albeit miserable and horny.
“Nothing as crass as that,” Malfoy practically snarled. “What makes things difficult for an alpha me is that scents bear stronger associations than normal, particularly during a rut; as such, having a scent to ground us is the best thing for a rut, save knotting a mate. In other words, during a rut, it is nearly impossible to bear the scents around me, and it makes it bloody difficult trying to get off when, at any second, you might get a whiff of someone’s unwashed socks or a third-year’s cheap perfume. I just want something that smells like someone I’ve claimed, as I will be most sensitive to that odor. It should block out all the other scents, and help speed things along, as it were.”
After all, one of his best friends was Hermione “Scent-parties-are-derogatory-and-an-antiquated-way-of-finding-a-suitable-mate” Granger, who had tried to stage a protest outside a scent party in first year. She had warmed to the idea since then, but still deemed it irresponsible, and frankly, Harry rather agreed. Then there was also the fact that he was Harry “The-boy-who-lived” Potter, and as a result, had been subject to students approaching him and announcing their secondary gender to him with suggestive winks ever since he arrived at Hogwarts. And that wasn’t at all traumatizing to a kid who hadn’t known he was famous and who still maintained the slightly childish repulsion to all things romance, no, not at all (that’s a lie, it was severely traumatizing).
“Oh for fuck’s sake,” Harry groaned, causing Hermione to purse her lips momentarily at his language. Harry got up and went to the door, sticking his head out to make sure no one was nearby and might overhear. Satisfied, he ducked back inside and firmly closed the door, then returned to the bed. “Fine, something happened, okay. But no one, I repeat,
“Remind me again, who was it who kept pestering me last year with endless notes about seeking help when it’s needed and not trying to handle everything alone?” Draco drawled loudly to the general populace of the room, pointedly not looking at Veronica until he’d finished speaking. She stuck her tongue out at him.
“See you,” Neville replied, and the two parted, with Neville oblivious to the burden Veronica had just placed on his shoulders. But it could have been him, really. It could just as easily have been a boy-who-lived rather than a girl. He could have been the chosen one, the golden child, the celebrity hero who hadn’t actually done anything. And since Veronica had to die, then Neville was the only one left to be the prophesied vanquisher of dark lords.
It didn’t help that Harry had a low threshold for his heats, which meant everyone knew he underwent a monthly cycle. Luckily for him, thus far everyone had assumed he was an alpha. In fact, most people seemed to assume that even before he presented. But sooner or later, the truth would come out, and when that time came, Harry wanted to be prepared. Which meant allowing someone to claim him.
“I really doubt they know all that much more about the school’s enchantments than you,” Mione,” Veronica chuckled. “How many times have you read
“He’s got a point, Vee,” Neville chipped in. “Our allies are already on their way. Everyone will be here. We can get the younger kids out, and anyone who doesn’t want to fight, and then those that are left can kick some death eater arse while you do your thing and get rid of His Snakeyness. Sounds like a win to me.”
“Fuck you, Harry” Draco heard Ginny say, tears evident in the thickness of her voice. She sounded so upset he couldn't even feel happy that Harry hadn’t wanted her, especially because he knew there was no way Harry would ever want him. He stepped out of the shower and towelled off, shimmying into a clean pair of Ginny’s cargo trousers and a t-shirt that he had stolen from a friend at school. Jamming his feet into his walking boots but not arsed to lace them up, he traipsed across the lawn to the big house.
“In here, love!” Sirius yelled and for a few seconds Draco was desperately worried he was about to be living and working alongside a throuple, when a man who couldn’t have been more than two years older than him walked into the kitchen. He wasn’t massively tall, maybe about 5’10 to Draco’s 6’ but he was well built. Rich dark skin strained over arm muscles that flexed as he ran a hand through his jet black hair.  roundish-squarish glasses with black frames perched on the end of his nose, magnifying his green eyes in a thoroughly distracting manner.
It was getting a lot colder. Harry found himself walking up the long driveway to Draco’s home wrapped up in his puffer jacket with Sirius’ old doc marten boots on. His feet had started to freeze in his trainers when he wore them out now.
“I would kiss you after that, but your breath probably smells of vomit, and you should definitely shower. I’ll kiss you when you’re clean”.
“he’s gone, isn't he” Harry said. Sirius nodded at him, standing and opening his arms. Harry folded into them.
Draco coughed, unsure of what to do. He looked at the floor, willing away the blush he knew was on his cheeks as a result of how utterly humiliating this whole situation was. “how about, if I carry the food and camping stove and tent? I wont have room in my bag for your sleeping bag but I can strap it on to the back of my bag. You’d have to take it back if it rained though” Potter said, voice bizarrely and uncomfortably soft until Draco realised that Harry’s green eyes were on his pale hands that were shaking. Draco curled his hands into fists and nodded, before thinking and saying “wait, wont that be much too heavy for you?”
“I don’t belong to him, Pansy” huffed Harry, somewhat annoyed. Blaise was so far proving to be less of a prick than Draco, and Harry was not beyond considering the other dark skin man as a potential partner, if only for one night. He got the feeling that it wouldn’t affect any budding friendship between the two.
“you’ll never have that, Teddy. I'm your godfather like Sirius is mine, and I will always be there to protect you” Harry said to the boy in his arms. Teddy snuffled and yawned, slowly opening his eyes and gazing dazedly up at Harry.
At Molly Weasley’s request (not that he could ever say no to his surrogate mother) Harry saw a mind-healer daily, and as August dawned, Harry was slowly but surely on the road to recovery. As a birthday gift, Ron and Hermione bought him a radio to replace the one that helped him so long ago, and Harry began to listen to the more modern music played on the more modern stations; Doja cat, Ariana Grande (perhaps an indication of the sexuality he had not yet discovered).  Now that Harry knew he was safe, his enjoyment of music tentatively stretched from listening, then singing and now to dancing along whenever he felt the unfamiliar feeling of happiness and freedom roll through his body in large cresting waves that peaked in his chest and rolled all the way down to his toes. He didn’t have to be good, he was alive and had a body to dance with, and so he danced.
The walked up the stairs in silence, before Harry turned onto the floor that housed his and Teddy’s bedrooms, and entered the nursery. Draco let out a soft gasp when he saw all the photos, and went straight to the wall and began looking at them all.
Draco was so astounded by the confession that he didn’t have it in him to feel any jealousy at the prospect of Harry and Ron sharing a bed.
“I think I met him once. I was young, and hiding from Bella, and he found me. He was kind to me. He said he hated being there too, but that we could leave soon. He was kind to me.” Draco repeated the last part. He didn't know why, but it felt important. He looked up from his hands to see a sheen of tears in Sirius’ eyes.
Harry heard Ron cough and splutter behind him. “what the actual fuck was that Harry?” Ron said when Harry turned. His face was almost as red as his hair and he looked distinctly confused and uncomfortable. Harry just laughed and kissed Pansy on the cheek before setting her down and turning to Blaise.
God, Draco was fucked. He thought back on his interactions with Harry that day and physically flinched at how standoffish he had been; how impolite. How was he supposed to strike up a friendship now?
“I’m torn between Luna and Ginny” said Harry and Draco nearly groaned. Luna was a new name. How many girls were in Harry’s life?
“he’ll be in the porch, and there will be a door between you, don’t worry” Harry laughed, putting his hand out so Talgarth slid up his arm and curled on his chest.
He mused that perhaps that was why Harry was now so close to Luna; she was a fourth pillar in his life, now Harry knew he had a life he could truly live, and was not just a glorified sacrificial victim.
They had a large dairy herd and a few bulls to keep it growing, and three pigs they kept as basically pets.
“Er, no. is he your dorm mate? That’s a couple floors up, I think” Ron said, as Harry looked on in mild amusement.
“Why would he be upset?” asked Harry, his drink-soaked brain unable to keep up with Hermione’s intellect so early in the morning.
“hardly likely, Malfoy’s don’t feel such trivial emotions.” Harry huffed a laugh, and Draco was so happy he was back.
“Ron is better than that though. When he thought we were together in the forest of Dean, he just left. He didn’t try and break us up- not that there ever was an ‘us’. That’s better than what Blaise did. And anyway, Ron was hurt and jealous and angry because he loved you. He really loved you, heart and soul. Blaise doesn’t love me; he’s doing this just to hurt Draco. That’s mean. Ron was never vindictive or malicious like that, just jealous and insecure.”
“you take teddy into the sitting room, Andy. I will help dear Harry with the dishes.” Narcissa said, standing and shooing Andromeda out of the room with the baby in her arms. She turned to Harry, hesitantly. “Harry, I wanted to ask you. Andromeda has offered for me to move in with her. The Manor holds so many awful memories, and Andromeda’s small townhouse is quite quaint, with enough space for the two of us. Therein lies the problem though, as much as I am eager to accept, I cannot leave Draco in that cesspit alone, But Andy’s house only has two bedrooms. I was hoping, if it is not too much of an imposition, if you would perhaps allow Draco to stay with you, just until he finds a place of his own?” she looked at Harry imploringly. “if he doesn’t mind living with a baby under one, I don’t see why he cannot stay here. Merlin knows I have the space. I’ll get Ron to help me set up one of the spare bedrooms tomorrow. When would he be coming?” Narcissa sighed in relief, then fiddled with her hands, not looking at Harry. “he doesn’t, he doesn’t know yet. I asked him not to come, so I could talk to you about this first. He is awfully affected by the war, and holds a lot of guilt. He would have outright refused if I had suggested this to him. You would have to offer before he would even consider it.” She said. “I understand” said Harry warmly. “if you come up to my study, we can draft a letter to him.” She smiled at him, and Harry saw the women she could have been had she not been forced into marriage with Lucius, and followed down his hellish path at his side. Her eyes sparkled and she almost glowed with muted happiness. The final letter, after much deliberation from Narcissa and many spelling mistakes from Harry read:
So they talked, and talked and talked. Harry talked about being adopted into the Weasley’s, and about how he, Ron and Hermione were a formidable gang at their old secondary school. Harry talked about the music he likes- lots of Bowie- and about how he looks like he stepped out of the nineties because he wears his dad’s jumpers that Sirius kept for him.
“of course I’m not over you yet, Draco. I would never have told you how I feel if I had thought those feelings would dissipate in a week, but you seem to be forgetting the fact that you rejected me. I am not so self-pitying or self-flagellating as to sit around and pine celibately over someone who explicitly told me they don’t like me. You said no, and I accepted that. No doesn’t mean try again, or try harder, it means leave it alone and so that’s what I did. If you change your mind, and decide that you do want this, then I’m here to discuss it, but I won’t wait for ever, and I spent the last week coping with rejection and hurt feelings, and while I respect your position completely, I do feel it’s unfair for you to be so angry by me sleeping with someone. You said you didn’t like me, surely you should be happy about this, I don’t understand.”
“It’s fine Harry, you never notice” I say, trying to comfort him, reaching out and taking his hands in mine. Of course, as I am wont to do, I said exactly the wrong thing and I watch as his whole body stiffens and he nearly rips his hands from my grip.
Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating, but they have been trying awfully hard to ensure we snakes aren't ostracised, or punished by vigilantes. I would have thought Potter and the Weasel were strong armed into it by the swot, but they have taken to being our body guards like a duck to water. It would be easier if Potter wasn’t so painfully fit.
Draco went red and Blaise smirked at him before saying “Pansy darling, something tells me that Potter isn’t quite available to you”
Luckily, they weren’t, and Harry and Draco were back downstairs and eating more cupcakes than was strictly healthy when Pansy and Blaise returned, laden with bags.
“yeah, okay” he breathes, before leaving the kitchen, cake unfinished, and curling up in the corner of the sofa, looking out the window at the trees that are slowly turning from brown to green with the encroaching spring. They seem to represent an optimism that Harry doesn’t feel.
“James and Lily, Harry’s parents” Sirius’ voice startled Draco. Draco turned and Sirius nodded back to the photo. “James was like a brother to me. I miss them every day, we all do”
Harry hated Halloween, but that paled in comparison for the love he had for his friends. Sandwiched between Ron and Hermione, lying in the low lamplight, he knew that he was safe, and loved, and that was more than he had ever hoped for. Ron’s arm gripped his bicep, and Hermione’s feet tangled with his and he knew that this is what Lily and James would have wanted for him. He assured Ron and Hermione he would be fine, and that they could leave. They did this every year- he always wanted some time to grieve alone, and they were always loathe to leave him. He adored them for it.
Harry felt strangely nervous for Draco’s imminent arrival, and busied himself by baking. He gave Teddy to the Weasleys for a night and barely left the kitchen. When we went to pick Teddy back up on Tuesday evening, he gave Molly and Arthur a batch of scones, a tub of biscuits and a banana loaf cake for their trouble. Less than half of what he had made. As Teddy didn’t seem to want to sleep, he sat on the armchair with the boy in his arms, feeding Teddy little bites of biscuit as Harry methodically made his way through a whole batch. Soon Teddy got drowsy, so Harry put him to bed and fell asleep in the armchair, content to stay with his godson for a while longer; tomorrow, it would no longer just be the two of them. It was a bittersweet feeling. Harry awoke, body stiff and aching from his night in the armchair. He realised that in his reminiscing he had forgotten to bathe Teddy the night before, and so decided to do it that morning. He took the large bucket he used, always too scared Teddy would drown in the bath, even with only 3 inches of water, and decided to bathe Teddy whilst he made breakfast. While the bacon was sizzling away, he gently soaped Teddy’s body while the baby wriggled and splashed him, giggling. Harry loved this so much. He wrapped Teddy up in a towel whilst he ate, realising he had forgotten to ask Draco what time he would be moving in.
Harry and Draco had been together for about four months, muddling along together, juggling Teddy and their budding romance with various degrees of success. There was a lot to work through between them, and Harry was only able to accept forgiveness for the sectumsempra because it hadn’t left scars, and though Harry was of a generously forgiving disposition, Draco’s guilt made it hard for him to accept Harry’s forgiveness at face value. They were happy together, though, and that’s what matters.
He sat up and saw Harry slowly swaying his body in the mirror as he tried -and failed- to plait his unruly hair back. He turned to Draco with a grin. “Luna keeps trying to teach me but I never get the hang of it, and I love the feel of someone else doing my hair too much to really try” he said, giving up and letting his curls tumble free.
“It certainly didn’t seem like he liked me when he was waxing bloody poetic about not wanting anything serious and then fucking my ex not even a week later”
“I can’t wait to go out tonight” Draco said against Harry’s neck. “it’s been too long, and you look so delectable when you dance”
Draco took her hand and squeezed it, and they lay there in the morning light, drinking hot chocolate and relaxing in each other’s presence. Draco’s heart ached for the love that had been stolen from his mother, and he admired her even more for the strength she must have to raise a family with a man she neither loved nor chose.
Some of their ideas weren’t so bad. The eighth-year quidditch team brought a nice reprieve from endless revision and being unable to leave Pansy and Blaise alone together, and watching Potter, and agonising over how hot Potter is, and avoiding every other living being in the castle.
“All right lad, let’s go, Harry’ll be up on the fell with Remus. We had two lambs in the night, so three more  t’come” Ron said, leaving the house with Draco and setting a punishing pace through the fields.
“Come on, we have a few hours until Theo gets back, we can just watch telly in bed?” Draco said, desperate to be wrapped up in Harry’s arms again.
Eventually, his mum calls them for dinner and Draco feels as if he could talk to Harry forever. Dinner was agone though, as his mum kept making not-so-subtle references to Draco’s schoolboy crush on Harry, all of which made Harry laugh and then wink at Draco as if he knew. Then again, Draco wasn’t so sure he had done such a great job of hiding his infatuation.
Draco’s musings were interrupted with a soft “Sing for her, Harry”, and soon Harry’s baritone, like warm melted honey, filled the space. Draco recognised this one from the first morning back, and closed his eyes, soaking up the sound.
“Good to hear boys. That’s not to say that I thought you would be, but better safe than sorry.” Wood replied, before striding off to his own building.
Finally though, Malfoy was ensconced in his sleeping bag, looking at Harry with a soft smile on his face. Harry opened his arms, “let me warm you up” he said, voice low in the dark safety of the tent. Malfoy giggled, and Harry thought he definitely needed to hear that sound more.
Weasley gave him an apologetic look and Granger squeezed his hand. Draco didn’t know what to make of this. He had spent the last seven years resenting the golden trio. Resenting the bond they seemed to have, resenting the fact that they never really got into trouble despite seemingly making it their mission to break all the school rules.
Harry was uncomfortably reminded of his parent’s funerals. He has only vague memories of both; tall men carrying him around- they must have been Sirius and Remus- strange adults crying and holding him; feeling utterly overwhelmed.
Draco nearly found himself agreeing, which was odd. Apparently a week in the countryside was enough to convert him to farm life. Instead, he nodded and said that he too was enjoying the peace.
I fumble opening the box and once I’ve finally lifted the lid I gasp. It’s a crest, with four quadrants. I can tell which are mine and which are his. Mine contain a small coiled dragon and a narcissus flower, and his contain a lily and then a jumble of letters. I trace them with my little finger. The ring is tiny, but the attention to detail is mesmerising.
He applied for French with Business studies as a late application to York and to Leeds as his insurance, and once the final page loaded saying his application had been submitted on the somewhat ancient computer, he felt lighter than he had in a long time, barring his birthday with Pansy. He called Sirius up with excitement to show him, and heard the slow and heavy sounds of Sirius’ feet on the stairs. Draco immediately felt bad for dragging him up if his hips or knees were acting up, but it was soon eclipsed by excitement.
“Last night, mum. I went out for a walk and I heard voices in the rose garden, so I went in to see and I- I”
The concern in Draco’s voice when Harry knew their whole relationship might come to an abrupt end that night cracked something open in Harry, and tears began to well up in his eyes. He shook his head mutely and wrapped his arms around Draco, drawing up all the sobriety he could muster and desperately hoping that he didn’t splinch them.
“I think the fact that Sirius refers to me as his cousin and does not specify that I never even met his mother or father doesn't help my case much” Draco said and he felt Hermione nod.
“It's bloody party central here” he grumbled to himself as he left his bedroom to go and open it. Hermione stood on the doorstep  holding a bundle of blankets.
“I wasn’t interested in the dance, I was interested in you” mumbled Draco, too hungover to properly think about what he was saying.
No sooner had she finished talking then came a knock at the door. Remus stood outside, in a smart-looking short sleeved button down that was at least a size and a half too big.
He flopped onto the grass, weak legs barely able to keep him standing anymore, and watched absently as Potter, the Weasel and Blaise put up the three tents. He was shocked to see Granger and Pansy gossiping as they set up the camp stoves. Somehow, as Draco trailed behind alone, the rest of them had become friends of some sort. Draco felt hollow and outcast as he watched the others work together amicably.
“Up you get blondie. Lots t'be done” was the curt greeting before Harry left the cottage. He heard the murmurs of conversation outside and wondered if it was Remus or Sirius out with Harry.
“I can stay back with you” Ron said, as he shouldered his school bag, ready to be driven back for the new term.
Luna gently lay Draco down on her lap, carding her fingers through his limp hair, and Draco could see now why Harry could not stay away, it was as if the girl wore draught of peace for perfume.
This is more than just the equivalent of the American muggle ‘promise ring’. By laying your claim upon someone, you ensure that no one else in Hogwarts can ever court them, or be physically intimate with them. In recent years, this has been used to ensure that adolescent flings are safe from the grabby hands of other conniving Slytherins, or by some stupid children, securing a Yule Ball date.
It had forced Draco to re-evaluate all his judgemental views about rugby boys and their aggression and their tribal tendencies. He saw Harry in an entirely new light, and he felt weighed with guilt. He had complained so much about his father, and must have seemed like such a bastard to Harry, who listened to it all, knowing he had spent eleven years in a cupboard.
Of course, it was at this point that Harry finally decided to grace them with his presence and he opened the door and just stood in the doorway, mouth open.
October came and went, and Draco found himself nursing a firewhiskey in the common room, sat by Neville at the eighth year’s Halloween ‘extravaganza’ as Dean described it. It was fun, he thought. Good decorations, good food, good drink. He looked around him again and couldn’t help but notice the blaring lack of the golden trio. He had initially assumed they would be having their own celebrations, but it was coming up to midnight now and he knew Ron wasn’t one to miss a party, and where Ron went, the other two followed.
“Hiya love” she said, kissing Ron’s cheek loudly before she turned to Draco, who was standing awkwardly in the hall.
“That's fine, I need to shower anyway. Thank you so much” Draco said, and almost skipped back to his cottage. They had organised a party for him! He couldn't remember feeling happier, even if he barely knew anyone who would be attending.
The two made their way upstairs, and Blaise turned to Draco and said “you are arse over tit for him aren’t you”
Blaise said it was a surprise, and no doubt he would turn up looking deathly attractive with the most gorgeous girl on his arm.
“Right. Subjunctive isn’t too bad once you get the hang of it, yeah? Just takes some getting used too. What I love is that it’s not technically a tense” Harry says, and Draco is immediately lost. He was supposed to be good at French, dammit.
“Er, you alright mate?” said Ron, sitting up in bed, looking at the boy desperately using their door handle to keep himself standing.
“oh please, I much prefer you like this” she purred. Harry blushed, bravado lost now that he was quite literally naked and vulnerable, and he left, all but running upstairs. In typical Harry Potter-style luck, as he ran up the stairs, a very hungover Draco was stumbling down them, and they crashed into each other, falling so that Draco fell back-first on the steps and Harry was on top of him. “shit sorry Draco” said harry, scrambling up before holding out a hand to help Draco up. Draco just lay on the stairs, blushing pink and raking his eyes over Harry’s scantily clad form. “well, your friends are in the kitchen, I’m gonna get dressed and then I’ll make breakfast, yeah?” Draco nodded mutely, and Harry just ran past him in his embarrassment.
They spent a lovely day exploring London together, but Harry was thoroughly exhausted when he returned home. Dean and Seamus had gone, but Draco was sat on the sofa, looking much better, chatting amiably with Blaise.
I say this last part knowing I’m likely to be hexed for it, and I hold my breath. He nods slowly, wearily, and I take this to mean I am safe for the time being, and so I plough ahead.
They changed into stiff black suits when they got there. Harry had wanted to wear as much colour as possible, to show the utmost disrespect, but he didn’t want to give Petunia any reasons to unleash her vitriolic verbal abuse on him, not on such a tough day for both of them.
“I must say Potter,” a deep voice drawled behind him, “now you’re nearly nude I must admit I do see what all the fuss is about.”
Draco settled down with a new book, looking forward to a day of peace and desperately trying to keep the image of Harry’s sleeping face from his mind.
This is, perhaps the most important piece of information about the school. Not to Draco, though. Draco didn’t play rugby. He had neither the body type nor what he liked to consider as an innate disposition for violence that was necessary for Rugby.
He walked in and rolled his eyes when he saw the teacher had made a seating plan. He would have thought they were old enough to be trusted with sitting by themselves. He sat down, alone in a middle row. The class started and seat next to his remained empty. He prepares for a year of bliss- sitting alone and being able to just get on with it without some stupid boy constantly asking him questions.
“I’m not quite sure what you mean” came Ron’s voice, deep, and teetering in the line of threatening.
“Harry, its nothing awful. Tonks accidentally almost cut her thumb off making teddy’s lunch, so Remus is taking her to A&E. I'm going over to watch Teddy because it’ll likely take them hours. I was just wondering if you could maybe stay the night at your mate’s house? There's no easy way from where you are to Remus's house so it would just be easier for you to stay there until tomorrow, that okay?”
When his breathing calmed down, Harry sheepishly rubbed the back of his neck, and said to Draco, “sorry if the music was too loud, I use it to drown out everything else, and your apology affected me more than I had anticipated… n-not in a negative way” he sputtered when he saw Draco’s face fall. “I’m going to shower now, so you can have some peace”. Harry turned, yanking off his t-shirt as he went, and Draco was left staring at the brown muscled back as it entered the spacious ensuite at the back of the room. Draco flopped back onto the bed, sighing dramatically and desperately praying that a sweat soaked Harry would not grace his dreams that night. His prayers went unanswered when Harry opened the bathroom door, steam curling around him, wet hair curling around his face and down to his shoulders, water droplets running down his abdomen to wear a towel was carelessly draped around his hips. Draco dragged his eyes away, going back to his book, and harry wordlessly got ready for bed, tied up his still wet hair (that’s why it’s always a mess, thought Draco- he never dries or brushes it!) and turned the lights off with another wave of his hand.
“wow, you have a song for everything Potter, I daresay I’m impressed” smirked Draco, but his only response was more crying, and a small, broken-sounding “why did Patroclus have to die?”
Aware he was intruding, Draco withdrew from the window and shut it, settling into bed and steeling himself for a sweaty night ahead.
With that, Harry disapparated, leaving Draco standing alone, feeling like the monster everyone always told him he was. He was so used to his father’s overt and violent homophobia, his mother’s silent but hurtful disapproval, that he had believed Harry was angry purely because it had been a man. He felt a bit sick at how blatantly he had disregarded Teddy’s safety. He hoped his mother never found out.
“anglais c’est interdit ici, monsieur Potter” the teacher responds, motioning the boy-Potter- into the seat next to Draco.
I hate that I owe them for this, now, too. I already owe Potter too much. Right now, he’s too virtuous to cash in on his debts, but one day, fifty years hence when the fame is faded and he’s old and bitter because no one cares about him anymore, he will wish to exact his revenge, which is a thought that keeps me up at night.
Draco doesn’t respond because he cannot find the words to express what that means to him, even though Lucius was dead to him long before his final breath. Instead, turns his head, laying it on Harry’s shoulder, and hopes that touch can convey what words cannot.
Hermione and Ron returned with armfuls of chipped glazed clay mugs, and passed them out around everyone, and Harry and Remus followed not five minutes after with big stone jars that they lined up on the table, before pouring for everyone. Draco lifted the mug to his lips and the scent of spiced apple enveloped him. He took a tentative sip and cool apple cider filled his mouth. It was possibly the most delicious thing he had ever tasted. He closed his eyes in bliss as he drank, revelling in the cooling late-spring air against his skin. The moment was so nice he almost forgot he was surrounded by strangers, miles from a home he had never felt fully comfortable in.
Draco’s stomach lurched as the tractor pitched and rolled over the pot-holed and uneven country roads. It was a hair-raising ride and Draco was more than glad when the tractor stopped in front of a farm house even more dilapidated and run down than Harry’s. It looked to be falling down, and Draco worried for the safety of its occupants.
Noise reached them before they even opened the kitchen door. Voices so deep they bled together. When Sirius opened the door, Draco saw Harry and Remus sat with two ginger boys he hadn't met before. They were all shovelling pasta into their mouths in between sentences,  and Draco took a moment to appreciate how much energy farm work must burn.
Dean and Seamus were standing at the door, talking animatedly. They turned when they heard Draco and the girls’ approach.
Before he could even find a seat, a flapjack was shoved into his hand. Everyone was nattering and chattering around him, and he stood awkwardly on realising there were no seats left around their little table. Hermione, his saviour, noticed and scrambled into Harry’s lap whilst beckoning for Draco to take her chair. He smiled at her, before abruptly closing his mouth, worried that there were flapjack oats stuck in his teeth, and took the seat gratefully.
“S’not far now, and s’really not that bad once you’re used to it” Ron said, before his long, muscular legs started striding across the fields again.
It was backbreaking work, but Remus barely seemed to break a sweat and soon fifteen feet of fencing had been replaced. Though he had done next to nothing, Draco felt surprisingly accomplished as he looked at the new posts standing proud in the soil.
“I’ll just incendio it” he said, shrugging. “Potter, in case you hadn’t noticed, you don’t have a wand. None of us do”
That Sunday with Andy, she gushed over her coffee with Narcissa, seeming brighter and more alert than in recent months. Harry’s heart warmed at the improvements he saw in her demeanour. They had a lovely afternoon, Andy playing with Teddy in earnest, and conversing with wit. The next Monday, Draco showed up at 9 sharp, drastically overdressed for a day spent with a baby. Harry was in a pair of cargo trousers that used to belong to Charlie Weasley, and a Weasley jumper. The jumper was soft for Teddy to sleep against, and the cargos were useful as harry could put snacks and toys in the copious pockets. Draco however was in pressed black slacks and a cream sweater that looked as if it cost more than Harry’s entire wardrobe. Harry laughed, “as amazing as you look Draco, those are not suitable clothes for our activities”. He turned back to preparing Teddy’s snacks for the day, missing the way Draco’s cheeks burned red at the compliment. “I don’t own clothes like yours” the blond replied. Much to Harry’s surprise his tone wasn’t sneering or disdainful, just neutrally honest. “okay then Draco, we will take you shopping as your first outing. You’ll need comfy clothes that you don’t mind getting too dirty.” Said Harry. Draco looked horrified at the word ‘dirty’ but nodded, nonetheless.
Harry sat the two of them down, Draco still leaning heavily against him. Harry was so warm, and it was so cold outside.
Ron pulled a face. “don’t I bloody know it, mate. She’s constantly offering to babysit Victoire, and it’s worrying me”
The door knocked and it was entirely too loud and too early and Draco’s head felt like a bomb had exploded in his cerebellum and the light from the window was too bright and the door knocked again, and Draco had no choice but to drag himself out of bed and answer.
Draco leant his head on the cool porcelain of the loo seat and slurred “I’m so sorry Harry, I ruined your new year’s. Go and kiss your girlfriend and leave me I’ll be fi-“ here, Draco demonstrated how very not fine he was by surging up to chun again.
Shit, she’d noticed. God, it keeps getting worse. He forced himself to go down for breakfast, and breathed a sigh of relief that Harry and Ron were there without their female counterparts.
“of course, make yourself at home. Draco, you could help me put him down if you want?” offered Harry. The blond nodded mutely, before rising to follow Harry out of the room.
Anyway, the team was good. They were solid, surprisingly kind boys who did their utmost to make Ron and Harry feel welcome. Whilst Harry felt confident in his physical strength, and his sporting abilities, in past teams it was the group dynamic that sometimes threw him off. He was good, really good, he and Ron both. But he and Ron were a duo that stuck to each other like glue, and at their old school, team members who didn’t understand this resented their dynamic.
Draco was embarrassingly excited to see Harry again. He never put his phone down now, always waiting for a response.
“He was there that first day when you saw Cedric… maybe he thinks you’re gay or something. You know these posh boys aren’t known for their openness and progressive attitudes”
Draco could hardly believe what he was hearing. He was so happy to have Lucius out of the picture. If anything happened with him and Harry, now, he could bring Harry home, properly. Not have to hide and sneak about. But- the house was so big for one person for so long.
“Right. Onto the serious stuff. I don’t know what thoughts you’ve had since last night, but I think you should tell your mum”
“christ Malfoy not like that. I meant that if you shuffled over to me then my body heat would stop you shivering so much. I’m using my fleece as a pillow; you can wear it if you want”
“I am at that. Only five left to lamb now, hopefully not before morning. Ron’s coming in a bit to go up with me”
As the time grew nearer to Christmas, and Draco was faced with the prospect of returning to the manor, his nightmares grew in both frequency and intensity. So much so that the two boys spent more time in the same bed than in different ones, and by early December Draco gave up waiting for the nightmares to come, and would just slide into bed with Harry. Much as it had been with Luna, there was no tension, no awkward touching, just sleep in the safety of companionship. One night, where sleep seemed beyond arms reach, and Draco believed Harry to be asleep, he stared up at the red draping and whispered into the darkness “I don’t want to go home”. A hand gripped his under the covers and said “then don’t. Me, Ron, ‘Mione and Luna are going to Grimmauld for the holidays, and the burrow for just Christmas. It’s your house too, you know. Join us.”
He hadn't realised that he had actually said that, out loud until Harry turned to him, face radiating sadness and said “oh, Draco” with a heaviness that no sixteen-year-old should be able to feel.
Paris, Madrid, Rome and Athens, passed by in a blur of self-exploration and hedonistic enjoyment. In the humid heat of the arrondissments, in between nightclubs in plazas, Harry discovered in a month what he should have come to realise over the course of years. In a letter to Ron and Hermione (who had gone on a romantic getaway to the granger’s Australian residence) he wrote about the god-like Greek he had met, introducing him to the wonders of bisexuality. He talked of the beaches of Sitges, where men could love each other openly, freely, and purely. He talked of fleeting kisses stolen behind the colosseum  and among the ruins of Delphi. Harry danced across Europe, revelling in the gay muggle community he found there, waiting to accept him with open arms.
With this, she swept out of the room with a swish of her robes that would have made even Snape envious.
‘Good for them’, he thought, before pouring himself a vodka lemonade that was 60% vodka and 40% lemonade. Harry grabbed a beer and Draco repressed a shudder. To him, beer was piss water and only the rabble could stand to drink it.
During their conversations, they also resolved to reach out to Andromeda, find out how she had fared since her excommunication from the Black family tree. It took Sirius a day of wracking his brain, but he remembered the surname of the man she had married, and with a name like Andromeda Tonks it wasn’t hard to find her on facebook. Their friend request was still pending, but they both had hope.
“right. I’m going to go to bed” he said, yawning and standing up. its darker than he thought it was when he turns to walk back to the tent, and so much colder without the flame. Harry was warm and toasty in his sleeping bag, just on the brink of sleep when Malfoy stumbled into the tent, swearing as he fell over his bag that he hadn’t seen in the dark. Soon enough, Malfoy found his way into his sleeping bag, and blissful silence and the sound of soft breathing descended on the tent again. Harry was once again brought from the brink of sleep when Malfoy started shaking. The slender boy was clearly freezing.
“Only if you agree to my terms,” Draco replied. Veronica scowled, but waited patiently to hear him out. “First, you must agree to be my girlfriend as well.”
When he was finally ready, Harry began fumbling around as well. He kept one hand protectively near his glasses as he went, worried of being knocked over and losing them and having them broken. Each encounter he had with another student was awkward, groping their way to each other’s shoulders and then leaning in to take a whiff. And each time, Harry felt his nose wrinkle in response to the odors that were just wrong.
Thinking about her friends was probably a mistake, because it made Veronica feel much worse. She could just picture all their reactions, and it hurt so badly. The Weasleys, who were something like a surrogate family to her. Hermione, who had been her lifeline all this past year. And Draco…
“Of course,” Draco said, sitting up properly and fluttering his hands around his head to smooth his hair. “What can I do for you?”
“Good,” Veronica stated. She glanced at her watch, and saw that time was beginning to run low. “I’d better get going. I-” She wasn’t sure what she was trying to say. How could she possibly begin to convey everything she was feeling, everything Draco meant to her, all the gratitude she’d built towards him, all the love? “Thanks, I guess,” she settled on, kicking herself for how not-smooth that was. “For being my best friend. And for coming to say goodbye, and- just thanks. And goodbye.”
“Okay, but I survived, didn’t I?” Veronica asked, even though she could tell it was a losing battle.
“You’re not seriously trusting him, are you?” Ron asked. “Malfoy lies as easily as he breathes. He’s a Slytherin! It’s what they do. He’ll probably stab you in the back right when you least expect it.”
Before long, the potion had been doled out as planned, and everyone turned to Veronica, looking to her for final instructions. She swallowed, wondering why the hell they were looking to her for leadership. Yes, she was the one who would defeat the dark lord, and she’d rallied everyone for Dumbledore’s Army, but defeating the dark lord was something she had to do alone, and as for the days with the DA… things had been different then. Simpler. She hadn’t known about the horcruxes, Dumbledore had been alive to give her advice, it was a completely different ball game back then. A muggle one probably, with only one ball, as opposed to the current situation’s veritable quidditch match with four balls, only all of them were bludgers that had been jinxed to try and kill Veronica. And okay, maybe that wasn’t the best comparison to use, because it made things really intimidating to imagine being chased by four rogue bludgers, and people were still waiting on her to speak.
Given that it was about 11am, Harry accio’d his book, and settled in to read. Soon enough, he heard Draco shift and a leg was thrown over his. Around fifteen minutes later, Draco moved again, curling his whole body against Harry’s side.
“Let’s just leave it there, yeah?” Draco said, and Harry nodded and got up, walking away with his shoulders slumped.
Swept up in his debate with Hermione he didn’t notice the hours passing until he saw that it was dusk and everyone was packing up around him. Ron and Harry had returned at some point, Harry looked calmer than Draco expected him to be given the way Bryn had talked to him, but there was a tension in his body that belied his true emotional state.
It was the Thursday before they went back to school when Harry found himself walking back up the impossibly long driveway to Draco’s house. His mother answered the door again, and much to his surprise, swept Harry into a hug.
“Oh, come on my love” Pansy said, shuffling up until Draco could rest his head on her shoulder, and now it was her turn to run her hands through Draco’s hair, which was almost long enough to be tied in a bun now, given that he hadn't had it cut since arriving at the farm. Pansy said as much, and said she’d leave him a pack of her hair bands. Draco snorted a laugh into her neck and said she could braid it.
“I had a couple of ideas, but a lot of the films I saw looked really sad. I don’t like sad things. I try to avoid sad fiction as much as I can, which rules out La Haine and Entre les Murs” Harry said, and Draco felt a pang at Harry’s stark admission about avoiding sadness.
Soon they were all full and feeling slightly sick at the amount of sugar, with slightly singed mouths and fingertips. It was nice. Harry felt like he could fall asleep right there. He heard Hermione humming, the vibrations going through his shoulder. He joined in, his deep rumbling hum complimenting her higher one. The fire was enchanting, the light and the intense heat and the crackling embers were comforting. Harry felt like he could sit there forever. He knew, though, that if he didn’t go to bed soon, he would fall asleep right there and wake up with frostbite and covered in slugs.
He is woken by strong arms crushing him as he flails, forcing his limbs to stillness. He doesn’t wriggle out of Harry’s embrace when he’s calm, and Harry makes no move to let go. Just as he’s once again on the brink of sleep he hears Harry heave a huge sigh.
Which is incidentally how I ended up getting with Luna. We were sat outside, and he kept trying to talk to me and use this awful nickname he came up with, so she climbed into my lap and kissed him to get him to fuck off.”
On his way to the makeshift bar- bottles of vodka and fizzy drinks as mixers, and more cans of beer than he could hope to count- he saw a glimpse of Hermione and Ron in the corner, necking.
“what the actual fuck, Blaise?” hissed Harry, seething. Blaise just shrugged nonchalantly and said “I told you I wanted you, Potter” before turning and strutting back inside. Harry’s anger was quickly replaced by hurt and panic, and he began to shake. He stumbled back into the club and found Dean seemingly waiting for Seamus by the loos. Harry collapsed onto him.
“Blaise sounds like Ron, only worse. I think that if I had ended up with you, Ron may have done something similar. Insecurities lead to ugly actions, even from good people.” Hermione says at last.
Ron handed the tin to Draco as they climbed back into the tractor. The metal bottom of the tin was comfortably warm in his lap as they drove. The weather was steadily getting hotter and Draco regretted wearing a sweater.
That left him and Malfoy. Malfoy was still staring intently into the fire, but his eyes were glazed over, belaying his intoxicated state. Harry lay back on the grass, and grabbed Malfoy’s elbow, pulling the blond back with him. Malfoy offered no resistance, and they both lay there looking up at the stars. Harry turned his head, admiring Malfoy’s glowing profile.
Harry snorted and Ron said “that’s my girl” before bending down to kiss her cheek, then going back to trying to figure out how to use the camp stove. Harry gave Hermione a brief squeeze before going to help his best mate.
What’s funny to him is that for all his raging hormones, he feels no connection with sex. When he was younger, and heard the boys talking about it with awe and shared none of their enthusiasm, he thought it was because he had never had a relationship, but the older he gets, the more he feels sure that he doesn’t want to have sex.
“I pretended to throw up in the toilet and said I had norovirus so the school called my mum to come at get me. She's here somewhere, she wanted to see you too. All I told her was that your uncle died, I hope that’s okay.”
Back in their dorm later that evening, listening to the soft sounds of some other song that Draco didn’t know, he finally worked up the courage to ask Harry what has been on his mind all day. “Potter, how did you learn how to sing, and what was the song you were singing to Lovegood earlier?” he silently commended himself for remembering not to use the name ‘Looney’ and stared at the wall just beside Harry’s head, not prepared for the effects of the saviour’s eye contact. Harry laughed, deep and warm. “I never learnt how to sing Malfoy, I just sang, a lot, and eventually I got way better. Ask Ron- I sounded like a strangled cat when I first started. The song from earlier is called work song by an Irish muggle singer called Hozier. Luna introduced me to him, and I love his music, it’s really poetic and Hozier perfectly describes the kind of love I want to find one day.”
Later that morning, Draco asks if Pansy and Blaise can stay again. Harry grins at the prospect- he loves his flirtatious friendships with Pansy and Blaise- or rather, they flirt with him and he laughs in response, and ever since the ‘childhood incident’ as Harry calls it, he and the other Slytherins have become very close. Seemingly out of guilt, Pansy and Blaise- but mainly Pansy- have become very protective of Harry, which Harry finds endearing, if completely unnecessary. They seemed particularly affected by the starvation part of Harry’s past, and the first month of Harry and Draco’s relationship involved many dinners at the luxury Chelsea flat that Pansy and Blaise shared, until everyone agreed that Harry’s cooking was objectively nicer, and they went back to dinners at Grimmauld. They hadn’t stayed longer than just dinner since the conception of Harry and Draco’s relationship, though, and Harry was excited at the prospect of them staying again.
“Oh, I don’t. I don’t know. I just loved that he saw all of her, or almost all of her, and still wanted her, you know?”
“I can also appreciate it’s hard to spend your birthday with people you barely know” Harry replied, and Draco thought he maybe looked a bit guilty, as if it was his fault, though Draco supposed it kind of was. Harry definitely could have made more of an effort to include Draco in his little group.
“Harry. I didn’t know you were in this house” Cedric simpered, ignoring Ron entirely. He lewdly dragged his eyes down Harry’s bare chest, where the duvet pooled around his stomach, and Harry resolved to start wearing t-shirts to bed from now on.
The next morning, Harry woke him and Hermione up and told Draco they had cows to milk, and told Hermione that Sirius was waiting for her in the big house. The tension between them was palpable and Draco felt distinctly uncomfortable. The feeling only grew as he and Harry walked to the milking barn together in complete silence. Harry kept shooting little glances at him that Draco noticed but said nothing about, and Harry set about preparing the cows, still having said nothing to Draco. This was worse than the beginning, Draco decided as he set about opening the little gates to let the cows through.
The winning team ran back to the changing rooms, whilst the losing team slunk off to their bus to go back to their school and lick their wounds.
“I've offered Sirius one of the boys’ rooms, now they're all at uni. Would you both like to stay here?”
“Reet. Try these” Ron said from where he was bent over the chest of drawers, opening them up and chucking trousers out. “I’m sure Harry can stretch to tops for you but just in case I’ll lend you some of Gin’s.”
She was right- Draco had insisted he wear a pair of ‘going out’ jeans. These were black, and Draco had dug out a very expensive, tight mustard-yellow t-shirt that he had been gifted by Ginny after she received her first quidditch players paycheck. The colour matched his dark skin wonderfully.
There’s ‘bien que’ for although, and then many others that express abstract things, like wishes. So, for that you would use ‘je souhaite que…’ like, ‘je souhaite que je fasse plus de sport’ right? You can use that for an example on question two…”
“would you like to hold Teddy, Mrs Malfoy?” asked Harry, holding the small boy out towards her. She smiled, and scooped the boy up before cradling him close to her chest. She lost herself in cooing at him, and playing with him, and it warmed Harry’s heart to see Teddy gain yet another doting aunt figure. Harry turned away, jolted out of his reverie when Draco cleared his throat.
“There was one on Netflix though, called La Vie Scolaire, that I liked the look of. It's about students at a school in the cite, so they are all working class, living on the estate. Sound good?”
Draco squeezed her even tighter and said “yes, of course you can come and spend time with me, I would love that” Into her hair. She then released him and he looked down and said “it’s probably a no on the film, but I really appreciate your invite”
“You don’t deserve to rest on hallowed ground. You don’t deserve to rest at all. If there is a god, you should be burning in hell for what you did to me, but I don’t care about that. I'm not going to wish that on you. All I care is that you’re gone, and I will never, ever have to see you again” Harry said, voice low, in his own approximation of a funeral speech. He scooped up some soil and sprinkled it on the mound, to soften the blow of his words, though he wasn’t sure why. Perhaps because he was indeed on hallowed ground. Perhaps because he didn’t want the other occupants of the graveyard to think he had no respect for the dead. He had respect for the dead, of course. The good dead, the ‘glorious’ dead as soldiers were often called, which was how he viewed his parents, but he had no respect for Vernon Dursley.
“and then- get this! I got here just as Diggory did, and then I had to hide in your bathroom for what felt like hours as I waited for him to leave the whole wing! Nice hair mousse, by the way” Harry said, and then winked at him.
“Thanks, lad. I’m off to do the rounds. When you’re done here, you can head back to yours. If we need you, we’ll call you” Remus said, before leaving Draco alone in the kitchen. Draco heaved a sigh and pushed up the sleeves of his sweater, before making his way over to the sink and starting his cleaning. It was cathartic, and he lost himself in the suds as he worked, contemplating how the past day had gone.
Harry unscrewed an Ella’s Kitchen smoothie pouch for Teddy, and laughed at how the boy got it all over his chubby ruddy cheeks rather than in his mouth, and Harry ended up having to use his hoodie sleeve to clean Teddy’s face.
The bedroom was even smaller than the living room, but at least it had a double bed. Only issue was that the bed left almost no space for anything else. There was a window with a little sit-able sill at the foot of the bed, and a little bedside table with one drawer and and a lamp on top. It was a lot nicer than Draco had expected, and though it was mid-may it conjured images of autumn evenings spent in bed with a warm drink and a good book.
This was not how things worked. Ron was completely eschewing the informal-yet-formal hierarchy that existed in this school. The hierarchy which dictated, no matter how much Draco believed he should have been at the top, that rugby A-team members were the crème de la crème of the Hogwarts halls, and thus were not so considerate as this.
“I could never, Pans. you’re my everything” he said, kissing the top of her head. She hummed and within five minutes her breathing indicated that she was fast asleep.
“Yeah. Having Pansy here is the best thing ever” Draco responded, smiling, happily aware of the comforting weight of her head on his thigh. “I hadn’t even realised how much I missed her. It’ll kill me to see her go again” he sighed, suddenly realising that he couldn’t keep Pansy in this little idyll he had found, that she would be returning to London the very next day.
“yeah, you say that because you didn’t have to go months without sex waiting for the bloody thing, and in the aftermath of the birth. You’ve got it easy” Ron huffed as he descaled the salmon.
“I’m Draco, it’s nice to meet you” Draco replied, deciding to leave unmentioned the earlier slight of their ignoring him.
“ I never want him to forget he’s loved” said Harry as he began taking out Teddy’s pyjamas. “I’ll take one of the two of you, in a minute, though I’m sure if your mother has anything to do with it there will be many future opportunities to take more.” Harry said, turning back to the changing table he had put Teddy on. “do you want to do it?” he asked, holding the soft blue pyjama onesie out to Draco. “oh I, I’ve never held a child before” stuttered Draco, face going pink. “oh Draco, it’s like the best feeling in the world.” Exclaimed Harry. “grab a pillow and sit on that armchair, and put the pillow on your lap” he instructed. Due to his sleepy state, Teddy was much easier to dress, and then Harry went to Draco and gently lay the baby on his pillowed lap.
“Just that we’ve been preparing for this for quite some time now,” Michael Corner smirked from where he was perched.
“I will.” He pressed their foreheads together for a few short seconds of eternity, and then let go, and Veronica knew it was time to go. This time, she really did go past him, putting the ring and cloak on as she went. She felt his eyes on her as she walked away, and knew that even if he couldn’t see her, he’d keep watch for a while.
Strangely enough, that was all it took to create regular correspondence between the two. At first it was just bickering- Malfoy complaining that Harry was being unfair and Harry complaining back that Malfoy was the one being unfair with all his demands. But even with all their complaints, there was a sort of camaraderie in it that Harry would never have expected. Soon it became complaints about things other than each other- how much homework their professors had assigned, how boring a certain class was, how intense their team’s quidditch practices were, and so on. From there, it just became general commentary, like when Malfoy saw fit to compare Professor Flitwick’s moustache to a caterpillar, and Harry replied by commenting that caterpillar moustaches were one thing, but that was nothing compared to the way the ancient runes professor’s eyebrows looked like they were stolen from a great horned owl. Malfoy had replied by sending Harry a detailed drawing of a mournful-looking great horned owl without the characteristic tufts, and Harry had guffawed loudly in the middle of transfiguration and cost Gryffindor ten points.
aren’t doing anything,” Veronica said firmly. “Ron and Hermione and I have something we need to find, so we’ll be going to do that, but the rest of you-”
“Please, of course I’d thought of that.” Draco rolled his eyes. “The idea was to make the password ‘Potter’, but never say
“Harry, you’re not honestly telling me that you made a decision like this based on something as unreliable as his scent, are you?” Hermione scolded. “Scents change. They can be affected by so many factors, from a person’s mood to who they’ve been around. They are not an accurate judge of character.”
“Thought I’d find you here,” a voice said, interrupting Veronica’s thoughts. She looked around, startled, and saw Draco, but he didn’t seem to be talking to anyone. Instead, he was staring out over the castle grounds, his gaze distant. Realizing he must be talking to her, Veronica removed her cloak with a sigh.
“Actually, yeah,” she replied. “Before I can kill Volde- Voldy, someone’s gotta take out his snake. I can’t explain why, but the snake has to go first. Can you do that?”
Veronica’s jaw dropped and she stared a moment before finding the words to respond. “Don’t even think about it you bloody bastard,” she said with flat anger.
All in all, it was a complicated process that was far more trouble than it was worth- not to mention the morality and safety of it was frequently questioned- and would have been done away with years before were it not for the fact that it was so popular with the students. One headmaster had indeed tried to abolish the practice, only for the students to band together and hold small parties of their own. So despite the claims that it was essentially sanctioning underage sex or ruining bloodlines since some pureblood students found themselves unexpectedly in a bond with a halfblood or worse, the practice persisted.
And then the door opened again, and Neville said, “Ah, here they are.” Veronica looked to see who it was, and caught sight of two wizards carefully floating a large cauldron together. For a second, the cauldron distracted Veronica, so she didn’t notice the wizards at first, but when she did, her jaw almost dropped in shock. Blaise Zabini certainly was a surprise, but the other person made Veronica’s heart throb painfully. Because two years ago, it would have been a given that that person would be present here. Two years ago, that person had even been Veronica’s best friend. But then, two years ago, on that horrible night when Sirius had died, that person, Draco Malfoy, had been captured trying to avenge Veronica’s godfather for her. Bellatrix had taken Draco, promising to teach her nephew to be a “proper” wizard. Snape had spent all the following summer trying to convince Voldemort that he had been training Draco to be a spy for the death eaters, and that Draco would be more use if he was set free, but in the end, Draco was only released after taking the dark mark and being tasked with killing Dumbledore. There had been no way Draco could disobey Voldemort, and from then on, he had reluctantly distanced himself from Veronica and her allies, allowing himself to become their enemy.
“Oh please, you need it more than anyone else, Miss Chosen One,” Draco drawled. “Especially if killing the dark lord is as complicated as you claim.”
“We’ll have to have people evacuate,” Veronica suggested, trying to think of ways to buy herself some time for what she needed to do. “The less people who stay, the less who can get hurt, right?”
Because of what she’d sensed from the connection with Voldemort, Veronica knew that the dark lord would be keeping his snake close to his side, which meant that to kill the snake she needed to find the dark lord. It’d be like a child’s game of hide-and-go-seek: “ready or not, here I come,” only Veronica was saying those words to herself, not to the person she was seeking. If only she’d been able to kill the snake back in Godric’s Hollow…
But even if she’d killed Nagini then, it wouldn’t change the fact that she needed to find Voldemort now. It’d make killing him a bit easier, sure- a lot easier, really- but, well, it was all a sort of mental thing, wasn’t it? Sure, Veronica had the infamous Gryffindor courage in spades, but even she couldn’t help but to hesitate somewhat when faced with the prospect of going head to head with one of the worst dark lords of the current era. And while she had, as she’d told the others previously, fought Voldemort before, they too had been right when they’d said she hadn’t exactly won against him. Not really. She’d had her mum’s protection to save her from Quirrel, Fawkes to save her in the chamber, her now-broken wand to save her in the graveyard, Dumbledore to save her in the ministry. None of which could help her now.
“Wow, so smart, give the omega a NEWT,” the Ravenclaw drawled. “We know that little tidbit of irrelevant information, dipshit. That doesn’t change the fact that you owe us. I coulda been mated by now, except my omega had hopes that the great alpha Harry Potter might look her way. So you owe me an apology for cockblocking, and you owe her an apology for giving her false hopes.”
“Plus you barely got out of some of those scrapes alive,” Ron chipped in unnecessarily. “Like in first year when you ended up in hospital after we went after Quirrel-”
“You don’t stop caring about someone just because they’re gone, kiddo,” Veronica’s father chipped in. “After all, the stone you’re holding wouldn’t exist if you did. He’ll still love you.”
Still, things did work out, in a way, since Veronica had finally had the good sense to seek information from the ghosts, and had been able to get answers from the ghost of Ravenclaw’s daughter herself. From there, it was a simple matter of going back to the Room of Requirement and asking it for the place where things were hidden, and sure enough, she was able to find the diadem, but then she ran into Crabbe and Goyle in the process.
“I love you,” he said after pulling away. “I always did, and always will. Go save the world Veronica. We’ll take care of the rest.”
“Severus, Hagrid will be available to retrieve the girl and transport her to Diagon Alley, but once there, he will have some very important and rather urgent business to attend to for me, and will not be able to look after her. I need you to do this. You did promise to protect the girl.”
For the first few minutes, Harry just stood there, overwhelmed by all the sudden scents that were crashing into his olfactory sensors, making his eyes water. A few people bumped into him, already beginning their search, but he pushed them away before they could sniff him.
“And what do you think the past year has been like?” Seamus asked, also butting in. Hell, at this point, pretty much everyone in the room was listening in, ready to chip in at any moment. This was no longer a conversation between Veronica, Ron, Hermione, and Neville, if indeed it ever had been. “We know bloody well what the death eaters might do to us, Veronica. We’ve seen hell here, and we know there’s more in store if we don’t stop it now.”
And didn’t that just beat all; she’d been told all along that she had to be the one to finish off the dark lord, except she couldn’t possibly do that, since she would definitely predecease him. She’d just have to trust that to her friends.
“Fine, I’ll take it with me,” Veronica sighed, admitting defeat. She plucked the potion from where it still hovered and pocketed it. There was a small part of her that was glad for the potion, but at the same time… If she didn’t accept the vial, then someone else could have it. Someone else could take the potion, and it might make all the difference between whether they survived or perished. But then again, if she didn’t take it, and as a result, lost, then they might all die anyway. It wasn’t like the dark lord would be merciful towards anyone after they openly resisted him.
“Because they weren’t the ones who’ve been keeping the students together all year,” Veronica replied seriously. “And besides, in some ways, we’re not so different, you and I. So if there were any reason I weren’t able to finish things, I think it’d probably be you to do it. And- and I’m not making any sense right now, am I?”
It took a few tries to find something suitable to send Malfoy. Harry’s hand-me-downs from Dudley were no good, since they were obviously muggle. His Weasley sweaters were too identifiable, and his school robes had the Gryffindor crest, as well as being something he couldn’t afford to lend away for an indefinite period of time. He considered sending the gloves he wore for quidditch, but not many students who weren’t on school teams had a pair of seeker’s gloves with them so those might give him away as well. He finally decided on a handkerchief that he’d bought for cleaning his glasses, which was a plain cream color and shouldn’t be too offensive. He only hoped Malfoy wouldn’t complain about the size.
“So we’ll set up more defenses,” Veronica pressed. “Hiding places, traps, I don’t know, that’s really your area of expertise, Mione. Whatever it takes to give us an edge. The potion should help, right? It does have a way of pointing your thoughts in the right direction after all…”
“So what are we doing next?” Neville asked, and Veronica felt her heart sink. She’d wanted to sneak into Hogwarts unnoticed and fight alone, not get her friends involved.
“Guess we’ll need a pensieve then,” Veronica murmured, half to herself. “I don’t suppose Dumbledore’s old one is still in his office, is it?” she asked Draco, who nodded. “And the password?” she asked.
“Don’t misunderstand me, Veronica,” Draco said, smiling painfully, so painfully that Veronica felt like bursting into tears from the torment spilling from his eyes and flowing into whoever might meet them. “If there was a way to get a happy ending, one where I could keep you with me and keep you safe, I would. The last thing I want is for you to die. But I know you’d never forgive yourself if you don’t do whatever it is that you must do that will result in your death. I can’t make you suffer like that just so I can have whatever fleeting stolen time we’d get before the dark lord hunted you down. And if I take that ring… I think the temptation would be too great. To do as the second brother did, and choose to join you so as to be with you properly.”
Harry tucked the portkey into his robes so he could return it later, his head instinctively swiveling to try and look around. But of course, he couldn’t see anything, thanks to the spell Flitwick had used. He waited for the antidote to be handed out, biting his lip nervously, wondering what kind of person he would be claimed by. A beta would be nice, with their tendency towards level-headedness. Most likely, they would be the ones ready to accept the kind of relationship Harry sought. But at the same time, a beta’s claim was more likely to be challenged or ignored by those who held the sexist opinion that omegas could only be properly claimed and sexually satisfied by an alpha. As such, it would be safer for Harry to let an alpha claim him, preferably one who could hold their own in a duel. But Harry didn’t want some domineering hot-head who was fueled by their sex drive, which is what a lot of the alphas at the scent party would be.
“How are you so good at this?” Draco asked, the words sounding stuffy, his nose blocked from the crying.
“I mean, I guess, yeah. I mean more someone to put up with me complain about my father even though he’s allowed me to live in the lap of luxury. Someone to put up with me changing my outfit three times before I leave the house. That sort of stuff. I suppose Pansy does that, but you know, she’s a girl” Draco said, pulling a face at the last bit.
“i suppose” Draco said haltingly. “I sometimes feel like it means I can't give someone something important”
“I wouldn’t worry, Draco. You’re a catch” Harry said, winking at him, before taking his hat off, running his hand through his hair and scooting closer across the bed covers to Draco.
Bolstered by the darkness, and perhaps by the fact that Harry pretty much couldn’t run away, Draco said
The outside world seems so far away in this moment, but I know that its lurking out there, ready to destroy my happiness with a click of its fingers. I burrow impossibly closer to Potter, letting his deep breathing wash over me like a soothing balm. Maybe, just maybe, it won’t be so bad.
Draco saw tears rolling down the faces of both Hermione and Harry now. Silent, but bold in their grief.
“that’s not dinner, Potter” he snorted when he saw that Potter’s arms were full of chocolate frogs and cauldron cakes and muggle biscuits that he had obviously smuggled in. Potter was wearing his big fleece and it smelt like bonfire and Draco just wanted to bury his face in it.
“Harry.” Draco said, turning to him and fear flooded Harry that Draco would try and make him talk about it.
“It’s okay to love them, You know. I have a brother, Regulus. I adore him with my heart and soul. He hasn't spoken to me since I left. He’s some hot-shot CEO now and I can stalk him on facebook, make sure he’s still alive but…”
“I think what Ron means to say is that we’re a bit surprised to see either of you, Zabini. You or Draco,” Hermione explained.
‘Potter’. You’d say it in a sentence or phrase, like ‘Potter will fall’ or ‘Potter needs to learn how to use a comb’- that one is certainly true, dear-  and the door would still open.”
He felt a nose bump the crook of his neck, requesting permission, and his heart soared. He was sure that his scent would soon be filled with pheromones that would indicate his assent, but just to be clear, he tilted his head for better access and raised a hand until he felt silky hair, which he pushed downwards, encouragingly. He pushed a little too hard and caused his would-be-claimant to crash into his shoulder a bit, and they reached up to flick his chest in retaliation before repositioning themself. There was a pregnant moment in which Harry felt his heart pounding out of his chest, followed by a touch of breath on his exposed scent gland, and then…
“I literally couldn’t,” Draco replied acidly. “But somehow I doubt you’ve been forced into any magically binding oaths forcing you to act alone, so let. Us. Bloody. Help you.”
“Didn’t the announcement say not to take any potions since they might mix badly with the antidote to the suppressants?” Harry pointed out. “Besides, why would I take Polyjuice potion when no one’s going to see me? And where would I even get some?”
Since the dawn of Hogwarts, professors and prefects had been finding students engaged in inappropriate activities in various places around the school. Of course there had been rules in place against that sort of thing, but rules only served as a deterrent for a select few. Even when one bygone headmaster of yore had opted to make expulsion the punishment for engaging in sexual intercourse, students had still sought ways to relieve their needs. As a result, the subsequent headmaster had thought up the convoluted idea of “scent parties”.
“I’m looking for someone,” Veronica said. “My best friend, to be precise. Skin that’s never seen the sun, hair that couldn’t be whiter if it were bleached, kinda pointy, a bit of a git, makes a good ferret.”
Neville directed everyone to pair off and line up together. As he did so, Draco and Zabini began conjuring up small vials and filling them with potion, then floating them over to whichever pair was next in line. Veronica didn’t pay those happenings much mind though, since she was trying to think of how to find the horcrux. Obviously it wouldn’t be somewhere anyone would simply stumble upon it, but where? The dungeons? Some hidden room even the marauders hadn’t found? A dusty old storage room, or a long-forgotten attic? And wherever it was, how was she supposed to find it in a matter of hours when no one had found it in however many hundreds of years the school had been around?
“So basically, hold onto it unless you run into any snakes,” Seamus said, crossing his arms and nodding. “Got it.”
“I’d say that sounds like a good way to go blind, but you already practically are,” Draco commented. Veronica retaliated by making a rude gesture that she’d learned from Ron at him.
“If you’re done chatting, I’d like to put this cauldron down sometime in the next five years,” Draco seethed from behind Zabini, looking irritable. “Or at least before Old Snakeface comes marching in and kills us all.”
“In other words, I know it’s too soon to talk about marriage, but that’s ultimately what I’m looking for from you,” Draco stated.
“But every time you two see each other, you flinch,” Hermione pointed out. “Both of you. And then you try and pretend the other isn’t there at all, almost like something happened between you two…”
“Oh, I see. I can do that,” Harry said, nodding. “In return, I want your protection should anyone else make unwanted advances towards me. Sound fair?”
“It’s supposed to be romantic, you arse. It’s in all the muggle movies,” she informed him haughtily. Not that she’d know, since the Dursleys weren’t exactly keen on letting her watch TV with them, nor were they inclined to give her money to go to the cinema herself.
in fact our fight, and has been for quite some time now. But even if you’re right, that doesn’t change the fact that we need this potion, especially you. The goal may have been to dose as many of our allies as possible to create the best possible outcome, but I can guarantee you that Draco at least, and probably Snape too, certainly had you in mind while brewing this stuff. Don’t you dare put their efforts, or the efforts of everyone present, to waste.”
“That was if anyone might hear us, idiot,” Draco retorted. “Obviously there’d be no need if there was no chance of being overheard.”
“Then we’d better start looking,” Hannah Abbot said practically. “And you’re sure it’s in the school?”
“Thank you for looking after our son for so long,” Mr. Malfoy said coolly, with a curt perfunctory bow.
“Oh bugger, you’re actually right,” Malfoy breathed, then added with more certainty, “which is more evidence that you can’t possibly be Potter.”
“Oh,” Veronica said lamely. “Er, I was just joking, you know. But, um…” She trailed off, uncertain how to brush off this awkwardness but not wanting to leave on such a note.
“Hardly,” Draco scoffed. “You’re too noble to turn out any other way. Too Gryffindor. You’re a Potter, and that means you’ve got lion in your blood.”
Eventually though, Veronica couldn’t avoid things any longer. When Hermione came to tell her that Rita Skeeter was about to come up with her own version of events if Veronica didn’t show up for an interview, Veronica asked her friend to buy her ten more minutes, then, once Hermione was gone, she reached over and gently shook Draco awake.
“Hermione, aside from Ravenclaw’s whatever, we still have two more of those things to deal with,” Veronica hissed back. “We can’t kill you-know-who until we take care of all that. If we fight now, it’ll all be in vain.”
So really, Harry shouldn’t have been surprised when he was cornered in the hallway by three seventh years who were obviously alphas, even with their scents suppressed.
“I am,” Draco admitted. “But that doesn’t change the fact that you have a smile that could make the middle of winter feel like summer. The world needs warm people like you. Which is why it’s such a waste that you have to die.”
“A feeling? I thought that sort of thing was for Gryffindors,” Veronica teased, before the words really sank in. “Oh. A feeling. You took the potion.”
“There’s a bust in Ravenclaw Tower that shows Ravenclaw wearing it,” Cho said, speaking up before Luna could. Which, admittedly, might have been for the best, considering what Luna could be like. “It’s really just a tiara, a rather delicate looking one.”
“Much obliged, Potter,” Malfoy said, and he actually sounded a little bit grateful. “Now let’s get out of this godforsaken hall before either of us passes out from all these odors. Or worse, someone sees us talking and realizes I’ve claimed you.”
For a second, Veronica’s breath caught in her throat, touched by the unexpected compliment. Of course, Draco had to ruin things by continuing, “Though obviously, not as lovely as me. Still, with us both on the broom, the sunset would end up being overshadowed, so it would be completely moot.”
Having downed the potion, Veronica let her feet take her where they would, and before long she found herself face to face with Neville. Perfect.
“Gee, thanks,” Veronica drawled sarcastically. “Glad to know you were planning on badmouthing me every chance you got.”
“You know I’m just joking,” he replied. “About me being lovelier I mean. I was serious about the rest. You’ve always been quite breathtaking to me. With or without a sunset.”
“Sure thing, Vee,” Ron said, waving. “Good luck.” He laughed, chortling “heh, luck,” to himself, and Veronica rolled her eyes as she waved back.
“You forgot second year where she got poisoned by basilisk venom and had to be saved by Fawkes,” Ginny added. Veronica nearly moaned at how everyone was ganging up on her.
Of course, some helpful soul had piped up and asked if she meant his next rut, and she had replied that no, of course she didn’t mean his next rut, ruts were for alphas and alphas never had whorl fingerprints, let alone ten of them like Harry, which she’d noticed during the palmistry unit, hadn’t everyone else? And of course, the Hufflepuffs had gossiped innocently after the lesson, and soon it had spread around, and before you knew it half of Ravenclaw house was trying to confirm whether or not alphas could have whorl fingerprints and half the school had heard crazy and completely unfounded rumors, but the long and short of it was that everyone had heard Harry was an omega, and he couldn’t even deny it because it was fucking true and, as Ron and Hermione had pointed out all those months before, Harry sucked at lying.
“It’s because I’m the Chosen One,” Veronica said wryly. “The dark lord chose me to be the other person in the prophecy, and now I have to fulfill it. But you’re right, it is bollocks. I was really looking forward to after the war.”
“I can’t do that,” Draco replied sadly. “There’s only you, Veronica. No one else will ever be able to take your place.”
“I’d actually recommend waiting to take it,” Hermione countered. “Only use it if you are in danger. That way, you can guarantee its effects will protect you when you need them, and won’t wear off prematurely.”
They ended up staying like that for about three hours. It was incredibly boring to Veronica to just sit there while Draco slept, but she was hardly going to move and risk waking him up, even if her arm started tingling about half an hour in. Besides, it gave her an awfully convenient excuse to avoid anyone who might want to make a fuss over what had happened the night before. It almost made Veronica want to go back to living on the run, realizing that now that she truly had defeated Voldemort, that she’d be thrust back into the spotlight. For a few seconds, she almost regretted her decision to come back to life even, since she doubted she’d ever have another second of privacy ever again.
“I didn’t,” he replied airily, still staring out at the grounds. “But I had a feeling if I said something you’d pop up.”
As the line moved forward and Harry stepped up to where Professor Flitwick was casting the privacy spells and handing out portkeys, he could feel dozens of hopeful eyes on him. After all, who wouldn’t want to become the mate of the boy-who-lived, especially if he was an alpha. Finally, it was his turn, and with a wave of Flitwick’s wand, Harry was robbed of his senses. He held out his hand like he’d seen those before him do, and his portkey was dropped into his palm. There was the momentary disorientation as the portkey took effect, and he just barely managed not to go sprawling as the portkey dropped him in place in the great hall.
“Right, sorry,” Zabini said, and moved forward, maneuvering carefully so that he edged his way through the other students while keeping his wand trained on the cauldron. Draco followed, his movements stiff as they walked, and as they finally lowered the cauldron, his face momentarily became a pained grimace.
“Hmph,” Snape grumbled. “Once the girl realizes her celebrity status, she’ll no doubt take advantage of it. I won’t have her being a bad influence on Draco, or worse, mistreating him out of a sense of superiority. He’s had enough abuse in his life.”
“Potter, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound right now?” Zabini asked condescendingly. “Nevermind, obviously you don’t. You wouldn’t be Potter if you did. But the fact of the matter is this: this
“Yes,” Draco nodded, finally turning towards her but keeping his gaze askance. “I wasn’t planning to, originally, but I thought I might need it. Sev didn’t tell me anything about the memories he left for you, but he did tell me that when I gave them to you, I should make sure I didn’t leave anything left unsaid to you.” Draco looked up then, his eyes meeting Veronica and practically piercing straight through her with the sorrow in them. He knew.
“Which is why you need to let us help you,” Ginny insisted. “Tell us what needs to be done. We’ll help.”
Draco just stares dumbly as Harry leaves, the words ‘it would be good to see you’ circling in his brain.
Draco fought a shudder. His aunt Bella was bordering on insane. She reminded Draco of the Trunchbull, which her cruelty and utter hatred of children. He liked his aunt Andromeda, but his father had forbidden them from seeing her, as she had married a poor factory worker from the Black Country. His mum and her wrote to each other, and sometimes his mum would sneak off to see her on the pretext of shopping, and take Draco with her, which he loved.
Now out of the shower, Harry put on his ‘pull’ playlist, and began to get dressed. The clothes were nothing too special; his best jeans, a tight Beatles t shirt and his trusty converse. It was the face and hair that Dean had meant when he told Harry to dress ‘properly’. Harry had shown Dean when taking Dean to his first gay bar to introduce him to his new community. His favourite song came on, and he got to work.
He couldn’t find Potter, so went over to collect the necessary items for his backpack. He was given a roll mat that didn’t look nearly thick enough to make sleeping in a tent comfortable, a sleeping bag in a garish orange colour, food that consisted of ‘instant noodles’, something he had never even heard of, let alone eaten or tried to make- a water bottle and a camp stove. He tried to lift his back to go and collect a tent but realised with a panicky feeling that he wasn’t strong enough to lift it. His breathing started to shallow, and he felt sweat prickle down his back. This was too humiliating.
He returned to the car with Harry, Hermione and Remus, and they drove home in tired yet companionable silence. When they arrived back at the farm, Sirius was talking to the Weasley matriarch as Charlie and Ron carried out the big bench from the kitchen into the stretch of grassy lawn between the big farmhouse and Draco’s little cottage. Once it was set down and Bill and one of the twins- Draco was hard pressed to tell them apart- had brought out the benches, Molly ushered Sirius into a seat and the others all piled in around him as Harry and Remus went off into one of the many barns, and Hermione and Ron disappeared back into the kitchen.
“What the fuck are you doing here, you bitch?” he asked, laughing as she squeezed her thighs even tighter around his abdomen.
Draco steels himself, and walks out of the room to his mother’s library, where he knows she will be.
It was starting to get dark, and really quite cold. Pansy had hated almost every minute of the day. She hated watching the golden trio in action, all smiles and jokes and touching each other. She was grateful for Draco, at least, but she could have done without Blaise’s insistence on talking to the Gryffindors, blurring the lines just enough that it would seem rude for Pansy and Draco no to join in. Not to mention that their dinner had been awful, and completely unsatisfying.
Harry rootled around the living room until he found his baby carrier. It was large, and made of African wax fabric. It was from his dad’s family and his dad had used it to carry Harry around before he had been killed. Now, harry expertly wrapped Teddy up in the vibrant fabric, before pocketing the young boys’ snack boxes and milk bottle for the day, and heading to the door. “we’re going full muggle today Draco, which means public transport. Hope you don’t mind” Draco didn’t know what that meant, and so just silently followed Harry out of the door. Soon he found himself in an abominable metal tube, aptly named ‘the tube’ according to Harry that was hurtling through underground tunnels like a basilisk. He felt distinctly nauseous, and hoped that this wouldn’t be a common occurrence for the next 18 months. Harry, however, was in his element. He was currently chatting to a pretty female muggle who was cooing over Teddy. “you seem awfully young to have a baby” she said, smiling at Harry coyly. Draco stiffened at the flirtatious tone of voice, but Harry laughed. “yea he’s not mine. I’m just the godfather on babysitting duty” he replied, giving Teddy his finger to nibble on. “and is anyone helping you with that” the woman said, smirking. Harry just laughed again, and then to Draco’s surprise Harry gestured at him saying, “yea, this posh twat over here. He’s not much help at the moment though, he’s never been on the tube before. It’s been like having two babies to look after.” Draco smiled at the woman now, or tried to. He hoped it came across as friendly rather than just a baring of teeth, but the woman bared her teeth right back, so he didn’t feel too bad. Then Harry grabbed his arm saying, “this is our stop!” and dragged Draco off the tube. So far, Draco was hating his muggle experience, but then he emerged onto street level and was surrounded by massive buildings with lovely architecture and shops full of clothes. “this is probably your personal heaven, Draco. Welcome to oxford street!” said Harry, a cheerful glint in his eye.
Greg, Vince and Theo were all in Ron’s economics class, and they formed a small study group where they would collaborate on essays and do projects together. As Theo and Harry were in English together, they also worked together often, discussing the merits of various texts. Much to his disappointment, Draco’s class were doing different set texts to Harry and Theo’s, and so he was largely unable to join in. Theo, Harry, Ron and Blaise also all did History, and the large number of subjects they had in common brought the group together often.
He made it to the next floor up but then heard the creak of the stairs. Shit. He would be seen by Cedric if he tried the second staircase now. He saw a maintenance cupboard at the end of the corridor and ran for it, pulling the door closed quietly behind him.
Harry decided to go to the funeral. It was a decision that shocked everyone but Hermione, who understood immediately.
The anger brought on by Cedric’s presence had wiped the presence of the drunken guest in their bathroom from Harry’s mind and he suddenly remembered. Shit. The longer Cedric stayed the higher their chances of being found out.
His giddy mood was cut like a knife when we opened the door to his dorm to the screams and cries of his roommate, clearly in the throes of a nightmare.
“if I knew he would be sick as much as Teddy I wouldn’t have said yes to letting him stay here” groaned Harry, “but as he is unfortunately my roommate, I better go check on him”
“That's a lot of children” Draco said, dumbfounded that anyone in the modern day and age would have any more than three kids.
Harry smirked and waved his hands. Soon a smooth jazz-like sound filled the room and Harry and Dean started to roll their bodies laughing and dancing together. Then Harry started to sing.
When dessert had been cleaned away, Harry said “Draco if you take everyone through to the living room? I’ll put Teddy down for the night.”
He was interrupted from this retrospection by Dean, Seamus and Harry getting louder than Draco thought humanly possible
As Harry wondered through the corridors, he felt the memories of the battle weighing on him heavily. Over the summer he had come to realise that happiness was a choice he had to make, not just a feeling that one happened upon unexpectedly. Whilst Harry wanted nothing more than to crawl into bed and cry about all he had lost to the deep timbre of Nina Simone, the comforting tristesse of Lorde, he knew he would never leave the bed again. He resolved that for Eighth year, above all else, he as Harry James Potter, would always choose happiness. With that in mind, he began to skip through the blessedly empty halls, arriving in the common room flushed, out of breath and smiling too widely for a war veteran.
“I'm sorry. I can’t talk about it. I can’t bring myself to. I wanted you to know, though, and Ron is the only person who knows everything”
It was so cute how nervous he was. Harry hadn't considered partnering with anyone else, really. Their merged friendship groups meant Draco was the ideal partner for projects like this.
He and Sirius drove home to find Draco sitting on the doorstep. Harry stepped out of the car and Draco flung himself at him, wrapping his arms tight around Harry’s middle.
The final one was a collection of two photos in a slideshow. The first was Harry and Ron in their rugby gear, with a beautiful black girl sitting on their shoulders as they hoisted her up. She was clutching a book and laughing, as Harry and Ron grinned at the camera. The second was of him and Ron, standing on a rugby pitch, sweaty and covered in mud. Ron was kissing Harry on the cheek as Harry stared at the camera, laughing. The caption read ‘she’s our trophy’. This girl must obviously be Hermione. She looked so lovely that Draco could hardly be jealous.
“Thats- thats okay. I understand, I think. And honestly if it had been the other way round and Harry had come to my house and wormed his way into my life there indefinitely, I would have acted like the bratty private schoolboy I very much used to be.” Draco said, trying to be reassuring. Hermione sighed, but her facial expression settled into one of calmness, which Draco took as a win.
“Ron says they’re in King George. You can take us there, right? And you're staying for the party, yeah?”
He vacated the chair to let Sirius sit down, and just as Sirius did so a facebook notification flashed across the screen reading ‘Andromeda Tonks has accepted your friend request! Say Hi!’
“Mam this is Harry’s new boy for the summer” Ron explained. “He’s bought nowt proper t'wear so we’re here t'see if any of Ginny’s’ll fit ‘im”
“No! god no. look don’t tell anyone okay?” Harry asked, leaning across the table, radiating earnestness.
Speaking of Harry, he was sitting a little ways down looking very ashamed of himself between Ron and Sirius. Remus was sitting opposite him and was giving him as many assessing looks as Hermione was glowers. Vindictively happy about this, Draco basked in the attention of Pansy and Hermione, and Charlie who was sitting directly opposite, and he was very glad to note that Pansy and Hermione seemed to get on very well.
Draco had no idea who James was, but he saw a look of pain pass across the faces of Remus, Sirius and Harry. Sirius went pale, and Remus grabbed his hand that was holding a spoon. Harry dropped the piece of paratha that was loaded with dahl that was halfway to his mouth, his lips tightening and drawing down in what looked like misery.
Hogwarts was a sprawling complex of buildings. The main castle housed the assembly hall, the main reception, the headmaster’s office, various admin offices and some seminar rooms and a lecture theatre. He has his French classes in the seminar rooms, as they were smaller and so used for the much smaller class-sizes for the humanity subjects at A-Level. Sciences and maths and DT all had their own buildings.
“Draco, are you crying? Are you okay?” Harry asked, looking down at Draco, who had never felt more embarrassed.
“you’re gay?” Draco squeaked again; voice embarrassingly high. He felt as if his world had turned on its head.
“Hey Malfoy, Ron is coming out of the hospital wing tomorrow, and I was hoping you would be okay with us having a little welcome back party in here? It would just be the two of us, Luna and ‘mione, Ron, Dean, Seamus and Neville”
“I’m secretly hoping that each time is bad enough to make him give up drinking yet somehow it never is” mused Pansy.
“Yea. I stayed with him when I was at his house during the holidays. We always sleep back-to-back, not touching, but his snoring is enough to convince me I’m not about to wake up in a cupboard. I'll probably want to sleep with him tonight, as you’re not an option. Is that okay with you?” Harry asked.
He was forcefully reminded that back at Hogwarts, outside of this welsh paradise he had stumbled upon, Potter was the Golden Boy and Draco was the Death Eater and they couldn’t just be two young boys exploring their feelings together, they had to be diametrically opposed to each other always. The thought was enough to drag him deep into his post-war depression, and the minute the portkey landed them back in the eighth year common room, Draco ran up the stairs and locked himself in his room.
Draco hesitantly climbed back onto the bed next to Harry, who immediately flopped back so he was lying horizontal across the bed, his legs hanging off the edge. Unsure of what to do, Draco dithered there before a hand reached up and pulled him back by the shoulder, until he was lying next to Harry.
“Then let me handle this” Luna said, clambering into Harry’s lap, sitting side-saddle. His arms instinctively wrapped around her. The scent of lemons wrapped around him, and he went to lean his head against her chest, feeling tense now that her body blocked his view of Cedric.
Draco nodded, before slowly clambering onto his bed and reaching for his laptop, which was on the floor.
His little mental mind-map of the people around him was growing steadily. He felt as if he were surrounded by a mystery, and he was desperate to solve it, both for personal satisfaction but also because he thought that understanding of the little world around him would come hand in hand with his full acceptance into the people around him, who all seemed to know and love each other so richly.
“I don’t know what to say. I'm not good at being a boyfriend, I don’t know how to do it. All of what I want, or think I want, feels disingenuous, or heteronormative”
“I’m off home then. See you lads soon , I'm sure.” Ron said when the food had been finished. He stood from the table and hugged Harry, Sirius and Remus in turn. “Nice t’meet you, Draco. I’m sure you’ll see a lot of me this summer” he said to Draco, who was shocked to be so directly addressed. He felt almost as if he had sunken into the wallpaper most of the time.
“I’m not asking you to go somewhere else, I’m asking that you warn me first” says Harry, hoping to come across as diplomatic. It doesn’t work. Draco is filled with anger, even though he doesn’t know where it comes from, and he directs it at Harry.
He stayed, shivering in the cold with Ron until the last two mourners left the graveside- Petunia and Dudley. Once all that was left was a mound of fresh tilled earth, Harry and Ron went over, and stood, looking down to where Vernon rested.
“Oh, Harry! I found this delightful little Italian place, we must do lunch there” Peterson effuses, turning his whole body towards Harry and away from me. Harry, ever the idiot doesn’t even notice the slight. Somehow, despite everything, he still manages to see the good in people.
Their conversation was cut short when there was a strong knock at the door, and Draco opened it to see Harry there.
“Merlin save me” muttered Parkinson. “don’t bring that thing anywhere near me Potter or I swear to god”
“Oh, Draco. Ron likes you, you know? He just feels a lot of loyalty to Harry so he doesn’t talk to you much. You would really know if he didn’t like you. I’ll talk to him about talking Harry round” she said, patting his arm in a distinctly motherly way, despite the fact that she had been leaning on him for support just a few minutes ago.
What’s worse, is they were about to increase in number. Draco sat next to Theo in assembly on the first day of year twelve, dreading the year ahead and the upcoming announcement even more. Their wizened old Headmaster stood at the centre of the raised stage in the Main Hall, named after one of the school’s more illustrious alumni, some poet or something. He had been droning on all morning, and Draco was able to tune it out, until the fateful words were spoken:
“Gin, I’m sorry, you know I love you like a sister, but not like that. Won't you let it rest? Has it not been too long?” Harry said, his gruff voice pleading.
Soon enough, it was 5:30 and the ball was in an hour and a half, and they started to get ready. Hermione went into the bathroom to change first, whilst Harry and Ron got into their suits. They had known Luna long enough that being in their pants in front of her wasn’t an issue.
