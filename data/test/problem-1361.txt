Draco cleared his throat again, realising he just missed what Regulus said in reply. "Pardon me, what was that?"
Draco took a steadying breath as he leaned back to allow Bones and his very own cousin, Regulus Black, to talk.
Out here, he could almost pretend he was little again. Sneaking out with his starter broom to practise flying. Hiding his governess' reading glasses in the shrubs. Chasing the peacocks into them to watch his parents argue which were more important: the peacocks or gardens. That last one stopped working when he was nine.
Draco suppressed a wince, feeling his father's eyes on him from down the table. He made sure to lower his voice under the pretence of blowing politely on his next spoonful of soup. "I've tried to keep up, but there's only so much my head can hold these days."
"Sorcerian Longbottom," Bones answered proudly.
Those kinds of pointed comments stopped stinging years ago.
Draco clenched his jaw and said nothing.
It was the first week of October, and the gala season was in full swing. Draco privately called it battle season. This year especially was going to be difficult to navigate if because nothing else, Draco hadn't cast a single vote in either the Royal or Sorcery Courts. It was true that he and Belby wouldn't have made the progress they had with their invention if Draco participated more in other things, but considering
Accepting Nott's very PR answer, Draco decided to move things along. "I take it, then, that I am not needed? If the Court seems that sure of a decision."
"Oh, fine, if you insist. It's nice to see you again, Drace."
"And he was right. Those were declined, but these are the exact same, just renamed and rebranded to sound less malicious and more helpful to both the inflicted and the nation."
And promptly after killing Belby, Draco was going to kill himself. "
It was always the same.
"So, something of Sorcerian Belby's creative imagination might actually work?" Regulus asked, doubt clear in his tone.
Regulus raised an eyebrow. "What would you call it?"
"Not so much," Draco said smoothly. "I do enjoy the work."
"... Ah." Draco was a bit thrown off but both the news and Regulus' bluntness.
"I see." Nott raised an eyebrow. Draco could tell, though, that he was not surprised. "Pity."
Draco wrote in his journal,
He had successfully been distracting himself for seven months now with his work with Belby. They had made some great strides, and for the first time since starting the project, Draco was beginning to realise that they stood a real chance at creating something that could change lycanthropy as the world knew it. It was literally ground-breaking, and it terrified him.
His lab was his favourite place. He had an academic lab at a university, financed by said university where he sometimes taught or lectured. There was his work lab, one he mostly shared with Sorcerian Master Snape, which was significantly better stocked and the envy of most Masters, and then there was his personal one at home.
"Which is stirring further unrest in the Royal Court. As you know, Sorcerians do not need court approval to perform any kind of magic, as is their blood right. The Muggles feel it is a mistake to allow any kind of magic to go unsanctioned and unmonitored any longer, and the idea that a Sorcerian can create mind-potions in secret is…"
"Have continued to go unrecognised and underutilised by the Muggles for centuries," Snape sneered.
As it stood, it appeared more like Draco burying his head in the sand. He was grateful no one had yet accused him of it outright as it would be rather difficult to defend, all things considered.
Nott narrowed his eyes. "Perhaps, but you are always wanted. Last year, you barely cast your three allotted votes."
Draco could honestly say he didn't agree with most of the values or beliefs he grew up in, nor did he agree with Slytherin politics. In fact, most of his opinions sided more often than not with
He relaxed back against the sofa, having only just arrived long enough to shrug off his coat. A tray of tea promptly popped itself into existence for both the gentlemen, and Draco took a long pull of his while Nott merely sat his aside.
As political tensions kept rising, and more and more people were going missing or straight-out being killed, as protests in other countries were being met with brute and fatal force, and rights of citizens and immigrants alike kept being systematically stripped away, Draco's silence and neutrality were beginning to become a problem for both sides. After all, he was Sorcerian Draco Malfoy, the sole heir to the Malfoy bloodline. He could go to a party for five minutes and end up in all the papers, particularly in the society pages. Any speech he gave, which were mostly academic speeches and lectures, ended up on the front page. As an elite Socrcerian, he was, for all intents and purposes, as close to actual royalty a magician could get without actually being a
"Well, this has been a lovely visit," he said with a smile, setting his empty cup on the table and standing. "As I had warned, I can't stay for long. I'm afraid I must be off."
"But you admit that it is possible? That this kind of magic is possible, and magicians are capable of it?"
Draco, both on and off the record, was un-declared. His father called that a cop-out, but it suited Draco. Perhaps most of his circle considered him a coward. Better a coward, however, than a soft, poofy cat-paw, or worse, a blood-traitor.
It was worse than usual, however, because that woman was the first of many to attempt to bring up the issue in one way or another. It was infuriating. Draco kept up to date with current events as best he could, but he was clearly missing something. It made him uneasy, and he itched to bury his head deeper in his metaphorical sand.
Draco stood studying his new installation of iceboxes for about five minutes before he realised he was distracting himself from his original distraction.
"Thanks, Wadpey. If you could do me a favour and just kill me, that would be great."
"How is old Sorcerian Crouch?"
"Gas-lights, they're calling them. I've heard mention of them. A request came through the office, asking for the removal of lighting spells on several streets to test them. I suppose the proposal succeeded."
"I… first was intrigued by the challenge, but we have made a great deal of progress."
Luckily, Bones immediately picked up on that change of subject, and Draco happily followed along. He didn't miss, however, Snape's cold glare or Regulus' calculating one.
Both Snape and Regulus snorted.
Loathe him to actually say it out loud, however.
"I believe you've been working with Sorcerian Master Belby," Snape added with a raised eyebrow.
"It is, which can be significantly more time-consuming."
"What has been the atmosphere in the courts lately?"
'" Draco squeaked then dropped his voice to a low hiss.
"I said Regs is fine. It's just you and me…
His closest guarded secret was just how non-Dark his own was.
This was true, but Draco felt like he could soothe some of his guilt over his lack of participation because he had just genuinely forgotten about his last vote.
"I can understand that. I imagine it keeps you quite busy. This is why we haven't seen you in the courts this year?"
No, Sorcerian Draco Malfoy did not believe in whatever conspiracy was currently being spread, and it worried him because paranoia could lead to unwarranted unrest or worse. "We are in interesting times, and as such, I believe it is best to keep a sound mind and a critical eye."
the project was, Draco was hesitant of the reaction.
When he was young, it all seemed so simple. There were people who were magicians, which made them better than other people, and there were people who were magical through pure, family blood, and they were the best. Therefore, it was odd when Draco embarked into the world only to learn that actually, not many people agreed with that assessment. And then he began to meet people, non-pure-blood magicians, Muggles even, and he couldn't quite understand why he would ever believe himself superior. It had him questioning so many other values he was raised to believe, facts that turned out to be ignorant and unjust opinions, and practises that with new eyes were just cruel.
"Apparently," Regulus reverted lowly.
"Altogether, yes, I suppose. But the Sorcery Court has also heard rumours that it may be feasible for a potion to allow a lycanthropian to keep their mind during the full moon."
Sorcerian Draco Malfoy continued to give his apologies, but, with a charming chuckle, "I don't discuss my private life; besides, there are so many more things worthwhile to speak of tonight than whom I may or may not be dating."
Draco tried his best not to look surprised. "Again, some issues incite passionate reactions, but I have yet to see any issue that couldn't be ruled on amicably."
"Sorcerian Belby has had many successes over the years," Bones contributed. Her salad was being replaced with the main course, and Draco quickly shoved a few bites of his own in his mouth before laying his fork across his plate to signal he was finished. His plate, too, was replaced.
He stepped up on a stone bench to squint in the distance where the conservatory was just visible. Inside them held more precious memories, such as his mother teaching him the beginnings of herbology, his father giving him his first lecture of superior genes via magical versus mundane plants, and Sorcerian Master Snape giving him potion lessons. Inside was a perfectly innocuous pond that, in actuality, was an illegal concourse into a magical lake full of all kinds of magical creatures and aquatic plants.
Judicial claim to equality?!"
It usually wasn't that difficult to find something, and sure enough, it took only a few days to run across an old letter from Sorcerian Master Damocles Belby, writing for Draco's opinion on an idea of his. The idea was intriguing, the academic and practical challenge of it enticing, and something that was sure to take up a lot of his time.
Draco always had to clear his head before that part. Reaffirm himself and what he was going to say.
"Nonsense. Draco, you lecture at Muggle universities, yes?"
"I was looking for you, actually."
Draco let himself smile. "Dray is not fine, if you please. If we must be familiar with each other, my old nickname will suffice."
Draco's soup had been replaced with a small salad, and he was enjoying chasing a walnut around his plate. Now, he laid his fork down and put on his best appeasing expression. "I do, but I'm afraid as a guest lecturer, I am limited to how potions and Muggle chemistry coincide."
If he had the mind to, he could play a critical role in having the harbouring of Muggle refugees by magicians, the Goldsteins' crime, illegal and punishable to the greatest extent in both courts.
None of them seem right anymore...
Kreacher said it reminded him of muggle hunting but more difficult.
“Aww i’m sorry Harry i guess no mail tod...HEY who are you?” Dean said to the man that appeared out of nowhere.
“Oh dear merlin Miss Granger where did you learn that?” Severus asked before he stopped talking and just rolled with it.
“Ok” he said getting up to walk out
Harry Potter ,
“Here Harry it’s pretty clean now.” she said as Harry grabbed it
Draco
“Well that depends Neville are you a good boy or a bad boy?” she asked running her fingers down his arm
“Miss Granger...detention...tonight.” he said
Neville switched sides of the table and wrapped his arms around Harry.
“What in the bloody hell is going on here?” he said
Ginny wrapped him in a hug from the other side...seeing what they were doing Castiel got up and wrapped him in a hug from behind.
YOU BLOODY BASTARD WHY IN MERLINS NAME WOULD YOU HELP HARRY DO STUPID THINGS.
One week later…..
“Kreacher be in back yard Missy.” the old elf said walking out
And Rolonda...really?? OMG send details...i need details
“No I won't, he's hanging around with hot , fit demon hunters .” harry said with his head on the table
“But ..” he said
He was driving everyone insane .
“Yes Miss.” he said
He nodded and started to walk away when she said “Good Boy”
“You lost a person?” Bobby asked
The lawyer says he’s got it almost fix my dear darling future sprog maker.
“Hermione what was that?” Ron asked
No matter what you will always be my first real love.
Where he was trying to feed the bird icing from a cupcake.
“Where the hell are the angels…?” he asked
Castiel smiled around his cupcake.
Well i see you...the real Harry.
“Come on Harry , Ron we have class” she said walking out of the great hall.  They both got up and followed her but so did the flamingo.
I’m leaving from here today..
Which i'm currently writing.
“Dismissed Severus.” she said
Your Loving Godson,
So be prepared.
Although a lovely park ranger did ask me out for drinks.
“Hermione, can i feed this bird?? He eats like me” ron asked
FYI i’m not allowed back in Louisiana ,  don’t ask!!
Oh so very soft and comfortable.
Calm down and leave it alone.
Sleepily Yours,
“Please help yourself to whatever you want to eat or drink.” Harry said to the bird.
“Yes Miss” ron replied
“HARRY” hermione yelled
(Yes if the pizza man loves the babysitter why does he strike her?-castiel)
No clue where i'm going with this one.
And stop feeding them junk food.” she said
“Ron we have to go...ron leave the bird alone” hermione said
“Wonderful Idea Harry.  We’ll let you know when it’s time to come eat.” hermione said
Sadly the reindeer here do not fly...very disappointing.
“Hermione does Ron still have the flamingo?” harry asked
“Ahhh now i see it….So Harry what are you doing after breakfast?” she asked already knowing the answer
My suggestion: hire a nanny and a curse breaker.
Points for effort darling….
He said they are making progress and should hopefully have more news soon.
“I am so busy people just have no clue…” she said feeding Severus
I’m just laying here in the room naked eating tacos and donuts and smoking marajawana.
“I’m still banished Dean...my lawyer says he’s close to being done but it’s still not completely worked out yet.  I can’t risk it, I'd lose everything.  I have my future sprogs to think of.  As well as my mother.” Draco said
Oh there it is….what’s C4 i wonder….” he said
Love you bye mwah
Because I've run out of Taco Bell and Crispy Cream so i have to make a munchies run.
He’d even been trying to listen to Hermione better when she told him to eat  or to get some rest.
“It’s from Draco.” he said smiling
‘Well beings…” Sam hedged
Letter 3
/COUGH/
(But why didn’t i know-harry)
Harry took the letter back and decided to put it away for safekeeping.
All scowly , dark , broody and hot….wait hot
“That’s so sad that you can’t cuddle demon birdy” he said
“Now Harry, that was rude...apologize to the nice demon.” Hermione scolded him
“I helps Dobby and Mister Ron.” she said happily
“No but we’ll work with it and see.” Sam said
Pulling pigtails i believe some would say.
“Umm Cas can we go?” he asked
Get stoned and humped like demented bunnies for days.
Harry looks over at Hermione and she’s sitting there with her arms crossed.
Thanks so much Hermione for the chocolate.  The American kind just isn’t the same somehow.
Otherwise why would you be so interested in getting me back.
“Not the time Draco...Not the time.” Sam said
Hermione came over and Harry handed her the letter.
…-Tapping-....
But man eating wildlife and underground volcanoes just don’t do it for me.
Happy Halloween....
Hermione,
“Oh thank god get in here Draco.” Sam said as he opened the door
Also it snaps sometimes…
“Oh that’s a nice change we only have 1 demon so far.” Neville said, turning back to his plate.
“Castiel Ron likes to feed the post birds that Draco sends...since Draco sent you this time he’s going to be determined to feed you. Just humor him there's a good boy.” hermione said patting Castiel's hand
Ron reached over and took the letter off and handed it to Hermione so she could clean the eggs off of it.
(Eventually yes….after all you’ll need to impregnate Draco-Hermione)
“Winky why do you have an ax?” hermione asked
Heckle and Jeckle are supposed to be taking care of you.
He’s probably in a more muggel area with no owl post available.” hermione said
I’m going now darling…..you handsome sexy beast of a wizard you.
Such as it is….
“But angels have wings right?” ron asked
“Yes Gabriel?” she asked
Oh and I heard from my lawyer .
Hermione please take care of him...you know he’s hopeless at doing it himself.
Two more weeks go by and Hogwarts is officially starting back.
“Yeah i’m fine” he said
And I didn’t see the great Harry Potter.
“It’s from Draco” the angel replied handing him the letter
“Oh Gabriel “ minerva said laughing as she ran
“Yes Neville?” she said
I CAN NOT BELIEVE YOU WOULD GO TO MY LAWYER BEHIND MY BACK….
Severus found himself being pinned to the wall by hermione.
“It’s alright to like the jumper.  We all need something darling.  There’s a good little lamb.” Hermione said cuddling him and rocking him gently
“Um Hermione” neville asked
But I want black furniture with a gothic feel….i’m thinking round cribs.
Draco,
Somewhere in the central United States
Someone sees you and I have for years.
Hello My Darling Prince Of Chaos ,
So now i have a smartphone and an iPad.
“WHAT?” Meg said
Tears streaming down his face.
“Now Castiel dear, I have special detention with Severus after breakfast.  You can come with me and I'll explain the pizza man and the babysitter.Ok?” she asked
I managed to stop Ron from making any explosives although he’s still pouting a bit about it.
“Well see it's all because of the post bird strike.” Sam started
Omg this place is mental she thought
“Ok” ron said
He has to give them back Dean is very upset….he hates flying but he’s talking about coming to Scotland to get Castiel back.
“Winky , Dobby, come on, I know this book in the library Hermione said don’t touch it .  So it should have something in it to help get that thing down.   It’s a cookbook of potions .   It’s called the anarchists cookbook.
“Now Harry be nice Severus is feeling a bit vulnerable today and needs extra cuddles. Isn’t that right precious?” hermione says
Seriously what the hell…
“He’s right it’s totally Ron’s fault” Sam added
Castiel is finding himself
“I’m feeling a bit tired i thought i’d take a nap...Draco got me a blanket.” he said
“Oh god lord Ron really?” hermione sighed
Safe Travels
(Was someone going to tell me? - harry)
Florida is odd...Did you know this Disneyland place is being run by house elves?
As for the house elves….they have unique abilities to find whatever
I would tell you where I'm currently at but there are no signs anywhere.
“We do need to get Cas back though...Deans getting a bit crazy .” Sam said quietly
But we had a chat and one of them was kind of flirty.
So i acted out...it was all just me trying to get you to pay attention to me.
I also found myself this lovely pair of pj’s ….so very soft and completely see thru.
“Sorry nice Demon …..i’m a bit stressed these days.” Harry said clutching the letter and package tightly in his hands
“Is that a brown booby bird?” Hermione asked
He made a stressed noise and stormed out .
I did have something odd happen.
Ron can feed this bird….
“Well yes” she said
Thankfully the letters were coming pretty regular these days.
OMG i can’t stand the sight of Taco Bell right now…
“Harry are you ok?” hermione asked
It reminded me of you. It was the same color as your eyes.
“Ok well we can wait a week.” Sam said
Have a lovely day !
I hope you all have a good year at Hogwarts.
“Well then you absolutely need detention.” she said patting his hand
“Heya Harry, don't be upset, Malfoys always been obsessed with you. I doubt he’s going to give up now that he’s got you.” seamus said
(Hush Harry - hermione)
Hopefully i will be updating everything i am currently working within in the next few days.
Another letter from Malfoy.
He looked up and saw a large pink bird flying towards their table.
I DON”T KNOW WHAT’S GOTTEN INTO YOU RECENTLY BUT IT WILL STOP…
“Uh huh…..well ok just be careful.” she said
(that’s forever you asshole)
And the other landed in front of Harry
(Oh Dracos already work it all out don’t worry-hermione)
So long story short i’m leaving Texas.
Yeah i have no excuse for this chapter....
“Harry what’s wrong?” hermione asked kneeling in front of him
Hermione looked at him really looked
“Here birdy..” ron called
They did try and take all of our assets but I have a very good lawyer.
“I’ll be good.” Harry said quietly
Oh yeah mail …
My lawyer told him that if we couldn’t work it out for me to come back and still keep my assets you may be moving away.
“Mr Longbottom….Miss Parkinson detention….don’t be late.  Punishments are severe for tardiness.” he said
Now it doesn’t sound crazy until you hear that they hunt monsters , demons and angels darling.
Then Ron removed the plate and bird from Harry's place at the table.
Hermione seriously where  are the angels?? Do you know i got a letter about the flamingo...yeah still hasn’t been returned darling..
Oh we should bring Hermione, my Uncle and Ron with us when we come here for our honeymoon.
…..----POOF--......
“Well apparently Ron has adopted them.  I received a letter from Hermione that Castiel is on vacation.  Something about finding himself.
I’m very upset darling!!
Anyway I decided to go to Seattle and wander around that area.
The Next Day…..
Admitting my feelings was supposed to make me feel better.
So we should definitely get a dog.
I’m sure you’ll notice Potter there’s no heading on this letter.
My Lovely Little Trouble Magnet ,
Hermione chuckled
Everyone watched the two large birds fly in only one dropped a howler in front of Professor Snape.
(Hermione Dracos talking about babies-harry)
“Crowley why are you here?” Castiel asked
And dobby is helping Harry and Kreacher build some sort of trap in the back yard to catch post birds.
HARRY JAMES POTTER HAVE YOU LOST WHAT LITTLE MIND YOU HAD LEFT!??
Castiel however was so lovely and said he’d bring it to you darling isn’t that sweet.
Well he did use to be the Malfoys house elf i suppose it makes sense she thought.
hugs….MWAH
“Severus, would you like a riding crop...or nipple clamps?? Hermione asked
Trust me if i get to come back there you’ll want to be well rested.
Hermione turned and saw Ron holding up a muffin for the bird.
I also found some new underwear they’re called ‘manties’ basically panties for men.
But Hermione and Severus didn’t hear any of it.
Yours ,
Also Ron needs to leave the birds alone...
“Well not necessarily...i could arrange for a port key.” Draco said
Harry did finally come in from outside , he’s fine no damage done from sitting in the rain with Kreacher.
“This place is cursed….I blame Albus...mad old fool jinxed the whole place.” Minerva said tossing the whiskey back in one go
A donkey!! Ride on a bloody donkey….they smelled horrible i just couldn’t do it.
All to get your attention.
(Draco will explain it when you need to know dear-hermione)
The old grumpy elf seems oddly devoted to him now.
“Dear Merlin i hope so…”Severus said smiling
“Dobby why are you here with that?” she asked
Dean looked up suddenly
“Yes soon….I think i need one more week.” Castiel said
And then the mail came.
Their names are Sam and Dean.
I know you’re with young weaselette and don’t feel anything for me.
They didn’t have detention today but they were still hoping for some quality time with Miss.
Also be careful giving the bird rich foods. I found out the hard way it doesn’t end well...
“Harry be honest if you knew where he was right now what would you do?  Come on honest truth” hermione asked
Draco decides to share his real reason for being a git all those years.
“Oh good grief...He’s fine !! And apparently already well trained.”she said shaking her head
So I am going to share something with you that i’ve never shared with anyone.
I’d ask Ron but let’s be honest he’s hopeless as well.
“What do we do with the birds?” Neville asked as the other one landed on the table in front of him hissing
(Harry stop that you’re upsetting the new demon - Hermione)
Harry reached out and took it off.
“Yes Miss” ron said
I hope you are behaving...thankfully I haven't heard anything to say otherwise.
MWAH!!!
“That’s scarier than Professor Snape smiling.” another Ravenclaw replied
I was informed that it was normal and it happened.
She reached up, grabbed him by the collar and dragged his mouth down to hers.
Hermione sat down to write Draco a letter just as Ron was walking through the kitchen.
Anyway i must dash my darling
I have no clue where i am ...none.
Lavender screamed as a woman appeared out of nowhere.
“Ron don’t make the bird sick remember what happened when the owl sobered up” hermione said flipping pages
“Here birdy have a cupcake...oh and some pancakes...i’ll fix you a plate” ron said
I can talk for a long. I have to go get Harry in from the rain.
Everyone go take a nap!
Hasn’t said a word about Ron trying to get rid of that horrid painting .
Hermione keeps preaching patience to him.
“I miss that stupid git so much….I’m in my prime baby years Sam. But where am I in another country while the father of my future children is on the other side of the Ocean. How the hell am I supposed to get knocked up like this??” Draco cried
They’re very sensitive darling…
Cause yeah insomnia LMAO
I need to hump like demented bunnies with you here..
Ron stop feeding the birds muffins..
“Yes I know.  He says he needs another week. He’s working some things out. “ Draco said
Hermione glanced up
“Yes Miss….” ron , ginny and Castiel all said at once
Harry opened the letter slowly and almost passed out seeing who it was from.
“You think he’ll keep writing?” Harry asked
(Yes!! - hermione )
Seriously huge webs everywhere…
Draco is horny
Why the hell did you break up with Ron's sister?
Draco sniffed “He’s only half hell hound ...thank you very much.” he said
With Bondage....
“Well he’s right you are helpless.  I am only one person. I can only do so much.” she said acting put out
So Far…
DO YOU HEAR ME GRANGER!!
Then the mail started to come in…
“He says he needs to take care of me because you're useless but he can’t come back.  Not until he’s 28 Hermione.  I have to fix it” Harry said
“Did you ask for Potter?” Hermione asked
Just a quick note i just posted a chapter for the spin off of the story
“Dracos lawyer's name is Findrakes In Diagon Alley.” Snape called out from the head table
Well i’m going to go now .
Dearest Idiot Who For Some Reason I Love ,
(Harry makes a strange mewling noise...freaks out the table)
But I need to move on and I can't do that until I clear my heart of this.
“Ummm Hermione, he may not need help but I do. My bird won’t give me the letter and it just tried to bite me.” harry said leaning away from the bird
FYI darling he’s a cranky demon.
“Hermione why is Professor Snape sitting at our table and why is he nuzzling you?” harry asked confused
Draco nodded “As much as i love and adore Harry he’s not really the planning ahead type.  He’s more the run headlong into a burning building without thinking type. And then somehow magically managing to survive against all odds.” Draco said sighing and getting misty eyed
“Oh god lord Ron he’s not a post bird” hermione said
That day, the last day i saw you at the Ministry i wanted to run up to you and wrap my arms around you.
Did you know that Yellowstone is just a giant fucking volcano underground??
What it’s like to be a muggle….what it’s like to fight evil monsters...ya know as opposed to evil dark wizards.
Dear Scarface
Anyway he asked me if I wanted to see inside his van.
He just handed her the letter.
On another note completely , i would love to have you stuff something in my trunk...wink wink
Hermione is very much in charge
“I believe Mistress I would prefer the riding crop.  Rolonda would prefer it as well.” He said
“Why are you going out into the yard Kreacher it’s raining?” she asked
“Have a nice rest in your Draco blanket dear” Hermione called as he left the hall
“8pm and Rolonda don’t be late.  Wouldn’t want to make Mistress cranky now would we?” hermione said smiling
In regards to the end of chapter 9.
“No thank you, I'm trying to stay healthy for my future sprogs.  Booze is bad for babies.” Draco informed him patting his stomach
Love you my big growly pumpkin!!
Granger, are you sure you want to do this??
Be nice to the bird he’s sensitive about his beak….Please don’t let Ron feed it a bunch of crap dear.
Well this is a short letter since i need to leave the death zone.
Love you BYE….hugs!
“Dear Merlin” hermione said to herself
Well that’s a pain in the ass.
Don’t bother to write back by the time you receive this. I'll be gone .
“Hunters….monsters….angels….post bird strike….BLOODY HELL RON THE POST BIRDS ARE ON STRIKE BECAUSE OF YOU…..angels doing porn...really?? ….wow….what is kielbasa?” hermione muttered
“Yes Missy...Master Harry said he will stay till he catches the bird from Master Draco.” kreacher informed her before turning to walk out
On another note in the enclosed package you’ll find potion ingredients from the southern states in America.
“Harry what are you reading?” Hermione asked
I'm going to start posting again on Monday.
“Oh, we also seem to have misplaced a Flamingo.” Draco added
I hope everything is going well there darling.
“Oh pelican .” hermione said barely glancing up
He smiled and ran out of the kitchen
Then when I get back to a magical area your face is on the cover of several papers where they’re questioning your sanity.
Just for fun...LOL
I had a very handsome cowboy ask me out to dinner.
It’s not like they had a lot of experience just chatting.
They all walked along to the Headmistresses office with the twins humming ‘we’re off to see the wizard’
Hope everything is going well….I’m not calling you Mistress .
As for the Grand Canyon...a magical void darling
Good Bye My Love
“Cas , Gabriel , Crowley and maybe Meg.” Sam said quietly
She watched  as Ron wandered after the bird offering it cookies and a tart.
“Minerva is that firewhiskey? At breakfast?” Pomona asked
Neville smiled “Oh yeah she’s fine that’s Hermiones working out a problem look. I think she’s about to fix everything again. “ He said
“What kind of birds are those?” Neville asked pointing up
He popped over to her and nuzzled into her arms
Drcao has a bit of trouble doing an errand for Hermione
My Dearest Darling Hunter Of Dark Evils ,
She’d go tell Ron the news.
The man in question glanced in the directions she waved her hand in.
“What Harry?” she asked
And ofcourse look after the king of my heart.
“Look how calm and relaxed Severus is these days.” she said
“Severus is there something you need to tell me?” Minerva asked
(See the end of the chapter for
But I explained I was affianced and he took it well.
I thought he was going to cry when I told him I was affianced.
Hermione had just finished when she felt the explosion….
Severus was walking out of the great hall when Hermione stopped him.
You are so frustrating !!
“So Draco, any idea what's going on ?” Sam asked
“Does she do this alot? Ya know, fix everything for everyone?” Pansy asked
The floo activated
“Oh alright this is what happened…” He said
But the food is good and the room hasn’t tried to kill me so hey win!!
“I mean...maybe” harry said pouting
“Umm Hermione there’s a word i don’t understand..what does that mean?” Harry asked pointing to the word ‘Affianced’
I talked to your mum….she’s started planning your bonding to Harry.
“Good Boy ron “ hermione said
One Week Later….
If you’d like to come back and help I'd be thrilled to have an extra pair of hands around.
I will never come to Australia again...did you know they have something called spider season.
“Hermione why is the angel still here? I thought Ron had to give him back? To that Dean person.” Harry asked, glancing over to where Castiel was eating and talking in low tones with Ginny and Ron.
Well except perhaps pity.
“Don’t worry Harry , Draco will explain it to you eventually.” she said smiling
What did the Blacks get up too?
Probably for the best you have class work anyway darling.
Harry was laughing.
“Which one of you useless meat bags is Potter?” Asked a strange dark haired woman
I am currently in Colorado….I love this place Harry.
I talked to my lawyer...and he’s had a word with the Minister.
(Why does Drcao think you need somewhere to have Ron flogged?- harry)
“Blimey….definitely for you Harry..” Seamus said
I had to leave Colorado darling to much of a good thing and all that.
“Can i see Draco's letter please..i’m sure there’s a message for me.” she said
So that i don't get overwhelmed again.
And if that wasn’t enough Ron still has the flamingo.   They are talking about legal action darling.
“Ok” harry said smiling
“Oh of course it is lovey. I’m here for you.” hermione said
Minerva is day drinking
“I think Draco might be in Australia this time.” Hermione said
EVERYONE CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION… HARRY POTTER IS OFF LIMITS. DON’T MAKE ME TAKE A WHIP TO YOU.
“Oh let’s see one angel goes missing after delivering a letter so they send the other angel to find him and that angel goes missing.
Dean is threatening to come to Scotland and retrieve his angel.
Harry my love we have a problem Dean is going a bit mental what with Castiel's absence.
Darling I have to end the letter now…
“Do you need help with the bird Professor?” Hermione called up to the head table
“Good Lord Ronald  Weasely stop feeding the post birds pure sugar.  We’re lucky we haven't gotten a howler about it yet.” Minerva said stalking out of the hall
Dear Uncle ,
“Oh posts here.” someone yelled
I realized when I started writing that we’ve never had what one would call normal correspondence.
“Castiel...my name is Castiel” he said
(Harry stop making that high pitched whining noise you’re upsetting the owls.-hermione)
“So what do we do?” Sam asked
“Ok” he said sounding confused
I’ve been thinking alot about what my lawyer told me you said when you went to his office.
(Harry Stop hitting your head on the table- hermione)
Draco could see Dean pacing running his hands through his hair.
In truth though she was so very glad he wrote again.
Ron was following Hermione
“Please Miss, can i have detention?” she asked
The package is for Hermione; it's the weed infused lube.
But i didn’t feel like getting hexed.
“Trap for post birds in backyard.” dobby said smiling as he walked out
I am visiting Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon.
my works.
“I’m sure Ron will be happy you visited.” Hermione said laughing
“I’m Gabriel cutie.” he said winking
(Harry are you alright?-Neville)
I can almost hear you now Saint Potter
Santa's village feel and all.
(Harry what’s wrong? - Hermione)
“Yes Severus?” she responded
“Would you like a cookie demon birdy?” Ron asked
She glanced at Ron to see him trying to clean eggs and jam off the bird's feet.
“Why are you happy about that?” ron asked
/Hermione reached over and snatched the package/
They are missing,
There was a large owl flying across the room but it wasn’t going in a straight line it was kind of wobbly.
And for some reason the werewolves all run around shirtless.
I would ofcourse kiss it better after I punched you but still...
I Love you soooo very much my darling harry
I am going more into it in the next chapter.
Merlin i wish you had been here to deal with it…
“Huh a void how interesting….” she said
You’re going to love him!!
Must dash my darling we’re hunting vampires today...such fun.
(Pizza man?-hermione)
“Miss can we?” Cas asked Hermione quietly
“I’m so confused.” she said
(Harry stop growling you’re upsetting Rons angel-Hermione)
I don’t have to fear rejection cause I won't be around.
I don’t care what you say .
They all watched them walk out…
He may let him keep Gabriel...Send word back with Crowley.
“Oh alright Ron go ahead...but if he vomits on you i don’t want to hear one word...got it?” she said
You’ll get used to the red eyes and fire breath...
Granger ,
After all pretty girls rarely paid attention to the potion master he wasn’t going to turn down a chance like this.
Kreacher was feeding and watering the bird.
“Are you Potter?” Crowley asked
Did you know some scorpions are magic resistant?
That’s all…--taps throat--” hermione said
“Alright that’s all...as you were.” She said walking towards the main doors
“Severus we need to go to Colorado after graduation...Draco found somewhere for me to have you and Ron publicly flogged.” hermione called up to the head table
The table sighed in relief
“I’m Harry” he said
“Demon honey. Names Meg.” She said smirking
It’s nothing overly exciting. It's a koala bear blanket but it is so very soft.
And in the other he saw Castiel sitting between two redheads chatting and eating cookies and pie.
I think it’s time we admit Ron has a problem…
“Awww bless….how sweet...oh look at that one ‘my daddy Ak’d the dark lord’ omg so cute “ she said looking through the onesies
Not to mention the fact that he has no common sense
I’m sure Granger & Weasley will be reading this as well so here it goes
But hey what the hell LOL
He didn’t understand why Harry loved the git but he did and he was a good friend.
“Hmmmm yes alright you can have pink.” she said looking back down
My Love , My Life...Future Father Of My Sprogs,
“Cas you don’t go to school here” gabriel said
“Um Harry, I think you have mail.” Neville said
“Oh Hellllo Minnie my love! RAWR'' Gabriel said cuddling closer
Draco Potter nee Malfoy
“Harry’s in the backyard?” she asked
I called down to inform them I didn't ask for a snake.
Poor thing...
Hope everyone likes it.
But the other stuff should be ok.
“Neville dear there’s a good boy.” she said
They're at it again....
Hermione
Hermione patted Crowley on the head and passed him off to Neville and Pansy for cuddles.
“I swear to god it’s like running an asylum and all the inmates are out of their cells.” she ranted
You can’t use magic there…
I took a few days off from writing for a small sanity break LOL
“Yes Pansy…?” hermione asked
“EWWWW” Ron said rushing out of the great hall with what looked like bird barf running down his back and a bird on his head.
I’m staying at a lovely bed and breakfast
Please take care of yourself..
But we were kids and now we’re not.
“Ron what are you doing with those?” she asked
“Yes” Cas replied
“Um heya Harry i think that’s for you” Seamus said pointing up
Sam looked at Draco.
“Oh i’m so glad harry...now give me the letter” she said making grabby hands
Must dash darling….be nice to the stork he’s never been to Scotland before.
Getting out a piece of parchment and ink.
A box was dropped in front of Harry by a large blue-grey bird
Draco
I came a bit too close to a bear while there….it was a pretty area.
“I like it...it’s soft and cozy.  And my mum never made me a jumper.” Crowley said then promptly burst into tears
“Draco mentioned it...but i haven’t seen it yet.  He seemed impressed.” she said
Upside finding lots of baby things….Oh i thought i had found the crib but it turned out to be cursed.
“How did you send Draco chocolate?” harry asked
I hope you and the dynamic duo are all doing well.
(Here Harry let me wipe the jam off your forehead-Neville)
On another note i’m thinking sage green for the nursery...what do you think?
But this really is a two person job.
Harry took the letter from the tern.
Although they keep singing about dwarves.
“Huh.” pansy replied
He just wants him here.
“Hermione what is it?” Ron asked
Between dances, Draco suffered through conversations, giving out congratulations and best wishes where they were due, engaging in sociality gossip of which he was more than passable thanks to his friend Sorcerian Pansy Parkinson (who was always up to date despite living in Egypt), and eventually leisured his way into the gardens.
Draco had to think a moment to know what they were discussing exactly. "Quite. The laws around rare potions ingredients get stricter every year, either by us or the Muggles."
The journalist pressed forward, clearly not willing to let it go, but Draco took the opportunity of a new wave of Muggles coming back through the balcony doors to make his exit.
He took a magician carriage to the gallery. The gallery was at the Royal Academy in London and was the starting location for this gala event, which he was pretty sure was for raising money for higher magician education. Starting locations usually frequented magicians who were not quite elite enough to warrant an invitation to the main event, but were influential and famous enough to be expected. Along with them would be the elite Muggles such as the Prime Minister and the Court Royals, but only a handful of them were ever invited to the main event as well.
He immediately chastised himself for allowing such a nervous-tell to show, having spoken between constant sips. The abolishment, as always, sounded like his father's voice. He had mostly been successful getting that voice out of his head, but at moments like these, when he was forced into the company of the members of the Court, that voice grew stronger. This was another reason to stay away, he had adamantly defended in the past, ignoring suggestions from Sorcerian Master Snape that perhaps exposure would be better.
"Perfect."
There were times Draco couldn't even bring himself to say the name Riddle, but it was better than thinking of him as
"I'm afraid so, sir."
They had gone as far as they could go without actually introducing test subjects. Earlier that day, Draco had sent Belby another long list of other test subjects they could try before progressing to actual werewolves. Lycanthropy was a curse that only affected humans, but there were other curses that inflected other animals that were close enough to begin. Belby knew Draco was dragging his feet, but Draco couldn't help it.
Draco opened his mouth before the realisation of the trap he just stepped in slammed into him. He stood straight and crossed his arms.
, for example, was the construction of literal light; whereas,
Nott abruptly stood and strolled toward his large townhouse windows. They were in London, and from outside Draco could hear the low rumble of the public, a few shouts of merchants, the clomps of horses and whooshes of the carriages they pulled. Draco idly wondered after the sky, it's standard city-grey making it almost impossible to tell if it would rain or not.
"But is it true that Sorcerians are capable of casting mind-magic that can control the court members, even potentially control
"But it's been stalled."
There was very little cause for pretence currently, Draco thought. They both knew exactly why Draco had been invited over, exactly where any conversation would lead, and the reasoning behind all of it. He would really rather just not bother, but as he himself wasn't quite sure how the inevitable conversation would result, he supposed he would just have to trek through it. His top priority was not declaring himself one way or another; not in opinion, not in politics, not in beliefs.
Thus began probably the most sociable part of the evening.
"Oh, the Goldstein case has been in all of them."
"You sound disappointed."
But that was only on the surface. Slytherin was one of the largest, strongest political parties for magicians, named after Salazar Slytherin who helped lead the magicians in the war. The opposing party was Gryffindor, named after the man who ended Slytherin's massacre in Spain and helped forge the treaty with the Muggles after the war. There were rumours those two historical figures had once been friends, even almost opened up some kind of magical boarding school, but to see any party-member converse with another, one wouldn't think so.
was the deconstruction of light. Healing magic, for another example, was the construction from damaged molecules, and curses were generally the deconstruction of healthy molecules.
"Depends on which one," he tried.
"Of course, sir." With a muted
"It isn't. The distance between us only makes it sound as such."
Draco was able to grab and finish a drink before a soft chiming warned everyone the courses were about to begin. Lucius took the head of the table a few chairs down from Draco with Narcissa to his right. The Minister of Magic sat on the other end, looking pompous indeed.
"Without fail," Regulus agreed.
"Sorcerian Malfoy," said Wadpey, one of Draco's house-elves.
Yes, Sorcerian Draco Malfoy fully supported the causes for which this event was, and he was encouraged to see such a diverse turnout. "It's always encouraging to see the continued good relations between our respective worlds."
"We simply need to come to an agreement," Bones countered diplomatically. "If we can show the Prime Minister that suspicions around certain ingredients are unfounded, I'm sure—"
"That's not ominous."
If he had the mind to, with just one vote, could steer the tides toward a storm that could change everything.
"But have you heard of it?"
It worked and had been working for a very long time. Draco just couldn't understand why it seemed to be failing now. Sure, there were people like Nott and his father who were part of the government and directly behind the winds of the climate, but surely, not even they… well, surely, Nott would not wish half of what was resulting.
would happen!” Potter spluttered as he clutched the duvet to his chest, as if Draco hadn’t seen him naked the night before.
“Something stupid that will probably work,” Jessie mumbled as she started the car.
A small ‘Meow’ emitted from the cat before it took off running down the hall, tail swishing angrily.
When Malfoy sat across from him, next to Ron, he wished he could cover his entire face. The table was barely big enough for two people, let alone three. The limited space was smaller than the last time they had seen each other.
“I don’t remember,” whispered Draco, letting the truth slip out instead of the lie that had slid to his lips and halted—tempting to come out.
Draco looked over his shoulder and shot a ricocheting Bombarda down the passage. Shattering glass echoed around them, and it was satisfying.
“Fuck,” Draco swore, eyes closing as the tempo increased. It was hard to focus on anything but Potter. The longer he touched, the more he was
“Who says you get to start?” Lane—the chairman for the Werewolf council—said. “We have already decided.”
“Since when?” Draco was offended Harry had sat on that kind of information.
“Did you just now get done talking to Dots?”
“How big is the inspection vault?”
“Excuse you,” Draco said loudly as he turned the corner, he grinned at the way Ron yelled. When he pushed open the door, his smile melted into a smirk at the way Ron’s hand clutched his chest.
It still burned. The injustice of it all. It wasn’t fair. Harry had seen Sirius’ memories, knew how hard he had worked to be different than his family, how he struggled to gain the respect of those who only saw his family, only saw a Dark Wizard in name but not spirit.
Harry tried to throw them off by taking random turns but ended up hitting an alley.
“His office is on the bottom floor, first left.”
Did Voldemort believe the prophecy was real?
It reminded him of what Potter said about Snape and Moody. His instincts knew there was something there.
It took Harry a moment to tear his eyes away from the way his own eyes in the photo seemed to light up with happiness. When he looked up, he noticed that Draco’s eyes were narrowed in on him with an emotion that he couldn’t quite decipher.
Draco nodded the best he could with the hand still on his face. If Potter wanted him there, who was he to back out?
“Have you fought with her since then?”
An arched brow was the only response for an awkward minute as they stared at each other before he sat at the same table, across from him. Harry got the impression he was being sized up, but he didn’t have enough human interaction to truly know for certain.
“Choice?” He prompted as Potter fell silent and the hand on his wrist disappeared.
each other instead of
“For a price.”
“What’s the difference between the two?” The flipping of a page taunted him, and he really hated the damn thing.
Still, he had missed her. Over his years of painting, he had needed teachers who knew the people he had been hired to paint, and that led to Minerva. He could still remember the first time he went to see her. It had been a few years after the war and she remained tight-lipped, angry and not a joy for conversations. But his work was never about him, only about the people he wished to capture, and she had come around eventually.
“You don’t have to be rude.”
“What happened?” Draco yelled, causing the Fat Lady to look at him in admiration as her glass cup shattered. His mind was cycling through hundreds of theories, but each one was deadlier than the last.
The vague answers weren’t appreciated, and he wished people didn’t feel the need to hide things. Sirius was dead, what good would limited answers do anyone?
“Ron hired me to paint Fred.”
The longer the game passed the more obvious it was that something wasn’t right.
The downfall of many, humanity in general. Growing up, Harry had desired a lot of things, most of it something that
Harry pointed at himself and watched Malfoy shake his head.
“But we did talk about getting tattoos,” Harry reminded, watching the flush return.
Astoria closed her eyes tightly.
Logic.
By the time his own feelings changed, it was too late, Harry had moved on.
much.
“That’s it?” Longbottom asked, brows furrowed, and lips turned downward. “You flaunted your scent and expected him to fall in love? That’s so
"The Muggles apparently have it on good authority that a couple of Sorcerian Masters are developing a potion that will eliminate any threats lycanthropians pose."
His mind, however, was on tea.
Which led him to the other reason to drag his feet: there were definitely some people who would
Sorcerian.
They finished the trek to the first floor together, purposefully giving off an air as though they were deep in serious discussion, and were able to avoid being approached until they found their respective places among the long table covered in heavy cloth and some of Malfoy Manor's finest dinnerware. To his delight, his reserved place was across from Snape, so he hoped that would salvage some of the night.
Sorcerian Snape gave him a cool look but didn't say anything. Draco was used to this. Snape did worse at these functions than he himself did.
And finally, as always…
, she disappeared.
"Ah, Sorcerian Longbottom, of course. He's opened that Herbology plant in Scotland, correct?"
He enjoyed the gardens anyway. They were, of course, always altered and decorated for these events, but even in the day-to-day, Narcissa Malfoy loved her gardens. Fairy lights twinkled over the most colourful of flowers, and the large bushes were cut to depict either famous or magisterially obscure magician statues. The gardens probably had his second favourite smell outside his labs.
"Three." Nott granted him a small nod. "I take it that this award marks the end of this most recent academic stint?"
Draco stopped himself from swearing. "Ah. That case. Yes, indeed I've read about it."
"It won't take long, you know. The Goldsteins are widely respected, and I suspect it won't take five minutes for the Court to side in their favour."
"Right. Never mind. Thank you, Wadpey."
The amount of history Draco had been forced to study over the judicial side of things was dizzying to think about still today. However, he did understand, probably more than most, where the Muggles were coming from. He had seen, up close and personal, just how
old," Draco groaned, rolling his eyes. It should have been worrisome he could fall so readily into the ease they used to communicate. Instead, it was a relief.
The sweet smell of his tea caught his attention, and he rose from one of his many desks with a journal still in hand to strode down to where it was boiling. He removed the kettle from the gas burner he had there and chewed his lip as he pulled milk from one of his Muggle iceboxes.
"What is that you're working on these days?" She asked to continue the conversation as the washbowls were replaced with soup. "And congratulations on the latest award. It was for burn-salve, correct?"
magic could get.
. He was already well known by the time Draco was grown, and Draco had had to watch in horror as he grew in influence. Not many people knew he was behind Minister Fudge's policies and the decisions his administration made. Fudge was nothing more than a fool, a puppet, a stooge. No, Riddle was behind the current administration, breeding in frankly old-fashion and all-around ignorant ideals, and Draco was genuinely sad it was working.
"I take it you've seen the papers," Nott changed the subject. It was a purposely innocuous steer, a small trap, one Draco could always spot miles away but could never do anything about.
Yes, Sorcerian Draco Malfoy had the utmost confidence in their respective governments and their leaders, and he gave his full support to the administrations that worked so tirelessly for their people. "Our governments have to make hard decisions day after day, and while some might not be popular, I know they have our best interests at heart."
As usual, the festive atmosphere gave way to an eager feeling of something new. Draco had learned to loathe that feeling.
Bones' eyes lit up. "Absolutely. I can send you their information if you want. I know Sorcerian Longbottom gives discounts and regular delivery schedules for researchers."
"If it isn't my favourite Sorcerian Master," he greeted, taking a subtle breath.
Here, it was late enough into the night that those he would encounter throughout the gardens would be deep into their own conversation, aiming for some semblance of privacy. The older guests were already making their last rounds inside before leaving, and soon after, the men and women left would divide. Draco wasn't sure where the women went to, but the men usually congregated in a smaller hall where cards were dealt, heftier drinks were served, pipes were passed around, and 'business' was engaged.
Draco successfully avoided being cornered by Sorcerians Thicknesses, Umbridge, Jorkins, and Edgecombe. When he spotted Sorcerian Master Snape, he rushed toward him.
A chill crawled up Draco's spine because he knew definitively that Nott's actual meaning was the opposite.
a Master, in all but title. If the world wasn't in such a state of unrest, this would normally be greeted with praise.
Draco clenched his jaw and tried to remain calm. "No, ma'am. Magicians are not limitless."
Draco quickly finished his soup as Bones and Regulus discussed the latest foreign policies.
Once he actually began participating in politics, he quickly learned that it was less that the politicians cared about the people they were supposed to represent and more that they cared about their vaults. He had yet to meet a politician who hadn't drastically changed their political opinions and votes over the years. Particularly if they had recently dined with the infamous, long-standing political leader, Sorcerian Riddle.
, let alone create something that would guarantee them judicial claim to equality."
"I see," Nott hummed. He stared at Draco for another moment, assessing, then turned back to look out the window. "Until next time, then. Good day, Sorcerian Malfoy."
Draco then made his way downstairs where he was whisked away by elitists desperate to introduce him to their daughters, granddaughters, nieces, and other available, well-bred females. He obliged dancing with a few, finding those who could actually engage him intellectually far more tolerable than those who spent the time telling him of their pure blood and mastery of skills suited for a Sorcerian's wife. It was tedious, but he eventually got to dance with each of the Greengrass sisters who were possibly less interested in betrothal than he was. Dancing with them was always a good time.
Centuries ago, the Muggles won the war, but by a stroke of unprecedented empathy, they did not attempt to stomp magical people out of existence. Instead, they forged a treaty, so they could live in peace.
"How are your studies, Sorcerian Malfoy?" Nott opened. He said this as politely as anything, but his lip curled slightly at the word 'studies'.
Draco hummed. "I should get in contact then."
Draco sighed and looked forlornly at his tea. He was already dressed in his gala-best, and if Wadpey was fetching him, he was very close to being later than what was fashionable. With a gut full of dread, Draco dumped his tea and locked up his lab.
It didn't help that the current political climate among the magicians was being fueled by the progressive one among the Muggles. Among the Muggles, their inventions were quickly making the magicians needed less and less, and most of the magically-inclined were terrified of losing their jobs, their careers, their
Therefore, something inherently more complicated, such as lycanthropy, was not technically completely Dark. Yes, it was mostly Dark, but with it also came the construction of one's strength, senses, and instincts along with a healing factor of its own. Not to mention the construction of physical traits when triggered along with the deconstruction of others.
Draco's carriage arrived to double lines of Muggle coppers holding back the yelling journalists and flashing photographers. He ignored them as he made his way inside, but inside, he had to do a circuit to pay his respects to the location and actually talk to members of the press who somehow earned a special pass.
"Right," he said to the room. "Time to start a new project."
As the guests made their way downstairs and the music turned into something more upbeat and dance-worthy, Draco made sure to stop by his parents. He shook his father's hand and kissed his mother's cheek, complimenting them on the turn out and the excellent food and decoration. His mother welcomed him as she always did, and his father merely commented that he was surprised Draco could get away—telling Draco in his own way just how angry he was in Draco's continued absence.
Because this?
And then Draco had to stop himself from snorting.
"Quite." Nott finally took a sip of his tea, and Draco was lamented to see he had almost finished his own.
Draco knew better, and tonight could potentially show exactly what kind of fight it would be to continue. If he was brave enough to test the waters.
Draco forced him to snigger in agreement, trying not to think about just how much those regulations had changed. Before he could steer the subject to more small talk, a voice to Draco's right interrupted.
"But what about the rumours of the debates in the Sorcery Courts, Mr Malfoy? Is there any truth to the in-fighting behind closed doors?"
Most guests were slowly making their way up the marble stairs, and Draco quickly made his way up, pausing only now and then when he was effectively cornered by someone. The first to corner him was, of course, Sorcerian Slughorn who still to that day kept attempting to wrangle Draco into accepting some kind of apprenticeship with him. The next was Minister Fudge, who was singing praises of Draco's father's work this year in the courts. Then there was Sorcerian Karkaroff who had a nasty habit of attempting to get Draco to agree to meet with him privately, and finally, Sorcerian Crouch Jr who had an increasingly crazed look in his eye each time Draco saw him.
If Draco was agreeable to Nott, to Slytherins and their causes, he could go into the Royal Court, cast his ballot against the Goldsteins, and his one vote would count as much if not more than six Muggle ones. Because he was highly influential, many other epistocratics would likely follow his lead. If he had the mind to, Draco could single-handedly influence the Goldsteins right into Azkaban.
, but that he would only ever admit to himself. No, in public, when he was called to weigh in, he was, indeed, neutral. As most were.
"I'm glad to hear it. I'm sorry to not readily know, but to whom was she betrothed?"
"I'm right behind you," Harry called out.
“You’re a parselmouth Harry. You can talk to snakes so it would make sense that you’d  hear the Basalisk before it killed.”
“Gotta pick one of us boys then, Draco,” said Blaise.
Amused, Draco raised an eyebrow and sat down. "You don't think you are?"
“Hello, sirs,” said an unnaturally high voice from behind them. Harry let out a strangled noise and grabbed Draco’s arm as he whirled around.
“No. Pansy- please just stop? Don’t get my hopes up. If he liked me why was he making out with Clemonte? I just- I’ll get over it. I just need time.”
Draco looked up from his book and Harry got a full view. “Huh?”
When they went down to breakfast to find Mr Malfoy grumbling over his coffee about someone tricking him into freeing his house elf the trio shared a look and Harry quickly hid his sockless foot under his lap.
Draco imagined the hot water washing over his skin. He wouldn’t mind that right now. “If you’re sure?”
“You're still his friend. You care about him. You’re allowed to not want him to ruin his lungs.”
“You think?”
Harry shook his head. "I can't even remember what happened."
Harry squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head. No no no no no. “Back up. Slow down. What?!”
Her nose wrinkled in disgust. “Nasty. No, I’m a lady. Harry, truth or dare?”
“Guess we’d better go down?” Harry asked.
Draco stood in the doorway of the dorm room, unable to move from where he was frozen staring. “Why, pray tell, are you doing push ups on the floor of our dormitory?”
“No, I mean, I don’t know for sure but he’s very open about people and their differences and treating everyone the same blah blah blah.” Draco pulled at his hair in frustration. Of course he had to be gay and of course he had to fall for the one person he couldn’t.
He slept restlessly.
Blaise’s nose crinkled. “What are you wearing, Potter?”
He beamed at her.  “I would never.”
Harry turned to their Headmaster. “It wasn’t me, Sir, I swear.”
Harry looks down at his soaking wet trainers. His socks are damp and he can hardly feel his frozen toes. He wiggles them around a bit, trying to regain sensation. Harry knows he appears rather shabby, that his clothing must look very old and worn, especially in a place like Malfoy Manor. He doesn’t know what to say so he keeps his eyes averted and shakes his head.
Draco looked out the window. This was exactly the reason why he’d wanted to find another compartment, this conversation. Well, the displays of affection as well but he really didn’t want to be here while they talked about the progression of their relationship.
“They’ll love you no matter what.”
“Trust me.”
“Truth.”
“Nothing.” he forced a laugh. “Just thought we were in the same boat. Guess I better get a date soon then, huh?”
Narcissa stormed down the halls of Hogwarts, memories of her own days as a student in these halls flooded back to her. However, she didn’t let herself focus on them as her priorities were elsewhere.
Of course he’s masturbated before but it’s usually been a quick and rushed affair in the shower to make it go away fast before lessons. It’s always been an inconvenience. Now he’s filled with an excited rush, a heated tingling, every stroke felt good.
“Ready to get up?”
“Never have I ever cheated on a test,” said Draco. Everyone else took a shot. “In what class?!”
Without hesitation Draco said, “I’m coming with you.”
“It’s summer!” Theo hollered as he threw open the compartment door and settled in beside Draco, who sat across from Harry.
“History of magic, potions and astronomy,” said Harry.
He looked worried, how brown creased. “This might not be my place so you know I’m sorry if this is intrusive but you looked upset reading that letter down in the common room.”
“Since when are you so chummy with Diggory?”
A muscle in his jaw twitched. He glowered. “It’s not Griffin bloody Clemonte professing his feelings for you?”
“You came here for me to help you with your cufflinks, where are they?”
“Well let’s go in, shall we?” He said, after stepping away from hugging Harry. Theo picked up the knocker and slammed it down on the thick wood of the door. The sound was joltingly loud and abrasive.
I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter's godfather, hereby give him permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends.
“Both.”
Harry snorted. “And then less accidentally the next morning?”
Just then the music slowed down and Pansy slid her arms around his neck. Harry tensed up, he’d never done much slow dancing before. The tension eased from his body before long though, turned out there wasn’t much to it. Slow dancing was mostly just swaying back and forth with your arms around another person.
Two weeks before Christmas break there’d been another Hogsmeade trip, to everyone’s delight except Harry’s. That’s when Ron’s older brothers, mischievous twins of Hogwarts had pulled him aside.
“Mm?” He hummed, distracted.
“Pleasure to meet you,” Theo said, looking him right in the eye.
“Truth or dare?” Draco asked Blaise.
Just as Harry was losing hope with both the Anti-Dementor lessons things started to look up just a bit.
“So what?” Harry challenged.
Theo laughed at their faces. “Well, yeah, I was trying to get someone to ask about it on the way to Hogwarts on the train but none of you did.”
“I wanted to tan,” Draco huffed. They’d reached the end of the hall and Draco pushed open his bedroom door, allowing Harry to go in first.
“Theodore, are you seriously rolling a joint right now?” Pansy demanded. Harry’s eyes went to what Theo was taking out of the plastic bag and had to suppress his grin. Classic Theo.
“That Umbridge lady is a daft cow. I honestly don’t think I can go to another one of her classes,” Harry threw Defensive Magical Theory across the room.
“What are you talking about?” Harry looked around at all the scared faces watching him. “I was telling the snake to leave her alone.” The great hall was utterly silent.
Pansy looked up at him with wide, hopeful eyes. “Really?”
"You're right though." She hit him on the shoulder. He hesitated, then decided to just have it out with. “That was a cruddy think for Nott to say.”
“This isn’t nothing,” Draco said, gesturing to him. “How much sleep do you get?”
“Mother said you were always awfully affectionate s’all!” Draco smirked.
"Why?" Draco sounded miffed.
“That is the question isn’t it?’ Dumbledore answered Draco with a question. Draco hated when people did that.
“Oh yeah.”
“What, so are you just never going to talk to him again?” Harry sat in stony silence. He didn’t have an answer for that, he didn’t know what he was going to do yet. “He’s your best friend!”
Harry rolled his eyes at Draco’s theatrics. “What my Aunt and Uncle wouldn’t do to live here.”
She clenched her jaw. “And?”
"So who do you live with?" Draco asked.
“We’ll figure this out Harry! Just like we always do!”
“Sick,” replied Draco.
Draco paused, seeming to consider his answer. With a soft sigh he said, “My parents went into hiding.”
He supposed that was true. Biting the inside of his cheek and fidgeting with his sleeve he asked, “Are you and father going to be here this year?”
Harry and Draco waited in silence as the sounds of someone taking the camera from Creevey and opening it filled the room. Then came the sound of a small explosion. No photo than, Draco assumed.
“Truth or dare, Pansy?”
“Ron told us all about how you couldn’t get your Aunt or Uncle to sign the Hogsmeade permission slip.”
Draco felt a flutter of pride in his chest at his best friends skill but crushed it promptly.  Harry had been avoiding him for, what was it now? Had it really been almost two months?
He listened, shocked, as Lupin told him about how as students at Hogwarts his father, James, his godfather, Sirius and their friend, Pete, had all become illegal Animagi to keep him company during his transformations. A stag, a dog and a rat.
Harry furrowed his brows, confused. “What’s this?”
“When are we ever going to need to transform an owl into opera glasses?” grumbed Theo, turning around to face Harry and Pansy.
“What happened to not going anywhere?” Pansy lashed out.
“Just drop it-”
Harry’s mouth curved into a small smile. “Sometimes. Truth or dare?”
Sixth year
The night of the Malfoy Christmas party the three of them all fell into Draco’s bed, tipsy and exhausted. The drapes had been pulled closed and the room was full of a warm glow, created by the countless candles lit on every flat surface.
“You asked if he could come a week before the break, sweetheart,” his mother replied, tone impatient.
Harry felt Draco’s cool fingers, gentle at his chin, turning his face so he had to look into the other boys grey eyes. “No, you didn’t,” he insisted, voice firm. “Harry, Black is free now.”
Pain wrenched through him as the tears in Draco’s eyes fell. “You know I am, Draco. Why would you think I’m not?’
“Give me the rat,” Lupin said to Harry in a calm and collected voice. But his eyes were filled with something hard.
Fred gasped dramatically, like Harry had mortally offended him. “Just a piece of parchment he says!”
“Well what do we do now?” Ron asked as they walked the corridors.
Harry stretched his legs out in front of him and twisted so that his back popped. He let out a sigh of satisfaction. “What do you care?”
“Mean.” Harry pouted. “Not even my watermelon pink ones covered in snitches?”
Pansy glanced up into his face. Her breath caught. They were rather close. So close that she could see the way the green in his eyes mixed with the brown. So close she could have counted all of his freckles. So close the urge to press her lips to his dark pink ones was stronger than ever.
“Harry, dear, you don’t have to do that,” Mrs Malfoy said.
"Yikes, I forgot as well," Harry confessed.
“Yeah, I’ll go grab it.” Harry went down the hall and rifled around under the bed in the guest room he’d been sleeping in. Clutching the long parcel he tried to keep his balance as he entered the living room and stepped around presents and gift wrap.
“Yeah, over the summer. I meant to write to you. I just missed you so much and I wasn’t sure how you’d react.”
Harry cleared his throat, heart pounding his chest he was grateful she’d changed the subject. “Sure, do the swoopy things you usually do.”
Harry looked away from his friends and instead shifted his gaze to Draco who’s head rested gently on his shoulder. The other boy had fallen asleep almost as soon as they sat down. He sighed gently in his sleep and Harry smiled down at him softly.
“We’re going to get stopped in the hallway if we keep going,” Ron said, worrying his lower lip.
“You’re always going on about your great defeats and last night weren’t you saying you know where the entrance to the chamber is?”
“Those are new.”
Harry’s voice in the dark startled him. “Everything is falling apart.”
They loved him now, they had to love him after.
Harry snorted at that. “Thanks for the encouragement, I guess?”
He only let go when she pulled away to wipe at her nose so it wouldn’t drip on his shoulder. That would have been really embarrassing and gross.
“I do.”
He knew he was being immature, that he was being a total git and that it’d be best to shut his mouth but he found himself having a hard time keeping his mouth shut. “Calling me a nutter.”
“The eye mask is extra enough for you?”
“Well sorry for asking,” Draco raised his hands in innocence. “It’s just I don’t understand how else your name was drawn!”
“Pansy, we’re all scared.”
“Pansy!” Harry smiled so hard his cheeks hurt. “Did you get us all a ticket?”
“Yes, it is,” Harry said forcefully.
“We just got back from Zürich, Switzerland and my dumb ass decided not to wear sunscreen while we were there because I thought I was too good for it.”
“Huh?” Harry looked around for a shirt.
Harry nodded.
“Maybe in a little while it’ll go away? Merlin, I don’t know, this is so inconvenient,” Draco moaned, bringing a pillow over his face and resisting the urge to scream into it.
Blaise chewed at the inside of his cheek. “That’s just the thing. No one knows.”
Y’all in this time of lockdown I’ve had plenty of time to become re inspired to finish Raised a Malfoy. Hopefully it doesn't take me as long to post chapter 9 (the final chapter!) as it did for me to post this one. Enjoy!
Harry grimaced and squeezed his arms tightly around Draco’s middle, making the squirmy boy wriggle. “See, it sounds really cute what you’re saying but for all I know you could be telling me I stink.”
The corners of Theodore’s eyes crinkled when he grinned. “You gonna paint my nails now?” He asked teasingly, voice gentle.
“Have you ever had a crush on a teacher?” Pansy asked Harry.
Harry seemed hesitant as well. It took him a moment to reply. "Sure."
“Draco, what are you doing here?” Harry sputtered weakly.
The other boy rolled eyes and clenched his jaw. “Why do you care? Why are you thinking about that?!”
Harry stuck his tongue out at Draco. "Yes, mother."
The ride to Hogwarts was nice until one of the boys from earlier opened the compartment door.
“Draco?”
“Well, it says right there on his case,” muttered Draco. “Professor R. J. Lupin.”
Even after all that, to cap it all off, Harry fainted when the Dementors interfered during the first Quidditch match. It would have been bad enough, fainting in front of everyone because of the Dementors, if only his broom hadn’t blown away in the storm and been smashed into a dozen bits of wood and twig, totally unrepairable. He’d also seen the silhouette of an enormous shaggy balck dog imprinted against the sky at the top of the Quidditch stands. This was the second time he’d seen the Grim. And the sound of his mothers begging voice haunted him. The sound of her begging Voldemort not to kill him. His nightmares were worse than ever.
Draco seemed to not know how to respond to that and he shifted in his seat. "Oh."
“Erk!” Draco fake gagged and pulled a face. “Don’t babe me. Are you trying to make me puke?”
He ticked them off on his fingers. “Creevey’s a muggleborn, Fletchley’s a muggleborn, Grangers’s a muggleborn and Clearwater, that girl from Ravenclaw who was attacked is muggleborn or half blood as well because she isn’t a pureblood.”
"Harry! Think fast!" Draco hollered, throwing an apple he'd pulled out from his pocket into the air. It went over the green house . Harry sailed after it, leaning on the broom to increase his speed. To his shock and satisfaction he caught the apple. However he pulled up short when he realised he was in plain view of everyone on the grounds. He quickly retreated behind the greenhouse. "Malfoy, you dumbass! People definitely saw me!"
Blaise made a face back and Pansy threw a decorative pillow at him. “Never have I ever stuck gum under a desk.”
Harry shrugged, self conscious. “Well, I don’t know, but someone has to right? We’re not learning anything from Umbridge so-”
"Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size, and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it."
This got Harry’s attention. “Who’s Dobby?”
“Who wouldn’t be excited about sparkly pink talons?” Theodore joked and she was suppressed a smile.
“I bloody wouldn’t trust you with keeping a pygmy puff alive let alone helping my best friend, you incompetent baffoon!” Arms reached out toward Harry and Draco was ready to scream bloody murder when he realised it was Pansy and relaxed a fraction. “You have to help me get him to the infirmary,” Draco begged Pansy, panic rising up in him.
“Here’s something better,” Theo struggled to pull his sock back on with one hand as he passed the nearly empty vodka bottle. Blaise downed the rest.
“Do you hear that?”
Pansy shrugged. “A couple times in Transfigurations.”
Draco cleared his throat. Why was he panicking? “Have I?”
Theo wolf whistles and cackles as he passes Draco on his way in, “Nice abs Potter!”
“I think we should sleep on it,” offered Pansy. “Talk about it more tomorrow when we all have clear heads.”
"Splendid! It's good to know some people before actually getting there."
“Now here we have something different,” Harry whispered to Pansy. They’d reached two massive, intricately carved gold doors with potted plants on either side of the doors.
“You hang out with Megan at all?” Harry asked Theo. Megan Jones was the girl Theo had asked to the Yule Ball and fooled around with the year before.
“Like Filch’s cat?” Pomfrey seemed surprised.
He had no idea who Theo was talking about but said, “Oh, her! Yeah, she’s hot.”
“There’s no voice, Potter.” Draco felt on edge. “Are you trying to mess with me?”
Draco tried talking to him but Theo would just get defensive and grumpy and stalk away saying there was nothing wrong.
“Why aren’t you and Potter attached at the hip anymore?”
“A shirt? and jeans?”
“So the missus is coming for dinner tonight?” They turned a corner and Harry nearly knocked down what looked like a very expensive vase. Looking up, Harry saw that the whole hallway on both sides was full of oil portraits of who Harry assumed to be Draco’s ancestors. All the witches and wizards were scowling and had very sharp features. It was a very long hallway.
“Ah! Tu parle français? Ton accent est charmant!” (ah! you speak french? your accent is lovely!) the girl exclaimed. Harry had no idea what she was saying whatsoever but her whole face lit up as her and Draco blathered on for the rest of the meal.
the one with sirius black, croquet, friendship bracelets and a confession
The dancing turned out to be a lot more fun than Harry had thought. Dancing with Pansy wasn’t stiff or uncomfortable like dancing with anyone else had been, it was light and easy and he laughed the whole time. They leaned on each other for support as they giggled into each others shoulders and told jokes.
“Just drop it would you. I’m not angry and I don’t sound bitter.”
“Are you high, Theodore?” Pansy licked her lips and raised her eyebrows, giving him an unimpressed look. Draco noticed she’d completely ignored his comment about not calling him Theodore.
“I don’t know. Maybe. Those are both good ideas.” Harry didn’t want his friends to think he didn’t appreciate their help but neither of those ideas really stuck with him.
"No? Should I?"
“Fine. Truth or dare it is. Draco, you in?”
Harry was about to reply when he heard something. Frightened voices. “Hold on, do you hear that?” Up ahead there was hushed whispering. The boys sped up and peeked around the corner. Harry’s heart stopped beating in his chest. The first time there’d been an attack there’d been writing on the walls warning the school that the chamber had been reopened. Now there was another message. Harry read and reread it. He was having trouble breathing.
“Why?” Draco looked confused.
Harry rolled his eyes, pursed his lips. Then an amused look entered his eyes. making Draco feel uneasy, and Harry smirked. “You know what’s really fucking hot?”
Pansy grinned up at him, eyes twinkling. "Thanks, Theodore."
“You look lovely,” Harry told her.
"I wrote to my mother."
“Jeez, you look like shit, Nott,” Harry told him when he exited the bathroom.
“That’s how big he is. The Minister of Magic had to warn the Muggle Minister.”
"Hopefully Slytherin. Then we can be housemates." Draco grinned at him. "It would make sense if you were. Slytherins are destined for greatness. You killed the darkest wizard of all time when you were a baby. Imagine what you're capable of now!"
He sat beside her in Transfigurations while Draco and Theodore at the desk in front of them. McGonagall had just finished her lesson and Harry set down his quill, hand cramping from writing so much.
“Merry Christmas, Harry.”
“Dare.”
“Maybe you could get drafted to a famous Quidditch team?” Pansy suggested.
“Meet you down there?”
Draco’s face  twisted in puzzlement. “Blaise babbling to Pansy up ahead?”
“Piss off, Parkinson,” Theo sulked, slouching down his seat.
"I was wondering if any of you had studied for tomorrow's herbology test?" The boy asked, bracing himself with his hands and leaning against the sofa he and Pansy were slumped in.
It was a wonder they didn’t miss the train. Between Draco’s stupidly long morning skin routine, Theo’s sudden realisation that he’d fallen asleep before packing the night before and Harry’s trouble getting Hedwig settled in her cage.
Draco stared at him and pursed his lips and without saying anything walked right passed Harry and out his bedroom door.
“Sounds lovely dear- Hold on, Harry?”
His head snapped over to look at Pansy. "I'm not staring."
“I smell apple pie baking,” the boy told them as he pulled off his hat and gloves. “That’ll be soooo good with some vanilla ice cream on top.”
“What do you mean why?” Pansy pulled a face. “You and Harry have only been here for two years and both years you end up fighting the Dark Lord and almost dying.”
“When did I realise I was pathetically pining after my best friend?” Harry ran both hands through his hair. “When it finally dawned on me why I was so upset about seeing him make out with another guy. When seeing him eat a dripping nectarine and lick his fingers is enough to give me a boner.”
Harry and Draco had shared an amused look. It was so like Pansy to wear outfits based off her mood regardless of the weather.
"Like my Aunt and Uncle," Harry quickly added, smiling at Hermione. Draco automatically fell silent.
Harry had never been anything like the annual Malfoy Christmas Party before. He’d finally accepted the point to having four living rooms as the entire house was full of witches and wizards. Draco must have noticed Harry’s hesitancy with the crowd because he’d pulled Harry back up to his room to talk for a bit.
She raised her face from the floor, eyes glistening. “No, I do, of course I do. It’s Theodore fucking Nott. How could I not like him back?!”
"That doesn't matter. It doesn't make saying it alright."
“Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. Et s'il vous plaît, le plaisir est tout pour moi.” (Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. And please, the pleasure is all mine.)
“Aren't you glad I make you take those dance lessons with me when you come to the manor?”
Harry made a sound like a growl at the back of his throat. "I can't see you soding asshat. Give them back." Pansy had started laughing hard and heads at the Slytherin table started turning to look at what was so funny. "Draco!" Harry's eyes were unfocused and Draco was laughing hard now too.
They continued bickering about Lockharts teaching qualifications until they reached the landing where the Gryffindor’s would go up the stairway to their dormitory and the Slytherin’s would go down. “Hey Harry,” Ron said. Draco watched his friend turn to face the redhead. “You’re playing Ravenclaw in a couple weeks, right?”
Draco’s breath caught in his throat. “What?”
“I can read it over for you tonight,” Pansy told him, kissing his cheek.
“I know. I’m glad you have such good friends. Not just Harry but Pansy too. You can have her up next year if you’d like?” She offered, hopefully.
Harry took the gift, confused. Unwrapping it he unfurled a cloak. A note fluttered to the ground. Harry picked it up but all it said, in looping cursive, was 'use it well'.
“I have to study for OWLs,” said Draco stiffly.
“He’s totally sweet on you,” Harry told her, laughing.
“Have a good summer,” Pansy replied.
“We already went down that path,” he chuckled. "Is that still an offer?"
“Parselmouth.” Draco heard the word repeated through the great hall. He couldn’t take it anymore. He stood from his spot at the Slytherin table and walked down between the tables until he’d reached Harry. Snagging his hand he pulled the other boy from the great hall and down to the Slytherin dorms.
Harry spent the rest of the afternoon writing to Sirius and Remus who were living together at Grimmauld Place. He enjoyed reading the letters he got from them, half written by each with notes added by one to the other’s section. Draco sat on the couch across from him, reading a book by a classic muggle author, Pansy sat on the one he was leaning against flipping through her most recent issue or Witches Weekly. Blaise sat closer to the fire as he wrote a letter to his mother while Theo lay on the rug to take a nap, his arm draped over his eyes. When an old grandfather clock in the corner struck five o’clock Draco suggested that they all get changed for supper.
“Then...but of course!” She said, like something was occuring to her, she collapsed in a fit of laughter.
Harry smiled brightly. “Sure thing. Also, you don’t really think the makeup looks awful do you?”
“I’m not mad. Why are you?”
“You have to get rid of it,” Draco insisted, backing up Pansy.
Her eyes swam with tears but she blinked them away. “Thanks, Theodore. Sorry you have to see me like this,” she sniffed.
"I think we should talk to them more."
“I don’t know,” Hermione said, hesitantly. “Have you read his books? He seems awfully smart in them.”
Refusing to be put off by the teasing Draco countered, “Hey handsome.” When he went to close the compartment door Harry sat up all the way.
Theo flushed a deep red. “Er- sorry, Professor. I didn’t realize you were behind me.”
Pansy swallowed thickly. She’d never really had any serious conversations with Theodore. Those usually happened with Harry or Draco. But both of them had a lot going on at the moment and she didn’t want to bother them while they already had so much to think about. “My parents are getting a divorce.” She wasn’t sure why she told him. Pansy hadn’t really planned on telling anyone. But he’d offered and talking about her feelings had worked before in the past.
But Black only shook his head and in a raspy voice explained how he’d convinced James and Lily to change their secret keeper to Peter. How Peter had faked his death and framed him.
“I haven’t thought about it much honestly,” admitted Harry.
That afternoon they’d all spent a bit of time knocking about in an abandoned classroom. The cool winter air from a sticky broken window made the room chilly and Harry leant Pansy his sweater for her next class after lunch.
Harry curled around Draco who slept on his back. It was uncomfortable but Draco didn't want to wake Harry. A tear stain was drying on his shirt and Draco tried to focus on that instead of his thoughts. He’d been meaning to ask Harry why things between them had shifted so suddenly from better than ever to tense and awkward. Then Harry had a nightmare and they’d rushed to the Ministry of Magic to save Harry’s godfather only for Sirius to come to save Harry and die at the hands of Bellatrix Lestrange, his cousin, Draco’s aunt and one of the Dark Lords most loyal and dedicated followers.
Upon apparating into the front hall of Malfoy Manor, Harry immediately felt at ease. He couldn’t put his finger on it exactly. It wasn’t as if Malfoy Manor was home. However, it smelled the way Draco did and it was that familiarity that he suspected put him at ease.
“Draco-”
A dark look settled over Draco’s face. “As long as there’s no denial that he is planning.”
“And you must be Theo.”
“Fuck.” Harry rubbed at his eyes and tear stained cheeks, his glasses getting in the way. He hated the look in her eyes. The pity.
“Mm,” Harry grunted, purposefully turning away and shoving his glasses up his nose.
“Uh huh,” Pansy giggled.
It was the longest Harry had ever gone not talking or communicating with Draco in any way. It was strange, even over the summer they wrote letters. He’d grown close with Ron ever since Draco and him had stopped talking. They sat together in the classes they had with each other and spent all of their free time trying to find the entrance to the chamber of secrets.Pansy spent her time going between Harry and Draco. It was annoying to Harry that she did this but he didn’t want to be the one to tell her to choose between her two best friends. So instead Harry spent a lot of time with Ron Wealsey.
She hesitated. Draco saw the subtle nod Harry gave her and wondered what it meant. Pansy sighed. “We broke it off.”
Draco stood and came around, the only place to sit was beside Harry. He forced himself, heart beating out of his chest, to sit beside his best friend. “I’m not just gonna sit around and watch.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “This sort of changes things.”
A couple times Harry saw Draco dancing with Claudette, spinning her around on the dance floor so her dress twirled up. When this happened he’d pull Pansy closer and whisper something funny in her ear.
Draco planted one last firm kiss on Harry’s lips. Harry closed his eyes and tried to wrap his arms around Draco to draw him closer to him. However, the other boy was already stepping away, grinning, as he bent over to pick up his coat from the floor where he’d dropped it earlier to better occupy his hands with the ever so important task of gripping Harry’s hips.  “We’re not ditching. Pansy would be pissed. Let’s go.”
Harry roared with laughter. “This is too good,” he said once he’d calmed down enough to talk, putting down Hedwig and his trunk he wiped a tear from the corner of his eye.
“You know, since you haven’t got a date to the ball?”
“Shit,” Theo buried his face in his hands.
Dear Harry,
Harry’s face was close enough that Draco could feel each exhalation on his face. The other boy always looked so peaceful when he slept. Innocent. Trying to be quiet and careful, Draco started to untangle their legs because he desperately had to use the lavatory. The motion must’ve woken Harry though because the next thing Draco knew the other boy was squinting up at him.
Draco’s cheeks coloured, self conscious. He set his book down. “Couple weeks ago.”
Theo pulled back and stared at Pansy, giving into one more kiss, before he booked it in the direction of his own class. Harry and Blaise laughed. Just then there was a commotion in front of them. Pansy’s ex, Aldrich, materialized out of the swarm of buzzing students. Pansy’s face soured the moment she saw him and Harry’s heart sunk. The look on Aldrich’s face was full of intention.
“You know- you know they have more traditional views than most witches and wizards…”
“Bonjour, c'est un plaisir de vous rencontrer. Je suis Claudette Bernard.” (it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Claudette Bernard) The girl extended her hand to Draco. Harry watched, internally seething, as Draco pressed his lips lightly to the top of the hand she’d extended.
“Be done in a bit,” Harry said before heading up the stairs, taking them two at a time. Draco watched him leave before heading to the kitchen.
The crushed look on Draco’s face had filled him with guilt. But even if he stopped avoiding his best friend how could he explain to him why he’d been avoiding him in the first place? How could Harry ever tell him he was attracted to him. The simple answer was that he couldn’t.
“How’d you get all these?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” seethed Theo, turning his back, a crease between his brows.
Draco’s face twisted into astonishment and disbelief. “What, so now this true heir is back and has unsealed the chamber?”
“Is that really what would happen?”
First Year
“Where’s Harry?” his mother asked, looking around the platform. “I want to say hello before you all get on the Hogwarts Express and I don’t see you until Christmas.”
“There’s something I should probably tell you,” he told her, consciously trying to relax his posture.
Harry smiled at Draco softly. “I love it.”
"Aldrich called Pansy a slut, Professor!" Lavender Brown exclaimed, stepping forward from the crowd of gathered students at the scene.
“Do you think he’ll try again?” Ron asked, fidgeting with the starch white material of the crisp hospital bed sheets.
Then she was kissing him. It felt....wet. Warm. This was his first. He’d always worried it would be gross and sticky or that he wouldn’t know what to do. This was nice. The music and the way their lips moved against each other lulled him into a fuzzy state and he lost track of everything else.
“We have a house elf to do this kind of work,” Mr Malfoy told him.
“So you’ve all heard about the escape of Sirius Black, right?” said Theodore as Harry took a swing at his ball. He completely missed and ended up uprooting the little white gate instead.
He raised his eyebrows. “Is that really your pep talk?”
“Well, my father will get tickets. And your coming with us of course,” Draco said, as if they’d discussed this before now.
His mother’s eyes looked sad and Draco felt bad for pushing her like this. “I know, love. At least Harry’s here, right? You two are very close.”
Draco sat forward. "You'll be even more powerful now."
“Harry-” but he was already turning away and rushing down the stairs. He had to get out of the library.
“Piss off.” Theo shucked a shoe at Blaise. “No, Potter and Parkinson got hot and messy last night.”
“Why not? I’ve smoked on the train ride to school before.”
Harry's brows furrowed. "Since when?"
Harry avoided Draco for the rest of the Winter Break as much as possible. He berated himself because deep down he knew he had no reason to be upset with Draco. The other boy hadn’t done anything wrong. The only problem was that every time they were in the same room together it made it even harder to not imagine Draco and the Clemonte boy sucking face. The memory made him unreasonably angry, made him want to break something. So Harry avoided Draco. Pansy asked him one time if he wanted to talk about what was wrong but Harry had insisted everything was fine.
There was still one thing that didn’t make sense though. “But the Basalisk can’t be in the walls,” said Draco.
Harry’s own cheeks burned. Daco wasn’t wearing anything and the only thing covering him up was a towel wrapped loosely and hanging low around his hips. Droplets of water fell in rivulets down Draco’s porcelain pale chest. Harry dragged his eyes up to the other boys.
“It’s getting late guys, I’m gonna head to bed now,” Harry told his friends, giving Pansy a peck on the lips before leaving the common room.
“You know, a wizard saved by another owes him a life dept. Pettigrew owes you, he’s bonded to you.”
“Then what?” Blaise persisted.
“No, but it can travel through the pipes.” They all sat in a stunned silence as they absorbed the information.
Harry was trying to figure out if this was some sort of joke. “Who in their right mind decided Gilderoy Lockhart should be a Professor?’
“No, of course he isn’t!” Draco snapped.
“You know you’re safe while you’re at Hogwarts though, right, Harry?” Pansy rested a hand on his shoulder, he supposed in an attempt to comfort him. Right now though all he felt was a cold displacement. “ I mean Dumbledore is a very powerful wizard. He’ll protect you.”
Theo smirked then turned to him. “So who do you think you’ll ask Harry?”
“You actually managed to make Potter look good. Nice job Pans,” Blaise nodded approvingly.
"A what?" Harry was starting to feel tired of not knowing so much.
“Pansy, we’re best friends,” Harry huffed. “Can you imagine how weird it would be if he found out I was head over heels for him?”
Harry’s expression hardened. “Someone got taken down into the chamber and we’re going to get them out.”
“We can’t all be brainiacs like you.” Harry wiggled his feet under Draco’s thigh, tucking them in.
“And I guess I was just wondering what’s wrong? If there’s anything I can do? If you want to talk or rant or anything.”
“You make it very hard.” But there was a soft fondness in Draco’s eyes.
“I dare you to take off a piece of clothing.”
Draco elbowed him. Jeez, pointy! “If you do I’ll be the one to skin you alive.”
Blaise snorted and flipped to the next page of his book. “Merlin, Draco, we get it. You’re proud to be in Slytherin,” he said, tone dry and sarcastic.
Hermione sighed and started to leave. "It's alright. Thanks anyway-"
Harry flipped his textbook open to the page Draco had his open at. "So what are we making?"
“Oooo!” Harry exclaimed and held up a thick cloak. It was emerald green with silver trim. “This is rather posh.”
“Yes,” Harry said, eyes closing. “I’d still be here.”
“You said he tried to talk to you after?”
“Sorry about that, I—”
“I wasn’t sure you remembered that,” Malfoy grabbed Harry’s glass and downed half of it. “You were drunk.”
As soon as the lift opened, everyone rushed to exit, some even giving Harry judgmental looks. Just lovely, fucking great.
“Why can’t you be my schoolteacher?”
“How affected
The eye wasn’t creepy, it was all a farce anyway. The magic it emitted was constantly reapplied and was nothing without the caster. Moody’s eye wasn’t any different than any other detecting spell, it was just showcased as a flashy separate entity.
Harry sighed before taking the few potions that were handed to him. Draco watched with narrowed eyes, making sure Harry swallowed every drop.
Anyway, I've rambled enough shks. I do hope you liked this chapter! I'm going to get to responding to comments here shortly. I really appreciate all your insight, it's been a blast and I can't believe there will only be one more update after this.
“If we have to wear the fucking things then so do you. Sit still.”
It was breathed into his ear, which would have been distracting but what
“Do you know why Sirius didn’t like you?”
That, Draco wanted to see. “Can I—”
That had Harry pausing. From what he understood from the journal was that reading was Malfoy’s haven. It was something that calmed him. Letting Goyle there was what really showed their type of friendship.
Draco snapped his head up as confusion coursed through him. There was no judgment on Potter’s face, no lingering disappointment and not even a frown in sight.
Not really. It was just a matter of learning magic in a different way. But Draco would let him think that.
The prophecy was a joke. A waste of time.
Potter tilted his head once as his lips protruded slightly, not quite a pout.
Harry shrugged again. “They met him, once and from what I saw nothing impressed me.”
“Hey,” Seamus threw the bludger at Nott who barely ducked in time. “I might be a lowlife, but Dean isn’t.”
“It’s the first day,” Mina said with bright eyes. That was the most excited he’d ever seen her, even if the rest of her face didn’t show it. “You think it will go well?”
He was offended, definitely offended. At least until he saw Potter’s lips twitching.
Draco narrowed his eyes as Longbottom
Potter’s face shuttered. Draco raised a hand to cup his cheek, and a flashback of the last time he did that flittered across his mind.
“Tell me what’s got that frown on your face.” Fingers brushed against Harry’s lips and he tried not to smile.
“Come back when you do.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed. “That part will die with the Wizards too. Don’t worry about that.”
“Oi,” Draco cried as he tried so shove Ron off him. “Potter and I aren’t together nor are we going to be.”
“You would think you would be a lot nicer to your only friend here.”
Maybe Draco did realize the significance of his words. That made Harry care for him that much more.
Harry shoved Ron away, ignoring the laughter he got in return. He took one last look around the office remembering all the years of hard work and sleepless nights. Would he miss it?
Harry tried to wandlessly summon his wand just in case things went sour, but he stilled when Malfoy whispered, “You’re right.”
“Whatever I want?”
“You have daddy issues.”

“Knew you’d catch on eventually.”
So, now we know what yellow means. Makes me melt a little that Draco has been fond of Harry. Alsooooo we now know their ages, that is if y'all paid attention to the brief mention of time in the daily prophet article.
“You preach feelings but didn’t care for mine.”
Six-man team. Déjà vu, right down to the one woman.
“If you want them to help,” Harry paused when Malfoy stood up. “Does that mean we are telling them about the fake relationship?” He frowned with each step Malfoy took toward him.
“All kinds,” Ron shrugged. “Some are deadly, some are just mild or irritating.”
“I don’t care.”
Draco closed his eyes. Harry had gone through four partners in the year since Draco left active duty.
“I knew that, I’ve always known that. We were friends. I never had a friend like him before and I knew he felt the same. That’s what we were
“Weird that Malfoy didn’t know you had a garden, huh?”
“Tell us what?” Draco wasn’t sure if it was Charlie or Bill who spoke, he hadn’t exactly worked out telling apart gingers.
“Pardon?” He straightened up and pulled at his already pristine robes. “Why am I to blame? I’ve done nothing.”
Well 👀👀
That wasn’t good.
“Malfoy—”
turned, Draco un-crouched from his position on the bannister and waited to hear the click of it shutting before he threw a succession of knives, all of them hitting exactly where he wanted, keeping Killian pinned to the door.
“Please repaint him,
Was that what a riddle was all about? Asking for something and in turn being given the answer? He still wasn’t sure what the answer was to Draco’s riddle but at times like this, when they were sated, happy and tired, it almost felt like an answer of sorts. But as for Harry’s riddle…
A day off. What a novel concept. No work, nothing that needed to be done, no plans to plot. Nothing but the prospect of fucking Harry all day.
Strangely enough, it seemed that he did know, or at least understand. Draco wasn’t sure how far that went, and he had to wonder if Amos would’ve been more supportive had he known Potter was the author.
Potter inhaled sharply, but Draco wouldn’t meet his eyes. He wasn’t ready to see what was there, not when things were uncertain for Potter.
“I got off light.” The lack of a defense surprised Draco. Was Sirius that self-aware, or just a very repentant person?
Harry moaned, eyes slipping closed before he sucked two fingers in his mouth, wishing they weren’t his; visions of slender fingers had him sucking harder, the moans increasing each time he fully sank down.
“Is full of shit,” Harry said, free hand clenching. What was with Wizards thinking they knew everything? “Wizards know very little about Magical Creatures but pretend they do while simultaneously treating them as lesser.”
Mister Malfoy?”
The only reason Harry went digging into the box he kept on his nightstand was because of how serious Draco sounded.
“They're my memories,” Draco whispered, looking straight ahead, grateful that his back was to Harry’s chest. “Each feather is a memory; one I never want to forget in case—” He couldn’t finish the sentence.
it was their own superiority that got them exactly where they deserve. One day, they will fall. And one day, I will watch it happen from the front lines.”
He hadn’t gotten more than a few feet before he was swept up in strong arms and they were mid-flight.
to meet his cousin. He already knew who Sirius would say, no one who looked at him could deny the similarities to his father.
“You,” Harry said, abandoning Scrimgeour, letting one of the Dementors take him instead. “What’s your name?”
“What were you thinking coming here?” Ron threw his hands in the air before he sat down behind the desk. Gosling would not appreciate that.
suspicious, but there had to be a reason, right? Was it a frame job? Was someone trying to make him appear guilty?
Harry closed his eyes. It would do no good to argue, the Dementors already knew what he’d say. He knew that normal Magic didn’t affect the Dementors like it would a human, but that didn’t mean he wanted to see them at the end of a wand.
“Care to elaborate?”
“Quiet!” A familiar voice shouted; voice amplified by magic. “We have gotten reports of an unusual amount of thefts and no one is to leave until questioned by my Aurors.”
“You like it?” Draco pulled on Harry’s robe until he was close enough to tumble them on the bed. “Teach me Parseltongue and we can do that more often.”
“Because I am.”

The Dementors
Harry laughed, the sound full of emotion and he couldn’t believe it was over Malfoy.
“Yeah,” Malfoy agreed. “Weird has always been taboo for me though.” Malfoy turned the handle of the
“Did you see the article in the Prophet? No one has seen Harry since the Death Eater trials,” Finnigan informed the Eighth-year common room.
“I hadn’t noticed.” A scoff had him snorting. “I appreciate that, I do, but it’s more your natural scent that bothers me.”
Harry narrowed his eyes when Malfoy looked away. “What did you do while I was sleeping?”
“I want to fight him.”
“Thank you.”
“That’s why we are such good friends, we care.”
been easy and who was to say it would ever start?
you?”
“What do you mean? His friends?”
“Changed his demeanour? How so?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Pansy is
Draco ran to Lucius, face buried in his robes, fingers clenching tightly in the fabric. “I used to wonder what was wrong with me. Why didn’t my parents love me?”
sure carried. A half-choke, half-cough escaped Ron, and Neville had to hit him on the back.
“You think there’s someone with enough power to control a Dementor.”
“Kiss me.” His hands balled into fists the longer Malfoy refused him and he wasn’t sure how much longer he could do it. “I want it,
Smith only paused for a moment before taking off towards the castle in a run, abandoning the Terry completely. The sound of Terry’s scream as he was knocked out of the tree by the small kitten only confirmed the belief that it would have been a mistake to have helped out.
As Draco looked over the railing, mind not fully seeing the landscape as his distracted thoughts took over, part of him wished he did give a fuck. Because the person staring blankly at gaudy untrimmed hedges was a mess. A distinguished mess, sure, but a mess nonetheless—one he didn’t appreciate seeing echoed in his reflection when he could no longer hide from the lies that others believed so easily.
When his mother’s eyes narrowed, he knew she read between the lines, knew she understood that he wasn’t going to cave.
Cunning indeed. He wondered if that was something Sirius picked up from his parents.
“I will love you when they break your heart and you think that the world is ending. I will love you through the awkward stages of puberty and promise not to tease too much. I will love you when you fall in love for real and it makes you feel as if you are flying without a broom. I will love you when you graduate Hogwarts and leave home, even though I will dream of when you were still a baby and not leaving us. I will love you when I have to give you away to someone else, even if they still aren’t good enough for you. I will love you when you experience having your own children and I will love them just as much as I already love you.”
Draco would whisper, warm breath ghosting along his skin before lips would follow suit.
“I always listen to you,” Ron whispered as he took a step back. “I’m always there for you and you should have
Malfoy pressed his mouth against the shell of Harry’s ear as he murmured, “Playing the part.”
“The depressed artist is a stereotype that you don’t have to follow. You deserve to be happy, and your artwork deserves to reflect that.”
“That’s life,” Malfoy tried to grab his drink but missed the first attempt. “I told my father I wanted to run my own business and he put me into business classes for it. My guess is he thought I wanted to do something to better the Malfoy name, or something that would somehow benefit him.”
“That makes two of us.”
“You’ve been doing better,” Harry said in greeting, eyes tracking the very faint colours that the red didn’t drown out. He still didn’t think Draco’s beliefs were any good, but he kind of missed him.
“You don’t.”
When he didn’t reply, Harry propped his chin on Draco’s chest. “Was it that bad?”
The arched brows had long ago merged, and Harry was regarded with a wary look.
“I missed you.”
“Do you have to embarrass me to so many people?”
“What does that mean?” Many ideas popped into his head and each one made his heart race with things he didn’t want to think about, it was too soon.
“That would certainly get us his vote.” But at what cost? There was no way in hell he was going to let Lane continue running the ring. They’d have to double-cross him.
A weak chuckle left Draco and he opened his eyes to see a softness to Harry’s eyes that reminded him of the way Lupin looked at Sirius and he hated that his emotions got to him again as tears formed.
“You know,” Malfoy whispered, eyelashes fluttering, and the shy act was so real it
Before Harry could point out that he too had given their son advice, they saw a boy around Scorpius’ age stop and say something to him. Whatever it was didn’t sit well with their son, if his narrowed eyes were anything to go off.
Malfoy bent over until his face was just inches above Harry’s. “I had given up on thinking you’d come. I’ve been waiting for you.”
“Touch me and you’ll regret it.”
change my sixth year but my fixation on you never did.”
“What a peculiar silver lining,” Draco mused. “Is that why you like that I yelled at you?”
It took embarrassingly long for Harry to realize he meant the museum.
The bitter tinge was palpable, and Draco couldn’t imagine what that would have felt like. They hadn’t exactly been enemies, but to have been saved by someone who tormented you would not have been pleasant.
“That’s life.”
“I think it’s just life. There’s so much we don’t know. I may be ‘good’, but I go through the same emotions as you do. I go through life just the same as any other person. The only difference we ever had between us was what he thought and how we showed ourselves to others. I embraced what you distanced yourself from. But this journal shows change in ways I find admirable.
“I won’t do it!”
“So the second disappearance happened where?”
Green eyes peeked out and he wished it didn’t look so endearing. “You don’t
“Yes, but neither Harry nor I have found any connections. We got the Wizengamot to give us the go ahead to pull all of their records, but Harry wanted to wait until we had something concrete or it would tip them off that we were looking into it.”
Draco might owe Potter an apology, because the stupid one had been himself all along.
The raised eyebrows weren’t something Draco was used to, not after the memories. He had been under the impression that it was hard to surprise him.
“For you or for me?” Harry pushed against Malfoy’s head until their foreheads were pressed together.
“Seamus.”
“I beg to differ.” Ron’s lips were twitching, and Harry figured he could rethink the whole hating bit. “Now is a perfect time.”
“Your fairy.”
“What if I like it like that?”
“I’m sorry,” Potter said, the snort right after making the statement completely unbelievable. “It’s just that, well, who gets together to play Exploding Snap?”
“Fine.” Harry grumbled, giving in. “But we have been at this forever.”
“Tool, wanker, waste of space, knob, bell-end.”
“Goyle,” Narcissa said somewhat unkindly.
“How so?” Humans were weird like that. Cared about silly things like personalities and not about what they could accomplish.
Just as Draco reached them, it seemed that Harry was almost done telling a story.
“Family,” Sirius said slowly, as if trying to digest it.
“Mister Sykes, I have come to you regarding your second job.” If Draco wasn’t set in his lack of emotions, he would have snorted at the fright in the man’s eyes.
Draco frowned before sighing heavily. “The prophet has sent some reporters after me. They are horrid at sleuthing. Caught one of them outside the Manor.”
The Dursleys never loved him, they didn’t even tolerate him.
“I’m going to give you an out. Quit. Abandon Voldemort.”
Harry repeated the image of Voldemort in his mind over and over. It was only a memory so he couldn’t dissect the aura as well as the Dementors but from what he could see the man definitely had power.
The narrowed eyes returned, and Harry had to look away. “Go on.”
“I’ve always known it too,” Draco whispered softly before he pressed a gentle kiss to Harry’s neck.
Strings of Magic moved when they did, moved with each breath. Not just sentient, no, the Magic was greedy.
“I’m sorry I didn’t realize sooner.” The hours spent watching the portrait, the days poring over the journal and the weeks of tracking down leads—it had gotten him nowhere.
“Thank you.”
“Is the Light lord of the man we oppose, fights for justice but is a lord nonetheless. Dumbledore abandoned me too, don’t forget that. A man so righteous, so morally profound but yet he let me be taken without a trial. He was on the Wizengamot and he watched me be chained, watched the guards take me and watched the Dementors flank me. Some Light Wizard, huh.”
“No one owes you a justification,” Draco said, lifting his nose in the air. “I’m not breaking any laws.”
“He’s about this tall.” The hand demonstrating this came close to Potter’s own height. “Blonde hair slicked back with ungodly amounts of hair care product. Grey eyes that are sharp but kind if one knows what to look for. Soft lips that are usually in a sneer but say sweet things when one knows how to listen.”
“Your friends aren’t welcome,” Nott sneered, eyes on Dean, and Harry unsheathed his wand.
“Are you okay? Have you taken any healing potions?” He rummaged through his bags, pulling out spare vials that he had made last week. Severus had instilled the belief that it was wise to always be prepared.
Draco groaned pitifully as he covered his face with his hands. The smell of paint had him flushing, he really needed to start cleaning before he left the studio.
“In case it escaped your notice, Malfoy, but the Ministry has always been corrupt.”
“Why choose then?” Harry asked. “Send the potions to Lion Valley and the rations to Raven Hill. Both sides will think you are their ally when in reality you play both sides.”
Lucius and Draco snorted at the horrified expression on her face as she tutted loudly and shooed them away.
There wasn’t a difference in the level of pain, but Draco trusted Potter enough to know that the stone was in the containment void.
“Hey—”
“Because that’s just how it’s done. It’s a rule.”
“My kind of people.”
“What?” Harry shook his head. “I didn’t know that.”
When he stopped in front of her, he let a few seconds pass to see if she’d change her mind. When she didn’t, he grabbed hold of her neck with his skeletal hand and lifted her off the ground.
It made sense. The pseudonym that Potter worked under made sense. A decade after the war and people still talked about Potter, still made weekly mentions in the papers. If the world knew of his books, Draco knew that no matter the content, it would have spread rapidly—and anyone else might have ridden that, taken and gone, but not Potter and his morality. No, Potter wanted it the right way, and as stupid as Draco still thought it was, he could respect it.
“I don’t know why. You're hot when you’re angry.”
“Why so serious?” It wasn’t like him and it was unnerving.
After all, it wasn’t as if Potter could turn to someone else. There was no one else. There were no other options.
Draco set aside the letter as he wiped his eyes on the back of his hand. He hadn’t expected to see something that personal from the lockbox. Siblings were a territory he didn’t understand, not fully. He wasn’t sure opposites in a war could come in second to a sibling bond.
“Even at the expense of your own?” Harry had to know. “It’s us against them, Draco. And that means you too.”
He ignored the way some people stopped at the sight of him. Most people tended to ignore him, and he liked that—preferred it even. But other times, other times people still regarded him as the boy he had once been. Time doesn’t dim memories, not always, and certainly not when it came to the Malfoy name.
He didn’t get that kiss Potter mentioned, but he did get their foreheads pressed against each other and soft touches to softer smiles.
Dork. Potter was an absolute dork. Draco ignored him completely as he wrapped his arms around Potter’s neck and kissed him roughly. He wasn’t sure if he fully believed in Divination, but the results were undeniable. They were undeniable.
They could do it, right? Enemies fake dating? Surely, that had some precedence.
“But something’s wrong.” It hurt to admit, hurt much more than it did with Blaise. With Blaise it was just another painting, another subject that meant nothing to his friend, but with Potter, it meant
As much as Ron had been right about why Draco had messed up, it wasn’t like Ron could relate, it wasn’t as if Ron
“No,” Harry shook his head. “You
“Both.” Green eyes were large and filled with emotions that had never been directed at Draco by anyone. He wasn’t sure he was comfortable with it.
“And you’d do best to not tell me what to do,” Harry said through narrowed eyes and a clenched jaw.
“Thank you,” Draco sighed gratefully. He licked his lips nervously before continuing. “Do you think that I could get a memory or two of Sirius?”
