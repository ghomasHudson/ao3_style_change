,” he said aloud, hoping that his lamentable household charm would hold. As shards came zooming out of the floor’s crevices, Harry’s attention was caught by what appeared to be a loose floorboard. He reached over and attempted to wrest it back into place, but it was easily knocked askew. Underneath, there was a stack of letters. Harry drew them out of the hole, wrinkling his nose at the strong scent of honeysuckle as he noticed how the space had been charmed to protect the parchment from the elements.
“Have I ever told you how beautiful you are?” Harry asked conversationally, just as he bumped Draco’s prostate.
“Weasley,” Draco said, matching Ron’s tone. Harry could see the struggle it was taking for him to not openly antagonize Ron. He seemed to have made peace with the other Weasleys, but somehow Harry knew that he and Ron would never turn out to be the best of mates. To say the least. “You may proceed.”
Behind him, Draco could feel Hermione trembling. Really, though, he too was expecting the potion to have worked by now.
‘Dromeda continued, “Naturally so, he was belligerent about it, and pulled out his wand, so the pithy clerk pulled out his as well, and they stood there hexing and jinxing each other in front of everyone for 15 minutes before Ministry officials arrived on scene. They took Zabini away.
Draco roused from his slumber, focusing on his friends. "Do you want us to give you a minute?" Harry asked, trying to be thoughtful. Draco nodded.
Suddenly very nervous, Draco nodded yes and then Potter gently put a hand on his shoulder, stepping very close so that they were only scant inches apart. Draco thought to remove Potter’s glasses and then tilted his face downwards an inch or so, as Potter was just a little shorter. Just as Draco thought they would never touch, Potter leaned so close that his lips nearly touched Draco’s. Instead, he felt a light rustling on his eyelashes, and thought it would be prudent to at least move his a little bit so that Potter didn’t think he was standing there fantasizing.
“Merlin,” Harry cursed. “Why the hell would they put the damn plant right where people are coming in?” He kicked the planter and wrenched it back into place, ignoring the amused-yet-curious gaze of passersby.
.” Draco enunciated his words carefully, letting Potter see his silent rage. He effectively ended the conversation by slamming the shower door shut.
“We were outside the greenhouses replanting some of Professor Sprout’s Fanged Geraniums,” said Hermione, as usual more collected and logical than Ron. “And Malfoy came over to dump some fresh dungeon dirt off for us. Ron said—of course, he should have left well enough alone, but that doesn’t justify Malfoy’s response—"
“Draco,” Harry breathed as he nipped behind his ear again, practically causing Draco to melt. Now he was gripping Draco’s bum, squeezing and teasing in a way that made Draco want to beg him to inch his fingers just a little further down.
There came a push that was ever-so-slightly harder which caused Draco to involuntarily yelp in pain, even as he immediately cursed himself for making noise. A split second hadn’t even passed before Harry was pulling out, turning horrified eyes onto Draco.
Before answering, Harry snags a mostly full beer off a neighboring table and chugs it. Ron raises his eyebrows, but otherwise says nothing because the injured party is too busy sticking his tongue down the throat of a lady ten years his junior.
Harry smiled. He didn’t think he’d ever cease to be amused either by Draco’s endless supply of sass. Curled up just the way they were before, he drifted off into a peaceful sleep, ecstatic to have the man he loved by his side.
That’s how Draco woke up--a very loud call of “love, where are you?” and blinding light shining in his eyes. Moaning, he pulled the cover over his head and dislodged Hermione in the process. “Make it stop,” he groused.
Malfoy’s face twisted. “Now, now, Potter,” he said slowly, “Try not to think so hard. It’s difficult to make assumptions about things you know
“Yup,” said Harry. He reached into the pockets and found that the gloves he’d put there over a year ago were in fact still there. As they walked out the door and down to the sidewalk, he slid them on, feeling like he was home for the first time in nearly a year.
There is no way to follow him off the dance floor without looking like a desperate fool, so Harry starts moving toward the bathrooms. On the way, he is intercepted by a tall brunet with a kind face.
When he looked up, Hermione was facing away from him with her head down, silently wiping away tears. “I’d, I’d just,” she said, her voice breaking, “Always held out hope, you know? When I couldn’t reverse the spell, I assumed it was temporary. Even the staff at St. Mungo’s said that they should slowly regain their memories in time. But it’s been nearly two years, and there’s no progress. I think I have to accept that my parents are never going to remember—” she choked on her words, dissolving into quiet sobs.
Instead, Draco was drawn to the back wall of the shop, where several displays of somber flowers had been arranged. He walked right up to a stark arrangement of white lilies and roses. Leaning forward, Draco cupped the bottom of one of the lilies and deeply inhaled the sweet, fragrant scent. Immediately, in that one moment, he was all the funerals he’s ever attended, breathing in the aromatic smell that comes after a death.
It was cold and dreary, but he summoned up the fortitude to go out there anyway, bundled up in a coarse black coat buttoned all the way up to his throat. The lavender plants, so bountiful and productive in the summer, were faded and discolored in the winter, receding to the smallest amount of space they could possibly occupy. They were like a living metaphor for his heart, Draco thought miserably as he walked down the neat rows cast by the undergrowth.
Becky Lou let out a loud guffaw, and Nate rounded on her. “Hey! I know you all are tired, after four days of driving, but come on now.” She gave Nate a mock injured look, and he sighed. “They’re a rowdy lot. But you’ll mostly be working with Harry; his manners are usually okay.” He gestured towards the grumpy man who was just pulling off his head gear. “The rest of you, go ahead and introduce yourselves.”
“I know,” Hermione said. “That doesn’t make me regret it any less. Maybe he could have turned things around sooner if I’d had some faith in him. In us.”
He could feel himself blushing and quickly strove to rectify the situation before Harry could become too pleased with himself.
“Please, Potter,” Draco scoffed, the snark coming naturally. “I’ll match you drink for drink and still come out on top.”
Slipping into the hallway, they stumbled away from the party, discarding costume props and giggling all the while.
The campers’ bedtime couldn’t come quickly enough. He offered each one in his group the option of a hug or high five and heaved a sigh of relief when they were all successfully tucked into their beds. He was physically and mentally exhausted, just as he was every day at camp. For Draco, each week easily felt like an entire year.
Thankfully, Potter took the lead with introductions, making marks on their roster as each girl said her name. There was no way he was going to remember all of these names. Just joining the baseball team had been taxing enough for Draco; he could recall faces quite easily but names never seemed to stick, no matter what mnemonics he tried.
Naturally, they had just reached the part where Draco had to sing, “A hula hula hu,” and make hula motions with his hips when the two groups joined and became one. Even as Potter’s campers eagerly echoed the song, joining in, back, Draco could see Potter smirking (even though he tactfully turned his head).
He walked down the bustling, cheery streets of Diagon Alley, dodging several teenage girls and heading for the corner market that sold top quality goods at a fair price.
“I’ll find something to do to amuse myself,” Harry intones, settling down to read Draco’s letter again.
“I’m not made of glass, Potter, I’m sure I can manage a short Apparation without supervision.” Malfoy’s words somehow lacked the usual sneer and bite.
Draco lay back on the couch and crossed his arms behind his head. Even though things were changing, change could be good. And there would be other sets of moments, both big and small, that made life worth living. He fell asleep to that comforting thought and slept soundly through the night until he was awoken late the next morning by Hermione’s excited shrieks.
Looking over to where she gestured, Harry definitely caught sight of Draco for a split second before he bolted out of the clearing and down the path towards the Forest.
Draco hadn’t yet made a decision when he retired to his rooms later that evening. He put on his fanciest set of robes, choosing to meet Death in style, and combed his hair before settling himself on his bed and pulling out the vial of potion. It was viscous and murky, making Draco think of the War and the darkness he’d never been able to leave behind.
Draco put out his hand, and Potter took it. Together, they left Granger and the Weasel standing on the cobblestone in Diagon Alley; the Weasel with red blotches all over his face and Granger with tear streaks on hers.
“Until then,” Harry returns, sneaking one more look at his beautiful boyfriend. Before he ends up in Draco's arms again, he Apparates away.
, not Draco, and no he should not just assume they’d be willing to sponsor Draco’s education as well just because the Saviour requested it. He also had to remind Harry that he was still bound by his reparations stipulated by the Ministry, and he was required to graduate from Hogwarts.
Potter understands as Draco wiggles beneath him, gently pulling out and cleaning them up with a quick wandless spell. By silent confirmation, both start dressing, and disappointedly Draco expects for Potter to say goodnight and head back into the direction of his cabin. Instead, Potter spreads out the wrinkles in the sleeping bag, conjuring up blankets and pillows for two.
“Professor!” he called, jogging down the corridor to catch up with her. She fixed him with a markedly unconcerned expression, though Harry was completely sure she knew what he was about to ask. “Why did you room me and Draco separately? And of all people, why place me with Ron?”
Still breathing faster than normal, Dawlish said, “It’s not always about getting the bad guy immediately.
After a minute, Draco looked back at Jake and saw him wearing a look of smug satisfaction, probably because he had pleased Draco so well. Inwardly, he frowned. That simply wouldn’t do. Jake still hadn’t come yet, and Draco knew it would be selfish to quite literally stiff him, so he obliged Jake as he leaned forward again and put both hands on Draco’s cheeks to kiss him intimately. After a good thirty seconds of this, Draco started to fervently wish that Jake would just come already, and so he grabbed Jake around the back again and started moving their bodies together roughly once more.
“I could never turn down a free glass of wine,” said Mr. Granger. He rubbed his hands together excitedly. “You know what, let me get my wife. She’ll want to get in on this too.”
Molly Weasley’s voice echoed throughout the Great Hall, filling Draco with a keen sense of dread. He’d only just managed to feel close again to Harry, and naturally, something would have to interfere with his confidence in their relationship. And surely, he thought savagely, she was about to be responsible for his hearing loss.
The Graduate Committee of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has reviewed your application for Teaching Associate for Potions 100. The Committee was very impressed with your application, but unfortunately only a limited number of positions are available. I have accepted the Committee’s recommendation, and I write to let you know that you will be appointed as an
They simultaneously moved toward the bed, tightly holding hands. Draco quickly disrobed, folding his clothes neatly and placing them on the wardrobe.
, restoring both ceramics to their former condition. “And I’m not sure we were thinking,” he chuckled half-heartedly, spinning around in his chair. “Sure, the London boards suck more than the American ones, but we’d have probably been able to advance quickly since we’re, you know, the Chosen One and his best mate.”
Blushing, Harry realizes just how stimulating the short dance had been. His trousers are bulging from the hardness of his cock, and he desperately wants the adorable man to come back and incorporate a lap dance into the act. Unfortunately, the dancers rotate, and another scantily dressed man comes near their table. The song switches to a hot and heavy beat, and the dancers all whip back their trench coats to reveal bright red thongs. He can’t help seeking out his dancer and examining the man’s package, which is quite nice.
Draco ate lunch alone—the Hogwarts house elves had prepared a simple but hearty meal for everyone involved with the renovations—and hoped for the rest of the afternoon to go smoothly. He decided to join Lovegood in repairing the structural damage to the Ravenclaw Tower, but halfway through she went away to take a break, declaring that the Wrackspurts were bothering her. Draco didn’t mind working alone. In fact, it was almost relaxing, strengthening what was left of the tower’s foundation, and creating new scaffolding as necessary along the way.
“I think about her all the time,” Ron said, making room at the table for food being delivered by the waitress. The fries were salty and the burgers were juicy, so there was silence for a few minutes as they bit in, tasting everything. “You obviously want him back, so what are you going to do about it?”
Nobody was around, thankfully, when his tears started falling. Draco pressed his face into his arms to muffle the sound of sobbing, hoping that giving in would allow to get it out of his system sooner, but he couldn’t feel any signs of his sadness stopping, especially as he sank into the hole of despair that was his past.
“Yes sir,” Ron said, retiring to his own office chair, which was across from Harry’s. “We understand.” Harry ignored the concerned glances that Ron sent him, fury coursing through every part of his body.
“About time you asked, bloody wanker,” said Cale, slapping Harry on the butt with his mitt. He bent to pick up a spare baseball before slipping out onto the field.
off of the mound to release the ball in a way he hadn’t thought possible before this very moment. The motion was a powerful one, and for the first time in a long time, Draco felt strong.
“Malfoy!” Draco was torn out of his reverie by the unit director, Ernie Macmillan, or as he was known at camp, Kidney. “You’re not getting paid to stand around and bask in the sun. Get a shovel and make yourself useful.” Unlike Potter, who helped out the rest of the counselors on the different tasks even though he was a unit director, Macmillan preferred to order everyone else about to reinforce his sense of superiority.
Jake gave him a hopeful look, perhaps entertaining fantasies that Draco might be persuaded yet, and Draco was forced to continue with his explanation. “I knew you wanted to date me, but I was completely unaware of the depths of your feelings for me. If I knew that you cared for me so, I never would have allowed anything physical to happen. Ever.”
“I’ve wanted to talk to you since day one,” said Potter genuinely. “This is the first time we’ve been in the same living unit, but I could never find a good time to approach you. After your talk with Beans, though, I could see you weren’t quite right, so –”
“There’s nothing to forgive,” Draco said, making small motions with his legs to make Jake realize he should get off now.
Harry sighed, clapping a hand down on Draco’s shoulder. “Right. But it’s only for one more year, at least,” he said.
He was on the Ilvermorny Quidditch Pitch with Ron and a few other guys from school; they’d been playing competitively until the urge to sleep rendered him groggy and slow. Harry had been unable to sleep properly without Draco in his bed, warming him inside and out; the warm sun even seemed a poor substitute for his ex-boyfriend’s comforting presence.
Harry took a deep breath in a clear effort to calm himself. “We can still fix this, Draco. Please. Just come to the States and do your Mastery—"
“I seem to recall someone being quite fond of that table just the other day, given how well it ‘matched the color scheme of the room’.”
“You’re right about that,” Draco snorted, giving Harry a little shove. “I probably would have murdered you in your sleep.”
“Perhaps you could make more use of us in the field,” Harry said. He’d meant for it to come off as a light comment, but there was an edge to his voice that wouldn’t be softened. “We’re wasting away in here when the second-classes could easily handle the department paperwork.”
“Here’s the thing,” he spat, thrusting his pointer finger into Zee’s chest. “I don’t give a flying fuck about what you think, so you better not even
“Let’s just get the video camera out first,” Malfoy replied, digging in his pocket for his phone. “I’ll want to have this one hand the next time one of you tossers makes fun of me after practice.”
“Immobulus!” shouted the short one, and Draco had to stop struggling as the charm instantly froze him solid. Now he was just hanging there, floating back and forth in the breeze, as the four Hufflepuffs laughed at him; at least it took the pressure off his arms. More students rapidly approached, having heard raised voices and sinister expressions of mirth. Draco could only hope that one of them was merciful.
“It was despicable of me, I know,” she snorted, half-laughing and half-crying as another tear streamed down her face. “But I had to know what you were getting yourself into.”
“Definitely a strong Americano,” Harry answered. He already knew Ron’s order by heart, what with the number of times they grabbed coffee for one another during stakeouts.
“You might say I’ve decided to take on a little extra responsibility,” Harry said, grasping the paper crane Draco had returned.
Draco was wringing his hands as though wishing his rubber gloves were still there. “Do you think I have time?”
“I haven’t even met this bloke and you already said yes to him?” Draco flung his shawl across the couch and turned to stare at Hermione.
He gives it some honest thought. “No,” he finally determines. “Sure I’d be a bit distraught, but I am anyway. Draco just makes me feel like I’m not alone. It helps to be able to share my experience with someone who’s also been sexually assaulted.”
From the way Draco uses the hand not holding together his towel to rub his temples, Harry guesses something is wrong. But he says, “Shouldn’t be anything to worry about.”
Harry could tell Draco wanted more details about what they’d be wearing, but the Professor walked in and immediately started the lecture. Luna had to stay until the practical part of the lesson, when she could slip out unnoticed. Savagely, Harry was glad for her inconvenience, even though he knew she was only trying to do them a favor.
Draco and Potter had gone to feel the fluffy orange mane at the same time, brushing their fingers in the process. Smiling, Potter gently picked up Draco’s frozen fingers and trailed them through the soft fur. “See, Malfoy? A perfect animal.”
“Harry, dear!” exclaimed Mrs. Weasley. She too stepped out onto the stoop, pulling Harry against her bosom in a tight hug. “So good to see you. You do quite look like you could do with a good meal. Why don’t you come inside and have some brunch?”
Cowed, Zee turned to leave the field, but Nate blocked his path. “If you want to be on this team,” he thundered, “You need to have
“You know, Malfoy,” Potter said, sounding very far away to Draco’s hazy mind, “I’m really glad we did this.”
Harry said he’d decline the offer, if it meant he’d have to leave Draco behind. On the third day after they’d had the conversation, Draco watched as he, very sadly, sat down to write a declination letter. It was worse than ripping out his own heart, but Draco found it in himself to tear up Harry’s letter and tell him to go. He wouldn’t have been able to live with the guilt otherwise. Also, there was the small fact that Harry would have resented him for the rest of their lives.
“Oh, I feel like I should tell you that I don’t use hangover potions the morning after,” Potter smirked.
“Hermione, sweetheart?” said Mrs. Granger. “Why are you selling us wine on the front porch? And what is that boy you hate doing here?”
With Draco’s arms around his neck, legs crossed around his back, Harry gently slid inside. He only made it in an inch or so before Draco completely tensed up, unconsciously squeezing the hell out of his neck and hips.
“You’re the best, Hermione,” Harry said, jumping to his feet. “Hey, can you take my bag back to the castle when you head in?” He raced over to where he’d dropped his robe and shoes to furiously start putting them on. “By the way, there’s a present for you in there. Draco can tell you more about it if you’re curious.”
The rest of the afternoon crept by. Predictably, Draco was interrogated by Father, but he was too wound up from his encounter with Potter earlier and the thought of what he was going to do that evening to really pay much attention to the threats. He spent the day drinking tea and walking the Manor grounds, debating whether or not he wanted to pass on or remain behind as a ghost. The countryside was beautiful this time of year and it tempted him sorely.
. I became much keener on the idea of Muggle technology after I learned what a bloody nuisance it is to have to do everything without magic. Sometimes I can dream about the feeling of my wand; I dream about doing magic, but then I wake up and everything is as a bleak and colorless as I remember the world to be.
how America was supposed to look. Unsure what to do, Draco continued to walk until he reached a smaller lane with little rectangles that resembled the street. He stood there running his hand through his hair until a red wheeled box, a vehicle –a
He led Draco out to the counter before disappearing in the back again, and the clerk gave Draco a handout on aftercare and a bag of sea salt before explaining cleaning procedures. Draco paid, tipped, and left. It hadn’t taken more than twenty minutes overall.
“Even so,” sighed Potter, “The responsibility is on me to finish the project. Everyone sees me as their Savior, and they want me to put the world back together. I have to at least try, even if it's a daunting task."
“When you’re able to cruise down the baseline without a problem,” said Malfoy breezily. “You’ll thank us.” He paused for a moment, studying the tired girls. “What do you say, Potter? Should we let them go home?”
“Why hasn’t it come to that, though? Seriously, I don’t know how you’ve gone so long without it. Like, none of us could really fool around before because of the War, but now I would never be celibate.”
“Georgie,” said a dark haired girl with bangs. She was lithe and looked fast; perfect as the other middle infielder.
“It’s fine, it’s fine!” barks Ron impatiently. “So can you go out with him tomorrow night or not? You know that he’s going to try and get you to hook up with someone.”
Spearing a bite of the un-buttered pancake to cover his embarrassment, Draco concentrated on chewing so he didn’t have to provide an answer.
“Hold your damn tongue, Potter!” Schrader snapped. “I’ll still write you up, even if the Commander overturns every complaint I make about your conduct.” He heavily drew breath, wiping forehead perspiration away with a pocket-handkerchief. “For the last time, I give the orders, and you follow them. Anything less is insubordination. If you keep pulling this shit, I’ll get you and Weasley reassigned from Secretarial to Janitorial. Try me.”
“As long as he doesn’t try to pull a fast one on you, mate. Are you sure that he's not cheating on you?”
The kitchen was spotless, save for the ham and bread in the middle of the floor. “I’ll get that,” Harry said, reaching for his wand.
“Yes,” he said determinedly, deciding that it was safe to accept the hug Potter was currently trying to initiate. “There is one more thing I’m still curious about,” Draco admitted, purposely trying to tickle
Draco was thrilled to be working with the grumpy man even though he experienced a touch of unease with the name Harry, as it just brought back too many memories. He specialized in grumpy though, so it wouldn’t be too much of challenge for him to be a superior grump to the man with the delectable ass. He admitted to himself that he would rather that the man be nice so Draco could get to know him and convince him to let Draco fondle those perky ass cheeks.
He opened the one from Australia first, informing Hermione of her acceptance upon unfolding the parchment. She nodded briskly—like him, her top school was in France. Hermione was also accepted into two schools in Brazil, and one in the Caribbean.
Harry opened his mouth to make another snappy retort, but Ron quickly stuffed his fingers in his ears and shouted, “I’m not listening!”
It’s over too soon. I regretfully pull away from him, returning the smile he’s giving me with his eyes and his mouth. I kiss him again, just to make sure I can, and, to my delight, he kisses me back.
Though his relationship with Potter had been tumultuous, at best, Draco felt a wavering pang of guilt. He walked over to Potter and gently folded him into a reverse hug, nuzzling into the tender skin of Potter’s ear.
He sighed, carding his fingers through his hair. “There’s more than a little complacency in our program, to be sure, but we’re not at the only institution, remember. Beijing was more focused on Medical Potionry.”
Draco chuckled and finally held him, blinking back tears. Harry smiled into his hair, and whispered, completely on impulse, “I love you.” Immediately, Draco’s entire body stiffened. He drew back away and quickly wiped away the tears still welling in his eyes.
“Yeah, mate,” said the Weasel, “George is going to give all his free samples away before we get there.”
“McGonagall was your Head of House,” said Draco, shrugging. “What do you think our chances are of getting her to agree?”
Draco looked back to Otarres, who had been watching Draco take in his office. “It’s a great big mess, huh? I meant to clean it up at the beginning of this week, but then I gave your class a writing exercise and then
Harry blinked back into the present moment, wrenching himself off the hot bench and back onto his broom. They were just screwing around now, doing drills; Harry and Ron had already smashed the others to pieces earlier, and the others hadn’t quite recovered from their defeat. The Snitch twinkled far away at the other end of the Pitch, and he zoomed after it, ignoring the sleep dust that had gathered at the corner of his eyes.
Draco slowly shook his head. Potter was endearingly cute even when he was being impossible. He decided to change the subject. “Did you see the lions, Potter? Those would be more suited to your Gryffindor sensibilities.”
“I get that you need something else to fix, Potter, but it’s not about to be me. I’m not a charity case.” Immediately after the words came out of his mouth, Draco regretted them.
Lucius bristled. “My son is no fool; surely he would know the man he went to boarding school with for six years!”
“Hmm,” said the Weasley, placing a thoughtful hand on his chin. “I have the asphodel here, but I’ll have to brew up the Draught. Shouldn’t take more than a couple hours, if you want to hang around Diagon and come back.”
Finally, it is time to meet Seamus. Harry washes his face and put on a nice pair of black trousers and a steel gray shirt, relieved that his hair had managed to somewhat calm down in the past year. Slipping his wand into his back pocket, even though he’d heard a thousand times from Mrs. Weasley and Hermione both not to do that, he Apparates to the corner of Prichett and 4
Walking into the living room, Harry yawns. “What are you doing up this early?” He asks sleepily, rumpling his hair.
Teabags added, Hermione brought the tea cups back over to the table and set one in front of Draco. “You’re not going to sleep with him, are you?”
“Alright, Bucks! Time to take the field!” Nate shouted, jogging towards first base. There was a lot of hand claps and ass slaps, and everyone eventually made it to their designated position.
When they finally sat down on the bleachers, bleary even in the cool air, Harry could already feel that it was going to be an unpleasant next few hours. “Team!” Nate bellowed, startling Zee out of his early morning stupor. “This is it! Our second to last practice before you become coaches means I need you at the top of your game
Malfoy seemed satisfied. He walked towards Harry, who stiffened, before gracefully lowering himself down and leaning against the tree next to Harry’s. “Sit, Potter.”
“Wonderful,” Draco said, already trying hard to remember their names. “Honestly, I might have to have you lot wear nametags.”
"Apology accepted," said Granger brusquely. There was another pause, and then she continued, “Let’s grab ingredients, then.”
Draco lubed up before hoisting up his legs and softly pushing the toy into the rolling pucker of his arse, taking deep, measured breaths to avoid accidentally clenching a sphincter and causing unnecessary pain. There was a time and place for everything, but pain play was going to have to wait for another day.
“Let’s get out of here,” Potter said, chucking baseballs toward the bucket. “We’ve only got a bit to get ready, and somehow I feel like you’re gonna take forever.”
, Draco did actually feel a lot more intimate with the dark haired man. Maybe open and honest conversations had some merit after all. Anyway, Draco knew exactly how terrible Potter had been at Legilimency and Occlumency. If he didn’t tell Potter how he felt or what he needed, he'd probably never figure it out on his own.
“Even so,” replied Nate. “Today’s going to be productive regardless. Everyone take your positions and let’s get this practice over with.”
“Ron,” says Harry, glaring at his oldest friend, “Just because I don’t date doesn’t mean I’m fragile or need taken care of. Might I remind you it was your sister who I lost –”
“Er, is this seat taken?” Draco wearily opened his eyes to find Harry Potter awkwardly staring at him, gesturing towards the other half of the bench. What was there even to say?
He can’t focus; there’s too much light, all around him it’s too bright and it’s impossible to breathe.
“Sorry,” Draco whispered back, pulling Harry in for another kiss. “I couldn’t sleep, and then Hermione came over about quarter-past one, and I couldn’t very well throw her out, could I?” He smiled, letting Harry know he was fine with what had happened.
It came more naturally to him than it should have. Of course, all the spills he’d taken on the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch had been excellent preparation. Harry executed an textbook slide, bending his left knee and stretching out with his right foot as long as he possibly could, but the ball was already flying through the air. The second baseman straddled the bag in preparation, glove in place to catch the ball, and easily swing his arm down to tag Harry out. And that’s just how it happened. He really thought he’d gotten there first, but rest of the team resoundingly declared him “Out!”
Potter sighed contentedly. “There’s just one more question left to ask,” he said wisely. “Do you want to travel by plane or boat then?” Draco’s expression of sheer horror was enough to sustain Potter’s mischievousness throughout the rest of the afternoon.
The man was yawning – and he was also a Weasley – so Draco didn’t take it personally when he wasn’t immediately greeted upon walking into the shop.
“No, come on, Malfoy,” said Potter, jumping to his feet and yanking on Draco’s hand. “I can’t say I saw the butterfly garden but not the butterflies because my lazy tour guide decided to take a nap.”
Potter steadied himself and returned the shove to Draco, who leaned into it playfully. “I work hard, Malfoy, so what? Even you’re starting to see the merits of good backbreaking labor these days.”
He stops walking before reaching out and grabbing Draco’s arm. “Draco,” Harry whispers, “I don’t think it’s possible for you to pester me anymore.”
“I would,” Draco said. "I would also like to sincerely apologize for the way I've treated you all these years. I appreciate your giving me another chance."
Nonverbally, Potter conjured lube, which was quite impressive; Draco could only do the most basic of nonverbal spells. Immediately, Potter turned his attentions to Draco’s bottom, making sure to lather on some of the substance as to smooth the way. Only once Draco was taken care of did Harry slick himself.
Draco and Hermione establish a working relationship; Harry receives an invitation to brunch at the Burrow.
” and he’s drawn back to his first duel, the one with Draco Malfoy. Malfoy’s face gets stuck in his head, and suddenly it’s impossible to see anything but. Deciding a glass of water will help clear his thoughts, he heads towards the kitchen. There are other students running down the hallway, older ones. He briefly thinks about how they’re breaking Club protocol by putting others in danger, but doesn’t have time to react before one calls out “
Harry’s stomach clenched; as much as he didn’t want to talk about his momentary lapse of faith in Draco, it sure came up enough. The waitress came over to refill their water glasses, so he contented himself with a glare, and when she finally left, he hissed, “I told you. I fucked up, remember?”
“Why’s it too much to ask of you?” Hermione asked, looking angry for the first time that night. “He came out here to visit you. He’s in love with you. Why wouldn’t you forgive him? You can work around the STI, if it is really incurable.”
“I’ve been better, thanks,” returns Malfoy, deathly polite. “I believe I owe you an apology, Granger. I am incredibly sorry for the cruel things that I said and did to you back at Hogwarts.”
Draco sulked. “Yeah, like you’ve never sang a camp song since you’ve been here, Potter. I know for a fact that your favorite’s ‘Black Socks’. Probably has something to do with your severe lack of personal hygiene.”
“Er—” said Harry, once again taken by surprise at the Professor’s candor. “I appreciate your efforts, Professor,” he said.
Ron’s freckles really stood out in the sun. Hermione had never really noticed how vibrant they were, not before she’d left London.
Nodding once, Draco mentally listed the steps he’d have to complete and chose to start with the asphodel—the most difficult of his six—first. They worked together in silence, Granger efficiently quartering the beetle’s eyes while Draco chopped, diced, and crushed the roots and seeds. Draco had always been an expert at Potions; but then again, so had Granger. Their ingredients were prepared in record time.
“How about a compromise, then?” Malfoy’s posh voice sounded a lot better over the phone than it did in person, and Harry could almost find himself feeling just a little bit better about the situation. Malfoy was strangely reassuring when he wasn’t being a doucher (a new vocab word Harry learned  after Cale cut off a college-aged girl in traffic).
“Of course, how could we ever let ‘Draco’s’ good deed go unpunished?” mocks Ron, nearly dry-heaving into his arm. “What am I missing here?” Ron groans. “Don’t answer that –”
to apply anywhere after the six months were up and he could return to Draco at that time. They’d only just about had their six-month anniversary and now they would be separated for the following six months. Either life was unfair or it came with the territory when dating the Saviour.
“We’ll deal with that when the time comes,” Hermione promised, sparing a half a second to pat Harry’s arm.
Somewhere in the distance he could hear Dawlish crying “Harry! Slow down!” as he attempted to catch up with his trainee. Subconsciously, Harry wondered if he wasn’t trying to catch Avery while outrunning Dawlish and leaving him behind forever.
“Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said. “Were you listening when I addressed the other eighth years about room arrangements? I very clearly stated that couples of any nature would not be permitted to room together.”
He moved his head a fraction of an inch away from Malfoy’s mouth and thought it might be safe to make eye contact again. Malfoy’s eyes were concentrated in thought and emotion; Harry could only guess at what he was thinking and feeling.
Potions class. So Draco dragged himself into the shower after yet another round of incredibly hot sex with Harry. He hadn’t wanted to heal himself after their lovemaking, but found that it was going to be extremely awkward if everyone asked why he was moving so gingerly.
He waited impatiently with arms folded, tapping his foot. Eventually, she slid back out of the flames. Her face had an expression of dismay, and Draco knew that couldn’t be good.
“With some coaching, I think he could be really good,” Harry continued defensively, shrugging his shoulders.
“Oi, Connell, you arsehole!” hollered Ron, the Quaffle bouncing off of the back of his shoulder. “I wasn’t looking!”
was almost worse than him rehashing the past. Why did he think in the first place that this relationship would endure,
At this, Malfoy smiled. “No, I definitely wouldn’t leave you alone for that, Potter. Who knows what those girls would do to you while I was away?”
Trust Malfoy to over-exaggerate, but Harry was actually pretty hungry. “I could eat,” he shrugged, admiring one of Cecelia’s afghans that was slung over the back of the rocking chair Malfoy’d been sitting in.
Potter met the Weasel and Granger head on. “He’s here because I fucked up and promised that I'd spend the morning with both of you."
“You and Harry both have a rough road ahead, I’m afraid,” said Mrs. Weasley softly. “But it’s nothing I’m sure you can’t handle. Not after everything else you’ve gone through, and when you were just boys at that.”
Speaking of Potter, Draco was absolutely not very fond of him in this moment of time. Sure, he was about to get thrown off of the team, and yes, that was a major bummer, but trust Potter to go and volunteer him for the shark tank. Draco had no problem with Potter volunteering
“Forget an extra piece, I’m having the whole roll,” Harry declared. “Though how can the photoshoot be worse than the interview?”
Before he can fully sate his desire to stare all night, the man starts dancing and Harry is lost in the sensations overcoming his body. He was made to dance, this blonde, and everyone in the room knows it.
Predicting that Harry would want to graduate with full NEWTs, the American DMLE offered to fund private tutoring and coursework at Ilvermorny so that he could prepare for the tests and take them at the end of the semester. When Harry wasn’t studying, he would be training with the top class of newly admitted Auror recruits.
“How’re you liking the desk job?” asked Dawlish, crossing his legs and turning a pencil upside down in his hands.
Draco gave him a withering glare before jogging over to shortstop and getting into ready position. He absolutely didn’t want to let the team down to the point where they started wishing Zee was back on the team.
it too. Into wheelbarrows. Which meant that it would eventually have to be dumped somewhere, and he supposed that was their responsibility too. Malfoys did not lower themselves so far as to deal with –by hand– the feces of another species. Especially one as repulsive as horses. Though forever cautious around hippogriffs, Draco had developed great appreciation for thestrals, having seen more than enough death to reveal their existence to him. But horses were skittish and uncultured, not to mention
“Well,” Hermione said hesitantly. “We’re ready to take it to the next level, you see, as he’s already proposed—”
were far more varied. He’d tried a set schedule like his friends, but soon realized that the member base would only show up on the days he was there.
George blew a loud raspberry. “Sorry,” he said, without a trace of remorse. “Just was providing the comic relief as always.”
He gave it, and without further ado Potter slid Draco’s pants off with one slick motion and gently laved at Draco’s cock, teasing around the head and licking down the shaft. By now, Draco was absolutely quivering with pleasure, feeling like Potter was doing a very fine job even if neither had nothing to compare the experience to.
“Deal,” said Malfoy, smiling again. “But don’t think you’re going just take me out for fish and chips, Potter. I want a nice lunch, with the best champag–”
“Throwing mudcakes, Malfoy?” he crows gleefully, Vanishing the lot with his wand while Draco extracts himself from the creek, muttering darkly under his breath all the while. “Do you want me to clean you up?”
His dance moves had improved since the Yule Ball, but he was initially quite concerned about dancing with Malfoy. Surely he’d had posh dancing lessons as a boy?
A moment later, Potter had picked Draco’s bottom off of the ground and tilted him back, exposing him to the world. With a shock of understanding, Draco realized what was coming next as Potter leaned down and gently licked his furled hole. He gasped loudly into the night as Potter chuckled from underneath him. Sure his legs were shaking now, Draco tried to relax as Potter bent back down and flicked his tongue around the edge of his rim, nudging in just the slightest little bit.
“We’re both okay with you too, Malfoy – Ron and I – if you can help Harry. Also, the apologies go a long way.”
Harry was determined to get through his exam and start Auror training full time. Maybe if he had some sense of purpose, if he could find a
as he settled back and magically directed the dildo to move inside of his body. Draco wasn’t able to free himself from imagining Potter’s luminous green eyes looking straight into his soul as they made love, Potter’s cock filling him to the point where it drove everything else out of his head but Potter and warmth.
“Of course not,” Seamus laughs. “I swear, Harry, you’ve got to lower those standards a bit. There hasn’t been one man in three years you’ve found suitable. Merlin, if they have a hot arse, go for it.”
Last of all, Draco showed Potter his favorite spot in the Manor, the butterfly garden. Mother had decorated it especially to her taste, taking Draco’s views into consideration as well as he got older and spent more time there with her. There were tall grasses surrounding the weaving, brick path, with magic lights overhead and benches placed at the most scenic areas. Mother planted the sweet pink, red, and white roses when Draco was little, but each year after that they would together introduce a new type of flower into the garden and nurture it so that it would return again each year. Last year, they’d planted tulips, and this year, lily of the valley.
Draco sighed. She wasn’t making this easy on him, but then again, she never did. “And how would these beliefs of yours have any effect on my current position in society?”
“The situation is different,” Draco said, “Because, as I stated, he’s still an insufferable prick. How has someone who’s betrayed my trust and contaminated himself in the process changed at all for the better?”
Draco let himself cry freely for the first time that night, and Harry took his letting go as cue to move in and gently stroke Draco’s back. “You’re allowed to be mad,” he said firmly. “I think I’m mad enough for you right now, but yeah, you’re allowed to be mad.”
As Mr. Granger exited, Hermione smacked him. “‘An excellent wine can bring so much to the table,’” she mocked. “These are my
The massage was stopped as Potter’s arms draped over Draco’s shoulders and hugged him from behind. Unconsciously, Draco leaned back into Potter, tucking his head in the nape of Potter’s neck. They stayed like that for longer than appropriate, and then Potter laughed to ease the tension.
Draco chucks them over before walking over to the pile of sticks and extracting two that would be especially suited for roasting marshmallows. “Are you going to light my fire, Potter, or just sit there staring at the embers?”
“Draco,” Harry whispered, gently running his fingers down Draco’s cheek and over his chin. “I don’t care that you were a Death Eater.”
We end up standing there together, hand in hand, watching the show. Even though we don’t have wands and I haven’t learned to do wandless magic yet, this moment is magical.
“I’m ready for you now,” Draco said, seductively swaying his way back up Harry’s body. Harry inhaled at the sight of his beauty; blonde hair mussed from Harry’s own hands, lips red and puffy from Harry’s cock, and his own cock so, so hard from being turned on by Harry…
“Jeez, Malfoy, that’s pretty deep,” he whispered while trying not to think of how the poor boy could possibly overcome his experience.
,” said Ron, taking care of the rest of the dirt on Harry’s shirt before straightening his collar. “No pressure, but we’ve got to stay focused until June. Maybe even until August for good measure, you know? We can’t fuck up this promotion.”
They trudged over to the bleachers wearily in the afternoon sun, Harry feeling his headache start to return. José was brave enough to pull out his cell phone, and Nate snatched it out of his hand almost as fast as a Summoning Charm.
Silence. And this was the man that insisted cranberry-orange mimosas were the only way to a perfect morning.
THUMP. He choked, narrowly avoiding biting down as they both jumped in fear and surprise. “What the absolute
There was another rather awkward silence. “The media interference will not happen again,” McGonagall said firmly. “Our new head of communications decided to take certain, shall we say,
the Dark Lord. I conspired with the Dark Lord and his army to turn Hogwarts into a battleground, where you watched your friends and family die.”
He needn’t have worried. Draco is a natural, somehow putting his students at ease even with his flawlessly cool demeanor and brisk perfectionism. Switching between group breakout sessions, demonstrations, and choosing brave soul volunteers, Draco leads the class through a set of wand techniques Harry’s quite sure he hasn’t seen before. One aficionado sees fit to question Draco’s knowledge, and Harry expects a Snape-esque display of power. Instead, Draco gives him leave to do whatever he wants, but then asks him to duel for the class. Harry thinks for a moment Draco will take on the man himself, but instead he selects a female hobbyist who’s a much weaker dueler than the man, in Harry’s opinion. The class knows it too, and they start tittering amongst themselves until Draco silences them with a sharp look. Harry wishes he could demand respect so immediately – Snape always inspired a healthy fear in students – and from the expression on Ron’s face Harry can tell he’s thinking the same thing.
Malfoy, a new piece of legislation was passed, and you can no longer contact the Ministry outside of normal business hours. See the
“It’s been months,” Harry said. “I can’t stop thinking about Malfoy.” He knew that he was entering dangerous territory, but if Ron really wanted to prove he was Harry's best mate again, he wouldn’t fight him on this. “Do you miss her all the time, or do you just remember things every so often, when there’s a certain song or food or something?”
Harry rolled his eyes and held tightly to Malfoy as they Apparated to another mysterious destination.
Equally furious, Harry took his opportunity. “Sir, I almost had him! We could have been one step closer to finding out if the Death Eaters really are establishing a new Dark regime…that is, if we could have caught them.” He left his vicious thoughts about how slow Dawlish was out of the conversation.
Everything around him ceased to exist as Draco pleasured him. Harry’d never imagined trusting someone else so much to be able to let his guard down completely, but that’s what happened with Draco.
“It might be a bit selfish, I know,” continued Malfoy, his pointed face back to neutral, “But I didn’t only come out here to apologize. I want us to start over.” He extended his hand in a throwback to the moment when they were eleven and the world was different, and Harry could only stare at it in stunned silence. After a long moment, Malfoy looked just the slightest bit hurt, and he started to withdraw his hand.
“Believe me, you’re more than qualified after your upbringing and then what you went through in the War. You probably know a lot of less-common spells they’ll be just dying to learn.”
They were only a couple minutes in when Draco finally touched it, causing Harry to whimper and clench tighter around him, clutching the sheets with his free hand.
There’s a noise from the house, and both Harry and Malfoy spin around to see what’s going on. Ron has burst out the front door and is running down the path towards them. They spare each other a quick glance, a look of solidarity, before turning their attention to him.
“Dreary Lane would be more appropriate,” shudders Ron, settling down next to Hermione. He wanted a front row seat to what was sure to be an intense confrontation with Malfoy.
Harry sighed, and threw up his hands. “Only if I pick the songs tonight. You’re going to love the new hits I’ve got in store for you…”
The shrill sound of Macmillan calling for him couldn’t wipe the smile off of Draco’s face. Instead, he stood up straight, recalled the famous Malfoy sneer, and went back to training not only with his dignity intact, but with fresh motivation propelling him forward.
Ron frowned. “‘Course I do.” He took another giant sip, choking as Coke went up his nose, Harry pounding him on the back. “Why do you ask?” he managed a minute later, still recovering.
Harry scoffed. “I’m Saint Potter, remember? I never lie. Now warm your arm up so you don’t kill me right off the bat.”
“I am,” said Draco firmly. “But I want to take you somewhere else today. I think it’s time to stop commemorating this. I want our life to focus on the present and the future instead of dwelling so much in the past.”
The smell in the air was fresh and undeniable. There was mountain sage, to be sure, but the underlying note was of lavender. Harry took in his surroundings ruefully, listening to his boots crunch into the dirt as he drifted down the neatly cultivated rows. Thoughts of Draco flowed into his mind freely, making him heady as the scent triggered some of his most treasured memories. Kissing Draco in Narcissa’s bountiful lavender fields after exploring the secrets of the Malfor Manor. Visiting Draco in France, sharing a romantic movement among the French lavender even after they’d promised to just be friends. Draco sending pressed lavender in his letters to Harry, back when they used to write to each other weekly, and despite his vow to throw the flowers away, to this day, how he still used them as bookmarks. Draco’s kitchen floor smelling of lemon and fresh lavender, the tiles scrubbed clean underneath his bare feet.
“Hermione,” Harry called. She looked up in surprise, wincing as the cold water washed over her feet from a slight wave.
“They’re right here, sir,” Harry said, interrupting the Captain’s spiel before he could continue on. “We finished them last week.” He exchanged a weary glance with Ron, who was subtly holding onto their dilapidated bookshelf to keep himself standing upright.
“Dinner’s only been on the table for an hour,” said Hermione when he walked in the door. She was relaxing on the couch, with (rather predictably) an issue of
“Come off it, Potter,” Draco sighed, sitting up and grabbing for a towel to wipe off the excess lube. “There are talented people in the DADA program, but you’re one of the best."
They seemed a little bit more receptive, so Draco continued. “Also, as my own coach says, mechanics are everything. You need to perfect every individual skill before really succeeding out there on the field.” He paused to draw breath. “And that builds confidence. This sport is mostly mental, remember?”
He even sounds sincere, thought Harry. Still a little peeved, he asked, “Has your father offered any suggestions?” A second later, he regretted it. Even for Malfoy's sake, that seemed a little cruel.
“I know,” Harry confirms. “I want you, too.” He pulls Draco into a hug, enjoying the feeling of Draco’s lean muscles and torso against his.
“If he can’t walk the walk, then he needs to get the hell off the field,” Zee retorted, standing up straighter and balling his hands into fists. “Baby writer boy should go back to what he does best.”
“I’m not going to get to fucking teach!” Draco shouted, hoisting himself out of bed and grabbing the nearest delicate object. He hurtled it into the wall, the subsequent shattering covering both him and Harry in shards of glass. “None of those sodding bastards will ever give up their position. Hell, I sure wouldn’t!”
, Kingsley would have us out in no time, especially after that promotion he just got at the barrister’s office.” She shook her head as if to clear the thought from her mind. “But that’s not the point!”
“Place called Brawn, a little gem I found earlier this year. It’s wizard and muggle, but I still wouldn’t use too much magic.”
Just then, Professor McGonagall appeared from a side corridor, and Harry’s rage quickly returned. It was in part because of her that he and Draco were having these problems. If they could have roomed together, then he wouldn’t have to put up with Ron, and if she had done a better job of supervising which journalists and photographers were allowed to visit the castle, perhaps they wouldn’t have had that terrible interaction earlier that afternoon.
“And I won’t use magic, either,” Harry promised, trying to nudge them back into that easy intimacy they’d had only a moment earlier.
He stood there, slumped over, chest heaving, wand threatening to drop out of his grip as he tried to come to terms with the fact that, no, he would not be teaching his own Potions class come September. It wasn’t like he’d already gone and designed the whole syllabus already – oh wait, that was part of the application process, silly him – or had started drafting lesson plans in his head, thinking about the best possible ways he could convey the subject matter.
“Naturally,” Draco agreed. There was still something on his mind. “But you don’t think that I’d be, um, I’d be…”
Draco reluctantly walked forward and grasped a car door for the first time, unsure how hard to close it. Fortunately, the guy didn’t seem to mind when he sent it careening into the body of the car.
“Thought you’d never ask,” said Harry. They stood up, but before they could start walking, Harry reached for Draco, who willingly leaned into Harry’s kiss. They stayed in a warm embrace for a moment, Draco tangling his hands in Harry’s hair until finally the cold was too much and they were forced to relocate out of the wind.
Harry smiled. “I’m glad,” he grinned, leaning forward to kiss Draco. “But I haven’t gotten to please you yet tonight.”
From inside the room, he could hear Draco laughing. “You’re still not getting any stew, Potter,” he sassed. “If you don’t like the questions, write your own.”
“Oh don’t worry, you’ll be doing plenty of work,” Harry chuckles. “So I’ll talk to you later, then?”
Draco was frustrated and trying to keep on a nice face, but even Potter looked like he was at the end of his rope.
Exhausted, and slightly miffed by his owl’s judgement, Draco collapsed back onto the sofa and snuggled up with, of all things, with the amigurumi lion that he’d had the poor sense to retrieve when he’d fetched his writing supplies. And at last, he slept soundly.
And with that, Otarres launched into a discussion of one of his favorite topics, having proudly labeled himself a fanboy of Haggerty in class earlier that day. Draco stayed with Otarres talking about literary theory for another 45 minutes, and was as comfortable and at ease as he’d ever been in America. Draco wouldn’t have said he was
“Think of it as a chance to reinvent yourself,” Narcissa said. “Unless muggles are offended by blond hair, they should have no reason to hate you. You can pursue any field you want.”
Zee groused, “Oh, that’s right. You got me drunk–” the rest of the team, with the exception of Nate, broke in with catcalls and jests “–in an attempt to convince me that softball’s a softer sport than baseball, which makes it easier to teach.”
Then, before he could properly see exactly what happened, the person standing on top of a large dirt mound raised his leg and pulled back his arm to hurl the small white ball what looked like directly at the man with the bat. Draco sprang out his chair, sure that the man would end up in a shit ton of pain and attack the thrower with the bat. Were these muggles mad?
“There’s a reason he’s now kicked out of our bar gatherings,” Harry says darkly. “So afterward, we go to this other place where, erm, men dance. On stage. And it’s really secretive; we were blindfolded and led to our seats by some blokes in masks.”
He completely surrendered himself as Draco dipped a finger into the lube and stirred it, muttering a quick Warming Charm to make sure it was comfortable for Harry. Draco positioned them both on their sides and kissed Harry again, shifting Harry’s leg up as he reached between his legs and nudged at his opening. Arousal shot through him as Draco traced circles there, gently poking his finger in as Harry softly moaned into his mouth.
“I realized how troubling our Pureblood views really were during the height of Voldemort’s reign over my house. I honestly wanted to do more after you were captured, but couldn’t without them knowing my heart wasn’t in it.”
José attempted to intervene, inserting himself between Potter and Zee. “Cut him some fucking slack, man,” he said rationally. “He just started playing like last week for God’s sake.”
“I could be persuaded into seconds,” Draco admitted, shifting uncomfortably under Mr. Weasley’s touch.
“Blimey, Harry, how about a little patience?” Harry paused with his mouth resting up against the side of glass and waited. “Fine, then. To new opportunities?”
Draco pulled away enough to look full into Harry’s eyes. “Of course I did,” he said with a small tremor in his voice. “Just because I wasn’t with you didn’t mean I wasn’t thinking about you whenever I pulled my nose out of a journal.”
Malfoy laughed. “Like it was any easier for me to get up, Potter. I can’t even make it to Hogwarts by eight, and you think that you’re the one who had it rough being ready before six?”
Girl #1 enthusiastically jogged to the back of the line as Girl #2 stepped forward. She almost reminded Draco of Pansy Parkinson, with a sharp, pug nose and broad shoulders. He decided that he liked her on principle.
Potter started perking up immediately. “This is super convenient,” he enthused, tossing down a bag of equipment and drawing out several dirty baseballs. “Literally right in your own backyard.”
Narcissa held tightly onto Draco’s still-outstretched hand. “Yes, yes I am. I gave so much of myself to that man; my youth, my family, my values.”
“I love basil, actually,” he admits, grabbing two forks and one knife before turning his attention to the fridge for salad dressing, where he finds dark vinaigrette in a mason jar.
“Well, you see, yesterday, in our interview, Draco revealed that he intended to keep me entertained by-–”
Ignoring their revolted expressions, Nate pumped his fist in the air as he ran out to the rest of the team. “We’re going to California!”
There was a pregnant pause. Hermione seemed unable to speak, so Draco took over. “Good afternoon,” he said pleasantly. “My colleague and I are international vintners, and we are thinking of opening a new location nearby. We’re only able to feature a small selection of wines to start with so we need to choose flavor profiles that appeal to the local clientele. Would you be interested in sampling our product and giving us a recommendation on what would sell best?”
Malfoy gingerly set the cup and saucer down on the tiny round table Harry always ate biscuits at. “I wasn’t sure you were coming,” he said.
“Malfoy?” There was a voice coming from the darkness. Draco buried his face tighter and didn’t say a word in response. He just knew it was Potter, who had the worst habit of showing up at the most inopportune moments. Footsteps slowly approached, but Draco refused to look up. Of course Potter knew; Longbottom would have never lasted ten minutes without telling him. After a minute, he felt Potter sink down next to him. Neither of them spoke. The silence lasted so long that Malfoy had almost forgotten Potter was still there, but then he felt something warm and oddly comforting touch his back. Could that be Potter’s arm?
He rubbed his hand in another teasing circle, finally pulling it fully away from Draco’s bum and resting it on his shoulder.
He received a grumpy response for his efforts, but he knew Draco was only teasing. Curling up in his favorite sofa crease, Harry closed his eyes as Draco began reading.
Father met Draco’s eyes with malice. No longer willing to wait for permission, Draco turned on his heel and purposefully strode from the room, doing his best not to storm.
Draco had no hesitation. He snatched up some powder and tossed it to his feet, determined to follow Potter to the ends of the Earth if that was what it took. Not too long ago, he would have definitely categorized anywhere with a Weasley firmly into that category.
“No, Potter, I came out here after you so I could kiss your ass like every other sodding idiot in the Wizarding World!”
A smart slap on the head startled him back to the real world for the second time that morning. He whirled around to find Pansy standing behind him, smirking and holding her hands on her hips. “
“It’s okay, Potter,” he said, soothingly and convincingly (part of him still was deathly curious at why Potter interfered on his behalf). “You don’t have to say anything.”
He was ready to have words with these faculty members himself, but Draco began groaning from across the room. Harry was at his side in two strides.
After a moment of silence, Draco sensed that Potter was going to turn around and go to bed. For some reason, he didn’t want that to happen. “Do you want to go for a walk?” he blurted out. “The building acts as coverage for one staff member per group, so we won’t be understaffed.”
Draco’s lust-ridden mind and contented heart couldn’t make sense of why Harry was calling him Master Draco.
Fixing him with a rigid glare, Draco let that one go. “There has to be somewhere you’ve always to go,” he said reasonably.
Draco reckoned that nothing had ever appealed to Harry more. Ever since receiving the offer, he’d been ecstatic, trembling with excitement at the merest mention of the program. He felt so useless, Harry said, now that Voldemort was gone. It had been his only purpose; all he’d ever known. And now he had the ultimate offer that would allow him to get back into the game.
Finally, Draco got his first real glimpse of wherever it was he’d landed. There was a run-down shopping center, loads of straggly green grass, and a one main road that looked as if had clearly seen better days judging by how cracked and holey it was. He began to wonder if he’d completely gone mental. This was
“I’ll leave you to your lurid jaunts, mate,” Ron sighs. “Just don’t come bitching to me when you’re all over the special Sunday edition of the
“Here, you can have it,” Malfoy proclaimed, snatching Harry’s tea. “At least you didn’t slobber all over yours.”
Potter still seemed at a loss for words. Draco pointed at the door, “Out, Potter. Escort yourself back to the biscuits and I’ll see you in a few.”
Unsurprisingly, Potter snatched Draco’s hands and locked them above his head, breathing heavily in the interim. Eyes darkening, he roughly asked, “Are you sure about this?”
Draco lay in bed, twirling the fringe of the Indian silk blanket he’d received for his sixteenth birthday. Though he hadn’t left his bed for the last 3 days, he had not spent much time actually sleeping. He’d been thinking of what options remained for his future. Draco had tried to adapt to the new world by finishing his education, hoping that high NEWT scores would at least allow him to be considered for a range of positions. However, the new laws in place caused Draco to be seen as a second class citizen to most people, including employers. He wasn’t yet sure what he wanted to do as a career, but the only job offer he’d received was to work part-time in a shady dark metals store in Knockturn Alley. He’d refused immediately.
Harry wasn’t going to let it go, but just then Ron and Hermione came running down the corridor, looking upset and filthy, though not as filthy as Malfoy. Malfoy held Harry’s eye contact for another split second before resuming his stride towards the Hogwarts grounds, passing Ron and Hermione without looking at them.
The next morning, Harry woke up entirely too early. He was too worked up to think about visiting Ron and Hermione without clearing things up with Malfoy. He hadn't showered...Well, Malfoy could deal with his appearance
The butterflies seemed to have traveled from the lavender fields to the inside of Draco’s stomach, because even as he butterfly kissed Potter, the feeling only grew stronger. After a minute or so, Potter started to lean back, but without thinking Draco slipped an arm behind Potter’s back and pulled him closer, unwilling to let go.
Draco,” Harry murmured, wriggling uncomfortably. “You’re too warm. Come on, get off of me.” He attempted to shove Draco off and was met with empty air, blearily opening his eyes to immediately be blinded by brightness.
Seamus’s betrayal doesn’t hit Harry as hard as the understanding that he might be raped. He frantically thinks back to his Occulumency lessons with Snape and tries to block his mind. Maybe the potion’s effects will be blocked if he can only clear his thoughts…
“Blimey, that’ll hit the spot,” agrees Ron. “Hang on.” A second later, he’s sprawled out all over Harry’s living room floor. “Shit, I tripped on the way over. Sorry for the mess, though.”
Draco nodded tersely and then stepped into the fireplace. “Home,” he said quietly, ignoring the nagging feeling in his gut that indicated his unfinished business and the decision that still remained.
He starts off by forming the long rope he carries into a lasso, holding the coils in his left and swinging the loop around in a circle with his right. It’s an incredibly sexy movement when combined with smooth turns of his hips as he rotates back and forth to face the crowd. Harry is captivated by the man’s performance, but he isn’t anywhere near done yet. With a quick motion, he undoes the loop and flips the rope around his shoulders, holding it with both hands as he undulates, sweeping his hips back and forth. He sashays gracefully around in a circle, giving Harry a peek at the white, smooth skin of his exposed back thighs.
The blush was back; Potter was shaking his head and massaging his palms on his temple like there was no tomorrow. When he finally looked up, his hair was messier than usually and there seemed to be almost a tension in his eyes.
“Of course. He never misses an open bar,” said Kingsley. “And yes, I’ve already mentioned the situation to him, and no, he’s not going to go traipsing off into depths of the case files with you. This is a
He collapsed on his bed, not caring that his fancy dress robes were rumpled or that the pristine bed sheets were now wrinkled underneath him. There was no substitute for comfort, after all, even though it went against what Draco had been led to believe for the past twenty-two years.
, per say, but it was an encouraging improvement from those former dark days when he wasn’t able to get out of bed.
“No, I mean it, Draco,” said Potter. “I want to be here with you.” Draco couldn’t help but believe him; the sincerity was shining out of his eyes. And he had a bit of a weakness for Potter's eyes.
Again, Malfoy mumbled something too quietly to be audible. Instead of demanding Malfoy to raise his voice, Harry leaned in closer so that his ear was practically right up against Malfoy’s mouth. The git better not shout, because Harry would have his arse.
“I didn’t tell her like that,” said Harry, exasperated. “I tried to be gentle, but she didn’t want to hear what I was saying. Kind of how you two don’t want to hear what I’m saying about Malfoy. Yeah, I get it. It’s my fault if he takes advantage of me. But you know what? Something's changed in him, and I’m willing to take that risk. I’m trying to be a bigger person in this new world, and I think it’s best for all of us if you two try that as well.”
“How much do you pay your instructors?” Draco asks tentatively, a faint flush rising on his pale cheeks.
Before he could call her over, Hermione was behind him, reading the letter over his shoulder. “That’s unfortunate,” she said, frowning. “But we’ve got to face him sometime, haven’t we?”
“Yes, Potter,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “We’re going for a walk. Now get over here and grab on.”
Though the sunlight was still brightly shining through the window, Draco closed his eyes and, for once, fell asleep without hesitation. His face was peaceful of he dreamed of a better tomorrow, one where he would not be known as Malfoy the former Death Eater.
“Of course I am, you great oaf,” huffed Draco. “Come on Potter, please –” he broke off as Potter smiled and turned a minute of attention to his own cock, lubing it with quick strokes. He found himself wanting to taste Potter’s hard, thick cock, feeling slightly regretful it seemed they weren’t going to have time for that today.
“Oh, go on, then,” said Ron. “Just a small one.” He conjured a pair of shot glasses and secured the door. “What are we toasting today?”
Draco took a deep breath in an effort to calm his racing heart. “Hermione,” he said patiently. “If you don’t tell me who this maniac is that asked you to marry him after just a few months of dating, I am literally going to have a heart attack this very minute.”
Harry was touched. He met Draco’s eyes and could see his own wonder and surprise reflected within them.
They nod, and Harry reaches for his water glass. Getting too tipsy is only going to cause him more pain.
Sighing, Draco crossed the minefield of a living room and checked the table himself. Behind him, there were more grumbles and noises of annoyance. On top of a parchment that said “Shit McClabe Promised Will Be On The Exam” were a handful of pens. Some were chewed, some were broken with clips missing, and still others were bright neon colors. Among all of them, Draco noticed a fancy fountain pen. “Is this it?” he asked, holding it up.
With an internal sigh, Draco snaked his way back up Harry’s body and went in for another kiss. It helped slightly – hey, at least he was hard – and Harry began preparing him with fingers, reaching for the spot that made Draco sigh with pleasure. Of course it felt nice, but Draco’s body wasn’t prepared to handle such feelings. He was still in mourning.
Sunday did not come quickly, even as much as Draco was dreading it. Their nights were spent in cold squalor—they’d discussed moving on a more permanent basis back to Grimmauld Place or the Manor, but Draco was dead set on having their own space away from any ghosts and Harry was reluctant to make Neville help them move for the third time—and their days were spent at Hogwarts, suffering through long class lectures and even longer study sessions. NEWTs were quickly approaching, and Hermione was determined not to let either of them forget it. Saturday was spent in the library studying, and they were actually productive; Draco made it through over two-thirds of the recommended review topics for Potions and coached Harry through the first third. They celebrated with a pint and hurried blow jobs in the loo of the pub.
. What was that strange sound? If Topsy had come back, she would have simply Apparated into the room, not opened the door. And that was the sound of the door opening, right?
There are explosions of blue, red, and white, and I’ve never seen anything more beautiful in my entire life. Tiny silver fireworks that look like tadpoles streak through the sky, others flash brightly and blindingly, while still others fall very sloooowly and remind me of willow trees.
The team jeered and roared with Harry joining in, feeling utterly and completely at home in a way he hadn’t since the war ended. Nate shouted “Bring it in!” and thrust his fist into the middle of the circle. Everyone else piled their hands on top of his, and yelled “ONE! TWO!  JOE BUCK YOURSELVES!”
“Do remember, dear, that the invitation still stands,” said Mrs. Weasley, smiling. “Whether you end up coming by on a Sunday in a few weeks, a couple of months, or even a year.”
Malfoy met his eyes again, and Harry could see the gratitude and the desire for forgiveness reflected in his grey irises. Malfoy had quite expressive eyes, he noticed, ones he could almost get lost in. He blinked to break the spell.
“Now I’m convinced that you do want to make me suffer,” groaned Malfoy. He walked forward and offered his arm to Harry again. “My good Sir.”
“You can just help yourself to some tart,” says Draco briskly, conjuring up some plastic covers for his feet to avoid trekking mud all over the floor.
Malfoy looked uncomfortable. He broke the spell between them by coughing, and Harry reluctantly drew back his hand. “Never mind, Potter,” he mumbled, no longer making eye contact. “It’s not a problem.”
Eventually, Draco not only refused to leave the Manor, he no longer left his room. Narcissa received many worried fire calls from members of the house elf staff, expressing concern for Master Draco and pleas for her to return home and re-energize him. She had quite hoped he would have the drive to conquer the obstacles thrown at him and start a new life as well. Unfortunately, Narcissa’s most trusted elf, Ceeley, Apparated to Northpass on Sunday afternoon and told her that Draco was no longer eating or leaving his bed. Disappointed, she finally arranged a visit to the Malfoy Manor.
“Buckle up, Ron,” Hermione ordered, rotating around to look out the rear view window. Harry didn’t know why she bothered; there was nothing but scrubby, wilted grass to hit.
There was another snarky comment forming on Weasley’s lips, but Professor McGonagall was already intervening. “Mr. Potter! Mr. Weasley! Of all the depraved behavior—I simply cannot fathom the example you’re setting for the younger students!”
They didn’t talk anymore. They didn’t have to. Instead, they found a deserted sand bucket, which they then used to make a castle, not unsimilar to a mini-Hogwarts. Harry insisted on having a moat. Ron added a drawbridge, and then, after a quick look around to make sure no Muggles were watching, conjured a tiny Snape getting his leg bit off by a crocodile. Harry smirked before adding a miniature, squat Umbridge being chased down by a brown stallion, running circles around the castle in an attempt to escape. They formed Quidditch balls in the sand, Golden Snitches and Quaffles and Beaters, Harry charming them so they moved around the poorly-constructed Pitch. When the tide started coming in and washing their creations away, Harry and Ron sat there too, best mates again, right at the water’s edge, as they watched the sun set.
The weeks after Harry and the Weasel left were surprisingly busy for Draco. He and Hermione were desperately trying to make the revise and resubmit deadline for
They shared evil grins. “Yes, again,” Chris said. “Come on now, you know Saturday morning practice is going to feel weird if you’re not totally hung over for it.”
Granger smiled sheepishly back. Draco decided it would be best to get the process moving and snatched the jar of whole mothwings, dumping out the quantity he’d need to powder. Beside him, Granger worked just as efficiently cracking the silver goose eggs and scrambling them, not spilling a drop.
“Ask that bloody table.” Giving up on finding the elusive ice pack, Draco resigned himself to the bag of frozen peas and sat down at the kitchen table, icing his bruise.
Malfoy snorted, and Harry curled his hands into fists. “No, really, Malfoy. Did you come to ask for some autographs so you can hock them to afford a real pair of shorts?”
“Of course they are,” Luna answered. “This way, you can prepare ahead of time. Harry gets grumpy when he has to improvise,” she giggled.
Harry laughed. “I encourage you to keep trying, but it wouldn’t here no matter what you said. I’m decided.”
Harry closed his eyes. “Me too, Malfoy." They shared a quick glance before walking up to the castle doors, and Malfoy reached out towards the handle.
They continued on in this vein for a while, Harry trying to ignore the growing urge to come, because if he whined while Draco was in this frame of mind, he was sure to only prolong the experience.
The next pitch was right down the middle. Potter was on it in an instance, belting it right back at Draco, who immediately flattened himself down to the ground in a frantic attempt to not take a baseball to the face.
Asten stands as though he’d been burned. “A plea for help? Oh, handsome, I hate to break it Asten you, but no one can save you now.” He draws back his fist, claiming “You’re going to wish you hadn’t antagonized me, precious.”
“Have at it,” Dolohov sneered. “I’ve got Knight right in my crosshairs; he’s the one Voldemort wants.”
“Any more stupid questions and you won’t be eating any of the delicious treacle tart I just made,” retorts Malfoy, swishing off back into the kitchen.
Harry snorted, shaking his head as he followed Malfoy around the back of the small outdoor café. The blonde tried to order for him at the window, so he had to not-so-subtly interject to make sure they got the turkey and cheese sandwich he’d been admiring on someone else’s plate as they walked over. Of course Malfoy expected him to pay, so Harry dug some Muggle money out of the spare pouch he always kept in his wallet and passed it over to the clerk.
Harry crosses over to him and sits between Draco’s legs, leaning back against his chest and letting his head rest against Draco’s shoulder. “Are you sure you want this?” Draco breathes, nuzzling Harry’s head with his nose.
“Draco, we’re going to be late,” Hermione called from the kitchen, where she was taking her tea and cereal. He ignored her, fighting the disorientation flooding his senses after standing up too quickly. For once, Draco didn’t care if his clothes were perfectly matching or if they best represented his personality for the day. The first clean shirt and trousers he found were what he put on.
He was halfway through a story involving an awkward mix-up at an American restaurant (“Our waitress was deaf, and when I said I’d like the bangers, please, she said the only gangsters she knew of were out in the alley next door!”) when they heard the front door shut, followed by footsteps making their way toward the kitchen. Hermione and Ron appeared a few seconds later, Ron with a goofy grin on his face and Hermione with an expression of near contentedness.
They walked until they were away from the living units, out in the middle of seemingly nowhere. The helipad was close, so they sat down on it to get out of the cold, wet grass. When Potter clicked off his flashlight, Draco followed suit. The stars were bright, but Potter’s eyes were brighter.
Jake’s touch lit Draco’s blood on fire, increasing his desire tenfold. Eyes still closed, he breathed out unsteadily. Seeing the effect he had on Draco emboldened Jake, who leaned across the center console to kiss Draco, moving his hand from Draco’s cheek to his soft blonde hair. Draco vividly remembered how Jake kissed from the time he spent the night at Jake’s apartment. This time though, it felt much more intimate. Jake’s lips were just as soft, plump, and warm as before, but this time, instead of sweetly kissing Draco he demanded Draco’s participation. Draco meant to stop before things went too far; he had to talk to Jake properly, but this rougher treatment drove Draco to desperation and all thoughts of being honest with Jake flew out of his head. He smashed his lips against Jake’s, opening his mouth to allow Jake’s tongue to probe his mouth.
He nodded, and was momentarily curious as Draco opened his desk drawer and pulled out small glass bottle of lube.
“Look, Potter,” he said. “I want this vacation to take into account your dream destinations as well. I’m not going to be responsible for deciding everything in this relationship.”
As Mike hustled back, he gestured for Draco to take second. A bit apprehensively, Draco gets into position, trying to look ready for the next play. Nate sends the next fly ball careening out deep into left field, so Zee takes off into the grass to cut off the throw while Draco hops onto the base and gets ready for the throw. Zee really isn’t that far away from him, so Draco prepares for a swift throw designed to beat the ghost runner to the base. Instead, Zee launches the ball directly at Draco’s head as if he’s aiming to knock it clear off. Unprepared for such a powerful throw, Draco ducks instead of trying to catch the ball. Fifteen feet behind him, the ball lands in Mike’s glove with a satisfying
To his surprise, Malfoy chose a quiet but cozy Muggle café somewhere nearby. After Harry regained his balance, Malfoy didn’t let go of his arm. Instead, he tugged Harry towards the front door, saying “They have the best French toast here, Potter. You’ll love it. It comes with cinnamon sugar and fresh orange slices, and you can get a huge side order of potatoes and scrambled eggs.”
“Maybe not,” said Harry, enjoying himself immensely. Malfoy looked into Harry’s teacup before heaving a sigh and drinking the cooling liquid anyway.
“So why is it still hurting? I know you’re better at casting spells than that, Malfoy. Unless you haven’t fully healed it for sentimental reasons,” Hermione smirked.
“The one on the cover is still my favorite,” Draco declared, after they’d been through the lot of them. Luna allocated six of the magazine’s thirty-two pages just for pictures, and, despite Harry’s conviction that not one of them would come out good, they all seemed to turn out great.
There was something else he wanted to say, and for some reason, his body wouldn’t work until he’d gone and said it.
“Good effort,” Harry said bracingly, shouldering the bat for a moment. “I hope you lot paid attention to that lesson!” he called, raising his voice a bit as the three girls giggled together. “If you have to catch the ball, call it. If you’re not in the best position, let someone else take it; shout their name.”
“You’re sure you’re ready to have a relationship, mate?” Ron finds his voice, but it’s still uncertain.
Potter laughed. “I’m sure you have. I know you probably think that this is pretty silly too, but I never got to try it as a kid, and I honestly couldn’t think of a more fitting place…”
“But what?” said Harry. “There’s just no one else you’re interested in, no matter how drunk you are or how many beautiful people you look at?”
“You’re forward,” Granger said, still grinning. “And cheeky. I think I can get along with this new Malfoy.”
“That’s right I am,” Hermione said grimly, leaving the bathroom. Her honeybush tea was calling her. She and Draco often drank wine together, but he didn’t know about her secret stash of rum hidden behind the cheapest, most repugnant bottle of White Zinfandel that they had somehow—and to be quite frank, Hermione didn’t quite know how—accumulated. Unscrewing the bottle, Hermione took a swig before pouring a little bit of rum into her tea to take the edge off of this long day (it was only half-noon). For good measure, before putting the bottle away she took another sip. Hermione had promised herself that Ron, even with the utter
“What are you talking about, I had him by a mile!” yelled an outraged Zee, showing the ball clasped in his leather hand to Nate.
“–-of course I don’t regret it, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to leave behind everything we had either-–”
“Do we understand, Potter?” Schrader said sardonically, leaning on the edge of Harry’s desk, glaring down at him.
“Don’t mind him,” Hermione says lightly, indicating Ron with her hand as she pulls out her own chair. “He took me out for Date Night yesterday and spent a little bit more than he meant to.”
"We can't let those bastards get away with stealing our territory again!" Harry swore, hands curling into fists.
Harry laughed. “Oh Merlin, I remember that. I was absolute rubbish; don’t even know why Nate took me on at first. But after today I think I get it.”
That was honestly more than Harry had been expecting. “Right, then. Can we talk for real?” He was afraid of pushing Malfoy away again, but hell if they were going to get through this without being honest.
“What happened?” Draco whispered urgently, angling his face so that his lips could not be read across the table.
“Fuck,” Draco growled, resisting the urge to chuck it across the room. A raised red welt had already formed on his skin. He bruised easily, so of course he’d have had to hit it hard.
Entering into a dive, Abalona cruised straight to Harry’s bedroom window, rapping on the glass with expert precision and the satisfaction of a job well-done. She looked forward to her usual reward of owl treats as the window began to open.
Draco suspected that she approached the whole affair academically to put distance in front of the reality of his choice, which he already knew she disapproved of. Setting his fork down crisply, he said, “I made the choice that was the most sensible for the both of us. To choose otherwise would only enable the continuation of a mass delusion, one that we’ve indulged in for far too long.”
“Actually, Professor,” came Granger’s annoyingly high-pitched voice. “If you scramble the yolk before adding the mothwing dust, that will produce a clearer, crisper result than simply mixing the two together.”
“Tipsy, make me some toast!” he shouted upon discovering how sticky and wet his pants were. “Please,” he added as an afterthought. After she’d left the room, Draco yanked back the covers to see just how much mess had been made. Merlin, at least he could get rid of some of the come before the house elves had to deal with the laundry.
“Excuse me!” They looked up to see the coffee barista rapidly moving towards them, having finished with her customer. She cleared the dining room in seconds. “Excuse me, sirs,” she said, looking pointedly right at Harry, her voice grating on his already fried nerves. “We don’t allow outside food or beverage in our establishment, so you’ll need to leave.”
“It’ll be fine, Ron,” reasons Harry. “I know what I’m doing. Besides, Seamus would never put me in any seriously compromising situations.”
Fortunately, a place to stay was taken care of with relative ease, nothing like the careful plotting and planning he’d been doing before. Draco situated himself and sat down to think about how he wanted the next chapter of his life to look. Even if it didn’t involve Harry, Draco was going to make something of himself. He was going to find happiness wherever he could.
Hermione carried their teas back to the breakfast table, cringing. “You’re a sadist, you know,” she said derisively.
with Harry; to exist in the same space, reveling in each other’s mere presence. That didn’t take Draco’s mind off of the warmth of Harry’s touch, but just being near Harry would be enough to still the constant whirring in his brain.
She sniffled, wiping her eyes before creeping closer and snuggling her head into Draco’s neck. “This is really stupid, but I’m not even going to miss the sex--do you know what it’s like to have your boyfriend flop on top of you like a wet noodle?”
“I haven’t come to exchange pleasantries, Draco,” Narcissa said coolly, walking over to the windows and flinging open the drapes.
,” Draco muttered, wondering what caused his sudden generosity. As he sat there at the table, listening to the tub filling upstairs, an image of Potter flashed into his mind. Harry was smiling almost flirtatiously, his green eyes glinting in the sunlight. He was wearing Quidditch robes and gear, standing with a broomstick slung over his shoulder. As always, his handsome form caught and held Draco’s eye. Harry’s smile only deepened. He held his hand, encased in Quidditch leathers, out to Draco, who looked at it with wide eyes.
The rest of the week flew by. In the mornings, Nate demanded the entire team’s presence for at least a three hour practice, and Harry often insisted that Malfoy attend and participate in order to pack as much baseball into the day as possible. Harry worked on moving into the place Cale and Chris had managed to secure during the afternoons, secretly levitating boxes when his teammates weren’t looking. He needed a little rest, after all, because in the evening his entire focus was on teaching Malfoy new baseball skills, concentrating on different topics each night in order to give him a well-rounded overview.
“I didn’t know that it was him until the very end,” Harry continues. “Seamus takes the piss out of him for dancing while talking about how hot he is. By then, I realize how long I’ve been pining after Draco, and decide to go talk to him.”
Draco didn’t let him finish. “Potter, stop being a welcome mat. Your purpose isn’t for the greater good any longer, so you can get off your high horse and learn to have an opinion.”
“You sound like you’ve been doing some thinking of your own,” Draco said lightly. “Is it about anyone I know?”
It was a plus on Draco’s part that he began to tease Harry and really make him ache to be filled, because he could only give of himself in this way when he was really comfortable and turned on. After quickly Transfiguring the couch into a comfortable bed, Draco knelt between Harry’s knees and started mouthing down his shaft, licking at the thick vein that ran down the underside. After a short while, he finally began to suck, taking Harry’s cock deep into his throat and hollowing his cheeks as he worked. Harry had never seen anything more erotic or beautiful, especially in such an intimate setting.
He deepened their kiss after a few minutes, tasting the heady scent of Potter that had so frequently set him off into wild furies and more recently, wild sessions of self-pleasure. To his credit, Potter kissed Draco with everything he had, caressing Draco’s cheek and jaw while mussing his blonde hair with the other. Eventually, Draco retrieved his hands from where Potter had placed them above his head and pulled the great git to him, fingers trembling as they came into contact with Potter’s muscled back.
“Right,” said Draco, feeling very much like Harry. Merlin, what effect was that man already having on him? “Sorry about that, Granger.”
Hermione reached for the new bottle of Lysol and broke open the seal. “Okay,” she said simply. There was nothing else for it.
“Seriously though,” José relented, chucking the ball at Harry’s head. “I’ve noticed his form too, and I have wanted to ask him to pitch, but I thought Nate was going to say something before this shitstorm happened.”
Beaming, Malfoy accepted Cecelia’s offer. “I must say that I actually want to produce something proper this time,” he sniffed, examining one of the delicate lace doilies decorating the window display. “Before, you contented me with making short rows that ultimately turned into a triangle.”
Ron waited until she got about five steps away before muttering, “You too, you old hag” under his breath. Harry thought he’d just about gotten away with it until, from behind them, there was a loud “Excuse me?!”.
Draco sighed. “I try not to think about that, because it wasn’t an option for me. When I was forced into the Dark Lord’s service, it was because he’d threated to harm my family should I refuse him.”
With that, they snuggled closer into each other and fell into a deep sleep, though the reality was finally better than their dreams.
Ron and Hermione keep a close eye on Harry and he loves them all the more because of it. Several times, they’ve found him in his bath, too exhausted to get out. There were some low points where he didn’t leave his house for a few days, at least until Hermione and Draco lured him out with homemade food. On the by and large, Harry continues to improve and his bad days are fewer and farther in between.
With a sigh, Harry pocketed the letter—strongly refraining from ripping it up and mushing it into pulp—and made his way to Hogwarts for his afternoon classes. Thank Merlin he’d been able to talk his advisor into that free period. He resolved to tell Draco after Transfiguration, their one shared class.
The Transfiguration classroom was small. Harry looked around—Draco was usually here by now, eager for Harry’s presence to revitalize him enough to make it through their last class of the day. Frowning, Harry slumped down into one of the desks farthest from the door and waited. Other eighth years hoping for a NEWT in Transfiguration trickled in, about half of them offering Harry a greeting, even though the media shitstorm about him and Draco hadn’t died down in the slightest.
“You look fine, Potter,” Draco said briskly. “Come on.” He led the way out of his bedroom, down another adjoining corridor—Harry was thoroughly lost now—and through a secret passage. They ended up in a wet catacomb-like area, and Draco was openly running again, Harry hot on his tail.
He tore his gaze away from Potter for what seemed like the eightieth time that morning before retrieving the dung-covered rake from the furthest stall. Amongst the disgust and mild horror at having to pick up the utensil yet
Draco turned to look Potter in the eye, but Potter’s gaze dropped to the ground and stayed there. He was suddenly aware that Potter was actually upset by something and not just fabricating reasons to make Draco work harder and stay longer hours.
Nodding, Luna picked up the sheet of questions and turned to Harry, presumably about to ask the next one, but Draco hastily added, “After the War, I reached a point where I thought I was irredeemable. Sometimes I still feel that way, but for Harry, I’ll always keep trying to grow as a person.”
Completely baffled about this situation, Harry lets himself be pushed backwards into the wall as the man starts ravaging his mouth. Only when the man leans back to smile brightly at Harry does he remember his former intentions.
The quill felt heavy in Draco’s hand. Their flat was cold too, and he still hadn't figured out how to make Warming Charms last longer. He could ask Harry, but somehow, it seemed dishonest to write about trivial, unimportant things with a literal war going on inside of him. Once again, Draco didn't write back, though the guilt tore him up inside.
around noon with plenty of time to make the much-overdue rounds. He interacts with students, dueling aficionados, worried people preparing for the apocalypse, interested hobbyists, and, of course, people just hanging around waiting to see famous Harry Potter. The two boys who accidentally bound him the last time he stepped foot in
Harry sighed. “And I hate commuting.” He did, too. The bus was slow and inefficient, what with all the different stops it made, and driving frustrated him to no end. Stop lights and traffic could put him in a foul mood on any given day.
Ginny and George burst out laughing, George slapping Harry on the back in his mirth. “Merlin, Harry,” he choked. “Malfoy’s got some sense of humor, eh?”
“That’ll keep ‘em off your plate,” José grinned. Draco had to agree. He sure as hell didn’t fancy getting hit by a pitch; Potter had shown him how the ball’s lace marks were embedded in his skin after one of José’s screwballs went rogue at a practice the previous week.
“I’m going to hit the can,” Seamus says, getting up from the table. “Be back in a few.” He crosses the room quickly, giving the brunet a meaningful look that neither Harry nor Ron miss.
All of a sudden, there’s a flash of light in the distance, and I see a circular explosion with small red pieces branching off in multiple directions.
“Good luck,” Weasley said, drawing back to reach the jar of Floo Powder. “Do what you need to do, Malfoy. Don’t drag Harry along out of some misplaced concern for his feelings.”
Harry caught José’s eye, and without a second glance they grabbed mitts and another baseball before making their way out onto the field as well.
“Look, are you going to help me or not? This is the first day I’ve been motivated enough to think of life after graduation.”
Malfoy nodded in thanks, and Harry cast a quick nonverbal Cleaning Charm on him before stepping back again. “As I was saying, Potter, you’re not getting out of helping. There’s a lot that goes into fundraising. You can take your pretty little face over to the old lady’s houses and get donations for our endowment fund –”
“Should we finish another way?” Harry asks, wanting Draco to enjoy their love-making just as much as he is.
“That’s because you’re doing it wrong, Potter,” Malfoy said. Harry could practically hear him rolling his eyes on the other end of the phone. “People in San Diego don’t usually put up ‘For Rent’ signs because they don’t want the homeless population squatting on their property.”
“Just please don’t hurt me,” Draco manages, gripping the hand of Potter’s that wasn’t covered in lube.
“That’s not the way this one works,” Harry grumbled. The wind seemed to finally blow out of his sails and so he arranged himself comfortably on the sofa next to Draco. “Molly wants to apologize for the Howler and duly note all of her concerns at the same time.”
Finally, just as Harry was getting close, Draco gave the tip of his cock a quick kiss and slid off. He couldn’t help from letting out a soft groan of discontent; as wonderful as it would be to have Draco ride him, it would have been almost as equally wonderful to come with Draco’s mouth around him, especially knowing Draco was being stretched and pleasured by the plug.
him even. He wanted to make a noise of protest, but he was only able to produce a strange noise of contentment. Draco desperately hoped that Potter hadn’t heard.
“See, that’s what I reckoned would happen the first time,” Harry explained, breathless, once Draco pulled away.
“Uh, mate?” asked Harry, “Did you mean to just do that, or were you actually planning a better way to tell Nate that you, er,
Quietly, Draco considered this. “I appreciate it,” he said finally. “I don’t hate you anymore, for what it’s worth.”
Malfoy laughed again, and Harry was delighted with the sound. “As if, Potter. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, and I’ll be matching you bite for bite.”
Left alone with players for the first time, Draco gulped. He really didn’t want to fuck this up; Potter would have his head.
“Should we be worried, mate?” asks Ron worriedly. “He did seem a little out of sorts…at least, for Malfoy.”
They completed their last trip around the dance floor, whirling through other couples and drawing strange looks from those who noticed the heat in their eyes. Finally, Draco neatly exited them off of the dance floor, taking preemptive steps to stop Harry from tripping over his now-stationary feet.
“You’ve never cared about rules before,” Harry pointed out. It went unsaid that he had been just as deviant as Malfoy. “Surely it couldn’t have been bad enough to make you leave the Wizarding World?”
“I missed you last night,” Harry whispered, kneeling down so he could kiss Draco thoroughly. “I think my body knew you weren’t there, because I was restless all night.”
“That was a surprise,” Harry admitted, feeling his own face flush. “I’ve always wanted to do it this way too, Draco.”
“Potter, your hair is always—” Harry silenced him with a look. For some reason, it was important to him to plan this trip, to cement this thing between them. Irrational though it was, he wanted a promise for the future.
Since the man didn’t react with judgement or suspicion, Draco figured that he didn’t know if you chased the Draught with asphodel, it would be lethal to the drinker.
She obliged, and Draco plunged his head into the call to the Ministry. A young desk attendant did not look surprised to see him. “I’ve already told your elf,
“I could eat,” Draco shrugs. He gives Harry a quick once over, which miraculously doesn’t escape Ron.
“Don’t worry about it,” said Draco, “I’ll, uh, catch up with them later. Don’t you have a kid to find?”
“Life is yours to miss,” Weasley mused, almost under his breath. He got up off the sofa and walked over to the fireplace. Draco sensed that it was time for him to take his leave; he rose from his awkward position on the armchair and walked over to join Weasley.
“It was so hard to watch,” Harry admits. “I trusted you, but before today I never believed that technique makes that big of a deal.”
They undulate together as one, Harry feathering his fingers through Draco’s gossamer hair as Draco breathes, “Come for me, Harry. Come on, love. I want to feel you deep inside me.”
, and to my dismay, there isn’t a choice this time. There are only camp songs, camp songs, and more camp songs.
“It’s not your fault, you know,” Potter said mildly as he went over a particularly sore area and Draco struggled to keep from yelping in pain.
Harry blushed furiously as the others laughed and made cocky comments, but Nate recovered himself to interrupt with, “I’ve praised you all enough, and we’ll never be first if we don’t work for it. Practice, tomorrow 5:30pm, be there. Now go home and get some rest.”
“So afterward, Draco comes onstage and practically every guy’s mouth is on the floor because he’s so fantastic at what he does. The dance reminded me so much of
With Hermione covering them with her Glock, they leapt out from behind the bakery and sprinted for the pillars. Harry came to a halt behind the one on the far left; Ron, the one on the far right. After seeing they made it safely, Hermione went for the one in the middle. They quickly caught their breath, stuffing guns into holsters on their legs before Hermione gave the “go” signal.
Sadly, he was tagged out at home, and Nate ended practice by bringing the team in to meet their new co-worker. Becky Lou was screwing around as usual, and Harry lost track of the conversation as he went to pull his helmet off and shake out his messy and slightly dirt covered hair.
Heavily refraining from sighing, Draco made an odd noise of comfort. “Potter,” he said rationally, “Voldemort was coming to Hogwarts whether you were there or not. Remember the Horcrux? That’s just one thing that would have lured him back. The possibility of growing his force was another.”
Draco avoided Azkaban, fulfilling his sentence by paying a hefty fine and doing a year’s worth of community service, but was regarded with derision and contempt regardless of his fantastic NEWT scores. He had accepted the offer to return to Hogwarts and finish out his education, studying harder than ever before. However, his opportunities were limited because of the laws and he even found it increasingly difficult to go out in public.
Grumbling, Ron accepted another hit of the joint from Harry before reaching into his sack for a giant fluffy pillow. “But Harry socked him,” he protested before popping the lock and throwing open the door, dragging Dolohov out onto the harsh cement. “I don’t see why we can’t just run him over with the car,” he muttered under his breath.
They walked to Draco’s car and slung the bags into the trunk, Draco rotating his shoulder in circles all the while in a futile effort to work out the pain.
Harry nudged his hand just a little closer, smiling as Draco sharply inhaled and spread himself wider. “Like that, do you?”
With what was surely his eightieth sigh of the night, Harry moved his arm a touch to the right, and the cameraman quickly captured the shot. Though Luna loved the idea of the sheer shock value, they’d decided to publish Muggle-style photos because Draco preferred the way the pictures immortalized one instance, one second of time rather than a sequence. He could only hope the expression he’d been wearing wasn’t too disgruntled.
“Quite,” Draco confirmed, nursing his tea in what Harry was sure was an attempt to keep from scoffing at her refusal to abide by formal etiquette.
“Troubles, Potter?” Malfoy drawled. He offered his arm, which Harry had no choice but to take. Though Malfoy spun with grace, Harry was off-balance and stumbled when they made it to their destination. Surprisingly, Malfoy tightened his grip against Harry’s arm and drew him back against his body. Malfoy’s body was hard and lean, and Harry found himself enjoying the way Malfoy felt behind him. His mind, without any further provocation, started wondering what Malfoy would feel like in front of him. He immediately berated himself for the thought.
Harry pushed himself off of the floor and stormed out of the room, much to Cale’s and Chris’s amusement. And if he did use the brief ten minute shower to rub one out, no one had to be any the wiser, did they?
Draco liked the roughness, but he wanted the quieter, gentler Harry back. He forced down his need for control, letting Harry take the reins, and the kiss became sweet again.
Before their very eyes, the water cleared and became an underwater haven, complete with several varieties of tiny fishes, starfish, and coral. There was a tiny castle there that vaguely resembled the Malfoy Manor, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder if Malfoy had placed it there himself. Out of the castle came two long, scaly water dragons, one blue and the other green. The dragons shone brightly in the light, and Harry could pick out each of their individual scales, even from high above the pond. Malfoy was absolutely enchanted with them; Harry admired him as he admired the playing dragons.
“Now that’s something I never thought I’d hear coming from a Malfoy,” came a voice from behind them. As Ginny, George, and Draco jumped, Harry swiveled around and was met by Charlie’s grinning face.
“Draco!” Bellatrix commanded, ignoring her sister’s weak protests, “You went to school with Potter for years, did you not?”
After shifting uncomfortably, Draco unconsciously took on a dreamy expression. “It was the most amazing experience I’ve ever had,” he said thoughtfully. “All I could see, hear, and feel was Harry. It was like he overwhelmed every one of my senses. And while he was filling me-–” Draco only allowed the slightest hint of embarrassment to flood him while he described the sensation “–-it was like we were completely and utterly connected. We were the only ones that existed, that
choice. He’d parroted his father’s beliefs for years, which got him ostracized from society. If he did go, Draco knew that it wouldn’t be because Narcissa and Andromeda encouraged the idea. They had simply opened his mind to an alternative path, one he’d never before considered. That wasn’t to say Draco didn’t appreciate their blessing. It was nice to do something that your family wasn’t opposed to, especially –Draco realized with an unpleasant squelch in his stomach- as they were the closest family members he had left.
As it happily pecked away at the food, Harry unwrapped the package. A soft, red cloth fell out, wrapped neatly with a red ribbon, and his stomach leapt up into his throat. Was this what he thought it was? With trembling fingers, Harry untied the red ribbon and unfolded the crocheted material; it was a lovely red dishcloth with a crisp white border.
Harry returned to his spot against the tree, drawing his knees up tightly against his chest. Malfoy waited for him to respond, but Harry stayed quiet. Now that they were sitting in something approaching companionship, Malfoy seemed almost at a loss for words.
However, he felt quite differently about the situation. As they waltzed around the room, Harry found himself swept up in Draco’s gleaming eyes, realizing that it had been his partner watching him make his earlier rounds. There was always attraction between them, but until now, Harry hadn’t seriously imagined being with Draco in every way that mattered.
“Whatever you say, Malfoy,” returned Potter, touching his head softly to Draco’s in order to stare up at the stars. Draco followed his lead and as the two lay there together, a shooting star suddenly streaked across the sky.
wouldn’t help him, as the charm could only draw water if there was a quantity nearby and readily available. No matter, Draco grimaced. Surely the muggles had managed to exploit all the natural resources in North America and he could access them there.
“I love you, Harry,” he said, very faintly. Harry kissed him, but Draco couldn’t help from leaning into the touch and kissing back.
“This would probably be our best bet, then,” Draco concluded. “It’s definitely only about Potions-making and brewing techniques, and though not all of them fit under the category of ‘Dark Arts,’ enough of them do that our submission wouldn't be out of place.”
After the sobs showed no sign of stopping, Harry slowly—cautiously, pulled Malfoy into his lap. He figured that his legs weren't the best pillows, but Malfoy would just have to make do. He slid his hand into Malfoy’s soft white-blonde hair, and stroked, once, twice, and the weeping slowed.
“What about the balls that are kind of in-between positions?” asked Ange, the most inexperienced of the three.
. Listen, I wanted you as soon as I saw you dancing. I was planning to come and talk to you after the show, but then the bathroom thing happened…”
Cooing softly, the owl flew from the perch to Harry’s shoulder, nuzzling into the side of his neck. “What an affectionate bird,” he mused, stroking the owl gently. It eased into his touch, and they stood there together in the dull morning light. All at once, something occurred to Harry.
Despite himself, Harry grinned. “You’ve just narrowed down your dating pool even more, you know. You could have asked the old hag to the company picnic and had a nice celebration with her.”
The owl hooted back, cocking its head determinedly. Owls that were directed to wait for a response usually enticed–-either by vicious pecking or gentle nagging–-the recipient to get on with it sooner rather than later. By its behavior, Harry could see that Draco hadn’t instructed the owl to prompt him for a reply. But it was still here anyway. Was it reluctant to make the long journey back to France?
Saturday passes more slowly than ever. When Ron and Hermione finally meet Harry at the bar, he’s already downed one whiskey and ordered a second.
Harry worked to keep the smirk off of his own face; as precious as it was to see Draco blush after admitting his fantasies, he did actually want to live long enough to enact them. He settled for saying, quite honestly, “Couldn’t think of anything I’d like more.”
“It’s winter, you’re not going to smell them,” Draco said, and Harry could hear a tinge of regret in his voice.
“Ready positions!” Draco called, raising the bat to his shoulder again. This time, he didn’t worry about hitting balls his girls couldn’t handle.
“Harry, mate,” Ron said, interrupting his thoughts and his rhythm of aimless laps around the Pitch. “Want to grab a bite? The guys are heading to O'Kinney's for the game, but I figure you’d want to bugger off, after how boring it was last time…”
Harry slammed his fist down on the desk. “That’s not good enough!” he shouted. “We’ve been in California for nearly three years, now, and the blasted Inter-Office Communications have seen more action than we have!”
“That’s great, Harry!” Ginny cried, launching herself across the kitchen and into Harry’s arms. He didn’t pull back, for a change, instead putting his hand in her bright red hair and meeting her lips in a rough kiss.
Of course, right when he had thought a third counterattack to use in a fight, Finnigan snorted out a laugh and sheathed his wand. “You’re not even worth it, Malfoy.”
“I did,” crows Hermione. “In fact, I’ve vowed to cut out early every Friday and make Date Night a weekly thing.”
Harry’s heart dropped as he held the documents that’d arrived only moments before. Draco was going to be so disappointed. Even if they went to live at Grimmauld Place, which Harry was rather hesitant to do, anyway, they’d still be losing their home; the one they’d already started making happy memories in. He was equally hesitant to move into the Manor, even though Draco would have full access to the expansive gardens. As he tried to come up with a solution, all he could see were delicious pancake breakfasts and a flushed Draco covered in mud, laughing at Harry’s horrible garden puns.
“Yes.” Draco’s breath hitches and Harry already feels his balls contracting. The sight of Draco’s closed eyes and flushed face sends him over the edge, and they writhe together in pleasure. Harry erupts deep into his lover as Draco spurts sharp white lines over both of their torsos, and after the fact they drift together on the verge of sleep, holding one another in a state of bliss.
“I’m sure he’s guessed by now,” Draco said. “Leave it alone, Granger. I feel faint. I think I need to go lie down.”
He could hear Zee snorting derisively behind the fence and had to remember to control his breathing. Really, if Potter wanted to beat the snot out of the idiot, now was surely a good a time as any.
They froze together, still nude, in the cool summer night before agreeing to hurriedly throw clothes on. Somehow, it was even more satisfying to put Harry’s clothes back on after the man had just helped him to take them off.
For some reason, Draco found that oddly hilarious--he blamed it on the glass or so of wine he’d had--and couldn’t stop his uncontrollable laughter from spewing out. He sprawled out on the couch clutching his stomach. In his past life, he might’ve been surprised when Hermione suddenly joined in, but he wasn’t anymore. They eventually ended up plopping down on the floor, rolling around laughing until Hermione’s chuckles turned to tears.
“Not quite,” replied Harry, grinning. “Blimey, though, how’ve you already forgotten our deal? Remember? You take me to three mysterious places around London, and if I have fun, we go on a trip.”
“Next time,” Potter promised. “Wow, these koi fish are gorgeous. I can see why you love this place.”
. It looked like there would be no water or anything else that required the use of natural resources until Monday. And he hadn’t even resigned himself to having to pay 15% more than everyone else for the same services. Weren’t the reparations he paid after his trial enough? What were they bloody well trying to reduce him to?
“Draco,” Nate said, startling the other man as he tapped his clipboard impatiently. “What position do you feel most comfortable in so far?”
They lay on the living room floor together as Hermione continued to sob, listening to branches beat against the building.
. There's no major harm done, he just got dirty. He’s always been a git to us anyway. You do remember how he used to call me a ‘Mudblood’ and worse, right?”
“I’ll drink to that,” Hermione laughed, pouring three glasses of orange juice. “Just as long as you’re healthy, Harry, that’s all that matters,” she added.
Draco continued to storm towards the door. He only turned back, momentarily, with his hand on the handle, when Potter said, “Wait, Draco. Please. Hear me out.”
“Sweetheart, we can talk about travel plans after we whoop some Panda ass,” said Becky Lou. “Come here now, and let me draw on your face.”
“Of course it hurts,” Harry joked, loosening Draco’s hold enough to look him in the eyes. “We’re putting something
It didn’t take him long to eat. Harry heard Draco mutter a quick Scourgify before nipping into the bathroom and closing the door. He decided to pretend to be asleep when Draco came to bed and see what happened.
Waving a hand impatiently, Malfoy shrugged him off. “Minor detail, Potter. Believe me, you’ll have your work cut out for you.”
Hermione pointed her wand at the tea kettle and turning it on before turning her attention back to Draco. “Are you quite sure that’s the best idea?”
“Good,” Draco said. He started unbuttoning Harry’s shirt, noticing the subtle shiver that went through his body and how his nipples began to harden from the cool air. “That’s literally adorable, Potter, that you’re cold.”
“Mm,” Harry agreed. “Maybe they have some pastries in there as well.” He reached into Ron’s bag and pulled out their set of lock picks. “Think we’ll need just the usual, or should I bring the whole set?”
“Either you tell me why you’re so concerned, Granger, or that’s the only adjective you’re getting,” Draco spat.
“What does this do, Draco?” she whispered, clutching the bottle close. “I know you mean well, but don’t make me a promise you can’t keep…”
“It depends,” Luna answered. “We’re putting out a special issue, you see. Daddy’s adding some context about your time at school, interviewing a few professors and friends. Oh, and we’ve also obtained photos too, of some of your and Draco’s most memorable moments.”
“Amigurumi, Potter. It's Japanese,” Draco said. He fixed his attention on the colorful toys instead of on Potter. “And it’s used to refer to stuffed animals that are knit or crocheted.”
“What did your letter say? Was it an outright rejection?” Harry asked, taking the cloth from Draco before he gave himself rug burns from scrubbing too hard.
His task completed, Harry retreated from the tomb and sat with his back against one of the tall trees in the clearing. Maybe sitting here long enough would complete the task that Voldemort started almost eighteen years ago. Now that his purpose was complete, what else
Malfoy turned to Harry then, giving him a secret smile. This was new. “Potter,” said Malfoy teasingly, “I think pushups should be on the agenda next time. These girls have to be in shape before the season officially starts.”
At quarter to eleven, Harry wrenches himself out of sleep, wildly grabbing for his pen and paper. “Malfoy’s contract! Shit shit shit – if I don’t get it to him on time, he’s going to think I changed my mind.”
Out of nowhere he was transported back in time to a memory of playing Quidditch with Draco on the Manor grounds, speeding playfully away while Draco chased him; Draco taunting him mercilessly until one of the insults pissed him off enough to retaliate, at which point Draco snatched the Snitch from thin air where it had been lurking right under his nose. He couldn’t even be upset when Draco gleefully celebrated his victory, turning wide loop-the-loops and grinning mischievously back at him. Pride and love had swelled inside his chest to the point where he was tackling Draco mid-flight, controlling their descent amidst rapid “Potter, you maniac”s and “You’re going to kill us both, you stupid moron”s. The grass was soft as he laid Draco on the ground afterwards, kissing him mercilessly.
“Now you sound like Hermione,” says Harry, good naturedly. “I think she’s rubbing off on you, mate.”
sitting on the floor or leaning against the wall. My back can’t take it today, and I left my brace back in my bunk.
As Draco’s body continued to relax and become more aroused, he could take more of Harry, and they kept up the foreplay until Harry was deep inside Draco.
Ron held up his beer for a toast, and Harry obliged him. “Cheers, mate. It’ll be nice to have a proper ale again when we get back; to see everyone, visit all the old haunts.”
He Flooed back to the Manor, and found the house elves in the midst of preparing lunch. Draco didn’t let them see him, as he was in no mood to give orders or even be asked what he wanted. Once back in his bedroom, he changed into a cool gray sweater and fitted black trousers before sitting down to make a pros and cons list of living in the muggle world vs. the wizarding world.
“Oh, alright,” Draco scowled, a slight blush coming over his pale cheeks. “I’ve always wanted to bottom for you, but we don’t have to do it that way—you clearly like it as well.”
When he came home, though, the flat was dark. The sun had gone down, yet Hermione hadn’t turned off the lights. Was she even here?
They continued to kiss for another minute or two, tongues clashing and teeth sometimes scraping, but Draco wasn’t conscious of any pain. All he could feel was the desire to finish what they’d started, which wasn’t an urge he’d ever experienced so overwhelmingly. Jake’s free hand slipped under Draco’s shirt to rub over one of his nipples, and he shuddered in Jake’s mouth. God, how was he going to walk out of the car if they stopped here?
“Please,” snorts Harry. “You’re a perfectionist. Since you were nearly at the top of our class, I’m sure you got ‘O’s on everything. The first time you have to give out an ‘A’ or below, I bet you assign the kid remedial potions.”
“Are you blind, Nate?” hollered the man with the bat. He stepped out of the white rectangle, stepped over the rectangle-triangle, and waved the bat threateningly. “Sure, it bloody well hit the outside of the corner, but I’d have needed a club to hit it, it was so high!”
There was another long silence. “I don’t know what to say,” Draco said finally. “I’d try to convince you otherwise, but you barely listen to me as it is.”
All in all, in a weird way Draco found himself almost starting to get used to the muggle world, though people still hadn’t gotten over his accent. Several times, he almost glamoured himself before leaving his dorm because of all the bloody attention he inevitably drew from the Americans. The only problem was that everyone (on campus, at least) already knew what he sounded like and would have been really suspicious had he suddenly dropped his posh, carefully enunciated dialect.
The Statue of Liberty was nowhere to be seen when Draco again landed, feeling a slight pain in his temples from the pressure of Apparation. Bloody hell, where was he now? This destination was, if possible, even hotter and more humid than Ohio. Draco’s underarms were already soaked with sweat, as was – he noticed with horror – the regions underneath his boxers. With satisfaction, Draco noticed that this place at least smelled a lot better than Sheffield Lake. There was a faint, citrusy smell in the air, and the surrounding area was dotted with palm trees. He seemed to be in a secluded area of beach, hearing voices but not seeing people.
From the change in music, Harry senses that the performance is coming to an end and feels an accompanying tinge of grief. The dance is marvelous, the sexy cowboy is marvelous, and this kind of thing should go on all night. The man turns his back to the audience one more time, fluffing his arse up as he delicately circles around. With that, he faces forward again, reaching behind him to pull out a silver pistol that Harry hadn’t even noticed and shoots it into the ceiling with a sharp bang. As he lowers his arm, Harry makes eye contact with the dancer and instantly feels his stomach drop painfully.
“You could also cook for me sometimes, if you want,” says Harry with a snicker. “But really, yeah. That’s it. You lot knowing actually helps a great deal.”
His fantasy was lost as Malfoy shoved him; Harry stumbled but looked down to the muddy pond where Malfoy was frantically pointing. He was really excited about this part.
Without any further prompting, the entire team of girls grabbed their mitts and jogged down the baseline. Draco was amazed. He’d never expected such cooperation, especially teenage girls being the way he’d remembered them back in Hogwarts.
It wouldn’t do to call them by numbers, so Draco resigned himself to doing more introductions. “You probably all remember my name,” he said. “But I admit I’ve already forgotten all of yours.”
Harry shook himself out of fantasy world and lightly jogged after Malfoy. Yes, they were in Knockturn Alley. What could Malfoy possibly have to show him here?
“Because we’re better than that,” Hermione insisted, glaring at the joint Harry was currently smoking. “What about that one in the front seat?”
“I’ll send Potter a note tomorrow,” Malfoy reassures her. “It might seem strange, but we’re on decent terms now. I’ve been through a similar situation, and Potter might be able to relate to me better.”
“I accept your apology, Malfoy,” Ron said. Hermione kicked him. He sighed again. “I’m also sorry for how I acted at Hogwarts and for insulting your mother.”
Potter had been standing patiently (ready to move at a second’s notice, Draco imagined), but once the pitches got more consistent he would step out, towards third base, and take a hack at the better pitches. Half of them Potter hit, and the other half, Draco put past him.
“Come on, Malfoy, or you’re going to take a ball to the head,” exaggerated Harry impatiently. Just then, Cale caught his eye and raised an eyebrow suggestively, and it’s all he can do not to burst into hysterics. That would be something else, his balls near Malfoy’s head…
, not by a long shot, but there were the slightest traces of laugh lines in his face and around his eyes. It was amusing to think that he smiled and laughed enough to even have these lines.
“Good timing, Harry,” said Luna approvingly. “I wanted to speak with Draco as well.” Without another word, she set off towards the Transfiguration classroom, leaving Harry to follow behind in her wake. Sighing, he jogged after her, wishing he had some way to warn Draco about the encounter.
“I have news,” Hermione said one day. They were sitting in the living room together, Draco lounged across the couch, busily crocheting a lacy triangle shawl while Hermione perched in the rocking chair, covered in one of Draco’s cozy homemade afghans.
“Sod off, Malfoy,” Harry said. “Believe me, you’re going to be so busy today that maybe tomorrow I’ll bring you some breakfast.”
Though they spent most of their time on the field together, Draco didn’t usually spend time with Potter outside of practice. They occasionally went running with each other, but other than that, they led pretty separate lives. Of course, baseball took up so much time that their lives were pretty non-existent anyway.
Threading his fingers through Potter’s thick, unruly hair, Draco breathes deeply as Potter breaks their kiss and ravishes his neck, lapping and sucking along at his most sensitive places. He’d always thought Potter would be a passionate and insatiable lover, but even as Potter meets those expectations, he forms new ones in Draco’s mind by returning to their kiss with a gentle tenderness instead of teeth-clashing ferocity.
“Oh wait,” said Draco thoughtfully. “I’m not quite sure if that’s possible. Thanks for reminding me.”
Harry carried on until Draco was sure he was going to come. “Harry,” he cried, “Don't stop, I’m going to—"
do anything to get rid of this nervous, scared creature. Sometimes it was hard to remember that Malfoy could be sensitive. It did neither of them any favors when she forgot.
“Yeah, I’ve realized that. But for some reason I can’t bring myself to accept it. I feel like I have to keep working and give back to the community.”
Malfoy was late because he just had to be a dramatic git. It was already past eight, and Harry was tired of waiting. People were moving in and out of the Hall, glancing at him curiously as if wondering why he was just standing around when there was work to be done.
Shaking his head, Harry continues laughing, bending over to put his hands on his knees because he’s entirely short of breath. With his peripheral vision, he sees something dark coming toward him, but it doesn’t fully register until it hits him in the side with a dull
him. Draco could almost have almost gone to sleep without reading the letter until morning, reassured that his and Harry’s relationship was tangible. Key word,
For their final shot, she had Harry face forward while Draco stood sideways, chest against Harry’s shoulder, forehead and nose resting against Harry’s head. Luna hadn’t instructed him to smile, so Harry looked straight into the camera, exhuming misery at the situation and wishing desperately to be at home, curled around Draco in bed. At this point, he was ready to surrender the treacle tart so long as he had Draco to himself for a long night.
“Done,” said Draco, kissing Harry on the cheek while gently caressing the opposite side of his face. The affection already shared between them was like laying outside in the sun on a hot afternoon; the warmth filling his body was tangible.
Even at the best of times, Malfoy still made no sense. Harry shook his head and willingly followed Malfoy out the Manor’s front door and down the walk, to where they could safely Apparate off the property.
“Work on securing the tag,” instructed Nate, walking forwards and giving a visual demonstration. “We can’t have any sneaky runners getting a free base on a regular pitch. José,” he continued, turning to the man on the mound. “Don’t be afraid to fake ‘em out, or even to throw to the bag. The outfield has you covered.”
And Draco did. He left Harry’s shirt unbuttoned and slid down to his knees, slowly unzipping Harry’s trousers, Vanishing his pants, – “Hey, those were my favorite pants!” He exclaimed; Draco ignored him – and drawing out his cock.
“Actually,” Draco said, “I’m looking for a place that has palm trees like here but isn’t so bloody hot and humid. I don’t suppose you’d know of one?”
“Then that’s all that matters,” Draco said. He continued to clutch Hermione’s hands, allowing his mind to race through all the possibilities of what was to come. “I see—so this changes things.”
They Apparated away from the Pitch, going to grab burgers and fries on the beach. It was a warm day, but the breeze refreshed Harry as they waited for their food at a table under an umbrella, sipping Cokes. “You ever miss Hermione?” Harry asked, unable to keep silent any longer.
“Honestly, Harry!” Hermione chided, channeling what Draco guessed was her inner Molly Weasley. “Food’s going to get cold, and we put all that time and effort in-–”
“I want you,” Draco breathed into his ear. He lowered himself slowly, snatching the pillow and placing it behind his head before spreading his legs wide and pulling Harry between them.
“I told you I’d pick something up, right?” He toed off his shoes and walked into the kitchen, feeling the hunger in his stomach for the first time that day.
For his part, Malfoy doesn’t bat an eye and strutted gracefully out of the room. “Oi, wait!” shouted Harry after him. “You might want to change before we go. Here, I brought you some gear.” He pulled out baseball pants, a long pair of blue baseball socks, a jersey, and a very dirty, worn pair of cleats.
“Why yes,” said Draco, blasé as could be. “At one point, I’ll probably end up stripping naked, painting myself gold, and growing a set of wings. Potter never could resist chasing a tantalizing Golden Snitch.”
“Jesus, Hermione,” Ron swore, hanging on for dear life in the backseat. They went the opposite way than they usually would have, roaring down the highway without abandon.
“Yes, Malfoy,” said Harry exasperatedly. “I can’t imagine you liking anything better than the cinnamon French toast we had last Saturday.”
Harry says nothing. He hadn’t explicitly told Seamus he wasn’t trying to pull tonight, but he’d thought his friend knew that.
“Thanks,” said Draco, surprised that Potter knew so much about his life. Though Potter always did have a bit of a stalkerish tendency…
They continued down the highway, eventually pulling off on the exit for Harry’s favorite coffee shop. Probably because they only patronized the shop once every six months, he never tired of their selection. Other than one car in the parking lot, the place was deserted. But oddly enough, that one vehicle looked strangely familiar…
The tension was broken, and most of the team laughed. José, Chris, and Zee still looked concerned, but others, like Harry and Cale, were visibly excited.
