As Ron, Neville, and Seamus reacted simultaneously, Harry's eyes flew open and he sat up. He looked at the people around him, panting, trying to understand what just happened.
"That wasn't more specific, but alright, I'm assuming that you prefer not to give me details," replied McGonagall. "I could say that it's possible, but in different ways. Dreams are important in our world, and there are lots of spells about them. Entering a person's dream, sharing a dream, or making someone dream of something is possible, voluntarily or involuntarily."
"Is it possible to enter someone else's dream?" he asked openly. He wasn't going to tell her about what happened that night but how else could he ask that question?
Ever since the war ended, the wizarding world had been peaceful. The fear of death no longer kept people up at night. No one was struggling with the possibility of their loved ones getting hurt anymore. Even though it was hard to admit and get used to at first, they all knew that the danger was over now. The war was won, Voldemort was destroyed, nearly all of his followers were caught and sent to Azkaban. The Ministry of Magic was cleaned from the traitors and was stronger than ever with the new Minister of Magic, Kingsley. In the last five months, the wounds were healed as much as possible. In short, everything was fine. This peace had found Hogwarts as well, the school year was progressing smoothly after a long time. All students were trying to forget the past and focus on their education. Except one. Harry Potter.

Even though Draco didn't want to believe what was written, his curiosity got the best of him, and he flipped the page. Only disappointment greeted him though because the rest of the pages were gone. Page 108 was followed by page 130. That chapter had nothing to do with dreams. Draco threw the book at the other side of the bed, upset. He could try his luck with the other books, but his eyes were hurting. To top it all, since Harry was about to fall asleep, Draco was wondering if he was going to have another nightmare tonight.
“Release” was the growled command.
“Well lets head to lunch we already missed out next class, and from what I saw since Iv gotten here you haven’t eaten anywhere near enough so maybe now you can. Lets go pretty boy.”
Ch1 House Parties
Harrys face lit up red and started coughing while he ran a hand through his wild locks. He had taken up that action once Sirius had taken Harry into town to get his vision corrected. That was not the only thing that had changed during that trip. Sirius had made it very clear no God Son and heir of his was going to be and I quote ‘A nerd’. So thus, the epic shopping spree of the decade had taken place. Harry came back with his vison corrected, a new hair style, and a whole new wardrobe. Harrys hair was now a new style cut that was cut close on the side and longer on the top. It was now manageable with the way Harry styled it in an intentional messy sweeping motion. His green eyes shown more brightly now with out the glasses. His wardrobe was now more up to date on the new styles in both muggle and wizarding cloths. All in all, she could say Harry was drop dead gorgeous, and unfortunately very gay, well only gay for Draco Malfoy she should say. She let out a giggle but stopped herself when she saw Harry glaring at her.
“Stay here tonight, please” the blond asked quietly
Snape sneered again then snapped his eyes to Draco who was now sitting in the bed quiet and stunned. He was the one who had hurt Blake, but he hadn’t meant to. He wanted to be close to Blake even now, but he wasn’t willing to put his health in jeopardy either.
“Hold on you know him” she raised her voice pointing at the new boy. The boy looked at her and smiled Blaise looked up at her then to the boy and back to her and smirked.
When they walk in through the door way they came to a stop. Stretched out on the black leather couch in front of the three was Blake Viper, passed out snoring. Draco felt his eye twitch in aggravation, he stomped over and stared down at the brown haired teen. Draco then stepped over the back of the couch and stood in the little spot left that Blake didn’t take up. He put one foot on his side then push hard causing Blake to fall off the couch. By this time Pansy and Blaise had made it over in time to see Blake come to.
“Im a teenage guy Im not looking to be held down already. Why can’t you see that!”
“I think I agree with him my legs are killing me” Blake groaned while rubbing his upped thy.
Both boys shook their heads no but their shock was still clear on their faces. Ron rolled his eyes and pointed to the other end of the table where Blake Pansy and Hermione were now sitting.
“With all due respect Professor, I think this needs to be discussed with Blake before you go making decisions for him.” There was an edge of hostility to his voice.
“How is that Ok!” the boy turned staring at the blond with shocked eyes
Draco disrobed and walked to his chest pulling out his pajamas. He changed into the soft silk bottoms then tucked himself into his bed. He thought about the day passed and smiled to himself. He felt lighter like the weight he had been carrying around was slightly lifted. Then he frowned a little at himself, when had he become so touchy. He had never hugged Blaise, he had Pansy a hand full of times when consoling her yearning for the brown haired little loin she wanted so bad. Other than that Draco did not do contact, but here he was letting Blake just do what he wanted. He didn’t hate it but it confused him greatly. He really wished he could figure it out, it was there, ready to jump out at him from the back of his mind, but he couldn’t get it to come forward.
“You two are allowed in, you will take me in to him NOW” was the predatory screech that left the blonds mouth.
“Its not as simple as that Draco, there’s more to it. I cannot explain now but I’m going to figure it out. I can say your magic isn’t directly harming him though, so you don’t need to be worried about that. So you can touch him and such and you won’t be harming him, but you cant for long periods of time.” Blaise pulled back with a determined look in his eye.
“ Shut it Zabini and help find my potion, how the hell did it wear off already” Blake returned in earnest still shuffling things about.
“He needs to be cared for put him back down” Draco growled
“Can you insure she gets there safely and intact” the double meaning didn’t slide past Blaise and he smirked.
“You don’t have to talk but could you please listen. I need to say this, I know I need to” he begged eyes starting to feel like tears were building up. It was quiet before he said again “I promise I won’t look you in the eyes unless you say I can. I know what I did and I’m truly sorry Blake, even though I didn’t intentionally do it I should have known what I was doing, and I didn’t” it felt like forever before he heard Blake make any kind of noise. The sound though broke his heart, it was a quiet shuttered breath that left his lungs, one that you knew meant the person was crying.
I apologize for being so late on updating. I lost my younger brother this past week and its been very hard on the family. Please everyone don't be scared to talk to someone if you need to. There is always someone there who will help, you mean the world to your family and friends. If need be message me don't sit there alone, go to someone. Please everyone take care of yourselves You.Are.Loved
“I wanted to tease you because I like to see you blush” the blond admitted his own face going red. Harry looked up confused.
The boy spun around with a sneer. He had short sandy blond hair that was spiked up, and dark blue eyes. He was handsome in a normal everyday country boy way. Draco could tell he was pissed at being called out on his obvious attempted seduction of the Slytherin boy.
“ Yeah Malfoy that’s something I would do not you. The least you could have done was come find us and we would have happily helped” Ron grumbled out.
Rons face had contorted in anger and he was now getting to his feet. He still had more height on him than Hermione and Harry and towered over both of them. He reached out and grabbed the girl by her elbow and turned forcing her to follow him. At that Harry grabbed his shoulder and spun him back around and forced him away from her.
“Leave. Now” was his low command he saw the boys feet shift and hesitate
“You do realize when he sees you were lying it will be your ass correct” she said “But I do have to give you kudos it was a good way to put it to him” as she opened the door and they walked in they all heard a shouted “Viper!” Blake smiled and hurried over to the table hoping to get a seat to where Draco couldn’t cause him any harm yet.
“Oh fine ill just walk with Dray, you two go laze around, and get fat eating junk food” she turned her nose up and looped her arm through Dracos and pulled him with. Draco sent a half hearted glare their way, but he could use this time with Pansy anyway, he had wanted to talk to her. Might as well do it sooner than later. The two boys waved and walked off shoulders brushing with each step as they talked between themselves. Draco felt that hot pit in his stomach again, he sighed and turned his head back towards Pansy. He was met with her brown eyes studying him.
-----------
He had finished is morning routine and checked the time he still had an hour before he would normally head down to the Great Hall for breakfast. He sat down and pulled out his favorite quill and silver and green ink and began writing.
“Ill always be yours Draco, Ill never leave you I promise.” Both said at the same time.
They were both quiet for a while both staring at the wall Infront of them. Draco was trying to gather his thoughts, how he wanted to say everything. At the same time he didn’t want to say anything at all.
He slowly sat up and slid out of the bed locating his shirts and throwing them on. Then he grabbed hs shoes and slid them on. He started making his way over to the door then stopped and looked over his shoulder at the blond. What if he hadn’t been drunk? What if he knew he had offered for Harry to sleep with him? Then what, he could be ruining the beginnings of something he had always wanted. Harry slipped over to the black desk and wrote out a note.
He slid his feet onto the floor and stood up walking over to his dresser pulling out his cloths for the day. He walked into the joining bathroom and started his daily routine. He thought of all the ways he could beg for forgiveness from the two teen boys he had royally pissed off and hurt last night. He really didn’t mean to use his pull, he was just overly worried. Blake had not shown up to lunch, then to find out he hadn’t because he was sick after taking a potion he apparently had to take for some kind of sickness. It scared Draco to no end he was worried, he wanted to help, he didn’t want to loose someone else. He stared wide eyed at himself in the mirror with his toothbrush hanging out of his mouth. How had the other teen gotten so close to Draco in only hours, this had never happened before, and honestly it scared him, but not enough for him to run away. He wanted Blake Viper as his friend and that was the end of it.
Before Blaise could move, a first had connected with Rons jaw and he fell to the floor. Harry stood there just looking down at his friend shaking his head, and Hermione stood over him face red with anger. Blaise and Draco were stunned at the fact the girl actually hit one of her friends.
“Have you written your mother” he asked his eyes soft
“Malfoy has now taken an interest in you, that means if he doesn’t know where you are or what your doing, he will throw a fit. He has horrible only child syndrome” the girl finished looking at her nails and picking at them. Blake tipped his head back and looked at Draco, and the blond just staired right back at him, Blake groaned out.
And that was that.
” Draco falls into another fit of laughter, and Harry can’t help but join in.
Harry nods, looking back to the front. He’s got no problem sitting next to Malfoy if Malfoy has no problem sitting next to him. A woman with purple hair walks up in front of the screen, turns on a slide presentation, and introduces the teacher training retreat programme.
“Wait, so you were trying to go to a
“Er, yes,” they reply. “That would be… good. I’d appreciate that.”
“Were you being neglected?”
Harry clears his throat. “Ah, excellent, why don’t we go on to… Dave, which exam rooms have been cleaned?”
“I’m trying to sleep,” came Potter’s muffled voice from the foot of the bed.
“Yes, his name was Harry, and these two were his best friends.”
Draco didn’t know what he expected to see when the boy opened his eyes, but it wasn’t tears. The beautiful green emeralds were bright with unshed tears. Draco pulled back and looked at the teen worriedly.
“I don’t want you to leave and I want to still talk to you. I don’t have any friends besides Blaise and what I have seen with you and Pansy, I would like if you all would consider the idea.” He stopped and took a breath and continued.
‘I don’t live with anyone now, left my aunt and Uncles. Is your hair natural?’
Harry turned around and just started at the blond for a moment then smiled a little and walked to the blond. He stopped in front of him and held his arm out with a giggle he said “Well escort me to your bed sir”
-------------------------
“I only ever came into your room when you, Harry, and I had something to discuss. Same reason you ever came into my room. Don’t you dare act like we have ever had any other things going on in a manner such as that” the girl yelled back.
Twenty minutes later and Draco finally descended the stairs and looked up his eyes automatically going to Blake who was staring without any shame. Red tinted his cheeks and he walked past them heading for the great hall “Lets go you lot or we wont be able to eat” he commanded.
“So you’ve been pining after this guy since second year, and haven’t made a move” Blake laughed. Then he squeaked when he felt the stinging hex thrown at him from said glaring boy.
“You have any hangover potions” he asked with a crooked smile. Hermione smiled with a shake of her head.
“I know its only been maybe twenty four hours but talking to Blake or listening to him, it all slips away when he’s around” He looked at Pansy to see if she understood. She nodded for him to continue.
“Well I would suggest you start using their given names especially since you want to corrupt them” Blake laughed out, He leaned back against Dracos shoulder which caused the blond to smile.
“Draco are you awake” was the barely audible question.
Blaise stumbled back and pulled his wand ready to strike at any moment. McGonagall did the same thing but was more composed, given the situation.
After stepping into his room and shutting the door Draco finally let his mask slip. He walked to his four poster bed sat down and cradled his head in his hands letting silent tears roll down his cheeks. The welcoming feast felt anything but welcoming especially with Harry not there. He didn’t get to smirk and cheer a little louder while staring at the Gryffindor table hoping to irritate the raven haired boy. He didn’t realize that that would affect him but then again he did it in the past to get a rise out of Harry so he would notice him. Everything was so wrong now and it seemed like he was the only one who was affected by it. Draco stood up and made his way to his black wardrobe and pulled out night cloths and changed, then made his way back to his bed and laid down covering himself. He silently cried himself to sleep, and in sleep he dreamed of beautiful emerald eyes, but then at some point one of those eyes turned brown.
Chapter2
“Don’t get snappy with me, you’re the one that chose cuddles over common sense.”
“Draco, I promise Snape can take care of him and help him, but you have to get out of the way so he can do that” Blaise said calmly.
They were taking their places at the Slytherin table when Draco finally came back to the world from being in his head pondering. As expected as soon as they were planted in their seats Pansy was in on them, well more so Blake then Draco.
“Ummmm Draco, I love you and all, but not like that” came the smooth draw. Draco quickly came to and met Blaises dark eyes and smirking face. He pushed the Italian away from him and ran a hand over his face.
“I smell flowers, lip gloss, and silk” she said her face going bright red when Ron laughed. The red head followed next after Hermione hit him in the arm.
“I wanted to have at least one normal year in a school. To be around others, make friends, and live like a normal person. So after begging and pleading I was allowed to come here to Hogwarts” he finished and looked up to the others waiting for the next question.
Draco pulled back a little and looked down at the smaller boy his face still red from embarrassment. Harry smiled at him and brought his hand to the other boys’ cheek.
Harry sat down in the chair and watched the two closely evaluating the current situation. The two looked back at him Hermione was calm, but Blaise started to look a little nervous.
-------------
“Why would you call for Draco to get me you should have left him in your alls rooms and came yourself” Snape hissed as he jerked on his cloak.
“Ill leave you be, I just wanted to apologize” he went to walk to the door but felt fingers wrap around his hand, and glanced back. Blake was siting there with a small smile, he gently pulled Draco back to the bed to sit with him.
“I haven’t had the chance, but I will write her tonight or tomorrow” he promised not meeting his eyes . He felt a hand on his shoulder and leaned into it.
-------
“Ron, Hermione, no offense but we never went to you all about anything before, why would we now?” Pansy said slowly.
---------
“Yyyes I was” he could feel the blush on his cheeks. Blaise let out a gleeful laugh
“Your right Zabini, would you happen to have any ideas?” the Blond asks with a sinister smile which Blaise returned.
“They will not give us the time of day why should we have to endure that humiliation” Pansy cried back
“Is he ok?” was all the blond had to say. Blaise looked up and sighed, he hated the dead look in his friends eyes.
Draco was shocked when Ron plopped himself down across from Draco and Blaise and started piling his plate full of whatever he could reach. The red head looked up with a piece of toast hanging out of his mouth.
“I wasn’t making fun of you Harry, I wanted to tease you a little” Harry went to pull away again, but Draco held him there.
“Actually you will only see him in classes Draco” Draco snapped his head back to his God father and growled.
“I knew I had it for Harry for years and never acted, just bullied him and belittled him. Then when I finally went to him it was to late. Don’t do that to yourselves please. We just started the year that should give you time to at least build a relationship that you could continue even after we graduate” he finished sadly. Blake took the blonds hand in his and squeezed it, Draco squeezed back with a small smile.
“I will listen, and won’t even say anything if you don’t want me too. I know how it feels to hold in pain and heart break and have no one there to help or listen” he said and glanced at the blond out of the corner of his eye.
“Bloody hell Harry you’re not the ruler of everything. Stay out of this and it’s the last time I’m going to tell you. This is between Hermione and me.” The red head spit back.
“Yeah I think its more than that Harry Potter, I think you just want an excuse to see a certain Slytherin” she said loud enough only her and Harry could hear.
Harry stiffened as his mind started running wild, who was he with, and now that he was fully conscious where was his shirt. He let out a quiet breath when he felt the other occupant behind him remove his arm and roll over. After a few moments and listening to the breathing Harry determined the person was asleep still. He rolled over and was met with platinum blond hair, he froze, only one person has that beautiful hair. Harry laid there staring at the back of the other boys’ head trying to remember what had happened.
“You left me!” at this I fell to my knees both my hands clutching his brown jacket on either side, my head hung low as I continued to sob uncontrollably.
“The Weasley did a number on Harry” Draco just stared at the other for a few minutes as the information sunk in. He stood up and made his way to his dresser pulling out his outfit for the day his back facing Blaise.
“Well there we have it. Game plan A next will be plan B but we can wait for that” Blake said excitably.
“You’re not going to ask them to marry you, you’re just going to say hi and eat breakfast. Come on out” Draco tried to say with a calm voice but at this point his patience was thin.
------------------------
When Blaise opened his hand to let go of Blake Draco started coming back to his senses. He lowered himself back to the bench as he glanced around and saw most of the Hall was watching, he could only hope they hadn’t seen anything involving his ‘Situation’ as they called it sometimes. After gaining control again he looked at his two long time friends and said
“So who gets the pleasure of chasing you all night” he asked with a knowing smile. She blushed heavily and bumped against him playfully.
Draco stared on as the four others carried on talking and picking at each other though Ron mainly took the brunt of it. He smiled to himself, months ago he never would have pictured himself here with friends, especially calling Ron and Hermione friends. But he felt right, he felt happy, not complete though he only had that feeling once two nights ago as he laid in bed with the beautiful brown haired dule color eyed boy he had fallen for. He knew this was going to be a hard road, but he also knew the people sitting here on his bed would bring him through it come hell or high water.
“Actually, Miss Black I do have to ask your brother. Since your…… Father isn’t here he is the male in charge of protecting you. Its only proper etiquette that I ask him” he said with a smile.
“So someone, well not just a someone, a Weasley, put their hands on the person I intend to court” Draco asked while he grabbed his wand and slipped it into his pocket.
“You two are ridiculous” she said with a glare but was smiling. Both of them laughed and Blaise escorted her from the room.
“Is he ok?” right now that’s all Draco cared about was finding out if the smaller boy was ok.
“Its ok Draco you’ll always have us” Blake said, Draco didn’t reply just nodded his head then went to stand up and pulled Blake with him.
“Yeah, ill get you one”
“Draco look at me” he said sternly but the blond didn’t move or say a word. “Damnit Malfoy! Look at me”
“Your on Malfoy!” he said in delight and started walking out of the exit of the common room to breakfast. Draco followed him with a real smile one he hadn’t used in months if not two years. This didn’t go unnoticed by Pansy and Blaise. Both of their minds working on a plan already. Mrs.Malfoy did say to make sure he made new friends or something like that.
“And what was it that had you running from the class Dray. You haven’t done that since ……… well you know” and Draco knew she was talking about sixth year when his life first started going to shit.
“Hush you, we both know nothing will happen. Remember he was forced into asking us and still doesn’t like me” he said casting his eyes down. She just rolled her eyes and they continued down the stairs and to the portrait hole. They both saw Ron over by the fire chatting up some sixth year and ignored the nasty look he gave them. By the time they made it to the Slytherin common room they were almost forty minutes late, but Sirius said you were supposed to be fashionably late so that might as well have been on time.
“You try and you’ll be at the bottom of the lake Zabini” he said casually. Their eyes caught in a battel of dominance. Blaise looked away first but grabbed a bagel and buttered it and threw it on the blonds plate.
“Draco are you faring well, considering the situation” he asked softly. Draco looked up at Severus then and his eyes filled with unshed tears and shook his head.
Draco looked quizzical at Blake who was worriedly staring back at him. Draco silently transfigured his ink bottle into a small mirror and was shocked at his reflection. His eyes were no longer his signature ice gray but had blown up black. He closed his eyes and focused on his breathing and tried to get rid of the anger he was still feeling at finding out what Blakes relatives did to him. When he finally felt he had calmed down he then opened his eyes to see they were back to normal. Once he was sure he was fine he wrote back to Blake.
“Details” was all the blond said as he walked into his bathroom leaving the door open so he could hear Blaise talk.
“Draco he has disrupted our dynamic” she stated “But it doesn’t seem like its in a bad way, I have to agree he fits, especially since he can get you to talk” a glace was thrown his way seeing how he’d react. Dracos eyes widened a little but kept his mask in place other than that.
“What do you have to take, and what for, maybe I can help you. I know potions I was trained by my god father” Blake wiggled around and tried to look away but Draco wouldn’t let him.
“He’s the only one that can handle Blakes condition in the first place and this has never happened before so its best if he knows first Draco now go get him” Blaise shouted back.
“And what was that all about?” Draco asked once he stood from the bed again and started looking through things as well.
“She’s right you are, I don’t think we would have cared either way. We probably would have ended up with the professors before we would have figured that out” all four made an uncomfortable face, they definitely didn’t want to sit with the teachers. That would be humiliating they all knew.
Harry looked at Blaise and smiled ‘So he’s more than interested in just a casual fling then’ harry thought. He stepped to the side slightly and guided Hemiones hand to Blaises but stopped and smirked at him.
“Do you think this is a good idea?” he asked looking from Blake to Draco, it hurt him to see that Blaise didn’t trust him right now but he did understand why.
Draco smirked at having caught the teen laying on his side facing him staring at him as he got into bed. Even in the darkness Draco could see the dark red blush staining the Gryffindors cheeks. He smiled to himself, a little teasing never hurt anything did it, he thought to himself. Draco laid on his side facing Harry but scooted closer until he was only a breath away.
As the day went on it was harder and harder for Draco to keep himself away from Blake. And every time one of their friends drug him in a different direction to keep him away, he started hurting more and more. He didn’t know how he was going to keep this up. Finally, classes had come to an end and Blaise left the group saying he was going to drop his things off and go see Blake in his room. Draco decided that he was done with the day and stayed in his room for the night. He was exhausted after dealing with the emotional whiplash.
Hermione spun around face going bright read and glared at the black haired girl, and Draco felt scared for his friend in that moment.
Draco sat back against his pillows and sighed then reached over to the tray of food and started eating. Happy it was just a simple sandwich and chips he knew his stomach wouldn’t take anything else. The two sat silently each replaying the past two days and thinking of the days to come.
“Im a gentleman Mr. Black, she’ll be returned as she is in this instance” he said and offered his arm to the girl and she took it rolling her eyes.
“ Malfoy. Draco Malfoy”
“Thank you, professor, I believe I will have to speak with Mother about her carelessness” Severus’s eyes widened. He then scowled and quickly bellowed to the front to begin class.
“In short Ronald insulted Black, Harry, and Hermione. Harry socked him in the jaw and Ron did more damage. Harrys lip is split, black eye, bloodied nose, and Im fairly sure the back of his head is sore from hitting the floor” Blaise didn’t get a reply and that worried him. A quiet Draco is a deadly Draco.
“Harry what’s wrong you seem stiff why don’t you relax, do you need help” Draco brought his hand up to the others waist and lightly stroked it with his thumb. Harry was shaking now his breath coming shorter and shorter. He still hadn’t opened his eyes though and Draco wasn’t having that.
“She don’t want to go anywhere with you, you dirty snake” the red head growled. Blaise stood straighter and stepped forward challengingly.
Both boys pulled back once air became an issue and just stared into each others eyes. Neither wanted to break the moment they were having. Draco lifted his chin slightly and tucked Harrys head under it and held him close. Harry sighed and placed a small kiss on the others chest and closed his eyes and let Draco lull him to sleep while he continued to run his hands up and down Harrys back slowly. Soon both boys fell asleep as the dawn light started to show through the small window across the room.
Draco felt a hot rage go through him who would do such a thing. He wanted to find his family and rip them apart, but he reigned in his anger. He shouldn’t feel this angry.
“I don’t want to talk to you Draco…. I just can’t right now” he said and he heard the anger in his voice. Draco stepped closer and put his hand on Blakes knee and knelt he stared at the boys chest then tried again.
Dracos eye twitched and Blake threw his arms up and walked away from the door and flopped on the bed. The blond had had enough with his two friends. He stepped back and pulled out his wand and threw a spell at it and the door blew open. Blake sat there wide eyed as the two came floating out of the bathroom upside down, Blaise glaring and cursing at the blond and pansy trying to hold her skirt up to keep from exposing herself. He floated them over to the bed next to Blake and dropped them there. By this time Blake was in a fit of laughter.
“Since when did Severus become a medi wizard!”
“I should probably be making sure the other was a gentleman. Lord knows he’s pushy when he wants something” Blaises smile then fell as he took in Harrys appearance.
Soon they all walked into the common room the first years gathered around Snape listening to the standard intro duction pretty much saying ‘ You fuck up, ill have your ass for the remainder of your education here’. The group of friends walked over to their normal seats Pansy and Blaise sitting on the black leather couch in front of the fire place and Draco slipping into the high backed chair. Blake was actually walking over to the group of first years to listen in on the ‘Welcoming Speech’.
Draco, Blaise, and Ron all looked at the two stary eyed girls in a hint of disgust.
Draco read it and dropped his head into his hand, he knew it wasn’t good enough not for what he had did but didn’t need reminding of it. On the other hand this could be his chance to right himself with Blaise.
Draco continued to stare at the roof of the compartment tears slowly sliding down the sides of his face. “Now do you see why I believe my mother wrong? It wasn’t just being in the same room and making eye contact. It was just him and I, only the two of us when I felt it for sure as I held him in my arms. The first and last time I held him” a sound of agony slipped from his lips. Draco leaned forward and cradled his head in his hands as more tears started to pour from his eyes. Pansy jumped up and knelt in front of him resting her hands on his knees.
“Come now lovey, he has a right to laugh it is a little pitiful” Pansy said which earned her a hex as well. She rubbed her thy and flipped the boy off.
“ Ten gallons says neither of you can get Hermione or Ron to go to Hogsmeade with you by dinner” if there was one thing that the two loved more than anything it was showing up the Blond and having bragging rights.
Draco walked all the way to the back of the train and stepped into the last compartment. He sat down and let his head fall to the back of the seat and just stared at the roof of the compartment. Blaise and pansy stepped through the door and closed it behind them and sat on the bench across from Draco. The three sat in silence for quite a few minutes. Draco staring at the roof and the other two staring at Draco.
With that the two other teens left the room leaving Blake and Draco in complete silence. The blond stayed kneeling in front of Blake with his eyes cast down waiting for Blake to say or do something. But time continued to tick on, and the longer it did the more Draco wanted to stand up and run from the room. He jerked when he felt a hand on his shoulder, but other than that didn’t move.
“Draco why didn’t you tell me…… that I was your mate” he whispered eyes starting to shine. I let out a broken laugh but kept my eyes on his.
“Blaise I’m sorry”
‘What’s wrong?’ it was a simple question but there wasn’t a simple answer. Draco wrote back
Draco spun around when he heard a knock at the door. He ran over and threw open the door to find Blaise standing there looking around worriedly. When he spotted Blake, he pushed his way inside quickly. Blake was now on the edge of the bed holding his stomach gasping.
Draco woke up early so he could get ready and have time to write a letter to Blake. The group had decided to pass the notes back and forth for the two boys while they did research into Blakes medical issues though its hard when there isn’t really a medical issue so to say. Blaise had tried many different times to explain the situation but he wasn’t able to, every time he would get to close to letting something of value out he’d get a head ache or a wave of pain would wash over him. After the fifth time of him trying they had told him to stop trying before he did major harm to himself.
“Im looking forward to it” was the other boys reply and Draco found himself looking forward to this new friendship that seemed to be forming.
“Damn you! Do you have to throw that damn Charms book at me every time? You are a wizard use a damn hex every now and then I don’t want brain dama…. Shit, fuck, you’re such a bitch in the mornings. You send another stinging hex like that towards me and I’ll pour all your potions down the drain” when Draco heard that he sat up quickly and looked around to find the Italian boy so he could hex him as well for the threat.
Draco took in air not realizing he had been holding his breath and he smelt the faint smell of trecaltart mixed with potions. His heart stuttered and his arm tightened a little further on instinct. When he looked down he met the startled duel colored eyes of Blake and noticed the pink tinge on his cheek bones. Draco instantly pushed Blake away from him and righted himself.
“Well lets get going, the sooner the better.” With that he turned around and walked out of the room. The other three following after.
“Oh hold up! You don’t get to come out here demanding us to hurry up when you just spent twenty minuets getting ready” Draco spun around surprised by where that comment came from. It wasn’t from his two long time friends but from Blake the boy that seemed to have a staring problem. Draco raised an elegant eyebrow at him and smirked.
No sooner then the three sat down Draco bellowed in and made a bee line right for them eyes only on Blake. “You cheeky bastard, I had no such marking” Blake smiled and shrugged. “But it got a rise out of you” Draco was taken back by the straight forwardness of the confession. But he had to be honest with himself he didn’t mind, and it actually made him a little happy.
“Zabini can you stop with the shit you have spewing from your mouth” Draco growled, pushed the Italian to the side and glared at Hermione who only laughed. Harry at this point pushed forward and glared back at the blond.
“We were surprised but not really. I mean the two of you were obsessed with each other for years” Hermione said sadly. Ron nodded in agreement
Draco walked up to the other teen and smirked. Blaise knew things just got interesting, because in pure blood society it was eye for an eye, and Ronald Weasley hurt someone Draco considered close to him. So someone close to him was going to be hurt as well.
I own nothing besides the story idea all others belong to JK Rowling
The potions were sitting in front of the three groups bubbling, and four of the students looked very worried at the moment. Because any minuet now it would be time for them to write down their notes which would include what each person smelled. Draco wasn’t worried at all, considering the one he loved was gone, his eyes saddened and started to glaze over with tears.
“Get the damn vial and I will”
Draco was brought back to the world of the living by rough shaking, rolled over to his back and looked up threw blurry eyes. The only thing he seemed to notice was black hair and a faint smell of wood polish, and treacle tart. He reached out and grabbed the person and pulled him down to himself.
“This was a bad idea Viper” he heard the rough morning voice of Blaise say.
“Take your Potions, what’s wrong?” Draco asked worry etched all over his face. Blake reddened and looked down to the floor. Draco wasn’t having it he reached down and grabbed the small teens arm and hoisted him onto the couch and half way into his lap. He brought Blakes face to meet his and he stared hard.
"I'm sure you can find something if you look up the 'bonding spells' section in the library."
When he reached for an old, dusty book, he was about to lose all hope. The cover of the book was about to be torn off, he took it carefully and wiped the dust with his robe. He opened the cover which said 'Strong Bonding Spells' and turned a few pages. He skimmed through the contents, then he halted. It said 'Dream Bonds'. The sub-headings right under it were all about dreams. He wanted to open that page and read it right away, but he didn't want to skip any details. He closed the book and put it in his bag. After that, he quickly looked through the rest of the books and found three more which mentioned dreams. It was past nine when he made his way to the dorms with the books in his bag.
"Who do you think you are?" asked Pansy, challenging him the same way.
"Bonding spells?" Draco asked, confused. "What does this have to do with bonding spells?"
"Thank you, Professor," he nodded, walking towards the door.
He fought sleep for a long time, his eyes never leaving Harry. Once he was sure that the male was asleep, he stood up and walked over to his side of the bed. Harry didn't look like he was having a nightmare. He was breathing calmly, quietly. Despite that, Draco couldn't help himself, he reached out and touched Harry's hand with his finger. He was prepared to enter another dream, but.... Nothing happened. With narrowed eyes, he pulled his hand back. Then he tried again. Again, there was nothing. Even though he had touched Harry's hand numerous times, he couldn't get the result he wanted to, so he stepped away with a sigh. He couldn't expect Harry to have nightmares all night. Draco would probably fall asleep while watching him for signs of a nightmare, and he wouldn't be able to hear anything due to the silencing charm.
"What?" Even the word '
After his friends left, Harry stared at the other bed in the room and thought that the male was asleep. Maybe Draco was putting silencing charms around his own bed. Harry hoped that was the case. He didn't want Draco to see him like this. He couldn't put up with Draco's attitude because he 'lost sleep because of him'.
Then Hermione entered the room. She pushed Neville and Seamus aside and walked to the front, her worried gaze fixing on Harry's face. She still looked the calmest. "Leave it to me," she said, pushing Ron's hands away. As Harry continued writhing on the bed, looking as if he was having trouble breathing, she mumbled "I'm sorry," and landed a hard smack on Harry's face.
Hello, again!
"I see," said Draco, lost in thought. "How could I learn about how it works?"
The questions occupying Draco's mind never left, not even for one moment during the whole day. He was wondering how he made it into the dream. He didn't know if Harry was aware of it. After all, Harry was the one who grabbed his hand, and then Draco found himself in his dream. Maybe Harry knew, but he was trying to act as nothing happened. The uncertainty was bothering Draco more with every passing minute.
"I've stuff to do," Draco replied without pausing and looking at them. They said some more stuff behind him but he took no notice. When he entered the room, Harry was at his desk. He lifted his head to look at Draco momentarily, then turned back to his homework. This was good for Draco. He put his heavy bag on the bed and changed quickly. As soon as he put on his pajamas, he sat cross-legged on his bed, took the book that looked the oldest, and opened the page about dreams.
"Damn it, Potter! Do whatever you want, I'm gonna go to sl-" when he tried to pull back before he could comprehend it, Harry's hand grabbed his own. Then everything happened so fast.
After getting in bed, he studied at the Marauder's Map for some time. It had become a habit, he had to see that there was no danger lurking around in school. There was something he couldn't get used to in the map: seeing his name and Draco's so close to one another. Following Draco's name on the map had become an obsession during the sixth year, and now he couldn't help but find his name, even though he was in the bed right across his...
When he returned to his room late at night after idling around in the common room, Draco was awake. He was in bed, reading something. Harry ignored him, walked to his own side, and took care of the silencing charm first. He couldn't risk experiencing the same thing again. He was used to the nightmares, he could take care of himself. He didn't want to worry his friends and wake them all up.
Everything progressed so fast during the remainder of the dream as if the time was on fast forward. Draco recognized the snake, he knew who it belonged to. Then the man added something to the cauldron. With the time skips in the dream, Draco couldn't figure out what had happened. As he grew more worried, he felt an intense pain in his right elbow. Immediately after, Draco saw him. Lord Voldemort.
"Pot-"
"Don't worry, I was just curious. I am not up to anything bad."
When Harry woke up in the morning, he didn't feel any different. It was the start of an ordinary morning after another night filled with nightmares, the usual. It was different for Draco though. He wasn't able to sleep all night. He couldn't fall asleep from thinking about how he made it into Harry's dream, what he saw there, what he felt. When the morning came, he had no choice but to leave his bed.
"I'm fine, don't worry. Go back to sleep."
"Damn it," he grumbled and sat up, once again. When he saw that Harry was still writhing on the bed, he got up, walked over to his side. After three steps, the silence slowly started to fade. He could feel the pain in Harry's breathing and his much quieter groans. That was enough for him to decide, he was going to wake him up. If Harry asked him why, he was just going to say the charm hadn't worked and he was woken up by the noise.
the Triwizard Cup. The second his fingers touched it, he felt the jerk, which meant the Portkey had worked. As Harry and Cedric's dead body were sucked into the wind and color, Draco felt like his insides were being sucked in too. When the scene cleared up, he found himself in his room. He was standing next to Harry, and his hand was free.
The voice felt familiar, and he wanted to look. He was successful this time, but he saw something - no, someone he wasn't expecting: Cedric Diggory. He was in front of him in his clothes from Triwizard Tournament. There was a cup right in front of them. Draco heard Harry's voice.
"Whatever," grumbled Ron. "Anyway, you try to sleep. See you in the morning."
When he entered the common room, he saw his friends sitting on the leather couch, but he paid them no mind and headed for the dorms.
"Looks like you have a question, Malfoy."
Harry struggled, but finally made it to Cedric's body, and
His feet continued to step back anxiously, his legs had no strength, and once the back of his knees hit the bed he couldn't stand up anymore. He sat down, eyes still fixed on Harry. For the first time in his life, Draco pitied Harry, and he didn't know how this would change the way he saw him.
Draco, who had been watching since Harry entered the room, couldn't help the way his eyes kept moving over to him even after Harry fell asleep. He knew he wouldn't be able to hear anything since Harry put the charm, and he was curious if he was having nightmares. Grumbling to himself, he tried to focus on the book in his hands but when he failed, he put the book aside, starting to study the room. What was there to study? His own side was very tidy and orderly. Harry's side though... it was a view that Draco hated to look at. All of his stuff was just thrown around, half of his suitcase was peeking out from under his bed... half of the Gryffindor scarf was in the suitcase, the other half on the floor. All of the books were messy. There was no order at all.
Draco couldn't make sense of the ridiculous situation, but he decided that he didn't want to learn the details. He closed the subject of socks and started another one. "You seemed to be having a nightmare," he said, buttoning up his shirt. Harry kept quiet, so he continued. "What was it about?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"See you, thank you. I think you are the reason why my cheek is aching, Hermione." Hermione gave an apologetic smile and Harry laughed quietly. "Good night."
"Hey, Draco!" called Blaise. "Where were you? Come here!"
Draco lifted his head, shocked, eyes finding Harry. What kind of a bond did they have that Harry was able to pull him into his dream? He could understand Harry feeling alone and needing help, but did he
"Are you going to cry like a baby tonight too, Potter?" With this sentence, everybody got quiet, eyes finding the owner of the voice. It was Pansy, coming from the direction of the dorms. As she walked towards the leather couch on the other side of the common room, she had a condescending smile on her face. "If yes, tell us. We can prepare to make sure your nightmares don't wake us up."
"Calm down, mate." Ron tried to explain right away. "You were having a nightmare, you are fine, there's nothing wrong."
"Breathe," reminded Hermione. Then she gave him a glass of water.
"Harry!" said Ron, running to the bed. "Wake up, mate! Wake up!" He grabbed Harry's shoulders and started to shake him lightly. "You are having a nightmare, everything is alright, mate. Come on."
Even though he noticed that Draco was awake, Harry started to get ready, ignoring him. After putting on his pants he started to look through his socks.
"Are you unaware of the rules of courtesy, Potter?"
He didn't know what to do. When he was about to call out to Harry, the door opened. First Ron entered, followed by Neville and Seamus.
Then, Harry was pulled up to his feet before he could react, and he was dragged by a man in a cloak. With the help of the light coming from the tip of the man's wand, he could read 'Tom Riddle' on the gravestone he was pushed towards. With the ropes that the man conjured, he was tied to the gravestone from his neck down to his ankles. Draco wished for Harry's resistance to be enough. He wished for him to break free.
He had to sleep. But, he had to try his luck in case Harry started to have nightmares again. With a sudden decision, he took his wand, modified Harry's silencing charm, and made it cover the whole room. This way, the sounds would not reach outside of the room, but Draco would be able to hear him. Satisfied with the result, he turned to his bed, put the book in his bag in case Harry saw it, and got into bed, giving in to sleep. Tomorrow, he was going to look into this bond-nonsense once again and possibly see that what happened to him was nothing like what was written in the book.
As he suffered the excruciating pain, the laughter of the people around him got louder. Draco thought this was a pathetic and ridiculous sight. They were torturing a fourteen-year-old, defenseless child, and enjoying it. To top it all, Voldemort was telling him that he was going to give him the chance to fight.
Positive reasons? POSITIVE REASONS? He had a bond with Harry, and it was a positive one, huh? Draco wanted to laugh, but he didn't want to attract Harry's attention, so he held back. Meanwhile, Harry had already taken care of the silencing charm and had moved to his bed.
"Alright, you may leave."
Draco's eyes opened when he heard a pained scream towards five in the morning. With his heart beating wildly in his chest, he sat up in the bed and looked at the direction of the noise. At Harry. In his bed pressed against the opposite wall, he was writhing, his voice was echoing in the room, in the entire dormitory. Draco could see him sweating from his bed. He didn't know what to do as Harry's voice grew louder. He witnessed him having nightmares before, actually, he witnessed it pretty often but this was a first. Usually, Harry would put a silencing charm around his bed. If Draco happened to be awake, he would only see Harry sweating and moving around in bed. He would pay it no mind and continue sleeping.
Draco could no longer tell if this fear belonged to Harry, or himself. He was madly terrified. When Harry broke the connection and started to run, he was terrified. Even though he knew Harry would get away, even though he knew they were in the same room right now, he was terrified.
Then ten more...
As soon as Draco left the class, he headed for the library, almost running. Just like the professor said, he found the bonding spells section and started to look through the books. He looked at the contents, searching for the word 'dream'. Almost fifty books later and he still hadn't found the type of book he needed. But he didn't intend to give up so easily.
"I'm sorry," mumbled Harry. "I forgot to do the charm before falling asleep."
Draco took a deep breath and approached the professor's desk, standing in front of her. "Yes, professor," he said calmly. "There is something I am curious about."
He looked through ten more books.
"I'm sure," Harry smiled, hoping to be persuasive. "Go on, don't stay awake any longer." Then he pointedly stared at Draco's bed, it was a message, telling his friends to leave.
"Crucio!"
I hope you enjoyed it. ♡
Voldemort's voice was ringing in his head as the scene changed again and again. Draco thought Harry was trying to wake up from his nightmare. It felt like he didn't want to see this, and the scenes kept getting blurry. When he could see clearly again, The Death Eaters had started to arrive. They were kissing the tips of Voldemort's cloak. When the scene changed again, Draco heard his father's voice. At that moment, he felt an intense disgust that was able to drown Harry's feelings. He'd seen his father obeying him before, but after what had happened, after the war, Draco's had a drastic change of mind.
"When have I ever said no to that?"
"You scared us, Harry, your voice echoed in the whole dormitory." Neville placed a hand on his shoulder and squeezed. "Do you feel better?"
Harry, his bed, everything else in the room, disappeared in a black mist. Draco was outside now, somewhere he didn't recognize. He tried looking around to figure out where he was but he couldn't; it was as if he didn't have control of his own body.
"Potter," he said at first, standing two steps away from the bed. "Potter. Wake up." When Harry didn't react, he got closer and stood right above the bed. "Potter. Get out of that damn nightmare and wake up. I don't know what bullshit you are dreaming about but I don't care, wake up."
Harry couldn't sleep at all that night. Actually, he didn't. He didn't take the risk by trying to sleep, he didn't want to have another nightmare. When it was morning, he paid special attention to Draco's demeanor to see if he witnessed what happened that night. When he decided that nothing had changed, he went down to breakfast, relieved. After a busy day, the night came, and he met up with his friends in the common room. The eighth-years' common room had a very different atmosphere compared to the common rooms of the houses. Despite the new actions taken to unite the houses, there were still people grouping together, especially Slytherin and Gryffindor students.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Whatever," he whispered and sat down on his bed, putting on his socks. Draco was watching him carefully.
was enough for Draco to tense up.
"Are you sure? We can hang out in the common room if you want."
, his heart was beating at his ears. Just to be safe, he looked up at Harry. Once he saw that the other was still busy with his homework, he turned his attention back to the book.
This time, Harry's confused eyes found Draco. "Huh?" he said reflexively. "I thought I misheard." He shrugged. "Good morning to you too, Malfoy. What's up? Did you see me in your dream?"
After transfiguration class ended, he waited for everyone else to leave. Professor McGonagall noticed that Draco was idling around on purpose, and she started to wait instead of leaving. When they were finally alone, Draco looked like he couldn't bring himself to ask, so she spoke first.
"Wow..."
"I know your eyesight is bad, but don't you think it's a problem that you can't differentiate between mismatching socks?" asked Draco.
Harry was uncomfortable with the subject. "What is it to you?" he said with a glare. "It is none of your business, Malfoy. You and your friends can find something else to have fun with, something other than my nightmares."
As he reflexively took a step back, he noticed that he was shaking. His chest was heaving, he was gasping for breath. Harry was still asleep, and his face was completely wet from tears and sweat. Draco had no idea what just happened, how he was sucked into Harry's dream, but he hated it. Even though his body didn't hurt at the moment, there was no way to explain the pain, the despair, the anger, and the fear he felt in the dream. And these feelings didn't even belong to him.
"I'm listening."
"Mind your business, Draco," he mumbled to himself. He looked away from Harry and placed his book on the bedside table, putting his head on his pillow and closing his eyes. He didn't care about Harry's nightmares. He tried to convince himself of that, but he failed.
"Look it up, Malfoy. Now, if you excuse me, I have a business I should attend to."
"Hermione!"
I wrote this fanfiction in my own language that is not English. I will be paying for all chapters' translation. That's why I don't know how often I will update the story.
"I'm aware that they are mismatching," said Harry, putting on the second socks on his feet. Then he looked at his feet and smiled to himself.
When he decided that his eyes were tired enough, he folded the map and put it under his pillow. Then he put aside his wand and glasses, closing his eyes. He was hoping that it'd be a comfortable night without any nightmares. He did that every night, though. Sometimes it worked, but most of the time, he was just disappointed.
"I don't care about her," he shrugged. "How about chess, Ron?"
Voldemort was talking about how he came back. He explained how Harry stopped him in the previous years and how they made it to this night. Then he made Harry, therefore Draco, feel intense pain.
"Good morning."
At that moment Draco figured out why he wasn't able to control his body. He couldn't because this wasn't his body. He was in Harry's dream, in Harry's body. And most importantly; he couldn't communicate with his own body and didn't know how to return to his room. He was overwhelmed by these feelings he couldn't figure out. Worry, fear, excitement. Whatever Harry felt at that moment; he felt it all.
"Could you be more specific?" asked Professor, curious.
"Pansy," it was Draco who interrupted her from his place at the leather couch. "Come."
"Don't be ridiculous," said Ron immediately.
Pansy sat down next to Theodore, angry. Gryffindors had pleased smiles on their faces. Especially Ron looked very happy. He walked up to Harry and whispered, "That was good,"
The first time he decided that returning for the 8th year was a bad idea; was when he found out that he had to be roommates with him. He didn't care that the male was a good person now - Draco was the symbol of the past he hated to remember, the past that caused these nightmares. Draco was an ex-Death Eater who tried to kill Dumbledore. Harry hadn't forgotten how the male saved his life in the Malfoy Mansion. He knew Draco wasn't an evil person like all the other Death Eaters. Still, he hated having to see him every morning and night, during classes and in the dining hall, in the common rooms, practically everywhere. During the month they had to put up with each other, they hadn't had a fight, but they hadn't really communicated either. They didn't talk. Their eyes didn't meet in the room, they didn't directly communicate, they didn't even greet each other. It was as if there was a silent agreement between them. And they abided by the agreement by ignoring each other.
Despite him being one of the people who deserved peace the most, he couldn't get rid of the shadow of the past. In his nightmares, he relived the war from five months ago, and all the bad things that happened to him until the war. He couldn't stop it, no matter how badly he wanted to. When he was awake, he was the hero who led the war, but the moment he fell asleep, he turned into a helpless child. And one thing that made everything worse was Draco Malfoy being his roommate.
He saw Voldemort sending a message through the Dark Mark. His view darkened, and then lightened again. This time, Voldemort was talking.
"Couldn't stop being the Saviour for a single bloody minute, Potter?" he spat.
Harry repeats the same examination he gave Gertrude last week, though it’s quite a bit more challenging with Bertha’s size. Harry needs to use both hands to check her spine and underbelly, but sure enough, there’s a nice, rabbit-sized lump.
Harry swallowed, trying to come up with an answer. “We’ve, er… we’ve been keeping it quiet, didn’t want to cause a fuss with Mal— Draco still on trial here.”
Potter’s smile was strained as he turned to Draco, softly held his chin, and leaned up to kiss him.
“College?” Malfoy wrinkles his nose in confusion.
“Yeah, mate, we know.” Ron comes across and sits on Harry’s other side. His two friends wrap their arms around him.
, I don’t want to ruin our friendship, just give me a bit of time to get over you-”
He stood up and waited for Draco to follow suit, then left. When they got to their room, Harry sat down on the bed. Draco quietly closed the bedroom door and walked over to sit down next to him.
Harry grins. He can’t wait for Saturday.
“Shit. That’s terrible.”
Pansy makes a noise of annoyance, then sighs, then gives a small smile. "I've slept with six of the people at this table. Two of them were atrocious. One of them was excellent." The smile turns into a smirk.
Draco started walking towards the Ministry lift, when a strong hand grabbed his arm and pulled him into a closet.
Harry lets out a sharp breath. “No, you don’t.”
Harry Potter enjoyed being alive.
“I don’t know if I ever hated you. I definitely didn’t like you. But things changed.” Harry took another deep breath to steel himself. “Things changed when we kissed. When you bonded with Molly. When we saw each other naked.”
“I’m up anyways,” Malfoy explained once. “Might as well have company.”
“What?”
“Do we have to play their games?” Pansy cuts in. “As long as we’re getting to know each other, couldn’t we do our own games?”
Harry pushed the door open so hard it slammed against the wall. Draco jumped from his seat, and so did Gilbertson.
“Alright, now you’re going to be answering questions. Your answers must be one line, with no context given.” Betsy picks up the microphone and heads down to the floor. “First question: why are you a teacher?”
” Draco shrieked, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck in a death grip.
“I didn’t really think much of it at the time, since I was a bit caught up on the fact that we were

have done is run away. Which you did.”
Draco grinned at Harry, then turned back to Gilbertson. “Looking forward to the investigation!”
Potter bites his lip, and Draco has to look away. “I dare you…” Potter sounds almost nervous. “I dare you to go to the Yule Ball with me.”
“Oh, she’s fine,” Draco replies. “I just thought you might want to take a look at her magic, like you did the others. And no,” he smirks. “You haven’t seen
Harry draws his eyebrows together. “Known what?”
“It’s going to be okay,” Harry tells him softly, briefly touching Malfoy’s arm. “We’ll figure it out. Why don’t you take a seat?”
Potter,” Malfoy replies. “Your assistant refuses to help me.”
“They found out about the op.”
“Stalking me, Malfoy?” Harry asks without bite. He tries not to think about the irony of the question.
“Ron. What are you saying?”
They’ve been dating for four months when Harry suggests he move in. And it’s soon, but it doesn’t really feel like moving fast, it just feels like it’s time. Draco agrees.
Draco slipped away as quietly as he came, leaving earshot of the conversation.
“Yeah, I’d noticed, thank you,” Malfoy cuts him off. “We can Transfigure it into two beds at night. Can’t allow the Muggle housekeepers to see them like that, though.”
Draco smiles as he sits down and they place their orders.
“Obviously not, I just - sorry, nevermind.” Harry’s face is warm. Padma looks at him strangely, but doesn’t follow up, instead getting the group activity started.
"Got it in one!" Pansy shouts. Then, she lowers her voice. "Four of them were atrocious." And then she
“Good,” Draco replies. Potter’s already fought enough dark wizards. He deserves a calm, quiet life.
“Malfoy, he’s not discriminating against you,” Harry sighs. “And wasn’t the entire Wizarding veterinary community discriminating against you? You weren’t mad about that.”
him. This is discrimination, plain and simple.”
to discriminate against me,” Malfoy counters. Harry makes to argue, but Malfoy cuts him off. “Your
, sending me snake puns, giving Dave all your money-”
“Well, Malfoy came in today,” Harry replies.
“I have nightmares too,” he finally settles on. “Mostly of getting the Mark. Sometimes the faces in our dungeon. But most nights I can’t sleep anyway.”
Everything is going just fine up until December. It’s the last social before the Yule Ball. Draco doesn’t have a date, but he doesn’t really mind, he’s actually looking forward to going with the other eighth years, as a group. And Potter doesn’t have a date, either. So at least he won’t be the only single one.
“Uh, sure. Yeah. Okay.” Harry’s more than thrown off. He’s completely lost.
Malfoy turned and smiled at him, and Harry’s heart squeezed. They stood there watching the sunset in silence for several minutes, until the boat started jerking in the water, turning upwards and shifting down aggressively.
One of the nights, Harry can’t help but grab Malfoy’s arm, where he knows the scars are. They don’t say anything. Harry just holds his forearm, gently, like it’s going to break. And when he lets go, Malfoy makes a stupid joke about three wizards and a pub and it’s like it never happened.
Harry laughed in earnest at that. And then laughed again as Malfoy stumbled up, walking away from the table with nonexistent sea legs. Malfoy was definitely… better. Kinder. Funnier. And somehow, knowing that made Harry’s stomach turn a little.
“Eleanor looks fine to me,” Harry says. “If you’re really concerned, you could give me a few memories of her doing the behavior, but it’s up to you.”
Eleanor replies.
Potter takes a step towards him, then another. He’s so close. Too close. Draco can feel his warm breath on him. Draco should turn around. Back away. And then Potter leans forward, slowly, and before Draco can register what he’s doing, Potter’s left a soft kiss on his cheek.
The program leaders usher everyone out of the bar at ten, way too early for Harry to be as drunk as they are. Draco’s swaying beside them, too, because Malfoy somehow became Draco after spitting tequila on the bartender, and he grabs onto Harry’s arm for balance. They stumble into the lift together and over to their room.
“I’m surprised you’re not mad about the money thing,” Harry says, leading Malfoy to Exam Room B.
“How was I supposed to see you, lurking behind that corner like that? What are you, stalking me?”
“God, I think Parkinson and I might actually get along,” Harry laughs, only stopping when their food arrives.
,” Harry says firmly after their waiter comes over to check on them and gives them an odd look. “I didn’t really know what to do, so Hermione made a list of things I’m good at. Parseltongue was on there, and I just kind of thought. Why not?”
You gave my money to that imbecile?!”
“Deep, Potter,” Malfoy drawls.
Harry mumbles something that you don’t catch. “What?”
“She never told me about that. Did she stop by at all afterwards?”
Bertha replies.
Draco clears his throat. “For everything, I mean. For being a dick to you all those years. For being… a Death Eater. There’s no excuse, I know, and you don’t need to forgive me, I just… I did what I thought was right. Which I now know was the exact opposite of right.”
Potter huffs out a half-laugh. “After the trial? You mean, when you
Potter grimaced. “I’m sure no one wants to hear that.”
Harry catches Draco’s eyes, and Draco just smirks at them. But the
Harry’s too drunk to second guess themself. Taking their shoes off, Harry slips into the sheets. “Padma doesn’t have to deal with this.”
“That’s enough,” Draco murmured in his ear. And turning towards their group, he yelled, “Potter needs to go home. We’ll see you on Monday.”
Padma orders them all another round, but Harry’s barely paying attention. They talk for hours about the monotony of lectures, how there are two more days until the weekend, how they’re all going to change up the curriculum from their Hogwarts days, and Draco uses
“I like you too.”
Ron punched him lightly on the shoulder. “Go get him, then.”
“Do you regret it, then?”
They skip Friday night dinner this week, since the Ministry is holding a charity gala. Rose is staying with Molly for the night, and Harry waits for Hermione and Ron to finish getting ready so they can head over together. Harry usually brings Luna as his date to these events, but Ginny’s got a game tonight so Luna’s off in the stands cheering her on.
“All good,” Hermione replies, not turning away from the stove. “Almost ready.”
. It was almost unbelievable.
“The opposite?” He raises an eyebrow. “So, you like me too much?”
“She thinks because the Muggles who raised you treated you terribly, you have terrible self worth, or something. Is that why you agreed to faking this engagement with me?” He tried to make the question sound sarcastic.
They rushed to the fireplace and Flooed right to the Ministry.
Harry comes through Ron and Hermione’s Floo to see Rose running around in her diaper and Ron chasing after her. Harry takes in the scene, scooping Rose up into his arms with a chuckle.
He’s holding out hope that maybe… maybe Pansy and Greg didn’t know about it. Maybe they really are still his friends.
. But if the boat sinks, I am blaming
“But, couldn’t he have just gone to a Muggle vet then?” Ron cuts in. “I mean, a vet that’s actually a Muggle?”
“Why do you keep coming here?” Harry asks one day, unable to hold it in any longer. He’s seen nearly ten of Malfoy’s snakes, and it doesn’t seem like there’s an end. “Nothing’s wrong with the snakes. I think you know that.”
“I’m sorry for using your name to get out of exile. I’m sorry for siding with Voldemort. I’m sorry for… for everything I said to you and your friends back at school. I’m sorry for—”
By the time Harry makes it back to the room, the lights are off, and Malfoy appears to be sleeping. Harry gets ready for bed as quickly and quietly as he can.
“No, I heard you, why?”
“At least I have the common fucking decency not to
“So, what do you do for a living? Besides giving away all your money to charity. And to Dave.”
“Apparently, because I’m not a lightweight,” Harry replies, smiling softly and looking pointedly at Draco. His hair is mussed for once, and he looks… more human. Harry hands him a cup of coffee.
After a while, Potter speaks again. “Look, Malfoy, you clearly don’t want to be here. Do you want to just go back to the common room?”
“Yeah,” Harry replies. “See, I have this big stupid crush on you, and she thought if I dared you then you’d go, and I was thinking, maybe I could dance with you, and maybe ask you out.” Harry sighs. “But with our truth or dare crowd, of course daring you was basically forcing you to go with me, and I would never want to force you to do anything, ever, I just… like you. A lot.”
Potter’s emerald eyes are stark against his brown skin and he looks as breathless as Draco feels, until something shuts in his face and he stands up. “Dare completed,” Potter snaps. “Hope you all enjoyed the show.” And he stomps away to the dormitories. A door slams shut.
"Yes," Granger nods. Draco can barely believe they've worked together on something. "So we've created a petition that we hope everyone will sign, and then I'll bring it to Healer Vincent. We'll still do socials when they're scheduled, and work on inter-house unity, but here in our common room instead of in the Great Hall with the entire school."
The first bite was delicious, and it only got better from there. Malfoy appeared to be enjoying the meal just as much as Harry, groaning and humming to himself as he chewed and only looking warily at the water every few minutes.
“What the—”
even though he was literally trying to kill you-”
“You know people love, you, right?” It’s all you can get out. Harry’s eyes are fluttering shut.
the Slytherin thing is the lie," Malfoy drawls, finally participating. "At least give us a challenge."
Because he wanted to know more about Potter. Because he wanted to understand what made him who he was. Because studying Potter was all he’d done since he was a child. “I don’t know,” Draco replied. “I just do.”
Dave’s grimace. “I’ll have to check Dr. Potter’s availability.”
Draco leans his elbows on the table and raises his eyebrows. “Do tell,” he says.
Harry had to show that the hand kiss was friendly. So Harry turned, grabbed Ron’s hand, and kissed it too.
“Yeah, we went to school together. What’s wrong?”
He doesn’t sleep.
Potter sighed. “Yeah. The Weasleys are good at that.”
It’s nearly six in the morning when there’s a soft knock on the door. Harry walks quietly to open it, trying not to wake Ron.
Dave looks between the two of them. “Exam Room A is available, Dr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy, it may benefit you to have our office number. It’s much easier on Dr. Potter if you have an appointment-”
But Harry was already walking around the table, kissing every auror’s hand. When he moved to start kissing strangers’ hands, he was pulled backwards.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy,” the Chief Warlock announced. “For the crimes of Conspiring Against the State, Aiding and Abetting Death Eaters, and the Use of Unforgivable Curses, you have been found guilty. However, this court believes you acted out of necessity, not cruelty. Therefore, the court has decided that you will not be sent to Azkaban. You will instead be exiled from this country. You will be free, but you will be barred from ever entering Britain again.”
“So why are you really becoming a teacher?” Malfoy sounds genuinely curious. “Didn’t you just finish up Auror training?”
“I’m in charge of the investigation into your engagement.” Gilbertson looked smug.
“And?”
Harry wakes up nearly every night with a nightmare. Sometimes he’s screaming, and Ron’s shaking him awake. Sometimes he just wakes up in a cold sweat, and heads to the common room to avoid waking Ron up. Sometimes he sits on the common room floor for hours, short of breath, trying to remind himself that it’s over. That he’s safe now. Ron’s safe. Hermione’s safe.
“I’m glad to hear it! Now, you two follow me. I’m going to show you the most romantic spot on the ship.”
so how are they supposed to deal with this
“I mean, my practice isn’t incredibly busy, is it? I only work with snakes,” Harry says. “I don’t mind if you just walk in, but Dave- well, Dave’s an administrative purist. He’d want appointments even if I only had one client.”
It was Draco’s first time joining the aurors’ yearly tradition of Christmas Eve drinks, and Harry was already losing his composure. It didn’t help that he’d already had six drinks, and Draco looked like sex on legs.
Harry doesn’t know what Draco’s doing. But he’s here, and Harry needs to be the Gryffindor that he is, and be honest about... well, everything.
“I’m not staring at you,” Harry defends.
And Harry is baffled, but grateful, to have him there.
lose his other ear, but we got it back on fine; it was just a charm done wrong…”
“No! I didn’t even have snakes then,” Draco replies, looking steadfastly at his empty plate. “I thought it was…” and then he mumbles something Harry can’t hear.
And now that he
“Ron and Hermione know the relationship is fake, but everyone else needs to think it’s real. I love Molly to death, but she can’t keep a secret to save her life, and I’m not close enough to anyone else to ask them to keep this quiet. Got it?” Potter’s brow narrowed as he waited for Draco’s confirmation.
“Harry!” Draco hits his hands against the table and grins. “That’s incredible!”
“Ugh, I know, right? I can’t believe I don’t get a single year at Hogwarts without him.”
Harry starts going to class again. He tries to pretend everything’s the same. He goes to the library with Ron and Hermione. He does the bare minimum on his homework. He eats his meals in the Great Hall.
Neville, Dean, and Seamus are already seated when they arrive, but students from the other houses slowly trickle in. Hannah Abbott. Ernie MacMillan. Anthony Goldstein. Malfoy slips in last, along with Pansy Parkinson, Goyle, and Blaise Zabini. Every eighth year is at the table, but instead of mixing in like they’re supposed to, they’ve grouped themselves by house.  Everyone seems to feel just as awkward as Harry to be all together, even if they are still next to their own houses. Harry wonders if Vince is going to make them change seats, but then the first activity is announced and they all have to get up anyways.
Malfoy gnaws at his bottom lip, glancing at his snake in worry. “But, you know snakes, surely it can’t be too different?”
“And you’re aware that lying about Wilkie’s Law could result in a six month stint in Azkaban?” Gilbertson looked smug.
Betsy starts the teachers off Monday morning with their first activity. Harry’s relieved he doesn’t have to listen to another lecture, but also, that means… Malfoy.
When the tables were cleared, the guests went right back to their shouting and mingling and boisterousness around the house. Draco found himself caught in a conversation with some Weasley great-aunt, who was assaulting him with a long tale about a rabbit she found in her garden.
“Malfoy, wait!” Draco doesn’t stop. “Malfoy please, just- Draco-”
“You’re alive now,” Draco says, feeling like he needs to remind him of this fact. “The people you love are, too.”
Draco snaps back into focus. “No,” he replies evenly. Potter heaves a sigh of relief. They sit in silence again, but this time it’s almost companionable.
It was too dark in the closet to read Potter’s face, but he seemed to back off just slightly.
“Yes. Oh.”
Malfoy was still looking out at the sunset. With the golden sky highlighting his pale features, he looked… beautiful. “Can’t we stay just a little longer?” Malfoy asked.
“Hey- wait!” Potter jogs after him. “Let me at least walk you back.”
---------------------------------------
Harry can only shrug helplessly. The damage has been done. He waves his hand at the walls. He doesn’t know how Malfoy didn’t notice the snake jokes and cartoons last time.
Something warm starts curling up in Harry’s chest as he realizes. “You called me Harry.”
“Ugh,” Draco grumbles. “Why do you look so happy?”
“Not sure,” Harry replied. “I know the guy heading it, though, and he’s a real piece of work.”
“Okay. Let’s go.”
“A rather traumatic experience for Professor Sprout, I’m afraid.” Harry tries to shrug casually, but he’s still mortified. Draco bursts out laughing.
Betsy, the purple-haired woman in charge, lectures for most of the day. They stop for a lunch break only to continue with more presentations and lectures. Harry’s eyes are drained from staring at the screen for so long. After the participants are given dinner, Harry and Malfoy return to their room.
“Seven it is,” Harry replies, smiling back.
It’s not like you didn’t suspect. You’re his auror partner, after all; you’ve seen the bags under his eyes. You’ve seen the way he throws himself into danger without considering his own safety. You’ve seen how he crumples after reporters shove themselves in his face, how he turns into a shell of himself every Halloween, how he forces a smile every time Weasley walks into your shared office.
“You-” Draco stops. “
“Draco,” he got out.
“Dr. Potter, you can’t just give me this-”
“Oh my goodness, I didn’t know!” Hermione exclaims. “Oh, I’m terrible, I’ve even read books about nonbinary genders, and here I am just assuming pronouns.” She puts her face in her hands.
They’ve taken to spending time together in the daytime, too. Draco can’t help but notice Potter’s strong hands as they repot plants in Herbology. The flex of his forearms as they race each other on the Quidditch pitch. The way Potter’s eyes close when he’s laughing too hard. The way he’s all grumpy in the morning, until Draco shoves a coffee his way. The way he snaps at younger students for looking at Draco in a bad way. The way he still needs to save everyone and everything, from a first year student who’s afraid to fly to Draco himself, when he gets stuck in the mud on the way back from Care of Magical Creatures.
The lights of the spells from Harry and Voldemort's wands were tied to one another with a golden thread. Then some grey stuff, like smoke, started coming out of Voldemort's wand, accompanied by echoing screams of pain. The ghosts of the people killed by Voldemort's wand were appearing one by one. Cedric, Bertha Jorkins, an old man, Harry's parents... They started to give Harry instructions.
“ Pans give him time to comprehend and answer before you go to the next question” Blaise said as he stretched out and threw his feet in Blakes lap. Blake gave the leather covered feet a glare and pushed them out of his lap.
“How about we go hang out in our rooms. A lot of people in here tonight” he said but had a happy glint in his eyes. Draco inwardly groaned at that, guess groveling started now he thought. The four friends made their way up to Blaise and Blakes room. Once there Blaise said, “ballerina” and laughed, Blake went red and rolled his eyes. Apparently his was an inside joke of theirs, once inside Draco was a little jealous. The room was twice the size of his, it had Slytherin green walls, two four poster beds with black curtains pulled back, across the room from each other. Each bed had a side table and next to the beds were tall dark wardrobes. On the far side wall were two dark desks to match. You could tell whose side was whose by the way the area was kept. One bed was perfectly made and everything in place perfectly down to the quills and papers lined up on the desk. The other side was a completely different story the bed was made but done so in a hasty mess like a five year old would make it. The trunk at the end of the bed was thrown open and different cloths and knickknacks were thrown about. The desk was strewn with books, papers, quills, and even candy that was half finished. But what caught his eye was the knitted red blanket on the messy bed that had a gold snitch on it.
“No more blood purity bullshit,” Malfoy agreed, and he looked serious about it. Harry couldn’t help but smile.
All of the pairs hobble their way into an adjoining banquet room, which is emptied of chairs but filled with… equipment of some kind. The helpers move the pairs into two lines, and Malfoy and Harry hobble over where they’re directed, slowly falling into the rhythm of moving their adjoined legs together.
“Not a house made for one wizard?”
Eleanor hisses.
“Ha, ha.” Malfoy rolled his eyes, but he looked amused. “What are my pet peeves?”
“I’ve been meaning to apologize to you.”
------------------------------------------------
him,” a deeper voice — Arthur Weasley’s — retorted. “You think it’s a coincidence the engagement gets announced the same day the boy uses Wilkie’s Law to get out of exile? He’s using Harry.”
They don’t talk about the nightmares anymore, not since the first night, but Draco knows Potter is still getting them. Some nights, Potter just sits on the floor in silence, unresponsive to anything Draco says. Some nights he rubs Potter’s back until his breathing eases, until he falls asleep. At first, Draco tries hard to ignore the flutters he gets when Potter’s eyes shutter closed and his face is completely peaceful.
There’s a crate in front of them next that they have to hop on and get over. Malfoy moves first, sticking his left foot on top, then bringing their combined legs up next. Malfoy steps his left leg down, and Harry stands fully on top of the box – but when Malfoy moves to bring their combined legs to the floor, he moves too fast, and Harry’s pulled down with their legs.
“Well, I’ll get next time, then,” Harry insists. Malfoy blushes at that, and Harry’s stomach twists into a knot. He’s starting to think that he might be in trouble.
“Well, bye, then,” Harry says awkwardly, cringing at himself. Draco looks… disappointed? Harry gives a quick wave and apparates home.
“Malfoy, you know it’s a good thing to get the snakes looked at regularly, right? They should definitely have at least annual appointments to evaluate their health. You don’t need to pretend something’s wrong just to have me do an exam.”
Draco looks out into the hallway, checking to see if anyone’s there. There’s no one.
“That was a talk about being
Harry James Potter is not without their flaws. But with Draco by their side, they’re coming to understand who they are as a person. And Harry knows that who they are is not a flaw. Not even close.
the reason Harry didn’t feel comfortable enough to tell us about Draco. We are his
“Mm. Good.”
Potter gets on his knees and starts picking up Draco’s spilled books and quills. After a moment of hesitation, Draco joins him, and they shuffle in to the common room together once everything’s been shoved back in his bag.
“Good morning! Are you two decent?” She knocked again.
, it’ll take you to their main office, and they’ll board you right away. The boat leaves in ten minutes; you’ve got plenty of time.”
“Did what? Liked you?”
Draco gave Potter a quick panicked glance, and he seemed just as uneasy, but Potter nodded. “Sure, Molly, that’s fine.”
“Harry, look, it’s nothing to be ashamed of. We’ve known since… fourth year?” She turns to Ron, who nods.
“Rooming alone is a blessing, thank you for asking,” they reply. “No snoring, no awkward small talk, no sharing a bathroom.”
Ron looks confused. “Yeah, mate, we know. We discussed this over a month ago.”
And sometimes the nightmares come. And sometimes there are sleepless nights. But most days, and most nights, Harry is happy, cuddled up with Draco, legs and fingers tangling in time with their hearts. And eighth year turns out to be the best year of his life.
Draco looks in his formal robes, and Draco keeps looking at Harry like he knows exactly what they’re thinking. After they finish eating, Draco pulls them away to the auction tables.
Harry chuckles. Of course Malfoy would’ve gotten a sword as a child. “Hedwig,” he replies, the familiar pang to his heart now soft after all these years. “My old owl.”
Harry threw down the note and sprinted downstairs. Ron was sitting at the kitchen table, and he gave Harry a bewildered look as he rushed in.
“That’s sweet of you, Harry.”
“Shut up, Potter. I’m not getting on the boat.”
“That’s better.” Molly patted the front of her apron, as if forgetting something. “Well, back to the house. Our guests will be here any minute.”
Parkinson's eyes widen in surprise, but she doesn't retort. Hannah goes next, then Ernie, then Blaise Zabini, and then it's Harry's turn.
It’s “Wow, Potter, finally decided to grace us with your presence?” It’s “Hey Potter, ever heard of a comb?” It’s “Do you ever stop eating, Scarhead?”
“What’s wrong with Eleanor, Malfoy?”
“Er, Harry proposed, of course.”
There are a few nods. Granger frowns, but agrees. “Fine. I guess that works.”
Draco cleared his throat uncomfortably. “Yeah. Me too. Thanks.”
can’t remember it. You always do it.”
“Right, but more often than usual.”
“You must be Harry and Draco! Mr Potter, I’d recognize you anywhere, I would have gladly given you and your fiancé a free dinner cruise around the channel, but then with you being Molly’s boy too! Well, it’s just a pleasure to meet you.”
“Setting the standard high,” Ron answers with a chuckle.
“I’m fine, Draco. Can I just… crash here tonight?”
“Like your name.”
Malfoy follows his gesture and begins examining the walls. Harry’s not just going to stand here and watch him. He looks at Bertha, who doesn’t appear to be hyperactive, or viperactive for that matter. “Usually, when a snake is very active, it means they don’t have enough space, or that they’re bored of their enclosure.” Malfoy snaps back towards Harry, clearly about to argue. Harry puts up a hand. “I’m assuming, since you’ve probably had her a while and given your magical abilities, that that’s not the case here. So, she’s probably just hungry.”
“Shut up, Potter.” There’s a smile in Malfoy’s voice.
“You— have feelings for me?” Draco asked, sounding shocked.
“I remember you saying something about asking me out?” Draco’s clearly trying to smirk, but it keeps pulling into a grin.
Harry is ecstatic to get out of that hotel and back to Grimmauld Place. Kreacher is a sight for sore eyes.
“Hm? Oh- they’re uh, nice,” Harry replies, feeling the blood rush to his face. “You’re wearing the clothes.”
“Okay,” Harry decides. “You fancy me.”
“The Wizarding community has a
“Okay, I know you’re not drunk from three beers, so what’s going on?” Draco asks as soon as the door shuts behind him.
“Just curious. What do you talk to them about?”
And it’s… Harry had guessed at something like that. But to hear Malfoy talk about all these options, lay them out there, it’s almost too much for him to hear. Harry clears his throat. “Right. That helps. Thank you.”
But it’s different to hear it out loud. And he said it to
“Oh, yes, I have robes for the occasion. We’ll just be signing our paperwork at the Ministry, though, we didn’t want a big ceremony.”
Harry’s still excited about the retreat. Leaving the Aurors to teach feels… right. Like he’s finally doing something that
"I hope you all enjoyed yourselves!" he shouts. "The next social will be two weeks from now. New activities, new fun!" Harry cringes, but as he walks back to the eighth year common room with the others, he thinks how it wasn't half bad. He kind of enjoyed himself. It isn't until he lays down to sleep that he realizes Malfoy never had a turn for Two Truths.
Draco.
Draco bites his lip, considering. “Dave,” he replies. Harry laughs. They bring Dave up to be with the other snakes, and he seems much more comfortable around them.
But Draco follows them into the lift, then down the hall all the way into their room.
Draco rolls his eyes. “He would say that, wouldn’t he?”
Hermione and Ron don’t come over that Saturday for lunch – instead, Harry meets them at their house before they all leave for the Ministry together.
And he couldn’t let it go. He’d never been able to let anything about Potter go, not since he was a child. “You know, Molly was treating me like I was family. Like I was important to them.”
Someone knocks on their door, and Draco opens it to find the very people he was thinking about. Pansy flounces in and sits next to Greg on his bed, and Granger stands in the doorway holding a clipboard.
“There’s just no
“I dare you,” Draco says, voice husky, “to come to Hogsmeade with me.”
“I most certainly do not.”
After lunch, Molly shooed Harry and Malfoy over to the Floo, claiming she had a surprise for them. “All right, boys. I have a friend over by the coast who runs a line of dinner cruises. I thought, what better way to spend the day before your wedding? After all, Harry told us how much you love boats, Draco, and they're such an important part of your engagement!”
have mentioned - ‘I know firsthand what a difference can be made with the proper love and support-’” Malfoy sighs dramatically, placing his hand over his heart. “This is just touching.”
Draco always looked like sex on legs, if Harry was honest. But normally he could handle it. Normally, he could step away.
The liquor is making Harry’s eyelids heavy. “Hmm? No, I like rooming with you.”
Draco’d never gotten the Dark Mark, which he guessed was why his trial was one of the last. But he didn’t think for a second he’d be getting off free. Not after what he’d done. Been coerced into, sure, but at the time, he’d believed in the cause.
Draco is doing okay, though, all things considered. His grades are second only to Granger, although it’s not as impressive now that there are only fifteen students in their year. The socials are actually becoming enjoyable, and he’s starting to think not only of Potter as a friend, but Granger and the other Gryffindors, too. They’re almost charming, now that their determination and loyalty includes him, instead of being directed against him.
. Harry had noticed them before, how could he not, but now he’s really looking at them, and they’re… the Dark Mark is on his left forearm, but the snake and skull are surrounded by beautifully detailed flowers. There’s no color to them, but somehow they look more realistic than, well, actual flowers. The flowers go all the way up Malfoy’s arm, beyond the sleeve of the t-shirt. His right arm is a sleeve of flowers as well, and Harry wants to see how far they go. If there are more tattoos, under his shirt. Harry realizes with shock- he’s bought Malfoy a shirt, with a snake surrounded by flowers on it. Harry’s bought him a shirt that’s basically mirroring his tattoos. Malfoy’s going to think he was staring at his tattoos-
“ Ron, Hermione, I would like to apologize for my past behavior and the derogatory things I have said to you both. I would like to use this opportunity to do away with all that and start anew” the silence wore on for a few more seconds and he was starting to think maybe Blaise and Pansy had been right and this was a horrible idea. Then Ron stood up and stood in front of Draco almost nose to nose, eyes unreadable, and then the most unexpected thing ever. He grabbed Draco and pulled him into a bear hug that lasted a few seconds. Draco didn’t grimace or pull away he just patted the boy on the back, and stepped away when he was let go of.
“You two are being ridiculous” Blake huffed
“And how do I know he’s even into guys” the other sighed
Draco looked at the potion sadly but stepped forward, he knew he wouldn’t smell anything.
Pansy listened intently through all of this, she had mixed feeling on the thing as a whole. Yes she noticed from the time the boy sat down last night, the shift in Draco, it wasn’t instant but there was something that shifted. She was very protective of her two best friends, ever since they were three, but it got worse with Draco after everything he went through, and losing Harry damn well almost did him in, she was still scared it might. So yes she was worried that Draco had latched on to the first new face he had saw, and yes she noticed those eyes Blake had, more specifically the one eye that was a lone emerald. But at the same time Draco was smart he didn’t latch on to anyone, you had to earn your way to his trust, he thought thoroughly about everyone he let in. Not only that he was a Veela, they were known for good judgement. Just like everyone knew they died when their mate died, but Draco hadn’t. Could Narcissa be right and Draco had been wrong about his mate. But then there was Dracos story of his last minutes with Harry and he knew it was the classic mate bound indicators. She had no answers, and only more questions.
“Darling you have to eat” she whispered to him
Reviews and comments are welcome
As soon as he had turned towards the wall that the bathroom door sat on he saw Blaises eyes go wide and tackle Blake from behind, both falling to the floor. Draco could see the teen under Blaise struggling and made to get up to help.
“Your making a mistake Professor and we both know it” the Italian said softly.
“Get some sleep Draco you need it” the other whispered and started to move away slowly. Draco instantly tightened his grip on the boys’ hand.
“Snape is no medical professional as I’m sure you are aware. So he needs to be looked after properly” Draco was quickly becoming irate.
“That is not going to happen for the simple fact they are to nice to humiliate someone. Now please come out you two have been in there since five. I’m sure you look amazing” he glanced at Draco hoping for some help. The Blond sighed once he didn’t hear a response and did the only thing he knew that would bring them out.
-----------------
“So first we need to know all the stipulations and what we will be able to do and not do.” Hermione started out. Blaise piped in then since he was the only one to know it all.
“You better have a good explanation” she said coldly her brown eyes staring into Blakes. Blaise didn’t say anything, but his look was actually a more threatening. Blake looked at them and his eyes dropped to the table.
The doors were opened and as Draco stepped inside, he felt his heart drop to his stomach. This was the last place he had been with Harry this was the place he had lost his mate. His breaths started to become shallow And labored. Blaise turned around in time to see Draco grab his chest and he ran over and shielded him from the watching eyes of the other students Pansy quickly came around and whispered into Dracos ear reminding him of the breathing exercises to help stabilize him.
Voices could be heard from somewhere far off in the fuzzy part of his brain. Everything was dark but seamed to be coming back slowly. There was an irritating buzzing in his head also that he just wanted to go away. Then it was like a flood gate had opened and everything came rushing back to him. Draco sat up abruptly looking around franticly for the sick boy that had been taken from him.
Blaise didn’t get to answer because at that time Pansy threw the door open and stood to the side as a red faced Ron came stomping in along with a serious Hermione. Pansy mouthed ‘sorry’ to the blond from behind them as they all made their way to Dracos bed and stopped. The two Gryffindors crossed their arms and glared at Draco.
“Isn’t it obvious? Friday we’ll eat meals with the Gryffindor’s, mainly Ron and Hermione. I mean Slytherins making the first move towards friendship looks good not only on you all but the whole house. It might even make the rest of the school feel better coming into contact with the rest of the house” he finished and looked up from his book. The other three looked almost astonished quickly they smiled, and Pansy hugged him.
“I will only say this once and there’s nothing either of you can do to stop it. His ass is ours we will handle this if anything else occurs you need to let us know” he left no room for discussion on the subject.
“You can dance with my sister as long as she wants you to Mr.Zabini, but I think its best if I inform our FATHER of the events, to insure he’s aware of the situation” Harry couldn’t help but let out a small laugh at the wide eyed look Blaise gave him. Ever since Sirius had taken both Harry and Hermione in he had been teaching them the basics of ‘Pure blood etiquette’ and Harry knew what was going to happen. Apparently though Hermione hadn’t caught on. She gave harry a questioning look which didn’t last long because she was pulled away to dance with the boy.
“Whatever you say Mione” he shook his head and followed her to the door and gave her a hug. “Ill see you in an hour”
“Draco Lucius Malfoy as long as I’ve known you I would have figured you were smarter than this. Really threatening teachers and almost getting expelled!” the bushy haired banshee screeched.
After an hour or so Draco had an idea. He pulled out a piece of parchment and wrote on it then flicked his wrist towards Blake. It never made it to the boy because Blaise caught it and read it. He shot Draco a pointed look then wrote a reply and slid it back to Draco.
“Do tell Draco who did you bring back here. And don’t lie I’m sure I already know” Draco snapped his eyes up to his friend and his face went red. Taking pity on his friend he sat on the foot of the bed and leaned against the bed post.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Already picked up on being a brat that got everything he wanted huh”
So Ive had fun writing this so far and I really hope you all are enjoying reading. I would love to hear from you all, thoughts, opinions and such. I forgot to say in the beginning I have no betas so its all me.
“ Yes Mrs.Malfoy” both Blaise and Pansy said at the same time and followed Draco. Shortly after the train departed from the platform.
“As I said Im a veela I found my mate, literally as he was going to fight a damn mad man. I only ever got to hold him once and kiss him once. Then he pushed me away and ran, after that he sacrificed himself for all of the wizarding world. He left me alone, I should have died. Veelas are supposed to die when their mate does, but I guess my punishment for the crimes committed by me and my family was to continue on and live and bear the pain and agony of living without him” by this time tears were falling from Dracos eyes and he just let them fall as he stared at the curtain at the end of the bed. He felt Blake shift and then found himself with the boy almost in his lap and his head on his chest as he embraced him.
“You like to see me blush” he repeated and gave Draco an accusing look. The blonde sighed and hid his face in the soft raven locks.
I stood at the bottom of those dreaded stairs again, and like last time I looked up and was met with raven black hair, matted with dirt grim and blood. Like last time Harry descended the stairs to the last step and came to a sudden stop once he saw Draco standing there gazing at him. I felt my throat go tight with the promise of tears to follow when I met those beautiful emerald eyes. I had missed them so much, watching all of Harrys emotions dance through them easily. Harry stood there gazing back but unlike last time he smiled a warm sweet smile at me, then held his hand out to me. I took his hand and pulled him to me wrapping one arm around his slim waist and brought my other hand up to cradle his cheek, he leaned into it and closed his eyes. I brought my forehead down to rest against his and his smile grew wider. We stayed like that for awhile just enjoying the moment then Harry pulled back and looked up at me and his smile faded but he didn’t pull away.
“You think Im pretty, Im flattered” Draco fluttered his eyes at Blake
“Im assuming you all are part of this deal” she said with a smile then walked up to Blaise and hugged him, then Pansy, who looked like she could have died happy right then, then Blake. Ron followed behind and did the same besides, he finished with Blaise. When he pulled away Blaise automatically grabbed his wrist and pulled him down on the bench with him and started jabbering on about quidditch. Draco sat down across from Blaise and Ron and pulled Blake down next to him so there was no choice but for Hermione to sit with Pansy. The group settled into some comfortable chit chat here and there. Blaise and Pansy mainly taking up the time with the Gryffindors while Draco and Blake softly spoke to one another.
Draco started shaking at that last question. His breath started coming shorter and shorter, his chest constricting. He scribbled down a hasty ‘Yes and he’s dead’ then forced himself out of his seat and ran out of the room. Blake jumping up just as he ran out the door. Draco ran down the corridor not even knowing where he was going, he ran until he felt far enough away from anyone then slipped into an alcove. He pressed his back up against the wall and slid down puting his throbbing head between his knees. He did his best to hold back the pain but after so long it was to much and a heart wrenching sob fell from his mouth. He hurt so horribly he just wanted it to stop he’d rather feel nothing ever again then to feel this.
“Yeah I promise” the blond whispered and pulled the smaller against him to hug. He liked hugging the boy it calmed him.
Hermione sat there silently thinking of if anything she had read would come to mind for this situation, but noting was clicking into place.
“Draco I cant tell you now or ever I can only give you what I already have” the boy paused then continued “remember sometimes there is more there than what you can see with your eyes” Blaise staired into Dracos eyes for a few moments then smiled.
“Oh Draco! You didn’t tell him did you” the girl had thrown herself at him and was hugging him tightly and weeping. Ron had shed a few tears as well knowing there was pain there.
“Well I guess we have a start to a plan, I distract Hermione, and You Ron. What you say Blaise?” pansy asked flipping her hair over her shoulder.
The room was dark and lit with low green lights there were chairs and couches pushed up against the wall in the corner of the room where some people were already congregating. The middle of the room was turned into a dance floor that many were taking advantage of moving and sliding against each other. At the other side of the room was a long table with food and multiple types of alcohol. Where the stairs lead up to the dorm you could see people standing and talking or making out. It definitely wasn’t like the parties Gryffindor had this one seemed more sinister in away and had Harry on high alert. Hermione noticed and pinched him.
“What I meant” he corrected “was he fits with us, I was worried he’d cause issues and disrupt our dynamic.” Pansy just stared head.
“Ronald Weasley, I can’t believe you would think you have say over anything I do.” She screamed.
I hate these soooo much I really do but it was the best way I knew how to let everyone know what has been going on. Unfortunately my computer just died on me, i tried getting it fixed but ended up having to get a new one. Please know I will be continuing my stories Im working on getting my stuff back as of now. I am really sorry for it being so long. I love you all and thank you for you support. When i post the next chapter i will delete this note or add it to the notes to that chapter.
“You two are done! You can face Death eaters, monsters, werewolves, and the like. Which means you can suck it up and talk to the Golden Duo. I swear if you don’t I will hex your hair to change colors for the rest of the term am I clear.” the two nodded quickly. If there was one thing they were more scared of it was Draco on a war path, and it looked like if they didn’t do this then that was what was going to happen. Blake had finally calmed down from his laughing fit and was smiling at the two others. He jumped up and grabbed his bag and turned to them.
“Sorry Blaise” the blond mumbled.
“Open your eyes Harry” he said huskily. “I want you to look me in the eye when I’m talking to you”
“So about this party” Harry said cautiously.
“Draco I’m sure I can trust you to abide by these rules correct” his look softened when he saw the look on his god sons face.
They heard retching which brought them back to the ill boy sitting next to Blaise on the bed. He was completely pale now besides his cheeks which were flushed his eyes were hollow looking and unfocused. Then without warning the brown haired boy went limp and about fell off the bed but Blaise caught him.
“Draco are you really ok, you haven’t eaten all day and your eyes are sunk in.”
Harry lounged back and did a once over of the room looking for the blond again. He should have just left but there was still that possibility he would show up. Or he might be occupied with something or someone else. That thought made Harry sneer he didn’t want to think about Draco with someone else. It was bad enough watching Pansy chase after him let alone see or think of the boy willingly being with someone else. He had always wanted Draco he knew now, back then he thought it was because he had hated the boy for always tormenting him, but he knew he did whatever he could to get the boy to torment him. As he continued with these thoughts, he fell asleep in the oversized chair.
--------------
“I want to be present for that. Not my place to tell you”
“Do not handle her that way. You want to man handle someone why don’t you try with me” he said icily staring the red faced boy down.
Blaise walked briskly down the corridors replaying the mornings events through his head. He was highly upset with the way Weasley spoke to the girl and, physically harming her brother. He could only imagine what was to come when the sleeping dragon was awoken and found out the news. There’s one thing everyone knew and that was you do not touch anything that belongs to a Malfoy, even if said thing didn’t know it belonged to a Malfoy. He laughed to himself in his head as long as he didn’t get any backlash this was going to be entertaining. He had finally made it to Dracos door and whispered the password. He slipped in locked and silenced the door and went to Dracos bed. He crossed his arms over his chest and glared. The damn teen about messed everything up last night because he couldn’t grow a pair and at least talk to the boy. He wanted to send a stinging hex from hell to wake the boy to get back at him, but he knew with what he was about to tell Draco it would make the whole thing worse. So he opted for lightly shaking the others shoulder.
“Im going to bed” was the choked hasty decision from Blake as he ran to the dorms. Blaise stood blocking Draco so he couldn’t follow.
“How the hell did you get in here Parkinson!” the blond growled, she along with all of Slytherin knew he wasn’t a morning person so why she decided to test the beast was beyond him.
“Get rest Draco, you won’t get better unless you do” He said then stepped forward to bring his arms around Dracos abdomen and hugged him. Draco returned the hug wrapping his arms around the smaller boys shoulders and squeezed.
“I’m going to leave you all alone for now I need to go check on Draco, see where he disappeared to last night” Blaise sounded irritated as he said those last words. With a kiss to Hermione’s hand he left swiftly. The two sat in silence for awhile before Harry spoke up.
“Draco stop, its for a ….. genetic condition. I don’t want to talk about it right now. I shouldn’t have said anything” Blake tried to get up but Draco pulled him back down and made him look him in the eyes again and Draco stared hard. Blake at this point had stopped fighting and stared back enjoying staring into the ice grey eyes.
Draco finished the letter and looked back at the top of it and smiled. He could imagine that name rolling of the others lips and it sent his heart fluttering. He never thought he’d know happiness again, but here it was warming his chest. He was curious what Blake was giving him and he had a feeling it was important if he had had it for so long but never gave it to anyone before. That thought brought another smile to his face. Blake considered him important enough to give him something that Blake cherished. Draco sat back and closed his eyes thinking about the smaller boy and soon he had fallen asleep.
“Really Draco ‘Im terribly sorry for last night’ that’s all you were going to say after you used your powers to try and take away his choice.”
“Did we or did we not say we were Friends Pansy?” she screeched again. “That means when there’s major issues that effects our friends lives we need to all work together to fix it, because lord knows no one else is thinking straight” she finished throwing her hands up then slid onto the bed.
Draco threw himself on to his bed and dropped his arm across his eyes and sighed. Then his eyes widened he had completely forgot Blakes letter. He dug in his robe pocket and pulled out the crinkled up envelope. He broke the seal and carefully pulled out the letter his heart racing with excitement and read it.
“He said if you still want to talk to him, to have that” he pointed to the journal “Open to the first page at ten o’clock” Draco was even more confused but nodded. He looked down at his watch and saw it was only a few minutes before ten. He looked back up to Blaise but before he could say anything the boy laughed and turned around.
Blake relaxed as Draco started to rub his back up and down. They stayed like that for a long time not saying a word just enjoying the moment. Nothing ended up being said because both boys fell asleep, holding on to each other.
“Blake your ill, I’m going to get Madam Pomfrey” the blond was out of bed and putting his slippers on.
(See the end of the chapter for
“ Not my place and he asked me not to say anything to anyone, so I didn’t, would have done the same for you Draco” Blaise glanced up then looked at the boy that still hadn’t said anything. “Well go on you’re not mute introduce yourself”  to anyone else that would have seemed harsh but to his friends they heard the playfulness.
“I believe your veela magic is what has caused this situation and Mr.Vipers current situation. You will have no contact with him besides what classes you share and at lunch. To insure this, he is being moved to a room that only a select few will have knowledge of. When Mr.Viper wakes he will be informed of this. This is not up for discussion so do not argue with me.” Snape went to turn to leave but was stopped by Blaise.
“Oh course you do, So does this mean were good?”
Ron threw his own and then both boys were on the ground fighting. Harry was still quite small, so Ron had his size as an advantage and sadly Harry was losing. The red head was thrown off the top of him right after the bigger boy had split his lip open. Harry looked over to Hermione who stood there with her wand drawn and pointed at Ron.
“I was going to read while you all hung out, I don’t want to be a bother” was the soft reply from the boy. Blaise looked at him sadly then turned a questioning gaze to Draco.
“Lets head to breakfast Dray” he said and they made their way to the Great Hall.
“Harry why don’t you really say what’s going on” she said with a knowing smirk.
“It is more than big enough for both of us Potter. Get comfortable and get in”
The next few days passed uneventfully for the four friends. They mainly talked about how they would approach the two Gryffindors and what they would say. Draco and Blake had gotten closer during this time, to the point you did not see one without the other. This development was good for Draco, he was getting more sleep at night, eating more due to Blakes hounding and mothering, he had taken up with the boy and he looked all around healthier. Everything was actually pretty peaceful, and they all were soaking it up enjoying every minuet of it. Friday quickly came and found Draco, and Blake outside the bathroom door in Blake and Blaises room trying to talk the Italian and Pansy out of said bathroom.
“I mean honestly Blaise you should start by talking to him. You said since the war all the animosity has faded. Use this time to get to know him, if he’s anything like I’ve seen he gladly will” Blake said
“I feel like Im betraying Harry, every time Blake has been near, talking to me especially when he touches me, it disappears. The pain, sadness, agony, self loathing, all of it is gone for those moments. Then there’s the feeling of completion I’ve felt from him. I mean fuck Pansy I let him hold, and comfort me. The last person I had contact with that wasn’t my Mother, you, or Blaise, was Harry. But Blake felt comforting when he held and comforted me. I even hugged him back AFTER he had let go, I don’t even know this person Pans. Am I so fucked up that I’m just letting anyone in, that ill take comfort from anyone!” he finished exasperated.
“I like you too Draco” he said simply and for the first time ever Harry saw the blonds mouth drop open in shock. Draco stared at harry in disbelief but quickly recovered and glared at the boy.
“I never want to leave here”
Those words snapped him out of his shock, and he dove off his bed and dug through his desk for his quill then threw himself back onto his bed and wrote back.
Blake slid onto the bed and up to the headboard. He settled in next to Draco with his shoulder touching the blonds. Draco took Blakes hand in his and squeezed, Blake jumped a little surprised by this. Out of all the time they spent together Draco had never hugged or took his hand first.
“Who invited you” he asked over the loud music playing.
“Ok you lot, lets get our notes done with their ready.” Blake said to the others.
His head snapped up when he felt a hand on his leg. Squatting before him was the smaller teen, his chestnut brown hair disheveled, his chest heaving in and out, and his eyes sparkling with sorrow. Those eyes soothed his soul and his heart automatically felt like it had stopped ripping itself apart. Draco angerly threw his head forward to his knees again, letting out a frustrated growl. None of this made sense and he wasn’t understanding. He couldn’t figure it out and it made his head spin.
“Why are you going over there Potter? The bed is right there” he asked.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about” he said sternly, eyes still trained on Pansy. He snapped his head to the bushy haired girl again when she touched his arm.
“Ron you need to stop you’re being unbearable. Harry is actually looking out for me, you on the other hand. You want to control me and have others. You had your chance, and you threw it away, I told you I wasn’t going to wait!” she hissed to him. Ron spun on her and sneered.
Draco and Blaise stepped back from the door as the boy continued to scream and yell and then they felt a small surge of energy. Blaise turned to Draco with wide eyes and underlying fear, and Draco was a little scared too. So he gave Blaise a smile and ran out of the room not taking a chance at being at the receiving end of a pissed Blake.
Blaise broke out in laughter Pansy shook her head and Draco smirked. Blake finally came to and sent a smirk back also “Well I appreciate the consideration but honestly I cant help but stare when there’s such a big red pimple on your chin contrasting with your pale skin” Draco spun around and ran back to his room. Blake waiting until the wall closed before laughing and shortly after Blaise joined in. The three made it all the way to the great hall before they were able to breath again. Pansy gave them both an amused look.
Draco didn’t miss the hurt saddened look Blake gave him right before he picked up his quill and began to take notes. He didn’t mean to snap but all of this was just to much. He didn’t realize it until Weasley and Granger walked in and sat down that he had been watching for the messy raven haired boy to follow in. Then to slip and make himself realize Harry was gone it stabbed his heart through. But what surprised him was when he started drifting to that place he usually went to when this happened, he was brought back and his heart comforted by a simple touch. And from someone he didn’t even know.
“If your mocking me Potter I swear ill….”
“I was just…… a little lost” he said softly staring at the bed cover. He patted the spot next to him inviting the boy to sit with him.
Draco rolled his eyes and tried to hide his blush as he grabbed his arm and started pulling him to his room. Leave it to Harry to make things awkward he thought. Draco guided him up three sets of stairs and down a long corridor before coming to a stop in front of two doors. Draco leaned forward and whispered ‘emerald’ and the doors swung open instantly. He held his arm out gesturing for him to go in.
“Well at least I can see and talk to him in class” Draco said taking a drink of water from his cup by the bed.
“What else is there Zabini? Im not in the mood to drag information out of you today” Draco growled.
“If we’re gonna be friends we’re gonna act like it. We don’t shake hands we hug Malfoy.” The red head said with a hearty laugh.
“That’s enough! Im not glass Im fine now forget the whole damn thing happened.” His voice left no room for argument Blake flinched, but it went un noticed by the blond. Lunch was almost over at this point and food started disappearing again, but before anyone could leave McGonagall stood up to address the student body.
“You have the grace of a garden gnome next time ill let you fall” with that he flew past the two boys, trying to push away the small ache it caused to say such words to the teen. As he reached his door and said the password he could hear Blake saying he didn’t mean to cause an issue he had miss judged the step, and Blaise reassuring him it was just how Draco was and not to think noting of it.
‘Im Making it a concern’
He kept his eyes at the other end of the table watching Blake. The boy didn’t eat near what he normally would instead picked at his plate. Draco wanted to go over to him and hold him and tell him everything would be ok but knew that was not a possibility right now. He saw Pansy was no better than Blaise was, she looked love struck as she listened to Hermione go on and on.
“Pansy, Blaise will you catch them up on things some while I check all of our potions.” His friends nodded to him understanding he didn’t want to talk about it anymore.
With that one statement the tension returned to the group, and Draco laughed to himself. This was going to be interesting.
“Draco we’ll figure this out I won’t let you all loose each other” he said
Draco was woken by rustling in the room and soft voices. He stiffened as his mind raced trying to get its bearings, but then the night before came to the forefront and he settled back. The rustles had to be coming from Blaise or Blake.
Draco was beyond confused and lost at this point. This was the second time he had felt this, this spark from the teen next to him and he didnt not like it but at the same time it terrified him. Could he have been wrong about Harry? No there is no way he was wrong, Harry was his mate he knows that with all his heart. But what was ‘This’ that was going on, that he was feeling towards Blake. There’s no way the smaller teen was his mate you only had one mate your whole life, right? Draco glanced over at that time to observe the boy.
“No need for the hostilities, we were honestly looking for the two of you. We wanted to personally invite you to the party Draco and I are hosting this evening” Blaise said smoothly and winked at Hermione.
“Come on Draco lets get you dressed and to your room you need food and some rest”
“I have to write to our Father about this situation that has happened. While I’m at it I’m going to go ahead and write to him about your all’s relationship, go ahead and get the ball rolling with that” he said with a smirk. Blaise face darkened and he started sputtering and Hermione shot him a glare, but no heat was behind it. Harry just laughed Sirius was going to get a kick out of all this. Eventually Blaise calmed down and smiled back at Harry gratefully, knowing he had Harrys support for what he was about to go through for his sister.
She sadly shook her head “We all fuck up but you majorly fucked up. But you can fix it, you have to grovel” at that Draco let out a choked sob/laugh. She was right that’s what he was going to have to do and not only to Blake, but to Blaise too, for messing with his friend. The two remaining Slytherins stood and Pansy walked Draco to his room and left him with a hug promising it was able to be fixed. He just first had to beg forgiveness and explain what was going on too. Draco walked into his room and stripped leaving his cloths on the floor not caring that they belonged in the hamper. He cried himself to sleep yet again but this time not only over Harry but over the fact he had used his veela powers to force Blake to do something he didn’t want, and had possibly lost him forever after only having him as a friend for over twenty four hours.
“No something’s wrong what did I do” the blonde pushed further. Finally, Harry let it out.
‘Wait don’t do that, I was just messing with you. If you don’t want to tell me that’s fine. How about for every question I ask you can ask one too?’
Chapter 2
“First no contact physically Draco and Blake will not be allowed to be within 20 feet of each other. They can be in the same room but that is about it. Blake will be placed in his own private room that only the head mistress, Snape, and I will know the whereabouts of. Before you ask no I can not tell you where it is or take you to it, they have taken precautions on this” he said through gritted teeth.
“We just walked almost two miles I think we’ve had enough ‘outside time’ Pansy” Blaise replied with a lazy tone.
Blaise had to hold in the laugh that wanted to escape at the pout his friend wore for fear he would get a tung slashing.
“Don’t get a big head Malfoy I think my owl is pretty too” Blake laughed out. Draco reached out and smacked him in the back of the head.
“Spoiled brat, cant handle not having your way. But I can believe you didn’t intentionally do it. You must understand his ‘disorder’ is very delicate, and only three people know about it. There’s a reason he doesn’t tell anyone else and it needs to stay hidden. You broke his trust, that is one of the biggest things for him is trust and he felt he could trust you. So your going to have to do better than a note saying ‘Im sorry’. Man up Malfoy”
--------------
“Yes Professor Snape Ill follow these rules” the venom in those words caused Snapes heart to clench.
The opening feast was very calm and quiet on the Slytherins side of the hall. Most of the upper years didn’t say anything besides giving an occasional answer to the new first years. No one even asked the new kid questions, but you could tell from all the glances that they did indeed have questions. Draco himself had a lot of questions but he’d rather wait until they were in the dungeons. Soon the food was vanished from the tables, the students bid good night, and sent on their way to bed.
Draco started to get drowsy and let his eyes slid close his body relaxing as well causing him to lean more heavily against Blake. He felt the boy shift and lightly grab his shoulders and lower him down to the bed. Then Blake leaned up and made to get off the bed. Draco snapped his eyes open and grabbed Blakes wrist stopping the boys movements.
“I believe some of your post got mixed in mine Mr.Malfoy” he simply stated and held out a letter.
“I think Ill listen to Blaise on this one Harry” she said. Harry started back astonished he was not mad but at the same time he didn’t want to deal with all the questions that were bound to come out.
“ Blaise I never knew you were so giving” Pansy duct when a pillow was thrown at her and she burst out in giggles. “ Awww was your crush on the weasel all a lie and you truly pined after this handsome man” with that both Blake and Blaise gagged.
“No need to be sorry, I’m sure you’re going to want to kiss me anyway after I give this to you” he said smugly and held out what looked like a book. Draco raised his eyes brow at the boy whose smirk grew even wider.
Blake walked closely to Blaise and they would whisper back and forth occasionally. Draco would glance his way every so often and catch Blake looking at him When that would happen the boy would smile and look away, ashamed at being caught, and return to talking to Blaise.
“That’s ok just means you’ll probably have multiple detentions” Draco said as he sat up his area as well
“ Viper” he stated “ Blake Viper” Draco stared at the hand and had a flash back to first year. He quickly recovered and looked the boy in the eyes as he extended his arm and took the boys hand in his and shook it. Feeling a sense of complement, and was that a sense of calm recognition. He pushed it to the side.
“What did you need to say” he softly asked eyes down cast.
Blaise ran as fast as he could to Snapes chambers, he had to get him to the hospital wing before the situation turned out worse. Snape was going to be livid, one because it was five in the morning on a Saturday, and two because Draco had deliberately no listened and could have just put the boy in danger, and that’s one thing Snape would not tolerate. Blaise finally made it to Snapes chambers and started beating on the door until it was thrown open. Snape stood there a frightening look on his face, his scowl said exactly how he felt to being woken up.
The boy sat down Next to Blaise and clapped him on the back “ Have a good summer there Blaise?” the boy asked in a happy, soft almost shy voice. Draco and Pansy stared at Blaise with looks of utter confusion.
-------------------
Chapter 10
“Then why did he leave me, why didn’t he take me with him” Draco all but screamed into the others hair.
“Yes, Draco, I did I’m his closest friend right now that’s ALLOWED to be near him right now. At least Until we figure out how to fix this issue of you being near him. Just know he’s almost as bad as you are right now since he can’t be around you” Blaise looked down with a sad look. This was not fair to either of them after all they had been through, they should have what they want.
“ I plan on finding out that answer, and more. And its his problem if his eyes are for me not interested” but in truth Draco was very interested in Blake. He was one big mystery and puzzle that Draco would solve.
“What have you done so far” he asked coldly, shooting a glare at Draco who returned it
“I saw you and Blaise note passing, are you all good now?”
‘Nothing of your concern’ Blake glanced down and scrunched up his nose
“We saw Harry before he left the castle Draco. He told us about what you said.” Ron whispered, his own eyes gleaming with tears.
After an hour of moseying around and three more shots each they both had given up on finding the boys who had invited them and decided to make their way to the dance floor. At this point they were both pleasantly intoxicated but not so much they would be hungover the next day. But they were enjoying themselves.
“ I … Im truly sorry. It wasn’t my intention to use my pull on you. Id never want to make you, or anyone else for that matter do something against their will. I was worried, you said you were taking potions because you were sick, I wanted to help and you wouldn’t tell me, and it made it worse. I know that’s no reason for doing what I did and I regret it.” Draco was looking down worrying the cuff of his robes between his fingers. “ I understand that you don’t trust me now, and if you don’t want anything to do with me or talk to me, I’ll understand that too” when those words left his mouth he felt a sharp sting in his chest. The room returned to silence and after awhile Draco stood up.
“Im already up, might as well make myself useful, and help find Blakes meds he has lost” Draco stood and made his way to the other side of the bed to put his shoes on. Once his back was turned away from the two other boys, he heard frantic bustling and heard the door to the bathroom slam shut and lock. Draco spun around and locked eyes with Blaise. The other looked away nervously and went about looking for the vial Blake needed.
“When you put it that way it was stupid, Look I am sorry, I didn’t realize I was doing it I wouldn’t intentionally do that. I was really worried and wanted to help and he wouldn’t tell me what I could do to help. It got out of hand and I fucked up”
Draco was astounded, and slouched back into his chair. Harry had told his friends about their moment together before he left to fight the Dark Lord. He looked at the two questioningly wanting to know what they thought.
“I second that” came from behind them as Pansy stepped up to them.
“Why the bloody hell not!”
“Oh Dray Dray its time to get up and primp for the day ahead” at hearing the horrid nick name given to him by none other than Pansy herself at a young age, Draco sat straight up and smacked said girl with his pillow.
Draco stepped out of the bathroom his hair was swept to the side and back not a hair out of place. He wore black trousers perfectly tailored to his body. He had a dark green button up on with the top two buttons undone and the sleeves rolled up. To finish off the look he wore his silver necklace with the Malfoy crest and a pair of black Italian loafers. But what scared him was the blank look the blond was sending his way. Blaise stood up and adjusted himself looking back at Draco with a blank look of his own.
Please review and leave your comments and ideas. I love hearing from you all.
“What the hell will he be able to do you need a medi witch”
“He’ll be fine in a few hours Dray but you won’t be able to see him until tomorrow” Blaise said from his side.
Draco sat straight up in bed gasping, what had that dream been about. He oddly felt calm even though the dream was very confusing to him. He snapped his head to his right side when he felt movement. The previous night came back to him, the realization and acceptance he had had with his feelings of Blake. He smiled and laid back down next to the boy and placed his hand on his cheek but jerked it back when he felt the heat coming from the boy. Draco sat up quickly and started looking the boy over, he was to pale and shivering. He shook his shoulder to try and wake him up and frowned when the teen did not budge.
“What’s that look for Pans” he blushed redder when she gave a smirk and faced forward and continued to walk. After another few minuets of silence and him talking himself into talking to the girl about his cluster fuck of a head right now he opened his mouth what came out was not what he wanted to say.
Draco watched the dule color eyed boy interacting with his friends intently. There seemed to be something he was completely missing. Something was itching at the back of his head like when you know the answer to a question but at the same time you cant bring it forward and if you think about it head on it just moves further and further to the back of his head. But at the same time it seemed like he belonged there, laughing and joking, like hes been the missing piece. “Is your rooming situation taken care of?” all eyes turned to him with confusion and surprise. Out of all the questions why did he ask that it was completely off the wall. He mentally smacked himself.
“I’m sure it’s nothing, Blakes potion wore off in the night and it surprised him. Im sure he’s just embarrassed of the situation and couldn’t bear to look you in the face. You know how it is with the damsels”
“Come now, I’ve dealt with it no need for more tears” He said and handed the girl his handkerchief and patted her on the back.
Finally, Draco raised his head and straightened his back and looked Blake in the eyes again. Those damn eyes! What is it about them, their so inviting so warm. He put his arm around the boy and brought him to his chest squeezing him in a silent thank you. ‘He smells of trecaltart, broom polish, and potions’ Draco thought to himself then scrunched up his face in thought. He almost knew what potion he smelled like but could not put his finger on it. Draco didn’t think on it anymore but filed it away for another time to think about.
“Its not really his HEALTH” Blaise started but quickly shut his mouth with a pained look. “I cant say more but I can say his health is very good”
“Yes he’s doing perfectly fine, he told me to tell you to stop throwing a tantrum before you get an unlimited amount of detentions or expelled” Draco sat up quickly and shot him an accusing look.
“I was also teasing you because I like you” he whispered his face going hot.
“He said when he gets to watch me grovel at Blakes feet well be even. And don’t worry your invited” Draco laughed as did pansy.
Soon Blaise stepped aside and shook his head and sat back down in his chair.
“What’s the worst case? They say no, but I think we can live with that… or just stalk them again” Blaise laugh.
The night had carried on like this sitting in the same spot and chatting to a few people who made their way over to him. Some even wanted to dance but he politely declined. By this point he had had two more glasses and was definitely feeling it. He started to doze off in the chair every so often but would wake himself up. Blaise and Hermione made their way over to him and he smiled at them.
“Well we were invited by the hosts personally I think it would be rude to not attend” she said with a smirk. Harry laughed at her he saw right through her.
Blake wasn’t seen for the rest of the day or the following day either. Draco had tried multiple times to get into the hospital ward to at least ask how the boy was doing, and each time he had been stopped. After his last time of going up there and about blasting the door open his God father had jerked him up by the collar of his robes and drug him back to his room, threw him in said room, and trapped him in it. A few hours later Blaise showed up took down the wards (apparently Severus told him how because Draco didn’t have a clue, he’d never seen these wards before) and walked in with food.
“Dray, come on you need to wake up. There’s things that need to be discussed” Blaise said sternly. The blond shifted and mumbled a little his brows pulling together. Finally one eye opened up to see his best friend and he sighed.
Draco stood frozen at the bottom of the stairs at the sight in front of him. Raven hair wild and messier than normal fell into emerald green eyes that he had loved since first year, even if he didn’t know that he loved them then. His face covered in scratches, dirt, and blood, his glasses sitting just on the tip of his nose as he stared at the ground as he descended the stairs. To most Harry looked like absolute shit, like he had been drug kicking and screaming back from hell. But in that moment to draco he looked like what he thought warrior angels would look like. As Harry reached the final steps he finally noticed a shadow in front of him, he stopped and looked up meeting Dracos eyes. Draco continued to stare, his heart beating faster and faster as he tried to gather his thoughts. The only thing that kept going through his head was grab him, hold him, don’t let go. Harry stared back at Draco shell shocked not knowing what to say or do. He hadn’t thought he would see anyone on his way to meet Voldemort let alone see Draco.
When Blake was around, his veela went wild and started to rear its head. When Blake would touch him in any way even just a hand on the shoulder, he would want to lean forward and grab the boy. His sent was comforting to him, it calmed him whenever he was mad. If anyone made a comment to Blake or disrespected him Draco was right there stepping in, but at the same time held himself back from attacking the other person. Draco wanted to be with Blake wanted him as his own. Today when Blake had said ‘Your mine’ during potions his inner self had reared its head. It wanted to make that true, to make Blake his and himself Blakes. Show the whole world they were each others and no one elses. And now that he had come to terms with what he was feeling there was burning inside himself, his veela side was going crazy with want. That is what sucked about being a dominate veela, you had to use a lot of self-control, and right now that was really hard. He heard a knock at his door and whipped his head towards it wonder who it was.
“Harry what’s wrong what did I do” he asked bringing his hand up to wipe away the tears. Harry sniffed but shook his head saying nothing.
“Where are you all going?” Pansy hollered from her place next to Draco.
“Look there’s other houses already here and everything’s fine. Lets go get a drink and enjoy ourselves” she yelled over the loud music and lead them over to the table to get a drink. They each decided to take a shot of fire whisky before each of them took a glass of wine for themselves and began to make their way around the room. After a while they came across Seamus and Dean and chatted with them awhile. Harry was distracted and didn’t pay much attention. He was to busy looking for the prince himself but had not seen nothing of him. When he glanced at Hermione he could tell she was doing the same thing but looking for dark skinned Italian.
“ Did you know I went to him before he went to the forest?” the weight that question held could be felt through the whole compartment. Noting was said and Draco took that as a sign to continue. “ I knew when I saw him walking down those stairs that that would be my only chance to say anything to him…..”
‘Veela! Amazing Ive never known one personally but have read about them. I shouldn’t be shocked your looks alone should have told me. Yes, two but short affairs. Have you found your mate? I read you all have one’
“You are so confident in all you do, but here comes a red head and you turn into a whimpering Hufflepuff, and I swear to god Blaise you hex me and ill break your fingers to the point it will take skellagrow all night to fix you” Draco said seriously at the end giving the Italian a pointed look. The olive skinned boy returned the look full force but didn’t send a hex his way.
“Don’t have the stomach for it” and continued to drink his coffee.
“I will get you back Viper” he sat down and smirked at the other teen
Draco looked down at the parchment and thought about the offer. He did have a lot of questions for the boy but the problem was how much was he himself willing to share. After thinking on it for a few minuets he wrote back.
He walked up to her door and knocked softly after a few minuets she walked out, and Harry smirked at her. She blushed and hit his shoulder and walked past him down the stairs. She looked gorgeous and he had a feeling a certain Italian was going to enjoy watching her all night. She had tamed her hair and now had it falling in loose waves down her back. She was wearing a dark pair of skinny jeans that showed off her curves. The Black button up she wore fit just as well and she left the top three buttons open, not showing anything but also making you wonder what could be shown. She had on her Black family crest also, but what amazed him the most was how perfectly she walked in her black heals. He quickly caught up to her and offered his arm.
“Oh now I almost hope you do” he said with a laugh then went serious “You better not though”
“Yes that is a nasty habit of ours, but I’m happy we stopped calling her what we did” the three grimaced at that.
Draco locked eyes with his godfather and bared his teeth. Snape sneered and didn’t back down, bringing out his wand and aiming it right at Dracos chest. They continued this match of wills for some minuets before Draco looked away and sat back against the headboard of the bed and looked around the room. Blaise sat in a chair next to Dracos bed, Severus was at the foot of his bed towering over him still with that same sneer. McGonagall was no where to be seen which meant she left or was with the boy in the other room.
“ Well I smell vanilla, apples, and……. Spring.” The boy said and looked at the others, they all looked confused besides Blaise who was trying to hold in laughter.
I hope you all are enjoying. I've started another story I will be writing also. I started it to appease myself while I search for a fic I've been looking for for awhile that I read years ago. I hope you all will enjoy that one as much as I've enjoyed writing it.
“Draco…..Draco you have to get up” he rolled and tossed his pillow over his face not fully comprehending someone was in his room… his private room.
“I dreamed about him again Sev, it was so real I didn’t want to wake up. He promised he never left me and never would. But he did and I am alone” Draco finished with a choked half cry. Severus did the one thing no one would believe and pulled his god son to him and held him for a brief moment.
Harry stood in front of his full body mirror and checked himself over. He had taken a shower and fixed his hair in it causal messy manner. He wore a dark green button up that was left open and rolled up to his elbows. He had a black tee shirt under it and wore a pair of washed out blue jeans with black leather shoes. The only jewelry he had on was his silver chain that had the Black family crest hanging from it. Harry had to admit he looked better than he normally did, but he still felt self conscious, no matter how much Sirius and Hermione told him he was drop dead sexy he didn’t believe it. After a once over he walked out the door to go and get Hermione.
Draco was the first down to the common room and sat down to wait for the others to show up. He leaned back and closed his eyes letting his mind wonder. He actually felt pretty good his mind wasnt as groggy as it usually was, his body felt rested, and he didn’t have a head ache. His physical appearance looked better some too. His eyes were not sunk in, and his cloths and hair were not as disheveled as they had been for a while, thanks to actually getting some rest and having the energy to put forth the effort. Not only that somewhere in the back of his mind he wanted to look the best he could. He told himself it was because he didn’t want his friends (more specifically Blake) to worry about him anymore, but there was that small instinct to preen and look good for someone else. He kept telling himself that wasn’t the case, but his little veela inside him wouldn’t listen at all. He sat up and stood once he heard foot steps coming down the stairs of the dorms. And there stood Blake and Blaise glaring at him, what the hell had he done, he wasn’t even around them for the past thirty minutes.
“He’s in his sisters’ room, luckily he showed up when he did or this morning would be going a lot different” Blaise said darkly.
I apologize everyone had some stuff happen and was kept busy for the past few days. Im really upset with myself I was hoping to post my Halloween chapter on Halloween but didn’t get to. But to the ones who have left kudos, comments, follows and such thank you so much, it keeps me going. You all are amazing. I was considering going forward with a Blaise/Ron and possibly Pansy/Hermione coupling but not sure. Tell me what you think, please comment, message me and let me know what you think, or if you have ideas, or would like to see something. I promise to do what I can.
“If you would have asked me that a few years ago I would have said yes. But now I would have to say no. By denying yourself happiness would be betraying their memory, because if they really loved you they would want you happy no matter what”
Draco flopped down on the couch beside Pansy and stared off water pooling at the sides of his eyes. “Pans I fucked up” was all he said.
‘I wish mother was here. She’s always able to figure things out’ at that he sat bolt up right and jumped out of his bed to his desk and grabbed parchment and a quill. He had completely forgotten to write her. He’s lucky he hadn’t gotten a howler yet. He set to writing to her hastily running over the past few days.
Breakfast went by silently and Snape handed out everyones time tables. He stopped briefly when he got to Blake and reminded him of an appointment, they had later that week and expected him to remember. Before the food was even banished from the table the three teens were making their way down the corridors to their first class. Which was potions with the Gryffindors. The group walked in and sat at the second to last long table. Pansy on the end followed by Blaise Draco and Blake.
“Leave and do not speak to us again” she said quietly but her eyes were a blaze with anger. She walked over to Harry and pulled him up by his arm and drug him through her door quickly before Ron could gather himself. As soon as the door was shut a powerful locking and silencing charm was thrown at the door. Harry snapped his head up and met angry brown eyes.
“Got it!” Blaise said triumphantly and walked over to the bathroom and handed it to Blake when his hand shot out for him.
“Damn you Walker leave him alone, can you not tell your making an ass out of yourself” he finished angerly.
The room was silent for a while everyone taking in the situation. Obviously the noble Lions had staked their claim on the four Slytherins and now considered them theirs. Which none of them were used to the only ones they ever trusted were each other the rest of their house was cut throat. It was a lot to take in and they would take longer to adjust to it and learn to trust them, but at this point Draco would do what ever he could and take whatever help he could to keep Blake.
Dracos eyebrows drew together in thought. The two smartest people in…. then it hit him, the Italian was talking about Hermione and that meant the other two would be Ron and Pansy. What confused him most was why the two Gryffindors wanted to help. Yes, over the past few days they had become a more prominent part of their group, but he didn’t think it was enough for them to actually want to help. Unless Blaise and Pansy were making them. Apparently, that thought was written all over the blonds face because the next thing he knew he was being hit with a pillow to the face.
“Well that among other things” she said standing up and making her way to the door and smiling back at harry. “Also wear your best Harry I think it’ll do some good”
“Your bound and determined to out me aren’t you, you hussy” he said playfully as he jerked her up and started to tickle her. Hermione let out a squeal and started to thrash about. Neither of them caring they were in the middle of the corridor or noticing who was around.
“Yes mother…” was Dracos hollow reply as he gazed down the platform. He knew he would not catch a glimpse of that raven black shaggy hair, yet he looked his heart hoping.
“I don’t believe you own her Weasel” Blaises eyes were burning brightly waiting for a fight. Draco now stood taller behind his friend his hand in his pocket obviously waiting for Ron to make a move.
Chapter 4
Before Draco could step forward and cause any issues Blaise stepped in front of him shooting a warning through his eyes at the blond. He then turned around and held his hand out to Harry and Hermione.
Hermione smiled to herself when she heard Draco grumble behind his friend something about ‘being forced into hosting, and inviting the two.’ At that Blaise shot him a heated glare that shut the blond up completely. Ron chose that moment to push forward finally realizing what was going on. Blaise was hitting on the girl.
‘Why are your eyes black’
Draco glanced to Blake and saw him shivering and pale in his God fathers’ arms. He finally stepped to the side but did not take his eyes off Severus or the boy in his arms. The older man made his way quickly to the isolation room off to the side in the very back of the ward. Draco was right on his heels when he was grabbed and hauled backwards.
“You got to see him!”
“Please define Blaise, I have a feeling the morning is still going to be shot to shit” the blond said. Blaise sighed and began re telling the events of the morning. As he got to the end, he got a little fidgety and stopped talking all together.
Draco was in his room laying down staring at his canopy, thinking about the day. It had started out good everything had gone to plan with Blaise and Pansy. Then potions class came along, and they had to do that damn potion. Ever since then he just didn’t feel the same, he was confused to no end. He thought he smelt Harry but then there was that scent mixed in that was Blakes. Was he confusing the two since they were similar? Or maybe he made himself think it was all Harrys but what he smelt was all Blake. That could be possible though. He had his mate and lost him, you could only have one and his was gone, There’s no way he would be able to love another. But at the thought his heart speed up and his inner veela started to stir. He rolled over and felt something crinkle in his pocket, the letter from his mother. He sat up and took out the envelope, broke the seal and started to read.
“You’re not playing with me are you” Draco said in surprise.
-------------------
His eyes were completely black his breathing heavy, his normal nails now talons. He started stalking towards Blaise and McGonagall his sharp teeth bared for all to see.
“Yyes Draco” he finally stuttered out. Draco really should have stopped but he had never been this close to the boy before he didn’t want it to end. So he continued his teasing.
“We figured it’d be better to all sit together while we try to get through all this. The more the merrier right”
“I will not! If you want, call McGonagall but I am caring for him” with that Snape picked Blake up and made to go to the isolation room but was stopped by Draco.
Hermione was now standing behind him waiting her turn. She stepped up and when she did Draco actually reached for her and pulled her into a hug, shocking everyone. She smiled and hugged the blond back then turned to the others.
“Well its ok for us, means we’ll have some sort of entertainment, especially since Pot….” But Draco abruptly cut off his own sentence with a stunned faraway look. Blake reached out and laid his hand on Dracos arm trying to bring him back. When he finally came to he jerked away as if he had been shocked. “Nothing just was meant to be a joke. But you’ll be fine between the three of us well get you through without a detention” and with that he turned towards the front just as Snape bellowed in.
“If I do ill lay down and let you hex my bullocks off, fair?” Draco smirked
Dinner was uneventful, well besides Draco looking for Blake. Blaise said they had gone back to their room for awhile and talked, which he didn’t answer any of their questions about what they talked about, then Blake had said he needed to go speak to Snape. Snape was at the teachers table for dinner so why wasn’t Blake sitting with them. Draco kept glancing towards the door all through dinner, which didn’t go unnoticed by his two friends. During this time Draco started wandering back into that dark hazy state of mind and he didn’t like it. He hardly ate anything and when Pansy and Blaise finished they pulled Draco along with them to the common room hoping to distract him for a little while.
“Well my apologies Mr. Viper I was wanting to insure I looked my best so you had something nice to stare at all day” Blakes eyes widened dramatically and his face went three shades redder in surprise and honestly Draco was just as surprised buy the words that had left his mouth also.
Pansy walked along side Draco and caught the looks the new guy was giving him and the glances Draco snuck in. “He and Blaise seem close wonder why hes never mentioned him before. And he seems to have eyes for you Dray” she chuckled.
In the short time it took to argue with the head mistress Severus had gotten Blake into the isolation room and closed, locked and warded the door. Draco ran over and started beating on the door madly. He took out his wand and through every hex and unlocking spell he could think of at the door. When nothing happened and he could not get though he rounded on the three people behind him.
“This is my hospital wing Ill remind you Severus, you will move aside and let me care for this student this instant”
The first thing Harry noticed was the big king size four poster bed with black curtains. It was overly plush and had a Slytherin green comforter. He looked to the far side of the room and saw a black leather couch in front of the decent sized fire place that was ablaze. Harry started walking to the leather couch to settle in for the night when a hand on his elbow stopped him. Harry looked up and met silver eyes looking at him in confusion.
