“Ron,” Granger cut in finally as Potter looked at Weasley with his mouth open, looking horrified. “Harry does not want to undress in public.”
, Harry lifts his face, pulling his fingers out and lowering Draco back onto the bed, panting loudly. Draco forces his eyes open, finally releasing the tight clench of his teeth, and stares down with lust blown, glazed eyes, his expression likely as helplessly desperate as he felt.
“You were never a Death Eater, Malfoy,” Potter replies smoothly. “Sorry to break it to you, but it takes more than an ugly tattoo to be one of those.” Without even blinking, Potter lifts Draco’s left arm and pointedly kisses the shrivelled scar of his Dark Mark.
Draco has raised a fist before he knows it, his elbow hitting the wall as he draws it back, jostling him awkwardly, giving Potter more than enough time to snort derisively, grab Draco by the wrist and twist his arm back, pressing his own clenched fist into his lower back so that Draco’s hips are canted outwards.
“No, no,” he says hoarsely, tying the towel high around his soft midriff. “I just realised how late I am. Are the kids already dressed?”
Potter seems hesitant to lay directly on top of Draco, as evidenced by the way he resists Draco’s clutching fingers as he tries to pull Potter between his thighs. Instead he lies next to him, pressed as close to him as possible, returning all of Draco’s starved, breathless kisses.
The Tempus he casts in his state of semi-consciousness informs him that it’s just past six AM and Draco immediately tears himself out of bed, swaying on the spot for a moment as his body struggles to register that he’s awake. He slams open his bedroom door and, stumbling only twice, marches down the corridor to Potter’s room — Potter’s back home, he can tell from the way the very walls of the house buzz with his magic.
“I mean that regulations or no regulations, the next time you give me a boner, I will bend you over the nearest surface and fuck your brains out your ears.”
“Harry can’t make me do shit,” Ron says, Summoning a copy of Witch Weekly from the coffee table and making a show of settling in to read it.
He just stares at me with that look of wonder for a long time, reaching up once to pull off my smudged glasses and put them aside and then another time to brush my hair off my forehead and stroke my scar.
To Draco’s rising ire, he saw some more garments of his in the nest. Moody had somehow acquired some more of his socks, a pyjama top and an old T-shirt of Harry’s that Draco sometimes slept in.
“A lot of things do something for you, Malfoy,” Ron says loudly and the glare Draco throws over his shoulder is directed at me, not Ron, and so I quickly smack Ron up the back of his head, dragging him away firmly by the sleeve while I sneak quick glances over my shoulder at the pair of them – Draco is standing a whole lot closer to him than he’d been three seconds ago.
“Fuck,” Harry breathes, something pushing him to lean in and lap gingerly over the whole patch. Malfoy stiffens and whines under his breath. “I didn’t realise—I’m so
“Because he told me it’s mine,” Harry replies, voice muffled from where he’s hunched over Hermione’s desk, head in his arms.
“Well, this is going to be a pleasant afternoon then,” Malfoy squeaked hysterically. “Hello, I’m the bloke that almost killed your brother, who was also the most revered wizard since Merlin! How do you do, I’ll have Firewhiskey, if you please!”
Draco thinks it’s the perfect opportunity to discuss things, what with an actual Patronus in sight and all, but Harry must’ve detected something in Weasley’s tone that makes him quickly pull their things together and hurriedly lead Draco back to the castle.
” Harry shushed him loudly through clenched teeth as he returned with more lube, nearly groaning out loud as he watched the way his finger sunk into Malfoy, this time not stopping until he was in all the way.
(while also informing him that it was Potter’s grandfather who had, in fact, invented the whole range of Sleekeazy products and that they just happen to
“Five days,” Draco murmurs, dropping his gaze when Potter looks around in surprise, stomach turning with embarrassment. “It was five days after you won at Nationals. You caught the Snitch barely fifteen minutes in.”
Draco turns around and imperiously calls out to Zabini for a refill as though he hadn’t said anything unusual.
He turns, gaping, and Potter’s right there, looking more ecstatic than Draco feels, and with a rough laugh, Draco’s dragging Potter forward with one hand fisted in his shirt. Potter grabs his arms, laughing with him, leaning in as Draco shakes him by the collar with a hoot of glee.
Draco sighs as Harry places one knee beside Draco’s hip on the bed and conjures some lube to fist over his cock. His tender expression as he gazes down at Draco reflects none of the savage
“Potter, you need to stop.” Malfoy’s words, muffled into his hands, made dread seep through Harry, a small part of him demanding that he simply carry on.
His startled gasp morphed into breathless sniggering as he accepted Harry’s vigorous flurry of moist kisses that were being pressed all over his face. Sturdy hands clenched at his hips and he was backed firmly into the wall as warm lips caught on his forehead, his eyelids, the tip of his nose, the corners of his mouth and his cheeks.
“Merlin! Oh god!” If he concentrated really hard, Harry thought he could hear the slick squelch of Malfoy’s fingers.
Narcissa’s mouth ticks up on one side. “Who said anything about sleeping?” And Draco is certain that he receives the shadow of a
“So why not call it a ‘she’?” he snaps before huffing and throwing himself carelessly onto the sofa, giving Harry a mild aneurysm. “The rate I’m growing, you likely won’t have to wait very much longer,” he mutters darkly, glaring down at his stomach where it’s protruding threateningly, practically a separate entity by itself. “I’m done housing it, Potter. I want this to be over.”
“You’re here,” Harry whispers stupidly, his throat constricting, his eyes beginning to ache just from looking at Malfoy, so broken and beautiful. “I was so fucking wor— Malfoy, are you okay?”
, for the first time in...well, ever, I think. And I’ve thought about it a lot since that night, feeling as free as I did then...”
“Haven’t you wondered about the monthly transformations?” Granger asks Draco, frowning lightly at Potter again.
“Git,” Harry says, sniggering along helplessly. “No, listen. I don’t care what they say and neither do you. And I’d like very much to move into a place that isn’t steeped in Dark Magic and I’d like to do so with a roommate.”
!” Potter holds him by the hair and bucks when Draco squeezes the glans with his throat; gagging softly, Draco lifts off an inch or two. “Sorry! I’m so sorry,” he gasps, loosening his fist a bit and patting Draco’s head clumsily before shuddering at the way Draco just takes him back down his throat. “Christ.”
“Sex,” Harry mutters vaguely, one hand unconsciously straying to his cock, thumb stroking the straining bulge. “I ought to have some.”
you’d want to show off—” Draco starts, more out of shock than actual derision, but Granger interrupts again.
?” She stares incredulously, voice slightly shrill now. “How was that magi-scanner even medically or legally
“Malfoy!” Granger’s voice is bright and friendly. “Harry’s just been telling us about the potion you brewed him. He’s looking so much better, don’t you think?”
collection,” I spit and Draco laughs harder. “I hate you, I’m never going anywhere with you again. Where did you fuck off to anyway?” I prod suspiciously.
He yelps, spinning around in alarm as his left hand is abruptly grabbed in a vice like grip, and a very wet, rather whiskery kiss, slopped onto his inner wrist.
!” Potter shouts, spine ramrod stiff and hands clenched, barely aware of the startled look Draco gives him.
his room; it reminds him of his quarters at Malfoy Manor, as does the brilliant library on the second floor that Draco spent a solid three hours browsing around in on the very first day of his arrival at Grimmauld. He’d run into Potter on his way back to his room and the git had
A month ago, when Ron and Hermione had invited us over for Sunday brunch one weekend and Draco had arrived late and slightly out of breath, Ron had asked him just where the fuck he’d been and he’d smirked that
And that had been Draco’s first date with Harry. It had involved mostly a lot of strained politeness, lingering glances and curious questions. There had also been, eventually, plates of crisps, fresh fish and chips and casual touches and firmer eye contact. It had been past eleven when they finally decided it was time to head on home. Potter had insisted on paying and had said, with a shrug, “You can pay next time.”
Three weeks later, Harry finds him in an empty corridor, bloody and bruised with a broken arm, floating in and out of consciousness, dazed under the effects of a thorough Confundus Charm.
I go out with Ron and Hermione. On the nights everyone in the gang is meeting, I excuse myself. It’s lucky that I don’t meet the others as often as I do Ron and Hermione because the questions I’d have to face would make for some stupendous awkwardness.
Potter looks a little forlorn at that. “Well, yeah, to dinner, but also...” he licks his lips, suddenly nervous, “Yeah, dinner first, I suppose. We’ll—We’ll see where it goes from there.”
“Harry got a tattoo,” Weasley explained, slightly out of breath. “He got a really big tattoo. It’s on his back—Wanna see? It’s on his—Harry, mate, take off your—”
“Potter,” he waggles a finger, still clamped around the files, in the vague direction of his specs, “if you’d be so kind?” Carefully remaining seated, Harry waves a hand, levitating the delicate spectacles onto the top of the pile Malfoy holds. He receives a tiny, businesslike smile for it. “Much obliged. Aren’t you supposed to be indisposed and on leave?” he asks Harry, head tilting slightly so some more of his neatly combed fringe slides further onto his face.
Harry sliced up the single loaf of bread he’d packed and slapped together a stack of ham and cheese sandwiches for everyone’s dinner, along with plenty of chocolate. He was aware that he himself hadn’t eaten anything but for a couple of biscuits since that morning and he supposed that sustenance would help replenish his magic sooner too.
“Do I have to?” Malfoy asks, mock-wearily. “Is this how it’s going to be now? You making outrageous demands of me?”
pounding you open,” he curls an arm around Malfoy’s ribcage and hauls his stomach carefully off the bed before fucking him even more savagely, his hips bouncing off Malfoy’s arse, “while you’re pregnant with
, Potter,” he mutters darkly, his eyes widening then as he promptly blushes, summoning a swarm of manic bees to buzz around inside Harry’s belly. “What do you want?” he crosses his arms, scowling heavily.
His voice rises as he speaks, his brows drawing together. He squeezes one hand between us and I feel his knuckles as he wraps his hand around his cock, beginning to pump. I’m barely holding on myself and so I just give in to what I really want to do and start fucking him with sharp, hard snaps of my hips. His other hand flies back behind him to clutch at the headboard and so I fuck him even harder, making it crash into the wall with each thrust, the bed frame creaking beneath us.
As if she can’t tell I practically know the exact number of hours since I last saw Draco; since I’d left him standing outside my bedroom, kissed within an inch of his life, his wide eyes and pink mouth and shocked expression making him appear helpless and innocent.
is a shithole!” Draco declares brightly, already getting to his feet, grabbing his cloak and gloves. “I’m going to brew you something that doesn’t taste like death, Potter.”
Potter doesn’t respond to that, instead taking one, then another, careful step back and away from Draco, fingers clenching around the blanket and drawing it tighter around himself. Then he repeats, “What do you want?”
Both of them remain silent, staring off in opposite directions, Malfoy’s face as pink as his own probably is, bearing the same shock he himself feels. “Sorry,” Harry eventually mumbles again.
“Don’t get snot and tears on me now, Potter,” he ribs, eyes twinkling. “Page two hundred and fourteen, if you please?” he adds, nodding towards the book. “I think there’s going to be a particularly randy love scene in a couple of pages.” Malfoy winks saucily and makes a show of settling down comfortably in the nest of pillows.
Some of the other ideas they’ve traded so far have been a new house-elf (Draco’s) , yoga lessons to help control his, albeit rare, bursts of rage (Granger’s), a pair of freshly hatched peachicks (Draco’s), bespoke dress robes (Granger’s), the sword of Gryffindor — a replica if not the original — (Draco’s), monogrammed, personalised Quidditch gear for his coaching sessions (Granger’s), and a lifetime supply of Sleekeazy’s (Draco’s). He’s convinced his ideas are some of the best he’s ever had but Granger is a particularly annoying specimen and has rejected them
Malfoy shrugs, turning away with his precariously placed pile of paperwork and, as he trots out, Harry pretends not to be nearly overwhelmed by the perfect rotundity of his bubble bum – were they even
I shrug, eating a bite of chicken and rice just for something to do, pushing the food around my plate, feeling restless and unhappy.
Draco flushes and returns the nod with a slightly jerky one of his own, walking forward and sinking onto the sofa with his legs spread wide, propriety be damned. Potter playfully hustles Weasley out, grinning at Granger as he follows; at the doorway, he slants Draco a small, private smile that’s almost a touch on the cheek by itself.
He felt like an utter arsehole. Anybody who even vaguely knew Malfoy would know that it probably killed him to do what he did, to earn his living by being yelled at and snubbed by people over the phone. Harry felt an odd mixture of remorse and genuine sympathy for Malfoy.
curious though. Malfoy had mentioned having been on the run with Scorpius for three months now. Scorpius had mentioned his mother but she hadn’t made an appearance yet.
!” he shrieks, as Harry pulls out and shoves back in once, then again, and another time, before rucking up the rumpled cream shirt, grasping his hips and yanking them outwards. His own come slicks the way as he then proceeds to pound into Malfoy, over and over again, huffing out a breathless guffaw as Malfoy scrabbles viciously at the wall and screams, “Merlin’s fucking
Draco went very still, feeling like he’d been slapped. Weasley had gone purple in the face. Potter had his face in his hands and Granger looked utterly aghast.
“Okay,” Malfoy said and walked over to one side of the courtyard and sat down with a soft sigh. When he found Harry watching him in silence, he raised an eyebrow. “What?”
Draco doesn’t bother sticking around. He’s out of the gents’ and halfway down the corridor before the urge to pull out his wand and hex the stupid fossil wins – the urge to transform and peck his eyes out not far behind.
And so, on Halloween, as they strolled around the grounds together before dinner, Malfoy huddled under his cloak, the hood pulled low enough to cover his ears, his nose and cheeks pink from the autumn chill, Harry decided to throw caution to the winds. Malfoy was in the middle of a rant about their new Defence professor, when Harry halted him with a light hand on his arm.
Malfoy’s lips twitched but he didn’t quite smile. Slowly he reached for the tea and after a beat, during which Harry stood at glowered at him, he took a sip.
Draco wakes up on June fifth with an obscenely large bouquet of colour-changing roses, delicate and filling the room with a lush sweetness. When he gets out of bed and checks the card, he’s barely able to read Potter’s illegible scrawl:
Finally I clear my throat and straighten my back. “Erm. So, I’ve been out of town and just got back. So I’m not really sure what’s going on. Is—is Simon okay? What happened?”
, Potter,” drawls a posh, terribly familiar voice from the doorway and Harry jerks, looking around with his face heating so quickly that he can feel sweat starting to bead on his brow. Malfoy leans one shoulder on the doorframe, crisp, slim-cut robes in a pale, sky blue cascading down his willowy frame as he lounges there and smirks, grey eyes
He grins, turning back to the mirror to gingerly dab at the blue crap on his face with one stiffly held finger.
(and also Harry’s pride, he supposed) – that he’d spotted one more gift, half-hidden under the folds of his bedcovers. Wrapped in delicate silver paper with little silver Snitches on it, Draco had lifted the lid of the nondescript black box to discover – a Snitch.
The contrast between the clean, homey warmth of this room and the dingy, dank hallway he’d just come from is startlingly stark, and it throws Draco a little as he stands there blankly, turning around on the spot and blinking around the room. He feels a little lost and a lot stupid, not to mention nervous and suddenly, quite out of nowhere, scared.
Harry’s expression turns slightly severe. “Please don’t be a prat about this,” he says softly, though his tone has an edge to it. “If I’d hurt you—if I'd tried to—”
it was to keep my distance before?!” He brings one hand behind Draco’s head, tugging off the black ribbon that’s already come loose during the course of their vigorous necking over the past half an hour, and sending it fluttering to the floor, pulling Draco’s hair out of the shapeless ponytail into a wide, white-gold fan around his head. “I have trouble breathing every time I lay eyes on you,” he murmurs, his gaze fixed on his own hand as it runs through Draco’s hair. “You’re
“Because you’re not?” Harry waves his wand a little too vigorously and the canister cleans itself with an indignant squeak, sparkling up at Harry as he lets it swing back into place.
,” he says pointedly, and Potter laughs that laugh again, the one that makes his eyes crinkle, and face soften, and Draco’s heart skip.
“You’re a shit dancer, Potter,” Draco says, already setting his flute of bubbly aside and making to stand up.
open as he panted up at the canopy. Harry kept his gaze on his bobbing Adam’s apple as he lowered his head once again and
“Harry,” he’s panting hard, so short of breath that each gasp is a sharp stab in his chest, “Fuck, I’m already--”
Deeming them sufficiently busy, Draco draws the shower curtain with a quiet scrape and soaps up his cock, slightly hard by now just from the anticipation of a good wank. He rolls his fist over it in long, slippery strokes, soaping the folds of his foreskin and carefully reaching lower to soap his sac.
Harry stares at him for a long moment, expression pained and turbulent, eyes slightly wild. He releases Draco and steps back, turning away and raking a hand through his hair before sighing and facing Draco again. “I—it’s the full moon in a couple of days,” he says, voice gravelly and strained.
wasn’t sure – he said he’d specifically asked you not to do it, not to come anywhere near him during the full moon. But you went anyway!”
Crying out softly, Draco wrenches himself out of the kiss, desperately gasping in shrill wheezes for air, squirming and disentangling one hand from Potter’s hair to reach back and tug weakly at one of Potter’s, shuddering every few seconds just from the ravenous
When Malfoy’s arse is drooling lube and spasming open around Harry’s thrusting fingers, he crawls over him and lines up, bending Malfoy in half as he slings his knees over his shoulders.
Hermione sits down again, picking up her quill and clearing her throat softly. “Morning sickness?” she prods gently. “Bloating? Have you been eating properly? Changes in sleep patterns?”
” Draco’s voice was cracked with nervousness but he covered it up by rudely flipping Weasley the bird when he turned around to scowl at Draco.
I make a detour to his swanky kitchen, full of all the blindingly shiny appliances that the tosser barely even uses to grab a bottle of London Pride from the fridge.
“’s pretty,” Potter says softly, playing with his braid for a moment longer before carefully dropping it over his shoulder so it hangs down his back instead. Staring at Draco for a moment longer, Potter turns away, padding over to one of the sofa chairs and plucking up what appears to be the same faded, red t-shirt he’d been wearing the first time Draco saw him the week before.
Unfortunately, Moody was exceptionally swift to squeeze in behind the fridge and drag the robes in after him and by the time Draco skidded in, he’d disappeared.
“Whoever it is you’re shagging,” she says, rolling her eyes and cocking one hip out as she crosses her arms. “You’ve been all goofy grins and dreamy sighs this whole week and it’s a little disgusting.” She pulls out the chair in front of his desk and plops into it, crossing one knee over the other and sitting back with a frown. “So
show me, then, if it’s so easy!” Draco snaps, four days later, when he’s still not managed to produce even a tiny wisp. “
Potter slants him an exasperated grin, playfully digging his fingers into the arch of Draco’s foot. “You never mentioned wanting to go flying,” he says vaguely, peering at an illustration of a heavily pregnant wizard stowing away his broom and then patting his bump. “Tell me if you’d like to; I still have access to every stadium in England and Scotland and have about fourteen new brooms still in their casing.”
!” Draco howls when Potter’s fingers don’t stop and his mouth descends once more to lick at Draco’s stretched rim around his fingers. “Potter, I—I need a—please, one second,
!” Malfoy shrieks, beginning to convulse as Harry feels warm spunk splatter over his wrist and hand, his arse going impossibly tight. “Harry!” he cries on a sob, head still tilted back where Harry is pulling on it, back dipped low.
The fire burned on. Harry sat beside her and stroked Lily’s head until she fell asleep. The boys lay whispering together for a while, shifting restlessly. Eventually, they fell asleep too. He transfigured another bed sheet, took off his shoes and lay down under a blanket. His body ached with fatigue and the extreme cold it had withstood. He supposed he ought to at least eat some chocolate; they’d packed plenty. But he couldn’t stand the thought of putting anything in his mouth.
Harry, is a persistent, nearly incapacitating need in Draco now, and when, several seconds later, he realises that Harry is moving, is walking down Draco’s hallway with Draco still wrapped around him, he starts sending out random, slightly hysterical prayers of gratitude. The nervousness that he ought to have felt during this moment, when he just
“You’re a bloke too, why aren’t you asking me if I’m into you?!” retorts Harry, flustered and defensive.
“I don’t know,” Malfoy said once more, and Harry was completely certain that he was smiling – he could see it when he closed his eyes; pink lips spreading into that slow smirk, grey eyes sparkling with mischief, pink spots of excitement high on sharp cheekbones. “I was just doing my job, Potter.”
There was movement across the clearing and when he peered over his sleeping children, he saw Malfoy sit up and carefully tuck his cloak around Scorpius’ sleeping form. Then he leaned back against the nearest tree, drew his knees up to settle his arms upon, and rested his head on them.
smart – along with being surprisingly sentient, and not at all crass anymore. He didn’t seem particularly inclined to broach the subject of the War, but when Harry did, quite by accident, and not at all in any kind of direct relation to Malfoy’s role in it, Malfoy simply blinked, lips tightening slightly, before nodding and softly responding.
“Right, so, you want me to get fat,” Draco says flatly, taking a huge bite of the pastry and sagging into his chair with a rather lewd moan. When he glances up, Potter is staring at him, rather wide-eyed.
But Harry just shakes his head vigorously, sobbing great, heaving sobs into Draco’s shoulder, bent over at the waist as he clings to Draco. It’s with some effort that Draco swallows his own tears – he’ll never get used to this, never know how to deal with it when Harry cracks like this.
“What the fuck is your problem with the man, Harry?” I mutter as I wait for Zabini to notice me slouched across the bar.
Wordlessly, I walk away, leaving him standing there as I go into my room and loudly and pointedly lock the door behind me.
“What I meant to say is,” Potter says slowly with a deep breath, “I don’t really care about money. I’d have paid double—triple the amount I paid for it, but I’d have bought it for you either way; that’s not something you should part with, Malfoy,” he gives Draco that same soft smile, “I still wear the one I got when I came of age and it’s a Prewett hand-me-down; I’d
to be able to contact you, Harry; you keep warding your Floo shut!”), Harry stomped over to it, lifted the receiver and slammed it back down with a loud
Draco’s nostrils flare and even though Potter’s demeanour is polite and innocuous, he finds himself struggling to control the urge to bark at him to back off and mind his own fucking business. “No,” he says stiffly, not elaborating.
“Can I help you, Weasley?” Draco snaps when several seconds later, Weasley still hasn’t stopped gawking.
“My children are fine,” Harry said. He stepped forward and set the food down in front of Malfoy. “For heaven’s sake, feed your son something.”
Harry keeps his word and leads Malfoy to the Floo after breakfast the next morning to take him to see his parents.
“Because he’ll need to add in a bit of hair for the suppressant to be successfully introduced into his bloodstream,” Hermione answers, staring curiously at Malfoy, “A bit of his own DNA. Malfoy,” Hermione’s eyes are suddenly bulging a bit, utter disbelief writ across her face. “Malfoy, are you a
“Ron!” I squeak as he abruptly disappears from my peripheral vision, the sudden distraction enough to make my arms immediately tremble with strain. “You wankers!” I can hear them shoving and pushing at each other, Draco sniggering, Ron growling expletives. “
They hadn’t slept in the same bed last night – a habit they’d seamlessly fallen into since the night Harry had knotted him. And now Harry cannot bear to think that it might’ve been the last night they’d ever spend under the same roof, not to mention his last chance to have held Malfoy as they slept.
Harry remembers being so completely out of it that when he’d finally spotted the head of platinum blond, glinting under the multicoloured strobe lights, he’d not given himself more than two seconds to consider it before meandering over, ears ringing and vision swimming. He’d felt like someone he’d never ordinarily be, someone who’d regularly and gleefully throw back drinks with mysterious pills mixed into them, someone who’d find nothing more amusing than bellowing at his friend to climb atop a bar and thrust his pelvis out at the room – he’d felt more reckless than he had in years, had felt exhilarated and
When Draco’s cock twitches threateningly, he pulls away, hurriedly crawling backwards until he’s straddling Harry’s pelvis again, Summoning the lube shakily and swallowing hard as he drags himself back together, arse clenching emptily as he snaps open the tube and looks up at Harry. He’s watching Draco unblinkingly, eyes lust-blown and almost black, mouth slick and pink. Licking his lips, Draco pauses a moment, keeping their gazes locked as he contemplates just giving in to that habitual urge to let Harry have his way with him.
Bandaged hands flew up to grab onto the planes of his shoulders, Malfoy grimacing as he successfully swallowed the sound that nearly escaped him, instead planting his feet flat on the bed and bucking up into Harry again. Harry groaned, lost the patience that he’d surprisingly managed to hold onto until that point, and kissed Malfoy.
He wanted to reach out and grip Malfoy’s shoulder to show solidarity because that just seemed like the normal thing to do. But Malfoy just seemed so...untouchable. Like even when only two feet away, he was somehow out of reach.
of shock, leaning forward in gleeful incredulity, eyes huge. “You’re joking!” he exclaims. “Harry, that’s fantastic! We’d be working in the same—”
“Hey,” I reply. I don’t know what to say after that when the silence stretches on and this is such an alien experience of awkwardness with Draco that it just exacerbates my stinging unhappiness.
He rears up with a screech, one hand shoving Potter’s head away, the other reaching down to ruthlessly squeeze his cock until the sudden, overwhelming urge to come all over himself subsides. Potter is sitting up beside him, lips parted slightly as he stares down at a desperately panting Draco in apparent bewilderment.
He shifts lightly, his chest tight and painful as he breathes in desperately, his cock slipping out of Potter’s mouth as he lifts off a tiny bit. “Potter...”
“I’m going to make you forget every single one of those men.” It sounds like a promise and I sound very serious.
,” he says with a decent approximation of a playful sneer and Draco just looks away and back at the blob on the wall, biting his lip over a smile.
Rolling his eyes, Draco smiles back and takes Potter’s hand, firmly pumping it once before watching in astonishment as Potter lifts their joined hands and kisses the back of Draco’s, keeping their gazes locked together as he does.
,” he says, his mouth twitching as though he wants to laugh. Draco’s nostrils flare in irritation and he glares, making Potter grin.
It had been a lazy Saturday morning when Draco had first noticed it. Harry, topless and drowsy, his back to Draco, had been making breakfast and humming to himself. Draco had been sat at the table reading the gossip section of the
the sort of thing your lot gets up to, though? Funding new hospital wards, rebuilding schools, buying an ex-Death Eater breakfast?”
Although he very much doubts he has it in him to ever face Potter again, he can’t stand that he has to wait two whole days before he sees the bastard again. And he can’t help but wonder if they would find another stairwell to meet in on Monday.
The front door swung open. It wasn’t flung open with a dramatic crash like in the movies. It creaked open slowly but nobody appeared. Outside, the night was pitch black and abnormally cold.
Pearce Erickson smells like dog, Draco decides as he folds himself into one of the rickety chairs in front of the other man’s desk.
He grabs up his own bottle of water and drains it in one gulp before he jogs lightly towards Malfoy, the ground soft from the rains earlier, the air cool and dense with moisture. It takes Harry a practiced burst of control not to sprint towards the stands at full speed like a maniac but it wouldn’t do to startle him and everyone else present — as it is, his feet seem to barely hit the ground but by the time he reaches the stands, he’s trembling with the pent up energy his body is demanding he spend.
“I never had much hope in the first place, all right?” Harry says impatiently, leaning his head against the back of the sofa. “Even before this fucking mess – I never actually thought there’d be this
“He’s really surprised me, though,” Ron goes on and I grit my teeth around a mouthful of ale. “Malfoy, I mean. I can’t believe he’s been with that guy for as long as he has now – what, two months?” I don’t reply once again and just sit there hoping he’ll drop it. “I mean, one minute he’s taking home three guys at once, and the next he has a steady boyfriend.” Ron sounds more confused than anything and I suddenly wish I’d refused when Ron had asked me earlier today if I was up for impromptu pizza night.
For then Harry descended on him, one arm winding around Draco’s waist and pulling, the Snitch’s wings fluttering against the small of his back, his other hand pushing into Draco’s hair as he crushed their mouths together.
Maybe it’s the stubble, Draco thinks quietly now, watching discreetly as Potter lifts a hand to let Granger’s friendly little otter butt it’s silvery head into his palm before streaking off to her again. Potter’s nearly always wearing a very light stubble, like he can’t be bothered to put much thought or effort into his shaving spells. Maybe it’s the way Potter’s smile doesn’t very often reach his eyes anymore, although these smiles
believe you fucked me out here in the open like that,” Malfoy says blankly when Harry pulls him close and brushes his hair off his face. “We’re not telling people that this happened here; we’re telling them you fucked me on a bed with white, silk sheets, layered with red roses.”
Potter’s mouth quirks up on one side, the look in his eyes making Draco’s heart do a somersault. “Clearly,” he says, calm and unruffled – and bucks his hips pointedly, nearly sending Draco into a moaning rut.
Until Harry, who’d stood there helplessly the whole time, suddenly stepped forward, curled a hand around Malfoy’s elbow and dragged him firmly away in the opposite direction, Ron still yelling after them.
Fifteen minutes later, Harry had lain curled up on his side, tears of agony dripping off his nose, his whole body shaking from the pain and covered in sweat. “Okay,” he wheezed. “No more draining, then. Next option?”
He bites off to a stop, whirling around and stalking up to the sofa, flinging himself onto it and bringing his knees up to his chest, staring over them with his head in his hands. “Sorry,” he says quietly.
If Draco is a little disappointed that Potter doesn’t answer the door this time, he doesn’t let it show. He sweeps in after the house-elf after he’s been let in, and then quietly makes his way upstairs upon being pointed up. He gets all the way up to that wide open, bright living room when he abruptly stops upon hearing voices.
The hospital wing was dark and pleasantly cool and most of the beds seemed empty except for the one beside Harry’s own, its curtains firmly shut all around. Sleep took over effortlessly and Harry sighed again as he let it, blinkingly slowly as he watched the blurred form of Madam Pomfrey bustle over to his neighbour’s bed from the other side. He heard the rustle of the curtains being drawn aside and then Pomfrey spoke softly.
tight channel giving way, opening up, as his wildly twitching cock ploughs in. Harry doesn’t even have to pull out and start thrusting before he’s spilling into Malfoy, gasping out his climax into the neck he’d bruised a few minutes ago.
the fuck is your problem, you slimy shit?” he hisses, and Draco’s cock gleefully twitches to life in his pants.
Harry hated to watch these little unintended displays of casual affection. It usually made him feel startlingly lonely.
Harry licked his lips, barely aware of his own unblinking staring until Malfoy waved his hand rudely under his nose.
Potter looks up now and Draco’s belly plummets as their eyes meet. He smiles at Draco, soft and friendly, and gets to his feet, strolling up to him through the sludge.
“I want you again,” Harry said flatly, his heart soaring at the way Malfoy’s cheeks coloured again, this time in a strangely endearing way.
Immediately, though, the ferret set up a round of extremely indignant chattering, falling onto its back and rolling over once before scuttling off to his cage in a temper, his little paws slipping on the smooth floor.
--” He scrambles up quickly, lips wet with Draco’s spit, glasses askew, his white t-shirt snug enough that Draco can see where his nipples have pebbled. He’s already hard, his erection a neat little bulge in his worn blue jeans, and his gaze strays over Draco’s bare chest before snagging with burning grey, at which point he gulps hard and stammers, “I—I’m sorry.”
“Is this somehow related to my pregnancy, Potter?” he asks, cool and polite. “Because if not, I don’t see how it’s any of your business.”
They talked after that, a lot: while studying together each evening, and then starting to walk to their classes together, eventually even sitting together during the lessons they shared. Malfoy helped Harry with Potions and Transfiguration, Harry helped him with practical Defence and some Advanced Charms he’d inadvertently learnt by himself over the previous few years. Eventually they started sitting beside each other at mealtimes, sharing common room passwords, playing chess before bed during the week, and flying together after breakfast during the weekends. Eventually they didn’t wait for lessons, or homework, to start spending time together.
Potter enquiring as to whether Draco is all right. He doesn’t want Potter to willingly sink to his knees, suck Draco off and then hold steady so that Draco can come all over his face.
Malfoy didn’t look surprised to see Harry. When Harry bolted over and carefully turned Malfoy onto his back, Malfoy looked absolutely livid.
Lily shifted restlessly in his arms, sighing in exhaustion, and Harry looked up at the sky before looking around the clearing again. “Not tonight. I have no energy left for Apparition tonight. Is it safe here?”
“Let’s burn that thing off his arm,” the third one said, and the calm intent with which that one spoke sent Harry’s blood running cold. “Push his sleeve up and hold him down; I’ll do it.”
Draco is fervently grateful for having already showered and changed into free flowing robes because he’s now completely and blissfully hard and some part of his brain frets that his erection is tenting his robes and that Potter is seconds away from noticing and then he would
“Right, and we’ve been doing it because...” Draco steps closer, arms still crossed, frowning thoughtfully at the ceiling, “...this whole thing will be easier if we’re on at least semi-friendly terms.”
“Young Master Black,” it croaks, using the same tone and tune that one would while chiming a glib, ‘
“Knafeh.” Draco gestures grandly with one hand. “Some sort of Turkish...cheesecake, I believe?” He peers into the box curiously. “Compliments of Mr. Yusuf Ahmed,” he says and shrugs, slapping my hand away sharply as I go to poke a finger into the cake.
“Well, I’ll tell you what,” Potter says matter-of-factly, eyes twinkling, “When you’re stinking rich again someday—”
him, smacking his palm down over his arse so hard that the cheek wobbles deliciously and the crack of the strike resonates around the confined space they’re in. “
“Fuck, you’re damn near impossible,” he shakes his head, watching Malfoy blow his pinkened nose into the apron, “Are you alright?” he adds quietly.
Getting off to the memory of Potter’s most recent dose of insults seems positively tame in the face of all
It was the sight of the remaining two students aiming relentless kicks into Malfoy’s sides, probably still tender from last time, and the sound of Malfoy’s pained, stifled grunts, that made Harry take three long strides forward, and Stun the whole trio with a single, wordless spell.
And so when a shirtless bloke with a chiselled chest and rock hard abs dances up behind Malfoy and begins grinding against him, Harry, rather tipsy by then, snaps.
Draco burrows sleepily into the curve of Harry’s throat, sighing as they tangle together impossibly close. “Yourself,” he replies.
into him, the bastard, and Draco’s right knee promptly gives away. Hurriedly grabbing one polished brass door handle to hold himself up, Draco flails, reaching back intending to push Potter’s head away but instead wrapping Potter’s hair around his fingers and grabbing.
Mouth still too full to answer, Draco nods vigorously, hair falling onto his face, cheeks red with mortification even as he tries to return Potter’s watery little smile. Squeezing his hand once more, Potter finally releases it, leaning back to pick up his fork again, shooting bright little smiles at Draco as he slowly finishes chewing half a plateful of food at once.
In reply, Harry simply stared pointedly at Malfoy’s tented crotch, now clearly visible, with a raised eyebrow.
Harry’s jaw clenches as he grits his teeth, fist closing around several loose sheets of parchment in an old case file as he adjusts his uniform to fall more freely over his front. “Oh, I’m so
Malfoy’s eyes widened in sheer disbelief, his mouth falling open slightly as he gaped at Harry as if he was the stupidest fucking thing alive--
?!” Harry grit out, baring his teeth at him as he pushed himself up into a half-sit. “That’s fucking
“I’m—I thought you might be tired,” Draco pants when he pulls away, mouth tingling wetly. Harry’s hands, until now on Draco’s hips, slide down to cup his arse and
“Of course I remember,” Draco interrupts calmly, his hand never stilling in Harry’s hair. “And I’m still very grateful. I also realise that she deserves more than a little credit for...us.” He remains silent for a few seconds after that, abruptly adding, “I bought them both gifts, you know, even for that wretch
When Harry looks around he sees that Malfoy’s face is now bloodless, his breath coming out of him in rattling wheezes. “I—I don’t know what you’re talking about, Granger,” he says after a moment, sounding strained.
Draco flips the shiny gold clasp open and lifts the lid, carefully letting it fall back on its hinge, and Potter takes a step forward. Inside, there are five orderly rows of six vials each, all of them sitting primly in their velvet lined slots. Draco picks out one, the silvery, pearlescent potion inside swirling delicately, and wordlessly hands it over to Potter who holds out one hand, palm up, like a child, to accept it.
“Potter, Muggles have the most atrocious sense of fashion,” he declares tightly, looking out into the street.
“So you’re telling me,” Harry said serenely, hands clasped over his midriff, “that this...problem has no actual medical cure?”
be more careful?! Bloody bumbling son of a—” He breaks off cursing midway, lifting his injured foot to clutch at it—
!” Draco twists with another drawn out cry when Potter suddenly shifts to take the other one into his mouth, “Can we reserve this
“But...” Draco looks around blankly, his wand hanging limply by his side. “But...we hate each other,” he repeats feebly.
“Fuck me,” Draco says at once and with an abject lack of shame. “Put your cock inside me, Potter. Fuck me.”
It’s hot and velvety in his hand, throbbing as he eases the thin, delicate folds of his foreskin further down, the head glistening with precome as it emerges. Draco’s breaths are ragged, rattling pants of shameless lust, his own cock jerking in his pants as he settles more comfortably in place, tucks a stray strand of hair behind his ear and takes Potter into his mouth.
Harry looked up, vision still clouded with tears. They were in a tiny clearing. Crickets chirped in the trees around them. There was a rushing sound that Harry first thought was in his head; then he recognised it as gushing water.
More than anything else Draco can still feel that ache in his chest that he’d felt every time Potter said his name with something akin to fondness. The way Draco’s every resolve to be sharp and aloof dissolved under the bastard’s touch. The way his eyes had lingered on Draco’s mouth, making Draco’s heart fling itself around his chest, and the way his fingers brushed over the sensitive inside of Draco’s wrist, making his whole body tingle.
Harry was exhausted, and the sight of Malfoy’s thin, grim face pissed him off. “For heaven’s sake,” he snapped. “What, you think I’m going to
“That Rick Griffith guy!” I grit furiously and his silver eyes widen for a moment before Draco guffaws loudly, cheeks flushing with mirth. “Why does Parkinson keep inviting him to her thrashes?!”
Malfoy was silent for a moment. “No,” he said. “No, I won’t pretend.” And then, “My sympathies, Potter.”
“At the risk of causing an explosion of smug complacency,” he says, his lips twitching, “I may have forgotten my past...conquests.”
Potter goes beet red and splutters at Draco for several seconds, finally hacking loudly into one fist. “To be fair,” he mumbles after clearing his throat noisily, “it’s the least we can be considering all that we’ve already done.”
“I...didn’t believe it until a few days ago,” Draco admits. “I thought it was a rumour made up as a bad excuse for you leaving the Auror corps. I met your house-elf as it collected your dose of Wolfsbane on Thursday and...well, there was no questioning it anymore, I suppose.”
, Potter!” Draco shouts, flinging an arm out and pointing at where his shapeless wisp had disappeared. “You think I can send someone a message with
, Draco runs both hands feverishly across every bit of Potter he can reach, his smooth, undulating back, his taut arse, his hard, chiselled chest, his flat, fluttering abdomen, his damply jutting cock. Potter shudders and whines against Draco, pressing into his hands and rutting against his flank, finally pulling his mouth away to bury his face in Draco’s neck with a groan.
By the time July rolls to an end, it’s blisteringly hot and nearly always threatening to break into an epic thunderstorm. They don’t venture out much during the day, preferring to stay indoors, sucking on ice lollies in varying states of undress with the Cooling Charms on. Potter doesn’t go out by himself very often either, attending a lot of his meetings via Floo calls or not at all, spending most of his free time with Draco desperately writhing under him.
Potter simply shakes his head with a frown. “We’re not here for me,” he says. And then, “May I ask what memory you’re using?”
Prongs’ antlers caught on the dementor and flung it away from Albus. Harry grabbed his arm and dragged him away, Albus’ sneakers squeaking against the floorboards as he tried to get upright.
“I want to.” My voice is rough. “Draco. I want to. I just...” I’m scared, I want to say. “Tomorrow’s our first day at work after the holidays, yeah?” He nods. “Don’t wanna go into work feeling like shit.”
Ron is looking for his scarf, distractedly telling Hermione to carry on through the Floo. I edge over – Draco has just headed into the kitchen – and grab Ron by the arm.
“God, yes,” Draco whispered as Harry began to paint swift little licks onto his hole, each stroke pressing inside until Draco could
“I do.” Malfoy seemed slightly smug as he added, “Scorpius has a little knife of his own that’s made of gold too.”
I look at them helplessly, not knowing how to tastefully reveal that we’d got off together by simply rubbing against each other, like teenagers, once; and that Draco had sucked me off in the loo at the pub once after that and I’d nearly
“I’b really dud with this cold,” he declares irritably, groping around for his handkerchief again, the silver M monogrammed onto the dove grey material standing out brightly before he buries his face in it and blows his nose again. Emerging with a sigh he says, voice less stuffy now, “I’m more than a little disappointed that I haven’t managed to snog some germs into you as well.”
“Draco!” Her voice carries a definite quaver to it and when Harry quickly steals a glance, he notices Malfoy’s face crumpling as he jumps to his feet and approaches Narcissa who’s holding her arms out for him. “Darling, I’ve missed you.” Narcissa’s sobbed whisper carries easily and Harry rises to his feet slowly, gaze locked with Lucius’.
“Everything about me is wrong, Potter, haven’t you heard?” Malfoy drawled, although his voice came out thick and wet.
“I’m not a prude!” I flare up at once only for him to snort and throw me a look of incredulity.  “Full English,” I hurriedly place my order before the idiot can start again about his night.
Potter, who shut his eyes after snarling so rudely at Draco, sighs, rubbing them before abruptly yawning widely. “There is no way to help me now, Malfoy,” he says, voice rough with fatigue. “Trust me, I’ve checked.
“Awfully sure about that, are we?” Draco deadpans. “So confident I’m going to have significant wealth to my name again, eventually?”
I have the door half open and I look back when he whines, obediently pausing in my tracks. Someone tries to push the door open from outside and I stumble back.
Potter laughs, turning away as he shakes his head. “Stop faffing around, you git,” he says, beckoning Draco over. “Decide on some other happy memory and let’s give it another go.”
“Thank you, Mr. Potter,” Scorpius said, and he sounded so anxious that Harry stopped and turned back.
He found James in the master bedroom, and as he watched, the boy ran into the en suite, the whole time looking eager and rather wild-eyed, as though expecting Ginny to pop up with a bright
“Your hair.” I lift one hand to fondle a strand of the shiny silk and then tuck it behind his ear. “’s pretty.”
Draco shrieks, thrashing and managing to shove one socked foot into Harry’s chest as they flail around together, Harry’s breathless laughter and Draco’s obscene swearing ringing around the otherwise still room.
“So what’d you decide to bring for dessert?” I ask, lowering the spoon to admire him. He’s wearing a snow white turtleneck with perfectly tailored khaki trousers and he quite literally takes my fucking breath away. So I just stand there, not breathing, as he marches up to the fridge; the trousers hug his arse so perfectly that I want to stab myself.
“Like shit yesterday, yeah,” Harry nods, “When he walked in, I swear I didn’t recognise him for a few seconds. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days, and as if he hadn’t eaten in a while, and just...ill.”
,” Malfoy replies sharply, and Harry, trembling with barely suppressed rage, draws a deep breath, Malfoy’s harsh tone somehow comforting in the moment in the fact of Lucius’ arrogant superiority. “But that doesn’t even matter because you both still left the
I lean back in my seat, my vision going blurry. I’m breathing through my mouth, loud rasps that come out sounding like I’m choking. My heart is flinging itself around my chest, hysterical and slightly mad. I feel like I’ve been immersed in ice water, my arms and legs breaking out in gooseflesh and beginning to tremble.
When Malfoy doesn’t move at all, Harry drags his gaze back to him to find Malfoy staring up at him, chagrined and resigned, almost as though he hates
“I’m not embarrassed,” Harry said at once, biting back laughter before wondering how he’s even able to produce laughter after tonight.
He can see Potter’s come dripping out of his hole before his tongue, in a flash of vivid pink, swipes it up, Potter pushing it into the sloppy hole without bothering to pretend that he’s utilising any particular technique or skill. His rim flutters and clenches and Draco fucks that tongue as he comes all over himself, holding Potter’s head firmly in place so he can eat Draco right through it, tongue and teeth and lips not ceasing to work his arse further open until Draco groans and pushes him away instead.
of it, so far. The afternoon they first kissed, they snogged until they’d broken out in sweat, and had then gone and gotten lunch at the little Italian joint in Draco’s neighbourhood. The day after that, Draco had gone over to Grimmauld on the pretext of delivering the Sleeping Draught he’d finally managed to brew successfully, without Potter having been there to distract him, and Potter and he had promptly relapsed into frantic snogging, which eventually led to some even more frantic rutting on Potter’s sofa, followed by some more snogging, this time less frantic. He’s since been back to Grimmauld every evening after work because they’re apparently no different from a pair of desperately randy teens who want to spend all their time kissing each other senseless and coming in their pants, and no time at all talking about what it all means.
“No, but I’m willing to try,” Harry retorts grimly. “I’m willing to put the past behind us. I’m willing to make a fresh start. I—we owe it to—it’s the least we can do as two fucking
He smiles again with a little nod, making to turn away to fetch his cloak, when there’s a soft tinkle of glass hitting the fluffy carpet they’re standing on, and Potter grabs Draco’s hand in an unbreakable grip, his skin scorching hot against Draco’s own. Draco turns, gasping a little, and then freezing at the look on Potter’s face.
Draco doesn’t answer at once. He takes a small sip of tea, perfectly brewed and put together, he clears his throat several times, tries to tuck back a long, errant strand of hair that’s escaped his ponytail, and then decides to undo and retie his ponytail altogether. He examines his nails, takes another sip of tea – still perfect – and then finally looks up at the man sitting across from him, intently staring at Draco.
“Pansy said it would do something or the other,” he replies irritably. “I’m sure this is just some cheap crap from those horrid BeWitching Beauty pamphlets that she wanted to get rid of.”
“No, thank you,” Draco says hurriedly in horror, picking up and throwing a wildflower at Potter when he laughs at him. “I’m
part with it. I can’t even imagine how hard it must have been for you to sell yours. This is honestly the least I could’ve done for you on your birthday.”
“Maybe, but the sex is pretty fucking brilliant,” Potter states, going back for the coffee pot and two mugs. “Will you sit down?”
“Are you complaining?” Harry asked mildly before running the very tip of his tongue in a lazy circle along the inside of his rim. Draco
He’s lifted right off the floor, Harry bending his knees slightly to receive the dead weight of Draco slamming into him with the force of a fucking freight train, and scooping him up, so that suddenly, Draco finds himself with his legs coiled around Harry’s waist, practically crushing his sternum with his thighs. He pants down at Harry, whose eyes sparkle at him, his mouth curved into that smile Draco yearns to see every day, his hands crushing Draco to himself.
He couldn’t look at the bruise on his chest without remembering how it had throbbed under Malfoy’s weight as he lay on his chest, whimpering and overwhelmed. He chewed lightly over the healed nick on his lip, remembering the feel of Malfoy’s mouth, fever-hot and eager, against it. Hell, he couldn’t wank in the shower anymore without fantasising about being inside Malfoy again.
Nursing his foot, Draco drew himself a bath. He decided that a nifty hex or two along the bedroom doorway and around the wardrobes that would send out electric shocks should instantly ensure that the stupid creature would get nowhere near his clothes again.
” I ask in shock, pushing at his shoulder as I peer around at his face to check if he’s having us on while Ron yelps and pulls his plate out of Draco’s reach.
“Any excuse to, Potter,” Malfoy quips, wrapping long arms around his chest and wiggling even closer as the bike jerks forward. “I’ve been looking for one for years now.”
show me the same courtesy, were I to go out there and find myself a juicy little pull for the night. Noble hero like you would be more than accommodative, no?”
“My back is killing me,” said Draco drily, quirking a crooked smile at the other boy before struggling off his lap (and cock). He slid off his thighs, landing on his bum with a grunt, hissing at the blunt pressure against his puffy hole, his arse deliciously sore.
“I think we should have Hermione help us with this for the time being, Malfoy,” Harry says quickly, noting the way Malfoy further stiffens, nostrils flaring. “It’s just more convenient this way. She’ll be happy to answer all of our questions and there’s the certainty of discretion with her so...we don’t have to worry about the press or anything for the time being.”
But as the weeks wore on, Draco simply couldn’t manage to bring himself to be a fucking adult and stop instigating Potter at every available opportunity, causing the other man to aim fluent strings of colourful and increasingly imaginative insults at Draco.
yourself Draco? Is that what it was? Is that why you put yourself in danger by going off your suppressant? To
Scorpius’ face grew even pinker. “I...happened to win a little contest hosted by Little Magic magazine and...” Scorpius gulped a bit before continuing. “The winning prize was a letter sent to Harry Potter – personally. They—they sent me your address in a sealed envelope and—and I memorised it.”
Harry wants to do it, to bring life to what he’s been feeling for way too long now by saying the words out loud; and it should’ve been easy to do it with the way Malfoy’s looking at him, all traces of anger and hatred replaced by the sort of softness Harry only ever saw in his eyes when they were being intimate.
“How dare you,” Malfoy says, voice quiet but shaking with rage. “You have absolutely no right, Potter--”
Slowly, as though doing his best to test Harry’s patience, Malfoy reached up and accepted the sandwich. He threw the can of beer a dismissive glance when Harry set it down, and then waited as Harry went back for a sandwich of his own.
“Well—” His voice cracks and he hurriedly clears his throat. “Well, Potter. You...are capable of good taste, I see,” he says loftily. He picks up his flute of champagne and holds it up to me. “To making the right choice at last,” he says and drains the glass.
When he looks around, Harry is staring after it with an expression so thoroughly, comically gobsmacked that Draco bursts out laughing, heaving great big shouts of mirth that makes his sides hurt.
“Potter, I n-need to sit down, you fucking fiend,” Draco says weakly, grinding into Potter’s mouth, his heart thudding so hard that his whole body seems to thrum with the vibrations of each beat. “Potter... AH!” Draco thrashes as Potter finds the thin skin of his loosened, moistened rim and
joys of being a pregnant Veela-wizard (along with the tender nipples, bloated feet, sudden skin sensitivity, extreme, hormone-fuelled mood swings, near-loss of bladder control with each increasingly frequent urge to urinate and the nearly permanent, burning hunger resulting sometimes in delightfully shameless two AM binges in front of the television) were the random shifts in sleep patterns. Draco finds himself wide awake most nights, regardless of the music-box Potter brought him and sometimes regardless of being genuinely tired.
Malfoy hurries to do so, doing up the sagging silver buttons on his robes without looking at either of them, legs dangling off the table. He obediently holds out his arm when Hermione extends a hand, before freezing when she pushes his sleeve up to reveal the faded grey skull on his inner arm.
I unclench my fist and look down. The wings immediately unfurl and beat weakly, but the little gold ball stays in my hand, glinting softly in the afternoon light.
Harry’s cheeks burn hot but he sets his jaw tightly. “Yes, because you’re pregnant with my child,” he says firmly. “And because it’s my responsibility to make sure you’re well cared for during this time. And because this is no place for you to be living in
Malfoy flushes but glares back defiantly at his father. “What we are doesn’t matter,” he says crisply, “What matters is that Harry found me when I wasn’t quite doing very well for myself and very kindly took me in.” There’s a single beat before, “He saved me.”
“Lucius, please,” Narcissa interrupts sharply. “We knew all along that there would be trouble for us if we were found to be living in the continent.”
Harry is straining as though pulling at invisible restraints, wordlessly beseeching Draco, looking guileless and devastated, gently nudging Draco’s hole with his cock over and over until Draco, breath shuddering out of him, sits down all at once, wresting a completely shattered, tremulous keen out of Harry, fat tears leaking out the corners of Harry’s eyes and trickling down his temples where Draco can see his veins standing out.
It’s a Weasely jumper, and Harry almost doesn’t want to take it off for how insanely happy it makes him to see Draco clad in the misshapen, woolly white jumper with Molly’s signature letter on the front. The ‘D’ that Draco has only his is a lot fancier than the standard square ‘H’ that Harry and Hermione always get, along with Ron’s slightly lopsided ‘R’.
Abruptly releasing him and stepping away, Harry nods. “Don’t be too long or I might come looking for you again,” he warns pleasantly and Draco scowls.
“You’d better hope I don’t find traces of even a simple Class Two hex on either of their wands, Harry,” Ron says seriously. “A single wisp of Dark Magic is all I need to have them Portkey’ed to Azkaban
“Who the actual fuck still wears gloves?” Potter rasps, his eyes on Draco’s primly clasped fingers. His gaze travels higher, to the delicate skin of Draco’s exposed wrists, up his silk covered arms, to his long neck, which is slowly flushing pink under his appraising, clearly admiring, gaze.
“I can’t believe I didn’t notice sooner.” Draco shook his head with a sharp flick. “Why didn’t you show me?”
hooking them down so that the last second Draco’s orgasm is drawn out into an agonisingly brilliant eruption of pleasure that has him shrieking and clawing at the door, his spent cock twitching damply against his thigh while Potter massages his prostate with an insistent press that nearly renders Draco unconscious.
“You know what,” Draco stuffs his wand back in with a pathetically trembling hand, “I don’t need this. I’m leaving. I’m fucking
“I have another birthday gift for you,” he blurts suddenly, mouth still hovering inches from Harry’s.
Body burning with arousal, skin flushed and limbs covered in gooseflesh, Draco submits wholly to the kiss, sucking at Harry’s tongue before shoving his own into his mouth, sliding them together in a slick press. Harry moans again, hands desperately mapping Draco’s body – his back, his arse, his flanks, his stomach, his thighs, leaving each patch of skin he touches on fire.
He kissed Malfoy’s hipbone, sharp and prominent, and was suddenly struck by the intimacy of the act; of how incongruent it was with the air around them – they were both tense, still in disbelief, and ready to throw punches at a moment’s notice. Harry wondered if maybe the innocuous hostility in the air was contributing to the undeniable arousal on both ends – Harry’s cock had already leaked a patch right through his pyjamas and onto the sheets.
Harry stared in silence for a long beat; Malfoy remained motionless in the semidarkness, the bluish-green light dancing across his fair hair. He didn’t have any warm clothing on and his cloak was covering Scorpius.
My frown deepens now as I continue to stare down at him now and Draco laughs. “It’s a rather silly thing, nothing great really,” he says breezily.
that night, spellbindingly beautiful to the point where Harry felt discombobulated from it. He’d been arrogant and
, spitting out dribbles of more pungent precome down his throat and over his lips and down his chin. Potter keeps one hand planted in his hair while the other traces the outline of his own cock through Draco’s skin every time he pushes into Draco’s throat and holds him there for a few seconds too long.
?!” Potter asks, sounding genuinely incredulous. “I mean, thank god I’m allowed to touch you now. Do you know how
Speaking of the War, its three most lauded heroes were often present there too, of course. Draco exchanged frequent glances with Weasley, Granger and Potter.
Harry stands there, blinking slowly, expression serene and untouched, not even slightly aware of the silent meltdown Draco is experiencing at the moment.
“In my pants, starting to get pretty generous,” Harry shoots back blandly, resting one elbow on the bar as he surveys the room.
Draco’s ears are ringing as he comes, spilling in short jets along Potter’s crease, making it even slicker. Potter is squirming under him, rutting his cock against the sheets, the muscles in his arse clenching. Draco’s thighs are trembling where he’s kneeling and when Potter lets out a low, plaintive cry and jerks around in his climax, he feels goose bumps rise all over his body.
“I can hate you forever if I want to, Potter,” Malfoy sniffed, “It’s easy because you’re a giant prat.”
Draco drifts for a moment as he recalls the bright blue eyes, the dimpled grin, the way he’d play with Draco’s hair – when he looks up Potter is watching him with a rather dead expression, gaze half-lidded and unamused.
Harry pulls his fingers out to the tip, adds a third and fucks them back in hard enough to make Malfoy lose all sense of himself and scream bloody murder, the alleyway ringing with it. “Romance and sap is for when you’re too old and arthritic to do anything but cuddle and talk about your feelings, Malfoy.” Harry leans over and mouths around his fingers, licking at the skin stretched taut and thin around his knuckles. “Besides, you’ve always ditched the sappy ones you’ve dated in the past – Parkinson talks, you know?”
“No,” Draco nods to the crib when she looks around. “Thank you,” he repeats, low but earnest. She smiles, leaning her head back and regarding him with a pleasant sort of curiosity. “Is this really all you two could plan for his birthday?” Draco blurts exasperatedly, unable to help himself.
Ron frowns, peering into my face. “You all right?” I quickly nod. “You got the Snitch then?” He grins down at my hand.
He always calls them by their full name. I don’t know why. He used to do that back when we first dated too and it used to make Draco nearly piss himself laughing.
“Turn over for me,” he replied huskily, not bothering to wait for Draco to comply, instead just grabbing his hips and unceremoniously flipping him over.
“No no, we knew you guys would love a pet,” Weasley said with a false air of modesty, grinning wickedly at Draco the whole time. Draco’s hand itched to slap him.
Draco sat between Pansy and Granger, his eyes fixed on the thumb sized, scarlet shape on the far end of the pitch, high enough that Draco knew Harry wouldn’t be able to spot
Sliding his groin deeper under his desk, Harry shakes his head vigorously. “No, I’m perfectly fine.”
Angelina shifts in her chair with a groan, one arm curved around her large bump. “I’m not eating again until I’ve got this thing out of me.” George pats her rotund belly with a wide grin and she glares at him. “Did we just have a smug moment?” She narrows her eyes at him.
Potter looks genuinely worried. “Isn’t there something we should be doing about that?” he demands of Granger. “Is it going to--?”
“Shut the fuck up, Gin,” he grits as Hermione rolls her eyes and Vanishes the potato peels with a simple flick of her wand.
“You did take some sort of hex that left you permanently disfigured?” Malfoy confirms curiously. Ron hacks loudly through a mouthful of limp crisps.
played professionally for a bit, Potter, you know the importance of scoring as many goals as possible before the Snitch is caught.”
When he goes out into the bedroom, he finds Harry waiting for him, shirtless and sitting up against the headboard. There’s a bottle of wine and two glasses on his nightstand. The lights have been dimmed and the air smells pleasantly of sandalwood and roses, Draco’s favourite air-freshening charm.
“When?” Harry blushes slightly, but steps forward anyway, “I’d like to keep in frequent touch, Malfoy, I’d like to be around in case you—just to make sure you have everything you need and to— I mean, I don’t intend to get in your
Their mouths still locked together, Harry slid his hands down Draco’s sides, his skin still warm from the bath, Harry’s slightly rough hands making him break out in gooseflesh. Gripping Draco’s arse firmly for a brief second, Harry then proceeded to slide the robe over Draco’s shoulders and toss it aside carelessly before cupping Draco under the bum with both hands and just as carelessly flinging him onto the bed.
But Harry just shakes his head again, eyes falling shut as he sighs softly. When the tremors don’t stop even several minutes later, Draco draws the covers up higher, tucking it firmly below Harry’s bare body. “I’ll see you later, okay?” he whispers, not expecting a reply and not getting one.
Silent, Malfoy shifted, leaning his weight onto one leg so that his cloak shifted and Harry, once again, saw something gleaming under it.
Potter had worn a pale, mint green button down under his black leather jacket, buttons left undone up to his sternum. He wore an oxidised silver pendant shaped like a stag on a long black thread around his neck. Potter had smiled at Draco and had laughed at things he’d said. He’d bought Draco drinks. He’d played with Draco’s hair.
“You’re late,” he snaps at Harry, blushing faintly when Harry gapes at him for a few seconds without coming in.
“Has it only?” Draco chews thoughtfully. “Feels like longer.” He pauses, giving us both conspiratorial looks. “I really like him.”
“That’s not a fair deal,” Harry laughs, suddenly grabbing him by the arm and dragging him closer. “We both know she’s going to face-plant into that cake the moment she sees it.”
“He’s basically a speck from over here, you’re not going to be able to see much,” Harry deadpans. “And yes, I’m sure. Merlin, Gin.”
On Thursday evening, it was past seven-thirty when he finally Flooed home, exhausted, irritable and smelling strongly of the bone-repairing potion he’d been working on all day. When he got home Harry was in the kitchen, mashing potatoes for shepherd’s pie and the lamb and vegetables smelt so good that Draco nearly just settled himself at the table like an excited labrador to await a plateful of dinner. He
back out of anymore. Just,” Harry looks around the small, sad little flat again rather forlornly, “please, Malfoy.”
“Please tell me you at least got off with somebody last night?” he asks hopefully as we tuck into our breakfast some minutes later.
“Draco,” Harry groaned, and it was with no small amount of satisfaction that Draco let himself be snogged breathless for the next several minutes, winding long arms around his neck and keeping him in place this time, kissing him back hungrily and guiding Harry’s hands down to his arse once more.
I think about it the next morning as he walks into his kitchen wearing a wicked grin and my stupid new shirt buttoned up all wrong (just to rub in the fact that I’d been idiotic enough to go shop for a new shirt so I could successfully have sex with him), and hops up to sit on the counter and watch me make tea and toast. I think about it vividly in the following minutes as I kiss him, bending him backwards, lifting his knees to his ears and fucking him while he’s still wearing my shirt.
“You’re like an animal,” Draco said, talking over the devastated little cry that he’d nearly let out. “Only animals eat arse with this sort of unapologetic enthusiasm.”
Malfoy keeps his gaze on his own hands, his fingers long, skeletally thin and white, nails bitten down to the quick, lunulae standing out starkly in the pink beds. His right knee bounces furiously below the table, a single, hot gust of air blowing out his flared nostrils from time to time. He has his scraggly blond hair pulled back in a tiny ponytail at the nape of his neck, several bunches of the dry, straw-like strands escaping the elastic and framing his thin face, the ends of it just falling past his jaw. His lips are chapped and bright pink, his nose almost unnaturally straight, and his dark blond, fan like lashes flutter as he finally returns Harry’s gaze, just for a beat.
Ron straightens up from his seat and places the bowl on the coffee table. “Right, ‘cause that’s not weird at all, coming from you.”
“Damn it,” Draco breathes, pushing his hands into Harry’s knotted mane, finding more oatmeal there, “I knew I should’ve refused.”
you now, Potter?” Malfoy asks softly, in that same even, slightly hoarse, voice that he’d ordered breakfast and tea with. “Sniffed me out to be your next charity case, then?
“Somehow, I feel like nobody really expects us to be on time,” Harry grunts, grabbing Lily as she immediately tries to wriggle out of his arms with a giggle. “We haven’t slept in six years; I think we’ve earned the right to be tardy once in a while.” He wrestles Lily’s other sock and both shoes on as Draco deftly slides her delicate, floaty white and pink robes over her head.
“I told Ron and Hermione,” Potter says with a sheepish smile. “I just—‘Mione wouldn’t stop going on and on about how I look happy or some rubbish and I think, um...” he tugs awkwardly at his ear, “I think you’d...left...like a mark on my neck?” He grins as Draco’s eyes widen in horror. “She didn’t even need a second guess, really. She knew it was you right away.”
“How about we just throw him out the window instead?!” Draco spat, turning around and slapping Harry’s hand off his arse.
him, all right?! I’m—weren’t you listening when Hermione and I described in what condition he was found last time?!”
“Why didn’t I accept his proposal or—” Malfoy sits up too, nervous and fidgety, “—why did I lie about it?”
His legs feel weak and overused, quivering under him, and his hips are creaky and sore. His back aches, spine clicking dully every time he stretches it out, and the long tracks that have been scratched down the length of his back burn under the extreme heat.
“Won’t the effectiveness of the potion be compromised if you throw out the natural juices of the aconite?”
“Could’ve f-fooled me,” Malfoy huffed out, his voice breaking when Harry pressed forward a little more before abruptly pulling out so he could get more lube. “The
I watch the way one pale eyebrow hitches its way up his forehead under his blond fringe as he notes the ciggy hanging between my fingers – he’s never approved. I’d given it up
“You asked me to...get the fuck out of your face, as I recall,” Harry swallows hard, “Several times.”
“Isn’t Draco supposed to be here by now?” I vaguely wonder out loud, flipping through the file Ron has open before him, half a dozen sheets spilling out of it messily.
“Oh, do shut it, Malfoy,” Harry snaps, going right back to his arse. Peeling him open again, he buries his face in vigorously, glasses getting shoved up his brow, tongue immediately forcing its way through Draco’s rim.
“Oh, please,” Potter had scoffed, turning to him, “Like you’d have accepted them without a barbed comment or two.”
Despite being far from comfortable in the way they were sat tangled together on the cold, hard flagstones, but neither seemed to care as they kissed in frenzied desperation. Hands grabbed at hair and clothes as they clung onto each other in a sudden, embarrassing burst of emotion that neither wanted to formally acknowledge.
“Do finish your sentences, Granger,” Draco says mildly, pulling out the stopper to a large pot of dittany and using a long, glass dropper to measure out exactly 7ml of dittany, peering at the markings on the tube through his glasses.
Panting and sweating lightly, Draco turned when he heard footsteps approaching, waving his stolen bathrobe around just as Harry appeared, his expression oddly inscrutable, his erection long, thick and deep red, his Ministry issued badge (that now said SR. AUROR instead of TRAINEE) bouncing against his chest.
me a second?” Harry hisses, finally releasing the punishing grip around his cock and lining up once more.
Draco lets his gaze sweep past the small, wrinkled elf and down into the long hallway behind it, his lip automatically curling as he takes in the dingy, almost completely unlit interiors. There are no signs of natural light entering the house anywhere and even where he stands, Draco can smell the musty stench of mildew that seems to linger about.
“Do you want it to happen again?” Harry interrupted. This time Malfoy just swallowed thickly, fidgeting slightly and licking his lips, leaving them wet and Harry hard. He leaned forward and traced a little shapeless design over the back of Malfoy’s wrist – Malfoy didn’t pull away.
To Draco’s smug satisfaction, Potter, despite the fact that they’d been standing pressed as close as possible with a pregnant belly between them, had not expected the kiss. He lets out a little gasp into Draco’s mouth that prompts Draco to only deepen the kiss at once, slanting his face and slotting their mouths together, lunging forward into the kiss as their teeth clack and lips smack.
skinny Curse Breaker arms can support a lot more than dumbbells, as my late night visitor from yesterday can confirm—”
His expression resembles what I assume mine is like. He’s pink cheeked from the cold, a woollen cap pulled over his head, fashionably lopsided so that his fringe falls
Harry mixed hot water into the porridge mix and ladled out bowlfuls for the children. The sun rose and coloured everything peach as the children sat together, spooning up sweetened porridge and chattering inanely. Harry sipped his tea and dunked a couple of biscuits in between feeding Lily her breakfast.
“Malfoy, I know you said that larger groups attract dementors quicker.” Harry waited until Malfoy looked up. “But I—I think maybe we should stick together. Just for a bit.”
“Androm—” Potter breaks off, glancing at Draco with a small smile. “Your aunt Andromeda,” he says pointedly, “sent me these earlier today.” He hands Draco one of the photos; the little boy is sitting up in his crib, staring up at the camera with huge, deep blue eyes, gnawing at one tiny fist. As Draco watches, his hair goes from turquoise to jet black. “He does that when someone says my name,” Potter chuckles. “She must’ve said my name out loud to him while she took the picture. That’s Teddy,” he suddenly adds. “My godson.”
“Ten what,” Draco asks vaguely as he walks back, before his head snaps up, eyes wide as he throws me a look that screams, ‘shit!’ “Ten
Harry, his breathing loud and ragged, goes somewhat still, chest heaving and limbs twitching, but eyes shut and expression one of tentative surrender. Draco smiles again and, as a reward, moves over and takes Harry into his mouth.
The dementors formed a wide circle around them. Behind him, his sons were whimpering. One dementor broke free of the others and glided to a spot a few feet away from Harry. One scabbed, grey hand emerged from the depths of its black cloak and reached out, seemingly closing around nothing, and pulled.
“I believe I interrupted some complaining?” Harry said against Draco’s lips when he’d pulled away. He sounded slightly smug.
“Hermione and he are moving in together,” Harry informs him. “They just finalised a flat last Saturday.”
Draco sighs, rolling his eyes. “Yes. I placed my order in October and was apparently one of the last ones to.” He walks over to me, frowning. “Make him leave,” he says loudly, pointing to Ron.
“You’d go back to a less than mediocre brew of standard Wolfsbane and find another fervent fan to snog,” Draco tells him.
“Remus Lupin’s son,” Draco mutters awkwardly, handing the photo back. “Lupin’s wife was a Metamorphmagus, wasn’t she?”
The moon is already high when Draco lets himself into Grimmauld Place. Pausing at the foot of the stairs, he calls quietly for Kreacher.
“You just left last week,” Potter reminds him like a great, big oaf. Like Draco doesn’t remember the weight of disappointment in the pit of his stomach as he’d stolen one last glance at Potter and walked out.
“Please, just let go,” he says, sounding pained, and roughly jerks his arm away before rounding the sofa to the hearth and disappearing in a whirl of green flames.
“Yes,” Draco says softly. “The standard Wolfsbane lets you keep your mental faculties intact during your transformation, but it doesn’t suppress the more powerful animal instincts the wolf forces to the surface. Those instincts are always there, Potter, they’re in you even now. But because you’re not being forced into wolf-form by the moon cycle, you’re able to easily retain your human sensibilities.”
“It’s ... me,” Draco said, slowly getting to his feet and pressing into him, his own face heating now. “It’s ... Draco.”
I pour us both some champagne, splashing large quantities of it onto the coffee table. When I hand him his glass, my hand is shaking so much that I accidentally spill some on his jeans.
“Whatever, Potter,” Malfoy sighs, bending down and picking up the trunk by one ear, “You’d better have more than one bedroom.”
With a final heave, Draco managed to pull the robes out of Moody’s ridiculously strong grip. There was a sharp ripping sound as the ferret’s teeth tore through the delicate silk.
Draco doesn’t know which part of that sentence to take offence to first. “Are you here solely to tell me that Potter fancies me?”
This time the silence stretches on a lot longer than before until Harry gives into the nagging urge to lean over and press a kiss to Malfoy’s peachy cheek. “Thanks,” he says. “You’re alright, you know, Malfoy?”
“Shit, Malfoy, I’m glad you called back. Listen, I’m really sorry about earlier, I didn’t mean to embarrass you or anything, alright?”
Malfoy nods and draws Harry closer. “Mungo’s?” he says quietly and Harry, his head swimming, just nods back.
Ron’s eyes widen in genuine shock. For a moment I almost believe he’s going to lecture me on treating Draco this way or something.
Draco doesn’t register the low rumble of voices as the rest of them start to gather their things, steadily filtering out of the room. Potter is very still beneath him, his hands, palms up, still flat above his head, his eyes intent and curious as he stares up at Draco, seemingly completely unbothered by the fact that he’s got his own wand trained at him.
Harry is pushing the Harpies through a third set of cross-crunches when he notices the lone figure sitting in the deserted stands on the far end of the stadium, the glint of platinum-blond hair unmistakable. Despite the tension that’s been building all day in the pit of his stomach, Harry grins broadly.
how wet he was every time his arsehole clenched involuntarily. “Harry,” he said again, pushing his arse back, pressing into the tongue that was now spearing into him with no sort of finesse whatsoever.
He’s aware of the last remaining dregs of his control leaving him; he’s aware of the fiery rage coursing through his bloodstream and setting every nerve ending aflame, making everything around him blindingly vivid; he’s aware of Malfoy’s garbled babbling as he wrestles him onto the bed, Malfoy plucking one of the gauzy bed-hangings down in his momentary struggle. Harry flips him onto his hands and knees and hikes his robes up, throwing the hem over his back and ripping his boxers down, tearing it off one leg and leaving them tangled around his ankle. It’s not until he smells Malfoy’s arousal, thick and unmistakable, that he realises Malfoy is
“We could...drain the phallus,” one of the junior Healers said awkwardly, scratching the back of his neck, his gaze carefully trained away from Harry’s erection.
Flailing wildly, Draco sat up, pointing blindly towards the bedroom door. Completely startled, Harry toppled over backwards and fell off the bed, disappearing from view.
“She will be any second now.” Ron lifts his feet to make room for me as I sink onto the sofa and Summon a beer. The fridge flies open too quickly and there’s a blunt, cracking sound as two eggs land on the floor.
Running his fingers through the fine hairs on Potter’s thighs, Draco claws his hands around handfuls of Potter’s firm, taut arse, his fingernails digging in deep as he squeezes. Potter hisses, squirming slightly, but doesn’t pull away, and doesn’t ask Draco to stop.
Potter doesn’t open it and pull out a vial to inspect or sample; he just stands there and stares at Draco, long, jet black curls loose around his head. Draco is still chewing on his lip, and instead of staring brazenly the way Potter is, he steals quick glances at him every few seconds, at his firm pectorals, partially hidden under the towel, at the scratches he can see now, slashing across his chest, a couple of shades lighter than Potter’s skin, at the taut, defined flatness of his belly, at the dark trail of fine hair leading down from his perfectly round navel...
you in months. I haven’t tasted you properly in ages.” He pulls back and meets Draco’s eyes squarely. “I’d like to look at you while I fuck you, if it’s all the same, thank you.”
,” he half shouts as Harry opens his mouth angrily to interrupt, “then to simply hook up.” He shrugs casually as Harry stares. “Sex has
need to avoid stressing too, because Malfoy here is relying on you in several little ways beyond just his supply of chocolate.” She stands, smiling and pointing wordlessly to the examination table with a little nod at Draco.
“Please--” Something in Malfoy’s voice made Harry look up – Malfoy already looked a little wrecked. His hair was a mess and stuck up all over his place, his cheeks were stained deep pink and his forehead and upper lip glistened with sweat. “It—it won’t be that bad; just push in.” When Harry hesitated for a few more seconds, “
?” he roars suddenly, releasing Malfoy’s cock and pressing his palm against his warm, swollen belly just as there’s a wild jerk from within.
“P--” Malfoy started to say (probably, his name), but Harry pressed back in, Malfoy growling in frustration as he was cut off. When they next broke for air, Malfoy didn’t gasp out his name but, “
Ron is lounging on the sofa in nothing but a pair of nauseatingly bright yellow pyjama bottoms when I step out of the Floo. He’s got a bowl of crisps balanced on his stomach and is flicking through channels on the television so quickly that the picture is just a blur.
Despite the despondence in Harry’s eyes, his expression is mild and serene as he gives Draco a small smile, sitting on the edge of the bed, Draco standing between his knees and vigorously towelling his hair dry, rubbing the stark black strands with soft terry until they fall in soft clumps around his face. Swiping the same towel through his own hair a few times, Draco tosses it into the hamper before cupping Harry’s upturned face and gently kissing his forehead.
“You’d know,” Harry says, pointedly lifting his hips so Draco can feel the ever-growing bulge in his pants.
“I- I really need to come.” Malfoy sounded almost ashamed. But the next second he moved his hands off his face and glared at Harry. “Do you plan on fucking me sometime tonight?”
Harry could feel the warm jets of his come land on him before Malfoy unwittingly smeared it into both their bellies as he continued to move frenetically, guttural sounds of exhaustion muffled into Harry’s shoulder.
“Hullo.” He sounds decidedly breathless. Then, smiling: “Sorry. I didn’t mean to almost kill you with the door.”
, the base feeling heavy and too tight. He cries out in pain and alarm when he tries to stop but finds he can’t, his hips seemingly moving quite out of his control even though he’s now simply grinding his prick into Malfoy’s contracting channel without pulling out.
Lucius staggers back and collapses onto the sofa once again, looking slightly green in the face. Narcissa has tears silently coursing down her face, her eyes shining with what Harry thinks may be happiness as she stares at Malfoy’s stomach. Malfoy himself is just sitting there with his head resting on the back of the sofa, looking tired and irritable more than anything and when Harry sits back down, Malfoy promptly slants him a dark scowl.
Smiling back in relief, anxiety slowly dissipating, Draco walks in and halts a few steps into the room; Weasley and Granger have already arrived and are staring rather avidly at Draco. They aren’t even dressed like one would expect them to for a birthday gathering – Weasley is wearing jeans and a horrible, vividly orange Chudley Canons t-shirt that clashes nauseatingly with his hair, and Granger has what appears to be an old, flannel shirt that probably belongs to Weasley for it’s far too loose on her over black leggings that have faded from too many washes, with her hair up in a messy, half-arsed bun. Potter himself in dressed in jeans and the same white t-shirt he’d hurriedly pulled on the previous evening to go buy Draco a tub of Fortescue’s salted caramel swirl; he’s pretty sure there’s still a smear of ice cream inside one of the sleeves from where Draco had twisted his fingers and tried to drag the t-shirt off afterwards.
,” Weasley declares bluntly, and Draco instantly feels his cheeks heat at those words, to hear them be said out loud like that. Merlin, even Harry and he hadn’t said it out loud to each other yet. “
Turning over restlessly and pulling the duvet up to his chin, Draco buries his face into his pillow, shivering lightly as he recalls the way Potter’s hair had come loose in places and fallen into his eyes, catching in his beard (that
But Harry, jaw set stubbornly, just looks away, leaning back in his seat and crossing his arms. Draco gets up, throws his napkin onto his hardly touched plate and storms out, taking the stairs two at a time as he makes his way back up into that dank, smelly corridor, turning towards the front door only to belatedly remember that he’s left his briefcase and cloak up in the living room.
“How shallow do you think I am?” Harry retorts, unamused. “You’re still fucking sexy as fuck, you idiot; you think I haven’t been dying to fuck you all these weeks?”
“Why haven’t we been blessed with the company of my noble son-in-law?” Lucius asks suddenly, setting his cutlery down and reaching for his port.
Their bodies gleaming with perspiration, they lie there slumped on their sides, catching their breath with noisy wheezes. Releasing Malfoy’s thigh and gently pulling out, Harry brings his hand back up to cradle his belly, running his fingers along the underside as he grazes his teeth lightly across Malfoy’s shoulder. Other than sighing softly now and then, Malfoy is completely silent, and from the way he drowsily burrows his face into his pillow, already on the brink of sleep.
“You look well, son,” Lucius finally drawls. “Would you care to explain why I have this specimen in my parlour?” he enquires, jerking his chin towards Harry without looking at him.
The rain never lets up outside, roaring in its intensity, and despite the chill it’s brought with it, they’re both soaked with sweat, Malfoy’s clammy hands slipping fruitlessly on the slats of the headboard, his hair clinging in damp bunches to his gleaming back, low, broken sounds of pleasure escaping him through bitten, reddened lips.
For all the cold derision Malfoy oozes, Harry notices the way his thin fingers clutch at the cloak he’s got draped over his arm. His eyes immediately find Harry’s as he steps in and Harry feels the knots in his belly tighten painfully as their gazes lock and hold for several seconds.
“Honestly, Ron, you’re an embarrassment to yourself,” Granger remarks, rolling her eyes as she bustles over and taps her husband on the arm. “We’re leaving, come on.”
Swallowing hard once more, Harry looks away, mind whirring, unable to blink away the expression on Malfoy’s face just before he’d walked off – the look of someone who’d dared to hope after ages of deliberation, only to have their hopes immediately crushed.
and Potter cups his free hand over his mouth. Clawing at it, Draco can feel the panic rising in his chest just as fast as his cock is rising in his pants.
,” Granger said tetchily, but Draco could see the way her knuckles had turned white from gripping the railing in front of them, anxiety pouring off her in waves.
Because Draco is not about to let himself hope, to daydream about the possibilities – to open himself up to heartbreak.
himself to go on that lunch date and flirt aggressively until he was invited back to his date’s house where he got right down to business.
“Stop apologising,” Malfoy says irritably, and then squirms awkwardly. “I mean... Whatever. We’ll read up about it, I suppose.”
Potter tugs, sending Draco sprawling onto him before tugging some more, clutching him by the roots of his hair and taking his mouth roughly, Draco whining as Potter deliberately sucks on his tongue, growling into his mouth and biting at his lips. He grabs Draco’s hips with both hands, turns his face away from the kiss, and tugs once again, pulling Draco up his chest, his t-shirt rucking up and bunching under Draco’s bum.

mean it when Potter is panting moist puffs of air into his face, and grinding what is now a full blown erection against Draco’s own, glaring at Draco with the same mixture of confused-exasperated-helpless-raging
asking him a dozen questions. When he looks from Potter’s hand on his arm up to his face, he notes the same enquiring glint in his eyes –
Ron snorted. “Anyone who looks at you both together can tell you’re both always on the same page.” I don’t say anything. Ron says gently, “I’ve seen the way he looks at you. How he’s
“You’re into balls, then?” Harry murmurs, releasing Malfoy’s prick to reach further below and locate his wildly swinging balls and tug, thrusting steadily into the wet heat of Malfoy’s arse, hips pumping so hard that they bounce right off the fleshy softness of his bum. “D’you enjoy having a pair in your mouth, Malfoy?”
“Do you plan on incorporating this shameful Muggle tradition with this one?” Malfoy asks, briefly closing his hand around Harry’s on his stomach and narrowing his eyes.
He pulls off again when he starts to get dizzy, licking up along the bulging veins and pulling the foreskin down hard towards the base, fluttering little sucking kisses over the shaft when Potter whimpers and writhes. Holding his cock by the base with one hand, Draco reaches for and gently tugs at Potter’s balls, lifting the heavy sac on one palm and rolling it around, closing his fingers around it on a teasing squeeze every now and then.
“Does it?” he drawls, the lone butterfly in his stomach multiplying into several more. “Do you mentally document how everybody smells, Potter?”
Harry’s silent laugh vibrates against his skin, his arm tightening around Draco’s waist as he nuzzles into his neck. “I love you, Draco Malfoy,” he says softly, honest and indulgent.
Potter’s body quakes, a rough sound leaving him as he shuts his eyes and drops his face back into Draco’s neck. “Fuck,” he mutters, stopping his mindless grinding with what seems to be a huge effort.
Harry shrugged with a smile, now shooting consecutive drying spells at the shirt. “I caught the Snitch.”
“I’ll need to scan your signature and require a sample of your blood now, Malfoy,” Hermione ends the projection, causing both men to blink around in the sudden brightness as the lights come back on, “You can sit up and fasten your robes now, if you like.”
, opened to page six, was plastered onto the table, completely soaked in juice. A steady trickle of juice dripped onto Draco’s chair; Harry’s chair, however, was clean.
“Yeah?” Harry confirms softly, bringing slick fingers to Malfoy’s arsehole, petting the velvety divot. When Malfoy nods eagerly, Harry slips one finger in right down to the last knuckle, grinding the knob of it against Malfoy’s rim as he feels around inside. He hums quietly when he finds the sensitive little nub, Malfoy’s whole body lurching, massaging it with the tip of his finger, watching the way Malfoy gasps into his pillow, one arm curled around the thigh Harry has in the air, his other hand clenched in the sheets. As Harry slips a second finger in, Malfoy moans and squeezes his eyes shut, clamping tightly around his fingers. “Fuck, Malfoy, look at you,” Harry murmurs feverishly, scissoring his fingers with every inward plunge.
As Scorpius protests weakly about being allowed to stay up late on his birthday, Draco looks around, doing a double take when he sees his mother standing with Harry and murmuring softly to him, Harry’s face very red as he glances at Draco over her head before looking down and nodding wordlessly.
“You look better,” Draco says quietly, because Potter does, he really does. Draco doesn’t know whether it’s the missing beard or the fact that Potter isn’t scowling at him, but he looks heaps better than he did a few days ago. He’s not hunched over, as though in constant pain, and his skin seems to have a healthy flush to it. The dark circles beneath his eyes are less pronounced, and his eyes themselves are brighter, less tortured looking, and so,
“God, how long is this going to take?” Harry groans, still shaking with mirth. “I need a cold shower before I lose control again.”
“Right, that’s it. I’m leaving.” Harry drains his drink, throws twelve galleons on the bar and gets up, swaying just a little bit.
“I’m incredibly flattered that you made sure to stay up-to-date from Spain, Lucius,” Harry drawls with bored sigh.
“You really thought hiding the ring box in that little idiot’s nest was a good idea?” Draco asked, picking up his wand and turning to raise an eyebrow at Harry, although he couldn’t help the accompanying grin.
Harry fought down the natural urge to snap at Malfoy that sprung up in him. “Yeah, sorry. I want to put together something soft that she can rest on. And get some chocolate in her.”
He leans back over Draco, smiling at the sight of his marooned cheeks and pouting mouth. “One look at you is all it takes to see how unattainable you are, Draco Malfoy,” he whispers, thumb swiping over Draco’s mouth. “And I definitely never saw myself securing someone as...” He doesn’t finish the sentence, just leaning his forehead against Draco’s with a broad smile. “No. You’re definitely not the sort that has flings.”
Malfoy had swung his cloak back on and was, from the look of it, checking the wards around them, his back turned to the others.
So Harry sighs irritably - loudly. “Malfoy, what am I doing here?” he demands, dipping his head and trying to catch his gaze. “You did owl and ask to meet me, yes?”
, Draco. He’s incredibly tactile and never thinks much of casual touching between friends and well, this is his
“Come on, we both know it’ll be good,” Erickson wheedles lewdly. “I’ve heard you Veela practically cream yourselves at the thought of a nice werewolf cock in—”
His heart thundering in his ears, he ignored the roar from the Ravenclaw supporters as they scored another ten points. In retaliation, one of the Gyffindor Beaters sent a Bludger hurtling in the direction of the Chaser who’d just scored, who was then saved from a broken face by an astonishingly quick Ravenclaw Beater. The teams were almost neck and neck, Gryffindor at a hundred and thirty, Ravenclaw leading by ten points at a hundred and forty.
Draco’s gaze never leaves Harry’s hunched figure even as he splashes a rather obscenely large amount of whiskey into a tumbler and walks over, pressing it into Harry’s limp hand, trying and failing yet again to catch his eye. When Harry knocks back the whiskey like it were merely pumpkin juice, Draco simply takes the glass from him and brings back another large helping of the smooth amber.
But Draco doesn’t answer her; he doesn’t admit that he’s scared to lose something that he doesn’t even have yet.
He’s pretty sure he can feel his wings starting to prickle out of his shoulder blades, his nails turning heavy and dense, when he hears a sound behind him; he whirls around, his own hair whipping him across the face as he does.
Heart thudding, I pull off the patchwork quilt he’d had custom made for me for Christmas three years ago – it has photos embroidered in gold thread all over it, charmed to look lifelike; photos of my parents, of Ron, Hermione and me, of the Weasleys and me, of Draco and me. I take my time stretching and slowly walking up to the door. He doesn’t stop pounding at the door the entire time, at one point even, by the sound of it, kicking at it.
That cool, evaluating gaze slides down to his, Malfoy not moving otherwise as he stares down his nose at Harry. “Go on, then,” he finally drawls. “What’s this one for?”
“Are you any better? Don’t need another dose of pain potions, then? Can you flex your fingers for me? That’s it... Good. I’ll be right there in my quarters if you need me. Goodnight.”
They’re lying on their sides, facing each other, and Harry’s staring at him. His eyes are barely just cracked open, but Draco can tell he’s awake and aware of his presence. He looks very much like he’d looked the previous month after the full moon – every inch of him seems to sag with exhaustion. The dark pockets beneath his eyes are back, his skin tinged grey again. His hair lies in a matted mess on his pillow and Draco can feel, just barely perceptibly, the faint tremors wracking his body.
They make it all the way to the bedroom, mouths fused together, Potter’s boots kicked off, Draco’s satin pyjama top torn into two and drifting around somewhere in the hallway, and as Draco drags Potter’s jacket off, the black leather fragrant and expensive under his fingers, and shoves him back onto his bed, Potter goes and opens his mouth.
I’m grinning myself as I finally take pity and get up to prise him off Ron, but somewhere inside me there is a fervent prayer being sent up: to whomsoever it may concern – kindly ensure that Draco’s heart
“I’d been planning on breaking up with him even before you found out and told me anyway,” I say airily and grin as his glare promptly intensifies.
The little boy’s face fell and he shifted his gaze off the food Harry held. “I... No, thank you, Mr. Potter. Father, made me hot cocoa,” he said, holding out the plastic mug with a pattern of round glasses and a lightning bolt on it.
“I’m Draco,” he says, smiling and shifting so that he’s stood right in front of the man, his grey track pants suddenly hanging an inch or two lower than they were a second ago, his dark blue sleeveless gym vest riding up to reveal a broad strip of pale white hips and flat belly.
Draco turned to see Moody hopping on the spot while looking up at the fridge that had, thankfully, not crashed back to the ground as Draco had been busy getting engaged to the guy he’d loved since he was fourteen.
Harry slowly pushed the elastic of his boxers down. “Yeah.” His voice was rather hoarse. “Yeah, I sort of do...”
It was only after she’d wandered away asking him to hurry up and move his fat bum – the fucking bitch, Draco’s arse was his
Across the clearing, Scorpius was still asleep too. Malfoy, by the look of it, hadn’t moved at all. He still sat against the tree, his sword in his lap.
“I’m hungry,” Draco says suddenly. “Curry?” he addresses all of us in general, looking to his left to Seamus, Dean and Ron before glancing at me on his right. “Ditch that disgusting rag and come with us,” he adds to Zabini over his shoulder.
“Hmm. Malfoy is particularly good at that sort of thing. I think he’s mentioned how he used to watch the elves at the Manor decorate the place. And well, he does have excellent taste. He always does a fantastic job of doing up your place.”
Harry shook out the shirt, crushed the material in his hands over a few spots to check if he’d dried it out evenly, and then threw the shirt into Malfoy’s lap when satisfied.
“So demanding,” Harry sniggers, lubing up and thumbing his cock into place, the tip of it tickling Draco’s rim. “You’ve barely touched me all these months, baby, I’m entitled to a bit of teasing.”
Draco stares, mind curiously blank as he processes that. He still remembers Potter from the first time they’d met, skinny as a fucking twig and garbed in atrocious, oversized clothes, blinking at Draco from his stool at Madam Malkin’s, seeming as nervous as Draco secretly felt but wasn’t allowed to show.
Potter’s eyes twinkle and he tilts his head slightly, regarding Draco carefully for a few seconds. “I didn’t help you as a favour, Malfoy,” he says slowly.
Then he hears it, a low, pained whine, and then very clear and loud, the sound of the door being scratched at from the inside.
Potter doesn’t dawdle now though — two and three fingers in quick succession, scissoring them inside Draco until he’s a shaking, drooling mess, and then Potter is swiftly slicking his cock up, sitting back on his heels and lifting Draco’s arse and placing it on his thighs. There’s a cool, slippery press against his arsehole as he lines the tip up, and then Potter leans over him once more, one hand braced next to Draco’s shoulder, his breathing ragged and hot in Draco’s ear.
comfortable pillow that Potter had bought him and sits up, wincing at the twinges of pain shooting up from his tailbone, and wearily cupping his cock through his rumpled pyjamas.
!” he yells again, when their cocks slide against each other, the heads catching for a swift second.
“You remember that big bloke with the blue Mohawk?” He grins as I immediately school my expression into the one of impassive disinterest I’ve mastered for when he starts ranting about his latest fuckboy.
mouth, Malfoy,” Potter says quietly, one hand coming to rest on the back of Draco’s head, fingers winding through the fine blond hair. One thick fingered hand wraps around that cock and then Draco’s head is tilting back as he’s fed the entirety of it in one long, slick shove.
that for one insane moment, I want to go looking for him so I can vomit the truth out at him, leaving him to deal with this mess – because I am seriously beginning to doubt whether
Draco is immediately sitting up. “Oh, I’m definitely in. Honestly, I need to move my arse before I grow roots here and Mrs. W brings out more food.”
The gift turns out to be a tall, well polished crib, creamy white and with an enormous, red bow tied to the front panel. There are exquisite, elaborate carvings across both panels as well as around the base, and the rungs are smooth and rounded. The white mattress inside is shimmering lightly under layers of Protective Charms and looks wonderfully soft, and there’s a little pile of fluffy blankets in a neat stack to one side.
Harry’s jaw works as he stares back, mind wandering back to that night at the club, the way Malfoy had begged, the way Harry had knotted a hand in his fine, sleek hair and tugged, growling utter filth into his ear through his own broken panting.
“Don’t you ever worry that the place will flood?” he blurts out, starting as an enormous something whizzes past one window.
Draco simply stares back at him as the upbeat, cheery tune smoothly slides into a slow waltz, the music almost too sweet to bear.
“Potter,” Draco moans before sucking Potter’s thumb into his mouth, slurping loudly around it as Potter fondles his throbbing cock, slipping the foreskin all the way down before squeezing under the head. Draco scrabbles wildly, rutting into his fist and letting his eyes fall shut, still sucking on Potter’s thumb until he growls and yanks Draco into another kiss, wild and fervent.
He was also not a believer in the artful concealment of one’s true feelings and intentions. The way he spoke to, looked at, touched and kissed Draco left absolutely no doubt in his mind about how Harry felt about him – and frankly speaking, that as well as the realisation that he himself likely felt the same way about Harry in return terrified Draco like few other things did.
“I’ll spell his cage shut so he doesn’t get out tonight,” he promised, running wet lips lovingly over Draco’s face. Just barely mollified, Draco sighed through his nose with a scowl, bleary-eyed as he traced his forefinger over one of the tattoos on Harry’s chest.
Draco cuts him off with the most violent kiss he can muster, kissing him so aggressively that suddenly he’s tasting the coppery tang of blood.
“Well, go on then,” Draco waves his hand at the Floo with forced nonchalance. “Floo him back in or go over to his or whatever,” Draco can feel the rage bubbling up his chest and feels almost ill with it, “Go fuck him, Potter. Fuck him all damn night. Hell, knock
When I Floo into Simon’s place I find he’s not home. I’m irritated at this; he was supposed to be here so I could break up with him. Well, technically, he’s supposed to be here because we were to head to Parkinson’s party together but I’d had other plans and his absence is a fucking inconvenience.
But then Moody’s little head appeared from behind the fridge and he wiggled his nose at Draco, looking very pensive. Before Draco could even think up another insult to hurl at him, the ferret had scuttled out and over to where Draco stood.
“Nice arse, Weasel.” Draco comes up to me and pokes a finger into one of the potatoes, hissing and pulling it back with a scowl. “That’s fucking
Draco, one foot on the first step, looks around in stunned silence, his cheeks heating at the words of a
In all the years that he’d known and hated Potter before the War, it was this quality of his that Draco had resented and despised the most – the fact that Potter really
I can’t help it; I cup his cheek and kiss him again, pushing him back down as I do. He goes willingly, although his hands are busy undoing my belt buckle, my flies, pushing my trousers down, first with his hands and then with the soles of his feet, until they’re pooled around my ankles. Through it all, I kiss him and kiss him, rubbing my cock against his through my boxers.
Nodding, Potter takes a small sip of the water his elf comes up and pours him. “That’s how it used to be done,” he says, clearing his throat and dabbing at his streaming eyes. “That’s how
wider, wide enough that Draco winces and moans, and firmly sticks his tongue back in, thrusting it in and out, his whole body lunging back and forth with it, frequently knocking into the backs of Draco’s already buckling knees.
The fire is robust enough that they’re both covered in a fine layer of perspiration by the time Harry has worked off Draco’s trousers and pants, his own jumper and t-shirt lying strewn a few feet away, his jeans and pants halfway down his thighs. Draco’s legs are long and smooth where they wrap around Harry’s hips, and his arsehole soft and twitching when he works in two, then three, oiled fingers.
.” Malfoy glared, his bound hands resting awkwardly in his lap as he mentally stabbed Harry in the neck. “What the fuck, Potter? Is this some new form of bullying?”
Slowly, he wandered into the field, wandtip lit and held a few feet above the ground. He peered in the semidarkness, wondering if a Summoning charm would work.
“It makes me anxious to be away from you for too long,” Potter says abruptly, voice slightly gruff. Heart flipping over excitedly, Draco just stares at him in silence. “Even more so lately,” Potter adds softly, eyes sliding down to the swell of Draco’s bump, a sliver of skin visible where the buttons on his pyjama top strain slightly.
Draco feels his lip curl derisively. “What do you take him for? He’d be the last person to hurt me like that.”
It’s the first time he’s said it; said it in those plain words. I know instantly that I’ll never forget this moment, the sound of his voice as he’d said those words, the warmth of his plaint body in my arms, the almost bashful look on his face – I’ll remember it all forever and think about it every day.
Their lips touch, part, and then touch again before slotting together, soft but firm, moving in sync on a deep, slick kiss. Draco angles Potter’s head the way he wants and Potter lets him, his hand never leaving Draco’s stomach, his other hand now curling gently around Draco’s neck, thumb feathering up his jaw.
Infuriated, he tightens his hand further in Potter’s hair, braces his other hand on the wall again, and shoves his cock in. Potter splutters, his hands flying up to grab Draco’s hips and Draco responds by thrusting harder, firmly holding Potter in place by the hair and fucking in deeper.
turns up for an interview, Harry confirms his ‘relationship’ with Malfoy. When Malfoy reads the article the next day, he raises a questioning eyebrow at Harry across the Great Hall.
Harry reaches over and backhands the glass out of Malfoy’s hand, sending it flying over the bar. Malfoy blinks at him in shock as the tinkle of breaking glass sounds, the barest suggestion of a smile on the corners of his pink mouth. “Drink, Malfoy?”
beard) before being brushed away impatiently. He thinks of how Potter had handled his cutlery with surprising grace, long fingers curling around the bowl of his goblet as he stared fixedly at Draco over it. He thinks of the way Potter’s eyes had crinkled up with genuine amusement at something Draco had said, his toothy smile bright white in contrast to his smooth skin, the colour of caramel.
He doesn’t quite recall much after Malfoy had righted his clothes, thrown Harry an indecipherable, wide-eyed look and slipped out of the stall. He’d woken up in Ron and Hermione’s guest room the next morning, sheepish and mortified, but with every last detail of his spectacular fuck with Malfoy still somehow crystal clear in his painfully thudding head, and had figured...eh, well, shit happens.
“Really?” Potter looks genuinely pleased. “Whatever I want? Even this?” Draco hadn’t noticed the thick arm encircle his waist and so when Potter jerks them flush together, Draco’s gasp is partly of shock.
Harry fucked him slowly with just the one finger until Malfoy’s breathing was ragged and his arse clenched around his finger every time he pulled out. When his finger finally slid in and out without resistance, Harry paused for more lube and added another.
It’s stupefying and utterly terrifying a realisation and Draco doesn’t quite understand why his heart seems to be swelling rapidly and gleefully.
And so the three of us are eating Chinese takeout seated around their table. Hermione is telling us about one of her current patients, a precocious nine-year-old who, judging by Hermione’s description, sounds a lot like a mini-Hermione. Ron and I exchange a grin across the table before he raises his eyebrows meaningfully, jerking his head towards Hermione and then glaring at me.
you were, Potter.” Zabini suddenly appears and slams down the three mugs, beer and foam slopping out over the rim and fizzing onto the glossy bar. Zabini curses. “When the fuck do you plan to come join us?” Draco asks him irritably, gently tugging his wrist free from my hand and picking up two of the mugs gingerly, making a face at the sticky residue on the sides. “It’s on
Draco’s belly at this appointment after silently seeking permission with an entreating tilt of his head to which Draco had responded with a single nod. Potter’s large, slightly rough hand had rested warmly on Draco’s stomach, just to the side of his navel, and they’d, along with Granger, watched as the baby had responded to the touch nearly instantly with a surprisingly strong kick, prompting Potter to yelp and pull back his hand as though bitten, Draco trying to glare at him through their shared, exhilarated laughter as he’d rubbed the spot on his belly where he’d felt it.
“Yes, because you’re all about being straightforward,” Harry deadpans, eyes twinkling. When Draco glares, he scratches his brow with his thumb with a patient sigh. “You’re allowed to come keep me company when I’m not even human and I can’t keep you company at your work place?”
Harry sits up, expression warily impassive, but bordering on incredulous anger. “When I transform? Are you mad?”
Malfoy stirs weakly against him and that’s when he realises the feeble croaking is Malfoy calling out his name over and over.
hasn’t managed to stop trembling, whimpering out little sighs as Harry slowly drags him higher up the bed until they’re up against the pillows. He feels wrung out, boneless, as he lays there limply under Harry’s tiny, moist kisses, dragging one hand through his damp, black locks. He feels appallingly empty suddenly, his arsehole still gaping open and shut wetly, the ache so sweet that he can’t help but clench into that pain over and over.
“For approaching you that night,” Harry says finally, gaze sliding away. “For not leaving when you asked me to piss off. For...knocking you up...I guess.”
“It’s been torture, you bastard,” Harry says gruffly, biting him a whole collection of hickeys on the sides of his neck. “The amount of control it took not to just wrestle you down and put it to you—”
“Well, someone had to step in.” Harry laughs. “You wouldn’t let me touch you or even look at you properly and Merlin knows that you’d have bitten my head off if I’d brought it up with you.”
“I—I can’t concentrate when you’re doing that,” Draco complains, and Potter laughs softly, kissing his jaw once before pulling back a little.
“It’s not even eleven yet,” Draco remarks, cheeks pink. Potter just smiles. “I brewed the potions you asked for,” Draco adds, picking the case back up and taking a few tentative steps forward. Potter is still half naked and Draco’s hand trembles as he holds out the case, biting his lip as their gazes meet for one fleeting second when Potter steps (closer than necessary) forward and takes it.
“We’ll get there,” Harry said, fondly amused. Draco’s belt buckle clanged loudly as it hit the floor, the elastic of his pants snapping loudly against his skin as Harry dragged it down the curve of his buttocks and down past his thighs.
“Oh, I think I’d do just fine,” he replies, smirking slowly at Draco. “Try it on,” he adds, nodding at the watch.
“Well, they’re not exactly lining up to put themselves through it, are they,” Hermione laughs, “but I think there
His thoughtful expression is so affected that I roll my eyes. “Most of them,” he says loftily, and I roll my eyes again.
“Why do you ask me that every single time you come back from a work trip?” I frown and eat another bite of the knafeh.
That by itself is sufficient to make Harry release his mouth and drop his forehead onto Malfoy’s shoulder, letting out a rough sound that comes out as more of a sob. Malfoy swivels his hips, repeating the firm grind into Harry’s cock and Harry
“No,” I answer automatically as I hungrily gaze at him; I’ve never gone so long without seeing him. It’s been almost a fortnight. The urge to touch him is overwhelming.
It ought to have felt like a victory. He’d just physically pushed Potter onto his knees and he had acquiesced beautifully. But now he's looking up at him, gazing up at him, wordlessly urging Draco to do
“No,” Potter says slowly. “You’re rather a lot more accomplished than any of us were back then. Your magic does really pack a punch, Malfoy. You’re just not tryi—” he breaks off suddenly and looks rather pensive even as Draco glares at him as though daring him to continue. “You
things after his shower, and his hair is in an uncombed, messy topknot, little bunches of hair slipping free and falling along his face and down his shoulders. Despite his Veela-blood, he knows his skin looks worn and that he has bags under his eyes after his mostly disturbed sleep the previous night. He also feels shamefully vain as he stands there fretting about his appearance instead of the hundred other things he should be fretting about.
, and it’s hot and slippery as I helplessly start to pump my hips. He’s got his face pressed into the side of my neck, sucking little kisses there, his nails pressing harder against my skin and then easing up with every slide in and out of him. It feels so indescribably perfect, so
When he stood up, his ankle made its displeasure known but Harry ignored it. He turned to face Malfoy who was no longer smirking but watching them with a curiously blank expression instead.
“How does it matter?” Harry snorts, raising his eyebrows, adjusting himself with a hiss of discomfort. “The point is that I fucked him for four hours straight and I’m still--”
“Better yours than mine,” he says, lips brushing Harry’s sweaty temple. “This is why I didn’t want to sit on your cock.”
“Fuck off, Potter, I know you’re practically having a party right now, having learnt what you have about me.”
“I—I just...” Draco glares into his tea before just slumping slightly, “Fine, I do care, tell me how it went.”
Releasing Draco’s cock for a moment, Potter shoves Draco’s boxers down the curve of his arse, pulling his fingers out of Draco’s mouth and bringing them, dripping wet, to his crease. Draco is soft and loose from when they’d fucked before lunch and Potter’s fingers slip right in with a shameful ease, his palm pressed up against Draco’s cleft as he digs around and immediately locates his prostate.
Harry smiled lazily, licking once more, this time slower, and slipping the point of his tongue under the foreskin; he tasted like cinnamon and fresh sweat. Malfoy sobbed softly, shifting under him again, and Harry dragged his hands down over the scars up to his hips, which he then caught hold of, curling his fingers under it and pressing his thumbs along the pointed edges.
for more. Potter doesn’t spank him again, though, instead just roughly grabbing the tender cheek again and shoving it sideways so he can sink his face back in.
“Please,” Malfoy chokes out, rutting his cock in increasingly fevered strokes through the rigid circle of Harry’s hand, twisting and jerking each time Harry teases his cock under the glans and pinches the slit to squeeze out a drop of precome. He moans and flails under him, thighs falling wider and wider open, chest and swollen belly heaving with his laboured breathing, and when Harry finally crouches between his thighs and replaces his hand with his mouth, Malfoy screams hoarsely and immediately fucks deep into Harry’s throat. “Fuck! Potter,
For one, petrifying moment, Draco’s’s worried that Potter might attack, might actually pounce and rip into him.
“No,” Harry cuts in, bored. “I haven’t had my cock in a bloke’s arse in the longest fucking time and if that by itself doesn’t tell you how
“Yeah?” Harry’s fingers flexed around the elastic once; Malfoy’s nostril’s flared as if in irritation.
Draco loses himself in the rhythmic, velvety slide over his tongue, heavy and pulsing. Potter’s cock is hot in his mouth, and it
fuck a cat, I swear it wasn’t--” But Malfoy is laughing now, rounded shoulders shaking as he throws his head back and chortles loudly, eyes twinkling with mischief, cheeks pink with amusement. Harry
“Better?” she asks gently, pressing a kiss to his belly. Scorpius squirms with a giggle, wiping his nose on his sleeve.
Harry’s breath whooshes out of him and he finds himself back on his feet, hands in his hair as he gapes at Hermione in disbelieving, incredulous confusion. Hermione’s own mouth is pursed tightly and her eyes are slits as she stares thoughtfully at Malfoy.
“Don’t be a prick, Malfoy,” Harry says impatiently, sitting on the very edge of his seat and turning halfway to look at him properly, “Tell us what’s going on.”
“—wolfsbane.” Granger tilts her head, her gaze travelling up along the shaft of moonlight to the skylight. “And the mixture has been...left to mature?” she turns to Draco, who nods, “Under moonlight.”
“I—yeah,” Potter seems surprised, “You?” His gaze slips to the music-box on Draco’s bedside table. Smirking, Draco nods and Potter immediately returns his smile, eyes flaring with something akin to careful hope behind his smudged, lopsided specs, before he looks worried again. “Are you...not feeling well?” he asks, taking one step forward.
“I’m staying,” Harry says at once, walking over and sitting next to him, deliberately close enough that their sides are pressed together lightly. Malfoy slants him a long, cool look but remains silent and in place. “Please don’t do this,” Harry whispers, looking straight ahead; through the floor length windows, he can see the expansive grounds outside, gleaming wetly from the weak drizzle, the weather cold and miserable, and oddly apt for the way Harry’s feeling.
Malfoy doesn’t answer him. He’s clenching his teeth so hard that Harry can almost hear the dull grinding.
“And you,” I grit out, “need to get the fuck out before I fling you out the door and leave your drunken arse there for the neighbours to find.”
The rest of the night was a bit of a blur and Harry remembers it in foggy bits and pieces – Seamus climbing onto the bar and dancing raunchily for a full forty seconds before toppling over and ending up with a shard of glass from his pint bottle embedded in his arm, howling for Dean to save his life before he died on his birthday, Ron following a startled, perm-haired young woman around bellowing
,” Ron begged, raking a hand through his hair in frustration as Harry stiffened in his seat, gaze fixed on Malfoy was just about to exit the Great Hall after dinner. “You’re driving me up the wall, Harry, I’m serious.”
Potter’s eyes flash and Draco’s heart leaps. But then, “Can you just be quiet for a minute, Malfoy?” He speaks softly, almost beseechingly, and Draco almost can’t bear it at all. “I just want to tell you something, okay?”
“Bill softened his fall,” Ginny glances over at the little group under the tree, “Hermione says he might have a broken shin but that he’s mostly in shock.”
Octavia wiggles her bejewelled fingers at the poor bastard, Draco rolling his eyes as he sifts through his messages.
“No wonder your hair never sparkled in school, then,” Potter says, quirking him another crooked grin.
” Malfoy gritted out vehemently. “What happened was completely consensual, okay, Potter? So you can rest easy.”
And we both shot towards it at literally the exact same moment, that idiot letting out a little whoop as I flattened myself on my broom. And he has the better broom; I’m on Ron’s old Cleansweep.
“Harry,” Draco murmured, plunging both hands into his wild mass of jet black hair, tugging lightly. Harry pulled off with a soft pop.
Draco simply glares up at him for a minute before suddenly rolling them over, right off the sofa and onto the floor, Potter landing on his back on the rug with a startled grunt, Draco landing heavily atop him, almost accidentally kneeing him in the bits. He leans over, fisting his hands in Potter’s t-shirt and twisting, his hair falling down around their faces like a glossy curtain as he bares his teeth and hisses, “You’re
Draco just made a small nasal sound in reply, tilting his head back and cradling Harry’s head with one hand as he sucked up mottled little bruises on Draco’s neck, Draco’s other hand still firmly wrapped around Harry’s cock. He moved his hand in short, broken strokes, working the foreskin up and down until he could feel precome start to collect between the folds.
“Oh.” Harry held up the soaked shirt in one hand and pointed Malfoy’s wand at it. “I sort of skived off Potions today.”
“Not yet,” Potter says cheerfully. “I’d like to take out to dinner at least once before we put a label on this.”
Maybe it’s something else altogether, something Draco would never be able to guess or know more about; or maybe it was just Draco’s own filtered view of the tousled prat. Maybe Draco was simply imagining this indiscernible change in Potter; maybe Potter still is the incorrigible piece of shit Draco once wanted to ruin.
And now he’s supposed to sit here and successfully convince Potter that he finds nothing about him pleasing.
His eyebrows shoot up, disappearing under his fringe, and his nostrils flare in irritation. “I’m not going to stand here and enable your innate obnoxiousness, Potter.” His lip curls into that ugly sneer and for a moment, it’s easy enough to remember that he’s Draco
The next second he leapt up and scrambled up Draco’s side, ending up on his shoulder and sniffing enthusiastically behind his ear. Draco froze in horror and stared over at a rather shocked Harry.
Draco doesn’t really react but for a smooth lift of one shapely eyebrow. “Because telling me and telling the whole world is the same thing?” he drawls.
“I have some news,” Malfoy answers calmly, still standing very close to his mother, her hand curled around his arm. “Let’s sit down, Mother?”
“Please!” Malfoy shouts back, bucking his hips backwards, one cheek pressed into the pillow as he peers desperately over his shoulder, eyes glazed and hungry.
“Bill,” Ron half yells down to the other end of the table. “Up for some one-on-one Seeking? Ginny has a Snitch.”
And with another kiss to Draco’s wryly grinning mouth, he was zooming away, leaving Draco there with the winning Snitch and jauntily flying away with his heart.
He can go ahead and marry that Tristan for all I care. I’m done with him. I think I’d made that evident with my decision to walk out of that club earlier. I cannot voluntarily remain friends with him and watch him pledge himself to someone else when I love him the way I do, with the intensity with which I do. When I allow myself to acknowledge it, acknowledge that it
Draco is seated on a barstool and Tristan is standing behind him, plastered close, his arm wound around Draco’s neck. Draco has one hand clasped around that arm. The other hand is idly spinning an empty tumbler on the bar. He’s listening to something Parkinson is saying, nodding, but his right knee is bouncing restlessly – I wonder at that. Zabini is standing beside Parkinson, eyes fixed on one of the cavorting girls who’s making eyes at him from the dance floor.
Potter, who’s dressed in the same shirt and jeans he’d worn the previous night, still hasn’t noticed Draco standing behind him. Potter, who is barefooted and mussed, and is making breakfast for them...
“Molly said she’d bring dinner for everyone,” Harry says vaguely, sieving out the flour now. “Can I make you some breakfast, babe?”
When Harry looks back around, Malfoy is lying down, the pale stretch of his belly visible under Hermione’s elbow as she waves her wand in circles. Malfoy has got his hands clasped over his chest and is staring determinedly at the ceiling, his face and demeanour anxious and oddly soft now, from where Harry watches.
be alone on Christmas. Not when we’ve only just—” He doesn’t continue, kissing Malfoy’s nose lightly instead.
Harry Potter was exasperatingly impatient and had little regard for finely tailored clothing – Draco now knew several of the school house-elves by name simply because of the innumerable times he’d had to seek one of them out to request them to sew the buttons on his shirt back on. And so when his shirt was carelessly jerked open and he heard what sounded like at least two buttons pinging across the flagstones, Draco just
Draco fidgets, frowning as he gives it genuine thought – he pictures his old flat, the dingy, cramped little space he’d lived in for so long, stomach plummeting with humiliation at the very memory of Potter’s expression as he’d discovered him there.
But Draco Malfoy is not someone you dismiss in a conversation. Because he’s the one who usually does the dismissing.
Scorpius grinned and looked down at them. He lifted timid eyes to Draco who sighed and reached for them, opening the bag.
“This ... This is ...” Draco breathed, looking between Harry’s face and the tattoo. Harry shrugged. “When did you ...?”
“Are you asking me or telling me?” I note that I sound rather sharp but Ron evidently doesn’t care about it as he simply shrugs.
“But then you go and do something like that,” Weasley continues smoothly, as if he hadn’t just sent something piercing right through Draco. “Something so incredibly stupid, so completely ill-thought out – is it love, after all?” Weasley sing-songs, smirking.
“There,” Harry said softly, pushing free the last button. Malfoy sighed through his nostrils as he pushed the shirt open wider; Harry inhaled sharply and Malfoy started, looking up at Harry with a little frown, noting his expression of horror as he took in the sight of Malfoy’s chest, and then quickly pulling his shirt closed once more.
Large and spacious with high, old-fashioned rosewood furniture, the room reminds Draco of the Manor. There’s a fire roaring merrily and a rickety old Wireless sits on the mantel, the music soft and unobtrusive. The entire right side wall is taken up by a giant, glass-fronted bookshelf, two round reading tables in front of it with a set of cosy armchairs grouped around both of them. The bright chandelier overhead is electric but there are still several candles lit on the wall-sconces, sputtering only very slightly in the chill breeze blowing in from the open French windows on the left. The soft, pastel drapes look freshly laundered, and billow in a slow dance until Potter saunters over and pulls the sliding glass windows partially shut, so that suddenly the room feels even quieter, more still. The upholstery on the furniture is rich, royal blue velvet and the cushions all stand in place, plump and fluffy, like they’ve not been disturbed at all.
“How many times do I have to ask you to call me Harry?” Potter asks, leaving Draco yet another bruise on his throat and lapping at it carefully.
He sits down on the plush rug next to Potter and waits. The fire flares wide and bright, spitting very quietly every now and then. Someone’s pet cat slinks into view, purring loudly, and slowly walks up to them, gliding against Draco’s hip with a squeaky meow before disappearing under a sofa.
If Draco shuts his eyes he can still picture Potter’s thin, pinched eleven year old face, guarded yet firmly set as he informs Draco that he can
The scheduled trip to Hogsmeade the following weekend was as big a disaster as anybody could’ve predicted it might be. Malfoy and Ron glared at each other from the moment Malfoy met the three of them at the front doors. They walked up to Hogsmeade in frosty silence, Harry and Hermione making wildly cheery conversation to compensate, and when they got to the village, it was decided that their first stop would be Honeydukes.
, but just then Potter’s fossil of an elf trots over and thrusts a familiar looking vial of pellucid blue potion at Potter, who takes it with that slightly nauseous expression Draco finds amusing and piteous all at once.
“Not really, no,” Harry admitted, throwing another glance at the flash of blond hair just visible over the teetering pile of books on Malfoy’s table.
It took a lot of long, gasped pulls of air for both of them to catch their breath, Harry’s hand gentling through Draco’s hair, carefully smoothing it off Draco’s sweaty forehead. Both of them were slick with perspiration and Draco still trembled lightly as Harry turned him around for a slow kiss that deepened until they were both clinging to each other.
, of course, and it’s primitive and incredibly powerful and--” she sighed sadly, “I suppose now’s the chance for you to really get out there more, to look for someone.”
Draco Malfoy, apparently still asleep, was (presumably) experiencing a wet dream as Harry stood and watched.
Ruthlessly resisting the temptation to find friction against his own erection, Harry lets Malfoy hold his head in place and fuck his face, keeping up steady suction throughout. He teases the sensitive crown each time he pulls off, sucking hard on the slit and running the tip of his tongue under the ridge of the rosy head. One hand he keeps curled around the base of his cock, ignoring the way Malfoy desperately claws at it from time to time. With his other hand, he strokes the incredible softness of Malfoy’s sac, thumbing the delicate, silken skin and rolling around his tightening balls with gentle little tugs.
It’s not exactly been a fucking picnic, seeing and talking to Draco on a daily basis and pretending like I don’t want to simultaneously snog and hex him every time I lay eyes on him. On the plus side, I’ve had a recent surge in cases that require hours of field work and have shamelessly exploited the excuse to keep away from the office (and Draco), and then have cited well-justified exhaustion to skip out on the usual bi-weekly post-work pints.
no relief even with wanking,” Harry murmurs, sounding pained, as he sinks into his chair behind his own desk and tugs off his glasses, rubbing at his eyes. “It just... It stays hard even after I’ve c--” He breaks off, sighing, not even sure if he’s embarrassed anymore.
He’s paying for his books, Harry, drumming his fingers impatiently on the wooden counter as the sales clerk counts out his change.
to make an effort with Tristan. He’s never been with someone for as long as he’s been with Tristan so maybe the guy really is alright?
“Jamie, listen to me, please.” Harry felt desperate suddenly. Helpless. All he wanted to do was find a spot to sit down and have a good, long cry. “We cannot go back home right now. Yes? It is not safe. Not safe at all. Do you remember? Right before we left?”
“Fuck off, Potter,” he kicks me lightly in the shin. “And I promise I won’t disappear on you again – not until I’ve secured a nice, tight arse for you to fuck through the night.”
There was a contemptuous snort on the other end. “Yes, I’m sure.” Neither of them said anything for a while.
Harry’s pained shout of release is broken against Malfoy’s open mouth, their lips moving slickly as Harry vigorously works his climax into him, pressing one foot into the bed to gain leverage, his arm tightening around Malfoy’s long, white thigh, his hips slapping loudly into the dampness of his sweaty lower back.
“I suggested we go with a French press or something,” Granger said, looking slightly pained and very contrite. “I mean, we all know how much Draco loves fresh coffee ...”
James reached for something behind Harry and then lifted Lily into Harry’s arms. When Harry nestled her close, he saw she was conscious and once again cocooned in a Warming charm. Looking up at him, she sobbed once, her lip trembling, her eyes terrified. She looked utterly exhausted. At once Harry knew that absolutely could not let another dementor anywhere near her for as long as he could manage.
Malfoy, his face devoid of any emotion or expression now, stands, ignoring Harry’s hand. “Let’s go,” he says shortly, wiping his face on his sleeve and stepping around Harry, making for the door with his usual easy grace, one hand on his swollen stomach, and the other clenched into a tight fist at his side as he walks away from Harry without looking back.
“You’re completely bonkers, Potter,” Malfoy says softly, rolling his eyes and shoving Harry’s shoulder lightly before turning away. “And for Merlin’s sake, warn me next time you’re releasing a statement featuring me as part of your love-life.”
Malfoy instantly looks aloof. “I’m not worried.” He turns away stiffly to resume staring out the window, absently rubbing his stomach with one hand as he watches a kid dressed as an astronaut screech as he fights over a large slab of chocolate with another little girl dressed as a witch. “
Draco had only just finished his course on medicinal potions and had been applying for jobs at apothecaries before Harry, newly appointed Junior Auror himself, suggested he apply at Mungo’s too. Draco had been extremely doubtful of his chances there considering his background and when he’d received the owl telling him he’d been appointed as assistant brewer to the head potioneer at Mungo’s, it took every bit of self-control not to violently confront Harry about whether he’d had anything to do with it.
Mostly just trying not to sick up after that, Draco sits there and slowly sips tea as Potter eats his breakfast, the silence between them surprisingly light, more comfortable than Draco would’ve expected it to be after the topics of conversation they’d covered in the immediate and recent past. Potter continues to dart glances at Draco, something that the Veela in him is used to by now, except Potter seems to be...
“Did you say it back?” Seamus’ eyes are alarmingly wide. Draco just stares impassively at him for a few seconds before emphatically mouthing ‘woman’ at him. “You
“Then you should have,” Draco grumbles, with a mischievous laugh, when Harry gapes at him in incredulity. “What? You’re known internationally for your bravery. Aren’t you brave enough to ask me for a fuck?”
in place – for the multitude of reactions exploding within him, sheepish relief being the strongest, and breathless,
Draco stares at him, Potter’s words swirling around in his mind, blindingly radiant in its honestly. “Surely
Draco knocks again, three sharp raps with his knuckles and waits, seething silently. He knows Harry is home – he can feel Harry’s magic crackling around the door – and he knows that Harry knows it’s
Draco’s forehead thumps onto Harry’s shoulder, his hand slipping between the buttons on Harry’s shirt and resting warm and steady over his heart; Harry smells of blood, smoke, dirt and...of them, of Harry and Draco.
“Hi,” he said hoarsely. “Hi, Malf-ack!” He suddenly relapsed into coughing and Draco stood there and seriously considered putting Potter out of his misery and just rejoining his friends.
Draco still has a tiny limp the next day, his knee throbbing whenever he shifts his weight to his left side or walked too fast. His hand aches as he makes notes in class, sore after the way Potter had bent it back on itself. His neck and shoulders and arms are knotted and painful from the way he and Potter had heaved and grappled, fighting to throw each other off.
Potter jumps a bit but seems to recognise Draco’s voice even before he’s turned around fully, slanting him a small smile over his shoulder. “Couldn’t sleep,” he tells him.
,” he grits out, wrapping both arms around Malfoy’s waist and squeezing. “Fucking hold on,” he growls, and doesn’t wait for Malfoy to finish wrapping his arms securely around his shoulders before Disapparating.
“Why can’t we go get her?” he asked. “You said you don’t know if she’s dead for sure. Why can’t we go check?”
“As my wing man who fucking disappeared on me, I advise you not to finish that sentence,” I say pointedly. He bites his lip on a grin, looking slightly guilty.
“’s good,” Potter says gruffly, gently grabbing Draco’s wrist and guiding the proffered bit of pastry into his own mouth, his tongue dragging over Draco’s fingertips for the briefest second. “Oh, yeah, that’s really good,” Potter agrees as he chews, holding Draco’s wrist for another beat before letting go.
And then Harry felt as though he had walked out into a snowstorm. Behind him, the boys gasped in unison and Lily burst into tears. Harry felt as though his feet were frozen to the wooden floors.
to one bouncing cheek. Malfoy moans even louder, arse lifting further as he yanks his robes off over his head, his hair spilling messily down his back, some of it hanging into his face.
Harry stares, exasperated. “I have my doubts about Samuel something being my soulmate, but I still don’t intend to take him straight to bed to bugger senseless, Ron.”
Draco doesn’t think about how he feels more disappointed than relieved that Potter is about to put some clothes on. But the next second, he isn’t thinking about anything at all. Potter tugs the towel off and when Draco catches sight of his left shoulder, his mind just goes blank with horror.
Working his hips to thrust into the tight circle of Draco’s fist, Harry focused on nothing but kissing and nipping his way down Draco’s front, nibbling on his collar bones, pulling his nipples up into tight little buds and leaving deep indentations with his teeth along Draco’s sides. Draco was hard and dripping already and could barely contain the gasps that were teased out of him.
When he’d left, once again reminding Potter not to forget his daily doses, Potter said, quite suddenly, “So...I won’t be seeing you until after the next full moon?”
“Healer-patient confidentiality assures you both of complete discretion regardless of whom you consult with,” Hermione says, with a wry smile, “but yes, there’s a certain level of trust here that Harry thought would work well in--”
“No. No, I didn’t,” Draco said, facing Potter properly. The bastard hit him with a full blown grin, mischievous and aggravatingly attractive, and Draco wanted so bad to reciprocate. “Because it really isn’t anybody’s business but my own, is it, Potter?”
He curled them tightly as Harry placed a soft kiss to his instep, just to soothe Malfoy (and truthfully, maybe even himself) before deliberately pushing his legs open wide. Stretching himself out in between, Harry took a second to try and calm his hysterically shrieking brain.
Turning to the nearest tree, Harry pulled out his cock and relieved his bladder, muttering furiously under his breath the whole time.
“Do you want it to happen again?” Harry looked up now, straight into Malfoy’s eyes, and didn’t even bother to keep the hope out of his own voice. “Because I can’t tell if you do or not, Malfoy. It’s
Ron’s eyes brighten as he comes up to us; he creeps up behind Draco, motioning to us to be quiet with a finger on his lips, and at the last second, just as the blond brings his hand back behind his shoulder, Ron jumps forward with a roared, “HEY, MALFOY!” grabbing him around the neck, and Draco throws the dart about two feet to the left of the board with a startled squawk.
“Wow,” Ron deadpans as I curse and wave my wand in the general direction of the kitchen. The mop is still whizzing across the floor in there a couple of minutes later when the Floo flares and Hermione appears in a blur of lime green.
Scrambling slightly, struggling not to drop the ridiculously large armload, Malfoy bares his teeth at Ron, his glare intensifying when his reading glasses suddenly slip off his nose and skitter onto the floor.
all these things to Draco, when Draco had just about managed to gather the courage to try and prod something out of Potter regarding the nature of their relationship. Now, as Potter gently undoes a button or two on Draco’s shirt and licks his way down the exposed skin, Draco can barely even come up with and string together two random words, leave alone anything else.
Grinning that open-hearted beam that Draco privately swooned over, Harry was making a beeline for him, speeding in a maroon blur. Draco only then realised that he himself was grinning right back. As Harry drew nearer, it suddenly became crystal clear just what he was about to do.
“Really?” Potter tilts his head, getting up and coming around his desk, stopping a few feet away from Draco, “You want to venture a guess?”
“Yeah, but you begged for my cock anyway,” Potter reminds him smoothly, ducking out of the smack Draco aims at his head before dipping his head back over his chest. “Not that I’m complaining...”
Barely half a minute after he’d let himself into the alcove behind the tapestry with the angry centaurs on it, Harry was on him.
Malfoy nodded feverishly. “Oh god, yes, fine!” He parted his legs under Harry, wide enough that they hung off the bed. “Do it. Just
More than five years Malfoy and he have been partners, going from barely able to stand each other at twenty-two, to whatever they are now at nearly twenty-eight. Ron is still his best friend, but at his lowest, it’s Malfoy Harry finds himself seeking out. Ron is still his favourite drinking buddy, but when he wants to avoid a Burrow full of loving, genuinely caring Weasleys, it’s Malfoy he Floos.
With a blunt rustle, the shower curtain is pushed aside and then Harry is stepping in, naked and smirking, eyes gleaming as they rove down Draco’s body, wet and soapy. With a spluttering squeak, Draco skids and almost falls out of the tub.
Next thing he knew, he’d been whirled around and pressed face first into the wall with his arm bent at the elbow, wrist being held in an unbreakable grip at his lower back. “I’m always in the mood to fuck you.” Harry closed his teeth around one earlobe and pulled gently, nipping at it as he released it.
Draco shudders, mouth twisting. “You’re going to make me lose my lunch,” he declares flatly. “And stop lounging. Have you finished drafting the invitation letter to the Bulgarian Minister? The conference is in three weeks, the letter needs to go out today.”
“Thank god,” says Draco, relieved as he puts his menu aside. “I don’t know what the hell all these mean anyway, so I’ll just have what you’re having.”
“Yes, well, this potion is about three minutes away from exploding all over me,” Draco stammers, erupting in gooseflesh as Potter gives him an idle lick over his jugular, “so if you—if you don’t let go of me and let me Vanish it, I’m going to smell like a
“We’ll see you later, love,” Granger calls again, taking Weasley by the arm and dragging him out. “Take care now.”
“Did I think they’d actually get married? No,” replies Harry. “Did I know they’d get together because of
Harry’s balls are tightly drawn up against his body when Draco finally lets them slip out of his mouth, nuzzling into the crevice between his spit-slick sac and heavily bobbing cock before finally moving up and straddling him, sighing softly and smiling down at Harry when he wrenches open his eyes to gaze blankly at Draco, heaving great big gasping breaths, eyes filled with nothing but mindless, aching arousal.
—” Potter starts loudly, eyes flashing, before lowering his voice deliberately. “I am not feeling sorry for myself, Malfoy. Are you forgetting what I am?”
“Well, it was all him,” she replies idly, bouncing one foot against the floor. “He was very keen to ensure you had a lovely birthday.”
He laps, crazed and barely seeming aware of Draco’s mewling cries, from Draco’s steadily tightening balls up to his tailbone, slathering his crease with saliva before spreading Draco
Grimacing slightly he turns to look at Granger who’s, to nobody’s surprise, standing beside the wall of books with her arms filled with about six, enormous tomes. She’s
Hermione’s face is cool and empty of expression as she holds it up. “’Possible tumour/foetus’” she reads in a monotone. “’Compromised magical strength’. ‘Prescribed Remedial Potions:
But then Draco is wandering back in, humming idly, pushing his sleeves up his arms. Ron wordlessly throws himself back onto the sofa, stretching his legs out and crossing his feet on the coffee table. Draco stops dead in his tracks, staring first at Ron’s relaxed form and then at me, just frozen in place and staring dumbly.
“Stop encouraging this behaviour!” Draco shouted, pointing as though the scene wasn’t self-explanatory. Harry turned to him, hands held up in a helpless gesture, his mouth, pursed around his toothbrush, quivering with the grin he was holding back.
That is, until Potter reaches the hard beads of his nipples. He closes his mouth around one right away, not bothering with slow teases, and sucks, and Draco nearly sends Potter toppling right off the bed.

I don’t answer him as I shove a forkful of sausage into my mouth. I can feel his gaze fixed firmly on me and chew steadily until I finally relent and look up, swallowing and then clearing my throat.
“The others not here yet?” he pants at Harry and Harry simply shakes his head, finishing most of his fifth beer in one enormous gulp.
“You remember the attack last night?” he said and James nodded miserably. “Those creatures...dementors...they can steal the soul from your body. And—and they stole Mum’s.”
Potter’s own full head of hair is right there and his left hand is still on Draco’s hip and his eyes are shut as he smells Draco’s hair and Draco is so painfully hard that he’s on the very verge of actual tears. So it’s not something he’s able to stop himself doing when he yanks Potter’s head up and crashes their mouth together, flinging his arms around his shoulders.
at you,” Harry groans, palming his arse wide open so that Draco is left shivering with cool air running up his crack.
With Lily on his hip, Harry led his sons into the kitchen. Another trunk, this one filled with dry provisions, bottled water, and fruit, sat on the dining table, magicked down to the size of a thick novel. Harry set Lily in her chair and brought the trunk back up to full size. He flung it open and Summoned two bananas. Then he locked it and shrunk it back down before shoving it into his undershirt.
Potter!” he hisses, colour leaking down his neck and across the little sliver of his collarbones that’s visible beneath the collar of his cream button-down, where his tie has been loosened some. “How drunk
Malfoy looked a tiny bit overwhelmed as he smiled tightly again, this time at the ground. “Yes. All of you.”
