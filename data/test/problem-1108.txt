The gardens looked as dead as some part of me felt, barren and gone, the ring on my figure felt heavy and I almost didn't put on, almost let it sit in the box and didn't think to look at the ring next to it. The one my mother always wore. Lucius noticed me messing with it and smiled a little "Draco you don't have to wear it, you can put it away and not look at it if you want." Narcissa and I looked at him, causing him to roll his eye, asking him if I wanted to take it off. My tongue moved against the back of my teeth as I  thought and questioned whether I really wanted it off or if I was simply not used to it. Lucius didn't push me for an answer, even once we had gotten inside and my robe was removed.
"Remove your tights." Daffodil's tone was cold and uncaring. She broke the chain to let Alice removing the obstructing clothing. Enjoying the hisses and cries of pain from the women. The tights were soaked and the smell of urine filled the air. Daffodil banished it with a wave of her hand. Twigs in hand she set to work re-interrogating Alice.
"Not from here, I need shoes but the one they sell here always break after a few weeks or months." I hid behind Lucius as the lady was scanning all the clothes, I'd ended up picking out a good amount of things, I may have gone a bit crazy. When she was done I heard the price £181 for thirteen things
Together the three of us walk to breakfast; I a lot slower than them. I shoo away anyone from tries to comfort me, taking my place beside my uncle. Daffodil's attendance surprises many of the concubines here. The Emperor starts the meal but I have no appetite for the selection of rice, toast, or anything else on the table. I feel someone watch me as I play around with the toast on my plate. I look up and notice a small boy; teen really, glances back down at his plate; he's leaning on Remus as if for physical support. Somehow he looks as upset as I am. I can't help but feel like he wants to talk to me after breakfast. I know my uncle won't let me spend all day in our Palace, and neither will Daffodil. Instead, I take a walk through the City.
I zoned out as Draco spoke to his friends, they sat around him, like a circle protecting him from the other Slytherins, mainly older years who don't get the hint and want a play-toy. I heard my name ghostly, as I felt a book hit my arm I heard Professor McGonagall yell my name "Yes?" I said after she yelled my name, we heard a small crack in the air "I didn't know her voice was that loud." Ron whispered to Hermione. "You need to go to Professor Snape's office after your second lesson." I nodded and went back to eating, out of the corner of my eye I saw Draco leave the hall. I went after him.
It's been a few weeks, Harry hasn't been raised well. I noticed that immediately, so does Severus. I've held off talking to him about it, letting him settle in first, but I will talk to him about it at least, that and his ill and sickly appearance.
I was correct, Draco is baking, and more specifically making the buttercream. He smiles at me, his sleeves rolled up, cake batter all over his arm. I stifle a giggle and walk up behind him with a damp cloth wiping his arms clean, the mark moves under it and makes Draco twitch. Causing him to turn up the speed on our electronic whisker. "Harry?" I nod happily, he no longer seems to mind "I'm making you a cake." I smile and nod.
I heard a door push wide open and hurried shuffling footsteps towards the bed "Harry, I need to ask you a question." He said sitting in the bed and taking Cygnus from me, who easily went back to sleep "Harry, how would feel if I stayed exactly the same, forever?" I blinked and sat up, I couldn't really see Draco, "What do you mean?" He sighed and opened the curtains, I blinked and my mouth opened, his hair looked so soft and his face..."Why are you asking me?" Draco smiled and blushed, running his hand through Cygnus' hair "Well, I care about your opinion, and I do really care about you, Harry honestly." I smiled and bit my lip, "I mean, I wouldn't mind, but I really think I shouldn't have much of say..." I saw Draco smile as he patted my head, he pecked a small kiss to the crown of my head, "I'll get dressed to see Sev, you can stay here if you want, and call Steph if Cygun's and Aliette wake up, I'll be back soon, I promise." I nodded and laid back down.
As soon as I leave into the gardens, the air assaults me and I'm thrown into childhood memories of running around freely without much of a care in the world. Shaking my head I look up and among the several trees, I notice a stone building in the distance. Rushing up a tower, I stare into the Black onyx that greets my vision. My palm grips the mossed brick of the old tower I'm in as I stare at my home; the deep, almost sparkling marble glistens as the sun rises against it, taking a breath I realise that no matter what I do, I can't run away from this place. I will always have to return at some point, today is just one of those days.
He sat down on a stool, watching as I rest my head back into the water and seem quite an at peace "We are about a mile away from home."  My head moves forwards as I look at him in near alarm, my mouth opens to speak "Draco, yes it's visible and no we cannot back out now and turn away." He kneeled to full height and held my hand "I know that this will be hard for you, to return, it's hard for me as well and, depending on who is judging, harder for me. But try your hardest to not think about them, about it. I will do the same."
Sighing I take a deep breath and hear typing. "I know it's annoying for you, I can try to talk some sense into them for you." Smiling I open my eyes nodding rapidly feeling much more joyful than I was a few seconds ago.
Chapter six: August 10th > Draco and Harry are together and talking about the past and things Harry has experienced, with Draco asking what Remus and Sirius were like outside of the City, (the motorbike is also mentioned). When Harry asked Draco stays quiet and doesn’t answer much, not wanting to. Harry gets excited over fish and the water.
"Harry, I didn't mean to do what I did, but I've been acting, towards you, and everyone else." I paused as I realised what I had done. I stepped back and gulped, I hadn't meant to interrupt him.
I'm leaving at dawn so that I get the best chance to get home, I also see the Imperial carriage go trough Surrey; I don't know how good of a thing that is. Apparently one of them lives in Surrey, but the Emperor doesn't know in what conditions. I simply hope I get home in time to say goodbye if I have to.
Chapter seven: August 10th> The point of view shifts to Severus as Narcissa sees him and asks some questions about Lucius, he asks about the necklace she's wearing. After that interaction Draco wakes up from a nap with Harry coughing, giving him some water. Harry asks if Draco and Lucius sleep together a lot, Draco eventually answers yes.
The walls that surround this city are tall and thick, made of stone; they trap us in our palaces and paradise of Imperial Luxury and Wealth. My knowledge of the outside world is based on my enriched and vigorant education in History, Politics, and Languages. I know every aspect of our history; the failures, the victories, names, dates, books, I know 7 languages that could be of verbal use, the others are only found in books in the Emperor's library.
This made her look away and huff "I'm starting to see why Draco hates you so much." At that, my head shakes, oh she has no idea why the blonde child dislikes me, to be honest, I don't either but I have an inkling of a guess. "Regardless I might just do that and absolutely not, nothing is wrong with me."  Now I never said that, how dare she twist my words.
"Do I look alright? Harry, I'm fine, It's just numb with pain." Draco said stroking my hair, I looked at him, his eyes scanned my face, in the sunlight I could see a glaze to them, a shattered glaze, but one nonetheless.
I woke up with blue light streaming in through the window, and an arm wrapped around me, opening my eyes I squinted to see, and failed "Morning Harry."
"I want my aunt and uncle, life isn't fair, they know that they will be happy with their father." she rolled her eyes as I made a move to leave. They would be arriving within twenty minutes I want to be home for them.
"Do you have any idea about why I've called you here?" I shook my head, how I was I? He just decided to call me away from my friends on a Friday. Really what had I done? Although this could be about my sudden movement away from Draco, he seemed fine enough. But he was already gone when I woke up. Even I can't deny that I didn't sleep well last night; away from him.
Remind me to never say yes to going to a Ministry. The lifts are hot and stuffy, Draco looked like he was holding his breath; or breathing into his hand. Whatever he's doing I don't blame him, at all. We're here for a 'trip' by we I mean: Draco, me, Lucius, Narcissa, Bella, Tom and Severus. I was trapped between Draco and Bella, I am not enjoying the lift ride.
"I don't know how I feel," I told them, looking up at the two older and taller adults "I don't know how I should feel." I felt Lucius knelt down slightly and turn my head towards his, whispering something into my ear, before wrapping his arms around me, as Daffodil lightly kissed my temple. "Can we keep walking?" They both nod and hold my hands as we set off, letting our luggage be magically transported to our individual rooms.
Waiting patiently because I was a nice person, and I knew how long Draco would take, I picked up a book I saw lying around and opened the cover. There was nothing on the pages, for a black leather book, I thought it's interesting, at the least a sketchbook. "Where did you find that?" I looked up, he didn't sound angry, but he didn't sound pleased either. I opened my mouth and looked down, Draco sat beside me and lifted up my chin "Harry, please?" I swallowed.
A sweet lethal female voice emerged from a painting, she sounded a lot like Mother when she didn't like someone, only the Lady's voice seemed to promise death and suffering. I had never seen her before, but she sounded like she was from England. The way she was painted suggested that she must have been a Pureblood as the paint hadn't faded much despite other painting of her, her husband and son were old and worn. "Get out of my school, and never return."
As such I decided to not go into Ilvernmorny today at all, Harry begged to stay with me at 'home' my parents reluctantly agreed. So we're both staying in and I'm reading a long list of what to expect from the difference trials. Harry's on my lap reading a textbook.
I bid my uncle farewell with a kiss before wrapping a cloak around my shoulders, I could tell that he was concerned for my wellbeing, I would be too if I hadn't of been trusted with my own life. Setting off on foot, as exercise did everyone well. Plus we would be carried in the morning anyway. Little Moon let me into the Palace but warned me that he might not be in the best mood to speak, I nod and thank her for the warning. Even before I reach the doors I could hear his yelling, emotionless but angry, he was in pain I could tell. My hand brushes the handle as I gently pull it open. Walking around towards his office, the screams got louder and even more wrenching. I plastered on a brave face. Tom was our Emperor, he won't be made a fool of by some appointed man!
Harry didn't speak much during breakfast, he answers some questions but that was about it; I tried to make conversation but ultimately it fell flat. I was due to leave by two am, so that we got to England by seven in the morning, by we I mean me, my parents and the twins. Quite simple, expect it's anything but.
We stayed like that, for a while Harry moving slightly as his arm eventually got numb, by the time we heard the bell signifying that we had an hour left of our curfew I was already asleep curled into Harry. I felt the removal of my robe and slowly be lifted into a bed, Harry was lucky that I was becoming more and more lightweight.
I stayed with my father for the rest the day, basically following him until class where I tried to sit as close to him or mother as possible. I had muggle lessons throughout the afternoon. English and Mathematics, I found that I was profoundly brilliant at English the teacher had asked whether I read a lot of books, I did, old family dairies they were honestly more interesting than most thriller books I have seen available.
I woke up a little bit to pull the curtains shut with Magic, before falling asleep again. By this point though my uncle was beside me, sleeping soundly as well. I just felt the rising sun and didn't want to acknowledge it's existence. We still had another day to travel. My uncle had his arms wrapped around me and I had my legs around his own, this was how we normally slept expect this time my grip was tighter and his hand was on my back, supposedly soothing. My hips jerked forwards; a moan escaping my parted chapped lips. The vibrations of deep chuckle went straight up my hardened member. I gripped at the blanket with my hands and kept myself quiet to no avail. Small, thin and very wet; his tongue licked and lapped at my head eagerly swallowing down the pearls of precum that I could feel. His wicked and cruel tongue ran down the entire length of me, his slight choke made my hips thrush into his mouth further. Causing my ever collected uncle Lucius to swear and moan around my cock, the head already down his throat.
"Hello, my parents want to tell the Daily Prophet about Cygnus and Aliette. To do so they need your consent and they need you to be there, the house arrest doesn't affect this, I also think it might be a good idea, they won't be shamed as bastards, and I doubt we'll let the world pity them." Minutes of went by of simply listing, I was tense talking him without anyone with me was scary, to say the least.
My eyes snapped open as I jolted up and nearly fell out of bed, "Do you have any idea of how worried I was? You kept drifting in and out of consciousness, I was about to call Snape and Madam Pomfrey if you hadn't of woken up just now!" I blinked, all them weren't real, they were nightmares, but the first one definitely was. I mumbled an apology and got ready for breakfast.
"Terribly, of course, you were there during Hermione Granger's trial for attempted suicide and manslaughter," I remembered that it was when we had gone back I time to save Lupin, she had howled not thinking that he would follow so quickly. It almost killed both of us, when someone had mentioned that she punched Draco - unprovoked--in the face, the sentence was her wand being snapped but being allowed to go Hogwarts all Draco's idea. "But we never thought that it would have such lasting effects, the Light fraction are saying that we wrongly accused her, and a bit more people in the Grey/Neutral faction are on their side."
The Order, however, despite knowing that Iive with Draco nor once raised an eyebrow. I did get a semi welcoming, semi threating message from Remus though, so there's that and I don't send them stuff as often.
Harry's sleeping soundlessly beside me, smiling. So I can take a very good guess and say he's having a wonderful sleep, as he should be at 4:37 in morning. He curled around a small blanket he brought with him , chewing on it for seemingly no reason.
He nodded, although clearly surprised "I'm happy to let you go back, as there's very little chance I could get you into Hogwarts, but I have two questions. Firstly, how would we get you to Ilvenmorny, and secondly why do they let you take magical classes?"
"Harry!" I smiled and sat up. "Come with me, please." I looked up at him as I followed him upstairs to our shared dorm.
"You said that I could lead a sector of the Court, didn't you? Let me do that, I can implement Court members who are trusted and loyal into the Ministry as his advisors, Fudge is weak and stupid he will listen to anyone with money and the correct surname." I explain in the best way I can, going further into who and where and why. As I spoke, Tom listened, not once butting in to criticise me. At last, I finished, my breath lost and my mind at ease, a smile danced upon his lips.
sentence
Lucius smiled at me as I collapsed onto our bed, hugging a pillow to my chest, looking up at his warm grey eyes. His hand runs through my hair, growing out although I don't intend to keep it that way, he fingers untangle any knots and I sigh happily. At least being alone with him is a good thing. Being alone with anyone but Severus is a good thing. It's even better mid-morning when we can do nothing but rest and stay in bed. This moment of peace is soon shortlived, as Susan comes in within a few minutes, apologising profusely over disrupting us. With a glance at Lucius, I shake my head and beckon them forward. They're more mine than his, but right now it doesn't matter. I take her hand and slowly rub circles into the back of it. "Now now, no need to fret and worry. You did nothing wrong." Still, she seems to shake but nods, being conditioned that disagreeing will be met with pain.
The teacher we had communicated in sign, Citrus said that he didn't speak because of an accident that happened while he was at school, but he could talk. He had explained on the board that he was a cover teacher and would be our teacher until the original Chemistry teacher returned. Andrew, Citrus and Enalie helped me and Harry understand the lesson.
1. Kill Dumbledore
A few hours later, when I had given up on reading my book, and thus asked Hermione to place it back on the bookshelf, for I was too tired to move, Hermione ran to my side from where she was outside "Lady Malfoy is" she took a deep breath to try and talk properly "outside, should I let her in?" I blinked putting her sentence together. Of course, I didn't mind, but I felt so tired and drained. In the end, I nodded, I simply wouldn't move from my padded and comfortable chair and hoped Draco didn't mind.
"Draco, come with me." I followed after silently, into the Potions classroom as he went off and left me alone, it was only awhile. But it had its effect. He came back soon enough, coxing me into drinking the sour tasting creation, I couldn't tell what it was, but soon enough I was asleep and being carried into my dorm and laid on the bed.
My eyes well with hot tears, threatening to spill as I silently shake my head "No-I can't think about them-not without being away." A chocked sob wrecks me as a leaned against the wooden tub. I briefly hear my name being called, a lure back to reality, gently a hand on my chest pushes my head down, I remember to hold my breath just in time.
It was a few hours later when I saw Draco again after lunch, apparently, after I left to the Library Draco went back to bed to rest. I came in to get a book, and I saw him, softly sleeping the light lavender cover wrapped to his neck and his arm over it, resting his head on the pillow. I sat down and watched him, silently I pulled down the curtain and went to leave the room. I opened the door and waited, I heard a soft ruffle of bed sheets and a soft quite hum. Turning back around I saw Draco sitting down and looking at me. I had seen him before only just a few hours ago, but it still took me by surprise, he still took my surprise. "Harry, where are you going?"
Okay! We have plot! I repeat we have plot! The rest of the story should go smoothly and back up to the coherent update schedule of the fourth of every month.
I knew nothing of the time or even day of the week, but his mear presence had cut through all the fogginess and haze that had surrounded me. Naturally, I was still an outward vegetable, groggy and rather unresponsive orally as well as partly physically. But having Him nearby and simply hearing his voice was a solace I never would have thought possible. He spoke of Draco and their progress in getting to their destination, I forget where but he stressed on it being both important and draining. He mentioned a storm that had set them back a few hours but it was mostly unaffected. Knowing that they were all okay, had apparently made me physically relax and able to get better faster. He had played with my hair a bit before I felt his leaving and it was soon confirmed with the shut door.
Potions with Citrus was interesting, the professor -although everyone who said it made it sound like an insult- looked at her with fear in his dark oak eyes, he stuttered saying our names in the register. We were making a third-year potion. Enalie had explained that the teacher didn't know the O.W.L curriculum and that the headmaster had made no move to fire him, she had gone on to say that soon the school's remaining Owners will take matters into their own hands.
The Dark Lord had just two things in mind when he marked Draco Lucius Malfoy.
With regards to Lucius; he knew what Draco wanted more than paternal recognition, Draco wanted to out do his father, out rank him. Draco wanted it because he knew it would make his father more proud.
greeting "Happy birthday, from The Dark Lord." I smile and wave him off as he apparates and I shut the door.
After dinner and a bath, a shower for Draco, where he was given his extremely important privacy, we both settled into my bed, facing each other. I couldn't help but giggle, I had never slept next to someone in my entire memorable life, of course, I slept with my parents as a baby. Draco was smiling at me, almost protectively "You haven't done this before huh?"  I shook my head and he wrapped his arms around me.
I went to nod, and realised that he couldn't see me, pushing my head from the water, spitting out the mouthful I had, looking very much like a mermaid as I did so, "I'm fine, Sev honestly, I'll just be awhile..." I heard a soft chuckle and a sofa sink down, I smile at my small win, and sunk back down, only simply prolonging the inevitable. I pulled myself out around thirty minutes later, wrapped in a towel, head to toe.
"Miss Granger, Mr Weasley could you care to explain your tardiness?" Harry blinked in shock as I contained my laugher along with Pansy and Nott "Ten points each off Gryffindor, both of you will serve detention with me, tonight at eight, for now, go sit down."
How do you force a wizard or witch to learn non verbal and wandless Magic? You take away their hands and tongue.
His parents think I'm crazy, my friends' parents think I need extra care. I don't care what they think. I'm not crazy and I don't need extra care. Draco and Tom are all I need.
Andrew - 14
I woke up again before sunrise, using the time to get ready before Harry, I was out of our dorm by the time his alarm went off, not that he'd get up. I sat back on the chair I was using last night, waiting for anyone I knew to come down, I was waiting for a while I could tell.
Chapter two: June 21st >The point of view changes to Tom's as the possible new Concubines arrive Tom looks over them all, with the help of his advisors Luicus, Severus, Remus and Sirius. Tom only has to choose four, spotting Harry Tom grows curious and with the pleading of Remus and Sirius chooses Harry as one of them, placing him in the 4
"Good morning Harry." I mumble playing with his hair, we had a busy day that's all I could think of. "My sister is still at work, my parents will be up soon." I wanted to wish that everything could be resolved, we could all go back home, nothing could go wrong everything would be okay. That's not possible, day after day, night after night; trials and hearings are taking over Magical England trying to find everyone responsible for every single case of assault at Hogwarts. I'm lucky we got to leave.
Nevertheless, Harry Potter loved Draco with all his heart, they spent every waking moment with eachother. They could communicate by one language. Parsletonge. Afteral, who needs a tongue to hiss? Within a year they had announced a wedding date. The world seemed at peace with Voldemort's ideas at play but adapted to not be synonymous with genocide.
In the most simple way, I've grouped chapters together based on what day they occurred on or if they were important enough to stand alone, therefore cutting this story just under half (I do apologise for the monster long chapter 3, I'll shorten it if you guys want it split up a little). To explain the changes I've made in detail I'll summarise the new chapters. Feel free to comment any questions you might have!
The ding took me out of my thoughts, I slowly followed Draco into a wide open windowed room, with four desks and doors. A person in white robes with dark hair as talking quietly to a male in light grey robes, he was nodding frantically. Looking around I smiled, holding onto Draco's arm, they didn't seem to notice that we had arrived.
They didn't look pleased and they both looked angry, I looked between them as Lucius continued the drive the car to a shopping centre in London. "Harry, we're not angry at you, I promise." I nodded as we got out of the car, Draco and Lucius blinking and trying to breath
That's everything that's new and I hope it's all understandable! Chapter 11 should be up soon!
Draco stopped the car just in time so we didn't crash into our own parking space and look stupid.
That's the only part the public ever see.
Chapter eight: October 3rd to 4th > The end of mourning means that Draco and Lucius have to return to the Manor so Draco can get his lordship. Regulus turns up at last with Susan. Draco stops by Tom's palace where he's having a fight with the minister, Draco calms him down from it and they have another talk before Draco leaves after dinner. Late that night Draco, Lucius, Daffodil, Regulus and Susan in separate carriages while going to Wiltshire. The next morning Draco wakes up thanks to Luicus and they all have breakfast and the day goes on.
Enalie - 14
"You don't have to get us gifts, Harry, you know that right?" I nodded and held his hand. "I know, but I want to."
She's a royal concubine, meaning she belongs to one of the King's, more specifically, my uncle. I knew her by name only. Although I always called her Daffodil, I never grew out of it. I think some part of her hated it, her Palace is drawn in half by a river. She finds it cruel and unkind. She isn't as narcissistic as her name suggests. I walked towards them and she gently ran her hand through my hair, murmuring things to me. I never see much of her, because my uncle never calls her often, but I'm thankful for her presence. Now I have to look up to them, there isn't much else to do.
While Draco was icing our cake I got out the little small mini cupcake and walked it carefully over to the terrarium and placed it inside "
I felt impending doom and gulped
Harry bit his lip, almost chewing it as he fiddled with his robe sleeve, "Well it's just I always get the impression that we don't really get a choice in what happens, that we can't say no." he whispered, lightly rubbing his eyes as he looked up at me. I blinked once, then twice my mouth going slightly dry because in a way Harry was right but I didn't want to tell him that, it wouldn't be fair to tell Harry after Remus and Sirius had probably been trying to make Harry feel comfortable and safe here, and I didn't want to mess that up. "I mean, no one here really says no to anything, so I assumed we couldn't."
"However dispute that we still have the biggest amount of seats, plus your uncle had taken Ganut, Slytherin and newly gained Riddle seats." Neptune smiled, I hardly understood a word but they seemed happy. Which often meant that it was good for them and bad for Dumbledore.
"Well, my aunt and uncle say that I'm strange and not normal because I don't like girls." Draco looked back at me, as he doing up a tie, "What do you mean Harry? You're twelve, how?"
It keeps going until I walk downstairs. Draco and I live in a relatively small apartment in London, close to the Ministry; I get away from the Dursely's and Draco gets a small break away from the Death Eaters. Emphasis on small. We have a little snake here for a reason.
"Thank you for your help Severus." She then bids me farewell and leaves. I am left speechless, sitting at my desk in no mood to continue the work in front of me. Not when I've been graced with the time and company of a delicious appetising lady.
I shook my head, assuring him that I was fine "I figured that much, you did mumble in your sleep though." I sat up and almost ran after him. He laughed and kissed my forehead "Relax it's impossible to hear anything you say, unless you talk, or scream which you did neither of." I sighed and got dressed as Draco went into the bathroom to brush his hair.
I remember my night with him: easy, soft and calm. It was a genuine offer, simply letting me have somewhere warm and peaceful to sleep. Nothing of course happened, we slept and woke up as if it had been normal for us, when it wasn't, not at all. I found myself longing to be with him again, just for a night. But that would lead to another night, and another; then before I know it I have a wand at my neck for treason by the Emperess.
I, on the other hand, was silent and shook my head as Harry asked me about my life at home before it all fell apart. I wasn't being silent about it because of anything bad, heavens no. Rather that I never liked to share my experiences; even the Emperor didn't know much about my childhood and time at Hogwarts. I had been the first person to deny the Son of Magic knowledge, he took it less badly than my uncle had been expecting and all of us to be exact.  It took about three minutes before Harry stopped asking, realising that I wasn't going to say anything about them. I gave my sister an apology and of course a quick explanation, not unlike the one I just gave. It wasn't that nothing worthy of being mentioned happened, but rather I never spoke about my parents, they were precious to me and how I grew up. Everyone around me grew to learn this, even my uncle didn't know things me, things that I would of course share in due time. Still, I enjoyed the ride and going with Harry was especially lovely, we didn't need to talk, the silence that was the was comfortable and easy.
He walked up shyly and slowly, Remus smilied at him, givien him his wrapped gift and helping him out of the Hall an into his Palace. I dissmided the rest, they could have their dreams crushed and sent home. I have the four I want.
he looked up as I untied the ripped clothing and didn't attempt to sit up "Draco, I'm so sorry, if I hadn't taken so long-" He smiled softly at me "Harry, I know they would have been nothing you could have done, but watch, they made Pansy and Blaise watch when they tried, but they could have done worse.". I carefully picked him up and wrapped him in my cloak and he hissed in pain, I gently rubbed his back "Come on I'll carry you to the train okay?" Draco nodded, he wrists, ankles and neck red and bruised.
"She'd be a second Ron." I looked up to see who said that, with Draco immediately grabbed my arm, in something like fear.
"H-Hogwarts, in Professor Snape's rooms." l guess he heard my slight stutter. My face flushed and I looked up and prayed to whatever deity existed to mercy me. "Maybe, but that's not the point, Everett, the point is that-" I stopped, how do I remember his name? I only said it once, and I only heard it twice. "I need you to answer me, and soon, preferably within the next few days." He popped his lips and sighed. I nodded to what he said and said yes before we said goodbye and I hung up.
"I know, we don't have to follow it. I do however feel bad for Enlie and Theodora, they want their mother." I shook my head, yes I knew they did, so did Leviathan, but they had to deal with it. I also know that Leviathan can look up to Remus in a way.
Smiling, the rest of the meeting went well and he gave me a little box. I'll open it later, happily skipping out of his office and towards the car Draco's parents gave Draco, he lets me drive it though. We end up talking back home.
"Please, I have no other person to turn to." It was pleading, in such a pleasing way. I wanted to help her just from her calm, oceanic voice, so woven and complex. Plus there was something so voluptuous about hearing someone of her standing speak in such a desperate, longing manner. I readily agreed to assist my dear sister. I offered her a chair and tea, to which she said that she wanted nothing more than an orange. Internally I questioned if it would be enough for her, she's rather lithe and small regardless but an orange simply couldn't feed her. I, of course, had heard of stories where concubines would fast for the morning period, to pay their respects to the dead. I can't imagine her doing such a thing though, Lucius would never let her besides the practice is thousands of years outdated.
All they care about is the voice in the head. And why I can talk to books, lockets, and my pet snake. Yes, I have a pet snake, that I share with my boyfriend, who I live with.
Well, technically it's mine, but whatever. I don't dislike it here, but it doesn't feel completely comfortable.
I was shocked and surprised, I blinked and smiled. I knew what he was saying, I knew what he was asking and I found that I didn't mind, and I rather liked it when he wasn't being a twelve-year-old boy, in situations like these especially. I nodded and smiled at him, getting up and hugging him tightly "So you wouldn't mind if I called you my boyfriend?" I asked looking at him, he laughed and nodded "I don't mind the social label, if it's you." I gigged and let go of him, to sit back on the bed, before I knew I had been laid down and was asleep, only just hearing Draco's soft little murmur in my ear. Turning around I nuzzled into him.
"I missed you."
We left soon after and went to dinner, in which I ended up almost watching a Yule celebration, they offered to let me join in but I politely declined. Internally I was panicking about how I never bought them anything for Christmas, I didn't want to get anything tacky or anything that shows I tried too hard. I got out my Argos catalogue and a pack of post-it notes, I flicked through the jewellery and other things. I ran a hand through my hair and sighed. Noticing a cotton candy machine I smiled, remembering that Draco said that he loved cotton candy and that his father would too. But I wasn't going to just get them a sweet machine, I'm not that bad. I racked my brain for anything I could think of for ideas. I flicked past Pandora.  I heard them come out and quickly hid the book, taking note of the price before Draco's parents came out of the room.
Soon it will be too late for me to try to go to sleep, I'll probably be too tired to function properly today. Dear Lord I'm not having a wonderful day. Harry slowly shuffled on my shoulder mumbling slightly, I looked at him smiling slightly; about ten minutes later he properly wakes up smiling at me as he rubes his eyes "Morning Draco." I nod, morning indeed
Draco lifts some of the wood and smilies slightly "It's a thing we have to build." He pauses to look at my face, screaming 'obviously.' He laughs "I think it's for the balcony." I nod and we get to work on it, while a movie plays in the background.
The sounds around were calming and the view was peaceful as it could get. We were oblivious to the world outside, the starving poor, the broken adults, the destroyed children having their dreams for the future ripped out of the hands, leaving life long scars and self-hatred. No, we were safe, protected and enclosed like babies. We didn't have to worry about anything here, everything was taking care of for us. From food to having clean water and air. If we had good enough families, we would know how lucky we are, I know that some people here don't know that.
About two hours later, a soft hand was brushing back my hair "Is the sun up?" I asked faintly, rolling over to face Draco "Yes it is, good morning sleepy head." Draco said blowing air in my face I laughed and sat up, my glasses were carefully placed on my face and I blinked. Draco was wearing a light blue nightie thing with his hair falling out of the plat it was apparently in all night, his small lips were red and looked like they were glowing in the yellow light. "Harry, if you're done with looking at me, I'd recommend that you start to get dressed." I blushed and looked down before getting out of the bed and going through my trunk. "Umm Draco?" I mumbled, "I don't have any actual clothes, the ones I have used to belong to Dudly." He walked up to me and sat down "Harry, it's okay just wear your uniform, we're going shopping first anyway." I nodded and hugged him, he smiled and hugged me back "Come on, let's go."
Harry is most definitely sickly, Remus requested his attendance at lunch, more like he casually went up and asked. He drinks tea and can feel faint very quickly, his immune system isn't good and injections don't make it better. I'll wait till Draco returns and meets him before inviting him, once one of my kings have taken notice of a concoubine, I have to endow them. Thankfully we have the same tastes.
My suggestion was taken into immediate effect and we soon met with Daffodil and our two eunuchs. Breakfast was served and in no time at all were we back on our carriages to the last fifteen minutes of the journey.
He was silent as I came in. I was gently pulled next to him, he swept my night robe, or as the Emperor calls them costumes, off. I don't think I cuddled closer to anyone before. I don't know when but it was during the cricket's calls that I began to cry quietly. He rubbed my back comfortingly and didn't try to shush me. I knew that by morning the Emperor would call for the seventy-five days of mourning, which included everyone wearing white and not shaving facial hair. It was seventy-five days, not a hundred because we aren't part of the Imperial Family unless one of us bores the Emperor's first heir. My uncle was also silent, I have no doubt he was also upset, just maybe not as much as I was. This night was mostly sleepless and my pillow was wet with tears when we awoke to mourn bells being played loudly, over the City. Everyone would now know what fate had sentenced my parents to.
I smiled to myself and played with his long soft hair as his parents looked at each other before asking "Harry, we know our son, and we need to know, will you hurt him?" I tilted my head "How so?" I asked, his mother continued for Lucius "We know you'd never hurt him physically, there was a reason we asked him to stay close to you after all, but we meant emotionally, we know he won't do the same to do, at leat knowingly." They really care about their son "I won't I promise." They smiled and Draco woke up "Do you have to leave?" He pleaded they seemed to stop and sit next to him (Well us really) "Dragon, look if we wish we could stay, but we- well I can't, your mother can try but I can't." Draco's father said cupping Draco's cheek, looking at his crestfallen face, it was then that I realised just how much he loves them, he wants to stay with them and they want to stay with him, clearly. Gently I let go of him but held his hand.
"She's as good as a blind bat and you were warned by plenty of people that she would be a mistake." The Emperor smiled a little and beckoned me closer, making me yelp quietly as he pulled me onto his lap when I got close enough, chuckling as he saw my expression
We must have stayed still late since by the time Hermione gave me my large bowl of  oatmeal and fruits we could hear bugs "Is that dinner?" Draco asked, albite very confused and worried. To his relief shook my head. Hermione had also been making something for Draco as well it seemed as she came through with a plate of rice and beef. "Thank you."
Daffodil goes to Severus to help Lucius with his sleep movements and he gets more than he wanted in terms of seeing her for what she was. In a different part of the City Draco and Harry wake up after a nap and Draco gets Harry to drink water.
His face changed before speaking again "Stephaine, can I propose something to you?" I looked at him and nodded "My family and I need a maid for our son, he's the same age as you, in return for you accepting, we'll give you somewhere to live, food and clothing as well as send you to any school you wish to attend." I thought about it, I bit my lip and answered.
Neptune, is at work. So that's why I'm not actually going to see her, because I'm not walking into he office just to say I can't sleep; although that would be some kind of dedication. My parents are sleeping, but given that I'm eighteen; I can't go into their room because I can't sleep. I'm an adult!
I turned around, in my sleep, "Harry, for crying out loud wake up!" I could hardly hear them over the screams in my head,
Editing these are becoming painful, but I'll get through it.
"How did it go, the phone call I mean." I laned on the wall and sighed quietly. It didn't go badly, so to speak, I just couldn't find it in me to hear his reply. I wondered what to tell Harry. I did not want to lie, but I didn't want to tell the full truth either. I bit my lip and almost stopped myself at the feeling of unnatural smoothness. I shook my head, hoping Harry realised that I wanted him to drop it. "Draco, are you okay? You don't seem yourself, I mean granted your generally differ-"
Draco's phone buzzed and he quickly picked it up, and all colour drained from his already pale face. He said bye and hung up "It's Yule in three days," I blinked.
I nodded and smiled, Ron answering before I could open my mouth. "Hermione, Draco, wasn't the one to get hurt, it was his friend Blaise, Hogwarts might face a shut down if one more pureblood gets assaulted, we'd all get moved to Ilvermorny, we can't just brush it off." Hermione looked surprised and slightly offended more at Ron.
"I think you should listen to my grandmother, Marcus Banks." Do I have to explain? I think I just found my new favourite male adult that isn't my father. This dark-haired man knew how to use his voice well, to threaten although he doesn't seem like the dangerous type, maybe he's territorial over what's his?
I asked Mother where Father had gone, I couldn't find him anywhere, she told me that the portrait had asked him to follow her as she wanted to speak to him alone. That would be useful information if I knew the castle. Luckily I had bumped into Leviathan and asked where a room that could be used for privet conversation would be. He took me to the Headmaster's office.
"Hello, good morning!" I jumped slightly, hearing Draco's small chuckle from above me. "I am Auror Little, welcome Auror Unit 4 DE.C.M." We all nodded, it didn't take a genius to figure out what that stood for Death Eater Control and Management. "Just behind me is Auror Poppy, she's head of our Unit. We also have Auror Ryan and our Head Auror, Auror Neptune, she's currently at lunch break."
"I wanted to," I whispered in Lucius' ear, causing him to jump slightly and turn around to face me, grinning like a cat. He had obviously forgotten that he asked me a question about my hair. Lucius scowled a little at me but shook his head, I couldn't tell what he was annoyed by exactly. So to avoid making him have an outburst I left him to keep eating his lunch. Leaning towards Daffodil when she kept lightly messing with my hair to make it look neater as she mumbled, smiling happily the whole time until she finally stopped. Opposite us I heard Harry giggle to himself, watching me get fussed with, I sent him a playful glare that he stuck his the tip of his tongue out in reply.
I smiled, dazed as he pulled away from our intense kiss, leaving me with bruised lips and an attacked tongue. My hooded eyes looked at him, licking my lips and moving a tad against his arm. He let me go and I simply leaned into Lucius. "Are you alright Draco?" Yet his voice reminded the same soft and caringness it always had with me. I liked that he always cared, always asked; it made me trust him more. Despite the assault on his throat just a few moments ago. I nodded silently and let him sit me on his lap, he knew that for an hour or so I would let him move me around like a ragdoll. Lucius smiled and kissed my cheek. Running a hand through my hair "Good, was that a nice wake-up call?"
Naturally, you would think that as soon as I was given the task of leading a segment of the Court I would rush to tell my uncle and aunt? That is exactly what I didn't do, so Lucius had no idea. "Thank you, for telling us, I'll deal with this." my uncle turned to me surprised with a raised eyebrow, I only smile and kiss his cheek. Our eunuch rests against me and sighs relieved that they are safe. "Go back to your room and sleep, we won't call on you for the remainder of the day," I said softly sending them off with a light push.
"Harry, I'm okay as I could be, Draco I don't know about." I nodded and sat down on a small sofa, by Draco's hand he laughed and patted my head, I nuzzled his hand and gently bit his finger.
I looked at Draco's pure white face from Gryffindor table, on the other side of the hall, sighing I held my head up with my fist "Why and how would anyone hurt him?" I muttered under my breath, getting a few odd looks from my friends. I continued to (hopefully) subtly look at Draco, He looked up, his glazed light sapphire wide eyes, and blinked at me I smiled and waved at him, he blinked again waited and smiled. The sun catching his porcelain skin and eyes
Every morning I get woken, not by eunuchs but by my uncle's bath being run. I get lime tea to drink before my day officially starts. There have been times where I have been late to breakfast; such an offense would call for my disgrace but the Emperor always lets it slide, simply asking it not to happen often. I sit next to my uncle and his friend, I had never met him before coming here. At first, he scared me; he still does. I kindly begged that he be kept away from me. Everything about him makes my skin cold.
I ran and beat my small weak hands on the heavy door screaming to let me out, wishing for anyone to listen and unlock the door. Screaming for what seemed like hours, my throat felt horse and dry, my arms were tired and ached. I knew that it wasn't smart but I was scared. I heard the sound of footsteps faintly.
The driver had moved towards a back gate and pressed a button "That's a buzzer, it links up to the phone up above." I explained quietly to Draco, as we drove through the open agate and got let out. I helped Draco down from the step, and out of the car.
She laughed, turning her eyes towards her impermeable stone-faced parents. Honestly, do Lucius and Narcissa ever show complete emotion? "I hate to talk about it but how is the Ministry? Given the political war going in between England and MACUSA, obviously." Lucius sighed and looked years older within seconds, while her mother just sighed.
I could hear his shallow breathing next to me. I held back tears I couldn't cry now, not when he hadn't slept in weeks, worried about me. I have made the decision myself, not telling him or them. He wasn't angry with me he was just very scared, of the future, for me and him. Tomorrow would be the day that he'd never heard my voice again, after midnight. It had only been ten years, he was only a child, really.
"What brought that on?" I looked at him, blinking I wanted to tell him everything, tell him how worried and broken I felt, how destroyed he made me feel at breakfast. But he was a child, he wouldn't understand, saying things like that is normal for him, for them. I was honestly sorry for what I said, I knew it was wrong, but that's children do, they bully, they break each other, they hate each other, they are the perfect example of tyranny.
I'm sorry this is like a month or two late, I was trying to add to it but I have to accept that this is a short chapter basically about Harry and him being ill, Tom's here as well. I will be back to normal in Chapter 20 I promise!
His voice was still a bit harsh and raw, but you could hear the difference, it was softer, and seemed younger. I blinked and let go of the door handle "I-I just came to get a book from my trunk..." I didn't know whether I was in trouble or not, I had just came into his room, while he was resting. Draco beckoned for me to come closer if I was afraid I didn't know and didn't care.
I awoke with a jolt and something like a shriek "Harry, what's wrong?" I held onto Draco's shirt and took deep breaths
Envy - 16
Our breakfast was severed warm and with great penance. We were given tea with biscuits as well as a wonderful nutritious elven soup. It was rather bland in favour but it was stable enough with aromas and feelings that it filled us up. The tea itself was lemon with a hint of ginger. Prayers were done in silence and were completed in short of twenty minutes, after thanking the temple workers and keepers for allowing our stay and for feeding us, we're back in our carriages to continue on our journey, this time Daffodil did join us and sat next to me. Now is the time to point out that I am either in the middle, on one of their laps or simply observing them. We are never too far away from each other.
I opened my eyes to see sapphire in my centre vision, blinking I froze and reached out my hand "OW! Don't poke me, Harry!" I sat up as Draco held his left eye with his hand and cried. I instantly cradled him "I'm sorry I didn't realise it was you!" I said in hysteria,
Lust - 16
Slowly I heaved open the heavy barrier band stepped inside, the portrait's face softened and looked pitiful. "Father, I finally found you." I speed-walked towards him an got picked up in one motion, my eyes sparkled with glee as I rested my head over my father's heart.
I was right! Sitting in Chemistry, I was whispering with Andrew, he explained how his sisters Envy and Lust had dropped Potions in their first year, apparently, the teacher was afraid of them and wasn't very good, he had only just dropped the class, for their sake I hoped Severus understood.
"I guess I forgot to tell you, the girl is called Aliette Malfoy-Slytherin, and her brother is called Cygnus Malfoy-Slytherin with a few middles names added, Tom didn't actually do anything to me." I nodded and laid my head on a pillow.
"Do you want your wand after this?" Draco nodded, his mouth still open.
"What's wrong with him? Other than the obvious of course." Lucius had lost his elder brother, a role model, the only person who was there for him when their father died of dragon pox. Of course, he was going to be upset and shaken. She lifted up her head and licked her small, plump lips.
Imperial life here is full of betrayal and power. I am weary of even my closest friends; for they could turn their backs on me just as quickly as I could to them. It's worse the higher you are, I see fights of the tongue play out over meals and times between the Emperor and his Kings, I am the only one unscathed. But daily my food and drink are tested, I go out with guards. Anyone below me could be a threat.
"Well technically since my family's older you'd have to take my name, and either lose your name entirely or hyphen it." I paused and looked at him, did I want that? Did I honestly want that, to lose my entire identity, the only thing my parents ever gave me? I hadn't even registered that Draco had wrapped his arms around me.
He was due to wake up in a few hours, the sun had risen "Morning sleepy-head" I said softly, he smiled painfully, he didn't want this, I knew that I knew that he didn't want to be alone with them. But I couldn't live without my parents, I knew it seems selfish and rude, but Harry understood that much. I hated not giving him a choice like I had done any other time.
"Draco?" His voice was sleepy and slow, it made me smile and press a kiss to his forehead "What were you doing?" I shake my head as he opens his eyes and rubs at them, sitting up in bed, looking at me. I leaned against him with a small smile. Telling him that it was nothing to concern himself with and that everything was okay. He doesn't seem to believe me but holds me close anyway as if I'm seconds away from crying again.  Which to clear the record I am not.
It was cold but dry. Something Draco would be forever thankful for; he could however think of much more comfortable ways to go about this.  "My Lord?" He asked softly turning his head to face him, strapped to a table with his hands immobilised. The knife glistened in the firelight, instinctively Draco tried to move his hands.
"Will your uncle like it? Or agree with it?" Harry asked, leaning against me even more, cuddling into me when I wrapped an arm around him. If I was being honest I didn't know, he didn't seem very pleased at lunch, but lunch wasn't normal today, not with Bella around on show. "Can he even tell you what to do?" Harry asked curiously; it appears I may have awakened the childlike tendency to continue asking questions no matter what which wasn't on bad on paper.
"Harry, is something wrong?" I shook my head and sat down on the bed. Still holding the book I waited. I would be lying if I said that I didn't know what to do around Draco, he was the same person, but he wasn't at the same time.
Draco ended up choosing McDondals after he realised that I had never been at least that's what he told his father. He seemed to believe the lie, but sat down reluctantly anyway, although when Draco got the food, Lucius relaxed after seeing my joyful face. It took a while for all of us to leave, mainly because I was eating so slowly but we did eventually get back in the car, I sat one Draco's lap again as he leaned his head on the window, for some reason he was nervous, about something, I fell asleep before I could find out why "Draco, it's normal to be nervous, or even afraid, but I, your mother, Bella and Severus will be there, you're not going to alone, I know you trust him, try to see Marvolo as the uncle you know him as, you should be fine." Draco smiled and thanked his father.
I woke up to the feeling of someone looking at me, I opened my eyes and screamed. Trying to get away from the bony, elf-like creature that was looking at me, unblinking. Within seconds three people are in the room, as I'm huddled with the duvet, reciting very prayer I know, hoping that thing would go away. "Stephaine what's wrong?" my eyes snaped open "Is it gone?" I ask immediately, when I got a nod in return I actually looked at them, Lucius was tall with long blonde hair, wearing mostly black, the woman beside him has long wavy black hair that was tied back and was wearing a light green dress, while a boy, about my age, was standing between them, wearing a pale dress, with his hair obstructing part of his face, probably wondering who on earth I am. "Draco, stay with her, don't ask questions that are intrusive." Is what i heard Lucius say.
"Whose Scabbers?" Lucius asked, probably knowing what I could have dreamed about "Ron's pet rat." I answered, when Draco laid his hand on my forehead, I sighed and laid on his chest I could have sworn I'd felt that kind of calming magic once before, maybe as a baby, as we drove on, we could see the Manor now "Draco you don't have to do that, you don't have to put yourself through using that magic. I'm glad you gave them to your aunt and uncle, and you can still see them, and they at least know who their father is, and they still have a room in the Manor, besides they are there here, with them, but you don't have to use magic that you gained from them, if you don't want to."
I hadn't seen Harry all day apart from lessons, which didn't count, in my opinion, Pansy and Theo had decided to stay with me, not understanding Harry's strange behaviour. He was asked to make sure I was okay, I'm mean I'm sure he didn't want to but he still said that he would. At the least, he could have some sort of motion of him
"What part of Do. Not. Go. Anywhere. Near. My Uncle's. Potions. Store. DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?" Our previous teacher (I hadn't learned his name) was yelling with a grave calmness to his voice, his dark snakewood wand pointed at the Potions teachers throat. "I never wanted you here, you are a completely unfit, uneducated and utterly useless adult. I've seen ten-year-olds who know the curriculum better than you and they don't study it." His calm anger remained me of The Dark Lord, he never raised his voice in rage, his yell was icy, sharp and ruthless.
My doctor doesn't think it hurts me too unless I fall on something hard, but that's why our house is carpeted, also, Draco likes not wearing shoes inside and feeling comfy.
Just minutes later I was sat in the bathroom with her, my uncle having to go do something for Tom, which gave us the perfect chance to surprise him. Daffodil smiled as she explained what she would do once I told her I just wanted my hair short, slightly to the side and with a little bit of a curl. Although she did braid my hair into many small plats and cut that off first, apparently to keep and maybe I want to use them once, to decorate my hair with. I don't really get it but didn't question her. We ended up being in the bathroom for a very a long time, laughing and sharing stories about Lucius Regulus, which made her washing my cut hair and making the back of it roughly even, but I didn't mind too much to be fair, it would grow back anyway. She used magic to get rid of any small hairs that would irritate my back before focusing on making it stay the way I wanted it to and have it naturally fall that way, towards the left with the part slightly towards the right but it more or less looked even. When we were done, near to lunch she smiled happily and finally showed me a mirror, grinning when I smiled happily giving her a hug "It's amazing!! I love it!" Daffodil kissed my head and let me run off to get changed so we could go to lunch.
I smiled and Snape came in "I'm glad to see you two are close, I hope it won't change much in the near future. Also, your parents will be coming in five minutes, they will want an explanation for what happened." Before leaving us alone. "Harry, can you let go for a bit?" I nodded and he mover over to a bookshelf and took out a random black book, as soon as he sat down , I saw that it's wasn't a ramdom black book it was 'Fascini scuro e malediziari' or the more adult title (version) (which was what he had) 'Enciolopedia di Tenebrae Magicae (Della ment magicae al peggair sangue magicae)' I gulped softly. That's when his parents come in through the floo "Mother! Father, I missed you!"
When I opened the door and stepped on the grass I saw Narcissa sitting on a chair, I stopped mid-step as she turned around, I wasn't going to lie, she scared me. "Oh hello Stephine, I was actually wondering if I could ask you few questions, just to get to know you?" I swallowed and nodded, holding my arm behind my back before walking towards the table and sitting down in front of her.
"Sorry if I seem rude, I'm not used to other children here, my family aren't well liked my many." I looked at him and nodded "I didn't think you were rude at all, anyway." He smiled and got up "You got a few rather big things sent to you, I'll leave so you can get dressed." He said before walking out of the room and standing by the wall as I got into a simple while the top and black skirt with white tights and red shoes.
2. Make Lucius jealous
My younger sister relaxed and at peace as we were travelling together down the Royal River, by boat of course. Harry was talking about all the times Remus and Sirius came to visit and take him out for a day, getting him away from his ghastly relatives. I was told that when Harry was five Sirius picked him up from his cousin's house on his motorcycle (I had seen it before, it's deep cherry red gloss being visual from our bedroom door) along with Remus, they had caused his uncle to faint over their apparent 'gayness' whatever that means, (I don't care what the other Elite do with each other, as long as they don't bother me too much). As well as that Harry delightfully told that when Harry had come down being ill and sickly they had removed him from their 'care' for almost a year so that Harry could hopefully recover. If i'm being honest, I can't help but smile at his stories he sounded so alive and real; it was refreshing, his eyes shined like gold dust, forever beautiful. Naturally, I couldn't tell Harry that, he would never forgive him for thinking such a thing. I listened to Harry with a genuine real interest.
Sitting down on one of the beds I waited as Draco slowly walked around the room before sitting on the bed opposite me, "Harry, you remember how in the holidays I went to tell you something but said that I'd tell you at school?" I nodded, of course, I remembered, it was after I'd met his 'cousins'.
Slowly we leave the dense cities and move towards land I know. Grass and trees, fresh air, and clear starry skies. I have missed it more than I realised, it's been years since I slept on my own bed. I thank the driver, giving him 300 galleons for his troubles. Stepping off of the carriage I breathed a small sigh.
We were sitting waiting for the gate to open. So we could board our flight. 15/16 hours in a plane. They had gotten first class of course. "My sister's an Auror, she's one of the best and youngest." I smiled, I knew that Draco wanted to be a healer. But he was immensely proud of her, just from the tone of his voice.
"Tom will be angered Draco, you know that." I had not the need to turn around and see my uncle's face. I already knew his sour expression off by heart. But I am no girl. He doesn't dictate my decisions, Lucius never has. Neither does my husband, and I damm well wouldn't let him
Draco was nervous and afraid of all this new stuff. I had tried my best to calm him, by telling him that it was interesting to watch the sky and imagine that we're playing Quidditch. It helped him a bit. His parents were not doing much better, his mother was gently rubbing his father's hand and arm, whispering things into his ears.
I smile and nodded "The best wake up call I have ever received uncle, thank you." My smile projected innocence, a childish disposition. But I wasn't lying, it was the best I had been given, the call of the peacocks was nothing like what my uncle's mouth
I am cruel. I am rude. I am broken. I am unsatisfactory. I am meek. I am submissive. I am docile. Shaking off the string of adjectives I could use describe me, I wound my way through the castle walls trying to find Harry before class starts, not that Transfiguration would be that difficult to get to on my own, I'd just rather not go alone. Bad things happen when I'm alone.
After breakfast I asked if I could stay outside for awhile, I spent the hour or so just laying on the soft grass, I couldn't see any bugs, flies, or any garden animals anywhere, I couldn't even see ants! Staring up at the clouds I smiled, until I felt someone walk behind me, sitting up and turned around to see Lucius, he smiled maybe he was looking for me? "Stephaine, could you follow me, you can come back outside after." I got up, went to brush off grass off my skirt to see none "My wife, Narcissa didn't like getting grass on her, and still doesn't, and my family never liked incests, the most you'll see here are bees." I nodded and followed him into a lit room, with candles that emit blue and green flames "Copper and Barium." I mumbled under my breath as I looked around "Excuse me?" I looked at him and shook my head "I was just mumbling about the flame colours."
"Can you show us, Grandfather, please?" another female voice asked, the curtains were pulled back, gearing light poured into my container. Although it wasn't me, it was a shell of me. I was really buried with my parents, I demanded it.
"Just a pureblood? What about anyone else? Or the fact that it's just Slytherins?" I bit into my lunch and sighed, letting Ron do the talking,
When dinner was over I found myself staring up at the night sky, worrying for once not about myself or the events in a short few hours; I was worried about Harry, but not in a sense of his health and state of mind were making me panic, rather I was worried about how he would cope with Remus' change. It was never something we spoke about since it was rude to speak about one the Elite when they weren't there, and I had seen some of the punishments they gave for such a thing. Even Harry and I being Imperial concubines did almost nothing in terms of protection.
"Just to double check, we have Lucius Malfoy, Severus Snape, Remus Lupin, Minver McGonagall." I nodded and set the papers down on my desk. For now, there was nothing to do, we didn't have any attack to be aware of, no one to really be the lookout for. Everything was normal, so naturally, Jack went back to his department, as me Allison moved to our respective desks "Your following Severus, I'll take Malfoy, and Auror Tonks will watch Lupin."
I was hiding from the storm; hail, rain, wind, thunder, lighting, ice. I was so close to death going outside would be suicide, my friends couldn't help, we were just ten. I heard someone come in, probably to get away from the storm. They found me.
A genuine smile spread across her face, "Lucius allowed me to wear it, it was a gift from his sister in law to me, I never wore it, however." She had another one, but she wouldn't wear that without Tom's permission. "So where is the Emperor?"
She led us inside toward a warm living room, I followed Draco and sat beside him on the white leather sofa. Neptune had eagerly sat between her parents and brother. "What exactly did I miss during the past 22 years?" Draco was leaned against her waist.
The Emperor made no move to stop them, simply watching over us while we all ate, after all, there was no reason for him to actually talk to us. But surely this amounted to some kind of bullying? Maybe if it continued he would intervene. But his eyes were on Draco and me alone, he flicked between us every of often. It was to creep me out. I glanced at him as he smiled at me, trying to be courageous I shook my head at him and Draco sent me a comforting glance. Emperor Riddle nodded and looked away from me. Whatever happened, I was thankful for, I didn't like him looking at me like that. I could continue breakfast in relative pleasure.
Leviathan - 22
New Timeline:
His voice snaps me from my thoughts "Yes, I do, almost every night, expect when he has Daffodil around." Harry would obviously mean sleep as in lying together, curling up, sleeping. Wouldn't he? I was vague in my answer just in case he did.
"Hey, Draco, do you know how your uncle feels about me?" I asked, Draco smiled and sat up, cupping my cheek.
Weasel's threats that McGonagall shut down and took off more points, "Do you think that Professor McGonagall will contact Granger's parents?" I whispered to my friends as we were doing practical work.
"Mr Potter, could I have a word, without your friends." I turned around to see Professor Snape standing in front of the 'Golden Trio' rolling my eyes at the absurd name I focused on what they were talking about.
I waited for Draco to come back from wherever he was in this manner, I didn't have to wait very long, as he came in mumbling about his arm begin in pain "Draco, are you alright?" I asked as he sat on the sofa and held his arm, he looked at me and with a laugh.
"Harry, what are you talking about, just get what you need or want and we'll pay for it, money isn't a problem for us, honestly." With that, he patted my head and let me go back to wherever I was. When I found my way back to Draco and his father, it was with a relatively full mesh bag/basket, Draco smiled and took the basket from me, while Lucius stood behind him, "Harry are you sure you don't want anything else?" I looked at him.
I started to laugh at his impatient looks "Right before lunch, Daffodil cut it for me. I had been thinking about it for a few weeks or so by now, do you like it?" I asked teasingly as Harry nodded, "Of course it's allowed, just not many concubines do it." We sat down by the bank as Harry seemed deep in thought, he leaned towards me and placed his head on my shoulder. I bit my lip, looking at Harry with a light blush "Everything okay?" Harry smiled at me and nodded, grinning almost.
Moving on, with everything Harry looks at me pleasingly; something about that look makes me want to do something for him.
Turning around I saw anger flash in bright green eyes.
My hands shake, my skin is warm, I take a deep breath. Arms wrap around me, soft pale lips whispering against my neck. It's all too much. I lean against the solid rock of my uncle's chest, gathering up my sole courage. "Keep him away." I felt him nod and he lightly kissed my cheek. No question as to who I meant, no question as to why. It was simply made. While we were talking a well-dressed man came up towards me, about 1.69cm in height. My uncle immediately reacted away from me and I almost fell, if not for the stage I was practically displayed on. "We meet again I see." I smile at the older man, nodding my head. Daffodil's eunuch was always my favourite. He quickly took my measurements and nodded sharply. "Do you want what we agreed on last week or something more, fitting?" He said, making a strange waving hand movement, clearly, he had the same opinion as me on what was brought out last week.
It was dark brown, with stacks of paper towards one end, a lamp was turned off turned at the keyboard. There were a few boxes on either side, I couldn't read them the labels were facing the chair. Talking of the chair, a thick black cloak rest on it, I could hear Lucius gasped quietly upon I assume seeing it; although I don't know why it would have any significance for him.
"Are you alright? Draco?" She asked, holding out her hand, Draco moved his away, other Slytherins were still, and silent waiting to interfere if needed. "...I.." No sound came out of his mouth, he closed it and looked down, the older year stood up and walked around to stand next to Draco, "Draco, are you alright?" He flinched and looked up at her, "Draco?" She softly placed a hand over his, and did something to his magic, sighing he lifted up his head "Draco, you can't keep doing it, what he did was unforgivable, now please answer my question, are you alright?" He shook his head, and his hair covered his eyes.
I rocked Draco in my lap as his sobs subsided and he slowly moved his hand and ran into the bathroom, then came straight out with a black eye patch with a lily petal on it. I continued carefully as Draco was still sniffling, "Hey Draco, I was thinking about what you said yearstday." He turned and looked at me "Okay, he says carefully." I smile before continuing "You sounded like you'd seen what you were talking about, I was just wondering. What did you see or hear, if anything?" Draco looked perfectly fine with the question and answered calmly "Oh, well a small thing that not many people know about me is that I'm older than the average second year. I should be in my sixth year but my parents with my person did a ritual that made me look younger than I am, so I saw every single Death Eater meeting, I've seen and watched the murder of hundreds of muggles and 'blood traitor's' that I could." I blinked and sat on the bed, Draco sat down next to me
"I'll be talking to Miniver after this." Draco stopped him "Sev! It wasn't her fault, I turned around and cut my cheek on a knife." He explained, holding onto Snape's robe, as he led him into the bathroom, while I was left outside in his office. They came out five minutes later with Draco looking calm and happy, despite the bandage around his face "He says your in trouble for poking me." I groaned and knocked my head back "I never meant to hurt you though." I asked as he snuggled himself on my lap. "I know you didn't." I nodded and I slolwy though about how to ask my question "Draco, you don't have to answer but what are you?" Draco opened his mouth, then closed it, then opened it again and repeated the sequence twice before finally answering "I'm a GlassDoll, Harry, my father blames himself, but it's what I am, and it can't be helped." I looked at him with soft eyes "People are just too careless with me." This explains everything! He gasped as I wrapped my arms around him "Harry? What are you doing?" I kept him as close to me as I possibly could and said: "Never letting you go." I felt him smile and loosened my grip just a bit. "I'm fine with it."
I can't remember what I did to be placed in the attic, but I know that it'll be last time I'm left with my grandparents alone again, father and mother will make sure of it, that I know. Other than that all I know is that I have somehow 'disdained my family house' through a bout of accidental magic, not that I knew what I was doing. Mother and father never punish me for anything I do with magic, except when I harshly shoved my father away from me a few weeks ago on my fourth birthday.
"Either way, Jack I want you inside, my father might not like you, but you don't have to make yourself known. Allison, you can decide where you'll stay here or stay within the wards. I'll be at Ilvernmory following their tails." It seemed we were at an agreement. With that at least.
Apparently, I'd taken longer than I should have done, as when I came into mine and Draco's dormitory, he was curled into a tight ball, bleeding with a piece of something over his eyes. "Please let it be over, please let them have left, please." Gently I sat on the bed, "Draco, it's me Harry, you're safe." I said brushing back his hair, that seemed to have blood running through it.
She screamed as she felt a knife cut and mark her skin, she bubbled and begged for mercy, she bled out over the floor and the pain returned again on her other arm. She had two words cut into her skin. What they were she had no idea, bur death would be sweet and this pain was eternal.  The only reason Daffodil was so good at this was purely that this was the sort of play her and Lucius sometimes did together, although it was never really like this, his whips were made of leather or cotton, not twigs found outside, she was never chained, but rather held still with soft silk. And Lucius would never physically harm her, and she wouldn't do the same to him.
Draco is supposed to be back next month, he hasn't sent anything to me and Lucius says that he had been asked to not mention anything to me. Which I can expect, I'm not direct family to them. Although do wish the best of them, it would be difficult for Draco if they died, I would offer as much support to him and Lucius as possible.
This is simply a note explaining all the changes, along with the timeline I decided to arrange, All the changes/timeline construction happened in December 2020, if you're reading after December 29th 2020 then you can ignore this note as it won't apply, you can read on as usual.
Last year I sent someone a wrapped box with a green bow. Inside was a selection of chocolate and snake things I had found. I received back an oddly toned letter to expect similar for my birthday, it was unsigned but I could tell his handwriting anywhere.
It was that sweet deep sound of his completion, hearing my on name groaned like a curse as he came into his underwear and robes, that sent to me cum down his windpipe. verbally could give no warning but he pushed away to swallow everything I was mercilessly forcing him to swallow. His gagging almost made me hard once again. I certainly wasn't the longest of males, but I knew for a fact that I had the thickest cock out of them if I was included with the Emperor and his Elite.
Lucius held my hand to help me get down, I gladly jumped down into his arms, he lightly spun me around and kissed my cheek before placing me down on the floor. Daffodil smiled she shooed Reg and Susan off to walk towards us "How do you feel darling?" She asked, kneeling beside me again, gently running her hand through my hair, let me think about my answer and lean into her as Lucius kept a hand on my back treasure me that everything was okay. I ended up shrugging, licking my lips.
"So basically I gave the Dark Lord a gift for his birthday last year and he said to expect the same thing," I explain shrugging my shoulders as I notice a bunch of wood, glue, nails and a hammer, along with the same type of chocolate as I sent him.
I was being gently shaken awake by my mother and father, both looking worriedly down at me. I smiled weakly at them.
"What will you do with my wand? And will it be quick?" Draco asked, he wasn't scared, no now it was too late to be scared. He wasn't getting off the table untill his hands had been butched from his arms, and his tongue cut. "What about my ring?"
"Draco, really? You were never one for modesty, you know I'd never harm you." I nodded and smiled as he rose from sitting down, to pat my head and pull me into a soft, hug. "Keep your eyes open, as much as you can, I don't want to hurt you." I relaxed in his arms and nodded "Severus, I'm cold and I know this is going hurt me anyway, I'll be blind for half an hour at least." It was a lie, but it felt comforting nonetheless a soft white lie. I felt a kiss to my forehead, I sat and laid on his soft plush mattress.
could do.
Then the whole school decides to call Harry as Slytherin's heir because he spoke a snake! Dear Merlin, it wasn't my fault that he spoke to it, he probably didn't even know what he was doing. But our Duel made it very clear that Harry was still very angry with me, I did as we were told, it's what I'm used to doing, yet Harry decides to fire a spell, what else was I to do. I couldn't break in font of everyone, and I certainly don't want to do it in font of Harry, Granger or Weasel. All three of them enjoy doing it again and again just to see it wound me.
I looked up at a girl with waist length hair that was held up by a black headband, it was the same colour as Lucius and Draco's. She was wearing white coloured robes, with the Ministry coat of arms embroidered on her jacket. Her ice blue eyes looked soft as she descended the short stairs towards her family. I backed away, the last thing I wanted was to be the third wheel.
A few months after that night Draco had cancelled one of his rewards, it would make little difference, so he didn't think it mattered a whole lot. Harry didn't care. He liked Draco regardless of anything.
There were a few others, a girl of similar age, they all were, she had black hair and brown eyes, Pansy, I think that was her name. I care little about their first names. They are all at least sixteen, maybe seventeen.
"Draco...Could I see it?" I asked the first question that was on my mind, it was probably utterly stupid, but I wanted to know. "Okay, sure just don't touch it, please." I nodded as he lifted up his sleeve on his left arm, I blinked and stared, I was pretty sure that by now I had memorised the Dark Mark, I looked back up at him before he realised what I was looking at before he came in, "Harry, I'm assuming you've already worked it out." I nodded and sat closer to him, "They stay with my aunt and uncle while I'm at school, Harry, you can see them if you want, I'm going downstairs anyway." I got up and followed him down to the lobby, where two small children were climbing on teddy bears, massive teddy bears.
I knew that Daffodil was with us, although she was in the carriage behind us. They would like to believe that it's because she didn't want to impose on us; however, I know that it's Lucius made her stay in her carriage, ordered her to. Just the way she likes. I had known since meeting Daffodil that she liked being told what to do and she liked making people happy, this, of course, had its boundaries. But mainly she liked being told what and how to do things. If it wasn't obvious enough in public it was made more obvious, and probably harsher when the moon rose above our palace. I had a second bedroom of course, but rather I was mere, separated from the two if the need arisen, which meant that no matter what silence charms they placed, I could still see them. See how her body arched into his with breathless moans and pleads, how her nails dug into his back or silken ropes. How with one whispered command she'd bend and go limp. I had also learned that she did indeed look pulchritudinous being taken from behind in her sleep, she certainly enjoyed having Lucius' cock slip in and out of her as she slept bringing her to quiet orgasm. Everything about her seemed to become younger when she slept. Why they would bother keeping that from me was a complete mystery, one that I fully intended to learn about by the end of this year. Which was fast approaching as we had passed Harry's birthday a few weeks ago? I fact I learned from seeing Remus handle a plant so lovingly by the Hall of Complete Harmony.
"I used to go to Ilvenmorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, they had a muggle counterpart, as America had no Statute of Secretary as MACUSA realised how useful muggles knowing the magical community was, although not everyone liked the idea, it wa s erased after Britain's Wizarding War, the muggles that go, mostly learn theory and how magic is actually used along with our normal muggle education. It's mainly hidden by a cloud, although some of the students can't see it, I can as well as every other Magical school there is, I'm sure, the only girl I liked was Georgina Parkinson, she was the only one that was down-to-earth, and Matthew Patrick and Nathan Smith, Jason and Chris are two muggle boys, when we all met, we all made friends quickly, I was about to start my 'first year' as my birthday was two weeks ago, doctor."
I could hear my father's voice from the door, smiling brightly to myself, I knocked on the old willow door, the sound of clothes turning made my breath halt "Enter." Came to a soft yet impatient command, I didn't like it one bit.
I was greeted with a medium-sized wrapped box with a red bow, "Potter." I look up at the person and smile politely I take the box from him as he nods
Dinner was quick and easy for us, we were given a bowl of noddle soup with goblin made wine. Which they forbid me from having a few sips of, (they being both the staff and the adults around me) although even Regulus was denied more than a glass of the wine.
"Her name's Stephaine Cordato, she's the same age as Draco, I'll explain the rest later." He said placing me down on the sofa, I wasn't by any means small for my age, but just very ill. He soon returned to take me to my room, I told him I felt fine to walk, surprisingly I manged to walk up to the third floor. I remember begin told to sleep and that I could have something to eat once I woke up before I fell into a subconscious state of sleep.
"Is this a Malfoy Estate?" I asked dumbly, of course, it was, why would Draco's sister live elsewhere? Draco gently brushed my arm, also looking up at the Manor from the window of the taxi. We were about a mile away but the space around us was bare and green, it was easily visible.
"Blaise! Please tell me your okay?" She asked almost breaking the curtain.
I looked at Harry, thinking of some way to prove Harry wrong that wasn't just me talking to him, "Come with me." I stood up offering Harry my hand "I want to show you, someone." Harry looked at me curiously but grabbed my hand anyway, letting me lead him away.
That was all that mattered.
Quickly eloping Draco in a tight hug, she muttered something into his ear before turning her gaze onto her parents "Mama, papa!" She jumped up, resting her head on their shoulders. As they carefully looked her over and exchanged words and light kisses, Draco not far behind. "Merlin I missed you so much, especially you baby brother." Draco blushed as she bumped his nose. "You must be Harry, my brother's told me all about you in his letters, I'm Neptune. " I glanced at Draco who was busy looking at flowers.
Picking up the book he shuffled around until his head was in the crook of my neck and his parents looked fondly at us. "Harry, has Draco asked you about staying with us for the holidays?" His parents asked at the same time, I smiled tightly and nodded "Yes he has, I said that I wouldn't mind going."
We have no Empress; I have lived here since my sixteenth. I am a concubine of the second Imperial rank. I requested to stay with my uncle; to make myself seem less of a threat, it's working. The Emperor views me as a favourite among the others. That could be because of my uncle, for reasons I do not wish to document.
"Nothing much, honestly I mean I'd rather you hadn't left." She pulled him closer and patted his head. "I told you pretty much everything in my last letter." Neptune smiled genuinely and ran a finger down Draco's face, tapping his cheek lightly with her nail. "Yeah, don't ask."He said sheepishly.
." I smile and nod gently closing the door and taking a slice of cake when by Draco's side. He rolls his eyes and chuckles at me.
If your following along with this story, in which case thank you it means a lot, I've changed Nathan and Nathalie names to Cygnus and Aliette; I realised that the names sounded too muggle for Draco so changed them.
"You think I mined, Malfoy? Draco, it doesn't matter, It felt calming and nostalgic."  That at least claimed Draco down and made him laugh as his mother came in running towards the bed
Chapter nine: October 6th > A storm makes them stop by a temple where they stay for the night, Draco has a nightmare and Luicus is there to calm him down, getting Draco to have a bath. When they go back to bed Draco sneaks off to see how close they are to the Manor.
"Do you want me to leave then?" I shook my head, he didn't have to leave, especially if he had wanted to tell me something. "I came by just to ask if you were okay, and to apologise about this morning." That had me confused, why would he apologise for something that wasn't his fault? "I never intended to have everyone look at you like that." Why was this even Draco's fault?  I didn't have the willpower to continue our conversation, so just gave Draco a look and shook my head, changing how I was sat down. Draco felt happy enough to sit in near silence occasionally saying something or thinking out loud, I felt much more at ease and happy with his situation and Draco was happy to accommodate this perfectly.
I walked down to where my uncle sleeps, and knock on the door, I waited in my nightie by his bedroom door, "It's really cold, why did he have to choose this room of all things, right by the wine cellar. I waited for a further ten minutes before he opened the door "Oh Draco? What are you doing here?" I swayed on my heel, and sucked my bottom lip, and looked at him "I-I need you, I've made my decision." He looked at me and nodded, motioning me to come in and go to the bathroom, "You could wait another year..." I smiled and leaned by the door "I know, but I trust you more than goblins," He smiled and went to his potions store, while I undressed in his bathroom, slipping into the warm comforting gold tinted water with rose scented bubbles, I sank my body down below the water level and blew bubbles, laughing at my own childishness. I felt my hair spread out and flow creating a path in the water, I heard a knock on the door and slowly wished to fade  into depth of the ceramic tub, I knew two things; this would hurt me more than any crucio I've ever felt, and two I wouldn't feel most of it, unless I got out soon, "Draco, are you okay?"
"My dear darling nephew, they are watching, and they are proud of you. You have nothing to fear." I leaned into her words and took a breath. "You will be safe." I nod feeling more assured now than I was a few minutes ago.
I can't remember anything, other than pure heat, I remember major cramp pain, and the feeling on flat metal and glass, drying glass. When I woke up, I noticed that everything was brighter, I looked around the room, and only managed to hear sounds of voices, I figured that I was still in a state of unresponsiveness. I assume it stayed that way for a few minutes. "Draco?" I tried to sit up, and felt someone push me up and lean me on them, I coughed and inhaled, "Harry, Draco's fine, he just can't talk and will have trouble moving, and hearing things." Severus spoke quietly, and softly I could tell, but it was almost in vain, his voice still made my ears ring.
Draco didn't know what he meant by that but it soon didn't matter. As with an hour ago Draco began to shut his eyes. He felt a sharp nail grab the tip of his tounge and pull it slightly. Slice. Curiously he opened his eyes "Keep them open, I know you want to watch." Oh how he wanted to call lier. But it was true.
"Head Auror Malfoy, Auror Little and Hit Wizard Wilson requesting your presence in Auror Unit DE.C.M." I nodded to the intern already heading towards our Unit. Today was stressful, my family puls Harry would be here, and staying with me, because of his two Ministry Personelle would be around my estate, one inside the building and the other watching. My only problem was that Hit Wizard [] had encountered my father and almost caused his death in the previous war.
"You must be Draco, no one else can look so much like Citrus." I nodded warely any time someone mentioned my appearance it never ended well, magic can be so invasive you don't even have to be alive to harm someone. She looked softly at me, I clutched my father's robe. "I can assure you no one, witch wizard muggle or otherwise can hurt you, the very walls stop such disgraceful behaviour." I blinked, straightening my legs before curling them again. "This castle was once home to family, every essence of a magical home is to protect anyone inside of it, the caste still is home, to my grandnephew and your half-uncle."
It was then the knife was picked up again and sliced. Draco hardly suppressed a whimper, but a single tear did fall. It was only seconds as he felt it again. Lord Voldemort had indeed done as previously promised and stopped the bleeding quickly. "There there, no need to cry." He wasn't crying, he was sniffling.
That I have no answer for, he could be anywhere, and nowhere at the same time. "I do not know, you might want to check his Palace or his office." She nods and walks around the table, kissing my cheek lightly. My arm almost pulls her closer onto my lap but I resist. She is not mine to take.
I heard Hermione tell Draco that I most likely wasn't in the mood for a lot of talking, before letting him in and smiling as she went to prepare us some tea, lemon and ginger for me, as well as to make something for me to eat. I smiled up at Draco, my previous thoughts about him all forgotten, he kneeled by my chair, sitting on a cushion to rest his knees on. "How are you?" I know he meant well, I did, but I couldn't help but sigh, I didn't know how to respond.
I nodded, not minding having to eat in the carriage or outside, I was merely just hungry, therefore I didn't care where we ate.  My uncle and Daffodil didn't either so they decided that we would eat outside, so for the second time that day we left our carriages for some fresh and clean air. From then on, the journey was as smooth as it could be. We all stayed in the same carriage for most of the day yes even Susan and Regulus who didn't do anything unless we called them over or they walked up to us by themselves. Which they sometimes did and that's how Regulus is now sleeping before dinner next to Daffodil.
It doesn't interfere with my life all that much, I've come to see the people here as friends. But they aren't. They don't watch my house, they don't tack my phone or other electronics. Heck, they don't care who I date.
Th last words he would ever say would be 'What about my ring?'. It made him internally huff, he would never get to tell Harry how much he actually cared. How much he loved Harry. When thought about, his family meant a little more; that ring and eventually the Lordship ring, would protect him.
"Oh, I'd love to see that! Granger might need it, someone has to yell at her, or she'll never learn her place." I nodded as we had finished the task, first. Theo had charmed her feather to do the opposite of the spell we were doing. She turned and glared at us "What's wrong Granger? Angry that we did it first, or looking for someone to blame for your mistakes?" I subtlety high-fived Pansy under our desks, as Theo, smiled devilishly at her. She ran off crying at the end of the lesson.
October 12th - Afternoon
He happily bounced out of bed and ran toward the bathroom, a few seconds later I could hear him turn on the bath tap. Sighing I stood up, Merlin I felt so tried and dead. But I was willing to wash Harry's hair for him as I had been for a few weeks at this point.
Smiling as he was happily splashing water around, stopping as soon as he he saw me "Sorry." His blush looked adorable on his little cute face. Slipping back into our casual routine of me washing his hair while he asks questions about things.
Chapter Three – July 20
"Have either of you decided who will go where? As I have a few ideas, and if you can't decide I will choose who." They shook their heads, I sighed, I loved my job and who I worked with, they were nice and we had fun, even if I was only here for a few years, going into my second.
I wish I wish that his words would be as comforting as they were meant to be, Regulus had a calming effect on everyone he spoke too, this time it wasn't working, my stress about Harry ate away me, like claws or teeth ripping at my insides and stomach, much like how I feel around Severus whenever it's nightfall and he's holding a glass. I let out a soft but long sigh of happiness as Regulus places his cold hand on my abdomen "You shouldn't stress yourself so much, your skin is hot and red, please, Draco stay calm." That was his voice, the voice he hadn't been using for this entire trip. His eunuch voice, I could tell as he strained the please and my name, his tone was soft and gentle, his eyes seemed to open perhaps is I was a master at reading minds, it would be easy to read his at this moment.
Imperial rank.  Draco returns after a month away, his parents have died, when he returned he didn’t feel like eating and was forced outside to breakfast.  Where he meets Harry and they look up to each other. 75 days of mourning start. A new character by the name of Daffodil is introduced.
"You deserved that one." She said walking past him carrying a pile of clothes up the stairs, I looked at Draco and laid my head on his shoulder, he patted my head, and my glasses were lightly hit off my face, although I didn't realise it "Nathalie! No, say sorry," as Draco place my glasses back on my head, I blinked and rested my head on him. "Harry, are you alright?" I looked at him but his father answered, for me "His glasses are the wrong prescription, they used to be his fathers, he has worse eyesight than James did." I just vaguely pointed to is father "What your dad said." I carefully lifted my head.
After this revelation I took my time to walk back towards the room we were graciously given, making sure to greet whoever I passed appropriately. When I did return about half an hour later, I was glad that my uncle was still sleeping as soundly as I had left him. It was me getting back into bed that woke him. As it turns out I make more noise getting into a bed rather than out.
"What's your name?" Draco asked me, sitting on the plush bench in my room "Stephane Cordato, your father found me last night, I think- How long was I asleep for?" I said looking at him, he sighed and told me that I'd been sleeping for a week,
Harry smilied at me, nodding, somehow I think Harry understands me a lot better than others. Other than Blaise and Pansy but even then they are literal fourteen year olds. Harry, something about him, is so advanced and knowledgeable it's comforting. Kind of like my uncle.
7:03, great this took me two hours. Now I can have some food and do something!! This was an early morning attempt at some crack, it's probably not the best I've ever done.
I would say sorry for what I said, after I had been made sure that what Theo said was wrong. "Do you care? About me? Please tell me truth!" I blurted out, desperate. Harry looked surprised and shocked, he reached out to hold my hand, his bright green eyes shining with an emotion I can't comprehend. Gently tugging at my hand he pulled me closer.
They were happy. The wizarding world was happy.
Citrus - 14
Her sigh was what immediately called Daffodil's attention. She stood up and whipped out her wand, walking silently, a spy in her own home. Slowly she began to turn on her music box; the sweet tune luring out her prey. A simple old tune, sweet and alluring, but dangerous and harsh, a little like death Daffodil thought. Reggie was currently cleaning another area and she couldn't very well call him here, maybe they would have a discussion later on about the distance they constantly faced. Daffodil waited calmly as the eunuch came from her own bedroom, blood boiled as she sent the darkest holding curse she could. Binding the brat to the floor in her special room. She didn't take calmy to people rummaging through her things, her precious things. Her gifts and pride.
"Why didn't you say thank you?" I turned my head towards Harry, he looked confused, I smiled and ran a hand through his hair. He still had a lot to learn about how we live, and I also apparently had to do the same with Harry.
"Why don't we have breakfast?" I suggested looking up at Lucius with a smile.
"I agree, and this behaviour is rather normal for Lucius, he did the same when Abraxas died in his teens. I would recommend going to Tom and asking if Lucius can see his Healer, but is something else wrong?" I asked, since she had been so upright and utterly confusing today. Had something occurred, before Lucius went to sleep? When Draco was kept out of their room?
Now days later, we're a still unsure what I came down with, but the healers placed it down to something recurring from childhood. This meant little to nothing for Remus and Sirius who kept me with them until the week's end. Hermione was questioned and when I next saw her, her hair was cut and her hands bandaged. I was assured that whatever happened was light. I didn't dare press further.
He dismissed me and I walked back to the tower in relative peace. I had decided that I would spend today with Ron and Hermione, then talk to Draco tonight.
I stay here two days a week, Evey Saturday and Sunday. All fifty-two weeks in a year. It never changes. I've been coming here since I was eleven, so that's every weekend, for fifty-two weeks, for nine years, that's 468 weeks. Four hundred and sixty-eight weekends.
He handed me a small phial, with light pink liquid inside I took it and popped it open and downed the contents, and immediately felt numb, frozen. I could still see and feel, although the latter was extremely small. I saw him hover over me, my quality of sight, however, was scratchy, as if looking through frosted or broken glass which was actually what my eyes were coated in. I felt a small chisel and a blunt knife cracked the glass covering my eyes and lifted it off, careful to not let a small piece go into my eye. "Damm it." I realised that I couldn't move my eyes, I heard him walk off and get my mother. The next thing I knew I couldn't see a thing, my vision as was black as charcoal, but felt mild pain, and I could imagine I'd get a very big headache soon, maybe.
"The easiest way to get me to school would be to let me go to either Nathan's or Mat's a week before the start of school, and well I'd have to show you, but it's difficult, doctor" I explained Lucius seemed to understand "Okay, then show me." I stand up and look at him "You're going to need to fire a spell at me, I actually have no idea how I can do this, no one does, but it's really cool." He looked shocked but fired Aguamenti, as soon as the spell hit my chest, it shrunk into a small version of its wand movement in see-through shell, and floated I held it in my hand I threw it up into the air and jumped to receive it, as they failed to adhere to laws of gravity. "That's why, I can stop spell suddenly, turning them into these, the teachers at school believe that in theory I should be protected against every spell, but they've told me not to try to find out myself, doctor." With that, he told me he'd look into getting me to one of my friends in a week and that I could go back outside.
"And your aunt and uncle don't like the fact that you don't like girls? Harry if it makes you feel any better, even a small bit, my parents weren't the happiest people when I told them I mostly preferred boys they thought it was because of things that had happened at school." I giggled and smiled at the thought.
Harry's smile faulted as I asked, "Snape wanted to ask me if I knew anything about why you were in the common room at night, I decided that I should talk to you." Harry paused, his words sound sincere, I knew he was, Severus had told me that he'd ask Harry about his possible involvement in my 'stunt' as he called it. "I will admit that I didn't know you had left, in retrospect I should have done. I promised to take care of you, I should have realised that you had left."
"Not in the damn mood, talk to me after I've had something hot down my throat." She said spitefully looking at him pointing a spoon at his neck. Which didn't look that threatening but he backed away nodding anyway? Draco smiled and laughed quietly. Drawing us to her attention. I looked up at him as she smiles and waved, before turning back to her tea making.
Our carriages were like small rooms, thick walls that we could lean against and rest upon.  My uncle and I had gotten in ours soon after dinner, our bags were up on the wall. Fourtanlly for our eunuchs these carriages were on wheels and they didn't have to do anything like carry us for several hours. Why do I mention this? We had left the city a few hours ago, the sky was becoming darker and darker by the minute. My uncle was up against the wall, holding me, I was lying down, my head on his lap, almost asleep. I didn't want to do this. I didn't want to be a Lord or even own the Manor. But I had to, my uncle couldn't take it easy, at least he couldn't take the Lordship. I could give the Manor to him, I would rather it be with him than me. But it was coming back the feeling of returning so soon made me feel ill, made my stomach do flips and my lungs twist and flatten. So naturally, I decided that sleeping would be the best way to be rid of those feelings.
Harry cautiously took a few steps forward I looked up at him, I was slightly annoyed that his shoes made him a bit taller, but now was not the time for that. "Draco why?" I couldn't answer as Professor McGonagall called us and the few other people into class.
I woke to a screaming Harry, distantly yelling my name; my hands tied behind my back and my hair pushed flush on my scalps, I could hear Lucius' faint sobs and tears, his hushed pleading of anything. Slowly Bella's face comes into my view "What do we have here?" She cooed disgustingly, my heart pounds in my chest, I feel like throwing up, everything is swimming and sound is hard to hear. I can't hear what she's saying but her eyes are mad and unstable. I scream as something sharp and thin hits my back and beads of blood run down my pale skin. Lucius rushes towards and in a flash of light everything is gone, he's holding me close to his chest as Tom lazily waves his wand in our general direction, before I know it, sleep and darkness consume m
Draco had said that he'd be fine with sitting with me and my friends after he magically changed into something, but I told him no straight out. So now I'm sat with Blaize and Pansy who knew something was up with him, to tell them that they were right was shattering. However as the train pulled up, I could see the ritual slowly wear off, although all I wanted to do was sleep when we got to Malfoy Manor "It's fine, my parents will tell us to go to sleep anyway, they know how tiring the train ride is." I smiled, mostly at knowing that I'll be treated like a human going to Draco's it calms me and I end up leaning on Draco and the window.
Draco decided to sit with me and my friends, I smiled as he waved to his friends, "Hey, guys do you mind?" I asked motioning to Draco, as he hid behind me, They nodded and we all sat down, I felt a tug at my sleeve, glancing down.
Instead of doing either of those things I nuzzled into her and fiddled with the embodiments on her dress. "I don't know, I'm scared I guess." Naturally, these weren't words we were allowed to say and or emotions we were allowed to feel. She hugged me close and placed a kiss to my brow.
My doctor looks up, startled, "Close the door, Harry." I blink shutting the door. Did I open it? Did I say that out loud?! "I take it you saw one of the Malfoys then?" I nod sitting down in front of him
"Two weeks ago, we were at a party for a friend's birthday, someone, took me." Was all he gave me as an explanation, I stayed with him the whole day.
I awake dripping in sweat, panting and Lucius prying the blanket from my death hold "Draco you'll lose all feeling to your hands if you continue like this." He snaps but it's the tone that doesn't suit the delivery. Reluctantly I let go and lean against him, pressing my forehead onto his cotton shirt "Now what's this all about?" Lucius was never a very emotional person towards me, I never expected this to change, but slowly I could tell it was. I shrugged and leaned on him more. "There's a storm outside, we've had to stop, we're in a temple and our things are fine."
I tapped Draco's shoulder and told him that I'd be in the Library to do potions homework, he said that he'd wait for me, and If he wasn't there when l came back, he'd be in his dorm. I didn't actually need to do potions homework, I just thought that they should be left alone. I came back a few hours later to see Draco standing by a wall, he smiled and hugged me when he saw me. "Did you finish it?" I nodded as we walked to dinner, Pansy and Blaise nowhere in sight "Blaise went home and Pansy's in the common room." I nodded and we sat down at our respective tables.
They came in together, side by side. The Emperor led Draco, holding his arm and leading him to the table, allowing him beside Lucius while I sat close in between Remus and Sirius. Draco smiled at me as he reached for a selection of toast. Lucius leaned in towards Draco's ear and began whispering, what it was I have no idea. By then they had all started talking amongst ourselves, but most of everyone looked at me in destain, which I didn't understand. I hadn't spent the night with our Emperor, that was Draco! Is Draco better liked because he can function as a normal teenager? Or do people just not like me and this has nothing to do with Draco? I cam to rest my head on Remus' shoulder, too dizzy to lift my head. Remus looks at me with a smile that comes too naturally to him he feeds me little bits of cake until I've eaten my slice. At this everyone is muttering and glaring at me and to each other, I heard one tiny snippet; 'spoiled just Lady Malfoy'. I looked over at Draco and he shrugged, he had been dealing with this for a while I could tell.
"We'll rock paper scissors it if we can't decide." they turned around "Auror Malfoy, well-done go getting here." I rolled my eyes and sat next to Auror Little (Allison).
Anyway, green walls and ceiling. Yes. My room here.
Mathematics was a vastly different scenario, I could do it I could, I can understand it but I was slow at it when most would be finished in seconds I'd be finished in minutes. I hated it even more since the teacher had said that Neptune had excelled in this and he couldn't understand why I didn't. Overall the class made me feel weak, stupid and inadequate. My parents had to console me for the entire trip back down to normal ground.
"Probably not, he did always want me to have long hair, but I don't care about he wants that much. I can do whatever want I'm not letting my uncle stop me." I said with a shrug, smiling a little at Harry, "He can, technically, but it's my choice whether or not I listen." I watched as Harry glanced at the water and the fish, looking up at me after a few minutes, "Why do you ask?" I questioned, reaching to hold Harry's hand, wanting to know if he would answer me.
The Empress was currently bathing in warm water and rose petals, said by her healer to promote her muscles and magic to relax and calm. Which was at the moment something she required. She had felt the stress of some sort of oncoming issue. Her husband, as always brushed away her concerns and told her to do some needlework. She had been shutting herself out away from everyone, too ashamed of her looks to let anyone see her. She even stopped lying beside
Passing Lucius, as I'm on my way to my Doctor's office, I smile and wave at him, he justs smiles back. I have a feeling I know what the first thing I'm going to say is. They don't even let me over for lunch, the most simple meal of the day, and they won't let me over.
I stood with Pansy and Theo watching her run off towards her own common room, before walking to Potions as I felt a sharp tug at my robe.
city I thought, as we walked the short distance to a Primark store , I smiled as I practically ran toward the top floor, just to see the 'homeware' mostly the cushions, before Draco, managed to catch me and take back down to the second floor "Harry, come on, we're here for a reason." I nodded and walked alongside Draco and Lucius, although Draco quickly realised that I held little interest in boyish clothing, and kept looking at the ground floor. "Harry, do you want to go downstairs?" Draco kneeled down and whispered, for no pure reason, I turned around and smiled "Please can we?" I asked a little loudly as Lucius turned around from where he was standing and a few others turned to look at us "Please can you what, Harry?" I answered the question before Draco could even open his mouth "Go downstairs?" Draco laughed and just took me to the ground floor before his father could answer.
The knocking on my door to say that someone was waiting outside to see me was not expected, after all, it was a Saturday morning, who would want to speak to me so early? Or just speak to me at all, I knew that I was probably the second most disliked person here other than the Emperess. The knock was too feminine to be Lucius and it was much too soft to be Tom. I let them in and sent my eunuch away to make some tea or something. Of course, it would be her, her long, elegant plunging dressing, ivory in colour. She swept across to room to greet me, her tail of lace and slim followed behind her. I would have thought her feet bear, although it wasn't a stretch, as the pathways are clear of dirt and mud. Although it wasn't her dress, shoes, or anything about her physical appearance, even if she was fit to be a goddess, that caught my attention. It was the way she spoke. As if desperate for my help and assistance. It wasn't a tone she regularly used.
"Do you sleep with your uncle?" Harry's voice is quiet and gentle, I would asv him to explain what exactly he means, as at the moment, sleep with could mean anything. Although I've grown up in a limitless world, I've had rules yes, of behaviour and decorem; but of moral and and boundaries we had none, my parents always led lax lives, having no real issue with bending the rules, my uncle and Daffodil are the same but worse. Severus, he is different. I don't like Severus, I never have. "Draco?"
When we finally came back to the City I was lying against Lucius for support, I felt so tired and sleepy. He thought it had something to do with the way we decided to do everything and how we made a lord. It wasn't something awful but we did blood and I became tried after having too use a knife and seeing blood. Regulus and Susan were with Daffodil as we entered with no real grandeur, which pleased me, I didn't want to attract more attention than I already had over this past year. Going back made me remember coming back in July, but this time I wasn't alone and we actually got off the carriages to walk the way to our palace.
While Daffodil was reading, quiet happily, Alice was rummaging through her things. Opening and closing drawers, checking under her bed and inside her bathroom. She had been tasked with spying on the concubine, on the request of the Empress, on the request that she try to find anything of which her mistress could use against the traitorous another concubine. Currently, she had found absolutely nothing, no exquisite gifts, no special given robes, hairpins, headdresses. Nothing! There were no letters or cards. Almost as if the concubine was just a slut that spread her legs for Lucius and Lucius only. There was no chance of her going through his palace alive. She would be found and killed publicly in the City, most likely at breakfast, the Emperor would do nothing to stop the spill of her blood. He had already disposed of his own eunuchs for several reasons. She wasn't being another body buried in the ground, in the river or given to the wolves for food.
"You seemed scared to tell me before you stopped." Draco laughed and smiled, he had regained some calmness and relief.
Lucius slowly up wrapped me from my cotton clothes and laid them out to dry, I wasn't in the mood to be modest and feel shame about being pressed into my uncle "Where are we?" Naturally, I had almost no knowledge of most of the surrounding area around Wiltshire and more specifically Holt. Lucius smiled as he lowered me into a warm, relaxing bath. I looked up at him, wanting an answer to my question.
"Does it have anything to with Draco, sir?" Snape seemed surprised at my question or they fact that I called him 'sir' without needing to be reminded. I looked up at him from my hands, and looked around his office. His face suggested that I was right, and I was in major trouble. I could only hope that his parents wouldn't come out of the floo to yell at me. He and his friends started it in class, not us.
Draco and I share them over tea and cake. He often comes with me, he gets as close to my room, I know he also comes by to spend time with his parents, he doesn't see them often. And he wants them to change their minds. He cares, even if I necessarily don't.
Walking out of the common room with interresting to say the least , the person (or people) who attkacked Draco high-fived each other and their friends while making rather loud dirty comments about Draco, I tried not to increse my grip on him "Oh they think their untouchable, I'll show them, watch them burn." Draco muttered darkly, I looked at him and smiled "Oh, Draco, can I say one thing?" He nodded looking at me, "I'll be fine with you begin a Death Eater if you don't tell me too much detail , okay?" He noded, smiling we made it to the train easily from then on.
"I want what we decided last week to be folded and put away, I will not look like an Edwarain princess." Reg nodded, smirking as he turned away to do what I asked but my uncle groaned "I'll be able to handle him uncle, please don't worry." He needed assurance that everything would be okay. We were set to leave at dusk tonight, ready to arrive at Wiltshire for dawn, and subsequently, my new Lordship. At last, I could step off the stool and into waiting arms. Sents of cinnamon and spiced chocolate engulfed me in waves. This morning the bells were rung loudly and clearly over the whole of the City and therefore London. The seventy-five days were over. Mourning had ended, although for us, it would never be complete.
"He was calming me down, nothing else," I explained for Regulus, who had just ended up with his head on the floor, not wanting to meet my uncle's eyes. I saw my uncle nod and go back to his work, gently I lifted Regulus' head only for him to scramble out and go back into Daffodil's carriage, I felt my heart sink watching him run towards his cousin, no doubt in a horrible mood now. My uncle looks up at my glare, "You don't have to sound like you're going to kill him." I don't give my poor uncle a chance to talk over me. He sighs and beckons me towards him putting his book down on the 'floor'.My rant and yelling continue for quite some time, a few hours. Yet he does absolutely nothing, he doesn't yell back or look away, he's watching me the entire time. Until I run out of breath, fall to my knees and collapse.
I sighed and licked my lips, Draco sat down next to me and held my hand "You know how we're fictional in the muggle world? And how there are 7/8 movies about each year in Hogwarts?", Draco nodded wondering where I was going with this, "Well, I was watching the second film, and got a crush on one of the actors, my aunt got me a doctors appointment because I wasn't a 'normal boy'." Draco ran a hand through my hair. "They asked me a bunch of questions, and told me to keep a journal thing of all my emotions and thoughts down on paper." Draco hugged me, and I rested my head on his shoulder.
I woke up to find Draco playing with a small  glass dome, about 40cm in height, I sat up and realised he was flipping it upside down and opening it, "What are you doing?" He didn't seem to hear me, I waited and watched him, he was completely immersed in the dome.
Walking into my room, I saw eight dresses laid out on the bed, with a note on top, saying that I could wear the dresses if I wanted, but when I actually start working, I should wear the blue and white maid dress thing or anything similar. Most probably Draco chose the colours, well it makes sense. At that moment I heard a someone tap my bedroom door, I slowly walked up to it and opened it, to see Draco. Speak of the devil and thou shall appear "Yes?" he looked down before asking if he could talk to me, For someone I'm working for, he does seem to be more afraid of me. "Hey, Draco what's wrong? I know somethings up with you." He carefully sat on the bench and looked right at me "Can I trust you, to keep a secret, don't tell you friends, or any other family you might have, don't tell a soul, can I trust you to do that?" I sat in front of him, and held his hand, "Draco, you can trust me with any secret, honestly." He took a deep breath before beginning his explanation.
After dinner, I nodded goodbye to Ron and Hermione and caught up with Draco and Pansy, "Are you guys okay?" I held Pansy's hand she smiled as we shut the door into the common room.
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
It felt strange. Yes Draco was givien a while to adjust to the new feeling. What he once had total control over he had suddenly lost. It was unbelievable how easily he had got his head around it. "Don't worry, you be able to speak one language Draco." The way that was said... That's why Draco had been learning Parsletonge! He nodded and opened his mouth, licking his dry lips "I'll save you annoyences."
Little moon rushes in with a glass of water for me as Tom rose from his seat, his eyes looken suken in "You really shouldn't be here Draco, the Minister isn't the only person wanting to attack me." I shake my head, taking the offered water "She's not well." I have to suppress my laugher, looking up at him innocently "Go on, say what you want." He allows, sitting back down on his chair running a hand through his hair.
She didn't care. Everyone here was below her, they should bow till their knees ache and throw themselves to the floor for her. Not just her husband. She would rule them once her husband died, then the100 days of mourning would be worth the white clothes, which she only used for minimal tasks regardless. Her beauty was suffering from this stupid thing, her arms and legs looked like an animal, she was always shaved, this was humiliation. For her no doubt!  That boy and his uncle's plaything were getting on her nerves. If it were up to her, she would have dealt with them all personally. She didn't care that the fancy toy was her sister; all she was good for was being on display naked for all to see, she got enough of a rush from it with Lucius.
Oh right! I bought her a pack of chocolates, they're currently in the fridge at home. I do that sometimes, the doctors here think it's Tom's fault. I'm not that stupid, I know it is. I know it's his fault because he's done it since I was little, but it's never hurt me. He's told me it's his fault.
"He was angry, about a chair, then he dropped Scabbers in a metal pot.." my explanation was rough and jagged, I could hardly think, Draco ran a hand through my hair and placed a cooling charm on me, calming me down.
"Draco, I care about you a lot, I won't stop because of anything, but you and your friends said really hurt Hermione, according to Ron and Ginny, I know that you're better than that, by the way, Professor Snape told me what it meant."
Happy Reading!
She would show her dammed sister who really had the power and influence. Even if it meant killing her and her half-dead servent.
"Mum, it's fine, I just want to go home."
"They're so live and humourous" Harry's voice continues of several minutes "Remus has such dark humour, I think you two would get along, and Siri is really funny in general, he's always telling me about his time at Hogwarts with my parents and Remus." I had defiantly heard about that they had gotten up to; second hand from my uncle who went to school with them and Severus for a year before he graduated. "They take me to get ice-cream and we go to museums and they take me to watch films. I love them." Of course, Harry does, but to what extent?
I opened my eyes to see myself beside my parents tucked closely into my mother's arms, I shuffled slightly before falling asleep again.
The Dark Lord knew how to force Draco to get better, it wasn't through threats of murder. How do you force dependence out of someone? By taking away what they are dependent on.
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
"Did I miss anything?" I nodded and went to explain that he'd missed some sort of Yule celebration, he sighed and pulled away at the duvet, until he'd set it under him. I slowly laid my head on his lap, hearing a small chuckle from above me.
Draco blinked and smiled "Harry it's because they've seen what he can do and they know if he comes back he can do it again, just with more power. The wizarding world was torn by him, split into good people and Death Eaters and their families. The Dark Lord reigned with fear, it was impossible to escape him, those who tried were often found and killed or tortured. He wanted to be feared by everyone but his army and followers. And no-one stood a chance against him then, not even your parents, they would have been found or forced out of hiding sooner or later had they surivied. I'm sorry but it's the truth, you haven't seen it or dealt with it actually, with what he'd capable of. That's why no-one else calls him that." I was shocked at Draco's words, I wasn't expecting him to say all that, he looked at me then down "I'm sorry I brought up your parents Harry I really am but it's true." I smiled sadly "It's okay Draco, I've come to terms with my parents a long time ago, I still hate Halloween." I went to talk to him but he was fell asleep. Looking at the time my eyes widened 10:30 pm, "I should be getting to bed myself." I went to get up but Draco's arm stopped me "Please don't move." He said in his sleep-ridden state, rolling my eyes I just lay down and we fell asleep with our arms wrapped around each other.
Breakfast couldn't have come sooner. I had seen Harry walk out and followed after, taking a few minutes longer to get the Great Hall. He was sat with his friends. Avoiding anything would have been much preferable to what I got, of course, I had expected nothing less of Gryffindor's but it still hurt. Only I didn't show it, not until they broke me.
You would never assume anything bad happened to Draco. But if you look closer. His hands are skeletal, ivory in colour. A gift the Dark Lord had awarded him, that's what his mother always said.
Chapter one: June 19th - 20th > Draco muses about his normal day in the Forbidden City as a concubine to Emperor Tom Riddle, mentioning that Draco's is something like his favouture and gets to do things that others don't. Draco briefly mentions his uncle Luicus, the fact that he's older than sixteen and that new concubines are arriving soon.  Draco leaves to go home before his parents die to try and see them one last time, and while he’s travelling outside in a carriage he notices that the people he can see outside are so much poorer than he thought. Although he questions it a lot while going towards his family home it never impacts him as he immediately starts talking about nature and getting there.
The Empress feels threatened and embarrassed in her bath and goes straight to death and toture for revenge.
I wanted to move, but I know I can't. My legs haven't moved in decades trapped in the same position since I can remember from my adult life. I can remember my childhood easily, joyful and happy, sweet like the children I can hear outside.
"Harry?" I ask out loud as our dormitory door opens, I don't mean to sound hopeful, but he's the only person it could be, no one else can enter unless it's Professor Snape. The door opened slowly as if offended that I had dared to assume who was behind it. I bit lip, yelling at myself for being so foolish, stupid and even believing that he might care.
It was clear that they weren't expecting Draco to run, jump and hug them around their necks at full speed but they welcomed it all the same "We also missed you Dragon." I smiled at the family as they end their group hug "Now what happened to you, Draco?" His mother asked I opened my mouth to answer her, but Draco beat me to it "We were in the Great Hall, and I cut my cheek by accident, as Harry's Head of House was yelling his name because Harry zoned out while Headmaster Dumbledore was making his announcements ." I just shut my mouth and sat still. His mother sighed reviled for Draco's safety "Oh well thank Merlin you're both alright, Draco are you sure your okay?" He nodded to his father,"Harry hasn't done anything to hurt me." I smiled at his stubborn child-like voice as he sat back on my lap,
"What's that?" Jumping out of my skin In turn around to see Draco leaning on a wall, pointing to the box. "And why did Scabior deliver it with the words 'Happy birthday from the Dark Lord'?" I pick the box up and walk back into the living room, unwrapping it.
But greed is a sin, and every sin has a price one must be willing to pay.
"All I know, before you ask, is to expect a parcel." I nod confused but take the cake as breakfast. "Someone has a present for you, as a thank you." I nod again, smirking to myself.
"You mean Christmas Day?" He sighed and got up, I got down and waited as Draco went to get something for him to wear. I blushed and smiled standing out of the way.
I am lucky, my family is endowed by the Emperor, I often leave with my uncle to see family; it saves me from staying locked up in our palace. It's too dangerous for me to leave alone. Tomorrow a group of chosen new concubines are to line one of our many halls, in front of our Emperor and our Kings. Only four will be chosen from the seventh rank to the fourth rank. I worry for whoever takes fourth; they're not too far up to me favoured immediately and not too low to be disregarded.
Walking toward the Gryffindor table I passed Ginny the book, she smiled brightly and batted her eyelashes at me "Oh thank you, Harry, ever so much! You have no idea how long I was searching for it this morning." I stepped back before she could run at me, I quickly jogged away from her as Ron spoke to her.
"Ron's my best friend, but even I couldn't bear two, especially when one is completely obsessed with me." The Slytherin girl smiled and nodded to Draco, who looked pale and scared.
I opened my eyes to see Draco's above me "Are you okay Harry? Were you having a nightmare? Do you want me to call Severus?" I blinked, okay it was a dream, just a dream, a very strange dream, and very realistic but still a dream, I told myself.
I held his hand again and smiled. He smiled back and Dumbledore let us go to class,  although he told me that he would busy at break, so I shouldn't try to find him. I nodded and smiled sadly, I had wanted to spend time with him. I felt him grab my hand and brush away my hair "Harry, don't be upset please, I'd honestly rather you be with me, but that can't happen, besides you need to spend time with your friends, otherwise they'll claim I'm stealing you." I laughed and got out my things, ready for Charms.
"Draco, are your eyes okay?" I looked around the room towards my parents, and Sev, my mother stepped forward and began to hand me a mirror "Draco, honey Severus needed to replace your eyes if he hadn't you wouldn't have been able to see at all. I gave him two rings that used to belong to my mother, and my sister Andromeda, Severus did the spell so that you could see." I was handed the mirror and saw bright glowing lice blue topaz eyes, gems that were worth hundreds on their own. Add the fact that they were part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight made there worth almost quadruple there original worth, I began to cry I hoped that my tears would damage anything, "Dragon, there's no need to cry, we weren't going to place marble in your eye."
"I wonder how Sirius is coping without his brother." Lucius glanced at her and shook his head, staring his own opinion which was roughly that Sirius had more than enough people to keep him occupied and stable. Besides that tonight was the full moon, which meant both that he would be bust with Remus all night and that someone would be keeping the Emperor company.
He won't want to talk to me after what I said, I should have realised that Harry wouldn't be happy with me. I was expecting him to yell and scream, not to ignore me and push me away when I tired to at least say sorry, even if it was pointless. He wasn't who he wanted to apologise to. Which was why I was currently sitting in the common room by the fire, I knew it wasn't safe. But I couldn't sleep in the second bed in our dormitory. Curled in a tight ball against the back of the chair, I looked and felt pathetic, any other person would be able to sleep in a second bed, a mear meter and a half away from another person, anyone but me. I could practically hear my grandfather's snarl in my ear. Telling me how useless, pathetic, and weak I was being. Before I knew I was shut away in a cold dark room, as he walked away. I hadn't realised that I had fallen asleep until I felt someone shake me. Snapping my eyes open I saw Snape looming above me. Carefully and slowly I uncurled myself and stood up.
October 12th - Morning - after breakfast
The image we made was painfully obivous, we went to the same school,and only on of us is studying. What I found not strange personally is that people were willing to end Dumbledore; but Hogwarts, as building and school was still hailed. As if it's very magic and structure kept it safe from dislike, Hogwarts wasn't a disgrace, the people in charge were.
he ran a hand through my hair and smiled. We both sat in the car and got an approving smile from his father.
"So what are they like outside of the city?" I was mealy curious because I knew that everyone was different outside the city, and Sirius and Remus seemed to be the most detached and quiet people here. They were always together or with Harry, at least Remus was a little talkative and with people, he was often round the city. I've often walked in on him in a hall or a seen him by a riverbank, humming to himself, he always looked so peaceful. Sirius I hardly ever saw outside of mealtimes; if it wasn't for those I would assume he didn't live here at all. I know now that Sirius spends most of his time either at his palace with Remus or in Daffodil's eunuch house
, I thought,
Oh that's what he wants. That's simple "Go on then, get ready."
I turned around and saw a blur of light blue and white "What is the time?" I asked my tone sounding like I'd rather be asleep "4:52 am" he said before placing something down on the table and curling up beside me "Harry, go back to sleep I'll wake you up in time for breakfast, although your dinner is still here, under a warming charm." I brushed off his last comment and shuffled towards him, before falling asleep.
Wait. That's a bad thought, absolutely not. Not like that. Harry had almost nothing to do with my uncle. I definitely do not find my uncle cute or adorable. Not in the slightest.
My eyes drop for the faintest of seconds before surface tension breaks and I'm back in the real world, not some fantastical dreamscape. I'm curled inside a thick towel, no doubt our own as temples are about the gift of nature and simplicities. My head rests on my uncle's warm beating chest, once again a lure, however this time into a state of sleep. Held tightly against Lucius I'm carried towards our sleeping chambers, where the next thing I feel is a warm bed and strong arms wrapped around me.
" The little black snake slithered towards the vanilla cake and stuck out its tongue. Taking a bite, he made a somewhat happy noise.
I wish I could hate them all. Most of them are not what I want, it's all fake. They all look like me, that's not good for any chance of an heir. But there is one who interests me. Dark hair, green eyes, and he keeps coughing and sits down a lot. I think he's sick, or at least, sickly. He's from Surrey and looks awfully undertreated. After a brief conversation with Lucius, Severus, Remus and Sirius (Perl, Obsidian, Amber and Ruby) They each chose someone, Remus and I chose the same person, Harry Potter.
After Harry and I had spent a bit of time outside we returned to his palace and room, by Harry's request. We ended up falling asleep, although I woke up to the sound of coughing, and a body shaking aganist my own. I summon a glass of water, sitting Harry up, letting him rest against my chest for a short while before I press the cool glass to his lips. They're small, much like own, but lighter in shade. The time is a mystery to me but it can't be very early, I don't care though, my only concern is Harry. His eunuch runs in a few seconds later, only to sigh relieved at the sight of Harry drinking some water. She returns to her room soon enough, able to make us tea and heat up some noddle soup before doing so.
I ended up sitting in Draco's lap, too afraid to actually sit down, as we took the long drive to London, we were about halfway there when something buzzed and made a weird soft noise I looked at Draco as he pulled out a phone, better than Dudley or even Vernon phone, one I knew they'd dream to have. "Just a friend wanting to know something, nothing important," Draco explained before they both noticed my face.
I don't know how to describe the things I saw on my way; I don't think I was paying much attention to the outside world when arriving in the City too excited to finally see the Emperor in person, I had met my uncle before, multiple times. But it's so different, I don't like it. There are people in rags outside shops, children in unwashed or over washed clothes. Parents on their own. I don't like it! It's cruel and mean, what are they being punished for? What bad deeds did they do in their previous lives? Why do they have to suffer in mortality, why not drum skin? Or a butterfly or a rock?
