And as the bullets graze my arms,
I can totally see Drarry living happy together, and once a year Harry and Draco have a no wands date. So this year they went to the beach and had a lot of fun. Until it started to rain. Like hell was breaking loose, and them running to a bus cover. So when they are sitting in the bus, dripping wet. The look at eachother and Draco is sopping wet, with drupplets falling from his nose, and his hair a darker blond when its wet, and Harry just instantly falls in love with him, and says so, but they never said it to eachother before. So Harry is feeling a tad anxious. But Draco looking at Harry for a long time and saying "Took you long enough". And The whole bus applausing.
I can also see Draco being an artist. So everytime he feels like it, and Harry is in his eye field. He sketches the boy he loves. First making the outlines and then colours it.
Enjoy
Enjoy!
I can imagine that when Harry is on Tiktok he is a 90's boy and when he is scrolling on his for you page he sees a blond boy, an e-boy. His profile name is "DrayMalfoy" and Harry is intreegd. He looks at his profile and falls in love. Absolutly in love. He follows him and likes his videos. He waits 2 days and finally dray follows him back. They have conversations and disided to meet.
I can imagine when it is christmas Harry always decorates the house and searches a Christmas tree and buys presents and bakes. While draco acts like he doesn't really care. But yet draco is always the first to switch on the Christmas lights, first to eat the baken goods and the first to open his presents.
I can imagine when Draco had his redemption and he is living Somewhere in knokturn alley because he doesnt have enough money to buy a good house. So when Potter does a check up on all the houses because he is an auror. He finds Malfoy, rolled up in bed, shivering and having the worst fever to ever exist. Harry looks at him for a whole 2 seconds before he picks him up and dissaperates to grimmuald place. Where he puts Draydray in the warmest bed and stays by him all the time. Hovering over him looking if he had enough to drink, or asking when he last eat and when Draco asks if his wife is okay with this Harry says "I was never into red heads, or girls for that matter. I like them blond and slim" and Draco chokes on his water. Before he can even look up Draco is being kissed.
Enjoy!
Harry jumped after him.
I can totally see when Harry is sick he is in denial. Saying "no I am not sick, i havn't been sick in 2 years!". And Draco looking at him, and just taking his wand. Levicorpsing Harry (while Harry is strugling) and just putting him in bed. And Harry being al grumpy, but knowing he can't argue with Draco. So he stays in bed. And Draco just saying "good boy". Which gives Harry a little smile.
Enjoy! Also a very small one.
It is this constant thought for which I keep fighting,
And as I lay here silently looking at the sky.
"Once when I was eleven years old, I met a boy my age. He was really really mean to me. He always was stepping on my toes and he was saying mean things to me. He made me feel like I was not good enough, but I always believed there was something good in him. When the battle of Hogwarts came around, he proved to me he was good.
I can imagine that when Draco and Harry had a fight Harry just walks away and goes to Ron and hermoine not letting anything know to Draco. When he finally comes back he sees Draco sleeping on the couch drool coming out of his mouth. He stares at him and whispers "does it count if I just want to see you happy?" And Draco keeps his eyes closed, so Harry is about to pick him up when Draco whispers "I want to see you happy to, I love you". Harry just picks him up and puts him to bed. Cuddling next to him. They both fall asleep with a smile on their face.
Enjoy!
It was a dark January night. Draco was sitting on the edge of the astronomy tower. He looked out over the grounds of Hogwarts, thinking if he ever before saw the squid. Picturing himself walking to the black lake taking a dive and seeing the squid. Being grabbed by him and getting pulled to the great lakes bodem. To be left there and slowly letting the air escape from his lungs, watching as the air bubbles rise to the surface. Draco shakes his head as he comes out of his thoughts. He looks back to the lake, there must be other ways to kill himself right. To vanish in thing air. I mean nobody would miss him after all right. Somewhere a clock struck midnight and Draco stood up to go back to the dorms. He didn’t notice the feets sticking out under a to short invisibility cloak.
"And when no hope was left in sight on that stary, stary night. You took youre life as lovers often do"
Enjoy!
Draco was so mad. They fought for so long, days they would not speak to eachother. And nights they would cry themselfs to sleep. It was a though and hard time for both of them. Until one day Harry was fed up with it. he confronted Draco and they fought again. So bad that Harry ended there relationship. Harry felt his heart actually break. He felt the crack run to his heart, from top to bottem. Felt the grief run through his veins. Felt the loss in his bones. He didnt mean to say it, it blurped out. He sagged against the wall, tears running down his cheeks looking up at Draco. But he was gone. He felt heartbroken, but angry at the same time. He didnt want to speak to Draco, not now not ever. Thats what he tried to make himself belief. It was hard
"I married him" then Draco walks In and gives Harry a kiss on the cheek. Albus says "dad told me you were mean" and Draco would stare at Albus then at Harry and say "well I got the guy either way so"
The next morning Draco went straight to class. He had long stopped going to the great hall. He used to love the attention and stares. He didn’t anymore nor did he like food for that matter. He couldn’t even remember when the last time he eat, he mostly didn’t care what people thought about him though. He knows he messed up he knows he was on the wrong side. He just chose to ignore it. As he sat in the back of the class staring at the front he slowly starting to doze off, having had little to no sleep the night before. As he woke up, he noticed that class was over and that he slept through it all. He didn’t care, he would be gone soon anyway.
And Harry just falls more in love with him.
I can totaly see Draco cutting all Harry's photos out of the daily prophet. Making comments about his clothes and his hair. And Harry just watching from the kitchen, with the biggest grin on his face. Because damn how did he ever deserve such a guy as Draco?
I can imagine that when Draco and Harry are dating, Draco wants to keep it low. And Harry respect that. So when Draco says he's ready, Harry makes it really dramatic. That morning at breakfast, when Draco steps into the room. He calls Draco' s name, jumps over the table. And grabs Draco by the neck, and kisses him full on the mouth. And you can hear Blaise wisper to pansy "fucking finaly". And the entire great hall is silent.

I did have a lil flashback in here of Harry and Charlie's lil ~get together~ but it made the chapter way longer than I wanted it to be so I've decided to post it as a oneshot/aside kind of thing that you can read if you want but it's not really vital to anything else, just a bit of self-indulgent HP/CW because I love them (but just a lil snog and then a tactful ending because I've never written sexy stuff and I'm scared) so I'll post that at some point in the future if you wanna check that out when I do!

But that wasn’t possible. Because Malfoy had been sent to Azkaban. Because he was a Death Eater. Because Voldemort marked him.
‘Why do you think, love? Why do women not drink sometimes?’
‘Right, let's get you on the sofa and I’ll put the kettle on, yeah?’
‘Can I ask you a question?’
Come to think of it, the anniversary of the battle might just be why Potter seemed so out of it.
‘Well? Tell me everything! Is it just owls? Have you been meeting up?
‘Yes, what was I thinking? Boyfriend of the year award goes to you.’ Draco was deadpan, but Harry couldn’t fight the pleased blush that burned at the back of his neck. He took the hint, though, and soon there were occasional bunches of daisies and chrysanthemums and peonies interspersed with the chocolates and work visits.
Harry cringed, was he really so easy to read? Rather than meeting her steely gaze, Harry turned to concentrate on his godson and began helping him spoon the whipped cream from the top of his hot chocolate into his mouth.
Almost.

‘I hate how well you know me now.’
Harry’s eyes widened at this,
In fact he spent the following two weeks in a daze, numbly making his way through his paperwork, file after file, without really reading anything written on them. If he had been a muggle, you could’ve told him all about wizards and Voldemort and magic and he wouldn’t have heard a word. The only reason he managed to eat was Hermione’s insistence on popping into his office every lunchtime, dragging him to the canteen, and forcing him to buy enough for lunch and leftovers for dinner each day. Weekends were a tough spot, but she tag-teamed it with Ron and Ginny - as awkward as
‘Honestly, Potter,

, Harry apparated to the pub.
Ron let out a big boom of laughter, making both Harry and Hermione jump out of their seats.
‘What, Harry? No way, we’ve been friends forever. I think I’d know if he fancied anyone, let alone me.’
Harry felt like all the air had vanished from his lungs for the second time that day. As much as Ron had already reassured him that Draco had been nowhere near what had happened and whoever had been attacked, Harry knew he wouldn’t be able to believe it until he saw Draco for himself.
By the shaking of his head, Potter obviously had decided to continue ignoring all of Draco’s stellar flirting efforts.
The look in Malfoy’s eyes was one of confusion now. ‘What do you mean I don’t have to tell you? If I don’t you can get me thrown back in- into Azkaban.’
strong drink if he had any hopes of forgetting everything Potter had just said.
“Watching”, as it turned out, didn’t mean a play in the theatre, and was in reference to a muggle “film” that Potter programmed into the box he had called a “teevee”. It was all very odd and muggle and Draco had no idea what most of the words meant, but the film itself was most enjoyable; there were genies, sorcery, and an evil man who reminded him a lot of the Dark Lord.

Draco looked up at Potter again. The boy -

came floating over from where he was saunting towards them.
‘Noooo!’ Came the response. Draco chuckled, he should have expected his baby cousin to be just as difficult a child as the rest with Black blood flowing through their veins; it was practically a family trait.
‘I’m not really a party person,’
‘Oooh, Friday the 13th, Potter! Better watch out, a big bad death eater might come and bring you three pieces of bad luck!’ Draco strolled into the tiny restaurant Potter had chosen for this week's meeting, completely ignoring the host at the stand in favour of his chosen one and earnt himself glares from all involved.
So Harry won’t even think about it. Not here, and most definitely not now.
‘Good boy. Taking me out for food before I follow you home and let you ruin me of my innocence.’
‘Near Gringotts. Opposite end to Draco’s shop, mate.’ Of course Ron, brilliant best mate that he was, knew by now that Harry had no capabilities of processing anything other than Draco on a good day. Sixth year had been rough on everyone involved. Harry could’ve kissed him for pre-empting the Draco-worry. He didn’t, though, because, well, Draco.

Waving at Ron in an attempt to quiet him down a few decibels -
‘Anyway. Harry. How’s Malfoy been this week?’ She asked, raising her eyebrows expectantly at him.
‘I thought we could have our meeting in the kitchen if that's alright with you?’
Was it too much to ask for someone to look at him like that?
He was the Saviour, the Boy Who Lived to Kill the Dark Lord, it was programmed into his existence via said famous scar to be a dark wizard catcher.
‘No can do, mate, I already went to Robards and he said it was signed off by Kingsley too. Saw him come out of a meeting with Robards just before I went in actually.’ Harry turned to look at Hermione at this: she still looked guilty at this, and wasn’t meeting Harry’s eye.
‘Mate, we know,’ Harry had never seen a bigger smile on Ron’s face.
Harry made his way over to the table Draco had chosen and placed both mugs on the table, before pulling back the chair opposite Draco and sitting down.
Draco cleared his throat. ‘Well, all that’s left to do is for you to pay… so…’
And with that, Malfoy stood,
Did Potter even like boys?
Hermione put her coffee back down onto the table, look of joy now one of stern confusion on her face. ‘Why the fuck did you not say it back, Harry James?’
‘No.’
‘Oh.’ Was all Harry managed to say. Draco was going to have to cancel their date.
well for Harry Potter.
‘What do you think you’re going to achieve by all this yelling, hey?’
‘And you’re going to go?!’ Hermione screeched at him, and for a split second Harry pitied their unborn child; Hermione was sure to be the strictest mother he would ever know.
Luckily for him, the tell-tale silver platinum of Draco’s hair would stick out anywhere, and drew Harry to it like a moth to a flame.
!’ Hermione interrupted him again, her expression was verging on murderous and Harry was absolutely almost terrified.
Draco blinked, completely shocked at the surprise turn of conversation. Recovering quickly, Draco switched back on the teasing smirk.
Potter blushed the most
, the better.
‘No contact. No. Should I have been?’
‘Hmm, bad… breakup?’
‘Sure. Right away.’
‘Knowing her you’ll have seven? Eight?’
‘Do you really think I can’t tell when you’re lost thinking about something?’
‘But that still doesn’t mean I don’t forgive you for going behind my back and not at least warning me about it, Mione!’ Harry finished, rounding off on her.
‘Potter offered, mum! It would’ve been more rude to snub him and leave. You raised me better than that.’ Draco knew that bringing up the countless lessons in societal niceties that he had been subjected to - not to mention the doddery old Mister Twyford who came with them - was a bit of a low blow, and a particularly daring move to partake in whilst drunk and Narcissa was already royally pissed at him.

A small smile grew on Malfoy’s face at that, and Harry decisively did not examine the loops his stomach had started doing at the sight.
Draco blinked. That was a new one, and it succeeded in distracting him completely from all internal Potter musings. Was the Ministry having issues with some of the old crowd? Were they not all locked up nice and tight in Az-

Malfoy had decided to flirt with him) and making Harry uncomfortable. The cloud cleared and that was all Harry knew, he just hoped no one else had noticed the coincidence, he wasn’t sure quite how to explain it just yet.
‘You alright? I’m not hurting you am I?’ His eyes were filled with an emotion indiscernible for Harry.
‘Sorry, Azkaban?’
So they continued their easy intimacy, their fake relationship, on their weekly shops. Harry would pick out the veg with one hand, and keep a firm hold of Draco’s hand with the other.
‘Oh, cheers, mate,’
‘Alright, alright, no need to get your frilly knickers in a twist,’ Malfoy chuckled,
‘Of course I bloody didn’t!’
Draco sighed. The new rotations at the prison now meant that visits from P would be few and far between; Draco was only thankful that he had managed to set up mobile telephone communication as soon as he’d been released so that he still had

that’s what he just said.
‘Really?’
‘I guess you could call me that.’
‘What? You’re inviting me? To a party?’
Harry blinked. ‘It’s, er, private.’ He cringed inwardly, could this day get any worse?
It was also ten minutes before he was late to pub night with Ron and Hermione.

‘Of course, you know you don’t need to convince me to spend time with Teddy. Although he might be quite bored if I’m sat in meetings and doing paperwork the whole time.’
The time it took to get from his and his mother’s tiny house, to the ministry, down to Potter’s office, and sitting in the chair opposite him, passed by in a flash and Draco’s not entirely sure he could remember how he did any of it.
So, of course, that’s exactly what Draco did.

Of course, Harry wasn’t blind. As soon as he’d figured out he was bi, he’d realised that the reason behind what had felt like pure hatred towards the boy whilst they’d been in school had really been rather thinly veiled attraction on his part.
It had taken Harry by surprise at first, seeing Draco look so natural and normal in a muggle setting, way back when they’d first got a flat together. Ron had joined them back then, taking up what would become Draco’s personal library. Because the git
idea that is.’ It was only Harry’s years of training from being Draco’s best friend that meant he could see through the cracks in Draco’s mask. Draco was… nervous?
‘It’s like I said Head Auror Robards: if you want me to be an Auror then you have to put me through the same training as every other person applying for the same job. I won’t be treated any differently just because of a scar on my forehead and a lucky shot with a disarming spell.’ Harry replied, just as calmly as the first (and second, and third, and fifteenth) time he had explained his decision over the past couple of weeks.
‘How can I not? His mum insisted apparently, and she saved my life!’
‘After the incidents with McLaggan and Thorpe, yes,’ Hermione interrupted.
‘Ohohoo, not very friendly, are we? What happened, sweetheart? Bad Valentine’s date?’
‘You’re not in any pain are you? I’m not hurting you?’ There were those eyes again.
of her crazy from Azkaban). That being said, the more Narcissa paced the tiny kitchen and rambled to herself about how much of an opportunity this was, the more Draco felt inclined to agree with her. After his treatment in Azkaban, it was no surprise to him that the rest of the Aurors would still see him as nothing more than a filthy Death Eater, just like his father, and loyal servant to the Dark Lord. Potter was the only one who would give him the benefit of the doubt, and try to get him through his probation period with as little disruption as possible. He had even been the one in the meeting to request that
Hermione’s cheeks pinked. ‘Yep.’ She popped the “p”.
‘Eloquent as always, Mister Malfoy.’ Potter replied, a smirk on his lips but his eyes wide and cautious, echoing the phrasing that Draco so often loved to taunt him with, like he was afraid of what Draco would think of him.
‘Have you taken out a new potion prescription without informing your parole officer beforehand?’
‘Yes, my sister and I have had many a discussion about the young men we look after,’ she shot him a suspicious looking side-eye as she mopped up the mess Teddy had made with the last of his hot chocolate, ‘and we’ve both decided that it would be much better for them in the long run if they learnt to move on from past mistakes.’
‘Piss off, Malfoy,’

Taking a deep breath to sooth his own nerves, Harry nodded. ‘Yes. It was a date. Or, I’d like it to have been.’
How could Draco have just gone and kissed him? Didn’t he realise how messed up that would be? Harry was his parole officer, for Merlin’s sake! Harry blamed the fire whiskey. They’d both been drinking and singing along and dancing to Teddy’s film, and it had been weird and intimate and they’d been carried away with it.
When Harry was sixteen years old, he almost killed his worst enemy.

Not least because Malfoy was his parolee, his charge, his bloody childhood rival for Merlin’s sake! But right there, bubbling merrily away on the surface, was such an intense want - a
But Hermione just reached across the table and patted his hand. ‘Just make sure he knows he can trust you. He can trust you, right?’
‘Yeah,’ Potter breathed, when he looked up his green eyes were shining, ‘it’s incredible.’
Harry, honestly, had been wondering the same thing. True, it wasn’t their “first” Christmas, as they’d been friends for the better part of a decade, and known each other for the better part of two. But they hadn’t mentioned anything to their friends and family about their relationship being fake, so wouldn’t everyone be expecting them to coordinate celebrations this year? Would Mrs Weasley finally knit him one of her famous jumpers and accept that he and Harry were friends? Would Harry be expected to attend a way-too-formal meal at Malfoy Manor, and make polite conversation with - ugh - Lucius Malfoy? Would-
He just didn’t think he had anyone like that left in his life.
‘Not bloody likely.’
as soon as they had.
‘Oh, sorry.’ Draco looked up. ‘I assumed you’d want to go over chemistry over anything else? Since we’re both in that. Shit, sorry, you wanted to just do our own stuff didn’t you?’
‘Just don’t. I know what you’ll say and what you want me to say back and I
Harry grinned. ‘Is that a yes?’
Silence.
Judging by the look on Potter’s face though, he hadn’t expected to be accused of any such thing, and the thought of flirting with Draco had obviously disgusted him a little bit. And wasn’t
Harry drew in a sharp breath. With Ron’s countless anecdotes of George and the shop, he’d almost managed to forget about what had him so riled up before he came out, almost forgot the horrors of Draco Malfoy
. On Diagon Alley. You’ve probably seen him around.’ Potter’s cheeks were pink, and he spoke in the smallest voice, looking down at his lap.
In fact,
Sighing to himself, Harry gave a small smile. ‘No, chemistry is great. Good thing you brought all your stuff, I’ll need to share.’
Harry scoffed as he threw the paper onto the table. Yet another sensationalist headline following Harry’s new “mystery girlfriend” (read: the nice woman he’d asked to move a step to the side in the vegetable aisle so he could reach the potatoes).
With a sharp
Draco cleared his throat. ‘Listen, Potter…’ he began, but once he’d started he realised he had no idea where that sentence would end up. If Potter would even want to talk to a
But Draco chose to ignore all that. Right now he had to comfort Potter, comfort
Potter blushed furiously at this, Draco was pleased to see. He’d decided on playing a new, decidedly enjoyable game he had come up with, one that involved exciting an exact combination of (what he hoped was) arousal and fury in one Harry James Potter, and Draco was - unsurprisingly - the most qualified player.
And Harry truly was happy for her. He knew how it felt to be stuck with no family (or, no family worth mentioning, anyway), and as much as the Malfoy name wasn’t worth a knut anymore, Narcissa and Draco were Blacks by blood, and had just as much claim to the name as Andi did as a Tonks.
Harry was snapped out of his thoughts by Kingsley yanking the door open again, winking at Harry, and then marching straight past before Harry could even think the word “quidditch”.
comments/kudos appreciated as always and I will work very hard to not wait such a long time before updating again xoxo
But then there had been that kiss on Friday night, and Harry knew that if Draco hadn’t caught him so much by surprise then there was the possibility that he might have reciprocated on instinct. But this was
‘Oh. That makes more sense I guess.’ Harry’s voice trailed off towards the end, and he looked down at his feet. Every mention of Malfoy being in Azkaban brought waves of guilt with it; he hadn’t done enough, should’ve worked harder to keep him out, should’ve thrown his name around to get the sentence reduced to house arrest instead.
‘Alright, you said “everything would go wrong”, and that’s basically the same thing for you.’
‘Well. Great. Good for you, Potter. If that’s all you needed then I guess I should… go?’
‘Because, Auror Potter, I said so. Any further grievances you have with the way I have assigned paroles can be taken up with the office of the Minister for Magic.’
‘No I know, I- sorry, just sounds a lot like... Well nevermind I guess.’ He trailed off,
Mione had already hinted about some shit that had gone down during the three years Draco had been in Azkaban, and this Patch bloke had been so overprotective of Draco, it was like he was reacting on instinct, from past experience of something bad happening to Draco. But Patch had only met Draco whilst he’d been in Azkaban, so it must have happened there.
Silence.

‘Yes dear, and I’m afraid I have to insist on this occasion. That boy has been doing wonders for you without you even noticing it and I simply
Harry rocked backwards and forwards on his heels, hands clasped together in front of him. The witch - Janice - was watching him as he did so, her eyes narrowed slightly and her arms across her chest as she began to file her nails. Harry could just

now, am I?’ Charlie teased, smirking at Harry.
The previous weekend had passed in a blur of takeaways, coffee, and homework, all working their hardest to distract Harry from how utterly miserable the prospect of going back to the Ministry on Monday morning was, but all too soon Harry was back to stumbling out of one of the fireplaces in the atrium.
Malfoy sneered. Ah,
And, for the first time since it had happened, Draco wasn’t alone and in prison when the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts came around.
‘You’re welcome, sweetheart.’ Draco shot a smirk at him and sent a cheeky wink.
‘Can you do that or not? It’s either you have your meeting in my flat, or have it with another auror like McLaggan or Thorpe and we both know you wouldn’t want that now, would you?’
‘Once I finish up the ink, I’ll cast the charms that make it into a proper wizarding tattoo, giving it movement and tuning it into your emotions and all that. That’s why the charms need time to settle, like Eddie said before? They’re tuned into each witch or wizard’s magical core.’
‘Holy shit. You’re pregnant.’
, Malfoy’s do not jump, especially not a mile), Draco dropped Potter’s wrist with a small yelp - a sound that he would never admit to making - cleared his throat and turned back around to face Edward.
But Ron and Hermione - having lifted her head from the table, finally -  were both just looking at him, mouths open, as he rambled on.
best friends. You’re both going to be the best parents and this baby will be so loved. I’m so happy for you both. Cheers!’
When Harry was eleven years, one month, and one day old, his worst enemy was the poncy, pointy-looking git who’d insulted his new friend Ron.
And with that, Draco walked away, not caring if Potter followed or stayed in that corner or left the house. Draco just knew he had to walk far
Harry huffed at them both. ‘Right, well if you’re both just going to make fun then I won’t tell you all about

‘Have you taken any illegal potions?’
‘No.’
, and it’s no one’s place to tell you but his, but you need to be careful with him and his trust. ’
Sam’s eyes flicked to the floor in a mock submission, Harry didn’t believe the show for a single second. ‘I know, and I’m sorry.’
‘Alright, fine!’ He raised his hands up in surrender, ‘it’s all been going fine, honestly! But we had our meeting yesterday and - you know I put in a request with Kinsley and Robards to have the outside of the ministry? -’
There wasn’t a chance that he’d let Potter see just how much his lack of reaction had hurt, though.
with his fiancée. And, the little known fact - known to no one but the two involved - Ron wouldn’t have caught them at
He sighed. ‘Look, Potter. Thanks for coming and helping me save face with my mother. Especially after… what happened.’ Potter pulled a face at that, as if he couldn’t quite believe that Draco had remembered it - that it was real - let alone that Draco had actually, consciously brought it up.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh out loud at that. Even at the ripe old age of twenty one, with a house, a wife, and a baby on the way, Ronald Bilius Weasley still operated on a payment service of sweets and chocolate. Harry understood though, as much as they had all warmed up to Malfoy over the past few months, he was still a massive git.
in his cell. His hair had been long and dirty, his face a sallow yellow colour, and gaunt, with the skin sagging over his once proud and prominent cheekbones. It had reminded Harry of the pictures the
‘Don’t act so innocent, Potter. This has always happened. Ever since the trials. Every time I set foot in the ministry, someone comes up, wand blazing, and let’s me know exactly how much of a worthless, evil piece of dirt death eater I am. It's why I'm always late.’
Harry was determined for there to be no doubts in anyone’s mind that this would be a Romantic Evening. He had lit candles and tried to place them naturally around the room, and had made the pizza himself (although the edges were most likely to get singed in the oven if Harry had all responsibility, but he hoped Draco wouldn’t mind).
Or did Potter want this too?
‘Not bloody likely.’
But when said snooty gaze is coming from the eyes of the man who kissed you last week, a fact which Harry had successfully managed to ignore up until this silence, it suddenly became a whole lot more awkward.
Maybe he could flirt with Potter again? It seemed to work before last Friday, so Draco couldn’t see any reason why it wouldn’t work
his dirt-coffee, he settled for an attempt at absorbing the caffeine via inhalation, as though he could somehow receive the energy required for a Ministry Monday Morning through osmosis.
, Harry knew that if Lucius could see his son now he’d faint from shock. His long legs were encased in black skinny jeans so tight it looked like they’d been sprayed onto him, his top half was clothed in an equally tight white t-shirt that hugged him everywhere in the best way, he had a deliciate, silver chain around his neck, and huge black combat boots on his feet. The black leather jacket, of course, what else? had been shrugged over the back of his chair upon arrival. But what struck Harry most, what he couldn’t seem to tear his eyes away from, were the
‘There’s only so much skele-gro and chocolate frogs can mend. The kind of scars I got in Azkaban? You can’t see them, but I feel them. Every second of every day.’
because there was nothing to catch.
‘Well, don't you just look like the bee’s knees?’ He looked Potter up… and down. Slowly.
‘Listen… Potter. I was wondering if-’
. Calling Malfoy,
Draco scowled at that. How dare Potter throw that back in his face? It hadn’t been
‘I was really hoping you’d say that, H,’ Draco said, with a small smile at Harry.
Bloodthirsty journalists and paparazzi followed his every move, criticised every word he spoke, and believed themselves entitled to his every thought, just because he had the audacity to step up to the plate when no competent adult felt brave enough. Harry hadn’t left his home (if you could even call Grimmauld Place a
In a movement so slight, if Harry had blinked he’d have missed it, Malfoy turned his head to the side and curled his lip in the recognition of who’s office he was apparently in, ‘Well, well, well… long time no see, Potter. The trials, if I’m not mistaken?’
There was an indifferent sneer on Draco’s face at the sight of Harry, and it made his heart squeeze in a painful way.
If Malfoy hadn’t refused to identify him, Harry would be dead. He owed his own worst enemy a life debt now.
Maybe he could embarrass Potter by asking if he wanted to go for a drink? He seemed to have been responding fairly well when Draco had attempted it last Friday, when they’d been able to relax with young Edward and then share a fire whiskey. It had only been Draco’s surprise attack of a misguided kiss that had resulted in their remaining interactions being so awkward, he wouldn’t be trying it again, that’s for sure.
. And besides, Liam was an old family friend, no need for Harry to get jealous over nothing. Not that Draco was exactly sure of a reason Harry could have been jealous to begin with.
, dragged Harry down the book aisle to browse the latest two-for-eight-pounds deals of muggle novels to read whilst he made his way through box after box of muggle tea.
Charlie was giving him that smug little smile again, but Harry had no idea who he could be talking about. Other than himself, of course, and they both knew that the romantic side to their relationship had started and ended on that night two years previously. Despite the love they felt for each other, there were no deep feelings. Besides, Charlie lived in Romania for ten months out of the year and there was no way Harry was going to relocate.
A massive git who had kissed Harry yesterday.
So much for a first date.
‘Y’know, you’re starting to show me up to Hermione, mate. If you and Malfoy weren’t so bloody sweet about it, I’d be getting royally pissed off.’
‘Yes, papa, yes! I promise!’
‘Is that all?’ Draco asked, ‘can I go?’
? Your bit is done and dusted mate, surely even your thick skull can understand that.’
There was categorically no way that Harry fancied anything to do with Draco sodding Malfoy.
The man in front of him was certainly no longer the boy that Harry remembered from Hogwarts. The frame of his body wasn’t quite so lean; it was more…
‘Harry, over here!’
‘For your party, dragon. He is invited, is he not? You did give him the invitation?’
Only a few days later, Harry found himself sandwiched between Ron and Draco and the rest of their friends, ready for the film, Draco had so desperately wanted to see, to start. His sitting next to Draco was the only consolation for this, yet again,
‘Not quite… I’ve managed to convince Robards to let me work for the hour of our meeting, even though I’m on leave to spend some time with Teddy, but if you’re up for it Robards has said it’s fine if we meet in my, erm, flat?’
? It was Draco’s turn to narrow his eyes now, where had that bloody come from? It seemed that Potter had noticed his slip up, too, if the attractive light dusting of pink across his cheeks was anything to go by.
‘Oh really, could’ve had me fooled.’
If Andromeda could have fluttered her eyelashes like a schoolgirl to convince him here, Harry was sure she would have. Luckily for them both, Harry needed no convincing when it came to spending time with his godson.
Draco strode towards a (very tall, very broad, very handsome) man at the other end of the aisle they were currently in, and tackled him into a hug. Both of them were grinning wildly, Harry was not.
Draco could have murdered Patch. At least, he would have, if he hadn’t already been on parole for being a Death Eater and his parole officer hadn’t been standing right next to him.
Because in the end, Harry’s only worst enemy was his own oblivious to all the brilliance he’d had right in front of him all along. Thank the gods he’d had Draco to help him realise it all.
of eight-year. Despite Headmistress McGonnagall’s best efforts at inter-house unity and Hermione’s assurances in her letters that they ‘really were trying, honest!’, Harry knew that a certain green and silver house had been neatly forgotten by everyone else.

Excusing himself, Harry made for the back kitchen door, to sit on the step and cool his ruddied cheeks on the early summer breeze. He managed to enjoy it for all of five minutes before his peace was, inevitably in the Burrow, interrupted.
! He couldn’t like him! He was a class A git, pain to be around, and altogether a pain in the arse. No other feelings involved here, thankyouverymuch.

He didn’t understand: how could he not even fear Voldemort? The man who killed his parents and all but decimated the wizarding world? Then he was faced with hundreds of dementors and nearly had his soul sucked out (along with his godfathers), and he understood. Listening to the last moments of his parents’ lives, and then their deaths, was enough to realise he wasn’t

at him?
When he came back into the room, Potter handed Draco a rather full tumbler of whiskey. Raising his eyebrows at the brunet, Draco took a sip.
But that was just it, wasn’t it.
Harry knew that any other parole officer would have reprimanded Malfoy long before now, and he probably would have been back in Azkaban already. But he remembered the reasoning Hermione had had behind assigning Malfoy to him, took a deep breath, and set about writing up the paperwork for the meeting already, keeping a watchful eye on his charge and his godson. Only half an hour to go before he could legally tell Malfoy to piss right off.
Harry appeared in the middle of Diagon Alley, completely disregarding the official Apparition points and swells of disgruntled shoppers around him. Before him: Slug and Jigger, apothecary, Draco’s place of work. The place Draco had been spending more and more time since his… confession. Harry had tried not to think about how Draco had been so obviously avoiding him; it had hurt more than anything, and now Harry knew why.
Harry hummed in agreement and took another sip of his drink. ‘I’d like to be. Sometimes it feels like you lot are the only people who might see me that way.’
! If you have to know, I was seeing this guy who I thought was really nice but it turns out he’s a massive creep and only fancied me for my name and my scar and now I have to find a new coffee shop.’
‘You’re a Mind Healer?’
‘Oh. Thanks.’ More blushing.
‘Once I finish up the ink, I’ll cast the charms that make it into a proper wizarding tattoo, giving it movement and tuning it into your emotions and all that. That’s why the charms need time to settle, like Eddie said before? They’re tuned into each witch or wizard’s magical core.’

Sensing a prickle of discomfort in Potter from his charms, Draco thought best to steer away from the design; ‘No shit, Potter, the inside of one’s wrist is a very private place.’ His eyes flickered back up to Potter’s again, spotting them locked onto his once more, wide open and unreadable.

He remembered him from the robe shop on his eleventh birthday. Malfoy hadn’t been too bad then - if a little stuck-up - but Harry had been treated like dirt enough to know it was the right thing to stick up for others being treated like dirt.

He definitely didn’t want to admit that he wanted to trace over the ink and possibly see whatever else Malfoy had, not to mention the rest of the dragon over his shoulder. Definitely not.

particularly uncomfortable afternoon.
‘You’re my best friend, of course I care.’ Harry couldn’t understand why Draco was being so weird. He’d had a rough day with being attacked though, so Harry wouldn’t mention it until at least tomorrow, but he was definitely being… odd. Then, of course, there was the groan Draco had made upon hearing Harry’s reply. ‘What! What the hell is wrong?’
Draco blinked. ‘No contact. No. Should I have been?’
‘No. No… I’m fine,’ Harry responded quickly, a little too quickly for his liking but Malfoy hadn’t seemed to notice. Instead, he reached for some kind of cloth to wipe Harry’s wrist down. Harry tried not to shiver at the touch of Malfoy’s cool fingers on his now highly sensitive wrist.
‘There are plenty of others who see you that way, Harry. I promise you that.’

In this chapter we find out more of what happened to Draco in Azkaban, and the horrors that he was subjected to. I, thankfully, have no personal experience with this myself other than a few instances of minor catcalling/harassment/above the clothes groping before I was old enough to realise the true extent of how horrific this behaviour is, so in the whole of this story I WILL NOT go into masses of detail.
‘Not quite.’ Draco put down the squirming toddler in the midst of his Lego bricks and turned to face Potter, holding his hand out. ‘Give me your hand.’
Harry cast an eye around Robards’ office, taking in the books, the wall full of meticulously organised cases files, the few scattered instruments that Harry recognised as the same types of dark wizard detectors as Mad-Eye Moody had stuffed his office with during Harry’s fourth year.
‘Oh sweetheart, how could I have denied it any longer?’ Draco fluttered his eyelashes at him.
‘Listen, Potter… before I leave… mother is insisting on having a small get together at our house in Kensington this weekend and she seems to think that you being my parole officer is a good reason to invite you.’
Draco looked down at the thick, creamy envelope that was now in his hands; his mother had been sending them out for a few weeks now, insisting that his first birthday without the threat of any dark lords or controlling fathers (or prison) was one to celebrate. Draco couldn’t even begin to think who she might have thought it suitable to invite. Or who would even care enough about a

Harry sucked in a breath. ‘Could they not have fixed it?’
Harry took a sip of his drink for something else to do, and finished it off.
‘-and we ended up having a couple of drinks, yeah? And then- well. I’m not really sure how it happened, but he kissed me?’
‘Alright there, mate?’ Ron asked.
Harry did not like the way that this “Patch” kept laughing at him. Harry wasn’t a particularly funny person these days, and he wasn’t trying to crack any jokes so he certainly wasn’t laughing
‘Malfoy’s do not take kindly to others attempting to embarrass them, Potter, you’d think all of our years at school would have led you to remember that.’
And with that, Harry choked a laugh, downed the rest of his butterbeer and tried not to let Ron see the tears threatening to fall. Harry left the pub, waving a goodbye to Rosmerta and the rest of the eighth years, and apparated away the second he reached a dark enough alleyway, completely missing the resigned, worried look Ron gave him, watching him the whole way.

, Harry willed himself. Focusing on blue eyes instead of grey, dirty blond hair instead of platinum, small and slight instead of long and lean. If he concentrated hard enough, Harry could almost convince himself. Almost.
‘Do you maybe fancy going for dinner sometime? With me?’
The sleeve on his left arm was what made Harry stare the most though. There was, of course, the Dark Mark pride of place in the centre of his forearm, but instead of the pulsating black it had been when Harry had glimpsed it on top of the astronomy tower back in sixth year, it was grey and faded and almost blurry around the edges. Malfoy had decorated and partially covered it by surrounding it with flowers. Narcissus, pansies, roses, forget-me-nots and even a singular lily right at the bottom (which made Harry feel something quite indiscernible to think about why he would possibly have chosen that), all in such bright vibrant colours that the grey of the Dark Mark faded into almost nothing. Along the rest of Malfoy’s arm were seemingly random pieces of ink, all overlapping but not covering each other; a snitch was flying around some Quidditch goalposts on him inner bicep, a great mass of fire in the shape of a snake curling its way down from his shoulder periodically, and a series of moon cycles and stars set out in various constellations scattered along the top of his forearm.
‘NO! Just - ugh!’ Harry groaned in frustration, pulling at his hair. How was Malfoy still able to get under his skin so quickly, so effectively, after all this time? Taking a deep breath, he continued much more calmly. ‘Please Malfoy, tell me about this job you’ve got.’
Potter lost some of his air at that, letting out a breath of what seemed like an entire lung. ‘You’re not worthless, or evil, or a piece of dirt. And you might have the mark but you were never a death eater, Malfoy.’ He was speaking in a tiny voice now. ‘I had no idea this had been happening.’
Harry wasn’t expecting that - to be known to someone as Malfoy’s childhood rival rather than
(‘No, Harry, it
‘Okay… have you taken any illegal potions?’ Potter continued, having seemingly not noticed the minor mental breakdown Draco was having over the sight of his fresh tattoo.

, his brain helpfully supplied.
Potter sneered in response, but it was half-hearted and Draco could see no real malice behind it. Draco hadn’t seen real malice behind anything Potter had done or said to him since he’d comforted him after the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts. It wasn’t… awful. But it meant Draco had had to work extra hard to ignore all feelings and emotions. Obviously that had all gone out of the window now.
‘So.’ Ron slid the bottle of butterbeer over to him, as well as a shot of firewhiskey, which Harry promptly downed. ‘You will not believe who Minnie’s got teaching Defence this year,
Harry cleared his throat and Malfoy almost jumped out of his skin.
‘Now we know why you had to move out, Ron. Those two have obviously been pining after each other all these years.’
‘Knowing her you’ll have seven? Eight?’
‘Right. Well, I’ll make us a cuppa, shall I?’
‘What? No, no, no, I didn’t expect that I promise, I guess I just got a bit lost in my own head. I’m sorry, please, tell me more?’
Potter blushed the most adorable shade of red.
Taking a deep breath, Harry strode up to the apothecary and tore the door open. There were only a few people inside, a couple of customers and a couple of potioneers, but everyone turned around at the noise.
When Harry was ten years old, his worst enemy was his Uncle Vernon.
Harry sat bolt upright at that. ‘Um, what?’ He squeaked.
, Chosen One, Boy Who Lived Twice. All that bullshit.
At Draco’s nod, Harry busied himself with the familiar routine of making tea to Draco’s standard. Making sure the tea steeped for exactly the right length of time, adding the exact amount of milk, all in his favourite mug. In contrast, Harry couldn’t have given less of a shit about his own mug of tea. Hell, his mug even had a chip in the side.
‘Oh. That. Yeah, I- er- I saw. Just not interested in them. I thought that was obvious.’
And he really was

was one of his favourite places.
pregnant (pregnant!), but he’d tried with Ginny who was near enough a best friend, right? And Harry loved her, he really did, but after the end of it all he just couldn’t shake that it felt more like having sex with a sister rather than a girlfriend, and he was glad they’d stopped
He knew he was excited, this was his first actual proper date in a year and a half! And it’s not like Sam wasn’t easy on the eyes, with his bright blue eyes, and his soft, floppy blond hair.
yet - his first magical tattoo. Two weeks since Draco had acknowledged he found Potter attractive, since he’d realised he was maybe slightly attracted to Potter. Two weeks of his most impressive flirting techniques as a way to try and ignore that his feelings were maybe a little bit more sincere than he wanted to admit. Getting a rise out of Potter was familiar territory, he felt comfortable in it. It was, arguably, the source of the better memories of his time at Hogwarts.
. Some dust must have got into my eye when those jokes of colleagues of yours shot those several stinging jinxes. On the arse, I might add. Usually I wouldn’t mind, but it’s not the
‘Unca Dray! Unca Dray!’ was the only response, and Draco wasn’t sure if it was good or bad.
Let it be known that Narcissa Malfoy was not one to be rendered speechless by just anything, her upbringing and good breeding had seen to it that there was always the perfect response, perfect retort, brewing away in her mind. It’s what made her such a skilled conversationalist at dinner parties for all those years.
Harry scoffed at this; it wasn’t like he’d actually sat his N.E.W.T.s, what with the whole Battle of Hogwarts and fight for the wizarding world had been going on (and then the Death Eater trials, which Harry had
‘Erm, fine. Nothing to report.’
It was Draco’s turn to look confused now, but he shook his head, as if shaking the thoughts free from his mind. Harry had always admired that about Draco, his ability to adapt and evolve his own thoughts around a conversation, accepting information and changes at face value without objecting.
His eyes snapped back up to Patch, his sharp blue eyes filled with kindness and understanding, as if he knew exactly what was going through Harry’s mind. With a start, he realised that his eyes had begun to sting, tears forming in the corners. Harry swiped at his eyes, not wanting Patch, this stranger, Malfoy’s…
Malfoy smirked again, before pulling out what looked suspiciously like a-
‘Look, Harry. You know I’ll always love you - alright, pipe down, you git - and you’ll always be a part of this family. So what if it takes you a little bit longer than Ron or Ginny or even bloody Percy to find someone you want to be with? Believe me, Percy was such a tosser that no one could have seen someone as nice as Audrey coming along, but she did and now they’ve been married a year.’
Potter sighed, ‘what gave me away?’
Draco let his head fall back down onto the sofa, wincing and holding his ribs as he did so. ‘Do you remember the day you first got me to go along with this ridiculous scheme? How much I thought it was a terrible idea?’
‘Seamus wai-’ Harry began, but it was too late. Draco, Dean, and Seamus were already making plans to go and see the movie, and inviting the rest of their friends.
!’ that he didn’t think Harry had heard. It was odd, Harry had said that he was free the whole day and wanted to spend some time with Draco, where had this mystery “thing” come from? Was he just trying to get away from him?
Draco pursed his lips at him, as if he was contemplating the secrets of the universe, rather than the very easy proposal of being Harry’s fake boyfriend.
‘Oh, sweetheart, I do so love the pet names you’ve got for me.’
‘What?’
‘So don’t believe me, Potter. See if I give a shit about it. Send me back to Azkaban for it if you really want.’ Harry looked up at that, something about Malfoy’s tone seemed dejected.
Spotting the parlour, just where Florean Fortesque’s had been, just like Malfoy had said, Harry’s legs seemed to stop working of their own free will. Harry frowned down at his feet.
. It seemed like every inch of Malfoy’s arms were covered in them, and Harry was suddenly very grateful that Malfoy hadn’t decided on a long sleeved top when he got dressed this morning. Harry could even see the tips of a couple of tattoos curling around Malfoy’s neck, and all of a sudden he wanted nothing more in the world than to see exactly where they led to.
‘Don’t be obtuse, dear. It’s an invitation, of course!’ Narcissa smirked at him. As much as Draco had spent his entire life (until he was sixteen, that is) looking up to and copying his father, it was his mother that he imitated most; it was a fact that P
Malfoy was still wearing his muggle clothing, this time opting for some (slightly baggier, but still skin-tight) ripped black jeans, and a greying Harley Davidson t-shirt which matched so spectacularly with the leather jacket and combat boots it almost hurt Harry’s eyes. The t-shirt also happened to be short sleeved again, leaving the details of Malfoy’s tattooed left arm exposed for all to see, and on the slightly baggier side, meaning the neckline came down a bit lower than it had before and showing some more wisps of tattoos as they moved, brushing Malfoy’s neck. It looked to Harry like the tip of a tail, but he couldn’t be too sure.
‘Oh,’ Harry glanced down at his mocha, ‘er, yeah I’m done. Thanks.’

Ron, as impeccably timed as ever, distracted him completely by handing him another beer, and promptly swapping the topic of Harry’s train of thought from one Malfoy to another.
Sam sat down in the seat opposite him and took a sip of his own drink.
Of course.
‘G’night, mum.’

‘Fully? I was under the impression that you had to complete your parole training to gain that title.’
But then the next morning began the coffee deliveries.
‘All ratty little redheads. Bet you love that don’t you, Potter-’
. And yes I have, thank you,’ he added, almost as an afterthought.
When Harry was eleven years old, his worst enemy was the evil wizard that man Hagrid said had killed his parents when he was a baby.
Draco cleared his throat. ‘Potter, I’m not trying to be insensitive, but if you just hand over your paperwork I can fill it in myself. You don’t even need to look at it. Or me. I understand that looking at a death eater will likely make this mood of yours worse, but I’ll be the one in trouble if you don’t write up what you’re supposed to.’

‘Brill. I made up some pizzas, we just need to put them in the oven when we’re ready.’
Harry was quiet, brows furrowed as he thought it all through. It made sense, pieces were clicking into place; the phone calls with this mysterious family friend, the fact that they were
The voice of his godson broke him out of his train of thought. Harry smiled down at Teddy, before focusing back on the film to see which song they were up to now. It was “One Jump Ahead”, Aladdin was jumping through the streets to escape the guards; Teddy’s
Come to think of it,
Harry had had the plan to just take Draco for a relaxed walk around town, maybe dip into a few shops - there was a bookshop that Harry knew was Draco’s favourite - and maybe their hands would meet in the middle and brush up against each other. He’d decided that the other two attempts were too out there, and he needed to start with something else, something small to take off any pressure.
‘How do you fancy... maybe... goigfodinersotim?’
‘Right, of course,’ he settled on, hoping his general unease and confusion was lost on the two men infront of him, but judging by the way Malfoy was now narrowing his eyes and turning up the corner of his mouth ever so slightly, he wasn’t sure he’d completely got away with it.
Sam rolled his eyes in response, ‘I don’t know who told you such blasphemous lies, but they’re wrong.’

‘Oh come on, you know I know I’m your favourite,’ Harry teased.
Because Harry knew, deep,
Being as gentle as he could be, Draco took the wrapping and encased Potter’s wrist completely. Whilst the stag had been charmed, it wouldn’t be able to make it’s way beyond the wrist before being fully healed, but it could still circle the wrist if it so desired.
‘Wh- where are you going?’ said Potter, breathlessly, still wiping tears from his eyes from his oh-so-funny fit of laughter.
As if Draco hadn’t had just as terrible a week as a result. How could he forget that
With a click, Malfoy hung up the phone and turned around. Shock filled his eyes as he caught sight of Harry, quickly displaced by wariness. But
But Harry just stared back at him blankly, actually he

The pair walked up to the counter and had a look at the menu. Harry looked over at Draco out of the corner of his eye.
‘No no! Mister Potter, no need to do that. Draco here was just having a little practical joke, weren’t you, Draco?’ The man laughed and gave Malfoy such a pointed look that Harry was sure he’d have been scared of if he’d been on the receiving end, auror training or not.
‘… and so, of course, mother and I decided that it was high time to change our names legally. Put the whole Malfoy line and its reputation behind us and start fresh.’ Well if
think that I’d miss your birthday?’
Potter looked utterly confused as to why his mother would want him there, and Draco couldn’t find it within himself to sneer at his complete Gryffindor idiocy; he’d be confused too if it was the other way around. However, there also seemed to be a hint of… what was that? Disappointment? What could the great Chosen One possibly have to be disappointed about with this? The fact that he had not caused Draco’s misery directly?
‘Right, right, I know that’ Malfoy copied out his weekly schedule onto a piece of spare parchment on Harry’s desk and slid it over to him. He tried not to breath such an obvious sigh of relief at the sight of a completely blank Sunday.
‘Shall we get a coffee, then? The sooner we get started the better.’ Draco seemed eager to get the date started - and it was
Malfoy stayed silent, looking back down at Harry’s wrist as he continued with the antlers of the stag. Only the buzz of the tattoo gun filled the gap between them now, but Harry didn’t feel as though the silence was uncomfortable. If anything, he felt the most comfortable he’d felt with Malfoy since their meeting in Madame Malkin’s robe shop when they were eleven.

Ron just grumbled and moved away from where Harry was sat grinning with a lap-full of Draco.
So when Harry and Draco turned up for pub night, it wasn’t a surprise when the only seats available were two together, tucked close enough for them to almost be sat on each other’s laps. And when Harry had thrown an arm around Draco when they’d first sat down, it had baffled him how

He just about made it up the stairs of Grimmauld Place and into his bed before falling fast asleep, to dream of blond-haired men, birthday parties, and kisses.
‘I’ll have a white chocolate mocha please,’ Draco says to the barista behind the counter.
‘And as much as I love our trips to Tesco, the
If this was Potter’s idea of  “enjoying each other’s company”, then someone needed to have a strict word with him about how to actually
‘Alright, alright, let’s not get carried away here, I’m sure Mione didn’t mean to leave her knife hanging in my back when she stabbed me-’
‘Yes, sir. Thank you for your time,’ Harry murmured, hoping he still managed his most polite and submissive tone. Shoulders drooping, and the beginnings of a huge knot forming in the pits of his stomach, he turned around and left the office.
that Potter was so disgusted by.
‘Erm, yeah. Sure.’
Harry’s mind was reeling, trying to take in everything Hermione was saying. He could more-or-less understand why Draco had never told him about being gay, now; Harry would do anything to keep Draco in his life, too. But then there was the-
‘Hey! At least I knew to do it! Ron didn’t even
Still with his fingers circling Potter’s wrist, Draco glanced back down at the tattoo to inspect it’s healing some more. He didn’t need to, of course, and he wasn’t too sure
‘Well, the solution is simple, of course. You just need to settle down with a girlfriend, get married, and pop out two-point-five kids.’
Teddy took charge with the next section, shouting out ‘
‘I’m in love with you, Draco.’ Harry whispered into the dead phone and his empty room.
Only, Draco’s smile had died, and no one was giggling anymore, and it all felt a bit awkward. Harry’s eyes met Draco’s, and he desperately tried to figure out what that expression could’ve possibly meant, but Draco had gone to bed before he could figure it out.
his life - even if you didn’t know the whole truth about him - was better than you rejecting him and refusing to be in his life. He’s ignored how he’s felt this whole time, all these years, because being your friend was worth more to him than jeopardising it over what could be. Not to mention, he’s had no idea for the last seven years whether there was any hope of you liking him back or not! Honestly, that boy is more oblivious than you, sometimes.’
‘I’m fine, mother, honestly, just had other things on my mind than landing the floo properly.’
he really was a shit Auror), Harry couldn’t help but examine every inch of his appearance.
‘Hold still, Potter.’ Draco took out his wand. The charm was, arguably, the easiest part about magical tattoos; it was straightforward and easy to learn, and took very little energy or concentration compared to other spells, as long as you pointed your wand in the right direction.
‘Azkaban.’ Patch replied, so confident, so left-field of everything Harry had been suspecting, so

‘It would be a bit counter-productive of me to be homophobic don’t you think? I wouldn't want to muddy your memories of me from school too much but I’m not the complete idiot you loved to believe I am.’

With a sharp
‘My, my, a
‘What’s the matter? I thought they checked you over?’ Harry was immediately flushed with worry.
‘Oh shut it, Malfoy.’ Harry could already feel himself slipping back into their old routine of trading biting comments. ‘You’ll have to start showing me a little more respect if you want to stay
’ All Harry could think about was the feel of Draco’s waist under his hand, and how normal it felt.
Harry couldn’t stop his mind from racing through it all. From stealing glances at Draco when he wasn’t looking - and when he was, which made Harry want to crawl into a hole and never be seen again.
looking over to where Draco was sat), so it was a great relief to finally be out from under that pale, unnerving, grey gaze. Draco was very much like his aunt in that respect, Harry thought; it must be the Black blood in them, all aristocratic and well-bred and snooty.
‘I don’t have a hero complex! And I didn’t do it for my ego, I did it for you!’ Ten years knowing Malfoy and he still managed to get riled up just as easily.
Maybe Harry “Wonder Boy” Potter could save his life one last time.
Draco took another sip of his drink, now was not the time to be having a gay panic at the thought of touching Potter’s leg through his trousers.

‘But Char, no one sees past the scar. It’s been four years since the end of the war and I still can’t walk down the street without getting my photo taken. Even if I
Taking a deep breath, Harry opened the door, still not quite believing that his brain was allowing him to go through with this at last. The tinkling of the bell snapped him out of his reverie, bringing his green eyes up and locking straight on to a pair of steely grey.
. ‘They smell nice, anyway.’
. Still smirking, Draco sat in the chair opposite Potter’s desk. He didn’t
‘Y’know, it sort of makes sense.’ He was tapping his chin and frowning slightly. ‘All those years of fighting. It’s like the muggles say, right, love? You only fight with people you fancy?’
to fall victim to a few tonnes of Sleekeazy’s hair potion, abruptly came to a stop right outside the shop and gazed up at the sign from behind some disgustingly awful wire-rimmed glasses. Draco cursed the reflection of the sun flashing against the lenses preventing him from seeing any distinguishing feature on the bloke.
Harry spent his time waiting for Draco between staring intently at the door to the bar and taking sips of his pint for a bit of liquid courage.
‘I really shouldn’t… mother will worry.’ Draco couldn’t help the apprehension that was filling his mind, and mother really
‘Have you taken out a new potion prescription without informing your parole officer beforehand?’
‘Of course I do. You told me I was an idiot.’
‘Just you and me then Teds,’ Harry called over to the boy, getting a happy gurgle in response.
After his conversation with Andi on Wednesday, and everything that Malfoy’s friend Patch had said to him on Sunday at the party, Harry had decided to try his best at being a bit nicer to him, as unnatural as it felt. He knew he should probably start calling him
‘In the last ten minutes? At least fifteen, knowing you.’
‘Right. Well. Finished?’ Harry held his hand out for Draco’s empty cup

‘You’re a sodding hypocrite. I can’t believe I saved your-’
‘Well unless you’ve forgotten, Mione, I didn’t actually want to be his parole officer in the first place! And he kissed me, not the other way around!’ Harry was about one more sentence away from shouting, which he really didn’t want to do.
over his shoulder. It was all pretty bad-ass, Harry had to admit.
‘Firstly, you’re my parole charge, second, my godson is right there, and third, you’re a prat!’
‘Yeah… wait, what do you mean patient confidentiality? I thought you were a guard?’ Harry was confused.
Definitely not someone to be finding
Harry gulped. ‘Right… well. I’m here for my appointment.’
. Hell, maybe it would even hurt him a bit to be seen out and about with a man!
‘Hey,’ Draco whispered into Harry’s ear. Harry tried not to shiver at Draco’s breath tickling his ear.
He most certainly does not need to be having a crisis about the hotness of his former childhood rival who sat in his office as if he owned it every Friday afternoon.
Seeming to recover somewhat, Potter cleared his throat and managed to give Draco a small half-smile. He looked down at his godson, ‘Come on, Ted, time for bedtime.’
It had also helped when Ginny had gone for a trial with the Holyhead Harpies in the September following the final battle, and then again when they had - understandably - loved her and invited her to join the team with immediate effect. It was the exact distraction that Ginny needed to quietly grieve for Fred, move on from Harry (and Harry on from her, but there had been no upset feelings in their mutual split), and try to continue with the rest of her life now that the war was over.
Schooling his features back into his dissociated Malfoy Mask, Draco cleared his throat and put his still half full glass of fire whiskey back onto the coffee table. It was only once Malfoy rose to his feet and began striding across the room to the fireplace that Potter stopped laughing.
In a desperate, last-ditch attempt at wooing the boy he’d been in love with for a year now, Harry had invited Draco round to his dorm for pizza and another movie. He had also received multiple winks and nudges from all of their friends who, upon seeing Harry with his arm around Draco and Draco asleep on Harry’s shoulder on their last attempt, had realised they’d been date-crashing and had solemnly sworn to stay clear of the dorm for the entire evening.
‘Oh, c’mon Draco!’ Harry shook Draco’s arm gently. ‘We don’t need to act any different, just hold hands here and there. Maybe you could smile nicely at me once in a while.’
‘Wha.. oh, erm, yeah. Fine.’ Harry cleared his throat and tried to not make his heavy breathing so obvious. ‘What’s up, are you running late?’
Harry’s brain stopped. He needed to
Potter’s face hardened at that, like he was somehow hurt at the insinuation, but they
Looking around the room, Draco saw generations and generations of his family history told on the walls, each and every member of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black woven into the seemingly never-ending tapestry. But he couldn’t help but notice the markings that seemed to decorate the bottom.
‘No, Draco. If anything, I took advantage of you; I basically forced you into this. I might not have known about your feelings, but it was wrong of me, and I’m sorry. I wish you’d told me you were gay, though, you know I’d never had a problem with it - or with you. You’re my best friend in the whole world, D; I don’t want to lose you.’
For the first time in his life, Draco stumbled out of the floo at the other end, much to the surprise of his mother.
‘You’re damn right you should have floo’d.’
‘Actually it’s literally my job to know.’
an Auror anymore wasn’t enough to not be ignored, and the satisfaction he’d get from catching more dark wizards and righting more of Voldemort’s wrongs was plenty enough to be getting on with for now.
‘Have you given it all up yet? We miss you at Hogwarts, mate, it’s not the same without you. Anyone will agree. Come on, surely you can see that you’re hating every second of this bloody Auror training?’
‘Bold of you to assume you’re my favourite, Harry, but I’m actually on my fifteen. So it was lucky timing from you arriving when you did really.’

‘Alright there, D?’
Potter liked blokes? Was that what he’d just said?
‘Narcissus? It’s a type of daffodil, honestly Harry, I know they're only muggle plants but do you pay attention to anything other than quidditch?’

If only Malfoy would stop puzzling him. Flirting, and playing with Teddy, and riling Harry up like this. It would help a lot with Harry’s heart and it’s occasional gymnastics. And what the hell was up with all of that, anyway?
it. Ceremoniously, he deposited the drinks in front of Ron and Hermione.
‘How much of that did you hear?’
Although, thinking back to his mother's sly comment, the inability to speak properly was a Gryffindor trait that he didn’t mind rubbing off on him so much anymore.
‘Hot chocolate sounds nice… thanks. If it’s alright, P is the one thing I get to myself these days. I’d like to keep it that way for a little longer.’ Malfoy spoke in the smallest voice he’d ever heard the blond use.
Then there was the clothes. The clothes that were so distinctly
‘But that’s amazing, Andi!’ All notions of avoiding Andi’s gaze gone from his mind, Harry stared over at her and all of a sudden wanted to know every single detail.
