‘Uh, “hi there Millie, my name is Draco and I’m here to get you back to your mum”?’ Harry offered, tugging lightly to get his arm loose from Draco’s death grip.
‘Parkinson?’ He said, unable to keep his voice entirely blank. She squared her shoulders, seemingly telling herself to just get it over with.
He’d been unable to look away from those pale grey eyes since he’d gotten close enough to touch. There was a warmth in them that Harry only ever saw around himself and he’d seen once around Narcissa. Something different than what was on his face around his friends.
‘Harry, are you okay?’ Draco asked, his hand tightening a little on Harry’s arm. He realized his feet had been trying to move away and Draco wasn’t letting him.
wasn’t there to tell him off. Young didn’t bring up the date-disaster again and for that Harry was immensely grateful.
, good merciful Merlin, he had a boyfriend now. Draco Malfoy was his boyfriend. If anyone had told them back at Hogwarts things would turn out this way he would have told them to go get their head checked at St. Mungo’s.
‘After Harry had to convince the Minister to actually let him do the test.’ Ron added, scooping a small mountain of rice onto his plate. Hermione raised her eyebrows at Harry.
‘We’re going to get some air.’ Harry forced the words out of his mouth and he forced his feet into motion. Dawlish nodded and motioned towards the backyard.
‘Well, I hadn’t considered myself quitting too, but I figured for you, well, you were already doing it during our fifth year.’ Draco said, looking at the gently moving grass in the painting above the fireplace. Harry frowned, trying to figure out what he meant. Their fifth year had been an entire bloody mess.
‘Okay, please heal my friend, Kreacher.’ Kreacher simply snapped his fingers and the wound on Draco’s side started knitting itself back together. Draco gasped, swayed and actually went a little green. Harry tightened his hand on Draco’s knee.
Ron wasn’t happy when Robards actually made Harry pair up with Malfoy, but he also didn’t seem to want to argue with the man who would hopefully become his boss soon. He handed them off to another Auror to start their first course.
.’ Draco growled out. He was sweating now and he looked even paler than usual, practically translucent. A wave of worry crashed over him.
‘He’s even blushing Gryffindor red now.’ Blaise said with a smirk and in a completely surprising move, Draco barked out a laugh and flipped Blaise the bird.
of Apparition and then he was sitting on the floor in front of the hospital. He immediately pushed himself to his feet and headed for the door. He could hear Robards pop into existence behind him but he didn’t stop to wait. He needed to know how Ron was. Right now.
got some rest but now I’m working with Young and I don’t know how she does it but she doesn’t need sleep like normal people do and so I forget the time and then suddenly it’s 8pm and I haven’t eaten and then I’m too tired to make something and so I just crash, but then I have nightmares because I don’t have Dreamless Sleep anymore and I keep not getting a new supply and I’m just- I’m just overwhelmed.’
‘I suppose.’ He said with a put-upon sigh. ‘It’s not our case anyways, we can let someone else handle it for once.’ That set a pit of guilt in Harry’s stomach, but for once, he ignored it. Draco was right, they needed a break. He couldn’t remember the last time Draco didn’t have dark circles under his eyes, or the last time Harry had not been thinking about a case until he fell asleep.
‘Damn Slytherins.’ Harry muttered to himself before deciding to grab a coffee in the cafeteria before he headed home.
He tried to constantly remind himself that Dra-Malfoy wanted to do this. That he wanted to help take these people down, that he’d agreed to this plan, but it wasn’t easy.
‘That actually sounds very nice, Harry.’ He smiled back at her. Yeah, this was good. He was going to do this.
‘Maybe you should go home.’ Draco offered. ‘You don’t look much better than when we went outside.’ Draco did, in fact look a bit better.
‘I won’t be allowed to be there as back-up?’ Harry could feel the uncertainty and the icy cold fingers of dread crawl up his spine.
‘You too.’ Malfoy looked at his scarlet robes and for a second Harry could see the disbelieve and the emotion on his face before he smoothed it out again. ‘Now I just have to hope and pray to Merlin that they don’t keep me a Junior Auror until I’m a week from retiring.’
In their cubicles there had always been other sound going on. Others working, mail coming in, going out, cases being discussed, talks in the break room. It was never quiet. Their office was on the other hand was very quiet and that made Harry’s fidgeting always the loudest thing in the room. He tapped his pens, bounced his leg and did pretty much every other annoying thing that would mean he wouldn’t have to sit still.
‘Good morning everyone, I am positively sta-‘ Blaise Zabini came waltzing into the room and stopped mid-word.
‘I have a spare room.’ Harry offered. ‘It’s probably not what you’re used to, but it has a bed.’ Draco blinked at him for a few seconds.
‘Yes, yes, I know, you’re a big bad Slytherin. There always has to be something in it for you.’ Harry snorted.
‘You too miss Haywood.’ Harry stood as she left the classroom and twisted his torso a few times to get the cricks out of his back. The professor’s chairs weren’t necessarily more comfortable than the students chairs had been.
‘Mister Potter, you cannot speak for the accused unless he requests that you do.’ Well, alright then. Harry turned to Malfoy.
‘I know, step by step.’ Ginny said, she put her hand on his shoulder and squeezed. ‘You’ll be fine, young wizard.’ She said with a strange accent, making Harry laugh.
He looked exhausted. That was probably the first thing that made it through the wave of “bloody hell he’s actually here”. The second was the bruises on the side of his face and his split lip.
be lying.’ Draco paused before continuing. ‘The plan is to fire me, publicly and then have me approach them pretending like I am a scorned ex-employee wanting to stick it to the Ministry. With my family’s history it shouldn’t be that hard to convince them it’s true.’
‘Are you actually out of your mind?’ Malfoy asked. His eyes wide. They really were grey, weren’t they? ‘You actually believe they’d let me be an Auror?
‘Well, let’s go!’ Harry slipped his wand in the holster along his forearm and started heading to the door.
‘Alright, that’s good. So you’re getting the stag and the doe today, right?’ She asked, patting a chair for Harry to sit in.
‘Thank you.’ He said, smiling at her. ‘Could you tell Dawlish and Proudfoot I’ll see them tomorrow? I would really like to get some rest.’
When he looked back down at the floor, pale eyes were on him. Malfoy’s face was mostly blank, but Harry knew him well enough to see the fear in his eyes. Wait, did he? Know Malfoy? Or did he just know what he looked like when he was terrified?
It was exactly like he’d pictured it. The two black silhouettes were clearly visible, even on Harry’s darker skin tone. The two deer looked free and
‘You are trying to emotionally manipulate me into getting rest.’ He concluded and Draco shrugged casually.
‘Yes Potter, it was bad.’ Draco moved so that Harry could look at him a little easier. He had his arms crossed tightly. ‘Whatever it was, your temperature
‘-oh good merciful Merlin, Draco you have no idea what that fool of a Mirella did this-‘ Pansy Parkinson stopped dead in her tracks at the sight of Harry.
Ron chose that moment to swoop in and steal Harry away. Harry didn’t leave Malfoy’s side very often anymore. Harry’s presence meant that others left him be and when Harry
As Junior Aurors, they were mostly kept either at their cubicles doing investigative work, or they were send out to do the tasks the actual Aurors didn’t want to do. It was both nice and frustrating. Nice because Harry was being treated like all the other Junior Aurors and frustrating because he really wanted to actually get his own proper case.
‘Only if necessary.’ Harry said with a grin of his own, he fought not to let it turn into a smirk as he continued. ‘To make you smile like that I would do whatever it takes.’ Draco stared at him for a few seconds before making a face.
had gone undercover and Gaulding had already driven Harry to his breaking point. He was insufferable. ‘I need a break.’ Harry bit out before storming from the room. He could hear the tell-tale footsteps of Young following him.
Here we are with the final chapter. This story has been a fun little experiment for me. I haven't really been feeling very inspired lately, so it was very nice to just get this story out there and post something again. Thank you all very much for your comments. I really appreciate it.
‘It’s too risky, if I got stuck with them for longer than planned it could start to ware off or I could run out.’
‘Next time, take me to St. Mungo’s.’ Draco said from between clenched teeth. ‘At least they give you a pain relief potion first.’
‘Malfoy- Draco, seriously. She’s a child, she is not going to care what you’ve done before or what your last name is, she’s probably in there and she just wants to go home. Now go get her.’ Harry said firmly. Draco let go of Harry’s arm with a start.
‘Well thank you, both of you.’ She held out her free hand and Harry let Draco move forward first. She shook his hand and then Harry’s and then she moved off into the village.
There was a strange sort of comfort in working with Malfoy. He assumed that he would have felt the same if he was working with Ron. It was comfortable because he knew how Malfoy would respond. He knew what would get him to roll his eyes, how he could goad him into snapping. He learned Malfoy’s strengths (for example, he was a damn good tracker) and his tells. They complimented each other in a strange, antagonistic sort of way.
‘Alright.’ Minister Shacklebolt said after a short pause. ‘Robards, let him take the tests, treat him like any other. If he passes, he can start, if he doesn’t, he won’t.’ He walked back towards the fireplace. ‘I don’t like it either, but Potter is right. He was found not guilty, he must be treated like any other candidate.’
They ended up staying for another hour until both Amelia and Ron were released. Harry wrapped Ron in a tight hug the second he came through the door. He hugged Amelia a little less tightly. They both still looked a little pale, but other than that, no worse for wear. Draco only froze for a second when Amelia stepped into his personal space to give him a quick hug. He patted her on the back a little awkwardly and Harry had to bite his lip to stop himself from laughing.
‘Oh, well, I thought- um, you and Malfoy. I was talking to Amelia the other day and she kind of made it sound like you two were- um- not just partners.’ Young was looking at the ceiling now, still blushing scarlet. ‘I thought, well, he turned out to be bad anyways, but he’s your type, so I might be too.’ Harry knew he was gaping at her, he just didn’t seem to remember how to close his mouth. ‘I’ll just- I’ll just go get us some tea. Do you want tea? I’ll get you some tea.’ She fled from the office before he could answer.
‘His mother wanted to speak with him for a bit.’ Harry said with a shrug and Parkinson seemed to take a closer look at him.
‘Well, how about this: Am I allowed to kiss you? Or is there some weird pureblood custom for this? Should I be buying you gifts? Do some weird dance? Bring an offering to the peacocks?’ Draco cast his eyes to the heavens, but stepped into Harry’s space.
‘That’s what I told the Minister.’ Harry said, trying to draw Hermione away from Ron. ‘The assessment was very strange though-‘ He started describing his own and how it hadn’t really felt like it would tell them anything about whether he’d be a good Auror or not.
‘You seem upset.’ Draco noted, if not for the fact that he was still a little pale and the water in the bowl had turned pink, you almost wouldn’t be able to tell he’d been hurt at all. He was just Draco, sitting on a couch, shirtless, cleaning the last remnants of blood off his flat stomach. His pale, pale skin was still a little pink, maybe from the rubbing of the towel. Harry didn’t know, his skin didn’t really colour like that, it was too dark.
‘I makes sense.’ Harry defended. ‘You’ve got the NEWTs, you’re clearly smart.’ He waved the parchment at Malfoy. ‘You have practical experience,-‘
It was one of his favourite things to be honest. He really liked Draco’s hands, they were so elegant and to see them work on the little buttons was very nice. There was also the slow exposure of pale skin, of collarbones and stomach.
‘Weird.’ Ginny said, making a face. ‘It’s very strange to be the only Weasley there, first of all. Also, even though the castle has been repaired, it’s like you can still feel what happened. Some of the older students who were involved in the battle have nightmares, there’s a few repeat seventh years that are really struggling, you can just
The tingling of his new tattoos combined with the warm, soft feeling of Draco’s hand in his was… maybe the best he’d felt in a while. Now that the feeling of just being
He heard Draco cry out in pain. He felt a familiar hand on his arm. He heard a familiar voice in his ear.
. He’s never, not even once yelled at me for being a fidgety bloody arsehole and we both know I can be.’ Hermione came back from the kitchen with a steaming plate of her pasta parmesan and Harry practically inhaled the first bite. Shit he hadn’t realized he was hungry.
‘Okay, this is great and everything, but he doesn’t like me back, right?’ Harry asked and Ron went back to looking horrified, but more in the sense of “oh good merciful Merlin now I have to talk with my best friend about
Their first ever outing on their own was to an elderly lady who had contacted the DMLE convinced that her gardening supplies had been stolen by “those hoodwinks dressed in dark clothes”. They were met at the door by Marguerite. She had to have been pushing ninety and the home was like a furnace. They’d both been wearing their proper daily Auror robes, long grey pants, dark grey boots and a red coat with a triangular flap that could be fastened at their left shoulder with dark panels running along the top of their sleeves. They looked like they meant business. Too bad those outfits were
‘If she went this way she could have ended up in the forest.’ Harry said, tracing his finger along a small alleyway between two buildings that would lead to the woods that the village backed into. Harry took out his wand and circled the alleyway. It would give the Aurors on the scene a little notification.
‘Yes, as long as you walk like you know where you’re going and like you’re supposed to be there, people generally don’t bother you.’ Malfoy said, as he automatically straightened his spine and tipped his chin up.
‘Fine,’ Ron breathed out, waving his hands in surrender. ‘but if this doesn’t work out like you want it to, do not come crawling back to me. I will be sleeping.’ Ron marched further into Harry’s apartment, maybe to raid his kitchen (not that he would find much, but still), maybe to crash in Harry’s guest room, who knew. Harry didn’t have time to care, he darted over to the fireplace, tossed some Floo Powder into it and with the familiar dizzying sensation he was off to the Ministry.
Then he straightened up, pushed himself off the chair and fixed his clothes. Harry had to bite the inside of his cheek to stop himself from grinning. What a prideful idiot. All about image.
‘I’m not going anywhere without you.’ Harry said and Malfoy looked at him for a few seconds, a strange look on his face.
This had been an argument that, at its core, sparked because neither of them wanted to leave the other behind. Harry had won, but the fact that Draco even put up a fight (and not because he didn’t want to be the first one to leave, but because he didn’t want to leave Harry) felt like a big deal. Draco preached self-preservation, but he’d put that aside-
is a plan.’ Malfoy said as he pulled out his wand. ‘We need to get back to the offices without Apparating or using the Floo network. We have an hour. I say we just walk in the front door, they won’t expect that.’
‘Well, what about yours?’ Harry pointed lazily in the direction of Draco’s head. ‘It’s all shiny and sleek and it looks so soft. Is it soft?’ Draco bopped his head up and down.
‘I’ve been there before, but I don’t quite remember why. The name is familiar though.’ Draco said as he followed the road into the town. It looked like it was the small town’s main road, there were little shops marked alongside it.
, this is our first big case that’s ours. Robards can’t take the credit and neither can that asshole Gaulding.
‘It’s the old Black house. Come on.’ Harry pulled on Draco’s arm. His legs didn’t seem to be hurt so he could probably walk himself inside. Draco stumbled a little on the steps up to the door, but he made it inside without falling over. Harry was counting that as a victory. He steered Draco into the sitting room and onto a small couch.
‘Wait, you got through?’ Harry called after Malfoy. No one had immediately told Harry if he’d been selected or not.
‘Well I was thinking we could just go with the two of us.’ That was strange. Usually Young loved having Amelia around, she kind of adored her.
When he was alone it was especially bad because he couldn’t drown himself in a conversation with someone and pretend not to notice.
Also I have no idea if a house elf would actually be able to heal someone, but I'm just running with it.
‘I’m not here to speak for the prosecution.’ While the Auror was busy blinking stupidly at him, he slipped inside, closing the door as the affronted yelp sounded. It wasn’t packed in the room, but it was fairly busy. It seemed like they’d only just started. In the middle of the room, on the chair, waiting to be interrogated was a familiar head of white blonde hair. Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He wasn’t too late.
‘But how often do we actually get to do that?’ Draco’s smile was softer than it had any right to be. ‘Most of the time we’re coming in after the bad thing has already happened. Have you not seen enough darkness to last you a lifetime?’ Harry considered that for a second.
She was also the reason he’d actually started thinking about why so many Slytherins ended up on the Dark Side.
‘We have reached a verdict.’ Harry was drawn from his musing. He immediately felt his nerves spike. He could see Malfoy swallow thickly. ‘We, the Wizengamot, find Draco Lucius Malfoy not guilty on all charges.’ Harry released the breath he hadn’t even realized he was holding. The media’s cameras flashed. The spell holding Malfoy to the chair must have been released as soon as the verdict was announced because Malfoy sagged forward and set his elbows on his knees burying his face in his hands. His stupidly blond hair formed an extra little curtain as it fell over his forehead, giving him a few moments to himself to process whatever he was feeling.
‘You won it from me, it’s allegiance is to you now.’ Malfoy said, but Harry could see his fingers twitching at his side.
‘Yes, I think we both know why.’ Harry said before heading back to his seat to wait for the verdict. He would deny it to anyone who asked, but he was nervous. He’d spend every waking second since the war ended agonising over this. Over the fate of the people who had chosen the wrong side. There were some for whom he would have chosen to lock them up for the rest of their lives, but then there were the ones like Malfoy, who had wiggled their way into Harry’s mind and wouldn’t let go. It was like he didn’t have to worry about the lives of his friends anymore and so his brain fixated on protecting something else.
‘Okay, now I already explained most of this to you in our correspondence, but basically as I apply the ink I will also be infusing the magic that will make it move. Now I can’t use your magic for that obviously, I have to use my own. That means that it can hurt from time to time as I apply it and it might be itchy for a day or two after, if it lasts any longer, you might have to come back so I can see what’s up.’ Harry nodded. He’d read all of the information she’d send him more than once.
Malfoy pushed him down on the chair furthest in the back and disappeared. He came back about a minute (or five) later and shoved a large glass of water into Harry’s hands.
‘Oh thank Merlin.’ Draco breathed out. Harry laughed. ‘You should wear that emerald green shirt with the charcoal grey pants.’ Harry narrowed his eyes at Draco.
‘Potter?’ He couldn’t immediately place the voice, but he forced himself to turn his head slowly. He was safe. He was safe. He could tell by the look on Hermione’s face that she already disliked this.
Gaulding however, went from someone Harry just didn’t want to be around, to someone Harry wanted to actively hurt. He was so
a new thing!’ Harry snapped back at him. ‘I have always had issues with food, that’s just because of the way I was raised. That is not just because of you, don’t
‘Just because you rolled over like a good little doggie doesn’t mean we all have, Malfoy.’ Zabini snapped before storming off. He threw Harry and his friends a nasty look before disappearing from the room.
‘Obviously, Minister Shacklebolt better hold onto his job tightly.’ Despite Ron just not quite getting Harry and Hermione’s outlook, he did send his girlfriend a proud look. Neville opened his mouth to say something when they were interrupted by a loud voice.
‘You are a weird creature Harry Potter.’ Malfoy said cryptically before he glanced at his robes again and flinched. ‘Merlin, I wish they would have made the Junior Auror robes a different colour. Red does not go well with my complexion.’ Harry rolled his eyes.
‘You did good calling for back-up.’ Harry said quickly, sending three Stunners over their cover in the direction of the bad guys. ‘Portkey?’
‘That was months ago.’ Harry stopped himself from arguing, recognizing the distraction for what it was. ‘You still haven’t told me how they’re planning on concealing your identity if you’re going to be undercover for months.’ Draco actually flinched a little at that.
is the part of the sentence you would focus on.’ He huffed. ‘Fine, yes. I suppose we are friends.’ Harry let his grin morph into a more genuine smile.
‘Fine.’ Malfoy stuck his hand in his pocket and his hand emerged with a single Galleon pinched between his stupidly slim fingers. ‘There.’ He tossed the coin Harry’s way. He didn’t even fumble the catch, Seeker reflexes. Malfoy turned on his heel and headed down the street after tossing a final: ‘I will see you when the courses start.’
‘I know, I made it. This was only half a dose, I took the other half.’ He was already dressed in his clothes from yesterday but he looked prim and proper like it was all brand new. Arsehole. ‘I was supposed to deliver this to my friends, but I’ll just say I miscalculated.’
The unfortunate thing about Gaulding was his “connections”, his father was high up in the DMLE and he forced Robards’ hand. Meaning they ended up in a weird foursome situation where Gaulding only really wanted to work with Harry, Harry only really wanted to work with Young, Young despised both Blueroot and Gaulding and Blueroot was just sort of… along for the ride.
He grabbed two low glasses and the bottle of Firewhisky from his kitchen and headed back to the living room. Draco was sitting on his couch, one leg folded over the other, looking unsure of where to put his arm in the mess of pillows he was sitting between. Harry tried his hardest not to grin, but Draco noticed anyways.
After thirty minutes, George and Ginny came along. Ginny had been allowed to leave Hogwarts for the weekend in order to come see her brother’s graduation. Ginny grinned at him and stole what was left of his beer. Harry didn’t protest, it would be futile.
. Saying he’d known all along. That he’d never trusted him. That he’d been right. Harry hated him. Gaulding even had the guts to try and get Harry to be his partner now that Dra-
‘It is not funny Ronald.’ Hemione said sharply. ‘He was cleared, he should be treated like any other.’ Harry threw a smug look in Ron’s direction.
‘Yes, about you and how you almost killed yourself just because I left on an assignment for a while.’ Draco’s voice cracked in a way Harry had never heard it do before. ‘I went to talk to Weasley and Granger yesterday, she’s doing good by the way, really getting round now, and they told me how bad you’d really been. I can’t believe you, Harry, I leave you alone for a year and you just stop eating and sleeping? What-‘
Theo Gaulding, who was a grade A asshole. He was arrogant and convinced he was Merlin’s gift to the Wizarding world. Unlike Malfoy’s occasional arrogance, Gaulding’s wasn’t charming. He’d take the credit for the work of others and he loved to remind people his father worked high up in the DMLE. Harry despised him, especially because Malfoy was his favourite target to take advantage of.
‘Yeah, no, it’s fine. I got it. I’m fine.’ He forced his feet to move forwards. ‘You redid the inside?’ Harry forced his voice back in the direction of normal. Draco didn’t seem convinced.
‘I’ll be undercover, so no.’ Draco sighed. ‘Relax, Potter, I’m a big boy, I’ll be fine.’ Harry tried not to sound like he didn’t believe a word of it.
‘First of all, I will Transfigure my own bed. How you ever got an O on that OWL is beyond me. Second of all, I have never shared a room before or since Hogwarts and I don’t plan on starting today. I will sleep downstairs.’ Harry rolled his eyes.
.’ Harry pushed. Draco clenched his jaw, but Harry could see he was getting to him. Logic was always the way to go.
have no problem with this obviously, but I know how pouty you get when you don’t get to relax on the weekend.’
Harry didn’t enjoy coming to Diagon Alley much anymore. The magic that had surrounded the place when he was younger just wasn’t quite there anymore. Especially when people stared at him like this. He generally tried to be a little more inconspicuous when he came here but today he’d come straight from work and he was wearing his Auror coat. He tried to ignore the stares and just get what he needed and get out, but all those eyes on him made his skin feel itchy.
‘It’s not manipulation, it’s just encouragement in a way that would appeal to you.’ Malfoy raised his eyebrows like he didn’t see the difference. ‘Just think about it.’ Harry held his hands out to the side. ‘The sign up for Auror training is in a week. You have to come to the Auror offices and sign in and then they do character and aptitude tests and they decide who will be allowed to start the training programme.’
‘I’m not okay, but I put my feelings aside and focus on what I have to do right now and deal with the feelings later… or not at all.’ He added with a wry smile.
, now get out of my way.’ He was about three seconds away from hitting his friend with a Body Bind Curse just so he could get past him. He did not have time for this. Ron sighed deeply, he looked exhausted and Harry felt a spark of guilt in his stomach, but he told it to shut up and he held firm. This was important. ‘Just- just get some rest, okay? Let me do this.’ Harry softened his voice and tried to look calm and collected.
‘I like working with Ron and Amelia. I like it when we help people, when we can save people.’ Harry added, smiling smugly at Draco. Even if he wasn’t quite sure
The little town they appeared in looked dreary underneath the grey clouds and it had the feeling of panic in the air.
‘And I never asked you to do anything, all I’m asking is to let me handle this how I want to handle it and not drag me off into a corner like you want to knock my teeth out.’ Harry said, still softly as the guy closest to them (he may have been a year above them at Hogwarts) was eyeing them suspiciously.
‘What the bloody hell are you on about-‘ Draco asked, Merlin he got grouchy when he was hurting. ‘Oh.’ He said when the buildings moved to make place for number 12.
‘Ah yes, terrifying your students with tales of little creatures that will try to bludgeon them to death. So much fun.’ Draco said blankly.
Harry immediately grabbed a piece of parchment and started scribbling. Draco sighed and pushed himself off his chair.
‘Sorry to interrupt, but I have something I need to give you.’ Harry said, again trying not to look threatening as he took the wand from his pocket. The two Malfoys still tensed. The two Aurors didn’t seem worried though. Whether that was because it was Harry or because they wouldn’t care if he hexed them, he wasn’t sure. He hoped it was the first option.
‘- like the ones still out there and I think I can help catch them. I was raised with these people, I know how they think, how they act when they’re under pressure, I know their tactics. I could be useful, Minister.’ Malfoy sounded so… earnest. When did he learn to do that?
‘And what are you thanking him for?’ Ron asked, his head titled in the way Harry usually associated with him hexing someone. Parkinson’s eyes were spitting fire, but she kept her voice level.
So for now he was just letting it sit. They were busy (and that wasn’t even an excuse, their caseload was huge) and there was barely time to sleep and eat, let alone
and Harry could feel the emotions roll through his system. This is how he wanted to remember them, like the two smiling people in the photograph he had. Alive and warm and free. He blinked back his tears as he looked back up at Missy, whose grin had softened into a warm smile.
‘Oh please, you’re not getting rid of me that easily Potter.’ It seemed like he wasn’t the only one in need of some distance. Harry rolled his eyes, just because that was expected of him. He didn’t allow himself to swallow until he turned away to get back behind his desk.
. Harry wasn’t planning on letting him out of his sight for a while. Harry found himself practically skipping through the Atrium. Draco was back. He was
‘Malfoy, come with me.’ Robards leaned into their office, his face serious, as always. Draco only blinked once before answering, perfectly polite.
‘Good. I enjoy being entertained.’ She sauntered over to the table and headed to the other side to sit down. It seemed like a very deliberate choice of chair. Maybe they all had their own spot? ‘Where
partner. Harry just wanted Draco. He wanted his pointed silences and his annoyed sighs. He wanted his neat handwriting and his perfect manners. His stupidly smart clothes and his haughty tone. He just wanted his partner back.
Something squeezed in Harry’s chest. He cleared his throat and Draco whirled around. A lock of his hair fell into his face, he pushed it away with an annoyed gesture.
‘Alright.’ Missy said, rolling her chair around so that she was properly on Harry’s side now. She’d brought along a little tray and some instruments that Harry wouldn’t even dare to try and name. ‘So we’re having it run along your hip right? She motioned at the skin about an inch or two above the waistband of Harry’s jeans.
‘Hey, you just said “get us out of here Potter”’ He did an admittedly terrible impression of Draco’s accent and judging by the glare he got, Draco noticed. ‘so I got us out of there. You didn’t tell me you had a
They spend a few minutes disguising each other. They used Glamours, so they weren’t technically changing their appearances, just putting a layer of magic over their faces that made them look different. The temptation to layer ginger over Malfoy’s blonde hair was pretty great, but he resisted, he was trying to make friends, not enemies. Instead he went with a shorter bob, about Hermione’s colour and texture. It usually helped to Glamour with things that you were actually familiar with, it helped picture it in your mind. He went for Neville’s nose and widened Malfoy’s chin in a way that reminded him of Charlie. He also cast a quick Glamour over the Dark Mark on Draco’s arm. The sight of it made him want to squirm uncomfortably, but he didn’t.
‘Well, that’s what we were discussing. They think this supplier might be part of a larger network and they want to take out the whole thing in one go, make sure to kill it at the roots. They think this might take months-‘
‘Ask me to speak for you.’ Harry pressed. Malfoy’s eyes stayed fixed on him for a good ten seconds, but then he sighed. He looked far older than he actually was, as exhausted as he looked. His skin was even paler than Harry remembered it and there were dark shadows under his eyes.
‘Oh please, they love the bloody ones.’ Harry said with a shrug. ‘As long as I don’t release one in the room and say whoever survives passes the class, they don’t care.’ Draco let out an inelegant snort.
‘I think Pansy and Daphne would have something to say about that.’ Draco motioned at him with his glass, the liquid in it sloshed around dangerously, but Harry couldn’t find it within himself to care much. ‘They would also have something to say about your glasses.’ Draco frowned a little. ‘
‘Look this is a little more than a simple Episkey can fix okay, I’ve never been very good at healing magic.’ Harry found his voice a little hysterical. He was usually pretty calm in scary situations, but there was something about the stark contrast of Draco’s already pale skin and the bright red of his blood.
However, the universe clearly hated him because it was not simple. Well, finding the man responsible was, he really hadn’t made that big of an effort to conceal his identity, but the arrest wasn’t. They could have just send the Hit Wizards after the guy, but from the description they had he seemed like a nervous, squirrely kind of guy. Not exactly a huge danger.
‘Hey,’ Harry bumped his shoulder into Draco’s (well, more like his upper arm, those few stupid inches he had on Harry were really annoying). ‘we found the girl.’
‘Whatever you say, Potter. Now, if you don’t mind, I am going to go home.’ Malfoy took a few steps towards the elevators and then stopped. He took a deep breath before looking back at Harry over his shoulder. ‘I don’t like owing a debt to anyone, especially not you. Figure out what you want, Potter.’ Before Harry could protest that he really didn’t
The only reason he didn’t miss the flicker of Draco’s eyes down to his mouth was because he was staring at him so hard. If he would have blinked, he’d have missed it. He didn’t miss it.
‘Something my mom used to make me when I’d had a bad night.’ Malfoy said and then he pointedly turned his eyes forward, even though the course hadn’t started yet. It was Malfoy’s “do not ask me any more questions” gesture and Harry had learned he could only push Malfoy on that so many times before he stopped talking altogether. He decided this wasn’t worth pushing over.
trust me.’ Draco dropped himself in his chair with uncharacteristic loose limbs. ‘They’re sending me undercover.’ Harry’s fingers froze in the middle of the rhythm he’d been tapping.
Harry burst into the nearly empty offices. Amelia was sitting in the breakroom, alone with a cup of tea.
‘You most certainly do.’ Draco said pulling his nose up. ‘Now before you argue, let’s go start on this house.’
As soon as Narcissa’s eyes landed on Harry she pulled back. If Harry hadn’t known better he would have said that Malfoy made a wounded noise at that. She cleared her throat and pointedly looked at Harry who approached them as non-threateningly as he could.
‘Actually, Minister, sorry to interrupt, but I would like to say a few things.’ By the buzz in the room, Harry judged that he’d been right in thinking that this wasn’t how things were done. Minister Shacklebolt sighed and turned to him.
‘Not really.’ Harry admitted. ‘I just- I don’t understand how you could do that to another living thing. It makes me sick.’
‘I know, I know, I just- I don’t know. I need to distract myself or I’ll start thinking about where he is, how he’s doing, who he’s with, if he’s making progress, is he okay. I can’t stop. Sure, Dawlish gives me updates once a week but that’s mostly just “he’s not dead, Potter” and that’s it. I- I miss him.’
Harry was sitting with Hermione (who was flipping through a book, checking her own answers), Ron (who was laying flat on his back with his eyes closed) and Neville, when McGonagall approached. Harry was annoyed that his hands were shaking as McGonagall handed him the envelope with his results, but she gave him a small smile, so he was pretty sure it couldn’t be awful?
‘Of course. Who else is going to make sure you don’t starve or get dehydrated? Most certainly not you.’
‘I- I suppose?’ She said, looking a little rattled for maybe the first time since Harry had met her. Huh.
‘I am.’ Harry swallowed. ‘I had a hard time, for a while.’ He admitted, but he refused to look at Draco. They headed into the hallway and Harry steered them up the stairs. ‘But I’m much better now.’ Draco hummed behind him.
Draco had gone to get a tattoo on Saturday, while Harry’s appointment was on Sunday. It had been a bit of a surprise when Draco told him he was getting another tattoo. Ever since Harry had started with his first one, he hadn’t really stopped, but in all those years, Draco had never given any indication he wanted to get more than just the dragon on his back.
Their job really went from zero to one hundred and back in the blink of an eye and there was really very little in between. The strange thing was, Harry didn’t necessarily enjoy the action packed moments more than he enjoyed the slow ones. When there was action, it usually meant that someone’s life was at risk. Sometimes it was theirs, other times it was a random person, but there was always the sense of dread.
‘Oh, well, alright then.’ She shuffled out of the booth after George and Ginny and disappeared into the crowd with Ron trailing after them.
‘Make yourself at home.’ Harry motioned for the couch, throwing his coat on his designated clothes-chair before heading into the kitchen. His own shirt was actually nice too.
‘Not really.’ Harry said with a smile. The place looked amazing. There were drawings all over the place. Missy was clearly very talented. She also looked pretty much exactly like what Harry expected a tattoo artist to look like.
a thing that happened. Draco was, just like Harry, quite recognizable. There really was no mistaking that hair. So from time to time, people would… refuse Draco things that they would gladly do for or let Harry do. Sometimes Harry used this in their favour, but it always made the discomfort crawl under his skin.
He pushed the doors open and nearly ran right into Draco. He appeared to have been pacing near the entrance and the second his eyes landed on Harry some of the tension in his spine bled out.
He knew Draco was a little different now. He almost seemed to have gone back to how he was at Hogwarts. Sharper, more defensive. Unwilling to show any weakness and he would deflect anything you said back at you. He’d lash out if he deemed you to come too close.
‘Bye.’ Harry replied automatically while Malfoy grumbled something incomprehensible. ‘I think she’s right.’ Malfoy turned to him like he was surprised Harry was still there.
Draco pushed himself off his desk and stood up straight. He was taller than Harry, when they were this close those few inches really mattered. Draco reached out and Harry let himself be pulled into a hug. He rose on his tiptoes so that he could hook his chin over Draco’s shoulder. A few strands of his silky hair brushed past the side of Harry’s face. Draco had been right, it was very soft. His arms were a little hesitant, but as Harry held on a little tighter, so did Draco. Harry fought with himself to make sure he didn’t burrow his face in Draco’s neck.
Harry knew he was grinning like a fool when he slipped under the covers, but he couldn’t get himself to stop. Draco was back. He had missed Harry. Things could only get better from here.
‘Sure thing, Neville.’ Hermione said with a smile as she got to her feet as well. ‘Ron and I should head off too, we are helping Molly with dinner.’ Ron groaned as he pushed himself to his feet.
. He mouthed and Draco got that annoyed pinch between his brows he always did when Harry had one of his “Idiotic Gryffindor Moments”, but he nodded sharply in confirmation. Harry counted down from three and then moved.
‘I would hope so.’ Malfoy said turning and walking backwards a few steps. ‘I was amazing. I’m an expert at being interrogated by now.’ He smirked before turning back around and heading off again. Harry found himself rolling his eyes at his retreating back, but also… smiling?
‘Can we just stop?’ Harry asked as he stopped in a shadowy part of the alley. ‘We’re both nervous, we need to get going, we only have an hour to get back to the offices.’
‘Well, I suppose that seems like a good deal.’ Draco got up off his chair and leaned back against his desk. ‘Do you want to guess where it is?’ Harry pursed his lips, he had a pretty good idea.
After lunch, they went their separate ways and Harry found himself sitting on his couch grinning stupidly at the wall. It had been his favourite Saturday in a while- wait. Saturday? Didn’t Draco have his Slytherin lunch on Saturday’s? Yeah no, Harry remembered because he’d joined them at some point. Had Draco blown off his friends to have lunch with Harry? He hadn’t even hesitated or mentioned he had somewhere else to be. Huh. Maybe they’d skipped a week? Maybe he’d already said he wouldn’t join them because he knew his thing with Harry might run late?
Their excuse for firing Draco had been that he’d supposedly used and Unforgivable on a suspect to make him talk. It was all lies, but the ease with which those not in the know accepted it made Harry feel physically sick. So many people came up to him that day saying things like “it’s not your fault Potter, some people are just bad” and “I knew he hadn’t really changed, snakes never really change”, Harry bit the inside of his cheek until it was bleeding. The coppery taste in his mouth felt fitting.
When their door opened an hour and a half after Draco had left Harry really couldn’t be faulted for his first words being:
‘Like take over the Wizarding World with your brilliance.’ Harry grinned, okay, maybe not his best word choice ever, but Hermione didn’t seem to mind. She just grinned at him.
He opened the envelope and pulled out the parchment. He skipped the whole mumbo jumbo at the beginning and went straight for the little box with his results.
‘I am being a Slytherin, I’m being smart about it. I’m doing as they tell me so that they’re going to trust me.’ Draco said, but he twisted his chair towards Harry.
‘I don’t intend to, Minister.’ Malfoy said, his voice still a little rough, but unwavering. Minister Shacklebolt dipped his chin in acknowledgement and then waved a hand at the doors, which opened.
‘Yay, cooking.’ He said in the least enthusiastic way possible. ‘Are you coming with us, Harry?’ Harry found his eyes drawn to the lonely figure against the wall.
The feeling was like needles stabbing him everywhere the stuff had hit bare skin. He could feel his temperature soar and he remembered feeling like he couldn’t breathe.
‘Are you nervous?’ Missy asked. They had just arrived at her little studio tucked away in a tiny building in Holyhead in Wales. Harry had no idea how Draco had found her. He’d been in Holyhead before to watch Ginny play, but he’d never actually properly visited the town. He’d been around when Ginny went to look for her own apartment (Molly was tearful but understanding), but then he’d just been dragged around to look at several different places that all seemed equally nice to him.
‘You chose this one.’ Harry said, maybe not with the right infliction, but Draco seemed to get what Harry was trying to say because he actually smiled.
‘Right.’ Harry remembered the sensation of feeling like he was burning up. That had apparently not been an exaggeration. ‘I’m better now though?’
Their next course was The Auror Advantage and Harry felt like his soul was about to fall from his body. He couldn’t focus. He’d had three cups of coffee and instead of waking him up like they usually did, they just made him feel like his brain was bouncing around uselessly in his skull. Like he wanted to bounce his leg and drum his fingers but his muscles just didn’t want to cooperate. Malfoy took one look at him and dragged him towards the back of the small conference room that they were to have today’s course in.
A little girl had gone missing from a crowded street in a Wizarding village. Six years old, named Millie, curious little girl. It could range from “she got lost” to “she’d been kidnapped” to “she wandered into something dangerous” and they needed to act fast. There were two Auror teams there plus Harry and Draco. The two Senior Auror teams were sent to the scene while Harry got a map of the area shoved into his hands and they were told to search the map for anything that could be easy to miss in a search.
‘Mrs. Malfoy.’ Harry greeted. ‘I like what you’ve done with the place.’ He motioned to the sitting room. She smiled coolly.
Thank you so much for reading! As the tags say, I am gonna make a few time jumps here and there, because I need time to pass for.... reasons. Anyways, I hope you don't mind. I'll post the next chapter on Friday!
‘Well, you can pull anything off, of course but-‘ Harry made himself stop listening to them, but he could feel that his face was frowning a little. He made eye-contact with Ginny across from him. She raised her eyebrow at him and threw a pointed look in Amelia’s direction. He shrugged at her but she didn’t seem to be convinced.
‘Do I do your eyes too?’ He asked. It was a little awkward like this, he had to get his wand right up in Malfoy’s face and try not to stare at the porcelain-esque skin.
Draco, who had already been heading towards the door, stopped and looked back at him, a confused little frown between his eyebrows. Harry must have looked pretty horrified because the realization dawned on his face pretty quickly.
‘I don’t quite understand what just happened, but I will take my NEWTs. I assume I can contact McGonagall for any further information that I wasn’t able to understand from the garbled nonsense you just spewed?’ Harry narrowed his eyes.
‘Where are we going?’ Harry asked as he realized they were heading to the Apparition point. Their offices were close to one so it only took them a minute.
‘Well, you are lucky I have more manners than you do, because I can assure you, you look worse than I do.’ Harry let his jaw drop in an exaggerated gasp.
Feeling a little bit like a naughty child Harry sat down. His legs felt a little shaky as he stretched them out in front of him. He was surprised to note that the little waiting room was empty apart from the three of them. To Harry’s surprise, Draco brought the first two cups of tea to Hermione and the Mediwitch who was putting up an admirable fight against Hermione. The next two he carried over to Harry.
And he's back! I didn't want to leave you all in suspense too long! We're heading into the final few chapters now. This has been fun!
‘I request that Harry James Potter speaks on my behalf.’ He eventually said in that stupidly posh voice, turning to the Wizengamot. There were some confused murmurs, but no one protested. Minister Shacklebolt motioned for Harry to head down to the little bench where witnesses were brought to give testimony.
‘We could have that talk tomorrow?’ Draco offered. ‘I mean,’ He looked uncharacteristically nervous as he continued. ‘I wouldn’t mind staying here, I mean, we don’t have to do anything obviously, I mean I’m not the most experienced person around and like I’m not tying to put you under pressure or anything and if you’re uncomfortable I can go home and- why are you smiling?’ Harry was seriously trying not to grin but he was just… adorable. His cheeks were pink and he wasn’t really making eye contact.
and his closet wasn’t even close to what Draco’s probably looked like, but it sure as hell made Harry feel more like an adult.
Ginny was sitting sideways in the soft dark green armchair, looking slightly bored. Hermione and Ron were on the couch, Ron looked immensely confused, while Hermione looked like she’d just realized something major and was trying to decide how to broach the subject.
‘Your hair confuses me, Potter.’ Draco said, struggling sincerely with Harry’s last name. ‘How does it work? It defies’ Harry was pretty sure that’s the word he was trying to say. ‘gravity.’
‘It’s 4am, why aren’t you asleep?’ Draco asked after three heartbeats. Harry sighed. He untangled himself from Draco with some effort.
want. Not what everyone expects from you.’ Draco ran a hand through Harry’s hair. Even though this was all very new, it didn’t
‘That just so happens to be the same as mine.’ Malfoy added with a smirk. He had taken off the red robe, but he’d left the waistcoat on and he looked
Friends. A friend hug. Sort of. A maybe-more-than-friends hug. A you-just-glanced-at-my-mouth-but-I-don’t-know-what-we’re-doing hug. A hug to try and make sure the guy you were half-way in love with didn’t die.
new. ‘Why did you become an Auror in the first place?’ Now that was a question he’d asked himself before.
‘How can they not accept him?’ Harry asked, handing both of them a plate. ‘He’s Ronald Weasley.’ Harry added with a grin.
Harry realized quickly that a lot of their Auror training would consist of their instructors basically throwing them into the deep end and letting them figure it out themselves. Their first course was Concealment and Disguise.
‘Of course.’ Harry smiled back at him. ‘Tell your mother I said hi.’ Malfoy raised another eyebrow, but didn’t comment on it.
‘Look, I’ll go to the Ministry, inform Granger and see what contact info we have on file for Amelia.’ Draco squeezed his arm and Harry looked up at him automatically. He’d been staring blankly at the doors. ‘Would that make you feel better?’ Those silly grey eyes were so sincere, Harry felt a treacherous wave of affection. He forced himself to smile.
‘We know you do Harry, but just think of how he’d react if he saw you like this.’ Hermione said. ‘He’d be so upset.’
‘Bloody fucking shite Draco.’ Harry said. He dropped to his knees so he could get a better look. Draco groaned. ‘That looks bad.’
Harry almost didn’t want to put his shirt back on and he spend about five minutes staring at his new tattoo in the mirror Missy had set up for this exact purpose.
‘I came up with most of it myself, thank you very much.’ Harry said, doing his best Malfoy impression. Malfoy almost rolled his eyes before he seemed to remember his mother was right there and that was not proper etiquette, or at least that’s what Harry was assuming was going on in Malfoy’s head.
‘Oh come on, if you’d just let me and Daphne teach you how to take your hair from “attacked by angry Hippogriffs” to “oh I just rolled out of bed”, it would make such a difference.’ She was actually pouting at him now. This was strange. Strange because it didn’t feel incredibly strange. He was having an actual, civil conversation with Pansy Parkinson. About his hair.
‘I told you to think about what you wanted from me, so that I would not owe you anymore. But instead of letting me pay off my debt, you keep doing things for me and just adding to it.’ Harry blinked at his annoyed tone.
‘He let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts.’ One of the members of the Wizengamot spoke up. ‘His actions lead to the Death of Albus Dumbledore.’
‘And the dramatic speech in there?’ Malfoy asked, still not taking the damn wand back. Harry’s arm was starting to protest. ‘How long did it take Granger to write that one?’
‘I’m glad to hear that.’ He said honestly. He had not even considered how his words would effect Hogwarts, but with McGonagall as Headmistress he wasn’t surprised things would have changed.
. He saw Draco fall into the Fiendfyre, he saw him fall off the Astronomy tower, he saw a green curse fly at him, so many of their cases where the scales tipped just the other way, he saw him bleeding out on the floor of a Hogwarts bathroom. Over and over and over again.
‘Well, because people always just assumed that’s what I would go and do, I never really looked further either. First there was just so bloody much going on. There was a war and people dying and fighting for my life and then dying but not quite dying and then suddenly I was an adult and I was tired of making hard decisions and so I didn’t think about it, I just did what people always assumed I would do.’
‘Especially once you become a professional Quidditch player and get me free tickets to all of your games.’ Harry grinned. She laughed.
‘Alright Harry, I am going to need you to take off your shirt.’ Harry nodded and easily pulled the plain black tee over his head. Draco had scoffed at his outfit, but now Harry could smile smugly at him. Draco’s eyes, however, were not on Harry’s face. Huh, interesting. ‘And you’re going to need to lay down.’ Missy added and the chair Harry was sitting on smoothly transformed into what was practically a bed.
Ginny said he had a bleeding heart, that he was caring about the wrong people, but she didn’t understand, she hadn’t been there.
‘Fine?’ Harry said, more like a question than an answer. ‘She’s very capable and she hates Gaulding with a passion, so we have that in common.’
‘Yes, sorry for keeping him from your weekly lunch. I didn’t realize until later.’ Harry said with a small flinch.
‘Potter, we’re getting out of here.’ Robards called as soon as Draco had disappeared. Okay yeah that seemed like a good idea. These people were not giving up and seemed hellbent on hurting them. Plus, they were outnumbered. He nodded sharply.
‘I hate it, but I understand.’ Harry had to force the words out of his mouth, even if he did mean them. The relief in Draco’s face was nearly painful. ‘I’ll miss you.’ The words slipped out before Harry had a chance to stop them. Draco had been moving to push himself off his desk, but he froze at Harry’s words. He let himself rest against the desk again with careful movements, like he was afraid to startle Harry.
a ticket, and otherwise you could ask Malfoy, they still have plenty of money right?’ She asked, tilting her head. Harry shrugged.
), but Draco most likely also had feelings for him. He did things for Harry he didn’t do for anyone else, he allowed Harry to do things he didn’t allow anyone else. Besides Harry, his closest friend in the office was probably Amelia and he
‘It’s just- here you are: the fearsome Draco Malfoy, stuttering and blushing because you can’t seem to say the word sex.’
‘He takes a lot of credit for other people’s work.’ Young was leaning against the wall next to the door, her favourite spot. ‘There’s a reason all Junior Aurors hate him.’
They found a deserted alleyway and Apparated to the warded courtyard near Ron and Hermione’s place. They chatted about the weather and if maybe they could take a trip to the Burrow soon to have a little play around on their brooms. It wasn’t all that easy to find a place to fly in London.
‘I’ll get one first,’ Harry offered. ‘she can get used to the idea on me and so when you get one she won’t flip out entirely.’ Ginny grinned sharply at him.
‘Not everything is about Hogwarts houses, Potter.’ Harry rolled his eyes but headed into his room to search for the green shirt. He left the top few buttons open and rolled his sleeves up to above his elbows. A little of Draco and a little of Harry.
‘You told me back then “you could come to Auror training with me and Weasley, it would be good for your reputation”, and I remember thinking: yes, it would be, wouldn’t it? And that’s why I started Auror training. I stuck around for a lot more reasons than just that, but that’s why I started.’
Harry was released the same day and the guy who threw the poison at him was caught by Hit Wizards the next. All in all, a pretty chaotic return to work, not his greatest week ever.
‘It’s going to be fine.’ Harry said, but it didn’t quite have the conviction he wanted it to have. Malfoy mumbled something he couldn’t quite catch.
going on. Ron and Hermione had just sort of fallen together, so they weren’t really any help either.
‘Yeah, I’ve seen one.’ He swallowed. ‘Cedric faced it in the first task of the Triwizard Tournament.’ Draco flinched.
There seemed to be at least four attackers if the frequency of the impacts said anything. He made eye-contact with Draco.
‘Very cool.’ Ginny agreed. ‘I’ve been wanting a tattoo for ages, but mom would kill me, so I’m waiting until I’ve at least got my own place.’ She’d just started playing for the Holyhead Harpies and Harry knew she could
allowed to die on me okay. I just know Gaulding will try to get paired up with me if you do and I don’t want that to happen so,
Harry let silence fall. He waited a few seconds before clearing his throat. Draco look at him over his shoulder with a raised eyebrow.
‘Ron I know what you’re going to say, we’ve had this discussion a million times. Having someone else in the apartment doesn’t make my nightmares better, all it would accomplish is me bothering you and Hermione. I’m fine. I’ll take a little more Dreamless Sleep tonight so that I can catch up on the sleep I missed last night.’ He looked his best friend dead in the eye. ‘I’m fine.’
‘Look mate, I know you miss Malfoy. Hell even I miss the smarmy git a little bit, but you need to take care of yourself.’ Ron said. His face went a little blank before he continued. ‘Oh Merlin and Morgana.’ Ron sounded horrified. ‘I am friends with Draco Malfoy.’ Harry snorted out a laugh and Hermione smiled. ‘Not the point, anyways, Moine’s right. You look awful.’
Harry looked back to check if Malfoy was okay and to his surprise Amelia had come to stand next to Malfoy and she was smiling her serene smile at him. He looked a little uncomfortable, which meant she couldn’t be acting mean towards him. Whenever someone did that he’d look bored.
‘I do, for both of them together. I want something for them individually.’ Draco nodded and then shrugged.
-‘ Ginny said forcefully and Harry realized Ron and Hermione had been bickering. ‘I think Harry just had a revelation, maybe you could stop arguing and feed the poor guy. He looks too skinny.’ Hermione’s eyes darted over him critically.
Harry started pacing. It had always been easy to spark an argument between him and Draco. They were both stubborn and Draco knew exactly which buttons to push and the other way around, but this mini-argument had been different. This wasn’t bickering for the sake of bickering or a genuine disagreement on a theory or the approach to a case.
soft.’ He said, probably going for his usual haughty tone, but he missed the mark a little. ‘Don’t try to distract me, back to yours, have you ever tried to tame it?’
‘What happened? Why can’t I move my arms?’ Harry managed to ask, although the words were a little garbled.
‘Also, you can stay the night, but we don’t need to do anything you don’t want to.’ Harry smirked. ‘I’m up for pretty much anything though.’ The look on Draco’s face was totally worth it.
‘Harry, I know you want to believe that the Slytherins aren’t inherently evil, and I agree with you on that, but for most of the ones in our year one or both of their parents went to Azkaban after the war. You need to be careful. Just because you want to leave the war and Hogwarts Houses behind you doesn’t mean they will do so as well.’ She said using her most pleading look to try and convince him.
‘Like, just the two of us maybe.’ She wasn’t looking him in the eye now and Harry could feel the heat crawl up the back of his neck.
‘Yes it is. I held onto it and now that I’ve got the chance, I wanted to give it back.’ Harry said, he held the wand at the tip and pushed the handle towards Malfoy. Months ago he would not have dared to put a wand in Malfoy’s hands, but now? He had kind of kept Malfoy from Azkaban, didn’t purebloods take their debts seriously? He really hoped so, it would fucking suck to die here, right now, after everything.
Harry obediently shovelled the rest of the food into his mouth, but it had lost all of its taste. He had thoughts just racing through his mind. Was Hermione sick? Was Ron okay? Had he done something wrong? Had someone died? When they came back Hermione’s face was blotchy, but she was not crying anymore and her breathing was normal. Harry swallowed thickly and put his plate on the coffee table.
to do. Hermione would become Minister of Magic, Ginny would become a professional Quidditch player and I’d be an Auror. It seemed as logical as Neville going to do something with Herbology.’
Oh, okay. His brain did not appreciate that. The little light that was coming through his curtains did not feel good at all. His head was pounding. Like there were a whole bunch of Centaurs running around his head. Not fun. A good reminder why he didn’t usually drink much. He groaned as he swung his feet over the edge of the bed.
‘Well, have you decided?’ A posh voice interrupted his search. He looked up and found- well, what had to pass for Malfoy’s muggle version. He had taken off his robes, just like Harry and he was wearing a crisp white shirt with an actual tie and matching waistcoat, both in a dark, rich green. He was wearing slacks and shiny shoes and he looked expensive and… well, good. He
‘I am looking forward to it.’ She didn’t count the galleons he handed over and that somehow felt nice. He did put his shirt back on, but he kept wanting to look at his side to make sure it was still there.
make sure you don’t leave the office again for the next ten years.’ Robards smiled. That was usually worse than when he glared. ‘As a reward for your actions today, you two get to stay behind and take down the wards
‘Oh right, you have lunch with your friends today, right?’ Harry felt like his brain had suddenly come back online
‘I could see you ribs!’ Draco threw out, pushing himself off his chair and pointing an accusing finger at Harry.
‘There’s no one out back.’ There were reporters at the front of the house, falling over each other to try and get the story first. Thinking about them made Harry feel even more sick. Harry pushed the door open with his magic, unwilling to touch anything here with his bare hands.
he supposed to use it for? The Auror, to his credit, didn’t do much more than blink quickly a few times. ‘I need to give a testimony.’ Harry tried.
Well, this is different. A Drarry fic, I've never written one of those before. My friend Lubs got me into Drarry a few months ago when I was so beyond done with the show I was watching at that time. This is completely self-indulgent and also already almost finished. It looks like it's going to be over 50k and I'm pretty sure I only have one chapter left to write.
Luckily, they only had to stand there awkwardly for about thirty seconds before the hedge rustled and Draco appeared, speaking softly to a little girl with huge blue eyes and blond braids. He froze when he saw Robards, Harry and the other two Aurors.
‘Yes, I was wondering when you were going to come and ask for one. You need to take better care of yourself, Potter. I’m not going to do it for you.’ No, but Draco would.
‘If you go, Draco can come here and get him out of here. There’s no space otherwise.’ She glared at Harry, hard, but she clutched the Portkey tight and disappeared. He breathed a sigh of relief, one down. ‘Dray! Get over here!’ Harry called out, motioning for him. Robards had joined Draco behind his cover and counted down on his fingers. On zero Harry fired a rapid burst of spells over his cover, giving Draco the time he needed to get over to Harry. Draco’s shoulder bumped into his as he slid behind cover.
Harry didn’t allow his nerves to spread any further than his fluttering stomach. He’d faced down Voldemort, he could do this too. The Minister went through what seemed to be the standard witness spiel and reminded Harry that lying in the court of law could be punished with imprisonment. Harry was tempted to roll his eyes but he didn’t because that seemed rude and the last thing he needed was a headline tomorrow questioning if The Boy Who Lived (Twice) had lost his manners in the war or if he’d always been this rude. There was also a flash in the back of his mind of a little lady dressed in pink and a searing pain in his hand.
‘Well, have fun with that.’ Malfoy said with a smirk. ‘I should be heading home.’ His smirk softened just a little and Harry was tempted to call it an actual
‘I’m serious, Harry.’ Harry swallowed. Draco didn’t call him Harry like this all that often. When he did he usually wasn’t looking right at him with this intense expression on his face. This was a lot for his poor heart.
. Now that he was an adult (and yes that was still strange), he could make his own choices and he wanted to get a tattoo to represent his parents. He wanted to have a reminder of them that wasn’t a lightning bolt on his forehead. That was a reminder of their sacrifice, he wanted a reminder of their
She seemed to be in her late thirties. Her hair was a dark purple and cut in a messy bob. She had tattoos all over her arms (which she was showing off by wearing a sleeveless shirt). She had an easy grin and she seemed so comfortable in her space and her art that Harry wasn’t even lying. He wasn’t nervous.
Amelia Frost smiled sheepishly at them as she found a seat. Harry liked her. She was a few years older than them, smart as a whip and a great dueller. She was also Ron’s trainee partner and had a talent for being
‘Wizarding tattoos can.’ Draco said, he looked a little uncomfortable, but not angry, which was his general go to when Harry saw/ did/ asked him something he didn’t want (him) to see/ do/ answer.
‘Well, you could always apply for the Auror programme with me and Ron.’ Now see, he usually didn’t have a problem with his Gryffindor-esque habit of just diving head first into something without thinking about it, but
lunch, but he also slowly seemed to calm down as no one else was really engaging with his complaining.
‘Hey.’ He managed. ‘How are they?’ Draco headed down the hall and Harry could feel Robards join him.
‘I’m always careful, Hermione.’ Both Ron and Neville burst out laughing at that. ‘What? I am!’ Harry said indignantly. He knew he wasn’t, he never had been, but it was so nice to hear them laugh, he wanted to make sure that he could hear it a little longer. Sure enough, even Hermione joined in. Harry found himself smiling as he looked at his friends.
‘So, you seem happy.’ Draco said as they stepped out into the sunshine. It was a ridiculously nice day, the weather seemed to reflect his mood.
The ceremonial robes were very nice, probably the nicest pieces of clothing Harry had ever worn, even Malfoy didn’t complain about the quality, just the colour. They were scarlet with a band of white around the edge, coming together over the breastbone. The sleeves came down to their elbows and were lined with gold thread. The robes had actual tails that made Harry feel extra fancy. Underneath, they’d been given a dark grey, long sleeved, high collared shirt and a gold coloured waistcoat. The pants were beige and pretty plain and the whole shebang was finished off with soft brown boots.
‘Glamours.’ Harry said. ‘We used them on our face and then just made sure we blended in. Walked right in the front door.’ He handed Malfoy his waistcoat and tie.
would work with him.’ He shrugged. Ron elbowed him in the side, but Harry ignored him. ‘Look, Minister. I understand that this is a strange situation, but the Wizengamot cleared him, he was found not guilty. Should he not be allowed to go after a job he wants? Should he not show an interest in catching wizards hurting others?’ Shacklebolt turned to Malfoy.
Draco was taller than him and having to tilt his head up was a new experience, but Draco’s hand cupped around his jaw was helping him along. Draco’s shirt was silky under his fingers and when he dug his other hand into Draco’s hair it was exactly as soft as he expected it to be. It was like a spark at the bottom of his spine. Something hot and liquid and warm that raced up and settled in his chest. It was a proper kiss too and Draco knew how to use his tongue. The thought that that was because he was a snake almost made Harry start to giggle uncontrollably.
‘There is nothing wrong with my clothes!’ Harry exclaimed as Ron managed to get the glasses down without sloshing anything over the edges.
. The first week or so after he’d been back, they’d been fine, but then slowly but surely, he seemed to get more… angry. Angry at Harry and he just couldn’t figure out what he’d done
‘Kinda.’ Harry admitted, staring very hard at the mark on the wooden coffee table that was vaguely shaped like a mouse. What a strange stain.
At first, they’d lived separately. Mostly because neither of them really felt like explaining to Headmistress McGonagall
‘To St Mungo’s.’ Harry nodded and he focussed all of his attention on the Wizarding Hospital. There was the familiar nauseating
‘Pansy, Daphne, Blaise, Greg, maybe Millie if she’s got the day off. I’m never sure.’ Draco shrugged. Right, so basically the Slytherins in their year. Harry was being invited to have lunch with all the Slytherins in his year. He could almost hear Ron in the back of his mind “this is a terrible idea” he’d be saying, but when had Harry ever let
Dawlish passed by Harry on his way into the breakroom, simply resting his hand on Harry’s shoulder for a second. It startled Harry into motion. Harry had no time or energy to process the look on Draco’s face before he threw his arms around him. Draco felt solid and
‘Yes, there’s been a string of witches and wizards ending up in St Mungo’s after taking bad potions. They figured out that these potions all came from the same supplier. An unidentified group that sells these potions for almost half the price their competition does. The potions are obviously made with bad ingredients or just bad intent, but wizardfolk still buy them because they’re cheap. They can’t seem to get anything on these people so they want me to infiltrate, get the intel we need to take them down and get out.’ Draco explained. He looked
‘No.’ He eventually admitted. Harry wasn’t exactly about to mention that might be because Harry had asked him not to.
‘Is this some sort of stupid Pureblood thing? Like a life debt or something, because I don’t want anything from you. As far as I’m concerned we’re even.’ Harry couldn’t quite control the flare of annoyance, why did Malfoy always have to make everything so damn complicated?
‘Malfoy here wants to apply to become an Auror.’ He said with clear disdain in his voice. Malfoy straightened up a little further, making Harry feel even more self-conscious about his slouching posture.
‘The warehouse Weasley and Frost are at.’ Something cold settled into Harry’s stomach. An alarm, no Juniors, Robards running.
‘It’s your body.’ Harry tried not to let the small squeeze of panic in his stomach get to him. Draco was just in one of his moods, it was fine.
‘Yes, that’s all. Have a good day professor.’ She turned around in a whirl of black robes and blonde hair.
Her name was Rosella Young and she was feisty. She actually reminded Harry of himself a little before he learned to (somewhat) control his temper. Her parents had wanted her to pursue a nice and safe career but she had hated every second of it. So after a few years of doing that, she’d decided she was now going to try things her way.
‘Well done.’ Robards said with absolutely no emotion behind it. ‘First ones back.’ Malfoy was rebuttoning the sleeves of his shirt. ‘What did you use?’
. ‘Thank you for inviting me.’ Technically Harry had invited everyone, but he had the idea that might be what Draco meant.
‘Thank you for pointing out the obvious.’ Harry clenched his jaw tightly in order not to bite out a nasty comment.
‘I invited him. Saturday’s are when I have lunch with my friends, I consider him a friend now.’ Parkinson nodded slowly, pressing her lips together in an amused sort of look.
‘Oh fuck off Draco. That’s bullshit.’ Harry snapped. ‘I told you I’d had a rough time for a while, but I wasn’t lying when I told you I was doing much better-‘
’ Harry asked, mildly horrified. ‘Where am I in all of this?’ Draco actually looked a little guilty at that.
‘I know, me too. Although I don’t mind it as much.’ Draco said with a wry smile. ‘I’ve always been angry at the world. Mostly for the wrong reasons, but, it’s not good for a person. It eats you up inside.’ Draco was still staring ahead. His profile looked as aristocratic as Harry remembered it.
Harry wanted to ask if he missed his parents, but he managed to stop the words before they tumbled out. Draco would not appreciate a question like that in front of someone he didn’t trust. Harry filed it away for later. Draco swallowed, pulled his face back into his blank mask and nodded.
Personally, Harry wasn’t the least bit interested in being anything of Gaulding other than a colleague, but he didn’t really seem to take the hint and Harry didn’t want to be rude. So he was polite and that was about it. Ron and Draco however, had taken it upon themselves to drive Gaulding away whenever they were around to do so (which fortunately was a lot).
Malfoy disappeared from view and just like that, it was done. His mother was next and Harry applied the same tactic. He waited until the end and then told Narcissa Malfoy to ask him to speak on her behalf. She did as he asked with much less hesitation than her son had. Maybe she’d somehow already heard what he’d done, maybe she realized that whatever he’d say couldn’t hurt her chances of getting cleared too much.
At their graduating ceremony, they were given the traditional scarlet Auror robes. Harry smirked and leaned over to Malfoy.
Draco was standing with his back towards him and right there, curling over his entire back, along his spine, was a dragon. The tattoo of a dragon. It was
Harry kind of liked the robes. They had been given the ceremonial one and would get their daily one later. They were not obligated to wear the daily robes, especially when they were on cases/ missions that were supposed to be low-key, the red was not subtle at all. They
‘I didn’t know tattoos could do that.’ Harry managed, his voice sounded a little choked. For Merlin’s sake, what the hell? What was wrong with him?
Months passed, Malfoy turned nineteen and Harry got him (along with some help from George) a truly obnoxious birthday card that wouldn’t stop singing Happy Birthday until Malfoy actually said “Thank you, oh great birthday card” to the card. He refused for three hours. It was hysterical. Harry had even been able to add Malfoy’s name. “Draco” had felt a little weird on his tongue, but Malfoy’s face was worth it.
‘An old Death Eater safehouse. They’re warded to all high heavens, hidden.’ Draco said on a heavy exhale. ‘I think my father took me there once when I was a kid. I remember him telling me that children could often go through the wards without problems because they hadn’t grown into their magic yet. Therefor the wards don’t recognize them as wizards, but more like…  magical animals.’
They went back to the Manor for lunch with Draco’s friends and Harry was glad he was there to see the look on their faces as Draco casually said: “thanks love” when he handed him the sandwiches.
‘That does sound like something I would say.’ He took off his coat and put it on the hook by the door, hanging his bag over it as well. He was still in that pearly, silky shirt. Harry busied his hands with his own coat to make sure he didn’t reach out to feel it.
‘Uh… I found her?’ He offered and Harry bit his lip, hard, to stop himself from laughing. Robards sighed.
‘Alright, now, here’s the final design.’ She handed him a sheet of thick parchment paper. ‘Take a good look at it, tell me if there’s anything you want to change, even if it is just a detail.’
‘Oh no it’s fine, he already told us he was going to miss that week.’ Ah, so as usual, Draco had planned ahead.
‘Need a breather, Potter?’ There was no judgement in the question, which he appreciated. Dawlish had been doing this a lot longer than Harry. ‘You should take Malfoy with you, if he gets any paler I’m gonna confuse him for a ghost.’ He motioned at the stairs behind him where Harry could just see the shiny dark shoes of his partner appear. As his hands appeared Harry could see they were clenched in fists. He did look pale and like he was trying his hardest not to show how disturbed he was.
There were about fifteen people in the room. The split between witches and wizards was pretty equal, but ages seemed to range from just-out-of-Hogwarts to mid-thirties and there was also once wizard who seemed to speak French and about three sentences of English. Harry wondered if he’d gotten lost. They went by last name so Malfoy went before either Harry or Ron. He looked stoic and calm. Harry crossed his fingers and hid them in the sleeves of his robes.
‘Huh.’ He said before he could stop the sound from leaving his mouth. Draco looked up and raised a questioning eyebrow. Harry wasn’t ashamed of it and it was unlikely that Draco would judge him for it anyways. ‘I didn’t take the potion I usually take last night, but I slept fine.’
Harry’s stomach growled. Draco rolled his eyes, so he’d definitely heard that. Harry smiled sheepishly and started breaking pieces off the cookie and eating it slowly, savouring the taste. These cookies were easily the best thing they had in the Ministry cafeteria and usually it was an outright battle to get one. Draco knew Harry loved them and somehow, he always managed to get one, no matter the time of day. Harry was convinced he was bribing the lunch lady, he just hadn’t found proof yet.
‘My aunt Bellatrix probably would have, but I never saw any of it.’ The name alone sent a hot flare of hatred up Harry’s spine. ‘She was insane.’
‘To be honest,’ Draco said, looking studiously at his papers as he shuffled them around on his desk. ‘Neither do I.’ He seemed to get whatever was on his face under control and he looked up again. His grin wasn’t quite convincing, the uncertainty was easy to read. ‘Although, considering our last potions case ended with you in St Mungo’s I’m also kind of relieved.’ Harry rolled his eyes.
They worked in silence for a while and it was comfortable. Harry was just about to finish the last part of his paperwork (the last file in his to do pile!), when suddenly there was the blaring of an alarm. Both him and Draco were out of their seats in a heartbeat. Harry barely managed to grab his coat off the back off his chair before he was out of the door.
Not everyone from their year was there, probably only about half. Harry had known some wouldn’t come back at all (after all, not all jobs required NEWTs) and some would choose redoing the whole year come September. Harry
‘What exactly are you apologizing for?’ Hermione asked, her tone making it immediately clear that she thought there were a lot of things. Parkinson clenched her jaw so tightly Harry was concerned for her teeth.
He got better. He still wasn’t great. He still didn’t sleep enough and he still hadn’t quite regained all the weight he’d lost, but he was doing better. Sure, maybe he was up at 3am that night and maybe that’s why he was awake for the message to be delivered directly to him and why he didn’t only see it at breakfast like a normal person would have.
‘I don’t know, okay? I don’t know when it happened I just- I don’t know. He’s different now, Ron. He’s actually kind of funny and he cares and he is weirdly into doing his paperwork and if I needle him enough he’ll do mine, especially when I have a headache and I don’t know how he knows but he always just seems to
he was attempting to have a conversation with him, but he’d already asked, so he could hardly back out now. Sure enough, Malfoy looked at him like he had grown a second head. ‘Hogwarts is offering everyone who was supposed to be a seventh year last year the opportunity to take their NEWTs in about a month. They’re offering tutoring to whoever needs it and if you don’t get the results you want, you get to redo them, but that does mean you have to redo the whole seventh year, which obviously won’t start until September, but it is a pretty good deal. Sure a month to prepare isn’t like an entire year but you were always pretty good at school, right? So it might not be a problem for you.’ Malfoy blinked at him as Harry snapped his mouth shut.
‘Maybe don’t ask her that, mate.’ Ron said, rubbing his hand along her back. He’d sat down on the arm of Hermione’s chair.
‘I have thought about it, quite a lot since I got the idea.’ Sure that wasn’t that long ago, but whatever. When had he ever thought something through? ‘I was thinking a stag and a doe running along my side, maybe.’ Hermione seemed to consider that for a few seconds and then she smiled softly.
?’ Draco asked with an uncharacteristic stutter. ‘I don’t know what to do with a child.’ His grey eyes were wide and he looked horrified. Harry rolled his eyes.
‘Unsure, they sounded the alarm.’ Every Auror was capable of sounding a direct alarm to the offices, but it was only used in extreme circumstances. The other wizards waiting at the Apparition point automatically moved out of the way of the three running Aurors. Robards held out both of his arms. ‘Side-Along, both of you.’ It wasn’t conventional to Side-Along two people, but desperate times…
‘I know you do, but I think it might be good for me. To have a place that’s just mine. I’ve never had that before, I’ve always had to share. Maybe I just need some time.’ Harry shrugged helplessly. He didn’t know if things would ever be better for him, but he refused to make his friends’ lives more difficult than necessary.
Okay, now for the not-so-fun part: telling Robards they’d left the office on a hunch without telling him. Harry jogged back to the main street. It wasn’t hard to find the trio of Aurors that included Robards (the advantage of the red robes). Harry knew exactly when Robards spotted him because his face went from “I am mad” to “What in the actual hell are you doing here?!”
To be completely honest, Harry felt entirely out of his depth during the examinations. And uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. That was mostly because the assessors had all either fought with him or looked at him like he was… well, the saviour of the wizarding world. No matter how many times he told them it had not
‘Rosella Young, yes and she got promoted like- uh, three weeks ago?’ Harry tilted his head. Time was weird, it would pass strangely sometimes. ‘So she’s a fully fledged Auror now.’
The backyard was overgrown and wild, but quiet and the air smelled clean. Harry stared for a minute, just taking in the clean greens and browns of nature.
No one really spoke to each other as they waited for their turn. It seemed that nerves didn’t make people chatty.
He shuffled into the kitchen and glanced at the clock. Only 9am, well, for how late they had been up, that wasn’t too bad. He started the coffee machine. No matter how many times he tried, he just couldn’t make coffee with magic quite like he could make it the muggle way.
good about myself today.’ Harry mumbled sarcastically, blowing into his mug, trying to cool the boiling water down to a point where he could drink it. ‘I had a rough night, I feel like shit.’ Harry said, shrugging his shoulders up a little higher, snuggling into the hood of his hoodie. It was a testament to how bad he looked that Malfoy hadn’t even commented on the oversized, obnoxiously red monstrosity Harry was wearing today. He normally never passed up on an opportunity to harp on Harry’s Muggle clothes.
‘Side-Along?’ Harry held out his arm for Draco. Draco put his hand on Harry’s arm. His fingers were still stupidly long and elegant. Harry forced himself to focus on Grimmauld place. The squeeze was over soon enough.
‘It’s perfect.’ He automatically passed the parchment to Draco next. He almost didn’t even register the surprise on his face. Harry made sure to smile as Draco accepted the parchment.
Malfoy snapped his eyes away from Harry after only a beat and fixed his eyes on the floor somewhere. Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen Malfoy look more… lost. Harry stuck his hand in his pocket just to make sure the wand was still there.
‘Are we really having this discussion again?’ Draco asked. He was wearing an almost pearly white shirt today and it made him look ethereal. Sometimes Harry wondered who exactly he got dressed like that for.
‘Well, I would assume Gryffindor is fire.’ Draco nodded and motioned for him to continue. ‘Slytherin is water?’ He mostly guessed that because fire and water were opposites. ‘And then, Hufflepuff earth and Ravenclaw air?’
‘Amelia, this is my sister Ginny and that’s my brother George.’ He said gesturing at the siblings in question. ‘Guys, this is Amelia Frost.’
‘Yes, I was thinking I’d work on my report a little first and then I’d go meet them for lunch.’ Draco seemed at ease at first, but as his brain woke up, Harry realized there was a tension in Draco’s spine that wasn’t usually there anymore. Not when it was just the two of them. It was almost a little unsettling how different Draco looked, how much he looked like the old Draco, like
Oh. Ah bloody fucking shite. When the fuck did he fall in love? This was just plain terrible timing on his part. As usual.
Draco didn’t try to argue, so Harry hurried up the stairs and did indeed find an old bag of his with some shirts stuffed in it. They smelled clean if not a little musty, so he cast a refreshing spell on it and brought it downstairs. It was a plain, dark blue shirt, soft and worn, but without holes. All in all, it could have been way worse. He stepped back into the living room, shirt clenched in his fist. He was half way towards saying something when he stopped dead in his tracks. He knew his jaw dropped.
