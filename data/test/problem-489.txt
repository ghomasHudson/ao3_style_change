Draco let out a giggle and hiccup. “No, silly. For...for everything. For, you know, before...”
Draco’s first finger breached Harry’s opening. Harry gasped, and Draco waited a minute for him to adjust before moving further in. Harry, ever the screamer, began swearing and groaning. Draco felt around for the special spot.
Artemis smiled. “I’ll be in my office this afternoon if you need me, Draco. Perhaps you and your not-evil aunt can do some catching up?”
“More,” Draco said through his teeth. And Harry gave more. It was a stretch, a good stretch with a bit of a burn. He probably should have let Harry warm him up more, but he would adjust. Harry ran a hand gently through Draco’s hair, the sweetest gesture Draco had ever experienced during sex. He relaxed more.
The next semester brought with it a new task for the seventh and eighth years: career planning. Between studying for NEWTs, therapy sessions, and career meetings with their heads of house, Draco and Harry’s relationship turned into mostly late-night cuddles. In Draco’s first career meeting, Remus handed him a chocolate bar and a cup of tea in his small chambers. Teddy was playing on the floor with blocks and giggling at some unknown baby joke. He was sporting blond hair today, a sign that he was happy to see Draco.
“Yes. Well, probably not in Azkaban.”
Draco raised his torso then stood suddenly. Harry groaned at the loss of contact. Draco stuck a hand inside his boxer-briefs and grabbed his throbbing member. “You need to see this?”
Harry and Ron let Rose lead Daisy around Diagon Alley as they followed along smiling. They visited the Magical Menagerie and Eeylop’s so Harry could get some owl treats. Ron let Daisy buy whatever she wanted from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, and Daisy thought George Weasley was the funniest person she’d ever met. Daisy wanted to look at broomsticks, and Harry talked up Quidditch as much as he could. “I want to see a Quidditch game!” she cried.
Harry smiled at him. “I could say the same to you. You didn’t have to accept my offer of friendship this time, not after I rejected yours so many years before. But I’m glad you did. I love you, too.”
“Oh shit! What was that?”
“What all would establishing a new department entail?”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.”
Harry shifted in his seat. Draco was enjoying this way too much to stop. “Now, there was one more boy in your dorm, right?”
Harry shrugged and looked down into his glass. “I love you.”
Remus left the eighth-years alone. The Ravenclaw boys—Anthony, Michael, and Terry—announced that they would not be separated and took off to claim a room. Hannah and Susan offered to room with Millicent and Daphne so that the Patil twins could share a room. Hermione kissed Ron goodnight and followed Parvati and Padma to their room.
Harry followed awkwardly behind Draco and paused as Draco entered his bedroom. His head spun. He was going to see Draco’s bedroom. Draco had paid attention to what would look good with his hair and eyes. And he was going to wear Draco’s clothes. “Um, Draco? I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but we aren’t built anywhere near the same.”
“I love you.”
Love that he decided Draco was worthy of.
While Harry enjoyed the evenings working with Malfoy, and he felt like he had a cause worth fighting for the first time in a decade, his nightmares had returned in full-force. He made a pact with himself to only use Dreamless Sleep once a week, just to catch up on the broken rest. He also had increasing anxiety about going out in public, instead sending a very old Kreacher to do his errands. The ancient house-elf didn’t have the energy to do both errands and housework, so Harry had taken up cooking and cleaning. It was a nice distraction, and it was the only time Harry could really practice his mindfulness lately. Plus, Kreacher’s commentary on Harry’s dusting skills was hilarious.
Harry’s cock leapt at the thought. “Please do. But I have to be at work by nine, so don’t distract
“Remus.” Her voice was barely a whisper.
Draco snorted. “I’m nervous, too.”
Harry kissed Hermione on the top of her head. “You’re the best.”
from Remus, books from Hermione, and candy from Ron. Andromeda had bought him a placeholder. Luna had sketched a drawing of him and Harry sitting by the fire in the common room. But there were three gifts that threatened to put Draco in tears.
Harry swatted him. “We can be as loud as we want from now on. No silencing spells. No worrying someone will walk in.”
She went on to discuss the symptoms of depression and PTSD. Draco was shocked to learn that physical symptoms like nausea can manifest. He wasn’t crazy, then. Other symptoms she listed felt like she was singling Draco out. But when he looked around, he saw everyone looked uncomfortable. When she mentioned addiction and risky behavior, both Granger and Longbottom shifted in their seats.
“I’m going to need a lot more of an explanation than that, Harry James Potter. You can’t just casually tell your boyfriend that you died and expect me to drop it.”
Draco grinned. “Well, I accept. But how did you know where I was?”
Draco kissed Harry. His own cock was throbbing.
“I read your statement,” Draco said in Harry’s ear. “Oh, Harry. No child should have to go through that. And I was such a shit to you when we were kids. If I had known...”
Draco grinned. Their nearby friends expressed their happiness for Draco. Even Millicent smiled at him. His old friends were starting to come around, slowly but surely.
When they stood to leave, Harry thanked Dudley for the meal. He nodded and gave Harry a warm smile. “Listen, Harry. I was a right shit to you growing up. And the way my parents treated you—well, I’m a parent now, and I can’t imagine treating a kid like that. You saved my life, and you had no reason to. I’d really like to stay in touch. I want you to meet Brian and Meredith. And I’d love some help introducing Daisy to your world. I don’t know much about it, and well, Meredith knows nothing but what I’ve told her.”
Harry took a piss, lost in his thoughts, until a flash of white-blond hair appeared in his periphery. He glanced over to see Draco Malfoy unzipping his fly two urinals down. For a fleeting moment, Harry wished Malfoy was next to him so he could sneak a peek. He pushed the thought aside.
“Yes. You will be given a grade for attendance. Now, you can choose your own roommates. There are two rooms for the young ladies, each with four beds. Miss Brown will take whichever bed is left when she returns. And there are four rooms with three beds each for the gentlemen. Summon a house-elf once you’ve decided where you’re staying, and they’ll bring your belongings. Any other questions? No? Very well. My little flat is just down the hall from Sir Cadogan’s painting, if you need me. Blue door. Goodnight, and welcome back.”
“Yes. Her idea. But if it’s too soon or...”
Andromeda handed him a small box wrapped in red paper. The tag read, “To Draco, from Mother.” It wasn’t her handwriting, though.
“Could they possibly slander either of us any more than they already have?”
It wasn’t long before Holyhead’s seeker caught the Snitch, giving a huge win to the Harpies. Daisy cheered along with all the fans, and it was so adorable that even Draco didn’t look disappointed. When Harry told Daisy that she was going to meet the Harpies’ chaser, she looked like she might burst. Harry led Daisy and Draco into the VIP section and down to the locker rooms. Harry, of course, was the only person in the crowd who didn’t have to show their VIP badge. Every now and then fame came in handy.
“S’allrigh’,” Harry said as he put his mouth back. He sucked and slurped until Draco was a babbling mess. Draco twisted his hands in Harry’s hair, moving his head up and down gently. It made Harry moan, which sent vibrations straight into Draco’s core.
And then he told her about Harry.
“Oh, fuck! Harry! Yes!”
“Bye, Magic Lady!” Daisy waved. She was a cute little girl, with blonde pigtails and a spattering of freckles across her nose. She gripped her father’s hand, and Dudley smiled down with pride at his daughter. His witch daughter. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose.
Once naked, Draco rubbed his hard cock against Harry’s. He swallowed his boyfriend’s moan with a kiss. Harry bit and sucked Draco’s earlobes, neck, chest.
At nearly one a.m., Draco yawned. “I’ve got to leave. I have to be at the potion shop at eight.”
Draco shrugged and flashed Harry a flirty smile. “That may be. But I’m your bastard. How long were you going to wait to tell me?”
When he finally stopped talking, Harry’s head spun with all the new information and emotions. But one question loomed above all his other thoughts. “Malfoy. Why?”
They took turns summarizing letters they had received from Draco’s teachers and the Headmistress. Two of them praised him for his change and for sticking to the terms of his probation. Shacklebolt remained neutral, as he was by far the most professional Minister in years. Well, when he wasn’t drunkenly singing karaoke, that is.
“Oh.” He blushed, and Harry found it endearing. In school, he had never noticed how Draco’s face gave away so much. “I do, too.”
“Of course, Harry. Come with me. I heard the house elves made treacle tart. I’ll get us some.”
“No, not at all. I just didn’t know. I’m not my father, Harry. You know that.”
Harry waved his wand and tied up the Ravenclaw. He cast a Patronus charm and sent a message to McGonagall letting her know a student was waiting immobilized after torturing Draco. Then he stood and held a hand out to Draco.
“Draco!” A hand touched his shoulder. “Draco, it’s me. It’s Harry.”
“You’ll see.” Harry held out his to Draco to side-along him, but Draco shook his head.
“Are you sad?”
Harry updated Draco on the fluxweed as they walked to Friday’s therapy session in the third week of school. He had nearly missed his morning watering session, but Draco had launched various items at his head until he woke up. Draco had already agreed to take on both weekend days of watering for the sleepy bastard. Seriously, who knew the Savior of the Wizarding World could nap so much?
Draco placed a gentle kiss on the head of Harry’s penis. Harry shivered. Draco darted his tongue out and swirled it on the tip, tasting the saltiness. He opened his mouth and took Harry in as deep as he could go. He liked to show off. Harry’s hips bucked, and he cried out. Draco moaned so Harry could feel the vibrations deep in his throat.
On top of the Malfoy sightings, Dudley had called Harry just a few days after their unlikely reunion. He invited Harry to his house for dinner. And it was strangely normal. Their kids were sweet and smart, and they liked their new Uncle Harry very much. “Can they call you Uncle?” Dudley had asked. “First cousin once-removed doesn’t have the same ring to it.”
Harry gave him many reassuring squeezes and kisses. Hermione, too, was extra friendly to him. But when they were off mingling, Draco sat with Arthur and the Grangers. They were the first Muggles he had ever met.
“I don’t know. Something fulfilling, something that makes a difference.”
“Oh, Harry.” Hermione’s voice was thick with tears. “You really believe that, don’t you?”
“Harry…”
Draco nipped Harry’s earlobe then whispered, “I want you to fuck me tonight.”
Harry smacked his arse. “You should use your talents to get me a glass of water.” Draco rolled his eyes and bent down for his wand. He summoned two glasses from the kitchen and filled them both with a wordless aguamenti. “Oh, right. Magic.”
Ron wasn’t feeling well on Saturday, and they canceled their usual plans. Harry thought about going out to the clubs and trying to pull—it had been six months of only fucking his hand, after all. But he couldn’t be bothered to get dressed up. Instead, he ordered curry and slipped a movie in the VCR.
Which reminds Draco—
As Draco fidgets with his Never-Ending Measuring Tape, the door to the drawing room opens, and in comes Potter's Disillusionment Charm. Disillusionment is right. Draco sighs, trying so hard not to sneer. "I can't measure what I can barely see," he says, releasing the end of the measuring tape and letting it snap back into its fathomless little case.
As far as Harry knows, he's wearing his dark green silk faille outer robe and sage green linen inner robe and trousers to the Gala. Draco begins owling him updates—he has no time or reason to visit Harry just yet. He has to get further along in his work.
Pansy pulls a face, wrinkling her pug nose. "If I must."
of loving me?"
Draco says with a sneer that involves sticking his tongue out.
"Still a step up," she sniffs.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco picks up his quill, dips it gently into ink, and sets it to parchment to finalize the details of his Luna moth design.
"You look amazing, Harry," Hermione says. "I knew Malfoy could make you something amazing."
"And yet," Narcissa Malfoy concedes, "he made a grave error in who he chose to follow, and as his faithful spouse I made the same error." Draco glances over his shoulder to see surprised faces bobbing up in the crowd, just as his had. "I continue to live with this regret. My husband could not."
"Harry—" Weasley's voice. Ron Weasley, Draco clarifies to himself, since there are so many Weasleys roaming the party. Both Harry and Draco snap their heads in time to see Ron Weasley looking as though he's walked in on his parents having sex. "I, er—"
and features the iconic fluevog cubist cupcake boots! because i cannot help myself.
"Oh, you love it," Malfoy says, crossing his arms and sneering. "Everyone's so far up your arse they're crawling up into your head. That's why it's so big. It's a wonder you can keep it upright."
For a moment, Draco doesn't get it.
"You can pour yourself a glass, you know. If you want."
Draco takes the jar of Floo powder from the mantle, holds it up to Harry like an offering at an altar. Harry reaches in slowly, grains of powder slipping from his pinched fingers.
, before more lives are lost. Harry won't be able to complete it on his own, not fast enough.
"Given I was invited," Draco points out as he chooses a seat in a Chesterfield armchair near the unlit fireplace, draping his cape over its back, "I rather think the implication is fair." Potter's posted himself on a matching Chesterfield sofa, catty-corner to Draco's seat and facing the fireplace. The whole room is kitted out in tufted leather seating, with dark paneled walls that match the walnut side tables. Draco's almost surprised Potter didn't make his dramatic appearance in a quilted Muggle house robe, puffing a pipe.
Granger sighs. "Well, you've come all this way for nothing, then, because Harry hasn't spoken to us in years."
"Potter!" Williamson suddenly isn't listening anymore, tearing past Draco for the door. Draco whirls to see, on the other side of the glass, a cowering Dendron before a Harry Potter on his feet, wand raised in a tight fist. Draco pelts after Williamson, only seconds behind him.
"Has it occurred to you that I don't
Draco rolls his eyes. "I couldn't, you debase yourself so well I'm too self conscious to try it for myself."
"You can say I look like I've been peeled off the floor of a pub, I won't immediately start raiding your liquor cabinet," Draco scoffs. His hair is thrown into a loose ponytail, off center with flyaways aplenty, his beard could most charitably be described as shaggy, and his clothes consist of a rumpled, untucked button-down shirt in a pale green viscose, paired with plain black slacks and short black boots. (For all that Pansy told him to keep his nipples to himself, today Draco's failed that imperative at last.) "I'm clean, I'm dressed, I'm here. Shall we?"
cut them off, and now look at you, stuck with me for emotional support. No wonder you continue to be a mess."
Dr. Fiddlewood wrinkles her nose in place of a laugh. "Oughtn't I be a judge by now, with all these courtroom goings-on in my offices?"
"Everything," Ron repeats, fixing Harry with a meaningful look. "It had better be everything."
Draco looks at Potter, and his loneliness is like a black hole inside him, pulling at his every fiber until it hurts. "What's the next step up from mortal enemies?"
"You haven't been outside your home in ten years. You don't know what it's like out there. I'll be the judge of what's mad between the two of us, thanks. Now stop
about this.
The knob turns. Pertinger's head snaps forward, her eyes locked on the door, and as Potter enters, she begins to scream.
"Oliver Wood is still a free agent, somehow. Viktor Krum, as well—something about Quidditch Players, isn't there?" Draco says, well aware he's babbling.
Despite Draco's fears, Larch makes his return with the personnel file in hand. He thanks Larch softly, and watches the young man dip his head into Potter's office before walking out of sight, likely to his own desk. Draco assumes he's keeping Potter abreast of
"Getting there, dear." Molly taps a cabinet door and it swings open, revealing precarious stacks of plates. "Would you get your cousin and set the table?"
"To do research!" Harry throws his hands up. "Not to—to throw yourself at danger after fifteen years of not doing magic, much less trained defensive magic, Draco!"
"Of course I care what my date thinks!" Harry leaps back to his feet in his anguish, his black organza sleeves floating as he gesticulates in wild arcs. "Is this some weird Pureblood mannerism I'll never understand, to hold someone at arm's length until you're, I don't know, married? What is this?"
"Twelve—? Wait, that's my—" But Harry is gone, and Draco's only recourse is to take a pinch of powder and follow him.
"Harry," he whispers, and takes one step into the room. The floor creaks loudly beneath his foot.
And to help Head Auror Potter and his team, one Draco Malfoy, contracted until the case's end by the Ministry for his scholarly expertise in the Dark Arts.
Draco draws his bottom lip between his teeth, then hears his mother's voice telling him it's uncouth and releases it. "Right. Of course."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Something like that." Harry can feel Malfoy's eyes on him. "All I can do is try to keep up."
"Why haven't you come back in all this time?" he asks instead.
"She doesn't come over." Harry's hand seems stuck to the handle of the kettle as he glares at it. "Nor Ron."
"What?"
Draco forces his eyes open. As they adjust to the light cast by a single lit wand, his body exploding with pins and needles as feeling returns, he focuses on the figure in front of him.
Draco calls over Pansy and Blaise to take his mind off it, because he must. And Greg, too, because nothing will keep him from erotic thoughts quite like listening to Greg talk about his new passion, which is beer and the brewing of it. Bless his friends and their annoying approach to hobbies.
"You're vile," Harry says, scrubbing at his cheek, but he presses a chaste kiss to Draco's mouth. "But correct, I suppose."
"I never said that." Draco lets Harry kiss his fingers. "I'll
"You know, Harry," Draco says, during another round of working past office hours at Grimmauld Place, "maybe you're just out of practice being social, and that's why you won't invite your friends round to your nice clean house." Draco's got the whole place in order, now, and when he comes over to work and spots Harry do so much as kick off his shoes and leave them in the hallway, he sends the shoes flying to hit Harry in the back of his dense head. He's also seen Dr. Fiddlewood early this morning, so he's feeling particularly socially reckless, giddy with her list of things to try.
The wards rumble gently as he passes through them, and he enters the fields surrounding the manor grounds. The plants here are tall, dotted with yellow canola flowers, and Draco lets his hands trail across their stems. The cultivated fields nearby grow much denser, so thick with flowers they look like a sea of gold, but here the plants' only owners are nature itself, and seed pods wobble and drop as Draco passes through. The sky is cloudless, bright with a moon that's nearly full.
"So it's true what they say. Dumbledore and McGonagall kept you in the castle for your celebrity status even though you should have been expelled first year for failing all your classes."
"Rivals?"
Molly pauses, clasping a tea towel between her hands and regarding her grandchildren over her spectacles. "Now, really."
"Harry," he calls. "Please."
A tiny room. A basement room, by the looks of the boarded-over windows near the ceiling. One door, behind which he hopes there are stairs. A wall that doesn't match its neighbors, haphazard and cheap-looking. Nothing in the room itself, he notes, careful anyway not to take any steps just yet. And on the floor—
"Just you?" Ron asks. "I mean—not that you can't be—"
"Of course I did," Draco interrupts. "That was never in question. You look lovely, by the way." He gestures at Hermione's gown. "Who made this for you?"
, and because there's two of you in there, it feels like there's somehow, I dunno, double the colors?"
appreciated," and she fixes her husband with a brief, hard look, "we don't need the unabridged version. What we need is for you to go to Harry."
"I don't think it was much of a joke." She worries her lower lip as she reads the fourth request. "You lose control when it comes to Potter. It doesn't matter if you're plotting to destroy his happiness, or make him the belle of the ball—you get messy."
The look Harry sends Draco's way is one full of suspicion. "I'm sure you've wondered."
"I sold her robes!" Dendron sobs.
you could never change!"
but he can only hope to someday be totally in charge of his words.
"This feels less like an exchange between business partners and more like being told off by someone's mum," Draco grumbles. Certainly not
"But the Gala's in—"
"Who?" Hugo asks, right before Rose elbows him hard in the ribs. "Ow! Rose!"
"Harry, it was a scheduling error—"
Her eyes are lidless, fixed only on Potter, and whatever Potter thought he might say has been buried under her screams.
"Oh, I love this already," she snickers, drumming her fingertips against the side of her wine glass, which she's holding wrong again. "Alright then, debase yourself."
"Oh, you're trying to be clever, I see," Draco says, watching Harry heave himself up. "It wasn't a very good attempt, but points for effort."
Molly makes a visit, and just as she had within the first year of Harry's disappearance, she brings him lasagne, meat pies, hearty stews, heaps of roasted vegetables, and all other kinds of recipes usually meant to feed an army of Weasleys. She brings him desserts, too, like an enormous seven-layer trifle, a raspberry-lemon tray bake, and a rich-looking chocolate cake, all floating in behind her under miniature shielding and stasis charms as she Floos into the cottage.
That's not what Harry had said when Draco's Patronus had changed its shape from a peacock.
Draco frowns, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, and he and Hermione snip a few more plants in silence before Ron comes back into the garden with a new basket for them.
And Harry is next to him. Not awake, no, but under the coverlet with him, his head pillowed against the arm he has draped across Draco's shoulder. There's a thin line of drool at the corner of his mouth, and Draco can't believe he didn't notice Harry's gentle snoring until now. Draco shifts his leg under the covers, and finds Harry's own just next to it.
Potter sits back up, looking at Draco with eyes that flick gently over every part of him, before settling on his face. He frowns, rolling his lips between his teeth, then holds out his hand. His left hand.
"Er, it might have been," Potter replies. He's wearing a simple moss green T-shirt with lightwash jeans in a relaxed fit, neither offensive nor inspiring. It's an upgrade from the ratty jumper he'd worn last time. "Are you alright?"
"And do those memories counterbalance the bad so much you couldn't do with a fresh start?"
"Is it a crime," Malfoy says, sinking slowly down the wall to sit in the grass, "to want a bit of company because it turns out you're just as alone as you ever were?"
Potter shakes his head. "Didn't see the point. And now that I look like this, I... I don't know. I asked for you because I didn't want to think about it. I really did think you'd just pull another perfect design out of your arse, I'd make my mandatory appearance, and that would be that."
And when he gets home to the house that has been waiting to welcome Harry back, and will go on waiting still, he cries until he throws up, then cries until he falls asleep.
Harry strides toward Griselda, his face a mask of rage, his magic one wordless concussive blast after another that keeps her off her feet. She snarls at him from her place on the floor, and he staggers back, but then he throws his arm out and she's pinned, spread-eagle, to the wall. Draco's vision is darkening, narrowing. The brick grows chains, ropes, vines, anything it seems Harry can think of to bind her there. It doesn't stop her, of course, and Harry is blown back again by several feet.
"Stop, I've never lied about my age. I'm a fun 33." Her fingers wiggle. "Ooh, I'd die for a smoke. I've had enough of watching you soak up all the attention like you did third year for that thing with the hippogriff, Draco, I'm off."
"Would you go if I did?" Harry asks, snorting as he grips his shirt in one hand.
He puts down his pencil and buries his face in his hands. It's not even a realization—it's an admittance, to himself. With every redesign of Harry's Gala ensemble, he came closer to the truth—both of what Harry wanted, and what he himself did. His first design was thoughtless, a shallowly pretty bit of
"Harry," Draco pleads, the name riding a hiccup.
"Oh, bugger off. What I was trying to say is I know I brought up the past, and now I regret it." He wiggles the glass on the bar, watching the beer splash from side to side. "Not because I don't believe that you're sorry—I do, and I'm glad to hear it, I really am. But I came here to get away from thinking about the war, and people getting hurt, or dying."
For a moment, Harry doesn't move, still staring at where the stairs disappear into the ceiling. Then he sighs. "Alright. Off we go, then." He starts off for the sofa, Draco waddling behind him without disentangling himself from Harry.
"Then Charlie did something?"
"A picnic?" Draco asks, otherwise dumbstruck.
"You were a horrible little boy," Blaise reminds Greg.
The news comes to Draco by way of a hastily penned owl from Narcissa, which includes the time and location of her Portkey arrival, given that she is forbidden Apparation. Ink blots surround her words from the speed at which her quill must have moved, and still her letter has only just beaten the Prophet to the manor's breakfast table.
"Yes, in your best rags," Draco says, meeting Potter's smirk with his own, albeit less rueful and more playful. He hopes it's the right kind of playful.
Harry nods. "I hated it, growing up. And unlike clothes, you
"But look at you now! Draco Malfoy the Squib, breaking into dens of evil and solving the case!" Griselda claps, though she never lets go of her wand. It looks like her father's wand. He thinks it actually
"I just—alright, let's say that's a really good point, and I should have never been at the scene because Griselda Yaxley could have drained all my power like some kind of magic mosquito," Harry says, flapping one hand near his face as if to wave off said mosquito. "You could have told me as much, and then you could have waited for the blasted Aurors to arrive!"
unlock it, and then, yes, there are stairs going up. He keeps his feet to the sides where the steps are least likely to creak. He feels pretty successful in sneaking around, at least—maybe he ought to apply for Harry's job once he's quit. Head Auror Malfoy indeed.
Harry frowns. "You're not well, Malfoy." He clears his throat. "Draco."
, and Auror Potter calls for backup to help him and his team transport the children to warmth and safety. Auror Potter also goes on to round up the bastards who thought of children as a disposable resource, catching the ones who escaped the house within the week.
The last thing he remembers with any clarity is the bed dipping under a second body beside him, and Harry's voice whispering, "Goodnight, Draco."
Draco doesn't wait. Harry's strong body is tensed, rooting him to the floor with rage, but when Draco's fingers close around his wrist he lets himself be taken. Amid a jumble of
Once Ginny's gone, there's a short beat before the two of them burst into laughter.
Potter sets the organza aside between them, shifting to stand. "Do you need to go into the studio today?"
is that the end? that's the end. cat called this ending line "jane austen hands" which is how i stopped agonizing over it lmao.

"I'm sorry for that business with that horrible Skeeter woman." Suddenly Malfoy stands taller. "But you and I, we're even when it comes to attacks."
"I can't believe I ever let you fool me into giving it to you in the first place."
, the legs of the tables and chairs so intertwined he almost gave up on it.
A hand peels down the top of the parchment, and Harry's face is on the other side. "I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important, Draco."
"Malfoy," Potter says.
"And let him know how much we still love him, and want him back in our lives, warts and all."
The kitchen has nothing in common from the snatches of memory from his youth. The practically medieval vibes he recalls are gone, replaced with a fairly modern kitchen, though it looks well lived-in. The broken-down cabinets, once resplendent in a dark walnut, have been repaired and repainted in white, a sort of shabby chic that suits Potter. There are dishes in the sink, a stain on one of the counters, and most jarringly, a refrigerator. There's never been one of
how red he is, cheeks practically stinging.
To Draco's surprise, Harry laughs, though the sound is gentle and the expression doesn't quite reach his eyes. "You know, I do, actually?"
Harry takes one of Draco's hands, his fingers terrible brands against Draco's skin, and puts it on the cover of the album. "I just didn't realize, before now," Harry says, so soft it's almost a whisper, "how serious this is for you, and I should have."
Within hasty moments, Draco is shod, cloaked, and armed with his wand, striding through the portal without so much as a message left to anyone who might look for him. The irony is not lost on him, but this is
"Never, Harry." The words come out in a voice so small it’s nearly inaudible.
"Er—something like that," Harry says, continuing to set out food. "Lunch?"
"D'you need help bringing the bags in?" the other voice inquires.
Draco does his best to give her a broad smile on the fly, and she returns it with a hesitant smile that's much smaller, fluttering off her face in a matter of seconds. Then she returns to her task of laying out plates, ducking her head down.
It's stupid. It's absolutely impossible. Harry hasn't ventured outside of his home in ten years. For all that he's grown comfortable with Draco, that's exactly what this is; he's not used to anyone else. He's frightened, whether he admits it or not, and he needs his tailor on hand to assure him he doesn't look like a jackass, or to fix his attention-grabbing ensemble if something happens to it.
Echoing them—subtly, because Draco makes clothes, not costumes—will be the crown of many antlers, a holy disk of branching bone, floating just behind Potter's head. Not real bone, of course—Draco is always careful to not veer too macabre, for the sake of the atelier—but one of Pansy's beautiful charm halos, casting a silver glow that will backlight Potter's face.
Harry snorts. "Not likely! I'm a Kestrels man now that I've grown up."
He knows what blood looks like after it's dried where it spilled. It's an old stain, nowhere close to fresh, but it's big, as though its living container was allowed to bleed out into a big pool. He suppresses the urge to retch.
. Five years of being deprived of the love of his life, and now—now they'll be over. He can start a new chapter in his life, if not pick up where the previous, interrupted chapter left off. Everything will be okay now.
Pansy sighs. "Don't stay too much longer, alright?"
"Next time you see me, you can apologize some more," Harry says. "Can you find your way back from here?"
"Be good while I'm gone," Harry says on the seventh morning, running his thumb over Draco's chin. "No extradimensional portals. No dark allegiances. No megalomaniacal plots."
just about as soon as he writes it—but there's no looking back now. He puts it aside, then sets about writing a letter to Harry.
Before Draco can reiterate that he's leaving,
I was reading advanced texts."
"Well." Harry clears his throat. "You might have been a person more prepared for the outdoors."
"Oh, don't be that way, Potty," Malfoy says, leering as he props his chin on his steepled hands. "I'm enrolled in the Harry Saint Potter reform school of not being an evil git anymore, as of earlier today, remember?"
"I swear I've seen you make that same stitch five hundred times," Harry says a few hours later, sitting across from Draco and watching him continue his embroidery at the dining room table.
lock; everything she says sounds like scripted ad copy, and not by a particularly talented copywriter, either. She'd glittered so beautifully in her Malfoy Couture, though, so he's never told her he finds her stilted and corny to her face.
Harry shook his head. “Because you realize they were shit choices. Because you’re fighting those choices every day.” He bumped his hip into Draco’s. “And because you put up with me.”
And then Malfoy did something even more unexpected than apologizing. He smiled. The most amazing smile spread across his sharp features and lit up his eyes. In all their years of school together, Harry had never seen Malfoy smile like that. “I would.”
Harry paused outside, gaping at the sign on the door. He’d never been to one of these restaurants, never had a reason to. No date had ever seemed worth it. But he’d heard so many great things about the French restaurants with waitlists and three-course dinners. He felt, well, special.
“I don’t need your charity, Potter.”
Draco banged a spoon against his drink to call everyone to attention. He cleared his throat. “I want to thank all of you for your support. We’re really going to make a difference in this world. And I could not have done it without all of you, writing letters and testifying at the Wizengamot and talking to your friends. I especially want to thank Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley for their help. But most importantly, I could not have done it without the love of my life, your very own Savior, Harry Potter.”
“She witnessed terrible things last year, with the Carrows. But she was so brave. She might be more Gryffindor than Godric himself.”
Daisy was dressed in a pink dress and wore a tiara on her head when Harry arrived. She was excited for her first “magical” birthday. She would have a Muggle birthday party with her school friends next week. Harry wrapped her in a huge hug and handed her the gifts he had bought. She bounced off, and Harry sat next to Brian and played video games until Rose arrived.
“That’s quite sweet of you, Harry. Thank you.” She kissed Harry on the forehead and grabbed Neville’s hand. “Let’s go, love.”
To top it off, Harry realized that he had taken Dreamless Sleep three nights in a row. He had to stop or risk an addiction. Maybe he could find a way to tell Draco he wanted to sleep alone. He looked at the sleeping blond and remembered last night. Yeah, he wasn’t sure there was an excuse good enough to get rid of Draco for a night.
“I’ve known since sixth year and suspected since third.”
“Ready?” Steve asked them both.
As Harry was debating whether or not to say hello to Malfoy, the sorting began. The Sorting Hat’s song was surprisingly upbeat and optimistic, which did not seem to match anyone’s mood. Harry zoned out as all the first years were sorted. Ron had to nudge him when the food arrived.
“You’re right. I’m not exactly a gifted writer, either. Maybe Hermione could help.”
“Come on,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand. “Let’s go somewhere more private.”
“Harry.”
“I’ve never been to a restaurant like this. Don’t they have weeks-long waits?”
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry whispered.
The lines of tension in Draco’s face eased. “That sounds great.”
“The happiest.”
Harry thought for a moment. He wanted to deny it. Daisy was just six, after all. But he thought of the way Draco told Daisy the truth about Harry and Voldemort. Daisy would know if he lied, anyway. “Yes, I’m sad.”
Draco sighed. “I don’t know what it is about you that makes me turn into a bloody, cuddly badger. Next thing you know I’ll be wearing yellow and black. But yes, I’d like to do this. All of it, not just the sex, although that shag was the stuff of legends.”
“And how has that worked out for you?”
Harry put his hands up in defense. “It’s not charity! It’s polite! But whatever. Give me my knuts.”
“Thanks.”
In the ten years since the war had ended, Harry had become quite skilled at avoiding the darkest parts of his past. Sure, there was the annual celebration in May that required a speech, a few interviews, and an awkward photo shoot. But even then, he tried to keep his focus on the present and the future: look how far the Wizarding world had come, and look how far they still had to go.
Harry grinned and placed a kiss on Draco’s lips. “Don’t splinch yourself. It would really put a damper on my plans.” He disappeared with a pop.
After nearly two months of evening meetings, including several with Blaise, Draco and Harry were ready to meet with the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and the Minister. With Harry’s help, the pair had collected the requisite endorsements of the law from members of the Wizengamot. If Chief Warlock Dawlish and Kingsley approved the draft, it would be added to the Wizengamot’s agenda.
Soon, Harry was balls deep inside of Draco.
Harry’s prick jumped at the mention of toys but quickly settled back down, spent and exhausted. “Toys, eh?”
“The paperwork for starting a charity. It’s a bureaucratic nightmare.” He pushed the papers aside as Harry summoned plates and forks fromt he ktichen. He rummaged through the takeaway bag. “Did you get raita?”
Harry snorted. In general, he agreed that MLEP officers were incompetent. Indeed, it was one too many botched Obliviates by MLEP that gave the job of dealing with Muggle witnesses to the Aurors. And MLEP were the arch-rivals of the Aurors in the annual inter-office Quidditch tournament. But Seamus was an officer, so they weren’t all bad.
Draco shook his head. “No, not that.”
He snapped his hips, and Draco lost himself to the panting and grunting and the sound of Harry’s balls slapping against him. Harry took one of Draco’s nipples in his mouth and flicked it with his tongue. Draco responded by raising his hips, inviting Harry deeper.
Draco opened his mouth then closed it, unsure how to respond. “What do you want to know, sir?”
“I guess you’ll never know if you made the right decision. We can’t ever know that about anything. But for what it’s worth, I’m glad you decided to come back.”
“I’ve wanted to see you for so many years, Harry. But I had no idea how to reach you.”
Draco smiled. “Excellent. I’ll see you tomorrow at one.” His face disappeared from the flames, and Harry was once more left alone with his thoughts. He sighed. He had just given himself a deadline. There was no avoiding it any longer.
“I love you, Harry Potter.”
“You have certainly embraced Muggle culture,” Harry commented.
“Did I? Well, we’ve been spending a lot of time together. Might as well.”
“Bossy git.” But he did as he was told.
“I do.” Lupin pulled a bit of the cloth back to reveal a baby head with bright blue hair. “He is in a post-breakfast coma right now. But I’m sure you’ll be seeing a lot of him this year.”
“Have you eaten?”
Harry flashed a smile. He whistled all the way home.
One jinx after one hex after one curse. Draco fell to the floor, unable to grab his wand to throw up a shield. “It should have been you!”
Slowly at first, Harry swirled his tongue around the puckered flesh. “Fuuuuuccckk,” Draco breathed. Smiling at Draco’s pleasure, Harry sped up his efforts, licking, sucking, kissing, and darting his tongue inside of Draco.
“Friends?” Harry’s bright green eyes widened. “Are we friends?”
“I take it you liked your present?” Harry asked.
Harry chuckled. “So demanding. But we are celebrating your win. I guess I’ll let it slide.” He whispered a cleansing spell that made Draco shiver as it worked. Then he lowered his head between Draco’s beautiful, pale arse cheeks. He started with one long, smooth lick. Draco let out the most glorious moan, encouraging Harry to continue.
“With our…complicated…history, I suspect that any physical activities will be intense and charged and amazing.” Draco moved his hand to Harry’s thigh and stroked upward toward his groin. Harry gasped as his cock began to respond to Draco’s touch, even through his jeans.
She straightened and looked at Draco. “Malfoy.”
A single tear ran down his cheek. His stomach hurt, and he wanted to run away. He looked at Harry, who nodded at him reassuringly. “I get nauseous all the time. Everytime I think about anything related to the war. I get these flashbacks to…Well, the slit-nosed bastard lived in my house. Whatever you imagine, I can guarantee you it was worse. And then I get flashbacks to before. My father was an arse. I hate him. I’ve hated him since he made me take the Mark. He’s mean and cruel and deserves far worse than a life sentence.”
Harry nodded. He pushed a finger inside Draco with a bit too much enthusiasm. “Ah! Slow.”
“Thank you.”
Draco collapsed on the ground next to Harry, panting like he’d just run a marathon. But Harry was too turned on to let him rest. He planted his lips on Draco’s, letting Draco taste himself. “That was so hot. I need to be inside of you.”
“Of course not.” Harry laughed and squeezed Draco tighter.
“I want to do this, too.”
Harry enjoyed explaining Quidditch the wide-eyed girl. And he had Draco to help. Daisy couldn’t decide which team to root for because Draco cheered for the Falcons and Harry, out of loyalty to Ginny, cheered for Holyhead. So, Daisy cheered for both.
They got off at the stop for Charing Cross Road, the Tube exit closest to The Leaky Cauldron. He pointed out the pub, obscured from the sight of Muggles, and watched Daisy’s eyes widen as she saw it appear before them. For the first time all morning, Daisy was speechless. “Come on, little Daisy. Let’s go find some magic.”
“Thank you, Professor. I’ll abide by these terms perfectly, I promise.”
Harry sighed. “I don’t…please don’t look at me like that. I died, I came back, and now I’m here.”
“Malfoy.”
Harry processed this. Draco stared at the floor. “When exactly were you going to invite me out to a romantic dinner?”
Artemis had them start by introducing themselves so she could learn all their names. They were to say their name, former house, and favorite dessert. How stupid. Draco fought against rolling his eyes. He had to play nice, or he could go to Azkaban. “Draco Malfoy, Slytherin, chocolate.”
“But there is so much history between us—unpleasant history—and I feel like we need to talk about it.”
It worked. Harry pushed himself further down. It was so tight that Draco swore he saw stars. He hadn’t fucked someone in a long time, and it was pure bliss. He let Harry continue to ease down onto him.
“Draco. I won’t insult you by pretending that your past decisions won’t make some things harder. There will always be those who look at you with disdain. Trust me, I know. But there are also those who will see what you have become. Who you have become.”
“Have you heard from Lavender?” Hermione asked Parvati.
“Well, Daisy needs a know-it-all about this world. And I need someone else to help me answer all the questions she asks. It’s a win-win.”
“Well, here’s your paneer masala. It’s one of my favorites.”
Draco placed a quick peck on his cheek. “Let’s go to bed, love.”
“Right, right. And you won, I take it?”
, so at least that one wouldn’t be bad.
“You know I do. Come here, I’ve been waiting less-than-patiently for you all day.”
Blodgett nodded. “Of course, Mr. Potter.”
They finished their breakfasts without another word. Draco got up when the Golden Trio did and followed a few steps behind them to the classroom. He heard jeers of “Death Eater” and “Traitorous bastard” and a few other colorful insults. But no one would risk a jinx hitting one of the three most famous people in all of Wizarding Britain, so he was safe.
She studied him. “Okay.”
“Right. Hey, I know we haven’t spoken since your sentencing, but why the hell are you showing up everywhere all of a sudden? That will go well.”
“I’m fine,” Draco said in a shaky breath. “Thank you for your concern, Weasley.”
The rest of the evening passed without event. Draco could talk Quidditch and business with Ron. He and Hermione bonded over books, having shared tastes in both nonfiction and fiction. They both left with a list of recommendations to read. And they all cared for the child abuse law. Hermione didn’t even act upset when Harry told her he quit the Aurors. She did gripe at him for calling her Jean Granger, though.
Draco just smirked and reached for his wand. He cast a spell Harry had never heard, but a moment later, Harry felt warm, thick liquid cover his entrance. “This one comes in handy, too,” Draco whispered. He ran a slick hand over Harry’s back and arse cheeks. Then that one amazing finger found its way inside Harry again. Harry didn’t try to contain the cry that escaped his throat. He felt his cock swell, eager for more already.
“Fucking hell,” Neville said as he entered the common room from the hallway, Luna in tow. “Those bastards had said I could have the room tonight. They can go into Hogsmeade, but Luna can’t.”
“Are you sure? You’re not about to off yourself in there, are you? Do I need to get Lupin?”
“I’m in.”
Harry and Draco ate, chatting about anything and nothing. He asked Harry about his day, and he seemed genuniely interested to hear about it. “I suppose it’s a good thing that work has been slow. Means less dark wizards and whatnot, right?”
In the bedroom, Draco noticed Harry walking funny. “Oh! I’ve got something for that. You’ll love it. I got the recipe off a bloke in the States. Brilliant potioneer and one kinky fucker.”
“Yeah. Oh. That feels good.” Although he often got off with his own finger or a toy, it was just so much better when it was someone else. “Move your finger around till you find it.”
Harry seemed to know that something was wrong the second Draco entered the common room. He leapt to his feet and folded Draco into a hug before leading him to their bedroom. They laid down, and Harry spooned his boyfriend.
Draco blinked, trying to maintain his composure. “I’ll make you proud.”
Harry obliged. He moved his hips hard and deep, ramming himself inside of Draco’s warm, tight arse. He groaned at the tightness around his cock. He dug his hands into Draco’s hips and looked down the length of his stomach to watch his cock enter and exit his boyfriend. Moan after moan escaped their mouths, until Harry wasn’t sure who made what noise. “Harder, Harry.”
“No school uniforms. No homework.”
The Leaky Cauldron was packed, as it always was on the weekends. People waved at Harry and looked at the small girl in curiosity, but to his relief, they were left alone. He had taken a Calming Draught before he left home that morning, just to be sure he could handle the outing. He introduced Daisy to Tom the barman then took her out to the small patio behind the pub.
“Drinks are on us at the Leaky in an hour!” Harry yelled to the crowd. Then he leaned into murmur in Draco’s ear. “Come on, you. We’ve got an hour to celebrate alone.”
“Mother, I couldn’t be happier for you.”
Malfoy studied his schedule for the year. The nausea returned. First up, at nine a.m. every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday was the group therapy McGonagall had mentioned. And today was Wednesday. Bloody hell. He knew he couldn’t skive it off. Attending all classes, unless Madam Pomfrey signed off on an absence, was part of his plea deal. But he had no intention of talking about his feelings, especially as the only Death Eater at school.
“What the fuck am I doing here? You Apparated me to your house?” Harry grabbed his wand and pointed it at Malfoy, who drew his in response.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief. They chatted about the fluxweed. Justin passed a blunt around the room, and Draco took a long drag.
“Hope you like biryani!” Draco didn’t enjoy being interrupted when he was deep in thought like this, but food was always welcome. He looked up at Harry, confused for a moment, then smiled.
He picked up an excited Daisy from Surrey. She was more excited about going to the Quidditch game than she was about her birthday party the next day. And she was thrilled to finally Apparate, although her parents were less sure. “You’re sure it’s safe?” Meredith asked for the hundredth time.
“Okay.” Harry gave him a small smile.
“They hated each other!”
“No! Jesus, Potter. Your insatiable sex drive ruins everything.”
“Both?”
“Hey. You look great.”
A wide grin lit up Harry’s face. Draco’s heart swelled. Though it had only been a few months, Draco could hardly remember why he ever hated Harry. This wizard truly was incredible, and it had nothing to do with being the Chosen One. He was a survivor, just like Draco. And yet, he still had so much love to give.
Draco sat on Harry’s sofa, pushing away the blanket from his earlier nap. Harry sat across from him on a wing-backed chair. He listened as Draco apologized for everything he could think of, all the way back to that first day at Hogwarts. A few stray tears rolled down his cheeks, and Harry wanted nothing more than to wipe them away.
“I've seen Kingsley Shacklebolt drunkenly karaoke Celestina Warbeck, and Dawlish has a pet cat that he baby-talks to. Forgive me if I'm not intimidated.”
He kissed his friend on the head and took his seat across from Ron. “What’s new?”
“Wednesday? What time?”
Daisy looked up at Draco, shocked. “No! How come? Is he on the telly?”
Harry saw Malfoy five more times over the next several weeks, always at the Ministry leaving meetings with various important people. He wrote to Neville to find out if he had learned anything about Malfoy’s meeting with McGonagall. All Neville said was that he saw Malfoy leaving the Headmistress’ office a couple times.
“You’ve always been infatuated with the boy.” She studied him. “He makes you happy?”
“Fuck. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck shit Merlin fuck.” Draco was moving his hips, eager for more. “Oh, fuck, Harry. You’re so good at that.”
“Thank you for sharing, Neville,” Artemis said softly. There was a long pause, and Artemis looked around the room expectantly. No one spoke.
“You can?”
The second time he saw Malfoy was that Wednesday when he met Neville for a pint in Hogsmeade. As Neville rambled on about some new species of mimbulus that he had gotten for his NEWT students, Harry’s eyes were drawn to the far corner of the Three Broomsticks. There sat Headmistress McGonagall deep in conversation with a platinum blond man that Harry would know anywhere. Harry blinked a few times, sure he was mistaken. But that same chiseled jaw and piercing eyes from the coffeeshop, from his past, sat smiling with their former professor.
Harry watched as Draco’s entire face lit up. “Good news?”
Malfoy’s impassioned smile faded. “Because my life would have been a lot different if someone had stopped my father from abusing me.”
“Then it’s a date.” Harry grinned.
Ron had attempted to lighten the mood with bad jokes but stopped when the elevator let them out on Level 9. The level that contained the Department of Mysteries held many bad memories for him, as well. This was where his father was attacked and where Ron had been in his first battle against Death Eaters. Hermione leaned closer into Ron as the four friends made their way to the staircase to Level 10.
“Okay, fine. You know me too well and blah blah blah. Right. Well, I want to invite him to the Halloween Ball.”
“Yes. Fuck. Draco Malfoy, let’s save wizarding children together.”
Someone was puking in the toilet cubicle. Harry splashed cold water on his face and tried to ignore the retching. He was shaky and weak and wanted nothing more than to climb into his bed and sleep for the next week.  The cubicle door opened. In the mirror, Harry saw Draco exit the stall. His hair was disheveled, and his tie was untied. He wiped his mouth and walked up to the sink next to Harry.
“She, ah, never hit that spot. Fuck, that’s amazing. Draco, can you put another finger in? I want to feel more…full, I think.”
“Perhaps. But not to the people who matter.”
Harry shrugged. The thought had already occurred to him. “Maybe.”
Their Indian food soon forgotten, Draco launched himself into Harry’s lap. It wasn’t long before they made their way to the bedroom, an intense repeat of last night’s events. It was Harry who made love to Draco this time, eyes gazing into Draco's as he entered him. If Draco had felt made to fuck Harry, well, Harry might be even more made to fuck Draco. It was everything Harry had always craved from a shag but never gotten.
“I need to taste you, to suck you. Please, let me suck you off.”
It was more than a moment when Harry stepped through the Floo. He was laden with several containers of food. “Sorry,” he said. “Molly insisted on loading us up with enough food for a week.”
The Daily Prophet published Hermione’s article within the week after she hosted Harry and Draco for dinner that first time. Now, Draco came to every Saturday night dinner, ever Wednesday family dinner with the Dursleys, and he even came to Sunday lunches at the Burrow. He also dragged Harry to Thursday dinners with his mother and whoever she was dating that week.
The room was sparkling and the bedding looked new. The floors were polished and a vase of fresh flowers sat on the dresser.
Harry shook his head. “It’s not ideal, but we’re not going to hex you in your sleep. Come on.”
“Celestina, huh? Really? I want to hear about this later.” Draco glanced at the clock. “We’ve got an hour and a half. Do you own a suit?”
Harry fumbled around and grabbed the first wand he could find. It was Harry’s. Oh, well. Simple spells should be fine. “This one will feel cold,” Draco said. He did it verbally since it wasn’t his wand. “
“I’m fine, Potter. I’m not sick.”
A ten-pound note of Muggle money fell out of the envelope. “I’m British and can’t handle my gin. How embarrassing. Buy yourself coffee on me this morning.”
“Good.”
“Wow, okay, sexist. It’s complicated because your relationship with Draco is complicated. I mean, two years ago, you nearly killed each other. But bloody hell, Harry. You fought Voldemort, multiple times. You led a battle. You
“Stay the night with me?”
Draco put the book down over his chest and turned his head to look at Harry. “Really?”
“I can visit Mother! On the 23rd! Steve will pick me up from Hogwarts and take me to Azkaban.”
Harry was standing by that point. He hadn’t realized he was clutching his wand, and he tried to consciously loosen his grip. He stormed off.
He felt inexplicably angry. Not at Draco, but at the life that seemed to have been chosen for him. He was fifteen when he first considered being an Auror. He hadn’t even been sure he would live long enough to become one. And he had more experience fighting evil than anyone else his age. But he was a child. And he was a child when Kingsley had told him and Ron that their war experience counted in lieu of their NEWTS. His path was chosen.
“Yum. Any chocolate?” Artemis asked.
Draco pulled at Harry’s shirt, and soon, their clothes were discarded. They pulled and stroked each other’s cocks urgently as they kissed on the couch.
Inside, Harry’s nervous energy manifested in being an overly attentive host. “Do you want something to drink? I’ve got wine. Beer. Water. Milk. Tea?”
“Your turn. Flip over. On your knees.”
“I brought a bottle of wine.”
Harry collapsed onto the floor and hit his head on something. And something large fell on top of him. “Ow,” he moaned as he tried to get his bearings. He adjusted his glasses and saw that he was laying on a black rug and had hit his head on the corner of a glass coffee table. “Fuck.”
Harry couldn’t help feeling suspicious; old habits die hard, after all. Not to mention that seeing both Malfoy and Dudley had made all his nightmares and anxiety return. But despite his wariness, Harry could not figure out what sinister thing Draco would be up to. Any possible explanation he came up with were all innocent. Harry had also become extremely horny and visited the bars a couple nights a week, although he was quite sure this had nothing to do with Draco. He had a few dates that went well enough to become second and third dates. But none of them were relationship material.
Harry nodded, his shining green eyes boring into Draco with love and excitement. Draco crawled to the head of the bed and sat up.
“And?”
“I don’t particularly want to be here when McGonagall arrives,” he whispered against Harry’s lips.
“First of all, that’s incredibly sexist.” Hermione jabbed her fork in Harry’s direction. “And second, you’re not fine. You have all the clinical symptoms of depression.”
“I need new friends. Anyway, things were getting pretty, um, heated. And then he just pulled away and left. No explanation.”
“Fuck. Fuckfuckfuck.” Harry banged his head against the shower wall. He let the water scald his skin. “Fuck.”
Harry didn’t hold back. He was loud. Blaise could probably hear them, and that filled Draco with a wicked sense of delight. He set to work moving up and down on Harry’s shaft. He used one hand to stroke the base while he sucked and licked. The other cupped Harry’s full, velvety bollocks.
Christmas at the Weasleys was every bit as crazy as Draco expected. It wasn’t just the Weasley clan, of course. George had invited Angelina Johnson, and they seemed cozy. Charlie Weasley had a boyfriend. Hermione was there, with her Muggle parents who seemed extremely uncomfortable. Arthur Weasley couldn’t stop talking to them.
“Right. And in regards to the anal area, what are you comfortable with?” Draco did not know how to make this sound more sexy.
Shaky, Draco craned his neck to study the woman behind him. The resemblance was uncanny, but Andromeda had brown hair instead of Bellatrix’s pitch black. And tears were streaming down her face. That meant it definitely wasn’t Bellatrix.
“Merlin, Draco. How many suits do you own?”
“I ordered from Curry Cauldron last night.”
Harry laughed. “I do! I’m quite good at it. But after a long week, I just don’t want to.”
She looked…small. Her pale skin used to be a thing of beauty, but now she just looked sickly. Her platinum hair had lost its sheen. She wore a drab grey robe that looked filthy.
Harry followed Draco down the London street to a pub. A Muggle pub. Draco held the door for him, then they sat down at a small table in the low-light bar. A waitress took their orders, and Draco threw in an order of chips to share. Then he surprised Harry even further when he took out a Muggle bank card and opened a tab.
They embraced for the last few minutes, each sobbing into each other’s shoulders. But they had endured worse. They had survived worse. And they would survive this.
Harry shrugged. “Or they’ve gotten better at hiding their tracks. That’s usually the case. It’s always the same.”
“I’m fine. Just...thinking.”
“Thank you, Hermione.”
Harry nodded in agreement, but he tuned out as Malfoy continued. At first, he had simply been impressed by Malfoy’s dedication to this project and how much research he had done. And it was a cause Harry could get behind easily. It was personal, after all. But over the last week, he had discovered he genuinely liked Malfoy. Sure, he could be a right arse at times, but his snide comments were never truly malevolent. He was funny and smart, and he had the added benefit of being nice to look at. Shit, Harry realized. I have a crush on Draco Malfoy.
Harry pulled Draco toward him and poured his gratitude into a kiss right there on the street. When Draco stepped away, he looked well and truly dazed. “Right then. Shall we?” He held out his arm to Harry and together they entered the restaurant, their first-time dining as a couple. The maitre-d' greeted Draco as Mr. Malfoy, and Draco introduced Harry as his boyfriend. Harry couldn’t stifle the grin that spread over his face. He had acquired many titles in his twenty-eight years—The Boy Who Lived, The Chosen One, The Savior of the Wizarding World, Auror, One-third of the Golden Trio. But he thought that Draco Malfoy’s boyfriend might be his favorite title yet. Merlin, he had it bad.
“I’m proud of you, Harry.” Draco’s voice was little more than a murmur. His eyes were heavy with sleep.
“I—” Draco closed his mouth and thought. “Do you?”
Harry swallowed down the bitter Dreamless Sleep and rinsed out his mouth with some Muggle mouthwash by the sink. He took a quick piss and returned to Draco’s room. Draco was already under the covers, reading a book while he waited for Harry.
“I just mean…The Dark Lord didn’t only want to kill you. He wanted to literally take over the world. You were just an obstacle for him to overcome. If there had never been a prophecy, never been a Harry Potter, he still would have tried to take over.”
“You do? How?”
Harry leaned in to kiss Draco’s worries aside. “Yes, I really am certain.”
He moved his lips to Harry’s neck, kissing his prominent Adam’s apple as Harry swallowed hard. He didn’t push, didn’t say anything. Harry would tell him if he was ready. But Draco really hoped he was. He wanted to fuck Harry, too, but he would let Harry bring that up first.
Draco blinked his eyes rapidly, trying not to break down. He cleared his throat but was unable to say anything. Harry squeezed his thigh. His mother was incredible, making sure he received a gift even though she was locked away.
Malfoy had all but disappeared after his trial. He got off with time served thanks to Harry’s testimony. One week later, Harry had received a short, handwritten note from Malfoy, thanking him for his appearance in court. Then he had disappeared from public life.
“I’m nervous.”
“Do you still enjoy it?”
“Yes. You know, after the trial, they took nearly the entire Malfoy estate. He had a small inheritance fund that wasn’t in Lucius’ name, but rumor has it, he donated half of it to the War Orphan Fund. Then he disappeared.”
Harry laughed. “I suppose we should be grateful. Go home, Dennis. We’re the last ones here.”
He was relieved when the kids bounded down the stairs demanding cake and ice cream. But he couldn’t quite muster his earlier cheerfulness. He grinned as Daisy opened her presents—a Holyhead Harpies scarf and an illustrated copy of The Tales of Beetle the Bard. But he couldn’t wait to leave and sit at home, waiting for Draco to talk to him.
“I don’t know…Is he even gay?”
“Your reputation is intact, then,” Harry spat. He rubbed his eye absentmindedly, and pain shot through his head. “Ow.”
“Yeah.”
Draco nodded. Harry gathered his clothes and made his way to their dorm. Draco stayed seated for awhile. Harry Potter had just come out to him. To him! Draco was the only person who knew this. The whole situation seemed wrong.
“Thank you, Draco.”
Harry laughed. “Have you looked in a mirror, Draco?”
The day before graduation, Draco received a letter from his mother. She was free from Azkaban, but she had to live under house arrest for two years. She would be living with Andromeda. Draco decided to go see her as soon as he was free. He would bring Harry so they could really, truly meet.
Draco smiled a little. He was nervous. “So do you.”
“And you beat this Voldemort guy?”
“I’m sorry. Did you say something?” He tried to be polite, tried not to give away the fear in his voice. He grasped his wand in his pocket, afraid to use it in case it looked as if he were violating the terms of his release.
Draco bounced faster, harder. He scratched Harry’s chest in ecstasy. Harry never moved his eye’s from Draco’s face. He was enamored by the look of euphoria lighting up Draco’s features. And he wanted to make it even better.
Draco shuddered. “No. The last thing I want to see is Luna naked. Too…female. And a relative, technically. Although Neville has gotten quite fit.”
“Good night, Draco.” Harry lay staring at the ceiling for a bit. He should have taken a bit more of the Dreamless Sleep, but he didn’t want to fall asleep so quickly that Draco knew he had taken a potion. He thought about quitting the Aurors, about the charity, about Draco. He was falling in love, was probably already there if he would just admit it to himself.
Remus smiled, a far-off look in his eye. He was a nice man and a great teacher, but Draco still thought he was a little strange. But Remus pulled himself out of his thoughts and looked at Draco. “Good. I’m glad to hear that she’s well. Now, let’s talk about your career. Are you interested in pursuing a potions mastery?”
Harry looked at Draco, who grinned. He could finally join his friends for drinks. “Yeah, but let us pop home and drop our stuff off first,” Harry said. He winked.
“So am I.”
Draco took his hand and got to his feet. Then he threw his arms around Harry and crashed his lips against the other boy’s. Harry froze for a half-second in shock before parting his lips and deepening their kiss. He parted his lips, inviting Draco in.
Harry shook his head and made a face at her. “Hermione, not helping.”
“How did you know I was back?”
“Draco, what aren’t you saying?”
“My aunt plays Quidditch, you know. It’s her job.” Rose beamed proudly.
He made his way back to the bedroom. “Harry, it must be in one of your gift bags because it’s—Well, hello.”
“So, what happened with Draco?” Hermione asked.
The Wizengamot was meeting in Courtroom Ten. Several members already sat in their plum robes, but Harry and the others were a half-hour early. They wanted good seats for the result. They made their way into the front row of visitor seating and sat in relative silence, occasionally whispering to each other some random observation. The visitor seats began to fill up around them, and more members of the council took their places. Not everyone was here for the Child Services law. Three other laws would be voted on today. But many people were there in support of Harry and Draco. Blaise Zabini took a seat on Draco’s other side. Neville, McGonagall, and Luna sat behind them, as well as a few other professors. Pansy Parkinson waved at Draco as she entered and took a seat a few rows back. Molly and Arthur entered with Andromeda, and much to Harry’s surprise, Narcissa.
Harry pulled Draco into their room and pushed him onto Harry’s bed. He climbed on top of his lover, taking charge this time. He ran his tongue over Draco’s sharp jawline, savoring the roughness of his stubble, so different from a woman. Draco ran his hands under Harry’s shirt, and Harry sat up to pull it over his head.
Ginny met them outside of the locker room. She threw her arms around Harry. They had ended amicably years ago, both realizing that young love didn’t mean forever. Now, Harry mostly viewed her like a sister. Daisy was smitten by the Quidditch star, and she suddenly turned shy. But Ginny was sweet and bent down to talk to her. She gave her a photo of the whole team that every player had signed.
“What do you think he’s up to?” Harry asked.
Hermione had finally coaxed it out of him one Saturday night. She pursed her lips, but Ron laughed. “It makes perfect sense, Hermione. Harry’s clearly had the hots for him for years.”
“What? This is what I always buy?”
“What? No! I didn’t know you worked here.”
Draco shrank back into his armchair. Always with the yelling. He couldn’t take the yelling. Yelling. That was Lucius’ favorite pastime. Then when Bellatrix was in the Manor it was a war of yelling, and then the Dark Lord would yell at them to stop and...
“When did that happen?” Harry whispered to Draco. Narcissa smiled at the two men and made her way into the stands with her sister.
He woke around eight o’clock, confused from a deep sleep. As he tried to regain his senses, Draco Malfoy’s voice filled his living room. Harry looked toward the Floo.
"A lout! You're such a lout you don't even know what one is!"
Ron yanks off the gloves and whisks his wand over them, shrinking them down to something more like Hermione's size. "Here you are, then, a custom fit."
"There's no such thing." She wanders over to the scones, predictably breaking off the tiniest corner she can manage. Draco polished off his scone ages ago. "Take your cape back off and help me figure out how to deal with that horrible Minchin woman's alterations. I refuse to start all over again, but she might as well have asked for an entirely different dress."
around.
"Ready to leave?" Harry asks, headed for the queue to Floo out. Hogwarts has allocated only one entrance and exit, always keen on security measures.
Draco's response is short.
"Oh, mate, this is too weird," Ron says when he's recovered, wiping tears from one eye. "But you can't pretend you weren't mad for him in sixth year."
"Don't butter me up with false titles. Talk to me about work."
"And it's Neville Longbottom."
"Calling me a host implies you're my guest," Potter says as Draco follows him in, which is just bitchy enough that Draco pauses the removal of his cape mid-twirl. He can't quite tell yet if he's offended or impressed, but he thinks he might actually be leaning toward the latter.
This is it. This is the end. Draco's life is flashing before his eyes, and now he has to take back every mean thing he said about every hack writer who's ever used the turn of phrase. Except no, it's not his life he's seeing, it's every imagined outcome of the next few moments.
She looks around furtively, suspecting as Draco does that it's not quite above board, and says, "It's too soon to tell. They haven't been in as long as she has—they're all still trying to cast the curse on whoever catches their eye."
"You just what? Pour it down your front?" Malfoy cackles. "Dignified, Potter!"
"I may entertain you with a few choice details, yes," Draco smirks over the rim of his wine glass as he takes it up again, though internally he's beaming. "Don't tell me you're dating, too, Pans."
After another hour and a half of conversation, during which Harry lights the fire pit and Arthur breaks out several packages of Jaffa Cakes, Draco spots Lily hanging about the back door looking both anxious and bored. He tugs on Harry's shirt, and nods in her direction. Harry takes a glance at their daughter, and nods at Draco in turn.
"Why would I go upstairs? Where are you going?" Draco demands, gesturing at the clothing littered all over the room that Potter's not taking with him as he exits the room. "Potter!"
"Breathe," and there's a too long pause between this word and the next, "in time with these circles." For both of them, again.
Eventually, Harry has to leave his side; the Griselda Yaxley case needs processing. Her wandless, wordless magic is so powerful that she's kept under heavy sedation, tended to hourly by guarded orderlies whose first priority is that she stay unconscious. Nobody is sure what else to do with her; a Dementor-less Azkaban is no more likely to hold her than anywhere else, and Draco doubts even Dementors would phase her. Meanwhile, Venari Virtute itself goes unbroken, barely kept from spreading by the Ministry while its current victims' magic goes on feeding Griselda's.
"I suppose it means something philosophical coming from that lot."
"You hate house calls," she says, as she whirls her cape right off in turn. Short capes are very in right now, thanks to Atelier Malfoy. "What are you really doing?"
"He's—he's hiding something," Potter rambles, eyes darting about the room, no less wide. "Dendron, he's—"
, Potter gestures to the long table that still dominates the equally long galley kitchen. "Go on and sit then," he says, before turning back to his task of putting away food, and leaving Draco frozen in bafflement.
Dinner goes as smoothly as any event with so many big personalities can go. Pansy holding a conversation with Molly at the opposite end of the table makes Draco absolutely tense, as does Blaise talking to Neville at the other table, but Harry squeezes Draco's thigh under the table and points out that nobody is shouting, or making faces. In fact, Blaise and Neville are talking about plants, while Molly and Pansy are having a barely veiled conversation about Pansy's attempts to conceive with her wife. The kids don't seem to be listening, at least, for which Draco is grateful. Rose seems to think the way she checks her mobile under the table top is surreptitious, and Hugo is monologuing to Lily about the Weasley family tree, not bothering to clear his mouth of food before he talks.
"And what's
"And what am I meant to do while you're in there, clean your whole sodding house again?" Draco calls after him, with no response. "Tch." He rolls to his feet, stretching his back, and sets off downstairs to do just that, trying to ignore how giddy he feels.
But he's going to scream. Or he's going to cry. Either way, he won't have control.
"No one."
The problem, of course, is that Draco remains wandless. It is up to Harry to interpret Draco's theory and hand-flapping into actual casting and wand movement, and there's a disconnect between the two that makes Draco waspish, which in turn makes him embarrassed and apologetic.
"Well, ran out of time because of, you know, the war," Harry says, frowning at the faded design on his shirt, "and then there didn't seem to be a point. I could do it, and nobody was checking, so why bother?"
"And how was the moon?" Hermione asks, looking slyly at Draco.
Then again, one of the reasons for his solo holiday has always been to discover who he is without his best friends, or anyone else.
"You're welcome, you blathering prick," Harry sighs. "Think you can get off the mountain without breaking your delicate neck so I can carry on?"
. This house will be leveled because all he sees when he looks at this tiny corpse is himself.
"When," Draco clears his throat again, "was the last time you spoke to Harry?"
For a moment, they just stand there, pressed chest to chest and listening to the ambient sounds of the neighborhood.
"Oh!" Hermione gets it first. "Oh, Ron, don't be thick! They're
"Oh," Harry's voice says, suddenly loud, "and Draco's here."
and leave it suspended over Draco's desk. He doesn't know why Larch seems so excited to see him, but he does wish Larch had conjured him a little lampshade, too, because every time he so much as glances up, the low-hanging ball of light leaves its burning impression on his retinas.
And he leaves, the door clicking softly behind him.
Not far from the loom, Draco has pushed the majority of his living room furniture against the wall to make space for a work table much like the ones in the atelier. First, there was a mess of black silk swatches pinned to the cork. Tulle, voile, chiffon, organza, batiste, even a fairly large-scale mesh he included just to have an even number. The organza wins out, which was not Draco's prediction, and next to populate the table is a bolt of black silk organza. He also orders a cut of ultra-fine tulle after all, but not enough to merit sending the roll. Waiting at his sewing machine are spools of golden embroidery floss, and these aren't his work—these have real gold in them, giving the thread some weight.
Yet Harry saw the breadth of their love in those photos. He saw his own happiness, as well as Draco's. He heard their stories in Draco's trembling voice. And he made his decision.
this is my shortest epilogue yet! but that's fine.
They Floo back to the cottage in the order of Draco, then Lily, then Harry, because it simply makes sense to have a parent on either side to make sure Lily isn't kidnapped, so says Harry. Draco has no earthly idea what danger Harry thinks is lurking in their home or following them back from a Burrow dinner party, but it's not worth the argument. There are more than a few ways where Harry's hypervigilance endures, and will likely never end.

her father's wand. "I bet you feel so smart. Like you did something competent, for once."
Draco walks past Harry with tense, drawn-up shoulders, but Harry doesn't attack him, just watches him with wary eyes as Draco heads out to the cliff's edge. He's just in time to see the rabbit dash across the waves in long, supernatural hops, before it disappears into the mist. If they're as close to England as he thinks they are, it won't be long before backup arrives.
he failed. He supposes Pansy will let him know shortly, though.
"Don't you wish!" Malfoy bellows, running into Harry because he's taken a moment to turn his shouting mouth in the barkeep's direction. "Move it, Potter!"
committed the sin of Orientalism, not me," she says, prim as she holds the parchment back out to him. "Did you forget Potter's part Bengali? You can't put him in this. It's just weird."

"Get it together," she snaps. "Whatever little romantic fantasy you've got in your head, wrap it up. We've got a business to run, if you've forgotten."
"All done," Draco is happy to announce as he gets that final measurement, punctuated by the measuring tape snapping back into its case.
"You should be at the Burrow, too!" Hermione replies, but Draco shakes his head.
For all that Pansy's said, Draco is still a professional. He
"What, sleep for a day?" Draco realizes now that the itch he's been feeling is a lock of hair poking him between the eyes, and he starts trying to blow it away from his forehead, mostly in vain. It pokes him in the eye, instead. "I didn't do it on purpose. Take it up with the Sleeping Draught they gave me." He assumes that's what it was, anyway.
"Just for that, yes. Stand there all afternoon, too, for all I care." Harry splashes cold water on his heated face at the kitchen sink, hoping he's buying himself enough time. Maybe Malfoy won't know a blush on dark skin when he sees one. "Come back when you're Godric Gryffindor."
these days is because of his ongoing refusal to be seen in public; the most recent photo of him in known existence dates to his thirty-third birthday party, the scene of his disappearance from the public eye.
"What are you doing?"
"Your—?" Draco feels the hot red flush hit him as though he's been splashed with paint.
The grin that unfurls across her face is one that Draco knows spells chaos. "One more time, Malfoy, I'm hard of hearing in my old age."
They lapse into a much easier silence as Draco finishes his work. Draco sets the last pin into the hem, finding the robe's perfect front length, and straightens with a groan.
"Absolutely." Draco stands as well. He won't be caught giving Potter any reason to deny him.
Ron sighs. "I dunno, mate. We were both pretty checked out by the end, I didn't stop to ask if he'd remembered how to be in love with his old school rival yet."
Draco cannot reconcile any of those words with the Dark Lord.
"Well, obviously, or I would have left by now."
Harry bids him farewell by pinning Draco to the wall, kissing him so passionately Draco considers staying the night and doing something about their mutual erections after all.
Draco groans, sliding down in his seat until his back is flush with the bottom cushion, his knees at awkward angles in front of him. "I should have known better than to ask you."
Draco stares at the album, his breath caught. "You've got it right there. What do you need me for?"
"Draco." Harry purses his lips. "Am I an eloquent man?"
After ten at night, the kitchen is only serving one thing: Stew. When Harry asks what's in it, the barkeep gives him a hard eye and repeats that he can have stew or nothing. "Stew it is," Harry sighs, and the barkeep whisks off to spoon him up a bowl. "And a pint!" he calls after her, but he's not sure she heard him. "Not the lager!"
"Yes." He knows what she means. "Yes, I am."
"I know, I'm a fool." Harry presses his lips to Draco's high forehead, then to Draco's own mouth. They spend a few more minutes at the door simply caressing each other with lips and hands, chaste but full of meaning, before Draco shivers in the chill of the October morning air.
"What are you showing me?" Harry growls. "Someone married you? Can't say I don't pity—"
Out of the four, Pertinger only tries to curse the Healer, though she doesn't try nearly as hard as she did to curse Potter.
Draco thinks it's understandable, really. And he'll still take being on a first-name basis.
"Malfoy!" Harry fumes, before he realizes he's still holding his briefs, and drops them into the pile of his clothing, kicking his shirt over them.
When it's clear Draco is getting nothing else out of Potter, Draco clicks his tongue. "Fine. Here's what you'll wear," he says, quill scratching across the parchment in a hurry. "A Muggle-styled suit. Three pieces. Grey wool herringbone. " The design taking shape beneath his hand looks as lumpen as it is generic, but it's clear Potter only tapped him to be able to say he was wearing Malfoy.
Draco's head is buzzing. "During office hours?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I didn't need the master bath, I just needed a bloody toilet and a sink in the same room!" Draco presses a hand to his chest, his heart hammering from the shock of sudden Apparition.
"Gin! Now, hold on, when's the last time—"
"Potter, don't you dare—!" Draco can't even find it in himself to be embarrassed by how his voice cracks. But it's too late, and the distantly familiar yank of being Side Alonged consumes him.
"This is so much work," Potter whispers.
He receives notice, with official Ministry stationary, that he has been given bereavement leave of five days. The signature is from some communications flunky, not Potter.
"Why did you do that?"
"What is this? You're not going to intimidate me into a nap, that's not how that works." Draco reaches for his wand, and realizes it's back over by his satchel, because he's a fool. "Back, fiend! Do as I say!"
to make me feel awful about myself, who watched me be tortured by a madwoman—"
"I'm nosy, and I wouldn't have noticed," Draco says. "Stop looking at it and put this on, you're going to make
, and takes an ungainly sip to punctuate his words. "I don't design shallowly pretty things. Everything I do is intentional."
Draco wants to draw himself up and tell Blaise he's doing the same, but he doesn't know what to call Harry besides
"But then why didn't you show me this?" Potter's voice asks from above Draco's head. "Why did you finish—Malfoy!" A hand shaking Draco's shoulder forces his eyes to refocus.
"Clothing," Draco answers with a curl of his lip. "You may have heard of the concept while locked away in your tower. I believe the peons outside call this a suit."
The orderly bites her lip, frowning. "Can I tell you that?"
Hermione reads the list of the dead, a macabre and somber tradition held over from the first anniversary celebration of the end of the war, as Harry tells him. (It was not a Gala, not then.) Hermione gives a rousing speech about peace, and rooting out evil before it can sprout. She talks about the hope the next generation gives her, watching her children and their friends. "Bigotry is the seed," she says, "and our children will not water it."
"Brilliant," Draco says, laying his satchel into place as he chooses the same Chesterfield armchair as his first visit. "Once I show you this new sketch, you'll understand why I had to abandon ship." The satchel pops up into table form, and Draco makes a show of opening its drawer and removing the parchment inside. "Here."
"He said—" Harry begins, anger still suffusing his features, but Draco holds a finger to Harry's lips, silencing him. He pulls Harry around to the side of the house. Harry's hair charm has broken, falling soft and messy around his face.
"Ah, it does until my team and I get every last drop of magic back out of Griselda Yaxley," Draco says. "You promised.
"Oh." But she doesn't re-lock the door she's opened. An hour later, she's returned to Europe.
"Oh, kiss my arse! Saint Potter needs his sanctum, does he?" Malfoy sneers.
"You don't drink a lot when you're not on holiday, do you?" Malfoy says with a smirk. "My god, Potter, I don't even know how to begin with this—this
happy about it, now," Draco huffs. "Someone might get the wrong idea."
"Yeah, but not like her," Greg replies with a shrug.
“I had it under control.” Draco muttered, though no one heard him over Hermione’s shouting.
“You need to speak to someone about your magic Potter.  This is becoming dangerous.” Draco spoke gently as he pulled himself out of bed and left Harry’s room.  Harry could only watch Draco leave, his brows furrowed.
“Come on ‘Mione, it’s bloody hilarious! Draco went bonkers for nearly two weeks about how Harry couldn’t control his magic and now he’s gone and done it himself!” Ron’s laughter spilled across the room and even Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
“Your Dark Lord is dead.” Harry spat. “And the House of Black is mine.  Your time here is over Walburga.” Harry waved his hand and spoke once more. “
“What the fuck!” Screamed the bloodied Gryffindor from where he hung in mid-air.
“Bloody hell!” Ron laughed.
“Under control my arse.” Draco muttered into Harry’s neck, peppering kisses and nipping bites at Harry’s pulse point.
While the others would demand answers, and yell and scream and cry, Molly simply pushed past the shouts and embraced Harry.  She saw what the others had not, she saw the light in his eyes.
And as if Draco had summoned her by merely speaking her name, the Headmistress was round the corner into the corridor, her face set in anger and her robes billowing menacingly behind her.
After that summer had passed in a flurry of friends and family.  Grimmauld Place had become the house between all, not a week went by that it hadn’t seen visitors.  Luna, Goyle, and Pansy visited every Thursday.  Neville, Hannah, Dean, and Seamus would have dinner with them every Tuesday.  And Saturday’s saw dinners with Ron, Hermione while Sundays were dinners with Narcissa, Andromeda, and little Teddy.  The two sisters mending their relationship while little Teddy ran circles around Harry and Draco, his hair flashing from black to platinum.
“Malfoy!” Harry grunted, trying to nudge the blonde off of him so he could sit up, only when Malfoy moved just a bit, Harry caught a glimpse of the source of the heat.
The first two weeks upon their return to Hogwarts, much to Headmistress McGonagall’s approval, saw a unification amongst the former separated houses.  Pansy Parkinson had even approached Harry in the common room on a Wednesday night within the first week, to apologize to Harry in front of the rest of the returnees. Harry simply stood from his seat on the sofa and pulled her in for a hug, cutting off her jumbled attempt at the apology.
“Bloody Slytherins.” Ron laughed, all the while placating a frayed Hermione.
“Yeah.” Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. “I locked myself away and let all the pent up…. err magic…..out. Nearly destroyed the house.” Harry shrugged.
"It's not as simple as saying all is forgiven," Hermione says, just soft enough for Draco's ears and not for the men bustling in the kitchen. "I was genuinely traumatized, navigating so much bigotry—as a girl, as a Black girl, and then learning at eleven there was yet one more thing people could want to hate me for. To hurt me for."
"You said it, not me," Draco demurrs.
. "Draco, no."
Potter's lips press together in a wide, flat slit. "I don't know."
"Can you really not make the jump? You were a Seeker in school, for Merlin's sake."
"No, it's been four years since his disappearance," Draco corrects.
what you're wearing today. Now please, Potter." Draco removes his cape in a single flourish, its emerald lining flashing in the light. "Direct me to where I might hang my godforsaken outerwear, such as civilized people do, and then direct me to the place where I am to measure your equally godforsaken body while you go change into something less bulky."
"No, because my first design was a sham, and I'm professional enough to admit that," Draco says with a princely sniff. "We could give him to Wilda, you know. Or to Colm."
Draco sighs, and walks over to where Harry's standing, six feet away. "If you're not ready, Harry, then you're not ready. We can go. There's a little cafe round the corner I like, and I want to see if noted hermit Head Auror Potter has ever been."
"Maybe both." Draco gives his hips as much of a roll as they can, trapped beneath Harry. "You'll have more time for this once you're unemployed."
A promise made by a child playing with sharp objects. The only person in all the world unimpressed by the speed and volume at which Voldemort, the most powerful and ruthless Dark Wizard of his time, had killed people.
still too crazy to leave my sodding house—"
The strange look Potter is giving him is not his intended response. "What?" Draco asks, waspishly.
"It's not." Granger kisses the forehead of another, taller child with a bushy mane of ginger curls, dismissing the girl from the kitchen with a few quiet words. "We just came for a visit, but Molly and Arthur are out right now."
"Perhaps," Draco admits. "Maybe I designed it that way. More of a tits-out look, I think they say." He barely knows what he's saying anymore, delirious with Harry's touch. Harry lowers his head, presses his lips to the exposed center of Draco's chest, and Draco puts a hand to Harry's bearded cheek. "Kiss
"But I don't know you?"
Blaise whispers something to Pansy, low enough that Draco doesn't make it out in his focused state. "We'll be here," Blaise says, and the pair of them withdraw. Draco shakes his head as if to reset himself, and steals down the long corridor and around the corner.
, staring at the velvet-lined box in Harry's hands. "You kept it? All these years?"
"Well," Harry says as he steps through, flicking soot off his shoulder, "why don't we all relax and flip on the telly—"
Ginny throws her head back and guffaws, and Draco sees now why she and Pansy seem so well-matched. "Nice save, Malfoy. Maybe you can teach Harry something about how to rescue a conversation, eh?"
"Lord Fauntleroy was an innocent and pure child presiding over his tenants with kindness and a just hand, and I bet you didn't know that." Malfoy's long pale limbs splashing about as he swims a tight circle make him look like a drowning spider, in Harry's opinion. "You didn't, did you?"
For a moment, Harry is prepared to tell Malfoy that anything he has to bear is still better than he deserves. Beyond the war, Malfoy has just never been a good person—cruel, petty, cowardly, delighting in the suffering of others.
When Draco throws his pinch of Floo powder into the flames,
"Yes, actually." Draco reaches toward his face before reminding himself his glasses are at home, where they belong, though he supposes they'll have to live behind these thin partitions now, before he strains his eyes into oblivion. "I need the personnel file for Auror Pertinger."
"It didn't—" He licks his lips and frowns. "It changed, and I saw Potter in the field again. In the dream, I mean, once I started falling."
Potter takes long, juddering breaths, in time with Draco's circles, and Draco finds he matches them with his own, until the pair of them are breathing in sync.
"I don't remember Ron
"Sycophant? Never. I could insult you at a moment's notice, Potter, I've got a list as long as my arm of all your transgressions against style and good graces."
The trip is a little long, but he's already settling back into his Squib-like life of taking life at a leisurely, almost unwizardly pace. He summons the Knight Bus, taking his already queasy seat close to the front—the better to make his escape once it reaches Devon. He flees the bus as it bangs its way by Ottery St. Catchpole, and takes a moment to catch his breath, hands braced on his knees in a field.
He should go. He should leave. He should thunder down these stairs so Potter knows he might be heard, so he knows Draco isn't listening. More importantly, he should do it so he doesn't stand a chance of actually overhearing anything.
Her Legilimency hits him like an explosion. Griselda rifles through his head carelessly, painfully, flipping from one memory to the next at such a rapid speed that Draco feels like his brain is being pureed. But she finds his kiss with Harry in the field, and Draco wants to rip out her eyes, even knowing that doesn't stop her from having seen it. She finds all his desire for Harry, all the casual little thoughts he always thought he'd keep to himself as a skilled Occlumens trained by Voldemort's favored Death Eater.
—Potter.
Draco groans, pushing his face into both hands. "I want you to know I honestly, truly, sincerely tried very hard to design something that represented you. Something that gave you what you wanted."
"Of course not. He's Uncle Harry. He'd never hurt Rose or Hugo."
Harry had sneered. So quick to assume Draco was his enemy, after all.
Draco had to be discreet in Expanding his flat just enough to fit the loom. It's a ridiculous contraption to have in a home, both in size and function. It runs slowly during his daytime work hours, weaving linen thread into a golden sheen. Draco had wanted a textile that looked like beaten gold, rather than a vague metallic sheen, without sacrificing breathability in warmer weather. Metallic fibers tended to make the wearer sweaty. It's such a specific ask that he was unable to find it from any of his usual vendors—so now he has a loom in his flat. The thread itself was dyed, as it were, in his own painstakingly-developed potion to turn the emerald green thread gold without changing its innate properties, not even its soft texture. From the right angle, the green still peeks through. Draco designed it that way.
"Gross, Pansy." Draco doesn't lift his head. "What do you want?"
If he goes to the Ministry now, Harry probably won't see him. So Draco will have to find a middleman.
"Good, because you look a right mess," Draco says, flicking a bead of sweat off Harry's temple. "You need to shower and get dressed."
to cry right now.
He's only come here to do a job. To make something beautiful for a paying client. Instead he's seized by the urge to cry, to fling himself at Potter's feet and thank him, to run from this house and never come back. He thought he had made his peace with the journey he'd taken to get to his present self and Potter has unraveled him with only five words, just as Pansy had warned him.
"I miss them, too," Harry says. He squeezes Draco's hand. "And you. I've missed you."
you to like. You have to see how it's logical, Potter, I—" The yawn that escapes him is one he's been trying to suppress for several minutes now. "I'm a professional. A client likes options."
He could ask what the hell this is about. Draco feels like he missed some crucial moment between Potter shouting at him for having designed something too personal, and Potter feeding him a meal that clearly took effort and skill.
Then Harry grouses about work; he hates the paperwork, the gladhanding, the oversight. He quietly admits he could use a change from all the literal horrors of the job, too, but it's clear he doesn't want to discuss that further. Instead he complains about Auror Larch always being halfway up his arse, trying to impress him, and Draco does what he thinks is a fabulous impression of Larch's excitable brown-nosing.
"Yeah, I suppose. You just sounded... I dunno. Sorry."
"Harry." Draco hesitates, but only for a moment as Harry watches him. Harry's face is so open, trusting. He
He takes cautious steps deeper into the house. Rather than a kitchen, living room and dining room, there's a single room containing the elements of all three that Draco might call a den. A table by a shabby armchair holds a leatherbound journal; it looks handmade, and like it's seen a fair amount of use. He touches a single, hesitant finger to its edge, and when no curse flies from its cover, he picks it up and lets it fall open to a random page.
"And yet you showed up anyway," Harry says, smirking at Draco as he passes him by on the steps. He taps his hand to the front door, and it swings open gently. "Not too good for a bit of impurity, are you?"
Even with the blessing of Harry's closest friends, Draco still remembers the way his face burned as he apologized to them for years of harassment, abuse, stalking, undermining, and stark bigotry. He thinks of Harry's furious face on that crag in the Atlantic, Harry's accusations of plotting to murder him, and he hopes, he
Stupid to lie to himself, really. He's wanted to be in Potter's orbit since he was eleven, even if it took being his worst self to attract the other boy's notice. Potter's hatred felt better than Potter ever ignoring him, seeking the thrill of those green eyes focused on
"What, a Mind Healer?" Harry scoffs. "Not likely. I'm not letting some professional stranger root about in my head."
"I don't see how that matters," Potter growls, stabbing a spear of broccolini.
The next morning, the news comes that Pertinger has lost all her magic.
"I don't see what's so wrong with that!" Draco snaps, at last. He manages to snatch his wand from his desktop, and flicks it at his side to pop himself back up to his feet, almost overbalancing once he's there. "I say surprise, but what's the difference between that and having something to present to a client when you tell them you're nixing your previous design?"
remember, I'm twenty-three!"
"No, you dolt." He writes another shorthand sentence on the sticking properties of the spell and their need for enhancement. "Come round for tea and chatting. We'll—what is it Americans say? Have a 'hang sesh'?"
"Why," Potter begins, looking somewhere just past his toes, "did you make this?"
"But I see how much you care for Harry, and I see, even from our scant few meetings, how hard you're working to be better. It gives me genuine hope to see you, son of Lucius Malfoy, the boy who—who made it his
"It might have been," Draco murmurs, tracing limp fingers over the bandage on his forearm.
"I did think of asking you to collect memories for a Pensieve viewing, but—Harry's seen modified memories before. And I assume you don't want to let go of any of those memories. So, a photo album." She pauses. "I think that would do more to help Harry understand how you're a part of his life, more than anything Ron and I could do, honestly."
"I am not. I'm grumbly." Draco weaves his fingers together across his lap, frowning as he leans against the back of his chair. "What do you want me there for? Don't you want an intimate reconnection with Granger and Weasley?"
"You know very well I can't manage even one emotion, much less all of them." Draco's hands twitch with a desire to run them through his hair, but decades of being trained to keep his hands to himself and
The doorbell rings.
Next to the Minister herself. And between Harry and Hermione—
feels less like a punch and more like cannonfire. She's broken perpetrators' ribs multiple times. He pages back to find that she was a bullheaded student at Hogwarts—a Gryffindor, naturally, with little patience or respect for authority, but with a strong aptitude for DADA spells in particular. A truly powerful witch.
Harry throws his arms up, laughing in exasperation. "Of course it is, I'm the one who said it! Look, I'll do it properly, instead of sneaking it in like that." Harry hurls himself from his chair to balance on one knee on the floor in front of Draco, taking both of Draco's hands. "Draco Whatever-Your-Middle-Name-Is Malfoy, will you be my boyfriend?"
Draco can't bring himself to say thank you, but he can at least keep himself from saying anything awful, and instead moves to the door in silence. He pushes through, hoping Pertinger isn't asleep.
It was an act that had helped save him from Azkaban, painted as bravery from a frightened child, but to this day Draco knows he had been a cowardly young adult.
"No, I mean—" Draco groans in frustration, trying to find the right words. "You're made of stone at work. And you hide your hair. And call me Mr. Malfoy. And have nothing on your desk."
"I mean, he's
"You're a miserable cockroach, do you know that? Fifteen years later, and you're
he wants to say, but he just swallows the words, because surely missing a spouse doesn't compare to losing half a lifetime of memories. "I hate to remember that age. I like things the way they—I liked how it was, right before Harry left."
"In wizarding Europe," Draco corrects. He'll duel every magical couturier in Paris for the title if need be. Milan, too. He knows he's good.
"Shut up, Malfoy, I'm explaining my evil plot to you." She twirls her wand in her hand, and Draco watches it carefully, waiting for the curse he'll have to try and dodge. "You have no idea how boring it gets without stupid underlings. That's probably why Voldemort had so many, because he was sad and stupid and lonely."
A boulder drops into the bottom of Draco's stomach, drags it down with its weight. "How long have you been in this house?" He doesn't dare call Harry by any name, now.
, but he wants Williamson to be the one to say it. It makes perfect sense that a seasoned Auror like Williamson would observe his latest Head Auror, profile him as Aurors are wont to do. A disgraced school rival making the same observations—well, there are lots of words Draco might use to describe that, and none of them would be complimentary.
"I'm not lying," Potter says, frowning. "I'm just trying to say—"
"I was trying not to say you look like a twat, but you've forced my hand," Harry says, planting one fist on his hip. "So."
"Keep going."
Harry sits up and turns around all in one instant, wand pointing at Draco as he stares at him with wide eyes. Draco's seen that look before. In Interrogation 1, and in the halls of Malfoy Manor.
"I forgot which cottage was yours," Harry says with a shameless shrug. "I came to invite you out."
Draco looks up, startled. His vibrato heart climbs into his throat as he looks into Harry's eyes for the umpteenth time today, and this time they're soft, shining with something unidentifiable that frightens Draco. He doesn't know what Harry means but he knows what he
He looks up, finally.
"Nothing you could ever give me." All of Potter's familiar anger has washed away, replaced by the frightening, steely Potter who calls him Mr. Malfoy.
"I like food! I like plenty of food. I just like
"What?" Potter looks down sharply. "Fairly attached to not showing all of wizarding society my arse, yeah.
"He said I oughtn't come into the office anymore," Draco says, aware he's whining.
Draco imagines the office inside, within the few seconds of waiting for permission to enter. A mess, likely, and Potter will match it, if his secretary's untamed hair and hastily-tied robes are anything to go by. Potter's appearance has ceased to be public knowledge since his ascension, but Draco remembers Potter's perpetually untidy hair and clothes well enough from school.
Maybe the way Potter's shifted his whole body on the sofa to look at him expectantly. Or the sleep deprivation that might also be behind the tremors in his hands. Draco's body is
"Learning to make clothing was the first time I truly felt in control of myself. The first time I didn't feel like a pointy, ugly git, either." Draco should be moving around to Potter's front now, adjusting the fit of the robe's collar, and yet he gives into his natural cowardice and hides behind Potter where he has no more pinning to do. "So—so yes, it's more than just fabric."
this one has the most inspiration to go through, for very obvious reasons.
"Oh Draco," Pansy sighs as they finally meet. "Should I say the thing? Just to be polite?"
likes saying that.
Those aren't the glasses he wears at the office. Draco suddenly realizes that Potter's head isn't shaved anymore, either, waves of thick black hair framing high cheekbones and a rounded jaw.
"Someone's here, I think," Blaise says, brushing crumbs from his lap as he rises. "Draco, did you invite a third guest?"
"To get to the second floor?" Draco all but squawks, his satchel dropping from suddenly weak fingers. "Are you mad?"
His attacker finally stops. The same hands that were dragging him sits him up neatly against a wall, arms at his sides, feet together. The same voice that blinded him whispers, and suddenly his eyes are full of daggers as light re-enters them. He squeezes his eyelids, and the voice laughs.
"Promise," she agrees with a smile, then holds her hand out to Draco. "Come on then," she says, and Harry scowls. It makes Draco want to take his place on this godforsaken rock, be the new steward of Harry's seaside cottage. Hermione sighs, and lets go of Harry to approach Draco.
"But cooking
"Then," Granger says, with a surreptitious glance at Harry, "I'm Hermione, and that's Ron." She points at her husband, clattering away with the kettle nearby. "Have a seat,
"Why are you doing all this?" Draco wants to know, because he can't just
A new client request. An ordinary event at Atelier Malfoy, and surely not the only one he'll receive today; the client load these days justifies a staff of three other couturiers. But this one—well, there's nothing ordinary about the client.
Draco nearly reaches down to pick up his jaw that must surely be on the floor. "I'm sorry?"
"No," Malfoy snaps, despite the obvious truth. "On your broom, Potter, you're ruining my concentration."
It's Draco's turn to jump when Potter lays his big, heavy head against his shoulder, his breaths finally coming evenly. His whole body radiates fatigue and pain. He doesn't remember doing this with his therapist; usually by now he'd be sitting back in a big, cushiony chair, finding all the nerves in his skin again. There are no cushiony chairs in this strange room though, and now Draco is afraid to move.
"You just want me to say yes."
"I believe that's what people said when I first opened my atelier, so forgive me if I don't accept that answer," Draco says, arching his brows. "You'll tell me before the night is through, you'll see." He glances at Ron; bog-standard navy dress robes, like so many other Ministry men.
"What do you want from me?" he says, scowling at his work. He should say
"Well, if you're
Harry nods solemnly.
"You did bring it up," Malfoy agrees, but he takes a sip of his wine, his eyebrows finally returning to their rightful place above his pale eyes.
preference to how you look. You. The Boy Who Lived."
"I'm rightfully critical, is what I am, and that's why we're business partners," she corrects, holding up one finger.
"Then stop being difficult!" Harry says with a groan. "I can't say all that stuff again, it was hard enough the first time!"
. "Even Gryffindor colors will do, as uninspired a choice as that might be."
he's holding the wands of two of the strangers marching in and out of Pertinger's room.
"Unless you can break Gamp's Law and conjure your own snobbish cup of tea, this is what I've got to offer you," Harry says, giving the tin another quick nudge. "Take your pick, I said."
Well, no, Williamson is still here, poking away at his paperwork, but Williamson doesn't do field work anymore. Which, by Draco's quick estimation, must be where everyone's gone. Brilliant. Bloody brilliant.
For a moment, Malfoy makes as if to leave the pond's shore entirely, holding his impractical-looking shoes in one hand, shirt and socks in the other. Then he stops, the leg not holding his weight bouncing anxiously in place.
. His break from the embroidery, on one occasion, is to cut pattern pieces from his completed yardage of golden linen, squeezing his leaden eyelids shut between pieces. That's about when he realizes he forgot to acquire lining for the inner robe, because the atelier has such a well-stocked selection of lining-appropriate fabrics that he can't remember the last time he had to think about lining. He'll have to sneak some out of the atelier.
"Introduce us, mate?" Ron scoffs. "I don't know if you remember, but we've met."
It has been three days since his fallout with Harry. As instructed, he hasn't gone into the DMLE offices. He also has not reached out to his friends again, despite having just promised them to be more communicative and less of a self-pitying bastard. He suspects he'll get an earful about that, if any of them ever speak to him again. Poor Greg never even heard from him.
"No you won't, because I'm a master, and you're Harry," she says. "But seriously, Harry. I'm happy you're back. Please tell me you're
But he does as Granger asked. He tells Harry's friends about his split life between Head Auror Potter and just Harry, who until recently only ever seemed to surface when he was alone with Draco. He tells them about finding Harry mid-panic attack; he tells them about the episode that nearly took Thaddeus Dendron's head off, or so Ministry damage control said. He tells them about the canola fields.
"Well, I didn't just come with food, you know," Molly says, already dabbing at Draco's eyes with a handkerchief pulled from nowhere. He screws his eyes shut and lets her. "I've got a bit of good news, sweetheart."
"I'm not changing my mind," he says, words passing through lips that feel numb.
this is part of a double update, so if you're just catching up, PLEASE be sure to go back and read chapter 6 (interlude: harry) as well.
do you ask?"
"Pansy didn't make this," Ginny says, coolly.
"Oh." Draco reaches for the teacup, which seems to sprout a saucer as if Harry's only just remembered it. The knot in his throat is a full-blown lump now, choking him and making him blink rapidly. "What are you trying to do to me, Potter?"
Of course, the drawing room is still a prime center of horror. Here, by the abandoned hearth, is where Draco received the Dark Mark he had only very briefly wanted, along with the agony of the Mark being burned into his skin with caustic magic. There, not far from the door, is where Aunt Bellatrix had tortured Hermione Granger to incoherent tears. And somewhere in between is the spot where Snatchers had shown Draco the lumpy face of the boy he'd immediately known to be Harry Potter, and Draco had very poorly pretended otherwise.
Draco doesn't know how long they sit in the courtyard together, utterly silent. He leans against Pansy's massive stuffed sleeves, practically a pillow so long as he keeps clear of her stiff lace collar. After a short eternity, Pansy shifts, pushing at Draco until he sits up. "Looks like he found you," she whispers.
"Alright, comfortable seat, logical equation, go," Draco prods, without waiting another second.
"Who—?" Draco's question is answered the moment Pansy and her enormous dress move off the bench. Harry stands in the courtyard entrance, tugging urgently at the sleeves of his golden linen robe.
It doesn't answer the question, not really. But for Draco, and all his years of being in Potter's orbit, it's answer enough.
When he emerges, his satchel is on a hook on the wall he's quite sure wasn't there before, and he grabs his bag as though the hook personally insulted him. It
"Okay," Draco murmurs. "Thank you."
Draco makes him whole. He can't deny it. Especially not now, the sky beyond the windows just beginning to lighten as Harry lays down next to Draco where he's sprawled on top of the covers. Draco is already asleep, put under by the exhaustion of his important work, but Harry finds a new feeling wedging itself in with the others as he watches Draco's sleeping face, serene and soft. His hands twitch with the urge to caress that face, feel how peaceful he never is when he's awake.
"Why would you
"Terry Boot. Ernest Macmillan. Michael Corner. Penelope Clearwater, if that doesn't violate the 'bro code,' or what have you—she courted one of the Weasleys at some point, didn't she?"
"I'm sorry," Draco says, quickly before Harry can cut him off again. It's surprisingly easy to gather Harry's hands in his own, easier still to thumb at the tears pooling in Harry's shining eyes. "I am."
"You're a candid one," Draco says, almost laughing. "Did you criticize Shacklebolt like that?"
"Yes, and I—"
"It all fits!" Draco says, pacing Harry's office with the door closed. "The victims aren't just losing their magic suddenly, it's being
Harry?"
"I—" Harry frowns. "No, not really."
Draco sets out snack foods and thinks about Harry's insinuation about their meeting tomorrow.
"Draco!"
"Is that what you were hoping for?" Harry quips, but it's good-natured as he finally reveals what he's brought. A long, narrow wooden box.
Eleven months. Mrs. Weasley brings him a mountain of cooked food after Ron apparently tells her about Draco's empty kitchen. Draco realizes, after she's left, that she's put away Harry's spices and hung up the pan on the stove.
"You want to work together at Malfoy Manor?"
A pause from Malfoy, and then, "Right, hadn't we better."
"Yes, well, lots to do," Draco says, with a nervous handwave.
"Idiot, am I?" Harry says, and he lets go right when Malfoy's balance is at its worst. "Whoops! Clumsy idiot, that's me." Malfoy shrieks, and Harry catches him by the front of his tailored button-down shirt at the last second before he tumbles end over end down the incline.
Except he doesn't seem to be. Five minutes later, Draco's lost what little patience he has, and Salazar knows he's worked hard over the years to have even that much. "Potter. I have seen
"I cannot tell you," Draco says, as they break for air, "h-how long I've wanted this—ah, ah, ah—" Harry buries his face in Draco's chest again, dangerously close to sucking a love bite into the completely unhideable skin. Draco wonders if Harry's been tantalized by it all night.
"Sometimes I think about the stunts I pulled on a broom when I was younger, and I can hear all my joints creak at once," Potter agrees. He holds his arms out at his sides as Draco carefully divests him of the outer robe, making sure the pins stay in place
"Shall I go on?" Malfoy asks, with a nervous smirk that tells Harry he's actually asking, as much as he's trying to be funny.
He lets his hands slip away from hers. "He won't want my help."
"And you have to take them now?"
"If I kill Harry Potter, that's great. Everyone will act all pathetic about it and lose all morale,
Draco lets go of Harry, watching for spectators as he climbs the dais.
"Alright, Malfoy, what's your game?" Harry demands as he storms up to Malfoy on the other end of the bar.
"I'm not! I was only—" He sighs. "Here." Draco holds both his hands out on the table's pitted cork surface.
"You mean
And judging by the size and placement of the manor on the horizon, this is the exact spot in the canola fields where Harry had pulled Draco after the Dendron incident. The spot where Harry had finished Draco off, really, calling him by his first name and more than that calling him
Harry's eyes flutter open, and the gold eyeliner brings out gold flecks in Harry's green eyes. Either that or Draco is imagining it in his lovesick brain, because he's so close to Harry's face it would be nothing to kiss him. Harry's lips are only inches away, the lush forests of his eyes searching Draco's. It might be fewer inches than he thinks, because he can feel Harry's breath puffing across his own lips.
"I didn't mean..." Draco trails off, not even sure what it is he
Harry frowns, his hand falling from Draco's face to join its partner in holding Draco's hand. His hand becomes the focal point of all of Draco's senses for a moment, mapping the exact places where Harry's fingers are wrapped around him. The track his thumb runs, dragging and catching against the grain of Draco's skin. Harry looks toward the window and its drawn curtains.
Pansy doesn't reply, uncapping the little bottle to splash some into her tea. She still leaves it on the counter for him to put away, because she'll never
"I don't want to, anymore."
"I was stupid," Harry hisses. "I should have kept—"
Draco holds out his hand for the parchment, chortling. She must have misread. "Now what would we do with ten thousand spools of—"
"Can I tell you?" Potter says. "Part of the reason I couldn't shout at you properly was because of that stupid pincushion you've got. What is that even supposed to be? It looks like a bloated hamster."
"Clearly." Draco flexes his fingers, wondering if he's hung on too long. Probably. He withdraws his hands.
Within the hour, a soft pop of displaced air heralds the arrival of Hermione, and Draco wills himself not to let himself fall off the cliff's edge after all when Harry runs to her with glee.
"Oh, don't start," Draco groans. "I don't want you finding a way to make this your fault, or a reason you're still too dangerous and now you've got to go wobbly-charm your hair off again and abandon everyone for another five years, myself included."
The embroidery on the dark green outer robe glows as Draco spreads the silk out across the carpet. A stag leads three does across a forest floor, rich with moss, lichen, ferns, and dotted with bluebells that almost seem to tinkle in a ghostly wind. The holly trees behind them look old, and the forest deep, despite being only outlines made of silver thread. Above them hangs a moon that is very nearly full, as the real moon will be on May 2nd. Draco had wanted to enchant the moon to reflect the real-time phases of the moon, but his tired brain hadn't been able to quite grasp the spellwork needed. Along the robe's hem and long sleeve cuffs, green crystals are set into silver embroidery of antlers sprouting lilies; it might be on the nose, but he thinks the details are small enough to matter only to those looking far too closely.
"Why you're...?" Harry's glasses drop back into place on his nose as he frowns softly.
"Oh, because you love lording your title over me,
Draco doesn't want to get everything up, he wants to pull Harry back on top of him and get Harry's clothes off. Barring that, he wants to interrogate Harry on why he wanted to kiss Draco at all, because Draco knows
The finished ensemble shines. Draco could not imagine a better way for Harry's closest friends to be reintroduced to him. His linen robe and its sunburst of pearls shines as if made of molten gold, fitted to skim Harry's body much like a
scream for her again, as he curls in on himself with his wand held in both hands, blood slicking his palms—Griselda approaches. Her magic pulls him back by his short hair, and she grabs at his left arm to yank his sleeve up, popping buttons and tearing fabric as she does. His faded Dark Mark lies underneath.
"They ought to put a light in that closet," Harry says, thinking absently of his cupboard. Suddenly his exhaustion envelops him, alcohol and a long day of hiking up and down a mountain and an early morning all crashing together to make him long for his bed in his cottage. He opens his mouth to say they ought to get a move on—
God, he should have not been such an excitable little busybody, and assigned this job to any one of his employees instead. A random employee of Atelier Malfoy wouldn't have the baggage of a personal history with the client who needed his front rise taken next. A random employee would probably be more polite, too,
Exhaling hard, Harry shakes his head. "Just give me a little more time, Draco." He plants a kiss on Draco's forehead, even as Draco tries not to succumb to his sinking anxiety. "Please."
"Oh, don't pin it on me," she says with a scowl. "I got tired of always sending the first owl."
"Course they will." His smile hasn't broken. "Someone's also going to think I'm a fat has-been and a total nutter for being a shut-in all these years." Harry won't stop looking at him.
If this is the source of Venari Virtute, whatever was at work here is long gone, and Draco's tracking spell is a failure. Back to square one, with more people likely to die while Draco struggles to find a new angle. He huffs through his nose in frustration.
"Ah." Draco smirks, thumb rubbing circles into the back of Harry's hand. "What growth."
"I would if my hands weren't too small for—"
"Harry, mate. Please."
He doesn't know what to do with Potter if he's not being snide and cruel, or more newly, working through the case of Venari Virtute. Snide and cruel comes easily to him, as much as being craven and duplicitous.
, of Harry kissing his neck in some shadowy corner of the venue, the sadder he'll be when the time comes. He won't be entering the Gala on Potter's arm, but more likely three feet behind him, checking that Harry's three-foot train is intact and draping correctly.
terse."
"I like how you say 'Head Auror Potter' as though you've never met him before," she says, leaning back with another smirk. Draco doesn't miss her quick scrawl on the notepad braced against her crossed legs. She uses Muggle pen and paper; she's said in the past she found quills and parchment cumbersome, and Draco often wonders if she isn't right.
He thinks of Potter in his dream, beatific and strange. The canola flower on his bedside table, though—that had still been there, the morning after, real and wilting. "He was there," Draco affirms. He's taking in the pattern on the area rug between them now, not for the first time. Peacocks. There are no more peacocks on the manor grounds in 2013.

"I would rather die," Draco says, straightening just enough to look Harry in the eye. "I would rather
"I've earned my right to comfort!" Harry practically stabs himself in the chest with his own pointing finger. "And you—why are you even here? Isn't this well below your stupid Pureblood standards?"
He's crying.
"I promise. I do. It's all yours right now."
When Potter sits back, it's a slight motion, given that his back is already ramrod straight, but Draco takes instant heed, and schools his face to reflect minimal, professional interest. "You cannot share anything you see today with anyone else."
Draco gets up as well, and frowns at Potter. "Am I back to being Mr. Malfoy when we return?"
"It didn't seem fair to treat you as equal to your father," Harry says at last. "Because you were a child. But it doesn't change that the rest of us were children, too, subject to your bigotry for years."
"Potter. I'm on the clock." Draco sets the glass down with a firm
"I take it back. Difficult is too kind a word for what you are," Hermione says. She leaves Draco's side, striding the few short steps into the fray of the other two men. "Ronald, that's not how that story goes."
Silence again. Draco wonders how honest all of Potter's assurances that he liked the robes might actually be.
"The whole point of bringing you sketches is so that you choose!" Draco says, pointing at Potter with his fork. "Otherwise I'd just be treating you like a mannequin on the move, wouldn't I? Just barge into your home, pin some clothes to your body like some pervert, and be on my way without a word. Would that suit you better?"
"I keep having the same nightmare," Draco whispers, the words tumbling from his mouth unbidden. "But I feel safe out here."
"You look like you're about to vibrate out of your skin, darling," Pansy says as she arrives, thirty minutes later than she ought to. A cloud of tiny, translucent pink bats halo her pristine bob, though the clean lines of her black A-line dress and tights say she's ready to work. "What on earth is the matter with you? And—wait, are you leaving already?"
"Just let me finish making the tea I should have started as soon as Malfoy walked in," Weasley says. "And I call myself an Englishman."
"I was actually a bit nervous the first time I cooked for you," Harry admits. "Things are different from when we were children, but you were still, you know. Malfoy. You prefer the finer things, and you're not quiet about it, either."
"Regardless of your inability to make the distinction,
"I thought—" Harry clears his throat, and takes a seat on the garden bench against the side of the house. "Hermione said you'd be here."
"What a relief," Draco says, rolling his eyes.
He enters the wrong numbers into his payroll calculations twice in a row, and theorizes wildly about why Potter might have gone into hiding. He looks over an invoice for fabric acquired by Wilda Bucket, who's working on another Gala garment—this one for a mid-level Ministry official with wealthy parentage—and he daydreams of exploring the rest of Twelve Grimmauld Place. He doesn't even realize he's doing it until his imaginary self is reaching for the doorknob of Potter's bedroom, and he looks down to see he's initialed the invoice
Draco knows he's being ludicrous, acting like he's got to protect Harry from his own friends—he regrets
"I'm hardly kind," Draco says, his voice suddenly harsh.
"You should go back inside," Potter says, gently.
Draco's ears are filled with the heavy sound of the blood rushing away from his face. "What?"
"To—I don't know. To help me. To be kind to me."
"Take down that very obvious Disillusionment Charm, then." Draco lowers his wand, but he refuses to holster it.
"Oh, Harry," Hermione says again, twisting her hands together with a pained expression. "I'm so sorry. Is this why you never came home?"
The sound of a sharp inhale nearly escapes him.
If Draco didn't know any better, he'd have to write back and call Harry a liar, because he's feeling well wooed. A shame he knows quite a bit better.
Nine months. He takes Dreamless Sleep to force himself to get rest. He doesn't find anything to say when his friends visit anymore.
"I'm not making you a bloody headpiece for the Gala," Pansy says with a scowl, when she senses Draco coming near with intentions to ask for just that. His boyhood skill at Occlumency has worn off at last, or he's just
He can't say it.
But Harry holds up a hand. "I did lie when I said I didn't need anything, just now, just—what I need isn't your sewing. Not now, anyway." He plucks at his robes, the organza rustling softly. "What I need is
"Ha!" Malfoy barks. "You, a sadist? You don't know the first thing."
given—
"Oh."
"I try," Harry says, sounding so melodramatically put upon, "
Harry chews his lower lip. "It's not the same when you choose to be alone. It's—respite, especially when you know everyone you love, and who loves you back, will be there when you're ready to return."
Potter is revisiting war sites in the dead of night.
project. Potter's hands brush against Draco's as they trace the beads, a glass fawn pausing to investigate his fingertips.
"Blimey, Hermione, can't you let me get away with just one?" Ron groans.
"I don't see how jealousy figures into it," Draco says, letting his hands fall to the bench, "when it has nothing to do with me."
"It's, er..."
He doesn't tell them about Harry in his dreams. He certainly doesn't tell them he wants to hold Harry until all the fear and anger drains away permanently, especially because he knows he doesn't hold that kind of power.
"That's right," Draco says, watching Potter staring at the way the antlers twine against each other.
It's that particular detail that finally brings Draco rapidly up to speed with reality. His robes are twisted around his upper body, and his shirt is creased against his skin, but from the waist down all he's got on is his underwear. (Teal, printed with bananas, tight, purchased at a Muggle shop.)
Harry's with his people. He's happy, he's safe, he's comfortable. As Harry tells Charlie he feels silly for having been so nervous about coming to the Gala, Draco slips his fingers from Harry's, and lets himself be swallowed up by the crowd.
Harry doesn't laugh. "You didn't wake me."
He shows Harry—Potter, he's slipped again—the beading along the linen robe's collar, a ring of shining glass beads two inches wide that cascades down the robe's front in multiple shades of green and blue. Draco won't pretend the design is anything more than inspired by formal Indian menswear he's researched, given his own very white English roots. Tiny fawns made of clear opalescent glass race through the green and blue beads, or nose the invisible ground for grass, or kick their little hind legs up as they cavort. To finish this one, Draco opted not to sleep at all that night, that he might still be able to work on the
"The Gala's been canceled?" Potter snorts. He leans against the door of the sitting room, tugging at the sagging cuffs of his jumper.
"I told you he would," Hermione says, elbowing Ron in the ribs, but she's tearing up, a little hiccup of a sob escaping her. "Oh, Harry!" She flings her arms around him, Harry embracing her in kind. "I'm so happy you came!"
"I could have been!" Malfoy retorts, shaking the swimsuit at Harry. "I ought to go right back to bed. Fuck your plans."
Eight months. The case must be deep. Draco thinks about expanding the garden and starting an orchard.
A grimace on Potter's part. "That might be one way to put it."
Pansy had snickered.
As it turns out, Quidditch was the right answer for light conversation, because somehow by the time Harry's finished his stew and lager and successfully ordered a stout to follow it all, neither man is finished talking about the game. On Harry's third pint, they've shifted to talking about Hogwarts Quidditch; Hufflepuff has been dominating all year, much to everyone's surprise; Slytherin and Gryffindor, in fact, seem to be battling it out for last place, much to both their chagrin.
"Be reasonable. I'm powerless." He holds up his empty hands.
just eat your food."
Draco wants to write down that Harry will be by on Thursday afternoon, but his planner is in his bag, and he's still so used to having to get up and physically grab things if he wants them that he doesn't think to Accio the whole lot. He'll remember, anyway. Friday. No, Thursday.
Draco doesn't like this Potter one bit. He's always had a tempestuous relationship with Potter, but at least the Potter he grew up with—fiery, impetuous, disrespectful, certainly a streak of martyrdom—was a known quantity. The Potter he's faced with now is an immovable object, and if manipulation works on him, it's outside of Draco's usual bag of tricks.
And then his hand freezes, halfway through picking up the next item in the tray.
"I know he is," Hermione says with exasperation, accepting a cup from Ron and immediately stirring it with nervous little clinks of the spoon that was on the saucer. "He's also not letting his brain leak out of his ears staring at a little screen all day."
"Do you want soul-baring or do you want light?" Malfoy interrupts.
"Weird is all sorts of things, but two grown men calling each other by their given names is not it," Draco snorts. "Of course, now I'll have to make something to wear to the Gala, and if I'm still conscious by the second of May, it'll be a miracle. You live to exhaust me, don't you?" He locks eyes with Harry, smirking. "Harry."
I’m sorry for there, but you were eleven and scared and I don’t think I was very nice. I’m sorry about that time me and Ron polyjuiced into Crabbe and Goyle – “
“That she was the Ravenclaw Boys dorms favourite crush.”
“I know that, but she doesn’t know it. She needs someone who gets her, you know? Someone who isn’t going to force her to be the pureblood wife she doesn’t want to be.”
“They certainly are,” said Dean. Seamus was jumping around the room delightedly, and Blaise was laughing.
“Hermione,” said Anthony. He was looking at her again, cool yet friendly. “What an unexpected delight this is.”
“Uh huh,” said Harry, and wondered if, just maybe, he should fling himself from the top of the ministry.
“What do you do to stop thinking about someone?” he asked Ron over a pint. “Hypothetically.”
dance – “
Like he just wanted Draco.
“And a big Weasley wedding might be a bit much for me.”
“Sure,” said Harry, and kissed him. Draco’s mouth was warm and sweet under him, and there was a nasty bitter aftertaste of cigarettes but somehow that made it more real, the two of them tangled together. One kiss turned into two, and then another, and then Draco was moaning and clinging to Harry, his body supple around him.
“Who indeed. So Harry turned me gay, then,” said Ginny. “Did he turn you gay too?”
“Hi,” said Harry.
It was her heart breaking.
“Sounds smashing, Harry. I’ll be over in five.”
“Yeah.” She tried, and failed, to blow a smoke ring. Dumbledore had made it look so easy. “Now I know I’m wanted in the way I wanted to be back then. And it feels kind of empty. They’ve all got an idea of me, and none of them just see me and know me like Ron did.”
“Let’s all go,” sighed Draco, pulling his hands away from Harry’s. “I’m sure we’ll all be involved anyway. Was Corner a horrible date?”
“Huh,” she said.
“No I mean – this group, they aren’t my friends. They made their own thing during university, and it’s great, it’s all about forgiveness from the war and no longer hurting and getting over differences and all that great big moral stuff. But I’m not part of it. And it’s ok for you – you can just slip right back in with Hermione and Harry. But I can’t do that. I had a – a role. As the only person on Draco’s side. And it’s gone.”
Theo sighed. “Are we really going to talk about this? Right now?”
“Mione…?”
“I don’t want to hear it, Ron,” she said.
“Lost the war?”
“Seriously,” said Ron. “There’s nothing evil left for him to do. The only thing he could do to upset you is fight with you, and if you ignore him – sorry, I know, but she’s
“We were just-“
Harry frowned. “But he said – “
“I just meant – “ Hermione’s face was hot. “I just meant that me and you, single girls, it’s fun. If I was actually dating one of them he’d always be around, hanging on, and we wouldn’t be able to go out and flirt with random guys anymore. I’d be there on the side lines, worrying about having a boyfriend and probably having to text him every five minutes.”
Seamus started laughing. It was a horrible sound, cracked and wild and crazy. He stalked over to the wall and kicked it as hard as he could. Then again, and again, and then he was driving his fists into the wall and laughing and crying and Dean was pulling him back, holding him as he thrashed wildly.
“Ron, I really, really, really don’t think that’s a good idea,” said Harry, trying to keep the urgency out of his voice. “I think that may be one of the worst ideas you’ve ever had. Anyway – woo hoo, Pansy’s free, right?”
“I’m thinking you have suffered a traumatic brain injury, Pans, because Ron Weasley? Really?”
“It’s the – it's the fucking
“So,” said Daphne, leaning forward and flashing far more cleavage than Harry needed to see. “You uni students are meant to be great at drinking games. How about we restart the Gryffindor-Slytherin rivalry, boys?”
“Sure,” he said. He didn’t feel very changed at all, really. He was still just Harry, and he was beginning to worry that might not be enough anymore. “How about your love life?”
“Get me another drink first, and we’ll see how far I can swing.”
He shot Harry a two-fingered salute, which was
And he fled back into the party, trying to avoid anyone’s gaze. He found Susan and Blaise in the corner, and settled in next to them. They were safe. They weren’t doing anything confusing, like throwing Harry’s clearly set ideas about them after eight years down the drain.
“For George?” said Harry. “Absolutely.”
“We should go to bed,” said Hermione, passing the cigarette back to Malfoy.
“Harry,” said Blaise, cornering him outside the library with Susan appearing at his other side. “Me and Bones have decided to do something about your crushing loneliness.”
“I do care about you,” Harry said desperately. “Why can’t you believe that?”
“Harry,” said Michael. “Please, we’re friends. You can’t do this.”
“I see. I will – um, I’ll go.”
“You always seemed a little more reasonable.”
“Feel better?”
After five minutes of bitching about their various acquaintances, whether Pansy’s mother was really having a spiritual awakening or just having another affair and whether Theo and Daphne had finally called off their sham of an engagement, Pansy finally asked how Draco was.
“Er, no?”
“I wish you’d stop calling them that,” said Hermione, blushing. “Fine. Michael’s gone now, anyway – good riddance – and I’m thinking of setting Terry up with Luna. And Anthony’s going to be just fine, I imagine.”
“Awww,” said Harry, pushing a blushing Draco in his chair. “I can’t believe you put that much thought into it, and the best all of you could come up with was ‘Potter Stinks’.”
Draco looked over at Harry and squeezed his hand.
“She’s having a really tough time of it. We have to do self-defence classes, and unless I’m paired with her they don’t hold back. She’s coming out of them way more hurt than she should be.”
Malfoy swallowed. “Because I need to say this to Potter at some point as well.” He was actually managing to look her in the eyes now. “But that will probably be quite some while in the future, given how long my pride will need to recover from this.” He caught her glare and sighed. “
like a nipple. Draco’s nipples were quite tasty.
Malfoy’s face was stony. He took another drag of his cigarette and flicked his eyes up and down over Harry, but apparently didn’t feel the need to speak. Harry took a deep breath and tamped down the simmering anger inside him that Malfoy always seemed to bring out.
“Oh,” said Ron. “Oh, Hermione, please don’t.”
After Blaise and Susan had disappeared into her room, and Parvati and Hermione had settled into a corner to kiss and whisper, and Theo had stormed off to his room, Harry looked around for Draco and found he’d disappeared. So had Seamus. Dean was outside, sitting in the outdoors cupboard with the door open, distinguishable only by the lit tip of his cigarette. Harry went out and sat opposite him.
“It’s fine,” said Harry. Draco pursed his lips.
“I take it I’m interrupting,” said a voice.
pushover.
“Woah,” said Blaise. “Harry, hit me before I say something that will get me hexed.”
Draco got up to piss, and then he came back to bed and tossed them both off with one hand straining around the combined width of them, cock rubbing slickly against Harry’s, while his other hand sunk into Harry’s hair and pulled his head back. The noises he made were filthy and incandescent.
“You haven’t actually done the shot yet,” said Harry. “Technically it’s still a draw – “
“Harry, please. Don’t.”
Parvati forcefully covered her sister’s mouth. “I am a
“Well, that was weird,” Harry said to the empty air, and resolved not to think about whether that was about Hermione or Pansy.
“I don’t know. I’m still not sure I don’t hate you. No, I don’t hate you. When did that change?”
No answer.
“Draco - “
“Parvati, I’m so, so sorry.”
Harry caught his wrist in his hand. “It’s not cowardice. I’m going to be absolutely thrilled the day that I get to stand next to you and introduce you as my boyfriend, but it’s ok for me to wait. I’ll think of it as something to look forward to.”
“Everyone wishes I would stop talking about you.”
“She bloody asked me if she was!”
“Cheers, Seamus. You’re a pretty solid bloke, considering you’re Irish.”
“Is that what you did, with your first apology to Thomas?”
“Fine. Fine! Jesus. Ok, I’m sorry that I saved Buckbeak from death after he “mauled” you. He was a very dangerous creature and I’m sure he deserved to be immediately executed for your little owie. Apology done now?”
“He tells me everything,” said Hermione. “Literally. Everything.”
“Right,” said Harry, sounding terrified. Malfoy and the other boy had already gone back to snogging. “So I’ll just – go then. Right. Bye.”
“I know what?”
“So, to be clear – your apology comes with a favour?”
“Um,” she said.
“Rather,” he said. “Can I please, please run away now?”
“Cheers,” said Greg, halfway through a burp.
“You dramatically fucked up, mate,” said Harry, pouring a bit more vodka into his cup. “Calling yourself a catch? That was a pretty dick move.”
“All right,” said Harry. “I’ll do – I don’t know, something.” Malfoy nodded and drew away at that, leaving Harry a little bit shaken. “And I’ll talk to Ron, too,” he said quickly. “I mean, he probably already knows. I’m pretty sure they partnered her with him because of it.”
“Pansy,” said Ron, holding out a hand towards her.
“Only potentially. One of the Ilvermony lads in my lectures – George, second year, you’d like him – is having a house party and he told me to invite “literally everyone I know.” So that’s what I’m doing. What do you say? Booze, bad music, scandal, possibly drugs – it has everything.”
“You don’t know him,” said Pansy, her voice thick.
“I – “ Hermione’s voice trailed into a squeak. “I’m sorry. I don’t – “
“Sorry, did you say your dad was an Irish muggle called Phil who was in a band?”
“You don’t need to make me feel better –“
“I will push you off this balcony.”
“Because I didn’t care!” Malfoy threw the remains of his water into the sink with a vicious flick. “You are
“I’m gay,” she said. “Oh fuck, I mean I think I like boys – but not you – I mean I like you – but girls are – they have thighs.”
“When did I turn you down? You were – I was – “ She hung her head. “I heard what you were saying earlier about me, ok? It doesn’t have to be awkward, we can still be friends – “
“So – “ He felt like he’d just been struck with a large battleaxe. “So none of you hate me for my shameful Gryffindor fling?”
“I hate you,” said Pansy. “I hate you so much, and I’m going to tell our future kids that you said that about their hypothetical noses.”
“It’s fine. Ok, no it’s not. It’s only four pounds of make-up, I’ll have you know.” Hermione laughed, and Parvati smiled softly. “But you’re also, like, one of the three most traumatised people in the world, and I know I wasn’t exactly super-nice to you all the way through school. So, fair’s fair. Come on – peace offering make-over? I promise I’ll keep it light. Maybe just some lipstick.”
“That she tried to sell us all out?” Ron shrugged. “Everybody already knows. I think that’s why they put me with her – some of the other trainees were giving her shit, and I told everyone to leave her alone, and now they think we’re friends.”
“Not that much.”
“I have a terrible secret,” said Draco, pacing in front of the assembled Council of Slytherins who had gathered in Pansy’s flat. “And I need you not to hate me for it. You’re probably going to hate me a little bit, and I’m sorry, but there’s nothing really I can do about it. Oh god, wait, I can’t tell you. It’s too terrible.”
Draco blushed furiously. “Yes, well. The only other person you’ve had sex with was a lesbian. Seeing as I’m so brilliant, do you think you could grab me a glass of water? I think most of the fluid just left my body.”
This close to someone, you couldn’t lie. Near-touch demanded honesty.
Hermione felt her cheeks burn, and pushed past the two of them. Behind her, Parvati was hissing something at her sister. She didn’t know what that meant, and honestly? She didn’t care. What? You’re going to have a good year because you’re such a bookworm, Hermione? You’re going to have a good year (sarcastic) you sad sack? You’re going to have a good year  - because you weren’t paying attention to your precarious stack of books, and have now accidentally clocked someone in the chest with one, apparently.
“They hung out together, and being around a real actual gay who definitely didn’t want to shag him made him change his mind a bit. Also Draco went on a big rant about how repeating what your parents said blindly led to ruin and calamity. There may have been a slideshow. Seamus clearly didn’t want to revisit it.”
Draco grimaced. “Please, Pans, there was enough drama going round without you deliberately stirring any more up.”
Pansy laughed. “Bad luck, Draco. Better start morris dancing.”
“Your dad was in
“And snogging Harry,” said Seamus. “I thought you weren’t into all that Chosen One worship, but apparently you just can’t wait to gobble down some Golden Boy dick.”
“I’m sorry,” he said, to Harry’s questioning look. “It’s just – if they see me holding your arm, you know what they’ll say. I didn’t realise they’d be here. Stupid of me, of course. You – you don’t want that.”
Well. Nothing like turning the tables on the snakey tossers – uh, the respectable Slytherins. “All right, Pansy. Truth or Dare?”
“Girl in the corner in yellow,” said Susan. “Very tricky colour to pull off, especially with her complexion. I should know. Those damn Hufflepuff ties were the bane of my life.”
“Well, Potter, I’d like to say something about how being freed from the restrictive standards applied to pureblood wives allowed me to discover my own taste, but honestly it’s just to piss off my parents.”
Studying could only really help for so long.
There was Malfoy, wearing – well. Wearing Muggle clothes, and leaning against the bar like a muggle, and handing over a piece of A4 paper while doing something with his mouth that was probably supposed to be friendly. Harry spun back around violently.
“The bass. Not anymore, I had to leave it – well, I don’t have it anymore.”
“Oh, was it a disappointment?”
“Yes, Seamus,” said Blaise, patiently.
He laughed. “You think this is just about the war? Sure, let’s go with that.”
“I wish I could stop thinking about you. What a pair we make.”
“I’m sorry.”
Parvati waved her arm. “Please. Not to be crass but you’re Hermione Granger at a club opening. There’ll be paparazzi everywhere. All you need to do is tell one of them that you’re wearing Padma Patil and we’ll be even. Though if you want to treat it as a favour, there is one thing you could do for me.”
“Yeah, but that wasn’t because you were going through some deep complicated psychosexual issues. That was just because you were dumb.” He exhaled slowly. “Which, by the way, is what you should tell Draco.”
“What?”
“I was trying to charm her. I try and charm everyone. It’s just my thing. I’m charming.” There was a heavy silence. Blaise peeked out at them from a crack between his fingers. “I’m charming, right lads?”
“I kind of want to hear about it,” said Seamus. “Harry’s Malfoy rants were always really funny. He used to do a dead good impression of him.”
“He’s a good person, right? They all are. They’re all such good people, and that means that anything they do to the evil people like us is justified. He is Ron Weasley, hero of the wizarding world, and he doesn’t end up with a girl like you. Do you really think you could give him what he wants, Pansy? He was with Granger. That’s who he wants. He wants babies and domesticity and uncomplicated goodness, and I’m sorry, Pans, but that’s not you.”
Draco laughed when Harry asked him about the slideshow. “There was only one slide,” he said, and touched his left arm.  “You avoid touching it.”
she put her head against her books and sighed.
“Sorry, Blaise, but have you seen Draco?”
“You called them ugly first,” said Ron, and he was smiling so gently, and his eyes were so interested, and he looked like he could have stayed out in the January cold all night.
“Nah,” said Harry. His cocktail came with an
“So what’s making you miserable?”
They were coming up the path to their dorm room now. “Hey Dean. You’re not straight.”
“Ancient Greek poet. And Eileen Myles. ‘I think writing is desire, not a form of it.’”
Malfoy covered his face. “Merlin and Morgana both, Potter. It was supposed to be a joke, you can’t tell me you actually don’t – ugh, whatever. Utilitarianism  is the belief that whatever makes the most people the happiest is the right thing to do. It’s simple maths. One life – yours – for the lives of two-hundred and eighty students in that school. Do you understand? Pansy was trying to do the right thing.”
Harry sighed. “I realised afterwards at the club that I’d basically thrown you over to cop off with someone. I think with all the – the – “ He lowered his voice in a way that was
Parvati took a hit, turned to her left and beckoned Seamus over, doing the same to him. And then Seamus took a hit, and turned to Dean, pulling him closer by the collar. Dean’s eyes were wide, his mouth falling slack. Seamus kept his eyes open, staring straight at Dean, as he pushed his mouth closer. The smoke curled between them, gentle. And then Dean took a hit and, instead of turning towards Harry, pulled Seamus in with one hand on the small of his back. Seamus’s eyes were closed this time.
Hermione was still staring at him. Then she pushed herself off the bed and started swearing in long, colourful strings.
There was Harry, walking back from a lecture with Granger next to him fussing over something the lecturer had said, how he was totally wrong and that kind of thinking was
Malfoy turned a little bit redder. “
“And you, Granger? Anything you want to comment on?”
“What are you terrible witches conspiring about?” demanded Draco. His face was very pinched. He looked a lot like young Draco, just then. Maybe he was going to tell his father about it.
“Uh.” Harry tried not to look like someone who’d just had sex. “Yeah. Yeah, we’re studying.”
“Not being flush isn’t a reason to be ashamed, Malfoy.”
Harry blinked. “I thought you said – “
. I’ll tell him what’s what. How dare he treat women like this? Honestly, Morag is right.”
“She taught me well. Now, Harry, do you think we could persuade Hermione to put an extension charm on the kitchen below?”
Nott nodded, but Zabini just sniffed. “I don’t think so, Weasley. I didn’t dress this good to be seen by the barkeeps alone. Susan, will you do me the honour?”
“Hermione, I know, but please don’t ruin this for me. Sometimes, you just have to let your inner fifteen year old out.”
Susan gave a sad little laugh. “And say what? That he said some dirty things on a date with me? Nothing happened.”
Draco shifted uncomfortably. “I think maybe it’s best if we let this one slide.”
date me?”
“It was different with you.”
“Give me a second.” Draco was drumming his fingers again, his expression thoughtful. “Ok. Which Hogwarts house is morally the best, in terms of what it believes?”
“I doubt that,” said Harry, thinking of this morning where Draco had fucked him in the shower till he saw stars.
Blaise flung his arms wide. “I’m going to throw a party. A proper one, not one of our shitty little flat ones.”
“I don’t want a relationship,” said Hermione. “Not when I’ve got you.”
“You said you wouldn’t get weird.”
The shout echoed off the walls of the Muggle train as Seamus and Dean descended on the table that Harry and Hermione had grabbed. Across the aisle from them, an elderly woman in a bobble hat turned and gave them a distinctly dirty look, taking in the whole lot of them – the bags shoved under the tables, the mess of sweet wrappers in front of them, Harry’s dishevelled hair next to Hermione’s new close-crop. Hermione shhh’d the boys as they bundled into the seats opposite, trying to clear the table.
“Yes,” he said. “But that’s not the point.”
to use such a derogatory term for. Michael would undeniably go worst, so she started with him.
“I know,” he said, just as softly. “We all find different parts of this frightening.”
“No worries.”
so much over the last two hours that it was beginning to make his teeth ache.
Hermione spun and pointed at him. “Exactly! You think repressing your emotions and not talking openly about stuff makes you strong, but you’re wrong. It just makes you difficult.”
“That’ll have to be you, I’m afraid,” said Theo, but she didn’t hear Anthony’s reply. She had thrown herself around Susan’s neck and was holding on too tight to move.
“Don’t get weird, ok, Harry?”
Harry giggled.
“Not like that, you know. I just thought you were very cool. Should have known, really.” He took another drink. Behind his head, Anthony caught her eye and mimed rolling a joint. She shot him a surreptitious thumbs up and watched him slip into the kitchen.
“Don’t sweat it, my dear. Our time together was ephemeral, but it only added to it’s beauty. I’m always available for platonic swing dancing, if you need a partner.”
“Dean.” Blaise was there. “You’re scaring Hannah.”
“Hello, all,” said Susan, giving Luna a quick side-hug. “Blaise told my uncle that his mother can only really be suspected of murdering three of her husbands, so we had to leave.”
It was harder than Harry had expected to keep a secret. For one thing, he’d never been entirely secure in his Muffling charms and for another, people suddenly seemed fascinated by his love life. Not just
“Would she?”
“Really? Done by you?”
“Unlikely,” said Anthony. “He’d probably just bedazzle two eyepatches and declare himself pirate king.”
“I don’t - I don’t - “
Dean and Seamus went scrambling towards the cupboard, yanking it open and stopping dead when they saw the assorted huddle.
“All right, then. Fuck off, now.”
“I kind of get that,” said Harry, thinking of – Nope! He refused to think about Draco in the library, or his careful hands stilled on the page of his book. Hands were surprisingly erotic things. Or maybe that was just Draco. Did he have nice hands? Draco had seemed to like them, but maybe that was just when he used them – and that way lay madness. It was the Mirror of Erised all over again. Looking at the thing you wanted, just out of reach.
Or, or he could say something so blindingly stupid that it actually astonished him that he didn’t drop dead on the spot, having used up his last two brain cells coming up with that.
“Pansy smoked it too,” said Harry.
“So he spent the rest of the night running full tilt at the furniture, and Pansy kept pulling it out of the way just in time so he was convinced he’d really passed through. We had to stop when he threw himself at a wall and started screaming.”
“I’ll give it a try.”
“What did he do about the snake tail?” said Blaise, with far too much interest.
“I’m down,” said Hermione.
Blaise stammered. “I just – I didn’t believe in fairy-tales. I thought the world was all nuance and manipulation. My entire life, I’ve ducked away from anything real. All I am is artifice and charm, and I thought that was enough.”
“Why?” said Harry, hot and irrationally angry. “I’m not chicken.”
Draco almost –
“I know.” He smiled, and cupped her cheek. “I can be a man who’s hard to read. But rest assured, I feel exactly the same as you.”
“I’ll help you carry them,” he half-shouted, jumping up and nearly knocking down Morag in the process. Malfoy looked a bit shocked, and he pasted something on his face that he hoped looked like a congenial smile rather than a grimace of impending doom.
“So, Malfoy,” he said, and Blaise sighed. Harry refused to be put off by this. “Is he going to be coming over a lot?”
she didn’t say, but Hermione covered her hand.
Draco had his hands on his knees, bent double like he’d just run a mile. He was shaking. “I asked you.”
“He doesn’t work here,” said the man. “No discount.”
The trick was to act natural. To say something normal. To do anything other than standing there like a deer in the headlights.  He’d talked his way out of trickier situations, he could do this.
It sounded terrible, saying it like that. Ron and her had had sex. It had been nice. Good, in fact, once the first few times were out of the way. She’d wanted to have more – but that was the problem, she’d wanted to have sex with other people. Date other people. The horrible scientist part of her brain had sat up and said
“Yeah. Can’t say I’m surprised – he always did like to party. Mum is furious, of course. Thinks this is going to be the death of our family reputation.”
“We both take Ethics.”
Draco made an angry little noise. “Because this was a terrible idea, Potter. We hate each other, remember?”
“Huh.” Draco shook his head, not in disbelief but more like a dog trying to shake off a fly. “Well. I suppose she knows I can’t bear to hear about the weasel. Thank you, Potter.”
“That’s a rule we both agree should exist – don’t cast Unforgivables?”
“Dibs on Hannah,” said Seamus, grabbing her arm and twirling her as she giggled. “Maybe you can have Morag, Harry.”
“Cheers.”
“We’re not done!” But Seamus was storming away. Dean deflated against a wall.
“Oh yeah,” said Dean, elbowing Seamus. “Absolutely no one in Gryffindor fancied you ever. Isn’t that right, Seamus?”
“Oh that’s how we all survive. I meant with the history of it all.”
Blaise was still talking about the trials of Muggle supermarkets, but all the noise in the world had cut out, because Harry had just seen Draco again. He was over by the drinks table, laughing with Seamus and Terry. Harry strode towards him. He just needed to –
“What is he doing here?”
“We need to talk,” said Hermione, her voice heavy. “Look, Ron – you know that I care about you.”
“Fair enough. But – but yes, it was good. Very good. I didn’t know I could come that much – stop making that face, Harry, you did ask.”
“I mean, really? That’s it?”
“Great,” said Harry, as Hermione muttered “Spectacular” under her breath, stealing a piece of Harry’s bacon. “What are you doing down here?”
“Here,” said a calm and familiar voice, and then there was a cleaning charm slashing through his mouth. He wriggled his tongue, feeling minty fresh.
or they’d stretch a little and it would look like the movement Potter made after getting fucked, and he wouldn’t be able to follow through.
“I hate to ruin this romantic moment,” said Draco, “but I need to go and find Pansy. She’s been… infatuated with Weasley for a long time, and she needs a friend right now.”
“Um,” said Draco. “Yes, you have. Absolutely terrible breeding, Potter. Why don’t you go over how.”
“They keep getting cold,” she said, in a small voice.
“Who the fuck am I going to tell that doesn’t already know.”
“Yes. He always pulls them out at parties. Don’t tell anyone, but he spent most of third year practising them in secret in the boys bathrooms.”
“Still, can’t you just – “ He stopped, and all the anger seemed to leave him. “She gets hexed, every day. Sometimes when she floo-calls me she’s black and blue. Please, you have to – I don’t know, give an interview to the Prophet and say you don’t blame her and you hope she has a nice life?”
“Because it’s Saturday,” he said, “and you’re normally a little more intuitive than this. Not a lot, and the general level of oddness hasn’t changed, but normally you’d be being all perceptive.”
“What, it’s disgusting to like blokes?”
“Sorry,” said Hermione, then hated herself for apologising. “Yeah, it was great. Anyway, if you’d just let me – “ She edged towards the door, but Padma clapped her hands and squealed.
“I’m not being a dick here,” said Harry. “I get that being shitty to you just because you were in Slytherin isn’t fair, but Malfoy and Nott – they were actually involved with Death Eaters, as in the evil terrorist group that tried to kill me. That isn’t ‘let’s put it behind us’ stuff.”
“I’m not drunk,” said Dean. “Fuck. I wish I was drunk.”
Blaise flung his arms wide. “I thought I did!”
Hermione raised her glass. “Yeah, I hear that. I don’t know.”
“I’m sorry,” said Dean.
People had laughed, but nervously.
“I’m sorry,” she said, pushing herself out of Parvati’s arms. “I need air. I think I’m drunk. I think – “ She pushed her way off the dancefloor, through the glittering bodies, until she found a side-exit. The shock of air was like a punch to the stomach. What had she been thinking? What had she nearly done?
“Because his parents cut him off, Harry,” said Parvati, very softly.
Harry tipped his head down and groaned. “I think we had the least friendly sex it is possible to have.”
“Yes,” said Draco. “Talking is good. The Gryffindor’s keep telling me so.”
"What—?" Draco whispers, tracing the letters with one finger. The handwriting looks like Harry's, only shakier, less focused.
Her laughter is infrequent now, punctuated with bored sighs. Her swipes are lazy. She won't keep this up for much longer. "
"Aren't any of you going to pay any attention to
It takes three hours, during which Draco’s legs and hips fall asleep over and over no matter how he sits on the uncomfortable, rocky ground, before Harry finally agrees that Hermione is Hermione. He doesn’t seem to have the same concern for Draco’s identity, presumably because trust was never at stake there.
Hermione nudges Draco. "Thank you for helping him," she says, just quiet enough for her words to run under the boisterous shouts of Harry and Ron. (Shouts which are beginning to garner attention, Draco notices.)
"I knew it. I knew this whole peaceful act was a sham." Blaise sets his tea cup down on the coffee table just firmly enough to underscore his last word. "Draco."
"Oh, do you like my hair, Malfoy?" Potter snickers.
"Don't do that." Malfoy's eyes shine in the wan light cast by the half moon above, and Harry realizes he's leaning over him. The better to see his face, his reactions, he reasons.
"I'm not on my feet." Draco sticks out just the tip of his tongue at Potter's leg, which fills most of his frame of vision.
"They're your family." Draco is flabbergasted. Even at his worst, Draco knew his father had loved him; he knows so many of his father's terrible choices were motivated by that love. Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy would have done anything for their child, and they did.
The front door slams open. Draco had left it ajar, he suddenly realizes, and if that's Harry, he must think there's an intruder. Draco tucks the journal into his cloak without thinking, and shouts, "Harry?" before rushing back into the entryway.
"Malfoy, what have you done?" Potter whispers, eyes wide.
"I know, I know, I started it." Harry takes a pull from his glass and shudders again. "God, this lager. Might as well be drinking cold piss."
"Draco, I really didn't hear anyone," Pansy says from the door of the sitting room, and Draco shushes her instantly—the intruder could make another sound while she so noisily offers her opinion.
