“I hope we can meet again, Malfoy”
Did Harry almost become a ghost along with  Myrtle? Draco broke in two the tiny branch he was holding: Myrtle was sweet and a way way better friend that he ever expected from a ghost that enjoyed stalking boys while they’re having baths, but not a companion for eternity. Does he even deserve such a companion?
When I want you and all your charms
“That was indeed delicious food, Malfoy, happy I came properly hungry to really enjoy it”
Hi all, loooon loong break but life has been insane! I got a Corona puppy and motherhood literally took all my time. I hope you enjoy this small snippet and I truly hope I can be more consistent and fast with my writing!
Proud of his short, but perfectly discussion generating letter, Draco got back under the covers and started slowly singing the song to himself.
But patience was not Draco’s virtue, so he begrudgingly got up from the comfort of his bed and sat at his massive desk.
They’d both look small, hunched over their drinks and carrying the weight of their past on their shoulders. He would refrain from looking into the green eyes, would focus on saying words as eloquently as possible; words such as “You saved...” and “I am...” and a “Sorry” fizzling along with the coke bubbles. And then Harry would laugh and Draco would call him a bloody tosser and try to get up and leave, but thin and strong fingers would keep him there, half turned, half stunned.
“See you very soon, Malfoy, and stay away from Lancelot!” With these words he jumped into the green flames and Draco was left once again angry at his newly found poetic soul.
PS Do you know the Everly brothers?
Hope you’re all having an amazing summer!
I need..
Harry had looked terrified, as if he was ready to gather the spilled blood into his hands and drip it back into Draco. His hair was always such a mess, damn Potter being too much of a hero to use a comb and get a trim.
Once when he was 10, before the letter, before school days, before all the darkness, he cut himself playing with his mini quidditch broom. Just a small cut right under his knee, but it stung and his eyes felt heavy. Whenever he would get hurt or see blood he would suddenly get very sleepy, as if asleep the wound would heal itself and just disappear. Or the world would disappear.
The second worst pain was Harry’s spell in the girls’ bathroom. But that pain was almost soothing; as if along with the blood, the dark ink found its way into the water on the bathroom floor and away from him. He really should’ve died at the hands of The Chosen One. Did that make him also The Boy Who Lived?
“ I beg your pardon? Potter, you offend me in my own house” but there was no malice behind the words, there was no venom, just pure joy and laughter between two old…acquaintances.
It seems that I will be able to update the story each night, hope the muses will stay beside me! Thank you for reading and please do let me know what you think! 🌸
Most of the poems were nothing special; not gag-inducing, not beautiful, just…poetry. But there was a line that he remembered now, that for some odd reason resonated: “Childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies”. Was it true what the Muggle lady wrote?
We are all trying to drown our loneliness, to fill in as many seconds with mindless interactions and activities, knowledge and supposed wisdom. All we do is push to the back of our minds the pure and constant loneliness we all are doomed to feel. Harry won’t save him from being lonely, no one can, but his light would definitely brighten Draco’s life. What can he offer Potter?
The trees were in full bloom, with cherries waiting to pop from their stems and strawberries as big as fists. The pond was calm, save for a couple of excited fish bouncing around joyfully. Sun rays were allowed to penetrate the protection spell cast on the garden and you could actually feel them on your skin. And then dust, so so much dust and destroyed walls and Troy falling in the form of Hogwarts after Voldemort’s wrath.
Someone had taken his hand at some point, and when Draco looked around he saw Narcissa by his side, looking more beautiful and broken than ever. She whispered in his ear “I lied too” and a childish smile appeared on her lips. Not too far, his father had his fall from grace painted darker and darker upon his face.
Right, write a letter asking Potter which day he meant exactly. Or if it’s a surprise and he is not entitled to know? Nonsense, the ministry was involved and they for sure wanted clear dates.
“Of course, and you will find that the Manor has one of the best lunches available” Merlin, Draco, have you gone barmy? Are you selling him your services? Get it together!
“Mister Potter said…he is famished, Sir”
Who could he have a coke with? He’d had one in his youth, during a moist summer in the French seaside, his mother smiling widely at his surprised face when the bubbles hit him. He could definitely have another one with her, but not in the spirit of the poem... It had something bittersweet, some sort of longing and sense of misplacing and misplaced.
Draco raised his eyebrows, ready to go ahead and check the Saviour’s sanity and cognitive abilities, but Harry continued
How will he manage with having Potter for lunch? Would he even keep his promise and visit? I guess with being the chosen one comes the responsibility to always keep your promises. The poor sod.
Days tend to get mushed together so easily, Draco decided. Maybe especially so for people who all they have to do is wait and wait and wait.
And Potter would blush and ask him questions, real, proper questions about his likes and dreams and hopes and books and would listen with his head propped on one hand and his smile everlasting.
The moment the elf let a small pop, Draco was running towards his bedroom to splash some water on his face and pray to Merlin his big mouth will not get him in trouble. Truthfully, he was not scared of Potter’s influence over the Ministry or the whole world; it was actually something closely resembling shame and the deeply rooted desire for the boy to like him, really like him and seek his presence. But Draco will never say these words out loud, they have to stay buried under Potter’s smell of fresh soil and hope.
“I should’ve given it back to your right after Voldemort, I am sorry for that”
Draco tossed and turned in his bed, thought of peaceful sleep replaced by panic. What if it’s the Friday bit so they meet tomorrow??
At this Potter started properly laughing and ask Draco in between chuckles: “Why do you know Muggle poetry?”
“Mr Potter, we are ready to go” a tall man in dark robes sat right in front of them, bearing a stern and almost bored look.
By the time Draco was close to
His grandfather was fond of them and Draco was fond of his grandfather. He smiled to himself. Lucius resembled more the peacocks than he did Abraxas, but what can one do.
“I am half sick of shadows” was what came out of Draco’s mouth and then he was hugging Harry, squeezing as if his dear life was holding on to it as if that was the answer to all the questions he ever asked or will ever ask.
Harry glanced around, trying to fix his eyes on the rose bush on Draco’s left side, but his eyes kept dancing back to the white-haired boy. He was trying to find his words, or maybe to choose them wisely. It seemed that finally the words were arranged properly because he smiled gingerly and opened his mouth to finally say them.
Oh wow, this is my first dialogue scene, so excuse the awkwardness. I am planning to include way more of this in the future and I think it was high time the two of them had a proper scene together!
“Pimky wants to tell Master Malfoy that Mister Potter is waiting in the Drawing Room. Pinkie rubbed her tiny hands together in distress, visibly bothered by the words that were planning to go out of her mouth.
Potter smiled shyly and, even though that mop that Potter called hair was covering them almost entirely, it seemed that his ears were quite a dashing shade of red.
“I will have to go back to the Ministry after lunch, but would you like to meet again maybe this weekend? I can provide lunch this time, even though it won’t be the best one available, I’m sure” he smirked and Draco wanted to punch him; a friendly punch, but still a punch/
The box was almost calling him, so Draco extended gingerly a hand and took the box, touching Harry’s fingers for only a second, making him clear his throat and turn his eyes form the box.
In the Manor’s library, stacked behind old potion books and scholarly texts from the 18th century, he found some muggle poetry books. The library trip had no specific purpose and, as curiosity always beats disgust, Draco started flipping through them. He found himself watching through the eyes of the virgin reader; neither hopeful nor judgemental, just there.
Stay healthy ^_^!
Having a coke with Crabbe would require a dash of fire whiskey; not sure if those two go together but anyhow... Crabbe was never a feelings or even words guy, he would just do what he was told and the rest of the time focus on his trees. For such a simple man, he really had a strong connection with nature. People would praise Longbottom and call him Herbology Hermione, but Crabbe was the real deal. At his family’s village estate, he would check the status of potatoes, converse about how the corn was doing and come up with better ways to keep pests away. He’d prune apple trees and water the strawberries and ask the villagers for updates and advice. And it was all done with his hands, you’d think he was some sort of a Squib; but no, our Vincent just liked touching and healing the soil. His father got tired of beating him up when Crabbe turned 9; he taciturnly accepted his son was not an elegant nobleman and focused more on his brothers and sisters. He was a brute, but also a salt of the earth man. He was a bully, but he was also his best friend.
Malfoy's face hardened. "What life?" he asked, a bitter edge coming into his voice. "This is life, Harry. There was a war and it's still going, and if we don't figure out how to end it, it never will be over."
"Sure, that would be great, actually," Harry said. "I'm too tired to Apparate home and too drunk to want to Floo."
Malfoy's smile was wicked. "I mean that I prefer blow jobs, Potter. Getting them or giving them. Preferably both."
"Not so fast, Potter. I plan to do this right, and for that, we both need to sleep first. You look like a wreck."
Harry took a slow, deep breath and tried not to think of 'wands' in the euphemistic way that Ron liked to. "Well, I ended up picking it because it felt more right than any of the others did. I don't know what that means, if anything. My own wand is best for me, though."
"About two blocks from you," Malfoy said, eyeing stirring his latte as though suspicious of its contents.
"Yes," Potter said adamantly. "It's time they met you properly."
Harry glowered at her. "Remus told you, I presume?"
"Some people I know from the apothecary in Hogsmeade," Malfoy said, shrugging. "Nothing special, and they all just left."
"Where are you going?" Harry asked, stung, but not surprised.
"Hi," Malfoy said, an amused smile stealing across his own face. "Who were you not talking to this time?"
The logic fit. Harry put himself back in his jeans, zipped them, and put the car back in drive. Easing cautiously out onto the highway, he said, "If you ever break up with me, you know I'm going to Obliviate you."
"You ambushed her," Harry went on, not acknowledging him. "You ambushed a lone woman in a dark alley through a tracing charm. It was six to one."
Malfoy was dressed in regular civilian/Muggle garb today, no robes. He fussed at the side seam of his jeans and turned partly toward Harry. "Where we left off. Do you know how I escaped?"
"Bed," Malfoy said. "No. Bathroom. I need to brush my teeth."
"That's ultimately what I'm trying to find out," Malfoy said. "The money is traceable, but no one but the goblins have access to the tracing, and even then, it's very limited and they would never let that kind of info slip or be left lying around or speak about it in a way that we could overhear. I'm trying to backtrack it to the source. If we can figure out who's behind it, I think that will tell us exactly what we need to know to crack this thing. I suspect that Egypt comes into this somehow; after all, all of our money originates there, and so do the goblins who handle it. But that's just a hunch, I don't have any of the finer details."
"Have you… spoken with Dumbledore's portrait lately?" Draco asked, feeling awkward as he still knew so little about how magical portraits actually functioned.
A little before nine, Harry scribbled a short note and persuaded Pig to deliver it (Hedwig was ignoring him balefully from her perch). He'd proposed a meeting place, somewhere Unplottable and sent a Portkey along. Now it was up to Dawson to come through. Shortly before eleven, Malfoy found him in the drawing room. Nothing had been said about his coming, but Harry was nevertheless unsurprised to see him.
The figure took a few steps into the room. "Potter." The voice was caught between amusement and hatred. "I thought you would be dead by now."
Potter hesitated, then leaned over and hugged him. Draco had been half-expecting it, but even so, nothing could have prepared him adequately. He freed his arms and put them around Potter, feeling a decade younger and far less sure of himself than he needed to be. Potter had had all sorts of specialised training during the war. If he had any skill in Legilimency, there was no way he could miss Draco's attraction and - well, whatever else it was - with the physical contact. He was warm and his magic touched Draco's tentatively, and it was electric. Draco felt his body respond, his cock tingling with the awareness of Potter's body, his magic. Potter's palms were hot against his back and Draco didn't know how tightly to hold. He'd never felt so out of control where situations involving physical proximity were involved. Potter shifted closer, his chest pressing into Draco's, and the hug was now officially awkwardly long. Should he end it? He didn't want to be rude or hurt Potter's feelings, but neither did Potter need to get any closer and find out just how much Draco was trying not to enjoy the contact. He was at least half-hard, noticeably so, a fact which he would have to find a way of hiding as soon as Potter let go. Potter turned his face and pressed a cheek into Draco's and it was unbearably intimate. Like a lover, not that he'd ever had one. He'd had people to fuck and little else. Emotion rose up around him like a cloud, and he had to let go now, or else it would choke him and come spilling out and then it would be over with Potter. Draco detached himself, gently but definitely.
the queues this time. I got my Potions mark for the practise
"God, Malfoy," Harry ground out. "Just get on with it!"
Lisette greeted him coolly, as ever. It had been seven years, but apparently she still hadn't forgiven him. The less said about that the better. They exchanged civilities and little else. Scorpius was holding onto his trunk and looking nervous. Draco surveyed him as they stood on the platform and was filled with pride. He looked like exactly right. He had turned out well, despite Draco's lingering guilt over having broken the traditional family model for him at such a young age. But he was well-adjusted, fond of Harry (in his own, private way), a quick study and would be, Draco knew, a devoted student. He was stubborn to a fault, but then, he was a natural Slytherin. It was to be expected. He was far more like Draco than Lisette, which also pleased him.
The finger was pressing against his hole. Potter was massaging it without hesitation of any sort, which was nice. It was a pet peeve of his, fucking blokes who weren't even sure yet whether or not they were squicked by the thought of arse-fucking and the requisite actions that went with it. Potter seemed not only comfortable, but quite happy playing with his arsehole, gently stretching it, his finger dipping in just an inch or so every so often. His preparation was as thoughtful as his kissing, and when he moved away from Draco to reach for a tube, he gave Draco a serious look but said nothing at all.
Harry nodded again, digesting this. Abruptly, his gaze snapped back to Malfoy's. "Apology accepted," he said, and held out his hand. "And you don't owe me anything."
Potter gazed at him, looking very much as though he was deliberately filtering things out of his speech. "All right, then," he said offhandedly. "I'll come, then. I wanted tickets, but they were all sold out. And sometimes I work evenings - " He stopped, catching himself.
"Your ancestry. Same thing. Your performance. You have a lot of pride, Malfoy. Possibly too much. Arrogance is only arrogance when it outweighs the amount of talent supporting it. Luckily, you're very talented. But talent alone, and we cannot stress this highly enough, will not get you where you're going." The brown eye joined the blue, looking up from the notepad to Draco's face. "You're not arrogant, but it comes close to the line sometimes. Granted, it's justified. You're one of the best wizards your age around."
"Wait. Listen. You're not just rushing in there without knowing what you're doing. We need a plan. I need to know what you're going to do if you go to find him." Malfoy's eyes bore into his, very light and stern in the reflected streetlight from outside.
Harry ate and inhaled the scents on the air around himself. Suddenly, he hardly cared about the attack, or Voldemort, or that he was here with Malfoy - it was exciting. Cars and very small trucks were driving down the road amidst the thronging pedestrian traffic, but they were going very slowly. Harry occasionally pulled his feet in to avoid having his toes run over, but there was no real danger. There were people of varying levels of dress, children in school uniforms, and even the occasional donkey. It was the most interesting thing he'd ever seen.
The whiskey was warming him from the inside. "No," Harry said. "Never." He eyed Malfoy, whose gaze was frank and dangerously inviting over the rim of his glass. "If you're thinking what I think you're thinking, don't think it. We have to work together. We can't just - "
"You always say that."
"Of course not. What kind of amateur do you take me for?" Harry gave him both items and looked around for the remote control.
"To whom were they reporting," Malfoy said from across the room.
"Yeah."
Harry's head was reeling. "What?" he said again. "Malfoy, that's not - that - I didn't mean it like that! Pansy came and told me not to pursue you because you were definitely not interested and wanted to be left alone! And if you really were interested, how was I supposed to know, from how you've been since we got here?"
"I'll try it. Thanks."
Harry put the wand on a grimy coffee table and gingerly edged over to Malfoy, wishing that Malfoy hadn't seen him fall on his face. "Why don't you have the curtains closed?"
As Potter didn't know he was an Auror candidate, he wouldn't know that Draco had been invited. Draco thought quickly. "I ran into someone and got invited," he fibbed. "If I have a date, it's - well." He stopped, still unsure as to what he wanted to say about that. It wasn't that he wanted to go as Potter's date. He just didn't want Potter taking anyone else, sham or not. "I don't have a date and don't plan to find one," he said, choosing his words with care.
"Not a bad first time?"
"Maybe. She seemed pretty nervous," Kingsley said. "I just happened to be lucky; she was in line in front of me at that Caffè Nero near the Ministry. I don't know if she'd talk at the offices."
The passage to the dining room had once served as a secret passageway and was long and winding. Harry was accustomed to it, as most of them found their way to the dining room at least once per day, but it startled him when someone stepped out of the shadows and into his path. The glimmer of Malfoy's hair was all but hidden in the dark. "Potter."
His annoyance grew. "Don't what?"
"These ones won't," Malfoy said, adding under his breath, "… twenty-nine…" He pointed with his chin across the room. "All the ones that splash are separated. A couple have shielding charms around them, too, but with some, you can't do that or it… thirty-seven… throws the potion off."
"And tricked me into this sooner," Harry said stiffly, feeling as though he had been manipulated.
Draco swallowed hard. "All of it?" His voice was not quite steady.
"I'm not sure. I just woke up."
"It wasn't exactly a huge surprise," Neville said dryly. "Pass the sausages, Ron."
"Or both," Harry agreed. "I was just about to say something about that."
Malfoy replaced a glass jar of some sort of sauce on the shelf and saw him. His bored expression lightened. "Potter," he said.
Draco lifted his brows. "What'll it be, then?"
Concentration was important. But it was a damned good thing there were no other cars out there with them. Draco's fingers found their way into his jeans, lifting out his balls and squeezing. The car jerked; Harry righted it and renewed his grip on the wheel.
Malfoy nodded at his cup. "Drink your tea," he said. "I just have to stir something here."
"Why?"
"Malfoy." Potter was curt.
"Weasley?" Malfoy inquired.
"You did?" Harry said, surprised. "Why?"
Harry took a deep breath. "Look," he said. "Have you thought about maybe seeing a counsellor, or maybe someone about the drinking?"
"Oh?" Potter's colour began to fade back to normal. "What did he say?"
"Well, you can believe whatever you want," Harry said angrily, "but it happens to be true. I didn't know before… recently."
* * *
"Oh." Impressed again despite himself, Harry fell silent and followed Malfoy meekly out of the room.
Draco's fingers crept onto Harry's thigh instead. "You didn't answer me."
Harry found it and looked away as Malfoy cast the spells. He wasn't sure why, but it seemed only decent to give Malfoy a bit of privacy. "Okay?"
"No, baklawa," Draco corrected him, smiling. "Syria, not Greece. It's more or less the same thing, though. I think they make it with rosewater and pistachios here. Shall I ask?"
Malfoy suddenly looked up at him. "Just keep yourself alive, okay? I don't think I could handle it if you didn't."
"I guess so," Hermione said, biting her lip.
Nothing. His eyes met Malfoy's, and neither of them said anything. Malfoy took the wand back and looked at it. His chest rose and fell heavily. Obviously struggling to keep his voice level, he said, "I guess it doesn't work any more."
"I don't think he's come out officially. I mean, who would he tell? But I have good reason to think he is," Tonks said. "I just thought that maybe if you'd got him talking, he might have let it slip."
"Wouldn't you like to know."
"I know." Harry privately agreed. The suspense was terrible. This new development seemed to clench it; they had not, as Harry had been dimly hoping, merely landed in a little-known safe house somewhere. This was indeed a Death Eater trap. It was difficult to avoid that conclusion now. The only question was when they would come. How long it would last. Harry closed his eyes.
Draco waited, watching Shacklebolt look groggily around his magical cage. He chuckled. "Very impressive, Malfoy."
He woke around dawn because an owl was tapping at the window of his bedroom. As he moved, Malfoy stretched beside him, shaking Harry into the present. Right. Malfoy. He thought of what had happened and wanted to smile, but the owl was distracting him. Harry sat up and inched to the end of the bed, as Malfoy was between him and the side. Naked, he went to the window, shivering, arms hugging his sides. It was Hedwig. Harry pried open the ancient window and let her in, noting dimly once again how many human magical forms owl magic could sidestep. The wards should have prevented anyone from entering or even seeing the house without first knowing its precise location, but the owls came and went freely. Harry broke the seal and ignored Hedwig's impatient peck at his hand. His vision was blurry without his glasses and he was still half asleep and he shook her off.
Harry flushed under Malfoy's scorn, but did his best to let the same expression form on his own face. "Is there more than one bed?"
He had no choice but to do so.
"What, Potter?" Malfoy sounded both cold and irritated. "What do you want?"
"Stop," Harry said instinctively. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pried."
Harry thought about Malfoy planning this, putting the jinx on the ink and waiting for Harry's responses, and something seemed to click in his head. He shuffled closer to Malfoy.
"Back corner," Harry contradicted, still unable to look him in the eye. "I just - I - "
"Yes. Sort of. I wasn't sure."
"I want you to fuck me," Draco said distinctly, and his cock gave a noticeable throb, knocking gently into Harry's wrist.
She smiled around it and left it exactly as it was. "You're as bad as Draco. And speaking of Draco, just don't."
"How what?" Harry demanded.
"He and Dumbledore made the choices for me," Potter said quietly. "At least, all the choices that led me to the big one. Who knows what I would have done in anyone else's place? Or what you would have done in mine?"
* * *
It was more fun than he could have imagined, torturing Potter like this, but he had nothing to hide and Potter did. He came over, though, peering over Draco's shoulder with feigned reluctance. He was just in time to see the brunet penetrate the blond, both of them moaning. The blond's back arched, looking seductively back over his shoulder, and Draco's pulse raced. It could have been him and Potter, and he could feel Potter thinking the same thing. "Didn't know you were," Potter mumbled from just behind him.
"Good thing you did." Malfoy's gaze was sober.
"She would never have just phrased it that way," Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. "She's a Slytherin, Potter. Give her some credit for subtlety."
He looked afraid.
Auror
The two older men exchanged a look. "There are a few things we need to talk about," Shacklebolt said. "As you know, I am the Auror responsible for overseeing this section of your qualification, but I do it with information and observations that my colleagues in the Department gather throughout the training process. For the past three years, as you know, a record of personal information has been kept on each one of the trainees. Specific, detailed information. The way you move your head when being given information. The direction your eyes shift at certain points of a conversation. Exactly which muscles in your face tense when you're attacking an opponent for a training exercise. All of these little things are fair game. We analyse them. We discuss them. And finally, at the end, we share our findings with you and discuss them together. The reason we save the character testing for the end is that in many ways, it is the hardest level of the training. To become an Auror takes more personal integrity, as well as your many considerable skills, and it takes in turn a great deal of willingness to be fully honest with yourself about yourself."
Draco Malfoy's face was pale with fury. "Potter - finite!"
Potter laughed. "I saw you two come in, actually. I just assumed you were dating. I didn't mean to - "
On the third night after Palmyra, which was beginning to be Harry's way of counting the days, they talked again. They were leaning against a high bit of wall, looking down on the houses below in their convoluted courtyards. Somewhere beneath them, a fountain was trickling. There were wild roses and the ubiquitous jasmine blooming everywhere and the air was heavy with their scent.
"I said never mind. God, Harry."
"I'm not sure if he's drunk or just pissed off about something, but he was throwing things around in his office, and I heard something explode… I tried to knock, but the door was warded weirdly and it just gave me shocks. I don't even think he could hear me, and I couldn't disable his ward." Tonks sounded frustrated. "I don't want to report him, but it's Saturday night and he's all alone in there. I'm worried he'll hurt himself, or damage Ministry property and get into trouble."
Potter took a long look at him, mouth reddened and glistening with saliva and come, desire stamped all over his face. "Yes," he said. "Exactly like that." He could move like lightning when he wanted to, and before Draco knew it, he felt the head of Potter's luscious cock nudging his entrance, followed shortly by the rest of it. It was long and thick and filled him completely, aching in the best of ways. He looked up into Potter's intense face and allowed to himself once again exactly how long he had dreamed of this. Having Potter's face above him had been a small, private dream since at least third year. Until now, he'd only ever seen it there in situations he preferred not to remember. But this, on the other hand, was wholly unforgettable, Potter moaning and lifting his hips to slowly drive into him again and again. It was easily the most erotic thing that Draco had ever experienced. His cock, though quite spent, had not softened entirely, and was already showing signs of new life during these thoughts. Potter's lower belly brushed it occasionally, even as his cock was finding the right angles and places within Draco. This was a one-time incident, Draco was certain, but the breathless possibility of having this every day whisked through his brain like fire and he knew that he would never be able to stop wanting it now that it had occurred to him.
"Really," Harry said, considering this. "So whoever moved it has to be familiar enough with the Muggle world to know about their bank accounts and such. Although that wouldn't be hard to learn. What bank?"
Why was that somehow disappointing? Harry negated the thought immediately. "Okay," he said.
* * *
"A Misapparition, I think." A pause. "We were both at Point Q. Do you remember being there?"
"I doubt that."
"Shut up." Malfoy cut him off with his mouth, and Harry was embarrassed that he didn't even try to resist. His hands went to Malfoy's waist and he let himself be brought closer, wanting more of the addictive warmth of Malfoy's mouth and hands. They kissed until it started getting too involved for a brief public kiss on the sidewalk, even if it was night. Malfoy broke it off first this time. "Apparate," he ordered, still holding Harry.
"I don't know. It's too early. Too soon. I don't want something like, not now." Harry felt the usual pinprick of guilt and ignored it resolutely. "I'm too young. I'm not ready for all of that."
"What about Ginny?" There was no judgement in the question, just curiosity.
He was insatiable. Harry stifled a yawn and pushed again. Maybe some things could be done magically after all…
He stayed for nearly the entire night, making good on some of his promises then and there, and while he knew that a host of complications lay ahead, at that moment, he could not believe that it would not work out somehow. Finally, close to four in the morning, Harry slipped through the front door of his house and crawled under the blankets on the sofa, sated, very sleepy, and very happy.
"The Dark Lord's reign did not extend that far back," Draco said mildly. "You should brush up on your history."
"Or of earls," Harry said.
Current legal status: Not charged; file to be closed
"But he could have received the new Mark." Harry waited for Malfoy's opinion of this.
"Hi," Potter said, sounding relieved and worried at the same time. "You're okay?"
"I guess we should." Harry looked over at Malfoy and found him watching the two of them. Their eyes met and Malfoy's were ever-so-slightly concerned. Harry went to him. "Time to sit down, I think," he said, tense.
A small pop a few meters away made him jump. Potter emerged from the alley beside the Ministry building and spotted him at once. "Hi," he said.
His thoughts kept him awake. He could feel Malfoy's mouth on his, his hands, over and over again, and kept playing the scene again in his head. Why, why had Malfoy left? Just when he'd thought things were actually going to unfold the way they should, this had to happen. Was Malfoy regretting it? He didn't understand what was going on.
Embarrassment and anger swept through Harry like a wave. He shot to his feet and went over to the sliding glass doors. The wards shimmered, barely visible, against the door and prevented anyone from seeing him there. Harry didn't care anyway; he just needed a minute to collect himself. Malfoy had been following him for a year. He'd… seen everything. The clubs. His dates, for fuck's sake. "You get off on following me to the clubs?" he mumbled to the glass.
Harry pulled himself into a sitting position. Malfoy watched him warily. Harry rubbed his forehead and grimaced. "How long have I been out of it?"
Harry glanced instinctively at the doorway, but there was no sign of Ron yet. "But…"
"Just shut up and do it," Malfoy groaned. "I'm sorry I said that. Just fuck me, please!"
It was obvious, the thing to do or say. It would be so easy. They were already in bed together. And he wanted it. Strange that it had never occurred to him before, but Harry was quite certain that he did. Without meaning to, he turned his head toward Malfoy. "Malfoy…"
"Who are you here with?" Harry asked, letting his shoulders hunch forward, cradling his beer with both hands.
Malfoy shook his head, refusing to listen, his hands touching Harry's firm abdomen through his t-shirt, sliding over the bony jut of his hips. Harry watched his fingers slip the button out of his jeans, his cock waiting inside as though it had known this was going to happen all along. With one hand, Malfoy took the bag of groceries from his hand and set it beside his on the pavement, the other rubbing gently. Harry heard his breath hiss between his teeth, shuddered as the cool air moved against his cock as Malfoy exposed it to the evening. Malfoy glanced at him once before swiftly dropping to his knees and touching his mouth to it. To his cock. Harry felt tremors of anticipation run through his entire frame.
Harry didn't glare back. "Look, you gave me some of your stuff. Do you want something? I have all the usual stuff. You might as well use it if it's here."
He was surprised to discover that his throat was a little constricted as Scorpius let go and turned to Lisette. She fussed some more and told him to write, getting a muffled promise. He came away and Draco gave him a smile that he wasn't feeling. "Go on, then," he said.
Malfoy closed his eyes for a moment as though praying for patience. When he opened them, he said through gritted teeth, "I said, would you like an egg."
She moved over to him, putting a slim arm over his torso beneath the blankets. "Let's fuck," she said, her voice half attempting to be seductive and half pleading.
"No mole. I set up that info feed myself."
"I promised," Harry said. "And I'm very sure." He took Malfoy's cock with one hand and put the tip of it in his mouth. Malfoy was extremely good at giving head himself, and Harry had been paying attention. Malfoy gasped when Harry began to suck, and flung his head back against the wall. Pleased, Harry worked more of it into his mouth and moved one hand to Malfoy's balls, just holding at first, then tugging lightly. Salty fluid leaked into Harry's mouth and Malfoy moaned something vaguely encouraging. Harry began to move his mouth back and forth over Malfoy's cock, feeling only a little self-conscious. He understood it now, why people wanted to do this for each other. It was so intimate. On the receiving end, Harry knew that it felt more intimate than some things because there was something particularly special about having all of the focus on just himself. Even if Malfoy got himself off while he did it, he was lavishing so much attention on Harry's pleasure, on finding out which specific little places and touches made him groan, what movement of tongue or lips. And giving it back was equally intimate. This was the reason he couldn't do it for Ginny: he had never been willing to be that intimate with her. Malfoy's most sensitive skin was inside his mouth, trustingly, despite whatever public face Malfoy wore most days. And when he came, Harry knew, there would be a moment of piercing closeness between them that he had never experienced with anyone else, could not have experienced with anyone else. Several minutes later, this moment arrived, preceded by a loud sound and a rush of hot fluid in Harry's mouth. He choked but didn't cough and managed to swallow a lot of it, at least. It didn't even taste as bad as he had feared, but that seemed irrelevant now, anyway.
Tonks eyed him sharply. "Where are you going with this?"
"Or Tonks," Malfoy said. "She can go as a courier boy or something."
"Don't lose the key," Dumbledore advised. "Now, turn and face your anxious audience."
The sunlight on his face woke him several hours later, and Harry knew instantly that he was not at home. His eyes opened. He was in Malfoy's bed. Malfoy was still there with him, sleeping soundly. Harry looked at him for a long time, and felt no regret about his decision. But in the light of what must be late morning or even early afternoon by now, he knew there were things that had to happen before anything else happened with Malfoy. He got quietly out of bed and dressed himself. He went into the main room and looked for some parchment. There was a small stack of it on the corner of the table. Harry noticed a book opened to a recipe for a potion he'd never heard of and a cup of coffee nearby. Malfoy must have been trying to keep himself awake the previous night, Harry thought. He found a quill and wrote a short note.
Draco could only stare back at him, dismay creeping over his face. He wanted to say something about having been Sorted into the wrong house for this job (no wonder so few Slytherins had ever been Headmaster before), but he couldn't. It was too serious. And Potter was seconds away from losing every ounce of respect he might have grudgingly gained for him, if he hadn't already.
Potter stopped laughing and kissed him again, a long, slow kiss with a lot of tongue and fingers in his hair, and it was precisely what he wanted. After, Potter opened his eyes. "Dare I ask if you have somewhere to be tomorrow morning?"
"Sounds like a fabulous marriage," Draco said dryly.
"I guess I'm due for some chores." He put his cards down. "Finish this later?"
"I know that," Harry said, anger colouring his voice. He turned and moved around Malfoy without looking at him, going to the Pensieve. He withdrew Malfoy's memories and siphoned them back into the jar. "Here." He screwed the lid on and thrust it back at Malfoy. "Take them." He didn't watch as Malfoy lifted the wispy mass out with his wand, carefully tipping it back into his temple.
"Good luck." Kingsley disconnected.
"Oh, nothing, just two headstrong Gryffindors, you know," Harry had said in a bad attempt at levity when his middle child had brought it up, with a forced grin that felt more like a grimace. "It'll be okay soon enough. Don't worry."
Harry's eyes were adjusting to the dark and his adrenaline had already kicked in. "Malfoy, what the fuck is going on?" he whispered, equally furious.
"You should have," Harry repeated, staring at him.
"I think you should pick," Harry said firmly, putting down the newspaper.
* * *
"I said my bit," Harry countered. "I'm sure you heard that, too."
"I said fine."
"Yes," Harry said, feeling his brow crease. "I have no idea what that was about. The 'little empress'?"
"Hi," Potter said, standing up hurriedly. "Let me get you something."
It was almost a scratching sound, but it wasn't a sound as much as it was a feeling against his mind - so subtle as to drive a person mad, Harry thought. He reached out to it within his head, across the dark of the room to the far side, reaching out with his magical sensibilities, and - there. On the opposite side of the room. His fingers found Malfoy's bony wrist and gripped it hard. "There's a Death Eater there," he said softly, nodding toward the place without taking his eyes off it.
"I wasn't just going to leave you here," Harry said, trying not to roll his eyes.
Oops. Overreacting, possibly. Potter had the nerve to look like he was fighting laughter. Or anger. He couldn't really tell, but it had better be anger. He couldn't deal with Potter laughing at him. Potter's mouth twitched. "Look, I apologised," he said. "What do you want me to do? Do you need a Healer or something? An ice pack?"
"I think you're just putting me off."
"You're late," Ginny said, by way of a greeting.
"Really." Malfoy's brows shot upward again. "I hate to disappoint you, Potter, but that's not an improvement."
"So he is, then?"
Potter caught his gaze and glanced away as though ashamed of himself, or just uncomfortable. "Tea?"
"You knew them?"
Harry sighed and looked somewhere else. "I kept seeing him here and there, after that. I don't know. I can't really explain it, Hermione. It barely makes sense to me. All I know is that I definitely have feelings for him that I can't ignore - and believe me, I've tried - and I don't know what to do now."
Harry tried for a laugh. "Oh, sure, that's me. Harry 'Nerves of Steel' Potter."
"Whichever." Malfoy stripped off his steam-stained work robes, sat down behind his desk opposite Harry and leaned back, hands behind his head. "Notice anything, Potter?"
It was crowded, but he shouldered his way in and managed to make himself heard, asking for another pint. The pitchers on the tables were empty, but Harry had not had all that much. Ginny's influence, partly. That, and he'd got over the phase of getting drunk enough that he spent half the night with his face in a toilet. Ron hadn't, but that was Ron. He handed over some cash and turned to extricate himself from the mangle at the bar, only to find himself face to face with Malfoy.
"When else am I supposed to bring it up?" Harry drank his cold tea and poured himself some more. "It's going to come up either way."
Malfoy took his time answering, putting everything back into the pouch except for a small case of some sort. Finally, he said, "Fine, then, give me some of whatever you put on your forehead."
Malfoy gave him a quick smile. "Rather, yes." Then, "We turn here, it's just around the corner."
"I'm sorry," Harry repeated. "I don't know what else to say. I'd make it up to you, if I could."
One of the things Harry had always liked about her was her refusal to use silly euphemisms, but this time, it made him wince. If she'd phrased it some other way, it wouldn't have sounded so… plain. Like that was all it was. And he knew already that he couldn't. "I'm sorry," he mumbled, squeezing his eyes shut. "Not tonight. I'm not… I'm sorry."
His fingers were slipping on the fineness of Draco's hair, but the grip was unhesitating. His mouth was strong, but Potter seemed uncertain whether he was supposed to be dominating the kiss or to take his cues from Draco, so the power play shifted back and forth between them. It was a new sensation for Draco; he was more accustomed to leading his partners into seducing him (a seduction in and of itself) and then letting them take the lead. He sensed Potter's natural dominance, but the uncertainty made itself known in every touch, despite what was clearly raw desire for it. It went on for quite awhile, Potter's hands pushing awkwardly at his clothing, their hips colliding, and Draco wondered if he'd ever done anything beyond this with another man. Potter broke off, breathing heavily, his pupils dilated so much that it was visible even in the alley. Draco stared back, aware that his own breaths were echoing around them. Would decency require that he stop before Potter got himself into even more trouble?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A server was approaching, a young man in his twenties with a harried expression. Harry would have thought him a university student with a part-time after school job if he didn't vaguely recognise the boy from around the Ministry. Must be a trainee in one of the programs, Harry surmised, and the server's instantly worshipful manner confirmed that he was no Muggle. "Take your order, sir?"
He held out the papers for Harry to look at. Harry took them but laid them on the desk in front of him. He wouldn't understand it anyway, and something else had just occurred to him. "Wait. Let me get this straight. There's a transfer from one account that happens four times a year. There are four accounts that each transfer money to the same account three times a year, but at different times. Then there's another one that transfers money twice a year. Is that right?"
After what seemed like a short eternity, Malfoy broke away and said, "If you're just fucking with me, I'll never forgive you. Just so you know."
Albus looked at their hands, then smiled. "Yeah," he said. "I definitely am."
After a bit, the world resolved itself into normalcy again and Draco attempted to get himself off Potter's shoulder. How unseemly. Potter seemed dazed, but gave him a smile that was half self-satisfied and half turning shy. He appeared uncertain as to what to say. Draco found that he had no idea, either. He hated being nervous. Why should he be nervous around Potter? It made him sound stiff.
"Just don't say anything at all," Malfoy advised unhelpfully. "I'll do the talking."
"Maybe you'll be able to kill Voldemort if you get a new one," Malfoy said quietly.
Harry waited. "Are you okay?"
Malfoy came over, glancing at Dolohov, who appeared to be unconscious. He went to the door of the cramped tenement and held it open for Harry. When they were outside in the cool afternoon air, he did a quick check around them. "It's over," he said.
Mutely, Harry nodded.
"You went all tense. What's up?"
"You're home early," she said.
Malfoy nodded, eyes still closed. "Right. Well, you know where to find me."
Dolohov could only look at Harry in speechless misery as Harry continued to loom over him, wand twisting at his temple. "I won't say anything!" he tried, squirming away from the wand tip, desperate. "I promise! I will take an oath - "
"Hello." Malfoy was sitting in the corner of his bed, balancing a paperback novel on his knees.
"Okay," Harry said. He was exhausted, both physically and emotionally, and he agreed.
"I told you I did." Harry moved past him, down the hall to the living room and looked around. "Have you got a DVD player?"
"Hello, Malfoy," Longbottom said, a little warily.
There was no answer; Malfoy was deep in thought. Harry read through the assignment thoroughly. It read:
The floor creaked behind him. He could sense Malfoy there in the doorway, his eyes watching him appraisingly. "That bad?" Malfoy said quietly. It wasn't really a question.
Harry stared at the opposite wall. "I think maybe we should, sometime."
The ink looked wet, but stayed put. Harry hesitated for a moment, pondering erasing both lines, but then changed his mind and recklessly decided to leave them where they were. Whistling, he exited the bathroom and returned to his paperwork feeling decidedly more interested in the day.
He delivered this without malice, though the words were still barely intelligible. Harry began to lose patience. "Come on, Malfoy. Talk to me. What happened?"
"It's very pretty," Malfoy said, smirking. He held out his palm. "Go."
I hope his dad doesn't get mad. Do you think he would?
It had taken him years of Harry's encouragement to stop calling him Mr Potter. Draco thought of his own first day at school and pushed the thought away again. "Not in the slightest," he said. He hesitated again, but decided to tell him anyway. "I wanted to be," he said honestly. "But I made some bad choices in the beginning." It was not something that he had ever said aloud to anyone else, not ever. Fatherhood had interesting effects on a person, as did goodbyes.
He was being pushed onto his back, Malfoy sliding down him, long blond hair trailing down his chest, over his belly, then tickling a little. Malfoy gently freed Harry's balls from the confines of his undergarments, studied them for a moment, then lowered his mouth to Harry's cock. Harry gasped at the first contact. It had been too long since he'd got this, and it was immediately clear that Malfoy was no novice at it. He filled his mouth with cock as though hungry for nothing else but that, both hands stroking and cupping and tugging and rubbing Harry's thighs and chest and all the sensation was almost overwhelming. Harry could hardly breathe; Malfoy's mouth was hot and his tongue strong and wet and slick, and he was bucking up from the sofa to get more of it, his cock straining toward Malfoy's throat. Malfoy had been wearing lipstick and it was going to get on his cock, he thought, and the thought turned him on even more. Malfoy shifted then so that one of Harry's legs was resting firmly between his thighs. And the glamour he'd wondered most about was in place there, too. Malfoy was fully female, at least at this very minute. Just as he was getting close, Malfoy suddenly pulled away, looking up at him, his expression intense. "Noticed that, did you?"
"I basically am Bond," Malfoy agreed.
Pansy smirked. "Not personal experience, if that's what you're trying to ask, Potter. God, you have no subtlety whatsoever." She eyed him, the smirk lingering along with the smoke. "I've heard stories, that's all."
"Oh, I would agree with that, Freudian or not," Malfoy said dryly. "From all that I've heard about your mother, I'm surprised she hasn't been canonised yet."
Malfoy lifted an eyebrow. "Really," he said.
Harry stared down at his parchment page. "Who were they reporting to?"
A pause, then a slight sigh - designed, he knew, to be audible. "All right, then."
And so it went. There was one little place, a tiny bit of garden tucked away in a little courtyard surrounded by darkened windows, where Draco pulled him down to a bench and let the mood overtake them. They kissed and murmured and kissed some more for a few, fleetingly wonderful moments, and then Draco stood and said they should go, his fingers still entwined with Harry's. He tried to pull them away, though not very hard, and Harry hung on. Draco gave in and they walked back through the twisting, darkened streets of the Old City like that, past the corn vendors and children running over the dusty cobblestones, their voice echoing in the tall streets. Draco leaned against him now and then, and Harry was struck by how very vulnerable he actually seemed. And by how deeply his feelings seemed to run. Harry was still very aware that it had been only days, but he was dizzy with the excitement of it. He tightened his loose grip on Draco's fingers and squeezed.
Harry, to his humiliation, felt his cheeks flush again and hoped it wasn't obvious. "No! About your war record."
Harry closed the door behind him.
"Your assignment," Potter hissed, eyes narrowed in fury.
Harry ignored this. "How was your day?"
Harry shrugged. "It didn't feel right."
"What?"
Even the one where Draco gritted his teeth and said that he loved him.
Draco actually seemed to be cheered by this. "Maybe," he said. "Do you feel like having dessert?"
"I knocked," Draco offered.
Malfoy definitely sounded like he fully expected Harry to slap him down at any moment, and Harry was tempted to. Instead, he found himself answering. "He… we broke up, if that wasn't obvious," he said slowly.
"Sorry," Harry said. "Got held up."
Draco took care to keep his tone casual. "I don't have plans to go with anyone else so far."
"It's been a busy week," Harry said.
Harry searched for the sting, the maliciousness, then had to remind himself that Malfoy had been civil since about the start of the war already. He couldn't help it; he just expected it. "No," he said shortly, not wanting to discuss it. "I, erm, have to get…" he gestured toward the cubicles, trailing off.
"East end," Malfoy said. "At least, that's where he used to hang out. We'll see. I have a few old partial traces in the area. We'll find him. You ready?"
"What did he do?"
He could feel her hurt radiating out like some sort of reproachful sun. Then she said, "You've had a long week or two, with the trial. You're tired."
Lupin shrugged, smiling. "Thought you might, that's all."
Draco allowed himself to look a little smug. "I must say, I always wondered."
For the rest of the week, Malfoy tried out a variety of guises, all of which featured him as a larger man than he was, sometimes ridiculously so. The day he came downstairs as a morbidly obese man about Harry's own height, barely fitting through the door, Harry had lost it, laughing himself sick right there on the sidewalk. It wasn't that obese people were so funny, but the idea of Draco Malfoy as one was, somehow. He couldn't have explained it. Malfoy had tried to feign anger over Harry's uncontrollable laughter, but finally cracked and admitted that it had been a joke and that he had another disguise planned. That time, he had let Harry come upstairs while he changed the glamours and his clothing, emerging this time as an elderly man bent over a cane. He'd made Harry Polyjuice himself that time, with the hair of what must have been a very elderly man; Harry had not had to pretend to stoop. He hadn't had to pretend that he didn't need to locate a loo every thirty minutes, either, a feature which proved extremely inconvenient, as Malfoy's activity of the day involving going out for breakfast and then to a park to feed pigeons from a bench. Harry had been forced to shuffle into the bushes to relieve himself several times, to Malfoy's wheezing laughter.
Malfoy tensed a little. "What?"
"He is," Potter assured him. "There are Death Eaters loose in the castle's portraits, as you know, and your father is going to be attempting to find his way into the portrait plane to… deal with them."
Of course Draco had not known that. Potter didn't seem to expect a response, but shifted his weight to his left arm so that he could reach between them to touch Draco again. To Draco's own surprise, his cock responded, firming up rather quickly despite its recent adventures in Potter's mouth. Potter didn't seem to be in a hurry. He had set a moderate, almost luxurious pace of fucking and it was beginning to procure some rather lovely sensation. Draco vowed to never admit just how much he loved this, how fucking happy he was right at that minute. He was lying beneath Potter with his long, hard cock inside him and it was amazing. He could do this for hours, but Potter made a small sound, the pace of his breath quickening, and Draco knew it wasn't going to last quite as long as that. Potter took his hand off Draco's cock for a moment but brought it back slick with lube, which only served to heighten Draco's renewed arousal. He had never been able to get it up again so quickly, but it just went to prove that when it came to Potter, no rule was sacred. Potter's thrusts were getting faster. Draco's hands were on his arse, pulling the cheeks apart as they fucked, and now he put a finger in his mouth and stuck the first two joints of it into Potter, as far as he could reach. Potter cursed and drove into him with such force that Draco thought he was being split in two, and he loved it. Potter threw his head back and gave a hoarse shout, coming hard, his arse pushing back on Draco's finger only to stab forward again, coming in spatters within Draco. Every muscle in his body clenched, including the hand on Draco's cock and that squeeze nudged him back over the precipice for a second, exhilarating rush of lights exploding and a hot splash on his belly and Potter's chest.
Harry recalled that this had already come up. "I suppose I should contact her," he said. Malfoy spoke to the clerk and arranged it, nodding at Harry, and Harry signed on. His inbox was loaded with new messages, all from Hermione. Harry chose the most recent one (after reading the rest) and responded very briefly. "Okay, let's go."
Malfoy came to stand in the doorway. He was breathing hard, his hair tangled and dirty, and there was a smear of blood on his cheek. "I have some, so stop grousing." He reached under his cloak to unbuckle a flat pouch strapped to his torso. Reaching into it, he pulled out a tiny vial of clear liquid. "Here. Just a drop or two. It stops the pain now and the itching later, which I consider a bonus, personally."
"Try."
"Yeah, fine," Harry said. He inadvertently let his gaze flick south, only to see that Malfoy, too, was sporting some morning wood. He hastily looked away. "Um, I borrowed a towel and used your shower. Obviously. Hope that's okay?"
"Do you - do you think this is just normal thunder?"
Harry grinned. "Didn't seem to take you too long earlier."
* * *
Malfoy smiled wryly. "Scorpius was curious," he said, deliberately vague.
"Oh, but you got off with me, didn't you, and I'll bet that annoys you more than anything else," Harry shot back, annoyance colouring his entire mood. The aftermath was ruined.
"Draco… " Harry trailed off. "Yeah, I'm sure. Why are we talking about this now?"
Malfoy's brows flicked up in quickly-disguised surprise at Harry's understanding. "Yes. Exactly. One more number in either direction would give the sequence enough power to have this kind of effect on the Ministry's holdings. And if this one last deposit happens, it would have to happen this month sometime to fit the pattern, and close it off. Around seven o'clock, to jive with the other figures in the tertiary level of the spell. Whatever these people are working on would culminate at that point, and it would be magically irreversible."
"Funny as hell, though," Malfoy said, and Harry glimpsed his white teeth in the dark of the room.
Draco cleaned himself and did up his trousers. He turned to face Potter. "Give me some credit," he said. "Your son and daughter are students here, as is my son. I have no intention of exposing you, if that's what you're worried about."
"Yes, Potter?"
A glint of gold caught his eye and Malfoy's attention. Ginny was passing the goblins gold, several Galleons' worth. She looked about the age she had been when she had died, the same as in the café. Was this real, Harry wondered. Had he really never noticed this happening?
Harry paused, the paper espresso cup an inch from his lips. "What book?"
"You're welcome," Malfoy said neutrally. "There's water there, if you're thirsty."
The bolt on the door slid open and Malfoy slipped inside the stall like a shadow.
He got a small smile in return. "In small doses, Harry."
Draco glanced at Moody. "I thought…"
Malfoy shifted his weight and silently held out the wand.
"Was - was it okay for you?" Potter asked, looking for a moment as though he were sixteen again, rather than twenty-eight.
She thought about this for a bit. Sighed, and said, "Well, I can't hold that against you. To be honest, it hurts a lot less than you dating other girls. I just wish I had known a long time ago."
Malfoy shook his head. "Don't even try, Potter," he said, his eyes narrowed, and it felt like they were back in school "I know what you're doing."
Harry was quiet for a long minute, thinking. "So that's it, then," he said at last. "I can't get out of this war no matter what I do. I thought killing Voldemort would be enough."
Malfoy bought them shwarma and they ate in contented silence. It felt like weeks had passed since they'd first eaten it together, and Harry felt strangely fine with that. It had actually only been five days, but it felt much longer. He swiped at his mouth with a napkin, wiping away a smear of tsatsiki. "How long are we going to be here?" he asked.
And Harry smiled. "Good."
Harry's cock was still at attention. "No," he said, stalling. "Er… I'm still tired, too."
"You mind if I smoke?" Not waiting for an answer, she snapped and the cigarette flared briefly.
Was he bored? Unhappy? Feeling unfulfilled? Hermione had blathered on about him feeling "let down" once the war was over, and everyone had told her she was mad. Harry included. After five long years of war and Horcrux hunting, Harry was happy that the war was over. Well, perhaps not happy, but certainly relieved. Glad to be alive, too. But there was an occasional feeling of restlessness, of wondering what there was left for him. He was twenty-five. The war had started in earnest the day he'd turned nineteen, and ended four days before he'd turned twenty-four. He'd been with the Auror Department for nearly a year.
Harry hesitated. "Well - I - "
That did it. "Oh, just cast that up to me," Ginny snapped, cheeks darkening. "Tell me again how important you are, why don't you?"
"Okay," Harry said agreeably. "Back to the monastery, then?"
It might have been the first time Malfoy had actually asked for it, Harry realised. It was a sobering thought. He nodded and guided his cock to Malfoy's entrance. "We need lube," he said.
"Yes, sir," she said again, sounding surprised. "Er, sir…?"
Harry's surprise increased. "A Muggle bank?"
"The look on your face said as much, when you walked in," Malfoy said, cracking a smile. They were in front of the small restaurant and he pushed open the door. They found a table and Malfoy surreptitiously removed the crumbs and rings of wet left by pint glasses. "Why?" he resumed, sitting down across from Harry. "Do you just think I would make a terrible spy?"
"It's not the end of the world, Potter," Malfoy said dryly. "The stuff about me is true, too."
"Sorry," Harry said, meaning it this time and offering a sheepish smile. "It's been a long day. I could use a drink, too."
"I don't think I was sending hints." Malfoy pulled his knees up and hugged them, shivering. "I was too messed up for that. I just wanted you to make the first move."
"Good. Thanks." Malfoy took the reports and began to leaf through them. "I've never heard of most of these people."
The alley seemed twice as dark now that he was alone. Draco wasted no time and swiftly Apparated home himself.
Draco shook his head, but he was amused, himself. "I'll walk you there. You'd splinch yourself right now."
He had to ask. "So, who's missing, then?"
Potter was beside him, moving just as quickly to the long Gryffindor house table. His fists were clenched, as Albus Potter's expression took in as he saw them approaching. His eyes widened at the sight of his father and his Headmaster stride in from the Great Hall's entrance and make directly for him.
Harry slept on his side of the bed that night, close to the edge, and slept fitfully.
"Of course." Malfoy looked annoyed. "Not that I would have left you here, but I tried to go for help. Fuck, Potter, I thought you were going to die on me there."
"Any reason there shouldn't be?" Draco located the release for his seatbelt and pressed it.
Malfoy's cock throbbed gently against his as they rubbed, his hips pushing against Harry's in slow, rhythmic circles. A cloud drifted away from the moon, illuminating his face better. "Have you ever fucked anyone?"
__________________
Harry lowered his shwarma and looked at Malfoy for a long moment. Malfoy returned the look steadily. Harry felt things actively shifting around in his perceptions of Malfoy, felt them rearranging themselves into an altogether different view of his former rival. "I'm glad," was all he said, but he meant it.
It was mid-evening. The students were in their houses for the most part and the castle was quiet. The Quidditch pitch was empty: no one was practising tonight. Draco walked the hallways and listened to the regular creak and groan of staircases rotating themselves, suits of armour shifting, tapestries catching faint draughts high above, whispers of painted fabric as portrait occupants stirred and moved from frame to frame. It had always been familiar, these sounds, walking this place by night. It occurred to him that it was familiar to Potter, too, and wondered where he was.
Harry lifted his head. "What?" It was a little raspy.
"Erm. So Malfoy told me," Harry added lamely. "I… yeah. He's been very thorough with this disguise."
Harry found his voice at last, his throat dry and rasping. "Hey - what are you doing?"
"Yeah." Malfoy picked at his nails. "There were always people watching, too. Sometimes cheering the victims on. As soon as they would start talking, everything got quiet. I would tell them that they could have whatever they wanted, and usually that was when they broke. I don't know what was worse, having to hear whatever horrible sort of fantasy they had or being the one to tell them they couldn't have it after they spilled the Order's secrets and betrayed their friends. Listened to them howl their obscenities about me and what should be done with me. To me."
by sometime.
"Not for me," Harry said firmly. The gay/not gay thing aside, it was important, he felt, for Malfoy to feel he had a friend at the moment. Or to actually have one, perhaps.
"That's not exactly what I said," Harry said. "And she didn't exactly phrase it that way, that she just wanted to know what I was thinking."
A glance in the kitchen proved futile. Harry looked in the main room and found Malfoy sitting on the edge of the sofa, gazing out the window. There was a small bag on the floor, packed and too obviously ready to go. He heard Harry's step and turned his head.
A long moment passed. "Are you leaving?" Harry asked starkly.
"Hippogriff?" Ginny sounded disinterested, but came to inspect the picture anyway. "Very nice," she said. "Al, you've left paper peelings all over the table. Put those in the trash when you're done that picture and then come upstairs and change your shirt."
Malfoy disconnected without further comment.
"Snape," Draco bit out, "I am not a sixteen-year-old student of yours any longer. I am the Headmaster of this school, and its students may be in danger."
Malfoy's lips pursed, his expression deliberately opaque. "What do you mean, what I'm thinking?"
Harry felt worse than ever. "I didn't know," he said again. "I… thought you hated me, too. I'm sorry. I should have asked someone, found out more about you earlier on. I mean, other people here must know."
Potter didn't look convinced. "Maybe. Maybe not."
Malfoy's shoulders sagged. He dropped the snide tone. "No one's looking at anything," he muttered. "I just want to get some sleep."
Soon, he would have to suggest that they go back upstairs, or Malfoy would, but Harry wasn't in any particular hurry to get to that part. Of course, they were naked and falling asleep like this would prove a rude eye-opener for everyone involved in a discovery.
It was Draco's turn to feel embarrassed. It wasn't something he'd felt in a long time, and he was feeling it acutely now. "I didn't know," he said, though Potter didn't need to be told. His face was warm. "I'm sorry, Potter, I don't know why I didn't know that, but I didn't realise…"
"You want me to try? I need my wand. It should be in my skirt somewhere."
"No I don't," Harry tried, but knew as he said it that it was a lie.
Ginny went out and did not say where she was going. Harry puttered around the flat, doing what he normally did on weekends. Little, in other words. He vacuumed the carpets and did a few dishes and otherwise lounged in front of the television, read his current book, made himself a late lunch. How soon should he tell Ginny? How should he do it? He was genuinely fond of her between the fights and didn't want it to hurt her. It wasn't about her.
One of Malfoy's brows slid up his forehead. "We're not exactly talking about lifetime devotion, are we?" he said coolly. "I was thinking more along the lines of blow jobs over drinks. Something like that. But you're the one who brought up the subject of you and me in the first place."
"Hamish and Roger," Malfoy said. "Auror and Magical Law Enforcement, respectively. Interesting."
Yes, but everyone knows that HP has a permanent hard-on for DM and will never admit it
Portrait of a Headmaster
"Where's Dean?" Harry asked.
Draco couldn't look at him from the position he was in. Harry's finger had stopped moving, waiting. "Do you really want me to? We don't have to, if you - "
"Probably," Potter agreed amiably, and neither of them mentioned that the concept of the wizard who'd beaten Voldemort splinching himself was utterly ridiculous. Then again, Potter hadn't been drunk and humming under his breath at the time, either. He stumbled again and reached for Draco's arm, and it was possible that neither of them knew exactly what had happened next. All Draco knew was that Potter's breath was suddenly in his face and that his hands seemed to be pushing Potter's shoulders back against the brick and he was inches away from smothering that humming with his mouth. He couldn't help it; Potter was so rumpled and disarmingly attractive like this, all careless and dishevelled and Draco's trousers were decidedly too tight all of a sudden. It didn't cross his mind that he was in no way worthy of Potter, that Potter was in no fit state to be played with like this, but it wasn't just him playing, not when Potter was going for it with almost alarming enthusiasm. Their mouths came together hotly, Potter tasting of Guinness and something that just seemed uniquely Potter, and he probably tasted like gin and what if he did. Potter's mouth was like a drug, instantly addictive. It was like kissing a virgin, but as a father of three, Potter was no virgin.
"A wizard, I mean." Potter looked at him, ignoring the traffic for the time being, one hand resting lightly on the bottom of the wheel. "I shouldn't be telling you this."
"We'll play it your way, then," Malfoy told him, smiling evilly at him. He took a step away.
"It's my school." Draco repeated, and smiled blandly. "I must say, Potter, I never knew. Does your wife?"
After awhile, Malfoy spoke. "Can I ask you something?"
He wasn't smirking any more, just smiling. "It's okay, Harry. I'm already there."
"I'll miss it here," Harry whispered, then turned around to tell Ron where he could stick it. Malfoy laughed along with everyone else.
D. Malfoy
"Right," Harry said numbly. "I can do that."
"Tell me what the hell you know!" Harry shouted, beginning to lose control. A picture frame in the living room slipped sideways and slid diagonally downward on the nail holding it in place. Malfoy's eyes followed it and he drew his own wand.
"We're losing staff?" Harry repeated. "From where? Which departments?"
It was Ginny.
"What is it?" Dumbledore asked him, and panting, Cadogan explained.
Harry stared at him and found he couldn't put any of the things he wanted to say into words. He seized Malfoy by the back of his neck and kissed him, hard. Malfoy made a small sound of some sort, and then his mouth moved against Harry's, kissing back furiously. He was tense, his arms were straight at his sides, but he wasn't objecting to the kiss in the slightest, his mouth opening under the prompting of Harry's, their tongues mashing wetly together. Harry's glasses grew steamy with breath condensation, but he didn't take them off until they began to cut into Malfoy's cheekbone, at which point Malfoy reached up and clawed them off, not even pausing for breath.
For the next few days, Draco paid as little attention as possible to the invasion, as he privately termed it, of Potter on his turf. Corridor sightings were infrequent at best and could be dispensed with a frosty nod. Potter showed up to most meals and, for lack of a better place to put him, Draco had seated him at the far end of the staff table, where Longbottom temporarily relocated himself to keep Potter company. Draco was fully aware that they had not yet re-addressed the situation between their sons, but had been putting it off until Cynthia reminded him.
They waited five minutes, then Disapparated from the alley behind the café. Harry was unsurprised to find himself back in Malfoy's flat, but felt what was rapidly becoming a nightly habit of awkwardness coming over him again. It had now been five nights since the little episode in the hallway, and Malfoy had never made reference to it again, nor had he initiated anything further. It was as though it had never happened. He was perfectly courteous, but he neither mentioned the conversation leading up to it, nor anything about Harry's apparent newfound willingness to acknowledge what he wanted, nor his marriage, children, or anything else specifically personal, in fact. It bothered Harry more than he cared to admit to himself. He thought about saying something, but it almost seemed too late. If Malfoy had wanted it to happen again, then surely he would have said so. Then again, Harry reasoned, Malfoy had said he wasn't thinking of anything involved or serious. Perhaps he had only wanted to do it the one time. Perhaps it was the thrill of having been the first one to successfully lure Harry into giving in, and now he was finished with it.
"Great," Malfoy said abruptly, and the phone went dead.
Malfoy turned a corner around the pond. "Does it embarrass you?"
Malfoy paused. "Would you like a drink?"
"Wait a second," Harry said, not caring that he was interrupting. "Did you just say that you wanted that to happen? That you meant for that to happen?"
"Since now," Harry said firmly. "I meant it. I'm sorry. I've been a shit to you since you moved in here."
"Various people," Malfoy said aloofly.
"Can we have breakfast together?" Potter gave him a winning smile.
"In some ways, I think that your experiences with the war happened on a more similar level, even if they were rather different," Hermione said seriously. "I mean… Ginny never really lived through the war in the same way that you did, did she? It has to be hard to share that. Even though you and Malfoy were on opposite sides, I can see the experience being more similar."
Great, Harry thought, but did not say. He held out his hand for it and scanned the parchment page. It took him a moment to find something to say about it. "Surrey."
"In small doses," Malfoy added, something flickering across his face.
Malfoy bent his head and applied his lips and teeth and tongue to Harry's neck, making him moan aloud. "No, that's what you call this," he said, voice muffled against Harry's skin. His hands were untucking Harry's shirt from his trousers, his mouth finding Harry's again to silence him before he could protest. Harry had abandoned the idea of protesting and went with it. Malfoy swung one bare knee around and was straddling him, breasts almost in Harry's face before he bent to consume his mouth again, his feminine torso coming to rest against Harry's. Harry's hands found their way to Malfoy's arse, first over the skirt, then lifting it to explore beneath. He reached the barely-clad, smooth curves and Malfoy pulled back. "Not yet." He reached between them, his long fingers squeezing at Harry's cock through his trousers, French tips and all. "Oh my, Potter," he breathed. "You are up for this, aren't you?"
They made it to the bed somehow and fell into it together. Malfoy's mouth was hot on his neck, his chest, moving down his front. He tugged at Harry's pyjama pants and dragged them down to his knees, and then his mouth was on Harry, his tongue curling around Harry's balls, lips mouthing over every sensitive bit of skin there. Harry was as hard as he could have been, and wanting nothing more than this. He thought of Malfoy being forced to do this, to torture other men with it, and his fury at the thought made him all the more fiercely glad that it was he whom Malfoy had chosen to do this with. To do this for. Harry's back arched as Malfoy took his cock into his mouth at last and fought for air; the pleasure rendered him incapable of breath or speech. Malfoy's hands were gentler than Harry would have thought, touching him in places Harry had never thought to try and in others that felt so different when someone else was doing it. His mouth was hot and smooth and what his mouth wasn't touching, his hands were. Harry was gasping, legs fallen open as wide as they went and his only coherent thought now was that once he had finished, he wanted to try this on Malfoy. Embarrassing as it was to still be, for all intents and purposes, a virgin at the age of twenty-five, he had every intention of catching up as quickly as possible. Malfoy's mouth was strong and the suction alone was intense, but his tongue was what undid Harry. Malfoy glanced up once, and their eyes met. Harry flung his head back, bit down on his lower lip and came, his entire body nothing but white heat. It was difficult not to cry out, but when the orgasm spent itself, Harry exhaled, panting, his face flushed and hot.
Harry picked at the blanket with his fingers. "I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do."
Harry walked a full circle around both Dolohov and Malfoy, whose wand was now trained on the back of Dolohov's head. Finally he knew what he was going to do. "You are under arrest," he said, "for the murder of Ginevra Weasley Potter and sedition against the Ministry of Magic. I, Harry James Potter, have the right as Head Auror to suspend your right to a trial. You are hereby sentenced to spend the rest of your natural life in Azkaban. Your memories of your crimes will be removed, thus ensuring your silence. Case closed."
While they were buying groceries that afternoon (for Harry this time), Pig came fluttering by (in broad daylight, as usual) and dropped a short scrawl in front of Harry before taking off again. Muttering to himself, Harry retrieved it and broke the seal to read it.
"What do you want to do? It should be your idea, I think."
Malfoy snickered wickedly. "Would 'stuff' have anything to do with the rumour I heard about you and Bill Weasley?"
H. Williamson, Training Supervisor
It was as though he hadn't spoken. Malfoy, already striding furiously toward the door, didn't even pause. Harry threw the strongest locking charm he knew of at it, and was satisfied when Malfoy couldn't get past it. "Have a seat," he repeated. "We're not through."
"If we get out of here…" Harry said, and let it hang unfinished between them.
The door opened and a large form came through it. Harry had specified the back corner, and the figure turned in their direction and began walking over, hesitating. Searching. There was a slight catch in his gait as his eyes fell upon Harry, and then he came over. Next to him, Harry felt Malfoy's eyes narrowing, sizing up, assessing. The man reached them and slid his muscular bulk into the banquette opposite. "Hello Dudley," Harry said quietly. "Thanks for coming."
Malfoy just smiled, clearly drifting off. But after a few moments, when Harry thought he was already asleep, he spoke again. "This is going to be good, Harry."
"No." Harry looked at his hands on the cup. "It's more than that. It's because of him that I know I'm… like this. I didn't want to be."
"Come out?" Tonks repeated, giving Harry a scrutinising look.
"We'll find somewhere. Let's get out of here."
This was a fair point. "Oh," Draco said. "I see."
She nodded, a little quickly, but agreeing. "Yes. We should. See you, Harry."
Harry's face burned with the memory of the first time. "It wasn't too soon this afternoon, was it?" He sounded defensive and he knew it.
Draco dragged his mind back to the outside world with reluctance. "What was it, then?" The threat was gone, but the curiosity remained.
He pretended that the little interaction hadn't bothered him. Nevertheless, it kept coming back into his head at inconvenient moments, like the pause between the pushing of the button on the espresso maker and when it began to drip into his cup. The fragrance of crushed coffee beans rose into the air and he thought of Potter's rough fingernails cradling the beer mug, leaving marks in the condensation. Or waiting for the lift up to his office, the absolute nothingness in his mind suddenly filled by the sound of Potter's bitter voice recounting his error.
"Yes." Potter looked at him. "Why?"
Albus was squirming. "Sorry," he said lamely. "It's just… with Mum…" he trailed off and Draco felt the boy's gaze drift awkwardly over toward him.
"Don't pander to me. I don't want pretty lies."
Malfoy gave him a strange look. "Great," he said, though he didn't sound particularly interested. "You can stop stirring it, then."
Clutching his broom, Harry looked down again at his Disillusioned feet shuffling along as they stuck out from under the invisibility cloak. Beside him in the cloak's tent-like stuffiness, Malfoy was breathing reminders, and Harry needed them, even if he didn't need Malfoy's unwelcome proximity. It was distracting. He was listening and nodding, though Malfoy wasn't looking, absorbing everything and subconsciously double-checking Malfoy's Disillusionment on his feet. He'd been incredulous at the thought of only Disillusioning his feet, but Harry pointed out that, as Malfoy's plan required his cloak, they were both tall and would need to take more precautions than simply hoping that the goblins didn't notice their feet wandering about Gringotts unattended.
Headlines
"Where?"
"Oh," Harry said, startled. "No, I hadn't heard. I'm sorry."
Harry coloured. "I didn't… how you do know I enjoyed it?"
They moved into the next frame, the frame where Lucius had been waiting, and Cadogan had not been mistaken: they were there, a group of seven, all hooded and masked. Potter was there ahead of him, staring angrily into the group. "I want you to leave the castle," he said.
"I wish you would tell me why you wish I wouldn't, but we can't always get what we want, can we?"
* * *
His curiosity grated. Harry felt his face begin to heat in anger. "No."
Harry suppressed his sigh and focused. "We get in. You do your thing with distracting the goblins at the door and then again by the vaults. We hijack a cart and attempt to send it back to the surface once we're at the vault, assuming we find it. About that - "
"Have I?" Potter didn't sound surprised. "I guess war will do that."
"I've been practising a different walk, too," Malfoy said. "What would you guess that I do for a living?"
Harry thought about it as he walked. "Yeah. I think they're going to be, at least."
Malfoy sat back in his chair and crossed his legs. "What do you want to know?"
Malfoy paused, one sandal on and the other in his hand. "Would you?" He looked like he was trying not to look pleased.
And as for himself… Harry felt that life was finally just beginning. No - not beginning. He thought of his children one by one, then of Ron and Hermione, and of the barely visible scar on his forehead. This was the beginning of the rest of his life.
Malfoy didn't respond, biting his lip, still not looking at him.
"No," Snape said promptly. "Why do you ask?"
Badly, Draco thought. Not five minutes in, and they'd used that word. He was doing badly. The knot in his stomach hardened.
Malfoy did give a ghost of a smile, though it faded quickly. "It looked painful," he said quietly. "I don't know what the spells did, but sometimes they talked about something burning. I think one of the spells actually made the blood in the… area hotter."
"You want me to suck you?"
"So far," Draco said. "We'll see about when I find the Death Eaters. You'll come with us?"
"I didn't," Harry said quietly.
He tossed and turned on the sofa that night, debating whether or not to take Hermione into his confidence. The problem was that she was so close to Ginny, her best friend and sister-in-law. Ron was out, obviously, but Harry desperately needed advice. For once, his gut instinct was letting him down. He'd followed it to Malfoy and could not seem to trace it back to what to do about the rest of his life. Hermione would find out eventually, either way. In fact, she probably knew Ginny's side of it already. She had been his friend first, and if anyone would understand this, she would. Besides, there was no one else he trusted enough. Neville would be sympathetic but he wouldn't have any concrete advice. Luna would assume it was that Harry and Malfoy had known each other in some past life and were currently being connected by the Singing Trumbleby Spirits or some such thing. It had to be Hermione. His mind made up, Harry fell almost immediately into an exhausted sleep.
"Okay," Ron said, sounding confused. They had changed in front of each other many times before without issue, not that Harry wanted to think about that right now. "I'll just, uh, wait, then."
Harry stole a look at him. The blood on Malfoy's cheek seemed to have increased. "Are you bleeding?"
"He'll be fine wherever he is," Draco said positively. He was curious, himself, however. "You know he will."
"I'm fine," Harry repeated.
"What did you think, then?"
Potter was glaring. "You work with children. You are their sole highest authority and level of protection - "
Harry shook his head. "It wouldn't be, if you had been there. Hard to swallow, I mean. We fought all the time, or she was mad at me all the time. I couldn't get anything right and she was always disgusted with me. I don't think it was as 'right' as everyone thought it was supposed to be, including both of us, I guess. I don't know. It just made sense at the time."
The tomb of Salah al-Din was reverently quiet. No hawkers followed them there, though Harry had just recently been persuaded to purchase a thyme-filled, horseshoe-shaped flatbread pastry of sorts for the equivalent of about eight Knuts, from an eight-year-old boy. "Shukran," he'd said, and the boy had beamed. Thank you.
"No, other people excluding me," Harry said, bitter. "I don't really like talking about it."
The memo about the holidays was waiting in his cubicle when Harry arrived at the Ministry three mornings later. He shoved it into his messy briefcase to take home and promptly forgot it, as he was about to be late for a meeting.
Now they were passing the mosque. Malfoy checked the time. "They should happen any moment now. Wait until you hear the prayer calls, Harry - they're so beautiful."
Harry glared. "Why? What are you afraid of?"
"Mostly?"
Harry scrambled around, anticipation spiking, and he wasn't disappointed. Malfoy's hand came out to smack his arse, the sting making Harry's cock throb. And then Malfoy's tongue was swiping over that, too, one hand still ringing Harry's cock as his tongue stabbed directly into Harry's hole. Harry cried out in some combination of surprise and extreme pleasure and Malfoy did it again, licking all around it, then darting inward, his tongue right inside Harry like fire, and it felt so good that he found himself wholly incapable of articulate speech. He was going to come just from this. Malfoy replaced his tongue with a finger, his tongue still somewhere nearby, his other hand jerking and rubbing Harry's cock as his hole spasmed around Malfoy's tongue. He could hear the sounds he was making, but was utterly powerless to stop them. With a sudden rush, Harry felt it coming, come exploding out of him, blood pounding in his ears. A drop of it splashed onto his face as he lay with his arse in the air, his forehead down on the bedspread.
Draco felt his most stubborn look cross his own face. "I sent you an owl," he said acidly. "I expected a response."
Malfoy's eyes found his. "You were busy. I had things to do, too. Assignments and the usual sort of thing. It was just that I'd had a strange thought that if I ever told anyone, you would understand it. I mean, I had to give Snape the basics, but after that, I never talked about it with anyone, and when we moved in here, you still seemed to hate me and I just gave up on the idea. I thought maybe someone had told you about it and that you were disgusted and even less interested in talking to me."
Ron, to his credit, was either male enough or old-fashioned enough that he hardly expected Harry to keep himself pure as the driven snow until marriage, provided that in the end, Harry did end up with his sister. Which he didn't exactly come out and say, but Harry got the drift. Meanwhile, Ron was the only one with whom Harry let in on the details of his short-lived affairs, and Ron was the first one to nudge Harry in a pub to point out the presence of some hot young thing across the way. Living vicariously, perhaps, Harry sometimes thought, given that he and Hermione had been engaged for nearly two years already. Either way, he seemed to understand that Harry wasn't in the headspace for a commitment to anyone for the time being, and left it alone.
Potter seemed to have no objection to this, either. They were rubbing together, delicious crotch-on-crotch friction, but there was far too much in the way between them. Draco wanted flesh on flesh again, and he wanted more than he would ever have the ability to put into words, for Potter to take him and possess him, enter him and claim him. In a brief and blinding moment of self-honesty, Draco admitted to himself that he had always wanted this. He had. But Potter didn't ever have to know that. He allowed his shirt to be unbuttoned and dragged from his arms, and he hauled Potter's worn t-shirt over his rumpled hair. Perhaps it was little more than a release of stress over his son's welfare driving Potter. Perhaps it was whatever had so easily allowed him to let what had happened the other night. Either way, Draco didn't care. He opened his eyes and met Potter's.
"How kind," Harry said. "Uh, well… I guess I'm not particularly busy. I mean, I said I'd be home around - "
Harry looked at him, simultaneously reluctant and relieved to have the opportunity to have a free invitation to do so. Malfoy looked better than he had in days. His hair was clean and rather shiny, and the clothes he was wearing beneath the work robes were obviously designer and fit rather well. Rather too well. Harry's eyes travelled down over Malfoy's body before he could prevent himself, and Malfoy caught him at it. Harry cleared his throat again and came up with the right answer. "You're sober," he said.
Harry made himself not react, consciously not letting his grip on the tumbler grow, letting Malfoy see his whitening nail beds. It was important to stay very, very neutral just now. "What?"
"I'm going to have to have a little conversation with her, clearly," Harry said, more interested at the moment in how soft Malfoy's hair was under his chin.
Harry hedged. "I left you a note," he said.
"So you set a trap for him," Draco said, still icy calm. "What did you do?"
"I see no point in continuing," Snape said, as though no one had spoken, and for the third time, repeated: "The war is over. The new age has begun. It is time we all moved on."
"Tell me," he insisted. "You know it's true. I know it's true. I know you didn't like me; we never liked each other. But the whole world has changed since all that."
Potter went completely still. Then: "What?"
"It's that one topic," Potter agreed. "It's something that needs to be acknowledged, at least, if we're going to be friends. Obviously it was a huge part of our lives. I don't know what you do and you don't know what I do, but I think it's probably safe to say that the war has effected what we do with the rest of our lives."
"They're only human. Speaking of the Ministry, how long have you been working there?" Harry wanted to know.
"Was your wife here, too?" Harry asked.
Harry came cursing, his cock spurting thickly into Malfoy's fist, onto his pale, bare belly, his thighs clamped around Malfoy's. He forgot to move his hand and Malfoy grabbed it, holding it in place with a grip of steel and fucked it with force, his hips rising off the bed to meet it. He came, and it was hot and wet and made Harry want to come again.
Harry didn't say that he hadn't brought it up. Malfoy's face was still all angles, but somehow they didn't suggest the word "pointy" now. Perhaps he had grown into his features. He was actually very attractive. Harry felt a twinge of envy. He could not have looked that put-together for all the stores in the world. It was just a way Malfoy had.
"I'm sure you would." The sarcasm was thick and unmistakeable.
Failing that, find me his email at the Ministry.
Upstairs, he ran cold water over the cut and grimaced as he surveyed it in the mirror. It would probably scar over his old scar. Just what he needed. A stinging on his chest made itself known as he bent to get a healing salve from his bag. Frowning, Harry straightened and pulled off his shirt to examine the damage. It appeared to be a stinging hex.
Malfoy paid and they left. "That was short."
OWL and I got an O! It was a hard one. I think Scorpius only
Malfoy forced another laugh. "I thought not. So, what's the deal with you and Weasley? The female one," he clarified.
Harry laughed, as he was obviously intended to. "Very funny."
"Old habits die hard."
"You can't Confund a goblin, Potter." Malfoy took his elbow and steered him across the street to avoid an oncoming crowd of pedestrians, as they wanted neither to be overheard nor bumped into.
"You're the one who wanted to bet," Draco said nastily. "It's not my fault your gaydar doesn't work for shite. Fine, I'll take that as a no. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some things to do."
Again Harry made to speak, but then didn't, not right away, at least. He was busy processing what Draco had just said. Then - "You are? Does that mean you believe me?"
Malfoy laughed. "I never even asked," he said. "But sure, it does seem like a bond of sorts, now that you know about it, too."
Harry was panic-stricken, his heart in his throat. "Malfoy! What are you doing? I - " he was struggling to cover himself, force his stiff prick back into his jeans, but it was so obvious what he was doing and Malfoy had clearly already had a good eyeful of Harry standing there with his hands all over himself. His face had already flushed with heat, but now he thought it might actually explode from sheer humiliation. And arousal, oh yes. But he was trying not to let his thoughts go there at all.
Harry shrugged. He got this question often enough. "We're friends," he said shortly.
Malfoy pulled him up. "Confession time," he said, biting his lip once they were face-to-face. "I've, er, always wanted to try this… as a woman, I mean… um - "
He was expecting a snort and a telling off, but he did not receive one. There was an awkward pause. "Why, Potter, looking for advice?"
"That," Draco said, rage seeping into his every pore, "was revenge for what you had done to me the previous spring - and it was far too gentle by half!"
"No problem," Dudley said, eyes roaming suspiciously over Malfoy. "This your friend?"
His fingers were coated in the slick stuff, cool within Draco but warming quickly. The fingers plunged deeply this time and he groaned, spreading his legs, his reluctance having disappeared after the difficulty of the request. When he couldn't take Potter's skilled finger fucking any more, Draco grabbed his arm. "Enough," he said hoarsely. "Fuck me." He found the tube and squeezed some lube into his own shaking palm and rubbed it over Potter's hard cock as Potter pushed himself up on one elbow. He watched Draco's face as he did it, save for when he closed his eyes to moan softly. Draco watched him just as hungrily, drinking in the expression of wanton need on Potter's face as he stroked him again, fingers slipping with the lubrication. "You like that?"
They stared at each other. "Hi," Harry said, quietly so as not to be overheard.
When he woke, the room was empty. Sunlight was straggling in through the streaked and filthy windows. Harry touched his face. It had become reflex, feeling for cuts and his glasses. He found neither. The glasses were close by. Harry put them on and sat up. He found his wand and was set to cast a tempus to find out how late it was, then remembered Malfoy's hissed warnings about using it the night before. There was no clock. He got up. The pile of clothing on the floor was as dirty as it had been the night before. Harry didn't even want to put the robes back on, never mind the things that had been next to his skin. He found the towel from the night before and wrapped it prudishly around himself and went downstairs to ask Malfoy about using his wand.
"What?"
Malfoy sent him a hard look. "Unspeakable, Potter. Obviously I'm not allowed to talk about it."
"Just the one. What's wrong with him?" Harry thought of Susan Bones and wondered why everyone else knew about Malfoy's issues but him.
"You must think I'm the most disgusting person you've ever known," Malfoy murmured, barely audible, his eyes still closed, his face pale as death.
Malfoy turned his head and looked at him, his eyes only half open. "Feel okay?"
Potter felt it, and let the topic go. "Do you miss him?"
"I will."
Toward dawn, the dream came again. It started with Harry waking very suddenly and very thoroughly. The war had taught him to go from sleeping to fully conscious in seconds, particularly when there was cause for alarm. A sound like faint chiming was occurring in his head and he recognised it instantly: someone had breached a ward he had set. Harry frowned, focused, and listened again. No, not a ward - an alert. Privet Drive.
"That's longer than most people get for the final assignment," Moody added. "We know that friendship doesn't happen overnight, so we figured the extra time might be helpful. We'll check in once a month or so and see. It's the twenty-fifth of November today. See what you can do. In the meantime, we trust you'll recall that the final assignment, as the others, is completely confidential. Not a word, not to a soul. Obviously if Potter finds out, the whole bet is off, and no one wants that. You'll remember?"
"Hello?"
Malfoy was quiet for a long time. "Let's see… I don't know. There aren't any safe topics. I sort of want to go back to sleep."
They broke for breath, panting. "Potter - " Malfoy stopped, breathing hard. "I - "
Malfoy's laughter was wicked. Before he could say anything, though, someone upstairs got up, creaked across the floor and went to the bathroom. They waited, listening. The water ran, first in the pipes, then into the sink. The door opened, and footsteps padded back into the bedroom, leaving the door ajar. "Fuck," Malfoy said softly. "Well. You'll just have to try not to scream when you come, Potter."
"Too much enthusiasm. You'll scare me off, Potter, honestly."
Malfoy shook his head. "You can't save me, Potter. I find the very notion offensive." He took off his shoes and left them in the hall, crossing into what Harry presumed was the bedroom. Still feeling strange, he followed.
"Sure," Malfoy said easily.
"Actually, yeah," Harry said, his eyes still on the door. "Not in here, though."
Potter nodded guardedly. "What can I do for you?" He was polite but not welcoming.
"How's that?" he called.
The bus had no air conditioning and the sun had turned it into a small greenhouse on wheels. It didn't matter. Harry could see the faint outlines of the ruins shimmering in the distances, like ghostly backdrops to the rest of the desert. Heat wavered like a haze in the air and the sparse palms here and there looked dusty. In short, it was the most exotically different scene Harry had ever seen.
"Look, I had a little thing for Weasley - Bill, that is - a long time ago. That's all." Malfoy held his gaze until what he was saying filtered through Harry's sluggish mind.
Potter looked over. "Wait for me," he said. "We need to talk to Albus. The other one."

Harry left him and went to the kitchen. The cupboard next to the stove held a rather vast array of potions, all of which were labelled neatly. The hangover potion was closest to the front. Harry frowned at it and poured some into a glass. A rather hefty dosage. He carried it to the bathroom and found Malfoy still brushing. He didn't say anything, and Malfoy didn't acknowledge his presence, other than to flick his eyes briefly over Harry's face through the mirror. Then he bent and spit, rinsing his mouth repeatedly. "Give that here."
"I have an idea." Malfoy swung his long legs over the side of the bed and walked to the attached bathroom. He wore only shorts and the view was distracting.
"Do you like sushi?" It came out suddenly, and maybe it was an odd question to ask just then, but Draco was grasping at straws.
"Yes. This Friday."
"Since when do you care about my benefit?" Malfoy threw back, practically spitting the words.
"I was hoping that you would assist Draco in his investigation," Kingsley said. "Look for suspicious-looking magic and see if you can help trace it back to the people who cast it. Find the leaks. Fix them."
Malfoy flinched and looked past him to the burnt tapestry of the Black family line. "It was my job to… excite them."
"You have another portrait in the dungeons," Potter said. "Outside the Potions classroom, as I recall. Therefore, nothing should happen to you, your portrait self, I mean, if something happens to this frame. Right?"
Ginny stared at him for a long minute. Then she gave a short, bitter laugh. "Enough and more," she said. "God, Harry. I can't believe you." She turned and went into the bedroom.
Harry took a sip of his tea. "Good, then."
"Oh. Right," Ron said, and subsided back into shocked silence.
Harry spilled a bit of sugar on the table. "Sorry," he muttered. "Well. I mean, you did… er, kiss me the other day."
"Well done, Malfoy, well done," came Moody's gruff voice. "Excellent work. That must have been a record. Under ten minutes."
"Ever the saviour. I will. Maybe."
It didn't quite come off as it should have, though, and suddenly Harry wondered if Malfoy hadn't even done that. "No, I was just wondering," he said lamely.
She gave him a look that was possibly intended to look sympathetic but just looked condescending to him. "You grew up in a cupboard," she said, as though explaining it to a child. "No one ever touched you except in anger. It's understandable to have sexual issues."
"Not just this place. This war," Harry muttered. He threw the Prophet aside, bored with the puzzle. The bloody things were too long, anyway.
"Cheers," Malfoy said, clinking his against Harry's. "To a well-executed plan."
Potter moved away from him as though he hadn't noticed the sudden contact, but the faint touch of colour on both cheeks gave him away. "Let's Disillusion, then," he said, and without waiting, went ahead and cast the spell on himself.
The café where Harry was staked out (a term he mentally applied with great irony) proclaimed itself to have wireless internet access. Which didn't explain why he was trying, for the fourteenth or fifteenth time, to connect to a network. The progress bar ran itself over and over again, and there was nothing. He had already walked the neighbourhood several times, Disillusioned, for he had no desire to be recognised, especially here. The neighbours probably still thought he was a dangerous criminal, and he particularly did not want to see his relatives. He had set wards and alerts around Number Ten and settled himself after several hours in said café to wait. Waiting without internet access was a pain, though.
Harry paused, trying to choose his words with care. "I didn't know you... felt like that."
"The pantry is pretty disgusting," Neville said. "I was thinking we should maybe clean it."
Harry stomped on the thought mentally. He was not gay. Not, not, not. Maybe if he thought it enough, it would be true. It was true. He'd been with Ginny for ages. And even if that wasn't what he wanted, it just meant he needed to be with someone else. A different woman. Not a man. And certainly not Malfoy.
