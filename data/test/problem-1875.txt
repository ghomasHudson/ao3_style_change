They get the case assigned to them. Not much of a surprise, really, considering Harry’s experience with Death Eaters and Chandra’s specialty being criminal psychology. The crime scenes are impeccable: not a clue left to figure a message beyond the subtext of
They have lunch at The Leaky. It’s Saturday, and it’s midday, and Harry didn’t think this through at all. The stares, the whispers in the shops were one thing; but to sit here, to commit to sitting down for a long period of time with people coming and going by the window next to them, sitting at the other tables around them... Harry hasn’t felt this uncomfortable in public since the end of the War, when people just wouldn’t leave him alone, wouldn’t let him catch his breath in public.
And as the ugliness spreads from his torso to his limbs, and the hand keeps ripping away at his wounds, he knows that they never were forgotten. They never were tended to. They were hidden, terrified, waiting for something to come along and expose them for their vulnerability.
“And—it’s not like that.” Harry laughs. It’s a bitter, throaty sound. “People haven’t magically changed. Corruption hasn’t magically disappeared just because Voldemort is dead. I guess, in a way, after you spend half your life fighting and running for your life, chased by the manifestation of evil itself, you don’t really have time to stop and consider that that’s what he is. A manifestation. But the people who allowed him to be, followed him, created him... they’re here. We’re all here.”
Harry just stares and keeps staring, until Malfoy’s face blurs in front of him, until his eyes and his cheekbones and his nose don’t make sense anymore, until he has to zoom back out to see him again.
Draco looks at him, eyes grateful. “Yeah. And then... suddenly, there was all the space. All the time. My mother put me up with a relative in Burgundy. I was just there—I wasn’t doing anything, just lying in bed all day and feeling like I didn’t have a place in the world. Like this body, these thoughts, these ideas, these memories... they were not mine. They didn’t feel mine. I would look in the mirror in the mornings and think,
Harry barely listens. He looks at Draco’s limp body again, panic surging through him. “Mr Diggory, please—please let him go. He had nothing to do with—”
Robards looks at Harry with the slight arch of an eyebrow, clearly leaving it up to him to make his case. Typical.
His eyes are the same light, soft shade of blue teetering on grey; but they’re more tired than Harry has ever seen them. More aware. Less sure.
He’d have never even thought that scars and wounds as ugly as they have given each other could heal over enough that you could ever touch that area again with the hopes of not hurting it. But here they were; and just how strong was Harry meant to be, here?
“If you must know, all the taps in the Manor had hot and cold water coming from separate taps. Old as all hell estate and all. Fucking terrible insulation as well.”
Draco watches Harry’s face intently for a few seconds before he looks away and continues. “Except for my mother, I guess. But can you call it kindness, when—when she watched my father recruit me into a death cult when I was sixteen and did nothing?”
“Well,” Chandra says slowly, “didn’t you say he’s been disconnected from the wizarding world for years? It’s not really—”
“You didn’t know you were a wizard?” Malfoy asks, eyes wide. “Sorry,” he says when he realises he’s interrupted, giving a little shake of his head, a single blond lock untucking from behind his ear. It curls softly against his cheekbone.
Harry wants to reach out, grasp Draco's hand, do something to channel the heavy impulse to encourage that washes over him. But he doesn't want to disturb Draco; he has a feeling like he's supposed to witness this, not participate in it.
She grins that lopsided grin of hers; the one that had Harry tripping over his own words in the beginning of their partnership, in that initial phase when you don’t yet quite know if you’ll grow attracted to a person or not. “Don’t worry, Potter, you didn’t fail at being Best And Most Conscientious Auror Ever Who Knows About Everything. The investigation was undercover. I was called in to consult.”
Despite the undeniably similar nature of the two murders, the cases get assigned separately. When Chandra not-so-gently inquires why, Harry trying his best to soften her edges, Robards simply tells them there are too many factors at play. Both victims could have been wanted dead by dozens, and the murders were committed by a generic Avada; no message, no nothing, and
“Chandra,” Harry says, embarrassed. “Where’s Diggory now? Do we—do we know what he wanted? Why he did this?”
“Absolutely not,” Malfoy cuts in. He has calmed down, now looking oddly reserved; his face is carefully neutral, his words unfaltering but emotionless. “Now, if you’ll excuse me,” he says, and with that, he turns towards the door, apparently deeming the discussion over.
Malfoy takes his shoes off by the door without a word, then sort of shuffles into the living room awkwardly, eyes darting around the flat. He takes in the open space, the TV and the U-shaped sofa; the swirling galaxies of the quartz kitchen island, the dark walnut floors and the pictures of Harry’s family: mostly Ron and Hermione and Teddy.
Malfoy sighs, long-suffering as if he’s decided to walk straight into his death. “I’ll pack a bag.” And with that, he turns around and disappears in the house in his green bathrobe.
Malfoy belongs there, with those memories, those feelings in that corner, doused with the water of Lethe, never to be disturbed.
Narcissa nods and clears her throat. “Indeed he does. He has ever since he’s returned from France. Furthermore, he refuses to come back home, even for Christmas. We exchange letters. By which I mean I write to him, begging to know how he is, what he is doing, in essence, and he reluctantly answers. He doesn’t tell me much. I visit him sometimes… but I am lucky if he lets me see him twice a year.”
The waitress comes to take their orders. Malfoy gets a ploughman’s lunch. “No ham, please,” he says to her. Harry gets fish and chips.
Malfoy stares back. Katie claps her hands together excitedly. “That’s bloody brilliant! William, you never said you had such a close group of friends back in school! When are you leaving?”
The great news, he supposes, is the fact that he isn’t to leave Malfoy’s side for a second, so any and all outrage will suffer the weakening effect of being in the form of the written word, because he sure as hell isn’t going to meet either one of them while Malfoy is living with him.
When he falls asleep for the last time that night, he dreams about a river. It’s fast and swollen wide after heavy rain, washing out mud and rocks from the depths of its bed while Harry watches on.
After all the things he has learned about Malfoy in the past couple of days, this is the last straw.
He lets out a breath as he realises something. “You know, I haven’t even really caught on to the full magnitude of this, like—Aliyah Pittman, for instance. She hasn’t done anything. But what if she was going to? What if she really was going to start her own little blood purity movement and Mr Diggory targeted her to prevent that from happening, to rewrite the future—”
“Hold your horses, Potter.” Malfoy dries his hands on the cloth hanging from the oven door handle. “If I’m to make my grand return, you can bet your ass I’m going to be looking breathtaking.” He starts towards his room. “Give me thirty, yes?” he asks, then closes the door without waiting for an answer.
“I’m so angry,” he says, and it comes out so awkward and out of place that he can feel the back of his neck tingle with a flush. But Malfoy doesn’t laugh or sneer, just nods slightly, encouraging him to go on. “Like… all the time. My entire life, I have been waiting for... a catharsis of sorts, I guess. And it just… it just hasn’t happened.” He swallows, unsure how to continue. He stares at the wooden knife holder on the countertop behind Malfoy.
But Harry’s a bloody coward, too, so he doesn’t. He just reaches out, and grabs the part of Draco closest to him—his ankle—and squeezes lightly. “It’s okay,” he says gently. “You don’t have to say any more if you don’t want to.”
They end up drinking the whole bottle, and Harry isn’t a lightweight by any means, but he’s quite tipsy by the time they Apparate home. He doesn’t usually drink wine. It affects him very differently than beer and whiskey.
And when Harry dwells on that a bit, he realises that Draco’s probably never opened up to anyone like that before. And it sends his mind reeling, makes him want to reach out and squeeze him into a hug so tight and so long they both come out of it breathless and a bit more full of this thing Harry feels charges the air between them.
Harry’s cold, sharp laugh makes her stop mid-sentence, shocked. “I can’t imagine? Really? Really, from
“When have I ever,” Malfoy says, quiet. He doesn’t address anything else that Harry said, and honestly, Harry is getting more than used to it; he expects it, now.
Harry’s stomach flips. He takes a big gulp of his wine. “Would you like me to?” he asks in the end, senseless. Of course he does; he just asked.
Harry can feel his wand slide out from his back pocket, helpless. He turns around, just barely able to make out the shadow of a person 15 or 20 yards from them in the dark, just as Draco reaches for his wand—but as soon as he touches it, the same voice shouts a disarming spell at him.
She seems to catch herself then, and a flicker of something akin to shame or regret flashes across her face. “Not that there is anything wrong with being different, mind, but with him, it has happened so quickly, you see. And he has never bothered to explain his… transformation, so to say.”
Malfoy is in Harry’s kitchen, his flat, his safe haven; he doesn’t allow anyone but Ron and Hermione  to be here, because they’re the only ones he trusts to be careful enough not to flood his safe space with memories of loss and bereavement.
Draco opens his eyes slowly. He looks around before his eyes land on Harry, confusion written all over his face. “Harry?” His voice is quiet and hoarse. Then his eyes widen, and he sits up abruptly.
Harry looks at him. Looks at the slight, nervous tilt of his mouth, his averted eyes. Wonders if being shy is something you can learn. If it can be a thing to pick up, even for someone arrogant. Like when you become self-aware, or break a little. It occurs to him that he’s not even sure he knows what being self-aware means.
“Anyway, she liked music. Not enough to fight my father on it, but enough to want to share it with me—the only other person in her life she loved. Perhaps it was also a way for her to compensate for my father’s hardness. A silent resistance to his rule. Our little secret.”
“Yes, that would be for the best,” Harry starts. “But his mother says she has tried to talk him into that already, to no avail. And trust me when I say... if there’s one person in the universe Malfoy will listen to, it’s his mother. I don’t think there’s any use trying.”
Harry looks at him, surprised. “I had it refurbished. How do you even know about old English flats?”
, why would he force himself to tear his gaze away, why would he try to fend off the warmth creeping into every fibre of his being?
“Harry,” Draco interrupts gently. ”We will never know what these people would have done in a reality where Diggory didn’t come back to kill them. We will never know what kind of reality that would have been. Because that isn’t real anymore. Okay? This—this, now, is real.”
Draco's mouth takes on one of those devastating, slow grins. “I don’t know,” he says. “But I have other questions, too.”
“Why did Cedric have to die?” Mr Diggory interrupts, clearly angrier by the second. “He was caught in your crossfire. He died because of you. And after all that, after finding out there was a way to save him, you still refused to help. And you still don’t understand, Harry. All this is for you. All of it has been for you. Your misplaced saviour complex—I know it must have been killing you inside that you couldn’t save them. I know it must have been eating you up that you failed to find any clues. But I even left some to see what you’d do with them! How’d you like the Portkeys?”
He’s tired, and he doesn’t know how much longer he can have Malfoy around him before he does something he regrets. Something stupid and dangerous, like reaching out and tucking that goddamn lock of hair that always falls across Malfoy’s cheekbone and curves as if he was a delicately shaped Greek sculpture.
He plays with the rim of his glass, dragging his index finger over it in circles. “I had a feeling, back then. I didn’t realise it at the time, but it was guilt. I’d felt a lot of things over the years. Especially in sixth year, you know, with all the shit—”
He feels almost guilty that he gets to see a side of him that he’s evidently uncomfortable showing most of the time. But the shy tilt of Malfoy’s mouth makes him look so lovely, and his eyelashes cast shadows over his cheekbones as he looks down at the table. And Harry thinks,
“Draco!” Harry shouts, rising up from the ground. Draco struggles against the beam, thrashing and screaming.
Chandra volunteered herself on Friday to interview some people today, and that comes in incredibly handy for Harry right now, because he doesn’t think he’s capable of leaving his flat today. They order pizza and settle on the couch and watch Ice Age. It’s Draco’s favourite film, apparently, and Harry has to physically fight the fondness that overcomes him when he tells him that.
“Your flatmate mentioned,” he says, slightly strained. “Anyway—you. And your strange newfound obsession with Muggles.”
But Harry does know who he is supposed to be, he does know what his job makes him. So, without a word or a searching look, or anything else he so wants to do to convey to Malfoy his utter confusion, he grabs Malfoy’s forearm and apparates them to Diagon.
Malfoy looks at him. A slow type of amusement pulls up the right corner of his mouth. It’s a rare thing, now—one of the expressions on Malfoy’s face Harry knows from before. It fills him with a mindless sense of anticipation.
He wanders behind the kitchen island and tries to recall Malfoy’s eating preferences. He conjures a memory of jam on toast and porridge with fruit over sausages and eggs almost every single morning, and doesn’t dwell too much on how he remembers that after all these years.
He waves an arm in front of him, like he doesn’t want to say more on it, like he knows Harry will understand anyway. And he does. “But I’d never let myself dwell on them before. You know? There was no time for it, no space for anything. Just hatred, at first. Then fear.”
“I haven’t,” Malfoy says immediately. And Harry knows it’s a lie; Malfoy was positively begging him for gossip yesterday, asking if any of their classmates have started balding already, if any new shops have opened on Diagon, if Celestina Warbeck has married again, and
Harry takes some twisted sense of pleasure in her unmoving face, the lines between her eyebrows remaining soft. In the fact that he can say anything to her, and he knows she will not spit back at him, because it’s her who needs a favour from him, and badly. It makes him feel sick, somewhat, but it also embalms the festering holes in his chest; and he knows it won’t last long, that it will eventually grow into lye, swelling the wounds into craters again, but he’ll take anything now, any fast relief that will slow the violent thrumming in his veins.
“Relax, Harry, it’s just a Stupefy.” The figure points his wand at Draco again, levitating him next to himself as he starts walking towards Harry.
An understanding that his oddness about the murders has nothing to do with him being involved; just him growing, and his growth being stuck on the idea that he deserves to be punished.
“It’s actually not bad,” Harry muses after he swallows his mouthful. “Anyway, the case seems to be pretty straightforward. Macnair stepped on the wrong toe and got dumped in the fountain on Diagon. They made an example out of him.”
A sudden, dull bang comes from his kitchen window. There is a large, grey owl perched on his windowsill, holding its leg out towards him. It waits motionlessly for Harry to take the attached letter, and doesn’t wait for a treat before it flies away.
“Stop,” Chandra says, voice firm. “Stop thinking about it. I know it’s hard. The only thing we can do is keep guessing, and that's a very dangerous game to play with the future. We don’t—we can’t think too much about it. You can’t think too much about it. Understand? If he told you anything—I strongly suggest you try to forget it.”
Harry deflates a bit. He doesn’t know how many times Malfoy has sort of guessed what he was thinking now, but it’s happened enough that he’s lost count.
“I haven’t decided anything,” Harry replies disdainfully. There’s not a muscle that moves in Narcissa’s face.
And that’s how they end up in the living room, Harry sitting on the floor in front of the sofa, Draco sitting in an armchair opposite him. His ears are red.
Malfoy comes out just when he’s set the mugs on the table. First, Harry notices that his hair is wet at the nape of his neck. Then he notices that he’s wearing Muggle clothes again.
“The letter was a Portkey. But you knew that before I realised, didn’t you—” Harry rubs at his eyes. “I’m so sorry—I’m such an idiot, I could’ve killed you, you could’ve died—”
Malfoy is the bloke Harry didn’t spare a second glance when he entered, sitting on a small stool in the corner by the window, singing and playing the guitar. Harry’s ears register the music. His eyes verify the face, the scrawny figure. But his mind is unwilling to connect it to
“Don’t even think about it, Potter,” Malfoy says, sharp and real with something like frustration and a little bit of fear. “You’ve dragged me all the way out here. We’re staying. And do you honestly think anyone would be stupid enough to attack me while you’re here? In public?”
Draco laughs good-naturedly. “No.” He digs into his pocket and throws something at Harry. Harry just barely catches it. It’s a small crystal vial. “I’m one of those wise ones that carry hangover potion wherever they go, just in case.”
“Mr Potter, I’m sorry,” she says, frantic and choked up. “I don’t have the right words, and maybe I don’t have the right feelings, either. Maybe I don’t know what repentance feels like. I don’t know what you or anyone else suffering under the reign of the Dark Lord have gone through. I may never know. But I do know this: I love my son more than anything in this world. And it is eating me alive that I can’t help him. You are the only one who can. And I do know that you care. You always have. Please... do not leave.”
“Sorry, sorry. Just—threw me a bit, is all.” He laughs again. “You gotta admit, Malfoy, that isn’t something one would expect to hear from you.”
he wants to say. And he’s open enough with Chandra to say that, he just can’t now. He feels exhausted, too drained to talk, to explain. Like the invisible hand in his chest has squeezed all the blood out of his veins.
He comes out of the shower to Draco lying on the sofa in the living room, right opposite the bathroom, sprawled like he owns the place. Harry ignores how dry his mouth becomes in an instant, how pathetically his breath catches in his throat.
He does look directly at Harry once, after he takes his first bite of the pasta Harry made, and an immediate sense of pride fills Harry at his surprised expression. It never fails to shock people that he can cook. He prays every time that they don’t ask why or how he learned, and he has to try hard to focus on the pride that comes with it instead of the bitterness. But it’s worth it.
, Harry realises that he’s staring, that his eyes keep moving between Malfoy’s stomach and the goosebumps around his nipples—
In any case, Harry needs to return to London and talk to Malfoy; it was a mistake to run away yesterday without talking to him, but he needed to digest what he saw. He’s still unsure how to approach the situation, because Malfoy is obviously not himself, whatever that means.
And it’s clunky, sometimes, because they have to take these steps, they have to make conscious decisions constantly to let old habits die, and they have to say them, act on them—and that’s hard.
They go to Flourish and Blotts first. Malfoy says he needs ink and new parchment for writing music. Harry didn’t know he wrote his own music, and he really, really wants to ask him to play him something of his own sometime. But he doesn’t.
Harry shrugs. “Maybe. I don’t know. The thing is—the Malfoy I know isn’t a killer. But this Malfoy... I don’t know. He’s changed. And I can’t really put my finger on how he’s changed. I just—I can’t help the feeling that his reaction to this whole situation is odd, like... he knows something. He knows something we don’t.”
Harry is so shocked at first that he doesn’t know what to say, but then he gets sort of annoyed. Malfoy has refused to deem a single question of his with a proper answer, and now he expects Harry to know why the hell he’s acting the way he is? What for?
Robards looks at him for a long moment, scratches at his jawline with blunt fingertips. “I can’t spare two Aurors for this, Potter,” he finally says. “Not right now, with a killer on the loose and resources already strained as is. But it also isn’t possible for a single Auror to be watching him around the clock.”
So Harry leans forward again and presses his lips against his, light and chaste. Draco’s breath hitches; so quietly that Harry wouldn’t have heard it if it wasn’t for the complete silence of the night; if they weren’t kneeling right in front of each other. But it’s enough to propel him on, to make him press closer, kiss him again and again, just as light and soft, until Draco gasps into his mouth and, with two quick movements, crawls into Harry’s lap, knees on either side of Harry’s hips.
Harry takes a deep breath. He sees it clearly now: he has to push against it, get it out the door and lock it fast. This is a road that leads nowhere,
“Fuck off, Malfoy.” Harry rolls his eyes. But he can’t deny the weakness of his voice, or how his cheeks heat instantly at having been caught staring, or how forced he feels his own eyeroll to be.
Harry doesn’t own any breathtaking clothes, but he thinks he owns a pair of jeans that are not tattered beyond belief. A gift from Hermione, of course. He’s never worn them. He pairs them with his least ragged jumper—a dark red V-neck he only ever wears on the rare occasion he goes out. Only so that he doesn’t look completely out of place next to Malfoy.
“By all means.” It’s Chandra who speaks up, gesturing at the still-empty piece of parchment before her.
In an instant, Malfoy crosses over to Harry and pushes him out the door, slamming it behind himself.
“What are you talking about?” Harry’s eyes roam the area around him, looking for the letter that brought them here.
Draco looks up, and oh—his whole face is red. “You really are daft sometimes, you know that? Why do you think Diggory went after you?”
“Don’t play daft, Potter. You obviously think I have something to do with these murders. Do you honestly expect me to believe you’re keeping me under surveillance like this just to make sure I’m safe?”
Harry pauses. There are two thoughts in his head at the same time, clashing so hard against each other he doesn’t even know how they can exist in the same space. He thinks,
Malfoy shrugs. “I don’t think most people can put themselves in her shoes. Most people don’t understand her. Merlin’s tits, I don’t understand her, and I’m her son. She doesn’t hate Muggles, you know. She never has.”
, his mind echoes—Malfoy looks soft. Like the hard, deliberate lines of him, the way he guards himself and polices his every move have been washed more candid, more tender by the Firewhiskey.
“Harry. Harry, it’s okay.” It’s Chandra. She’s squeezing his arm, searching his face. “Harry, look at me.”
It’s been easy, these past years. Malfoy hasn’t been around, and Harry has become quite the expert at letting people and things from his past lie. Dusty and forgotten. But he’s only human, and his brain keeps pushing it to the forefront, waving it in front of him like a child desiring the attention of a parent.
He waits for Malfoy to say something, searching his face, but he just stares. The front door opens. It’s Katie, Malfoy’s flatmate, and Harry wordlessly takes down the
Harry contemplates everything that could have happened to them, everything that still can. All the ways he’s tried to rebel against the turn of the tide. All the blood and sweat and tears he’s poured into damming his river.
Harry struggles against the nauseating whirlwind of the Portkey, but there’s nothing to do. All he can think, panic flooding his brain as he looks at Draco’s blurry, struggling form next to him, is that he fucked up. He fucked up big time.
“You’ll think it’s silly,” Malfoy continues, “but my father always hated music, and he wouldn’t allow it in the house. He played classical on a charmed turntable during dinner, that was it.” He huffs out a tiny laugh. “I didn’t get it at the time, but now I think he did it to fill what would have otherwise been a meal filled with stilted conversation and eventually awkward silence. It was the only time we would be forced to spend more than a few minutes together. As a family.”
, then closes his eyes and sips his tea. Harry watches him for a moment as he drinks his own. Should he say something? Make small talk? Is every morning going to be like this?
Harry takes a deep breath, swallows past the lump in his throat. “He cast it wordlessly. But I think it was just a Stupefy.”
“He’s probably just been stunned,” he says to the doctor who comes running towards them as soon as they land.
With increasing panic and horror, Harry looks on as Draco rises from the ground, a bright orange beam of light pulling him away.
“I don’t know whether he keeps up with what is happening in the wizarding world, and I am afraid my warnings are not enough reason for him to be careful. I have told him of the murders, and I have begged him to return home where he would be protected, safe under the wards, at least until the culprit is caught.”
“And you ate it.” Harry still stares at him, and he can’t stop, because Malfoy’s ears are getting redder and redder by the second.
Malfoy looks somewhere next to Harry, then directly at him before settling somewhere above his eyes. “How I take my tea,” he says quietly.
It’s unfortunately almost nine, which is one of the busiest Apparition times in the Ministry. The Atrium is full of witches and wizards whose attention is naturally drawn to Malfoy’s tall figure and bright hair, but mostly his odd choice of Muggle clothing.
He can’t stop looking at the body. At the stiff limbs and the open, expressionless eyes. And with every passing moment that he can’t tear his gaze away, he feels as if a cold hand were roaming inside his chest, ripping open his long-forgotten wounds.
“I know Nott was your friend,” Harry says. “And I’m sorry about what happened to him. And believe me, I don’t want to be here any more than you want me to be here. But what happened to Nott and all those other people isn’t right, and it wouldn’t be right if it happened to you.”
Malfoy makes tea without a word, Harry sets the table, and then Malfoy does a tiny, happy little dance when he bites into his first crêpe, and Harry’s chest floods with warmth so quickly he gets shivers from it. And he knows, with a sudden clarity that makes his breath hitch, that Malfoy is letting his guard down for him.
And it still hits Harry like a freight train sometimes, especially in moments like this. Because despite the clothes and the attitude, Draco looks more himself now than he has this entire past week, and that makes Harry think of that dramatic contrast all the more.
When the name finally circles around his brain long enough to hit a wall, he is instantly snapped out of his reverie. “She was a Snatcher during the War. Avoided Azkaban because they could never prove anything on her. Inconclusive evidence.”
Malfoy turns his head toward Harry and smiles. It’s not a sneer, or a grin, or even a sad little thing, one of those self-deprecating ones that seem the truest on his face these days. Just a tiny, conspiratory quirk of the mouth. Just for Harry.
“Welcome back,” he says with a lopsided smile that he hopes is laid-back enough to convey how it’s really no big deal that Malfoy is back, even if it might be. Frankly, Harry has no idea how people will react to seeing him after thinking him a cowardly recluse for so long. Which he probably is, regardless of where he’s been all these years.
As Malfoy absentmindedly reaches up to tuck a lock of hair behind his ears, Harry realises that his hands are shaking.
“What do you mean?” Malfoy asks quietly when he doesn’t continue. Harry looks at him. He looks interested.
Draco’s wine glass freezes in his hand. Then, slowly, he smiles at Harry, lifting one corner of his mouth, like a cat that knows he’s got you, can do whatever to you, and you’ll still like them. “Why thank you, Harry,” he says, airy and pretentious. It’s nonsensical, how much joy Harry feels at that, at Draco finding these little windows in time when he can be himself.
Maybe Malfoy doesn’t think so much about it, Harry can’t tell, and he doesn’t want to make it weird by bringing it up. But he can’t help the feeling that they share in this, the strangeness of it all.
“Fuck off, Harry,” Draco says with a lopsided little smile and an eyeroll, and the strangeness and familiarity of that at the same time makes Harry feel like they really are on the cusp of something.  He’s so full, overflowing with the kind of energy that makes you feel like your organs are trembling with it.
“Wait!” Narcissa’s shout—scream, really—makes Harry’s hand freeze on the copper handle, not because it scares him with its suddenness, but because it’s the first time Narcissa has been honest with him today, desperately real instead of deliberately aloof.
He wonders if that, too, is on purpose, or if Robards is just the type of person who paid too much attention in Interrogation Techniques during Auror training and this is how he thinks normal human communication works.
He takes a deep breath. His room smells like rotten fruit. He makes a face; this is why he rarely drinks. It’s not enough that it makes him feel like shit, no; his body has to mock him with perspiring alcohol through each and every one of his pores.
Friday morning greets Harry with a pounding headache. He groans; he should’ve started drinking water before the end of the night. Then he thinks of Malfoy, wonders if he’s up. If he’s in the same state as Harry. If he can hold his liqueur. If he—
He didn’t consciously think about the hundreds of mornings he’s seen Malfoy stir two teaspoons of sugar and a generous splash of milk into his tea. It just happened, like muscle memory. But Harry feels that would be odd to admit. Even if he wasn’t
“I mean... you have tonnes of money, don’t you? What’s with the wardrobe? You look like you’ve been wearing the same clothes since Hogwarts.”
Draco is still looking at the table, but he clears his throat and keeps talking. And Harry thinks, despite the calamity, despite everything that’s going on right now, that he’s so brave. So different. So full of potential. “Well—you’ve interviewed everyone you were suspicious of, right?”
Draco just sits there for a bit. Then he starts playing a song Harry doesn’t recognise. He sings, and the sound of it, his soft, silvery voice makes Harry shiver.
“In that case,” Robards says, “wouldn’t it be in everyone’s best interest if he could somehow be convinced to return to Wiltshire for the time being? Sending out a negotiator is arguably not a big enough resource to be suggestive of preferential treatment.”
Draco’s leg twitches under his hold; he looks at Harry, gaze fierce. Then he closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and says, “I want to.”
“Yeah,” Chandra interrupts. It’s no accident they’ve been partners for three years; they understand each other all too well, how the other works, what their gestures and habits mean all the way down to their nervous tics. “They’re too similar and too close in time to be a coincidence. Two bodies of would-be Death Eaters within a week. Both put on public display for all to see, with a Portkey next to them. Macnair wasn’t a mob kill.”
When Malfoy’s eyes open to lean away from the microphone and look down at the guitar, Harry’s limbs of lead let up like magic, fight or flight setting in. He chooses flight, turning abruptly on his heel and exiting the pub as quickly as he can without actually running.
“Bloody hell,” Harry mutters. He pushes his glasses up and rubs at his eyes. “Malfoy. You—you haven’t eaten meat in five years and you let me feed you beef and—fuck, Jesus, I got you butter chicken in the cafeteria—just because you didn’t want to be a bother?”
And it’s true, Christ, Harry knows it’s true, he’s always known. It’s always been there, a shapeless thought of sorts, sharpening the edge of his annoyance with Malfoy. Malfoy used to be horrible and cruel, disdainful and disgustingly arrogant. And that amorphous thought that Harry never quite moulded into full sense—the
Chandra rolls her eyes. “You didn’t think you were going to convince Head Auror Robards to greenlight this and then casually walk away and put the responsibility on someone else, surely?”
Then he remembers Narcissa’s desperation all those years ago—how she forced Snape to take an Unbreakable Vow to protect him. And her only ambition during the Battle of Hogwarts—finding her son, overshadowing fear and loyalty. Her pleading letter, and her hysterical shout when she thought Harry would leave without taking on the case. He has to admit to himself that if anyone would notice if Malfoy wasn’t being himself, it would be her.
Harry is helpless, rooted to the spot. He’s listening, watching, the soft voice of the stranger on the stage under the window captivating him.
The puzzle in Harry’s head becomes clear enough that he can’t ignore it anymore. With dawning horror, he thinks of the Portkeys. He thinks of Chandra’s evaluation—that the killer is someone who lost a child in the War. Why none of their leads went anywhere.
“Do you think—” he hesitates, chewing on the cap of his biro, “I mean, would you—how far do you reckon this person would go? Would you put people on this list, say... bureaucrats who were working in the Ministry under Pius? Or people who weren’t Death Eaters or war criminals but... their family members? Or, like, people who were, in a way, coerced into being Death Eaters, because of their family, or... they were underage or something?”
Narcissa nods and sits, all the gratitude she is capable of showing etched into the twist of her mouth and the intensity of her dark eyes. But Harry isn’t vain or cruel enough to question her again.
Harry is suddenly back in the Forbidden Forest, waiting to die a second time that day, being asked if Malfoy was alive. He can’t move. Narcissa rushes over to him and clutches his wrist, forcing him to look up at her instead of the door.
I was wrong, I wouldn’t have. I wouldn’t have said those things. Done them. Thought them. I wouldn’t have thought those things.”
“I know,” Harry says, barely a whisper. That’s all that will push past his throat. He hasn’t got his wits about him. He’s let his feet propel him forward, down the slope at a dangerous speed. He doesn’t know when that happened, but he knows—he knows very well it wasn’t this moment. It wasn’t this day, or this week.
“Your life is in danger,” Harry says. “Some lunatic is going around murdering ex-Death Eaters, and you are not protected here. The Aurors are prepared to offer you safety in Wizarding London—”
At lunchtime, Harry brings him food from the cafeteria, and pulls up a beaten plastic chair to sit with him.
That’s where he’s filed away the aftermath of it all, too. The injustice of it all. The bureaucracy that did nothing to obliterate the bad that was done—obliterating it mercilessly would have been the only way for at least the remnants of justice to restore itself. The gradual, bitter realisation that that wasn't going to happen found a way to gouge the holes in his chest into craters, letting them fester into pustulous, gaping wounds that he cannot,
Maintaining a straight face as if this were the most obvious and natural thing in the world, Harry nods. “Seeing as there is a serial killer on the loose, Auror resources are stretched thin. Round-the-clock protection, were you to stay in Muggle London, would cost the Department two Aurors, and Robards won’t hear of that. This is the only possible solution.”
Without the alcohol loosening his strains, and without Draco’s dizzying closeness, he realises the weight of his feelings, the weight of all this, and a little knot of panic slowly knits itself into a ball at the bottom of his stomach.
He finds himself thinking about that every time he wakes up, in that very moment. Like he was already dreaming about it before he awoke. He feels strange, out of place. He doesn’t know what quality to assign to Malfoy’s presence; to his job to protect him. He doesn’t know how he feels about it all, the morality of it, their history, Malfoy’s strangeness and what that means, everything. But around three a.m., when he’s drifting off again for the umpteeth time, the thought occurs to him that it doesn’t really matter if he doesn’t know what to think, as long as he knows what he needs to do.
He does what he does, things he clearly knows to be wrong, evident from how terrified he is of the repercussions. And yet he has no problem doing them up until the moment he has to own up to them. That’s something Harry will never be able to understand, nor empathise with.
He juts his chin out, looking somewhere behind the space between Harry and Chandra, still scratching at his face absentmindedly. “The only way I’m seeing this happen is if he’s placed under the care of a working Auror. That means he would have to give up whatever he’s doing in the Muggle world for the time being, though. That or nothing.”
, and that isn’t even the issue. He just really doesn’t want to deal with their inevitable reactions, or put energy into explaining himself. He has enough on his plate as it is.
They land painfully. Harry is disoriented and dizzy, and the first thing he does, instinctively, is reach for Draco to make sure he’s okay. A terrible mistake, he realises, when he hears a voice behind him.
Harry doesn’t know when Draco started going through his vinyl collection, only that the second bottle of wine is almost empty now, and they’re both sitting on the floor in front of the sofa.
In the beginning, after the War, they would gather with everyone at the Leaky, hoping that ordering Firewhiskey by the bottle would help them forget for a few hours. But all it did was fill the gaps of silence with heaviness, until someone eventually said “do you guys remember…” and someone would croak out a “yeah”, and loss would settle like smoke over their table, so heavy Harry had felt like his lungs gradually filled up with nothing but sadness every single time.
Harry laughs a little; it comes out forced and breathy. “But... I think you just have to kind of be—good. You know? You can’t change the past. But you can decide to be a good person. And being good... it just means doing good things. I think that—that might be something worth holding onto.”
Harry laughs. “I still have some of my clothes from Hogwarts, actually.” He shrugs. “I just never really cared, to be honest.”
But on some level, he knows that Malfoy knows this, and on a whole different level, his own promise occurs to him: that he will stop this train of tender thoughts and focus on his job. This is definitely outside of the bounds of that. So instead, he just smiles. He smiles normally, not too bright and not too intimate, just friendly, exuding professionalism.
Harry pauses and waits for Malfoy to say something, but he doesn’t; he just looks at Harry, eyes searching as if he doesn’t know if Harry is being serious. “You
When Draco doesn’t get any more than that despite his quirked eyebrows and stare, he sighs. “You didn’t get anywhere with the interviews?”
Chandra laughs, sharp and startling; she hasn’t spoken up in so long Harry has nearly forgotten she was in the room. “Leaving without discussing the details of your temporary entourage?” she asks.
Malfoy is pouring them both a glass when Harry tunes back in, and Harry looks at the inside of his wrist, the tendons in the middle crafted and silky-looking.
So Harry makes breakfast and tries not to think about Malfoy. And, like when one is instructed not to think about the elephant, all he thinks about is Malfoy.
Nighttime finds Harry restless. He wakes up every few hours, like he’s sleeping in someone else’s house for the first time. Come to think of it, no one has ever used his guest room other than Hermione and Ron; he doesn’t like the idea of sharing his space. And it’s beyond bizarre that the one exception he’s made—was forced to, really—was for Draco Malfoy, of all people.
He just has to push it back out, where it’s been lying for years. He’s done it with so many things, people, places, memories—he can do it again. Focus on work, be professional, solve the case, don’t let anyone else die. Don’t let Malfoy die. That’s all he has to do.
. His gaze doesn’t leave the table. “Well, then what if it’s—it’s someone else, or something else? Someone you wouldn’t suspect, normally, like, I don’t know, a centaur, or—” he huffs out a little breath. “I don’t know, you’re the Aurors. I just—maybe you need to think outside the box. Maybe consider that this isn’t like the cases you’ve had before, and so—and so you need to have a different approach too.”
Harry stares, then glances over to the window. Malfoy seems to be immersed in his book. “So... does that mean that Malfoy—”
“Wait,” Malfoy says, his eyes glued to one of the paragraphs on the parchment. “I—I have to come to work with you? As in, I’ll have to come to the Ministry every single day?”
“What do you think it means,” Draco starts slowly, softly, still trying to search Harry’s face patiently, “that a future version of Diggory went after—went after me like that? To punish you, or, as he said, to make you feel the pain he’s feeling—losing someone prematurely?”
Malfoy stops chewing and looks at Harry with wide eyes. Then he looks away again, chews slowly, and dabs at his mouth with a napkin. “I guess that’s the pretend friendliness out the window,” he says quietly.
“I suppose everyone thinks some tremendously significant thing happened to me,” Draco continues. “Something tragic. Or some grand adventure. But the truth is... nothing really happened. That’s—that’s the point, you know? That’s what gave me pause, I—my mother and father sent me to France to get me away from all of it, you know. The people, the hatred, everything. Told me I could come back when it all died down.”
Chandra takes his face in both hands, forcing him to look at her. “Listen to me. You didn’t fuck up. Not any more than I did. There was no way for either of us to know. We did our job. We did our best. Okay?” She glances at Draco. “Did he do something to him? Or just a Stupefy?”
He was wrong. So wrong. Making breakfast for Malfoy, sitting together at Harry’s small kitchen table, does not feel like the start of whatever the fuck he thought it would be the start of. It just feels weird and uncomfortable and out of place. Well, Malfoy does, specifically.
Malfoy just looks at him, so vulnerable and open that it makes Harry’s stomach ache. He’s shaking, too, and Harry doesn’t think it’s a good idea to make him go on. He’s said enough, more than Harry thought he would, more than he thought was behind this all.
He thinks maybe it’s about becoming overly aware of yourself. A state where every miniscule movement of muscle in your face, every word that passes through the filter of your brain is controlled—calculated.
Harry searches Malfoy’s face, looking for a sign—of anger, maybe. Irritation at the very least. But there’s nothing. So Harry carries on.
for chicken.” She shrugs and takes a bite. “I like it. I think it would do both you and Ronald some good if you reined in your food prejudices and tried some new things from time to time.”
them. And so he doesn’t have to have words for them, at least not for now. He feels Draco on top of him, feels the weight of him, feels his thighs clenching and unclenching around his hips.
“Go home, Harry.” The look Chandra is giving him, the rare instance of her use of his first name—not
It doesn’t have to be heavy and serious, though. “So,” he starts, not even knowing where he’s headed, just that he wants to go somewhere, “what about the music, then? Have you always had an interest? I didn’t know.”
Harry puts his tea down. “I don’t think you have anything to do with the murders,” he says slowly. “I might have—I did, for a while. Or rather, I thought you might be hiding something. If you haven’t noticed, you’ve changed your tune quite a bit since I last saw you. And as a matter of fact, yes, Malfoy, I actually expect you to believe I’m trying my best to keep you safe.”
When they both try to suppress a yawn at the same time, and Harry collects their plates and glasses, Malfoy wordlessly picks up a kitchen cloth and dries whatever Harry washes.
Malfoy just keeps looking at him with that aloof expression. “I’m not going to lie to you, Malfoy. There are certainly people out there who are overjoyed about these murders.”
is the Malfoy he knows, the snooty bastard spitting his name with unadulterated disdain, the grisly sneer fitting his pointed features so perfectly that for the first time since he’s got himself into this entire mess, Harry feels like the world has finally righted itself.
And that’s what finally makes Narcissa’s expression shift, although only slightly; she sighs and closes her eyes briefly. “I suppose you could say that, yes. He’s out. He has been for the better part of four years.”
Harry unfolds the parchment, and his eyes automatically skip to the signature at the bottom. His breath rushes up sharply from the pit of his stomach, catching in his throat.
“You’ve always been so no-nonsense,” Malfoy says. “So straight to the point.” He pauses, takes a deep drag on his cigarette, and says, “I’m still... the same person, I still feel like myself. I just feel like... the ideas I had were so wrong and bad that—that I am somehow wrong and bad myself. You know? And I have to, I feel like I have to be a different person entirely, from the bottom up, so I try, but then—then I don’t feel real.”
Harry tries to think of a way to discreetly confirm it is Malfoy they are both talking about, but he can’t think of one that wouldn’t add to this girl’s—Katie, the postbox says—suspicions about him, so he decides against it.
Malfoy looks at him, deadpan, grips the strap of his duffel bag and starts walking. “Wearing what? Use your words, Potter.”
“Clearly,” Harry snaps, and then instantly regrets it. He rubs at his eyes. “Sorry, it’s just—sorry. We haven’t got anywhere at all, and—and now they know Malfoy is staying with me. That’s an extra source of stress I didn’t need.”
to do with this! Everything to do with what you deserve—you ignored me, you ignored my suffering, so he—so he has to die. This is the only way you will truly know what it feels like. What it feels like to be robbed of the light of your life too soon, what it feels like to live with the knowledge that years—
Draco stands up and walks towards them, pulling his chair behind him. He sits down next to Harry. He’s close enough that Harry can smell the sweet scent of him.
But he has been aware. He’s had different levels of clarity on the matter for years, depending on how honest he feels with himself on a given day. Or how much alcohol he’s consumed. And, well, he’s very aware of it now.
“There’s an Apparition lock on the Ministry outside of the Atrium. But if you want to, we can make sure people don’t recognise you.”
As soon as the door closes behind him, he realises the music he initially thought to be coming from speakers is actually live, an acoustic concert performed by a single guy sitting on a small stage by the window in the far right corner, playing the guitar and singing. The tables are surprisingly packed for a Tuesday night.
Harry stares at the top of Malfoy’s head, his messy, floppy cut. He realises, with another painful little squeeze, that he has locks of white hair hidden among the blond. “Come on,” he says as gently as he can without sounding patronising. He crouches down, draws his wand slowly.
Draco’s head whips around to him. His eyes are wide, and the colour spreads from his cheeks; almost like he wasn’t expecting Harry to call his bluff. And if anything, that makes Harry feel more confident; like he isn’t the only one whose heart is about to beat right through his chest.
Nonsensically, the first thing Harry thinks is that he has forgotten how tall he was. He’s wearing a bathrobe, a forest green one, his hair is sticking up everywhere like he's just woken up, and he’s holding a mug that slips out of his hands when his eyes land on Harry, crashing to the floor.
“Stop being a drama queen. All she said is that you were somewhat obsessed with him in school, and kept saying the same thing you’re saying now—”
Malfoy shrugs, but Harry doesn’t miss the tense set of his shoulders. “But then, when my father left that time, she called me into the dining room where my father played his classical music, and told me to sit. Then she pulled out a record, hidden behind some books on the shelf, and put it on the turntable.”
While Harry is busy resting his hands on his stomach after his pie, Malfoy sets down a bottle of wine on the table.
Harry doesn’t know what Malfoy is trying to prove. If he’s even trying to prove something. So he just nods, and they Apparate.
The sick sense of satisfaction grows in his stomach when Narcissa’s expression remains neutrally pleasant.
And for the first time since the beginning of this calamity, Harry doesn’t feel like he doesn’t know what’s going on. He’s still not sure he knows things, but he
The thought of seeing Malfoy after all these years unsettles him; Malfoy doesn’t belong to the forefront of his thoughts. Harry has taken meticulous care to tuck him away at the back, along with the memories of the War, and Sirius and the Veil, and Lupin and Fred and Dumbledore, the many holes Voldemort ripped in his chest.
But Narcissa is right. He is the Harry Potter who, despite it all, turns the other cheek. And he is too exhausted, too hurt to dwell on whether that is because he’s irredeemably good or because he’s irredeemably vain.
So, he tells himself again, half-asleep but abuzz with strange nerves at the same time, it doesn’t matter if he doesn’t quite know how he feels about this, as long as what he does feels right.
“He isn’t,” Malfoy interrupts. “He needs to leave, unfortunately.” His eyes, sharp as steel, cut to Harry.
“So... suppose you’re right and something is off. Do you actually think—do you mean he might be involved in the case?”
He takes a deep breath before he knocks on the front door of Malfoy’s house, his heart beating so loud in his chest he can almost hear it. He would be embarrassed for the hitch in his breath when the door opens if he’d have time to dwell on it, but he doesn’t, because it’s Malfoy who stands in the doorway.
Harry is so incredibly glad to have him as his boss. Even if his questions are nerve-wracking sometimes, and Harry often has no idea what he wants or if he thinks Harry is a good Auror at all, his professionalism is evident. Even if he’s not fond of Malfoy, he doesn’t show it, tone neutral and matter-of-fact.
They’re in the graveyard in Little Hangleton. In the exact same spot Cedric died all those years ago.
They’re complete opposites—Harry doesn’t at all feel connected to how he looks, unless he wants to impress someone. Most of his clothes he’s owned for years. Half of Malfoy’s
Harry stares. First at Chandra, who looks like she’s trying not to laugh. Then at Robards, whose nose is slightly scrunched up, his eyebrows arched in a perfect, wordless rendition of
“Merlin’s beard, Harry, calm down.” Chandra fixes him with a curious look. “He’s probably gone to the loo or something.”
“Mr Diggory,” Harry says slowly, swallowing his panic and his desperation at seeing Draco unconscious, wand pressed against his throat. He channels the calm in the storm he’s had to use so many times before. In this exact same place, too. “Think about what you’re doing here.”
It’s just that the sweat that beads in the dip above his top lip whenever Robards calls him in hurts his pride a bit; the Head Auror has this thing where instead of just straight-up saying what he wants, he asks all these questions that maybe Harry is supposed to know the answer to, but he doesn’t.
“May I?” he asks Harry, voice shaky. Harry nods, unable to speak. His heart is beating so fast he’s not sure he isn’t going to die. If, after everything, someone was able to kill him, Harry has no doubt it would be Draco. If anyone could be the death of him, it would be Draco.
Then they pop into Eeylops to buy Harry’s owl, Hendrix some food. “After Jimi?” Malfoy’s eyes light up. “Yes,” Harry says back, trying his damndest not to look too proud of himself.
Harry clears his throat. “You sing, right? So—well, you haven’t played the guitar or sang anything since you’ve been here.”
Harry closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. He doesn’t know if it’s his attention span or his memory that makes him forget that that’s not at all how he needs to be thinking about Malfoy, but he’s getting on his own nerves now.
about Malfoy, the way he’s changed, is so close to something he knows the name of, knows the feeling of, and yet he can’t name it, can’t empathise with it. It makes his stomach churn in a strange, unsettling way. As if his body knows how he’s supposed to feel about Malfoy’s bizarre state, but his brain is yet to catch up with it.
Malfoy takes it in stride. He looks ahead, doesn’t address anyone but the waitress—who doesn’t seem to recognise him, at least. At the same time, Harry isn’t quite sure how, he manages to look bored. As if he’s only just come back from a short holiday, not five years of complete absence, only to make his first public reappearance with Harry Potter, of all people.
Subtly enough that Harry isn’t sure it’s not his imagination, Malfoy rolls his eyes. Then he clears his throat and asks, “Where am I to sleep, then?”
Out of all the things he could look like on this already difficult morning, he categorically looks like something Harry wants to eat up.
Harry looks at him, and he wills his face to convey authority and professionalism. “That you move in with me,” he says, true Gryffindor-style. No beating around the bush, no wavering.
Malfoy looks up, eyes sharp. “Of course I regret it,” he snaps. Then his eyes widen slightly before he settles on the now ever-present expression of neutrality, as if he’s caught himself acting out of line without his own permission. But he tilts his chin slightly upwards, levelling Harry with a determined look from behind half-lidded, serious eyes. “Stop acting like you don’t know I’ve changed.”
“Aliyah Pittman. Hammond and Moore have been tracking her these past months. American. Suspected to have come to the UK under the pretence of an internship with the International Magical Cooperation Department. Her real intentions were more along the lines of a blood purity movement of her own in the US, for which she most probably hoped to gain inspiration from sealed Ministry War files. A Death Eater revivalist, if you will.”
Malfoy shrugs. “I don’t know. You’ve always been—you’re still how you are, in the ways that matter. Ways that make the... the core of you.” He fidgets, then, tries to tuck a non-existent lock of hair from his face behind his ears. “But you’ve also become… something else.” He flicks his eyes up at Harry. “I think you’ve just grown.”
They eat dinner in silence. Harry did his best to cook something good that is vegetarian but that also isn’t his Arrabbiata, because playing that card twice would be lame. Draco goes to smoke on the balcony after dinner. His words keep echoing in Harry’s head.
“Yeah.” Draco puts down his guitar and gets up from the armchair. He walks over to Harry and sits down right in front of him, cross-legged.
“Malfoy,” he shouts into the flat, and a blond head peeks out from what seems to be the kitchen right opposite the entrance. The expression on the face attached to it quickly turns from shocked to furious.
“I do,” Harry nods. “We went to school together, and we were, erm, friends, but we lost touch a while ago. I ran into his mother a few days ago, and she told me where he lives. So I thought I’d pop by to surprise him,” he lies through his teeth.
Robards nods. “Boreas Rookwood. Some teenagers found his body by the High Street in Hogsmeade last night. Portkey next to him.”
But the feeling that settles over his skin is too nice to think about safely. If he wants to be able to have a say in how his wretched vessel of a body, his stupid brain should react to Malfoy, he has to put his foot down now.
Harry wants to say something sappy and stupid, and then he catches himself, but the next thing he wants to say is also sappy and stupid, and so he has to pause for a bit to think. Finally, he just says “whatever you want to play,” and that’s lame, he knows that. But it’s better than saying “a love song” or “something just for me”.
They both stare at him. Harry doesn’t know what to say. He hasn’t considered anything like that before. He’s been so wrapped up in thinking about who could have such a strong sense of hatred for anything to do with Death Eaters based on Chandra’s psych eval.
“That’s okay, Padma,” Harry says, even though it’s not. It’s not okay at all, and he’s such a useless wanker—Christ, how could he be that stupid? How did he not think to conceal the fact that Draco was living with him?
Harry thinks of many possibilities. That someone is polyjuicing themselves to look like Malfoy, and the real Malfoy is chained up in a hole under a trunk. It would explain why he hasn’t been the same since he’s returned from France. Or perhaps he’s under the Imperius curse, a furious Muggleborn playing an elaborate prank on him. Or maybe someone is blackmailing him.
He stops, trying to think, for once, about what he wants to say before actually saying it. “I guess it was easier to see things black and white, then. It was such a crazy fucking time. Crazy enough without having to contemplate, like... moral ambiguity. There was no time. Someone was either good or bad, and—and that had to be, really—it had to be determined by their actions.” He swallows. “It was a crazy fucking time. You understand?”
“In London,” Narcissa replies. She looks at him for a few seconds, wordless, mouth slightly open like she can’t bring herself to continue. But she eventually does, and adds, quieter than before, “Muggle London.”
His eyes cut to Harry. “I don’t know how it must look from the outside. What you must think of it. Me being this way.” He swallows, his Adam’s apple bobbing with the movement of it. “But—it’s, what I know is that I don’t—I don’t want to be here.” Then he seems to realise what he’s just said. “Here as in—here, protected by you. I don’t want to be—saved.”
Then they’re in Diagon Square. Harry can’t help but remember that the last time he was here, there was a dead body in the fountain. Shit, maybe this was a bad idea—if the killer was after Malfoy, getting him here would be his only chance while he’s staying with Harry. An uneasy feeling overcomes him.
And even though Harry’s first feeling is annoyance, there’s something much stronger blooming under the surface when he sees the sneer on Malfoy’s face. It nearly sends him reeling with a dizzy sense of relief—
Malfoy just keeps looking at him without saying anything, and without the whiskey that helped him be brave last night, it makes Harry slightly anxious.
Harry flinches at Draco’s voice; but it’s too late. He can feel a sickening pull behind his navel, the world blurring around him, and he can just make out Draco’s body lunging towards him, grabbing his arm.
Mr Diggory scoffs. “You think I’m stupid enough to make the same mistake that let you escape after letting my son die? Don’t be daft, Harry. It was a one-way Portkey.”
Some distant part of his brain registers that Draco is laughing at him, and it tells him, with a defeated little sigh, that Draco must know now how Harry feels about him. There are quiet little questions there that he pays little attention to, like
“Well, I mean, it’s not like he’ll be missed,” Hermione shrugs. “Some people were pretty pissed he managed to avoid Azkaban again after the War, and rightfully so. I actually overheard Bronski and Yates in the morning, talking about how hungover they both were because they literally celebrated his death yesterday.” She shakes her head. “I mean, I won’t shed any tears, but to celebrate death in any case is quite morbid, isn’t it? And to defile the new fountain like that…”
. He clears his throat. “Hogwarts felt like home. It really did. But it was… a home where peace was fragile. Fleeting. So I was always just, you know, waiting for that time when things would finally right themselves. Like, completely. First, a time when I would be surrounded by people that I love and people that love me. And when that happened, for a time without Voldemort. A time without evil.”
we’ve considered a bloody dead end?” Chandra asks him on Thursday, pulling at her bangs like she does when she’s frustrated.
“All I know is that you’ve been acting like you’re another person entirely since the War.” They both flinch; but Harry propels on, fuelled by the whiskey in his blood. “But I haven’t the slightest clue why. I know you’ve developed a sense for Muggle fashion, apparently. That you live in Muggle London and haven’t set foot in the wizarding world for quite some time. That you sing in a dingy Muggle pub—”
“I’ve learnt a lot,” Draco continues, eyes back on the blood red liquid swirling in his glass. “I know about electricity. Putting out your hand at bus stops and shouting ‘Thank you!’ to the driver from the middle of the bus when you get off. The internet. Muggle wars that almost destroyed all of us, and the genocides. I’ve... it’s an interesting thing, you know, that horribly slow realisation that dawns on you. You only notice it when it becomes—when it becomes so heavy your back almost cracks under it. That they’re… like us. Exactly like us.”
That neither of them quite know how to handle the sensitivity of it, the wounds they have caused each other, the sinister thing that engulfed them in a fight that wasn’t theirs, and gave them no choice but to be what they were to each other.
“Noted,” says Harry, smiling back almost involuntarily. He really does feel like he’s but a glorified vessel for his body’s whims and fancies sometimes.
But that’s far-fetched; unrealistic, really. He hasn’t an idea what’s happened to Malfoy, in truth. And now Harry feels the urge to shake his head, rid it of thoughts that mean nothing, that are of no use other than to drive him mad, send him down a path of obsessiveness that serves no one.
Something ugly and terrible is unfolding from behind his navel, spreading to his stomach and his intestines, and he fears that if he were to open his mouth again, bile would come out.
“Look at all these people,” Malfoy says, looking out the window. “They can’t wait to run home and Firecall everyone and say,
The beginning of the week passes in a blur. Harry is busy interviewing people and setting up theories with Chandra and getting absolutely nowhere. He’s also busy trying not to let his gaze linger on Malfoy’s jawline or his mouth, not to care when he strolls into the kitchen in that stupid white shirt with his thighs and his dragon tattoo. He’s trying not to let his thoughts get away from him and build a little shrine for Malfoy in his cerebellum.
Though it’s clearly meant to be part of the back-and-forth they’ve always had, a playful counterpart to his similar enquiry a week before, Harry’s eyes darken. “Because she handed me over to Voldemort during the War, with the rest of Fenrir Greyback’s merry pack of bounty hunters. And despite the testimonies of several people, including me, she never spent a day atoning for her sins.”
“Most people are horrified, though. And they are the absolute majority. But regardless of what anyone thinks, this is a serial killer masquerading as a righteous vigilante.”
Malfoy gapes. Harry feels a strange sense of satisfaction at that. He unscrews the bottle and pours both of them a generous finger, pushing one of them towards Malfoy.
Narcissa huffs a humourless laugh. “That makes two of us, Mr Potter. What I do know is that Draco is vulnerable in the non-magical world. Unsafe. His address is not connected to the Floo Network, so you will have to Apparate as close as you can, keeping in mind it is a Muggle neighbourhood—”
Except that he isn’t, and when he enters the cafeteria at lunchtime, he finds it empty of Malfoy. His stomach grows uneasy with regret. He shouldn’t have left Malfoy just like that, what if something’s happened to him, fuck, he’s an idiot—
“But… I don’t quite get it,” Draco says, frowning. “It was you he was targeting—then why was it me he tried to kill?”
“Nothing,” Malfoy says. His voice is so small and vulnerable, and Harry hasn’t got his defenses at the ready; he doesn’t know how to dodge the saltwater waves of empathy crashing into his chest.
Harry sees it in slow motion, almost, a true pang of sympathy hitting him for the first time: the way people stop mid-conversation, the way their hurried steps stutter just to stare at Malfoy like he’s a particularly rare zoo animal. If Harry can relate to anything, it’s the utter feeling of disgust that comes with that.
And what surprises Harry isn’t his willingness to cooperate, but his demeanor in doing so; Malfoy used to be so instinctual, full of fear and pride. His reservedness, his lack of arrogance is what makes Harry most unsettled.
Harry wakes up to a strange noise. His eyes are heavy with exhaustion and his mind is too groggy to register the sound at first, then—running water. His bleary confusion gives way to a jolt of realisation when he recognises it to be the shower.
Malfoy looks at him again, fierce. His voice is so quiet now that Harry can barely hear him. “ Because I don’t deserve to be.”
But Harry has never thought Malfoy had a soft mouth before, and he does now; almost pliant in a way. And he’s almost sure it’s not the Firewhiskey. Malfoy
He doesn’t want to see how Malfoy must look when he pushes the doors open. It’s enough to hear his deep, shaky intake of breath.
The blush has spread from Malfoy’s ears to the apples of his cheeks now, and Harry can’t stop looking at it. “Five years.”
Harry deflates at once. “Of course,” he says, and sets out in the direction of the cafeteria bathrooms.
“Alright,” Chandra says, rolling her eyes. “Let’s start with the obvious. Someone could be playing a prank on you.”
Harry’s breath stutters, and he gets a bit annoyed with that, scolds his silly, giddy brain—he doesn’t want
And Harry also realises, with a little flip of his stomach, that it was Malfoy who initiated this one. He was the brave one, not Harry. He smiles at that, and thinks that’s something he can say out loud. And take over, too, take the next step of bravery on this awkward path.
“Anything?” Chandra asks him when he returns to the room. He can see from the corner of his eye that Draco is looking his way too.
“Well, besides the fact that he’s an elitist little shit living the life of a Muggle, he was very reluctant to come with me yesterday. He insisted he didn’t need the Aurors to protect him.”
It’s Arrabbiata too, his specialty. Not to impress Malfoy, but because he had everything in his pantry for making it.
“Where are your house elves?” The words tumble out of Harry’s mouth without his permission, but he doesn’t have time to berate himself for them before Narcissa gives him a tiny, crooked smile.
They talk about the case; Malfoy tells him a little bit about his life in London, but never France. They laugh, sometimes. All in all, it’s not strained, but it’s also not something better or warmer than that.
With each reverberating sound, Harry’s heart beats just a bit stronger and faster. He takes a deep breath. He feels hyper-aware of his every move, and although Draco is not looking at him, Harry is afraid he’ll somehow figure out what’s happening. That Harry is trembling with the sound of Draco’s voice, the movement of his fingers on the guitar. That he’s so in love with him it makes him dizzy.
Despite his inner voice of increasing volume the closer he gets to actually doing what he’s about to, he still does it: he Apparates to Malfoy Manor after a final gulp of lukewarm coffee, and he can’t say he’s surprised when the black gates, all chipped paint and rusty hinges, sluggishly creak open in front of him without a word. He takes a deep breath before stepping onto the gravel path leading to the Manor.
He takes in Draco’s hands. The tense set of his shoulders. His collarbone peeking out from under his askew shirt. The way his lips are pressed into one hard, nervous line. How he looks anywhere but at Harry.
They walk in silence, Malfoy a few paces in front of Harry, then he finally asks, “How long am I meant to be a... a
The next morning, Malfoy looks mildly disappointed when Harry tells him that despite it being Saturday, he has to go to work. He can’t afford to rest the entire weekend, not while he’s working on the biggest case he’s had probably since he’s started at the Aurors. Chandra and him are planning to pore over the forensic reports of the victims once more, see if they maybe missed something the first time.
And so he comes to the maddening, dizzying conclusion that none of it matters. That he can't control the tide. That the storm is always going to be stronger than any flimsy dam he builds to fight it.
“Oh, but Harry, that’s all I’ve been thinking about. That’s all I’ve been thinking about for years. And I tried, I really tried to go about it the nice way. I came to you, I asked for your help, but you refused. Pretended like you had nothing to do with the fact that my son was dead. That you had no responsibility to help me bring him back. But it’s all your fault, Harry. And you’re getting what you deserve.”
He hasn’t even righted himself properly when he hears something that sounds suspiciously like wine glasses being set on the table. Then the sound of a bottle opening.
Harry remembers what Hermione said a few days ago about rightful anger, sheds no tears, and moves on with his life and his cases.
Harry steals looks at him when he goes to sip his tea: he’s sitting with one of his legs drawn up on the chair, socked feet hanging off the edge of the seat, head bent above his plate, picking at his toast and chewing slowly, like he’s waiting for someone to berate him.
Harry turns off the lights with a flick of the wrist. He pulls the soft blanket off the sofa and spreads it over them both. Their legs tangle together, and Draco’s arms come up around him. Harry cradles the back of his neck, pressing a soft kiss to his forehead. Warmth spreads through him everywhere they touch. They sleep.
Harry can feel his heart squeeze so hard in his chest he almost clutches at it. Whatever he feels for Draco, whatever this is—it has, for all intents and purposes, broken through his carefully constructed dams, resurfacing from under the river of Lethe, stronger than ever—fuelled by the wine in his blood, by Draco’s darling face under the soft ceiling lights, his utter vulnerability.
“Thank you,” Harry says. Sometimes, he’s hit with the realisation that Chandra is the best thing that’s happened to him at the Aurors.
“I know you don’t want me here,” Malfoy says into the stretching silence, like he’s read Harry’s thoughts. His voice slices sharply across the strange, quiet atmosphere. “I know you’re uncomfortable with it, and I—I don’t blame you.” He casts his eyes down, pressing his lips together. “After all I did to you, to your friends, and just, just me being part of all that utter shite—”
Malfoy nods, relief relaxing some of the tension in his mouth. Harry tries to think of what to say; it has to be something of equal value to Malfoy’s thing, something he’s not comfortable saying.
“Not possible to you, daft boy. In the future it is.” His face turns bitter. “And what do you know, there are more surprising things in the future than an unrestricted Time Turner.”
The platform sneakers from before have made a return. They’re paired with light wash jeans, strings hanging out all over the bottom. But Harry suspects that’s a fashion thing. Over his cream jumper, he’s wearing a deep purple windbreaker. Harry notes how well it matches with his own jumper.
Narcissa is unfazed. “I have to warn you, Mr Potter—he will not be pleased about your visit, nor will he want to accept your help. But please... do not be deterred by his demeanor. He needs help, and if you don’t give it to him, no one will.”
“Exactly,” Harry nods. “He wasn’t. We have reason to think that this killer, whoever they are, is out for revenge. And Theo wasn’t the only victim who never committed a serious crime. This person will go after anyone who has ties to Death Eaters and hasn’t got punished for it.”
Malfoy never invites him in, so Harry spends an awkward ten minutes talking to Katie outside the house, answering questions about friendships and anecdotes and classes that never happened. He has to make it all up on the spot, and he hopes he is vague enough not to contradict anything Malfoy might have told her during their who knows how long friendship; he’s really not in the mood to deal with the paperwork that comes with obliviating a Muggle right now.
He keeps thinking about that, turning it over and examining it from every angle he can, even after they’ve exhausted all the theories they could come up with and agreed that the best thing would be for Harry and Draco to Apparate home.
“But you did,” Harry’s mouth blurts without his own permission. Malfoy looks at him, carefully intrigued. He propels on. “Malfoy, you were ten years old. How were you supposed to realise such a thing? Did you even know it was Muggle music she was playing you?”
Harry smiles at him, so content and full of love that he thinks, madly, like he’s never going to feel anything else. Just this. Just Draco.
Malfoy sticks by him when they arrive in the Ministry, and settles by the window again. He nods at Chandra when she enters the room. She waves and settles in the chair opposite Harry.
He smiles a little, flicking his eyes up at Harry before looking away again. “She preferred Muggle music, too. I don’t think she ever thought anything of it, though. For her, that was just coincidental. Most people would stop and think—wonder if that means Muggles weren’t so bad after all. She didn’t.” His face twists. “Clearly,
Chandra snorts. “That you are. It’s more of a hunch than a sure thing. Rookwood and Nott—neither of them could be considered the worst of the worst, if we were to take account of everything, really. Their biggest sin was arguably that they were born to the wrong parents. It fits the vigilante pattern. To lose a child produces the maddest sort of grief of all.”
Malfoy just looks at him, presses his lips together for a second. Then says, in his quiet way, “Yes.”
It’s also an entirely unseemly place for Malfoy to live. He even owled Narcissa back to make sure she got the address right. Not only does Malfoy live in the Muggle world, but instead of Kensington or Mayfair or somewhere equally as posh, he apparently lives in bloody East London. A place completely outside the realms of the luxurious hauteur he grew up in, filled to the brim with working class people instead. The more Harry learns about this case, the more puzzled he becomes.
As he walks, he can’t help but notice the yarrow springing up between the little stones the path is made of, the tussocks of weed rustling softly under his shoes; he files them away, right next to the chipping paint and the creaking hinges, and somehow, strangely, it puts him at ease.
Harry shakes his head. “Not really, no. The official case eval came out this morning, but there was nothing in it we hadn’t already figured out by ourselves. Macnair had been involved in the illegal dragon egg trade since the end of the War. The evaluation concluded that revenge and intimidation were probably behind the public display of the body. Nothing new there.”
He’s vibrating with nerves, alight with the urge to protect Draco. He’s been reluctant to let him out of his sight since the arrival of the unsigned, cryptic letter. After they came out of their shock last night and Draco announced he was going to sleep, Harry almost told him he was to sleep in Harry’s room. Then thought better of it and put up a charm in his room instead that would alarm Harry if there was any movement in or around him during the night.
“I know you want to know,” Malfoy says, mellow. Harry barely even notes that it’s happened again—Malfoy guessing his thoughts. “And I get it. If you’d disappeared and come back after five years, I’d want to know, too.” He laughs. “In fact, I’d be pestering you about it constantly.”
He opens his desk drawer and takes out a piece of parchment, unrolling it and placing it in front of them. “Please read it thoroughly before signing,” he says.
Draco’s voice shocks him out of his thoughts. As if he’s been admiring a beautiful animal, and has forgotten the fence separating them was electrified. He grins at Harry; not smugly, but genuinely, like this were a joke they were both in on. And if anything, that catches Harry more off guard than his blatant call-out.
There’s a white owl sitting in the open kitchen window, and Harry instantly thinks it’s Robards; that they found another dead body. He walks to the window, takes the parchment and unfolds it. As soon as his eyes scan over the short letter and he grasps what the words mean, he freezes.
His eyes are on Harry, resolute. Harry has never been so terrified. And he knows, in the instant that he thinks that, that it’s an exaggeration. But it rings real and true all the same. And he’s shaking with it. He needs to swallow against the lump in his throat.
Well, almost: Harry doesn’t miss Chandra’s quiet snort from behind her cubicle, but he’s also glad that at least
Chandra hums thoughtfully. “Hard to say. Pittman is the only victim who wasn’t a Death Eater, but she was an adult who wasn’t coerced into anything. And based on Hammond and Moore’s case reports, she was a full-blown blood supremacist ready to commit actual genocide.” She pauses, considering. “I don’t really know names like you do around here, Potter—”
Harry supposes that Malfoy does sense it, because he doesn’t bring any more bottles of wine to Harry, or suggests spending time together outside of mealtimes. Or maybe he doesn’t sense it, maybe he simply doesn’t want to spend time with Harry when not necessary.
“So, for a long time, I didn’t even know what music was, really. Then, when I must have been around ten, my father went away for a few days. Business trip. And my mother, she... you see, she was a strange creature. She never really minded anything, never really cared about any of my father’s eccentricities, she just… accepted them. She never tried to fight him, but I don’t think it was because she was weak. She simply… didn’t care enough to.”
Chandra gives him one of her looks. The one where she narrows her eyes so subtly that it took Harry months to pick up on it, then jerks her head slightly to the left. Harry has figured it out to mean she’s not happy with the direction a conversation is going. “What do you suggest we do, then?”
Draco sits back on his knees and looks away. “I’m not,” he mutters. And that’s when Harry notices the faint flush on his cheeks; the way he clutches at his jeans. And oh—
Malfoy looks at him, then. Purses his mouth in that way that Harry has come to understand is embarrassment with himself. But he doesn’t say anything, just shrugs. And Harry really wants to say something, grab him and shake him and tell him it’s okay, that he doesn’t have to apologise for existing or requiring things, that he doesn’t have to keep punishing himself and not letting himself have anything.
Harry looks at the greyish strings hanging precariously off Hermione’s outheld fork, imagines it’s overcooked chicken, and quickly bites it off.
Chandra lets out a breath. “It’s someone who knows what they’re doing. Patil is the best at what she does.”
“Shut up,” Chandra replies. “Brainstorm with me.” She slams a piece of parchment and a quill on the table. “We need to get somewhere. I know you’re more involved in every way imaginable, but—but it’s driving me insane too. Let’s get somewhere with this.”
But he’s also aware of why he hasn’t allowed people like Malfoy to be part of his life for years—why he’s buried them to die under the river of Lethe. Why Hermione always wears long-sleeved shirts when she’s around him. Why Ron subtly mentions to him if Bill is going to be present at lunch at the Burrow. And fuck him if he knows what to do with these two very opposing…
Harry takes in his face; returns to his previous observation of Mr Diggory looking way older than he should. And the only explanation for that is—
to, because one, they suck and I hate them, and two, Lewisham kebab is not shitty. It’s the best kebab in all of London actually.”
And their attention doesn’t pass fast enough not to realise who it is standing there, in the middle of the Ministry Atrium, after a five-year disappearing act: Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater. Son of Lucius Malfoy, one of Voldemort’s most loyal followers up until the very end—well, almost.
Chandra looks away, a faint flush of shame colouring the highs of her cheeks. A rare sight, and Harry detests being the cause of it, even if he didn’t say anything he shouldn’t have. Many cases of injustice were left unaddressed after the War, and Harry could never entirely stop being bitter about it.
He takes long in the shower, meticulously scrubbing at his skin. And as he comes to his senses, as the events of last night crash into him in waves the more he wakes up under the hot spray of the shower head, the harder he scrubs at himself.
Just when Diego jumps in front of Manny to save his life, and Draco gasps like he hasn’t just admitted he’s seen the film at least ten times, a loud knock coming from the window startles them both.
“Hey,” he says, soft and calming. He reaches out a hand and squeezes Malfoy’s arm. Malfoy’s eyes follow the movement. “I think that’s enough for now. Thank you for telling me.”
But maybe, he thinks, it’s not just that, but also something more rational. A kind of dim understanding that Malfoy has gone through something meaningful that simply can’t be ignored.
different from the Draco he had known at school, the boy who would have sneered at the very idea of wearing Muggle clothes, of such blatant immodesty.
“Whoah,” Harry manages. Malfoy points at his glass, indicating for him to follow suit. So Harry does.
Harry contemplates his answer. He has to be careful with how he words this; he knows Chandra has already caught on to the fact that he and Malfoy have history, and he doesn’t want her to think this has anything to do with that. Because it doesn’t.
After the first, Harry pours them another one. And another one. And another one. Neither of them talk. In the utter silence of the night, with not even the telly on as a comforting source of white noise in the background, Harry grows oddly unnerved. The way the whiskey splashes into their glasses, the way he can hear himself swallow, the way the glass thuds dully back onto the coaster as he puts it down—it all suddenly sounds loud and important.
“If he told you anything about the future, don’t tell me. This… this is unprecedented. We have no idea of the magnitude of the damage he’s done to the timeline by coming back to the past and killing those people. The folks over at Mysteries are handling it, but they told me flat out that they can’t tell us anything other than the fact that Diggory is confined and that he’s not going anywhere. And you both have to take a Vow of Secrecy. Tomorrow. I told them you were both exhausted and needed to sleep now.”
“I packed up and left in the middle of the night one day. Went to a Muggle hotel, simply because I didn't know the area well. It was there that it occurred to me first. That I needed to experience the Muggle world. I—don’t exactly know why, even now.” He says, frowning.
“I am beyond grateful you have decided to take on my request, Mr Potter,” Narcissa says, settling into the armchair across from him. Still, no house elves appear to be present, nor does an offer of tea.
They sit quietly for a while. They look at each other sometimes, but mostly at the table. Malfoy rests his chin on his knees. Harry pinches his bottom lip, rolling it between his thumb and forefinger.
Harry doesn't trust his voice to be steady, so he tilts his chin up slightly, and hopes that translates to
Draco doesn’t look up, keeping his eyes on his guitar. Harry feels lightheaded. Warm. He swallows, and the sound of it is lost in the continuing echo Draco creates.
He thinks about all the moments that have led here—him sitting at his kitchen table with Draco. He thinks about how he didn’t see any of them coming, but he didn’t need to. The present was enough. Being there was enough.
“It’s not from Chandra.” Harry picks up the little purple aeroplane and frowns at it. “It has Robards’ insignia.” He carefully unfolds the memo and quickly scans the hastily written lines. His sharp intake of breath immediately puts Hermione on edge.
“He isn’t. He came back just after the first anniversary of the War, but… not here. He returned only to pack a suitcase and left again. Something happened to him in France. He has never talked about it, but it’s the only explanation for why he became so—” Her mouth twists into a sneer as she cuts herself off, and Harry notes that Malfoy gets it from her, his signature look of contempt, not his father, “—different,” she finishes.
As Malfoy opens his mouth, a protest at the ready without a doubt, Harry quickly continues. “Of course, the best option would be if you were to move back in with your mother for the time being—”
“I mean, I—I think, considering the unusual circumstances—were the killer to attack Malfoy in Muggle London, the best case scenario would be that a lot more resources have to be put into obliviating potential witnesses and cleanup,” Harry starts. “The worst case scenario would be... well, endangering or even killing Muggles. I don’t think it would qualify as preferential treatment to put an Auror or two on him. Outside his house and wherever he goes to work. If he does work. I have no idea of his circumstances,” he finishes awkwardly. He chances a look at Chandra, but he can’t tell what she thinks at all.
All he knows is that his entire childhood was spent in the shadow of his family’s hatred and bigotry. Harry stills. Rookwood Jr was not a Death Eater; he was merely the son of one, not unlike—
Harry explains the cryptic reason Diggory gave for why he was going to kill Draco. Draco stares at him, expressionless at first. Then his cheeks fill with colour, and his mouth falls open.
“Yeah,” Harry says slowly. “I need to go. And so does William.” Malfoy’s eyes widen again, and he opens his mouth, but Harry is faster. “You see, Katie, the reason I was over the moon when I ran into his mum was actually because all of us who were friends at school are planning a big trip to, erm, Italy. We went there on a school trip once, and it turns out that one of the guys bought the hotel we were in at the time,” he says.
Harry looks up. Chandra—Chandra is here. Mr Diggory is disarmed. Draco is okay. Harry closes his eyes, takes a deep breath. “Chandra,” he says, his voice breaking. “Chandra, I—I really fucked up, I—he could have died.” His breath catches in his throat with the realisation of just how close he was to that. How close he was to losing Draco.
Robards has never cared to make small talk, to share details about his or ask any questions about his subordinates’ personal lives. Perhaps, Harry thinks, it isn’t so much that he doesn’t care to, rather than takes care
It’s dawning on him just how bizarre this situation is. Having Malfoy in his flat is one thing, but for them to talk like this, for Malfoy to share such a delicate memory with him, for Harry to come to his defense—it’s so inside out, so foreign and new that it scares him, because he doesn’t know where it’ll go next, and whether he’ll know what to do with it.
Harry looks at him. His best guess is that Malfoy is a coward, like he always has been, and he ran away from the confrontations he inevitably would have had to face in the wizarding world. That’s the obvious explanation for why he doesn’t want to go back; but his whole reservedness about being a potential target doesn’t fit the picture at all.
He reads the rest of Chandra’s report in silence. They discuss a few possible directions to go in, decide who to interview in the following days, and make a list of people to put under light surveillance.
“Why’d you wear those damn Muggle clothes to the Ministry?” Harry hisses at him. He almost instantly regrets it, but Malfoy’s sudden, sharp gaze on him propels him on. “If—well, you bloody well knew people were going to stare anyway, didn’t you? Why make it worse by
As soon as he steadies himself in his living room, he walks over to the kitchen and reaches for a whiskey tumbler on the shelf. One of his shittier ones.
He’s about to slam the door in Harry’s face for the second time this morning, and Harry has to act fast, so he says, before the door closes, “The last victim was Theo Nott.”
He looks away from his wine glass and at Harry, eyes desperate in a way Harry has seen them before, and he didn’t understand it then, what Draco needed him to know, but he does now.
Harry nods and scowls at Malfoy’s perfect pronunciation. He stands rigidly against the thrumming that grows under his skin at Malfoy’s newfound friendliness, his physical closeness.
There are several advantages to having lunch in Hermione’s office, the biggest of them being the fact that it’s so far away from the Auror department that overeager colleagues will usually leave him alone for at least an hour; the biggest disadvantage is having to try Hermione’s newest bizarre food adventure almost every day.
"But those things, they’re not even what surprised me the most. Not even close,” Draco continues. He takes in a big, shaky breath. Says, as he lets it out, “Kindness caught me off guard the most. I’ve never really seen much of it around me. Nobody has ever really been kind to me. You know?”
Her mouth twists again, this time more sad than spiteful. “Suffice to say, he won’t listen. He says he is fine. Safe.” Her eyes cut to Harry, the lines between her eyebrows deepening. “But how could he be fine? How could he be safe out there, Mr Potter?”
One that Harry frequently passes by as well, but he’s never been inside. Now it taunts him with its big, golden letters above the arched doorway, daring him to go inside. He forgot to ask Katie what Malfoy does here exactly, but he can’t really imagine him cooking or cleaning dishes. Not that he can imagine him behind the bar, serving beer, but it still seems like the more likely possibility.
So they do, Harry sitting in one corner of the U-shaped sofa by the window, Draco with his back against the other armrest, legs outstretched towards Harry.
“Oh my God,” Harry groans. “First of all, this is the second time in as many days that you’ve betrayed me—”
“I’m really just a victim here. You know? So it isn’t fair—you’re not interrogating me as an Auror, is what I’m trying to say. You’re just bloody nosy—”
They sip in silence for a few minutes. “Pinot gris,” Harry reads the label. It’s a pleasant, dry white wine. Harry isn’t big on wine, but this is good.
Who is this bloke with floppy, loose hair, sitting cross-legged on the stage of a Muggle pub in London? Who is using Malfoy’s body, singing a Muggle song, wearing jeans and a T-shirt with a Muggle rock band logo Harry doesn’t even recognise? What the bloody hell is going on?
Chandra dismisses him with a flick of her wrist. “Anyway, it’s a bit of a leap, so we can’t quite narrow down our list of suspects just yet. But it’s something to keep in mind.”
Narcissa leads him across the Manor at a swift pace, swift enough that Harry doesn’t have time to dwell on the space he’s in. She leads him through several sitting rooms and a kitchen, and comes to a stop at a set of wooden doors carved with delicate, twisting patterns that remind Harry of the Forbidden Forest. She opens the door—it’s a conservatory.
“Sit down, gentlemen,” Robards says when they enter, gesturing towards the uncomfortable chairs in front of his table. When they do, his gaze zeroes in on Malfoy. “Welcome back to the wizarding world, Mr Malfoy.”
He pauses, then, looking at Harry like he wants to ask him something, but then seems to decide against it.
It would be an understatement to say that Harry is anxious that evening when he Apparates to an alley near Malfoy’s place. Not even to a random one, but one he knows to be deserted most of the time. Because of all places, Malfoy lives in Lewisham, a neighbourhood in London Harry not only frequents because of his favourite kebab shop, but also because Ron and Hermione happen to live in the neighbouring borough of Greenwich.
And then he feels, with a greedy sense of clarity, that it’s not enough, and he grabs the back of Draco’s thighs and pulls him as close as physically possible, flush against him.
Malfoy keeps his head up, though, up until the very moment the lift doors close in front of them. His shoulders sag, then, and his chin tilts towards his chest in a way that makes him look oddly vulnerable.
So while Harry and Chandra work on the case, he sits by the window in the little meeting room, reading a book. Under the light of the unusually sunny sky, the white in his hair is more apparent.
Harry looks away, staring at his distorted reflection in the metal railing on the lift wall, jaw clenched.
He belongs in a museum, Harry thinks nonsensically. Something royal, too. The Victoria and Albert. In the middle of the room with the beautiful giant columns.
And fuck, Harry hasn’t even thought about that. How it must look that, after all this time, it’s not only that the one person Draco Malfoy shows up with after half a decade is Harry Potter, but the other way around too: Harry rarely ever goes out anymore, except when Ron and Hermione manage to drag him anywhere the person per square kilometre ratio is higher than ten. Which happens possibly twice a year.
“I don’t know,” Harry admits. “No one does. I’m on the case with my partner, but the entire department is helping out one way or another. This is the biggest case we’ve had... well, since the War, really.”
The bar is to the left, but neither of the two bartenders behind it are Malfoy. Harry supposes this is his chance to verify whether Malfoy is indeed the William living with a Muggle girl called Katie in Lewisham, or all this is somehow one giant misunderstanding.
Out of all the things Malfoy could be wearing on this ugly grey London day, he’s wearing a big white shirt, down almost to his mid-thighs, top two buttons undone. Nothing else. No poncey silk pyjamas, no forest green bathrobe, no socks. Harry notices with a little thump of his heart what is definitely the edge of a tattoo peeking out from under the baggy shirt on his thigh. It looks like the tail of a dragon.
Harry doesn’t want to understand. Even as the fog in his head is clearing—he can’t believe what he’s seeing. Even as he takes in his surroundings for the first time, and realises with a jolt of horror where they are—he refuses to.
“When I was a kid, the thing that kept me going was that my life wouldn’t have to be that way forever. I wouldn’t have to live the way I did, with those particular people. That one day, I could choose my own family, my own home, my own everything.”
Then Malfoy finally emerges, a duffel bag slung across his chest—a colour very similar to that of his bathrobe, Harry notes—and Katie hugs him and kisses him on the cheek, says she's going to miss him. Harry can’t help but wonder if they’re just flatmates who are also friends, or something more.
There’s a tense minute of silence. Then Malfoy, quiet as a mouse, mutters a “thank you” into the space between them.
Harry looks at her for a long, hard moment. A broken woman. An opportunist with hard lines between her eyebrows. Not good in the sense he prefers people to be, but loyal. He thinks about Malfoy, and he can’t conjure the words to describe him. He sighs and sits back down in the rose-patterned armchair.
Maybe it’s not about that; maybe it’s about becoming aware of your faults, your mistakes—and with that, coming to possess the ability to feel bad about them.
They go out to eat in Muggle London Friday evening. To Harry’s utter bafflement, Malfoy wants to go to a Wetherspoons, of all places. “Are you serious?” “Yes, Potter, quite. What, you take everything else in stride, but won’t accept my love for shitty pub food?”
“Theodore Nott.” The words push past his lips in a haste to get ahead the bile. “I went to Hogwarts with him.”
“There’s no going around it,” Harry says, and even though he recognises the fear on Malfoy’s face, he can’t say he feels much empathy; Malfoy is a coward who doesn’t want to face the consequences of his actions.
, but Hughes manages to slip in a few celebratory dog whistles, obvious enough to serve as a source of malicious joy for those secretly happy about the murders, but too discreet to get her in trouble.
Robards hums in agreement. “Indeed. This way we don’t lose valuable resources, but we also do our due diligence to protect those who don’t want to be protected,” he says, the ghost of a half-smile around his lips. “He will need to move in with the Auror in question for the time being, and tag along while they work. Have the cake and eat it too, all that.”
And suddenly, so easily that he wonders how he hasn’t before, Harry realises he’s not the only one who doesn’t know what to do with this thing between them—how to be brave in the face of their changing relationship, their changing attitudes to each other.
He’s known since sixth year, at least. A most inconvenient time to discover such things, really, what with people dropping around him like flies, and him and Malfoy being at the centre of it all, two opposing forces struggling to push each other out of the ring.
Chandra shakes her head. “No, and we’re probably never going to. They’re questioning him at the Department of Mysteries. They made me take a Vow of Secrecy, but the only thing they told me is that he came from the future and wanted revenge for his son’s death.”
“Sir,” he says, slowly, “if I may—if you could please kindly consider my history with Malfoy and realise I am the
When the lift doors open, he turns to Malfoy. “Don’t leave my side for a second,” he says, then starts towards the glass doors of the Department at a swift pace. He wishes he didn’t have to walk across the entire Department floor to reach Robards’ office, but he has no such luck.
He is, however, also excellent at distracting himself from things he doesn’t want to look at, so he throws everything he has into looking over the case, making sure there isn’t a single clue or sign left outside his line of vision.
Harry sighs. “Do you like lowering your head whenever you walk past the only person who’s going to be in your immediate vicinity for the foreseeable future? Spending most of your time awkwardly trying to avoid interactions with them?”
“I—I don’t—” is all he manages, and his voice shakes. His hands shake, too, when he tries to lift them. This is quite possibly the most nervous he’s ever been in his entire life.
Harry hesitates for a second before nodding. All that matters is that Draco is safe. He takes another deep breath and Apparates.
After Malfoy reluctantly signs the form, Robards takes pity on them and lets them use the Floo. As soon as Harry dusts himself off, his stomach growls embarrassingly loudly, and he realises he hasn’t eaten today.
has the courtesy to pretend like Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy walking towards Head Auror Robards’ office to sign papers to live together is not the Event of the Month.
Harry thinks about how he, too, toasted his reflection last night—with four or five fingers of his best malt, in his nicest tumbler as well. But talking about that would open up a can of worms he’s not willing to talk about out loud—about the rage stuck in his throat like phlegm since the War ended. A memo whooshes into the room before he can incriminate himself, hits him square in the forehead, and flutters softly into his lap.
“No,” Harry says. “Not at all. It’s like—it’s like we’re chasing a ghost. I’ve never had a case that—where there was such a complete lack of anything. Everything. There’s nothing.” He huffs out a frustrated breath.
Hermione rolls her eyes. “It really doesn’t. We’re not children anymore, Harry, do try and expand your palate beyond bangers and mash. Come on, just one bite. It won’t kill you.”
Draco freezes on top of him. “Ah, fuck, I’m sorry, I got carried away—” He makes to move out of Harry’s lap. Harry grabs his wrist.
Draco grins. “A genuine compliment is due for the observation there. Never took you for someone to recognise wine so quickly.”
Malfoy looks up, slightly annoyed, like he’s been expecting the reaction but still didn’t want to see it. Harry can’t help the little puff of laughter that escapes him. He holds his hands up apologetically.
Harry sighs. “Malfoy,” he starts, gentle. “I can charm your face, if you want. Would you like me to?”
Why in God’s name did he think it was a good idea to bring the person who reminds him of nothing but the War into his home, his sacred space, and spike that with the sad smoke of Firewhiskey, so heavy—
“—so I can’t help you with that, but… if it’s any help, I’d say consider anyone and everyone associated with Death Eaters and their sentiments in danger.”
“If not for the planet, then for not having to bail on literally every single charity function an hour early to have shitty kebab in Lewisham because of your aversion to finger food.”
