"I can smell you, Malfoy." Potter's voice is somewhere between a growl and a hiss, stopping Draco dead in his tracks.
"Yes, babe?" Harry replies. They're sitting out by the Lake, beneath the beech tree and staring up at the stars from beneath the Invisibility Cloak.
"What were you saying, Dobby?" I ask him, wondering what the hell had gotten him so worked up. His eyes grow to twice their size as he looks up at me tearfully. Klaus jumps onto my lap when Dobby begins to sob loudly, his shrill voice echoing in my large bedroom.
"Are" - he clears his throat - "Are you sure it's not on fire?" He asks, fear in his eyes. His gaze flits down to the floor, expecting to see bright red flames licking up from the bottom of the door.
"You're so fucking needy, aren't you?" Harry responds in his deep growl of a voice, reaching to stroke himself slowly with his free hand. "Or maybe wandless is a turn-on, hmm?" Draco nods, licking his lips at the sight before him. Thick, meaty fingers wrapped loosely around what must be the most gigantic cock in existence. Finally, Potter relents, sitting at the edge of the steaming pool and leaning backward slightly onto his elbows.
Vincent, funnily enough, was one fourth River Troll. It gave him an odd appearance - flat nose, hairy arms, wide shoulders, fat neck, etc. - but my favorite part (to laugh at), was his stupid grunt of a voice. He can't transform like the more animalistic of us.
"I highly doubt he's strong enough to smuggle in a troll. And even if he was, how could he have gotten past the gates?" They look around, trying to think of a response to my questions.
We're in my room, waiting for our parents to finish their discussion. Blaise already left with the Zabinis.
"Is it true? They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?" He answered a quick yes and stared at the burly boys on either side of me. "Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle. And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy." The Weasley tried hiding a laugh with my name. "Think my name's funny, don't you? My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford," I retaliate at him before turning back to Harry with a small smile. Now's my chance.
"It happened again," she breathes, barely a whisper. "Gizzy got caught. I haven't seen her since he found her. The other elves say-" she chokes and another wave of tears washes over her. I hug her tighter to me, rubbing circles between her shoulders, only stopping when Blaise walks in, immediately joining me in my attempt to comfort her.
I'm beyond ecstatic to watch Potter perform on a broom again, and it seems my wish will come true on Saturday, as it will be the first Quidditch match of the season:Gryffindor versus Slytherin. By eleven that morning, most of the school could be found in the stands around the pitch, urging the match to start soon.
I had been to Diagon Alley before, but never was it this busy. Mother would take me in the early morning to retrieve money from the family vault. Father would take me in the later hours of the day and we'd head to Bourgin and Burkes. Today, however, the newest students for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry were out shopping for school supplies. Father had gone to get my books, and Mother walked me to Madam Malkins, the robe shop. I, of course, told her to leave me there and wait at the wand shop. My Mother will not watch me get measured, I can't lose that dignity.
Slytherin won the House Cup, and the Great Hall is decorated green and silver to celebrate my house. It's beautiful, and I find myself smiling genuinely for the first time in weeks. Of course, Dumbledick decides to give Gryffindor hundreds of points because Potter killed a teacher?! The entirety of Slytherin House is livid at the Headmaster, as well as the "Golden Trio"
"I am aware, you came in both ends. But I must agree, I think I could get used to spending time with you... Harry."
After we get dressed, we head to the entrance hall before taking the tunnel to the kitchens. Consequently, we run into an older Hufflepuff with the same destination. We're just turning a corner, arms linked, when we walk directly into the chest of Cedric Diggory.
Consciousness hits me like a brick before I can register why my cheek burns. Father stands above me, hand raised and ready to strike me again. It seems I had another hot dream.
He fucks into me at a searing pace, pulling my bound hands or my hair, biting my neck or shoulders, pushing me as far as I can go into the bed. His weight on my back doesn't allow for me to inhale fully, causing the dizziness from earlier to return in full force. I'm drooling, crying out incoherently, unaware of anything beside the sensations. It goes on for forever - he refuses to remove the cock ring and just let me come.
"Can I add my fingers?" Draco bucks his hips and barks impatiently, so Harry slides his forefinger in beside Dracos own. Curling the digit down and leaning his weight on it, Draco nearly comes right there.
My stomach grumbling, Mother's screams echoing in my ears, I drifted back into my dreams of inferno.
The damp alleyway beside the strip club smells of piss, alcohol, and... blood? My red leather trousers seem to shrink a size as the metallic scent fills my lungs.
Pansy hands him a pair of scissors (not his favorite scissors, though; those are fabric scissors) and he slices through the tape gingerly. A squeak issues from inside. He pulls away the flaps of cardboard, and out jump three Nifflers. The first, solid black excepting his beak, immediately tries to eat the shiny wire dress form before Pansy stops him. The second, steel grey with a lighter shoulder stripe, latches itself on Blaise's earring. The third, brown and white with spots on its eyes, holds back for a moment. Then, it jumps on the sewing desk and is dangerously close to inhaling dozens of sewing pins before I grasp it tightly.
I don't believe I got Blaise a present in return for my Kneazle, now that I think of it. He likes Nifflers, I'll get him one of those. Maybe I'll buy him a few if he makes me something. Hell, I'll buy three if he agrees to make me a new set of dress robes. If he did, he'd probably make me a fancy corset vest, the outer robes would have ruffles, the sleeves would open around my wrists-
It feels nice, to share this. I was scared I'd be embarrassed, ridiculed for allowing this hint of vulnerability. But instead it's empowering. I've shown weakness and it only made me feel stronger. Millie jumps onstage and bumps me aside with her hip (none too gently, at that) and takes a seat at the "Sharing Stool" as we call it.
"Oh, don't worry, I'm not judging. In fact, I think I might borrow some of Bellatrix's tactics. Does the cackling work for me?" Unfortunately it does. "Good, good... I can see your desires, you know; splayed out in your mind like your legs are when you think of our Saviour. Yes, that's right. Be ashamed of yourself, you filthy fucker. I know this turns you on." She reaches for the fragile gold chain around my neck. "Amortentia, yeah? Mind if I take a whiff?"
Lucius flies out the window, landing directly behind Draco. His long hair whips about him with the wind just as the cherry blossoms are. He points his cane on Narcissa, who is instantly bathed in calm.
The second week of school brought with it quite a bit of excitement, as we were to start broomstick lessons Thursday afternoon. I already know how to ride a broom, growing up at the Manor. My parents didn't give two shits about underage wizardry. Their homeschooling included advanced lessons of charms, hexes, potions, curses, herbology, jinxes, transfiguration, the dark arts, and Quidditch. Although, the Quidditch was more of a nickname for whatever torture Father would choose for me - rather, it was mainly him setting multiple Bludgers on me and making whatever Pureblood children that were visiting fight to find the Snitch, dodging blows and learning to shove one another out of the way. These broom lessons were the reason why Pansy ever got close to Gizzy, the house elf, in the first place. She had been knocked off her broom by Vince, and her parents didn't care enough to Heal her magically.
"Yes," I reply, sipping on my overly sweet fruity drink before pulling out my hip flask and adding enough firewhiskey to make an Erumpent woozy.
Our flying instructor was a half-harpy dyke with yellow eyes sharp as a hawks. A part of me wonders if she teaches flying to the first years due to that part of her: would she be able to transform and save a student mid air? Maybe not, I think to myself when the Longbottom boy plunges to the ground with a sharp CRACK. Madam Hooch leads him off to the medical wing, leaving us with strict instructions enforced with the threat of expulsion. Now I looked about, ready to start a show.
"I sent a patronus to Ron and the rest of the team. Are you hurt anywhere else?" I nod, and he narrows his eyes.
The game wasn't unlike the games I've seen before, so I fixed my eyes on Pretty Boy, hovering above the match. His broom is, no that can't be right. Or is it? No, his broom is definitely trying to buck him off. It took a couple minutes for others to notice, but soon the Weasleys were trying to help him off, and after his broom seemed to listen again, he soared to the ground, hands over his mouth like he was going to be sick. He landed and started to heave, belching out the Snitch, of all things, causing Gryffindor to win.
"Busy time at the Ministry, I hear. All those raids..." Father let's the sentence hang in the air before continuing, "I hope they're paying you overtime?" He sneers, reaching into what I presume to be Potter's cauldron and pulling out a Transfiguration textbook. "Obviously not," he drawls, opening the book and placing something in it discreetly. Oh fuck. "Dear me, what's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?"
"Klaus," I say. "Your name is Klaus now, okay?" He looks at me quizzically with his pumpkin orange eyes, black tufts on the ends of his large ears pointing backwards, giving the impression that he's glaring at me.
"Maybe that's my goal," he growls. My cock twitches, leaking another dribble of precome on my stomach, causing him to laugh at my expense. Then, he squeezes. "If you want me to stop, start humming the song that played at yours and Astorias wedding, you cheating creep." His next move is to latch his mouth on my nipple, waving his free hand for ropes to tie my hands behind my back. This time, however, the binds are looser, more comfortable, put there to hold me tenderly rather than to break my arms should I move. He has me suck the fingers of his left hand, slicking them with spit.
“Yes. I meant, she told me what you did before his party.” Draco did his best, he really did. But despite all his efforts, he definitely flushed. Flushing was better than blushing, probably.
Eventually he looked up to find he was correct; they were staring at him. Harry twirled his eggs around his plate. “I never said he was up to something, not since we've been back. You all just assumed that. Truth is, I just like looking at him.” Harry continued eating calmly. It felt nice to admit it. Who cared if his friends knew? He was tired of pretending. He was Harry freaking Potter, and if he wanted to have a stupid crush on someone, he would.
“Did you, for one moment, consider that he doesn't want this?” He cried, no longer able to hold in his anger. He gestured towards the cards vaguely. Both of them looked confused.
“You have made a point to be near me for weeks because I don't like you.” Harry hesitated, then made a grumble Draco assumed was a positive. “What are you, some kind of masochist?” For a moment, he wondered if perhaps the Savior had some really deep-rooted mental issues where he craved an enemy in the absence of the one he had been fighting his entire life. But Harry responded.
“You really think the Golden Boy would say that about his friends? Of course not. I was just annoyed.”
But then Harry was kissing him, and he wasn't even sure what his heart was doing anymore. It was hard to ignore it when Harry slowly moved his lips against his, his hand gently traced his stomach up to his chest, his other hand found the back of his neck. Draco roughly shoved both hands into that stupid messy hair of his, the stupid hair he'd definitely never daydreamed about running his hands through. It was upsetting when he felt the lips disappear, until they reappeared against his neck.
doesn't want to be a Quidditch player when they grow up.” Draco smirked as he watched Teddy glare at Harry, but still scoop up every bite and eat it. Harry smiled and ruffled Teddy's hair when he was done.
“So,” Weasley started up again. This time, Draco felt that whatever she was about to say was the real reason they were here. He steeled himself for something uncomfortable, though he couldn't think of what it could be. “Hermione told me about Harry's birthday party.” His eyebrows furrowed.
“Oh, I apologize. I didn't realize you owned the library tables.” Draco's glare hardened further, but Potter was already turning back to his book.
Because Draco couldn't possibly just have a nice, relaxing evening, the conversation from the other group grew continually louder. They were animatedly discussing how Neville and Hannah needed to just get together already. Apparently, the group had come to the conclusion that the best way for this to happen would be for them to start snogging in the middle of class. The conversation lulled, and Draco vaguely hoped they would talk about something that made them less excited.
need?” Draco rolled his eyes. None of his friends stayed off his back about his perpetually single state. Apparently not even his business partner.
“They didn't... it wasn't about the war or dark mark or anything, was it?” His voice was deathly low, and Draco knew he would snap if he answered yes to that. His heart started doing flips, but he mentally berated himself. It had nothing to do with him personally. Harry was just too fucking nice to allow that. To anyone.
“Okay.” He said it like he didn't know what her point was. He slowly put the bookmark in his book and shut it. It was clear he wasn't going to get any more reading done.
“No. I did not get him the stupid quill.” His voice was firm and steady, but Ginny smiled like a loon.
“He's your best friend, you idiot, and you're not going to win a war together just to walk away from him because he yelled at you. So stop waiting around while it's unbearable for everyone, be the bigger person, and go fucking apologize.” Draco yanked Harry to his feet by his robes, earning wide eyes and a furious glare. He vaguely heard a gasp from across the room.
“I think he feels bad for everything he did to us,” she'd say. “He's just trying to make amends so he can forgive himself and be happy.”
When they sat down, Ron and Seamus started speculating who it could be. Harry gave away nothing, ignoring all their guesses and questions and remarks. He ate as though no one was speaking to him. Hermione stared at them in confusion as they discussed the matter avidly. Harry's stomach turned at her thoughtful expression. Had she somehow figured it out from some inconsequential thing he hadn't noticed? But she waited for Ron to finish his current theory. “But... it couldn't have been Parvati.”
He had just pulled the curtains around his bed closed when Malfoy yanked them back. “Fucking prick,” Malfoy muttered, even as he moved to straddle the brunette.
“Speaking of couples that need to just bang and get it over with...” Seamus started ominously, definitely louder. “We're all a little sick of watching you two and your hormones, Malfoy.” It took Draco a few moments to register that he'd said his name.
“You know exactly what to say to cheer me up or piss me off or get me to do something, even when no one else does. They told me how you saved my birthday party from them; my best friends in the world didn't get it after weeks of me trying so hard to get them to understand, but I talk to you for five minutes and you did. You see me.” Harry somehow leaned even closer. Draco could feel his breath against his lips as he continued speaking.
It was just down the hall from George’s office, in the floor above the store itself. Sometimes Draco wished it was a little farther away from George, but they’d come up with a system that worked for them; if Draco left the door of his workshop closed, George wouldn’t bother him. If it was open, the Weasley felt free to come waltzing in just to annoy Draco, or let him in on a ridiculous pun he’d just come up with.
But no matter how much he tried to convince himself that it probably had nothing to do with him, he didn't believe it in the slightest.
As the days and weeks went on, it continued. Potter would hover near Draco. They'd made something of a tentative truce, but they certainly weren't friends, which made it strange that Potter seemed intent on staying near Draco. For a while, he wondered if this was another version of Potter creeping around like in sixth year, but he didn't seem to be monitoring Draco or acting suspicious of him. He was just... around.
“I'm not going to lie or make something up, Malfoy. I would never say anything to anyone unless I knew you were actually doing something. I never said anything to anyone sixth year either. Well, except Ron and Hermione.” Malfoy nodded, his shoulders relaxing slightly.
“No, I- they've really enhanced security after the war. No one can get into the bedrooms except for the students who live there.” Harry felt the color drain from his face. The silence that followed her revelation was deafening.
But he hadn't. Malfoy had known what it meant to Harry, had put away all his Slytherin pride and years of rivalry and put himself out on the line to make amends. All for Harry.
“Potter.” Harry pulled his eyes away to see his blond roommate pulling a set of robes out of his chest.
“You don't like me,” Harry eventually said, quietly. Of all the ideas he had come up with in the past few weeks, that was not what Draco had expected to hear.
“What's going on?” Harry looked from the angry faces to Ron's wand. Hermione gently pushed Ron's hand down.
“You've read the others?” The awkwardness fell away as he and Granger fell into a conversation about whether one of the characters was evil. Draco made sure not to spoil anything from the new book. When that conversation died down, they ate in a much more comfortable silence.
Harry and Malfoy were sitting on the couch facing the fireplace, which was unlit at this hour. Ron moved closer, sure he was seeing it wrong. But... no, Malfoy had his arm around Harry, who was...
“I stopped by to see Teddy. He was babysitting.” Daphne gently put her hand on Draco's arm, almost like she was offering her sympathy. Draco was saved from any more annoying questions when his food arrived.
Harry had surprised just about everyone after finishing Hogwarts by not becoming an Auror, or Professor, or pro Quidditch player. Instead, he'd started a private business that monitored the Ministry of Magic for dark magic, inappropriate behavior, or anything disreputable. It was something no one had seen coming, but Draco knew it made sense as soon as he heard it. Harry didn't want to run around catching more bad guys, he wanted to make sure the bad guys weren't in power like they had been during the war. Draco knew as well as anyone that if the Death Eaters – and those who abused their power, like Umbridge – hadn't been in control just before and during the war, everything would have been different.
“It is.” He lifted it to show the cover. It was the latest in a fiction series about Veelas. Hermione's face genuinely brightened.
“You boys should be the ones enjoying life. Go on and head home, my dears. Thank you for everything.” She gave a kiss on the cheek to Harry and Draco before leading them out of the house.
“I got tickets to the Chudley match in two weeks. Can you think of a way to ask him to go that won't make him think I'm trying to kidnap him?” Harry laughed. “I was thinking I could just give them to you and him, but, still. That will come across too suspicious.”
Harry hadn’t been able to help it. Since Malfoy had walked into the Great Hall in September with a strange smile Harry had never seen, he’d barely been able to keep his eyes off him. Every time Harry studied him, he found something new – a birthmark on Malfoy’s neck, how Malfoy’s smile was warm now, the rings he wore. The way Malfoy’s body moved while flying, the way he bit his lip when he wrote notes, the way he got absorbed in a book until he was lost to the world. The way he finally looked
“This would really be more convincing if you’d cut the naff commentary,” Harry said, taking Malfoy’s hand.
She got to her feet, heading towards what she’d seen and Harry noticed she was approaching a kneazle, that was sitting primly just on the outskirts of the forest, engaging in a very thorough clean of its face.
When no flash of light appeared, Regulus turned to them and smiled. “Well. Looks like you lot did it.”
Draco hesitated, briefly, in his movements, before he went on, speaking with that infuriating air of faux-nonchalance. “What do you think, Potter? Do you think I would?”
Harry opened his mouth but before he could say anything in defence of it, the niffler bit down on his finger -
“I can’t see him giving it up without a fight,” Harry chuckled, before he eyed the couch they were sitting on. “That mean I’m sleeping here?”
Malfoy, of course, heard him, his head turning sharply in Harry’s direction. “Well, well. Do my eyes deceive me?”
Malfoy side-alonged them to the doorstep of Grimmauld Place. He could have apparated them inside. He knew that Harry had added him to the wards so that he’d been able to get in earlier that night.
There was a scar that Harry had put there, another raised line that trailed downwards and his gaze followed, seeing the others, then.
But, for him and Draco, an exception had been made and Harry was pretty sure the reason was due to the fact that it had been Professor McGonagall who'd caught them on the other side of the rules rather than anyone else, considering the other professors didn’t seem to have much idea of how they ought to be treating Harry, ever since he’d unexpectedly returned to Hogwarts that year.
“I think I’ll retire for the night, as it happens,” Malfoy said, adjusting the trousers of the muggle suit he wore, and it took all of Harry’s willpower not to look and see if Malfoy was actually being literal. Dress robes really did have an advantage over muggle attire, in circumstances such as these. “If we leave now, they may just think we can’t bear to keep our hands off one another much longer.”
Harry’s eyes drifted downwards, if only to escape from the intensity of the look that Draco’s gaze was starting to take on, but that was hardly one of his
He tossed a small wooden box onto the table in front of them that rattled, quirking an eyebrow. “Fancy a game, Potter?”
- and Luna appeared, not looking at all surprised even though it was clear she could tell what they’d been up to.
A soft exhale against his cheek reminded him of where he was - who he was touching - and he quickly pulled back, jerking as if burned, and looked away.
“You made it past the selma, then,” the man remarked, with a smile playing on his lips, crossing his arms as he eyed the two of them. “It’s been a while since anyone’s come through here. I was beginning to wonder if the game had given up.”
“Merlin Forbid,” Harry said, with a laugh and leaned back on the couch cushions, so that their arms were now pressed against one another, their fingers still entwined between them.
Harry felt the memories start to come back to him - of Snape, of Dumbledore, of a green light hitting him in the chest and him falling - and he shoved them away, into the box he had labelled
Another gasp, a groan, and then the fingers in his hair released their grip, making their way downwards in slow, lazy strokes before grasping the hem and then light touches, a question, that scorched all the same beneath the fabric had Harry arching up, seeking more, his next groan muffled by the mouth returning to his as the fingertips became palms moving across the tight muscles of his stomach.
“Are you really thinking about staying here?” Harry blurted out, cursing his inability to play things cool and think a bit before speaking.
Draco fought a smile of his own, his eyes still ahead, but when Luna stepped by them, walking closer to where Regulus was several paces in front of them, he leaned in close enough that his lips touched the shell of Harry’s ear, his breath warm and tickling his neck when he said; “Exhilarating.”
Harry chuckled and said nothing, his gaze fond as he leaned in and pressed his lips to his, and Draco certainly wasn’t going to resist - even if he was still a bit bemused as to why Harry would even want to be anywhere near him - so he sighed and wrapped his arms around his waist, drawing him closer.
“I don’t know what you’ve been so uptight about this week, Potter,” he practically sneered at him, in a way he hadn’t done so in months, now “You’re the one who jumped
“That your relentless pursuit of me in school was about more than just a desire to prove I was the human embodiment of pure wickedness.”
“You’re one to talk, Potter,” Draco returned, sharply, shooting him an unimpressed look. “I’m not the one who locked myself up in the dorms for five days. Over-dramatisation at its finest.”
Two lives, he thought, past the haze of it, just as he felt his wand come back to his outstretched hand.
Harry yanked Draco’s trousers off, boxers following suit, casting them aside. “I don’t give a toss.”
Harry’s eyes lingered, again, taking in the way silvery grey eyes were set, determinedly, on their intended path. The way his tongue flicked out against his lips that were starting to dry in the breeze. The way his hair stirred on his forehead as they sailed forward.
“No, I didn’t,” Draco agreed, looking at him, coldly. “It was sex, Potter. That’s all. Nothing to get your knickers in a twist about. If you’re worried I’m going to be shouting it from the rooftops of Hogwarts, rest assured, I have no intention of doing so. Merlin forbid.”
At first, Harry wasn’t sure if Draco even remembered what had happened, though Harry was sure there hadn't been enough firewhiskey for that and the notion was quickly driven away after an initial day of Harry...well...avoiding Draco altogether in a manner totally unbefitting of a Gryffindor.
He risked a glance at Draco, who appeared oblivious to Harry's presence, as away with the effects of the woodland magic as he had just been, grey eyes with an unfocused gaze on some point over Harry’s shoulder.
Harry drew in a breath when Draco’s eyes lingered, acutely aware of their proximity, their near-nakedness and the fact that Draco smelled extremely, unbelievably
Draco made hardly a sound, just a stutter of breath as Harry moved his mouth and tongue over him, hoping he was doing this right. He was pretty certain he was by the way Draco’s fingers grabbled and gripped at the cushion of the couch beneath him, hips twitching with every stroke of Harry’s tongue.
Regulus lifted his shoulders in a shrug and there was mischief in his eyes that reminded Harry of Sirius.
and expected that he must. At least according to the Mind Healer he had, thankfully, managed to ditch along with the Auror Programme.
He was close, very close, to the edge - to safety - when he felt a tug on his ankle before it became a yank that hauled him back under the water just as he clawed at the bank and broke the surface.
in his gaze as they did. “But if you toe the line, follow the rules, you might get by unnoticed. You might just survive.”
The sound of voices caused Harry to rouse from where he’d fallen asleep on the couch. Pulled out now, so that both he and Draco could sleep upon it together, once they’d eventually - finally - satisfied their need to touch and kiss, but Harry could tell even before he fully came back to himself that he was now lying there alone.
Harry started, looking at her quickly. His first instinct was to be honest. But several hours in, with the drinks and the flirting flowing, things were all becoming a bit hazy and he wasn’t a hundred percent sure, anymore, what the lie actually was. So, he just shifted on his feet. “Er. Yeah.”
As such, Malfoy just placed a hand on Harry’s arm as the two of them made their way through the lobby where the press were being held—the camera flashes still snap, snap, snapping away as reporters called out questions after them—and walked into the dining area.
He felt a flurry of fabric being thrown over him, before finding himself face to face with Harry, and those sparkling green eyes that shone so brightly, sometimes, that Draco caught his breath.
“Obviously that’s not how it worked," Harry scoffed, elbowing him in the side. "I’ve seen things, too.”
His own voice sounded further away, barely more than a whisper, quiet on the breeze, but even then he could hear the shame behind the words.
Harry felt a hand on his back, unseen in the darkness, and then wisps of breath just before the soft press of a kiss to the side of his neck.
Harry rolled his eyes, about to make a retort but any reply died on his lips when Malfoy drew him closer, surprisingly strong arms surrounding him and Malfoy’s breath hot on his neck when he spoke close to his ear. “I’ll lead. Just follow me.”
Harry huffed a bit, more laughter than anything else, and turned his head to look at him, fingers tightening around his, instinctively. “I’m not bolting now.”
An uneasy silence fell over the room, all three within seemingly rendered speechless by what had just happened.
Harry reached for him, then, taking Draco's face in his hands and pressing his lips to his, finding Draco’s mouth pliant -
and the dementor was chased off to the side by his silver stag, speeding in the direction of where Draco and Luna were still at the desk.
if he couldn’t manage to tear his eyes off the back of Draco's head for a second, a sudden aching need to do something after what he’d just seen.
Harry stared, dumbly, at where she lay until he abruptly snapped out of it - horrified - and he grasped her arm - “
Harry landed unsteadily on his feet, with a gasp on his lips and a lurch in his stomach at the turbulence of the unexpected apparition, fighting back a wave of nausea as he regained his footing.
“You consider this a mess?” Draco’s eyes were back on their hands. “I’ve found it rather enlightening, in fact.”
“Perhaps you’re not far off,” Draco said, after a minute, eyes on the ceiling when he added. “Your company is not
There was darkness - nothingness - and then a flash of light and Harry found himself standing at the beginning of the bridge, seeing the other three up ahead as they appeared in flashes, battling off the dementors - a silver hare that bounded, chasing off those that ascended from below.
He glanced over at Luna, who was going through the cupboards of the cabinet a few feet away with much more finesse than Harry was looking through the drawers - everything he’d gotten his hands on shoved aside when he’d determined their uselessness - and then at Regulus, who was sitting on the couch, one ankle resting up on his knee as he flicked through a journal that had been on the bookshelf.
Harry frowned, glancing in the direction of where their clothing was laid out, and noticed half the arm of one of his shirts had been torn off.
He reached up, letting go only because a grasp of Draco’s shoulders would be able to pull him closer - and he
The air suddenly felt cold around them and Harry shivered in it, eyes taking in the mist that swirled at his feet, as he stepped forward, closer to where Draco stood, but his limbs felt heavy, sluggish. His mind, too, in the sort of way it feels in the space between dreams and wakefulness.
Harry watched him go, long enough that he was startled upon turning back to the forest and seeing that Draco and Luna were now deep within it and he hurried to catch up.
Harry watched Draco from where he sat on the doorstep of the cabin, Draco a few feet away, almost around the corner but not so much that Harry couldn’t see him, wielding his wand as if practicing something.
“I never knew that,” Draco said quietly in his mind, and Harry remembered, then, when he’d said it. In the Astronomy Tower, some nights before.
Before he’d taken more than a couple of steps, the parchment in the middle of the desk glowed brighter than it had the previous two times, increasing in intensity to the point he had to reach up with a splayed hand and squint to keep his eyes open.
“No knickers tonight,” Malfoy pointed out. “And certainly not. My lovers are wined and dined and courted, appropriately.”
But Harry’s eyes didn’t stay on her for long, drifting away of their own accord towards the far end of the pitch where a whizz of white blond hair and pale blue robes shot by in hot pursuit of the Snitch.
So, Harry nudged him - ignoring the fact that he, too, was bricking it a little and had no real wish to face down any dragons in this place, two available lives or not - and said, quietly. “Two lives, mind.”
“Could’ve left some hot water for the rest of us,” Draco remarked, eyeing Regulus where he sat as he shrugged into his shirt.
Draco looked at where their hands were joined, amusement replaced by an uncertainty that was never there when he was alluding to fancying or fucking.
Draco glanced at the timepiece - seeing four fifty - and then carefully placed his bookmark between the pages and snapped the book in his hands shut. He put the book on the side table, getting to his feet, and smoothed down his completely smooth, impeccable robes.
“I imagine the game recognised that it was in danger of becoming obsolete once the dice ended up at the bottom of a lake filled with inferni. Likely, it replenished itself and, in doing so, restarted the game - my map with the quests I’d been granted disappearing along with it.”
Draco, however, and Regulus - especially - were far more inclined to just stay put at the cabin and wait, Regulus happily indulging in a second shower and proceeding to declare plumbing the greatest invention of the Wizarding World, while Luna was keen to explore the surrounding forest and Draco, well...Draco just made numerous suggestions that if they were staying another night that it was his turn for the king size.
before Draco’s hips jerked, and the sound and the knock against the back of his throat made Harry's own prick twitch with interest and he pressed the heel of his hand against it, at first to stay himself but changed his mind at how good it felt to be touched.
He barely had time to register what had happened - to take notice of Draco and Luna and that they were alright - before something else broke the surface of the water a few feet behind where the logs of their raft were separating and drifting away from one another down the current.
There was silence in the wake of his statement and Harry frowned, making to lean up and protest or something, but Draco spoke again before he could.
"We've surely faced worse than this, Potter." Draco glanced at him out the corner of his eye. “Is this what it feels like to fight alongside the Great Saviour of the Wizarding World? I’d always wondered.”
And it was then that Harry realised that, actually, this whole thing had been a truly tremendous mistake.
A boggart, almost, in forest form; digging deep within your soul to exploit any weakness it may find.
Harry waited until Draco looked back at him, confused at Harry’s silence, before he grinned. “We should do it again soon.
They carried on that way for close to an hour without much luck - Harry and Draco on one side of the room, rummaging through drawers and nooks and crannies and loose floorboards, while Regulus and Luna carried on looking through the journals they’d come across, combing for clues.
think we owe each other anything," Harry said, before adding with a raised eyebrow. "In any case, you still couldn’t do it, could you?”
and the fact Draco was walking close enough that their arms and the backs of their hands brushed every now and again with each step - as they crept through the trees that, now that the haze had lifted, seemed rather like an ordinary wood.
It was broken by the sound of scuffling claws on the floorboards once more and Harry saw the niffler scurrying past and out the room.
“You first, Potter,” Draco said at his side, from where they two and Luna were eyeing their next destination from the cover of the bushes.
Potter, is that you heard a story - that wasn’t even true - from a House Elf, and that’s enough for you to trust him.”
So Harry leaned forward, pressing their lips together, kissing him because...there was no reason not to. Well. That wasn’t entirely true. Harry kissed him because he
once?” Harry snapped, his hands moving in a helpless manner above her, clueless at what he needed to do.
Harry realised he was gasping, still trying to catch the breath that had been stolen from him, and he reached up, absentmindedly brushing at the wetness of his forehead.
“Our next up is a magic quest. Right up your alley, Potter. Then again, if all your accomplishments come down simply to luck” - he eyed Harry, lips twitching - “how hard could it be?”
He hadn’t said anything since they’d set off but he didn’t hold himself in quite the same way as he had done at Hogwarts these past few months. Instead, he seemed totally at ease, relaxed in a manner that was familiar but distantly so. And Harry realised he hadn’t seen Draco look like that in a long time. As if he weren’t being hunted or haunted.
A commotion outside the pub drew his attention from his drink, the sounds of camera flashes and calling voices becoming louder and turning heads as the door swung open, before none other than Draco Malfoy himself, crossed the threshold, pub security holding the press at the door which shut soundly behind him.
?” He gave them a wry smile, crossing his arms.“Tempting, Harry. Tempting. But I think I’ll just head down the shore and watch the sunset.”
Draco grinned, glancing down at him where he was still kneeling, and Harry was sure that Draco was entirely aware of the effect the sight of him half-naked - and still wet - was having on him, his shirt still hanging loose, unbuttoned.
He noticed Luna a little further ahead, eyes closed as his own had been, as she swayed, slightly, seeming lost in a daze.
was the one struggling with keeping his eyes on Draco through the conversation, his nerves stuttering to life and his words stuttering along with them.
After long minutes of just stroking and kissing - ignoring the passers by - Harry drew back, and Draco knew his cheeks were flushed, his breathing uneven. He would have known, even if Harry hadn’t looked so pleased with himself.
“To bed,” Regulus repeated, with a finger pointed upwards at the ceiling. “There’s a king size up there calling my name and I am determined I’ll get at least a
Malfoy took it all in good humour. Still smiling, touching him and sharing glances at all the right moments as he easily fielded the questions. Harry guessed he’d done this all before and found he didn’t really like the thought of that.
Harry didn’t realise how long he’d been staring until he got caught, Draco’s eyes flicking to his, suddenly, and dancing with such obvious amusement that Harry realised he’d known from some time that he was watching him.
Harry ineloquently scrambled to his feet and Malfoy raised an eyebrow at him, obviously amused. But Malfoy said nothing, just offered his arm—for appearance’s sake, Harry knew—and Harry took it, playing along as they moved with the crowd into the ballroom, while Harry pushed all thoughts of Malfoy’s warmth and
Unthinkingly, Harry reached out, fingertips touching one of the scars on his chest, as guilt and shame gripped him tight, all of a sudden.
and found himself facing a silvery glowing creature with sharp teeth bared and eyes shining white in the darkness.
Harry’s head fell back against the couch, hips arching into it, overcome by the staggering, breathtaking things that Draco was capable of doing with his tongue.
Draco caught that mischievous little smile of his - that always preceded teasing - but, rather than outright teasing, he found himself almost choking on the bite of the pastry he’d just lifted, at the feel of Harry toes - his bare toes - sliding slowly up the inside of his thigh.
“I imagine the point of the game is not to find out, don’t you think?” Draco said, quirking an eyebrow.
Harry turned the parchment that had been pinned to the front of the cabin door over in his hands, looking again for any further elaboration on what they were actually supposed to be looking for.
Harry drew in a breath and nodded, even if Draco didn’t bother to wait until he’d done so before he stepped through.
Harry stayed silent and watched, no one around to yell at him or make fun of him for staring for once. Eventually Malfoy must have felt his presence, because he looked up.
As soon as Draco had finished stirring and the potion needed to sit for five minutes, he unlatched the door. His Aunt's owl entered. He took the parchment from her beak and pet her softly. It was definitely his Aunt's owl, but the writing was neither his Aunt's neat cursive nor Teddy's attempt at letters. It was plain, small writing that Draco thought was familiar, but couldn't quite place.
In the darkness, Draco turned to look at Harry's bed. The bright green eyes were already watching him, easy to see even in the darkness. It was silent, other than some light breathing and Neville's snoring.
“You're way too intelligent and interesting for me. You may have liked the spotlight when you were younger, but now you hate it just as much as I do. Even if the attention is positive. You're brave and ambitious and don't take the easy way out.”
“Oh, just take it already,” Harry said with an eye roll. He turned around to grab the broom, handing it over to Ginny. She looked up at Malfoy again.
“Actually, I don't want to ask about you.” Harry sat up straighter, somewhat intrigued. He took a bite of apple and chewed it slowly before responding.
“But... then there won't be anyone fighting you. Insulting you. That's what you want, isn't it?” Harry had the nerve to laugh.
Whenever Potter sat near or walked with him, Draco would look at him pointedly with a raised eyebrow. But Potter never gave any explanation. Never even seemed to notice Draco's confusion. Draco would occasionally shoot a halfhearted insult at him, and Potter would respond with a slight smirk and a snappy comeback, but none of the words held much bite.
“Harry,” he breathed out. He kissed a hot line from his jaw to the edge of his robes. Harry rested his head against the neck he had just been attacking. He was as out of breath as Draco was.
He met Harry's eyes. Harry was his best friend in the entire world, even before his girlfriend. Harry had always been there for him, even when he was a dick and an idiot and a git. He'd saved him from being poisoned, almost immediately accepted him back every time Ron betrayed him or was completely unreasonable, defended him whenever anyone insulted the Weasley name, and patiently let him take years to finally make a move on Hermione.
His eyes darted around them to see if Harry was with them, but he was nowhere to be found. Granger quirked an eyebrow. She was definitely too smart for her own good.
“Look her in the eyes and say you didn't.” Clearly Ginny hadn't been privy to this part of the conversation, but she picked up quickly. Draco took a moment to steady himself before he met Hermione's gaze again.
“Good point, good point.” He wrote Neville's name down. Then Dean and Blaise, followed by the names of those in the adjoining dorm - Ernie, Michael, Justin, and Theo. He stopped, looking back at Ron. “No one seems likely. We'll just have to check them all out.” Harry's heart calmed.  They hadn't even written Malfoy. Why would they? Even if they were supposed to be checking every suspect, they didn't need to check the person Harry “hated.” Harry felt something in his chest, although he couldn't tell if it was anger or relief. He did his best to ignore as the sudden detectives went around interviewing people.
He had dinner with his mother every Sunday evening, and always stayed long after dinner to talk with her about anything she wanted to vent or ask about, moving to the lounge with coffee.
Draco followed him to the bedrooms without another glance at the crowd around him. It would have been more effective if they went in different directions, but Draco didn't have anywhere else to go.
“I, well... that she fancied me, I suppose. But what does that have to do....” he trailed off watching Harry, who was meeting his eye with one brow raised. Draco shook his head slightly and his face grew red. “Don't. Don't mess with me.” Harry turned to the wall.
“C'mere.” This time, Harry was not demanding, but closer to begging. Malfoy glanced around the room, ensuring they were the only ones present.
“You vouched for him at his trial, Harry.” Harry's heart skipped a beat. That was exactly the sort of thing he preferred ignoring, pretending it hadn't happened. And it certainly was not something he wanted his friends to bring up. “You told the entire Wizarding World that he was not a real Death Eater, that he didn't deserve punishment, that you believed he wasn't a danger to anyone.” Harry turned back to the fire, not having anything worth saying to that.
“What the hell does it look like?” Draco continued staring at the boy who had just plopped down at the other end of his table. He had already started writing on a piece of parchment, not even glancing up at Draco. Draco huffed when Potter refused to respond any further.
“Not always by any stretch. And when they fight they're calm, not heated. Not giggling at each other. Not acting like they want to rip each other's clothes off.”
Did he for some unknown reason actually... want to be friends? He had come to accept Malfoy's truce, but the idea that the blond would want to be friends with him was far too ridiculous.
“Hermione.” Ron looked up at his girlfriend's name, since it was spoken by a familiar blond. They were early to Charms, as always, because their previous class was so close. “I heard you were looking for this.”
“You think so?” Malfoy shrugged, but Harry noticed the slight tint on his cheeks. He never would have been able to see it six months ago, before they'd started... whatever this was.
“I thought we could come up with some other ideas along that line. You can help, Draco. What's stopping
“Oh.” Her intense stare didn't change. “You're saying you didn't get him anything else?” Draco finally turned back to his plate, shaking his head.
But not many students had returned for the summer – maybe 40 in total. Point being, there were only two other people in the library that Draco could see. Just as he started to point out that there were a dozen empty tables he could have chosen, Potter spoke again. “You're the one who keeps talking, tosser. You are bothering
“Fine. Had trouble sleeping last night.” George made a vague hmm noise. “Anything new?” George handed him a sheet with their current inventory so Draco would know what Potions or other items needed made. They were mostly low on Portable Swamps and Puking Pastiles.
"Harry." Harry stilled at the voice he couldn't stop thinking about. When he turned around, Malfoy was holding up a Gryffindor tie. "You dropped this." Harry frowned down at his bag to see his tie was no longer where he had stuffed it in a side pocket.
Draco set the tea down. He'd finished the cup without even noticing he was drinking it. Now that he'd spent a few hours with Harry – eating dinner with him, talking to him, seeing that damn grin – he could sense his feelings coming back full-force.
"We just… we don't want another year of Malfoy obsession." Harry flushed and looked down at his parchment.
If Draco thought Weasley and Harry laughing obnoxiously loudly in the common room was annoying, the two making a point of ignoring each other was somehow worse. In every class, there was an awkward moment where Granger and all of the other Gryffindors hesitated, as no one wanted to sit with either Harry or Weasley, knowing the other would take it as them choosing the other's side. The same was true in the Great Hall, where the two former best friends sat several feet apart, and their friends were forced to pick a side or sit awkwardly between them.
watching." Only when he heard Ron's light snores did he pull the map back out. He traced his hand over the owlery, over the dot that had been there almost every day the past two weeks.
“Nope. I'm still here,” Harry answered before Draco could, popping into the living room. He saw the confusion flash across his Aunt's face before she smiled gratefully at both of them.
“Shit friends,” Weasley interrupted. Granger smacked her lightly. “What? I didn't have all day to wait for you to get it out.” Draco snorted. Or whatever it was that was more dignified that sounded like snorting.
Two people dropped onto the bench across from Draco. He looked up from his plate to see the Weaselette and Granger looking at him. There were only two tables being used in the Great Hall since so few students were there – the Ravenclaws and Slytherins at one, Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs at the other. Different houses would sometimes sit together in the library or the common room, and even hang out. A few that had become friends even sat together in the Great Hall, but not people who could just tolerate each other.
“He seems well. He clearly enjoys spending time with Teddy.” His mother nodded again and gave him a smile that made him wonder what she was thinking about.
Teddy was happily munching a peanut butter biscuit when they heard the unmistakable sound of someone entering the wards. Draco stepped into the living room to greet his Aunt as she appeared in the doorway.
It was a while later, after enough time to calm down, that Harry walked out of the bedrooms with his head held high. Ron was sitting in a chair facing the bedrooms, and he perked up when Harry walked out. Seamus, who Ron must have been talking to, looked on in interest. “Have fun, Harry?” Ron asked innocently.
“Not right now, idiot.” Draco bit his tongue. Insulting him as he told him he didn't want to argue. Lovely. “I just meant... in general. I don't want to argue with you anymore.” There was a moment of silence. Draco didn't feel like he was avoiding facing Harry, since Harry was actually behind him.
Draco tried to kick the garbage bag behind a chair before Potter could notice it, but that only made it more obvious. The grin faded immediately when he saw it.
Draco couldn't help but pretend it would be for what he knew it wasn't, that Harry wanted to declare his undying love for Draco. He'd been nervous for several days wondering what Harry Potter could possibly want to discuss after barely speaking for two years since graduating. His mind had come up with a dozen possibilities, but all of them were completely unrealistic. The only ones he thought might be possible were that it was something about Teddy, that he actually wanted to reconcile their issues because it had been bothering his ridiculous Hero complex, or that he had some concern about George or the shop.
The Chosen One stands over the crumpled form of Neville Longbottom. Neville, it seems, has lost weight and carries the faint grey tint to gis skin that one may associate with long-term illness. Mortified, Draco turns on his heel, wishing to leave.
I begin coughing into the sudden fluffy cloud of silver and black. Apparently Klaus was ready to drop his coat, like Blaise had told me earlier. The fur enters every orifice to the point where all my senses are muffled. Dobby's voice carries through to me very lightly, growing louder as the fur curls around itself, twisting into very nice looking yarn, and I realize Dobby had been chanting a spell to spin it.
"You will be quite the help to me, Draco. Veela hair is an exquisite ingredient in fire resistance potions, and I have been tasked with making a few for the Headmaster." He stands, tucking away a jar of bright gold under his arm, and releases his immobility spell he had placed on me.
Before Draco can even think, Harry is towering over him, pinning the blond to his chest with a growl. "Care for a swim?" Draco nods vigorously. Potter bites his lip and undresses the short blond swiftly. His hands seemed to be everywhere at once, touching Dracos chest, back, sides, hips, arse, neck, arms, and face in a leisurely massage.
The Express wasn't much different than last year. I sat in a compartment with Vince, Greg, Millicent, Daphne, Theodore, Pansy, and Blaise near the middle of the train, telling jokes and catching up. At one point, Granger came in looking beyond worried.
"Potter, sit," he says in a voice higher than his usual drawl. Potter raises an eyebrow in question. "Sit on the edge of the pool so I can gag on your cock." Potter smiles and gestures with his hands as if to say go on. "Potter, please?" He whines out.
"My mother gave them to me, your Grandma Black. They're sigil tattoos, but very faint, and very powerful. The ink is ground up gemstones - labradorite, sodalite, lepidolite, to name a few - ground up into pieces small enough to float between the layers of your skin. That's why they sparkle." She pauses, resting her hands on my shoulders again. "I will give you yours today, my dragon. It may hurt a bit, but it is an important tradition that will keep you safe, and pain is but a temporary emotion. Besides, I've a salve prepared to numb the stinging afterwards."
“Well of course I do, I mean I invited him to my house.” I laugh in response, Ron not joining in this time. “Don’t really invite people you hate into your home do you?”
He seemed to pick up what I was saying as he started looking through the assortment of teas. After a few moments picking one up and putting it into the kettle. Finally calm, I decide to start watching the television ads just about to end.
A few minutes later Hermione came up to hug me, excusing herself. The potion mystery still causing chaos apparently. She waved goodbye to the few left and quickly walked out, pulling her phone out and calling someone the moment she stepped out the door. Before quickly coming back into the house.
“You don’t know?” He whispered, keeping his eyes on mine. I feel my breathing speed up as he questions me with his eyes.
“You’re not your Father.” I say quickly, hoping this at least helps calm him down, or at least get control of the situation this time. It seems to, the sobs becoming quieter. “If you were anything like him you wouldn’t have even looked my way when you saw me.” It was true, I’ve had multiple run ins with Lucius, and every time he acts as if I’m not even there. Never have I figured out why. ‘Mione seems to think it’s because I’m a reminder that he lost. A reminder that he failed over and over again. Ron seems to think he just hates me. I think it's both.
“If you’re okay with staying late then sure” I speak up, still staring into his eyes. They fill with more wonder as he starts to get excited before quickie catching himself and just smiling. His eyes though, they show the sheer happiness he feels at that news. Nodding to me he resumes his spot, only this time I notice, is a bit closer to me than last.
Having flowers shoved into my face as soon as I opened the door wasn’t what I expected, but it's exactly what happened.
I don’t think he would. Maybe I used to, but just seeing him again seemed to change everything. I stopped thinking of him as Malfoy which is still quite terrifying. The name just doesn’t seem to fit him anymore. Back in school, it made sense, he was supposed to be just like his father, so calling him by his last name was just the best way of going about things. Yet, how I saw him yesterday changed things; instead of being a mini replica of his father, he looked more like a man his father would despise. Ron told me that’s probably one of the reasons he changed so much about himself, I’d believe it, he already said he left because of the stigma. So if he changed everything about himself with that in mind, it’d make sense.
“It made it hell.” He said louder now, sitting up once again and looking at me. His eyes were puffy and it looked as if he had running muggle makeup that you see in the movies. Did he wear makeup for this? “I know I was too young to realize how horrible of a person he was. Even when I realized it I was too scared to change, I was supposed to be him, so I made myself feel as if I didn’t have a chance.” Looking at him, I instinctively reach out to tuck a fallen piece of hair back behind his ear. His eyes follow my movement but he doesn’t stop me, just stares in confusion as I then reach into my pocket and hand him a tissue I had in one of those plastic muggle things.
“Do tell her that when you see her next.” He rushed out as he struggled to get his jacket on by my door. Noticing my look of confusion he spoke again. “I didn’t expect to stay over, I have a meeting with the Minister in ten minute and all my work is at home.” Finally pulling his arm through the sleeve. “I’m terribly sorry I have to leave so rushed.”
“What the hell are you looking at Potter?” Draco practically growled at me, shaking me out of my daydream where he was still lying down. Now, I can’t recall when he's sitting up, the blanket I gently placed over him earlier this morning being tugged up against his chest as if he was shirtless. That’s when I see the glare, the same smug yet anger filled look he would give me, or really any Gryffindor when they got something right that he got wrong. This Draco resembles Hogwarts and childish rivalry.
“Sorry guys, I’m just not up for it today.” Finishing it off with another fake cough and a nod I attempted to close the door, before Hermione's foot got caught in the way.
On the inside were various photos from our teenage years. Shots of him catching the snitch while playing against Hufflepuff. Pictures of him and his entourage in the dorms. Every so often there would be a random picture of the lake, or a scenic shot of the castle. It was almost showing how much everything changed throughout the years. Each year seemed to be separated by a Malfoy family portrait. As the years progressed his smile faded, there were less pictures with others and more of just the scenery around the castle. His smile wasn’t the same one I’ve seen recently. In the older photos it seemed more smug, almost venomous. The smile I’ve seen on him recently is a softer, genuine look to it. Honestly, it is hard to believe I’m looking at the same person. “Why are you showing me this?” I ask him.
Deciding that they were just going to barge the door down if I didn’t open it, there was no choice but to get up. Slowly, as if he was made of glass, I lifted Draco's head off my chest and set to move it onto the edge of the couch so as to not disrupt his sleep. Closing my eyes for a moment to let myself take in the feel of his hair on my fingers, somehow the softness of his hair was almost enough to make me forget the nagging coming from the other side of my door. Almost.
“Thank you, for the tea, and the uh, the blanket” Draco said ever so quietly, looking back at the couch for a moment before looking down at the tea again.
I'm alive, and here's a short update. Long story short a lot of shit has happened but I'm getting better and trying to get back into things I enjoy :)
The room had gone quiet, nobody really knowing who’s owl it was, or why I was getting an owl this late in the evening. It felt like hours before I slowly walked over to the window. The owl was simply waiting for me to grab the letter. Moments after doing so it found its way to Hedwig's treats.
“Well, no” We both started laughing at that. “The letter went as expected I guess?” He nodded to me as I spoke, his anxious foot tapping coming to a halt. A small smile crept up onto his face, and he leaned his elbows on the table, exaggerating his movements.
I read over the letter a few times before deciding it would do, rolling it up and tying it, I laid it next to my bedside. I’ll let his owl take it in the morning, don’t think I’ll be able to forget that. The clock read 2:47 am, so I took my glasses off and laid down, thoughts of the walk racing through my head before I finally drift off.
“The storm that has been going on for the past two or so hours?” I asked once again and almost immediately as I finished the question his head sunk low from its fake confidence position down to one of pure shame. Taking a deep breath and rubbing his face with his hands he spoke.
I hope you enjoyed it! I am attempting a bit of fanfare for myself and my friends so I describe a character a bit more than expected that's why. Most of us like very underrated characters so I'm doing my part while still writing Drarry. That counts as character content, right?
“It would if you’d really pay attention to it.” He leans over pointing exactly to the line he spoke about. “He’s obviously telling you to pick somewhere you feel comfortable.” Emphasizing the ‘you’. Mumbling something about obliviousness he goes to put the letter back down.
Swiftly I went over to start the movie, having already put it in earlier to make sure it worked. Pressing play I heard the ads start playing on the speakings, startling Draco as he jumped, making sure I kept my mouth shut.
Ever so gently he stretched his hand out to my face, using a single finger to tilt me towards the screen. It took a moment for my eyes to leave his, my sleep riddled brain not caring about the possible embarrassment. Once my focus turned towards the screen, I saw a purely black screen and that’s when I realized there was no sound besides the calming storm outside. I sat back in shock as soon as it hit my brain, a slight chuckle leaving Draco’s lips.
“It’s alright if you do.” Ron said, bringing me out of my thoughts. “Might not really get it myself but to each their own.” Tightening his hand once again before handing me the water to drink.
A soft smile creeping up on his face, it looked as if he was about to speak before the clock gifted to me by Luna a few years back went off. The weird bird thing popping out of it. Draco looked at it for a moment before panic swept across his face. Throwing the blanket off of him and scanning the room for the jacket he brought with him. Finding it, he rushed over to it, practically ripping it off the rack it was resting on.
Hermione was right behind them, seemingly on an important phone call with someone in the ministry. I’ll always be grateful she convinced Kingsley to allow muggle technology into the ministry. Ya know? Cause what else would allow my friend to work 24/7 and ignore me for an hour at my own event? Definitely one of her better achievements.
“Haven’t even started yet.” I mumble in response, finally sitting back down, my quill at the ready. “Can’t really figure out where to meet him.”  I rub my hands over my face exhaustion; I know if I don’t write it now I’ll forget by morning, but what do I do?
“Would you like to come in?” I finally spit out as I remember how to talk, moving to the side as to leave the entry open. He nods before walking past me rather quickly, the flowers blowing slightly in the wind his movement caused.
After sitting in silence for a bit longer it slowly started getting much colder. I look at my watch and realize it's been 3 hours and I told Hermione I’d be back in 2. Standing up really quickly I look down at him, obviously startled. “I told ‘Mione I’d be back an hour ago so I really need to go before she starts a full blown investigation.” I hold my hand out for him to grab, laughing at me he does.
“It felt right.” Finally looking him in the eyes. “I just really need everything to be perfect.” I sigh out, my breathing getting quick as I try to walk to finally get the drink I was going after.
I am so sorry this took so long! I didn't expect school to get the best of me but it really did. Whenever I have motivation, which was rare to begin with, I throw all of it into school work so I don't fail my senior year (I took a majority of creative classes this year and a college and pre-college course so). I really am trying to come up with a better schedule but I have a feelingI'm just going to have to sacrifice sleep to write these (like I am now since I have to get up in 6 hours, but it's okay because I can nap between classes!) So I hope you enjoy it, its the longest chapter yet at 2288 words!
“How do you figure?” I asked, trying to keep him talking for as long as possible so he doesn’t notice the struggle I’m having with the shrunken vase.
Not knowing what we were going to do now since apparently the building was far too loud. “So do you want to reschedule? Or just forget about this whole thing?” I ask him. I’d rather him have more control over all of this. Ron told me it’d be smart that way. To allow him to take a bit more control so he feels comfortable, given if need be I could getaway.
Sighing, I decided to cave. “Draco fell asleep on my couch and I don't want to wake him” Closing my eyes quickly, waiting for the yelling or enamored judgment, nothing came. Peeking through closed eyes I saw Ron’s classic smirk, while Hermione looked, well, annoyed to say the least. Finally making eye contact with Ron he winked and nudged Hermione to leave.
“I think it's quite mature of Harry, I always thought they’d have been a very good pair.” Luna said out of the blue. Her words seemingly shut everyone up. Mere seconds later everyone had gone back to what they were doing beforehand.
“I need something to put the flowers in seeing as I don’t own one of those glass things.” I hear him chuckle as I say that, not much, but it is something. “Thank you for them, by the way.” Looking back at him I see the light pink from earlier returning to his face, along with those slight wrinkles around his eyes.
We continued to stand there in silence, he barely moved past the door obviously aware of his soaked and dripping state. To put it quite simply, I couldn’t seem to take my eyes off of him. He looked so imperfect, which made him look even more perfect.
The owl came at 10pm, on a friday night, while I was entertaining friends. About anyone you’d expect was there. The twins had brought a whole trunk full of prototypes to hopefully only show people and not actively use in my house. Now that I think about it, I think they closed the trunk a lot easier at the end of the night then earlier in the evening.
“He got called away for work, apparently the potions business is very demanding.” Both of them looked at me, Neville still catching his breath before grabbing a drink. Ron nodded, before speaking up.
Nobody said anything. Everyone was conflicted. Some of us managed to forgive people quicker than others. Death eaters and the War were never really brought up anymore, so I can imagine some people weren’t particularly happy with tonight's events.
“You don’t? Even after reading the letter” He responded back, a slight smirk on his face as the owl tilted his head with him.
I’ll be awaiting a letter back, but please let my owl rest for a bit before doing so. If not he’ll tear up the parchment the moment you give it to him.
“Bloody hell Harry!” He practically shot out of his seat, laughing while holding his stomach with one arm. I joined in and suddenly the entire room was filled with our laughter, very different from a mere few minutes ago.
Until an owl landed at my window. Pulling us both out of whatever we were stuck in. His hand finally grabbed the cup and took it out of mine. Quickly, he backed up a few steps away from me. Looking at the tea for a minute before drinking it, his eyes closing and both hands coming up to rest on the cup, the same way he drank it last night.
I added the owl part from the previous eighth chapter, It deleted some comments but I feel it works better chapter wise.
According to Neville I never seem to think into people outside of what they show me. He brought that up just before the year ended. Saying I should try and understand my students better so I know exactly how to help them. And maybe he is right, Ron says I’m oblivious half the time. So maybe that’s why I don’t understand any of this, maybe I just struggle with understanding people and not just thinking about what they show me. Did I just take Draco for what he showed to the world and not what he kept hidden? I mean, he did help us in the end, that couldn’t have been a sudden idea, he had to have planned on betraying Voldemort. What if this Draco was there the whole time, but was hidden? And the man he showed was the one who was misguided and destined to lose in the end?
I back away from him to go head over to the kitchen in an attempt to get something to put the flowers into. His eyes following me as he stands there.
He tails off as he sees me walking towards the couch, sitting on the opposite end as him. Quickly fixing his posture he looks at me, his hand impulsively going to fix his hair again. Silence filled the room as we just sat looking at one another.
Nothing was said, an awkward silence filled the room for the first time since he arrived. The cup was starting to burn my hand as we just stared at one another, as if trying to study the others next move. We were good at that. Draco had always been predictable to me, his next move, next hex, or his next verbal jab, I had always been able to predict him.
“They’ve been talking recently.”He paused, smiling at me before he continued. “Draco came to him and asked for a second chance, and unlike most of us in the room, Harry is giving him that opportunity.”
We’d started walking along the sidewalk, it was typical for us. Every Saturday afternoon when we aren’t at Hogwarts we meet up here. Sitting at the table talking for a few minutes before getting up and walking as the place got crowded. We walk the same sidewalk every single time. Kind of like we’re so used to one another back at the castle that even the repetitiveness of it all doesn’t stop us.
Draco seemed to do the same thing. He didn’t want to fight anymore. I’d never thought of it till after, he was fighting just as much as I was, just with himself. He did what was best for himself just like all of us did. Our fight was over. Maybe he and I can start again. After all, what’s the point of fear and anger when he helped us in the end. Why not let him prove he changed.
He owled me early in the morning. Giving me directions to a Muggle place right outside of London. Telling me to dress casual and be there by seven. Expecting to have to go spend too much on a fancy robe, this was a nice difference. Whether he’s doing it for himself or because he’s more comfortable who knows.
“Where did you ask him to meet?” His voice being weirdly high pitched, obviously trying to seem like a gossiping teenager.
It’s not like him laying on my chest meant anything to him, or even me, maybe. Hell, I still don’t quite understand what happened, or how it happened, but it did. The image of him lying on me was engraved in my brain, it was all I could when I fell asleep after it all happened.
“That’s all we needed to know.” Laughing at the end. He grabbed her arm and tried taking her off my front step. It took a moment before she followed, mumbling about how I was obviously lying. Right before they apparated away I could hear Ron poorly attempt to soothe her.
“Maybe?” His hands tighten on my shoulder as I bring my own up to my face. Taking off my glasses before shaking my head. “Fuck Ron.” My breathing quickens again as I start to realize.
“I suppose we should actually talk, since that was the premise of this.” Looking away from me and taking a deep breath before talking again. “Putting myself in this situation, it may be best if you ask me something you want to know? So I can help fill in any of the gaps, since it seems no one informed you about me over the years” He isn’t wrong, Ron and Hermione wouldn't tell me if they knew he left. Neville told me he was unaware of anything anyone did, after all, he tends to stick to himself and his plants. Recently, he has started taking interest in a Ravenclaw girl who was at school with us. Hopefully, I’m no longer the only person he can rant to about his plants now.
“Worth a shot” Ron laughed, patting my back before walking back into the main area. Neville getting up too.
Even after the patronus was sent, Ron still banged on my door for a few moments. Going from an aggressive yelling to a gentle anger, Hermione joined in with her reasoning of “Well if you feel ill we’ll take you to a healer so you can still make the game” Ron’s agreeance nothing short of excitement still trying to badger me out of my own home.
I could try and explain why it's been months, but its all gibberish. I'm an 18 year old bisexual woman who is going to college next year. I feel like thats the easiet way to explain that. I'm forcing myself to write tonight for my other story and I've already started on pt2 of this so hopefully Im not a hipocritical idiot :)
“Thank you” Draco mumbled before quickly pushing the flowers out towards me, his arms straight out and slightly shaking. Almost pushing the bouquet straight into my nose. “I got these for you.”  His voice cracked towards the end of the sentence, using a very fake cough to cover it up as he held the flowers there, waiting for me to take them.
The moment he saw me he started waving, very enthusiastically, as normal. Chuckling at him, I went to go take my seat across the small table from him. It was a bit chilly out so he was very bundled up, unlike myself who forgot to look at what the weather was before I left. The obviously old gryffindor scarf stood out against his black coat jacket thing, it looked like one of those fancy ones that felt way heavier than it looked.
“Oh Potter.” Draco sighed, sounding almost defeated. He seemed to be contemplating how to go along with this, and at this moment I feel like I’m talking to Hermione; she always has to reword whatever she says so I actually understand. It’s not my fault she sounds like a 1800’s textbook.
“We need to know his excuse for leaving us on edge!” He said exasperated, acting as if he might faint. “How dare he leave us waiting this long for a letter!” Neville's laughter could be heard all throughout the kitchen. Ron slowly joined him. Shortly all of us were laughing at ourselves, the whole situation seems ridiculous.
Hope this wasn't too long of a wait! I'm writing this as I'm in a sociology class and started it when I was in my college English class
Deciding instantly that while I don’t know how this happened, I couldn’t stop it. I cast a Patronus telling Ron and ‘Mione I was feeling ill and couldn't make it.
Glancing from his hands back to his eyes “What are you holding?” I ask. His face contorting to confusion and then shock/
So he left, that’s why I never got the chance. Thinking back it makes sense, it didn’t back then. Everyone accused of being a Death Eater got heavily investigated, many now reside in Azkaban. His parents made it out though, now just having limitations on them, at least that’s what Hermione told me.
Once again he had to drag me out of my thoughts, only this time was to throw one of the tea packets I left on the table from last night for him, square in my face, successfully knocking my glasses off. Carefully, I grabbed the warm cup of tea I made along with my coffee, the statis charm still keeping it almost steaming. Making eye contact with his still oh so Slytherin glare, I held the cup out to him.
Remembering the Gryffindor part of me, I start to walk towards his table. The adrenaline going through me reminded me of catching the snitch.
Closing the door once again, I turned around to see Draco still sound asleep where I left him. How he slept through all of that I’ll never know. Chuckling at him, knowing full well I would not be able to sleep after all of that. Deciding to instead go make myself a coffee and the tea he picked last night. Maybe he won’t yell at me when he wakes up?
“It's just kinda ridiculous, doing all of this for him” His hand goes to point in every direction. From the constantly reheating tea kettle on the table that Hermione took days to teach me how to do. To the kitchen floor, where we could practically see our own reflection.
“Honestly Harry we need to get going if we plan on making it to the game at all.” Rang Hermione's voice as what I’m now guessing was Ron's first upon my door.
“Um- yeah, I’m alright just a bit tired” I awkwardly pushed out, trying to add a chuckle while rubbing my hand along the back of my neck to make myself not seem so stiff. “Are you?”He looked up at me almost with a puzzled look, after a few moments he seemed to remember what state he was in and let out a soft chuckle.
“It’s from Neville,sent me a- vase is what it’s called apparently, for the flowers you bought last night” I said as I finally grabbed it, the owl above chirping as I did.
Ron was surprisingly supportive of my whatever you call it with Draco. “Good on you mate.” He seemed actually happy about the whole situation. Claiming that I needed to get out and talk to people other than my students. He went on and on about how Draco may even be able to help with my teaching, which felt a lot like an insult to me.
“I’ll owl you, really, you need to go so Granger doesn’t send the entire ministry after me.” This time I laugh. Nodding at him I start to walk towards the apparition point. Looking back right before I go I see him looking right back at me, he waves with a smile before heading towards the brightly lit street.
“You honestly think we believe that?” She said, faking her own cough with a deathly glare boring its way into my head. Ron puffed his chest out and nodded behind her, trying to cover up that he believed me. “Just tell us the truth and we’ll see if it's good enough” Ron leaned over to whisper something in her ear, probably how they were already late for the game since it caused her to smack his arm. Turning her gaze back on me as Ron rubbed his arm while rolling his eyes. Crossing her arms and starting to tap the same foot she lodged in my doorway as time went on.
“So?” Ron said, sitting in the chair I was going to sit, grabbing a drink off the counter and taking a sip.
“Got about twenty more of those, apparently he was very talkative after your ‘hangout’” He smirked once again, pulling his phone away from me and tucking it back in his pocket. The look on my face must have been abnormal because the face Neville made was one of pure joy. “I can’t tell you what he said” A slight chuckle escaped him as I felt my face fall, the hope of knowing what Draco said fading away. Neville patted my shoulder as a look that looked too similar to pity came onto his face.
“We were accquatices back at school” He started as his laughter died down “She didn’t quite believe I was who I said I was, she was right but it was still annoying” Picking up the happy owl he continued. “She helped me during the war, more so how to get out after it all went down. Stayed with her for a bit after so I wouldn’t be stuck at the manor.” Sipping the tea once again as the owl burrowed into his neck.
Draco wakes up, and I write myself into the story more to help him open up a bit more to Harry and give Neville content
I’m sorry this letter was later than the last, I’m afraid I was called away on business shortly after our walk. You’d be shocked how quickly you must move in the potions business. I do hope this finds you at a somewhat reasonable hour, but knowing my owl I will be sorely mistaken. Acts like a child really, does what he wants when he wants without my supervision.
“Mione told me there was a huge potions raid a few nights ago in France, both the French and our ministry are freaking out. If anything that’s probably why he got called away.”  It’d make sense, some potion ingredients are so rare that the ministry will launch undercover missions to find them if they so much get out of place.
“Yeah, it’s going great.” We're standing in front of the door now, I open it for him and he walks out halfway before turning around. “Make sure you write him back before you sleep, otherwise you’ll forget.” He says before walking down the street.
Leaving him to ransack my kitchen, I went up to my room to write the owl. I still hadn’t thought of where we could go. I don’t really go anywhere, everyone just comes to me, so picking somewhere was-
Apparently I had haphazardly and on complete accident chosen a documentary on muggle space studies. I could not be bothered to pay attention, but Draco’s eyes had been glued to the screen the entire time. Every time a rocket took off his head moved to follow it from the ground up, even going as far as leaning into the screen to watch it closely.
“I’ll owl you. Okay?” He said as he was opening the door, I nodded which caused a small smile to show on his face. “Watch that owl by the way, he’s extremely spoiled he’ll scream for attention” The owl chirped to prove Draco’s point. Chuckling he waved goodbye as he was walking out the door. “See you later Harry.” He said as he walked down the steps, the owl started to screech and he stopped and chuckled. “Goodbye Francis.” The owl chirped and got silent as Draco appeared away.
As soon as the door opened all I saw was a flash of red and green, granted, the color combination is not my favorite, I wasn’t scared. As quickly as they showed up, they disappeared.
“Figured it was only right to bring something since it is your home after all Potter.” Now was my turn to laugh, enunciating ‘Potter’ to replicate how he used to say it back at school. His laugh echoing mine for a sheer moment. “Besides, the shop was on the way. Was far too nice to pass up.”
It took him over a week to owl me. With anybody else this wouldn’t have been that big of a deal, but this is Draco Malfoy. The guy who would throw out his robes if so much as one stitch came loose. Last time he owled me it took 8 hours, maybe even shorter because I woke up with his owl already waiting for me.
“So who’s owl is it?” He asked as I grabbed the envelope from the little owl, the thing was staring up at me in complete wonder for some reason. Opening it I heard a clinking noise, looking down I’d noticed a small, almost toy like container had fallen out. Reading the paper as I picked it up.
“What else could you possibly mean?” Confusion clear in my voice, my head slightly tilted to the side.
`The owl Draco said he’d send didn’t come until late that night, I had just gotten back from a mandatory dinner with the Weasleys when I noticed it land. I was grabbing the parchment before I’d even realized I had moved. The jacket I was taking off landed somewhere out of my path.
I’ll be awaiting an owl back for whatever day and time you choose based on your work, there’s no pressure, I can wait as long as you need.
Slowly I see Draco pull something out of his jacket. Noticing quickly that it looks like a book I start to wonder who would bring a book to, well, whatever this is considered. He very quickly flips through the pages before handing it to me. On the outside it just looks like a basic book you’d see in a shop. Opening it I realized it was so much more.
After a few moments, I realize I don’t own anything to put these in. So I head over to the parchment I have waiting by the window to write a letter to Neville, asking if I can borrow one of his pots whenever he gets it.
“Not before tonight” I reply back after taking a sip of the cold water. My breathing had already started to slow. “I never think about things like this.”
Pressing play on the remote I was luckily able to skip through the ads on this one. This particular movie played quite loud so I turned the volume down as  I sunk into the couch. Spelling the lights even darker as to match the time, I decided to close my eyes, not expecting to be as tired as I was.
We kept walking as normal, silence filling the air around us as it normally does. Only the passing cars and birds creating the only noise around us. I couldn’t stop thinking about what he had said the entire time until I got home. Did it go well or was Neville being sarcastic? The whole falling asleep on me somehow then me basically cuddling up to him isn’t exactly how friends ‘hangouts’ go, especially when said ‘friend’ used to be someone you hated. The whole situation was confusing, it was two friends hanging out right? That’s all it was, we’re friends now, we’ve talked, he’s opened up, we’re friends so that's all it was.
Laying him down completely and gently sliding my hands out from under him, I take a second just to look at him. The way his hair is shining in the sunlight peeking through my windows. The slight smile etched on his face as he once again digs his head deeper into the pillow, a sigh of what I hope is content barely making any noise. His fingers gripping the blanket he somehow wrapped around himself. Everything about him just looked so peaceful and undefiantly beautiful.
Ron came into my view, his drink no longer in his hand. Placing his hand on my shoulder and moving so I could see him in the mirror.
“No, I don’t.” Reaching down to pick up the glass shards he mumbles a quick incanation, reforming the glass before I could grab it.
It took a bit of time unrolling it, the man had decided to add a weirdly shaped wax stamp to the front of it which would not break. It took everything in me to not rip the paper apart.
Neville was already sitting at the table when I walked up. Still, I was ten minutes early, but he’d obviously already been here for a bit. Thankfully, he’d decided on an outside seating since nobody else was around. He was anxiously tapping his foot against the concrete, quietly sipping his drink. Knowing him, it was probably hot chocolate.
I'm sorry this took so long and its not exactly what y'all might want. I used to write late at night (Around 1-3am) but with school, I have to go to sleep around midnight so I can actually focus. I'm working on doing things in between or directly after classes.
“McGonagall thought it was a good idea. We spent most of our time thereafter the war,  didn't really want to leave in the end.” It was the truth, I felt as if I left that I’d be leaving without a part of myself.  We walked in silence again for a bit, it was a comfortable silence, like when Ron and I have to wait and see if one of his ideas blows up. “You can continue with your answer if you still want.”
“Well, there weren’t too many people there. Just me, a lone girl, and  this couple off to the corner, who seemed to be playfully arguing about whether or not the shorter really needed this big bouquet of yellow daisies.” Stretching his arms rather quickly he continues. “The lone girl had been constantly picking up different sets of flowers. Going between these colorful lilies and sunflowers the size of her head. Believe she left with both if I’m not mistaken." He stops talking abruptly as I head back to the kitchen, not without running into a chair in the process.
“Ah, yes. Well, obviously I didn’t mean you were better than me in the sense of marks. But as a person, you had me beat. You did everything you could to win a war you didn’t even want to fight. It was obvious, in the end, that you wanted it all to be over, you could see it in your eyes. I wanted it to be over too, helping you helped myself.” He pointed to a bench by a small pond, “Would you like to go sit with me, so we don’t have the possibility of getting hit by a car?” I nodded and we started to head over that way.
"How could you not? You're constantly watching him." Harry flipped Ron off and kept his head down as he ate.
“No, I think he got Harry something else.” Their staring contest continued. He wouldn't break. He wouldn't look away. He was a damn Malfoy, a Slytherin.
. He had tried talking his mother into selling the place, but she had refused so far. Maybe it was just his imagination, but he swore he could see her resolve crumbling day by day.
“Probably worried,” Draco admitted. “We had dinner. With Teddy, of course. He told me it was good to see me. And... Teddy asked me to come back next week when he'd be there.”
Ron looked up at a throat clearing. Malfoy was standing behind Harry with a large package in his hand. Ron raised an eyebrow at him.
Harry subtly glanced at the chair across the fire from him, where Malfoy had one of his textbooks open and was taking notes on a piece of parchment. Immediately aware of eyes on him, Malfoy looked up. Harry asked a question with his eyes and a small head tilt, and Malfoy gave the smallest of nods.
Draco had been hesitant, even as he'd accepted it, but he’d ended up liking it. He got to be in a back room almost all the time, working on potions and creating things, almost never interacting with customers. His favorite part was that he was able to invent new potions or concoctions to sell in the store.
could just go back into the Wizarding World and be an upstanding citizen. Is he doing anything... suspicious? Have you seen him hiding anything, talking to anyone outside of Hogwarts? Does he sneak off on his own?” Harry immediately brought the apple away from his face.
It took him a while to magic all of the banners down and into a bag, seeing as there were so many. He wasn't exactly sure why he didn't just charm them away, but he eventually decided it was because it would be more satisfying to physically throw them out. Once he started removing them, he realized they were actually birthday cards from his fans. Draco grimaced.
“I think I'm the only one who's going to tell you to stop being an ass, even though we're all thinking it.” Harry's glare returned full force. Draco could hear that everyone in the common room had stopped talking. Without looking away from Harry's eyes, he knew they were all staring at him.
“Wait, I... I never got a chance to thank you in person.” Harry quirked an eyebrow. “For defending me as a witness at my trial. And my mother at hers. I... I could never repay you for that, never make it up to you.” Harry felt his skin turn hot at the things Malfoy could do that would absolutely
Before Draco could respond, Teddy had reappeared in the kitchen and was grabbing Harry’s hand to drag him to the ‘clean’ living room.
Draco gulped. He had never, in all his guesses, come up with anything remotely close to that. He almost wanted to say something kind, or at least not rude. But clearly, he didn't come to him for that.
“You absolute arsehole!” He yelled, turning around on the couch to throw a wadded up piece of wrapping at him. It fell short. When Draco met his eyes, Harry was still grinning widely. He shook his head as he turned back around, but Draco watched from the corner of his eye as he continued studying the replica of the Potter Stinks button from their fourth year. Eventually, Harry pinned it to the front of his shirt before turning to the next present.
“That was really nice of you. Kind of uncharacteristically, you know?” Draco already had excuses for that. He wasn't an idiot.
Draco had gone home yesterday, and as almost always, done nothing on a Friday night. He'd read a novel and listened to the highlights of a recent Quidditch match, and that was about it. George and his friends pestered him to have more of a social life, but Draco was genuinely fine spending most of his time at home.
Harry watched from across the room. The boy he was intently observing continued scratching his quill across his parchment without looking up. Like he hadn’t noticed Harry watching him, or maybe just didn’t care.
He listened to the radio as he worked. After a nice streak of songs Draco enjoyed, and even started whistling to, the news came on. He half-listened to some stories on a huge Muggle event in London that would cause a lot of extra foot traffic in the city, an update on the new coffee shop that was set to open in Knockturn Alley in two weeks, and the week's Quidditch scores.
Hermione and Ron exchanged a glance, then Hermione gestured with her chin towards Harry. Ron sighed.
The Gryffindors hurried to finish breakfast so they could race to the Quidditch pitch. Ginny carefully tested the broom first, moving only in small lines a foot above the field. She traveled a bit higher every minute, still moving cautiously. It took 20 minutes before she finally zoomed off properly. It was like nothing they had ever seen before – she was practically a red blur in the air.
about him. “Anyway, what are you thinking for Ron, now? You've been spending time and playing chess with him, gave him that gift for Hermione, done the food route.” Malfoy sighed.
Within a month, Draco was moved into Harry's old apartment. With all the paperwork and the process of moving in and out, he saw Harry regularly for two weeks. And then he was officially settled in, and he barely spoke to Harry again until today.
“He – well, Teddy – invited me in. I actually stayed... for a few hours.” Draco refused to look up, but there was a prolonged silence.
It was mostly because of this that Ron was polite enough to Malfoy and honored the truce. He certainly wasn't his friend and he still didn't understand it, but if Harry asked him to be nice, he could.
It grew weirdly quiet as Harry opened the small package. Draco still hadn't looked away from where he was picking the good parts out of a bowl of 'trail mix', he thought Hermione had called it. There was a gasp, probably from Hermione when she realized what it was, but Harry just burst out laughing. Draco tried to hold back a smile that was threatening to show.
“What the hell are you doing?” he heard Weasel's grating yell before he noticed them entering the room. Draco merely glared at him as he charmed the last card into the large bag he'd whipped up.
There was a flood of noise circling Harry – owls, laughter, clinks of silverware against plates, happy conversations. But he had tuned it all out to watch the blond at the Slytherin table.
Draco took the tea from Kreacher with a 'thank you' and settled back into the couch. Without really seeing Harry for years, Draco had managed to almost entirely eradicate his...
"You don't actually think he's up to something, do you?" Harry turned red as he snapped his eyes away from Malfoy. He shrugged.
“Came to see why someone was out here so late, saw it was you. I got distracted, what can I say?” Harry was grinning at him, the smile twisting his insides and pissing him off and making his heart clench.
There had been rumors and gossip for weeks whenever they'd managed to get pictures of Harry alone with Cho, Luna, and virtually any other girl Harry spoke to. There had even been a time they had captured Harry and Hannah together in the minutes Neville went to the bathroom. Once they had tried to claim something about Granger, but the rumor was that Harry had stormed into the Prophet's office, and whatever he said to threaten them worked, because Draco had never seen a second rumor about her.
“As delicate as I should expect from you, Potter.” Still grinning, Harry leaned closer so that he could press a slow, tantalizing kiss to his lips.
When he returned to work Tuesday, Draco made a face as he looked over the list. George rolled his eyes.
He'd just spent the evening with Harry Potter after barely speaking to him in years. Draco took a deep breath.
He'd asked Harry, and they'd brainstormed some half-decent ideas, but none of them seemed good enough. He'd even asked Ginny, knowing there was plenty Hermione only shared with her. His sister had merely rolled her eyes and said that
“Yes, Draco. Just like practically every weekend since you've started working here, students bought a bunch of love potions. Stop pretending you hate the smell of yours. I'm ninety percent sure that's impossible.” Draco just made the same face again at George and went into his workshop without responding.
“Don't you think...” she hesitated, long enough that he finally broke his concentration to meet her eyes. She took a deep breath and restarted. “Don't you think, perhaps, we should work on our Charms essays?” Harry finally glanced down at the parchment sitting in front of him – completely blank.
It occurred to him that, like Harry, he'd done something with his career that no one had considered. But it worked for him. Surprisingly, it had been George that approached him at Teddy's second birthday party at the Burrow.
“Right. Because I'm the only one who doesn't mind insulting you. What a romantic reason.” Harry almost glared at him.
"No… but you've been staring at him. Quite a bit." Harry's flush grew and he started writing something, even if it was just nonsense.
It probably didn't hurt that Kingsley Shacklebolt had taken over as permanent Minister of Magic. Draco had learned that he had been working with the Order throughout the war. Undoubtedly that meant he had even worked with Harry.
And if Harry had sprung it on him all at once.... would he have? He closed his eyes when he realized he didn't know.
Harry figured he'd have to have another conversation with Malfoy at some point, but he wasn't expecting it to be immediately after breakfast. The blond was sitting against the window right outside the Great Hall, but jumped to his feet when the Gryffindor troop entered the hall.
“Thanks.” I nodded back as he took another sip of his drink. Someone came out and placed what I’m presuming to be my drink.
Requests for any type of writing (besides nsfw) are open on my tumblr @plutodexay! Thank you for reading!
“Harry.” His voice gets quieter as he speaks. Taking a deep breath he looks back up at me. “Do you think it's possible you, um, well. Fuck alright.” He stands up quickly, putting his hands on my shoulder before continuing. Taking a breath to fix his words. “Is it possible you have some sort of romantic interest in Draco?”
“They’re friends” An exaggerated nod and a very unsuccessfully held back laugh was how Neville responded. Throwing his cup away in the bin on the side of the road. As he came back to walk next to me he grabbed a muggle phone out of his pocket only to shove it in my direction, the screen was covered in what looked to be a very long message.
Sighing, I walked over to him to tie the parchment to his leg and then opened the window, more than ready to rid my house of him. Only for him to rub against my hand and nibble the tip of my finger. Looking back up at me before biting hard on my finger before flying out. It really makes sense why this is Draco Malfoy's owl.
Neville came in shortly after, who surprisingly was only fifteen minutes early as opposed to his usual thirty. He’d walked in apologizing for being late, of course it was only late on his terms.  Ron acted surprised and accused him of forgetting about us, he even did this whole monologue about lost friendship as he was putting his candy into all my clean bowls. He told us matter of factly he’d been late because he’d been on a walk with the Ravenclaw he’d been talking too and he’d simply lost track of time. Next thing I know there's candy on my floor and Ron is standing right infront of him trying to pry the details out of him.
Harry set the paper down beside him and filled his plate, looking over the picture. It was a surprisingly nice picture of Malfoy – he was grinning, maybe even laughing at something one of his friends had said as they walked down the streets of Hogsmeade. There was silence among his friends as Hermione and Ron finished reading the article. He knew they were staring at him, or maybe having a silent conversation about him, but he ignored them and tried to eat his breakfast in peace.
Of course he knew that. How could he not? It had been plastered in the Daily Prophet for the entire week leading up to it. Not to mention that people kept talking about it. Like it was some public holiday for them to celebrate.
“Draco, you continue to surprise me. I had no idea you were so perverted!” Draco flushed and glared across the desk. “A fun idea, but no. I was thinking more of, like... a date night line? My first idea was a bit of a confidence potion. A little more than a Draught of Peace that only dulls the anxiety.” Draco nodded, intrigued. His mind was already racing to think of what ingredients would be needed to create that.
Not because he was avoiding the love potions or anything, he started by working on the confidence potion first. The book he'd read on his day off had given him a few new ideas that he was excited to try. He had a long parchment with lists of ideas, a quill ready to put an X beside them when they failed, and notes if they gave him any insight.
“Can I have a biscuit?” Draco was impressed when Harry only laughed at Teddy’s impressive puppy-dog eyes.
He didn't want to upset Teddy, but the boy would have to understand. He saw Teddy at least once or twice a week already. Besides, it wasn't like the boy didn't have enough attention with just one of them there.
“Oh, just wonderful. We’re reading Agatha Brown’s latest novel.” Draco forced himself to reign in a smirk. Agatha Brown wrote what Draco – and many others – considered trashy romance books. “Everything went well, I take it?”
"Malfoy." Harry slowly walked to one of the owls nearest Malfoy, digging around in his bag for the letter. "Is he yours?"
“Well then, Harry's sitting right there,” she pointed out quietly. Malfoy laughed. Actually laughed.
Apparently, Harry had mentioned how talented Draco was at Potions – and intelligent in general – and George threw out the idea of Draco coming to work with him. Draco had not been able to get that out of his mind for weeks – Harry had not only been talking about him, but
“You guys aren't even angry anymore. You're smiling at each other when you bicker. You get up in each other's faces. You can feel the attraction coming off of the both of you. It's sickening, really. It's like you don't even care that we're watching.”
“What are you on about?” He looked around the room, but everyone else was either grinning at him, laughing, or looking embarrassed. “I don't flirt with anyone.” It was hard enough for him just to say the word.
“It was a really nice gift, Draco. Just admit you can actually be thoughtful.” Draco ignored him. Eventually he heard Potter settle into bed. Draco read the same page in his book a dozen times in a row without absorbing anything except that Potter had called him Draco.
“You are definitely a masochist. You enjoy being insulted and bullied, and you refuse to stop getting in trouble.” Harry made an over-the-top thinking face.
“What? When?” Draco asked without looking up. He quickly cast a warming spell on his hands, cursing himself for forgetting his gloves.
It was ten minutes before he could no longer stop himself from glancing up. Just like he’d known, Malfoy was reading the paper. He traced his fingers along his lip as he read, deep in thought. Harry wanted to know what he was reading, what was going through his brain, what his lips must feel like-
“You are such an idiot, Potter.” Potter finally met his eyes. “Such a Golden Boy that you can't even let people be nice to you. Dial down the hero complex a tad, would you?” Harry rolled his eyes, but Draco was fairly certain he was hiding a slight smile when he turned away.
When he'd shown up at the café, Harry seemed somewhat nervous, too. But he'd wanted to meet for a reason Draco's wild imagination had never thought of – he hated his apartment. Draco hadn't even known Harry had inherited the old Black apartment from Sirius – hadn't even known
The living room was a clutter of toys and books, and for some reason the couch pillows on the floor. Draco raised an eyebrow at Potter. “You really are having fun.” Potter gave a ghost of the trademark grin Draco hadn't seen in so long.
“You always carry your cloak with you, then?” Harry's mouth opened in shock, then he saw where it was in his hand and grinned, moving to fold it up.
They actually ended up playing two rounds, with both of them winning once. Both were close games. As much as Ron hated to admit it, Malfoy was right; he didn't know of anyone else in Hogwarts who could give him such a challenge. No matter how smart his girlfriend was, she just didn't have the experience with the game to compete with him. They still played regularly, but it was nothing like playing Malfoy.
Draco opened and closed his mouth twice, then kept it shut with his mouth pressed tightly together. True to his word, Potter did not bother Draco. They continued in their work for another two hours, at which point Potter finally decided to pack up. Draco looked at the clock and realized he should probably be leaving soon as well.
After his lunch break, he knew he had to make the love potions. The potions were much weaker than Amortentia, of course. They would only last an hour, perhaps two if the victim was small. After a lot of outcry – mostly from Granger and Harry – they had adjusted the recipe so that it wouldn’t make anyone do anything they didn’t want to do. All it really did was enhance the giver’s best traits and make the receiver more eager to admit their feelings and act on them.
“What do you mean?” Harry interrupted. “It's perfect!” He reached out to swipe frosting off with his finger, but Draco leaned down and smacked his hand away.
Despite how obvious his friends found him, he didn't think his mother had any idea of his feelings for the man. He'd made a point of even limiting how much he talked about Harry in any capacity. Then again, if he really had a look like his friends claimed, maybe his mother was familiar with it, too.
Ron's stomach churned uncomfortably at the idea that Harry was worried because of him. Was Harry afraid that he would freak out on him? Attack Malfoy? …Ask Harry to choose between them?
“Why am I flirting?” Harry laughed without humor. “Well, Draco. You see, when a wizard likes another wizard, that's usually how they communicate it to them.” Draco could tell he was being overly-sarcastic to cover his embarrassment. He was far too familiar with the tactic.
“You're the only worthy opponent, probably in the whole school.” Ron's arrogant face faltered at the seemingly sincere compliment from their once rival.
“It's a little small for two people. You'll have to stay close.” Draco smiled at the suggestive look on his face.
“You will never forget that I cut you into pieces, that what most people think is my bravery is actually just utter recklessness, that I'm an idiot half the time. You know that I'm a pretty shit student and don't treat my friends as well as I should and can't shut up to save my life if someone pisses me off. You see all of that and don't try to erase it or excuse it, you just accept that as part of me.
Did they have something he wanted? Ron had been racking his brain for ages, but couldn't think of anything. Was he trying to get the Golden Trio to let down their guard? It was possible, but again, why? Even Ron could admit that there was no realistic way Malfoy could do anything evil at Hogwarts – he had tracking spells placed on him, a parole officer, and all of his spells were monitored. He had to follow strict parole guidelines until he left Hogwarts in a few months.
Someone in Potter's group mentioned presents, and the few around them cheered for Potter and Longbottom to open their gifts. The rest of the room joined in as Weasley and Thomas grabbed several piles of presents and dropped them on the table in front of Potter and Longbottom.
“You sit next to me in review sessions. You study with me in the library. You walk the halls with me.” Harry waited for him to continue, but he didn't.
“Actually, I've been thinking.” Draco groaned. He hated when George had been thinking. George just grinned. “I've been thinking we should have a section of the store – just a small part of it – dedicated to the adult market.” Draco made a face.
It became a regular occurrence for Malfoy to casually offer him extra treats from Honeydukes or whatever his mother had sent him, so regular that Ron eventually forgot to be weirded out by it.
Malfoy licked a long stripe up his neck, causing Harry to shiver. There was a noise which must have been someone trying to open the door, which was easy to ignore when Malfoy was intently sucking a lovebite into his neck. When he nipped at his collarbone, one of his hands suggestively running along the edge of his pants, Harry groaned. “God, you're so hot.”
"Everyone," Ron muttered under his breath. Harry flushed and hid the map under his pillow where he often kept it.
“It's all right, Hermione. I know the other person isn't going to cave, so I doubt they'll figure it out. They'll get bored by the end of tonight.”
It bothered Hermione almost as much as him for the first few weeks, trying to figure out just what Malfoy's plan was. But after a certain point, she seemed to accept that he was just trying to be nice. Anytime Ron would bring it up she'd roll her eyes.
“I don’t know if I ever actually hated you, Draco.” He'd never said the name before, at least not that he could remember. It felt almost
He wasn't even sure where he was going until he was most of the way to the lake. Even though there was a giant sea monster in it, the lake always seemed like the calmest place at Hogwarts to him. Besides, he desperately needed fresh air.
His feelings had lingered after graduating, but had lessened over time when he stopped interacting with or seeing him on a regular basis. But he couldn't lie to himself and pretend they were ever gone. Even now, five years after graduating, he still felt his heart flip or his breath catch when he noticed Harry in public or saw a picture of him in the Prophet. At least he barely thought about it anymore when Harry wasn’t in his day to day life.
“And I see you, Draco. I see you put up with the bullshit people say and the Prophet writes about you so much better than I do. And they're saying positive things about me! After everything you went through, you resisted and became a good person anyway. You couldn't kill Dumbledore when you life depended on it. You saved me in the Manor. You knew it was me, because you've always been able to see me. But you saved me anyway.
“Mate, we've just noticed... you've been spending a lot of time watching Malfoy. Studying him. Following him. I know, it's because you're figuring out what he's doing. But...” Ron looked to Hermione.
Potter. He'd save the entire Wizarding World, faced death half a dozen times and won, and he could tell a bloke that he liked him. Even if the bloke was Draco Malfoy.
“I'm sorry, Harry.” He looked up to see his friend looking at him sympathetically. “I... I shouldn't have said anything. It's really none of our business unless you want to tell us.” Harry shrugged.
But Weasley nodded enthusiastically. “Sure. That makes sense.” Her voice verged on sounding like she didn't think it did. “We were wondering more about how you knew what kind of party Harry would enjoy?” The unspoken
“And I'm the idiot,” He muttered, coming back to sit even with Draco. “I don't like being around you because you argue with me or insult me. I like that you aren't
“You all right, mate?” Ron looked up from his barely touched plate to Harry, who was looking at him in concern. “Something wrong?”
When they didn't say anything, Draco tried to ignore them. Even though he was reading – or trying to – he could see them having some kind of discussion silently. There were hand movements and gestures and eventually Ginny grunted when Hermione must have elbowed her. After that, they tried to act normally and started filling up their plates.
“Hey!” Weasley called out, interrupting the peaceful quiet. “Where'd you get that?” Granger looked like she was going to chastise the red head, then noticed what he was asking about.
“No, I just...” He sighed. He had not met Draco's eyes since the beginning of the conversation. “You are the only person I know that doesn't like me.” Draco scoffed.
