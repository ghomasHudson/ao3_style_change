"Oh, shush. Now, back to funner talk, tell me about the cuties here at Hogwarts." Alice smirked, and Asteria was struck by how similar they were, in truth. Alice Joseph was Asteria's best friend, a half-blood whose family had fled from England back in the time of darkness from Grindelwald.
Headmaster Dumbledore.
The deep blue triple-decker bus slammed to a sudden stop in front of him, and the door opened, revealing a young wizard Draco had seen. It was Shane O'Connor, and Draco honed in all homicidal rage, knowing it wouldn't do him good to kill the wizard just yet. O'Conner stepped aside allowing Draco to step inside. Draco walked into the bus and took a spot on an empty bed, behind the very old driver, who Draco assumed was Ernie Prang.
"What if Potter deserved it?" And she looked at him, her eyes wide.
At the start of the school year, Asteria and Draco flooed to the Weasley's as Potter would be arriving with Albus. Asteria was a bit perplexed by that one but dealt with it as she had dealt with everything over the summer. Her meticulous training of Potter and Draco. Playing naive to their budding relationship, which as far as she could tell hadn't gone further than a few kisses and late nights on the back porch, thankfully. How she dealt with the moving house and supplying food and comfort for the two young wizards in her life, how she dreamt of Charlie and had nightmares of Voldemort and her father, losing the ones she loved the most. How her father's lessons on emotions suddenly always came to mind in the dim twilight of each day, but she pushed the thoughts from her head. She rested on the couch as Molly moved worriedly over them both, not speaking, and then dragging Draco upstairs to put him in Percy's room since she'd be staying in Charlie's room.
Advance Potions - Snape 9 am
"Have you tried a higher location?" Draco asked, taking a sip of his tea. He winced as the three older wizards looked at him sharply.
"Bloody hell, a task in the Black Lake." She muttered, as she stood, and dried her hair with her wand and began the long walk back to the dungeons. She'd have to let Potter know, she'd have to hear the song himself. Simply encase the songs differed from egg to egg. Once back in her common rooms, she was shocked to find the majority of upperclassmen,  4th year to 6th, and Professor Snape, and she slipped inside.
"Asteria, are you sure you should be out of bed? You took some serious injuries, last night." He asked, his voice soothing.
"I will inform those who need to know." Dumbledore stood, walking from behind his desk, he leaned on the front before her. "What you figured out, Ms. Black may help us all survive. However, whatever Tom is searching for in the Ministry, could be even worse for us."
Five delicate hours later, they, except for Sirius, poured up to the fireplace to floo, which Asteria wasn't looking forward too. She hated flooing, especially since turning 17 she preferred apperating, but Molly had insisted. The Weasley children had livened up after getting some sleep and were full of chatter. Potter was faking his way through the chatter, and Asteria was too tired to be full of energy, having not slept yet, instead cleaning up the kitchen, and arranging for all their trunks to arrive with Granger later in the afternoon so she had spent some extra time transfiguring everyone's pajamas into proper attire, which had also been a tiring process. She almost passed at the chance to go but decided she needed to keep up appearances, sliding her hood over her head to avoid attracting too much attention. But she was attending to add protection and support; since they couldn't request for Auror protection, and being the only one besides Molly to legally perform magic, she had to go; according to Sirius.
"What about Hogwarts?" She asked, wondering about Albus.
Asteria stumbled into the classroom holding the Goblet, in her rumpled clothes and a piece of toast in her mouth. Students were surrounding the glowing circle around the Goblet. She watched as the identical Weasley boys made their attempt to enter, and nearly dropped her toast, as they were flung past her, grazing her and hitting the ground. Her eyes wide, the toast hanging from her lips, watching as their identical red hair fade into grey and long beards sprouted from their faces. They looked at each other with astonishing looks on their faces and the room was deafeningly silent. When a shocked sound exploded from her lips, and her toast dropped to the floor, and laughter bubbled out. Her knees caved, as she hit the ground, laughing at the Weasley twins, and as they stared at her, they busted out laughing as well, and it was followed by the rest of the students in the room.
"Potter, Happy late Birthday," She smiled, handing him the quidditch things she bought him, and he beamed at her. She reach in and grabbed two of the magical quills, and handed them to Granger, "Congratulations on making Prefect, Granger," the young witch smiled, and she turned to Ron, "And for you, Weasley, congratulations," Asteria said, pulling out the Nimbus 2002, she bought him, and his eyes sprung with tears, "Your mother asked me to get you a broom; she paid for most of it, I simply covered the last of it." Asteria smiled at Molly, "And don't worry about that Molly, I wanted to help with buying him the broom, it's a great accomplishment to become Prefect, I'm quite proud as well." She clapped Ron on the shoulder, "Now, I think I'll take my things upstairs to my room. It was exhausting out there today, honestly, I don't know how you've done it for your all your children all these years, Molly. You are truely the best kind of mother, I hope your kids realize just how lucky they are to have you, sometimes, I wish my mother did the things you do, it's beautiful to see real love between a mother and her children." Asteria said, touching her shoulder, and she saw tears brimming Molly's eyes, and she nodded, and let her slip up the stairs.
"You don't have to do this."
"As I mentioned earlier, you aren't allowed to be caught, it will draw too much-unwanted attention to yourself." He finished, straightening as Ravenclaw's and Slytherin's came into the door, alike. He flashed her a knowing look and she sighed, preparing for her class.
"What sat at the floor of my office at Hogwarts?"
"I just don't know why you have to be such a prat," Potter grumbled.
"You'll just have to learn on your own, Ms. Black. I'm sure you are capable, though I'm sure you know much about the subject matter." His response didn't shock her, but she still grew slightly irritated.
"Oh Merlin, this doesn't sound promising," Asteria mumbled, and stopped, focusing on her little brother. "Draco, did you hear who was the last person to see Alice?"
"I know, but honestly, it's not completely his fault, our father gave him orders to make your life difficult. And Draco wants to make our father proud. Don't ask me why, that part is beyond me, honestly. My father is a slimy git, and I've been itching to punch him in the throat." Asteria responded.
"I think I know how he did it. How Voldemort was able to stay somewhat alive all these years." She exclaimed.
-Dinner- 5pm
"Well, I didn't actually hear anything, I was hiding in a bush." She responded to her friend and tried to flinch at the outrageous gasp from Potter's friends.
"I knew it, the final fight will come down to Potter and Voldemort. And lastly, I want Potter to come to stay with me." She finished, just as Dumbledore went to open his mouth, she lifted her hand. "I understand the protections laid upon his home, to protect him from Voldemort and his followers, BUT it doesn't protect him from muggles. Those muggle relatives have abused him enough, and he'll need around the clock training to prepare him. And I can offer him that as well as constant protection. But he cannot go back there, it won't be safe. It'll never safe for him to rejoin the muggle world, not until Voldemort is defeated."
"You're okay," Draco whispered against Harry's neck as he let out a breath. Harry pulled back, pressing a deep kiss to Draco, before releasing him. Harry barely had a chance as Molly rushed forward and pulled him into a hard hug.
"Yes, during the First Task, the dragon was distracted by the noise, and the people distracted by the dragon. It isn't an invisibility charm." She explained, and step to the side for Potter.
"Who's the person?"
"You are brilliant," Weasley muttered, studying the parchment she had written on.
"The hell, Lupin?" Draco shouted, and tried to reach for Harry.
History of Magic - Binns 2 pm
Draco kept to the dark, his arms draped over Harry's shoulders, but he wasn't listening. He really couldn't lose Harry as well as his sister. But he'd find her, he knew what he was going to do, he had spoken to Tonks, and Charlie and they had laid out delicate plans for all of it. While the search would mostly be on Draco, himself, he had made the plans with the others to get different perspectives. He'd be stuck traveling simply, even though he was 17 already, but he had his plans laid out. When Harry and his friends left for their search, he would leave as well.
"Boy, Girl, everyone." Her unmistakable high voice grated on Asteria, but she didn't move, and nearly cried in desperation as Fred, the worst on the Twins took a seat next to her, and flashed his trademark grin that screamed trouble. She let her head fall onto the table with a thud on the desk.
"If you use the attic, giving you a more direct opening, your signal should go further. If and only if, you use a larger magic connecter, something Goblin-made, or," Draco paused, waving his wand and summoning something from his things at his sisters, handing it over. The box was black velvet, and Draco's long fingers pried it open, revealing a shining silver dagger, with a snake handle.
"Don't know what you are talking about, boy," Dolohov replied.
Asteria took a deep breath, and went to the door, softly opening it, and leaving the room, going towards the stairs. She wiped her eyes, ran her hand through her hair, and took some steadying breaths, as to not alert anyone to her emotional state, she plastered on her best fake smile and walked down the stairs prepared, already by the noise coming from the kitchen. She could do anything with a little acting.
"He's stubborn enough to survive as it is, as they all are."
"And how's your brother?"
"Have you seen Draco?" They immediately asked Asteria, and her eyebrow rose.
"You mean Stan Stunpike?" Draco supplied and Ernie nodded and glanced around the empty bus.
Pulling the charmed parchment from his pocket, and realized the house hadn't moved from when he'd last been there. Casting his sister's Disillusionment charm over himself, he stepped forward, and inched out of the woods, startled to see the house. He tossed a revealment charm at it and was equally surprised to find that the wards and charms hadn't been breached or tampered with since they'd left last summer. Draco quickened his pace and pushed the front door open, not startled by the formed dust and complete proof that his sister's home had been untouched, which meant she hadn't broken or meant she was already dead. The charms had been created by Charlie Weasley. He let out an aggressive sigh, and inched inside, silently shutting the door behind him.
-Lunch-
"Ms. Malfoy is correct, sadly," Snape said, and he just looked defeated, as did Karkaroff.
"But.." Hagrid studdered out.
"Not for this, maybe not at all." He began, and couldn't seem to stop himself, "I don't really know if you need me, Harry. You aren't exactly open about this, and I'm not good with showing my emotions as it is.
"Now everyone pair up and simply practice the spell. Asteria and I will make rounds and hand out pointers." He finished, and everyone bustled and began practicing. The young kids struggled, and Longbottom.
"Was I asleep long?" She asked, cracking a half-hearted smile. And Draco couldn't help himself, he laughed. He doubled over by the bed and laughed, which caused Charlie to laugh, and Asteria to smile harder.
The Quidditch World Cup was held in a large field, and Asteria was beyond annoyed already, and they had just gotten there. She currently stood back from her family as her father chatted animatedly with the Minister. She glanced around her, and saw her brother, sneering unattractively at the group next to them. Asteria finally letting her bored eyes focus, noted the red hair and freckles on the majority of the group, Weasley's. Looking among them, she saw a young witch with frazzled hair, and a thin boy with a messy mop of black hair, and the significant lightening scar on his forehead. So this was Potter. She wasn't paying much attention to the conversation, until she heard her father's condescending tone, mocking Mr. Weasley. She could see the anger bubbling in the group, so she let out a sigh, placing an unemotional look on her face.
"You wonder why everyone hates you at Hogwarts, that is why!" She finally said, her voice angry, as her brother looked on.
"What's that suppose to mean?" The young witch asked.
"Good"
"What is it, Potter?" She whispered, pulling her book from her bag. He glanced up and sighed.
The ceremony went without issue, the after-party was a different conundrum. Harry got roped into a conversation that Draco couldn't hear, but he could see his boyfriend getting irritated. Draco watched as Harry's hands would clench and unclench, his body had tensed up, and he kept looking at an old plump witch that Draco had asked Fred for the name. Muriel. Draco knew Harry was tense, already. Thanks to the visit from the Minister, who had given the trio things from Dumbledore's will, things that would help them in their search from Horcruxes. But Draco had to resist drawing too much attention to himself, even members of the Order had been able to place him, under his disguise, because of the particular air of malice and aristocrat way he held himself. He mentally chided himself on his own upbringing, and finally had enough. Delicately maneuvering around the crowds, he placed a gentle hand on Harry's shoulder and felt him sag under the weight. Harry excused himself and was dragged by Draco away from the table.
Something was different, she couldn't really tell what it was. But something in her surroundings had changed. She didn't feel cold, she felt warm. She could hear the soft snores coming from beside her. The only issue was, she couldn't open her eyes, she couldn't move. It was like she was imprisoned. She felt aware, but sleepy at the same time. She just wanted to drift back off, maybe this is what Death is like. Maybe it was her time to go. Like Alice. Like Sirius.
Snape, Bellatrix, Greyback, and Alecto Carrow had been in the Astronomy tower with Dumbledore and Harry, so they hadn't done it. Gibbin was dead, and Amycus Carrow wasn't smart enough. But Yaxley and Selwyn were capable, as were his previous friends, who would've kidnapped her just to earn Voldemort's favor. But where would one of them hide her? Malfoy Manor wasn't an option, no matter her faults, his mother wouldn't allow it. Despite most belief's Crabbe and Goyle weren't as stupid as everyone thought, but if his old friends had done it, it would've been Zabini who had done it. But something about the entire situation was still bugging him. Asteria was a trained duelist, an expert battle strategist, and wouldn't have let her guard down for anything, especially during battle. So either she had let herself be taken, which was highly unlikely, or she hadn't viewed whoever it had been as an enemy. Who could've been involved, but not seen by the Order, and not viewed as a threat by Asteria, who viewed everyone as a threat, unless she knew them?
"I just wish I could get him away from this, I don't want him to have to be a part of this fight, it isn't his responsibility." She whispered.
"Don't know yet. But probably, I don't really have any other plans."
"You know you aren't half bad, Malfoy," George added as his laughter died down, clapping the thin Slytherin on the back, before leaning against the counter.
"But it's putting their lives at risk!" Harry whisper-yelled.
"What about you?" Harry whispered, not taking off yet.
"That was definitely different." The soft voice snapped her head up and see focused, and saw Potter appear. He leaned against a shelf in front of her and looked at the ceiling.
"We will apperate directly into Hogs Head, there is a secret entrance to the school there" Bill supplied, and they quickly vanished, reappearing in the dusty bar, coming into contact with a white-haired wizard, who just pointed at the hole in the wall, Asteria was quick to push her way in, and follow the path, before appearing in the room of requirement, surrounded by students.
(September 1st-)
"There are men in clocks out there?" Draco whispered, darting away from the tent flap, Asteria stood, and glanced outside, noting the black clocks and skeletal masks and felt a deep surge of anger, and she walked back, tossing an arm over Draco's shoulders.
"And I don't need you?" The question caused a burning feeling to begin in Draco's chest.
"Define okay?" Asteria asked with a sigh, "McGonagall is on her way to St. Mungo's, Umbridge is looking for me, because threatening her and giving Hagrid a chance to run has infuriated her. But I can't leave school yet." She finished, leaning her head back.
"Stan was, it was his duty. He was skilled in many forms of information gathering, and knew her best."
Even once they came to you. You can't whimper, you can't cry. You refuse to move. No matter the pain they inflicted, you can never cry out, beg for mercy.
"I..-uh.Thanks?" Potter stumbled, before sitting next to her, followed by Weasley and Granger. Asteria didn't speak as she began her essay, the elegant scrawl crossing the page as they worked in silence. A soft huff did draw up Asteria's head and she glanced at Potter and Weasley as the struggled with a potions essay.
This was going to be a very bad year indeed.
"Marry you off?" He seemed shocked, "Mother won't allow that."
"Draco Lucius Malfoy, don't act as you know better then I do, when I'm the one that has taken a beating after beating to protect you, what I have suffered so you could remain so naive." She responded, and stopped taking a breath.
October 30th, the night before Halloween, at the feast, the other schools arrived along with a bustle of Ministry employees. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students had arrived and Asteria was late to the feast. Missing the main speech by Dumbledore as well as the entrances by the other schools. Having lost track of time in the library, due to homework, she slipped in silently and took a seat at the edge of her table. No one but Snape seemed to notice her entrance, and yet he did nothing. There were murmurings at the sight of the Goblet, and the blue flame that was sparking from the top. She gathered all she needed thanks to the gossip around the table, as students chomped down on the food. The champions had tonight, and tomorrow to put their names into the Goblet, and then the champions would be selected at the feast tomorrow night. It all sounded simple enough, she had to wait until tomorrow, as it was her birthday, but that was fine. She had gotten a letter from her father that morning, reminding her what would happen if she didn't put her name in it. At least he was aware that the likely hood of her being chosen was slim.
A week later, and Asteria was still hiding in the Gryffindor common room, with Granger and Ginny sneaking her food and information. Aurors were out looking for her, assuming she had left Hogwarts since they hadn't found her on the grounds. Umbridge was furious, losing a student was one thing, losing a student who threatened her was even worse. But Asteria didn't know what else to do, but once curfew hit, she'd slip out and return to the library, resuming her search for information and the spell-development. It wasn't easy creating a charm to access different languages, especially one as old and selective as Parseltongue. She couldn't just hide out and do nothing, so instead she snuck around a dark, empty school library, trying not to alert Mrs. Norris or anyone to her presence. But she thought she'd finally done when it came to the spell. She gathered her notes and using the shadows to slip to fourth floors bathroom. Upon entering she searched the sinks, finding the right one, with a snake carved into the metal. Pausing she flicked her wand and prayed to Merlin it worked. A hissing sound came from her wand, and the sinks began to move, moving outward, until the one in front of her sank into the ground, revealing a hole.
"I'm not sure, could that be important?"
Potter and his friends had stumbled inside and took a seat near the restricted section, but after a polite nod from Potter, he'd focused on his own studying. Granger had come by and borrowed a book from her stack with a smile. And Asteria wanted to lay down in a ball, she wanted to give up, but she wasn't allowed to show weakness. She was so tired, her body ached, her sleeping schedule was completely off, from her staying up late to keep her grades up as high as possible, she'd even been given a lecture from McGonagall about getting rest, and requesting an extension on the homework, but Asteria had blown off the Gryffindor head, with a thank you.
History of Magic - Binns 2 pm
Asteria stood in the parlor of her dusty home, anger coursing through her veins as she looked at the home that she had been forced to abandon when being kidnapped. She could hear Charlie upstairs, as he searched the house, but she knew no one had been here but Draco. She leaned against a frame, she'd spent so much time picking this home, getting it cleaned, and protected for Draco and Harry, and now it felt so empty and not worth it. She'd have to buy a new house, somewhere that didn't feel so desolate. She inches forward, new wand in hand as she Senegal moving upstairs. Her room was dark, only the moonlight giving her guidance, the hood hiding her face obscured her view slightly, but didn't dull the sharpened instincts that wouldn't let someone take her by surprise ever again.
"No?"
"Potter, what Umbridge say?" She asked as he sat down, and he let out a breath.
"Well, Draco and I will escort Potter to his muggle home, where Potter will porkey to your home, Molly, and Draco and I will side-along apparate. Then from the Burrow, we will floo to my home, where I will close the floo network." Asteria explained, "Now, no one will truly no the address because the house is practically unplottable. It moves, each day it is at a different location, which makes it the safest place for all three of us."
"I'm going to start helping Draco, taking out Snatchers and Death Eaters before the final battle happens."
"Asteria, I am so proud of you." She whispered, shocking her daughter. "I want you to know that. When the time is right, I will terminate my parental rights, to your brother, so you can take him and keep him safe. But I can't leave him, he won't let me take Draco, you know that." She added, pressing her lips to the top of Asteria's head. "But I am so incredibly proud of the woman you have become." She finished and trailed after her husband.
"All these people dead, life's over. Because Voldemort believed I'd be his undoing because he made it so." Harry continued and finally looked at her. She saw it in his eyes, he knew. "You know, don't you? What I have to do?"
"Because if he is anything like you, Sia, then he can't be that bad," Potter said, before straightening. "I've got detention with Umbridge so I have to go, I just wanted to check on you."
"Draco.." She whispered, and he didn't waste an instant, as he wrapped her into his arms, burying his head in her shoulder.
"Sia!" Neville shouted from where he stood near the entrance, still clutching the sorting hat, she looked up from where she was stroking Charlie's hair, sitting on a bench. The wild and fearful look in his eyes, made her body freeze, they were returning, she stood as she walked straight to him and looked out.
The biggest Quidditch match of the year and Asteria was currently sporting a busted lip, and a black eye, with Madam Pomphrey bustling over her injuries. She probably shouldn't have jumped into a middle of a fight between Potter, George, Draco, Goyle, and Crabbe that had broken out moments after Potter had won the match. She knew Draco had to keep up appearances, and she also knew he had pushed the very thin line the two boys had drawn. Her eye had swollen shut, and her shoulder hurt like it had taken Blogger straight to it, even though her injuries were mostly from Crabbe and Goyle, it didn't make her feel any better. She had watched Umbridge drag Potter and George away, while Draco had been carted off to the Hospital wing with her, he still laid unconscious in the bed next to her, his face healed, but still bloody. She let out a sigh, and winced as the healer cast a spell on her eye, the swelling immediately going down, and she could see again.
"Wait, you're Malfoy's sister from the Cup." One of the red heads answered, and Asteria looked at them, that's right.
"Yes, Draco." She replied and chuckled. "It was a simple spell, mostly used for parting sand and mountains. I've only ever tested in on small bodies of water, like ponds. But I figured it would work, as long as I moved fast." She explained as they reached the castle.
"Has that damned Headmaster lost his mind?!?" Asteria finally snapped, staring at the letter in her hands. She had repeated this statement 10 times since opening her school letter. After celebrating Ron and Granger's rise to Prefect, she opened her letter to learn, she'd risen to Head Girl.
"From what I could tell, yes." Draco supplied, and let George lead him to a chair near the couch.
"Well, I'm afraid, I have to make some amendments to include a fourth champion," Crouch said, and quickly left, followed by the others from the other school. And Moody came inside.
"He is going to make matters worse for Harry." Sirius supplied, and Asteria rubbed her face with her hand and leaned against the door frame.
"Don't apologize, Harry. We have plenty of space. And after everyone is healed up, we have other safe houses we can send them to." Bill replied, and let them inside.
"Anything else?"
"You should glee as well," Remus responded, and Draco sighed, he knew that.
"A week." Charlie supplied, "After Draco stunned you, we got you up here, and Pomphrey restrained you, and we hit you with Rennervate, but you didn't wake up."
"You've allowed these mudblood and blood traitors to learn our training?" Lucius growled out but shut his rampage as someone nudged him. "Never mind all that. Potter, hand me the prophecy, and I'll let you all go."
"Cleared of all charges!" Asteria shouted softly, and Sirius, Remus, Tonks, and the Weasley twins clapped and cheered softly. Potter laughed and was engulfed into a hug by Molly as Sirius pulled her away from the celebration.
"Asteria, please, stop shouting." Molly answered exasperated. The doting mother didn't fully understand why Asteria didn't want to be Head Girl, Potter did, as did Sirius. It pulled her into the light, and put her in an authoritative position. She had never wanted to be Head Girl, or Prefect or anything like that. She wanted to keep her head down, and get through her last year, with gathering as much information on defensive magic, and the HOW Voldemort was back. She knew that some privileges that came with her position was she could get into the restricted section. But it pulled her into the light, which wasn't good.
"At my old school, it was a game we played, always separated by years. There were two sides, you get picked for one, and you have a mock battle. We used a spell that shot paint at your opponents, each color stood for a different spell." She explained, "America is rich with battle history, they have fought in many wars, and it was just something the school did. After my first year there, I was given the moniker of the strategist, because I never lost." She smiled and shrugged her shoulders.
"I'm sure Dumbledore had his reasons, Sia." Granger supplied, and the older witch shot the younger girl a glare, softening after a second.
Readers,
"I concur, but I can't leave her to suffer or not know what happened to her," Draco added, closing his eyes. "The others have returned, I can hear them."
"You may go." Harry offered, as both young men protected her from the world.
"Ready, Potter?"
"What happened?" Draco asked, and she smiled.
"Together, we take it together. It's still a win for Hogwarts, and we can split the winnings." Potter offer and Asteria recognized the offer, he wanted it to be fair and she sighed.
"You, I know you." His voice was low and dark.
"Oh my darling daughter, I hope so." She whispered and walked towards Asteria. Long, elegant fingers reached out and brushed Asteria's cheek. "I need you to make a promise, that you always follow your heart." Her mother finished, before exiting the room and disappearing down the hall.
"It's true?" He whispered against her neck.
"Don't know, I've been avoiding her class. She's left me be since everything happened, and I'm sure she is skeptical on how I turn in my homework without her ever actually seeing me," Asteria smiled, and looked into his blue eyes as they searched hers for any possible lie. She didn't take offense to the look, he was worried about her, and she knew it.
"Could be."
"I need to buy a new house," Asteria added, with a chuckle. "And of course, Harry, Draco you are welcome to live with me while you attend your final school year."
"Damn it, why did you have to do this? Why didn't you have to see me?" She begged.
"Don't focus on my being here, I'll be gone once Fred deems I've eaten enough," Draco responded as Lupin sat down next to him and Fred pushed another sandwich towards him.
"Who took my sister?"
"You invited a Slytherin?" He demanded, looking at Granger who grew flustered.
She'd ensure Harry Potter's survival, as well as her brother's, even if she died doing it.
He was even reminded of her time at Hogwarts. After finding out about Alice, and breaking down, she had been laid up in the hospital wing for so long, and he would fall asleep every night by her bedside with Harry. When she got hurt, fighting for Harry or the Order, he'd done the same thing. He was always just laying by her bedside, because he was too cowardly to put himself directly in the line of fire like she did, or like Harry did. And each time he was stuck looking at her prone in a bed, he felt rage and desperation. And came to another realization at that moment, she would feel the same things as he did if their roles were reversed. And she would stay by his side until he was better, and that was exactly what he was going to do. He would be there until she was okay. Until she was safe. Until she was happy. Until she was free of this war and these dangerous times.
She didn't hesitate when she walked down the dark tunnel, not even turning on a source of light as she moved, pointing her wand again at the second door and entered the Chamber of Secrets, she dropped down and didn't pause near the snake, or the statue, going right, she went to the hidden room and entered, forsaking the final resting place.
"Well, what's this plan of yours?" Asteria said, changing the subject, which got both Draco and Potter back on the right track.
"How was your first class?" Snape requested coming out of the shadows and Asteria sighed.
"Oh, Sia!" Mrs. Jones seemed to collapse into Asteria's arms, tears running down her face, and Asteria couldn't breathe as she held the older woman up.
Her snobby little brother was asleep in a chair, his head tilted back, mouth open, his legs stretched out, and propped up on Potter's lap, who was also asleep, his elbow on the chair rail, holding his head up. And Charlie was sitting as well, arms crossed over his chest, head tilted back, and legs stretched out, linked at the ankle. He was angled in a way that he would've been watching both her and her brother with Potter. It was probably the most interesting things she had ever seen, and a smile threatened to break out on her face, but the urge quickly disappeared as the pain flared up in her chest. Alice would never smile again, she would never see what Asteria saw, she wouldn't see the end of this, she wouldn't marry or have mini-Ali's running around, and the tears began to flow softly, and Asteria drew her knees to her chest, and wrapped her free arm around them, burying her face in her knees. The pain was persistent but manageable, and the flowing of her tears seemed to slightly ease it this time. She let out a soft sound and was startled as Charlie jerked away, and looked at her, his eyes widen, but they softened in less than a second.
"That isn't..."The wizard began, but Draco held up his hand.
"I always disliked Albus for his blatant favoritism towards Gryffindor, but I hate him even more now for his disregard towards Harry's fucking life and happiness, and safety." Draco finished, and let out a breath.
"Possibly, however, why on earth would a wizard-like Albus, leave everything on a 17-year-old boy, and expect him to fight continuously since his birth for this?" Draco answered. And Charlie cocked an eyebrow.
"I'll take care of Professor McGonagall. They are going to try and put you in Azkaban, so go." She whispered, and he nodded, vanishing into the Forbidden Forest.
"You are the Weasley twins, my brother's mentioned you." She responded with a smirk. And the twins hesitated, tensing up.
"Bone of the father, unknowingly given; flesh of the servant, willingly given; blood from the enemy, forcibly taken." Dumbledore supplied, leaning back in his chair, "The venom from his snake was used in a potion to give him a temporary body."
"Shunpike." Draco finished, pulling the little pack of gallons over.
"Detention already?!?" She asked, barely shocked. "Blimey, Potter, starting this year off with a plan, eh?" She smiled and shoved him in front of her, and they exited the library, only to slip off separately once the library doors closed behind them. She walked to the Great Hall, slipping in unnoticed and sat down, grabbing a plate and filling, sitting down away from the others. She had patrols after dinner, and still had loads of homework to do and she was simply tired at this point. The altercation with Draco, her stressing out over Umbridge and spending in some time in the restricted section had exhausted her.  Focusing on trying to eat her fill, she almost didn't noticed the eyes watching her from various part of her table, but she wasn't so clueless not to feel the stares, glancing up she picked up on the various looks across the table, some were pure mean; stares from people who had labeled her a traitor; but a few, were envious of something, it wasn't her name, she didn't have that anymore, nor was it her wealth because it was unknown to most how much she actually had; maybe it was envy to her ability to actually think for herself, unlike so many others in her House.
"I'm sorry, sir." She whispered as she looked at the skeleton. She wasn't sure why she needed to come down here, she felt the school shake as it has begun. "I don't know why I'm here. But something told me to return." She leaned against a shelf and crossed her arms over her chest.
"Meddled?"
"Not spy, check up on. I know how much you didn't want to come back here." She smiled, gently, "And how could I possibly miss your birthday, after spending the last 5 years together for it." She smiled, summoning a small box, wrapped in delicate paper.
"Now we break into the Ministry of Magic, and rescue our family," Asteria responded looking at Potter as he opened his mouth to argue. "Shut it, Potter. I have a guess them at these three will argue no matter what you say, and Weasley, Granger and I won't let you go on your own."
"Thank you, my sweet, loving, little brother. For coming after me, for rescuing me, for bringing me somewhere safe, for always being by my bedside." She said, taking his hand in hers, and kissing the top of it.
"Accio!"He shouted for the portkey, and they vanished as more spells were shot at them, she felt one nick her calf. And they landed, grossly tangled together in front of the student body.
"Blimey, well that'll be interesting." She replied.
"Why?" Asteria felt the shattered emotion in her voice, and couldn't stop it.
"I'm fully aware, Weasley." She replied, not looking up as she began her essay for Arithmancy. Everything went back to the silence, only the sounds of turning pages, and scratching quills could be heard, and before she knew it, Madam Price was ushering them out, 30 minutes till curfew. She gave the trio a smile and nod, before taking off towards the dungeons. She had been able to finish most her essay's, just had one and a half to finish and would be the moment she hit the common rooms, thankful that it was deserted, and sat down, finishing the essay for Vector and Jones, before retiring into bed.
"Why Dolohov?" Lupin asked, and Draco leaned back in his chair.
Once at the large doors of the school, her facade nearly slipped, but she straightened her shoulders and took a delicate spot at the end of the Slytherin table. She didn't really want to deal with this, the tournament would start taking names just after she turned 17, all the transferring had affected her schooling. She didn't particularly want to participate, though a chance to win that much money that was purely hers and not connected to her family was almost worth it, even though she had, over the summer, removed her 'allowance' from the family vault, opening one of her own, taking the first steps to distance herself from the Malfoy name. She wasn't the Heir, Draco was.
"Don't pretend ignorance, Dray, you know what I'm talking about. Now let's get away from here, so no one makes any assumptions. If anyone ever asks, Mother. Father never left the tent." She whispered, dragging her brother out of the tent, and holding his hand as she broke out into a run. It only took them a moment to reach the line of the woods, and she had to skid to a stop to avoid plowing into a small group, she barely recognized the group, but her brother did. And his Malfoy exterior came out to play.
"When you served detention with me, what did I make you do?"
But when darkness fell, and she was left alone to her thoughts, Draco and Charlie sleeping peacefully on two transfigured couches, a distorted voice would replay her own prophecy and her mind would wander to the Slytherin's tomb under the school. She'd wonder what it would all mean, how it would play out in the final battle that she had accepted would happen at Hogwarts. Maybe someway she could use the chamber.
"Honestly, I'm tired of these damned spiders," Potter spoke letting out a breath.
"What room does Molly have you in?" His voice was soft as he asked Draco.
"Can't believe you just threatened and mocked the Ministry of Magic in one breath," Potter exclaimed, and she let out a breath, but tensed as the doors opened again, revealing her parents, and her reaction was violent, as she grabbed Potter's wand from the table, point it at her father.
"Incarcerous." She whispered with a flick of her wand and watched as the ropes tied up her father. She glanced back at the castle and her eyes widened as she watched Voldemort's body drop and Harry standing there, he was filthy, his hair even more out of control, blood had already started spotting his clothes, and his shoulders drooped. She picked up Lucius' wand, and shoved his and hers into the back pocket of her pants, and ran, slamming into Harry, wrapping him in her arms.
"Sia, can I speak with you for a moment?" His voice seemed so loud in the usually quiet room.
"Remus.." Molly pleases as she paused in her fussing over George.
"I can't believe this, he hurt Alice. He hurt Asteria. He..He.He's a monster." Draco finished sliding back down his seat with a breath. "Well, hell."
"I thought I would alert you all, to the coming preparations; for the upcoming Yule Ball, that is part of every Triwizard Tournament. Now, the ball will fall on Christmas night, and I expect every last one of you to behave yourself accordingly. Or the punishment will be severed." Snape's usual harsh and stern voice seemed even more so. And the slytherin group nodded, in response. And the Professor turned to her, "And as a champion, Ms. Malfoy, it is mandatory that you attend with a date." He finished, exiting the room, and she suddenly felt stressed, she hadn't made many friends at Hogwarts. Getting a date to the ball would be difficult until she caught glances of the massive amount of Slytherin's who seemed to eye her hungrily. And she groaned this wasn't going to be fun.
"Don't test my patience, Lucius. Take your pathetic friends and leave us be."
"Of course." He replied pointing his wand at her. This is was a demonstration, on the tide of battle.
"I might be, but I should probably finish school before I decide."
"I'm inclined to trust you, Ms. Malfoy." Dumbledore said as he slipped into the hospital wing, "You have shown a piece of every house here at Hogwarts, bravery worthy of Godric, loyalty honoring Helga, intelligence surpassing Rowena, and a certain cunningness envious of Salazar, I've never been more proud, especially since you have only spent two actual years at Hogwarts." He had supplied, "I had wanted to resort you, but Lucius was against that entire idea."
"Tell us, maybe we can help." Lupin offered, and Draco realizing that if anyone knew where Lily Potter was buried, it was probably Lupin.
"Shh, I know love," Draco whispered and continued rubbing his back until the crying slowed and Harry leaned back, his dirty face streaked with tear tracks.
"You pathetic, insolent bastard!" she yelled, fury raging inside her.
"Then we wait for a few minutes." Asteria spoke, crossing her arms over her chest.
"You can all put away your wands and pull out your textbooks, you'll be reading chapter one today. Please no speaking, boys and girls." The high voice snapped both their heads up and they glanced at each other, and Fred raised his hand.
"It started years ago, as a way to honor the founders, one of which was a descendant to Salazar Slytherin. She had never gotten the chance to go to Hogwarts and while fleeing her aunt, found the New World. Her aunt eventually found her, and a fight broke out, March 15th. So every year on that day, we play the game of war." Asteria explained, with a shrug and readjusted how she sat in the hospital bed.
Asteria stood gingerly at the tent flap, Potter had just captured the Golden egg, after using his broom, which even she had to admit was pretty intelligent. He was currently in the lead, with 40 points, and 39 points to Krum for smashing the dragon's actual eggs. She was to be next, once the bell sounded. She adjusted her cloak, grip tightening on her wand, once the gong sounded. She stepped out and eyed the dragon, who was currently distracted by the noise, with a quick swish of her wand, she cast a simple disillusionment charm over herself; and the crowd gasped as she vanished. She kept her wand in her hand as she silently crept over rocks and boulders, reaching the nest in record time, thought the dragon tail was wrapped around the nest, she got as close as she dared, and silently used a levitation charm, to literally bring the egg to her. Once in her hand, she retreated back towards the tent and undid her first charm; bringing a complete end to the first tasks, as everyone cheered. And she has rewarded a perfect score of 40, leaving her tied with Potter. She gave the crowd a soft bow and went inside her tent before the dragon took notice of her. She slipped inside and was greeted by Potter who was grinning.
"Ms. Malfoy, come in. How may I assist you today?" Malkin's said in her usual cheery voice.
"You've been gone for a while, Sia." Draco supplied, sitting on the chair beside her bed.
The first sign of real trouble that came was during the Holidays. While happily lounging at the Burrow, tragedy stuck when Bellatrix and a few others attacked the house, sending everyone on high alert, forcibly sending the children back to Hogwarts early. Leaving, Asteria and the others to delicately rebuild the home as well as laying powerful wards and protections down to protect it from happening again, but the sight of Molly Weasley, nearly heartbroken at the sight of her home burned to ashes was enough to almost break Asteria down.
"Come on, Harry. Let's go inside." Draco whispered, against Harry's head, where he softly nodded, and they both stood. Draco dropped an arm around Harry's thin waist and they walked up to the cabin, where Bill stood against the door.
Asteria yanked her head back above the water, shutting the egg as she brought it back up. Taking a deep breath, attempting to catch her breath. She pushed her wet hair back and leaned against the door, with a deep breath.
"Sorry, I'm late, Molly." She said, side-stepping the witch and going into the kitchen, "I believe I got everything. She reached into the bag and pulled out the robes, bring them to size, and passing them out to each person, keeping hers next to her. "Madam Malkin's wanted me to say hello, and hopes you are doing well. She missed you this year." Asteria supplied, reaching in and grabbing the stacks of books, and passing the appropriate stacks to everyone, placing her's on her box of robes, and followed suit with the ingredients, and paused, letting out a breath.
"Damn it, Harry, no," Draco responded in slight anger. "Don't do that, Granger is the only one of all three of you smart enough to outwit fully grown Death Eaters and Ronald," He said with mock disgust, "can probably babbler his way out of anything. You cannot go alone."
"Everything okay here?" She asked, looking at the guard who nodded.
Padfoot.
"Answer me, Harry."
"I'm looking for someone." He kept his voice low, as he drew old man Tom's attention.
"How on earth do you know all that?" Potter asked, and she gave him a gentle smile.
"What-" She paused, trying to breathe, "What do you mean, sir?"
"That's kind of heartless, Draco." Charlie supplied.
"It's the truth as it is. You need them."
"I don't want to hear it, Lucius." She began, her grey eyes connecting with his. "You beat me constantly throughout my childhood, you shipped me off to hide me from everyone, you forced me into a tournament I wanted nothing to do with, that also almost killed me. You worshipped the creature who did try to kill me, who, mind you, almost succeeded." She tried to stop, even when she felt Harry's calm presence on her arm, but she was on a role.
"But I won't allow it." He stuck out his chin in defiance.
"Then, we will get along just fine, O'Conner." She finished, dropping back against the cushion. The rest of the train ride was silent, and she barely noticed when he left to change, but she noticed enough to change her clothes, and prep for leaving the train. The jarring stop, made her stand up and step out and begin her job of ushering students in different directions. She gave a nod to the Twins as they flanked Potter, and she continued on. The ride to the castle itself was slow, but once there she ushered students in and took a seat at the front of the table and nearly choked on her own breath when she saw the plump witch from the Ministry sitting next to Snape, and her eyes immediately sought out Potter's and he looked concerned. Asteria glanced back and made eye contact with the woman, and instantly felt her insides freeze, she fully acknowledged how hard this year was going to be with this woman here. Not only had she insulted the plump witch, but she had outright mocked and insulted the Minister.
-Lunch- 12pm
"Maybe." Potter looked at her, "His grandfather's name was Marvolo, I don't know much else about his family, other then they are all dead." He explained.
"Why in Merlin's name did they choose the second task to be in the Black Lake, during FEBRUARY?" Asteria nearly yelled, as paces her common room. She adjusted her Slytherin scarf and shoved her hands back into her pockets. She glanced back up at Alice, who sat in on the black chair, her legs crossed.
Draco's coat covered the body in his arms, but she could clearly make out the look of anguish on his face as he walked right past her to the Weasley's and laid the body down at Molly's feet. And suddenly Asteria knew, with perfect clarity that war had drenched the blood on the Weasley clan, and she looked at George, as she knew he knew, the tears were flowing freely, his hand on his chest as it clenched and unclenched, before he dropped to the ground when Draco moved, who then put a hand on Ron's shoulder. George started sobbing, as he pulled back the coat, revealing the face of Fred Weasley, the ghost of a smile still on his face.
"I am fully aware of that, Potter." Asteria replied, "However, she is a muggle-born, and that's who those freaks are after."
"Why, hello to you too, Draco." She responded, smiling at her younger brother.
"Bloody hell, you had me scrubbing under the desks in your classroom," Draco replied, before shoving Remus out of his face, and going to Harry helping him back to his feet.
Umbridge seized the girl, pulling her round to face her, and shaking her very hard. A split second later, and Dumbledore was on his feet, his wand drawn; there was something about the very sight of the powerful headmaster, with his wan drawn that froze the room. He seemed furious, and Asteria prepared for a fight, ready to remove her influence from the witch.
Asteria stared after her mother long after she had been gone, confusing thoughts running through her head. Her mother was usually blunt and to the point, never vague and spaced out like just then. Asteria rolled her shoulders again and shut her door, finally feeling some semblance of peace, locked in her own room. Her walls were a deep purple, matched with black furniture. Since her transfer to America, the house she had been sorted into wasn't a big deal. When she was sorted at Hogwarts, back when she was eleven, she had been sorted into Slytherin, she wondered if she would stay with that house or be resorted. As her thoughts circled around the possibility of being resorted, she moved her trunks down to the floor, off her bed, deciding against unpacking, since she'd have to pack it all in a few days anyway. She kicked off her black shoes and rested her head against her headboard, letting her eyes flutter shut.
"I haven't noticed much, Ali. Maybe you should go exploring and find someone to entertain yourself while you are here." Asteria said with a wave of her hand . "You know I only attend school to focus on my actual education, unlike you." She smiled at the look of mock sadness on her friend.
"Asteria," He warned, his grip tightening on his cane, she tossed the wand back and grasped his coat.
Draco currently sat in a chair on the patio looking out at the beach, his head in his hands as the cool breeze touched his skin. When the sounds of distinct apperation sounded in the distance. Draco was on his feet in a second, wand drawn, body ready for a fight. He slowly stepped his way out towards where the sound came from along the beach and was shocked to see a dirty Luna Lovegood, Dean Thomas, and Mr. Ollivander. Draco faltered in his step as Lovegood looked towards him.
"Welcome to the Knightbus," O'Connor said in a deadpan voice, and it drew Draco's attention. Something was off about the boy, who seemed to be staring out the window, not seeing anything.
"I need help, to protect our school, our people, the children. I've forsaken my family name, I've gone against everything my family wanted, generations of Malfoy's and Black's." She sighed heavily, staring into the sockets of a skeleton. "Please, Salazar Slytherin, you must stop your Heir, before he destroys the entire world." She muttered as the castle shook again, this time she felt the distinction as the wards fell. She had to get back, she had to return to the battle.
"Alice, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry." Asteria cried out, wishing her friend could hear her, could forgive her. As she babbled apologizes to the skies, she couldn't make it stop, she felt every ounce of pain that her body could, and it was tearing her apart, and she couldn't stop saying she was sorry. "Oh Gods, Ali, I'm so sorry, please, you can't leave." She whispered as the pain became unbearable again, and she screamed out her best friend's name out to the sky. When long arms encircled her, burying their head into her neck. She couldn't make the pain stop.
"Don't be so charming, Ali. Your very presence has begun to annoy me." Asteria smiled at her obnoxious friend.
Asteria couldn't forget about the people she still had, the experiences she had gained in her still sort life, but sometimes it was still hard to imagine that she was smack dab in the middle of a brewing war, and she still couldn't see the ending. She had pushed off talking to Potter about the Chamber, already having a hard time after learning about his connection with Voldemort. She didn't want to lay anything else on him, but she had gotten some information out of Fred and George, who thankfully was the only Weasley's who could keep their mouths shut. They had told her that the entrance was in the unused girl's bathroom on the fourth floor and only someone who spoke Parseltongue to actually get inside, but that was the only issue with her getting inside herself, simply because only Potter could get inside. Unless, as the Twins suggested, she created a spell to replicate the language herself. She had already begun that process, hoping to keep from dragging Potter into the plan itself until it gave her any useful information.
"No. Best to let them come here themselves." Draco supplied, taking his seat. "And I didn't want to give something to cause Harry to feel even worse about." Charlie nodded.
"But you are like brilliant at potions, and you remember everything." Alice supplied, looking at her.
"Because life is not fair, and as cruel and horrible as that sounds, it's the truth. We got dragged into a world that our elders had damaged." Draco responded, and paused. "Now we, better than they ever were, have to fix it." He finished, brushing dirty hair from Harry's face.
"Well, time for some battle plans, strategist," Alice said, gently clapping Asteria on the back.
"Thank you, Sir Salazar." She bowed deeply, as the ghost nodded, and charged Voldemort, Asteria reached into the sorting hat in Neville's hand, pulling out a long broadsword and charged the large snake, quickly swiping the head off, watching as the creature burst into dust, and Voldemort screamed as the ghost surrounded him and vanished as a spell flew and Voldemort screamed again as it hit his shield. She glanced up and watch Harry Potter throw himself out of Hagrid's arms and disappear and she felt a weight vanish from her shoulders as she threw herself into battle, dropping the sword in favor of her wand, flinging curses and spells in all directions. She felt revigorated and full of energy as she fought Death Eaters who didn't seem to be in the fight any longer, Voldemort had vanished, probably in search of Harry, who had somehow survived. She couldn't dwell on the thought long enough to think it over, and she froze as she faced her only opponent. He stood tall, but was dirty and looked tired. Dark circles were under familiar grey eyes, and his once perfectly straight pale hair was dirty and unwashed, and she stood poised, her wand hand trembling as he faced her, unarmed.
"It's..uh," Draco paused, "it's a safety bracelet, it'll protect you from being searched for. So if anyone tries to search for your magical signature or you, yourself, their spells will explode and protect you." Draco finished, not looking at Harry, but he felt fingers touch his cheek, pulling his face to face the other boy.
"Ms. Malfoy!"
"Oh, bloody hell."
"I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores," Dumbledore spoke, and for the first time since she walked into the office, he seemed angry, and that was even more powerful than anything she had ever seen.
"No, not really."
"Both her legs were broken in multiple spots, and she had a few cracked ribs, which was impairing her breathing. She had some slashes on her back, and I'm not sure what did them, but I was able to heal them, but the scar's remained." She supplied, a look of pain crossing her face before disappearing. "The bruising was around her ankles, wrist and a few others on the tops of her arms, probably where she had been grabbed and chained."
"Lucius was never meant to be a father, Draco. He doesn't hate you, he hates everything." Asteria responded, kneeling in front of Draco.
"What do you mean, Sia?" He asked, pulling her further away from the kitchen, into the front room.
"What? It's a bit obvious, honestly." She shrugged, "He, first, wasn't anywhere in the graveyard tonight, and the look on his face, makes it a bit clear, he'd only kill to protect Potter." She finished and earned a grin from Potter and Dumbledore.
--- (an hour and a half later)---
"My capabilities isn't what I'm concerned about, my classmates and fellow students. Some weren't raised or trained like I was." She replied, leaning back into her chair, stretching her legs. "Something has to be done."
"Let Fudge know he made a drastic mistake by interfering at Hogwarts." She finished with a growl and took the professor to the Hospital as fast as her feet would carry her. Once there, laying the professor down, she collapsed to the ground, her breathing ragged and fast. The adrenaline had washed from her body, and she realized how far she had gone, she had threatened Ministry officials, making her a target. She'd probably be arrested next. Madam Pomphrey worked diligently on McGonagall, before sending out a request for St, Mungos.
"Asteria." His voice was broken and tired.
"Mother! Father!" She called out, keeping her tone light, a tone she reserved for her family, it was a fake tone because she had to keep up appearances. She knew everyone was home. She had stayed longer in America, saying goodbye to her friends and making sure she didn't forget a single thing. Being that it was August 16th, and she started school back at Hogwarts on September 1st. She was shocked that she wasn't being greeted by her family. Her father's anger at her refusal to come straight home after term ended, her mother's complacent behavior and her brother's curiosity about school in America; Asteria knew what she signed on for when she ignored her father's summons to return directly home.
"The next 7 days of passwords." Draco supplied, and glanced down at Ron. "I'm quite disappointed that the Gryffindor has shown nothing but Slytherin cowardice." He spoke with annoyance and left the house, his body tired from standing there tense, but couldn't believe Ron had just abandoned them when things got a little tough. It was war, everything was tough. He couldn't believe the nerve of the Weasel. Draco apparated to the Twin's flat and slammed a fist into the brick wall, breaking the skin and shocking George.
"Secondly, I fucking love you. I think of barely anything but you," he paused as he walked up to Draco. "And when all of this over, I want to explore where we can go without the looming threat of war and death over us." He finished, taking Draco's face in his hands, pressing a soft kiss to his lips.
"If...If something happens to my baby girl, I don't blame you, Sia." She choked, "Ali made her choices, and I know you denounced your father. No choice he makes or made, effects the fact that you are like a daughter to me as well." She stuttered out, and Asteria couldn't breathe, she couldn't be here, she went to stand when a bird flew into the office window, dropping a letter in Dumbledore's hand. He quickly read it, and she could see it in his face. She could feel it in her very soul. There was no way Ali wouldn't have responded to her letter.
"Is that why you didn't come home?"
"Sorry, I didn't come with the Portkey. I had to speak to Dumbledore alone about somethings. But I was in the office with the others, I just arrived later." Asteria supplied, taking a seat next to Potter, draping her arm along the back of Potter's chair, crossing her legs as she leaned back, fully aware she looked like she didn't have a care in the worry, the precise role she was intended on playing in this situation. She knew her cousin would play the jokster, as he did in any high tense situation unless Potter was the one in danger. No one noticed as she took a sip of her Butterbeer Sirius handed her, or the look she shared with her cousin. The silence was dark in the old house, the only sound was of their breathing, and then a loud crack, nearly causing Potter to jump out of his skin as Molly bustled into the kitchen. Asteria stood, and reached across the table nudge George's arm, who jerked awake and shoved his twin, both boys immediately getting up to hug their mother after Ron and Ginny.
She felt Charlie stumble beside her, as he went down to his knees, the tears trailing down his face. She dropped to her knees and pulled him into her arms, letting his tears soak her chest, as her own dripped into his hair. She reached out her hand and gripped her brother's tightly. She could see his pain all over his face. She knew the Draco had spent a large amount of time with the Twin's while she had been kidnapped. She glanced around and finally saw Harry, who had his hands clenched at his side, looking around at the bodies laid out in the Hall, the death that he, no doubt, blamed himself for. She released Draco and Charlie and walked to the dark-haired wizard.
"Well, she definitely made some moves, hasn't she?" Asteria grumbled, "Now she cant stunt our learning as well as issue barbaric punishments."
"Yes. It saved my life against Voldemort during the Last Task. Sia?" He asked, looking at her and she nodded, stepping a few feet from him and pulled her wand out and pointed it at Potter.
Draco got to the wood line, and inched his way into the thick bush of trees, pulling his wands, lighting the end of it. He kept the wand angled downward so as not to trip over roots or branched, but the forest sent shivers up his spine, reminding him of the Forbidden Forest from Hogwarts. He stumbled around, wishing the moon was fuller, and silently cursing the dark, as he finally stumbled out into a small clearing, revealing a house. Draco cast a simple revealment charm and was shocked to find none. He inched his way up the walkway, the steps, and to the door, softly pushing it forward, revealing a dusty entryway. A feeling of failure touched Draco's heart, and he sighed but continued forward.
As dinner ended, and she followed the student body back to their common rooms, she caught a glimpse of Moody, as he stalks after the Headmaster of Durmstung. Part of her wanted to follow but knew better than risk getting caught out after curfew. She slipped up to her dorm, casting a soft glance at her brother, who seemed engrossed in a piece of parchment. A blush had crept up his pale neck, and he tossed the letter into the fire, and shoved his hand into his pockets, before heading towards his own dorm. She quirked an eyebrow as she watched. Was he seeing somebody? Or was he simply interested in someone? Asteria shook her head and finished slipping into her dorm, and fell face first into her bed, still in her uniform. She was exhausted, the feet upon feet of an essay's from her classes and the stress from the tournament. She grumbled into her pillow, this isn't what she wanted, at all. She had to plan her entry into the tournament and make sure she was seen entering, so it got back to her father that she tried. She buried her face deeper into her pillow, kicking off her shoes. And letting sleep take over her mind, and surrendered to the darkness.
"What's going on, Granger?" Asteria asked, her dark eyebrow raised.
"NO!" Her brother's voice was full of agony, and she could make out the flinch in her mother's features.
A distorted female voice whispered in the dark.
She looked at the bright hall of the Ministry, Draco stood to the side, Harry's arm around his waist as they waited for Narcissa, Asteria herself stayed off to the side, looking at the wizards, returning nods from Auror's and officials, who passed them. She caught, out of the corner of her eye, her mother stepping up to the two seventeen-year-olds and watched as Draco hugged the older witch, and Harry bow, offering a kiss to her hand, showing manner's she didn't think he actually had. She glanced up at watched the Auror's as they took all the sentenced Death Eater's out, Lucius at the front, who glanced back at her. His face held no malice or anger, just a dejected look, he leaned down and whispered something to the Auror guiding them, who stopped and glanced at her. She pushed herself off the wall, and walked forward, her arms crossed over her chest.
"Of course, he did. Everything is more important than his only daughter." Asteria finally responded and walked closer to the maze, away from her mother, as she checked her watch and adjusted her shirt, and heard Draco hoot for her, and smiled to herself. At least her brother was always on her side. She silently thanked his presence as the other champions stepped forward as well, Asteria didn't listen to the rules, after she heard she would be entering first.
"While my brother is rude, he isn't wrong."
"Listen, Potter, I'll look into it, okay?" She offered and patted his hand. "I'm good at digging up information." She didn't add that she was still sitting on serious information, but catching up to Dumbledore at this time, was incredibly difficult. She didn't want to burden Potter unnecessarily with information he wouldn't really understand, he wouldn't understand why someone would stoop so low into the some of the darkest arts in the magical world.
"I know he was."
"I heard something interesting from Dora, about a Death Eater found, cursed to imprisonment in his old body, with a name signed across his chest," Lupin asked bluntly and Draco sighed.
Draco never understood getting married in the middle of a war but chose to keep that opinion to himself as he packed up the few things he kept with him at the Burrow. Today was the day, the 31st of July. Harry was finally 17, and Bill Weasley and Fleur were getting married. The preparations were in place, and everyone was getting ready, including Draco, who had undergone some transfigurations, to appear less like himself. The magic didn't make him shorter, or plumper. He still had his same thin, tall frame, but sitting on top of his head was brown hair instead of his blonde. Resting atop his face weren't his usual grey eyes, but brown ones. His jaw wasn't as defined, as usual, and he had to shove his aristocratic mannerism down to avoid drawing too much attention, but Harry, on the other hand, had gone a different route, as was sporting a mop of messy red hair, freckles, and blue eyes, which was just off in Draco's opinion. He had long since accepted the act that he would forever be surrounded by the red-headed Weasley's, but he didn't want his boyfriend to be one of them, even if it was honestly, the sharp green eyes he missed the most.
"Oh, can she tell us about six months' worth of meetings?" Dumbledore asked, raising his eyebrows. "I was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight." Asteria suddenly felt the fierce stare of Albus Dumbledore, and glanced up, brushing Potter's hand gently. She retreated and stood behind Edgecombe.
"Yeah, still a prat. And your brother isn't much better." Potter supplied, and Asteria chuckled softly.
"Lucius did this?" Draco's voice seemed to break as he stood, and he spun on Potter. "You knew my father did this?"
"Kill the spare." She felt the darkness before it hit, and saw the flash of green as she dove, dodging the killing curse.
"Is it true that the Dark Lord tried to kill you?" He asked, and she sighed, pulling him deeper into the Restricted Section.
"I was sorted into Slytherin when I was 11, but I didn't stay here. I was transferred out, but my father, where I went to school in America, which doesn't have the same thing for house pride as Hogwarts does. Dumbledore had requested my resorting, but my father refused." Asteria explained, not for Smith, but for the others who didn't know her. "When I returned to Hogwarts, I was forced into participating in the Tournament, which I didn't want, I don't need fame or money, because, Smith you are right, I am a Malfoy. However, the night of the last task, I was nearly killed by Voldemort, then I watched my father grovel like a coward at his feet, and I disinherited myself from the Malfoy name." She explained and paused, taking a breath, "And in retaliation to my dishonoring everything about the Malfoy legacy, my father beat my best friend to death 2 an a half weeks ago.
— the next morning;
"Harry, Granger, and Ronald are here. They came with some survivors from Malfoy Manor." Draco said with disgust. "I don't know the details, but someone died, and Harry is taking it hard. He's in the restroom now."
"All he ever tried to do was help and now he's gone." Harry cried against Draco's skin. Draco glanced from the direction from where Harry had come and could see the prone body of his old house elf. Draco had always liked Dobby and he sighed squeezing Harry as he quietly sobbed. There was nothing Draco could offer or do, except hold his boyfriend tightly, rubbing his back.
"Run, please." He cried out, and another spell came flying for her, but she dodged again, rolling into the forest behind her. And taking cover behind a tree.
"Go, get Dumbledore. Something is wrong." Asteria mumbled, leaning up and kissing his cheek, and she slipped forward out of his reach, following after Potter. Keeping to the shadows, she reached the door and leaned against it, and suddenly, she jumped back, hearing the rushing footsteps, she pointed her wand at the door.
"The slashes on her back, could they have been from dark magic?" Draco asked.
"We all took off, and it happened suddenly, they were there. The Death Eaters. And it went crazy." Harry answered, running a hand over his face, "I saw Moody take a spell and fall, and then Voldemort was there and he was flying, without a broom, and Hedwig got out of her cage and protected me, and then my wand did something crazy and acted on its own, and hell, Draco, it's just been too much." And Draco didn't respond, just pulled Harry into his body, holding him close.
"Is that Asteria?" The younger witch asked, and Draco nodded, and looked to his right, seeing the reef of lilies at Harry's mother's grave.
Stepping her way up to the opening door, she saw the ledge clearly, and climbed down the latter, hoping that there was an actual ground once she hit it. Finding sturdy concrete, she sighed, her heart skipping as the ground moved and statues appeared and a dim light lit up the room. Turning slowly she was faced with the near skeleton of a large snake. She inched her way closer and picked up on the fact that the parts of the body that was still in the water, wasn't as skeletal, the fangs in the mouth were nearly as large as her forearm, and it sent shivers up her spine, but she also felt a surge of pride in the fact that a 12-year-old Potter defeated this creature with a sword. She inched around the creature and looked at the statue, noting the resemblance of whom she believe to be Salazar Slytherin.
"Thanks, Potter." Draco grumbled, "Under Lucius' orders, I have been forced to join the Inquisitor Squad, which is a group of students who are under Umbridge's rule and are loyal to her." Draco finished a look of shame on his face.
"So this is where people come to die." Ruby red hair, green eyes, freckles and clearly American. Asteria's eyes widened at the sight of her best friend.
Asteria stood in the shadows, covered in her disillusionment charm, hiding her from sight as she knelt in the currently empty Wizengamot courtroom, the barbaric treatment of Potter and Dumbledore had pushed her past her limits, she didn't care that the prophet had dragged her name precariously through the dirt, but Potter's? It was irritating her, and against the wishes of her cousins, Sirius and Tonks, as well as Molly and Moody, she was here, to witness Potter's trial. Her cousins worried, that if caught she'd be punished severely, while Molly and Moody, worried she make trouble for Potter. Even if her intentions weren't to do so. Potter claimed to feel better if she was there, so that's what counted to her. The young wizard seemed to be lost and angry, but she understood.
She leaned forward, her head in her hands as she took a delicate deep breath. She had already changed into her robes, going for the black pants instead of the skirt which the females of Hogwarts usually wore, her white button-up tucked into her black pants, and her green and silver tie was loose on her neck, and her black robe, that held the Slytherin crest was folded on the seat beside her. She wanted to go back in time, and never returned home. But the punishment would've been worse if she had made her father hunt her down. She was more than fed up with her father. Considering she was sporting a really mean couple of bruises on her back from his cane when she had thrown a book at him.
"Game of war?"
"Have you seen Harry?" Draco's voice sounded behind her and she felt her body tense up, as she looked back at her brother, and she shook her head. How could tell her brother that the love of his life was sacrificing himself to save them all?
"Thank Merlin for that girl, she may save him before we could ever get there," Sirius whispered and heard Remus mumble in agreement. Asteria squared her shoulders, and joined the celebration, her fake smile on her face, as her mind mulled over battle plans for the future she didn't have any clue for.
"Are you alright?" Draco asked, forcing Harry to look at him.
"She's a Slytherin and a Malfoy! They are all death eaters!" He argued, and she placed a hand on each of the Twins, standing.
"Stop it, Harry." She whispered as she stood at his side, he flinched slightly at her voice but didn't turn to face him.
"Sia if you actually believe you blend in anywhere with your looks, you are lying to yourself." Fred responded with a shake of his head, "but if she starts trying to single you out, I've got your back." And he smiled, forcing her to smile back. Because that was just the Weasley way.
Harry took the package, holding it gently, it wasn't large, but Harry handled it as it weighed more than anything, as his calloused hands delicately unwrapped it, and opening the box. Draco felt his heart slamming against his chest, his breath stuck in his throat.
"Draco?" Harry whispered as their eyes connected.
"Don't presume to be smarter than your own good, Asteria." Her father said, but she could see it, in his face. He knew she was suspicious.
"We'll show you were Dumbledore his the weapon, just don't hurt him." Granger pleaded, and Umbridge seemed to fall for it, ushering the two out of the door with her wand. She felt a hand slip something in her pocket, and Draco squeezed her shoulder, and Ginny was fast, flinging a hex at Goyle and spells started flying, and Asteria stunned her brother, resting him gently on the ground. She checked her pocket and found Potter and Granger's wands, and patted her unconscious brother's shoulder.
"How long?" She asked, and he sighed.
"You can try and lie to me, and I can try and weed out what is true or not," Draco began raising his wand and pointing it at his head, "or I could just do this, Legimens." Casting the spell, Draco was thrown into his mind and found he wasn't prepared for the onslaught of memories. His sister had prepared him for how consuming the spell could be, but he had only tried it on her, who could restrict the number of things he'd see. Dolohov's thoughts were tinged with darkness from his time in Azkaban, and Draco could feel the chill from the monsters. Forcing his own spine to straighten, he began pilfering the memories, finding one from a muggle cafe, of Granger, Weasley, and Potter, though it was blurry, almost unclear like it had been obligated, and someone had returned them. He learned the Voldemort's name was literally taboo, if a person said it, they could be found. He learned his father was out and looking like a shell of a man, and his mother was still alive. He found that Stunpike was dead, thanks to a stunning spell that hit him from one of the Order during the airborne fight that took place in July. He found something else, what he really needed, Rowle had taken over the information gathering from his sister, and Dolohov was supposed to remain guard.
"Crap." She muttered, slamming the book shut, and looking up. This was bad.
"Yes, well." Fudge spoke up, giving Umbridge a particular look, "Potter still broke the decree by holding a meeting tonight. He must be punished."
"Yes, I know." She responded, looking at him. "I've known since I discovered how he was able to do it."
Advance Defense - Moody 11 am
"I don't know what is wrong with you children, spreading a horrible lie like that. You-Know-Who is dead, and it isn't appropriate for you to start spreading rumors like that." The minister said, and Asteria nearly snapped, if it wasn't for the fact that she left her wand behind, and Potter's calming hand on her wrist, she would've beaten the Minister.
The first few months of the boys being back at Hogwarts was easy, as Asteria took up a post in Hogsmeade, acting as a bodyguard at Albus' discretion. She would be close by if she was needed by Potter or Draco, and that was easy, she kept to herself. But when she was at home, things grew difficult, she couldn't rely on the soft bustle of her brother or Potter to drown out the worry, so she'd spend time with Tonks, or even Molly, as Charlie was in Romania. She grew a deep respect for her Hufflepuff cousin, who was bright and lighthearted, and their conversations were simple and easy at distracting her. But she missed Sirius, and Alice, and even Charlie, whom she refused to let herself dwell on, not wanting to get lost in thoughts of the Weasley she was sure she was in love with, but love in the middle of a war was dangerous, which caused her to worry about her brother and about Potter, because if things changed, it would blow up in all of their faces.
"Well, we have a plan for the last one." Potter announced, "Well it was Malfoy's plan, and Hermione's."
Advance Charms - Flitwick 10 am
"What kind of snake?" Asteria paused.
"She'll be okay too. She's stronger than all of us combined." Ginny finished, uncrossing her arms, and shoving her hands into her front pockets. Draco couldn't help but notice how much she had grown since he had first seen her in that book store, but he banished the thoughts, knowing better than to dwell on the things that had harmed her.
Her day followed in the same manner, stress following her about Umbridge throughout her day, even McGonagall asked her how the class went, and unable to lie to the older witch she told her and nearly flinched at the anger that played on her features. She had then followed up with a request to alert her to anything seemed suspicious, or appalling.  Asteria had nodded, and focused on her tasks, slipping into the Restricted section in the library, during her free period, she pulled out a long stretch of parchment, her magic quill, and began searching for all kinds of defensive, offensive and protective magic for the coming battle. She hadn't noticed that she was being watched until she felt the presence behind her, turning quickly and on alert, she faced Draco.
"Did you mention?" Charlie didn't finish just looked at Asteria.
"That's not all that's on your mind though, is it?" There it was, the reason he avoided Ginny, she was observant and intelligent beyond her years, and Draco could only cock his head at her.
"Yes, Malfoy, sit." Fred gestured and went to the fridge, pulling out some already made sandwiches. "Don't worry, mum made them, so eat. Tea or Butterbeer?"
"Merlin, no. To hell with your pathetic Dark Lord." Draco laughed, before cutting the sound off abruptly. "I'm looking for my sister, who's been missing since June, during the fight at Hogwarts." Yaxley kept his mouth shut, looking at him with rage. "You can try and keep quiet, but I have ways of making you speak, and you can't tell me a lie." He finished, motioning to the potion equipment behind him.
"I want you to know, how thankful I am for you, and how much I appreciate you. I had cut myself off from the Black family so long ago, I forgot that not everyone is bad. You've done so much, even forsaking your Malfoy heritage." He stated, and she turned to face him. "When I heard about Alice, I was worried. After James and Lily died, I struggled to feel things, not just because of the dementors, but because I had lost my best friends. I felt worried for Harry, I always worry about Harry, but how could I not, right?" He asked, before continuing, "But I worry about you as well. I know your life hasn't been as glamorous as everyone would assume. And I know you play off your loyalty as vengeance, because it's easier to hide behind that, then to admit you actually care about people.
"Ah, yes. Ms. Black, I must say, I appreciate you stepping in when you did." Dumbledore said, as he casually helped McGonagall to her feet. She dusted off her robes and shook her head at the headmaster.
"Are you ready, love?" Harry's voice broke through his thoughts and Draco sighed, looking at Harry. Or Barry, as was his name for the night.
Asteria let out a breath of relief. She hadn't been sure her mother would follow through, but she had. She was now in charge of her brothers future, and she swore she'd give him the best chance possible. A light pain bloomed in her chest, while she'd won the battle for her brother, she'd lost the one to save her cousin. She reached out her hand and touched Charlie's head, needing him to wake up. He jerked up and looked at her, and a breath of relief left his lips.
"Are you sure you are okay?" He asked again, and she sighed.
"True enough. I can see what Harry sees in you." He finished with a knowing look, and Draco blushed softly.
Their relationship had come from nowhere. A friendship bloomed from the mutual worry from Asteria's loss. Than late nights sneaking around after the fight on the Quidditch pitch, planning for the DA and complaining about Umbridge had drawn them even closer, and Draco had discovered his attraction to the dark-haired wizard, fully prepared to die with that secret until Harry had kissed him out of the blue, in a darkened corridor outside the Gryffindor Common room. Things had progressed quite naturally from there. When he wasn't in detention, studying with his friends, or the DA, he made time to go to the kitchen's with Draco a snack/desert date, and they spoke of all things; things that made them happy or sad, angry or envious, and the things they missed. It had been simple and different than anything Draco could imagine. His various relationships among his Slytherin cohorts had been about satisfying his father's ideas of how a Malfoy should behave. Random trists and lustful encounters had meant nothing to Draco in the long run, but what he had with Harry was real, and everything about the relationship always felt new and fresh, because it was his choice, his wants, his needs that led him to Harry.
"No-nobody." He shuddered, and she smirked.
"Not sure, Georgie," Asteria responded, but she knew his worry, their family was inside. "Should we?" She asked the group, and they nodded and began the trek inside, they rushed into the Great Hall and found the all the Death Eaters had retreated, but the damage was substantial. Her grey eyes began searching the crowd but she shouldn't see the mop of platinum blond of her brother or the unruly mop that belonged to Harry, she could see a few redheaded Weasley's and followed George and Arthur to them as Dean went a separate direction. Molly bustled about, checking each of them before giving Arthur a quick kiss, and Charlie wrapped Asteria in his arms, kissing her forehead.
Asteria had to grip her leg to stop from racing out there and grab Potter. But she watched as the creature began to lecture the hood figures, ripping masks from them, one of which was her very own father, as he hit the ground, and seemed to be blubbering, which made her physically ill. She watched as Potter shouted, and suddenly, things took a turn. Potter was released from his spot on the grave, and grabbed his wand, pointing it at the creature, and he suddenly took cover. He was trying to catch his breath, from what Asteria could see, she inched out, wand ready, still hiding in the shadows. She took a deep breath, prepared to fight as Potter stepped out and took his stance, ready. And she felt a surge of pride for the young boy, and they flicked their wands, and their spells hit, connecting a link, and Asteria jumped out of the shadows, sending various jinx's and curses flying, as a ball formed around Potter and the creature, she kept close to him as she took a hex to the thigh, and waist, before sending even harder spells out, when Potter jerked away, and grabbed her arm.
This was always his plan, check to see if she even lived, but it was hard to tell. He was almost positive his sister wouldn't spill any secrets, but a part of him had hoped because it would reveal she was at least alive. Draco took a deep breath and rolled his shoulders, deciding to release his facial transfigurations. He let out a sigh of relief as he pulled a top strand down and recognized his platinum hair. He pushed himself up the stairs and went to his sister's room, looking it over as he found a seat on her bed. When a light appeared.
When it did, as usual, she felt as if she left her body. She could picture it clearly in her head, the vision of light, the sounds of waves crashing, the feel of sand under her feet. She could even see herself, sunglasses on her face, leaning against Charlie, her brother, and Potter running in the waves of the ocean. She felt serenity, safety, and peace in the dream her head tried to use to protect her from the pain. Even locked inside her head, she would've felt a probing at her mind for information, but it never came. She hadn't been taken for information on the Order or Potter. She could barely handle the lack of noise, could barely handle the lack of sound, the lack of feeling.
"What about afterward?" Ron asked, looking at her brother curiously.
Two months later, Asteria still hadn't acted on her anger towards Umbridge. Snape's words about not getting caught constantly played along with her head every time she thought of just outright hexing the pink witch. She had written to Alice, using a code they had created in Asteria's first year and hadn't received a response yet, it had begun to worry her. A full month without a response from her best friend was beginning to look suspicious. And on that Friday, she received a letter, not from Alice but from Sirius. Written diligently in code, but Asteria knew her cousin's writing.
"Mrs. Jones, come to have a seat, you as well, Ms. Black." Dumbledore insisted, prying Mrs. Jones off her, and helping her to a seat, and Asteria followed suit. "Well, it has come to my attention, that Ms. Alice Jones has disappeared," Dumbledore said with certainty, and Asteria felt her throat close up.
"Oh, Draco." She whispered squeezing his hands. "That isn't as bad as the things that Vold-" Charlie's hand suddenly appeared, covering her mouth.
"We've got to get you to a safe house, the both of you, as soon as she's healed up enough." Molly supplied, still waving her wand with a focused look.
"Is everything alright, mother?" Asteria was confused, her mother never spent much time in her children's room, and never looked so drained.
"What the bloody hell was that?" George asked, looking worriedly at the castle.
Asteria let out a sigh as she reached the common rooms, and went and changed, putting on her comfiest pants, and curling up with her little brother on the couch, as they traded off, telling stories. And it went silent as midnight hit.
"The same. Though I won't ever repeat this, our DADA teacher was loads better than the other two, but he, of course, favored Potter and his Gryffindork friends." Draco snarled, but let out a sigh. "I got attacked by a hippogriff, and Father tried to have the blasted creature executed, but it escaped, probably Potters doing as well."
"I didn't recognize the potion he used to be resurrected IF that's what we want to call it," Asteria said, sitting up, as Alice sat next to her on the bed, nodding at Charlie before focusing on everyone else in the room.
"You really shouldn't allow yourself to dwell so much on dreams, Potter," Lucius responded with a smirk. There was silence as Potter grabbed her arm, and launched an exploding charm at the top of the rows, Asteria launched a knockback jinx at the Death Eaters in for y of her and they began to run.
"Don't, Asteria!" Remus shouted, pleaded, and she paused, fury rolling inside her as she looked at her father. Lucius flinched, and she raised her wand, noise barely made its way into her head.
"Sia?" Charlie whispered, and Draco stood quickly, stepping closer to the bed.
"Things are going to get messy, aren't they?" She looked at Dumbledore and saw the look of worry briefly grace his features and he nodded.
"Mother?" Asteria called out softly, and her mother's blue eyes connected with her grey ones.
"Information gathering, Weasley." Draco responded, "And keep your sodding voice down, idiot. Merlin, I'm in disguise." At that, Fred looked at him and seemed to notice the dark hair and eyes he had worn during the wedding weeks ago.
"I'm going now." Draco groaned. He checked his pocket and gave a flick of his wand, vanishing from sight, and reappearing in the woods, where his sister's house had been last.
"Then why does he look up to him?" Potter asking curiously.
"Ms. Malfoy, I don't know who you think you are." She began but faltered as Asteria stepped up close to her.
"His injuries were serious, but he is going to be okay. Bill is with him now, and Charlie is on his way back as well." Molly said, pulling Potter into a hug, before reaching out to her. Asteria let the woman fold her into a hug, and Asteria gave her a small smile, pushing her to a seat.
"Do you know of the prophecy concerning Potter and Voldemort?" She asked, and once again, the Headmaster nodded.
"I was worried about you. We all were. Harry told us about the battle with You-Know-Who, and how hurt you were." Charlie whispered, "I'm sorry about Sirius. Harry's been really distraught over it as well." He finished, glancing at the younger wizards.
"I almost wasn't able to." He whispered, his voice struggling. "I did somethings, Sia. I used the imprisonment spell on dozens of Death Eaters, keeping them imprisoned as I sent them off to You-Know-Who."
"I can't do anything until my mother forfeits her rights as a parent if she ever does. Because if I take him now, Fudge will hunt me down for Lucius. And we would have the Ministry and Death Eaters on our trails." She finished with a sigh.
"In the book it said nonverbal. Harry never intended to use it, because no one was sure what it would do, but he recognized the scarring around where George's ear was, and told me about it." Draco finished, rubbing his thumb on the back of Asteria's hand.
"Professor?" Potter began, and Dumbledore shook his head.
"I changed his information last year, you've been the contact this whole time. And the rest?"
"Ah, and this is where things change, Mr. Potter was working under my orders," Dumbledore spoke, and Asteria nearly laughed out loud at his claim, it was reasonable enough but shocking enough.
"I don't know what we will have to do and how the dragons are involved, but I know they are." He added, and he just looked scared and stressed.
"Oh, hello Draco." She smiled at him, and even covered in grim, she seemed to shine. "The other should be here momentarily."
"Why do you assume that?" She asked, closing her eyes, regretting her question instantly. Her brother had a tendency to rant for hours about Potter.
Charlie found her one night, while Draco was out hunting Snatchers, sitting in the large chair on the porch. She had taken to sitting out there, staring at the ocean, listening to the waves, and he sat next to her, afraid to speak.
"Well, hello there, little brother." She chuckled as her brother jerked awake, clutching his throat, as he caught his breath. He glared at Snape behind her, before looking at her.
"Well, what have I missed?" She asked, and watched both Potter's and her brothers face go dark.
"I know Charlie was here," Alice added, pretending not to hear.
"Woah, mother outdid herself with your dress, Sai." Draco spoke up, looking at it. "You'll look beautiful, tomorrow night." He said with a smile. She looked at him, and winked, but she still didn't have a date. She'd been busy dodging Slytherin upperclassmen, and was slightly regretful, as she walked out of the Great Hall, the box holding her shoes and dress tucked under her arm.
"Oi! Dolores!" Asteria called out, the witch stopping abruptly, and turning to glare at her student.
"Oh, you think its funny?" She asked, pointing her wand to his head, "You think I can't find out?" She smirked evilly. "Legilimens!" She shouted, and felt her head fill with memories.
"Granger, they are after muggles. D'you want to be showing off your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang around... They're-" Asteria flicked her brother's forehead.
"So you may not want to trust me, but trust my rage, because I am all about revenge, and my focus is solely on Lucius and Voldemort. Now if you want to pass your exams, which I've already taken, and have been professionally trained since I was 5 on dueling, then stay, if you don't want to learn what I have to teach or what Potter has to teach, then leave. But if you whisper about this meeting to anyone, you best remember, I like revenge." She finished, sitting back down. And everyone followed suit, including Smith, who grumbled under his breath, and at the end of the meeting, made the same commitment as everyone else, and signed her name at the bottom of Granger's parchment. And she exited the pub before anyone saw her struggle to catch her breath and bury the pain. She had taken to the practice of just staring at the spot in front of her, catching her breath as the pain tried to overwhelm her, but she refused to fold. She rolled her shoulders, and headed back to the castle, she just wanted to catch up on her homework before Christmas break. She was pushing her own limits, as she struggled into her common room, and set herself up with extra quills, rolls of parchment, and her textbooks, beginning her mountains of essay's while almost all her professors had been forgiving enough, with what was going on, even Snape. Umbridge has not been, not that her grade really mattered, the exam determined everything.
"Well, then you should get some rest after we eat, and then we will all go visit him, alright?" Asteria announced, as she walked to the stove, flicking it on and dropping a pan on the stove.
"No, no." Voldemort continued.
"Bloody hell." He muttered, if it wasn't a Slytherin, that meant the suspect pool was that much larger, everyone always assumed that if Death Eater spies were at Hogwarts, they'd be in his house, even he believed that. And he had been without much information since leaving his family home, so he wasn't as up to speed on things as he should be. The person who took his sister was someone she hadn't viewed as dangerous, maybe thought he/she was an ally and allowed that person close, had probably even thought they'd come to help. Who could it have been?
Asteria was shocked, Christmas Eve as a package landed in front of her, an elegant Malfoy owl, grabbing a piece of sausage, before taking off. Her brother had gotten a similar package yesterday morning, containing his dress robes, and she could only imagine the monstrosity her father had sent her, until she saw her mother's elegant scrawl, written on the box. She gently opened the box, and found a beautiful, long silver dress and black heels; and she was suddenly very thankful for her mother, as she held the dress up.
"I'll find her, Remus," Draco replied, patting Lupin's arm softly.
Asteria places the journal back, and stepped out, letting the stone wall reform, as she made quick work of retracing her steps out of the chamber and back to the girl's bathroom, how on earth was she going to deal with all of this?
"What are you going to do?" Ron asked.
"I don't appreciate your tone." He growled, emotion finally pulling at his features. He stepped closer, hoping to intimidate her.
"Would Snape have done this?" Remus asked, and seemed to think it over again. Draco understood that. It was one thing to kill someone as quickly as the killing curse did, it was another to stand there and torture someone as Asteria had been tortured.
"My home has every protection charm and ward possible, set by Charlie and inspected by Albus. I will also be acting as the Secret Keeper. Now, I understand the issues you may have with this Molly, but this is more than for his protection, while he is staying with me, he will undergo intensive training as well as my brother."
"He hates me, already, Sia." He whispered, and he slid to the ground. "I'm not what he wants me to be."
"Sia.." he whispered, and he froze at the tears in her eyes.
"Maybe not, but Voldemort still tried to kill me, and Potter. I'm all about revenge." She responded with a wink. "So I fight this fight, and I fight for Potter because that's the right choice." She finished, standing, brushing the dust off her pants, and turned looking at the two men on the couch. "I'll die to protect him, but I'll kill to do it as well." She finished, walking back to the kitchen, pausing as she heard Sirius speak.
"You disobeyed a direct order." Her father stepped forward, into her room.
It wasn't even twenty minutes later, a body barreled into her room, jumping onto her bed, causing Asteria's eyes to fly open, and she let out a soft laugh as she stared at her brother, his grey eyes that matched hers, full of light and happiness.
"There are only two ways to stop father, the first is that I would have to be disinherited or father die before he actually creates the arrangement."
"Weasley, Professor. You mean we won't be doing any practical work?" He asked, and Asteria slid down into her seat.
"What about you, Charlie? Gonna return to Romania?" Ron asked with a curious glance at Asteria, who had tensed up slightly.
"Charlie, kiss me." She pleaded and he nodded, sitting on her bedside, he leaned down, pressing his soft lips against hers, a familiar fire lit up her insides, as he kissed her. He was gentle as he did this, teeth nipping at her bottom lip, before pulling away, and brush a black strand of hair from her face.
"I won't let it come to that, Dray." She finished, kissing his temple, and standing. "I've still got a few more pieces of homework to finish, I'll check in on you later." She finished before exiting the Great Hall. She ran a hand through her hair and let out a sigh before retreating to the library, mostly to catch a moment of peace. She slumped in a chair in the corner, and let out a breath.
"I need you to go to an address and lay some protection charms, I bought a house. It's small but has enough room, and since my mother relinquished her rights, I need it ready for Draco." She whispered, and he nodded. "It's already furnished, and ready, but I just worry about protection."
"Next, the Beauxbatons champion.." a piece of something flew out of the Goblet and into his hand once more, "is Fleur Delacour!" And once again, cheering happened, including Alice, whose face shined with pride.
"Thank you for your honesty, Yaxley." Draco smiled darkly. He lifted his wand to Yaxley's head and very gently, whispered, "Obliviate." Erasing the memories of being questioned, letting him keep the memories of chasing Harry because it couldn't be obvious his memory was removed. And Draco was positive Harry and the others were safe, even without sending a message or a Patronus, with full faith in Granger's ability to reign in Harry. Draco let out a breath as he untied the unconscious Yaxley, apparating and placing the Death Eater just below the stoop of the old Black House.
"Go on. I'll be good." She replied, and stepped back the way she came, as Potter send red sparks flying, alerting everyone to Krum. She nodded and took off, and within moments, came stumbling up to what looked like a dementor, and she froze, wand raised. But as she watched it, and realized her assumption was wrong. Raising her wand.
"How are you doing here?" He asked they hadn't spent much time together.
Asteria stood in the Great Hall at Hogwarts, sitting in her seat, watching as students trickled inside. She looked at the tiny eleven-year-olds, ready to be sorted. She caught sight of her brother at the Slytherin table,  who flashed her a smile, before focusing on the new students. She glanced down at the Gryffindor table and got the same reaction from the Trio, and she leaned back, letting her mind wander.
"They have no chance against us." Bellatrix laughed.
"You are a jerk, Sai. But not wrong, I do have to go." She said glancing at her watch, "It's almost time for the feast." She said with a wicked grin.Asteria glanced at her own watch and noticed it was true. They felt the library, arms locked and trailed down to the Great Hall. It had been rearranged for the announcements, Asteria and Alice, took their seats as Dumbledore began to speak, he droned on about the rules, what the tournament would entail. And waved his hand over the Goblet, a piece of paper flying out and into his hand.
"I know, but short of killing him, or somehow getting him to physically see Voldemort, there really isn't anything we can do, Sirius." She paused, "Unless we take him away from here." And Sirius' head shot up, and he looked at her with wide eyes.
"So, I spoke with Albus. Potter, Draco, you'll be staying in my home this summer, and Potter you will begin training." She said, pretending not to notice their embarrassment.
There was never peace. There was never tranquillity. There was never relaxation.
"It isn't safe anymore. I know that they didn't get in my mind, but I also know that until it's over. And it's not the same anymore." She replied, and pulled away from him. She waved her wand so her trunk and Harry's vanished, and began trekking down the stairs, her heart heavy.
"Yes?"
"Yes, well, that's what happens when you assume you know everything about everyone." He added with a wink at George, causing the man to chuckle.
"Harry went to Dumbledore's office. Snape's death and he gave his memories to Harry, he is probably looking at them." Ron supplied with a dark look. She could understand his feelings, Snape had made his life very difficult, but still watching a teacher die right in front of you was bound to affect. She nodded, and looked around again, praying her brother was alright. She could feel blood on her back from a wound she'd gotten, but she didn't acknowledge it, especially when she finally saw the blond hair, taller then most through the crowd, she went running from it but froze as she realized he was carrying someone, and being trailed by what looked like Percy.
Asteria had made one announcement before the school year began. That while she understood the public would like to hear the story, Harry Potter and company would not be making any statements until after they finished their time at Hogwarts, and if any member of the press was found on school grounds they would be punished severely by herself and McGonagall. Many faces had flinched and McGonagall had sent her a letter thanking her for making the statement on behalf of the school.
"Why was father so persistent that you joined?" Draco asked, his voice suddenly dropping low.
"Why did this have to happen?" Harry whispered, looking up at the sky with something akin to anger.
Three hours later, Asteria sat in her hospital bed and stared around her. Draco and Potter stood off to her right, Potter standing in a seemingly defensive form infront of Draco. Granger, Ginny, and Weasley sat in chairs infront of the bed; and Charlie, Tonks, Remus, Arthur, and Molly crowed the left side of her bed, and they were all glancing around, but Asteria, herself, had placed wards and charms to hide the conversation about to be had.
"Hiding?" Granger asked she seemed appalled.
Asteria at in a compartment aboard the Hogwarts Express, as was trying to squish the murderous rage brewing in the pit of her stomach. Her father had let the news slip about the Tri-Wizard Tournament and had said that she was to put her name in the goblet, whether she wanted to or not. She was under no circumstance to say no; he had given her a look that told her, he would make her life even harder than he was already doing. He had locked her in her room for the remained of the summer, refusing to risk her letting something slip, but she had announced to Fudge and the Weasley's that she would be attending Hogwarts at the start of the school year, so he had to let her out. But he made it very clear, what he would do to her mother if she went against his orders.
"You okay?" Potter asked, but keeping his distance. She nodded, grabbing her wand.
"What now?" Of course, it would be Ronald who summed it all up in one question.
It wasn't until the final month when disaster really struck, in the form of a betrayal. Being summoned by Albus to watch the school while he and Potter were away had been simple since she had been charged with this task many times when Albus left the grounds, but this time something else happened, the school was infiltrated by Death Eaters, thanks to Crabbe, Goyle, and Zabini. Everyone fought to the best of their abilities, defending the students, and the school, but a shout rang out along the darkened halls during the battle, and Asteria lost all sense and everything went black.
Asteria pulled his shirt off baring his freckled, pale skin to the moonlight and herself. Her fingers clutched at his shoulders when he ground himself between her legs. He leaned up and pulled her shirt off, revealing her pale skin and black bra, and he instantly kissed her skin. She moaned against, as her fingers fumbled with his belt buckle and button. He gave a wave of his wand, and both their pants vanished, as he positioned his erection between her legs, and pushed inside. She whimpered and moaned, as he groaned into her neck, before moving to kiss her hard.
"Harry, what happened out there?" The Weasley matriarch asked, eyeing Asteria carefully.
"I like that idea, Granger. Maybe."
The only reason she hadn't lost her mind yet was that she could remember doing those things with them so clearly, with perfect recollection. She could hear their voices and feel their presence. And she could lose herself in the memories, not acknowledging her agony, her starvation, her thirst, her desperation. She just wanted to go home, and not feel so weak. She could barely move her body with pain and weakness. She could barely speak with the dryness of her throat. She could feel that the seasons had changed through the stone under her. Once warm from the summer, now it was cool for fall and winter, so it would be freezing and she wondered if she could survive that without food, without warmth.
"No, I don't know. You and Charlie are so good together." Alice added.
It took a few days for Potter and his friends to find somewhere for them to practice, and she had followed them silently, under her disillusionment charm. It had been Potter's plan for her to arrive in such a way to showcase what she was capable of teaching, and he would use the Patronus Charm to showcase his ability. He had hoped that it would be enough for everyone to be sure and certain with the risks of this endeavor. Once everyone had trickled in, Potter stood to the front and pulled out his wand.
"He's back!" Potter cried out, "Voldemort is back!" And suddenly people were rushing them, and as tightly as Asteria held onto Potter, someone pulled them apart.
"Not yet. I had hoped to give this to you later after you were back to yourself, but I want to give it to you now." Draco responded, and reached under the bed he slept in, pulling out a delicately wrapped small box, and handed it to Harry. "Happy Birthday."
"Oh," Draco muttered under his breath, she knew her attacker, which could've been obvious, but it also meant she didn't view that particular person as a threat. Maybe a Slytherin he had known but didn't realize was involved in Voldemort's plans. Possibly Nott, but Draco doubted that. Theo Nott had been raised by his mother after his father's arrest years ago, and even Theo hated his father. Parkinson, maybe? No, Asteria didn't trust her in any sense and knew better than to underestimate the Slytherin female. Unless it wasn't a Slytherin.
"I am very sorry to inform you, but my associates just located Alice Jones, and she is gone," Dumbledore spoke, and Mrs. Jones let out a loud, broken sob, and Asteria couldn't stand it, and she turned on her heel and fled. Her feet barely carrying her down the stairs as she ran, she ran past many students, including Umbridge who cried detention, but Asteria didn't stop as she bust through the front doors to Hogwarts, she didn't stop there, she couldn't, and she tripped on her feet just next to the Black Lake, and couldn't control the flurry of emotion's coursing through her, and she screamed, her voice carrying into the morning sky. The pain in her chest was tearing at her, was beating at her, was killing her. She couldn't breathe, as the hot tears ran down her cheeks, and the wind whipped around her. She couldn't control her reactions, as her magic poured out of her in fury and pain, the water reacting, smashing against the ledge, the wind blew harder and Asteria simply scream.
"She'll be okay, Draco," Tonks whispered as her free hand rubbed her growing belly.
"Well, shit."
"Thank you guys, all of you. I'm sorry I lost it." She spoke out, her voice hoarse.
"And last but, certainly not last, our Hogwarts champion..." A piece of parchment flew out, and Asteria leaned forward in her seat, her breath stuck in her lungs. "Asteria Malfoy!" The Slytherin table erupted louder then ever before, with Draco jumping onto a table. Asteria was shocked, but gracefully stood, and with her head high, the Malfoy smirk gracing her face, she shook the Headmasters hand, and nodded at Snape, retiring to the back room. It was quiet as she took in the other champions, who stared at her, when a noise drew her attention from the way she came.
Advance Herbology - Sprout 1 pm
"And I for you." He responded, leaning his head on her shoulder.
"I'm Draco Malfoy, and I need to find Stan Shunpike," Draco responded with a sneer.
"Nott, you're taking me to the Ball tomorrow night, got it?" She said, dropping the box on the seat next to him, as he jerked his head at her.
"Asteria Malfoy, you tried to have me killed last year."
"Sia!" Draco shouted as he caught her before her head hit the ground. He lifted her gently, keeping the cloak wrapped around her frail body. He walked back up the steps and came face to face with Harry.
"Potter, I will not leave you," Asteria argued.
"I am, but only because I want you to be safe. But I also know you, and you wouldn't be Sia if you hid from this all." He grasped her hand as he spoke, and kissed the back of it. "I love you." He whispered against her skin, and her heart jumped, her eyes wide as she looked at him.
"Well?" Molly asked as she saw them both.
"That's because it's not in that book," Asteria supplied. "It's a third-year potion, he's probably testing what you remember from last year. However, the potion itself is quite simple." She finished and pulled out an extra piece of parchment, and began writing. "So first add a set of Fairy wings, and heat until the potion turns turquoise, add one measure of doxy eggs, and heat until it turns pink." She paused, thinking for a moment, "Add the toasted dragonfly thoraxes until the potion turns red, and I do mean red. Then heat until the potion turns blue. next add the thoraxes again, until the potion turns silver, heat again to red, add three measures of doxy eggs, a couple of thoraxes, heat until blue, add three flying seahorses, and heat until green." She finished, handling the boys the potion instructions. "The perfect Girding Potion. You should drop in that the potion, itself, gives extra endurance and is foul smelling." She finished, smirking and going back to her essay, finishing it off with a flourish.
"But I did find something out for you early. Rowle is supposed to be coming to the Cauldron tonight, with Yaxley and Rockwood. I've got a spell, it'll track the target all over Britan, and should help with you finding Asteria." George explained, pulling a piece of parchment out of his pocket. "I've already tested it on Fred, Lee, and Lupin. It should do the trick."
"How do I survive without you, Ali." Asteria smiled, and unwrapped the box, opening to reveal a lovely crafted necklace, on one side held the Thunderbird House crest from Illverymore and on the other, held the Slytherin House crest. It was elegantly created, and held powerful magic.
Asteria Malfoy has just transferred back to Hogwarts after being gone since her first year. She is being thrown into a relatively new world, with an uneasy feeling pulls at her spine. It's her second to last year and being apart of Slytherin doesn't make her as happy as it does her brother Draco. But when she is pulled into the Tri-Wizard tournament, to help a wayword 14 year old, she can't believe what she discovers in the process.
"Maybe they didn't at one point." Asteria responded, "but now, after spending the better back of the school year, being trained by me, being taught ALL the things I, a Malfoy, was taught, I think they stand a beautiful chance."
"Stupify, incarcous" she shouted at the nearest Carrow, who dropped as ropes covered them, and the other vanished with Snape. The hall erupted in voices, as Asteria stepped out of the shadows to the front of the hall, walking back to Harry. Everyone began separating as McGonagall ushered students out of the hall and out of the school, and Asteria stood in the Hall, staring at the proceedings before following the Gryffindor Head to the front of the school. She offered no comfort just cold determination, as she began instructing everyone to put up protection charms, and Asteria followed suit, her wand raised to the sky as she watched the charms take hold. She stepped back, and watched the others do the same, she didn't listen to McGonagall as she gave orders to a handful of students but wasn't surprised to see Seamus smile darkly as he took off, and she turned and disappeared, slipping up the stairs to find the unused girls restroom, she pointed her wand at the sink and instantly threw herself down the old hole, rolling to her feet once she hit the floor.
"I can't believe he did that. That-That bloody Weasel!" He snapped and paused. Draco glanced at him, taking in the shocked look on the redhead's face, and started to laugh as water ran over his bleeding hand, doubling over as George followed close behind.
"So things got rough, and Weasley ran?" Draco spoke up, drawing everyone's attention, and Ron winced.
"I don't know, but we have to figure it out." the younger witch supplied, and Asteria nodded and looked in the same direction, they'd have at least an hour before they'd return, it would take Harry awhile to get to wherever Voldemort was, a few minutes for it to happen, and then for Voldemort to come here with his Death Eaters. She wasn't sure how she knew he'd come, but she knew he wouldn't be able to resist, he'd probably bring Harry's body with him to show off. She inwardly grimaced at the thought, sparing a glance at Draco, wondering how that was going to go over, when she saw something catch her eye, Neville was picking something up from the floor. She looked closely at him and realized it was the sorting hat. She walked away and looked at the people milling about, professors rushing around, patching wounds, and younger students crying, the older students looked somber, staring into space. She could even make out a handful of Death Eater's being cataloged by Auror's, headed by Shacklebot. She watched in rapt silence, as she observed everything, the world moving fast around her.
And the results were handed out, Asteria in the lead, getting the max amount of points, 50, on top of her 40, from the previous task, adding up to 90, Potter with 45, added to 85, Krum who got 40, added to 80, and Fleur had a wimping 25 points. Asteria and Potter were in the lead, and Karkaroff was furious. He had given both her and Krum the max amount of points the judges could, but no one else did for Krum. He stormed off, taking Krum with him, while Asteria helped her brother off the ground, and they walked back to the castle together, arm and arm.
"Mother, where is father?" Asteria asked, barely looking at her sitting mother.
"Hello, Yaxley," Draco replied, taking a position against the wall, leaning back, arms crossed over his chest, looking relaxed. "Feeling alright? I was quite concerned that I had hit you too hard."
She watched as the separated with shy smiles and taking steps back, and Asteria let the door shut as she entered, drawing their gazes. Potter blushes hard and Draco looked at his feet.
"Draco, come here!" She shouted, and winced as her voice carried. Her brother poked his head out of the room and raised a brow.
"Brothers?!" She looked at him, taking in his startling red hair, blue eyes and freckled skin. "No bloody way, you're a Weasley!" She pointed at him.
"Just now actually. How was school?" She asked as he sat next to her, his back to her headboard.
"Sia, oh Sia." His voice wasn't enough to break the pain, and she tried to thrash out of his hold. She screamed again, and again, her voice going hoarse, and she couldn't make it stop.
"You don't understand, I..I'm..."Draco choked on his words, and she suddenly seemed to get it, what her baby brother was saying, remembering his younger years.
"Ridiculous. She had us read the textbook, we won't be doing any practicals in her classroom, as there are no real dangers in the world." Asteria responded taking a seat. "I fully understand she refuses to accept Voldemort's return, but that doesn't mean there can't be a new dark wizard, which could come up in our lifetime. How in Merlin's name does she expect us to pass our exams, which if we don't, it looks bad on her?" Asteria asked her head of house.
"Why didn't you tell me?" He asked, his voice was even, resigned.
It had been a week since the battle and Asteria was standing at the Ministry, watching Harry recount his story in the Forbidden Forest, requesting that her mother be cleared of all charges. She had assisted them in the Manor during their hunt, she had full-on lied to Voldemort about Harry being dead, and had protected him. She'd been shocked slightly when Harry had told her and Draco the story. But unlike her younger brother, she didn't know if she could hold out on hope. She sat in front of the entire Wizenagot, and watched Harry go over in explicit details, what happened in the forest, she flinched as he recounted the Killing Curse, his time in the space between, and how he came too, with Narcissa hunched over him, asking if her children lived. Kingsley sat at the head of the others, listening to the proceedings, as Asteria gripped her brother's hands. Harry stepped down, and returned to his seat beside Draco, wrapping an arm around his shoulders.
"Ms. Black, did you want to speak with me?" He asked, as everyone  vanished.
"Sia, come inside please." Charlie's voice broke through the silence and she looked at him, tears clear in her eyes, his eyes widen as he came forward, pulling her into his arms. She buried her face into his neck and let him hold her.
"So don't ever change." He finished in a delicate voice as they wrapped their arms around each other, just holding, drawing strength from the other. Lost in love.
"Crucio" it was silent, but it was painful as the spell hit her in the chest and she hit the ground, biting down on her tongue. When suddenly, Krum stiffened and fell to the front, face first, revealing Potter behind him, wand raised.
Asteria grumbled to herself as she caught up on defensive magic, rereading books to be prepared so she at least didn't die in the process. She knew chances were practically in her favor, Potter being 14, though luck did seem to run on his side; Krum, while capable, was a bit slow on some things, and Fleur, had never been much of a competitor, even from the beginning. She winced at the thought, the Beauxbaton champion wasn't cut out for the viciousness of this tournament and had adamantly voiced it. Asteria leaned back in her chair in the corner table of the library and let out a noise or exasperation. Alice had spent time with her, earlier in the morning, but vanished hours ago, to spend time with Fleur. Draco had snuck food into the library earlier on, making sure she had gotten some food but hadn't stuck around.
"You barely even liked Dumbledore." Harry chuckled.
"Pine Fresh." He muttered, just loud enough for her to hear, before returning to his room. She quickly grabbed her sweater and took off, running towards the bathroom with the egg, clutched tightly in her hands. She had 2 hours before curfew. She gingerly knocked on the door, and hearing no response, let out a worried sigh, saying the password, she pushed her way in, and locked the door quickly. She didn't pause to the look around the master bathroom, just eyed the large pool of a bath, already filled with water, she dropped the egg in and kneeling on the edge, dunked her head in and opened the egg, listening closely to the song.
"No you don't, you would be labeled the next Dark Lord, but that's why you have me. I inspire fear for you." She smiled, nudging his shoulder with hers. They got to the Atrium, and she focused, dragging him out towards the Visitor's Entrance, so they could safely and quietly leave. Once outside, she pulled him into an alcove and apparated them to the first step of headquarters. She gave him a grin and pushed him through the door, and he stumbled through and gave her a playful shove as they walked towards the kitchen.
"Aren't you done with fighting the bad guys, Harry?" Charlie asked, and Harry laughed.
"I wish I could say that there was," Crouch said, "But unfortunately, there isn't. The Goblet chose him. I just wish I knew how."
"I owed you one, kid." She responded, as the Minister bustled into the room, and she turned, expecting questions, but instead got anger, and she was taken back. He dropped the Cup down, filled to the brim with Gallons, and crossed his shoulders.
"Like that's much better. Sirius Black is a death eater." The plump witch replied, trying to intimidate her.
"I know you are worried." She whispered, but he smiled at her.
"I understand, Professor. But once it's certain, what will happen?"
"I think I'd like to go into something at the Ministry." Hermione supplied, and everyone laughed.
"Maybe." Was all Draco could say as something sounded outside, the sound of a portkey. Draco jumped to his feet and both he and Ginny rushes outside, Draco holding his wand tightly in his hands. But he froze at the sight, Hagrid looked tired, but right behind him appeared the person Draco needed to see. They rushed each other and Draco wrapped Harry in his arms.
"I have somewhere I can hide in the school, I can't leave with McGonagall hurt, Dumbledore and Hagrid gone." She said, before forcing herself to her feet. Raising her wand, she flicked it, casting her disillusionment charm, and left the hospital wing, passing Umbridge and her goons as they came for her. She headed to the Gryffindor common room, whispering the password, and slipping inside, finding Potter, Granger, and Ron by the fire.
Being left alone was disastrous for her mental state. She was left to contemplate the coming battles, the risks to her brother and Potter. The possibility of losing them as she had lost Alice and Sirius. The thought of it all coming to a head stemmed on the delicate fact that she had noticed the old curse lingering on Albus' hand, and had noticed that the usual twinkle in his eyes had dimmed. She knew the old wizard wasn't long for this world, he had already fought one war, defeating Grindlewald, and now he had fought for years against Voldemort. But the idea of losing the face of the Order, the headmaster of Hogwarts was nearly debilitating, but she knew not to speak of it, it would cause a fuss, a divide in the precarious minds of the Order, the population, the Ministry. She swallowed deeply as the thoughts rolled along the edges of her mind.
"Bombarda Maximum!" She shouted, the door blowing apart, "Expelliarmus, incarcerous" She shouted in quick succession. Keeping her wand raised, she stepped into the room, her anger barely controllable. "Who the bloody hell are you?" The man in the chair laughed.
"It hurts! Oh, Gods, it hurts. Make it stop, I'm begging you make it stop!" Asteria cried out, her hands gripping the arms around her stomach. "I can't make it stop!" She sobbed, her body shaking, her eyes staring up at the sky. "Alice, I'm so sorry." She leaned forward and cried out. But his hands never released her, and another set grabbed her face and saddened green eyes looked at her.
"We are safe, I love you." Harry's distorted voice sounded through the Patronus orb, and Draco released the built-up tension in his shoulders. Harry was safe, which meant everything, though he knew that wouldn't last. Harry was notorious for bad ideas and the other two weren't much better, but at least Granger was intelligent enough to make sure that whatever plan he came up with would be thought through.
"I figured, love." He responded in a supportive voice, but he still seemed sad. She looked at him, grey eyes searching blue ones.
"You can always talk to me, cousin, you know that." Was her only response, she didn't look up at him, just continued brushing the creature.
"I'll do anything for you." He responded kissing her forehead. She told him the address and he vanished out the door, and she sat up. Her body sore as she pushed herself up and to her feet, and she slipped out the same way, using the wall for support as she reached Dumbledore's office, it opened without a password, letting her inside, his door open as she softly knocked, the old wizard glanced up and gave her his smile.
"I mean, take him far away from Voldemort, for what this could mean, Sirius." She whispered, "You know just as well as I do, what all this is going to lead too. It'll be all out war, and I have a feeling that it'll all come down to Harry against Voldemort, and while I fully believe in his ability to fight, Voldemort is a skilled DARK wizard." She nearly shouted she needed someone to see why this could be a good option.
"No, you saved me too. You take it." Potter said, and Asteria shook her head.
It would be a fast hour when the three came into the bar from the street, wearing black flowing cloaks, much like the one his father had always kept hidden in his closet. Draco shook his head, hating himself for his inability to see his father for what he really was. Draco had spent months despising himself for his father's choices, but he wouldn't let that distract him, because Asteria needed him, and Harry needed him, even if no one else did. He lifted his wand, directed it out Rowle and cast the silent spell, and felt it connect, feeling the spells allure towards Rowle. When Draco closed his eyes who could feel which direction the wizard walked, as he walked directly out of the bar and into Diagonally, and stopped a few feet away. Draco decided apperation was a better choice, and did so, appearing on the room above the bookstore, facing Ollivander's, as the three Death Eaters entered the shop. Draco resisted the urge to help as he heard shouting and an explosion rocked the building and the windows shattered. He watched as Yaxley and Rockwood dragged an unconscious Ollivander out of the shop and spoke to Rowle who nodded and the three disappeared, and Draco closed his eyes, following them.
"I'd like to apologize, Asteria." Lucius began, but Asteria held up her hand.
"That is beside the point. The man has died, during the height of the third war he has faced, and he should be honored, even if I personally wasn't his biggest fan." Draco responded, undignified. "I had no issue with the wizard himself, just his obvious favoritism to Gryffindors, AND his complete disregard of your safety."
"I think I'll return to the hospital wing, Potter and Draco were still asleep when I slipped out, I believe they'd be quite worried to wake and find me not there." She supplies and headed back the way she came. Slipping into the room, she nearly fainted at the sight in front of her, Draco was holding Potters face, whose arms were around Draco's waist and their lips were pressed together, and it seemed wrong to see this this, and Asteria was reminded of a saying Alice used to say. There's a thin line between love and hate; you will believe you hate someone because you fear what you truly feel for someone, especially when you fear to love.
"As father said, Draco, of course, I'll be going." She said giving him her best smile.
"The Dark Lord wanted her or you to use for information, but you were too hard to catch, and she knew Shane and didn't question his appearance, even though he finished school when she did." Yaxley coughed violently.
"McGonagall offered me a teaching position." Asteria supplied, thinking back to an hour ago when the new Headmistress offered her the position as the new DADA position or even Potions, as Professor Slughorn decided to return to his retirement.
Now she sat in black robes, she'd be acting Potions Professor, temporary DADA professor, and Slytherin House Head, until McGonagall found someone to fill the positions, either DADA or Potions, Asteria wasn't picky about which subject she taught. She hadn't announced the only news she had though. She glanced down at her stomach, before glancing at her future husband. She had instrumented a few things, A surprise for the people in her life. When the food appeared, both Draco, Charlie, Harry, and the remaining Weasleys had gotten something other than food, but a note. Draco was the first to pick his note up and read his sister's elegant scrawl. He stood abruptly and looked at her at the head table, his grey eyes wide.
"But my father was a good man." Potter argued.
"Loathed as I am to say this, but she isn't wrong, mum," Ron spoke out before his mother could blow. Asteria looked at Alice and then Charlie, and sighed.
"Sia, I understand. Merlin, if I could convince Harry to run, I would. But Remus is right, Harry won't run, he wouldn't leave his friends." Sirius answered, but his admission settled her because it wasn't just her. They were fully aware of what would happen if Potter stayed, but they knew how he'd react, and so did she, but it didn't mean she didn't want to try anyway. Asteria sat on the couch, and both men followed her, sitting down next to her.
'Come seek us where our voice sound,
"Charlie, don't bother." She sighed. "You don't trust me, because of my last name, that's fine. But this isn't about me or you, it's about the fact that the Darkest Wizard since Grindelwald has returned, and I'm inclined to fight back, not with you, Mr. Weasley or your family. But besides Harry bloody Potter and most likely Charlie, because at least I'm not harshly judged by them." She gave a heartless chuckle. "But I've been trained my entire life, on the ins and outs of dueling and battle, because I'm still a Malfoy."
"Stan Shunpike, who had infiltrated Hogwarts under the guise of Shane O'Connor, a Ravenclaw Headboy." Yaxley groaned again, his head falling back.
"The old operator of the Knightbus completely meddled his mind, and dropped the kid on my doorstep." Ernie supplied and let out a sigh. "Don't know why Stan did it, always thought he was a stand-up guy. He's taken up with You-Know-Who."
"Well ain't that a kicker?" Asteria mumbled as Snape helped her stand, and Dumbledore did the same for Potter. They walked all the way to the infirmary laying them down on beds next to each other. Madam Pomfrey bustled over them both quickly, when the door flew open, revealing the Weasley family. Asteria sat up and stood, ignoring the healer's aggravation, and Charlie came straight for her, wrapping her into his arms. Ignoring the shocked gasps from his family, he pulled away slightly.
"She only kicked you two out, because you wouldn't quit arguing." Charlie supplied, annoyed. And Asteria choked on a laugh and looked at the two young wizards as they glanced sheepishly away from her and each other.
"Think you are so clever." His whispered, standing to his feet. He didn't speak until he was parallel with her, heading towards his room with mother. "But yes, daughter, I had a blast."
Currently, he was walking up to Bill and Fleur's seaside cottage, because the rumor was Weasley was there. Upon entering the house, he was shocked to see Ronald sitting at the counter looking pissed. He seemed to have grown a few more inches, but his clothes were dirty and old, and he looked tired as he rested his head on his arms, as Bill berated him.
"What about a healer?" Hermione asked, and Draco looked thoughtful at the suggestion.
"How is Arthur?" Asteria asked, speaking the question everyone seemed scared to ask.
After the situation at the Ministry, Draco apperated them to her Manor, where their mother followed. She had taken her daughter to the main bedroom, and they discussed all things until Charlie returned early the next morning, came barreling into the room, before skidding to a stop at the sight of mother and daughter curled up in the four-poster bed, fast asleep. He had left it at that and made them breakfast and coffee for when they woke up.
"The word around is, that you keep track of some locations, and relay that information to the right side," Draco whispered, his eyes darting left and right. Noting that it was quite empty in the bar, thankfully still early in the day.
"Well, now that good news has been shared, tuck in!" McGonagall laughed, sending a bright smile at the student body as they returned to their meals.
"Merlin, mate. When was the last time you ate?" Fred asked, and Draco shrugged in response, and Fred grabbed his arm, tossing his own hood up and dragging Draco out the back door, leading to Diagonally, and nearly forced him into the door of his shop.
"But we seem to be having a hard time getting enough signal to broadcast to more people," George added.
"At some point, during his school years, the Riddle family was killed. While Muggle authorities were baffled by the deaths, I knew it was magical. I couldn't prove my suspicions about Tom, but I knew he killed his father, and paternal grandparents."
"A Confundus Charm?" Asteria spoke out and everyone looked at her. "A powerful one, I'd assume. I mean, the Goblet is only suppose to pick 3, right? So a strong enough Confundus Charm, to make it believe there is 4 instead of 3, place Potter's name under a fourth school, being the only one, he'd be the only option." She shrugged. And Crouch looked at her flabbergasted.
"I remember every witch and wizard in this shop, so I know very well, who you are buying these robes for." Malkin's smiled, "Let Molly know it was no charge for my old friend. And please, keep an eye on Mr. Potter." She winked and ushered Asteria and Tonks out of the shop.
"I should've expected, being a dragon tamer and all that." Asteria responded, leaning against a wall by the Great Hall. "But that doesn't explain, why you are still here."
"I wish I could do that." He responded.
"I just don't want you to get hurt either." Harry breathed, "I can't lose you as well." He added, resting his forehead against Draco's.
"Angry, and protective, as usual. I told him about why father wanted to me to enter the tournament so badly, and he didn't react well." Asteria shrugged.
"We need to kill the snake, that Voldemort keeps with him." She supplied, looking out the door of the Great Hall.
"Why didn't you say anything? Why did you offer me anything?" Draco demanded, and Potter sighed.
Asteria stepped into her room and gave a quick flick of her wand, and all her belongings flew into her trunk, filling quickly. She nodded to Charlie, who slipped back into Harry's room, to do the same. She knew Draco had already cleared his own room out. She didn't care much about the furnishings, they were material things. But the sentimental things, the pictures she had accumulated over the summer with both boys. Pictures of them laughing and training. She would not lose those.
"I used the spell you gave me. I followed the three from Ollivander's to the Manor, and then followed Rowle to the Ministry, and finally to Godric's Hollow." Draco explained, "Rowle went to the cemetery, and moved the angel statue, revealing a secret chamber. Where they had her blindfolded, a muggle charm over her ears, and she was" Draco choked out, "chained to the floor, like an animal." Draco closed his eyes and snapped them open. "Harry and Granger were there. I didn't ask why I had to get Asteria somewhere safe."
Voiceless. Never making a sound no matter what happened, no matter who opened the only door, and what that person did. NEVER. MAKE. A. SOUND.
"It seems sending you to America was a mistake, you have forgotten your place, child." He replied, and she focused her gaze at him.
"Please, let's move past your inability to accept that I'm not mother or Draco." She replied, sitting across from him.
"Merlin," Charlie whispered, looking at Draco.
Asteria's schedule was packed, but as usual similar to her packed schedule at Illverymore. Someone had done their research when making her schedule, and she glanced up at the Head table and got a small smile from the Headmaster, giving her a knowing look and she nodded in appreciation at him. How'd she was going to juggle this schedule and the possibility of being apart of the tournament, she wasn't sure, but brushed the thought from her head, and checked her watch. only 7:30, she still had plenty of time before her first class, but stood anyway, and began the trek down towards the Transfiguration classroom, and slipping into the empty classroom, she took a seat at the front of the room, placing her head in her arms, and mentally prepared herself for the day of first classes, back at Hogwarts. Prepared for the amount of homework she'd end up with.
"Head Girl? I just don't get it." She added, and Potter shook his head at her as he dusted a curtain.
"Sorry to come at the hour, Professor, but I needed to speak to you." She said, pushing the door opened, the Headmaster sat behind his desk, and he looked so tired, she almost felt bad for coming by.
"Don't let me ever catch you using that term again, little brother." She growled in annoyance, as her brother looked at her shocked. "Now, Potter, Weasley, get Granger out of her, before they catch wind of her. And do keep to the shadows, I'd rather nothing happen to you three." She finished, before dragging her brother deeper into the forest. When they finally got far enough away, Asteria shoved her brother away from her.
"What?" Potter muttered as he sat up, and his eyes went wide.
"No need to worry, little brother." She said, glancing at her mother, whose eyes seem to bore into her soul, "Father's out there, you are safe." And her mother's eyes widened, and a hand covered her mother.
Or when he had been 10 and had been playing with a house-elf, and he knocked over a priceless vase, and Asteria took the blame for it. Or when he'd been 13, and had snuck out to meet a muggle boy, and Asteria claimed that she had told Draco that the muggle was a wizard, and their father had beaten her so hard, he broke her arm. Anytime Draco had done something reckless or stupid, Asteria had taken the blame, and he knew she continued to do it, even when he wasn't aware he'd angered father. She'd end up stuck in bed for an entire summer, but she had always come home from school and returned as if nothing had happened. He always knew she hated coming home, and for the longest time, he'd never understood why she continuously returned, until now. He wanted to take her pain away severely. He wanted to ease her suffering. He had been too young and naive to acknowledge the sacrifice she had made for him as they'd been younger, but now? Now that he was an adult and without her everlasting protection, he felt the need to acknowledge every memory, and felt the guilt, the regret, the need to give her that same protection.
In the week since the battle, the three of them had stayed with the Weasley family, as Asteria hunted for a home. She had finally found one, about 6 kilometers away from Hogwarts. With her accepting the role as the new Potions Professor as well as the Head of House Slytherin, and Charlie accepting the teaching position as well, she felt being closer to the school was nice, considering Harry and Draco had decided to return to the school. She hadn't had to look for long, both McGonagall and Abe had made suggestions at where she could find something. The house she picked was large, closer to the size of a Manor, with more than enough room for everyone. She had loved the look of the house, decorated in a light grey and black trim on the outside, and full-sized windows, that let in plenty of natural light. The inside was decorated similarly to the outside, with light grey walls, but white trim, along each entryway. The home came fully stocked with furniture and a stocked large library. Draco and Harry already picked their room and decided to call the entire west wing theirs. Which Asteria had no issue with, as she had taken the east wing for herself. From her room, she could see the ocean near the Manor, and opening the window would let the sandy smell into her room, basking her in it. Charlie had returned to Romania to pack up all his belongings, and she wondered how things would play out concerning her mother.
The week before the first task had just sent her emotions on a whirlwind. Draco had irritated her beyond anything when he came complaining about Moody transfiguring him into a ferret. He'd been incredibly offended when she burst into laughter. After her brother had taken off, she had found Potter waiting for her in the library, wringing his hands. Asteria had simply walked past him, and he had diligently followed her to her usual table, sitting next to her with a worried look.
While for the most part, I usually try and keep to canon references, this fanfic will be a bit different. Obviously. There will be some romance, but it isn't the base of the story, and I'm sure you hate reading about the "GOOD" slytherins, but as a Slytherin, its my duty to write one into every fanfic I write.
"Professor, I understand your reluctance, but I can lay all the protection charms, as well as the Keepers one, I know who'd I give the honor too as well, and near the ending of summer we will all go to the Weasley's, which mind you is more publicly known than my own home, he'll be safe and I think he'd prefer it as well."
"I didn't know you were home!" He shouted, bouncing on his knees. He had grown a few inches in the time she'd been away, he was thin but it balanced his sharp features well.
She had 2 more hours left before the third task was to begin, and she dropped her head on the book in her hands. She was just so tired, but sat back up straight, and gave a wave of her wand, sending the books into their proper place, and left the library, heading towards the common room to change. She stumbled in her room, and pulled on her black skin-tight pants, a fitted black top, piling her hair on the top of her head, before sliding, and lacing up knee-high black boots, and tucking her wand into the top of the boots, stretching slightly at her appearance, and glanced into her roommates standing mirror. The shirt had been a gift, having a green 1 printed on the back and 'Malfoy' across her shoulders, in silver. Draco had given it to her for this task, and she couldn't resist wearing it, as she exited the common room, and began the walk to the Quidditch pitch, and was shocked to see her mother, looking elegant as she sat at the front, next to whom she assumed was Krum's parents. Dumbledore seemed to be talking animatedly to Karkaroff and Snape. Asteria stood next to her mother and was shocked to see her looking worried.
"Oh, sorry. we didn't realize this compartment was taken." The dark-skinned guy answered, his eyes focusing on her tie, and raised an eyebrow.
"He'll be okay, they won't let anything happen to him." Ginny supplied, but the sentiment didn't reach her eyes, she knew as well as he did, the dangers her own family was taking.
"How good men have fallen with the return of You-Know-Who?" Ernie said rhetorically.
"And I you, my sweet boy." She responded as she pulled away. She looked at Draco and smiled at him. "And you as well." She took a hand of Harry, and touched Draco's face as well, wiping a stray tear off his pale face.
It was a long time before the shouts and smell of fire passed, the silence was shocking, but Asteria didn't release her brother the entire time. Not until the sun started to peak through the trees, and Asteria knew their mother would be frantic searching for them. Draco had fallen asleep in her arms, much like he had when they were younger, so Asteria maneuvered them, placing him on her back, struggling to carry her not so little, little brother. His legs were dangling and he silently snuggled closer to her back, as she attempted her trek through the forest back towards their camp, and she watched the bustle of the people around. She silently walked, towards her tent, further away from the others, and obviously Malfoy. She sneered at it, but quickly squashed the emotion, and pushed onward, and entered it. She made a noise, at the sight of her father sitting motionlessly at the table, their mother asleep in her bed. She walked past him and gingerly placed Draco on his bed. She stood up straight, her back cracking slightly finally free from the weight of her brother.
"Miss. Edgecombe," Umbridge said in her high pitched voice, "Tell us how long these meetings have been going on, dear. You cant shake your head, I'm sure that won't make the spots worse. Have they been happening regularly over the last six months? Just nod or shake your head." Asteria was quick on the draw, forcing the young witch to shake her head.
"Bloody hell," Potter muttered with an agitated sigh. "Why is it always me?"
"Yes." Yaxley choked on the response.
"I need the password to the Prefect bathroom, don't ask questions, just give it to me." Asteria asked, giving him her best smile and he sighed.
Draco Malfoy stares into the embers of the fireplace. His spot on the couch at the Weasley's house had offered him little comfort. But it didn't stop his thoughts from wondering; the summer had been near debilitating. Harry has been sent back to his muggle house, and Draco had been stuck staying with the Weasley family. Mrs. Weasley had taken to watching him closely, making sure he didn't run off recklessly, not that he would. Recklessness wasn't a Slytherin trait, but she knew he was planning something. It wasn't just him, though. Harry, Granger, and Weasley were as well. He knew their plans and had willingly not inserted himself in them, he had to find out what happened to his sister. A part of him hoped she was dead, saving her from endless torture, but the other part knew she was alive, Lucius wouldn't kill his child so quickly, but it had been nearly three months since she had been taken. Draco let out a breath and looked up seeing Ginny standing at the entrance of the living room, Molly Weasley bustling in the kitchen to distract herself. The house was empty except for them, everyone going to retrieve Harry.
"SHE ASKED ME TOO" Draco whispered-yelled. Potter rolled his eyes and focused back on Asteria.
"Shacklebolt offered me an immediate place in the Auror's department." Harry supplied.
"You will learn both charms during these lessons, just not today. We will start with simple things because those two are hard to do." Potter explained. "We will start with the Disarming Charm."
"I don't know, but probably not."
"How are you?" He asked in a hushed whisper, pulling her into a small alcove.
Asteria wasn't surprised when she woke the following morning to another decree, declaring Umbridge as the new Headmistress of Hogwarts. Things changed almost instantly. Peeves got risky with pranks against the new headmistress, and the teachers mocked her, rewarding anyone who resisted the witch with points and sometimes sweets. The worst were the twins, they never hesitated to torture the witch with exceedingly dangerous pranks. Then came the swamp and dragon fireworks, with the departure of the Weasley Twins, fleeing the school on their broom with laughter, and announcements of the shop they were openings. And since she and Potter had both willingly given their earnings from the Triwizard tournament to them, they had to come clean with that information. Potter told their friends, while Asteria came clean in a very apologetic letter in Molly and Arthur. Luckily they didn't blame her or Potter for their wild children.
"Explain.." George finished.
"Disregard for my safety?" Harry asked.
"Hide, I guess. I can't hide in the Room of Requirements, Umbridge knows about it." Asteria supplied, and sighed.
"The Forbidden Forest." He responded and they all took off as a group towards the looming trees. Reaching the line of the tall trees, as Potter and Granger stumbled out, Asteria didn't ask questions just handed them their respective wands and looked back up at the school.
With all the surrounding darkness, it was hard to imagine being freed from it, or what it was like to be free, to feel safe. It was beginning to be hard to focus on what life was like outside of the darkened room. She hadn't eaten in who knows how long, or had anything to drink, hadn't really slept. She just wanted her bed, her brother, Harry, and Charlie. She wanted to be hugged by Molly and joke with Arthur. She wanted to laugh with the Twins and let Granger grill her about potions. She wanted to fly a broom with Ginny and make faces behind Bill's back with Ron. But most of all, she wanted her mother, to hold her, to tell it was going to be okay, that she was still proud of her. She wanted Alice to braid her hair, and talk about boys. She wanted Sirius to joke with her and tell her stories of Remus. She wanted to listen to Tonks talk about Remus with the same light in her voice as Sirius. She wanted to feel the wind on her skin, and listen to the trees on Hogwarts ground. She wanted to stare out at the black lake and catch snowflakes on her tongue with Harry.  She wanted her brother to read to her as he used to. She wanted Charlie to kiss her.
"HAVE YOU LOST YOUR BLOODY MINDS?!" She shouted, protecting both Hagrid and McGonagall, facing the officials and Umbridge.
What the hell was going to happen next? she wondered silently.
She was shocked slightly when a few people walked into the room, it was early. She quickly pulled out her wand, summoning a piece of parchment, and wrote a quick note and vanishing it with a silent flick of her wand, sending it to Arthur, before settling back in her crouched position, wand tucked into the side of her boot, easy to access, but not immediately in her hand. She was stressed out when the rest of the court witches and wizards came through, and a few followed, opening a backdoor, letting a hoard of Dementors in, and a plump witch flicked her wand and a cat appeared, corralling the creatures to the ceiling. When Fudge came into the room, and Asteria resisted the urge to strangle the stupid little man. His constant need to undermine Dumbledore and her, he had successfully killed all hope that anyone would believe the claim of Voldemort's return, and leaving people for the taking, once the Dark Wizard decided to act.
"But I could, I was best in my Potions class under Severus Snape, and I am still a Malfoy," Draco said, unable to resist the luxury of fear that played across his captives face. "Now, do you know where my sister is?"
"He's a Death Eater?"
When one word jumped at her, one piece of magic screamed out at her, and she realized what happened, what the truth was behind Voldemort's return. And she knew how he had accomplished it.
The End.
"Think about it, Charlie. At 11-years-old, Harry went against You-Know-Who who was attached to his DADA professor. At 12, he had to go against the spirit of You-Know-Who AND a basilisk. At 13, he learned one of his father's best friends betrayed them to said dark wizard. At 14, he gets dragged into a dangerous tournament, because Albus didn't vex his professor enough, and has to witness the return of the person who killed his parents, and wants to kill him. At 15, when the entirety of the Wizarding World thinks Harry is a liar and insane, he was practically tortured by ANOTHER professor and had to witness the death of his godfather, who he loved very much. At 16, he had to learn everything he could about the monster who is hunting him and then watched his mentor be murdered by his DADA professor or ex-potions professor. Now at 17, he is on the run, probably fully aware of what's happening back in the world, and is out risking his life for a war that isn't his bloody problem. All because of that twisted headmaster and You-Know-fucking-Who." Draco explained, his temper flaring slightly.
Now, she was even more concerned, glancing at her watch, she stood, clutching both letters to her chest and went towards the headmaster's office, she shoved the letters in her pack and took a deep breath before officially approaching the gargoyle guarding the office.
"Apologies, Professor McGonagall." Asteria supplied, watching the fugitive closely. He was rumored to be in league with Voldemort, but he hadn't been at the meeting, and the look of pure concern for Potter on his face spoke to her. The entire room was stunned into silence. "I'm guessing the prophet has been lying about you and your loyalty, Sirius Black." She spoke up, and all eyes jumped to her.
"No, sir." Potter responded, fear evident.
"Oh, come on. I couldn't be in the area and not take the chance to see you." He said, stepping closer.
"Your father has mentioned you, you've been attending Illverymore, the school in America, correct?" Fudge asked, going for a polite small talk.
"Yes?" She muttered, not really in the mood, and her back throbbing at the pressure on it.
"Godric's Hollow." He replied, his voice going dark. "Lily and James were buried in Godric's Hollow, not far from their family home."
"What are you talking about, Sia?" He asked, looking at her.
"I love you, Asteria." He responded and she leaned up, attaching their lips in a fevered kiss. He squeezed her tightly as he devoured her mouth. He leaned her back, laying her on the cloak in the sand. She gripped his hair tightly, letting him settle between her legs, as she pulled her mouth away for a breath, his lips traveled down her neck, alternating being kissing and sucking on the pale skin. Causing her to moan softly into the night.
"I'll keep an open mind if he approaches me, I'm aware if he does reach out that it'll be a one on one thing, and not with his goons watching." Potter supplied, and glanced at his watch. "Asteria, I'll give him that chance, but I can't promise that everyone will be as open as me."
Upon returning to Hogwarts, Asteria could feel the change in the air. She had masterfully avoided dealing with Umbridge observing her classes before the break, and she knew that with Umbridge's obvious disdain of anything close to Dumbledore or half breeds, something was bound to change. She hadn't made any move to rejoin with Potter and his group of friends, simply being too busy researching Voldemort and creating her own spell, she simply didn't have time. But when the emotion explosion happened in the courtyard as Asteria walked past it, she couldn't help but seethe in anger as she watched Umbridge execute her right to remove teachers, by publicly removing Profession Trelawney, a class Asteria had barely considered attending. But it didn't change the fact that what Umbridge was doing was just cruel. The Divination teacher had been at Hogwarts for 16 years, it wasn't till both McGonagall and Dumbledore appeared to settle the issue, did Asteria moved, and listened to the retreating Umbridge who mumbled about disgusting half breeds and idiots, when Asteria decided to play a card she had been holding onto.
Following their departure came the exams not long afterward, and Asteria forced herself to abandon her research for studying for the exams. She impressed each examiner with her cool intellect and fast response for all her practicals. The written ones, flew past, until she finished her Advanced Potions one and decided to go on a late night walk, only to see a group of Ministry officials walking out of the school, lead by Umbridge, towards Hagrid's hut, and she followed, worried about how the outrageous Headmistress was going to handle the situation. But things got out of control fast, as Asteria watched from the distances, running after the group, she flung stunning hexes out, trying to stop the Officials as they attacked Hagrid who came out of his hut. And she wasn't the only one, McGonagall came flying past her, and fought even harder and took 5 stunning spells to the chest and Asteria screamed, throwing up a barrier to protect the Transfiguration professor.
"I didn't come home, because I couldn't. Draco, I was there, I saw everything. I watched our father grovel at Voldemort's feet, and it was disgusting. And then what Voldemort did to Potter?"
"I need to fight, Charlie." She whispered, she'd seen his apprehension as she had begun retraining her body and magic.
"Charlie." She called putting and he responded, coming out of Harry's bedroom. He smiled at her softly, his hood hiding his face. He had been hesitant about being her here. But relented when she had told him she'd go alone. She looked at the layout of the upstairs, her room was right at the front of the stairs, so encase of the worst, she'd be the first alerted.
"I don't think you understood the question, did you, dear? I'm asking whether you've been going to these meetings for the past six months? You haven't you?" Umbridge tried coaxingly. But again, forcing her will, Edgecombe shook her head again.
"And the Durmstung champion is.." He trailed off, his voice magnified by magic as he checked the slip, "Viktor Krum!" The students erupted in cheers for the guy who casually walked forward, shaking Dumbledore's hand and walking to the back room.
"Did you know, not a single person has survived a year in the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts?" She asked the plump witch, who looked at her dumbfounded. "Here is to another death to follow Quirrell." Asteria finished, and waved her wand at McGonagall, levitating her off the ground, and beginning the trek back to the school. She paused and faced the crowd of Ministry employees.
"We should go there now, it'll be better for her when she wakes," Molly added, and stood, she motioned to Draco who stood, but the older witch pulled him into a tight, warm hug. And Draco was overwhelmed as it happened. "You've done so well, Draco dear. I'm so proud of you, and she will be too once she wakes up." The witch murmured against his shoulder.
"I've missed you so much, Sia." He whispered into her hair, squeezing her tightly.
The first half of the battle had been fast, everyone split off and took different directions, hoping to get reconnected with everyone. But Asteria took a separate turn, and ended up in an empty room, a room that held absolute nothing. Lighting her wand she glanced around and had to roll her shoulders and focus forward to not get distracted by the ominous feeling the room left in her stomach.
"I can't return to Hogwarts anymore than you can. And I can't just hide out here, I need to find her and while you are off, destroying Horcoxes, I will find my sister." Draco responded and looked at his boyfriend.
"What is it?" He asked, no thoughts to refuse and she knew it.
"Mostly a revenge plan, against Umbridge." Draco supplied, with a wicked smirk.
"Of course he was because Gods forgive if I was sorted into any house besides Slytherin." Asteria chuckled. Her voice caught in her throat as McGonagall step inside, with a big black dog. Asteria's eyebrow quirked and she nearly had a heart attack as the dog began to morph into a man. Sirius Black.
"Woah," Charlie whispered against her back.
-I know its a short chapter-
"I'll get you some food," Charlie said, placing a kiss on her other hand, and leaving the room quietly.
"I know, love." He responded pulling back, looking at her face. "Things will be alright."
"Because I refused to tell you. It isn't your burden to carry, little brother." She responded.
"How dare you stand where he stood!" Harry's voice broke the impeccable silence, as he drew his wand on Snape, who responded in kind but was stopped by the powerful stance McGonagall took in front of Harry, and Asteria acted.
"Dray, so who are you daydreaming about?" Asteria asked, catching her brother gazing at the fire. His head shot up, and he looked at her.
"Wait, how long did it take you?" He asked. And she shrugged her shoulders.
Umbridge would regret doing this, she would regret causing Potter more pain. Asteria had many ways to damage this teacher, but she had to do so in a way that it didn't reflect directly on her, she let out an aggravated sound in the back of her throat, and retreated towards the Head Common rooms, she slipped inside and went into her room, discretely going to trunk and shoving her parchment from earlier inside, and shutting. She leaned back against the bedpost and let out a breath of air and let her eyes wander shut.
"Disarming? Are you joking?" Smith spoke out, and Asteria rolled her eyes.
Asteria had looked into the information Dumbledore had given her about Tom, searching archives for information about the inbred Gaunt family, not that it was an easy task. Not much was recorded at Hogwarts about the ancient pureblood family. She had gathered bits, spending countless days learning all that she could. The issue was, no one had known what actually happened to Salazar Slytherin when he left Hogwarts, having vanished into the Chamber of Secrets. So her only possible bit of information was a secret place, she didn't even know where it was, or how to get to it. She rightly assumed, Salazar made it impossible for just any student to get inside it. Slytherin's weren't known for their paranoia for nothing. She sat buried in the Restricted Section, well past curfew when Madam Prince came bustling in.
