“He has to say the incantation,” Malfoy says darkly, wand ready. “With a little intent, that’s all it takes. It’s an old spell.”
“You have thought about it,” Draco murmurs, baring his neck for Harry to kiss. “I bet he likes to be spoiled, don’t you think?” He squeezes Harry’s cock and his hand goes to unbutton Harry’s trousers. All while Draco keeps talking. “The things he would let us do,” he whispers, “we would take such good care of him.”
They soar and crash time and again and take each other apart in every possible way until they both collapse from exhaustion in a heap of tangled limbs and tousled hair.
“Aren’t you going to ask me why I came back?” Draco asks.
Harry puts the phone away feeling uneasy, asking himself what the fuck was he thinking?
Harry snorts. “Thanks, I guess.” After a heartbeat, he asks wryly: “Just the continent?”
He stands and walks up to the bar to examine the, frankly lacking, wine selection, when there’s movement in his peripheral vision. The bell above the door chimes and Draco’s stomach jumps when it’s none other than Harry. He walks in, smiling at a waitress, and immediately notices Draco standing by the bar. His heart does that stuttering thing it’s been doing since Harry came to his flat last night and he wonders if he should get it checked out. Before he can collect his raging thoughts, Harry smiles at him, the most beautiful smile Draco’s ever seen, and starts to walk in his direction.
Harry opens his mouth but nothing comes out and Draco comes closer. The couch dips under him and Draco sits down, a little further away than usual, giving Harry space for some unfathomable reason, and it’s infuriating when he’s just understood that distance from Draco is the last thing he wants right now.
They’re getting closer and Malfoy can now hear them too. There are voices, two, no, three men. They’re close. Harry activates the Portkey and holds it out.
“How flattering.”
“I hate you.”
“Ask,” Harry whispers, “just don’t strain yourself, don’t fall asleep—”
“It means you’re really staying for good,” Harry murmurs.
“Yes sir,” Robards nods, turns on his heel and promptly leaves the office. Harry bats away the memory of Malfoy saying there’s a Family spy in the DMLE. He did mention it but it has gone without comment as his bosses looked over the evidence.
“And you’re our little Won-Won,” Harry sniggers and ruffles his hair.
“Twenty-four—
With his ridiculously perfect body, and stupid gorgeous eyes, and tacky pickup lines, Potter is such an utter himbo Draco can’t objectively take it, but that’s never been an issue since Potter is usually more than eager to be the one
Seamus opens his mouth and closes it. He opens it again. “I’m going to regret this but: they?”
His heart hammered in increasing panic as the light flickered with an electric buzz, illuminating the cobwebs hanging on its metal casing and bathing the sordid space in a bloody glow. The ring on his finger seemed to pull him under and—
He blinked his eyes to stop the sting before it turned his vision blurry. He couldn’t fall apart now.
Harry forces his eyes to adjust to the strange lighting—it bears a reddish tinge due to all the surveillance spells hanging heavy in the air, their soft crackle so subtle, it’s only audible if one knows to look for it. It’s not quite like a darkroom, but close enough to throw Harry off. He can make out a silhouette of a man sitting in one of the metal chairs on the opposite side of the rusty table. The shackles screwed to its top are open, the old magic that once commanded them long withered—only the chains dangling to the sides and pooling around the legs still have enough juice to clatter obediently at the presence of an enlisted Auror.
Harry sits still and watches Draco for a reaction, an indication. To what, he’s not sure, but he feels there’s something unspoken hanging in the air, something they both should maybe say or do but instead, they discuss departmental hierarchy like it was the weather and stare at each other with nearly unbearable intensity.
. So I bargained.”
“Draco—”
At the first lick of magic spilling from Harry’s wand and twirling around Malfoy’s injury, he gasps and slams his hand down and over Harry’s free one, wrapping his fingers tightly around Harry’s wrist, squeezing it so hard, his knuckles turn white.
Malfoy deflates with a sigh, dropping the theatrics. “I was hoping we would avoid that awkward little part where I remind you I will only speak with
, fuck—” Draco shivers under his touch, trying to keep his hips from thrusting as he clutches the bedsheets.
To be fair, one of those things is not really a secret
Kingsley casts a quick look at Robards who’s examining his nails way too attentively to ever be believable, leaving the talking to the commander-in-chief. The Minister’s eyes darken. “You might be—” Shacklebolt clears his throat. “You might be
“Spoiled git,” Harry huffs, and adds before Draco can form a retort: “It’s open twenty-four hours, we can go later tonight.”
“You’re insane,” Harry whispers, shaking his head. “It’s never going to happen—”
Harry wants to melt into him. His throat is sore, there are tears in the corners of his eyes, and Harry is so in love he could die.
“Mm. Maybe,” Harry murmured, taking a step forward.
Their combined testimonies last for two and a half workdays, after which they’re dismissed from the stand and Harry feels like he’s woken up from a nightmare. He remembers leaving the elevator and thinking
,” he whispers, moving to the other one, feeling it harden under his tongue.
“Are you a wizard or not?” Draco says urgently, moving to suck on his nipple. Harry gasps and buries his hand in Draco’s hair. “Cast a Stasis Spell before I Apparate us to the bathroom
“You know bloody well we’re both familiar with trouble, don’t you?”
After a few more minutes of frantically going through every possible scenario, including the one where Archie leaves him for a younger Auror (
“Auror Potter, is that what I think it is?” Harry almost drops the bottle at Draco’s voice in his ear, so close he can feel the warmth of his breath tickling the curls behind his ear. Draco laughs as Harry looks at him with annoyance.
—among Muggles. If he has ever had the chance to just walk around a small English town without a purpose or a shady mission to carry out, without magic, without any obligations or threats. He can see that curious gaze linger as they pass the tiny shops, examining every oddity he spots. He can even see Malfoy’s mouth open for a short second when they pass a tiny bakery, and even Harry has to admit that the smell of pastries is nothing short of heavenly. It reminds him to make use of the credit cards he has and Malfoy watches with fascination as Harry buys a few sandwiches and a four-pack of ale at the nearest shop after looking at Malfoy in question and receiving a curt nod.
Draco put down his quill (yet another irrational fear of old reactionists, that Muggle ink would somehow make their paperwork less pompous or prominent) and folded his hands atop the next parchment in his pile. He inclined his head towards the massive, strange-looking chair displayed in front of the largest window in the study. It was one of Draco’s favourite showpieces, and possibly the luckiest find in his collection.
The man, Dmitri, jerks violently in Malfoy’s iron grip and Harry watches in horror as his face swells with blood, spit foaming at the corners of his mouth. Malfoy is panting in unrestrained fury, eyes dark like onyxes, as he steadily keeps his hold and watches his former accomplice struggle for breath. “As usual, using tacky, old tricks to get to me,” he
“And you’re wearing that cologne again,” Harry sighs, dragging his nose across Draco’s overheated skin.
“Well, I
There had been six instances Draco had deemed close ones, where Potter had the audacity to take workplace teasing to an unacceptably high level. The man’s libido seems to be more of a steady thrum of lust reverberating along his body rather than a vessel that eventually would run empty. The ‘no sex at work’ rule is more of a given than something Draco would think needed to be carved in stone and, perhaps, that’s an error in his logic alone. Gryffindors in general, and Potter specifically, apparently do not distinguish between ‘allowed’ and ‘not explicitly forbidden’.
“—and absolutely brilliant,” Draco finishes, throwing the wand away and, once again, assaulting Harry with lips, teeth, and tongue.
“You’re not taking my gun.”
“It’s all right, Archie met someone last week and they’re planning to elope!”
Harry stops what he’s doing, clenching a fist over the edge of the counter. “Don’t— Don’t fucking turn this into a joke. That doesn’t make it okay.”
“That’s right, darling,” Harry says, bending forward and over his back, kissing the knobs of his spine and slowly working his finger alongside Draco’s cock. “We’re gonna go slow, okay? Just like this.”
The head of the Department of Mysteries is terrifying when upset.
“Malfoy!”
“Thank you,” Draco says with a smirk. “And here you are, still thinking I’m evil.”
He gets dressed, snorting at Draco’s dramatic eyerolls. When Harry is finally ready to go, Draco gets up, still stark naked, and comes up to him. It’s strangely attractive to see him like that while being fully dressed, if only he didn’t seem slightly subdued, almost shy, when he speaks in a low voice. “They’re going to ask how that date went.”
They eat curry, and talk, and it’s all perfectly pleasant—Harry tells her a little about his job as well (and what a glorious topic for a first date, honestly, the modern world is a travesty) but remains unable to shake that stifling feeling in his chest, almost making him sweat. And that strange, unsafe smell gets stronger.
“Please.”
It caught Harry by surprise, the wondrous realisation that he had, in fact, become close friends with Draco. It was a fragile thing, carefully woven with stories of their lives after the War, reinforced with long-overdue apologies, and burnished with all the small things they learned about each other. It was surprisingly easy to open himself up to Draco Malfoy, of all people, and it even though it should have been shocking—how eerily similar they actually were, how well they fit together in the strangest scenarios, how the most peculiar things left his mouth when there were just the two of them, sharing pints and talking the night away—somehow it just worked. Harry’s other friends took a little longer to adapt, but then, there was the time Draco brewed a Migraine Potion for Hermione to help her get through a particularly rough case, or the time he brought a Muscle Relaxant for Ginny after hearing about her post-practice cramps. The first get-togethers which Harry insisted Draco came to were a little stilted, maybe even uncomfortable, but time worked in their favour; as did Draco’s signature Hangover Potion, which became a quick and sure way to make everyone see he meant no harm. After that, even Ron allowed himself to let out an occasional grumble that maybe Malfoy isn’t as much of an evil prat as he used to be anymore.
Hary shakes his head slowly. “I did, but I don’t know why.”
“You will leave ten minutes after me. Don’t be late,” Draco said, turning around to hide his blush.
“Well. A little over a year after you, oh-so-gloriously, vanquished Voldemort, also known as the rotten apple of my father’s eye, I was still living with Mother at the Manor. Of course, only after a thorough deep-cleaning, several Curse Breaking sessions, which cost a
“Freddie and I were playing Hungry Hippogriffs,” me mutters, blushing slightly.
He could swear he sees the corner of Malfoy’s mouth lift.
Harry palms at the rounded edges of the washer and his hands slip, unable to find any purchase. Draco notices that and, with a sinful glint in his eye, grabs Harry’s wrists and guides his hands to the back of his head, pushing down on it, beckoning Harry to take hold. Harry grabs him by the hair, pulling it hard, coaxing a delicious shiver out of him. The wet, filthy sound Draco makes when Harry pulls him off his cock could be enough to make him come, especially with how utterly
“I’ll show you later, it’s about demon hunters and I am
something so small and vulnerable, that made Harry’s eyes immediately fall shut. There was a rustle of fabric and then a fluttering sound, the softest gust of wind, and Harry actually felt warm, fragrant air shift against his face.
“Holy shit… How did you get your hands on all this?” asks Harry, looking up from the papers, already feeling he knows the answer.
Draco raises an eyebrow. “Again?” He takes slow, measured steps towards Harry, like a predator already salivating at the prey before him.
“What did you normally do there, then?” Harry can’t help but ask. He can’t really imagine Malfoy talking investment and wealth management with decrepit old men or entertaining dowagers with biscuits and tea.
Draco puts the watch away, tucking it back into the pocket of the tight waistcoat visible under his unbuttoned work robes. The golden chain glimmers in the light and for a second, Harry’s transfixed at the whole getup—the long, black robes adorned with a row of tiny onyx buttons should make Draco look like Snape, cold, dark, and… greasy. But they don’t, not even a little—he looks sleek, sharp, almost…
This time, it’s Hermione who comes to keep him company.
Malfoy’s still pacing the small space between the kitchenette and the beds, looking highly agitated, not sparing Harry a second glance.
He can feel his second orgasm getting closer as Draco’s movements turn erratic; their spit-slick lips brush against each other and Harry wants to drown in Draco’s soft sobs as he chases his release. He takes Harry’s cock in his hand and, smearing lube and precome all over its length, strokes him in time with his thrusts, the wet sound alone making Harry moan into Draco’s mouth. Draco’s shaking, his cock pulsing inside Harry, and it only takes a few more thrusts until Harry’s coming all over his stomach, a few drops reaching his chest. He whimpers in absolute bliss as Draco pushes once, twice, and then comes inside him with a wrecked, guttural moan.
It’s becoming somewhat predictable, the way Malfoy deflects any topic that’s even remotely difficult or unpleasant with innuendos and flirtations, his mask slipping on like a second skin. Harry should be annoyed but the only thing that he can think about is what happened to Malfoy over the past years to make him like that, what other bad things he had to brush off like they were nothing—that curiosity is a risky thing to entertain but Harry finds himself drawn to the man like a moth to a flame anyway.
“You’re carrying a bloody gun?” Harry breathes. “And you’re telling me this
Apparently, the letter said something about ‘their female guest’ they’ve located in the south of France, and the DMLE justifiably believes the mysterious lady has to be Narcissa. No demands were made, no warnings, no messages or threats have reached the Aurors, just a piece of clean-cut information, a crisp, chalk line added to the enemy side of the board by sheer coincidence.
“Quite the contrary,” Draco purrs, squeezing him, and then huffs in amusement. “Handsome, rich, famous
they’re quiet, only after outing Harry’s creepy opinions and nearly giving him a stroke.
Malfoy hums. “Among other things. They also renewed their interest in Mother, seeing as the business was thriving under the Aurors’ noses.”
“Harry, Draco!” Hermione, ever the mum of the group, rolls her eyes at their antics. “Honestly, it’s like your thirteen again,” she shakes her head with a fond smile.
“Hermione, I am disappointed in you,” Harry looks at her with mock scandal, unable to lace any malice into his tone. He doesn’t really mind talking about it. The ‘thinking about it before sleep’ part is the hard one.
Draco grimaces. “Really? A big, fuzzy, ginger moustache—”
“There are many potions, Potter.”
“But we can Apparate now.”
Draco just gasped and pushed back, forcing his finger deeper inside and Harry let him take over, let him take as much as Draco wanted and at that point, it wasn’t just about fingers, or kisses, or cock. It was a bit of Harry as well and he wondered what pieces would be missing when they left this bathroom and if there were places where Draco would choose to keep them.
“No,” Draco murmurs, kissing him lightly. “I just want to taste you,” he says and falters. “Oh god, you’ve turned me into a sop.”
shape of his buttocks or the roguish curl of his fringe. It’s a harrowing experience, to have the people Harry calls his friends perform alcohol-addled, dramatic readings of their favourite readers’ letters published in the
. Bloody
And Harry couldn’t speculate any longer so he kissed Draco, went in with blind desire, sucked Draco’s lower lip into his mouth and lined up their bodies and Draco was tight in and around him, returning the kiss with everything he had.
, trying not to get distracted by Malfoy’s graceful, catlike movements as he fires off spells with a sure hand and a murderous glare. They move around each other with surprising coordination, never even brushing shoulders despite being just inches away from each other. Malfoy takes a light step forward and casts a roaring Stunner, while Harry dashes around him and deflects a Disemboweling Curse charging their way. One of the Family’s men is still down and the remaining three try to flank them, shooting off curses Harry has never even heard of, though the incantations give him an idea what they do. He notices there’s barely any green lights coming out of their wands—there must be some orders to keep them alive and Harry wonders about the reason for that.
Lazy, late summer days spent with Draco were his favourite. Those were the days they didn’t go outside at all, with the usual Privacy Charms firmly in place and Cooling Charms blasting throughout the house. The air outside was heavy, sticky with heat, and the sun rays spilling into the living room bathed the space in a dreamlike golden glow, with specks of dust floating across the sharp light. Sometimes, they would cook or bake together and Harry fondly remembered the one time when instead of brownies, he ended up with a lapful of chocolate-covered Draco. He kissed and licked the warm sweetness off his lover’s damp skin, and they made love in the kitchen, and then in their bedroom, and they laughed and kissed so much, Harry felt his heart was about to burst. Sometimes, they would take a cool shower together and it always ended up longer and hotter than planned—those were the times they stayed in bed after, and took each other apart in slow, deliberate sessions, one fading into the next, like a blurred photograph film, until they both collapsed from exertion, wet, flushed, and completely worn-out.
Draco’s lips form a thin line. “I was going to say safe.”
“It’s some sort of a romance novel,” Draco says. “Nothing award-worthy, probably something old auntie Walburga kept under her pillow for a cheap thrill.”
With that one drop, Harry’s whole world came crashing down. Like a house of cards left in an empty room, collapsed by a light breeze that came in through a cracked window. Almost like the butterfly effect, only there was no butterfly—just a furious tornado of fire and brimstone destroying everything it touched and two terrified men, helpless against fate falling down on their heads. Harry put his hands on Draco’s cheeks, looking at the love of his life for maybe the last time and white-hot, burning torment tore through his chest as he kissed Draco’s forehead.
He finally grins. “Yet I still don’t believe you don’t tune in to our little wireless to listen to me wank when the night falls upon us.”
Draco opens his mouth and pauses. “Absolutely. Yes.”
, I want that, all of it. I want you
“Are you saying it doesn’t work like most magic… should? You know, intent and stuff,” Harry prods.
“And you? Still bringing Robards his coffee because he’s afraid to walk into a Starbucks?” Draco asks amusedly, opening the bag. “There are two,” he frowns. “Do you want one?” He asks, holding it out to Harry.
“This is… slower than I imagined,” Draco says after a minute, leaning forward. He watches the ground recede under their feet and Harry watches Draco’s profile, transfixed, trying to record how his cupid bow curves at his upper lip.
“Snacks don’t count, Potter,” Draco smirks.
If Draco’s referring to how touchable Harry thinks his hair looks right now, then yes, it’s as hilarious as genocide. He raises his eyebrows in question.
There are lilies. Long, graceful petals blooming from the middle of his sternum, cradled in the valley between his pectorals. One of the larger petals frames his Avada Kedavra scar—Harry’s sure there’s a metaphor somewhere in there—the tattoo wasn’t supposed to cover it, just coexist alongside it, the symbol of his mother’s love forever entangled with the mark of darkness on his body. There’s a pair of large stag antlers looming protectively over the flowers, branching out and up, their tips dipping into the hollows of his collarbones. On his left shoulder, the Canis Majoris constellation, sketched out over a figure of a large, black dog, Sirius’ star gleaming proudly at its collar. And on the right, the head of a wolf, its mouth open in a silent howl.
There’s a dangerous, playful glimmer in Draco’s eyes as he looks up for a split second and before Harry’s lust-fogged brain catches up, Draco repositions them so they’re both on their backs, Harry lying on top of Draco with his legs spread and placed on each side of Draco’s thighs.
Draco didn’t answer, still struggling to slow down his breathing, curled up in front of Harry, his fingers tangled between platinum locks.
Harry’s standing in Ron and Hermione’s living room, bouncing George and Angelina’s son, little Fred, on his hip. The little boy gurgles happily as they both watch Hermione rummage around the living room, already wearing her coat, and Ron, standing in the doorway with a passive expression.
,” he barks, petulantly pushing back.
Harry unlatched his mouth from him and admired the slightly pink blotch left in its wake, then gave it a playful lick. “Hmm?”
the delicious stretch and burn of Draco’s cock inside him. It hurts only for the first few seconds, the initial discomfort quickly dissipating.
“Potter, we don’t have time, I’ll explain it on the way,” he says firmly, his deep voice filling the small space. “He says he will only talk to you and we both know we don’t have nearly enough evidence to keep him here against his will,” he adds, bitterly.
“Please stop listing sexual activities,” Harry moans, his voice muffled.
He thinks about the Surveillance Spell and the wonders it might work if his professional morals were anything but strict, he wonders if Malfoy really puts his money where his mouth is, if the repercussions are worth the thrill—they’re not, not in Harry’s world, not when the stakes are so high. Harry has decided to be methodical about it, cautious and calculating, leaving no room for mistakes or slip-ups. It’s not about Malfoy, and definitely not about Harry—it’s about one of many attempts to fix the world, ones that sometimes feel like scrubbing a hallway with a toothbrush but still keep him sane.
“I didn’t say that.”
“Back at your office,” Harry says. “I wanted to ask but it felt— I don’t know,” he breathes. “So I didn’t ask. But I’m asking now.”
Harry’s breathing heavily, feeling some of his anger dissipate, replaced by an aching, empty space as he watches Draco wipe some of the blood with the back of his hand.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “What kind of magical?”
The response comes flying two minutes later ad Harry opens it, grinning at Draco’s neat, pointy script:
Draco frowns, looking around as he takes off his jacket and Harry gets momentarily distracted by his arms but quickly goes back to examining the bar. Just as he initially thought, all the people scattered around the bar are men of varying ages. And then Harry’s attention is drawn to a small, narrow rainbow banner hanging off one of the shelves behind the bar.
For years, the Ministry has been tracking them down, exhausting its resources to keep playing a frustrating game of cat and mouse. They were smarter than Voldemort’s lot—taking cruel, mindless bloodlust out of the equation has left more space for calculated risks, politics, and clever manoeuvres that required brains rather than brawn. The latter were either dead or locked up in Azkaban so the former could rise to the surface, with full vaults and a
To Harry’s puzzlement, they both ended up in St. Mungo’s. But while Harry woke up in the Spell Damage wing, Draco was nowhere to be found. According to the reluctant Healers, Draco was placed on the first floor, in the Creature-Induced Injuries ward. Harry sneaked out there as soon as the staff had started their rounds and found Draco alive and well, albeit slightly uncomfortable and extremely cagey as to the reason for his particular placement.
The fact that they don’t talk about that night doesn’t mean either of them forgot about what happened.
For some unfathomable reason, Harry likes having that secret small
He stands there, staring at the Portkey, feeling his magic vibrate inside him with a raw need to get into action, to help, and to do something.
With a pounding heart, Draco lifted his hand to cup Harry’s face and something unfurled beneath his ribs when Harry leaned into the touch. “I’m thinking about it right now,” he whispered.
“He’s cheating on her. Well, trying to, at least,” Harry shrugged.
And then, he finally claims Draco’s mouth.
In the end, he has to cast three more times until the Diagnostic Charm doesn’t find any signs of lingering fracture. Healing complete, Harry curses the two brutes to the fiery pits of hell for making a sport out of beating virtually defenceless people bloody. He briefly wonders if Malfoy considered using his gun at the time but stifles the thought—it’s neither important nor relevant, and untangling Malfoy’s veiled motivations can only result in a headache and a deep-seated need to knock back a tumbler of whiskey.
Teddy turns around to face him and stares into his eyes, his face a picture of complete bliss, eyes fogged over, lips saliva-slick and slightly open. Harry pulls him in by the neck and licks into that sweet mouth, smiling into the kiss as Teddy shivers under his touch.
The tense silence that fell upon the room would have been disconcerting if it weren’t for the delicious little flush slowly taking over Potter’s face. It made his freckles stand out and something stirred in Draco’s stomach. Seeing Potter’s questioning glance, he continued.
“Are you sure?” Draco whispered, moving down to his neck and tracing the tendons with his mouth.
slow down, don’t wanna come yet, I want to suck you.”
“How is firing people fun?” Harry asks instead of answering but decides to indulge him anyway. “Also, they don’t think of us like that—”
Their good morning kiss turns into a full-on snogging session full of soft laughs, warm lips and roaming hands. It doesn’t go any further than that, for now—the initial urgency has been sated, the overwhelming need to have each other
sex with Harry Potter.
“Uh, well.” Ron looks a little troubled, scratching his head thoughtfully. “She was, uh, supposed to come but we’ve sort of made her leave her niece’s birthday so it might… take some time.”
An older Auror walks out of a frosted glass door with a ‘Head Auror’ sign, carrying a specific air of authority that immediately feels imposed rather than earned. The corner of the stranger’s mouth twitches imperceptibly as he stands by the entrance on the opposite side of the large room. Calm and collected, he patiently waits to be acknowledged although he is not one who likes to wait, nor has he ever gone unnoticed for so long.
“We’ve noticed,” Ginny says calmly, smirking like a true Harpy.
“They got to our floor and started casting without warning as soon as they stumbled upon some Aurors,” Robards pipes in, just having arrived at the scene.
Draco stares at his hands with hunger and Harry bites his lip, feeling the low thrum of the Glamour Spells over his skin. His heart is racing, strangely terrified of what he’s about to do and it shouldn’t be a big deal—it feels
Draco pulls the trigger.
“Then congratulations are in order, I knew you could manage it without any bloodshed,” Draco inclines his head and proceeds to bite into his brioche with a satisfied groan (
“You’re all awful,” Hermione cuts in, shaking her head in admonishment.
. And now,” he crosses his arms, “you will excuse me.”
“You better start talking,” Harry whispers, dangerously calm.
Daniel is courteous and polite, funny and smart, and the man seems like he hasn’t got a single mean bone in his body. He’s fully engaged in the conversation, opens doors for him and even compliments his looks, even though Harry knows his hair is a disaster and there are shadows under his eyes that make him look like a Werewolf after a full moon. Daniel is, in fact, so nice, he doesn’t even comment on Harry’s terrible dish choice, laughs at every single one of his jokes—even if Harry himself cringes inwardly at a thing or two he says—and doesn’t bat an eyelash when Harry asks for a beer instead of wine.
“He wasn’t very good to begin with,” Harry shrugged, “so it’s not too big of a loss, really.”
, you’re giving me a headache. It won’t make it better Potter, knowing what your Amortentia smells like, and I’m speaking from experience,” he finishes, dropping his hands. Harry tries to unscramble his thoughts, knowing deep down Draco has a point and it’s actually annoying, how well he sees right through him and why he doesn’t want to let Harry smell it.
Harry walks around the table and comes up behind Malfoy—it’s the closest they’ve been since he came in here and Harry now knows Malfoy smells like almonds. It’s a sweet, milky aroma and it’s so out of character, he wonders if Malfoy is aware of it at all. Harry unhooks a pair of handcuffs from his belt and gathers Malfoy’s hands behind his back, feeling him shudder at the touch of cold metal around his wrists.
She told him that deep inside, she had known all along she was interested in dating women but once she had a little time to herself, she had come to terms with the fact that she was
They both started, hiding their eyes in the crook of the other’s neck as a blinding light illuminated the room, casting long, sinister shadows across the floor and over the walls, and for a moment, Draco’s hair looked almost angelic—strikingly white and bright as he hid his face in the cradle of Harry’s shoulders. Harry could swear he heard a whimper but Draco didn’t falter, brought his hands up and pressed their foreheads together, tangling his long fingers in Harry’s hair so hard it hurt, and Harry didn’t dare make a sound, trying to focus on that sensation and compress it in his mind so it was the only thing he could feel. Draco abruptly moved away and walked to a small cupboard in the corner of the room to open one of the drawers for some reason, and Harry wildly tried to register the way his arched feet dipped into the thick, green carpet. He followed Draco’s every move and fought against the
“I’m not—”
“Oh, come here, love,” Ron pulls her into his arms and kisses the top of her head. “We’ll find the perfect cake, I promise.”
Harry brushes his hand up and down his toned stomach, slightly grazing the tip of his cock on every downstroke. “You feel so good, Draco, oh my god, so—tight—” He kisses all over his shoulders, the knobs of his spine, noses at the wet hairs sticking to his neck, muttering nonsense against flushed skin.
Draco was quiet and pensive and suddenly looked very small, nursing an empty whiskey glass and swirling the last amber drop around its bottom.
“Harry!”
Nobody questions his behaviour, though, as he slowly walks up to the reception desk where a bored witch sifts through the latest edition of
“I have to ask,” she whispers.
“It’s protocol,” he explains tiredly. “You’re a potential witness and we have reason to believe your life was in danger. You’re now under my protection and tomorrow, we’ll find out what happens next. Until then”—Harry shrugs, mouth curved into a sour line—“we wait.”
“Fuck! Yes, right there,” Harry gasped, swallowing air in large gulps, still clutching Draco’s neck. “How do you do that—” he moaned, clenching around him, “every fucking time,” and Draco let out a strained laugh and canted his hips back, and forwards again, setting a lazy, dragging rhythm, leaning over Harry to catch his lips.
Bringing a hand between their bodies, he takes hold of Draco’s neglected cock and wastes no time in pulling him off. He speeds up his thrusts, the steady rhythm turning erratic with how much he needs this. His orgasm is close, swirling in the depths of his gut and threatening to rip itself out. Draco’s quiet tells him he’s right there too, so close that nothing is coming out of his parted lips but soft gasps and small whimpers.
“You left this at the wedding,” his voice calls from the drawing-room doorway, shocking Harry out of his wallowing. He turns to see Draco dropping his robe over the arm of the sofa, pouting slightly. “You left me, too.”
He sees the moment she gets it, the same pitying look her brother gave him earlier taking over her face. If there were a way for him to erase his entire existence, he thinks now would be a good time to take it.
He does. Hand clenching Harry’s hair, he comes between them, back arching and legs tightening their hold on Harry. It doesn’t take long for Harry to follow, pressing their damp foreheads together as his orgasm takes hold. They stay like that, breathing heavily and clutching each other like the world will end if they ease their grips, until they have no choice but to move; arms tired and muscles sore.
A cold breeze hits Harry then and he’s reminded that his robes are somewhere in the tent, discarded on the back of a chair. The plain white button-up shirt he’s wearing does little to protect from the cold that shouldn’t even be making it past the charms in place. From the challenging look on Draco’s face, it’s not hard to deduce that he’s fucking around with the spells.
“Maybe it is,” Draco replies, still pulling himself off with no real effort, with clearly no intention of coming like that. Harry’s own cock lays neglected between them, hard. Draco’s eyes flick to it.
. They had all cried a little that night.
The blond man nods, removing himself from Harry’s lap—much to Harry’s disappointment—and standing up. Harry follows, nearly stumbling when he does so. He grins at Draco sheepishly.
“Uncle Harry,” she greets, attempting to whisper but miserably failing. He misses the ‘Hawwy’ phase that she grew out of far quicker than most children. He’s holding out hope for Hugo.
Blaise starts cackling. A full-bodied, booming laugh that echoes across the field. It’s bordering on manic, a far cry from his usual indifferent demeanour, Harry turns his head to look at him.
They grin at each other, Draco's hand still in his. This is it, he thinks. Happiness.
“That just means Molly’s an angel, not that he’s in love with me,” he counters.
His thrusts falter for a moment, stunned. Cock twitching, he brings up the pace, the grip he has on Draco’s thigh tightening. “Fuck,” he bites out, punctuating the word with a particularly sharp thrust that just misses the bundle of nerves they both want him to hit. “Say it again,” he demands.
The sheer
He drops Draco’s hand to open the door and push it open. Something in the air is different when they walk in together, like the house knows that everything is changing whether they like it or not.
All it takes, in the end, is a challenging look. One raised eyebrow and his lover is moving, taking hold of it himself in both of his dainty hands. They both groan at the contact, a week without touching feeling more like a year. He isn’t using his mouth yet, just pulling him off agonizingly slow, and already he feels like he could come undone any second. It’s pathetic, really.
It’s been over a week since he’s seen Draco. It’s unusual for them to spend so much time apart, their dependency on each other something they do not talk about but is present nonetheless. The work trip the other man had been called on was unexpected and almost resulted in Draco being unable to attend the wedding, which was devastating to all of them. Draco and Ginny’s friendship is one Harry will never fully understand but is ultimately grateful for. She’d marched straight to the Minister herself and refused to leave his office until he agreed to shorten the trip. Knowing Kingsley, Harry would have paid to see that. Luckily, it worked.
Maybe denial is the best way out of this. “Looking like what?” He questions, all faux innocence.
“I mean it more every time,” he grins, squinting one eye open to look up at the man. Draco is looking down at him fondly, far fonder than he normally allows himself to be caught looking.
“I don’t—“
“Wanker,” Draco exhales on a moan and takes the head into his mouth without warning. He wastes no time, running his tongue under the tip just how Harry likes it, making him gasp. He was made for this, Harry thinks. For him.
“Don’t be silly uncle Harry, you love us lots and lots,” Rose says very matter-of-factly. His heart clenches right as Draco’s face drops, he catches the sour expression before the man quickly masks it. Well, isn’t that fucking great.
Lips against the blond’s sweat-damp temple, he whispers into the skin. “All good?”
“How long?”
Ginny is due to walk down the aisle any minute. Harry’s trying hard not to search for grey eyes amongst the rows of people.
like Draco, his warm vanilla-based cologne clinging to everything. The Slytherin’s flat, in comparison, is almost bare, a lifeless shell of a home that smells more of dust than it does anything else.
“You told Granger and Weasley,” he points out.
Draco sighs, looking down on him with something like pity shining in his tired eyes. “You deserve more than this—than me.”
Draco nods, and they go. Hand in hand.
with everyone he holds dear just a piece of fabric away.
“No,” he stops him, needing to get this out in the open. “Let me just—let me say this. I’ve been trying to find the courage to ask you this whole trip and I just kept putting it off because I wanted it to be perfect. Wanted it to be good enough for you. But this—here—
“But—“
With a tired sigh, he turns over and closes his eyes. They’ve been here so many times but it doesn’t feel any easier tonight, in fact, it feels much much worse.
“Thank you, Rosie,” he ruffles her curls gently. “Now, everyone, I don’t think you need to do another toast or you’ll all be too drunk to get on the dancefloor—but give it up for the beautiful brides!”
It feels like he’s spoken to half the wizarding world in the past few hours. Conversations ranging from a short ‘hello, missed you!’ to long one-sided discussions about the great-great-grandchildren of people he’d never met before today. It’s no wonder he’s tired.
“What is it?”
Draco shifts, just slightly, fingers twitching like he’s stopping himself from doing something. Harry tracks every slight movement, every breath, like a sceptic watching a magician. “Is there something you’re trying to say here, Harry?” He asks, using the name like a weapon.
“You set the rules,” Harry cuts in.
Somewhere along the way he had fallen in love and in doing so, had broken the one rule he knew he couldn’t come back from. As quickly as he realised, he decided that he must never dare speak it. He resigned himself to loving Draco in silence.
He bought the ring around a month after they worked everything out, knowing it was far too soon and yet unable to stop himself. Multiple times since then, he’s considered asking. Every single time he chickens out.
“I didn’t say anything,” he replies with faux innocence. “Anyway, I’m not sure how smart you think Rose is but I assure you she’s not that smart.”
Draco scoffs. “I’m not sure we’re friends now, Potter.”
“Mm?” His fingers are tracing over Harry’s scar, something Harry would kill anyone else for daring to do. It’s okay when it’s Draco, the touch is always nothing but completely tender. Somehow it wipes away every bad memory that’s etched into every jagged branch of the scar, even if just for a moment.
“Go on then,” Draco gives in. “Spit it out.”
Until now.
The kitchen comes into view far sooner than he’s prepared for. The door wide open, the soft glow of the lamplight spills into the hallway. He stands in the doorway and takes in the scene before him, heart aching and deeply confused.
Harry frowns. Quickly, he dismisses Kreacher with a nod and dives out of bed so fast he nearly trips. He pulls on some boxers and an old, worn t-shirt before leaving the room and making his way down to the kitchen.
Pressing a kiss to the top of his head, Harry ponders how to word this. “That night, why did you come to me?”
Blaise snorts. “As much as I’d love to, I think that’s your job,” the way he says it is oddly gentle, as if he’s worried he might scare him. “You should do it. Soon—before it’s too late.”
“I—uh—this isn’t how I planned to do this,” he says, frightened. He can’t risk this going wrong, can’t lose Draco.
Harry isn’t sure Draco really has that many. They walk through the old house together, not saying another word. Through the long hallways, up the creaking staircases and past all the rooms filled with things Harry can’t bear to look at until they reach the room at the furthest end of the hall on the second floor. Harry’s bedroom.
Draco hasn’t noticed him standing there. He doesn’t think Draco is capable of noticing anything right now that isn’t the half-written letter in front of him. Harry is terrified.
“Do I have to do all the work myself?” Draco calls to him, raising an eyebrow.
Lost in thought, when he finally locks back in on their conversation, Hugo is babbling away about something Harry can’t keep up with. Draco seems to understand.
He’s not sure what time it is, only that he is alone. Blinking awake and letting his tired eyes adjust, he notices the neon red numbers on the dusty alarm clock. 5 am.
Kissing Draco Malfoy is a thought that has crossed his mind a million times. He’s imagined it so many different ways over the years he’s lost count. He thought he’d crack at some point; maybe during sex, maybe when they’re eating breakfast together in the kitchen, in their own little world, maybe ten years down the line when he’s tired of waiting. In weaker moments, he imagines himself walking up to Draco in front of everyone and kissing him with no care for the consequences. What he never saw coming was Draco making the first move, on a cold winter’s night, at his
“Always,” Draco says with a warm smile, something unreadable in his eyes.
Thrusting at a steady pace, their intermingled sounds of pleasure fill the room; Harry’s stuttered breaths and overwhelmed ‘
They don’t stop until they’re out of the main tent and standing in the entrance. It’s not an overly large entrance and besides a carpet and two floating lamps to illuminate the space, it’s bare. The way they came through is closed to the main tent, a heavy curtain between them and everyone else. The mouth of the entrance is open, the snow-covered field outside on full display. Even with the music slipping through the cracks in the curtain, it’s oddly peaceful.
Kreacher seems pained for a second, almost as if he doesn’t want to betray Draco. There’s always been an odd relationship there, Draco’s blood ties to the family meaning that the elf frequently has to stop himself from looking to him rather than Harry. It amuses them both.
“I don’t do that,” the redhead woman interrupts, making everyone laugh. She absolutely does do that, has almost caught Draco in his bed multiple times doing it. He’s had to change his wards countless times over the years.
“Oh really?” Draco replies, strained.
He’s sure there will be moments in his future that will outshine this one. When they finally say their vows, the love they feel channelled into the bonds forever tied into their cores. The birth of their first child, whenever that may come. Seeing that child flourish, being able to give them the childhood that neither he nor Draco got. One filled with an abundance of love and safety, no looming darkness waiting to pounce; at least not any they can’t face together. He’s sure there’s so much more for them, happiness they can’t even fathom. For now, though, this is more than he ever thought himself worthy of.
“Always look so good like this,” he whispers into the small room, guiding Draco’s head further down with no resistance. “Beautiful.”
Ginny’s grin, impossibly, grows wider. She looks up and down Draco’s frame in a way that makes Harry want to step in front of him and shield him from her scrutiny. He doesn’t move.
“Okay love,” he all but whispers. “One more hour, then we’ll leave. They’ll all be too drunk to care by then. Is that okay? We can leave now if you want—I’ll deal with Ginny hexing my balls off.”
“Now who’s staring?” He questions lightly, pulling Draco against him and wrapping his arms around his middle.
He honestly thinks he could kiss him in this broom closet forever, but Draco seems to be on a mission all of his own.
Hermione walks in first, holding Rose’s tiny little hand in hers. She’s three now—almost four as she likes to remind everyone any chance she can get—and she’s the sweetest child. Dressed in the most adorable poofy white dress, small blue butterflies scattered across it and pinned into her curls, she has everyone cooing over her the moment they spot her. Hermione herself looks radiant, deep blue dress with off the shoulder sleeves complimenting her dark skin tone beautifully. They walk down the aisle together and Harry smiles as Rose runs from her mother’s side and into his arms. He lifts her up and balances her weight on his hip as everyone laughs at her antics, utterly charmed by her as they should be.
Draco just smiles, a teasing smile he’s seen a thousand times before. A smile he could close his eyes and paint without missing a single detail. “No, you don’t.”
Draco shakes his head, smiling as if his boyfriend is the biggest idiot in the world. Which, Harry concedes, probably isn’t far off.
Eventually, much the same as all the other times, they fell back together so suddenly that Harry can’t remember how it happened. One slip up, one drunken night and it was almost as if nothing had ever happened. Almost. A tiny friction remained, some unspoken regret in Draco’s eyes that Harry had to turn away from lest he get consumed by the pain of it.
“So fucking beautiful,” he says again, unable to stop himself. He finds that he’s never meant anything more in his life. Draco is always beautiful, always the most breathtaking person in a room, but here underneath him in this bed, he looks touched by the gods. They’re so close, almost every inch of them pressed against each other, and yet he’s never felt so out of reach. Harry is wholly unworthy of being allowed the privilege of seeing Draco like this.
“Close,” he grunts. “You going to take it?”
The third time he broke a rule, it took him four years to realise. Four whole years of them falling in and out of various beds with each other and finally,
Draco moans. “Harry,” he says again, the name sounding so unbelievably right coming from his lips. “More—please, right there.”
heart?” He says, incredulous.
Quickly, they’re down to their underwear. Harry’s already hard, he finds. He grips his clothed erection, desperate for some friction. Draco tracks the movement, licking his lips.
“You’re drunk,” is all he can say, frankly too astounded to come up with anything else. What the fuck is he going on about? The thought of Draco being in love with him is more absurd than the thought of Arthur in fishnets.
His eyes flicker towards Harry and
“He’s very good!” Rose exclaims, making everyone coo.
It makes him flinch. “Don’t do that,” he responds, teetering on the edge of pleading. “I’d rather you call me nothing at all.”
“It’s nothing,” Draco interrupts quickly, a frantic edge to his voice that makes Harry freeze.
Rose shakes her head, curls bouncing. “Both mummy and daddy said it was okay because you are one,” she beams.
It’s a game. It’s all a fucking game, it’s what they
“What are you doing?” Harry probes again, not backing down but also not daring to make the move into the room, teetering on the edge of the step.
He’s standing above Harry now, looking down at him in the chair. It doesn’t feel like part of the game anymore. “You’re a bigger fool than I thought, Malfoy, if that’s what you think I mean,” he contends, not breaking eye contact with the man.
When Draco grows restless beneath him, needing more, he moves. One big hand clutching the blond’s thigh, one on his waist, he pulls out just slightly before pushing back in; testing the waters. Draco gasps. Reassured, he does it again, this time driving in deeper.
Harry laughs, pulling her into a one-armed cuddle, bringing Hugo in on the other side. Pressing a kiss to both of their heads in turn, he smiles to himself.
Frantic apologies and a discreet spell later they’d made their way home, Harry wondering when Draco had become fluent in French.
Nearly everyone around them is married at this point. They’ve been to so many weddings, together but not together, in the past year that Harry thinks he might be sick of champagne. It only gets weirder and weirder for him to see people around them move on with their lives whilst he’s stuck in place.
Harry’s floored, gripping on to the back of a chair to stop himself from falling over. A goodbye? He doesn’t understand. He’s almost too afraid to ask. Wonders if maybe things will be different if he pretends he didn’t hear it. He contemplates turning around and leaving the room, going back to bed and hoping Draco will be there when he wakes up. He knows, however, that it’s futile.
“He’s in the kitchen, Master Potter. Making a mess.”
He once again doesn’t get an answer. A hand grips his bicep and suddenly the world is turning and he lands on his feet in what seems to be a broom closet, a very smug Draco pressed against him. He hates this man.
Rolling his eyes at the mothering tone, he squeezes his thigh reassuringly. “I’m perfectly fine. Just content. Plus it’s not like we’ve been sleeping very early,” he reminds him, taking complete joy in the flush that appears on his face.
“Git,” Hugo echoes.
Instantly, he opens them, accepting the two fingers Harry presses in. He moans around them, running his tongue over the digits eagerly. Harry loves that he gets to see him like this, so uncharacteristically submissive. The image of someone else in his place is one he can’t bear to envision. Begrudgingly he pulls the spit-soaked fingers out and moves his hand down their entwined bodies, lifting himself up a little so he can reach between them to wrap his hand around both of their cocks, both of them moaning at the contact.
“Yep,” He confirms, shaking off the urge to grab the man by his tie and break all the rules. “All mine, Salazar Slytherin can go fuck himself.”
There’s laughter and a few hoots—he suspects from the Weasley brothers—as he stands up, clearing his throat awkwardly. He wordlessly casts the same sonorus charm everyone else cast to help their voices reach the back of the long tent. “As everyone who was subjected to my victory speeches after the war will know, I’m not the best at public speaking,” he starts with a self-deprecating chuckle.
“Excuse me?” The tone of the words is somewhere between confusion and fear.
“Hello little one,” he says with a kiss to her cheek, making her grin wide. “You look beautiful.”
There’s no move to pull off, which is all the answer he needs. A few erratic thrusts later, he’s coming into Draco’s mouth with a shout. He swallows it all.
He gets an eager nod in reply, laughing as he almost gets headbutted in the process. They stay like that for a while, Harry fucking him slowly with his fingers—trying to prepare him. Draco revels in it, whimpering little moans falling past his parted lips. They exchange lazy kisses, a soft sort of heat behind them. He wants more, his cock aching to replace his fingers, but hurting Draco is not an option.
He waits.
“Of course not,” he rolls his eyes. “Anyway, as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted—love, it’s bloody weird and messy and sometimes I wonder how it’s worth the hassle but then I see the two of you and it all makes sense. You wake up and choose to love each other no matter how hard it gets and I could only hope to have half the relationship you share one day.” It’s taking all of his willpower not to seek out Draco’s stormy eyes right now. He needs to stay on track, lest he starts waxing poetic about bloody ferrets.
He spends more of the ceremony than he’d like to admit looking over at Draco. At one point, Hermione sends a very discreet stinging jinx at him when he’s caught staring for too long. His surprised yelp almost sends Ron into hysterics.
“That’s not true.”
It doesn’t take long at all. Knowing that Draco is going to be unbearably smug about it, he groans in both pleasure and annoyance when he feels the impending orgasm.
Harry laughs. “Thought you might be used to it by now,” he retorts, sitting himself down on the swing next to Draco, a hand immediately finding its place on the other man’s thigh.
The confusion is creeping back in. “That’s what this is—right?”
“You don’t understand.”
“I—please go, Harry,” he’s pleading, voice cracking on his name. Harry steps into the room, moving to hover at the end of the table. The floor is cold against his bare feet.
“Uncle Harry! Uncle Harry, wake up!”
“Says the one who apparated us in here because you’re a needy little slut who can’t wait an hour or two,” he bites back, smirking at how Draco’s eyes glaze over at that. It’s not too far, never too far after all this time learning every single secret shame they both hold. He knows what the Slytherin man wants better than anyone ever could.
“Uncle Harry. Uncle Draco,” she says very seriously with an adorably formal nod to them both in turn. He catches Draco’s fond smile out of the corner of his eye.
He tugs Draco’s lip between his teeth, mind reeling at the soft gasp it elicits. He’s angry and tired and so in love that it hurts but none of that matters now. All that matters is them.
“One of my biggest regrets in life will forever be missing out on seeing that for myself, pensieve memories just don’t do it justice,” Harry says with a laugh. “I’m so glad it worked out though, I’m so glad you survived all the dramas that come with planning a wedding this beautiful and made it here. I love you both a lot, I wish you many years of happiness and offer my services if you ever need a babysitter in the future,” he adds on with a wink.
Blaise Zabini, of all people, is not who he expected to have rescued him from his own mind. They’re friendly, for the most part. There has always been an underlying tension though, something that he’s always assumed was to do with Draco.
“You want me?”
“I thought it might be easier this way.”
Guilt washes through him at the thought of abandoning his family all because he can’t keep his emotions in check, though logically he knows they’ll forgive him. He wonders what Draco’s thinking, if he’s wondering why he left, if some part of him knows that it’s all hurtling south.
“Of course I know, Potter. Likely before you did,” he says cryptically and Harry can’t decipher what
It hits him, suddenly, what Draco had said before he walked away.
They’ve been here for a week now and it’s been wonderful. Days have been spent doing nothing but eating, sleeping and playing on the beach. He may have been sleeping more than he intended.
Everyone’s up and moving about now as the tables are pushed further towards the edges of the tent to make room on the dancefloor. Harry doesn’t move, just stays in his spot at the head table and watches everyone moving around.
“We know!” George heckles from the crowd, causing a ripple of laughter to break out. Harry grins.
Harry huffs out a startled laugh. Thinking about it, she probably will. "I vote we elope," is what he says in reply.
“There’s no need to say anything, Harry,” he says, the appeasing smile on his face a jarring contrast to the whites of his knuckles and the strange sadness in his eyes. “I’ll come find you in an hour.”
“I’ll give you half an hour or so, I won’t let him leave any earlier than that—though I’m sure he’s going feral in there looking for you.”
“Where is Draco?” He asks him, sitting up in the bed and covering his naked body with the sheets.
Draco groans. They’ve been eating healthy all week, Hermione—newly on a health kick—insisting that she cooks every meal. Harry thinks Ron might be bringing out the divorce papers if someone doesn’t take over soon. “I’m going to kill her if I have to eat kale one more time,” Draco declares, probably not exaggerating.
After that fateful night, the tension between them at work had lessened. Gone were the spiteful looks and in their place only confused warmth and the occasional teasing banter. They never really delved all that deep into anything, only ever teetering on the edge of polite conversation and something more.
He doesn’t think it’s going to happen.
“Hermione loved you back,” he says as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world. Their situations are so vastly different, if Ron can’t understand that then he thinks all hope might be lost.
Draco had apparated home to his rarely used flat in London last night, meaning that they hadn’t had the chance to see each other. Harry had been stuck with Luna and her half of the bridesmaids, spending the evening consoling her as her unbothered facade finally shattered and the wedding jitters poured out.
He gets out of bed himself, pulling a shirt on over the shorts he slept in before following them out of the bedroom. It’s quite a big house, all one story and very open and airy. There’s laughter coming from down the hall, presumably from the huge open plan kitchen-living room. He’s proven right when Rose and Hugo run away from him and into the room at the end of the long hall.
They sort themselves out in silence, Draco attempting to fix the mess Harry made of his hair and Harry frantically fixing the tie that had been completely undone by the other man’s nimble fingers.
“If you’re going to fuck me then fuck me,” he whines with an undignified pout. Harry laughs and pecks his puckered lips.
Smiling politely, he places a hand on the small of Draco’s back. “Do you mind if I borrow Draco for a moment? We have something to discuss.”
He’s not sure what he’s going to walk into. Making a mess isn’t something he thought Draco capable of, the man barely able to stand being around Harry when he’s at his most disorganised. The house is quiet as he walks through the halls. It feels sad, almost, like it knows something is wrong and that only furthers Harry’s growing discomfort. The walls breathe a heavy sigh, the magic in them that feels so tied to him—to them—fizzing with
Draco gives a disgruntled
Draco climbs onto the bed, laying himself in the middle of it. His pale skin against the white sheets is a striking image and all Harry can do is stand there at the end of the bed, looking at the way his hair fans across the pillow. He’s sliding a hand down his own body, keeping an eye on Harry to make sure he doesn’t look away, and taking a hold of his own prick. It’s not as thick as Harry’s, but long and flushed and looks far too tempting in Draco’s slowly moving fist.
Draco is sitting at the long table, only the light above him lit. He’s wearing Harry’s favourite jumper, a deep red one Molly knitted for him a few years ago. It’s the only one Draco ever steals. There are pieces of parchment strewn all over the table; some crumpled, some completely blank and untouched and some ripped into tiny flakes and sprinkled across the surface like fresh snow. The Slytherin is hunched over a fresh piece, writing almost frantically. Smudges of ink mar his perfect skin, the quill looking like it might snap from the force of Draco’s grip on it. Harry can’t see what’s being written, only that the handwriting looks nothing like his usual well-practised looping scrawl.
“You know?”
Draco looks hurt by that. Harry doesn’t think that’s very fair, given that it’s his heart that’s about to shatter. The quill previously clenched in Draco’s fist drops to the table, ink splashing onto the wood. He crosses his arms and Harry has to fight everything in him not to find it endearing.
“You’re suggesting I should panic?”
He realises just how wrong he was when two days later, Harry receives an owl.
His love for all things dainty and old once again proved to be so much more than a wealthy man’s foible when he reached into the hidden compartment in his bed’s headboard (Italian, carved walnut, made in the thirties), fishing out a small bottle of lube. A small bottle for small emergencies which was laughable, considering how completely and utterly gone Draco was.
“Mate. I get to eat cake all day,” Ron says sagely, although there’s a happy little glint in his blue eyes. “I was supposed to eat cake next week, I find out I get to eat cake today. It’s a good day,” he nods as if confirming it in his heart. “Besides, ‘Mione needs a calming presence.”
,” he says, pulling out the revolver, making Harry’s every muscle tense into alert, “is a classic Smith & Wesson .44 revolver.” Harry watches, stunned into silence, as Malfoy expertly empties the cylinder, one bullet after another neatly falling into his cupped hand. “Six and a half inches, and I’m sure there’s a penis joke here somewhere.”
“Having a blast, are we?” he growls, not caring he’s holding Draco by the front of his shirt, snarling at him like a rabid dog.
As soon he tunes into the spell, his knees buckle under him and Harry’s assaulted with a ragged, breathy sound. He stands there, paralysed, with his forehead against the cool wall, feeling his arousal mount as he listens to Draco, just a few feet away, letting out a low moan. And then, Harry is ruined.
“How do you reverse that thing?” Harry asks, looking into the man’s black, beady eyes.
Draco
Harry keeps whispering praise into Teddy’s ear. “Gorgeous. Oh,
Careful not to wake Draco up, Harry shifts a little and winces—a certain place on his body is slightly sorer now than it was last night and although he didn’t expect to feel it in the morning, Harry bites his lip, thinking about what happened. He looks down at Draco’s peaceful face and something warm and tranquil floods Harry’s chest at the sight—Draco’s slightly parted lips, a trail of purplish lovebites going down his neck and disappearing under the covers, his pale eyelashes gleaming in the sunlight like the lightest of feathers. Harry feels him breathe as Draco lies flush against him, feels his slender fingers lightly resting against his ribs. Burying his nose in those silvery locks, Harry inhales the familiar, calming scent of lemon and sage and smiles into Draco’s hair, thinking how unbelievably lucky he is.
Harry watches Draco’s tongue dart out to lick his lips and feels a rush of adrenaline go down his back. Their age-old rivalry has always made him reckless and impulsive; from time to time, they would half-consciously slip back into it and Harry revels in those moments, now even more exhilarating than back at school. Seeing that dangerous sparkle in Draco’s quicksilver eyes, the faint flush colouring his cheeks, sometimes a stray lock of blond hair falling over his forehead, and knowing that this time, it’s all in good spirits, just to make things interesting, just to spur Harry on a little… It’s intoxicating, it feeds the lion slumbering inside him to the point where all he wants to do is to grab the front of Draco’s shirt and slam him against the nearest wall. He never does, obviously—he rarely allows himself to think what Draco would do right then, whether it would put out the fire in his eyes or make it roar anew, awaken something in Draco as well, and where they would go from there.
“And then, I’ll take my turn, hard and fast,” Draco whispers and pulls out. He lightly slaps Teddy’s underside, cups his balls, and Teddy’s eyes roll back. Harry grabs him by the chin and wipes the tears from the corners of his eyes.
Draco nudges him a little with his shoulder. “There are… no potions for that.”
“Malfoy, we’re going to need a place to stay, I’m not waiting outside—”
“But I’m getting off track, apologies. What I’m trying to tell you—while you can
“I bet,” Ron huffs. “But at least something good came out of it.”
“No,” Harry says immediately, feeling a fierce protectiveness creep under his skin. “I’m not hiding this. You. Us.” He cups Draco’s cheek with one hand. “How many times do I have to say I love you until you believe me?” Draco opens his mouth and Harry continues quietly. “As long as it’s okay with you, we’re telling them.”
There’s a heartbeat of silence, like a slow-motion action film unfolding, and then both sides start bombarding their opponents with a hail of curses. Harry instinctively casts a powerful
is not the word I would use, no,” Malfoy says in a bored tone. “I’m either going to get killed, go to Azkaban, or be stuck with you for the foreseeable future,” he lists, extending three fingers. “And honestly, at this point, I don’t know which is worse.”
“I’m here, love, I’m here,” he murmured frantically, holding on to Draco’s shirt and breathing in the smell of his hair—it didn’t bring him the usual comfort but it was grounding enough Harry could clear his mind to fully realise the hopelessness of their situation.
Thank you so, so much for reading! Please come and scream at me in the comments if you liked the story! You can also say hi on
When Potter finally takes them both into his hand, Draco has to muffle his shout at the crook of Potter’s neck, the slip and slide so earth-shatteringly perfect it’s making his ears ring. They begin to move together, breathing in and out, the thin air exchanged between them making Draco dizzy.
“Go on, then.”
Slowly, he reached out to run his hand down the edge of the left wing, from the joint to the tips of the primaries, and the wing recoiled with a flutter as Draco let out a choked sound.
The second Harry moves to draw his wand, Robards spins around and casts an
Harry turns around with a flourish, swings his arm, and all air leaves him as he punches Draco square in the jaw with a particularly mean right hook. Draco stumbles once again, and Harry swears he sees a drop of blood splatter off to the side when he throws the punch. His suspicions are confirmed when Draco straightens and there’s a narrow trickle of bright-red blood at the corner of his mouth.
“I suppose it does have a certain panache, doesn’t it?” Malfoy says with a chuckle. “Also, my hair looks
“Fucking hell,” Ron says, shaking his head. “I almost never text, hate those tiny buttons, I’m used to the Floo.”
“I don’t know,” Harry shrugs. “On one hand, he brought in all that evidence—we might need his testimony if it checks out.” Ron scoffs at that, casting a small
Harry kisses him and he wants to laugh like a maniac. “I know.”
Malfoy’s face is flushed with agitation even from a distance. “Blaise, trust me when I say this, Potter is the only good one in a basket of spoiled eggs. He’s— He’s different. That’s why I went to him.”
Ron [13:29]
Harry chokes on his own saliva, causing Draco to burst out laughing and hit him on the back a few times, to Ron and Hermione’s obvious amusement.
“And?” Harry whispers.
“Why are you giving me this now? Why
“Yes, long time no see, and all that,” Malfoy says urgently. “But I’m serious, Blaise, how?”
Draco looks him up and down. “Tell you what,” he says, tapping a finger against his lower lip. “You want something from me, but I want something in return.”
“It’s not a toy, Malfoy, it’s a gun!” Harry says incredulously. “Why do you even need it?”
Draco rolled his eyes and crossed his arms. “Your hair is in a permanent state of disarray, you’re fine. I couldn’t mess it up more if I wanted to.”
what good old Voldy was doing. They needed business partners—people who came smelling an opportunity and stayed for the profits. Unmistakable, hard,
Harry thanks all the deities he can name for having the foresight to cast a Glamour and simultaneously asks himself what exactly Luna was thinking when she set this up. This Archibald man must have been running from the Great Fire of London back in his day, which is in equal parts impressive and thoroughly disappointing. Maybe Luna belongs to some veteran club? Maybe she goes to places like that to unwind or hunt for Wrackspurts; maybe she’s actually their age and sucks the life force out of Ginny to stay young.
it so desperately, his cock keeps leaking precome, hanging hard and heavy between his legs.
Potter came every day at nine a.m. sharp. Every day, he had a messenger bag with him, filled to the brim with thick folders and paperwork, and an array of writing utensils clattering about—everything he needed to record all the work to be done and file his report for the DMLE. There was a certain irony in the fact that the man couldn’t seem to escape being employed by the bloody Ministry, directly or not. Draco told him just that and when Potter laughed, the low rumble of it rang in Draco’s ears until the end of the day.
“Oh, and their chai?
It isn’t a transaction, though. It is a choice.
to collect. Somewhere at the edges of his astonishment, he can feel anger slowly welling up to the surface, boiling and ugly right under his skin. “And what? Things got too dangerous for you so you’re selling your buddies out? Secured yourself a nice little deposit first, so now you can break the inconvenient ties and cut yourself a nice deal on the side?”
“The rules—“
“I’ll take you out later and find you some pastries or something,” Harry promises. “Satisfy your raging sweet tooth.”
listen right now. “I’m going to suck your cock, then we’re going to go back out there and be good guests until it’s an appropriate time to leave.”
Rose wiggles her way out of Draco’s arms and onto the floor, straightening out her dress as she rights herself. “Am I sitting with you, mummy?” she asks Hermione.
“You’re drunk,” The blond man had accused, looking up at Harry where he stood swaying in the doorway.
in his voice is enough to break Harry’s resolve, unable to hold back any longer. He pulls his fingers out completely, satisfaction blooming in his chest when Draco whines at the loss. The hand still clamped around his cock eases off, allowing him to wrap his own hand around it. With a fresh lubrication spell, he slicks himself up, surprised at how close he feels to the edge already.
“That’s rare for you,” Draco chides softly.
“We both deserve to be happy and
They’re 27 now, far too old for this thing they can’t let go of but they haven’t stopped falling into each other. It’s worse now, Draco all but moving in with him and rarely spending a moment outside of his company. Harry hasn’t told a soul about his feelings, not even his closest friends. It’s so clear to him that they know, their pitying looks following him everywhere he goes. Sometimes—against their better judgement—they try to bring it up but he shuts them down quicker than they can utter the words. He can’t take it.
There was the night four days ago where they decided to go out for a meal, alone, and actually made an effort with it. Draco found some obnoxiously expensive muggle restaurant with dishes Harry had no hope of pronouncing and even less hope of identifying and they had their first peaceful, child-free meal of the holiday. It was a stunning venue, with twinkling chandeliers and gold-accented walls. He’d been ready to do it, sometime after their shared dessert that looked inedible and tasted divine, but fate had other plans. Of course.
He’s so deep into the speeches that by the time it gets to his turn, he’s almost entirely forgotten that he has to make a speech at all.
“I’m not taking no for an answer, you should know that by now.” He does, very well.
“You stare so loud,” Draco says suddenly, closing his book in one hand, keeping a finger on the page and looking up at Harry. “It’s distracting.”
Draco scoffs. “Over your dead body, Potter.”
Harry isn’t all too sure what that means. “What do you mean?”
“Our next speaker needs no introduction,” Ginny calls out, making Harry groan. He knows she’s about to say something he won’t like. “Give it up for the saviour of the wizarding world, my ex-boyfriend, Harry Potter!” She finishes with a dramatic flourish, sticking her finger up at him in a rude but all-too-familiar gesture.
They were gone for maybe half an hour, Harry thinks, though his perception of time when wrapped up in Draco is incredibly unreliable. It’s somewhere around eleven if he’s correct, and the party is still in full swing. Pansy is flirting with a tall blonde woman in the corner, both of them amusingly drunk and gesturing wildly as they speak. All of the Weasleys are in varying states of intoxication, from Molly who is openly sobbing on the shoulder of a very stricken Luna, to Charlie who is sat on top of a table conjuring dancing visages of dragons for the few children who haven’t been tucked away in a corner to sleep. Hermione and Ron are swaying together on the dancefloor, steps completely out of time with the fast-paced lively tune that is playing. It seems that nobody missed their presence too much.
He doesn’t need to be told twice. Using his grip on the blond locks to anchor him, he fucks into Draco’s mouth, breath hitching at the feel of it. He doesn’t think he’s going to last long, the image of the love of his life on his knees before him and letting him defile his mouth like this just too much to handle.
, he’d called him Harry. The anxiety he feels only strengthens, making it hard to breathe. In all of their years in this limbo, he’s only ever called him that once. It had been one of the strangest nights of Harry’s life. One night, just before they’d fucked for the first time, Draco had turned up on his doorstep; soaking wet and sobbing. Dumbfounded, Harry had helped him inside and sat him in front of the roaring fire, casting all the warming and drying spells he could think of. The sobbing didn’t cease for hours, eventually a murmured ‘Hold me, Harry?’ had broken the silence. And so he did. He held him the entire night, until the boy couldn’t cry anymore. They never spoke of it again, and Draco hasn’t uttered his name since.
He does feel very lucky indeed. He presses a kiss to his lips before moving along to his jaw, pressing feather-light teasing kisses into the skin. The soft moan Draco lets out when he kisses the sensitive skin below his ear is the sweetest sound he’s ever heard. Tentatively, afraid of ruining everything, he nips at the spot before sucking a mark into the skin. Draco only holds him tighter, gasping at the sharp pleasure-pain.
Draco blinks up at him. Harry wonders if he slept at all, the bags under his eyes a deep purple. “Come back to bed,” Harry begs. “Whatever this is—it’ll still be here in the morning. You look like death.”
He throws the leafy part of the strawberry onto a napkin and lays back down onto his back, stretching his arms up and placing them under his head. Eyes closed, he listens to the sound of the waves crashing against the shore and Draco’s steady breathing. It would be easy to slip into sleep, to run away from doing the thing he knows he needs to do. He can’t, though.
. They don’t sleep, not yet. Simply existing, basking in the knowledge that maybe things will be okay after all, they stay awake. Content. It feels like hours before one of them speaks.
The rest of the room is quite boring, grey walls with more of Draco’s chosen artwork and a large ornate mirror propped against one of the walls that Harry hates with a fiery passion but won’t get rid of. His favourite part of the space is the plush window seat. He sits in it sometimes, when laying next to Draco is too much, looking out across the rooftops and letting the moon lull him to sleep.
It would be so easy to just ask. They’re completely on the same page, Draco talking about their future wedding at least once a week, but something is stopping him. He wants it to be perfect. It’s an excuse, he knows.
He looks a little sad at that, pouting pathetically. Harry can smell the booze now, the sharp scent that hits his nostrils almost offensive. He decides not to bother waiting for an answer. Turning to Draco, he’s unsurprised by the smug expression he finds on the man’s face. “Coming?”
“What the fuck is this all about, Potter?” Draco spat, pulling his hand away.
Draco scoffs, offended. “You might be whipped, Potter, but I am above that.”
He drops Draco’s hand and wraps an arm around him, hand slipping dangerously low on his back. He doesn’t stray further, not yet, though his fingers ache to reach under the material. Draco, impatient as ever, whines.
“Speaking of dinner—“ Hermione appears suddenly, none of them having noticed her coming towards them. “Everyone else is making their way to the tables, in case you haven’t noticed,” she tells them with a pointed look between the two men that Harry might have to tell her off for later if he finds the courage.
“See what?”
Six months of Molly’s relentless jitters, Ginny’s grumpy outbursts and Luna’s airy indifference later, the wedding day is finally here.
Harry laughs and turns his head to press a kiss into Draco’s palm before pulling the hand away but not letting go of it, keeping it held tightly in his. “I thought we were here to have sex, not insult my intelligence.”
“Explain to me what you think I’m doing here,” Draco demands. His expression is a little clearer to Harry now, confusion written all over his face.
“Are you on something?”
A smile creeps its way onto his face at the touch. “I love you,” Harry says.
It’s hard to picture a moment more perfect than this.
It’s not what he intended to say, and by the stricken look on Draco’s face, not at all what the other man expected.
Can’t have all your fucktoys thinking they mean something.”
“Kreacher,” he calls into the darkness of the room.
“I can do both,” he pulls his shirt off when Draco is done with the buttons and lets it fall onto the growing heap of clothes. Smugly, he watches Draco take him in. All warm brown skin, toned abs and strong arms from the years of working out to clear his head; Draco eats it up every time.
Harry forces out a laugh, it rings painfully hollow. “Good luck with that, she looks worse than she did at George’s wedding.”
“I hate you both,” he tells them, though he can’t quite keep the smile off his face.
Eventually, Draco’s inability to wait patiently makes itself known once again. Nimble fingers wrap around his erection, taking him by surprise. He stills his hand, raising an eyebrow at the man below him. He doesn’t get a response, just an incredibly well-practised innocent smile and the feeling of the hand tightening around him. Groaning, he thrusts into the fist.
The mask of annoyance slips away, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his lips. “The kind of night where you ask me stupid questions every five minutes rather than go to sleep,” he states simply.
The one person he wants to talk to and dance with and everything else has been dutifully ignoring him since dinner ended. Fucking Malfoy.
?" Her confusion matches Harry’s own.
“You’re full of shit, Potter.”
Draco freezes, speechless for once. Then, his expression shifts. From shock to something entirely new that Harry can’t decipher. “I’ve loved you for longer than that,” he says calmly, refusing to break eye contact.
Bringing everyone to a beach house on the south coast of France had been a last-minute decision. They’d all been talking one night about how daunting turning thirty is and how little time they get away from everything now. Harry’s done being an Auror, was done long before he quit and didn’t even notice until Draco pointed it out, and now spends his days as a freelance defence trainer; training others and showcasing his skills without the mountains of paperwork and the lingering trauma. It keeps him busy and has the added bonus of hopefully leaving him qualified to settle down and be a professor one day, when he’s ready.
They’re both on the defensive, preparing for an attack that neither of them wants to initiate. He’s not sure what went wrong. He’s kind of sick of not being sure. It would be so easy to just say it, to pull the plug on their ridiculous game and finally be free. Uttering the words comes with a price, one he’s not willing to pay.
Why now? After all these years. Why kiss him like it’s his only reason for living and say his name like it belongs on his lips and still deny that there’s anything between them but sex? He feels like he might be sick.
oblivious? I’ve been in love with you for over a year!” He shouts, the confession bouncing off the walls before laying itself between them.
A hand is placed onto his arm, squeezing lightly. He’s seen Blaise be many things; loud, scathing, flirty. Never comforting, not with anyone outside of their little circle. He must really be a mess, to earn the pity of Blaise Zabini.
The man takes a deep breath, the end of it tapering into a chuckle. “You’re in love with him,” he states.
“Break
Too eager to bother with bottles and lids, he murmurs a lubrication charm—wandless—before circling his fingers against the rim.
Harry curses under his breath, pushing himself up into a sitting position right as a little body collides with Draco’s, almost knocking him over. He watches as Draco wraps his arms around the excited child, pulling him into his lap.
“Draco?” He speaks up suddenly.
The look Ron gives him is far too understanding, pity etched into the small frown of his heavy brows. “Harry—“
Sooner than he likes, the other man pulls away. “I’m sorry—I—“ Draco halts, breathing too fast to get any words out. Harry’s startled by it.
She giggles her little melodic giggle and then promptly quietens as the rest of the bridesmaids finish their procession.
Harry feels incredibly smug, knowing it takes little more than a barely-there touch to have such a stubborn man crumble. He lowers himself down to give him a kiss, holding himself up with one arm placed next to his head. Their lips brush and something changes, something deep inside of him that says
He’s being shaken aggressively, rocked back and forth where he lays by four tiny hands. Cracking a tired eye open, he’s not at all surprised to see Rose and Hugo kneeling beside him in the huge bed, giggling conspiratorially. Rose is seven now, wise beyond her years and increasingly troublesome, Hugo is four and more than happy to be her sidekick.
Ginny is standing at the top of the aisle, all eyes on her. Arthur is holding onto her arm, beaming with pride and love written in every line on his warm face. Everyone in the room is entranced by her. The long lines of her dress are sharp and clean, the structured bodice accentuating her lean form. Her short hair frames her face perfectly and every freckle on her skin looks placed there by some higher power. He flicks his gaze to the side to look at Luna, smiling fondly as he takes in her expression. Her pale blue eyes are shining with tears, the look on her face a special kind of magic. This is what love looks like, he thinks. It strikes him deep in his core that the look on her face watching the love of her life walk down the aisle towards her mirrors the way he feels when he looks at Draco.
Without even a murmur of hesitation, Draco places his left hand in Harry’s. He presses a kiss to the back of the hand, right over a scar he got from one of his more disastrous attempts at cooking, before sliding the ring onto his waiting finger.
If he’s being honest, he’s already forgotten what he was going to say. It doesn’t seem to matter, his mouth has already decided what he’s going to say next before he even registers the thought.
Harry, having the honour of being Luna’s best man, stands to the side of the altar next to the blonde woman herself. Her dress is long and flows beautifully, every inch of it covered in tiny stars he knows Molly spent days embroidering by hand. Her waist-length hair is loose and wavy, bright white flowers only slightly visible against the platinum strands. She looks stunning.
“Do you always have to be such a prick?” He asks, unsure whether he’s tired or frustrated or just too in love to put up with him anymore. He wants to go home. He wants to fuck and then go to sleep as far apart as they can possibly get in the king-size bed as if they aren’t just going to wake up in each other’s arms, every inch of their bodies pressed together.
“You’re a prick,” he accuses, voice strained.
“I’m sure he’s just fine,” he answers with an eye roll, though Blaise doesn’t dignify it with a response, already strolling away from him.
He didn’t turn around for the whole journey to one of Pansy’s many spare bedrooms, too pissed off to speak to or even look at the man behind him. When he finally found one that was blissfully unoccupied, he grasped Draco’s wrist and pulled him in, locking the door behind them with ease.
it hit him. Despite all the glaring neon signs, the realisation was a sudden and entirely too life-shattering one.
“I don’t see how that’s funny.”
Draco laughs, softly and sort of out of it. “I told you you’re getting old,” he chides, though it’s flat; missing something.
Draco shakes his head, a smile playing at the edge of his lips. “As much as I’d like to see that, it’s fine. One hour.”
He looks to Draco, taking in the pained look on his face. He’s not sure if it’s annoyance at being caught, fear or just plain mortification. Their eyes meet and Harry just shrugs lightly before turning back to the ecstatic bride.
He kisses back, matching the urgency in Draco’s movements. It’s better than he ever could have created in his mind. The warmth, the taste of something sweet on Draco’s lips, the way his hands are still holding on to his tie like a lifeline, holding him there. It’s all so
As the realisation hits him, Ginny makes it to the altar and places a kiss on her father’s dimpled cheek before taking Luna’s hands in her broom-calloused ones.
“You were having a panic attack, or something like that,” Blaise informs him. “Thought you could use some air.”
He’s chewing on his lip, looking more thoughtful than Harry thinks he’s ever seen him. “We can’t go home yet,” he says, mulling something over in his head. “It’s too early, everyone will notice.”
“Should I be worried about how easily you lie to me, my love?”
He hadn’t noticed. She’s right, he finds upon looking around. Most of the guests are seated, a few still milling around finding their places amongst the beautifully decorated tables. He flushes a little, feeling very caught out. They’d been in their own little bubble, as he often seems to be with Draco.
“When are you going to tell him, Harry?” Ron asks then, all too soon.
The scribbling stops. Wide, panicked eyes turn to him. “Get out,” he says as if it’s his kitchen and he has any right at all.
Harry huffs out a laugh, jostling them a little. He presses another kiss to the soft lips, this time with no ulterior motives. He pulls away and opens his eyes; surprised to find Draco watching him. There’s a warmth in the blue-grey eyes that’s not entirely rare but still manages to shock him every time, the force of it so overwhelming. “We can talk this all out in the morning, okay?” He murmurs before kissing the tip of his nose in what would usually be an extremely dangerous move, laughing in relief when he scrunches it in response—the warmth not dissipating. “Let’s go to bed.”
Naturally, as they always do, his eyes find Draco. He sits on the back porch, the sliding doors cracked open to let the sea breeze in. Harry goes to the doors without a thought. Curled up on one side of a swing seat that’s gently rocking, his love seems entirely distracted by a book. As usual. Contrary to Harry and the few grey hairs he’s already found, Draco hasn’t aged a day. The only noticeable difference between the Draco in front of him and the one he fell in love with is the hair that now grazes his shoulders. There had been a few tearful conversations when he’d first raised the idea of growing his hair out, initially deeply insecure about the prospect of looking like his father. Thankfully, he looks nothing like Lucius. He’s still the most beautiful thing Harry has ever seen, perhaps even more so now.
“Oh really?” Draco asks, pulling a funny face. “That’s lovely, thank you for sharing that information. I’m sure dinner will go down a treat now that I have the thought of Hugo’s smelly nappy in my head.” Rose giggles at that, muttering a small ‘very stinky’.
Hours later, he’s ready to call it a night.
Harry shakes his head. That’s such a lie that for a moment he doesn’t know how to respond. Draco is far too good for him, has only ever done good for years. All Harry did was one thing he was essentially raised to do, Draco has spent the last ten years making up for the mistakes he would have been forgiven for anyway. Even beyond forgiveness, he does small kind things even when he thinks nobody can see. Harry always sees. He doesn’t think he’s ever possessed the ability to truly take his eyes off him.
Draco nods so fast Harry’s worried he might snap his pretty neck. “You’d know if it wasn’t.”
The children promptly plant themselves on either side of him. He gives them both questioning looks.
Suddenly, Harry finds it hard to breathe. With a hideous scraping noise, he pulls the chair he’s holding out from under the table and drops into it, unable to stand with this information pulling him down. He doesn’t want to believe it. If it’s true then he truly has been a fool.
“Harry,” he breathes.
“Of course she told her mother, Potter. Don’t be so dense. She’s a clever girl, aren’t you, little dove?” He asks her, never dumbing down his voice like a lot of people would to a child of her age. She nods, pulling a face at Harry that makes Draco cackle with glee.
supposed to mean? It’s already too late. He picks his head up and instead thunks it back against the tree, wincing slightly. There’s nothing he can do here. It was painful enough—loving Draco at a distance, laying together every night but still with lines they would never cross. He doesn’t know if he can do it now that he knows what it feels like to kiss him. He can lock away the war and the loss and the regrets but he doesn’t think the taste of Draco’s lips will go quietly.
It doesn’t take long for him to get hard, not with Draco’s hand working him and warm lips moving against his. It’s so much and yet not at all enough when he wants
Spread out next to each other on a blanket in the slowly dipping evening sun, on the beach far enough from the house that they can’t hear the argument Hermione and Ron are having about Ron’s incessant need to tinker with stuff at the table, they’re content.
“But—“
“Don’t,” Harry says, firm. He can’t do this, not now, not ever. There’s a reason he’s avoided talking to them about this, it’s a door he’s kept firmly closed for so long that he’s afraid of how much dust is gathering inside, waiting to choke him. “I can’t.”
“At my sister's wedding, Harry? Really?” He complains before getting up and grabbing his sleeping child from Harry’s arms. He’s well aware of what’s happening here and wants no part in it. “Tell him, after you’re done with whatever weird shit you’re gonna do.”
He’s about to say just that when something catches his attention. Someone is talking to Draco, leaning against the drinks table and moving in far too close for his liking. He can only see the back of the man from where he’s sitting, an unfamiliar and rather muscular man with dark hair. Draco’s type. The blond man himself looks unbothered, cocking his hip and sipping his drink with a ghost of a smirk playing on his lips.
Everything.
, they came out of the war completely unscathed. I don’t really know what happened, I disapparated and then I was here. I didn’t even recognise the place until I knocked and you opened the door.”
The next day, he wonders again if it might be the right time.
“You beat me by about five seconds, dear,” Ginny rebukes, leaning in to kiss her wife on the cheek. He makes a fake gagging noise at them both.
“I’m already regretting this,” he lies easily, turning the box over in his hands. Draco snatches it, grinning.
“Oh, it’s hilarious Potter,” Blaise says. “Funniest thing I’ve ever heard.”
For the first time, they fall asleep holding each other. Lips pressed to the top of Draco’s head, the blond’s pale arms hooked around his middle and their legs tangled together, the last thing he thinks before he succumbs to sleep is
(See the end of the chapter for
“I just think you don’t have a clue what you’re talking about,” he says, a hint of anger seeping into his tone. He doesn’t mean to let his anger get the best of him but at this point, it’s anger or hope. Hope isn’t something he needs, knowing it’ll only be ripped away from him. “He doesn’t feel anything for me, he’s never even fucking
Draco looks down at the offending fabric and then at Harry’s robes and groans loudly. “That’s deeply embarrassing, Potter. Go change.”
“Yeah we—“
but lays his head on Harry’s shoulder anyway, so it can’t be all that bad. The blaring sun doesn’t hit them here, the porch laying completely in shade, but the way it looks against the calm ripples of the sea is a sight to behold. This section of the beach is private, nobody there to bother them or ruin their view. He wonders if now might be the time.
. Standing over him, trousers still up and holding his erection right in front of his face, he can see Draco’s bratty resolve start to break. He wants it too much to play around.
“Draco?” he breathes when he hears the telltale crack of the women disapparating away.
The man is strikingly beautiful, leaning against the tree he’s now realising they’re sat against; further away from the tent than he remembers walking. The light of the full moon bounces off the snow, illuminating everything in an eerie white glow.
If they were in St Mungo’s, they’d let Malfoy kick back with a shot of a hospital-grade painkiller and some gentle muscle relaxant while they’re at it—they are, however, in a hotel in the middle of nowhere and Harry can only offer an alcohol-based Devil’s Claw Draught and a few drops of Dreamless Sleep mixed into Malfoy’s tea.
They stand like that for a few long seconds, just breathing the same air, and Harry can feel Draco’s hips move; it’s a fraction of an inch, a small, deliberate shiver of a muscle and then, Harry’s lost.
Draco can feel the moment Harry replaces his tongue with his finger. Teddy’s head drops down, the tips of his hair tickling Draco’s face as Teddy lets out a low, shattering moan.
Hyacinths.
“What happens now?” he asks quietly, constellations reflecting in the dark silver of his eyes.
Hermione is the first to speak so Harry assumes she was the perpetrator. “Don’t be ridiculous, what could we be hiding?”
As in, the flowers aunt Petunia had in her garden. The garden Harry was forced to work in on long, summer days from the age of eight to ten, until Dudley rode his brand new mountain bike into said garden and ploughed down all of Petunia’s bloody flowers, turning them into a violet-green mulch. The garden that Harry was still punished for destroying.
and it’s not something Harry’s prepared to handle. Like, at all. He expects Draco’s face to carry the slightest trace of a grimace, maybe annoyance, or even disgust. However, when Draco turns to him, his face is carefully blank, a perfectly pleasant, cool mask, and it makes Harry’s stomach clench, to see that mask for the first time in over a year.
The fair is filled to the brim with Muggles, walking around having fun with their friends and families. Rows of stands are lined up next to every curved path, selling food and snacks and handcrafted trinkets, and offering an array of games and attractions with the prizes displayed at the front. Harry snorts, imagining the horror on Draco’s face if he entered a contest just to win him a huge teddy bear as a tribute to one of the most clichée things one can do for their date at a fair.
Harry’s heart stops beating for a few seconds; he’s so quiet he barely even breathes, despite the spell being one-sided. Standing frozen in place, he slowly, carefully looks around but there’s no sight of Malfoy or his mystery companion. His heart racing, Harry wraps sweaty fingers around the Mokeskin pouch and slips into the back alley behind the store.
“Malfoy! It’s the Minister’s orders!” Harry interrupts before he goes off completely and it works—Malfoy pauses, squinting at him with suspicion. Harry takes a long breath. “Now shut up and let me think.”
against his skin. And while he can see the allure, Draco engaging into situations like that makes his stomach churn.
in front of one another—all those days, it’s been rushed blowjobs with their trousers down to their thighs, quick handjobs, bruised lips, and bitten necks. Until now, they’ve been too afraid to take their time, to look at each other long enough to admit it’s happening and they both want it just as much. And now, Harry finally has
Harry kisses him again, slow, deep, and dazed. “Yes. Draco, yes,
He rolls his hips back, making sure Draco can breathe, and pushes back in, setting a slow, dragging pace, moaning shamelessly as he starts to fuck Draco’s mouth. By unspoken agreement, he pulls out whenever Draco’s fingers dig into his thigh a little harder and lets him take a pause—he swallows a few laboured breaths, a string of saliva stretching between his lower lip and the tip of Harry’s cock.
“You smell like sex,” he gasped, voice muffled where his nose was buried behind Draco’s ear.
“Well, you could try and talk to him,” Blaise says as he enters the room, Levitating a generously stacked charcuterie board and a new bottle of wine in front of him.
“You’re—mmmmhm—beautiful,” Harry murmurs, kissing and licking his way down, dipping his tongue into the dimples in Draco’s lower back. The only response he gets is incoherent moans. “Want to taste you,” Harry whispers, giving his arse cheek a playful bite.
In the corner of his eye, Harry sees Malfoy turn so he busies himself with throwing everything he’s bought onto the other bed.
“Draco?”
to ruin my life?” he growls and runs a shaky hand through his hair.
They’re on the run, in the middle of fuck-knows-where, fighting a battle royale with wanted criminals, and Harry’s currently sporting a semi for his charge. Circe and Morgana help him.
“Malfoy,” he says with a warning in his voice.
Without really thinking about it, Harry shucks off his t-shirt and goes to the bathroom, nearly suffocating under Draco’s gaze escorting him to the door.
His phone chimes just when they’re leaving the room, after Harry’s Glamoured himself, too, and he finds a text from Ron:
Draco starts fucking him, hard and fast, already feeling his thighs are going to hurt like a motherfucker tomorrow morning. He’s pushing Harry down onto his cock just the way he loves it and with the Silencing Spell in place, Harry doesn’t have to hold back anymore—he moans and shouts, and lets out a series of sounds that will fuel Draco’s inappropriately-timed daydreams, possibly for years to come.
rather than a definite
“Why are we here?” He turns his head to look at Harry, and Harry’s heart does that annoying, stuttery thing again. He stifles it, though, clearing his throat.
Later at night, they lie in their respective beds and neither is falling asleep anytime soon. Harry keeps thinking about unprofessional choices, Draco’s hair, and the way his hand slipped while shrinking the shirt which resulted in him having to see every single dip and muscle outlined in the fabric stretched over Malfoy’s chest. He also thinks about whatever the fuck could be keeping Malfoy awake as he tosses and turns two feet away.
Draco’s sitting on top of him, all flushed skin and perfect teeth, and he’s so beautiful, Harry forgets about everything else for a moment. “
, as he likes to say.
“Care to elaborate on that?”
“That’s none of your business.”
Harry feels a little bad as at that moment, he feels every hard knot in his back and realises how hard he’s gripping his glass. Draco’s sultry voice only adds to his nervousness, so he tries taking a few deep breaths. “You realise having drinks with witnesses hunted by the mob is not exactly in my job description?” he asks tightly, taking a large gulp.
One of these days, Harry should maybe think about what exactly it means. To him, to Draco. Not now. Just, at some point.
“And what did they find?” Harry’s impatient and excited at the same time—knowing Draco’s penchant for dramatics, the story will be a good one.
When he’s back, Malfoy finds his now lukewarm tea on the counter and raises an eyebrow—he must notice the faintly purple tinge of the Dreamless Sleep. He nods curtly at Harry and downs the whole cup.
Harry smirks. “It’s called walking, I’m not sure if you’re familiar.”
“I’d rather we didn’t call it anything.” Harry squeezes his eyes shut.
“You’re submissive,” he says with a satisfied smirk.
Harry just stares, not willing to risk his voice coming out weird, and lifts the paper bag so that Draco can see the bakery’s logo.
Harry’s hikes up Draco’s leg over his hip and slots them closer—the change of angle punches the breath out of him and Harry rubs their cocks together in sharp, relentless thrusts and Draco arches up to match the pace, dragging blunt fingernails across his back. Harry’s muscles burn with the force of his thrusts, arse clenching on every plunge as he kisses Draco messily, hands roaming over smooth skin, calves, thighs, and up, finally clutching at his waist, hard enough to bruise.
“Oh, I babysit Teddy sometimes, when Andromeda needs me,” Harry shrugs. He loves little Teddy to bits and sometimes misses the boy when they don’t see each other for too long; after the War, Harry promised himself he’ll be the best godfather he can—for Remus, for Tonks, for Teddy, and maybe a little for himself, too. In the beginning, he was terrified he would screw up the kid—an orphaned war veteran with a Saviour Complex, several scars and even more issues—but it quickly turned out nobody in Andromeda’s household has survived that time unscathed and Harry built quite a strong bond with his godson. Looking back, it was an experience that shaped both of them, and Harry was infinitely grateful for another sliver of love and hope Teddy’s presence has brought into his life.
Harry doesn’t have an answer to that, still eyeing the bloody revolver with growing trepidation.
The kisses slowly turned hungry, filthy, as Draco practically dry-humped him, his wings unfurled into their full, glorious span, nearly knocking over the nearest lamp. Harry kept pressing him closer and massaging Draco’s lower back, coating every inch of delicate skin with the oil as Draco’s glands just kept leaking more and more, and Harry suddenly wondered if it worked like precome, if Draco would get wetter if they kept going. It must have been induced by their shared arousal, the steady trickle of warm, fragrant, liquid evidence that Draco wanted this as much as Harry did. He kissed Draco a little harder, and dragged his hips just a little more, imagining how the lower feathers must have been soaked by now, his fingers tingling as the oil dripped down his hands.
—he probably doesn’t know how Harry got it but doesn’t ask, even though his eyes trace the discoloured letters with curiosity.
Potter cleans them off with a flick of his wrist and kisses the lights out of Draco, not bothering to tuck them back in, hyperfocused on that bloody tie still and using it as a tether to steer Draco’s mouth right where he wants it.
“And you,” Draco turns to Harry like a hawk, making him freeze. He looks like he can read people’s minds and that’s the absolute last thing Harry needs right now, considering he’s just been thinking Draco is hot and not interested in him in that way. “Do you have my brioche? I wasn’t joking, you know.”
Draco frowns. “Nobody has a voice like that.”
“Oh for the— Didn’t you see him?”
“Try again,” Harry says coldly, setting aside all the thoughts racing around in his head, his mind clearing like the surface of a lake after someone throws a stone in it. Cool resolve slowly settles into his bones as he regards his boss—well, ex-boss, now that Harry thinks about it—and prepares for the final showdown.
“You need to get some sleep,” she says tiredly, sitting down next to Harry and treating him with a severe look.
Draco’s grip on the headboard is so tight his arms are shaking, and he lets out a guttural moan as Harry slowly enters him, inch by eviscerating inch, his cooling sweat dripping onto Draco’s back. By the time he’s inside him up to the hilt, Draco’s panting so hard, his breaths are coming out as choked gulps and Harry holds him tight in his arms, biting into the meat of his shoulder. Draco is taut like a metal rod, so tight around him Harry’s eyes roll back, and he groans, patiently waiting for him to adjust to the pressure.
“Fuck…” Draco breathes. “Oh my fucking— Oh. Oh, Harry—”
Two: He’s a virgin.
“Piss off,” Ron laughs. “See you soon, and watch out for Malfoy.”
—you have to answer honestly. On my part, I can assure you I’m not interested in your secret Auror base where you breed new generation soldiers, or anything like that—”
“I want to,” Harry says simply, a little surprised at how raspy his voice sounds. He kisses the side of Draco’s cock. “I just. I’ve never done this before so— Just tell me if it’s bad,” he says, feeling his face go red.
,” Harry moans and captures Draco’s mouth, again and again, every hungry, bruising kiss leaving him blind with desire.
“Let me—” Draco said and lifted himself off, pausing only to cup Harry’s jaw in his palm with a strange, fragile look, the intoxicating scent of his oil lingering between them like a promise.
Their breakfast passes without any interruptions, in a silence that Harry’s mortified to call somewhat companionable. He watches Malfoy immediately snatch the muffin, not even asking before claiming it as his. He sighs happily at the first sip of his too-sweet coffee, quiet enough for Harry to pretend he didn’t hear it, and Harry tries not to laugh at the fact that taming Draco Malfoy apparently goes down to stuffing his face shut with sweets.
“You, Potter,” Robards says calmly, clearly satisfied Harry’s put it together. “Malfoy was an… inconvenience, I’ll admit, but we have adapted. As it turns out, some parties find you to be quite a nuisance, especially if they’re planning to take over the Ministry,” he says, his tone suggesting he’s talking about the weather rather than a
Instead, Draco watched him from afar, memorised the coordinates of each and every freckle, and thought about that one little curl of jet-black hair, right next to Potter’s ear, and imagined it brushing against the tip of his nose. He was downright disturbed by that indigo jacket, too, the enticing row of onyxes mocking his fingers that itched to open them one by one, to peel off everything that dwelled underneath and melt into that sandalwood-smelling skin like no time had passed.
“See, Ron, I’m expressing my affection!” Harry cranes his neck to look at his best mate, currently picking at the carpet with spite and pointedly ignoring him.
Potter lifts his chin and licks into his mouth and in that moment, Draco knows there’s no going back.
“First you undress me, now you’re demanding to put your
“Mate,
Draco lets out a soft gasp.
Potter chuckles softly. “Tomorrow.”
“And yet?”
“Oh, you’re no fun,” he says teasingly, with a barely-there twitch to his fingers.
“Harry,” he whispered, the name coming as a broken breath and Harry felt his eyes prickle with hot tears.
“And you found that out before or after he was all over you?” He scoffs. “Do you even realise he could have—”
“I feel like Weasley is the type of man who will have one in the future,” Draco muses, nestling himself comfortably on the sofa.
There’s a long, awkward pause. Harry flops down onto the desk and hides his face in his crossed arms. Finally, Ginny speaks. “Oh, babe.”
Harry freezes, his heart battering against his ribs, the weight of the decision he has to make dawning on him like an anvil to the face. “What—”
thing.”
“And I am a
The presenter’s hand was shaking so much, he placed it flat on the table and Harry heard Draco make a choked sound at the back of his throat. It can’t be. There’s no confirmation. It’s not happening, it’s not, they’ll say it was a false alarm, it’s something else, maybe there’s a fire, maybe—
They’re standing in front of a small holding cell, very similar to the one Harry broke Draco out of at the very beginning of their journey. It’s full circle—they’re back where they started, only richer in a few significant developments, most of which make Harry’s heart stutter like a wild butterfly. The cell doesn’t look any different from all the other cells at the Ministry, but there are a select few that Harry knows about, including the one they’re standing in front of right now, that have a special trait Harry needs at the moment.
Harry comes inside and goes straight to the living room—he knows this place like the back of his hand. He’s spent so many days and nights here, more than he could count—telly nights, dinners, get-togethers, sometimes Harry would just drop in unannounced to spend some time with Draco. It’s ridiculous how he knows where his favourite mug is, how he has a favourite spot on the couch and despite all that, he never figured out why it was always so normal, so naturally good, and it feels like he’s here for the very first time. Draco’s steps echo from the hallway as he follows and enters the room to find Harry pacing nervously from one side of the couch to another.
Draco must notice his queasiness and continues. “Sure, magic can erase or replace emotions, it can even provide new ones, but that’s all they’ll ever be—magically supplied sensations. Do you understand? It might be
Well, empty
“Later?”
,” Draco said darkly and paused. “Didn’t peg you for someone who’d worry about upholstery, of all things,” he said and Harry chuckled.
He takes one more whiff of the lavender and steps inside.
“Fuck off!” he snarls, trying to wiggle out of Harry’s grip.
The morning rush has barely started—crowds of witches and wizards only just beginning to grow in numbers as cracks of Apparition echo through the hall and people rush out of the Floos, hastily dusting off their coats and jackets. There’s a sizable queue to the sandwich stand, nearly as long as the one to the coffee machine. The stranger doesn’t pause at either, nor does he carry anything with him, save for an intimidating mien he seems to radiate as he walks.
Harry’s friends shoot them both a knowing smile and go back to the living room. Before they catch up, Harry places a soft kiss on Draco’s lips.
“I am,” he whispers. “And I’m going to need a place to stay,” he looks at Harry pointedly, making him snort.
Draco’s eyes widen as he looks behind Harry, craning his neck. It doesn’t take him long to add two and two and his face breaks into a shit-eating grin. “I did not,” he says slowly, biting his lip as he surveys the patrons. “But perhaps Lady Fortune has smiled upon us.”
“One more,” Draco murmurs and kisses him again, desperately, like he’s making sure Harry’s there, real and alive, and not imagined.
“I’m not going to hurt you.”
Draco’s not even done opening his mouth (perhaps to whisper something, but more likely to gape at Potter in horror) when Harry springs into action.
“You think that’s what I need?”
“Whatever.”
Draco derangedly thinks what is about to go down in this little, unassuming bistro. They didn’t discuss how they were going to break the news and while Draco logically knows Harry wouldn’t change his mind, he finds himself fidgeting—it’s ridiculous, knowing that these people are their friends and he’s almost certain they would not have a problem with it. His heart skips a beat at the memory of Harry using the word ‘boyfriend’ last night—it’s apparently what they are now and Draco isn’t sure he wants to laugh, cry, scream or do all three. Harry told him he
.” There’s something strange about the way he says it but Harry’s too inebriated to care and too distracted with the shirt to give it any serious thought.
Hermione opens and closes her mouth a few times, looking for an answer that would be the least incriminating—Harry feels transported back to Hogwarts, it’s just now he’s McGonagall and Hermione is twelve years younger. “We… might have concealed the fact—”
He turns to Harry once again, mouth curved into a slight pout. “To be honest, however, I imagined something rather more sensual, you, me, a bottle of expensive champagne, some Celestina Warbeck in the background…”
He spends almost all day there, not really thinking about why the Healers are allowing this—it could be his name alone, as much as he’d usually hate to admit it; it could be Hermione or Ron secretly doing him a favour, talking to some old friends; or the Healers themselves, glad there’s at least one person in the entire wing who is capable of shutting Draco up. They talk about everything that happened, and Harry tells him about Robards, his wife, and how they thought it was Narcissa—Draco’s visibly relieved at that, although he turns a little pensive after Harry recounts the events. They avoid the topic of the upcoming trial—Hermione said the Wizengamot, now free of any corrupt judges, after a thorough cleansing conducted by Kingsley, has moved the date of Draco’s testimony so he can fully recover.
The usual programme was interrupted by a pale-looking reporter—his face looked sick even on the fuzzy, black and white screen. He was sitting in front of a desk, holding some papers in shaking hands. His eyes nervously skimmed left and right, presumably reading from a prompter.
and what a terribly apt choice, to hear the singer beg in a sweet voice for the one thing Harry wanted the most at that moment.
. Harry wants everything Draco is willing to give, wants to strip himself bare and offer himself up for the taking. Draco wraps an arm around his neck, the other around his waist and kisses him again. He can feel the tip of Draco’s tongue brush against his lips and opens up to that hot wetness, licking and sucking as they both scramble for purchase, gripping each other’s shirts and groaning into the searing kiss.
They jump as the Ferris wheel stops with an ominous creak, their seat nearly at its very top, with November wind lashing at their flushed faces. Draco takes in the view, not letting go of Harry’s face. Draco’s hair is tousled and his lips are swollen and Harry pulls him closer, dragging his legs into his lap, and, thankfully, has the mind to cast a Notice-Me-Not and a few handy charms for safety’s sake. They make out like teenage movie stars in the culminating moment of their story, and perhaps the setting adds to that sensation, but in movies, people don’t smell like almonds with a hint of bonfire smoke, they don’t make every kiss taste like it could be the last, they don’t have to pray to survive until the end.
It’s bad, it looks so bad, and Draco’s bleeding out, letting out soft, choked gurgles, and Harry doesn’t know what to do. There are footsteps in the background but he can’t lose his focus, he can’t let Draco die after everything they’ve been through.
he said those things, because of that little sliver of bitterness and grief in his voice, and all the things it could have meant.
“But that’s so pedestrian—”
“Maybe I’m too busy wanking myself,” Harry lies, and his cock twitches just like it does every time at the thought of listening in during one of Draco’s outrageously long showers. It’s either all teasing, or Draco has actually been touching himself a few feet away every other night, and Harry isn’t sure which his body is reacting to so viscerally.
Harry feels his face burn, an idea already forming in his head. Like a missing piece of a puzzle, it falls perfectly into place—Malfoy’s lecherous confidence, his suave, upper-class charms, and, as much as Harry would like to pretend it’s not the case, his infuriatingly good looks. He clears his throat. “You mean— That is. Er,” he stammers, hoping he won’t choke on his beer. The tables have turned and Malfoy seems to revel in seeing him squirm, and Harry welcomes the small sting of anger in his chest, easy and familiar to hold against him. It’s like getting a new job just for the thrill of something new—he’d rather stay in his lane for now, skeptical and a little mistrustful, than dive headfirst into the notion that Malfoy might see right through him.
“Fuck, Draco.” He moves closer to him on the couch and Draco nearly recoils, it looks like he’s nearly forcing himself to stay put, and Harry’s heart breaks a little. “Have you gone mad? I’m the one who should be apologising,” Harry says and he’s angry, at himself, at his stupid hot-headedness. “Fuck, I was such an arsehole. Everything I did I— I had no idea. And all this time—
“Malfoy,” Harry says, standing up, feeling his muscles pulse furiously around his wound; he’s dizzy with adrenaline and there’s blood in his peripheral vision. “Draco. Don’t kill him.”
“I don’t care about that,” Harry says.
Draco is the first one to break the silence. “Yes, so this happened, no use being coy now, I suppose.”
Malfoy smiles coyly, his perfect teeth flashing in the moonlight. Like a predator playing with his food, his tongue peeks out to lick his lips. “Some needed gold, some needed influence—I was able to make them believe they would get both. That their investment would pay off tenfold.” He grins, biting his lip. “And with some… I needed more of a
The girl grimaces. “He doesn’t sound evil.” This time, Harry actually snorts, earning himself a puzzled look from a middle-aged woman standing next to him.
Harry isn’t one to shun any scientific research or oppose progress in any way, but he can’t stop himself from despondently thinking it could have been any other plant and he would actually consider asking Amy out for another date. It’s difficult for a number of reasons—there’s no-one to blame for the situation, maybe except aunt Petunia and her reprehensible upbringing methods. Neville had no idea, Amy
“I’m. I’m sorry,” he says. There’s something in his voice, some strange sorrow-wonder in his tone that makes Harry’s heart too heavy for his chest as that gorgeous, scared boy still refuses to look them in the eyes. “I’ll just… go,” he states, and Harry wonders if there’s a question in there.
while they’re having sex maybe fifteen feet away. He’s clutching at Harry so hard it’ll probably leave bruises; all Draco can focus on are the most acute sensations—the deadly silence ringing in his ears, his cock throbbing in Potter’s arse, fingers massaging his tongue, and the stunning emerald of Potter’s wicked eyes, nearly all swallowed by pupil.
“Did they spike the pumpkin juice?” Draco frowned at that, and Potter laughed, a soft, private sound. “Wanted to do it for a while. Draco.”
The girl nods vigorously. “I turned our cat purple! My dad doesn’t believe I didn’t do it on purpose,” she says like it’s a burden she’s been carrying for far too long, and Harry bites the insides of his cheeks not to grin as a memory of a huge boa constrictor escaping the Little Whinging Zoo appears before his eyes. He absently thinks how much she’s going to love Hogwarts.
It’s the hottest thing he’s ever seen—Draco taking his cock like he’s hungry for it, gagging, and whimpering, and swallowing around it. Harry picks up the pace, his knuckles almost white with how hard he’s gripping the silver locks, and feels his orgasm getting closer, pleasure ripping through him in sizzling waves, mounting higher and faster, as he thrusts, and thrusts, and thrusts into Draco’s mouth.
Draco frowns, letting out a soft exhale. “Of course.”
“You don’t care.”
. Or, as Ron likes to call them, ‘those slippery bastards’.
“Right,” Draco says, biting down a grin.
“Fuck, yeah,” Draco groaned, clenching around the two fingers Harry had up his arse. “Your cock, now. Wanna feel it.”
Harry takes a few calming breaths, absently wishing the biscuits smelled a little stronger and feeling hopelessly stupid.
. Draco, who let out another quiet groan, whose eyes were nearly all pupil, who was biting his lip so hard it should have bled, and squeezing his cock through his trousers with a quiet hiss.
“That’s… hardly possible?” Harry says, wondering what on earth Draco means by that. “It’s just water. Is it bad?”
Harry doesn’t say anything save for an occasional hiss when he feels the soft, warm cloth touch a particularly sensitive spot; Draco’s hands work with surprising fluidity, skillfully cleaning everything up as he evidently tries to pay attention to Harry’s reactions. The whole scene feels surreal—Harry’s self-awareness can only stretch so far to accept he’s usually the one to provide, to care for others, and it has become such an integral part of his identity, he feels a tiny grain of panic nudging the back of his conscience. The unsettling feeling has accompanied him since his little outburst back at the beach, and now continues to prod at him as Draco Malfoy, of all people, tends to his wounds like he actually cares. Draco Malfoy, who nurtures his darkness like a new breed of an exotic animal, trying out both their limits, who talks like every day is another chapter of an adventure book, who, at the moment, is washing Harry’s blood off his fingers like it’s something sacred. Draco, who doesn’t notice the rusty stain of his own blood drying off in flakes from his hair, who’s seen the world but smells like home, who mocks kindness but embodies it at the tips of his fingers.
At that, Harry feels slightly annoyed. “Listen, this isn’t personal, but have you maybe thought you’ll actually
,” he says with a hint of sarcasm and Harry wonders what that’s about.
“Still got it!” Blaise shouts from the kitchen, and Pansy laughs, and drinks to that. Draco rolls his eyes.
He had filed a leave request due to the whole Antiques Roadshow project, seeing it was the Ministry itself that had ordered it, and his superiors at the Wizengamot not only asked he kept working from the Manor—the paranoid old bats wanted all the reports Flooed directly to them instead of having the papers owled, grumbling about interceptions and Muggle airplanes. Draco only rolled his eyes, yet to learn about an owl that flew that high.
Harry immediately responds with a flurry of curses, maintaining a
“At least we’re good at our jobs?” He tries.
“What do you say, Freddie,” he smiles at the little boy, “is Uncle Harry going to get his arse kicked? Yes, he is? Yes, he is!” Harry blows raspberries on the baby’s tummy and laughs as Freddie squeals with delight, swinging his pudgy baby fists in the air, almost knocking off Harry’s glasses in the process.
He breaks into a small smile. “Thank you, love.”
Harry’s heart stutters a little when in the corner of his eye he sees Draco’s face soften. “To… save my life, actually. And he did. More than once,” he says quietly, a soft smile tugging at his lips.
“Shut up,” Draco says, trying to thrust up into Potter’s grip, “shut the fuck up, god.”
,” Draco says, turning on the sofa to face his friend.
something he won’t be able to come back from. All those plans quickly go out the window though, when after such a long time of abstinence, Harry feels a pleasant buzz extending at the edges of his vision in soft bursts after only two shots, and instead of taking it slow, he decides to celebrate the feeling with two more to reach that blissful, longed-for numbness.
of his.
“What?” Hermione says weakly. “I mean— Actually, Ron and I—”
Malfoys hums thoughtfully. “No, that wasn’t their intent, wouldn’t want to get into trouble over some worthless Death Eater scum, now would they?” Harry looks at him in puzzlement and Malfoy rolls his eyes. “I can’t believe I have to explain this to you, don’t they check your wands?”
a challenge—the door to his office slams open and Ginny enters like a red-headed bulldozer with Luna skipping after her, her blond locks bouncing merrily, all in stark contrast to her girlfriend’s manic stance. Harry’s pretty sure Ginny kicked the door open but decides to let it go this time, in favour of hearing what happened to get her going so hard.
, making unholy sounds and whispering hot, forbidden things that make Harry blush even though Draco isn’t the only one with his cock in his hand and sin written all over his face afterwards.
“Yeah?”
Draco for the first time in what feels like years. How did he never notice how strikingly, devastatingly beautiful Draco is? He’s wearing a white shirt and a pair of trousers as usual, but he’s barefoot and Harry can’t remember if he’s ever seen Draco’s feet before—their slim arches and the long, slender toes dipping into the thick carpet—he looks so soft and domestic, and Harry realises he’s always liked seeing Draco be soft. His shirt is a little loose, two, no, three buttons open at the collar and Harry sees a thin pink scar peeking out, licking over his collarbone and for a moment, he forgets how to breathe.
Not slowing his steps, he takes off his sunglasses and puts them in his pocket. Piercing, silver eyes sweep around the Atrium, following a group of Aurors heading to a late lunch break; he quickly eyes the Floos, the guest exits, and all three Apparition points, memorising their exact location—cold, calculating and vigilant.
There’s a playful tug at the corner of her mouth. “Oh, I don’t know, is being tall and gorgeous wrong? Maybe there’s something you don’t like about six-packs?” Harry stares her down, exasperated. “Well. I mean, he’s reasonably built. Blonde hair, dresses well…”
He sees them through the large front window, hunched at a table in the very corner; it’s a smart move, he has to give them that—he wouldn’t have paid any attention if he didn’t know who he was looking for. Malfoy suddenly leans back and Harry finally recognises his companion—Blaise Zabini. He curses under his breath, trying to recall seeing the name in the Family’s files as several worst-case scenarios flash through his head. His instincts tell him to barge in there, wand blazing, Obliviate Zabini and drag Malfoy out by the scruff of his neck—what the fuck is he thinking? However, years of Auror work and a certain level of restraint Harry discovered he had developed with age stop him dead in his tracks. Seeing as Zabini isn’t exactly killing Malfoy, Harry decides to find a good vantage point, which ends up being an empty bench across the street and, with curiosity sparkling down his back, fully focuses on the monitoring spell Malfoy has clearly forgotten about.
Draco seems to be reading his mind—he still manages to flip Harry two fingers while in the middle of a coughing fit and gesture wildly to himself until Harry caves. He Summons a glass, fills it with a muttered Aguamenti and passes it to Draco.
A smirk. So two can play at this game after all. “It’s your lucky day.”
He casts a Warming Charm to dry the clothes, packs everything up and, without a word, comes up to Draco. A soft laugh escapes him at the face Draco makes when Harry cups his cheek with his palm and Apparates them straight back to the room.
“Hullo, sir, can I help you?” He asks, eyeing Harry with suspicion. Harry can’t really blame him, seeing that he basically came to the café, startled a waitress using only his face, walked in, stared at their only customer for Merlin knows how long, and is now slowly backing out of the establishment.
“It’s similar to a Slashing Curse but it has a… toxicity component, so to speak,” Draco explains. “It’s supposed to keep the wound from healing up naturally, to exhaust your opponent,” he says, picking up one of the bottles. He then mixes in a few drops from an amber bottle Harry can’t recall the label of. “This will be unpleasant,” he warns, corking the vial and giving it a shake.
Harry props himself on Draco’s shoulder and looks down at the book in his hands. “So, the maid?”
Draco nods. “I came back. And I know what you think—I came back for you. And while that is… well, correct”—he laughs nervously—“it was also for me, you know? And don’t get me wrong, I hated to feel self-serving yet again, and… what I’m about to say might sound selfish,” he says, looking at Harry with a frown.
That’s what the Death Eaters who escaped Azkaban did. They were the ones who lurked in the shadows, whispered orders, recruited fresh meat. The strategists, the planners, the ones who’d much rather dirty their hands with secrets and politics than blood and grime. Voldemort needed them for the power and influence over the uncertain ones, a tool to tip the scales with those too afraid, too undecided, but also with blood too pure and precious to be wastefully spilt.
“So,” Draco clears his throat. “No magic happened today?”
“Remember that first night?” he asks quietly, and Draco’s face changes—there have been a lot of
It doesn’t take long for Draco to start laughing too, the low, belly-deep rumble reverberating in the small room, crinkling the corners of his eyes and giving him an adorable, dopey look he would deny wearing under the threat of death. When they both calm down, Draco picks up the crumpled paper and unfolds it.
“Beautiful,” Draco whispers as he kisses down Harry’s back. He dips his tongue in each dimple below, eliciting a gasp from Harry. He can already feel his cock hard and leaking, tucked between his hip and the pillow and whimpers, trying to find some friction against the impossibly smooth sheets. “Shh,” Draco gently admonishes, “let me take care of you.”
Harry rolls his eyes, not entirely annoyed, and lets sleep take him.
“Are you sad?” the girl asks, looking up at Draco, her legs dangling from the bench. She must be seven at most, with pudgy, red cheeks and a tiny ponytail bouncing happily at the top of her head.
Harry paces outside of the quaint little café Luna excitedly sent him directions to, feeling like a madman. He wracks his brain for the reason he agreed to a bloody blind date in the first place. The only information he has is that the man’s name is Archibald (peculiar, but he’s seen worse), and that he’ll be waiting inside. Was Harry that drunk? Did they drug him? Imperius him? That would make him a poor Auror, wouldn’t it? And who would want to date a bad Auror, it’s unsafe and, frankly, a bit embarrassing. As if going on a blind date with Harry Potter in a Glamour wasn’t bad enough. He catches the cafe’s interior in the corner of his eye and sees a flash of a white tablecloth. Is he underdressed? Sure, it’s three in the afternoon and it’s definitely not a fancy place, but still. He wishes he had asked Draco before going. Draco would definitely know. He would also give him that fond, exasperated smile and tell him to
The last thing Harry had expected to hear was that the Malfoy line had Veela blood.
Draco made a broken sound at the back of his throat and folded himself tightly into Harry’s arms. The wings were gone, inconspicuously retracted back into Draco’s body as soon as they came, and all Harry could feel as he had Draco warm and sated in his arms, was the trails of oil warming Draco’s back.
“I think it's safe to say I win the pool,” he says calmly, trying not to grin too much.
The party had been, for lack of a better word,
“You aren’t going to tell him, are you?” He asks, voice muffled by the fabric of his trousers.
Draco laughs lightly, the sound slightly strangled with unshed tears. Harry stands, pulling Draco to his feet as he does.
Harry shrugs. “I don’t know what you want Draco, I don’t think I ever have.”
He doesn’t get an answer. There’s a tug on his tie, a step closer together and then lips on his.
The thought of Draco thinking that for years hurts more than the thought of him never loving him back. “That’s,” he starts, not quite sure how to word what he wants to say. “That’s such bullshit, I really need you to know that. It was never that for me, ever.”
. Harry feels much the same.
“Three years,” he states as if it’s not completely bizarre of him to have purchased a ring when their official relationship was still in its infancy. Ignoring Draco’s shocked expression, he plucks the box out of his hand and carefully removes the ring. “I always knew. Give me your hand.”
Rose taps him on the shoulder when the officiant starts speaking and he dutifully puts her down so she can run to sit with her dad in the front row. Ron grins at him, tears already streaming down his face. Molly is sitting next to him with baby Hugo on her lap, she’s gone past crying and straight into full-on sobbing. As expected.
“Do you ever go home?” Draco asked.
“That’s all, Ginny,” the air of finality in his tone rips through Harry’s chest.
“As do you.”
He’s going to put his godson down and launch Ron across the room if he keeps looking at him like that, like he’s an idiot who can’t see what’s right in front of him. He sees it, all too well. Draco Malfoy will never be in love with him.
“Piss off,” Harry turns away from the disaster happening across the room to level a grin at his friend, letting him know they’re good. He gets a nod in reply and then Ron’s off, presumably to dump Hugo on some poor unsuspecting Weasley relative.
Harry didn’t reply, couldn’t reply. Instead, he pushed Draco against the door, pressing himself against him moving his hands to the spot where the other man had dared to touch. This close, he could feel the second the other man melted into the touch. He wasn’t thinking straight, his head too clouded with alcohol and the jealousy he couldn’t explain clawing at every inch of his body. Gripping his waist like a lifeline, it was then that he did the unthinkable. Consumed by anger, jealousy,
“Are you going to stare at me all night or actually do something?” Draco asks, finally pulling the shirt off and dropping it to the floor. He steps closer to Harry then and works at his remaining buttons with impatient fingers.
He doesn’t realise that he’s standing frozen in the doorway until Draco places a hand on his cheek, bringing him back to life.
There’s nothing in this world or the next that he wants more than to make him laugh like this for the rest of his life.
“Fuck the rules,” he murmurs, stroking his thumb across the flushed cheek, marvelling at how warm it is. “Fuck them.”
Harry rolls his eyes. Pansy may well be a trained healer, but he will never let that woman near him with a wand. She’s been waiting to hex him for years.
supposed to mean.
“Don’t be a prick after you’ve just swallowed my cum in a broom closet, arsehole,” he says with a laugh, really not wanting any part in jokes about other men right now. Draco just grins in reply, perfect teeth on full show. Harry hates him.
“On the bed then,” he gives in, his own patience wearing thin. Draco goes without a fight, turning his back on Harry and pulling his underwear off, inviting him to look. He does, drinking in every inch of the bare skin. From his shoulders to the curve of his spine, to his pert arse, he’s perfect. If Harry weren’t so eager to get on with it, he’d drop to his knees and worship him until the sun streams through the crack in the curtains. That isn’t what either of them needs right now. That can wait for tomorrow, if there is a tomorrow for them.
Something snaps then, and before he can really register it Draco is straddling him, almost fully seated in his lap. He barely has a chance to breathe before there are lips on his, desperate and wanting. Draco’s hands are in his hair, tugging in a way that makes him groan into the kiss. He slides his own hands onto the thinner man’s waist, revelling in the way his hands fit so perfectly into the slight curve. Kissing him like this is still so new and yet it feels like they’ve been doing it for years, like they’ve tasted each other’s lips in every lifetime and it’s nothing but pure muscle memory now.
Unable to stop himself, he plants his hand next to Draco’s head and lowers himself down to capture the man’s lips in his own, hips still pounding into him. They kiss urgently, a messy clash of lips and teeth and panting breaths. It’s all too much, the warmth engulfing him, their tongues sliding against each other, Draco’s hand coming up to thread into his hair.
Harry frowns, reaching out to boop Rose on the nose. “I don’t think you’re allowed to say that word, little one,” he reprimands lightly.
Harry rolls his eyes, using his free hand to remove his glasses and throw them onto the dresser. He can see perfectly fine without them these days, only wears them because he feels naked without them.
Harry grabs the wandering hand, pulling it up to his mouth and biting a finger playfully before pressing a gentle kiss to it. Draco grins. “I’ve had you on your knees today—and while I wouldn’t usually say no to you and your mouth, it’s been a week since I’ve been inside you,” he explains, pulling Draco into him. “And that just won’t do.”
Draco is quiet beside him, his walls firmly back up and not a single readable thought on his lovely face.
The praise has him moaning around the intrusion and the sweet pleasure of it courses through Harry’s veins, causing him to thrust slightly into the wet heat. Draco doesn’t gag—something that never fails to get him going—and his pretty grey eyes look up at him, making eye contact before he nods slightly. Permission.
Teary eyes meet his. “I love it.”
He wants to kiss the look of surprise off of the other man’s face.
“I don’t know what you’re trying to say,” he confesses, silently begging Draco to look at him again. Everything hurts a little less when the silvery eyes are on him. “You have nothing to apologise for, if you want this to be over just tell me and go—what were you going to do? Write a letter and then never see me again?”
“So good for me,” he assures, so much more focussed on Draco than himself. “So tight and perfect and amazing,” he’s not even sure what he’s saying at this point, overwhelmed with the need to make Draco feel good.
Draco hasn’t said anything, still staring at the ring. “Do you like it?” Harry asks, suddenly unsure. “It’s uh—probably too late to return it now, but I can get you a new one if you don’t.”
Draco doesn’t answer, just walks away. Harry knows he’s supposed to follow. So he does.
“Shut up. Just tell him, Harry,” Ron says with a groan. “What have you got to lose? Really?”
He’s starting to wish he’d written something down. All of the countless other speeches he’s been asked—forced--to give over the years at various charity events and memorials were at least somewhat scripted for his own comfort. He’d spent many nights trying to write something for this, even just a brief outline or some vague bullet points, but to no avail. He’s completely winging it.
"Do you think Ginny will try and convince Luna to fuck at our wedding? As payback?"
Nobody notices them when they walk into the tent.
They didn’t speak for months. The hostile wall between them was back in full force, driving a wedge in not only their friendship but in the lives of everyone around them. Few people understood the reason for the sudden change, though some seemed to fit the pieces of their odd puzzle together far too easily.
Almost without thinking, he smiles. “A whole week without me and all I get in greeting is
“I hate you,” Harry declares with a groan before grabbing the blond man’s collar in a tight fist and pulling their faces together, all but smashing their lips together. Draco whimpers into his mouth and it tastes a lot like victory.
“Hermione’s chopping vegetables,” is what he says instead.
“You’re an idiot,” is all Draco says. Harry’s heart stops. “Of course I’ll marry you.”
“Mum knitted him a jumper.”
Before he can open his mouth to reply, fiery red hair comes into his vision. Fuck.
Harry tried. He tried to fix things between them but was met with stony silence and feigned indifference every time he approached the man.
When he looks back, he can’t even really pinpoint where it started. Malfoy had just turned up one day, at the Ministry, and hasn’t left Harry’s life since. They hadn’t spoken at first, had barely exchanged anything but frosty glares and the occasional nod, but then something changed. The turning point had been when Hermione, twenty-one going on forty, had decided that everyone needed to get along. She’d organised a party, tearing through Grimmauld Place like a whirlwind setting it up, and invited everyone from their year at Hogwarts and then some. Harry had been powerless to stop it, never one to get on the wrong side of Hermione when she’s set on something.
“What did you think I was going to say? I’ve been hinting for at least two years,” Draco says, exasperated with Harry’s insecurity. “Your obliviousness might be a medical problem, I’ll have Pansy look you over when we get home.”
“I’ll uhh—I’ll take my leave,” Ginny murmurs awkwardly, running a hand through her short hair. “Should probably go rescue my wife from Mum before she drowns her.”
“Potter again, is it?” Harry counters, feeling some twisted sort of victory in the way it makes Draco flush. Neither of them moves, continuing to stare each other down from across the room.
Now, it’s somewhere between midnight and one am and they have yet to fall asleep. Harry’s not far off, lying on his side and blinking up at his boyfriend, wondering how the fuck he manages to read like that; with only the dim glow of a lamp between them and the dark of the night. As always, he’s beautiful. Even like this—especially like this—tired and focused on something other than him, hair tucked behind his ear to stop it from falling into his face.
“Am I not allowed to make friends now?” The other man asks, shattering the peace. He’s leaning against the side of the tent, the fabric not giving at all against his weight. Magic, probably.
Ten years ago, amongst war and loss and facing an uncertain future, all he knew was that he loved her. It was foolish naivety, a relationship borne of a need to be part of a family he had already been welcomed into but that didn’t stop it from feeling utterly real. After their inevitable and final breakup, their relationship had blossomed into what it was always meant to be, familial and strong. Ginny became the woman he always thought she would be, getting drafted into the Holyhead Harpies before she’d even finished her NEWTs and proving every day how wonderful she is. Luna had thought so too, their relationship coming out of nowhere but somehow making complete sense. Harry is endlessly supportive of them.
“Harry?” A concerned voice cuts through the fog in his brain. He can’t respond, only vaguely registers someone pulling him by the arm, helping him move through the crowd. He isn’t aware of anything until he’s being sat down somewhere.
me—he’s the one who made up the bloody rules. It’s not like that and it never will be.”
“My father almost died,” he says, voice thick. “I got an owl from Azkaban, and my mother she—she broke. Like, really broke. She threw me out of the manor, changed the wards, told me I didn’t do enough to stop him from being put in there. She didn’t mean it, she was just so broken she couldn’t think straight, but I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t go to Pansy or Blaise—they’re great and they love me but they don’t
“That he loves you,” Ron answers simply.
Harry nods, keeping one hand on his hip and using the other to line himself up. They both groan when he presses the tip in, the tight heat clenching around him. He waits for a moment before pushing in further, marvelling at how perfectly they always manage to fit together. Slowly, never wanting to hurt him even unintentionally, he’s fully in. He thanks God or whoever for the invention of protection potions, can’t imagine having something between them in this moment. It always amazes him how much being inside Draco feels like coming home. Even the first time, when there was nothing between them but newfound amicability and surprising lust, it had felt so much more intense than with anyone else he’d been with. Now, years of laughter and fights and falling later, it’s unfathomable bliss.
He’d thought as much. Pulling his legs up to his chest, he wraps his arms around himself and rests his chin in the dip between his knees. He’s tired, more than anything. “Draco…”
“The children are just inside those doors, you insufferable twat.”
In truth, they are both far too gone for each other. They bicker and tease and actually argue often, but most people can’t stand to be in a room with them for more than an hour or two. More than once, they’ve had to be reminded that other people exist; too lost in each other to acknowledge anyone else. If someone were to tell him at the start of all this that this is where they would be so many years down the line, he’d probably have hexed them into oblivion. He wouldn’t change a thing, knows Draco wouldn’t either no matter how much he protests.
He sees Draco then. Three rows back sat between a seemingly already drunk Pansy and a bored Blaise. He’s not looking at Harry, though there’s a slight flush on his cheeks that suggests he may have been. Harry curses every person sitting in front of the blond man, obscuring his view of anything but the pretty face and a slither of his shoulders. Even just from that, he knows he looks good. He always does.
“Fuck,” he bites out, hoping to God or Merlin or whoever that Draco had the foresight to put a silencing spell up.
Draco sighs, “Why do I have a feeling you’re about to say something stupid?”
“All good in there?” He teases, a smile playing at the edge of his lips.
Draco shrugs, jolting them both lightly. “I don’t know,” he answers. “I saw you and it just felt right, I knew I would be safe with you.”
“What are you two little monsters up to?” He questions, reaching out to tickle Hugo, earning him a delighted squeal. “What have you done with uncle Draco?”
The smugness radiating off him is almost suffocating. If he wasn’t so desperately in love he’d find it repulsive. He’s playing with Harry’s tie, completely messing it up. “What if my mouth was busy all week?” He ponders with a smirk. “There were a lot of lonely men on the trip.”
Draco laughs, low and dangerous. “No, you just bend them over your desk.”
“Of course not, dear,” he says with the tone of someone talking to a senile old man. Harry loves him so much it hurts.
“Okay—“ he starts.
Draco whines when he presses another open-mouthed kiss to his neck, sucking lightly. “Please,” he begs. “I want that—forever.”
Harry decides to play along. “And I don’t feel eager to you?” he questions, pulling his fingers almost all the way out, only to push them in again; hard and deep. Draco moans, high and breathy.
Resigning himself to his fate, he pulls himself up and sits against the headboard, reaching a hand out to fumble in the drawer at the side of the bed. He finds it quickly, pulling the box out and holding it in his hands awkwardly. It’s a stunning emerald green velvet with a silver clasp, the box itself worth more than he’ll ever admit. Draco looks at it as if it might bite him.
Harry can’t remember how it went from that to Draco bent over his desk moaning his name. The whole thing was a blur of frantic touches and ripped clothes and the sound of their breathing. It wasn’t supposed to become a thing, but it did.
“We better go tell them your mission was successful, hmm?” He asks the children, smiling when they waste no time jumping off the bed.
By the time he enters, the kids are somehow already sitting at the table tucking into sandwiches. Hermione is standing at the kitchen island, humming to herself as she chops a terrifying amount of greens for what he presumes to be a salad. Ron is fiddling with something at the end of the table, a hunk of metal and wires that looks vaguely muggle. He looks more and more like Arthur every day.
Coming out of the home he’d found in Draco’s neck, he pulls back far enough to see him, their faces close. “You’re so beautiful,” he murmurs, the words barely audible above the sound of Draco’s breathing.
“Merlin, you’re a mess,” he laughs.
The moment it hit, he felt like the world was going to end. They were sitting in Harry’s office, Draco lounging in the big plush armchair in the corner as if he belonged there, sunlight streaming through the window and kissing his skin. He was reading, a small smile on his face as he skimmed the pages, and Harry couldn’t look away. He realised, in that moment, that this was their new normal. Draco wasn’t there to fuck, or to fight, he was there because he felt comfortable there, in that room, with Harry.
Draco laughs. It’s not the usual sweet melody of a laugh, it’s dark and bitter and it twists into Harry’s gut like a knife. “You’re an absolute fucking fool, Harry Potter.”
“If only it were easy to block you out,” Draco says, though he leans in to bring their lips together in a quick peck immediately after. “You’ve been sleeping so late, are you feeling okay? Should we go home?”
“I thought you knew me better than that,” he says, accusation leaking into the words. “But clearly not. Clearly, you are as much of an oblivious prick as everyone says.”
“You—fuck,” he stutters as Harry repeats the move, smirking. “I just want you,” another broken moan as Harry just barely grazes his prostate, refusing to give him what he needs. “I need you in me. Please.”
Harry scoffs. “Easier for who? You?” He questions, voice edging on angry. He’s not even sure himself how he feels, if it’s anger or hurt or just emotional exhaustion. “Break my heart without having to see the fallout?”
“Do you ever stop staring at him?”
Once satisfied he’s done his job, he pulls back to look at the mark. The skin is red and slightly wet with spit and he knows that by morning the blooming bruise will be unmistakable. His cock twitches at the thought of it. Tearing his eyes away from the spot, he looks right into Draco’s blown eyes. There’s no anger to be found, just
but after a week of not being able to touch him, he’s not in the mood to play. Right now, Draco is sitting with Dean and Seamus, laughing at something one of them said. Harry’s struck once again by how beautiful this man is. It’s hard for him to imagine a day when he won’t be in awe of how affected he is by every aspect of him.
make me happy. It’s as simple as that,” Harry states.
, beside me, always.”
It’s still dark when he wakes.
“We were friends before I fucked you, Malfoy.” He’s playing into the game now, doing what Draco wants him to do and biting back.
Draco looks at him properly, some of the worry seemingly easing now and in its place something that looks a lot like fear. His eyes are wide and disbelieving and so beautiful that Harry almost forgets how to breathe. Inching closer slowly enough to give Draco the option to move away, he brings their lips together again.
His eyes find Draco quicker than he means for them to. There’s a small smile on his face, the one he’s only ever used for Harry, and it spurs him on. Somehow, he tears his eyes away before he continues. “Love isn’t something I ever really understood—watching everyone couple up after the war, I thought you were all a bit mad,” his voice is teasing and everyone chuckles. “I thought I was missing some crucial piece of information, some reason that I just couldn’t see,” he looks at Draco again before turning back to the brides. “I get it now. Love isn’t just about not wanting to be alone, it’s so much more than that. I see it in the way you talk about each other, in the way you still love each other so deeply even when you’re fighting and I have to deal with Ginny bursting my floo open at stupid o’clock in the morning—“
Overwhelmed, he pulls away and buries his face in Draco’s neck, nipping at the spot where the long line of his neck meets his collarbone. “You feel so fucking good,” he groans, muffled. Draco tugs at his hair gently. “Think I could stay inside you forever,” he confesses.
?” he chides without turning to look at the man, though he so desperately wants to.
He’s painfully sober, not having had much time nor much want to drink until this very moment. There were some attempts at dancing, very painful ones mainly thanks to his partner being one glass away from falling over—namely Molly.
“Then you’re going to take me home and fuck me,” he breathes with a whine, like he always does when he’s trying to get a rise out of Harry. He twitches in Draco’s hand and the cocky twat just smirks.
Falling in love with Draco Malfoy wasn’t something he chose to do. Continuing to love him, through the pain of perceived unrequited feelings, through screaming arguments and Prophet headlines and silent treatments, is a choice he would make a thousand times. In every lifetime, over and over again, he would choose to love Draco. Without hesitation.
“It’s been what, five years?” Ron asks. Harry just nods, not seeing what that has to do with anything. “You’ve been sleeping together for five years, he’s at Grimmauld basically every night—he comes to Sunday dinner Harry.”
“All good?” He checks, the fear of pushing just a little too far not yet subsided.
“Why?” He counters. “Give me one good reason why you need to be writing God knows what at five o’clock in the morning when you could be fast asleep, in bed, with me.”
“I’d like to just say again, I hate you,” he tells him, looking down at him. He looks like sin.
falls so easily past his lips. How lovely the word sounds in his voice. It is their home. It has been since the first time Draco left his favourite coat hanging on the coat stand, half of his closet following soon after. Everything in that house has been touched by the both of them, the walls knowing Draco’s name as well as they know his.
“No,” he stops him with another kiss to his knuckles. “I love you, that’s not something you can argue your way out of. I’ll love you whether you accept it or not. You can leave right now, we can end this and try to be friends somehow—but I’m asking you to give me a chance to prove to you just how much I adore you.”
Harry laughs, swatting his arm gently before resuming running his fingers along it; soothing. “It’s nothing bad! I just—there’s something that’s bugging me.”
Harry knows he doesn’t mean it—can’t mean it—but that doesn’t stop it from going straight to his gut. He doesn’t respond. They stay like that for a while, Harry pounding into him relentlessly and kissing every spot he can reach, Draco’s neck arched to give him access. His legs hook around Harry’s back, pushing him somehow even deeper, and the hand not twisted in his brunet locks grips his arm like a lifeline.
He startles, almost waking Hugo up in the process. “Fucking hell Ron, do you want me to drop your child? Do you and your wife walk around with fucking silencing charms on?” He questions angrily, glaring at his best friend. His heart is pounding from the scare.
“What are you laughing at?” Draco demands, a slight flush colouring his cheeks. There’s something in his demeanour that suggests he thinks Harry’s laughing
“Hugo incoming.”
," recalls, chuckling to himself at the memory. “It was hilarious, watching them dance around each other for weeks with rings in their pockets at all times, waiting for the right moment to pop the question—part of me wanted to break and tell them, a much bigger part wanted to see who would get there first.”
Harry shrugs, watching the snow fall. “I never cared—about people knowing.”
It’s a lie, a part of their game and yet Harry can’t stop the hurtling pit in his stomach, sinking deeper and deeper. He doesn’t know if Draco has ever strayed, had always been too scared to ask even before he’d known how he felt and now it’s too late.
“Marry me?”
Harry’s shocked. He doesn’t know what he expected. Grimmauld had only been unprotected for days at that point, the fidelius charm no longer necessary in his eyes and more of an annoyance than anything else. It had taken years to find out how to remove it.
The aged house-elf is there in a moment, standing at the side of the bed with his head bowed. Harry rarely calls for him. These days, he gives him tasks every now and then and lets him take care of the house in general just to keep the peace.
Ginny’s grin dims significantly, a frown etching its way onto her pretty face. She levels Draco with a questioning look. “What? You’ve—Everyone’s had their suspicions for years—what do you mean
, he kissed along the expanse of Draco’s arched neck and sucked a mark into the pale skin.
“Harry, Draco,” the nod she gives them both in return is accompanied by a grin almost as wide as her face. They’re in trouble and it seems Draco senses it too, his entire body freezing next to Harry’s.
“Cold,” Draco gasps out, flinching slightly. Harry presses a kiss to his cheek, then another to his forehead, whispering a tender apology.
“I’m awake,” he grumbles, rubbing his eyes and shifting into a seated position against the headboard. Thankfully, he’s dressed.
The first time he broke a rule was about six months in when he accidentally, whilst under the influence of almost an entire bottle of Firewhiskey, told Hermione and Ron about their situation. They were scarily unbothered by the revelation, only sharing a knowing look that Harry was far too gone to analyse.
