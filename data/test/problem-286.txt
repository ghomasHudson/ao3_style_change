"It was just a suggestion," Harry counters. "I'm happy to get you off in any room of the house."
Harry grins, noting that Draco hadn't argued with the idea of a 'next time'. He draws Harry into a kiss before he can come up with a retort, and any thoughts of further banter fade from his mind. He hears a cap opening and barely has time to wonder when Draco had a chance to acquire lube before Draco's hand is moving down, slicking over his cock. It's tantalizingly slow at first, though Harry can appreciate the attention at the head of his cock, teasing at the slit and rubbing just under the head. But soon he needs more. He pulls out of the kiss to say so, but Draco beats him to it, gripping him tight and speeding up his strokes.
"I guess it's not a terrible way to spend an afternoon," he says, picking up his wand and twirling it. He stands up with a stretch, and when he relaxes he finds Draco watching him with amusement. They move furniture out of the way in the sitting room and take position opposite each other. Harry eyes the space, strategizing. "How long are we going? Until the first hit?"
"You could put your hands on me next time, you know," Harry says, stretching out next to Draco. "Spare your sheets."
At first, it was just to keep an eye on things—both to make sure Malfoy remained on his best behavior in the Muggle village, and to assure himself that the new Ministry wasn't as useless as the previous one.
Once he finally kicks free of his trousers, Harry crawls onto the bed over Draco, his hand immediately reaching for Draco's cock. "
"Yeah?" Draco asks invitingly.
Sixth year. It's hard not to think about that night in the bathroom, and the curse he'd unwittingly flung. "Draco—"
"Ha! Almost got me with that one," Draco quips after deflecting a purposely misdirected stinging hex aimed against a mirror.
Harry's uncomfortably hard, his hips pushing forward almost without a thought to find some friction. From the muffled groan that Draco makes against his lips, Harry thinks he needed some relief too.
"Fuck," he mutters, adrenaline still coursing through him as he struggles within his sudden bindings. They aren't tight—in fact, his wild mind finds the feeling quite pleasant—but he won't be getting out of them anytime soon without help. His wand lies helplessly on the floor.
So now, during his visits that are becoming increasingly more frequent, there are also duels. They grow longer and longer as they learn—and defend against—each other's tells, and despite his best efforts, Harry never walks away from one without feeling at least a little bit turned on.
And, of course, that moment of vulnerability is all Draco needs to hit him with a new spell—one Harry doesn't recognize, but quickly brings him to his knees as ropes twine around his body, binding his wrists and ankles together.
"That's not what I meant," Draco says with an eye roll. "When I made the suggestion, it was meant to be an outlet for magic. I've had friendly duels with dozens of people over the years.
Racking his brain, he suddenly remembers one night with the DA, how Luna had used a showy spell to knock him off his guard. He waits for an opening and sends the spell Draco's way, a harmless jet of light to draw the eye as it bounces off the shield charm, providing a priceless moment of distraction to get in a real spell. All Harry needs is a Jelly-Legs Jinx, aimed right for the calves. Draco falls to his knees instantly.
"You—" Draco accuses, his face flushed with a bemused expression.
Harry would be lying if he said he wasn't. He's been spending his time and energy doing drudge work for what feels like years now, but in reality has only been a couple of months. The thought of an actual challenge—a magical and a mental one—is so refreshing it's almost pathetic.
"You're a menace," Draco says, but he relaxes under Harry's touch and rests his arm next to Harry's. Harry is smiling as he falls peacefully to sleep.
"Do you yield?"
, Harry," Draco mutters, clutching at him and pumping his hips into his grip. "I never thought—
He feels Draco take a deep breath of his own. "I don't suppose I get a say in this? I did actually hope to get some things done today."
After the standard count, their spells start flying. Harry doesn't have time to identify everything Draco throws at him, but his shield charms are as sharp as ever, and he goes through his standard roster of hexes before realizing if he wants to breach Draco's defenses, he'll have to think outside the box. Their magic builds up quickly in the room, deflected charms and hexes seeming to crackle in the air and make the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. He could easily be mesmerized by the atmosphere and the look of steely determination on Draco's face, but he doesn't let himself get distracted.
Harry swallows thickly, unable to ignore the heat in Draco's eyes. "I—" He struggles again pointlessly, a gasp falling from his lips when the movement causes his cock to get just enough friction against the seam of his trousers. Draco arches a brow. "What if I didn't?"
Draco's eyes flew open.
"No one likes that metaphor, Draco. It was never funny." Blaise says it harshly, but there's just the tug of a smile behind the words, like as long as Draco hits the right buttons, he'll gain access to Blaise's misguided and alcoholic optimism.
They took the portkey which then led to Lupin's office, which Draco was pleasantly surprised to find was well decorated with a thought out lay out. He surveyed it with vague interest, not letting his eyes fall for too long on one thing. Grey stuck close to Draco's legs, clearly agitated at this hideous turn of events. Draco supposed Grey had never needed to use a portkey, him being a kelpie that would most likely be fought and killed on sight.
Then it had broken, but not gradually. It was like a beautiful crystal glass you had on display that someone accidently knocked. Aidan watched it tumble in slow motion to the floor, watched it shatter into a million pieces without being able to lift even a finger against it.
-"He was cut off because his mother was hugging him. He panted into the frosted air, arms hanging lame by his sides. She was weeping, he realised. His mother never showed off signs of any human emotion. Not usually.
"Good that you don't need them when you have us." Blaise commented, reaching across the table to pat her head and ruffle he hair which she protested at with a loud swear. The moment was over almost as soon as it started, and Pansy went back to bitchily flicking her hair.
"Mr. Williams, are you proposing that we allow him to keep the creature?" It was the surly man who had been leading the group. Draco took his hands away from Grey's muzzle and moved them down to his neck, patting it gently. Mud caked off.
"I'm not sure mother, but I'll call you to confirm." He nodded and stepped out of the car. He always saw her as steady and constant. He now saw her as she had really been all along. A melancholic mother with a son who barely met up to any of his father's expectations, trying to keep herself afloat.
"Oh come on, you didn't get a clue?" Draco asked, straightening himself a little. Pansy looked disappointed in a subtle way that only the three of them could really do. "Of course, you're amazing though Pans. Any idea who the boy toy is?" She perked up again at the mention of gossip.
"A trap!" Someone called out, and soon it was a flurry of yelling at how it was a bad idea to bring him along, and that he should probably be murdered. Draco sighed. People were so vanilla with their insults nowadays. He'd heard all of them at least ten times before. He had to admit though, it was exceedingly weird that on the day of his release he would be taken by aurors to 'bust a black market'. Something had to be up. Slurs were hurled at him, but he stood, chin thrust out in disdain.
There. He grabbed the object in front of him with his mind's eye. Everyone was standing behind him, he was at no danger of having them see his face. The glamor in just his eyes dropped, revealing their silver iridescence and he whistled once for Grey to come. He obeyed.
"What happened to 'potentially dangerous'?" Draco's expression darkened sourly and he exchanged a look with Grey, mouthing the word: 'busted'.
"What harm can a kelpie really do when under supervision? Wizards aren't at a risk from being killed by them, and I doubt there are any muggles on the property of Malfoy manor in the middle of no-where in Wiltshire." Draco made a noncommittal half laugh that did not reach beyond Grey who watched him sceptically. He really was rather fucking tall, Draco thought, stroking his neck and wondering how on earth one would mount a horse this large. He zoned out of the rest of the argument, though it couldn't have lasted very long because his fingers weren't as filthy as they should have been if they had left it for a while. Draco hoped Grey didn't mind water magic, because he was definitely going to need pressure washing.
"I'm in the bedroom, the doors are open." He called back, though it carried more in the tone of a murmur. She emerged seconds later wearing a new dress and still damp hair, albeit immaculate.
"Did you really think Pansy didn't know too? We've known for a while we just," He broke of, pulling himself up more, rubbing his hand over his face. "We just never mentioned it. We thought you'd tell us." Draco withdrew his leg silently and in long, snake like motions. Blaise let it go easily. He looked at Draco. "You're like a dancer when you move like that."
"Why don't you open it for us?" It was a predatory smile. It was the same one Lucius used to have. Draco scowled at him, but made no further comment as he tapped the tree in the right places. There was an awful creaking noise as the bark pulled away to reveal the one way opening that led to the market, noises of shouting and the hope of illegal salesmen drifting unsatisfactorily from it. Draco went to turn around, to say 'There, you see?', but all he saw were hands shoving him roughly back. His reflexes were good, but not good enough, so all he was able to before hitting the floor was twist himself around so that he might land on his hands rather than his spine. He tried to push himself up, but once his eyes met the crowd who had heard the 'thunk' of his body, he froze. Someone somewhere shouted to catch him, and a few eyes definitely recognised him from a previous incident, grins widening like a cats. He only managed to push himself up and reach a fighting stance as they struck.
"He won't be there." Narcissa looked at him softly.
you on about? We share a room, Weasel, get over yourself." Was his curt response, and a snort of laughter came from Blaise's bed. Weasley gave him such a filthy look that it was almost comical. Harry reached a hand out of his own curtains (this surprised Draco, because normally he slept like the dead)
"Well, it would be inappropriate for us to stay at a prisoners household," The sour looking woman said, sniffing as though both of them were beneath her. Narcissa raised an eyebrow, drawing herself up.
"Didn't they tell you?" He asked, gazing at Draco with supreme curiosity.
"Yes, I do happen to have one, seeing as one is required for Hogwarts. The auror escorting me said it was allowed, so I took that as allowance." He spoke eloquently, but they both knew what would happen if it did transpire he was lying. Lupin needn't of asked though; Malfoy manor had been heavily warded from the vast exterior after the wall, creating a sort of perimeter that would only allow select members through, and would notify the aurors if any 'illegal' spells were being used. Lupin nodded and began walking to the edges of the outdoor wards. Draco followed suit.
"I'd rather have you guide the way, or else, who knows what I could get up to." Lupin raised an eyebrow in what could have been a smirk, had he not been so surprised.
" Harry said, sounding incredulous and also unsure as to what he himself was addressing. Things like this were hard to recover from, perhaps easier if it had just been Blaise, perhaps more so if it were Harry. There were three of them here, though, and he couldn't employ his usual tactics.
"Love, what's wrong? Where's Aidan?" His mum asked, pushing forward slightly, looking far more awake than his dad, and then he was a twenty two year old crying into his mother's arms as she gently rubbed his back. "Harry, what's happened?" Her voice was quiet and soothing, and none of the men looked like they really know what to do. Harry wasn't sure what to do either.
"How dare you. These bags under my eyes accentuate my good looks and make all the women desire me. Ever heard of case project?" He asked, and to his credit, he did not sound in the least bit lacking, just normal. Pansy gave him an almost pitying look before she grabbed his glass of red wine.
The prospect of an actual father seemed so glorified to Nikolai that he didn't dare doubt the gift that had been lain in front of him. Damien watched him with a childish envy that still seemed to not interrupt their relationship, but Nikolai felt it. Lucius had swept in everyday of the week to whisk Nikolai somewhere new and exciting, and Nikolai loved the unconditionality of it.
"God no. Had a fucking fit when I came home for the first time, and besides, the Blacks aren't veelas." Lupin could see it, see it clearly. He was avoiding asking what he meant, because talking to Draco was like stalking a wild animal. Step on too many sticks and they get spooked, run off.
As always, thank you so much for reading, and please do leave a comment if there is anything you particularly liked/disliked, or just because, because I absolutely love reading comments and tbh I need a little love right now lmao!
"I didn't want you to die there, I'm not that bad despite what the papers may offer." He hadn't dared asked for the prophet, imagination spurring a small panic that constricted his chest when thinking of what they may have written about him. Grey didn't seem convinced. Draco threw his head back in annoyance. "Here, look." He let the glamor drop away from his body entirely. "I'm like you." Grey's eyes grew wide and his hands fluttered at his sides, aching, Draco was sure, to touch him.
"I don't know who they were, Harry. I'd tell you if I did, of course I would darling, but as it stands, I really don't know what you want me to do." His pace matched that of a caught rabbit. This was wrong. Aidan never acted like this, he used darling as a word he would roll off the tongue in a charmingly posh drawl, not at all in a rushed panic, as if it were the only thing keeping Harry's pure malice off him. Harry hated it. He started to shout.
"We're not gong to talk about that, are we?" It was phrased as a question, but Blaise said it like a statement.
The door slammed shut behind him, and he carried Draco as quickly and as carefully as he could to the rooms he remembered that they had used previously; the parlour and the bathroom. He lay Draco in the marble bath and took a moment to stare at him. He had no idea what to do, he realised. As a kelpie, he had only ever had to kill humans, to devour them.
Once he had his wand back and had managed to fix his arm (and his hypothermia, as it turned out), he decided that there ought to be an order of business which was as thus follows:
"Well darling, welcome to the Malfoy estate." He drawled, throwing his arms wide in what could have been a sarcastic gesture. Grey's facial expressions seemed to match the ones he made as a horse and came together as a sort of half way frown. "First matter of business is cleaning you up, and then we can talk about living arrangements." Draco didn't watch Grey's expression, he just turned away and strode toward the manor. A peacock trilled from the garden and he was hit with a sudden rush of fear. "Don't touch the peacocks unless you would like to meet a swift demise."
." She snarled at him, not really all that upset with him, and they all knew it.
"Did you want to sit down so that we can talk about this?" Lupin offered, pretending that Draco had not mentioned his 'lover' in a rather odd jest. Spook. That was the words. He hated that word, the inferences you could get, the notion that he was simply an animal that was to be danced around. He wanted to growl again, but he'd just end up setting himself off. He took the chair, seating himself on it as hostile as possible, as if to protect himself from any invasive questions. Once he made sure that Draco was 'happily' seated, he began. "So your father, then. I don't want to push you, but everything you say is useful." And to this, Draco could find only one response in his head, a response that happened to be 'suck my ass'. He did not voice his opinion.
"Go back." He snarled at Lupin, who in turn cocked his head. "Step back!"
oh-um hello.
The talk was polite an civil, hostile in the way it avoided anything serious, anything that mattered. Draco watched his mother with eyed curiosity and decided, eventually, to broach the topic of his father.
"I- yes I suppose." The words seemed to shock Lupin into working, but not very well. "Have you, uh, been told who you're sharing with?" Draco raised an eyebrow.
"Malfoy." A voice said from the other side of the room. It was the Weasel, glaring at him from the safety of bed.
"See Draco, I think you were abused, by your father I expect. I think he did something to you." Lupin's voice sounded almost like honey, and if he lingered to long he'd get stuck. That certainly wasn't the question he had anticipated, and the shock left no room in him for a crude response. He just sat there eying Lupin who looked almost sad. Draco didn't deny, no matter how much he wanted too. His breathing pace quickened and then slowed, and he glared helplessly at his shoes. Lupin didn't say anything; Draco couldn't even hear him move, but when he looked up again, Lupin was seated in the chair next to Draco, on the wrong side of the desk.
It filled quickly with warm water that curled and steamed, green and blue mixing pleasingly against the white backdrop. The potions he used in he bath were held in ornate crystal glasses, antique and expensive, frivolous gifts from the south of France that they had visited when Draco was thirteen. He turned around and commanded Grey to change into the shorts provided. In turn, he rolled up the ends of his trousers to his knees and took off his jacket, rolling up also the sleeves of his shirt. Grey, to Draco's high amusement, looked rather haughty and embarrassed at that.
Half of the entrance hall now seemed to be wet, the storm outside blowing in and swirling through the manor in an sharp whistle. There was blood on the stairs and at the bottom of them. Grey didn't know what to do.
A note reading 'Keep it.'
Did I have to change the chapter notes because this was supposed to be out a lot earlier? Yes. Did I procrastinate writing this by taking my brother into town to piss him off? Also yes. I have such poor time management skills that I'm actually famous for my many excuses.
"My son. My son! You perfect miracle, you're going to fix everything!" He exclaimed, grabbing Nikolai and twirling him, as fathers often do with their sons. Nikolai giggled and held on tighter. Marie had smiled ruefully from behind them, watching with a longing glint in her eye. She had shown Lucius back Nikolai's room and they had sat down on the shoddy bed which creaked and waned under their combined weight.
He didn't go far, for much, per se. He just slipped back into old habits, accidently. He knew, incidentally, where to go, what to buy, and had the money. He clutched his pocket. Heroine. He'd taken it before, on numerous occasions. Never with Harry, though.
"Granger." Pansy responded, high (and mighty), but doing her best to dull down her glare. Granger sat down rather awkwardly in one of the armchairs, indicating that it was time for them to leave. Draco unwound himself from Pansy's shoulders and walked over to Blaise. "Well, good luck, then. Merlin knows boys can't be on time for anything. See you." Granger seemed to smile at that, giving a small wave.
Opened the front door. Looked back.
"Can you prove that he isn't dangerous?" He asked, and amused expression on his face. Draco stuck his chin out and folded his head to the right.
"Yes?" He responded. Answers often needed to be coaxed out. It was either something vulnerable, or something that he didn't want to hear. He guessed that it was the latter.
We will be returning to Hogwarts in the next chapter, but for now, here's some of Narcissa and Draco's relationship for you after the quite awful first meeting that they had! Sorry that it's a bit of a shorter chapter, my life is absolutely hectic at the moment!
They were supposed to be going shopping, and, as it turned out, there was another 'political' dinner that the three of them would be attending, the perfect time placement for it. They drove in silence through the brightening day, through the bustle of the London traffic and the stress that Narcissa was clearly not coping well with. Familiar scenery came into view.
"Very well, thank you." Her voice was quiet, but not subdued. She was afraid of speaking out of place, but she knew better than to let that show, especially in front of aurors. They stayed silent for a while after that, just sitting there in the misery of their lives and the holding cell of a ministry prison. Draco wanted to scowl. "Draco," Narcissa said again, and then stopped.
The traders did not even come close to Draco, they just paced and threw spells which he dodged with varying success. The aurors, after a few seconds of this, charged through and hurled their own back, but not without a few 'accidental' missteps and shoves to his body. Sam helped him to the side.
"I'm sorry, I don't quite follow." He ground out, willing himself not to snap at the next person to walk in.
He was surprised at how pliable Grey was beneath his hands, how his head would turn this way and that as he tried to do up the bridle. He supposed that Grey was just doing it so that it could escape. Draco supposed he would have done the same. It was awfully fiddley through the bars of the cage, and he couldn't quite move as he wished, but wishing was for those with the luxury of a backdrop to see to. If he went away wishing, he supposed he'd be looking very kindly upon the roof of the manor. He pushed away the thought.
His chest heaved with each step, quivering breaths not quite powering through his adrenaline. The cold stung, some part of him thought, as his fingers grazed the surface and he began to wade more than walk. Everything started to calm down. It was still loud, and the sound overpowered his ears, but now it was just the pound of rain against the lake. The screaming became shallower, lighter till it was no longer there, and the weight on his chest seemed to ease up and let him breath easier. His father was no longer telling him to beg for his life in English, a language he barely understood. The hot pain in his arm slowed and soothed to a cold numbness, and his clouded head seemed to flood with clear serenity.
"I would hope you've been briefed on that already, but no. Right now, I'd like to talk about you." Draco felt the cage around him: the worst possible outcome. He groaned internally.
As soon as he was out, the aurors directed him to the side-along apparition point, but made note not to touch him. They were still very close, of course, but they didn't touch him. The auror who'd taken him from Azkaban (Sam, Draco remembered) smiled at him from Draco's left side. It wasn't cruel though, it was warm.
Ought he just to have said 'No.' himself? He doubted that was even an option, doubted it was contusive for his survival, and really, didn't he have to survive? He didn't really want to survive. Dying seemed to be the much more simple solution. (He had, unfortunately, sworn off dying if he could help it. Goodbye peace, he thought.)
He would wake up and shower, get dressed and read for a while in his parlour before greeting his mother downstairs for a nine thirty breakfast. He would then get changed again and go out riding on Grey until lunch which would be then spent in the kitchen in the domestic style of lunch and cooking. The time between lunch and dinner would then also be spent with Grey whilst he read, studied and wrote off to his friends, after which time he would retire to his mother's parlour for a small dinner that mainly consisted of sandwiches.
Now we get more into the action! We have finally reached present day, and from this point, we'll probably be switching from Draco to Harry's p.o.v. Thank you so much for reading!
"Oh yes! It's really rather nice and you get one per room and a sink each!" She said excitedly.
Supposedly, this timeline was a little different in my drafts and a lot more like the musicals timeline, but I had to change it so that the songs make sense in the sense in the fact that in the musical, Jace (Represented by Harry in the fic) is very fast to let Judith (Represented by Draco) into his house and let her explain herself. This way I thought it would better stretch out the story, and have more of Harry's personality coming through, because Harry is no where near as trusting as Jace, lol. (It's totally ok if you've never seen the musical and don't understand this, it will all be gone through in time.)
The door to the bathroom opened revealing one of Draco's favourite rooms. There was a large built in marble tub attached to the sides of the wall, the sides rather long so that one could sit on them, the back wall not a wall at all, rather it was panes of green enchanted glass so that you could not see in, but you could see out, and so that creatures roamed across them. It was the only room in the house that was not old fashioned, and it was the only room that did not mar his mind with memories that lurked in the shadows.
It was the twenty sixth of January when the crystal shattered. Everything had been perfect, or at least, it was if you blurred the edges. It was two am, and they were celebrating engagement. Of course, they had been told that they were rushing into it, to carry on dating and see where they ended up, but Harry had refused to listen, and at the time, he was exuberantly happy that he had. They were drinking champagne in their shared flat's kitchen, dancing around to whatever songs came across their old radio. It was crackly and old, but they both loved it, and Harry refused to throw it out, no matter what.
He was helping them out for the raid, so the least they could do was let him shower and change. He voiced his opinion to the auror, who agreed that he really should be allowed to, just not at the manor. There were only specific apparition points he was allowed to use, apparently.
didn't like him anymore? He didn't think he could deal with the fallout.
"Hold on, hold on." He drawled. "Are we going to skip past the me being gay thing? Is that not a big deal?" Narcissa looked whimsically disturbed, if it were at all possible. Draco laughed again. "What, did you think we were just sharing a flat as pals?"
He choked on a swallowed breath. How long had he been drowning? He wasn't sure. It couldn't have been too long because it felt like forever, and whenever that happened, he lost only a few minutes at the most, lifespan wasting away. His next inhale was steadier and easier, though he was aware had just stopped breathing for a moment. Apparently auto-pilot wasn't going to work whilst his body still thought it was dead. His head felt like it was still underwater, heavy and slow, and he couldn't see clearly. Someone was calling him, and he liked the voice. It sounded like rich velvet and brandy, and it was edged with love, but the right kind. The kind that didn't want back. Unrequited, he thought.
Throwing himself up, he let out a sigh. As a privilege, eighth years were allowed to wear whatever they want within certain guidelines (Draco was almost certain that these guidelines were enforced because of Pansy and Blaise, and he was also well aware that they would be the only two to defy them.) He had taken full advantage of this and was wearing his favourite trench coat, black shirt and trousers, a Slytherin tie loose around his neck. There were more than a few rings adorning his skeletal fingers, long necklaces around his neck, and many more piercings. (He had allowed Grey to figure it out, after all, he had a wand to fix any wrong punctures.)
"You little miracle worker. You know, it never ceases to amaze me when you show your talents." Blaise grinned, the sort of secret grin one would have once finding out gossip, a juicy secret. Pansy practically glowed at the praise. "I mean, who would have thought?"
"I really hope you understand the medical implications of that." Harry mutters and heads back to bed. Incredible. Ron to leaves without much of a fuss to his own bed, huffing something under his breath that may be some very creative insults. Draco's almost impressed. He doesn't particularly want to face Blaise right now, but then again, he doesn't really want to face anyone, so who is his inner subconscious to judge? All he knew was that tomorrow's session with Lupin was probably going to sting.
"Good to see your sense of humour hasn't changed at all." She said, almost whimsically, as if she thought it might've. Draco wasn't surprised. They likely had expected him to be acting a lot differently after a stay in Azkaban, and to be honest, he couldn't blame them at all. It was all his best acting to make the talk look effortless, but he really did feel drained. As if he would never be happy again, some voice told him in the back of his mind ironically, except it wasn't the immediate reaction to the dementors, it was just a reaction really to everyday life.
"Do you recon," Draco asked thoughtfully, most of his focus still retained by Pansy's hair "That we should move? I can hear them talking shit through the shelves." Blaise let his head com forward to rest on Draco's shoulder, lolling to the side slightly to lazily poke his nose at Draco's neck.
"Now what." Draco near jumped out of his skin at the voice. It was husky and low, but also hesitant. There was no longer a huge horse behind him, rather there was a teenage looking man with knotted grey hair down to his waist. Amber eyes watched him uneasily. He was also only wearing a what appeared to be a woven skirt made from Draco assumed to be seaweed.
There was a dementor out there, floating by the opening of the next cell along with the door flung open. The man was still screaming as he was dragged on his knees out of the open door by another two dementors who showed no sign of care. Draco blanched. It was Fenrir Greyback. He hadn't realised who had been next to him, but had no right to feel sorry for the man who had tortured him countless times. He felt a growl build up in the back of his throat, tongue touching on teeth that definitely weren't human. He supressed the feeling. Greyback screamed and begged, but the dementors didn't do anything other than continue their methodical path down the corridors.
"Well, there you are. Mother, I'm gay." She looked like she was trying to accept it, she really did, but she turned her head away.
Draco Malfoy was special. He was special in his blood, his lineage, his wealth and even his looks. He was someone no-one seemed to forget, no matter how hard they tried to. He was not someone Harry Potter could forget.
"Really professor? Your old drinks cabinet? A little unprofessional, if you ask me." Lupin, to his surprise, laughed.
"How are you feeling?" She asked, perfectly monotone. Civility, she said, is the key to success, but too much raw affection will be your downfall. She had wished more for a girl than a boy.
Lupin sighed, but it wasn't out of annoyance or disappointment, and it wasn't aimed at Draco, as far as he could tell. It was the kind of sigh one made when broaching a large topic that they really didn't ant to. He dropped his hand and folded his arm around his body, a shield protecting him from whatever invasive questions might come. He saw a perfect picture of them in his mind.
There was a small curse from behind the bathroom door, and when it opened, Grey emerged looking sincerely annoyed and with dripping wet hair.
"Narcissa?" Lupin asked, delicately avoiding the question of 'how much are you worth on the black market?'. Draco snorted.
"Kelpie." He said, gruffly. It wasn't the same discontent that the others seemed to have, but it was in no way as kind as Sam's. "Leave it in there. We'll have to come back and dispose of it later." The kelpie was, of course, watching with intelligence. They were beings, after all.
This had, naturally, changed when he had met Aidan on the fourteenth of July.
Draco did his best to gather his wits as well he could while lying in a bath after almost accidently drowning himself. He seemed to remember the sensation of lying on a bathroom floor and trying to gather himself. It felt the same. He blanked out Harry's screams.
And from that point, they had become practically inseparable. Their coffee date that they had planned had turned into a full on date, and in the darkness of Harry's London apartment at two in the morning, fuelled on bottles of wine, they had performed the thirty six questions.
"Oh you two are no fun. Being the only girl sort of sucks in this group." She thought for a moment. "Oh, on the topic of sucking-"
I've decided to continually do facts about random things in this fic, so here's the one for today's chapter: This dynamic was really hard for me to properly show off (I felt Blaise wasn't getting enough lines, so I had to re-write a lot of it), and I basically used the relationship I have with my brother to structure around, which is practically the relationship Pansy and Draco have (this is not exact, as you will see later in the fic), so it was definitely really funny writing these scenes!
"Fur?" Draco asked. The kelpie looked thoroughly pissed off for something that was soon to be executed for simply existing. They'd of course argue that kelpies were dangerous and a hazard, and that there was nothing that they could do for it, and they'd of course get away with it. It nuzzled the bars and almost everything before blinking at Draco, looking directly at his eyes. "Ah." Draco said. "Grey, then?" Grey, apparently, rolled its eyes and gave a small gesture that might have been a horse nodding. "Well Grey, I'm Draco, and I'd say we're in a similar situation." Grey cocked its head. "I'm a little fucked, too. Just got out of prison about two hours ago." Grey gave him a look that Draco really didn't want to interpret.
The cage on the end was large and appeared to be filled by a... Horse? A very angry horse, upon second consideration. It was huge, much taller than Draco, and had to be at least twice as big as a normal horse. It didn't have normal eyes either; they were amber and glowing, intelligent, and watching everything Draco did with a unwitting glare. It threw its head back and screamed, pawing at the floor. Another senior auror came up behind him.
"Draco?" How many times had grey said that? Draco couldn't tell, though he was sure he had heard it at least once.
"Why not?" It was the first time Grey had sounded careful and precise, the way Draco enunciated things when he wanted it to be known that there were consequences for not getting his way. Draco, however, really did not have a good answer to that question, so he stood and turned sharply.
He hummed gently a sort of sound that could have been many things, indifference, acceptance, annoyance, but Narcissa seemed to take it as intended. As a child, he often made sort of hums and small noises of undisclosed pain, and Narcissa had always seemed to interpret them correctly.
Grabbing Draco's shoulders, he shouted loudly for him to wake up, then shook his shoulders violently. No flicker of life. The muted pink that was more really of a grey had faded completely from Draco's cheeks, deathly pale and still shallow.
When Draco awoke the next morning, he was cold and everything hurt. He made a small moaning noise of discomfort and endeavoured to sit up and open his eyes. In doing so, it revealed that he had somehow slept in his bath despite the shallow puddles of water that covered the marble base. That explained the stiff feel of his limbs, but not the sharp pain in his left. In fairness, since living in Azkaban, it had always hurt.
"Love-" He said. Draco snapped his head to the side in a hard, angular movement, seething with unseelie rage, though it wasn't even aimed at Blaise, just at anything. You never let them see you upset, he thought to himself, so turn your sadness into anger and become an unstoppable foe. His body ached and his bones cracked as the resentment swarmed inside him in the shape of ugly vines, latching onto everything they could. His ribs broke and crumbled, his lungs constricted by a force that wasn't even there, rooting itself in the crevasse of his heart, though it had always been in there and he knew it, only now it hurt, it hurt like someone gripping him so tightly with a binding love that wasn't really love anymore, just suffocating agony that curled and creaked in his joints, whispering poison nothings into the blood that wasn't his blood, like hands on his neck, lips on his ear telling him he would fix everything, just not telling him how and dragging him down to the lake that was so familiar, like it was cold and calm, but it wasn't because the current tore him apart and leeched into him like fire, and it was so far away from his serenity that he didn't know which way was out, like he was drowning, but would be drowning forever without ever seeing the light at the top of the lake. Like he'd never see the moonlight again, never tilt his head back into the silence of the night and drink the sky, see his name etched in the stars. It was so dark now, and it felt crushing in the midst of the current, and he was willing for it to feel like the lake again, but it was hard when it felt like you were dying but would never cease to live. It wasn't as fast anymore, not now when the anger was fading, he'd already gotten here, but it still felt crushing and breathless, and the hands felt red hot on his skin. It was just stifling and empty. He floated.
"Yes, that's the one. They all ended up dead because they were very personal to my father. I showed up that trip, that's why had to die."
"Thanks." Grey said from his relaxed position on the foot stool. Draco was quite certain he had near fallen asleep.
That first week they had spent apart had looked very different for each of them.
"HE IS NOT MY SON!" Narcissa screamed, shrilly. She was halfway between crying and blowing someone up. "NOR WILL I EVER TREAT HIM LIKE ONE!" And it was at that point that Lucius snapped to. He slapped her so hard that she fell to the floor and clutched at her face. She panted and lifted her chin to look at him. Tears were running down her cheeks. Draco watched horrified from the corner he had curled up into with wide eyes. It didn't need words, and apology or an explanation. It wasn't even followed by Lucius screaming at her some more. He turned sharply on his heel and strode away purposefully. Narcissa let her head drop.
Closed the back door. Focused on the hallway in front of him.
"Let me ride you." Grey turned around remarkably quickly, red and somewhat flustered. Somehow, sex euphemisms were not lost on him, but the notion of washing was. Draco threw the sponge at him. "I'm not asking to fuck you, you absolute idiot, I'm asking to ride you as in horse riding!"
"Would you mind fetching me my wand? Only, I think I've broken my arm and I would really rather not have to deal with it in the muggle way." His speech patterns were long and drawling, as they had always been, and it reminded him painfully of Sunday mornings spent in the secret astronomy room tower with Harry, talking about both everything and nothing.
"What?" He asked. His eyes must have looked wild.
"I wish you were my mother." He said it with full conviction, and couldn't even bring himself to tell himself that it wasn't true. He really wished that she were.
"No, we aren't. Pansy doesn't have to know, it's just... Something that happens now. Let's not, ok?" Draco turned to Blaise at the end, all soft eyes and washed out features. Blaise didn't respond for a good minute, eyes sad and on the floor. He was moping, only slightly, but Draco let him. It would only take a moment for Blaise's eyes to find him again, only a few short seconds that held him prisoner to this stilted conversation.
"Bitch." He said, and swiped her ornate glass of wine, copying her actions. Blaise laughed across the table at both of them as they chugged the contents of the glasses with eye contact all the while. They all laughed a small while, the sound filling the air around them, unnerving those who sat too close, because, well, what could they be laughing about? They were Slytherins, after all. Draco felt a certain pair of eyes burning into the back of his head, and, not being one to resist temptation turned around with a smirk on his face, wine glass in hand. Harry Potter was staring at him from two tables away surrounded by other Gryffindor's who meant Draco less than well. "Would you like a picture Potter? You could add it to your stalking album." He called out across the sea of voices, many hostile. Pansy gave a small giggle beside him, more to encourage him than anything else, and Blaise was staring in a rather different way, more a glare than anything that did not match Draco's smirk.
"I think you've gotten better," She said, looking at him through the mirror that Draco recognised to be one of his own, something he had on his bedside table a few years back that had suddenly disappeared. She pretended not to notice his scathing glare.
"It doesn't matter too much, besides, mother is going to be back in a few days, and we can't do this when she's here." Draco's voice was also heavy from sleep, but in a way that was velvety and melodic, almost like his singing voice.
He wrestled his way out of Narcissa's arms, despite her noises of shock and disapproving melancholy. He stumbled to his feet, one arm wrapped around his middle and the other clutching at his collarbone and the base of his neck. He gasped and choked, but then he missed his footing and stumbled back so far that he slipped and fell backwards into the lake.
Pansy and Blaise were waiting for him at the end of the Slytherin table opposite each other, a seat waiting and open next to Pansy, inviting him in. He turned and glanced around the room once he reached it, smirk growing slightly wider as he noticed all eyes were still on him, as if people were afraid to take them away. Good. He made a small mock bow to his audience and seated himself gracefully, pouring himself a glass of whatever was in the ornate golden jug (he suspected it was red wine) and took a small sip.
(See the end of the chapter for
His father's buisness card.
"Whatever you need, Draco." Lupin said, doing exactly that, hands still braced in front of himself. It both annoyed and enthralled Draco that this was the reaction he might've provoked from Lupin. Once he felt the distance was great enough, that he was confident any blow or mis-intended for his health could be easily dodged, he let himself relax. Claws retracted, teeth became more human, great horns forgotten.
"Who are you?!" He yelled, and Aidan looked stricken, mouth parted slightly, and as close as Harry had ever seen him to tears. Harry had never seen Aidan cry. It was as unnerving as it was infuriating.
"It's Grey, and I ought not to do that if I were you." He said, eyeing Grey as if to say 'go for your life.'.
"Grey." he tried to sound curt and imperious, but instead he choked n the word and had to grab the side of the bath to support himself while he hacked. He wasn't even sure when he had sat up. A searing arm touched his shoulder, pulled him gently upright. Grey was studying him. It wasn't quite affection, Draco realised, but idealised longing. Kelpies were lone wolves, for wont of a better phrase, but some had just been alone for too long. Grey didn't want him to die not out of affection or a grip on censored morals, but because he could use Draco as a sort of support system, use him as a pack bond. Draco couldn't even find himself disliking the notion. He leant into the touch, bowing his head. Droplets landed thickly on the marble base.
Harry now found himself profusely wishing that Sirius had won and decided to own some breed of terrifying dog.
"Good morning, professor."  he responded glacially, not letting his eyes leave Lupin's. "Yes, this is a new cat." Because, really, he ought to respond. You ought to when posed with a harmless direct question. Lupin nodded, crouching down and sicking an arm out to Grey. Draco was bewildered.
They walked longer than seemingly neccessary, because Draco could feel the wards reluctance to let him go once they crossed the boundary, meaning it would be fine for Lupin to apparate them to wherever they were supposed to go. He turned, opening his mouth.
It wasn't deep near the banks and bore only gentle ripples when the wind died down, only came up to his knees when he was upstanding, and as he lay backwards on his elbows, the water barely reached high enough on his chest to be a worry. Narcissa ran over, almost refusing to run in after him, but gathered up the long skirt of her dress and ran in. She needn't have tried, because the cold water and the shock somehow seemed to align his mind and body. He could breath again.
Draco had spent the first week trying not to get sepsis. It really had been a bad fucking idea to walk across literal broken glass to get to Harry. A bit of an oversight, he told himself. He forgot to eat most of the time, and when he did, it was very little. Mostly, he just spent hours ghosting around the empty grounds of the small flat, which was, for the first time since they had purchased it, void of love. Harry had taken the bank details, he knew that because the safe was open. He had also read the note, opened the box, and once Draco had realised that, he'd left the house for the first time since Harry had left.
'No.' When he had begged his father to stop torturing him. It wasn't fun.
"What like it's hard? He was in there for, like, two minutes." The other voice argued. Ah, that's who he was. The hands seemed to reach into his mind, to pull him into the present, pull him away from the void of ocean that swamped his thoughts. Draco Malfoy, that's who
"I've already told you, this stays between us."
"Don't you have things to be doing?" Grey asked him, voice husky from sleep as Draco angled himself across the warm expanse of skin that was Grey's chest. He recieved no answer to his question, only a cat like glare and arms wrapping themselves around his body.
"I'm Aidan, darling! I'm-I'm you fiancé! Who else would I be?" The ghost of a faked smile kept flitting across his face, but he couldn't seem to kept it there, it kept falling off as though it were the wrong size, on the wrong person. Harry saw red. Aidan tried to walked toward him, but Harry back-peddled, which only seemed to upset him more, his breath coming out in heaving pants, the same one would do on the verge of tears. Something crunched.
"Aidan."
"Granger told you? What does she know?" He asked, careful not to sound to forceful or desperate. He sounded even and controlled, a win.
There were more people screaming now. They were screaming because they were being tortured, and he was doing nothing about it. They were dying, and he allowed it. They even died at his own hands, knives through their throats, untraceable. Untraceable because it stained him.
"Mm, you always did know how to send them running." Draco mused, watching the girl hurry away, still stroking Blaise's back delicately. "We're not stopping you from sleeping with us Pans, you just aren't into dick and there's nothing wrong with that." He gave her an almost patronisingly pitying look. Blaise laughed, loud and rich, much like his personality. Pansy glared at Draco and hit him lightly, sticking her nose in the air.
I know this was also meant to be out yesterday and there was supposed to be a longer chapter today, but my brother had an episode, so I wasn't able to get much writing done, and so this chapter is criminally short as well, I do apologise, but there will be longer ones soon! The end also may be a little rushed because I really needed to get this out, sorry
"Couldn't say. Civility is, after all, a foreign word to both Potter and Weasley. I assure you though darling, we'll be just fine." Draco drawled, blinkingly lazily as he examined the artwork on the walls.
"Alcohol." Blaise said simply and loudly, a wide stupid grin on his face which vanished quickly when a Hufflepuff fifth year walked past them, tripping on her long robes as Pansy glared at her with cat eyes.
"Ready when you are." Sam said from behind Draco. It appeared to him that Sam might be quite important. Good. All the aurors turned to look at Draco who glanced back at them all with an even gaze. A quick turnaround. 'Presentation is the key to success.' His father had once said, slapping Draco after he had fallen to the floor in pain. He bit through the pain now.
'She'll get over us being late' Draco replied by shrugging and rolling his eyes.
"Get away from me!" Draco hissed, flailing back and tripping on the chair. Grey, whose presence he had forgotten, made at Lupin, snarling and hissing, batting at his face. "Stay back!" Lupin's eyes were wide, but to his credit, he seemed to get a hold of himself rather quickly, holding his hands up in surrender.
"What did he say in the letter?" Her shoulders drooped, eyes downcast.
"The portkey isn't far from here." Lupin said, as though reading his thoughts, not turning to Draco nor slowing his gait down. Draco narrowed his eyes and walked on, through the hazy trees and damp green. Something hissed, and Lupin stopped. Grey had pressed himself against Draco's legs and was hissing at something unseen between the trees. Draco took a hard look at the trees, using his veela eyes to reveal the secrets of the dark beyond. A hulking figure. He instinctively pressed himself closer to the floor, grabbing his wand and pointing it at the figure. "Draco?" Lupin asked, also drawing his wand. "What is it?"
"What's this now?" He asked predatorially, holding the picture at such an angle that Draco and Narcissa might too be able to see it. It was Draco's elected favourite picture of him and Harry, again, taken by Lily. They were standing on an icing rink in Somerset, faces so close that a hair of movement might've made them kissing, gazing into one an others eyes and smiling. Lucius saw the small frown that creased Draco's brow. He dropped the picture, shattering it. "I was told that this flat was owned by a Mr. Harry Potter, but, of course, that's not you, is it? It's the boy in the picture, or so I would hazard a guess."
Thanks again for reading! Again please do leave a comment, they mean a lot to me! (my friend's support only gets me so far, lmao)
"Come now darling, I was busy." He drawls at her, examining the food. "Don't be too put out." Blaise choked on a laugh. Pansy glared at the pair of them.
"Draco!" Pansy said loudly. "He's been rude to me, and now you're inviting him out to get plastered with us? The travesty. The betrayal." She moaned, slumping against him, back of her hand against her forehead in a sort of swoon.
Steps echoed around him, couples, singles, runners, families. It was all so loud. He pushed the panic to the back of his mind and steeled himself against emotions he had convinced himself that he simply didn't have the capacity to feel.
"He- he was lying," He sobbed, voice breaking helplessly as he did so.
"Do you not like me?" And then he did turn to her, his mother, the one who had kept him alive. She looked so sad, so miserably like Draco had remembered his own reflection looking like at the age of five when his father had first hit him. The bruises ached, and he suddenly thought about whether or not he did like Narcissa.
'To stubborn to worm it out': a tight lipped head shake. 'what do we do?': hands raised and then dropped, and a cocked head.
"Oh, come on Pans. It's Saturday. Are you going to force us out of bed on a Saturday?" Draco said, strolling over to her and slinging an arm across her shoulders. "We're ready now, and that's all that matters, isn't it?" Her glare could have frozen the equator, but she didn't make a move to shove Draco off, just folded her arms and glared at her next target: Hermione Granger who unfortunately happened to be heading out of her room and down to breakfast at the same time. She froze upon seeing them, and then continued on.
"Why?" She asked, and suddenly he had her hand on his shoulder, the other on his cheek. He thought of Narcissa, thought of the way she only showed affection that he craved when Draco talked about killing himself, which is somehow how the following sentence fell out of his mouth.
Aidan woke to the smell of after dawn, the sight of weak January sun streaming through patched curtains. His feet ached as he pressed down on them, but he had wrapped them well enough that none of the blood leaked out. He checked the old clock mounted on the wall. Ten thirty, it read. He padded softly through to the living room, and a manic fear gripped his chest, knocking the wind out of him.
"I'm quite alright, thank you." Grey looked expectantly up at him. Draco sneered back. "It's chocolate, you wouldn't like it." He did his best to roll his eyes in the body of a cat. Lupin snorted and Draco pretended not to have heard it for the sake of Lupin's life.
"I'll be quite fine, Draco. Having you here was company enough, and of course you'll be home for the Christmas holidays." She said, smoothing his hair down. He wasn't wearing general wizarding clothing, rather he was wearing a long overcoat, a shirt that had a few too many buttons undone and dark trousers. A Slytherin scarf hung heavy around his neck, and the weight of many snake insignia rings adorned his fingers. An unseen bandage covered the entirety of his left forearm. "You look beautiful, as always." She always used rather more feminine compliments, which Draco supposed was a mix of her desire for him to have been a girl, and the, well, beauty of his veela features.
Draco found it easy to fall into a routine with Narcissa, as he always had, becuase she was steady and forthcoming, and he was always searching for stability in any areas that he could. It was safe and comfortable, and it made him focus on things other than how nice it would be to end his life.
Draco floated in the lake for a while, a formless shadow amidst the ripples of the tide. His eyes were open but glassy and unseeing, and rain continued to soak his attire and skin. That was how Grey found him, floating and cold, bleeding and broken.
It was always so far when he reached for it, but right there when he was... elsewhere. It felt like serenity here, in his cell. The cold, numbness of it all. Draco wanted to sink into it, to let it rescue him from the mar of scratches across his arms, to let it save him from everyone. In this cell, it felt like dying and Draco was perfectly aware that that was why they had put him in it. They wanted to starve him of everything, break him down till he was nothing but a shell. Something shifted inside of him, moaning in supressed pain. Draco blinked blearily at the wall.
Next time we will start on the first song of the musical: 'Hear Me Out.'
"If you're all quite done staring, it's lunch and your food is bound to be getting cold." She shouted at them, voice high and posh. It took a moment for all of the students to turn around and begin muttering amongst themselves, but Draco could still feel half the hall's eyes on his back. He sipped his wine again laconically, smiling in a similar fashion at Blaise who seemed to take it as a joke and smirked back.
"Only if you don't say something stupid." Draco said, and Harry leaned in putting his rough hands on Draco's sharp jawline, his lips on Draco's lips. It was nice like that, comfortable, familiar for both of them like it were a muscle memory, like riding a bike. They both smiled into the kiss, like friends.
"Could you
"Goodness Draco, think of the rumours." Blaise murmured from underneath the sheets, drawing them steadily over his head.
"Aid- Draco?" A voice from behind him asked. It sounded a weird mix of pleasantly surprised, confused and mildly disappointed. Lily. He spun around, clutching at the fence and pressing himself against it. "What are you doing here?" Fight or flight responses normally kicked in around this point, and for Draco it was usually fight. He bit the down the urge to tell her that he was allowed to go wherever he pleased.
"A new mother?" He asked. Lucius came to a stop an knelt before Nikolai so that they were almost at eye level.
The stack of expensive French wine bottles grew and grew, and by the dying embers of the parlour fire, they slept together in a twisted way that one only achieves from going past a certain level of drink and self hatred. It was not hateful nor passionate, simply because each of them were there with no other way to show exuberant joy for absolutely nothing.
"I don't know darling, you were the one talking to them." His speech was even more rushed now, and it was clear he was panicked. He appeared to be desperately trying to clean up the champagne, averting any eyes away from his face so that they might watch his hands instead. Harry was fuming.
"Everything you say in here is confidential, Draco, I'm not going to tell anyone. All I need is for you to tell me what happened, and that's it. No one will know, but it'll make you feel better, I promise." His words were soothing, and Draco took his eyes off him for a moment, before realising that his actions were not. Lupin pushed up the right sleeve of his shirt, exposing a pale expanse of skin, unmarked and beautiful. He dared not yank his arm away, but his resolve quickly fell when Lupin reached for his wand. Draco's eyes went wide, and he scrambled to try and put as much distance between the pair of them, but Lupin's grip held tight. Perks of being a werewolf, he supposed. He heard Lupin mutter a glamour dropping spell under his breath.
He stooped down and gathered Draco in his arms, carrying him bridal style, breaking into a run towards the house, constantly glancing down to check if his expression had changed from mystically vacant to anything that would reveal he was alive. His chest wasn't moving.
Welcome back! I'm sorry about the general disorganisation of this (and the brief neglect), it hurts me to, you know. (As my friend has said and been immortalised on my quote wall, 'I live under a blanket of obliviousness.'), but I'm choosing to blame my brother for this.
Lost in thought, he had barely heard someone distant sounding asking to pet his dog. He of course said yes, because, well, what else did you say when someone asked that? He had then decided it would probably be rude if he carried on ignoring whoever this stranger was, and so chanced a glance down at the man who had spoken.
"Had about a month to perfect it. Not much else to do in Azkaban." He felt Blaise stiffen beneath him as he mentioned it, but he did not pen his mouth against Draco, just tightened his arms gently again and squeezed, pressing a small kiss to Draco's neck.
The only personal touches that he did in fact leave behind were the pictures of him and Draco, even the ones he treasured. The glass holding one of the picture in felt cool beneath his fingers, a familiar sensation. It was a relatively new one, a picture of the pair of them at Christmas taken by Remus. Harry was laughing and fiddling with the strap of a bracelet he had gotten for Draco, who was looking at Harry in the photo like he was his world. A couple stray tears escaped and ran wetly down his cheeks which he hastened to wipe away.
"Of course I do." His voice was proud and unforgiving.
Thanks for reading, hope that if you're going back to school or are already back it's not going too bad! I start on Friday and I've already recieved assignments, dear God.
"Well I suppose Mr. Potter doesn't give me a hard time, I mean, I would even go out on a limb and say he was even trying to be nice to me. Weasley's another fucking matter, and I want to punch him."
"Quite enjoyable. I really admire it, it's very pretty." He said after a moment of consideration. "The plants really do add atmosphere, and they work well with the high ceilings and the windows." Pansy nodded, murmuring quietly.
Harry drove to his parent's house, because, well, where else was there to go? He pulled up outside there door, and for a while, he just sat there in his car and cried some more in the vain hope of trying to get himself together. He hugged the steering wheel and sobbed.
"Mm, no. I was just teasing. You shall live out your days as my faithful house cat." He muttered. "Let me go, I need to move this stuff up this staircase." Grey dutifully un wound his arms from Draco, and picked up the bags and headed up the stairs first. "Ah, such a good kelpie." He mused, following.
He lay there for a few moments, breathing heavily. The sound stopped, but now he was astutely aware of a stabbing pain in this arm and head, the bruised feeling of his body. Bringing his arm up to his face revealed just red, warm and metallic dripping off his fingers.
"Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't aware you wanted to die. I don't have to put this on you; in fact, I'm not obliged to help you at all, I'm doing this all from the goodness in my heart." If Grey could roll its eyes, Draco was sure it would. "Yes, well I'm sure you'd feel like that." He imagined Blaise and Pansy watching him talk to a kelpie. He shoved away their laughter. Actually, he thought, they'd probably just be dull about it. It wasn't as if it were a normal horse that couldn't understand him; Grey understood him perfectly.
"You have beautiful eyes" He remembered Harry telling him, so many times, over and over, but this time they were lying on the floor amongst wine bottles and glasses. His pupils were so dilated now that he could barely see the colour, just a ring of grey against a sea of black.
Draco used more potions to get the grime out of the long knotted hair, often alternating between an ivory comb and French products. By the end, his hair was clean and no longer matted, but his body (the parts that weren't submerged, at least) was still a filthy mess. Draco sighed and glanced at his soaking fore arms and the many products he was using and decided he really did not have the patience to wash the rest of Grey's body.
He didn't ask to sleep in the lake again.
"Why did you run away?" She asked. It was the third time she had asked the question. Not since he arrived back at the manor, but for the third time in his life. Once when he was ten, anther when he was fifteen and now again and he was twenty two. He was pathetic. But, he was older now and his mother knew him more. The cold of the air and the biting of the frost gave him numbness, subdued his emotions.
"Of course, then I'm sure we shall see you at a later date." She said evenly, inclining her head slightly out of polite regard. The aurors did the same, and then turned to leave, but of course apparated before going to far. Draco shut the door, pressing it hard with his hand. Narcissa reached out and took it whilst it was still outstretched. "So thin." She murmured quietly, running her thumb over it. Looking at his hands, they were very thin, white skin stretched taut over the bones to give an almost skeletal effect, though he supposed he hadn't really noticed this earlier because his hands were always quite skinny.
Credits to my brother who is my inspiration for this scene with Lupin lmao, he just fit so well that I couldn't help writing Draco after him
"Oh, fuck off Blaise I'm going to have to re-organise myself now." Pansy snapped, pulling herself forward before pushing herself back between Draco's legs so that he might continue with his hair. Draco didn't say anything, didn't laugh, just carried on as normal, because this was his friend group and he was finally comfortable mentally in between the people he loved and who loved him back without front or ulterior motive.
Thank you so much for reading, please do leave a comment about anything, I love reading them!
? I've never really seen a kelpie work like that before." Grey didn't so much answer as turn into a large grey timber wolf and wander out of the bathroom. Draco let his head rest on the perch of the tiled sides, let his eyes fall shut again to ease the pain that enveloped him. And for a brief period, it did, and the pain slowly ebbed away. It was still raining outside.
They sat on picnic rugs strewn across the grass, lying haphazardly across each other as they passed around the bottles, talking about everything and nothing, about all the things they couldn't talk about under the blanket of sobriety.
They were six simple steps, and yet he couldn't seem to get past the first one, because when he opened the safe that neither of them ever used, save for storing bank details and passports, he found a note and a jewellery box. Harry's breath caught in his throat as he carefully unwrapped the note.
"That tree there. That's how you'll get in." It was a large oak tree with knotted roots tumbling over one an another, and if you tapped it in the right places with your wand, it open up and let you into the market. Sam still did not ask how he knew where it was, only nodded and called the others over to where they stood.
He was never dry. Just wet and cold and miserable. He didn’t want to go home; he didn’t really have one anymore. What he had was the shell of his childhood, cracked in too many places for the hope of fixing it, and now it sat like a heavy, broken ornament. Like something on display only for the reason of showing what would happen if you weren’t careful. He hugged his knees tighter, wishing that the breaking of the waves would cease so he could finally have his serenity.
And the last one, which wasn't even a direct 'no'.
"Of course," Draco said, grinning, slinking an arm around Blaise's waist, leaning into his scent. "Can I guess?"
Nikolai's mother, his real mother, had unfortunately passed away during childbirth, essentially orphaning and his half brother, Damien. For six years he had prospered in Russia, living with those other souls in the brothel.
"The tower above the Gryffindor common room. Can you find it ok?" He asked, hastening to walk around the desk to stand next to Draco who was picking up his bags from the floor. Grey looked more than a little annoyed at being left out, but Draco did not bother to consider it.
"Draco, thank you," She replied, holding him perhaps a little tighter and a little longer than was necessary for impressions. She looked to Draco no worse for wear than before the war, but she never was one to show things. His mother was incredibly good at powering through things without letting seemingly anything change her mood or graces, a trait that he wished she really didn't have. "I trust you have been keeping well?"
She escorted him back to the house where they were promptly fussed over by the servants and slighted by Lucius who thought it was rather undignified to come back in such states. Draco lay on the bed, head lolling dangerously close to sleep. A knock on his parlour door stirred him from his not quite slumber.
"I love you, mother." He said. But you did not have to like someone to love them. Her frown deepened, and she looked maddeningly close to tears. "I like you, as well, of course. I just- I'm tired." She gazed at him sorrowfully. "I'm tired of the pain, mother. I'm tired of acting like the perfect fucking child all the time, because that's what father wants, I'm tired of being hit, of being tortured, of being told that the only reason I'll ever amount to something is because I'm being trained to be a fucking Malfoy, I'm tired of trying to fucking kill myself in the hopes that maybe,
All Draco could see was the icy black of the water, the push and pull of the waves as he disappeared more and more to the tides tyranny. Then there was the surface. It was so cold, but in a nice way. He wasn't even shivering, and he couldn't feel either of his arms, couldn't feel the red hot pain of the dark mark's brutal infection, the aching bruise of a new broken limb.
It ought to have been a Saturday, Draco thought to himself whilst gathering his limbs into a solid ball on the bed. His book wasn't in there with him, and so he searched his bedside table, pulling the silk gently back to reveal slithers of the room, bathed in the weak soft light of the early morning. It was a pretty room, especially so in the morning light that dappled it ever so, like a clearing in the wood with weeping trees that obscured the sun's gaze.
He then sent it off attached to the old family owl that had always stayed native to the Malfoy grounds; a great big European eagle owl that had once been named Perseus, after the constellation. He realised that the family did seem to have a lack of originality, but he liked the names, the same as he liked his. He had somewhat fond memories of watching the stars on summer nights with Narcissa, who had taught him to value the sky, and to know it like the back of his hand.
They had joked many times since the engagement on details, all of which had sounded like meaningless apparitions in the air of love, but here they all were, carefully written down in what Harry was sure to be Draco's finest calligraphy. He put the box and note away, still weeping softly, and opened the bedroom door.
It gave him a searching look. Draco put up one of his hands from where it was crossed and raised an eyebrow. The kelpie gave an annoyed snort and nuzzled its coat.
Harry had been out walking Padfoot around St. James' park, because his Godfathers were staying over for a few weeks and had decided to bring their dog along. Padfoot was a huge black retriever, much to his Godfather Sirius' disappointment, for he had wanted some huge shaggy dog to, and he quotes, 'fetch him the souls of the damned.'. His husband Remus had fortunately intervened and threatened divorce if Sirius did get a dog like that and teach it to attack people.
Draco, as it had been decided, had two weeks of house arrest before he returned to Hogwarts on the first of October. He felt optimistic about the first week, but his mother would be back for the second week, and he had yet to have an idea on how to entertain her. He hoped she would stay in her room as she always seemed to do during the war, simply milling around the same parlour over an over.
Draco found that his eyes were harder to wrench open than he had thought they would be, harder to uncover what lay before them. His head hurt and his body was stiff. (Dissociation, as the healers would later call it. Complete loss of the conscious for granted periods of the time, during which he was still aware of memories and ideas.) The glamour had held, though, he thought whilst glancing down at his hands, forcing them up to the tips of his ears.
"You get to keep him." Sam said, patting Draco's shoulder. Grey looked like he wanted to kill Sam, to create and uprising, but he stayed perfectly tense and rigid.
"Where is it?" Grey's speech patterns were a lot blunter than Draco's, but matched the hardness that paired itself with the hidden jovialness of the general words. Where was it? It was a simple question, and yet Draco couldn't think to where it might be. Had he gotten it out last night? He wasn't sure. Grey seemed to sense his unease toward the general idea of the question. "I can track it down."
Then he had an idea. He let get of Grey's head and ran to the awkwardly set up stall behind it, leaning over to grab something that really ought to be there. His hands found the fabric, and he grasped it, bringing it up to where he could see it. A bridle. A magically altered bridle. Grey sneered at it as well as it could whilst being a horse.
"We're?" Draco whispered, deadly silent and poised.
"You'll find him here." She said, handing the note to him. Draco tried to regard it with as little interest as possible, but he only achieved looking at with the longing of all the Kings of Greece looked at Helen.
"It's a kelpie." He replied, as if that was enough explanation. The kelpie looked cautiously, no longer rearing, but pressing itself against the back of the cage. Draco made a noncommittal sound and the man nodded, turning away.
As always, thank you so much for reading, and please do leave a comment about what you liked/disliked or what you want to see more of in this fic, and I'll do my best to include it!
"Uh-" He started, but was cut off by the taller man.
"About your personal life, Draco. I'm a bit worried about you." Draco finally turned to glare at Lupin unhappily. "We could use a pensive, if it's easier that way." It sounded as though it was supposed to be reassuring, but it did anything but to Draco. Lupin clearly saw his mistake and hastened to correct himself. "Of course we won't use one, that's only if you really wanted too!" He said, reaching across the table to take one of Draco's skeletal hands in his own. "We can go at whatever pace you feel is right, we'll be doing this for a while, after all." Draco didn't like that wording.
"Don't." Draco said. "Sit there." Grey obeyed. He summoned a towel and sat in the chair behind where Grey was seated on the foot rest and got to work, alternating again between the towel and the comb until the hair was satisfactorily dry. (he had done this a lot for Pansy in school, so he was used to it, though Pansy didn't have nearly as much hair as Grey did.)
"This?" The man from earlier said. Draco could tell he would take any opportunity to slam his head in. Draco disliked the man immensely.
"I'm quite fine, mother. I was just marvelling at the lake. It's quite pretty in the mornings, isn't it?" His mother's frown was so deep and sorrowful that he had to look away.
"What did you want?" It wasn't quite freely offering in its tone, but it wasn't closed off.
"Listen, we can forget this ever happened, and I'll never bother you again." And this he said with the air of finality he was grasping for. Weasley gaped, Harry stuttered, and he had no clue what Blasie was doing (he hoped it was getting whiskey, but alas, things never really do pan out the way you hope for them to do, you know?)
"But, Draco-"
"Mm, very nice. I loved the ring, and I'm sure we'll all have a good time getting wasted by the lake." He said. "Oh, this is nice. I have to tell you, this is much better than the food at home."
"Mm, have you seen the bathroom we have?" Blasie asked, clearly wanting to move on. Pansy flipped herself round again at the mention of it, grinning.
"You have to have an auror down once a week for your house arrest, so be sure to ask for a man named Sam." He advised, stepping out the door. A peacock screamed in the distance. Narcissa smiled at him, and waved elegantly, as though it were a high class gesture. "Goodbye mother. I love you." He smiled back ruefully, shouldering his bags and turned his back on the house.
"Hardly. I've been waiting for fifteen minutes for these two." She said, and stalked out, Blaise and Draco following closely behind. Draco turned to look at what Granger was doing, but instead met her eyes. They looked at each other for a few seconds before Draco turned and continued walking.
"Hey Pansy." She said, an awkward nod at her. She'd clearly been awake when Pansy was getting ready. Draco almost pitied her.
It was Grey, after some profound moment of insanity, he discerned. His throat and lungs burnt, but he was at no danger of dying anymore (at least from drowning, he bitterly thought)
"Crime and punishment." They gazed at each other for a long while, studying the other's face. Harry looked at him with such longing and gentle passion that Draco wanted to run the other way.
"Right, I'll let you get on with the rest then." He shook out his arms over the bath, though a lot of the droplets flicked randomly around the room. Grey turned around to look at him with round eyes.
When they arrived at the apparition point, they landed in a field. Draco remembered this field. His blood almost ran cold, but it needn't have because of course, he was here to break the place apart. He didn't even need to get involved, apparently, just point the aurors to where they might find the entrance. He curse his mother who had decided to volunteer him, though he knew it was done to try and boost his status.
"Want an explanation or a time period?"
He let himself sink into the serenity of it all. Let the white consume him as it had done before. Peace. Calm. He sighed gently against them and didn’t even feel the crack in his head as he fell to the floor.
The grip around his ribs grew tighter, harder to breathe in, but as the memory faded more so and he was left with the present, he realised it was less because of the tight hold on him, and more to the fact he was about halfway between crying and panicking, but either way, he just couldn't breathe.
"I'm here for Calina Lebedev." He had said, smiling at the girl who sat opposite him on a worn sofa. The girls eyes had gone soft.
It was getting darker, though, Draco was quite sure, it had started off very dark. His consciousness grew more and more vacant of coherent thoughts, mind replaced simply by one word: cold. Was he still alive? He couldn't tell.
"If you think I'm going to find solace in that, you're sorely mistaken." Draco spat. "I have never been once been hit nor slighted by my father, and the fact you would think so shows your clear lacking as a teacher. I have never wanted in my life, and -" Lupin cut him off, taking both of his hands again, clasping them in between his own. Draco panted slightly, chest heaving and still glaring at Lupin who looked at him meaningfully.
"Those people beg to fucking differ!" He screamed, and now he didn't even care if others could hear them.
Random fact about this chapter: I did mention about basing the Slytherin's relationship on the relationship I have with my brother, so I really hope you can see here in what parts this is not true. I actually drew out a room plan for the common room so that I could actually write consistently, and now my search history is absolutely convinced I am rich because all I have been looking up is effectively 'expensive furniture', 'expensive clothing brands' etc, (had to do this for Draco's gifts last chapter) so if I'm being traced, they will be coming for my bank account. Oops.
He hadn't been dragged kicking and screaming to the manor, but he certainly wasn't here on intended buisness. Draco treated it in his own mind like his own kidnapping. He had been kidnapped, once or twice, roughed up little and ransomed back to his parents. They never paid the money because, of course, they had raised Draco to be a fighter, to be a winner, and if he couldn't even get himself out of a small kidnapping situation, what kind of person would he even grow up to be?
Draco was a man who, more often than not, got what he wanted. It was in his personality, in his blood, for he had been bred in a  certain way that let his capabilities fall outside of taking no for an answer. Still, throughout his still somewhat short life, he had been told 'no' numerous times, too many to count, but the more significant ones were easy to recall in plain sight.
He spent the rest of his precious hour unpacking, placing personal effects on the carved walnut surfaces, surprised to find that some items already littered it, items wrapped in silver tissue paper. Draco smirked to himself, gathering the five items and seating himself on his new bed. There was a note attached, beneath the items which he unwrapped with practiced eagerness.
Lucius, using a translation charm, had described in detail of the wonder of what he would give Nikolai back in England, the wonder of the manor and his riches. Nikolai had listened, shiny eyed and quiet, because he had been taught that it was wrong to speak over men, and that it was even worse to speak over rich ones. He listened to the description of his room, large and so far unadorned, lying in wait for him. Nikolai marvelled all of it, the riches that he could have possession of. They didn't even need to do a test between them, because it was so painstakingly obvious that Lucius was his father in all of his features.
Leaving the institute of Azkaban was both like a breath of fresh air, and like being crippled. His eyes tried to adjust to the light too quickly, and he squinted in the midday September sun. It was warmer out here, but he was still wet. Damp and miserable.
Neither of them slept well that night.
Left a note for Draco alongside his ring. It wasn't a long.
"Just fine, thanks. Are you ready to head down to breakfast or are we going to be subjected to a long talk about the importance of nail products in school?" Blaise called back, an eyebrow raised. Draco had to supress the need to laugh.
Imagine, he had thought to himself, imagine being Lucius Malfoy and going to such lengths to secure an heir, and instead, you get a half breed Russian who ended up accidently drowning himself at the age of sixteen. It was ironic, he had thought.
"Let it go." He hissed at Blaise. His shoulders sagged sadly, and he gazed at Draco with sorrowful eyes, as if he were the one confessing his sadness.
Draco gasped through the noise, and his back was against the cold wooden doors, and they were being wrenched open because his hands were on the handles. He let out a strangled scream as he did so, blood continuing to pour don. He wanted to feel light headed, to pass out, but the pain weighed him down, tethered him to consciousness.
When Lucius had left, he had pondered the idea of Nikolai's heritage. Of course, he was Calina's son, and so there was no question about the fact he was a half-breed. This did displease Lucius, but it also did have its own advantages. In his childish features, it was already clear that he was not, in fact, a normal wizard. His skin was as pale as Lucius', even paler perhaps, and seemed to possess the glow of the moon. His hair was blond, unnaturally silky and also seemed to glow lightly, even in the dim of the room and just through the edges of it, the glimpse of ears that were longer and more pointed than any humans should have been. Lucius had grey eyes, and so did Nikolai, though they looked more to him like the iridescent of perhaps an opal stone.
"There. Not a half bad job. I'm used to it- I used to ride, did you know that?" He found himself saying, gushing rather quickly despite the fact that this was a kelpie, and he was a perfectly sane human being. Well, perhaps not human. Not entirely. Draco glanced around, trying not to catch the eye of any auror who was currently leaving him alone. "Well, that's us. If you run off, we're both dead." Again, both of them understood that that was true. They did not acknowledge the fact. He grabbed the lock on the door, but it was a lot stronger than the one that had been on the boy's cage. Draco cursed and rubbed his hand. It smelt like metal.
I have, after much deliberation, decided that this will not switch P.O.V's, which is really a shame because I do have a lot of Harry P.O.V stuff in my drafts, so I might just release a lot of that on a separate work for one-shots.
Thank you again for reading, and please do leave a comment if there's anything you particularly liked/disliked, or if you just want to say hi, they really mean so much to me!
"Well Draco, lunch is almost over, I have free periods all day and a bottle of expensive French whiskey, do you have any idea where I'm going with this?" She asked, flicking her hair in Blaise's direction just as he opened his mouth to speak.
(See the end of the chapter for
Grey, he discovered, was also in the bathroom with him. He, however, was draped somewhat across the edge of the bath, having most of his body situated outside of it and on the tiled floor instead of inside with Draco.
"Hello, Draco." Harry Potter said. Draco looked at the window and smiled, small and sad. The door shut and footsteps approached, full of longing and desperation, taken with hesitant joy. He was trying to gauge Draco's reaction, to see who he had become, to see if had even changed.
Could it be? But it is! My complete ignorance towards the Slytherins, despite the fact that they're basically Draco's backbone in this fic!
"Why, if you wanted to negotiate the terms, I would be quite happy to agree to certain conditions." Grey snorted. The kelpie was fucking laughing at him. Sam appeared to be thinking for a moment, before coming to a conclusion.
He turned around a few times to scan the market. There were a lot of eyes on him, and half were fearful. The cages were, unhelpfully, not labelled, and so he tried to make an educated guess as to who was what. He gave up eventually and just headed to end of the row. There was an assembled apparition point for the aurors to take the 'merchandise' starting already, the boy from before leaving Draco's side and running to the first auror waiting. They disappeared within seconds.
"Very, thank you, Yourself?"
The portkey was an old bottle of dry gin that had long since been drank. Draco eyed it with suspicion.
"I hope you realise these are my favourite French products." Draco said whilst moving onto his face. Grey made a non-committal sound of gentle pleasure and enjoyment as the grime was removed by warm water and soft hands that feathered over his face.
"I don't know." He said, deadly quiet and still.
On the other hand, I have worked out exactly where I want this story to go, so it will have a more concrete plot now.
"This is the entrance to the common room, and you should be able to find the dorms from here. No-one else should be in there, classes are running." And with that, he turned around and all but fled. Draco almost laughed.
Draco wasn't sure at what point he got up and left, but he must've, because the next time he came too, he was standing in front of the lake. It was freezing as he walked into it, and he didn't even know why he was doing it. Part of him wanted to run away to his mother's warm embrace in her parlour where the fire was always warm, and the other part wanted to sink to the bottom of the lake where he wouldn't have to feel anything any more.
"What do you think of this length?" Pansy asked as Draco's hands worked through her hair. "I was thinking of taking it longer, but I wasn't sure."
Not worthy of either of his names.
He didn't faint. He didn't black out. He just- stopped. He stood there, blank behind the eyes and watched everything unfurl around him with no reaction.
Welcome back! I shall be a lot less busy now, so my time for writing shall definitely increase, and I'll be able to get a lot more of this out to you before my school starts again next week. Online learning, here I come. (I hate my life)
"Draco, darling!" Narcissa cried desperately. "Are you alright?!" He looked up at her with wonderous grey eyes, sharp and narrow. Then he laughed. He couldn't help it, it was just so bizarre. His mother was kneeling in a freezing lake he had just fallen into by means of his own stupidity, and she had the gall to be worried about him. He laughed harder and harder, but no shortness of breath stopped him. Narcissa looked wonderfully concerned.
"Well, what do you want to know? I'll answer selectively to direct questions, hopefully aimed at how good I look dressed like this." Lupin looked like he was trying really hard not to sigh.
He hit the bed with a small thud, sighing into the open air around him, long exhales that still could not convey the proper affections for the pair of them. Draco wanted to lay there, forever possibly, but he had wasted enough time as was of his precious hour alone, and it was time to leave the safety of his bed and venture into civilisation. But alas, that just was not the way that his ego rolled. If he left now and walked in an amble, he'd be fashionably late, show up in style. The way he always did.
An empty flat.
As always, thank you so much for reading, and please do leave a comment if there is anything you particularly liked/disliked, or just because, because I absolutely love reading comments and tbh I need a little love right now lmao!
"It's almost like I didn't need that muffliato." Draco snarked. Blaise's foot hit his thigh from beneath the sheets, and the lump that was Blaise turned over. It suddenly hit Draco. "Oh, hangover then?" In fairness, Blaise had drank almost an entire bottle of whiskey last night. "What ever will your homework look like?" Hangover potions were banned in school on the principal that alcohol was also banned. Blaise let out a groan.
A slam echoed in the next cell along. Draco bolted up, on his feet before his mind could even react to the sudden change in atmosphere. He could feel the dementors outside, feel their draining black holes of depression. Then someone was screaming. He blinked. Ran to the cell door where he had a gap marred by bars. His hands grasped the steel as he pressed his head as close as he dared to the openings.
"None of you were being so kind as to help him." The drawling accent was back, and it sounded fine. No tremor, no giveaway. Sam just smiled.
"Want some?" Lupin asked, offering rather a large bar of chocolate to him. Draco blinked in surprise.
"Just walking." He said, marvelling at the way his voice didn't shake or quiver. He looked as haughty as he could, but it was hard when the person he was giving it too looked so pitying and had only ever given him kind memories and gentle thoughts.
"Draco. Draco!" The voice said, desperate.
"Lie with me?" He asked.
Also: tw for death and suicide! Please don't read if you are uncomfortable with those!
"I thought it looked to expensive and silky to have been done by the school. Merlin, that's what I was going to ask, how are the roommates?" Blaise's grin turned into a vaguely unamused and contemplative frown.
'Freestyle': hands gesturing in a rolling over each other fashion. Draco sighed at him. His first Saturday in the comfortable embrace of safety, and he was going to have to spend it worming secrets out of Pansy and continuously glaring at Blaise whenever he got an almost pitying look. Wonderful.
It did take a minute to, well, resolve the matter. After they eventually had finished arguing over the matter of 'No Grey, I am not asking to fuck you', Draco resumed to washing Grey's body, and afterwards, his face.
ago."
"Oh well, more for me then." She said, licking her lips lecherously in what was an attempt on a provocative action, which, if she weren't the Pansy Parkinson that Draco knew, would have been exceedingly attractive.
"Have you heard anything from father?" He asked, head angled down at his food, eyes angled up at Narcissa who went stiff as a board at the mention.
"Mother, I-" But he was far too high to have this conversation. He looked away, but as he did, he saw his father pick up a picture. Now Draco was by no means an idiot, quite the opposite really, but this had really been a major forthcoming of himself.
"And I always will. I don't like the feeling, mother. I don't like the people." He didn't look at her, kept his eyes steady and trained on the lake. She made a small sound that he didn't dare pretend he heard. She sat down beside him delicately.
before continuing the conversation.
His fiancés engagement ring
"I'm not having sex with you whilst my mother is in the same house." Despite being genuinely confused at this answer (kelpies, of course, are mostly solitary creatures. Grey didn't know either of his parents further than vague recollections), he let the matter drop, and so it was settled, though most of the settling of their more zoomed out picture of living had already been taken care of. Grey was simply to be an animal that Draco had picked up, a horse to replace the one he had lost many years ago.
He sighed into the air, but it came out as a strangled moan of pain. He wanted to see the moon, see the stars, but all he could see were the overcast clouds, the hard lashing of the rain that he wanted to shield his eyes against, but his energy was sapped.
When waking up, Draco liked to be perfect, to look perfect in the case of anyone being there, and so upon waking up, he sat up slowly, beautifully, and stretched with yawning joints and yearning thoughts. He was glad to find himself in the solace of his own bed, the silk sheets beginning to pool at his waist as he slowly roused, but could not think for the life of him upon how he came to be there. Blaise, thankfully was not in his bed, and he could hear the slow sounds of breathing from across the room drifting above the long curtains of the bed, noises which he knew belonged to him.
"I can't say that I agree Draco," She eventually said, turning her head to meet Draco's eyes. "But I'll never stop loving you darling. My offer still stands." Draco's hands covered his face, feathering over it gently.
Draco Malfoy was special because he was the man that the saviour of the wizarding world was so helplessly in love with. He was special because he knew Harry loved him and had the fucking audacity to be annoyed and even inconvenienced by the fact, as if it were something that would not go away, despite Draco’s best intentions.
Trigger warning! Major panic attack and slight discussion of depression/depressive behaviours.
"Leave him alone." Blaise snarled.
"I'll leave you here?" Sam asked reluctantly. Draco gave him a look that he had perfected over the years, a look that said: 'If you don't leave me the fuck alone in the next two minutes, I might snap your neck.' His words were perfectly civil, though.
"Come back in one piece." Draco turned round and winked at him before shutting the door behind him and striding through the considerably more empty common room, encountering no problems, only low murmurs. He left into the surprising cool of the castle, the not quite chill and walked briskly onward, vaguely wishing he had bought his coat instead of his book.
Harry began to cry again, because true to the note, in the jewellery box were many small slips of paper with writing on them. He picked one up.
"Has your father ever hit you?"
Thank you so much for reading!
"Harry Potter and Ron Weasley." Lupin said, looking very much like he did not want to be the one to deliver the news. Draco let a frown crease his brows, a long exhaling sigh. He massaged his temples to ward of the coming headache.
"Hm. I don't know. Everything was fine till I was about seven or eight, I think? That was a bit of a tipping point, I suppose. I don't recon it's gotten worse, per se, just... Creative." Lupin hated the word 'creative', which could hide a multitude of sins.
"Well, sort of. The dorms have had to be split up, so there are four people in each dorm." At Draco's sceptical, almost hostile look, he hastened to add to his statement. "Of course, you and Blaise are sharing, though."
It wasn't that he felt threatened, at least not that he believed, but anything could be used against him. Full and half veelas didn't quite have the rights that normal wizards did, and they could often fetch quite the pretty price when sold illegally. There was a reason he knew where to find Grey, after all. Coming down off his adrenaline high, he realised that this might not have been the best idea after all, and he bitterly regretted his heightened sense of defence and the fact that he had been bred on fear. He felt both guilty and too prideful to apologise. He could make the switch, but it really would look odd in perspective.
"And why is it going to be disposed of?" He asked, trying to regard the kelpie with feigned disinterest. The man raised an eyebrow.
"This is Draco," He said, arm curling around Draco's shoulders and thrusting him forward. He stumbled slightly, and with his head angled down, pupils up, he met Narcissa's gaze. He still remembered it. Whereas Lucius' had been unbridled joy, hers was unbridled fury. Her fists clutched at her sides. Draco wanted to run away. Lucius didn't need to finish his sentence; Narcissa knew exactly what was going on. "He's fixed everything for us. He's the perfect heir, and he's mine. There's only a little problem involving his blood, but other than that, don't you think he's wonderful?" The tone had been the expressive love that was often the type children yearned for, but all Draco could focus on was the anger in Narcissa's eyes as she watched him.
"Oh dear, it would appear I'm late."
Lucius Malfoy had been a very accomplished man at the age of thirty-three. He had a rich and honourable wife, a large fortune and an enviable job. What really should have been next was an heir, because it was only proper that he should have the perfect heir. As it transpired, Narcissa was unable to bear child, and no magical treatment would ensure her safety if she did. It was not fit for a pureblood to adopt, nor was it fit that he should take on a mistress to have his heir, and so they were stuck in an awful loop of wondering what they were to do about this unfortunate situation.
"Grey's not potentially dangerous." Draco drawled out, aggressively posh. He had to admit that an old fall back strategy was to fall heavily upon his father's heritage, though he suspected that this was more to do with the accent being beaten into him, and most times his aggression appeared to be aimed at his father, and needed to have a safe fall back. "Think about it really; aren't they the victim in this situation?" Sam, to his great surprise, laughed.
"All good things." Draco snorted. "Want to show me? I might get lost." Pansy rolled her eyes.
"You can drop me here, thank you mother. I'll call you a bit later, alright?" Narcissa turned to look at him, a small frown creasing her forehead.
"I've missed you too." Draco whispered back, taking her hand and kissing it softly. He felt eyes burning into him as the three of them strolled past to the rooms, all muted chatter shutting off completely in favour of glaring at the death eater scum that stood before them. Draco lifted his head up airily and didn't give them the time of day.
"And the-the veela thing? How long have you been dealing with that?" He asked. Best not to push too many boundaries, but to see where the lines lay, or lack thereof. Draco cocked his head, raised an eyebrow.
"Draco," He began, turning his face up to Draco's with such sorrowful eyes that Draco wanted to hit him for it. Then he did a double take, because the boy looking back at him did not look the same as he had a minute or two previous, and seemed so utterly horrified that it must've looked almost comical. His skin was glowing with the pale beauty of the moon, his features slightly sharper, more accentuated against this new looking skin, hair swaying in an unseen breeze, casting another gentle light golden glow. His eyes looked like grey opals, shining brightly even in the thin light of the office and casting coloured shadows across his under eyes, highlighting his sharp cheek bones.
room arrangements?"
"I suppose it is." Draco watched Sam with narrow slitted eyes.
"Fine. Do as you please, it's round the back of the manor. I trust you can find it?" Grey did not respond, but from where Draco stood looking over the manor grounds beyond the window, he heard the not so subtle shuffling of feet, the creaking of his carved wooden door, and then the click of the its close. He let out a breath into the empty space, one that seemed to echo around the room without the comfort of people to distil it.
"Um, ok?" It wasn't posed as a question, but it was a clear social signal of 'please go away now, it's two in the fucking morning' The smaller man had pulled out a photo. Harry's heart had dropped. It was a picture of Aidan, only he looked a bit younger, and he was wearing a suit, glowering unhappily at the camera.
"I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't that. The way our magic—fucking—
As he moves from Draco's mouth to his neck, nipping and sucking at the delicate skin, Draco huffs. The effect is somewhat lost by the way he's panting, but Harry gets the idea. "They were just meant to be
"Ah, fuck, you're good at this," Draco mutters, making something warm and satisfied spread through him. "That's how it'd go, after that first time. I'd picture—
, it's not all that different from his own story, but it's so hot to think of Draco, as frantic and needy as he'd been.
"Yield?" Draco asks softly, and Harry breathes in sharply when he realizes how close Draco is standing. He stares stubbornly at Draco's shoes, moving his wrists again to see if he might be able to get purchase. Draco's wand tilts down, the tip of it resting under his chin and guiding Harry's head upward, until he can look Draco in the eye. "Do you yield?" he asks again, voice low.
"What?" Harry asks, flummoxed. He'd just been about to make his excuses and cross this off his list for the week.
"I don't
He's glad he doesn't have to talk, because coherence is quickly going out the window as Draco speeds up his strokes, his tongue doing unbelievable things in Harry's mouth to go along with the slide of his hand. His other hand moves smoothly over Harry's body to drive him crazy—tweaking a nipple, sliding down his side, cupping his arse and squeezing. He becomes aware of a gasp and a needy whine and dimly realizes it's coming from him, but he doesn't have it in him to care about awkward noises. With Draco's complete focus on him, his orgasm rushes up fast, and he moans against Draco's lips as he surrenders to it, writhing under Draco's hands. Draco keeps going until Harry can't take it anymore, shying from his touch as he struggles to get his breath back.
Harry feels a pang of regret. "No, of course not. I didn't mean—"
"I know you're far from the most observant, Potter, but there is no bed in this room," Draco says, his swollen lips sliding into a smirk.
." Harry laughs as he soothes his tongue over the mark he's left. "At no point did I intend for
After three visits, he also started making regular visits to Narcissa Malfoy in her own, purposely separate safehouse. He couldn't handle one more stop by Malfoy's cottage with all the incessant questions about his mother's safety and comfort that he could not answer.
"Horny?" Harry suggests, his hands sliding into Draco's robes.
"Would you like some tea?"
Harry nods. "Alright."
"Well, this is the first time your visit has actually come with something useful. Sit down, I'll put the kettle on."
Draco's breath catches, and Harry shifts back, satisfied. He slides down Draco's body, leaving a trail of messy kisses as he goes, then stops, looking up at Draco expectantly.
During one of these visits, when their conversation comes to a comfortable silence, Draco surprises Harry by asking, "I don't suppose you'd be up for a duel?"
"Fine," Draco spits out. Harry offers his hand, and Draco doesn't hesitate to take it, to Harry's slight surprise. Within moments, they're back to having tea again, as pleasant as they ever are in each other's presence. The only difference is that, hidden beneath the folds of Harry's robes and the confines of his trousers, he's harder than he's ever been in his life.
Draco ignores him, brows dipping in annoyance, and Harry slows his movements. He leans forward until his lips brush Draco's ear and whispers, "If you tell me about it, I'll suck you off."
"You must admit you have a bit of a home-court advantage," Harry replies, watching the movements of Draco's wand carefully and dispelling his next hex before it can go off.
to each other's." He swallows audibly, a shudder running through him as Harry swallows around his cock. "I certainly thought you'd gloat, if you won. But you didn't. It's as exhilarating for you as it is for me, isn't it?" That's one word for it, Harry thinks, but he doesn't pause his movements over Draco's cock to respond. "Even after you'd gone, my magic was still buzzing underneath my skin. I couldn't resist—I shut myself in here and got a hand on myself as soon as I had the chance."
"Yeah, me," Harry says, pulling him into another kiss, making him moan this time. Even if it's more controlled than Harry's had been, he still feels a thrill knowing that he's gotten past Draco's carefully crafted defenses.
He licks his lips deliberately before meeting Draco's gaze again. "I'm sure."
"Fuck," Draco mutters, rubbing up against Harry's hip. "Come on, then."
"I know what tea is, Malfoy. This is just the first time you're offering it to me."
—short-sighted of me, I see now. Of course you go into everything with that same enthusiasm you bring to our duels." His breath dwindles as he rushes the end of his sentence, and his back arches as Harry takes him to the back of his throat. The gasps and grunts he hears as he brings Draco to the edge are intoxicating, so much so that he has to take his hand away from his own dick so he won't embarrass himself.
"Yes?" Harry prompts, twisting on the upstroke.
Groaning audibly, Draco quickly counters the spell, but he doesn't make any move to stand up. He glares at Harry from his position, and Harry feels livelier than he has in weeks.
"Tea, Potter. You have it with biscuits, if you're feeling adventurous."
"A duel?" Harry repeats, sure he's misheard. Draco's lips purse, a sure sign that he's one comment away from rolling his eyes. "What for?"
"When I thought of your mouth on me, I pictured you—more hesitant. That was—
"Take your time," Draco says, stretching over the comforter languidly. His cock is flushed against his pale skin, longer than Harry's but not as thick, and Harry aches to get his mouth on it.
"After our first duel," he begins, and Harry grins, gripping Draco's cock and licking a stripe along the underside. "You stayed for nearly an hour after. I thought you'd never leave."
"Take a nap with me and I can be one of those things."
Harry moans around Draco's dick and reaches down to stroke himself as he pictures it.
go rushing in blindly," Harry points out, ignoring Draco's snort. A thought occurs to him suddenly. "How many times have you thought about me while you were in this bed?"
What he didn't expect was how grateful Malfoy would be for the information.
"I yield," he manages between kisses, and Draco stiffens as he goes for his wand. He makes as if to move back as the ropes fall away, but Harry doesn't let him get far. He reaches up, one hand sliding to Draco's nape and the other to his hip, urging him down to his knees so that they're level with each other.
Harry had been visiting Draco Malfoy's safehouse at least once a week since the beginning.
After another four weeks of visits, they're on a first-name basis. Harry isn't sure what his life has become, but it seems the brightest part of his week is when he apparates to a discreet alley just outside of a Muggle village in order to pay a visit to Draco Malfoy.
"Just shut up and kiss me," Draco says, and Harry takes him up on it, kissing the smirk right off his face.
Watching Draco undress is mesmerizing, so much so that Harry almost forgets to do the same. He rushes to get rid of his clothes as well, barely getting a glimpse of Draco's shapely arse before he's falling back onto the bed.
Harry hums his interest, wanting Draco to go on both because he wants more details and because of how good it is to hear Draco's composure falling away.
"I've been thinking." She said, carefully, as though it might not be the right thing to say. "About that man your father spoke to you about. The man you shared a flat with?" She must've seen his change in posture, because her approach got softer, kinder. More careful, he thought. "I can take you to see him."
"I was right, wasn't I? It is Draco?" She asked, clearly doubting either her pronunciation or Harry's version of the story.
"You're going to do that anyway because you think it's funny." Draco laughed.
Here we dive into their first week apart! If you are so far enjoying the story, or think that there are things I can improve on, please do leave a comment because I love reading your thoughts!
"That would only work if it were you doing it, darling." He said to her. "Right, done." Pansy admired his handiwork in a conjured mirror, examining the sides with delicate fingers, nails painted some amalgamation of green and black.
"Lucius was just mentioning how much he loved both of us." Draco could have expected as much. He nodded, and it was the most serious topic that approached them all night.
"Aidan." It was almost spat out. He flinched. Harry felt the sick feeling grow. Aidan was never submissive in fights, in any altercations. He had never flinched, not as if Harry had just slapped him. "Who were those men?" It was a dangerous tone, now that the shock was fading, he could get a tighter grip on his anger.
"Yes Pansy, I'm quite sure that's what it is." The words were, inherently, mocking, and that was surely how Blaise meant them, but he said it with such a straight face that both Pansy and Draco were quite unable to respond, and were also quite unable to contain their laughter, much to their dismay. They both started laughing a little which really seemed to enrage most of the room, especially the Weasel seated next to Potter who's face was as red as his hair.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy." His father said. Draco blinked. It was the dangerous tone, the tone before bad things happened. "You took some finding, my loyal son." It was spat, and he was sure that his father was the only man in the world who could make the word 'son' sound like 'you fucking disappointment. I wish I could hit you.' Draco served no God, but a merciful one had surely been looking down on him.
The auror took his arm gently and led him out of the cell. Just a precaution, the guard had said when Draco had looked disdainfully at the arm on his bicep.
"Draco?" He asked the form. Grey was sitting on the surface of the water; he had travelled up at the quiet thrashing, the gentle violence that assaulted the shores. He had come up to the rain which beat down on his face. Grey smiled somewhat into the rain, a somewhat melancholic smile. He blinked aimlessly. He was sure that the form was Draco, for, who else would it be?
(See the end of the chapter for
It occurred to him, somewhere in this swirling tempest, that the hands felt real, because the tighter they became, the easier it was to breath through the drowning. He cast his head around, flailing in his own mind, trying to grab onto whatever would make him feel weightless, whatever would take him back. He knew what back was, that much he was certain, but the roots and vines did not shift their placement as the hands grew tighter, pushing deeper into him, despite the fact it seemed to quell the tides and pull him up, out of the turmoil below. He'd never been here before, never seen these sights, but a unseen vine seemed to reach up and hold onto him, not pulling him down of latching him there, but drifting up with him like a tether that kept him there.
"Is that a challenge?"
"You'll have to stop doing that Blaise, you look unbelievably sexy. Yes Pansy darling, the gifts were wonderful. I love them." He didn't say it, but they all knew what it meant. Draco wasn't quite the kind of person to say 'I love you' so this was about as close as it got. The pair of them genuinely smiled, wide and bright, and Pansy wound both of her arms around Draco's right one, leaning into his shoulder.
"Please call this number if you see him again. Thank you." And with that, they disappeared from the door, heading down the landing. Harry shut the door in a state of shock, card still clutched tightly in his hand. He looked down at it. It appeared to be a buisness card, not only supplying a number. It was addressed by a man named 'Lucius Malfoy'. Harry wasn't sure what emotion possessed him more: anger, shock or the depression of being betrayed. The music had stopped, no longer floating dreamily from the kitchen. As he rounded the corner to enter, he saw Aidan beginning to tidy away the expensive champagne glasses. His hands were shaking though, and he dropped one, shards smashing at his feet.
"As they say, news of our death has been greatly exaggerated." The glamor felt nicer off, and he was reminded of the freedom he had in his own house without his father present.
"Fine then, I'll bite. Yes, he's hit me." He was amazed, honestly, at how quickly he could flip the switch. Bi polar, Pansy had called it after a particularly vicious fight they had had. Lupin seemed amazed too, though he didn't dare voice his opinion to Draco in fear of angering him again, just nodded in an understanding manner, clearly upset.
Nothing moved. The peacocks were gone, but there was still the afterthought of them, the idea of the royal blue. Serenity looked like complete numbness because that's what it was to Draco. It was dying.
Harry Potter fell in love with Aidan Baskerville in the summer of 2001, mid July. He knew this specific date because he had written it down, the first time that they had met, then the first time that they had gone out for coffee, which had turned out not to be just a single cup of coffee, it had turned out to be an entire date. This was by no means to say that Harry Potter was a man who believed in love at first sight, for he was quite the opposite. He believed that love had to be proven, that if you loved someone at first sight, then they must be an incredibly attractive.
The ground was wet and coated in layers of mud, but Grey's steps were much surer than Draco's, and he ran on without a problem till he came to he door.
"Oh." He said. "Harry." She nodded, smiling in that slightly sad way. She took a small notebook from her pocket and ripped out a page and wrote down an address.
"Draco," He said, sighing again. "Please talk to me." Draco went deadly still, not even shaking, just watching Blasie with his venomous grey eyes that screamed 'don't finish that thought'. Both of them knew Draco wasn't going to move, to say anything until Blaise either played it off or made a move. It was a stalemate, and they both knew it. Neither of them made the first move, and in the recess of his psyche, Draco knew he was to much of a coward to make it when it was against Blaise. "I know," He sighed, "I know you're depressed. You hide it well, but we're your best friends." He looked at Draco with such soft eyes that they almost didn't suit his face.
"Draco." He replied. It was weighed down with the awkwardness of waking up and the uncertainty of talking to someone you had rather bizarrely saved from drowning himself. "Feeling better?" And it was the weirdest thing he had ever been asked, with the added stupidity of lying in a bath with a man who he had known for one day lounged half outside of it. The first time he had accidently done this, no one had asked him if he were alright, and to be honest, when they were all senior death eaters and the dark lord himself, he rather preferred it. At this point though, it was all he could do to keep a straight face.
Grey never was any good at healing magic. He had never been taught. He had seen someone rescued from his loose morals, though, but once.
I'm back!
"We could shout at them?" She suggested airily, and Draco knew that Blaise was eyeing him.
