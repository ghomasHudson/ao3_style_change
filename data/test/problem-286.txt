Harry cleared his throat and looked over at Malfoy’s desk, where he appeared to be sitting deep in concentration. As Harry’s eyes lingered, he could see that Malfoy’s reading glasses were balancing on the tip of his nose, and something that sounded suspiciously like snoring reached his ears. Harry couldn’t suppress a smile. Malfoy looked so peaceful in his sleep. He was usually so strict, and his hard yet handsome features always made him look like a right twat. But now, his face looked soft and inviting. In a platonic way, of course. It was Malfoy for Merlin’s sake. Surely one could appreciate fine features in a friend. Harry could even admit that Ron was a nice looking bloke as well.
“Leaving?” he asked in a light voice, but Draco could see that his expression was not as breezy as his tone suggested.
Draco had one hand left on Harry’s arse, leaving his hole exposed only for Draco. He let his thumb rubbing circles around it, and then gently pushed the tip in, only to pull it out again. The second time, he let his thumb go further, and felt the heat inside of Harry, imagined his own cock doing the same.
“Um, yes?” Harry answered, feeling a bit sheepish. Malfoy let out a big sigh. “So, you stopped me? Every time?”
Harry nodded and scratched the back of his head. “It’s not much to look at but it’s soft, and it’ll keep you warm through the night.” He backed towards the stairs. “I’ll be in my room upstairs if you need anything. Goodnight, Draco.”
“It’s Hermione's birthday today. If you’re free tonight you should swing by the Leaky and grab a pint with us.”
Draco cleared his throat. “I don’t want to go home right now.” Maybe his honesty could be blamed on the residue of the alcohol, but he had a feeling Harry wouldn’t judge him for it. “I haven’t been spending much time at home for a while now.”
He went inside one of the stalls and spelled the toilet lid clean before he sat down. He closed his eyes, trying to make sense of the weird feeling that struck him everytime Potter clearly dismissed him. He already had this conversation with himself several times before, what Potter and other people thought of him didn’t matter. He shouldn’t have to lock himself in the restroom and have a personal crisis. It was a nice evening. Ron and Granger had both made him feel welcome, and Luna had offered a sense of forgiveness and calmness he hadn’t thought he craved. Draco opened his eyes and looked around at his pathetic hiding place. He should continue his evening out, try to have a good time. Maybe talk to Luna some more. Just when he was about to leave the stall, the door to the restroom opened and Ron’s voice came through.
Potter stood and went to grab some books and pamphlets from a shelf in his room, handing them out to the three of them. Andromeda put hers and Narcissa’s away in her purse, while Draco looked through them, not really getting what he was looking at.
Draco swallowed and looked down briefly at his hand on Harry’s leg, then he looked up again and met Harry’s eyes. “You,” Draco said, still feeling lost for words, but that much he knew. Feeling honest and somewhat brave he let his hand wander a couple of inches upwards on Harry’s thigh. “Just you.”
Potter looked up from his shoes, a surprised look on his face. “Well, if you put it like that.” He was quiet for a couple of seconds. “Though it’s not like you to disregard blood relationships, is it?” He finally met Draco’s eyes, a small smirk playing on his lips.
Harry squinted and looked around the room. His eyes landed on an angelic figure, sitting in his dressing chair at the corner of his room.
“Since when do you call him Draco? And why would I talk to him before you? We don’t talk! And wait, what do you mean before you do? You talk to him?”
Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s hair in a soothing motion and then placed a kiss at Draco’s temple. “Come on love, let’s go home.”
“You know very well that I have no say in what name the Department of Alias comes up with, just go with it and stop making a fool of yourself.” Harry undid the spell, looking around to see if anyone was keeping an eye on them, but further down the aisle a baby was screaming, so no one seemed to have noticed anything odd. Draco slumped even further down his seat, staring at the back of the chair before him.
Ron nodded. “I know, but we’re still grateful. I promise you that the streets are a better place without the content of Mr Finley’s boxes being out there. And now we have everything we need to keep him. If we find him, that is. We thought we had him a couple of days ago but we lost track of him.” Ron scrunched up his face. “Sorry, that was too much information. Forget that I said anything.”
They sat in silence for a while. Draco knew that none of them would ever get over the loss of his wife and Scorpius’ mother, and neither did he want them to. It wasn’t a marriage based on love between the two of them, but loved her he had. She became his best friend, and losing her was like losing one of the very reasons to live. The only reason Draco didn’t leave this world with her was Scorpius, who meant everything to him, someone he would never abandon or let anything bad happen to. Draco had sworn to be a better person, a better dad than his own, and give Scorpius the life he deserved. Nothing Draco had done before in his life had made him worthy of Scorpius, he was well aware of that. But, he fought every day for a reason to believe that he deserved to be his father.
Draco, too shocked to deflect the other blow, took another slap across his face before he reacted and held his mother in a firm grip against him. She screamed and tried to break loose but he wouldn’t let her. “It’s me, mother. It’s me. Calm down,” He begged her.
“Shut up, you git,” Draco said, punching Harry lightly on his shoulder, trying very hard not to smile, totally failing if Harry’s answering grin was anything to go by. “I’m not using the Ministry’s showers. Their soap is atrocious. It’s my shower or no shower,” he said, with as much false bravery he could muster. “And then we’ll eat at my place. I hate crowds.”
Harry nudged Draco so that he was looking at him again. “But you can, and you have. For a long time you did everything on your own, and that’s okay. But now, this is different, you know? Your mother needs help, help that you can’t provide. And that’s not your fault, that’s just how it is.”
“I didn’t date Charlie, you know that. We kissed, once!” Harry smiled, and started walking again. “My big bisexual awakening, I told you about that. Perhaps you were too busy dancing on the — “
It was the beginning of March and work had been busier than usual, something was happening but Draco couldn’t figure out what. The Aurors had stopped coming a week prior and the boxes were starting to pile up. The ones that usually went into Mr Finley’s office were piled behind the counter, and the man himself hadn’t been around for the last couple of days. Draco was a bit worried about leaving all their inventory out in the open as he didn’t know what they contained, and if the Aurors decided to stop by again he had no means to stop them from searching through the boxes.
Draco dropped his quill at the sound of Potter’s voice. He was standing by the door, in a pair of Muggle jeans and a grey T-shirt that showed off a body that Draco wanted to devour. He tried looking everywhere else than on Potter, but at last Draco couldn’t help himself from checking him out, letting his gaze travel from head to toe, noticing how Potter, unlike before, seemed relaxed. When he looked up again he could see a tiny smile on Potter’s face.
Draco could feel his stomach clench with anticipation. He stood up and approached Potter. A sliver of fear ran through his body, and just to be sure he actually understood what this meant, he put his hands on each side of Potter on the table, caging him, and leaned forward, whispering in his ear. “Prove yourself?”
Narcissa took a step closer and carded her fingers through Draco’s sleep tousled hair, putting the strands behind his ear. She stilled her hand as she looked out through the window. After a few seconds, she shook her head and removed her hand from Draco. She gave them both a little smile before she headed for the door.
”Malfoy’s don’t do fun, Potter! We do sophisticated activities,” Draco said while folding his paper.
Lucius looked at him, then he shook his head, clasping his hands at the table in front of him. “Not for a couple of days, why?”
“No need to be crude!” Draco said as he discreetly shoved Blaise off him, without trying to make a scene. “That ship has sailed a long time ago.”
Harry continued reading with Scorpius leaning against him, and Draco had to once again look away from them, only to see Andromeda’s warm smile directed at him. Draco excused himself and went into the kitchen, he needed a moment to compose himself.
Draco was too angry to focus on Mr Finley right now, he was more upset about being called out by his father, knowing that everything he said about Draco was right.
“To what do I owe the pleasure of being awoken by my beautiful mother this morning?” Draco asked, as he seated himself against the headboard, Scorpius snuggling up against him.
Harry exhaled slowly before he leaned over and captured Draco’s lips with his. He tasted of firewhiskey, the lingering drops made his mouth scorching hot. Draco traced Harry’s lips with the tip of his tongue, making Harry moan, the sound shooting straight to Draco’s crotch. When Harry opened his mouth a little, Draco took advantage of it, pressing against him harder as their kiss deepened. Draco let go of Harry’s thigh, ignoring his sweaty palms and he took a firm grip at the back of Harry’s head to press him impossibly closer. Harry kissed him with a fierceness he hadn’t felt before, like he was something delicious that needed to be devoured. One of Harry’s hands was now pressing against Draco’s growing erection, and he couldn’t help but huff out a breathy laugh at his own desires becoming apparent.
Draco squeezed back. “I’m interested. I just really thought you still hated me, after all these years.”
If that was supposed to make Draco feel better it did no such thing. Now he felt even worse for making Harry sleep on that hideous furniture.
“Dora, with all due respect. Can we please stop gossiping about Potter? I really need to get some work done.”
Biddle gave him a stern look and continued, “It could sort itself out, but with a little help we think we can get most of your memories back.”
Draco felt torn about the nice words from Ron, and Potter’s hostile feelings towards Draco. He didn’t think it would affect him in this way, feeling lonely and pathetic in a bathroom stall, the small lingering hope that he and Potter could be friends, crushed like dirt under a shoe.
This time Malfoy cut him off. “Because I made you do it. Because I’m sick and tired of stopping you from doing stupid things at night, when all I want is to go to sleep, and if sleeping with you beside me makes you stay inside of the dorms and not trying to off yourself, I will fucking do it, Potter.”
Draco blushed, “Oh, fuck you, Potter.” He dragged the blanket over his head as he heard Harry’s soft laugh disappearing down the corridor.
Draco sat at a hidden café when an owl landed on his table. He recognised it as Blaise’s and took the letter, handing the bird the last of his churros.
Draco had been standing outside the Leaky for five minutes just staring at the building. He could see people milling around inside, laughter filtering out through the door. There were approximately ten steps left and then he would be inside. The problem was that taking those final steps seemed insurmountable. He was clutching a wrapped present in his left hand, a code notebook he’d found in the store. He thought Granger would appreciate the intricate puzzle that had to be solved to get the book to open. In his other hand, he held a small bouquet of lilies he’d plucked from the garden. He felt stupid like he was going on a date, but he had no interest in Granger, or Ron for that matter, he just wanted to make a good impression. He brought the bouquet up to his nose and smelled the flowers, then he threw them away. Petals scattered across the alley by the whoosh of air that came from the door to the Leaky that was flown open, revealing Potter at the entrance. He looked startled, staring at Draco, eyes going over him and then on the ground, then back up again.
“No, I’ve…” Harry almost had the urge to tell Malfoy about his sleepwalking but that would be absurd wouldn’t it? But he remembered Hermione telling him that Malfoy wasn’t a bad person. And perhaps it was easier telling someone he knew wouldn’t care or worry about him than telling one of his friends. Malfoy was gazing at him with a look that told him to go on.
“I didn’t even finish my question! You don’t know what I was about to say!” Harry said as he followed Malfoy’s lead and went to get his things.
Draco didn’t say anything, just waved his hand and wordlessly cast a cooling charm over Potter, who shuddered in response.
Harry took off his glasses and rubbed at his eyes. He couldn’t do this anymore. He just wanted to take the floo home, grab something to eat and then sleep for a few hours before the whole thing started all over again. To top things off, he had to do a presentation tomorrow for the Muggle Prime Minister, to tell him about the benefits of incorporating Muggle police exercises in the auror training program. He was so unprepared, but he gathered that he could write up his presentation before going to bed. Besides, Malfoy was doing the presentation with him and he had been working on his part for a couple of weeks now. Maybe Harry could borrow some notes.
Draco felt his cheek blush as he still stood very close to Potter, and he took a step back making Potter’s hand fall off his shoulder. “I’m not hurt, Potter. I just… they won’t let my mother see a Healer. I lost my temper, it won’t happen again.” Draco looked down.
“Unless you don’t want to do it?” Draco asked, scared that he managed to screw this up as well as his previous attempts to get along with Potter.
Harry clearly took it as an invitation, because he dragged Draco towards him again and kissed him more firmly. The intensity of the kiss made Draco gasp and part his lips. The heat pooling in his stomach made it harder to breathe. He tried to get closer to taste more of Harry’s mouth, but they were both in awkward positions because of the chairs, so Draco had to draw back again. They were both panting, looking at each other. Harry licked his lips and Draco couldn’t help but trace his fingers lightly over them, smiling when Harry’s breath hitched.
“I don’t know, it stopped before I found out which room it was coming from,” Hermione answered with a big yawn. “Well then, I’m going to sleep, you can tell Draco I’m sorry if you see him before I do.” Hermione started walking towards the stairs.
He had a brief thought that maybe he should contact Ron, he owed him that much, but was he able to leave the one thing that gave him time to breathe and hide away from the world?
He and Astoria had lived in a beautiful little house on the outskirts of London, making it easy for both of them to date muggles without anyone other than them knowing. Since they got Scorpius their outings to muggle London had been fewer and fewer, but Draco’s attempts at having a relationship with his parents again had increased. When Astoria died, the only logical reasoning was for him to move back to the only family he had left.
He sighed as he went around the counter, looking through their transaction papers. Name after name of purebloods he knew from briefly meeting them while he was younger, who all gave him a fake smile when they came by and collected their packages from Mr Finley. Draco always gave them a polite smile and wished them a pleasant day, while silently judging himself for not taking a bigger stand against them. A coward, that’s what he has been for a long time in his life. A coward during his younger years, hiding behind his father, a coward at the beginning of the war, a coward after the war, pushing away the help that was offered, and a coward now, running away from his mother’s disease and his stupid feelings towards Potter.
He didn’t see his friends that often, most of the former Slytherins had moved elsewhere after the war. He had a weekly chat with Pansy, who was living in Bordeaux, married to a pureblood wizard with an enormous wine garden, but their conversations felt more mandatory as they didn’t have much in common anymore. He sometimes visited Blaise in Italy when he could get a couple of days off work. Scorpius loved staying with Blaise, so it was too bad they couldn’t do it as often as they liked. Draco had lost touch with Greg after the war, he didn’t know where he was now and all his owls were left unanswered.
“Indeed I have. How great of you to notice.” Malfoy turned to Pansy. “Do you mind leaving me a minute alone with Mr Sloshed over here?”
Harry was in the middle of a shot race with Seamus, when he got the brilliant idea that he should inform Malfoy what a good partner he was. He’d never told Malfoy how much he appreciated him and how much Harry enjoyed working with him, but he should totally do that right away.
“Yes! And the idea is brilliant, thank you very much!” Draco answered, then turned to Blaise. “So! Where are we going? I trust you got my list of places that was out of the question?”
“I’ve tried that, it doesn’t work. I don’t know how I do it, I’m not even carrying my wand and still manage to take down every spell and walk out of my room every night,” he said, slumping down on the sofa next to a standing Malfoy.
“Huh,” Harry said again. “I’m in love with Draco Malfoy?” he asked out loud, mostly to himself, but Ron answered anyway.
Harry was just about to answer with a snarky comment, when the door to their office opened and Ron stuck his head in.
Draco looked around the room as he went to his mother and plucked the toy out of her hands. Scorpius didn’t care much for darkness, and the tiny stars that Draco had spelled on his ceiling gave the room a soft glow, as did the light from the windows, the sky not quite darkening in the nights of late May. He gently put an arm around his mother and steered her out of Scorpius’ room.
“Oh, get over yourself Harry! Of course we talk, he’s in all my classes! Besides, we’re both planning to become healers, and we’re going spend a lot of time together if we both pass our N.E.W.Ts, which we will. I don’t see any point holding grudges anymore, do you?” Hermione finished with a sigh.
He didn't want Scorpius to be raised in a house filled with black magic, and even though he knew that the ministry had done a thorough search after the war, he couldn’t help but worry that they’d missed something. After several attempts to get someone from Gringotts to the Manor, getting one sorry excuse after another why they wouldn’t bother, Draco was fed up and complained to Andromeda about it in passing during one of their Floo calls. The next day Bill Weasley showed up on their doorstep with several colleagues in tow. Bill gave Draco a nod, and several hours (and two of Bill’s colleagues off to St Mungo’s) later, they were done, and the house was cleared to move into. He and Scorpius now had their own wing of the Manor, one that wasn’t afflicted from the war and tainted with bad memories of Voldemort.
Draco turned and looked at Potter, who still had a tense vibe all over him, not really meeting Draco’s eyes. “I appreciate the offer, but no. I’m late for my date.” Draco said, taking a last look on Potter face who suddenly looked a bit more closed off. If he didn’t knew better, he would say that Potter looked disappointed, but that was a crazy thought so Draco shook it off.
Draco swallowed. “Don’t you dare compare me to that moron.” He tried to snarl, but it came out more breathless than intended. He was nervous, and nothing good could ever come out of being nervous around Potter.
“I like you.” There, Harry said it, and his heart was beating out of his chest. But all of this must mean Malfoy kind of like him back, right?
“Pfft, Ernie, you’re no fun!” Draco said while poking Harry in the face with his index finger, probably aiming for his nose but ending up smudging Harry’s glasses. “Ma’am!” Draco shouted, raising his glass in the air and waving it around, “another one of these, please!”
Draco stared at Harry, trying to make sense of what just happened. He could feel his breath hitch and his mouth opening slightly, not quite believing that the touch was real. Harry seemed to take his silence as something bad so he dropped Draco’s hand.
“He’s my son, and he will talk the way he damn pleases.” Draco turned to Scorpius and whispered in his ear, “Don’t say damn.”
Draco was about to turn around again, not bothering with an answer, when he caught the look of Scorpius who looked expectantly at him. Unfortunately, Draco had taught him to always listen to people's apologies, and forgive them if the apology seemed worthy of forgiveness. It was hard not to be a hypocrite as a parent.
“You should see yourself, Harry. Your hole glistening with my come. It’s the best fucking thing I have ever seen.”
. And here he’d been dismissive towards Harry for months, claiming he knew how Harry felt about him when he clearly had it the wrong way. Draco tried to cover up more of his face in shame. Harry thought that Draco hated him? Draco didn’t hate Harry, how could he? It wasn’t possible to hate Harry with his perfect... his perfect everything.
“I know. And I did, I think. I tried to build my own life with Astoria and Scorpius, but when she died I became dependent on my parents again.”
“I don’t hate you.” He didn’t look to see Harry’s expression but he could hear him groan as the flames swept him away.
The next night he was heading towards the fireplace, only waking up when he burnt his fingertips. The night after that he was standing at the great lake with some sort of barrier stopping him from fondling the giant squid. The third night he was in the middle of the Forbidden Forest rustled awake by a galloping thestral, who missed him by a couple of inches, and the fourth night he was lying awake in his bed refusing to go to sleep. He knew he had let this sleepwalking thing go on for too long and if he didn’t do anything about it soon there wouldn’t be any chances left. He’d cheated death a couple of times too many, and no one likes a cheat.
Harry kept looking at him and gave him a little nod, but somehow his face looked like he was bothered by something.
“Oh! We’re allowed to sleep? Why didn’t you say so?” Draco closed his eyes, and fell asleep after a couple of minutes.
He slowly opened the door to the eighth year common room, hoping it would be empty this time of night, but it never was. On one of the sofas Malfoy was asleep, as usual. That was another thing that was new this year, except from the sleepwalking: sharing a dorm with all four houses. When McGonagall had told them this first thing when they’d arrived at the castle, worried looks had been sent over to Harry, but he couldn’t even find it in himself to be annoyed about it. He couldn’t find himself caring much at all about mundane things like sharing spaces with people he didn’t like; he’d done it most of his life so what was one more year to him? The first couple of days he’d tried to keep up with Ron’s complaining, just so he wouldn’t notice how off Harry was, but he couldn’t muster up the energy and soon Ron just stopped saying anything about it at all.
Draco nodded while Scorpius hugged him from behind, his tiny hands clasping over Draco’s stomach. “I’m going to go to St Mungo’s and bring grandma home, okay?” he whispered while he turned around and gathered Scorpius in a proper hug. “Will you be okay with Nimly while I’m away or do you want me to call Andromeda?”
Potter took a step closer, “I can try to make you remember. Please, Draco! Could you please give me a chance to make you remember us?”
Draco gave Potter a nod, then he bent down and gathered his pamphlets. Before he left he turned around, “Thank you, Potter. It means a lot.” He closed the door behind him and let out a big sigh.
“The condition? I’m sorry, could you repeat it again?” Draco felt a flush creeping up his cheeks as it was obvious that he hadn’t been listening to what Potter was saying.
“You were only doing your job as I was doing mine.” Draco finished his drink and gestured at the bartender to get another one. “I knew he did something that wasn’t right, but he never told me or put me in a bad spot. And he was the only one who would hire me so I accepted the job when he offered it to me. I have to be grateful for that.”
“I really do, all of you,” Harry said, leaning forward and brushing his lips against Draco’s cheek. Draco closed his eyes and hummed in response.
“Stop putting words in my mouth, Draco. You know that it’s only a matter of time,” Harry said, looking sad.
“I’ve fantasised about this,” Draco confessed. “You, kissing me, your hand on my–” Draco cleared his throat and almost whispered out the last word  “–cock.”
Michael snorted at the same time Draco coughed out a “No!” They both looked at him. “I mean yes! Yes, we’re going down. In the elevator.”
Nowadays he did see Ron from time to time when he visited Draco’s workplace in the line of his job as an Auror. He was the only one of the Aurors who treated Draco with respect, and for that, he was ever grateful. He wished he worked somewhere else, giving something back to society, but he hoped that Ron could see that he had changed and had become a better person.
Draco sighed. “Yes! Just take the sofa as usual. You know where the beddings are.” He gave Harry a little nod and left the room.
Draco and Michael only came as far as outside the Ministry when Draco kissed his cheek and wished him a good night. Somehow he wasn’t feeling it anymore. He disapparated before Michael could say anything.
Harry let out a massive sigh as he slumped further down in his chair. It had been the longest day at work: First, he and Malfoy managed to stop a robbery down in Knockturn Alley, and later they arrested a young wizard who was dealing illegal potions in muggle London, just before they had to rush off and question a couple of witnesess regarding a murder investigation, and after
“Potter! Potter?” Harry was dragged from his fantasies to a bewildered looking Malfoy, “Merlin, I was kidding. No need to get your knickers in a twist.”
“Bert?” Draco said, like he was trying out how the name sounded if he pronounced it differently. “Why did you choose Bert?”
Harry seemed to have caught on because he started kissing down Draco’s neck. “Did I do this?” He slowly sank down on his knees in between Draco’s legs and pushed them apart to fit himself against Draco.
Harry took Draco’s hand and led him into his office. Instead of sitting behind his desk he sat beside Draco in one of the visitors' chairs, still holding on to his hand.
Draco looked down at his son, smiling a little. “Did you have fun with your grandparents last night? I’m sorry I had to work late on your birthday.” Draco had tried to get away early, but being a Malfoy these days didn’t come with an advantage. If your boss told you to work, you worked.
“Come, Harry! Do it! I want to feel you.” Draco slammed in harder, still stroking Harry as well as he could manage. Hot liquid started to spill over Draco’s knuckles, and Harry clenched down hard as he came, making guttural sounds that Draco knew he would do anything to hear again. With one final push, Draco was coming as well, plastering himself over Harry’s back. Draco kept his hand on Harry’s cock as he spurted inside him, breathing hard into Harry’s neck. A hiss from Harry made him let go of his cock, and he started to pull out.
Their second day was spent either in silence or mean bickering. Harry wanted to go to the beach, Draco called him a simple tourist and wanted to go to Park Güell. Harry wanted to eat tapas at a tourist trap on Las Ramblas, Draco called him stupid and made reservations for a much more expensive restaurant. The food was terrible. They spent the last day apart and Draco felt awful.
They were supposed to act like business partners in hotel management, going to Tenerife to explore if they could expand their market. Their real mission was to keep an eye on a wizard who was on parole from Azkaban but had left the country even though he wasn’t allowed to. They were tracking one of his former friends who had suddenly been making several trips to Tenerife and back. It wasn’t a high risk-mission, more like a routine one, but the Department of Alias had gone all out making up background stories for both of them. Harry had suggested that perhaps the names Bert and Ernie were a bit suspicious, but that had earned Harry a stern look from the department head, and a couple of extra pages to read, which took them a week to go through. Though Draco seemed to have tweaked his story a little, judging from the small hiccups Harry could hear from beside him.
After visiting Andromeda on his birthday, her comment about his mother had left a sour aftertaste in his mouth. Andromeda had called her distracted, and as much as Draco had had that feeling himself, he hadn’t thought that anyone else had noticed. Draco tried to keep a closer eye on his mother after his visit to Andromeda, to see if things had become worse from what he thought they were before. There weren't any big changes in her behaviour, nothing exactly out of the ordinary. She was a bit quieter, but she had been that way since the war, they all were, except for his father, of course. He kept talking about the big plans that never happened, and about great ideas that now were lost. This was one of the reasons why he didn’t understand why his father was sentenced to house arrest instead of going to Azkaban. But, at least he couldn’t do much damage inside of their house, and even Lucius knew not to talk about his beliefs with Scorpius present.
Draco did what Harry asked, and he moaned shamelessly when Harry arranged him on his knees with his arse high in the air. He muttered a wandless cleaning spell into one of Harry’s pillows, and Harry huffed a tiny laugh into the base of his spine. Even though he anticipated it, the first feel of Harry’s tongue against his hole made him clench, and the tip of Harry’s tongue traced his rim until he relaxed again. It had been a long time since anyone had done this to him, and Draco knew that nothing in the past could compare to this. Harry was alternating between broad strokes and tiny licks against his arsehole, and Draco tried not to push back against Harry’s face but when a blunt fingertip almost petted his hole he rocked back a little, and was rewarded with a finger slowly inching into him, then carefully out.
“Fuck,” he says-- without roots to stabilize it, the soil in the beds is bound to get everywhere. Summoning all his strength, Draco casts the strongest, widest Impervius he can manage and floats it over the entirety of the garden so that the rain rolls safely off and into the neighboring yards. Success.
Harry has pulled in front of the townhouse in a rickety and rusted-up white truck. The manual-adjustment windows have been rolled down, and one of Harry’s tan, corded arms hangs out the driver’s side. He’s a rugged, sexy vision, in a muscle tee and low bun, but Draco’s not about to say that.
On the other hand that means that I have to resign the role of your healer to Dr. Okafor and Dr. Bulstrode. It would hinder my ability to assess your state of health if I lived in such a close relationship with you. It was actually not an ideal thing from the start, what with my feelings for you, but at the point, I knew that there was no colleague who could have coordinated the beginning of your treatment. As we have found out the unknown aspect of it, (and I didn’t consider it on time), all the medical treatment can without loss be passed on to my colleagues.
Draco’s mop of blond hair is slick to his forehead. Harry, though, is positively glowing. He yanks a tattered sheet of printer paper from his jeans pocket, tracing his own messy script with a thumb nail. Without waiting for Draco, he disappears into a labyrinth of fragrant greenhouses, a creaky cart dragging behind him.
The coin vibrates from within his trouser pocket, and he leaps to his feet. “Wait here for just a moment,” he says, and pushes open the screen door with a whoosh.
“Well, see for yourselves,” Hagrid said, stepping aside to reveal Ichabod, who was sitting on the stone floor beside the stove.
The chance to be your friend now feels like a privilege I never thought possible. I feel so comfortable in your company. Don’t worry about monopolising my leisure time; I can say no if I feel like it, it’s just that I don’t. Yes, Mother and Pansy see less of me these days, but Mother plans to invite you over (don’t worry, not to the Manor but to our London flat), and Pansy has a girlfriend now and is busy herself. She only calls my spellphone to
Harry catches his eyes with an exasperated smirk. “Sure thing. The kitchen’s sort of inaccessible though-- I’m in the process of soaking my bulbs. They’re all over the counter.”
The day did not improve after that. For one, they lost the Immunity Challenge. For another, Tara tried to talk strategy.
is the best of the best. Draco hopes he’s right; it takes a hefty sum to convince them to come on such a short notice. Harry’s landlord expects him to be packed and vacated ten days from Friday, so on Thursday afternoon Draco floos to the cramped office of the landscapers straight from work.
Draco smiled, relief making his muscles weak and his head loopy. “It couldn’t just be good genes?” She twisted her face in mock deliberation, then shook her head. He giggled. “You’re right. I have terrible genes.”
Malfoy looks confused, but he sets his jaw and shakes Harry’s hand. His grip is awkwardly soft, like he has loosened it for Harry’s benefit. Malfoy opens his mouth and then closes it again. “If I could repent,” he says, “I’d try to pretend it never happened, too. Good luck, Potter.” And then he turns and walks away.
Draco catches up to Harry in the far back of the nursery. He’s whistling as he scoops mulch and fertilizer from towering piles into sacks, every few seconds stopping to inspect a leaf or branch of one of the many items in his dolley.
Strong fingers massage his arse, squeezing as they press towards his hole, and his hips buck, grinding down against Draco’s cock. He is straddled on top, a tendon in his thigh spasming as the tension in his core, in his nerves is pulled ever tighter.
Draco nodded. “I think that’s part of it, but without new Ley Line magic coming up from the ground, they would lose their charge over time. When I felt the Rai stones, they didn’t seem to be depleted, just sort of dormant. Their magic was deep inside of them, almost hidden.”
Before I got your arm half-charred, I’d have told you all about the hippogriff feather in the attic or the finger painting on the dresser. I found a photo of my father and Sirius at the fair. I wish I was healthy enough to ride roller coasters-- I think I would have liked it if you had taken me. I’d probably puke on someone’s shoes, though, or apparate half the patrons into the Atlantic. Maybe someday, if it’s not too late.
She lifts to her tippy-toes to smack a kiss to his cheek, and he pulls her in by the back of her floral sundress for a quick hug.
Draco’s fly has already been mostly unzipped to make room for Harry’s hand, and he pushes his jeans to his ankles the moment they land, palms over Harry’s own on his arse.
After about two hours (Draco was still awake, still working on his tasks), Harry had the same nightmare as always, but that time it seemed more...real. He couldn't move or breathe, Voldemort would have take him...
"I forgave you. You said a lot of horrible things, it's true, but we were young... I said terrible things, too. Anyway, I'm not the person you should apologize for that. Otherwise I forgave you. I saw you, on the Astronomy Tower, lower you wand... I heard you and I understood. You were scared. As we all were. You were ready to spare Dumbledore's life. You saved me, at your house and your mum... Without her I probably would not be here. I understood how fool I was. You have never been an enemy, you were just terrified. I think" He admitted, leaving Draco speechless.
A evening, Harry was playing with Draco's flower when (from where, he still doesn't know) Luna went out, looking at his gift "Oh, Harry, it's so sweet! Who are you gonna give it to?"
Even Draco was getting paranoid, blacking out the windows and staying up past the crack of daylight doing research. He contacted the estate agent, inquiring whether there were any reports of curses on the house and scoured periodicals for similar stories. Harry, however, was already convinced of the source. The problem would be getting Draco to believe him.
“I based my decision based on how I felt I would have voted. Since my values in the game are social skills, reliability, and personability, I felt Harry was the biggest threat to my game and the closest player to my style, whereas I didn’t feel I would have voted for you if I were on the Jury.”
Draco is busy re-tying the apron around his waist. “Right, right,” he says in an exaggerated American accent, “I’ll be showing you an example of my artistic process, but I’ll be using this gentleman here as my canvas! Don’t worry, it washes out!” Harry smirks as Jason and Fred share another look.
Yes, I wrote that I was grateful to you, but, in my experience, gratitude is a common feeling among friends and family. I’m also grateful to Pansy because, when I was in the worst of my depression, she didn’t leave my side for days, thus keeping me from self-harming and for making sure I took my antidepressant potions.
The sun burns lurid through a broken skylight, refracting off every particle of dust hanging in the air until the room glows golden. In context, the beauty of the day is grotesque.
It was bold of her to mention Jones outright, but Draco thought it was rather smart. Claire had proved she could be gentle and appease a crowd; now she wanted to prove that she knew how to use it. It came across more authentic than anything else she had ever said.
Harry dropped the voice correcting charm as soon as they were out of hearing range, and Draco sighed in relief. The harsh American accent sounded wrong on Potter’s tongue.
Despite his flippancy, Draco would be lying if he said he wasn’t scared out of his mind. All was quiet for several minutes as Draco lost himself in his head.
feel good. Sometimes they even expect you to know without them doing so much as telling you (and punish you if you don't?). Don’t let some idiot ruin your self-confidence. From my experience, good sex is a matter of communication, consent, and learning what makes the other one feel good.
Anyhow, I like plying you with sweets. Besides, it’s easier for me to eat when I’m distracted. I’m still all sinew and nausea these days. (If I ever get better though, you ought to give me a guest pass for whichever gym you use. That place does wonders.)
Harry had broken Draco’s trust; he had blatantly disregarded the Statute of Secrecy, allowing his impulses to get the better of him and directly incite chaos. Draco did not need his husband to protect him.
“I have always been told that I am a natural leader,” he began, “and although I suppose this is true, I do not believe that the ability to lead is what makes a leader great, I believe it is the values that they adhere to. I did not come here to lie, to cheat, or to manipulate the people who trusted me, who called me their friend. Instead, I honored and reciprocated the respect I was shown.
“My rod-riding strategy is much more efficient than yours. You look like you forgot your pointe shoes. Remember, keep your weight over your box, Potter, else your metatarsals will sprain.”
When he swallowed, he didn’t stick out his tongue or bare his teeth with little bits of legs and skin stuck in them like everyone else tended to; he simply opened his jaw wide enough for Jeff to declare the round over. Winning was not a triumph; it was merely doing what needed to be done. He was already looking forward to returning to camp and casting a very thorough tooth-cleansing spell.
“We’ve got a great night planned for you, so stick around!” a dark haired, bespeckled man shouts from center stage. “I’m gonna let you in on a secret,” he continues. “I went to secondary school with one of the cast members here, and one of the skits you’ll see tonight-- and I’m not going to tell you which one-- might have some truth to it. Panic! at the Disco is here, everyone! I’m so thrilled to be hosting SNL, and we’ll be right back after the break!”
A first fat drop strikes Harry in the shoulder, and he eyes Malfoy quizzically. “The forecast was clear.”
In the bed closest to the house, Harry keeps his collection of magical plants. A couple of them are confined to magically sealed cages, lest they get up and walk away. When Draco chose a spot for his favourite hellebore, he made sure to plant it as far away as possible from the
I started taking the potions that I picked up from Okafor. I’ve felt a bit more faint and jittery than usual. Is that normal? I understand that the potion is supposed to work by blocking cortisol receptors in my brain, thus weakening the ion field that triggers my magical signature. Shouldn’t it be making me more subdued and tired, rather than restless and dizzy? Also, some of my addictive cravings are back for the first time since I kicked the habit. I have asked Molly to keep an extra eye on me, but if you say it’s going to be okay, I trust you.
They had stepped only yards into the cave when Harry’s skin began to glow golden in the heavy shade. “My magic--” he said, “--pulling out of me, then back in.” He struggled to continue, pupils hazy and then rolling back in his head.
He had learned that the magic inside was very different from that of the air around it, in both frequency and stability. While the air crackled with wild electricity, ready to latch onto whatever could channel it, the magic in the stones seemed to resonate with a quiet power, and, when Draco closed his eyes and focussed, it gave off a speckling of many different impressions, as if it held thousands of separate times and emotions and connotations. It felt at once ancient, wise, chaotic, and mysterious, but the only thing that Draco knew for sure was that he had gone into the right profession. It was fascinating.
“Glad we’re on the same page. I’m sorry you had to deal with that,” Lonnie said with a reassuring smile. Draco shrugged, leading the way back.
“WHY WOULD I KNOW,” Draco replied, wincing as his hearing began to return and his loud voice echoed harshly.
“Nge’k, getting your first look at the new Ngael tribe,” Jeff announced into the bare field of knee-high grass. The East Coasters gasped; even to an outsider, Doug had been the centerpiece of the West’s remarkably unremarkable tribe. “If anything has been made clear,” Jeff continued, “it is that players this season have brought their wits. Survivor is a social game, and the interactions between each of you are more volatile, more unpredictable, more subtle than they have ever been. The only way it could get more exciting is if every existing relationship was turned upside down. That’s right, contestants. Drop your Buffs.”
“You’re so graceful!” Harry huffs. “When I climb slab I feel like a fucking beached baluga whale. I don’t get it. This is supposed to be the hard part of climbing! You hardly ever even come to the gym!”
He waits until everyone else has boarded before he approaches the train. This time, there is no one to run away from. There’s no one to stay with either, besides a dank and clammy bench and the din of muggle Tube-goers through the walls.
They had taken the brazen strategy of putting the puzzle together on the ground before mounting it on the stand. Apparently, it had been a joint decision, but when the other team began to cheat off their exposed pieces, Doug refused to give it up. Iz urged him to let go and start over by pressing what they had finished into the display, but he grew frustrated, ignoring whatever she said to him as he continued to kneel on the ground. The tribe had less than half of their slightly-culturally-insensitive illustration of a tiki assembled when celebratory cheers signaled them to stop.
would reveal that he has cast the same spell on the same ruins-- on the same crumbling wall of the same crumbing castle-- a hundred times. He keeps forgetting what he’s already done, and it frustrates him to tears. The uselessness and the inaction pounds nails into the depths of his insecurity, and a part of him hopes it doesn’t get better, that the outside continues to reflect the in; that it’s what he deserves. In a moment of clarity, he wonders if a dementor kissed him in his sleep. Even that thought, though, floats into the hidden folds of his brain, until all he can remember of it is a looming shadow.
“So good.” Draco whispers. If his voice cracks, he doesn’t care. “So good for me. Look at you. God, look at you.” Harry’s incessant moans sharpen, the tips of his teeth brilliant against the pink of his lips, the gold of his skin. His hair has escaped it’s tie altogether, framing the sharp lines of his face in a messy, feathered halo.
“Fifth vote: Tara. Sixth vote: Isabelle. Will not count. That’s four, that’s enough. Tara, bring me your torch.
Ben came next. “Draco, I knew you for the shortest time of anyone here, but it feels like I did not know you at all. I do not think you once made an effort to talk to me. So, Draco, my question is, who are you?”
The next item was uncovered as well, and inspired an immediate and abrupt bidding war between Tara and Jessie. Only Tara would be stupid enough to spend all her money on the second platter, but for once Draco didn’t blame her. He would have traded his firstborn for that guacamole.
Harry guides Draco’s hands away from his face. “Draco?” he asked cautiously. “Are you okay? Are you hurt?”
Draco signed, heavy and solemn, leaning back in the sand with lead-filled limbs. “I know. She’s been talking about getting rid of you, too. She’s not wrong, but, well, extraneous circumstances.”
“Er, sorry,” Harry says, pushing back. He doesn't spare a second glance; his eyes are only on Draco, his mind only on the nearest empty room.
Nearly the entire camp was awake, but no one was saying anything. The space felt lethargic and dogmatic. Doug was chopping coconuts in the corner, his face blank as he focused on the rhythmic task. Lindsay and Tara huddled next to each other in the far back of the shelter, their hair framing their faces in an uncanny resemblance to wet spaniels. Ian, as well as a man who worked as a lawyer, appeared to be faking sleep, but the cadence of their breaths gave them away. Draco was sandwiched between Isabelle and Harry, and Harry shifted to wrap his arms around Draco’s shoulders. Ever since he was a child, he had been sensitive to cold, always complaining to his mother that the Manor was far too chilly. Harry, on the other hand, ran hot.
spiders. He would always call Draco into the bathroom to collect them from the shower, and Draco, cup and cardstock in hand, would find him naked and shivering in the corner muttering about ‘Hagrid’ and ‘Mosag’ and ‘that fucking Anglia.’
“I thought you didn’t want me around! I was giving you privacy to pretend we weren’t a couple! Like you said on the first morning!”
If you are still up for exploring Grimmauld Place tomorrow to see what we can scavenge of Sirius’s that might lend more information, I can meet you here whenever you get off work. I’ll try not to mention anything about ‘they were only in 3rd year’ or ‘so very illegal-- McGonagall must have known’. As much as I like hearing you talk, it distracts me.
“No, these are good ideas,” Isabelle said. Draco hated that he had forced her to work damage control. “Both Ian and I have experience in the water. We should dive, If that’s okay with everyone. Does anyone want to volunteer for other roles?”
He yanked twice at his lock, eyes squinted shut and puffy. A strangled sob intersected his gasping breaths and the stifling heat of the sun on his back felt like it was burying him alive. He was trapped, drifting; a vagrant in his own body.
“Have you ever had a summer where you just did anything you wanted? Have you ever just done anything you wanted?” Harry asks.
Draco asked Harry, Isabelle, Lindsay, Marissa, and Ian to meet him at the water well. He hoped they were ready for the speech he had prepared; Harry had been buttering them up for days, and Draco had been sure to give Marissa words of encouragement during the challenge, but he was still worried it would be too much too soon. The problem was that time was running short, and if Draco were to flip the alliances, he would have to do it soon.
Draco waits for the sun to break through the morning fog and for his nerves to settle, and then floos Harry’s office.
Draco woke up freezing cold. He shivered from head to toe, the sound of his teeth clacking together and the rain pinging off the tarp above his head blocking out all other noise. It was complete and utter misery. He was bundled in three layers of clothes, but they were all soaked, so he stripped them off one by one and crossed his arms over his chest to preserve body heat.
Beside him, Harry choked on a rolling wave on nausea, the sound making Draco cough and retch as well. “Ugh,” he said.
Harry leapt out of his seat and into Draco’s arms, kissing him full on the mouth on live public television. Draco kissed him back; half the cast had found out anyway. He checked his watch. In exactly 13 hours, he would be on stage with Hermione and Harry, presenting the greatest leap in magical theory since the 70’s.
He was a million dollars richer, surrounded by friends he adored, and beside the husband that he loved; his Survivor journey had wrapped with a very neat, very happy ending.
The route is physical; a series of powerful slaps up slopers involving a feet-above-the-head bat-hang and double-clutch dyno to the lip of the roof.
So, as they walked back into their own house, Draco turned to Harry with a worried expression. “Do you really think that Ichabod could have something to do with all of this?”
Marissa stood, her auburn curls bobbing where they weren’t plastered against her face with rain. “My question is for Harry,” she said. “Harry, you called yourself a leader, but I want to know specifically what moves you made that directly affected the outcome of the game. It is all well and good to have human values, but this is not the real world, this is Survivor. I am not granting you a peace prize, I am judging whether you have done what it takes to outplay everyone else in a game that is fundamentally removed from common social constructs.”
Harry gave him a gentle smile. “I’m okay. My magic isn’t burning me up inside anymore. But I’ll eat, for you, k?”
Draco closed his eyes, fighting waves of fear and guilt. “Is this too much for you? Do we need to go home? I’m so sorry. I should have known. And you were doing so well...”
Harry swallows. “It’s soothing here, grounding. The line between life and death is clean. They meet at a single step. My whole life, it’s been grey. Every day, every decision, I never knew. But right now, I’m choosing to survive.”
On the second try, though, he was successful, the ball dropping into a slot at the end of a steel ring as Harry gently tugged on the rope. Springing into action, the tribe gripped it, pulling on Harry’s command and dragging the rafts closer together. As they drifted towards collision, Harry leapt from one to the other, rocketing across a cylindrical spinning beam and skidding safely to the other side.
Still exhausted from the previous morning’s midnight escapade, Draco slept late. Well past breakfast, he was startled out of bone-deep sleep by the ruckus of shouting.
Which season of Survivor did I watch before writing this fic, and therefore has the most similarities to the events, characters, and challenges that I wrote?
Draco laughed. “Usually. It won’t be for Jessie. She betrayed every goddamn person on that panel, and she wasn’t even smart about it. If she had done it out of pure malicious genius, maybe, but she had no idea what was happening. Gotta have respect for trying, but she wouldn’t have my vote.”
Draco is covered in dirt and sweat from helping Neville move the lawn furniture onto the porch and mowing down the grass and weeds, an exhaustive process even with the aid of magic. Before anyone starts putting their hands on him, he needs a shower. “Maybe later. Did you need something else?”
So at Tribal Council Draco wrote down Harry’s name. “One last hurrah, Iz,” he told the camera, crossing his fingers and placing the card in the urn. He knew three of the votes inside bore her name.
“No, I suppose not,” Draco sighed. “Alright. Well, Ichabod, we won’t be too late home and we’ll bring you some food. Hopefully.”
Claire went next, and then Isabelle. The plan was simple; this part was not particularly interesting.
Harry knocked on Ron and Hermione’s door just before 10am. Hermione, like Draco, worked early, but Ron was on part time at the joke shop while the kids were still little. Little Rose greeted Harry at the door, followed shortly by Hugo on his stubby toddler legs. Teddy, dropped off by Andromeda an hour before, sat eating pancakes at the kitchen island, his legs kicking back and forth as they dangled off a bar chair. Ron was at the stove in an apron that read ‘Kiss the Cook’. Harry swiped a pancake off the growing stack, eating it with his bare hands before wiping up the syrupy mess on the countertop left behind by Rose and Hugo.
“Thank you Marissa,” Harry started, “The first major move I made was during the vote for Doug. I was the alliance member that approached Isabelle and Draco about voting him out, and I helped plan the talking points we brought to you, Ian, and Lindsay. Then, when Ben was voted off, I was the alliance member that talked to Jessie and convinced her to flip to our side. Also, I was a strong physical player, and my Reward and Immunity wins shaped the course of the game because they shifted which players spent time with each other and which players got votes.”
I know that last night was probably the best night of my life thus far, and that, if my life was paused, it has surely restarted. I know I’m fucking insatiable, and I want to do it again, right now, and I’ll do anyhting to make it good for you, too. I really, truly, didn’t think I’d ever be able to have sex again without hurting someone. I haven’t been able to lose control of myself for fear of catastrophe in so long that I became my own prisoner. A paradox, I suppose. I lost myself in being unable to lose myself. The protective spells and the shattered windows were annoying, but fuck,
Draco’s lithe frame weaves in and out of the shadows as he arranges himself between the other members of his dance troupe, and Harry stands-- usually, he is satisfied with filling in the blanks with his imagination. This is not one of those times. He wants every detail.
“How does it feel to be on top of the world?” she asked. “Sitting comfortably upon your throne as the peasants come to beg and grovel.”
I don’t know if I love you. I don’t think I know anything at all. Sometimes, I think my time in the human experience was put on hiatus 4 years ago-- or perhaps even long before that. Every thought and emotion that has crossed my mind since has felt like an illusion. I am terrified of my feelings for you being nothing more than a mirage; a selfish hallucination fabricated to balm my suffering. I don’t trust myself to say anything, even if I mean it, because how could meaning mean anything to me, when I am what I am?
The second man simpered with calculated disdain. Draco recognized him as the bloke who had wrestled him for the shelter tarp at the starting Reward Challenge. If that wasn’t dislikable enough, everyone on the island had heard the shouted obscenities and flippant insults he threw at opponents and teammates alike during competitions. Majority alliance or no, Draco had the sinking suspicion that a new big dog was in the house.
Pushing Malfoy against the banister of the highest moving staircase in the castle feels like the most natural thing in the world. Kissing him feels like something he’s done before. The 7th floor corridor falls away beneath them. The 8th is miles up in the sky. Malfoy tastes like green ginger. The magic in the air smells a bit like champagne. Hogwarts always did have a sense of humour.
Iz smiled innocently. “Perhaps,” she said with a friendly chime. “But perhaps only partially.” Jones stalked away in a huff.
It turned out everyone wanted to vote out Ed, so there was little scrambling in the hours before Tribal Council. The git was clueless, so all it took was a brief meeting of Draco and Isabelle with Ian, Harry, and Doug for things to be agreed upon. Somehow, though, the moment they stepped into the thatched hut and lit the torches that represented their life, everything devolved right back into chaos.
“Fuck,” Harry swears, “that came out wrong. I wasn’t expecting it. I was joking earlier. Draco, are you serious?”
“Er, thanks, Hagrid…” Harry said as a smallish glass tank was pushed into his hands. Peering inside, he scrunched his nose up as he tried to work out what he was looking at.
anything. I want a snapshot in a dreamscape, where you can’t quite tell if you’re seeing things a second too soon or a lag behind. I don’t want good or bad or past or future or fucking rationality. I want right now. I want right now to not be as horrible as everything else." Harry’s voice cracks between his words, and his syntax distorts. Tears on his face are commas, punctuating all the wrong pauses. Splotches on his cheeks fill the gaps between sentences, tethering them to each other, taking Harry with them as they fall. Malfoy wraps him in a hug.
Draco studied the gears. There were five different types of parts: large gears, medium gears, small gears, spacers, and shafts that could be secured to the wall and slid into the centre-holes of the other pieces. If he placed a large gear and a small gear on each shaft and then lined them up with the first small gear connecting to the handle and the first large gear connecting to the second small gear, he would maximize the ratio of handle turns to pulley movement.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t think so. He’s been very comfortable in here. I don’t think it’s a very active species, so if we make this bigger and give him some enrichment, he’ll be fine.”
In a rush of pearly steam, the carriage takes off into the darkness, smooth and steadily accelerating. Just when they can no longer make out each other’s faces, the world explodes into color.
“I know,” Draco said, walking away. “The git’s barmy anyway. Got a screw or two loose. The way he reacted isn’t on you. I’m just sensitive to that stuff: the screaming and the night terrors.”
Draco pulled out his fingers and started to fuck Harry with his tongue instead, tasting his own come. Harry started to stroke himself, but the angle seemed all wrong for him, so Draco batted his hand away and did it for him. He couldn’t help his own moans spilling out of him as he tried to make it as good for Harry as possible. He pushed one finger in again, searching for Harry’s prostate, and when he found it, he started to put more pressure to it, making Harry shake.
Narcissa looked at him with a disapproving look. “Don’t talk about your father like that,” she scolded, “and language, Draco. I will not have my grandson use those foul words.”
They sat in silence for a while. When Draco had seen Harry stifle yet another yawn, he took that as a cue. ”I’m going to call it a night.” Draco stood up and started to walk out of the room.
He accepted the cup from Harry when he was done, and he was staring at it before he raised his eyes to look at Harry instead. “I’m sorry for yelling at you. I’m sorry for pushing you away.”
“It’s Mr Finley’s time off, I had to. Besides, I got to spend Christmas eve at home so I don’t mind working a couple of days before the new year.” Draco kissed her cheek in return. “And although late, I get to spend some time with you now as well,” he said, while taking off his coat and placing it on the hanger behind the door.
Malfoy startled and his head shot up, making his glasses fall on the table. With a confused expression he locked eyes with Harry.
Draco shook his head. “No, you don’t.” He wasn’t in the mood for celebrating losing his job. Maybe he shouldn’t have said anything, but if the Aurors were closing in on Mr Finley it was only a matter of time before he lost his job anyway.
“Okay, if you say so. I still want to buy you a pint, we haven’t had the chance to talk much outside of this place,” he said, gesturing around the shop. “Tell you what. Rose is spending time with Andromeda tomorrow night, she’s jealous of Teddy that he gets to have such a cool grandmother. I love my mom but she can be a bit overbearing, you know?” Ron rambled. “Maybe Scorpius can join them for a sleepover and we can get together?”
They’d been sitting in the joint kitchen at Janus Thickey, his mother nursing a cup of tea which Draco kept reheating, when she looked him straight in the eye.
Harry took a deep breath, and placed one of his hands over Draco’s, taking a long sip of his drink before putting it down on the table with the other glass. He leaned closer to Draco, and the soft spoken words into his ear made goosebumps appear all over his body.
The day passed surprisingly fast and smooth, and it was almost midnight when they returned to their hotel.
“Mr Malfoy! There’s no need for you to be rude,” the receptionist, Moira, said. “As I told you over the Floo, there are no available appointments in the near future.”
He was trying to channel some of her confidence when he stood outside Harry’s place, but the nerves made his smile falter and his heart was performing somersaults in his chest. When Harry finally opened the door and greeted him with an easy smile, Draco let out a deep breath before stepping into the flat. Harry took his coat and gave him a quick kiss before ushering  him into the kitchen. Draco sat by the kitchen island and watched as Harry finished making their meal. Harry seemed at ease while he was cooking and he had a grace that Draco hadn’t been aware of before, making it hard for Draco to keep his hands to himself. Harry seemed to struggle even more because he kept giving Draco lingering touches every time he went by him to get everything in order.
Draco flipped through the pages again, searching for a date on the last entry. He raised the book, showing it to his father. “This,” he said. “Mother usually keeps it with her.” He waved the book a little, putting his finger on the last scribbled page and closed the book over it.
He closed the door and opened the journal again, his finger brushing over the date that stated that the last entry was three months ago.
“What?” Harry asked, confused. He was ready to go home, so whatever Ron had planned would have to happen another day.
Draco scoffed to himself. They had come a long way since the war, especially since Pansy prioritized Gryffindors over him. But he loved her, so he could endure one night at this shitty establishment, watching the group from where he sat alone at the bar. He knew he was only accepted to join by the grace of Pansy, and he had no interest in making conversation with people who loathed him. He suspected the feeling was mutual, for most of them.
Harry chuckled, and then dropped his head down on the desk with a moan when Draco pressed two fingers in, pushing as much come back inside him as he could. He wished he was younger, so he could go again immediately, but for now this was enough, hearing Harry’s moans and watching his fingers disappearing over and over again.
“I am no such thing, just very interested in cocks.” Draco broke down in a fit of laughter, making the other passengers look over at them, wondering what the fuss was all about.
Draco felt like he took a punch to his gut. His initial response was to lash out and be mad about Potter’s comment, but time had taught him that swallowing his anger and trying to stay in control would benefit him in the long run, so instead, he took a deep breath and thought about Potter’s words before he answered.
“You always say I should ask before hugging someone. And Harry looks a bit sad, so I want to hug him.” He looked up at Draco with his big eyes.
Draco winced. “No, they’re all elsewhere. I’m sure you already knew that, dear aunt?” He glared at her, knowing that she was hinting at something he didn’t want to acknowledge. “We’ll be having dinner with my parents.”
Draco looked down, but he felt kind of grateful that Harry didn’t offer any more consolation than that, he was probably not in the right headspace to accept it anyway.
“I thought so too,” Draco admitted, clearly too drunk to keep his words inside. “I never thought he could forgive me, but perhaps acknowledge that I have changed, you know? I’m just trying to give him space so I don’t bother him.” He did a dismissive gesture with his hand. “It’s foolish. I’m foolish.” He shook his head, making the room spin around him. “Hm, I clearly had too much to drink. Don’t mind my rambling Weasley.”
Later, just when Draco was about to go to bed, his fireplace roared to life. A giggling Pansy showed her face, looking a bit tipsy.
Draco was too upset to answer so he had shoved Potter away, leaving him without a word. He didn’t even bother to apologise for the chair he knocked over in the process.
they had apparated straight to Mrs Lindon’s garden, to get her kneazle out of a tree. She’d claimed it was an emergency, like she always did, but they should’ve known better by now. The file reports concerning Mrs Lindon were as high as all their other cases piled together. He and Malfoy were literally drowning in paperwork that needed to be done as soon as possible, otherwise one or several cases would be taken from them, which both of them were too stubborn to let happen. That’s why they were still stuck at work, writing one report after another.
They had just spent another dinner his mother hadn't attended when Draco asked one of the elves to take a plate up to her room. The elf started to fiddle and look everywhere else than on Draco.
“You’re so fucking gorgeous, Harry.” He licked down his perineum and back up again. I could do this forev…” he swallowed his last word. “For hours. I could do this for hours.”
Hazy flashbacks told Harry that he’d made an utter fool of himself yesterday, and he could feel his panic rising.
“–and we’ll make sure that you can stay at home as long as possible before it will be too hard to manage,” Potter finished.
Harry was already back when Draco arrived at the hotel. All his stuff was packed and he sat on the sofa, staring into space. Draco didn’t know what to say so he only nodded at Harry and went and gathered his things. When he was done, he sat down on the bed and cleared his throat. “Portkey leaves in five minutes.”
Then it was as if nothing had happened. She didn’t speak after that, not acknowledging Draco’s presence, even when he left her with a kiss on her cheek. Every time he left he wished he didn’t have to come back, and he hated himself for it but couldn’t help it. That’s why he was sitting alone in the cafeteria, trying to gather his thoughts before going home.
“Yes, that would be good, thank you. I don’t want to leave him alone with mother for too long, not when I don’t know what this is.” Draco raked his hand through his hair. “Maybe I can get one of the elves to look after him?”
The worst thing was that his father had a point. He hadn’t noticed, but that didn’t mean it didn’t matter. “No! You have no right to do this without consulting me. You’ve fought her in every way possible since we came from the healer. You’ve done everything opposite from what they’ve told us. You haven’t helped her at all,” Draco said, knuckles whitening from how hard he was grasping his chair in front of him.
Harry ran his hands over Draco’s back, then he spread his cheeks slightly. “You have no idea how hot you look like this.” His thumb traced around Draco’s rim while Draco kept on fucking backwards. “You feel fucking amazing.” He stopped petting Draco’s arsehole and instead he clasped a hand around Draco’s cock, which was slippery from all the precome he leaked onto the mattress. Harry started to stroke him with a firm grip, trying to keep up with Draco’s pace. “Come, Draco,” Harry begged with a hard thrust. “I want to feel you come, your tight hole clenching around me.”
“No you’re not, I think you’re amazing,” Harry answered, slowly bringing Draco’s hand towards his lips and kissing his knuckles gently.
Draco kept fucking Harry with his thumb, going as slowly as possible. He didn’t know if he’d ever get the opportunity to do this again, so he was going to savour it. Taking as much time as Harry would let him, making it memorable.
“Harry, what are you doing up? Why aren’t you wearing any clothes?” Hermione whispered to him, glancing at Malfoys sleeping body.
Draco snorted, but Kristoff looked murderous, and he was only inches away from Draco’s face now. He was about to speak again when Ron took a grip on his collar and dragged him backwards.
Harry looked serious again. “I couldn’t help myself. I’ve been meaning to ask you out for a long time.”
“Ah! He’s awake again. We got your test results back, Mr. Malfoy. You suffer from a slight memory loss— ”
He looked through the book carefully, not wanting to damage it. The hero had similarities to Potter he couldn’t help but snort at, but overall the book was incredible.
Something ached in Draco’s chest when he looked down, and shook his head again. He didn’t dare to look up as Harry exited the room. When he heard the door close, he fell back onto the bed and closed his eyes.
“What? Isn’t that a good enough answer for you?” Draco didn’t know why he was responding with so much hostility, but his own lingering feelings of being useless triggered something in him.
Harry dragged Seamus in for a hug, and shouted into his ear. “Mate, I’m going to talk to Malfoy. Tell him how much I like him. Like work. No, like working him. With him?”
“I’m afraid you have rely on other people to fill in the blanks for you. What is the last thing you remember?” healer Biddle asked.
Draco stepped into the living room, only to be assaulted by the image of Potter sitting on the sofa with Teddy and Scorpius on each side, reading a book filled with special effects coming out of it. He was dressed in a very soft-looking sweater, a knitted one in a gorgeous shade of green with a golden H on the chest, clingy in all the right places. His hair was rumpled as always, and it almost fell into his eyes and he had a large smile on his face as tiny fireworks came out of the book. He looked up when Draco entered and his smile didn’t falter when they locked eyes with each other. Draco could feel some of his nerves slipping away, but he still knew he had to apologize for storming out of his office. Draco didn’t manage to answer his smile with one of his own, and he broke eye contact when he could feel the room becoming too hot. He cleared his throat and when Scorpius noticed him he jumped up and wrapped himself around Draco.
Draco was standing at the bar, nursing a vodka on the rocks. It tasted awful, but he thought it somehow made him look a little more sophisticated. Not that he needed that, mind! He looked down on himself, fiddling a little with the hem of his robe.
“Get what?” Harry was feeling a little bit woozy, Seamus’ face refused to stay still long enough for Harry to focus on it.
Scorpius looked between them both, clearly uncomfortable about what was happening at the table. Draco put an arm around him. “Go to your room, darling, so I can speak with your grandfather.” He kissed him on the head and Scorpius scurried away.
He covered Draco with all of his body, leaving kisses all over his face where he could reach. “That was…” He shook himself, rolling off Draco, gathering him in his arms.
He kissed Harry and dragged one hand down his torso. When he reached the waistband he popped the button open in Harry’s jeans and spun him around. He slowly pulled the jeans down along with Harry’s pants, then put his hand between Harry’s shoulder blades and carefully pressed him down the table. Harry grabbed the end of his desk with both of his hand’s and murmured something Draco couldn’t hear. But when he looked down on the sight in front of him, and grabbed both of Harry’s arse cheeks to part them a little, he could see Harry’s hole glistening, and the faint smell of a cleaning charm lingered in the air.
“One would think you’ve forgotten that you are, in fact, a wizard?” Draco took a sip of his drink and stood up. “I’m going to give my best wishes to Pansy. Have a nice evening, Potter.” He started to walk away from the bar when Potter’s arm shot out and grabbed Draco by the elbow.
As he went to the bar he couldn’t help to dance along to the music, swaying with every step. He knew he had the goofiest smile on his face but he was too happy to be self conscious about it. Sometimes it was just nice to let go a little.
“Yes, I did,” Harry said taking another step forward. When Draco didn’t move away, he lifted his hand and tucked a lock of his hair behind his ear. Draco leaned into the touch and put his hand over Harry’s, intertwining their fingers.
“What fairies? We don’t have any fairies in the garden,” Draco said, gently stroking Scorpius' hair.
Malfoy leaned back to avoid Harry’s wandering fingers. “So that was what you were trying to say.” Malfoy shook his head. “The answer is no, Potter. You can’t borrow my notes.”
Draco watched as Potter scooped up ice cubes from his water and squeezed them in his hand, and then dragged them over his forehead, water seeping between his fingers. He stopped and then looked at Draco’s raised eyebrows.
“Nonsense, Draco. That can wait. Off you go, now!” Shacklebolt put on his travelling cloak and left the room.
Draco snorted and then he didn’t even waste a second before he was nuzzling Potter’s neck, breathing in his scent and then started to kiss his way across Potter’s jaw to his mouth. Draco could feel the intake of breath before their mouths met in a soft kiss. It was nothing like Draco had anticipated. He’d never let himself think about how it would be to kiss Harry Potter, the knowledge that it would never happen was too hard to bear, so all of his fantasies had been vague, with a poor excuse that the black haired man he’d imagined was someone else.
When they closed the door behind them, Draco turned towards Potter, not bothering sitting down. He knew what he wanted to say so it was best to just get it over with.
They landed in an alley, veiled by magic. After they’d transfigured their robes to Muggle clothes, they stepped out to a large boulevard.
Draco took a sip of his drink before he answered. “No, I’ve been busy at work.” He snorted. “I guess that won’t be a problem anymore.”
Draco looked at some pages, inspirational quotes staring back at him. Offering him nothing other than irritation. He raised his brows in disbelief at Potter, who only shrugged sheepishly in return.
Malfoy let out a big sigh. He put his hand in Harry’s hair, and carded through it a couple of times. Then he took a firm grip and shook Harry’s head gently. “You’re awfully adorable when you’re intoxicated, Harry. We’ll talk tomorrow, okay?” He rose from his chair but then leaned down and kissed Harry on the cheek.
Malfoy shook his head violently. “I did no such thing. I was merely resting my eyes to escape the horror of Mrs Lindon.” He took his glasses and folded them neatly into his breast pocket.
“It’s a book with inspiring quotes and thoughts about the human mind,” Potter said, cheeks reddening a little.
After a couple of minutes he could breathe normally again, and he even managed to sit up, glancing over at Malfoy, who was looking at him with an amused smile.
Harry didn’t know when his blood started boiling with something else rather than anger when faced with Malfoy. He hadn’t been surprised to find out that Malfoy was also going back to Hogwarts for their eighth year. During the trials Malfoy had pleaded to the jury that he wanted to take his N.E.W.T.s so he could train to become a healer, to somehow repair the damage he’d done in the war. That, and Harry testifying on both his and his mother’s behalf, made the Wizengamot decide that Malfoy was free of his charges, but would be put to house arrest with his parents if he failed his courses. So, when Harry caught a glimpse of blond hair in one of the train compartments, he couldn’t help but feel relieved. Harry had almost tried being the same prat towards Malfoy that he’d always been the first couple of days, but when Malfoy wouldn’t even look at him, he found it quite ridiculous to keep up the charade. Instead, the very first time he did catch Malfoy looking at him he just nodded in acknowledgment and was rewarded with a pair of raised eyebrows and a tentative nod back.
Draco tucked himself back in and glanced over at Harry, who had turned around and looked at him with a small smile on his face. “So? Shall we?” He held out his hand to Draco.
She had stopped thrashing in his arms, so he let go slowly, but kept a firm grip on her arm so she couldn’t run away.
Potter shivered and swallowed, and then he said with a smirk “that I, indeed, am a very fine lover.”
Harry dragged himself out of bed, threw on some pyjama bottoms and went into the common room. Harry was totally set on finding Malfoy’s sleeping form on the couch, so when he saw Malfoy sitting up staring right at him, he stopped dead in his tracks. Malfoy didn’t say anything, just looked at Harry with weary eyes.
The summer went by and before he knew it it was already September. The beginning of fall was always a busy period at Draco’s workplace. They usually got loads of shipping coming in from different places all over the world, half of it Draco wasn’t even permitted to open. Draco’s job was to manage the storefront and the register, and his boss, Mr Finley, took care of everything behind the scenes. Draco wasn’t allowed to go in the back, which he was kind of grateful for, the less he knew the better. It made his job easier every time the Aurors decided to make a surprise visit, which they did fairly often in the fall.
“I’m not being a prat your obnoxious git! How is it that you manage to save the whole fucking world but not manage to avoid trying to off yourself every night?” Malfoy wheezed out through gritted teeth.
It’s a funny saying, that ignoring a problem won’t make it go away, Draco’s pretty sure that it isn’t inaccurate. He tried to keep a closer eye on his mother in the weeks that followed his talk with his father, but between work and taking care of Scorpius, things weren’t so different. To contact St Mungo’s seemed silly when Draco couldn’t pinpoint exactly what was wrong, so once again, he pushed that thought far away in the back of his mind.
“Listen Malfoy, I’m sorry,” Potter blurted out. “I didn’t mean it like that. It was insensitive of me.”
Great, more work, Draco thought. He would be late for the ball tonight if he was supposed to be done with two reports and shop for new robes. God forbid he’d wear something he’d worn before.
Draco tried to swallow past the guilt he could feel forming a lump in his throat, not knowing what to say to defend himself. “I’ll talk to Mr Finley and see if I can get more time off.”
then,” Harry said, emphasizing the word friend with raised eyebrows at Draco, which Draco ignored. “How do we chose where we’re going?”
Moira recoiled like she was slapped. “We do not take kindly to your kind in this hospital. If you don’t leave immediately, I will call security.”
Draco did everything to make his mother’s days as pleasant as possible. It had been a month since he stormed out of Harry's place, and after ignoring Harry’s owls and Andromeda’s pleading eyes he hadn't heard from him in a couple of weeks. He had started on several letters, each of them trying to ask for forgiveness, offering an explanation, but nothing he wrote made any sense so he’d burned them all. He was ashamed and sad, catching himself thinking about Harry several times a day, getting lost in his own thoughts, but as the days passed his mother required more and more care.
A while later, Harry felt the plane starting to shake, and the “fasten seatbelt” sign was turned on. Harry gently nudged Draco in the side. “Bert, wake up! Put your seatbelt on.”
“Flattery will get you nowhere.” Narcissa shook her head, but Draco could see that the corners of her mouth twitched a little. “Your father and I are going out for a walk in the garden. Scorpius was welcome to come along, but he said he would rather be with you.”
Draco greeted his mother when she came home the next day, and while she drank tea with Scorpius in the parlour, Draco arranged for every one of her belongings to be moved from his parents' chambers into the bedroom beside his.
“There will be no bones jumping today, Weasley. I wanted him to figure it out for himself. I’ll make sure he gets home, let him sleep this off.”
His mother hummed in response but didn’t offer anything more than that. Draco went up to her and placed his arms around her, hugging her tight from behind. His mother seemed so fragile in his arms, her bones poking through the delicate fabric of her dress, her now thin body trembling in Draco’s arms. He couldn’t help but let out a sob as he put his head down on top of hers. “I’m sorry, mother” he cried, tears wetting her hair. “I’m so, so sorry.” He hugged her tighter, Narcissa’s hand stroking Draco’s own where it was placed over her stomach. “I miss you. I miss you so much.”
”You threw your shirt at me,” Harry said, holding up his hands in a gesture of shielding himself, like Draco would punch him. Which Draco did, hard on Harry’s forearm.
Lifting his head was a hard task, but Draco tried while still keeping his eyes closed. He could feel someone clasping his face, and once again someone kept talking to him. “Draco, look at me. Where’s Scorpius?”
Something ached inside of Draco’s chest. Scorpius didn’t have that many adults in his life who showed him affection. There was Draco and Andromeda of course, and sometimes even his mother would give Scorpius a kiss on the top of his head, but his father wasn’t, and never had been, big on affection, and since they had no contact with Astoria’s parents, the loss of their daughter being too hard for them, there weren’t any more adults that could show Scorpius some love. Draco had to turn away before the sight in front of him made him all sappy. It was his birthday, for Merlin’s sake.
Walking up the path to the Manor, he ignored the lilies and their distinct smell, only reminding him of an evening he wanted to forget. When he got nearer he could hear voices coming from the garden, and he could see the silhouettes of two people, one of them smaller and should be in bed by now.
Draco took out the letter and placed it in Harry’s hand. Harry tangled their fingers together and then they were off.
The first year after they moved in was the hardest. Trying to be there for your child who was suffering, and at the same time working to become a potions master was not something Draco could handle. He quit his apprenticeship to stay at home with Scorpius, burning all of his chances at a successful career. But now, three years later, he doesn't have any regrets. Sure, his job as a shop clerk in a somewhat shady store in Knockturn alley left much to desire, but he was at least moderately happy, and he was there for his son more often than not. That had to count for something.
Draco was sitting on his bed, it was in the middle of the night and he had heard his mother’s door open and close as usual before her steps vanished further and further away. Scorpius was sleeping under the covers, and his calm breaths were usually enough to guide Draco to sleep, but not tonight. He was fiddling with one of Harry’s letters that he’d kept, locked in one of his drawers. His fingers traced the words at the bottom of the page,
“This again!” Draco shook his head. “Blood has nothing to do with family Potter, surely you must know that since you are a Weasley and all.”
“Oh, just Malfoy having a bad dream I think,” Harry whispered back, thanking his lucky star Malfoy was asleep so he could blame him and not tell Hermione of his sleepwalking tendencies.
“Mr. Potter is listed as your emergency contact.” The healer said, now looking at Draco with a curious expression. “Are you quite alright, Mr. Malfoy?”
“I would like to ask you to not let your feelings towards me interfere with the treatment of my mother.”
Harry sat down and took one of the cups, bringing it to his mouth. He took a sip before he answered. “Both?”
“Good. I mean okay, that’s alright.” Potter was fidgeting with his hands before he struck one out towards Draco. “I’ll see you in a couple of days then?” His hand hovering, waiting for a handshake.
Draco sighed, and folded the letter. He knew he was being a git, he just didn’t know how to act otherwise. The last thing he wanted to do was to hurt Harry, but he didn’t know if their friendship would survive it if he told Harry how he felt. But if he kept this up, there wouldn’t even be a friendship to begin with and that was worse.
“Well what?” Harry said, raising his voice a bit, making Malfoy stir. Hermione glanced at Malfoy, furrowing her brows and asked in a lower voice;
Draco was sitting in a wobbly plastic chair in the cafeteria in St Mungo’s. He was stirring sugar in his tea only to have something to do with his fiddling hands. One of his colleagues from the potion apprenticeship program passed by him, only giving him a nod as a greeting. They knew better than to disturb Draco on days like these.
“You done, Harry? They’re waiting down at the Leaky.” He turned towards Malfoy. “You too, ferret face.”
“Go check around the store Jon.” He gently shoved him in another direction before he turned towards Draco again. “Is Finley in this time?”
“No. No, you never mentioned it.” Draco felt a little stupid that he didn’t know that Ron was a father.
“What do you mean there are no available appointments?” Draco was kneeling by the fireplace at Andromeda’s, talking to a receptionist at St Mungo’s.
“A shower? And then food,” Harry answered, and stepped away from Draco to pull up his pants and trousers. Then he picked up his t-shirt from the floor and put it on before he headed to the door.
your back,” Harry muttered petulantly, glancing over to Hermione, who still was standing breathing a little faster after being startled by Malfoy. “What were you doing up anyway?” Harry asked her.
Draco had changed his shirt three times before deciding what to wear for his date with Harry. It was times like these when he wished he had someone close to him to ask for advice. Astoria would’ve helped Draco pick out a good outfit and then told him to grow a pair before shoving him out the door.
This night he was drinking firewhiskey, but only because the bartender had looked at him funny when he asked for his classic vodka. He didn’t like the Leaky and most of the time he declined every invite from Pansy to meet up here. But, tonight was Pansy’s birthday and she wanted to celebrate somewhere, where her Gryffindor friends were more comfortable.
Draco had made an attempt to apologize at the start of their eighth year, but Potter had only nodded and then they hadn’t spoken for the rest of the term. It’d bothered Draco at the time, he wanted to feel that he’d made amends, but now, looking back, he couldn’t blame Potter for being cold and distant. From what Draco had seen, Potter had spent his last term being plastered to the Weasley girl, looking more and more contented the closer to summer they’d got. It had been a good look on him: being happy.
“I’m not sloshed, Draco. I’m a tiny bit tipsy. Point stands. You have beautiful eyes.” Harry tried to poke Malfoy’s eyes to see if they felt equally pretty.
When all the presents had been opened and Draco retreated to the kitchen to pour himself some more eggnog, Harry followed suit and stood beside him with only an inch to spare between them. His warm hand brushed against Draco’s when they both reached for the pitcher and Draco murmured a low apology. He looked at Harry while he topped off their drinks and his warm smile made Draco’s stomach swoop. One step closer and he would be pressed up against Harry’s whole body, one small tilt of his head and he would be inches away from his lips. He tried his hardest not to stare at Harry’s mouth, but when Harry’s tongue licked off a lingering drop of eggnog he couldn’t help but follow the motion like a man possessed. Draco could almost feel his heart in his throat as Harry opened his mouth to say something, when they were interrupted by Scorpius coming up behind him, hugging Draco and saying he wanted to go home. He gave Harry an apologetic smile but was almost relieved that Scorpius had broken up their close encounter. He was far too close to lean up against Potter and reveal something he wanted to keep hidden.
He couldn’t find her on their floor, and he grew more anxious when he couldn’t find her down in the parlour either. He went to his parent’s bedroom, gently knocking before he entered. Lucius stood at one of the windows, looking out into the garden. He cast a glance at Draco when he came up beside him, but looked back down again. Draco could see his mother walking around outside, and even though the nights were fairly warm in the beginning of summer, she wasn’t wearing enough clothes, and she was heading towards the pond.
Harry turned and looked at him. “Draco I’m sorry. I really thought we would have fun. I’m sorry that I ruined our vacation.
Potter was standing in a corner, leaned against the wall, staring at him with eyes wide open. Draco stared at him in return, not knowing how he could save this situation.
Malfoy strode off not even giving Harry a chance to beg for more advice. Maybe it was for the best, Harry still felt a bit flustered from all the images dancing before his eyes, imagining himself being tied up and left at Malfoy’s mercy. Well, at least Harry had something to do instead of going to sleep he thought, while trying to walk somewhat normal with his erection straining against his trousers, back to his room.
Harry stumbled towards the table where Malfoy and Pansy was sitting, and he flopped down into an empty chair. He put his hand over Malfoy’s on the table, and cleared his throat. Malfoy raised his eyebrows and looked down at their joined hands.
Harry could feel his lip starting to pout. “You’re no fun,” he muttered. He took his newly ordered beer and drank half of it in one long gulp, and then put the pint glass down on the bar. Only that he miscalculated where the bar actually was, so the glass ended up on the floor, beer splashing everywhere. Hermione and Pansy left out a little screech, while Malfoy pinched the bridge of his nose, shaking his head.
Draco took his tea in silence. He had a hard time not looking at Potter who was seated right in front of him as he laughed and talked to Scorpius. His comment had really disturbed Draco. He thought that they had a mutual understanding of some sort. They didn’t like each other, sure, but to realise that Potter still thought of him as some bigot really hurt. He had done everything to change himself to be a better person after the war, after starting his family, but maybe that wasn’t enough. Even if he knew that the public’s opinion of him didn’t matter in the long run, that the most important part was that he
Draco’s first instinct was to say no, but something in Ron’s open expression made him hesitate. He was one of the few people that had treated Draco nicely after the war, and nothing about him gave any indication that he asked only to be polite. Since they made a truce they’ve always been honest with each other, as far as Draco knew. Also, Draco was fairly sure that he actually would find it quite pleasant to have an evening out. So instead of declining, he answered with a nod.
In the first year or so, Draco had been furious about not getting his own office. He’d left Gringotts to come and work for the Ministry, and with that he’d left behind a big office and his own assistants. But after a while he’d felt that his place outside the Minister's office wasn’t too bad after all. He wasn’t hidden away in a corner somewhere. Everyone could see that it was Draco Malfoy who was trusted with the Ministry’s money, and that pleased Draco immensely. And most of the day he didn’t even mind Dora gossiping, about everything and everybody. She always revealed something scandalous that he could tell Pansy later over drinks. But, some things she said about Potter rubbed him the wrong way.
“No. They’ve taken my mother and she should be at home.” He went to the other door and started knocking on that one instead.
“I’m selfish, Potter, please let me indulge a little.” He pulled his thumb out, then switched and pushed two fingers inside instead.
“I’m sorry I didn’t say anything sooner, but to be fair, neither did you,” Harry countered. “But I would like to get to know you more. I would love to spend more time with you and Scorpius. If you want to?” He looked nervously back at Draco.
“No!” Harry said with a sigh. Really, this was proving to be the longest flight in history, and it was all Harry’s fault. Draco had insisted they take a portkey, but when Harry had found out that Draco had never been on a plane before, he’d felt he wanted to be with him the first time he flew. Of course he hadn’t said that to Draco, instead he’d made it into a bet, saying Draco was too scared to fly the Muggle way, and Draco wasn’t one to turn down a challenge. Apparently, just when Harry thought Draco couldn’t be more obnoxious, he was proven wrong.
Harry went slowly, taking his time, as Draco’s body accepted more fingers in him. Harry’s thick digits started twisting and crooking inside him, Draco let out a half sob when Harry found that special spot and kept prodding at it.
“Shh! Sir, keep your voice down. We will not crash, it’s just a bit of turbulence. Now, please sit down here with your partner and fasten your seatbelt.” She gently, but firmly, steered Draco back to his seat beside Harry.
“Yes, you are. I think you’ve had enough now, Harry. You should go home and sleep it off. I’ll go find someone who can help you get home safely.” Ron winked, and then stumbled away, leaving Harry feeling very confused.
Get a grip Harry, he thought while rising to his feet, you just tried to off yourself in your sleep but are somehow still alive and pining after Malfoy.
“I’m meeting Ron for a pint tonight. He was wondering if you would like to join us?” Potter said more to the ground than to Draco.
After he heard the water turn off, and the door shut, he waited a couple of seconds before standing on wobbly legs. He opened the stall door, eyes kept on the ground, and headed towards the sink to splash his face before going out again.
“That you fancy Malfoy.” Seamus laughed. “Go get him, tiger. Rawr.” Seamus did a funny thing with his hand, like a claw slashing through the air.
Draco couldn’t breathe properly, he wanted to get out of there before he did anything stupid, so he headed towards the Floo.
Draco could hear a second pair of footsteps following behind, the door closing again. He sat down gingerly, not wanting to be caught hiding in a toilet stall.
“And then what? I send my mother away like the failure I am?” Draco asked, his voice rising. “Then I’ll go and get myself a fancy little job, right? Because after working with a fucking drug dealer for years the job offerings are piling around me.”
“That’s your drink, right?” Potter nodded to it. “I thought you might need one after your Mr Rebane encounter. We’ve all been there. He is a bit slow on the uptake.”
Harry laughed. “Your snoring said otherwise.” He ignored Malfoy’s spluttering protest and continued on. “Anyway, I was thinking of heading home. I finished the case files for today, except for the rest of Mrs Lindons reports which I’ll leave for tomorrow. Robards can take all of my cases, I don’t fucking care anymore. I’d rather take an unforgivable curse than continue to work on this.”
“It’s not a regular thing, and what were you doing awake at that hour, again I might add?” He looked at Hermione squirming a bit in her seat.
Ron dragged Draco towards him in a clumsy hug that Draco tried to return, but his thoughts were stuck on the words
Harry was vaguely aware that people were talking around him. But he couldn't quite lift his head from the table. He tried to tell them that he was fine sleeping here, but he couldn’t even manage to get any words out.
“No! No, I didn’t mean it like that.” Harry shook his head. “I’m glad that you’re friends. It’s good.” He looked embarrassed. “Ron talks a lot while he’s drunk, I’m sure you noticed.”
They had been in St Mungo’s for over three hours now. Potter had run several diagnostics spells, making Narcissa do different tests that Draco couldn’t grasp the meaning of. What the point was to draw a clock with the minute hands showing different times, Draco couldn’t fathom, but he could feel his gut clench with worry when his mother couldn’t draw what Potter and the nurses told her to. After the tests were done, Potter talked with Narcissa alone, then he talked to Draco and he tried to explain everything that he had noticed being off with his mother. They were all exhausted by the time Potter called all three of them back in.
Harry looked up at him, looking as scared as Draco felt. He nodded, stood up, and reached for Draco, his hand stopping mid air. “Can I… Can I come back?”
“I’ll watch him today, dear. But, maybe it’s best if you find a more permanent solution onwards. You know I love him dearly, but I’m not getting any younger I’m afraid. I’m sure it would work with one of the elves, they did a fine job with you, didn’t they?”
Draco raised his hands, in a gesture to stop Potter from rambling on any further. “Relax! I’m not judging you. Drink all of it and see if I care. I’m only pointing out that perhaps one of your companions could fetch drinks as well, couldn’t they?”
There was a tap at the window, a grey barn owl looked at him with curious eyes. He didn’t recognise it, but that was no surprise. He opened the window to let the bird in, but it only dropped the letter it was holding and took off. He opened the letter, half expecting it to be from the memory healer, but it wasn’t.
“No, maybe someone should,” Harry said shaking his head at the absurd idea. “Wait, is that what your mother did then?” Harry asked, shocked.
“No,” he obviously lied. “We need our best Ministry employees at the ball, to make a spectacular evening. And that’s my last say in it. I will expect to see you there tonight.” Shacklebolt went back into his office, but before he closed the door, he popped his head out again and addressed his secretary, who sat across from Draco. “No more visits today, Dora!” She nodded and tried her best not to stare at Potter, who was still standing in the middle of the room, glaring at Shacklebolt. Shacklebolt then turned to Draco. “I’ll need the latest numbers from the Department of Magical Games and Sports.” Then he disappeared into his office, closing the door behind him.
Draco swallowed, “The Ministry?” he asked, while slowly walking backwards to the door, not wanting to leave in the slightest. He knew that it was a shitty job, but at least it had been his, and now he’d ruined everything just to make up for something he already thought he’d made his peace with.
Draco was startled, they hadn't talked about it before, and he was not sure what Harry was getting at, it seemed like something more than just curiosity. “What do you mean?”
When he was buried deep in Harry’s arse, he leaned over and whispered; “Is this what you wanted, Harry?” He pulled out a little and pushed back in again. “My cock, deep inside of you?” Harry only whined as an answer. “Is this what you imagined would happen if I found you here yesterday?” Draco pulled out fully and aligned his cock again against Harry’s arsehole.
“But what about Ron, what does he say?” Harry asked, feeling something like foolish hope taking place in his body.
That was Potter’s voice, and it wasn’t hard to figure out who they were talking about. Draco held his breath, slowly dragging his feet up so they wouldn’t spot him under the stall door. If he thought he was being ridiculous before, it was nothing compared to how he was feeling right now.
“I want to,” Draco said, nodding, because he really did want to try being with Harry. He had wanted him for a long time, thinking perhaps that their fragile friendship would be the only thing offered to him. He’d be a fool if he said no to finally be something more than friends with Harry.
Narcissa looked at Draco, who nodded his head encouragingly. She turned towards Potter again, her eyes still brimmed with tears. “Yes, that would be good, I think.”
And that was that, no other words than “Potter” and “Malfoy” had been uttered between them this entire time they’d been back, and still Malfoy was occupying Harry’s thoughts more and more each passing day. Harry had never let his thoughts linger on other boys before, not doing it deliberate anyway. But after ending things with Ginny at the beginning of the summer, both agreeing they were better off as friends, he started letting himself feel what he wanted to feel and look where he wanted to look. And if that was to look at Malfoy, so be it.
Draco sighed. ”If I ever agree to go on a vacation with you, I want those pictures gone, and a promise that we’ll never speak of this again.” He couldn’t believe he was actually considering going away with this git. He was very certain that it was a terrible idea. But when he looked over at Harry, who was beaming with joy, a warm feeling started to spread in his stomach. Like he thought, terrible idea.
Draco went for the door and turned back to give Pansy a final wave, but she was occupied with Potter, who was whispering something in her ear. She looked at Potter, shaking her head while laughing and patted him on the back.
Scorpius looked like he wanted to argue, but he nodded instead and scraped up the last pieces on his plate.
She was halfway down in the water when he reached her, soaking through his trousers. He tried to grab her arm to steer her back onto land, but she turned and slapped him hard across the face. “You can’t keep me locked in that house forever!” she screamed.
Potter blushed. “I didn’t know that when I bought it, I just thought that Scorpius would enjoy the dragons.”
“Yes, Draco! Don’t get your knickers in a twist. I spoke to Neville, and we think you’ll be pleased. Here, grab this and head to our departing room. It will activate in ten minutes.” Blaise handed Draco a scrunchie and smiled at them both, shooing them in the direction of the room.
“See, I knew this was a brilliant idea,” Harry said, while entering their room. “We’re still both very much alive and well after a whole day together.”
“And your mother won’t be able to stay at home for much longer, so you’ll have a lot of time on your hands.” Harry swallowed.
“Every day I wake up, and I fear that this is the day I’ll meet my mother in the corridor and she won’t recognise me. That she won’t know who I am.” Draco swallowed the lump in his throat making the words harder to get out. “She raised me, took care of me, sang me lullabies and kept me safe when things were at their darkest. And I’m scared that I will look her in the eyes and there’ll be nothing, no recognition. It makes me so fucking scared.” He turned away from Harry again, staring up at the ceiling. “It makes me avoid her. What the fuck is wrong with me, Harry? I stay away from home so I don’t have to see her because I don’t want to stop being her son and become a stranger. And if I stay away I don’t have to deal with that. It makes me the worst fucking son in the universe, and I hate it but I can’t seem to change it.” He covered his face with his hands. “And now I’ve lost my job, and instead of being happy that I finally did something right for a change, I regret it because now I don’t have a place to go to anymore. So no, Harry, I won’t go home quite yet, if that’s alright with you.” He sneaked a glance at Harry but looked away again when he caught Harry’s sad expression. “I’m sorry for dumping all that on you,” he said, sitting up. “Your potion was shit by the way, I’m still drunk.”
Harry turned around to go back when the sensation of magic trickled over him, it felt like a spell ending, like water drops running down all over him, and then it was gone. He stood still, trying to hear descending footsteps or any other sign of someone being here with him, but the tower was empty.
Harry continued laughing while climbing onto his bed, muttering a spell, and a few seconds later he was sprawled out, tied to the bed by both his arms and legs.
“It’s okay my boy,” Andromeda said, pulling Scorpius towards her again, giving him a tight hug in return. “I won’t break.” She turned to Draco, “I’m not that old, dear nephew.”
“I don’t know what to say to you. I know I’m oblivious sometimes but please, I stare at you every time I get the chance, how haven’t you noticed? And no, I don’t know everything about you, yet. But I want to. Please, Draco I really want to” Harry said while taking a tentative step forward.
“Yes, if that’s alright with you? I think it would be wise for me to come along. I don’t know if my mother can explain what’s happening to her,” Draco said, feeling a little embarrassed.
As the pain subdued, he stood up on wobbly legs and rushed to the fire place. He threw in the whole bowl of floo powder and called out,
“I’m in love with you,” he blurted out, then instantly covered his mouth with his hands, as if he could take the words back. But Malfoy just smiled at him and sat down beside Harry on the bed.
Malfoy deadpanned, “I didn’t want you dead before Potter and I certainly don’t want you dead now. Are you saying that you thought I was lounging around that couch every night out of coincidence? Are you that stupid?”
He went to find Ron and Granger to say his goodbyes, with an excuse that Scorpius had wished for him to come home, and he apparated as soon as he came outside.
“I haven’t talked to her for a long time. I don’t see her for more than a couple of minutes a day, at most. Sometimes I don’t even see her at all. Why can’t I just be a decent son?”
Blaised just laughed at Draco’s attempt at shoving him away, and put an arm around his waist instead. “That makes me repeat my question. Who are we trying to fool?”
Draco was used to his father’s tactics, so his attempt to scare him didn’t bother Draco in the slightest. What did bother him though, was the little tic his father did with his left eye, the one sign Draco knew meant that he was lying.
They continued eating their breakfast in silence, then split of heading towards their different classes. Harry didn’t take as many classes as Hermione did this year, and Ron was focusing most of his time coaching the Gryffindor quidditch team, so he was alone for the rest of the day. He knew he could be a bit oblivious from time to time, but not noticing that something was off with his friends felt low even for him. Maybe if he could get this sleepwalking thing sorted out, he could be a better friend and stop living inside his own head. When it was time to go to bed that night, Harry conjured some rope and tied himself to his bedpost. It wasn’t comfortable, but maybe this would finally do it.
Narcissa was startled. “Oh Lucius, you scared me.” She held one of Scorpius’ toys against her chest while she turned towards Draco.
Harry took the cup away from Draco and took his face in both of his hands. “It’s okay.” He brushed his lips against Draco’s in a gentle kiss. “You’re here now. That’s all that matters.”
Michael was funny, in his own sort of way, and not too sore on the eyes. So when they stood waiting for the elevator, Draco didn’t object to Michael pressing him up against the wall beside it. Draco chuckled at Michael’s poor attempt at dirty talk, and tried to get himself in the mood by closing his eyes instead, conjuring fantasies of a different voice whispering in his ear. The elevator pinged, announcing its arrival, and when Draco opened his eyes again he found himself staring right at Potter over Michael’s shoulder. Potter had a frown on his face, and Draco couldn’t help but gently push Michael away from him. All three of them entered the elevator.
He knew his boss was dealing with something that wasn’t quite on the legal side of things, but he didn’t know what, and Mr Finley was a master at hiding his inventory and himself whenever the Aurors came around. Even if he wasn’t the greatest boss, at least he didn’t put Draco in a difficult spot more than necessary.
All of Harry’s friends were scattered around the Leaky in different constellations. He sat and watched them with amusement, feeling happy that he actually took the time to see his friends after all, even though he’d been very busy at work and had that presentation looming over him. It was totally worth it, he thought, while looking around the room. Ron was dancing with Seamus and Dean, a weird dance that somehow involved circling around Luna, while she flopped her arms around in the middle. Draco was over by the bar chatting away with Hermione and Pansy. And he could see Ginny and Neville downing shots together with Blaise.
“Did you spend your night with Draco again then?” Hermione asked, making Ron splutter pumpkin juice over the whole table.
”So when you danced on the table at Blaise and Neville’s party, that was you being sophisticated?” Harry said with a badly concealed grin.
Work was hectic the next day and he found it hard to concentrate. He hadn’t bothered looking for Potter after Shacklebolt left the night before, instead he’d apparated straight home and got himself off to the memories of Potter’s heated gaze. He had a hard time sleeping afterwards, because too many thoughts about what it all meant were buzzing in his head.
Draco nodded, ”You don’t say?” He sipped his drink and tried to suppress all the confusing feelings over Potter knowing his order. Malfoys were above feeling confused.
“What do you mean we only have one room? Surely there must be some kind of mistake? Check the names again,” Draco told the witch, who had just dropped the bomb that he was about to share a room with Harry for three days.
Overall, Draco had everything he could wish for. He had his job, his mother and his son, he didn’t need anything else to be happy. But laying in his bed in the middle of the night, staring at the empty space beside him, it was harder to accept that as the truth.
“I seem to have been sleepwalking a bit lately. So, sorry if I’ve woken you, or ignored you or whatever,” he said a bit awkwardly.
Scorpius nodded and walked towards Potter. Draco could hear him ask for a hug and see Potter smiling at him, but when he glanced towards Draco the smile vanished from his face and he almost looked weary. Potter raised his eyebrows like he was asking for permission. Draco snorted, but he made a motion with his hand as to indicate to go for it. He then watched as Potter smiled again, a big bright smile that took over all of his face, and he leaned down and gave Scorpius a big hug.
“I’ll go get the Aurors for you, mother. You should rest in the meantime.” He lowered himself down to Nimly’s level, making sure his mother didn’t hear him. “I need to get some help, can you keep an eye on my mother and Scorpius until I’m back?”
He stumbled out of the hearth, falling down on his knees and tried to hold his breath till the nausea subsided.
“Stop thinking that everyone’s pitying you,” Harry groaned, dragging his hands through his hair. “Why can’t you accept that people want to do nice things for you? Do you think that you’re so worthless that people can only offer to help you out of pity?” He shook his head.
Narcissa untangled herself from Draco’s embrace and turned so she was facing him. She wiped away Draco’s tears with her thumb, like she always did when he was a child, and gave him a sad smile. “I’m tired.”
“I––” Draco started, but got lost for words. Potter didn’t look mad, just surprised. And uncomfortable, really uncomfortable judging by the way he looked everywhere else but at  Draco. Draco was being ridiculous. He had every right to be here, he was invited. “I came to give Granger my best wishes. Weas–” He could see Ron coming up behind Potter. “Ron invited me.”
“She can’t wait that long. Please, there must be someone who will meet with her?” Draco begged, looking over his shoulder at Andromeda who looked back at him worriedly.
Draco felt scared, like his whole world had been turned upside down and he hadn’t been along for the ride. He cleared his throat, “I think you should go.”
“I like you, Draco.” Harry took a step towards him, his arms forward as if trying to calm down a wild animal. “I think you’re fucking brilliant and you and I both know that working with potions is something you’re good at. Why shouldn’t I offer to help you if that’s something I can do? You don’t have to do everything by yourself.”
“We do,” Malfoy said, with a nod. “I could probably do that speech in my sleep. Potter here, on the other hand…” He gestured towards Harry.
Draco pushed the chair closer, so he could put kisses on Harry’s lower back, still keeping his fingers in him. He let his tongue wander down his crack, licking around his fingers.
Potter however, was still a tense affair. They weren’t hostile to each other when they crossed paths at Andromeda’s nowadays, but they weren’t exactly friendly either. Potter was usually fidgety and looked like he wanted to be anywhere else in the world than standing talking to Draco. They seldom exchanged more than a few words between them, and the words that were said were often about the weather or how big Teddy and Scorpius had gotten.
Draco shook his head. This night wasn’t for reminiscing about his fragile friendship with Potter. He downed the rest of his drink, and let his eyes search the room again. This was getting boring, so when he locked eyes with Michael Corner, he raised his eyebrows in a silent invitation and nodded towards the exit. Michael smirked at him, and gave a discreet nod back. Draco put his glass down, and gave Potter a last glance. He had started to sweat now, tiny pearls on his forehead that got reflected in the lights from the ceiling. Just before Draco left the room, he saw Granger politely steering Potter away from the crowd.
“I really want to forget it so I won't mention it again,” Draco smiled. He went into the fireplace, but before he said Andromeda’s address he turned his head again. “And Harry?”
They stood by the door examining the room. It was small, but it did contain a bed and a sofa. Draco didn’t dare look over at Harry’s expression, afraid that it would tell that Harry was really upset about having to share a room with him.
Draco shook his head, not wanting to hear anymore. “I don’t need anybody’s help. I– I can fix this on my own.” He headed towards the Floo, this was too much. He heard that Harry was trying to stop him but he didn’t care, he just wanted to get away.
Draco woke up to the unmistakable sound of curtains being drawn, the early light of April filtering through his room. He drew the cover over his head, but he knew it was only a matter of seconds before someone climbed into his bed, and with a little luck, that someone would not knee him in his balls this morning.
“Not a fucking word to that bint!” Draco said, raising his finger at Harry. And then he stormed off to the elevator. Harry laughed and followed closely behind.
When he neared the store the next day, he knew that it was over. The door was wide open, glass shattered around on the ground. Aurors were going in and out carrying boxes while all of the shop’s quirky magic figurines were flying around or trying to hide away in the corners of the store. Ron was standing in the middle of everything, directing his colleagues, but he stopped when he saw Draco, motioning for one of the other Aurors to take his place.
Draco felt calmer when they were finally seated for dinner. They’d had tea many times before and even though both Scorpius and Andromeda had been around as a buffer at those times, this felt more relaxed and natural. But as the plates were finished and Harry suggested they move to the living room, Draco’s stomach was tied in knots again.
Potter shook his head. ”No, it’s okay. No need to apologize. Maybe I’m the one who should say sorry, for stealing your boyfriend when you were occupied with Mr. Boring.”
Andromeda patted his cheek, “I was only asking if you had plans for tonight? Any of your friends in town to take you out for your birthday?”
He did run into Potter quite frequently at Andromeda’s, but it never became less awkward. Draco often tried to organise his visits so they wouldn’t be there at the same time, but Andromeda was a Slytherin to the core, so it shouldn’t surprise him that she invited Potter to Draco’s birthday gathering. She had mentioned a couple of times that she thought Draco’s lack of friends was a concern. If she thought that Potter was up for being his friend she was surely mistaken though, Potter wouldn’t even look Draco in the eyes when they met so they wouldn’t exchange friendship bracelets anytime soon.
Malfoy didn’t say anything more, but Harry heard footsteps behind him, and then a door that closed. And yes, while naming other things that was new this year, his stupid crush on Malfoy was also one of them.
Nilmy didn’t seem to want to answer because she sent worrying glances towards Lucius, and Draco knew immediately that he had something to do about it.
“Good night,” Draco answered. When Harry had reached the top of the stairs Draco said his name to stop him. “Thank you. I’ll be out first thing in the morning but again, thank you. For helping me with my mother and helping me tonight. You didn’t have to.” He looked up at Potter, who smiled down at him.
Draco could honestly say that he didn’t handle things great after the war. He was broken and sad, all of his beliefs crumbling at his feet. He felt disoriented and lost, and when Potter had spoken in his favour at his trials, he didn't say thank you as a good person would. Instead, he lashed out and accused Potter of pitying him, and then left the courtroom in a hissy fit. Now, several years later, Draco could easily see why Potter had pitied him. Hell, even he pitied himself from time to time, that scared boy who couldn’t tell right from wrong even if it bit him in the arse. After several weeks of self-contemplating (and several bottles of Ogden’s), he tried to man up and apologize to Potter, but of course, Draco couldn’t get him to listen. He did try when they bumped into each other in the middle of Diagon Alley, but he was brushed off almost immediately. Draco had tried going after him, but he was surrounded by his fans who didn’t want to let him through. After an attempt at turning Potter around, he found himself pushed backwards by Potter's angry mob, tripping over his own feet and landing in a puddle of mud while people stood around chanting that he was a filthy Death Eater. The spread in the
“Dad! You must come and look at this awesome book Harry gave me.” He dragged Draco towards the sofa. “It has dragons and fireworks in it, and a hero that can talk to snakes.” He pushed Draco down to the empty space besides Potter that Scorpius had left behind.
Harry’s smile was blinding when he put his arms around Draco and dragged him close. “I thought you didn’t like me,” he whispered.
Draco took a tentative step forward. “That was my fault. I’m really sorry if I made you feel like I didn't want to spend time with you, because, I really do want to do that. Spend time with you, that is.”
“Spending time with me makes you feel like a ghost? Am I really that horrible?” Harry asked with a small smile.
“Draco?” Someone shook his shoulder gently, making his forehead rock against the bar. Someone must have spilled something because Draco was fairly sure that his forehead was glued onto the surface. He was also fairly certain that he was the one who had knocked the sticky content of his glass all over the bar.
“Just making the rounds, Draco,” Ron smiled, picking up one of the figurines and inspecting it closely, while Auror Jon Kristoff was hovering behind him.
Draco held his gaze for a couple of seconds, then he sighed. If Potter was telling the truth then Draco had overreacted and it would be silly to leave him hanging. “Apology accepted.”
“Good for you mate. Now you can finally act on your feelings. I’m happy for you.” Ron gave him a hug that Harry didn’t reciprocate.
When they both had said their goodbyes to Andromeda and Scorpius had given Potter another big hug, they were headed towards the gate. They were just about to leave when Potter caught up to them.
He always went all out to get new robes for every occasion. Say what you want about Draco Malfoy, but there was nothing faulty about his fashion sense. This night he was wearing a dark maroon suit under an embroidered robe, which had an amazing fall, if he could say so himself. He could. And he did, to anyone who would listen. Pansy had left his side a little while ago, she’d spotted the Weasley girl and left mid sentence. She had no patience, that one. Perhaps she didn’t need it, Draco thought, as he saw the two girls sneak out of the the place.
Draco took a sip from his coffee. He looked down, pretending to read the newspaper just to avoid Harry’s eager eyes. He gave up after a couple of minutes because it felt like Harry was staring a hole through his forehead. He was like a dog waiting for his treat.
“Sir! Sir! Sit down, please!” a flight attendant said while walking up to Draco to get him to return to his seat.
Draco looked down at the mess he’d left on Harry and a tingling sense of possession ran through him as he saw Harry marked with his come. He couldn’t help but trace his fingers through it. Harry laughed while he took Draco’s hand and placed it against his own lips instead, then he slowly licked the come off.
Potter stared back. Draco could feel the tension building between them, and was just about to take a step closer, when they were interrupted by Shacklebolt, who dropped a heavy hand on each of their shoulders.
Andromeda came up behind him and put her hand on Draco's shoulder, squeezing it lightly. “What now?” she asked carefully. “I could talk to Ha–”
and turned to Draco. “What are you doing? You’re almost blowing our cover, he could be on this plane you know,” he hissed.
His Harry. His beautiful, stubborn Harry. Who was out there somewhere, not knowing how much he meant to Draco.
“It’s a silly thing to keep on doing, don’t you think?” his father answered nonchalantly. “I for one don’t care about the state of the weather in March 1996, for example. I’m glad that she finally decided to put an end to noting down tedious memories.”
He stumbled out of the fireplace at the Manor, brushing himself off before he sneaked into his mother’s room. She was standing by her wardrobe, searching through her dresses.
Harry meant to start with saying that Malfoy was great at his work. But what came out instead was, “You have very fit eyes.”
- said, squeezing Draco’s leg gently, probably in a friendly manner but the touch sent shivers down his spine.
“I need to get Scorpius. I’m sure Andromeda would like to be released from taking care of two six-year-olds.”
“You can stay if you want. I’ll go grab you a blanket.” Harry went down a corridor and came back with a knitted blanket, embroidered crooked letters all around the edges.
“He was upset for all about ten minutes and then we snogged, and it was over and done with,” Hermione said with a smirk, knowing that Harry didn’t like the snogging part. They were like his siblings for god’s sake, they could snog all they wanted not just in front of Harry. Okay, they could do that as well but after a couple of hours a day all through summer Harry had started to find the whole thing a bit offensive. “He’s done many stupid things Harry, but he’s not a bad person. Not anymore,” she said, stroking a hand over Harry’s arm, and left him alone in the common room.
me, Kingsley! You told me I could miss out on this one. It doesn’t even have anything to do with the Auror department.”
“Let’s go for a walk, shall we? Draco said, a little more gently, just to get the smile back on Harry’s face.
“You mean cockpit, Bert. It’s called a cockpit. You’re absolutely sloshed aren’t you?” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice down.
Draco deepened the kiss and was awarded with Potter’s hands on his hips, tugging him closer. He put one of his hands in Potter’s hair, the other one clutching his jaw. He broke the kiss to look at Potter. “You want this?” he asked.
“We could share?” he heard himself suggest, and then regretting it immediately when he saw Harry’s raised eyebrows. “I mean, we could transfigure it to a bigger bed of course. It’s not like I want to sleep with you, because I don’t want that. Sleep with you, I mean.” Draco closed his mouth, but the damage was already done.
the day after wasn’t pretty, but Draco knew he deserved it so he didn’t try to contact Potter again. Although, he did write a letter to each member of the Weasley family and a long letter to Granger. Not asking for forgiveness, but at least offering an apology for his part in the war and how he had treated them. Surprisingly, the only answer he got was from Ron, who thanked him for reaching out to them, but saying they were too fragile to offer anything else at the moment.
She looked at him, frowning a little, but then she smiled and shook her head again. “No, just a short while. We’ll see you later if you’re joining us for lunch?”
He had been visiting his mother earlier that day. She didn’t have that many days where she was cohesive for a longer period of time and Draco was happy if he only got one moment of clarity, though today he didn’t know if that was the case anymore.
“Draco, what’s wrong?” Potter asked in a worried voice, but still kept his distance. “Healer Biddle, what’s wrong with him?”
“Sometimes you have to know when it’s time to stop trying to fix something that can’t be fixed,” Potter said, squeezing Draco’s shoulder.
His mother hadn’t quite been the same after the war. At first, she seemed relieved to be at home, even though Draco kept his distance and tried to avoid his parents as much as he could, but every time he went home and visited she became more withdrawn and her eyes seemed to lose their spark. Draco could count her smiles on one hand those first years after the battle. Things became a little better after Scorpius was born, she talked more and she loved being able to spend time with him as much as she could and as much as Draco let her in the beginning. After they'd moved back home she was almost herself again for a while. His mother took care of Scorpius when Draco was caught up at work, or just too exhausted to look after his son, and things fell into a routine after that. But last year his mother had started to change again. It wasn’t something that happened from one day to the next, it was more a slow subtle change in her behaviour, one where she became quieter and lost in her own thoughts more often, and the Narcissa that he knew seemed further and further away. He knew that he should do something about it, but every time he tried to talk to her about it she just brushed it away telling him that everything was fine, and instead of arguing, he tried to believe her.
“Harry is fine, you know,” Potter said, tapping Draco on his knee, leaving his hand resting against Draco's leg.
"Rules, Potter, we need rules." He said. "First, no Gryffondor hangout here. Second, do not touch anything."
"It's open" said Malfoy, from inside the room. Harry entered and saw him grappling with the cuff of his shirt, which didn't want to close. "Oh, it's you. It’s not exactly the right time." He told him.
Anyway, Ron was the most shocked, even more than Blaise. Slughorn entered in the class and consigned the ingredients' list. Arrived at Hermione and Ron's table asked "Where's Harry?" Ron pointed, still puzzled, the table where Harry and Draco sat. "Oh" To Harry’s astonishment, the professor was even more surprised than the others.
Shortly before midnight, Harri stopped to watch the scene: she had a husband who loved him, a wonderful family, wonderful friends... he had everything.
Hermione struck him with his eyes "Harry, I am so sorry. I noticed that there was something between the two of you. I deduced it from the way he looked at you."
"You're avoiding me, why?" He was desperate, one day he kissed him and another day he pretended that he didn't exist.
"It doesn't matter, really." He smiled at him and Harry seemed to have seen some... Pain? They tightened the box for a few moments, then Draco left it, said "Merry Christmas" and left, leaving once again a void in Harry's chest.
He realized about what they were talking about and protested "I don't snor! Do I, 'Mione?" (looking at her with an accomplice face) "even you now! Okay maybe I snore a little"
"I always thought that, If you didn’t figure it out on your own, she or Granger would have told you" He admitted.
"Okay. It's my turn now. You had been a jerk! How could I possibly find out about the flower?! Anyway, yes, I am diffident, but you know why? I grew up relying only on myself. My Muggle aunt and uncle made me sleep in a cupboard for eleven years. They called me 'wrong'. I used to eat my cousin’s leftovers and wear his trash clothes. When you told me you didn't need my pity... Maybe it was kindness, or maybe it was pity, but I’m like this, wanting to save others, because that’s what I’ve been doing all these years, with Voldemort. I’m also stubborn, pretty much. You know why? Because I’ve lost too many people in life. That night, in the forest, I'm really dyed. That night I Iost even a part of myself, the worst, yes, but I lost it. Listen, I'm not going to lose another person, the most important, actually."
Ron couldn't hid a smile and shook his head "Slytherin". At that point, with the grace equal to his emotional sphere, Ron dropped the trunk and overturned all of Fred and George's Ton-Tongue Toffee ('just George's', he thought). "Bloody hell!"
"I can't say anymore what's happening to us. I thought we could move on, but we’re always stuck in the past" Draco could understand him. Who couldn't?
"Sorry." Draco began. "I want to apoligize to you all. It doesn’t matter if I did anything to you directly or not. The girls said it tonight. We have to move on and I can't before doing this. I want to apoligize for hadn't been there, or for had been there and had done anything. I hurtled so much people... I hate myself sometimes. I am not asking your forgiveness or your pity. I just wanted you to know that I'm sorry."
Now they were laughing. It was an idiot sometimes, but Harry had to admit that he was really funny. Anyway, they started study and between them reigned the silence for a while. When Harry conclused his Potions' essay, he gave it to Draco, who, after a few minutes, looked at him and said "What can I say, Potter?"
Harry admired his hope, it was something he didn't have... Still. He put his head on his shoulder and left a tear.
"Well, it's obvious, isn't it?" Answered Hermione, looking at them "it's a matter of Debt". They still didn't understand. "The two of you have saved each other like several times, it's Life Debt" She explained.
Between kisses, he called him "Harry... Harry, listen to me. I love you, in a extraordinary way. I love you because you're funny, you make me laugh like anyone else can. You're intelligent, actually the most intelligent person I know. You are beautiful, I love you hair, you emerald eyes, God... You're eyes drive me crazy."
"Finnigan, I'm still your principal" McGonagall responded him, ignoring his disappointment. "You will be the students who will most be looked at and followed as an example, so you will understand well that -"
The next morning Harry woke up at the sunrise, next to Draco. The sun lit up his face and Harry felt... lucky. He was there, with the person he loved, everything had passed. Now it was his time to be happy.
"As if I go through your trank usually" Harry huffed annoyed. He didn't think he could do it a complete year.
After he proposed to Hermione and tried to convince her to leave Ron for him, he looked around and saw a person alone, like him. How Harry still doesn’t know, but he went to that table and sat next to Draco Malfoy.
Ignoring him, Draco continued "Third, no communication not necessary. Fourth, no personal question or thing like that. If you want some detaile of my life, you just have to read the Prophet, all Rita Skeeter does is write about the 'misfortune of the Malfoys'." Angrily he went on "Fifth, no girl here."
"Guess what? Looks like Draco missed his first practice, but he still joined the team. Who knows how much he paid." Ron huffed. He felt guilty, it was him who spoke at Nott, the captain of the team. He had to tell them that too. Harry didn’t want to make Draco look like he was taking advantage of it again. Did he want to protect him? Once in the room, Harry told them before about the tryouts.
"Sorry, we had some problem with Cassiopea" Pansy was clearly tired, but she was as beautiful as always.
"Oh, Harry. I am so sorry. If you want to talk, we are here for you, aren't we, Ron?" Hermione immediately reassured him. He had always adored thi affectionate side of her.
"You owe me nothing. I just taught you how to do it, but you did the test not me, you." The sunshine brightened his face and his hair, of a black crow with gold streaks, seemed even more beautiful. His eyes, like two beautiful emeralds, was looking at Draco's, full of happiness. He pushed Harry on the wall and their lips touched. They shared a passionate, sweet, romantic kiss.They kissed again and again, for what seemed like hours, until they lost their breath. Draco let his hand slip in Harry's hair, and pulled one hand on his cheek, gently. He was going to-
"Yes 'sir' " Said sarcastically Harry, but he immediately regretted it, because Draco gave him a dirty look.
"Come back here!" Harry was about to get up, when Draco grabbed his wrist, pulling him to himself in a romantic kiss.
Anyway at five o'clock they said goodbye to Hermione and, with their broom, they went to the field for the first training of the year. God, Harry missed it so much: the grass under his feet, the fresh hair that pervaded him like an electric shock. He feel completely at home now.
"Ouch!" Ron crashed into the door "Mate, why is thi damn door closed?! Come on, we're going to be late for Quidditch. This is the last training before Christmas, I have to tell you a lot of things."
"What a grace" wishpered Draco, smiling. Harry had never noticed the beauty of that smile. It was bright, genuine. It highlighted Draco’s elegant eyes. Draco was... God, with this hair, sprained and more naturale he was... Perfect. They might had looked at each other for too long, because Neville need to call them "Guys, is everything ok?"
"I am so sorry, really. I didn't mean to hurt you in that way. I didn't know the spell, it said 'against the enemies' and so I thought that maybe... But you weren't a true enemy and I knew it... And I am very sorry" Harry didn't know what else to say... He had a lot of questions...
Now they were again in silence. They all know that Pansy was right. They just had to admit to themselves.
"Yes. It's excellent. I don’t know what else to call it." Answered Draco with a big, bright smile. They look at each other for a few moments, or an eternity for them. Their leg was touching... And Harry's hand reached Draco's. Their fingers intertwined, causing some kind of spark.
Decised to avoiding from him for the rest of the night, Harry remained in his room, thinking about what Malfoy said btw girls. He felt nothing but a certain... repulsion? This couldn't be true. He left Ginny just two months ago... The only girl he’s ever had a serious relationship with. It's true that something in his relationship felt wrong... Could this possibly have something to do with Malfoy? Harry was even more mystified. Maybe-
They arrived at King's Cross just in time for the Hogwarts Express, saing goodbye to Mr and Mrs Weasley, they got on the train, where they found someone familiar.
They sat on the grass, looking at the lake. Harry was playing with his hair when Draco said "What do you want to do after the school?"
"You deserve it" He simply answered. In fact, Ron had always been better at making strategies and choosing players than he did.
"Draco is at the workouts, come in" Harry was so agitated, the only thing he heard was his heartbeat.
"Are you going to come in or not?" she asked to a shocked Hermione. She was going to move when Crookshanks preceded her and jumped on Pansy's bed. She was about to call him back when he started purring, 'great, he prefers her to me' Hermione thought.
"Thanks. You can't understand how I appreciate this." Harry was grateful, but... Ron? What would What would Ron have thought?
"So my inkwell decided to kill itself, right?" Nott still had some ink stains here and there, but Seamus didn’t think it necessary to warn him. Harry would pay to see his reaction.
"Every day I wake up with a scar that I didn't know I had. I carry them around, or rather, they carry me around ... I live with them. Every time I close my eyes they are here, next to me. They laugh and I hear them... I hear him. But, as I keep falling and rising, I hope that one day I'll make such a spark that they catch fire."
Since that night everything changed. Hermione found in Pansy the sister she never had (and came to the conclusion that she liked Crookshanks). Hannah, before go to sleep, always said goodnight to Luna and her Nargles. Justin bought a new plant for Neville and Seamus a new inkwell for Theodore. They formed a large group and spent their evenings together.  Draco and Ron spent their evenings playing chess, because, finally, Ron had a worthy opponent. The girls, especially Hermione and Pansy, became more and more friends every day. The others used to talk about Quidditch and, occasionally, football, too.
"Well, Ron and Hermione already knew... I mean, not that," He said, looking at their hands "and Luna already figured it out"
"Moron" He admonished him and he went to his homework. However, before he sat down, he turned to him "It's too late for that help?"
They started working and after a few seconds Malfoy shot "Don't! Sorry, the potion doesn’t need a broken dragon claw, I thought that at your old age you knew how to read. Give me this knife."
